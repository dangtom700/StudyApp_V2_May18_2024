Foreword
Philosophical problems often arise when we refect on something familiar and then 
it suddenly becomes strange and wonderful. Augustine famously noticed that if no 
one asked him, he knew what time is, but if he wished to explain it to one who 
asked, he did not know. Communication is like that. We humans are typically 
profcient communicators, because all our complex social existence depends on it. 
We are constantly exposed to communication, and we know how to practice it even 
in very elaborated contexts, as, for instance, giving a public speech, joining a team 
meeting, and posting on a social network. Yet, reasoning about the very nature of 
communication is not something we are equally accustomed to do. This book is an 
invitation to refect on communication and an introduction to the most important 
philosophical issue that one is likely to have to deal with by doing it.
But is it worth engaging in such a refection? After all, we already do commu￾nicate skillfully. So, it could be argued, why should one get encumbered by 
abstract philosophical problems rather than just practicing communication, if 
one’s goal is to get better at it? Admittedly, the idea that refection could hinder 
action is part of a certain received lore about philosophy in general. And indeed 
there have been even philosophers who have conceived their job as that of liberat￾ing us from the very philosophical problems that we burden ourselves with. Be 
that as it may, there is an important distinction to make regarding communication 
between skills and competences. While reasoning about communication might 
not directly make one better at communicating in specifc contexts and with spe￾cifc techniques, it defnitely improves one’s knowledge and mastery of commu￾nicative phenomena. In this sense, reasoning about communication makes one a 
better communicator as a professional fgure. Indeed, this book is primarily 
addressed not as much to philosophers, who have plenty of independent opportu￾nities to think about the problems discussed here, as to those who have chosen 
communication as their job or intend to do so.
This is precisely why this book is an introduction to the philosophy of communi￾cation. It provides the philosophical background that is required to understand and 
discuss the theoretical questions raised by the analysis of communicative phenom￾ena. It consists of three parts, devoted respectively to the theory of communication, vi
the theory of conficts, and the theory of organizations. These are the main areas in 
which professional expertise in communication is formed and exercised, not only 
because they represent some of the major felds in which job positions are open for 
experts in communication but also because they arguably constitute the very theo￾retical kernel of communicative expertise. A communicator must understand what 
communication is and how it works as a unique phenomenon even in the multifari￾ous ways in which humans practice it. That is the ground on which they will be able 
to develop the specifc skills and techniques required by the different contexts in 
which they will be called to operate in their professional life—some of which are 
most likely yet to be invented. A communicator must be aware of the social struc￾ture in which communicative phenomena are embedded. They must comprehend 
the role of communication in transforming conficts and fostering cooperation. 
Indeed, communication is key to any organizing process in which humans come to 
do things together as a group. That is why a communicator must also understand 
how organizations are constituted by communicative means. All of these aspects are 
inextricably intertwined in any real situation in which the expertise of a communi￾cator is required. With respect to this kind of situations, the philosophical point of 
view allows clarifying how meaning is determined through communication, how 
such determination is negotiated among different perspectives, and how such nego￾tiation produces our social reality. This is the main thread that binds the three parts 
of the book together.
In Part I, the bases are laid down for an account of human communication that 
may be plausible from a cognitive point of view. There are different possible 
approaches to the theory of communication. A perennial intuition in the history of 
philosophy, for instance, has always suggested that communication essentially con￾sists in the transmission of codifed information from one individual to another. In 
the twentieth century, such an intuition was epitomized by the mathematical theory 
of communication defned by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. What language 
would look like if it were a code can be understood by learning from semiotics and 
linguistics the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules of a system of signs. We will 
not follow this approach though. Unfortunately, the explanatory power of the code 
model falls short of providing a satisfactory account of how shared information is 
used to interpret communicative exchanges. This is why different intuitions are 
needed to ground the theory of communication. Some important suggestions in this 
regard can be found in the work of Paul Grice. His essential contribution to the 
acknowledgment of the role of intentions in communicative exchanges opened new 
horizons in the theory of communication. He proposed an inferential model that 
sheds light on how fundamental the ability of recognizing one another’s intentions 
is in human communication. Indeed, Michael Tomasello argued that only humans 
exhibit such a complex shared intentionality as is required by their communicative 
exchanges. At the moment, the inferential model seems to stand more chances of 
providing the basis for the development of a cognitive account of communication. 
A signifcant attempt in this direction was made by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson, 
Forewordvii
who originally developed Relevance Theory to account for the cognitive process of 
interpretation of communicative stimula on the basis of shared information. In this 
book, the relevantist approach to the theory of communication is favored and 
adopted for both explanatory and didactic purposes. Notwithstanding some well￾known shortcomings, it provides the expressive resources to make explicit the main 
result of this frst part of the book: the purpose of communication is not to transfer 
information, but to extend our mutual cognitive environments.
Part II addresses the role of communication in confict transformation. The 
notion of a confict has always been problematic in philosophy: some have seen it 
as a positive principle of transformation and progress, others as a negative force 
disruptive of societies. The analysis of confictual situations has proved not to be an 
easy task itself. Joan Galtung suggested to identify several elements that contribute 
to confictual formations: the behaviors of the parties, their attitudes, and the contra￾diction that constitutes the object of the confict. The relations between these ele￾ments help explaining the structure of a confictual situation. Crucial to the 
establishment of these relations are the cognitive environments with which the par￾ties interpret the confict and decide how to act. These cognitive environments are 
shaped by communication. Even once the analysis is clear, however, the confictual 
dynamics determined by the actions of the parties are still very complex to under￾stand. A quite convenient way to model them is by deploying the formal tools of 
Game Theory. At frst glance, however, the game theoretic analysis forces upon us 
a basic anticlimactic result: the choice to cooperate could be irrational in confictual 
situations. Luckily, a more careful consideration of repeated games shows that 
cooperative equilibria can still emerge under specifc conditions. Here again, the 
notion of extending mutual cognitive environments by communicative means is key 
to obtain the transformations in the structure of a confict that can foster rational 
cooperation. This is in fact the rationale of the reframing approach to confict 
transformation.
Part III explores the thesis that communication constitutes organizations (CCO). 
Classical theories of organization mostly looked at communication instrumentally. 
Scientifc Management considered communication only as part of the tasks estab￾lished by an organization plan. Human resources favored communicative exchanges 
mainly as means to improve production. When successive organizational views in 
Systems Theory criticized the unadaptability of these traditional approaches, they 
also ushered a wider conception of the inner and outer fows of information that 
include organizations. Still, systems approaches see information as just part of what 
is exchanged between an organization and its environment. A bolder attempt to 
characterize the role of communication in organization has been developed by Karl 
Weick, who suggested a straightforward identifcation of organizing and communi￾cative processes. More precisely, he argued that organization consists in the pro￾cesses by means of which groups of people collectively try to make sense of their 
environment. Weick gave communication pride of place in the theory of organiza￾tion, but at the price of an ontological tension between the objectual and the 
Forewordviii
processual nature of organizations. The original formulation of the CCO thesis, 
presented by James Taylor and Elizabeth Van Every, tried to release such a tension 
by adopting an emergentist approach. However, the comparison with the results of 
emergentism in the philosophy of mind suggests that the CCO thesis requires some 
integration in order to avoid the paradoxical identifcation of organizations with col￾lective individuals. The various dimensions of the objectivity of organizations need 
to be carefully spelled out. Such an analysis highlights the normative structure of 
organizations as social objects grounded on collective intentionality. Here is where 
communication can really be seen as playing a foundational role in organization, by 
allowing the reciprocal recognition of the members of the groups whose social 
norms constitute organizations as objects and agents.
As is clear from this brief summary, there is a path that the reader is invited to 
follow across the three parts of this book. Like any path, it has a point of departure 
and it has a point of arrival. The choice of such points is as much relevant from a 
meta-theoretical perspective as, if not more than, the trajectory of the path itself. 
Indeed, the precise boundaries of the theoretical investigation in the philosophy of 
communication are all but clear and uncontroversial. Any choice in this regard 
determines a different characterization of the object of the investigation, namely 
communicative phenomena. It is important, therefore, to make explicit the choices 
that have been made in this introductory volume.
As regards the point of departure, we will not start from scratch. In the account 
of communicative phenomena, we will begin with a lot of things already in place. 
We will use the language of cognitive sciences to describe these things. Thus, our 
starting point will be sapient cognitive subjects endowed with meaningful mental 
states. We humans, of course, are such beings. We will express the idea that we 
have beliefs, desires, fears, feelings, and so on by saying that we have mental 
episodes representing states of affairs that are believed, desired, feared, felt, and 
so on. It is important to realize that the idea of the representational content of 
mental episodes is an abstraction. Not every mental episode can really be said to 
represent a defnite state of affairs. More importantly, as far as the topic of this 
book is concerned, not every communication exchange can be analyzed just in 
terms of the representational contents that the participants have and modify by 
interacting with one another.
And yet, while talking about representational contents is defnitely an abstrac￾tion, it is a powerful one. It allows us to draw some essential distinctions. For 
instance, it allows us to distinguish between thermostats, which react to the varia￾tion of temperature in their environment, and cognitive subjects, who act upon the 
content of their mental states. More essentially, it allows us to distinguish between 
inner episodes that do not have representational content, such as itches, arousals, 
and dopamine hits, and inner episodes that do, such as emotions, desires, and beliefs. 
This, of course, is crucial, because while human communication may involve the 
former, it cannot be explained without the latter. Surely, we are not always fully 
conscious and in control of the mental episodes that we happen to have. And it is 
true that communication can be exploited to raise all sorts of inner episodes that can 
Forewordix
deeply infuence both our short-term reactions and long-term behavior. But it is just 
a conceptual mistake to run together the sense in which a thermostat can be condi￾tioned to switch on the heating and the sense in which a person can be convinced to 
buy a certain product or vote for a certain party.
Starting the theoretical investigation about communication without the concep￾tual tools required to draw the distinction between communication and condition￾ing—and thus obliterating the very possibility of discussing it—would be a binding 
meta-theoretical choice that cannot but result in a loss of explanatory power down 
the road. And even if for some reason we were eventually to come to the conclusion 
that communicating is better thought of as conditioning after all, an inescapable task 
of communication theory would still be the characterization of the specifc ways in 
which human beings, as opposed to other things, condition one another. Adopting 
the language of cognitive sciences offers the decisive advantage of letting us put all 
these distinctions in the right focus and try characterizing what is really specifc 
about human communication.
On the other side, the point of arrival of the path is equally revealing of the sort 
of investigation that the reader is invited to pursue. Indeed, it is probably what 
mostly characterizes such an investigation as theoretical. As was mentioned, the 
path will lead us through a very complex and varied terrain. Every step we take will 
contribute a stroke to a portrait of our social communicative practices. Hopefully, at 
the end of this path we will have a better idea of how they are articulated and how 
their dynamics works. Our investigation will leave us with the acknowledgment of 
the essential role that reciprocal recognition plays in the constitution of the com￾municative practices that ground the ways in which our social reality is determined. 
In this sense, our investigation will leave us at the brink of asking a whole new set 
of questions: How such a reciprocal recognition is to be achieved? Who should we 
recognize as members of our social practices? What sort of communication 
exchanges are worth establishing and what is worth pursuing by means of them? 
Why and how should we communicate? Now, these are very essential questions. 
They are, it could even be argued, the most important philosophical questions for 
those who are taking up a career in communication. And yet, they will remain unan￾swered in this book. In fact, those are questions that pertain to communication ethics.
Admittedly, the difference between the theory and the ethics of communica￾tion as felds of research is far from sharp. It is just not the case that ethical ques￾tions can be addressed without a theoretical background on what communication 
is and how it works, nor is the case that theoretical investigation can be under￾taken independently of a frm awareness of the means and ends of communica￾tive practices. The distinction, however, is not completely spurious. It still makes 
sense to classify problems as theoretical or ethical, when they pertain respec￾tively to the account of what it means to communicate and to the analysis of the 
reasons orienting the choice to communicate in one way or another. In this sense, 
the present investigation will be mostly theoretical. The choice to adopt a theo￾retical point of view justifes the inevitably partial selection of the topics and 
authors that will be discussed here.
Forewordx
This book began as lecture notes for an undergraduate course in the philosophy of 
communication at the Department of Civilizations and Forms of Knowledge of the 
University of Pisa. It has been written having those students in mind. As it happens, 
I have learned from them more than I taught and I want to express my gratitude for 
that. I also take this opportunity to thank Brendan George and Eliana Rangel for 
their immensely helpful editorial work and the anonymous readers and reviewers 
for Palgrave Macmillan for their precious comments and suggestions. I am 
particularly grateful to Jolyne Larocque, who helped me to improve the style of the 
fnal version of the manuscript with her careful reading. Most of all, I am deeply 
indebted for the idea of the structure of the book to Carlo Marletti, former professor 
of philosophy of language and communication the University of Pisa, who originally 
conceived this approach as a way to offer a substantial philosophical contribution to 
a professional education in communication studies. He began the teaching of the 
philosophy of communication in Pisa, and I cannot but try to follow his lead and live 
up to it.

Chapter 1
The Phenomenon of Human 
Communication
You are reading this book. You can therefore engage in communicative practices. 
Chances are you are profcient in many of them: discourse, writing, art, social 
media, and so on. If you are, then you know how to communicate. You could prob￾ably even explain what sort of communicative abilities are required to engage in the 
communicative practices in which you are more profcient. But what is it that makes 
those practices, communicative practices? What is communication? This is the 
question the theory of communication tries to answer and is the topic of the frst part 
of this book.
The Origins of the Philosophical Interest in Communication
Why do we need a theory of communication in the frst place? I found that one of 
the best ways to address this question is to look at the very origins of the study of 
communication. As is the case for many other disciplines, it originated together 
with philosophy in the multicultural society of the pòleis, the Greek city-states of 
the ffth century BC. These cities were mostly ruled by oligarchic or democratic 
governments. In such a political context, those who aimed for success in public life 
had to show administrative and dialectical skills: they had to be able to govern the 
city and publicly intervene in assemblies and tribunals. Whoever could teach such 
knowledge and train these kinds of skills was therefore appreciated and well remu￾nerated, although there were cases, even famous ones such as the trials of 
Anaxagoras, Protagoras, and Socrates himself, in which these very same teachers 
were accused of impiety and sentenced to exile or even death.
It is in this society that the fgure of the Sophist was born and spread. A Sophist—
from the Greek σοφός (sophòs), wise—is someone who makes a profession out of 
their knowledge and wisdom. The teaching of the Sophists did not aim to impart

knowledge of the world; to the contrary, it started from the assumption that the 
world is unknowable and truth is not what discourses or arguments could and there￾fore should aim at. Instead, Sophists taught how to fnd one’s way around political 
fghts in which one’s purpose is to make one’s own interests or the interests of one’s 
own group prevail. In this context, the mastery of language acquired a central role 
as an instrument of persuasion, rather than a representation of knowledge. Linguistic 
skills were essential for developing convincing arguments even when reasons were 
weak, or to infuence the emotions of the audience beyond the rational level of the 
argumentation. Thus, Sophists studied grammar, the different forms of discourse 
and style; in fact, rhetoric originated from the Sophist’s interest in language. 
Classical rhetoric was later codifed by Aristotle and developed by Latin orators like 
Cicero. For the Sophist, however, rhetoric was essentially a discipline of skills and 
techniques with no intrinsic value other than as an instrument for the pursuit of 
one’s purposes through the persuasion of the audience; in fact, Sophists and their 
disciples excelled in epideictic speeches, a rhetoric genre in which the speaker aims 
to praise or blame someone or something. In this genre, Sophists challenged them￾selves by arguing for implausible theses: the more paradoxical the thesis, the more 
able was the rhetor.
With Plato, philosophy took a ferce stand against the Sophists and their method. 
Sophistry is addressed as a polemical target in many Platonic dialogues. As far as 
the mastery of linguistic abilities is concerned, Plato distinguished between good 
rhetoric, which leads the listener to the knowledge of what is true, and bad rhetoric, 
which instead beguiles the listener with the purpose of making mere opinions appear 
as truths. To understand how the good use of rhetoric can lead to the truth, an in￾depth investigation of the nature of language and knowledge is necessary. In the 
Phaedrus, Plato explains that the good rhetor must not only master the techniques 
of the discipline but also know the nature of the human soul: the soul, in fact, is the 
target of the persuasion, and the rhetor must understand its functioning in order to 
control the effects that any communicative action may have on it (271c–d); besides, 
according to Plato, the knowledge of the soul is inseparable from the knowledge of 
the truth (258e–262c), therefore, the good rhetor must both investigate it and argue 
for it: the good rhetor, in other words, must be a philosopher.
Plato’s Phaedrus offers several interesting suggestions to the contemporary com￾munication scientist. Clearly, those who undertake the study of communication 
today face social, technical, and theoretical frameworks that can hardly be com￾pared with the one in which the Sophist and the Philosopher confronted each other; 
nevertheless, many of the themes that Plato discusses are still acutely felt as current 
topics of debate. Some of them, such as the ethical problems related to the use of 
communication, will not be dealt with here, because they do not directly pertain to 
the theory of communication per se, in the sense that they do not directly contribute 
to the investigation of what communication is; yet, there is one particular issue 
among those upon which Plato’s criticism of the Sophistic method sheds light, 
which is worth briefy addressing before moving on.
1 The Phenomenon of Human Communication5
The study of communication, as with any other practical discipline, has two fac￾ets: it involves both communication techniques and communication theory. And, as 
is the case with other practical disciplines, the two facets must ft together. Consider 
singing, for instance. It is only the study of vocal technique that allows a singer to 
fully understand how to produce the sounds they desire. To improve their technique, 
a singer needs to know the anatomy and the physiology of their phonatory system, 
to understand how sounds are modulated by the vibration of their vocal chords and 
reverberate into their different oral and nasal cavities, and to familiarize themselves 
with how such mechanism can be controlled voluntarily. On the other hand, a good 
singer is not only someone who is able to produce the sounds they want but also 
someone who knows what they are singing and to whom: voice can be, and has 
been, used in different ways, and choosing which one to use in which context 
requires a substantial knowledge of music and its history.
Similarly, in the study of communication, different techniques must be learned to 
perform effcient communicative acts, and, at the same time, it is necessary to 
understand what communication is, how it works, and why. As a matter of fact, the 
variety and complexity of the communicative contexts and techniques that we are 
often required to master in our society sometimes make us overlook the role of a 
theoretical knowledge of communicative phenomena; still, the latter is an essential 
component of the professional ability to communicate.
The Society of Communication
Handbooks on communication theory typically start by observing how pervasive 
communication is in our lives1
; in effect, it is easy to acknowledge that we are con￾stantly immersed in communicative fows which shape and determine crucial 
aspects of our daily lives. The society in which we live has long been describing 
itself as “the society of communication”: a society in which communication not 
only plays a crucial role but also essentially characterizes what it means for an indi￾vidual to be part of it. We are members of our society insofar as we entertain com￾municative relations with one another. These relations defne our social statuses, 
mold culture and values, and determine economic processes and systems of produc￾tion (as a comparison, think about the role of feudal relations in feudal society).2
1One standard way is to quote the frst axiom of theory of communication developed by Paul 
Watzlawick and his colleague at the Mental Research Institute of Palo Alto: “one cannot not com￾municate” (Watzlawick et al., 1967, 51).
2 Jaron Lanier (2013) argues that, in the current information economy, the market itself can be 
essentially construed as a gargantuan system of exchanges of information. One’s position inside 
such system depends on how one is allowed to communicate with the big servers that drain data 
from the information exchanges and apply their tremendous computational power to produce sta￾tistical predictions about market behavior: those who have access to such predictions acquire a 
decisive social advantage over those who merely produce the data elaborated by the servers.
The Society of Communication6
This sort of self-narration is growing stronger yearly, apparently driven by other 
worldwide and high-impact processes such as globalization and technological 
development. Let us consider, by way of example, just a few of the major conse￾quences of these processes. The integration of world economies is forcing people to 
interact all around the globe, with respect to not only their wealth but also their 
cultures, knowledge, and ideas. The massively increased use of the internet is pro￾gressively obliterating the traditional spatiotemporal limits of the exchange of infor￾mation. Automation is radically modifying our practices and, by extension, the job 
market and the way we work. These processes obviously have both negative and 
positive consequences: the rise of new conficts together with new forms of 
organization.
The complexity of these communicative phenomena may well seem overwhelm￾ing; however, the point is that in this society, communicative phenomena are so 
familiar to us that their study seems to become relevant only when they assume such 
dramatic dimensions that make them hard to manage and analyze. On the other 
hand, reasoning on small-scale examples of communication may seem, at frst 
glance, a waste of time. Still, the analysis of simple cases is often precious for any 
theoretical investigation because it allows us to focus on the right questions. Let us 
consider a few of them:
(1) Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who works as a nighttime taxi driver in 
New York. He is very introverted, and he has problems expressing his feelings 
and emotions to others.
(2) The Me Too movement has sensitized millions of people all around the world 
regarding the problem of sexual harassment. Yet, #MeToo is only a hashtag.
(3) Adam Ondra is a Czeck climber who, on September 3, 2017, free climbed 
Silence, the hardest route ever completed by anyone up to that time. This was 
an astonishing athletic feat, and yet, hardly anyone outside the climbing com￾munity has heard of it. His sponsors asked him to better promote himself; there￾fore, he hired a business manager to take care of his accounts on social media.
(4) The browser cannot load a web page. It suggests checking the internet 
connection.
(5) Joan is a teacher. She has to clearly explain the main topics of the course during 
classes, adjust her methods to the needs and interests of her students, and inspire 
them to develop their analytical and critical thinking skills.
(6) The Israeli-Palestinian confict has become intractable since the Israeli occupa￾tion of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967. The escalation of the confict 
has increased hatred and mistrust between the two populations.
(7) The CEO of a rising tech company is experiencing problems in keeping up with 
the increased market demands, and, therefore, he calls a management meeting 
to discuss the prospective investment in a new factory.
(8) The Civil Protection Agency issues a red alert for hydrogeological risk for the 
whole region for the next three days.
(9) Bob mainly reads the news on social networks. Sometimes it is real; at other 
times it is fake news.
1 The Phenomenon of Human Communication7
We can easily point out communicative issues in any of these examples: empathy 
and alienation, marketing and advertising, media and information technology, 
teaching and public speaking, conficts, organizations, and truth and reliability; and 
yet, are we willing to say they are all the same issue? Surely, communication is a 
multifaceted phenomenon, but in what sense can its different facets be recognized 
as displaying one and the same sort of phenomenon? Indeed, if it really is just one 
sort of phenomenon, what does characterize it? And what does differentiate it from 
other similar sorts? In order to fnd our way around these questions, it would be best 
to begin with the communicative phenomena that more closely concern us as 
human beings.
What’s Special about Humans?
Human beings are natural-born communicators. Right from birth we are both 
actively and passively immersed in communicative fows. Obviously, the frst dia￾logue a human being engages in is the one with their own mother: in fact, it is a 
dialogue that probably takes place even before birth in the mother’s womb. The very 
frst means of communication between infant and mother is the sense of smell. The 
mother is able to recognize her child thanks to olfactory stimuli (Schaal et al., 1980; 
Doty, 1981; Porter & Moore, 1981; Russell et al., 1983; Kaitz et al., 1987; Curran 
et al., 2005; Olsson et al., 2006). The child, in turn, is able to recognize their moth￾er’s individual body odor and locate her breast that provides nutrition (Porter et al., 
1983, 1985, 1991, 1992; Porter & Winberg, 1999; Vaglio et al., 2009). This sort of 
communicative skill is not exclusive to human children alone, as many animal spe￾cies also use forms of chemical communication. Among the most interesting ones, 
there’s the species specifc communication based on pheromones. Pheromones are 
hormonal molecules released into the environment by an organism through urine or 
glandular secretions and can infuence the social behavior of other individuals of the 
same species. The use of pheromones is extensively documented in numerous parts 
of the animal kingdom: surely, it is common among mammals and great primates 
(Michael & Keverne, 1968; Michael et al., 1971; Keverne, 1983). It is not com￾pletely clear yet in what way and to what extent human behavior can be infuenced 
by pheromones.
Mothers and newborn babies can recognize each other’s odor signals, but their 
communication becomes more articulated very early. The child begins to produce 
complex behavioral signals (in particular, vocal and facial ones) that the mother is 
able to interpret and react to in an appropriate way. Children typically show stress 
when they want to be comforted or fed. This sort of nonverbal communication is 
also essential for the establishment of mother-child bonding (Bowlby, 1969). 
Afterward, in the frst months of their lives, children learn other communicative 
strategies. For instance, they learn to obtain what they need (food and comfort) by 
crying: the child experiments that crying elicits a reaction from adults, so that such 
a behavior gets ritualized as a request. Children also learn to express different 
What’s Special about Humans?8
emotions through a process of “affective attunement” (Stern, 1985). This is a sort of 
emotional synchronization of the child with the caregivers; on the one hand, the 
adult empathetically recognizes the internal experience of the child and performs 
the corresponding behavioral manifestation, while, on the other hand, the child imi￾tates the external behavior of the adult and learns to express their own inner states.
Then, around their frst year (or shortly before that) children usually begin to 
point (Tomasello, 2008). They do it universally in every society all around the 
world; therefore, pointing is unlikely a behavior learned by imitation. Children 
point to ask for something or to share experiences and emotions. The following are 
a few clarifying examples provided by Tomasello et al. (2007):
(10) At age 11 months, J. points at the closed window when he wants it open.
(11) At age 11.5 months, J. points at the door as Dad is making preparations 
to leave.
(12) At age 11.5 months, after Mom has poured water into J.’s glass at the dinner 
table, J. points at his glass a few minutes later to request that she pour him 
some more.
(13) At age 12 months, A. points out a window in the direction of the sound of an 
airplane that he cannot see.
(14) At age 13 months, J. watches as Dad decorates the Christmas tree; when 
Grandpa enters the room, J. points out the tree to him and vocalizes.
(15) At age 13.5 months, L. points to the bathroom in anticipation of going to wash 
her hands after fnished eating.
(16) At age 13.5 months, while Mom is looking for a missing refrigerator magnet, 
L. points at a basket of fruit where it is hidden.
(17) At age 14 months, J. and L. have accidents when a parent is not looking; when 
the parent comes to investigate, the infant points at the offending object.
(18) At age 14.5 months, as Mom is bringing the highchair to the table, L. points 
to where it goes.
These examples provide many things worth observing. To begin with, they clearly 
show that children can point at objects that are not physically present at the scene, 
such as the plane, or even at abstract objects, such as the place where the highchair 
should go. In this sense, children exhibit a proto-conceptualization of objects and 
their physical properties. In contrast to the case of olfactive recognition between 
mother and child, here communication does not involve the perceptual level only; 
besides, children must have a certain awareness of what the probable courses of 
actions of their caregivers are and how to infuence them. But there is also some￾thing else that is critically important. Consider example (16) in particular. In order 
to explain why a child points out to the mother the basket of fruit in which a magnet 
is hidden, it is necessary to suppose that the child has something akin to a mental 
representation of the fact that the magnet is hidden in the basket of fruit.
A mental representation is a cognitive subject’s inner state that is provided with 
representational content, meaning it represents something. Thoughts, for instance, 
can be construed as mental representations. Thus, the thought that there is a magnet 
in the basket of fruit is an inner state representing the fact that there is a magnet in 
the basket of fruit. Thoughts are not the only mental states with representational 
1 The Phenomenon of Human Communication9
content: perceptions, beliefs, intentions, desires, fears, and so on are all about or 
represent things in the world. In fact, the philosopher Franz Brentano famously 
characterized mental states, as opposed to physical ones, in terms of the property of 
“being about things”. He called this property “intentionality”, which derives from 
the Latin verb tendere, “being directed to” (Brentano, 1874).3
 Mental representa￾tions seem essential to explain certain behaviors. Consider the following simple 
case: after a while I always get thirsty from speaking during my classes, so I pull out 
my thermos of tea from my backpack and drink. One might try to explain my behav￾ior as a mere response to a stimulus: I feel thirsty and react to that by performing a 
consolidated course of action that results in the satisfaction of my need (maybe I 
learned such a behavior through the positive reinforcement that my actions receive 
when I satisfy my thirst). This sort of explanation does not ascribe to me any mental 
representation, just some (complex) response mechanisms to certain stimula. Now, 
suppose one day during one of my classes I do not reach for my thermos in my 
backpack and I do not drink; instead, I go to the coffee shop on the ground foor 
after class to buy a cup of tea and drink. Could my behavior be explained as the one 
before? Why do I adopt a different course of action? Something like the following 
is probably taking place: I know there is no thermos inside my backpack because I 
left it at home, but I also know I can drink some tea if I go to the coffee shop on the 
ground foor and buy it; it is because I know these facts that I act the way I do. To 
know these facts, I must somehow entertain thoughts about them: I must have men￾tal representations of them. Ascribing these inner mental representations to me 
seems required to explain my behavior. Now, while it could make sense to try to 
explain the chemical communication between mothers and children in terms of 
stimulus-response mechanisms, in order to explain the pointing behavior that chil￾dren exhibit when they are about one year old, it seems necessary to consider the 
fact that children are cognitive subjects capable of thoughts, desires, and, in general, 
inner mental states with representational contents.
Anyway, human beings are not the only ones able to entertain representational 
contents (Bermúdez, 2003). In effect, they are not even the only ones who are able 
to point: many apes can do that as well. However, while they do point for human 
beings, they do it exclusively to ask for something, to make humans do something 
for them. The pointing gestures of the children, instead, are not only imperatives but 
also declaratives: children point to give information to other people. Let us consider 
again the case of the magnet hidden in the basket of fruit. The fact that the child does 
not show any interest in having the magnet for himself suggests he has pointed at 
the basket just to let his mother know the magnet is in there. In effect, this example 
shows that the cognitive abilities required for this communicative behavior are even 
more complex than the mere entertainment of mental representations. As previously 
explained, the child must know that the magnet is inside the basket of fruit, but the 
3 In this sense, “intentionality” is a philosophical technical term which must be clearly understood. 
Intentionality is a property of every mental state and so has nothing to do with the intentions and 
desires of a cognitive agent; conversely, intentions and desires are mental states and therefore they 
have intentionality, meaning they represent something that the cognitive agent desires.
What’s Special about Humans?10
fact that the child points at the location of the magnet for his mother suggests that 
the child also knows that the mother desires the magnet and (possibly) does not 
know where it is. The child seems able to entertain mental representations of his 
mother’s desires and beliefs and to intervene communicatively to modify them. In 
other words, the child is able to have not only mental representations but also certain 
forms of meta-representations: that is, second-order representations, the content of 
which is the representational content of another representation.
Children also point to share their excitement about something. Experimental 
studies have verifed that after a certain age children point not just to obtain some￾thing but also to share attention toward something with someone else. Scientists 
have tested the situations in which children are dissatisfed with the results of their 
pointing. Dissatisfaction suggests they have not obtained what they wanted from the 
communicative interaction. In fact, in these cases there are three kinds of analogous 
situations: (i) the children’s interlocutor simply does nothing; (ii) the interlocutor 
pays attention to them but not to what they are pointing at; (iii) the interlocutor pays 
attention to what they are pointing to but ignores them (Liszkowski et al., 2004). 
These results confrm that the pointing of the children requires particular cognitive 
abilities. Once again, in order to explain the communicative behavior of the chil￾dren, it is necessary to presuppose they are able to attribute beliefs, desires, and 
other contentful inner states to others as well as try to modify them.
The Ninth Month Revolution and the Role of Language
We have said that children begin to point at around one year of age, and we have 
argued that there is a categorial difference between the kinds of communicative 
interactions that human beings are able to entertain in the frst months, as opposed 
to those they will have after one year and for the rest of their lives. What does this 
difference depend on? Tomasello (2008) argues that starting from the ninth month 
of age something extraordinary happens in the cognitive experience of a human 
being. When children are in between 9 and 12 months of age, they begin to under￾stand that other people have beliefs and desires on which they act: they develop 
complex meta-representational abilities. They become capable of triadic joint atten￾tion, that is, they begin to share with someone else the attention toward something. 
Joint attention is just one basic species of a genus of social cognitive abilities that 
allow for the possibility of sharing mental representations. This form of joint or 
shared intentionality consists not only in entertaining the representations of the 
same things but also in being aware of representing them together from different 
perspectives (Tomasello, 2014, pp. 43–46). Example (16) above is a case in point: 
the child shares the attention to the scene with his mother and is aware of her desire 
and of the fact that her beliefs are different from his own, so he collaborates with her 
to achieve a joint goal.
Are these cognitive abilities characteristic of humans alone? Surely, apes have 
certain forms of social intentions. They seem to understand the behavior of other 
1 The Phenomenon of Human Communication11
agents as driven by their perceptions and goals (as opposed, however, to beliefs and 
desires) (Call & Tomasello, 2008). They exploit these basic meta-representational 
abilities to compete against each other but also to cooperate to achieve their own 
goals. They also engage in social activities based on reciprocity, such as grooming, 
in order to obtain something in exchange, such as food, sex, and protection. Apes, 
however, do not seem capable of joint attention like human infants begin to be at 
around nine months of age (Tomasello et al., 2005). Contrary to human children, 
apes never engage in joint collaborative activities.
According to Tomasello, shared intentionality is an important and possibly indis￾pensable cognitive basis for the development of language use and human communi￾cation. Clearly, infants are unable to properly engage in full-blown human 
communication, at least to the extent that they do not speak a language (yet). But it 
is a mistake to just jump to the conclusion that human communication is essentially 
characterized by the use of a system of signs and argue that childhood communica￾tive behavior is not a full-blown human communication simply because it is prelin￾guistic. First, human adults are not the only beings who can and do use signs. Great 
apes, of course, provide another well-documented example: not only can they learn 
to use remarkably wide repertoires of gestural, iconic, and even lexicographic signs 
to interact with humans and with one another, but they also spontaneously produce 
vocalizations or gestures to provide information to others who are engaged in coop￾erative activities (Tomasello et  al., 1985, 1989, 1994; Tomasello & Call, 2007). 
Some of these are spontaneous displays, usually occurring as reactions to specifc 
stimula in certain situations. For instance, vervet monkeys have a variety of sponta￾neous alarm calls to which they respond in a differentiated way: when a vervet 
monkey hears a “leopard alert call” it runs up a tree and sits on a thin branch, while 
it looks up and runs under the nearest bush when it hears an “eagle alert call”, and 
stands up bipedally and looks to the ground when it hears a “python alert call” 
instead (Seyfarth et al., 1980). Instead, some others signals are fully intentional, in 
that they are produced with the intention of infuencing the behavior of conspecifcs. 
Great apes are able to perform different kinds of intentional gestural signals with 
different goals, such as requesting food, initiate play, and get attention (Call & 
Tomasello, 2007). Second, it is questionable that human communication is essen￾tially based on signs. Consider the following exchange, for instance:
(19) A: We have a plan for tomorrow: the ring of Mount Tambura, just trekking, 
6 hours and 800 m drop. It’s the three of us.
B: Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat.
This is a plausible example of a normal conversation.4
 A group of friends is discuss￾ing a trip: A is organizing a trek on the Mount Tambura in the Apuan Alps of Italy 
and invites B. B, however, declines: he is busy relocating. But how are the contents 
of their communication supposedly codifed in their utterances? For instance, which 
is the sign for B’s offer? And which is the one for B’s refusal? It is easy to realize 
4As a matter of fact, it is part of an actual conversation: it comes from one of my Whatsapp groups.
The Ninth Month Revolution and the Role of Language12
that it is not the decodifcation of the linguistic signs that allows us to understand the 
content of the conversation but the interpretation of the exchange in the context of 
the conversation. In fact, if we do not know the exact context, there may be some￾thing that we do not understand. For instance, who is “the three of us”? Is it A and 
B, or is it A and two more friends of his?
The use of signs is neither necessary nor suffcient to characterize human com￾munication. Humans do use signs to communicate, but the very possibility to do so 
depends on their having the ability to communicate already. But what does this abil￾ity consist in for them? If language is not fundamental to human communication, 
then maybe it’s worth not focusing exclusively on linguistic communication only. 
Let us consider human pointing again:
(20) A man in a bar wants another drink; he waits until the bartender looks at him 
and then points to his empty shot glass. (Tomasello, 2008, p. 63)
How can we explain the man’s communicative act? We obviously understand his 
gesture means he wants another shot. Notice that his desire does not simply amount 
to the stimulus to drink more liquor. The man desires that the bartender pours 
another shot of liquor for him to drink. The content of his desire is representational, 
and it is a complex one. To entertain such a content—that is, to have such a desire—
one must know a lot of things about bars: for instance, bartenders are obliged to 
serve clients, clients have to pay for what they consume, a shot is about 50 ml of 
liquid, liquors are served in shots, and so on. The man must know all these things, 
and he must also believe that by pointing to his empty glass, the bartender will 
understand that he has such a desire. In fact, there is no conventional meaning of the 
gesture of pointing to a glass that the bartender could decode. The man must there￾fore also believe that not only does the bartender know all those things as well, but 
he can also somehow read his mind. How else could he be sure the bartender will 
pour him one more shot rather than, say, take his glass away? And, even more fun￾damentally, how could he be sure that the bartender will understand that he is trying 
to communicate with him to begin with?
The Code Model
The idea that communication is essentially intertwined with systems of signs is 
popular and intuitive. As a matter of fact, it is at the core of a certain traditional 
approach to communication: the so-called code model. The code model is a para￾digm for the explanation of communicative phenomena. The expression “code 
model” was coined by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (1986) to pinpoint a general 
conception about what communication is and how it works, a conception that has 
been and still is extraordinarily widespread across many disciplines (from philoso￾phy to psychology, linguistics, art, anthropology, etc.) and adopted by many authors 
from different ages (from Aristotle to contemporary semiotics). According to the 
code model, communication consists in the codifcation and decodifcation of mes￾sages (ibid., 13). In fact, this is precisely the analysis of communication that results 
1 The Phenomenon of Human Communication13
by combining two ideas: (i) the idea that communication is the transmission of 
information and (ii) the idea that information must be codifed to be transmitted.
When Aristotle in the De Interpretatione explains how the signs of language 
come to have meaning, for instance, he draws the following picture:
Now spoken sounds are symbols of affections in the soul, and written marks symbols of 
spoken sounds. And just as written marks are not the same for all men, neither are spoken 
sounds. But what these are in the frst place signs of—affections of the soul—are the same 
for all; and what these affections are likenesses of—actual things—are also the same. (De 
Int., 163a3–9)
Aristotle says that linguistic expressions are symbols, σύμβολα (sỳmbola), of the 
affections of the soul, παθήματα τῆς ψυχῆς (pathèmata tès psychès): language is 
simply a conventional code to express the contents of inner states. Since all men’s 
souls are the same (meaning they all function according to the same principles), all 
men have the same kinds of affections (meaning the soul of each of them is affected 
in the same way). Thus, if you and I perceive the same tree, our souls are affected 
by it in the same way and we both end up with an affection of the same sort. In fact, 
affections of the soul are caused by things in the world, πράγματα (pràgmata). 
According to Aristotle, this principle holds true for both perceptions and beliefs (De 
An., III.4, 429a17–18). Thus, when I perceive something, a material object causes 
my sensitive soul to acquire its form, while, when I think of something, an intel￾lectual object causes my rational soul to acquire its form. In this sense, we could say 
that the affections of the soul are inner states with representational content. Now, 
since the same things in the world cause the same affections and linguistic expres￾sions are symbols of these affections, linguistic expressions can be used to refer to 
the things in the world and thus come to have meaning (Fig. 1.1).
Twenty centuries later, in a similar way John Locke explains in his Essay 
Concerning Human Understanding (Locke, 1689) that language is necessary to 
men to share complex ideas. Human minds, Locke believes, have no innate ideas. 
When we experience the world, simple ideas naturally occur to us as a consequence 
of the causal action of objects on our sense organs: the idea of this particular color 
I see, the idea of this particular sound I hear, and so on. By operating on simple ideas 
the mind can construct complex ones; for instance, by abstracting from several sim￾ple ideas of these whites—for example, the idea of this white of the table, the idea 
of this white of the wall, the idea of this white of your teeth, and so on—the mind 
can construct the general idea of white. To the contrary of simple ideas, complex 
ideas are repeatable—for example, the general idea of white can be applied to the 
table, the wall, the teeth, and so on. Therefore, while no one can have the same 
simple ideas, complex ideas can be entertained by different minds. But how could a 
σύµβολα

triangle
The Code Model14
mind entertain an idea it has not constructed? Clearly, through communication: lan￾guage allows associating symbols with ideas, so that everyone who knows the lan￾guage can entertain the ideas that are communicated by means of it. According to 
Locke, then, communication is based on language and language works like a con￾ventional code for complex ideas.
One of the starkest modern presentations of the basic idea of the code model is 
the analysis of communication developed by Claude Elwood Shannon (1916–2001) 
and Warren Weaver (1894–1978) in information theory. The two scientists’ purpose 
was to explain how information can be transmitted from a source to a distant desti￾nation. Their answer was that the information should be codifed as a signal through 
a channel that connects the source with the destination. When the destination 
receives the signal, it should be decodifed to retrieve the original information. The 
process can be illustrated by the diagram in Fig.  1.2 (adapted from Shannon & 
Weaver 1949).
A very clear instantiation of the model is the process by which, not long ago, data 
were transmitted from one computer to another through analog lines. The modem 
played a crucial role in this process. A modem is a device that performs digital 
modulation and demodulation: it transforms digital information into an analog sig￾nal that can be transmitted through a channel such as a telephone copper cable, and 
vice versa, can retrieve digital information from the analog signal. In our diagram, 
the information contained in the memory of computer A is codifed by the modem 
of computer A as a variation of the wavelength of the electric feld in the copper 
cable, travels through the channel, and is decodifed by the modem of computer B
and eventually stored in the memory of computer B.
The code model is very effective in explaining communication in information 
theory. Yet, it is sensible to ask whether it is plausible to apply the same approach to 
human communication as well. Human brains do not have modems, after all. Or do 
they? As a matter of fact, there is some very well-known neuroscientifc evidence 
about language processing in the brain that can be construed as supporting the code 
model. The main areas traditionally considered as involved in language processing 
are located in the dominant hemisphere (usually the left one) and are named after 
the neurologists who in the second half of the nineteenth century frst identifed their 
role in the performance of linguistic abilities: Broca’s area, located in the left infe￾rior frontal gyrus, and Wernicke’s area, located in the left posterior superior tempo￾ral gyrus. In 1861, Paul Broca published Mr. Leborgne’s clinical report, a 51-year-old 
aphasic patient of his who had lost the ability to speak at the age of 31. Mr. Leborgne 
understood linguistic utterances correctly, but his linguistic performance was lim￾ited to the repetition of the one syllable “tan”. During the autopsy, Broca noticed 
evident cerebral damage in the area that later took his name and advanced it as an 
Source

explanation for the inability of the patient “Tan”, as he used to call him. Indeed, 
Broca’s aphasia affects a person’s ability to speak fuently (the use of function 
words is especially compromised), while their comprehension of language is gener￾ally preserved. A few years later, in 1874, Carl Wernicke identifed a correlation 
between lesions to another area in the temporal left lobe and another sort of aphasia 
quite different from Broca’s one. Patients suffering from Wernicke’s aphasia have a 
fuent and syntactically correct linguistic production, although their utterances are 
mostly meaningless (except for idiomatic expressions) and they experience severe 
diffculties in language comprehension. While Broca’s is an expressive aphasia, 
Wernicke’s is a receptive one. Therefore, from a neurological point of view, 
Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area together seem to account for the ability to under￾stand and to produce language in humans. In this sense, one might think that human 
communication also consists in the transmission of codifed information after all. 
The idea would be the following one. First, assume that some information is some￾how “contained” in A’s mind in the form of mental representations. The linguistic 
abilities of A, that are performed through A’s Broca area, allow A to codify a mes￾sage as a signal that is emitted by A’s phonatory system. The signal travels as a 
wavelength through the air until it reaches the auditory system of B. Then, with the 
linguistic abilities of B’s Wernicke’s area, B decodes the signal and produces a men￾tal representation with the same content as A’s original one.
According to the code model, communication is successful when information is 
transmitted from the source to the destination in such a way that the information 
originally present in the source is then present also in the destination. In this model, 
communication is conceived as the solution to the problem of letting the destination 
have the same information of the source when such information is not directly avail￾able to it. Consequently, communication among humans would be required because 
everyone’s own mental representations are private, and there is no direct way for 
others to access their contents: we cannot simply read each other’s minds; therefore, 
we have to communicate. The transmission of information from source to destina￾tion, then, is possible only by codifying it as a modifcation of the outer environ￾ment. In this sense, there are only three principal ways in which the communication 
might fail. The frst one is because the channel does not reach the destination, such 
as in the case of a severed copper wire between two modems or the presence of a 
wall between two interlocutors. The second one is because the source and the desti￾nation do not share the same code; for instance, if A speaks Japanese and B only 
speaks English, B will not be able to decodify the signals emitted by A. The third 
one is because the signal is altered or corrupted while it travels through the channel. 
The cause of such an alteration of the signal is called noise: for example, a strong 
electric feld could alter the wavelength that travels in the copper cable between two 
modems, loud music could make one’s words inaudible, and so on.
These few remarks are purported to show that the kernel of the code model is 
deeply entrenched in the traditional refection not only on communication but also 
on language and cognition. The code model works well for information theory. If 
communication is essentially conceived as the solution to the problem of exchang￾ing information, then the code model can indeed account for it by describing the 
The Code Model16
outline of an infrastructure in which such an exchange is, in principle, possible. If 
communication is a problem of engineering, then the code model provides a tech￾nological design to solve it.5
 As it was suggested above, however, it is reasonable to 
doubt that human communication is merely a problem of exchanging information, 
and that the use of codes is either suffcient or necessary to characterize what 
humans do when they engage in communication exchanges. It is crucial, then, for 
the defnition of a theory of communication to exactly identify the limits of the 
explanatory power of the code model. Is this model adequate as a theory for human 
communication? If it is, then human communication must succeed when and only 
when the model says it does, that is, when information is transmitted from the one 
communicator to the other, and fail when and only when the model says it does, that 
is, when the channel is broken, codes are not shared or noise is present. In the next 
three chapters we will explore this model to test it against the phenomenon it is sup￾posed to explain, namely human communication. We will consider different ways of 
integrating the basic idea of the code model with various syntactic, semantic, and 
pragmatic analyses to push it as far as possible while preserving its explanatory 
grounds and increasing the set of phenomena that it can account for. Eventually, we 
will reach a point where the model will no longer be reasonably extended; at that 
point, we will see whether there is still something left to explain about human com￾munication for which the code model cannot account.
Chapter Summary
We began with the basic remark that it is hard to overestimate the importance of 
communication in our society. We also noticed that we are all profcient communi￾cators, but we hardly ever stop to think what communication is. Quite interestingly, 
however, the study of communication began just together with the study of philoso￾phy in Greece in the ffth century BC. Indeed, communication has always been an 
essential part of what we do as human beings. In this chapter, we have considered 
an attempt to explain why it is so. According to the cognitive scientist Michael 
Tomasello, we communicate the way we do because we have specifc meta￾representational abilities: we are able to have beliefs, desires, fears, and so on about 
what other people believe, desire, fear, and so on. Tomasello argues on the basis of 
5As any technological design, the code model might even become outdated someday. Maybe the 
problem of exchanging information will be solved more effciently otherwise, perhaps even in the 
near future. The machine learning algorithms operating Google Search do not require that users 
type complete keywords, because they can already guess what is being looked for. Amazon has 
been experimenting with anticipatory shipping since 2013 and successfully uses data crunchers to 
anticipate the purchasing behavior of its customers. Facebook sells its clients the ability to target 
their marketing specifcally to classes of people, categorized by their beliefs, values, preferences, 
and so on. To use a slogan, they aim to know what you want before you know it. They defnitely 
already know much of what you think. No need, therefore, for exchanging information: the analy￾sis of behavioral data will be suffcient.

scientifc evidences that only humans possess these abilities at the highest level and 
that they begin manifesting them at around nine months of age. The fact that we can 
read one another’s mind explains why we try to interpret the behavior of the other 
people on the basis of what we think that they think, desire, fear, and so on. It also 
explains why we sometimes try to change the contents of their mental episodes, by 
communicating with them. Generally speaking, these mind-reading abilities explain 
why we take one another as intending to mean something with our communicative 
acts. Another important thing we noticed is that we can interpret what we mean even 
in cases in which we communicate in nonconventional and noncodifed ways. This 
is obvious as soon as we pause to consider any of the actual communicative 
exchanges that we all have on a daily basis: we constantly communicate things that 
are not codifed in the signs that we use. This simple observation does not ft well 
with a very common view about communication. We called it the “code model”. It 
is the idea that communication essentially consists in the transmission of codifed 
information. The code model has shaped the approach to the theory of communica￾tion in many felds, from philosophy to linguistics, cognitive sciences, and even 
engineering. We concluded, however, that the code model does not seem to be a 
suffcient theory for an adequate explanation of all phenomena about 
communication.

Chapter 2
The Semiotic Approach
As we have seen, the success of communication in the code model depends on the 
transmission of information from a source to a receiver. The possibility of such a 
transmission is based on the codifcation of the information as a signal in a channel 
that can reach the receiver. Generally speaking, a code is just a system of rules that 
associates messages with signals and vice versa. The Morse Code, for instance, is a 
set of rules that associates alphabetical letters to sequences of tones or lights usually 
represented as points and lines. Today, communication technologies are long past 
the Morse Code, and it is quite unlikely that people are acquainted with its use. 
Maybe some remember a popular ringtone used by Nokia cell phones a few years 
ago that was the acoustic representation of the word “SMS” in Morse: three short 
tones, two long ones, and three short tones again, “… _ _ …”. If communication is 
indeed based on codifcation, perhaps the best theory of communication might be 
found by a science that studies how information can be codifed in signs.
What Is Semiotics
From several viewpoints, semiotics can be understood as such a science. According 
to Umberto Eco, “semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a 
sign” (Eco, 1976, p. 7). Such a characterization is extremely general, but it actually 
captures the range of phenomena that semioticians purport to investigate. As a sci￾ence, semiotics was developed almost two centuries ago by two foundational think￾ers, the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure and the American pragmatist 
philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.
Saussure conceived semiotics (or “semiology”, as he called it) as “a science which 
studies the role of signs as part of social life” (Saussure, 1916, pp. 15–16) and as a 
part of social psychology. He thought it should study the general laws governing 
signs and therefore believed that linguistics, as the science of those specifc systems

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-12463-1_220
of signs that are natural languages, should simply be part of it. He also thought semi￾otics, in turn, to be part of social psychology because it should study one of the ways 
in which people are infuenced by one another, namely communication.
Peirce instead thought of semiotics in terms of a theory of reasoning: “Logic, in 
its general sense, is […] only another name for semiotic […], the quasi-necessary, 
or formal, doctrine of signs” (Peirce, 1931/58, 2, p. 227). By “quasi-necessary”, 
Peirce means the fact that signs are given as real and the laws that govern them are 
abstracted by observation and thus fallible (as opposed to mathematical laws). 
According to Peirce, semiotics does not primarily concern communication but 
thinking itself: “we only think in signs”, he says (Peirce, 1931/58, 2, p. 302), and 
semiotics should explain how we experience the world. In other words, we could 
say that semiotics should explain what is for us to have mental representations and 
acquire them.
As it can easily be seen, then, semiotics sets out to investigate the notion of 
meaning on a number of levels: how the signs we use come to have content and how 
we communicate it, how the thoughts we entertain come to have content and how 
we operate with it. This ambitious program is vast, and it has been pursued in many 
different felds of research; in particular, it supported the structuralist enterprise, a 
fortunate research program that in the frst half of the last century proposed an 
understanding of all cultural phenomena in terms of the deep structure of the system 
(specifcally, the system of signs) of which they are part.
The Peircean Model of Sign
As we have said, Peirce’s semiotics is not only an analysis of language: it is intended 
to be a theory about cognition. Therefore, the idea that we only think in signs is the 
idea that the analysis of signs is the analysis of our mental representations. According 
to Peirce, a sign is a tripartite unit. Here is how he explains it:
A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some 
respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an 
equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. That sign which it creates I call the 
interpretant of the frst sign. The sign stands for something, its object. It stands for that 
object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea, which I have sometimes I called 
the ground of the representamen. (Peirce, 1931/58, 2, p. 228)
The representamen is the sign, or, more precisely, the vehicle of the sign: it is what 
stands for something else. To the contrary of Saussure, Peirce accepts that anything 
in principle can be a representamen, be it material or immaterial. What the repre￾sentamen stands for is the object. Peirce notices, however, that a sign stands for an 
object only in some specifc respect, the ground; for instance, a red patch may stand 
for an apple because it is red, while the Apple logo may stand for an apple because 
it is apple-shaped. The interpretant is more elusive to understand. Again, Peirce 
explains that it plays the role of a mediating representation between the representa￾men and the object that is its correlate:
2 The Semiotic Approach21
[E]very comparison requires, besides the related thing, the ground, and the correlate, also a 
mediating representation which represents the relate to be a representation of the same cor￾relate which this mediating representation itself represents. (Peirce, 1931/58, 1, p. 553)
Think about the red patch again: for it to be a sign of an apple, it is necessary to 
understand that the apple is related to the patch because it is red, that is, it is neces￾sary to have a representation of the apple as signifed by the patch because it is red. 
To see why the interpretant is necessary for a sign to be really a sign of the object, 
consider the following comparison: a specifc red rash is a sign of the measles. The 
rash is caused by the measles virus: this is a natural, causal relation between the rash 
and the measles. Obviously, we take the rash to be a sign of the measles because it 
is caused by it. But the causal relation is not enough for the sign: we must have a 
representation of such a relation, that is, of the measles as signifed by the rash 
because it is its cause. This is why Peirce stresses the fact that a sign “addresses 
somebody”: it must be interpreted by a representation, the interpretant.
The relation between the representamen, the object, and the interpretant is called 
by Peirce “semiosis”. Semiosis is the process of constitution of a sign. It is some￾how customary to illustrate semiosis by putting the three elements of a sign by pin￾ning them on the vertex of a triangle: this is very misleading. Such a picture, in fact, 
calls to mind the Aristotelian analysis of symbols which is quite different from 
Peirce’s. Aristotle’s model is composed of binary relations: he thought that symbols 
are conventionally related to the affections of the soul, that the affections of the soul 
are causally related to states of affairs in the world, and thus that symbols may indi￾rectly signify states of affairs. Instead, Peirce considers semiosis as an intrinsically 
triadic relation: there is no autonomous binary relation between signs and objects, 
signs and interpretants, or interpretants and objects.
Since we think in signs, according to Peirce, semiosis is the basic structure that 
articulates our thinking. It is also interesting to notice the role interpretants play in 
this structure. As a mediating representation, the interpretant of the sign is itself a 
sign of the object. But if it is a sign, then it requires an interpretant, which in turn 
cannot be but another sign. The semiosis of a sign, then, generates another sign 
which requires in turn another semiosis; therefore, the semiotic process must be a 
never-ending one. Peirce is willing to accept such an infnite semiosis as a conse￾quence of his model because it is a more sensible alternative to the necessity of 
positing direct intuition to explain how we come to acquire thoughts and knowledge.
Peirce’s model aims for a detailed analysis and characterization of signs. All 
along his career, Peirce proposed several classifcations of signs to be distinguished 
according to the properties of their constituents or the relations between them. At 
the end, he collected up to 66 different sorts of signs, some of which, by his own 
saying, are really diffcult to identify and exemplify. The following outlines three 
basic classes of signs distinguished in Peircean semiotics according to the relation 
between the sign and the object. A sign is an icon when the representational relation 
between the sign and the object is qualitative. An icon is a sign of an object because 
it shares with it certain properties; for instance, a portrait is an icon of the subject 
depicted in it. A sign is an index when the sign and the object are related by some 
factual (paradigmatically, causal) relation; for example, a weathercock is an index 
The Peircean Model of Sign22
of the direction of the wind because it orients itself according to it. Finally, a sign is 
a symbol when it is conventionally related to its object. Linguistic signs are typical 
examples of symbols. It is important to notice that actual signs rarely instantiate 
only one of these categories: they may be icons, indexes, and symbols at the same 
time. Consider a map, for instance: on the one hand, it is an icon because it repre￾sents distances and shapes, but, on the other hand, it is also an index because when 
properly oriented, it points to certain locations and of course; it is a symbol because 
it is realized by using several conventions.
The Saussurean Model of Sign
Saussure’s model of a sign is dyadic: a sign is composed of an acoustic or visual 
signifer and a conceptual signifed; for instance, a sign is the acoustic image of the 
word “horse” (the signifer) as signifying the concept of horse (the signifed). 
Notice, to begin with, that the sign is not the acoustic image alone; nor it is the rela￾tion between the signifer and the concept signifed. The sign is the whole of them 
as so related. Saussure illustrates the idea with a metaphor. The signifer and the 
signifed in a sign, he suggests, can be thought of as the two sides of a page: it is 
possible to distinguish the signifer and the signifed, but what is there is only 
the sign.
Unquestionably, the acoustic image and the concept are different things, but the 
one is triggered by the other according to a cognitive association: that is the sign. 
The association of a concept with an acoustic image is completely arbitrary; it 
depends on the contingencies that belong to the history of the language. Once a sign 
is part of a langue, however, it is learned as a rule by the speakers who learn to 
establish a psychological association between the signifer and the signifed.
Notice also that according to Saussure, a sign is completely immaterial. The 
concept, of course, is to be conceived as an immaterial content or mental representa￾tion. But the signifer is also immaterial; in fact, in Saussure’s example, he talks 
about the signifer as the acoustic image produced in the mind of the interpreter of 
the sign by the acoustic signal that transmits the sign in an act of parole. While the 
sound waves carrying the signal are material, the acoustic image in the mind of the 
interpreter consisting in the recognition of that sound pattern as an instance of a 
certain string of phonemes in the language is not; therefore, both the signifer and 
the signifed are psychological for Saussure. Later semiologists however admitted 
that the signifer could be thought as material too.
Saussure believed that even if a signifer is immaterial, it has nonetheless a cer￾tain extension. Phonation, in fact, is a process: the sounds that produce the acoustic 
impression in the hearer extend over time, one after another. Besides, since this 
process follows the direction of time, it is linear and irreversible.
2 The Semiotic Approach23
Langue and Parole
What does the semiotician see when they look at the system of linguistic signs in 
order to analyze it? According to Saussure, it is essential to draw a distinction 
between two sorts of objects of study as far as language is concerned: the langue
and the parole. The langue is a system of signs with its elements and its rules. The 
parole is the use of a system of signs in its particular occurrences, the particular 
combinations of signs that are used in particular phonations: thus, when one utters 
a sentence like “It’s sunny today”, one is performing a speech act that is part of the 
parole. Obviously in doing so, one applies the rules of language that is the langue. 
In a sense, then, the langue is the system of rules that governs the uses of language 
in the parole. In another sense, however, the langue as a system of rules is just an 
abstraction from the concrete uses of the language that form the parole. Saussure 
focuses on the study of the langue and certainly gives priority to it over the parole. 
Nonetheless, it is interesting to quickly review his famous description of what he 
called “the circuit of the parole”, namely the process through which linguistic acts 
are performed and interpreted as uses of a system of signs. Saussure depicts it as in 
Fig. 2.1.
The “circuit” describes a communication exchange between two individuals, A
and B. As Saussure explains, it begins in the brain of one of them, say A, where a 
certain mental representation is associated with a certain signal that is produced 
through A’s organs of phonation and transmitted to the ear of the other person, say 
B, who associates it again with a mental representation. The circuit can then proceed 
in the opposite direction, from B to A, by inverting the roles of the two speakers. As 
can easily be seen, this description is strictly congruent with the one proposed by 
Shannon and Weaver as an analysis of communication in information theory and 
that we put forward as paradigmatic of the code model. Again, in this model, the 
role of the system of signs used by the two speakers who communicate is para￾mount, because it is the knowledge of such a system that allows them to associate 
their mental representations with signals that can be decodifed by their interlocutor.

Langue and Parole24
Saussure’s original account of the parole also highlights another aspect of con￾versations: communicators do not speak simultaneously but one at a time, taking 
turns. Although it may sometimes appear as too obvious even to be worth noticing, 
turn-taking is an essential characteristic of conversational practices; indeed, differ￾ent practices in different contexts and cultures can be differentiated and character￾ized precisely in terms of the implicit rules that govern how turns are determined 
and allocated. As a matter of fact, the study of turn-taking is one of the basic tasks 
of Conversation Analysis, a general approach to social interaction originated by the 
work of Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson, and developed into 
an autonomous research feld.1
Systems of Signs
Signs do not come alone as single, contentful units. As we have seen, for Peirce 
semiosis produces infnite chains of signs. The role of the structure of a system of 
signs is even more crucial to Saussure. The most striking difference between Peirce’s 
and Saussure’s models of sign is that the latter has no place for the role of the refer￾ent of the sign, the object that is represented by it. Intuitively, one is willing to say 
that what the word (or the acoustic image) “horse” is a sign of horses; but horses are 
not part of the langue, and so they are not of concern for semiotics (which, as we 
have seen, should be conceived as a part of social psychology). If this is the case, 
however, how can we really make sense of signifeds without referring to things in 
the world? Signifeds, we are told by Saussure, are concepts, that is, we could say, 
mental representations. But how can we make sense of mental representations with￾out the things in the world that they represent? We know the concept horse is the 
concept horse rather than, say, the concept chair, because it represents horses rather 
than chairs. Obviously, this is really not a problem for Saussure, because it is not the 
task of semiotics to explain how concepts are given to us. And yet, consider what it 
would be like to teach the signs of a language to a child without referring at all to 
anything in the world: How could one explain that the acoustic image “horse” is to 
be associated with the concept horse?
The answer to this question is not to be found in the analysis of signifcation. 
According to Saussure, in fact, signs are part of a system: the langue. A sign only 
makes sense inside a whole system in which it is related to other signs; for instance, 
the sign for horse is related to the sign for animal (because every time one can apply 
the sign for horse, one can also apply the sign for animal), to the sign for pony 
(because every time one can apply the sign for pony, one can also apply the sign for 
horse), to the sign of chair (because one can never apply the sign for horse and the 
sign for chair together), and so on. The role of a sign in a web of these relations 
1Conversation Analysis will be discussed again in more depth below in Part III, especially in 
Chap. 16.
2 The Semiotic Approach25
defnes what Saussure calls the “value” of a sign. The value of a sign is explained in 
terms of the relations it has with other signs, and it is this that makes a sign the sign 
it is: signs can be identifed only in the context of other signs.
Signs may have different sorts of relations among them within a system. Saussure 
individuated two of these sorts by distinguishing between “syntagmatic” and “asso￾ciative” relations (Saussure, 1916, p. 121). Syntagms are ordered combinations of 
signs. Syntagmatic relations are the relations that signs have in the syntagms in 
which they occur. Given the linearity of signs, syntagmatic relations can be thought 
as relations between the positions the signs occupy in the axis along which the syn￾tagm extends. In the syntagmatic axis, signs occur one after the other according to 
the rules of the system; for instance, a sentence is an ordered sequence of words 
occurring in different positions, a word is a sequence of letters, and so on. Instead, 
associative relations occur between signs that can be substituted one for another 
within a certain position in the syntagmatic axis. As an example of associative rela￾tions, Saussure provided infectional paradigms. In effect associative relations are 
now commonly referred to as “paradigmatic” (cf. e.g. Hjelmslev, 1943). In this 
sense, the paradigm of a sign can be thought as a set of substituend signs lying on 
an axis that is orthogonal to the syntagmatic one. Figure 2.2 illustrates the interac￾tion of the two axes in a linguistic sentence.
A very commonly used suggestion to help in conceiving the relations between 
the signs in this diagram is to think of them in terms of sequences and … and for the 
syntagmatic axis and or … or for the paradigmatic one: in fact, signs are all placed 
in order, one after the other in a syntagm, while they can be substituted the one for 
the other in a paradigm. An equally common way to illustrate the idea with a com￾parison is to take a meal as an example. Clearly, a meal is not a sequence of signs 
(although someone might be willing to take it as such) but of dishes. In Italy, for 
instance, it takes appetizers and a frst course and a second course and a side dish 
and a dessert to make a full-course meal; yet, you can obviously have different sorts 
of appetizers, pasta or soup or rice as a frst course, meat or fsh or vegetables as a 
second course, and so on.
Systems of signs can thus be investigated by exploring how the operations on the 
two axes modify the content of the signs; for example, the substitution of signs that 
are in opposition on the paradigmatic axis or the addition and deletion of elements 
on the syntagmatic axis. All these relations allow the determination of a sign’s value 
in the system. The values of signs in different languages can also be compared: for 
instance, in English the sign “sheep” is distinct from the sign “mutton” (the frst is 
the animal, the latter is the meat), while in French “mouton” covers both. The notion Paradigmatic axis

Systems of Signs26
of value highlights the role a system of signs plays in codifying and decodifying 
contents through it: what signs signify, in fact, is determined by the structure of 
the system.
At this point, if we ask the semiotician what is special about systems of signs like 
natural languages, they will likely point out, among other things, a specifc charac￾teristic that is usually referred to as “double articulation”; in fact, linguistic signs 
can be construed as doubly articulated in the following sense. On the one hand, they 
are composed of morphemes, that is, minimal contentful units. The sign “walks”, 
for instance, can be analyzed in two morphemes: the morpheme “walk,” which con￾veys lexical information, and the morpheme “-s,” which conveys grammatical infor￾mation. On the other hand, linguistic signs can be analyzed as composed of 
phonemes, minimal units devoid of content. So, again, the sign “walks” contains 
four phonemes: [wɔːks]. The possibility of combining the two sorts of units in vari￾ous ways generates the infnite variety of symbols that language users can produce 
and understand.
A Semiotic Analysis of Communication?
How far can the semiotic approach lead us in the analysis of communication? Not 
very, according to Sperber and Wilson, who harshly judged the semiotic enterprise:
The recent history of semiotics has been one of simultaneous institutional success and intel￾lectual bankruptcy. On one hand, there are now departments, institutes, associations, con￾gresses and journals of semiotics. On the other, semiotics has failed to live up to its 
promises; indeed, its foundations have been severely undermined. (Sperber & Wilson, 
1986, p. 7)
They point out that no substantial grounds have been found for any general theory 
of signs, in spite of the fourishing of semiotic analyses that have been developed, 
and that, in fact, the semiotic approach in linguistics has been progressively aban￾doned in favor of the generativist approach inaugurated by Noam Chomsky (1957).
We should be wary of such a judgment, however, because our main concern is 
not so much linguistics as primarily the theory of communication. It could be the 
case that while semiotics is not the most fruitful or even correct approach to the 
analysis of language, it still provides interesting insights about how languages are 
used to express and communicate contents. Sperber and Wilson deny even that. 
They quote Vygotsky on the analysis of communication in the semiotic approach:
That understanding between minds is impossible without some mediating expression is an 
axiom for scientifc psychology. In the absence of a system of signs, linguistic or other, only 
the most primitive and limited type of communication is possible. (Vygotsky, 1934, p. 6)
Apparently, they argue, the semiotic analysis of communication is inextricably 
intertwined with the code model, so that an evaluation of the former amounts to an 
evaluation of the explanatory power of the latter; hence, Sperber and Wilson develop 
2 The Semiotic Approach27
their criticism of the code model and ignore semiotics in their work on the theory of 
communication. Indeed, we will share their criticism of the code model, and we will 
not dwell much on semiotics either in the rest of this book. Yet our choice should not 
necessarily be interpreted as evidence that we wholeheartedly espouse their peremp￾tory judgment about semiotics; in fact, in assessing the semiotic enterprise, it is 
important to keep in mind that semiotics is not purported to be as much a theory of 
communication as predominantly a theory of signs. Undeniably, signs are used in 
communication. Semiotics must therefore deal with the latter. But the fact that semi￾oticians like Vygotsky may have adopted the paradigm of the code model could 
reasonably be considered frst and foremost as yet more evidence of the pervasive￾ness of such a model, rather than an intrinsic faw in the semiotic approach. The 
potential faws of the semiotic approach should be diagnosed in logic and linguis￾tics, where its explanatory power pertains. There are indeed good reasons to do this, 
but they lie outside the scope of our investigation and therefore will not be discussed.
Where semiotics arguably fall short of the goals of our investigation is in its 
explanatory structure. Hopefully, the brief sketches drawn in this chapter are enough 
to show that for a theory of communication, and even more so for a theory of cogni￾tion, the notion of sign is not as much an explanans as an explanandum. In other 
words, the notion of sign can productively be used, as it was by Peirce and Saussure, 
to frame the problems that a theory of cognition and a theory of communication 
have to account for; and, once theories of what cognition and communication in fact 
are have been provided, only then can the notion of a sign be understood and applied 
to characterize cognitive abilities and communicative practices. As far as our pur￾poses are concerned, therefore, the problem with the semiotic enterprise is that the 
explanations it provides are not fundamental enough. We aim to provide a more 
basic, unitary, and suffciently powerful framework in which to think not only of 
communicative phenomena but also of their role in confict transformation and 
organizational processes.
Chapter Summary
Semiotics is the science of signs, and the semiotic approach sees languages as sys￾tems of signs. In this chapter, we presented the two original notions of a sign, devel￾oped by Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce, that gave rise to the 
semiotic tradition. Saussure conceived a sign as a bifacial entity associating an 
acoustic image (the signifer) with a concept (the signifed). According to Peirce, 
instead, a sign associates a representamen (the signifer) to and object (the signifed) 
only by means of an interpretant, that is, an understanding of the sense in which the 
former represents the latter. The account of how systems of signs are structured and 
used is an essential part of semiotics. Saussure distinguished between a system of 
signs considered in the abstract, the langue, and the use of such a system, the parole, 
which regards the practical dimension of communication. Signs in a system are 
related with one another in various ways. Saussure himself distinguished between 
Chapter Summary28
syntagmatic and associative relations. The former relate signs that can occur 
together with one another to compose syntagms. The latter relate signs that can be 
substituted with one another in a syntagm. We argued that although semiotics is an 
important part of linguistics, the semiotic approach does not provide a complete 
account of communicative phenomena; specifcally, it does not explain what com￾munication is and how humans come to use signs to do it.

the main ongoing project of a comprehensive chronological edition. His works on 
semiotics have been collected also in Peirce (1931, 1977, 1998). It is recommend￾able to approach this material together with a good monograph on Peirce’s theory of 
signs, as, for example, Short (2007). The bibliography in semiotics is gargantuan.

Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Rules
For the sake of argument, suppose that the code model is right, communication is 
about transmitting information, and language is merely a code, a system of signs. If 
this were the case, then it would be necessary and suffcient for one to know the 
rules that govern the signs in such a system in order to communicate; in fact, if both 
the speaker and listener know the rules of the signs, then in the absence of noise, 
communication should go through and information transmitted from the one to the 
other. Therefore, if language were a system of signs, what would be its rules? 
According to a classical distinction originally traced by Charles Morris, the theory 
of signs has three parts: syntax is the study of the relations between signs, semantics
is the study of the relations between signs and things in the world, and pragmatics
is the study of the relations between signs and their interpreters (Morris, 1938). All 
these semiotic disciplines identify different rules that govern different aspects of 
signs and their use. If language is a code, it must have syntactic, semantic, and prag￾matic rules. In the following sections, we will consider by way of illustration some 
of the basic rules defned by modern theories of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
X-bar Theory
Syntax studies which combinations of expressions are well formed in languages. 
Consider, for example, the following sentences:
(21) Fortunately, no lion escaped.

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-12463-1_332
(22) *Fortunately, escaped no lion.1
In English, (21) is grammatical while (22) is not. This is something that competent 
English speakers know: linguistic competence is a system of knowledge that allows 
one to recognize and produce well-formed sequences of expressions in a given lan￾guage. Syntactic rules make such a system of knowledge explicit in the form of 
a theory.
Are the rules of grammar prescriptive or descriptive? Are they like traffc laws or 
rather like the statistical laws of economy? Do they enforce certain linguistic prac￾tices or describe how things happen to be with the use of language? Noam Chomsky 
(1959, 1965) prominently argued that it is neither of them. His argument is known 
as the “poverty of the stimulus” argument (Chomsky, 1980). It begins by acknowl￾edging as factual that children are able to learn the syntactic rules of their native 
languages long before they are presented with the explicit formulation of these rules 
at school. How can this be explained? Children could not learn these rules simply 
by being exposed to the stimulus of correct linguistic utterances, because the data 
they could obtain in this way would be insuffcient for them to draw inductive con￾clusions to determine the rules that they correctly apply, even to sentences they have 
never encountered before. According to Chomsky then, the best explanation for the 
acquisition of linguistic competence by human beings is that such knowledge must 
simply be, in some way, innate: a fnite set of structural principles is common to 
every possible language, and a fnite set of parameters that are determined by lin￾guistic stimula explain the syntactic variability of different languages (Chomsky, 
1981).2
 If this is the case, then the purpose of syntax would be to identify the prin￾ciples and parameters of the Universal Grammar that constitute the implicit and 
spontaneous linguistic competence of the speakers of every natural language. By 
applying these principles and parameters, it should be possible to generate all and 
only the well-formed sentences of any given natural language. The hypothesis of the 
existence of a Universal Grammar is obviously a very strong and controversial one. 
It is indisputable, however, that the generativist approach gave an essential contribu￾tion to the investigation of the syntactic rules governing natural languages. We will 
not dwell here on the plausibility of the Chomskyan approach.3
 We only register its 
infuence in linguistics and take into account some of its results to illustrate what 
syntactic rules consists in.
1 In linguistics, an asterisk (or a star) at the beginning of a phrase or form that is provided as an 
example indicates that the form is not found in natural language, because it is syntactically, seman￾tically, or pragmatically problematic or ungrammatical.
2 It might be useful to anticipate here, by way of illustration, one of the principles individuated by 
generativist linguistics; this is the fact that the basic articulation of any phrase structure consists in 
a main element, the so-called head of the phrase, and a complement. This is a general rule consid￾ered to be valid for all natural languages. However, the relative position of the head with respect to 
the complement may vary from one language to another: for instance, the structure of English 
syntagms is head-frst, while in Japanese it is head-fnal. In this sense, the order of the head and 
complement is considered a parameter.
3See, for example, Tomasello (2008, pp. 309–314).
3 Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Rules33
The frst step in syntactic analysis is to group words into categories of expres￾sions that can occupy the same position in a sentence: for example, nouns, verbs, 
prepositions, and adverbs. There are two sorts of categories: lexical categories, con￾stituted by single expressions, and phrasal or syntagmatic categories, composed by 
constituent parts of a sentence that together function as a unit (a phrase) with respect 
to the rules of syntax. The rules of syntax establish how phrases are composed from 
less complex constituents. Chomsky (1957) thought of syntactic rules as rewrite 
rules. Let us consider a few examples:
Syntactic rules:
(a) S → NP VP
(b) NP → Np
(c) NP → Det Nc
(d) VP → Vi
(e) VP → Vt NP
Lexical insertion rules:
(f) Np → {Joan, Mary, Bob, …}
(g) Nc → {woman, book, ballad, …}
(h) Det → {the, a, every, some, many, …}
(i) Vi → {run, talk, spin, …}
(j) Vt → {love, look, sing, …}
Here, syntactical rules tell us how to decompose or reduce complex phrases into 
simpler ones. Hence, (a) says a sentence can be rewritten as a noun phrase followed 
by a verb phrase, (b) says a noun phrase can be rewritten as a proper name, (c) says 
it can be rewritten as a determinant followed by a noun phrase, (d) says a verb 
phrase can be rewritten as an intransitive verb, and (e) says it can be rewritten as a 
transitive verb followed by a noun phrase. Lexical insertion rules assign the expres￾sions of a language to their lexical category. Rules like these allow the articulation 
of the syntagmatic structure of the sentences of a language. These rules also high￾light the fact that each phrase is articulated around a central element: for example, 
noun phrases around nouns and verb phrases around verbs. Such a central element 
is called the head of the phrase. The head of a phrase defnes its category. A useful 
way to highlight syntagmatic structures is to depict them by means of diagrams 
called syntactic trees. Consider the following example (Fig. 3.1):
(23) Joan sings many ballads.
It is easy to verify that the syntactic tree for sentence (23) is constructed by 
applying the rules (a)–(j) above.
Chomsky (1970) originally conceived the X-Bar Theory as a generalization of 
the way phrases are structured and thus of syntactic rules; in fact, according to the 
theory, every phrase has the same structure regardless of the category it belongs to. 
Consider sentence (23) again. The VP is composed by a transitive verb and a noun 
phrase just like rule (e) specifes. The verb is the head of the phrase, and the NP 
occupies the position of the complement of the head. The complement completes

the head not only semantically but also syntactically: the head could not stand with￾out it in a correct phrase. The VP in (23) is clearly a very simple one. Let us consider 
a slightly more complex one:
(24) Joan often sings many ballads in the evening.
First, notice that the VP in (24) contains an adverb. Certain adverbs like “often” 
typically have the function of specifying or qualifying the nature of the action 
expressed by the verb: they play the role of a specifer of the head. Second, the VP 
in (24) contains a prepositional phrase, “in the evening”. Prepositional phrases can 
be added to give more information: they play the role of adjuncts of the head. Both 
specifers and adjuncts are optional. To the contrary of specifers, however, several 
adjuncts can be added recursively.4
 The positions of the head, the complements, the 
specifer, and the adjunct in the VP of (24) can be represented in a syntactic tree as 
shown in Fig. 3.2.
The apexes or bars indicate the level of construction of the phrase according to 
the following rules:
(A) V″ → Spec V′
(B) V′ → V Comp
(C) V′ → V Adj
4Notice that certain adverb iterations do not affect grammaticality, as, for example:
Joan probably often sings many ballads in the evening.
Besides, some adverbs can occur in different positions in a sentence, as, for example:
Usually, Joan sings many ballads in the evening;
Joan sings many ballads gracefully in the evening.
Not all adverbs can occur in every position, and not all adverbs can iterate in any order. With the 
understanding that specifers are not recursive, the question arises as to whether in syntactic struc￾tures adverbs are originally realized in the specifer position or in the adjunct position; in effect, 
there is a large body of literature concerning this problem. Those who argue that adverbs are real￾ized in the specifer position have to explain these phenomena by postulating complex syntactic 
transformations resulting in the surface grammar of sentences like those considered here. See, for 
example, Jackendoff (1972).

But are the rules (A)–(C) peculiar only to the VPs? This time, let us consider the

of the simplest NPs. The NP “many ballads” is already more complex: it is com￾posed of a determinant that specifes a common noun. In this sense, determinants 
occupy the position of the specifer. Notice that nouns can have complements as 
well; for instance, the NP “the ballad of Sacco and Vanzetti” is composed of the 
determinant “the”, the common noun “ballad” and the prepositional phrase “of 
Sacco and Vanzetti” occupying a complement position. Naturally, NPs can have 
many sorts of adjuncts as well that can be added to provide more information. Thus, 
the structure of NPs can also be articulated into the positions of head, specifer, 
complement, and adjunct (Fig. 3.3):
(25) Joan sings the sad ballad of Sacco and Vanzetti.
It is easy to see how rules for the syntactic structure of NPs could easily be 
defned by adapting (i)–(iii).
In fact, according to the X-Bar theory the structure of any major type of phrase 
can be defned by rules of this sort (Jackendoff, 1977). More precisely, if you let X 
X-bar Theory36
be any syntactic category, then every major phrase has the same structure con￾structed according to the same rules as depicted in Table 3.1.
5
X-Bar theory takes its name from the way these rules are formulated, by appos￾ing bars to the X at the different levels of the structure of the phrase. To vindicate 
the generality of these rules, there is at least one more step to take. In order to see 
why, it is enough to ask the following question: How could the structure of a sen￾tence be constructed by following rules in Table 3.1? And, naturally, the problem 
with this question seems to be related to another one: What is the head of a sentence 
phrase? None of the lexical categories considered so far seems apt to play such a 
role. To answer this question then, it is necessary to introduce a further distinction 
between lexical categories and functional categories. While lexical categories carry 
descriptive information, functional categories carry grammatical information. 
Nouns and verbs are examples of lexical categories; determiners, prepositions, aux￾iliaries and conjunctions are examples of functional categories. Functional catego￾ries are needed for linguistic expressions to be grammatically well-formed, but 
sometimes they are not expressed by autonomous morphemes. Consider for instance 
the “-s” in “sings”: it expresses the third person singular of the present tense in the 
indicative mood. Now, tense is just a functional category that allows a sentence to 
be grammatical. Tense, according to X-Bar theory, is the head of a sentence; there￾fore, a sentence phrase is constructed by applying the rules in Table 3.1 to a tense 
head (Fig. 3.4).
(23) Joan sings many ballads.
X-Bar theory is an attempt to give a unitary analysis of the rules that govern the 
syntax of natural languages. Of course, the brief remarks of this section only pro￾vide a presentation of a minimal part of the theory. Overall, they are purported to 
illustrate what syntactic rules amount to. The main point here is that if the code 
model were true, then communicators should know rules like those in Table 3.1, and 
applying them in the codifcation and decodifcation of information through natural 
languages would be part of what communication consists in.
5Notice that rule (C) is recursive, because in fact adjuncts can be added recursively to the phrase.

Truth-Conditional Semantics
While in Morris’ analysis syntactic rules establish relations of signs with one 
another, semantic rules establish relations between signs and things in the world. 
Semantics deals with the meaning of linguistic expressions. It is important to clearly 
understand in what sense the meaning of a sign should be expressed in terms of its 
relations with things in the world. Consider a very simple sentence:
(26) Snow is white
Everyone who understands (26) and is informed about the color of snow knows 
whether it is true or not. This is a remarkable fact about linguistic meaning that the 
Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein distilled in a famous paragraph of his 
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein, 1922):
To understand a proposition means to know what is the case if it is true (4.024)
But what sort of knowledge is this? Wittgenstein’s Tractatus is a milestone in a tra￾ditional approach to semantics, according to which sentences have meanings 
because they are in effect representations of states of affairs, so that understanding 
a proposition is to know what state of affairs it represents. Now, Wittgenstein defned 
the world as a collection of states of affairs. Clearly, the world does not contain all 
possible states of affairs: some of them do not obtain. Every sentence is a represen￾tation of a state of affairs: if the state of affairs represented by the sentence obtains 
in the world, then the sentence is true, otherwise it is false; for instance, sentence 
(26) is true because the state of affairs that snow is white is in the world. Notice that 
Wittgenstein’s dictum does not say that one must know whether a sentence is actu￾ally true or false in order to understand it. To the contrary, one is said to understand 
a sentence to the extent that one knows how the world should look like for the state 
of affairs represented by the sentence to be part of it.
The idea of truth as a correspondence between sentences and states of affairs in 
the world underlies the representationalist approach that is standard in semantics. 
According to this approach, in fact, defning the meaning of a sentence amounts to 
defning its truth conditions. The formal theory for semantic analysis is based on the 
representationalist theory of truth developed by the Polish logician Alfred Tarski. 
Truth-Conditional Semantics38
He originally proposed a formal defnition of the predicate “is true” for logical lan￾guages taking two preliminary steps (Tarski, 1933). First, he distinguished between 
the object language, the language for which the defnition is given, and the metalan￾guage, the language in which the defnition is formulated; for instance, if a defni￾tion of the Italian truth predicate “è vero” is given in English, then Italian will be the 
object language and English the metalanguage. Second, he put forth a condition for 
the material adequacy of any such formal defnition, a condition also known as 
Convention T (“T” for truth, obviously): from a formally correct defnition of the 
truth predicate for a certain object language, it must be possible to derive all the 
sentences of the form:
(T) φ is true if and only if p 
where “φ” is substituted with a name for every sentence of the object language 
and “p” is substituted with the translation of that sentence in the metalanguage. Any 
defnition that meets this condition will provide the truth conditions for all the sen￾tences of the object language. In order to see why, let us consider an example and 
construct the T-sentence just for (26):
“Snow is white” is true if and only if snow is white.
This sounds trivial but it is not. To begin with, notice that it contains a name for 
(26) on the left of the biconditional: in fact, the quotation device allows the con￾struction in the metalanguage of names for expressions in the object language. 
Notice also that in this case English plays the role of both the object language and 
the metalanguage. This is likely the main reason why the T-sentence appears to be 
trivial, but the distinction between the roles of object language and metalanguage 
must always be considered.6
 The most important point to observe is that on the right 
6 In fact, as Tarski proved, the attempt to defne the truth predicate for a given language in that very 
same language generates paradoxes. Consider, for instance, the following English sentence, which, 
like the classical Liar Paradox, contains a reference to itself:
(LIAR) (LIAR) is not true.
Now, suppose a truth defnition is given in English without taking care of the distinction between 
the object language and the metalanguage. The T-sentence for (LIAR) would be as follows:
(LIAR) is true if and only if (LIAR) is not true.
This is clearly a contradiction. According to Tarski, the way out of this paradox was to keep in 
mind that if the object language and the metalanguage are distinct, then their respective truth predi￾cates—say, is trueOL and trueML—should be distinct as well:
(LIAR) is trueML if and only if (LIAR) is not trueOL.
In particular, the object language should not be able to express the truth predicate of the metalan￾guage. The problem with this solution is that one might think the expressive power of natural lan￾guages should not be limited in principle. Specifcally, one might think the truth predicate of a 
natural language is supposed to be universally applicable, that truths are not language dependent, 
and that there should be only one truth predicate. That would be enough the restate the contradic￾tion. Thus, Tarski argues that if this is the case, then his truth defnition should not be applied to 
natural languages.
3 Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Rules39
of the biconditional, a T-sentence expresses in the metalanguage the truth conditions 
of the sentence of the object language named on the left; in this case, in effect, (26) 
is true if and only if it is the case that snow is white. According to the representa￾tionalist approach in semantics, that is simply what one must know to understand 
the meaning of (26).
But how can we know what the truth conditions are for any sentence of a given 
language? The purpose of Tarski’s defnition is precisely to provide an answer to 
this question. In his analysis, however, Tarski only addressed the formal languages 
of logical theories and explicitly refrained from providing a full semantic analysis 
of natural languages, a task that was later carried out especially by the philosophers 
Richard Montague and Donald Davidson. We will not dwell here on the details of 
Tarski’s formalism, but, instead, we will try to present the role that the notion of 
reference plays in the general enterprise of representational semantics for natural 
languages; in fact, the notion of reference is the cornerstone, so to speak, that carries 
the burden of representational semantics. It was explained above that in the repre￾sentationalist approach a sentence is a representation of a state of affairs. To estab￾lish a relation of representation between a sentence and a state of affairs, it is 
necessary for the former to be appropriately correlated to the latter. Think about the 
correlation between a picture and the scene that it represents. A picture represents a 
scene because the elements of the picture correspond to the elements of the scene; 
however, this is not enough. For the picture to represent the scene, it is also neces￾sary that the disposition of the elements of the picture corresponds to the disposition 
of the elements in the scene. In a similar way, a sentence can represent a state of 
affairs if elements of the sentence disposed in a certain way are correlated to cor￾responding elements of the state of affairs disposed in a corresponding way.
The notion of reference provides semantics with the relation required to correlate 
linguistic expressions with things in the world. Proper names, for instance, refer to 
individuals: for example, “Joan” refers to Joan, “Mary” refers to Mary, and “Bob” 
refers to Bob. Verbs are more problematic: What sort of things do verbs refer to in 
the world? One might think of actions, but are actions things in the world or rather 
individuals doing something? Tarski’s solution is to consider the reference of a 
predicate just as the set of individuals in the world that satisfy it: for example, “run” 
refers to the set of the individuals who run, “talk” refers to the set of individuals who 
talk, “spin” refers to the set of individuals who spin, and “love” refers to the set of 
couples of individuals who love one another.
Reference is thus a relation that correlates expressions with things in the world. 
Yet, as previously explained, for a sentence to represent a state of affairs it is neces￾sary not only that its component expressions refer to things in the world but also that 
expressions and things are related in a corresponding way. What are the conditions 
for that to be the case? Consider (26) again. Let “snow” refer to the snow and “is 
white” refer to the class of white things. When is it the case that snow and white 
things are related in such a way that the sentence “snow is white” represents it? 
Naturally, when snow belongs to the class of white things, that is to say when snow 
is white. In general, then, a sentence like “Snow is white” is true if the individual 
denoted by the subject belongs to the set denoted by the predicate.
Truth-Conditional Semantics40

Terms Predicates Sentences
⟦Joan⟧ = Joan
⟦Noam⟧ = Noam
⟦Bob⟧ = Bob

⟦spin⟧ = { x : x spins}
⟦love⟧ = {⟨x, y⟩ : x loves y}
...
S is true if and only if ⟦N′′⟧∈⟦T′⟧
At this point, it is worth introducing a technical notation often used in semantic 
analysis to indicate the interpretation of linguistic expressions: for any expression 
X, let⟦X⟧be the referent of X in the world. This notation is useful to sum up the last 
few remarks in a set of semantic rules.
As was the case for syntax, the rules in Table 3.2 are also for semantics but only 
a tiny illustrative sample of what the semantic analysis of natural languages require. 
Obviously, to accomplish the task of providing a full representational syntax for a 
natural language, the meaning of any expression of any syntactic category must be 
accounted for by explaining in what sense it contributes to the truth conditions of 
the sentences in which they may occur. When it comes to functional categories, the 
task becomes a tricky one; thus, semantic rules will prove to be much more compli￾cated than those displayed in Table 3.2. Again, however, the point here is that if the 
code model were right, then communicators would share rules of this sort in order 
to codify and decodify the information that they want to communicate through 
language.
Speech Acts
Morris established that pragmatics is the study of the relations between signs and 
their users; thus, pragmatic rules should govern the way communicators use the 
signs of language. It might seem as if syntax and semantics were enough to account 
for how information can be codifed in a linguistic system of signs: after all, syntac￾tic rules establish how linguistic expressions should be formed and semantic rules 
establish what representational content well-formed expressions have. However, 
speakers do not use language just to codify representational contents; in fact, they 
do not always use sentences to make statements but also to ask questions, give 
orders, make promises and many other things. Assertions, questions, orders, prom￾ises, and so on are all speech acts: actions that can be done with words. The modern 
theory of speech acts can be traced back to the works of the Oxford philosopher 
John Austin and his scholar John Searle.7
 Naturally, the existence of speech acts was 
regularly acknowledged by linguists and philosophers long before Austin’s concern 
with pragmatics. Austin’s approach, however, allowed him to keep together in a 
7See, respectively, Austin (1962) and Searle (1969).
3 Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Rules41
general analysis both the social conditions and the effects of the actions made by 
uttering sentences and the linguistic properties of the sentences used to make such 
utterances.
Austin famously began his analysis by focusing on performative utterances, such 
as the following:
(27) I christen this ship Luna Rossa.
(28) I bet you sixpence that it will rain tomorrow.
These utterances are made by using declarative sentences: more precisely, sentences 
with verbs in the frst singular person, in the present tense, and in the indicative 
mood. However, when they are uttered in the appropriate circumstances, they do not 
represent states of affairs but rather realize states of affairs. For instance, if during 
the inauguration ceremony of a ship the godmother utters (27), she is christening the 
ship, not merely describing herself doing it. Notice that only the godmother of the 
inauguration can christen the ship and only during the ceremony: were (27) uttered 
by anyone else in any other situation, the baptism would not be realized. It is impor￾tant to stress that performatives are sentences rather than acts. On the one hand, acts 
can sometimes be performed without performative sentences: for example, a police￾man on duty can order a suspect to stop by simply uttering, “Freeze!”, and you can 
ask me the time by uttering, “What time is it?”. On the other hand, performatives 
can be uttered without accomplishing acts: for example, a student cannot order the 
professor to give them good marks by simply uttering, “I order you to give me good 
marks”, and a priest cannot join a couple in marriage by uttering, “I pronounce you 
husband and wife” outside the ritual. It is also crucial to notice that the sense in 
which utterances can go wrong is different from the sense in which sentences can. 
A sentence is wrong if it is false: it represents a state of affairs that is not in the 
world. The utterance of a performative is wrong if it is inappropriate, that is, uttered 
in the wrong circumstances; in fact, performative utterances do not have truth con￾ditions but felicity conditions.
The reason why performatives could go wrong has to do not with their semantic 
meaning but with their pragmatic force. The force of a sentence’s utterance is the 
way the sentence is used in the utterance and determines the act the utterance must 
be taken to perform. The force of an utterance might be assertoric, imperative, inter￾rogative, and so on. The key insight of Austin’s analysis is that performatives are a 
special sort of utterance because they make explicit their pragmatic force; for 
instance, one can perform an imperative act by uttering “Get out!” with an impera￾tive force, or one can perform the same imperative act by making explicit the imper￾ative force by means of the performative “I order you to get out”. The notion of 
force provides Austin’s analysis with the materials to develop a theory of the acts 
that can be performed with language.
Austin proposed distinguishing between three sorts of things that are done by 
uttering a sentence. First, there is the locutionary act of saying something. Saying 
something in turn has three aspects: phonation (or “phonetic” act), the emission of 
Speech Acts42
sounds; enunciation (or “phatic” act), the utterance of well-formed linguistic expres￾sions; and signifcation (or “rhetic” act), the utterance of linguistic expressions with 
a semantic content. Second, there is the illocutionary act of doing something by 
saying something. The illocutionary act is the specifc act that is performed with an 
utterance: asserting, asking, ordering, and so on. The force of the utterance is 
responsible for the determination of the illocutionary act: in fact, it is also called 
illocutionary force. Third, there is the perlocutionary act of achieving certain effects 
on the audience by performing a speech act: for example, frightening, convincing, 
and insulting. These three sorts of act are all performed together by making utter￾ances (although perlocutionary acts might be optional and ultimately dependent on 
the reactions of the audience): these are all things speakers do when they say 
something.
Searle elaborated on Austin’s theory of speech acts by focusing particularly on 
illocutionary acts. He construed felicity conditions as suffcient and necessary 
requirements for the possibility of performing specifc acts. He especially distin￾guished between four categories of conditions: conditions that specify the proposi￾tional content of the utterance, preparatory conditions for the act, sincerity
conditions on the intentions of the agent, and the essential condition that character￾izes the act as having a certain illocutionary force. He then proposed a classifcation 
of different illocutionary acts based on the differences between these conditions. It 
is worth considering here in Table 3.3 at least some examples of Searle’s analysis to 
illustrate what a pragmatic rule could look like (Searle, 1969, pp. 66–67). Here, “S” 
stands for the speaker, “H” for the hearer, “A” for the act, and “p” for the proposition 
expressed in the act.
According to Searle (1976), there are fve fundamental sorts of illocutionary 
acts: assertives, through which the speaker commits to the truth of the expressed 
proposition; directives, which are an attempt on the speaker’s part to get the hearer 
to do something8
; commissives, through which the speakers commits to doing some￾thing in the future; expressives, which express a psychological state; and declara￾tions, which bring about states of affairs in the world that are represented by the 
expressed proposition.
All the different acts belonging to the different categories are characterized by a 
set of rules corresponding to those in Table 3.3. These rules establish the conditions 
for the acts to be performed. In particular, the satisfaction of the essential conditions 
guarantee that the act is interpreted as an act of the right sort. If the code model is 
right, communicators should know pragmatic rules of this sort to decode the prag￾matic force of one another’s speech act and understand what they are doing by utter￾ing their sentences.
8According to Searle, questions appropriately belong to directives because they are performed by 
a speaker in order to get an answer from the audience.

Chapter Summary
As seen in the previous chapter, the code model assumes that languages are codes 
and that communication consists in the transmission of information. This chapter 
explores these assumptions. If language were a code, it would consist of a collection 
of rules for converting information into signals. Traditionally, linguists used to say 
that natural languages have three main kinds of rules: syntactic rules, establishing 
how linguistic expressions are in relation with one another; semantic rules, estab￾lishing how linguistic expressions are in relation with things in the world; and prag￾matic rules, establishing how linguistic expressions are used. Among the best 
analyses of these kinds of rules that we have at our disposal, there are, respectively, 
X-Bar theory, which provides a unitary description of the structure of any type of 
phrase, truth-conditional semantics, which account for the meaning of linguistic 
expressions in terms of their contribution to the representational content of the sen￾tences in which they occur, and speech act theory, which offers an initial character￾ization of the different uses that can be made of linguistic expressions in our 
communicative practices to perform different actions. According to Noam Chomsky 
and Ray Jackendoff’s X-Bar theory, every syntagm is constructed around a central 
element, the head, that also determines the category of the syntagm. The other com￾ponents of the syntagm are phrases that can only play three roles corresponding to 
three levels in the structure of the syntagm: they can be complements of the head, 
which complete the frst level of the structure; adjuncts, which recursively project 
the frst level; and specifers, which close the highest level of the structure of the 
syntagm. The standard approach in semantics, originally developed by Alfred 
Tarski, is grounded in the idea that for linguistic expressions to have meaning is for 
them to represent the world. As Ludwig Wittgenstein put it, knowing what a sen￾tence means is knowing what state of affairs it represents. A sentence is said to be 
true when it represents the world correctly, that is, when the state of affairs that it 
represents is part of the world. Therefore, knowing what a sentence means is know￾ing the conditions for it to be true. The frst contemporary investigations in 
Chapter Summary44
pragmatics by John Austin and John Searle focused on the analysis of different 
speech acts and tried to defne the conditions for their felicitous performance. While 
these theories are still fundamental in the analysis of language, we also noticed that 
recent advances in philosophy and linguistics have questioned the plausibility of a 
rigid distinction between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

Further Introductory Reading
There are plenty of good introductions to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. For the 
basics of the generativist approach to syntax, see Radford (1988), Sag et al. (2003), 
Poole (2011), or Carnie (2012). As far as semantics is concerned, Chierchia and 
McConell-Ginet (1990), Cann (1993), Heim & Kratzer (1998), and Kearns (2011) 
all offer very accurate and complete, introductory presentations of the main topics 
and formal techniques. Pragmatics is more multifaceted: Ariel (2010) provides a 
useful survey of the main problems in the feld. Levinson (1983), Chapman (2012), 
and Birner (2012) are excellent textbooks for a frst general introduction to pragmat￾ics: they will remain a point of reference for the rest of this frst part of the book. As 
far as the topics of this chapter are concerned, in particular, see Levinson (1983, chs. 
1 and 5), Chapman (2012, chs. 1, 3 and 4), and Birner (2012, chs. 1 and 6).
Further Advanced Reading
A useful way to approach the scientifc study of language from a philosophical point 
of view is by reading some classics that have contributed to shape the current feld 
of research. As far as syntax is concerned, clearly Chomsky’s work is of the utmost 
importance: especially Chomsky (1957, 1981) for historical reasons, but also the 
relatively more recent Chomsky (1995), where he defnes his minimalist program. 
The truth-conditional approach in semantics has its roots in the philosophical refec￾tion on language carried on in the analytic tradition: Frege (1892, 1918), Wittgenstein 
(1922), Tarski (1933, 1944), and Davidson (1984) are among the most essential 
milestones in this regard. For an overview on the development of the feld see, for 
3 Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Rules45
example, Portner and Partee (2002). The original works in speech act theory are 
contained in Austin (1962) and Searle (1969). After that, pragmatics has expanded 
and diversifed in various directions: for an overview, see Horn & Ward (2004). 
Archer and Grundy (2011) offer a collection of classics in pragmatics covering most 
of them; some of the essays contained in this collection will also be discussed in the 
following chapters. For a more recent overview on speech act theory in particular, 
see Turner and Sbisà (2013).

Chapter Summary47
Chapter 4
The Limits of the Code Model
In the previous chapter, some basics in the modern theories of syntax, semantics, 
and pragmatics were presented. It is important to stress that none of these theo￾ries per se is explicitly framed in the code model. Some of the authors that have 
been quoted even took a stand against it. The point, however, is that these theo￾ries provide the best explanations that we have for the phenomena that the code 
model aims to account for by taking languages to be systems of signs. From the 
point of view of the code model, what syntax, semantics, and pragmatics do is 
study the rules of these systems: if these theories are right, then languages must 
be governed by rules like those defned in Chap. 3 for syntax, semantics, and 
pragmatics.
If this is correct, then it is possible to construct an argument against the code 
model. It has the form of a reductio ad absurdum, and it goes as follows:
(a) Suppose the code model is right.
(b) For the code model to be right, it is necessary and suffcient for communicators 
to know syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules.
(c) But in some cases, speakers can communicate without applying those rules and 
in others they cannot communicate even by applying those rules.
(d) Therefore, the code model is wrong after all.
The strength of this argument clearly depends on the truth of (c). We thus now 
proceed to show that in effect human communication cannot be explained solely 
in terms of the knowledge of rules for the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic 
interpretation of signs. In this section, the explanatory power of the code model 
will be tested against certain linguistic and communicative facts. The purpose 
will be to establish whether the code model is able to explain them; if it cannot, 
we will try to strengthen it with additional resources and see how far it can 
advance.

Contextual Information
Let us begin by considering Mary and Joan, two speakers engaged in communica￾tion, and let us suppose that they share a linguistic code. In other words, let us sup￾pose that they both know a set of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules, along the 
lines discussed above. Let us further assume that the code model is right and there￾fore that what Mary and Joan do while communicating is transfer information from 
one to the other by codifying such information in the English language.
Saturation
Suppose Mary says to Joan,
(29) I am here now.
There are no doubts whatsoever that Mary’s utterance of (29) is a proper commu￾nicative act. People could use it to communicate, and, therefore, the code model 
should account for it. According to the code model, Mary is trying to transfer 
certain information to Joan by using a linguistic message codifed in (29). How can 
Joan decodify the message to obtain such information? Clearly, she will apply the 
rules of language. She will realize that (29) is an assertoric act (maybe with the 
perlocutionary effect of reassuring her), performed with a syntactically correct 
sign which represents a certain state of affairs that, by applying the semantic rules, 
she can determine roughly as follows: the speaker is where the speaker is at the 
moment when the speaker is speaking. We, competent communicators, obviously 
know that this is not all the information Mary is trying to transfer to Joan: Mary 
means she is there and then with Joan. However, the semantic rules per se do not 
tell who the speaker is, nor where she is, nor when she is speaking. This is infor￾mation that cannot be obtained by the code only: it is information about the con￾text in which the communicative act takes place. Knowledge of the code is 
therefore not enough for Joan to decode Mary’s message: she must also have con￾textual information.
In the case of (29), contextual information is especially required to give an inter￾pretation to the expressions “I”, “here”, and “now”. These peculiar expressions are 
well-known in semantics and are called “indexicals” because their interpretation 
shifts from context to context. The process of using contextual information to pro￾vide an interpretation of indexicals is called saturation of the indexicals. Saturation 
is also required by anaphoric pronouns, whose referent is determined with respect 
to information about the context of the previous exchanges in a conversation.
(30) Mary saw Joan walking down the street. She greeted her with pleasure since 
they had not met for a long time.
To understand the semantic content of “She greeted her with pleasure since they had 
not met for a long time”, the anaphoric pronouns “she”, “her”, and “they” must be 
4 The Limits of the Code Model49
saturated with the information contained in the previous sentence “Mary saw Joan 
waking down the street”. Saturation is sometimes thought to be involved in the 
determination of the content of sentences that do not seem to contain indexical 
expressions (see, e.g., Stanley, 2007). Consider for instance:
(31) It is raining.
To tell whether (31) is true or false, it is necessary to determine where it is raining: 
for example, it is raining in Pisa. This additional information is provided by the 
context and is thought to contribute to the determination of the semantic content of 
a sentence like (31) by saturating a hidden variable, as if the real form of the sen￾tence were, “It is raining [in x]”.
Each time a sentence contains an indexical expression, contextual information is 
required to saturate it in order to obtain a complete truth-conditional meaning for 
the sentence, but the basic code model does not account for this.
Ambiguity
Now suppose Joan says to Mary:
(32) Paul is taking a shot.
Again, the utterance of (32) is a proper act of communication, and, again, the mere 
knowledge of semantic rules is insuffcient for Mary to decode it. In this case, (32) 
does not contain indexicals, but it can be interpreted in at least four ways:
a. Paul is taking a picture.
b. Paul is drinking some liquor.
c. Paul is opening fre.
d. Paul is trying to do something.
The variety of possibilities depends on the ambiguity of the expression “taking a 
shot”. In this case, Mary will need contextual information to decide which interpre￾tation she should give to the ambiguous expressions. Who is Paul? Is he a photogra￾pher, an alcoholic, or a hunter? Where is he? What time is it? and so on. This 
information seems to be required to determine which semantic rule should be 
applied in the interpretation of (32).
Ambiguity does not affect only semantic rules but also syntactic ones. Consider 
the following well-worn example:
(33) Joan saw a man with a telescope.
It is easy to realize that sentence (33) is ambiguous: in the frst reading, it says 
Joan saw a distant man by means of a telescope, and in the second reading it says 
Joan saw a man handling a telescope. This ambiguity does not depend on the 
meaning of some expression in the sentence but in its syntax. Syntactic rules can 
be applied to the analysis of the verb phrase in (33) in two different ways, as 
shown in Fig. 4.1.

Fig. 4.1 Syntactic ambiguity
In (a), the prepositional “with a telescope” is an adjunct to the verb phrase, while 
in (b) it is an adjunct to the noun phrase. Since both structures result from a correct 
application of the syntactic rules, contextual information is required to determine 
which application is the right one.
Semantic and syntactic ambiguity is another common and well-known phenom￾enon. Like indexicality, it concerns specifc expressions and syntactic structures, but 
it is not accounted for in the code model.
Free Enrichment
Suppose Mary says to Joan:
(34) John is tall.
This time, (34) appears to be as unproblematic a sentence as any other; and yet, if 
Joan were to decodify it by using the rules of a linguistic code, she would get into 
trouble. According to representationalist semantics, to understand a sentence is to 
know what is the case if it is true. But how tall must John be for (34) to be true? Is 
there a precise threshold that distinguishes the height of tall and short people? 
Suppose John measures 180 cms in height: Is he tall? Surely, he is taller than the 
average European male; yet, he is short for a basketball player. As a matter of fact, 
“tall” is a relative term, so it seems that Joan needs contextual information to decod￾ify Mary’s message. Such information is required to enrich the semantic content of 
(34) enough to defne its truth conditions. This process is called free enrichment, 
and, again, it is not accounted for in the code model.
4 The Limits of the Code Model51
As we have seen, the necessity for saturation and disambiguation is limited to 
certain peculiar terms. One might think that enrichment is also limited to those 
terms, such as “tall”, whose application is relative to a given standard. But, in fact, 
free enrichment is far more common. Consider the following questions:
What shape is your bedroom?
What color is your hair?
Is there some milk in your fridge?
What is two plus two?
You can obviously answer all of them. Before reading these paragraphs, you could 
do it without any doubts and probably still can. However, to answer these questions, 
you must know to what degree rooms approximate geometrical shapes, what the 
appropriate hair colors are, what the relevant amount of milk is, and what base you 
are using to count.
The phenomena of saturation, ambiguity, and free enrichment show that the code 
model must be extended to account for the way in which communicators use con￾textual information to complete the truth conditions of the signals that are exchanged.
Indirect Speech Acts
We have shown that knowledge of the linguistic code is insuffcient to explain com￾munication and that the ascription of contextual information to the communicators 
is required to explain certain exchanges in terms of the code model. This seems to 
be a legitimate improvement on the model, preserving its theoretical core while 
improving its explanatory power. Let us take a step forward and see if this extension 
is enough.
Let’s assume Mary and Joan are endowed with the contextual information 
required to complete the propositional content of their utterances. As we have seen, 
however, this is not enough yet for them to be able to decodify one another’s signals: 
they still have to apply pragmatic rules in order to understand their speech acts. 
More specifcally, they have to understand the force of their utterances. The case of 
performatives is easy as they make illocutionary force explicit in the verb of their 
main clause. The semantic analysis of performative sentences provides all the infor￾mation required to apply pragmatic rules. Other nonperformative sentences contain 
other illocutionary force indicators. Mood, for instance, is one of these indicators: 
declarative mood indicates assertions, imperative mood indicates orders, and inter￾rogative mood indicates questions. The presence of indicators suggests that sen￾tences have a literal force that they codify. Indicators give the interpreter the 
information required to understand the illocutionary force of a speech act.
Illocutionary acts, however, do not always correspond to the force indicators of 
the sentences used to perform them. In other words, in some cases the speakers utter 
a sentence with certain illocutionary force indicators in order to perform a different 
Indirect Speech Acts52
sort of act. Suppose that Joan and Mary are having lunch; Joan tastes the soup and 
then says to Mary:
(35) Can you reach the salt?
Clearly, (35) shows the indicators of a question, but in fact, it is clearly used by Joan 
to make a request. Cases like these are called indirect speech acts, “cases in which 
one illocutionary act is performed indirectly by way of performing another” (Searle, 
1975). Indirect speech acts pose a serious problem to the code model, because there 
seems to be no obvious way to defne rules that regularly associate violations of the 
literal force of a sentence with the indirect force the sentence is taken to have by the 
audience. Besides, indirect speech acts are extremely common. Just consider how 
easy it is to give alternative ways to rephrase (35):
(i) I would like you to reach the salt.
(ii) I hope you will reach the salt.
(iii) You could reach the salt.
(iv) You can reach the salt now.
(v) Would you kindly reach the salt?
(vi) Won’t you reach the salt?
…
Searle’s solution to the problem of indirect speech acts was to introduce a distinc￾tion between a primary and a secondary illocutionary act. The secondary act is 
explicit: it is the act performed by uttering a sentence with a certain literal illocu￾tionary force. In the case of (35), the secondary act is a question. The primary act is 
implicit: it is inferred by the audience from the inappropriateness of the secondary 
act in the communication exchange and the information that they independently 
have at their disposal.1
 In the case of (35), the primary act is a request. Thus, accord￾ing to Searle’s approach, Mary should infer that Joan’s act is in fact a request by 
reasoning along the following lines:
Joan must know I am able to reach the salt, so she cannot mean that. Instead, she cannot 
reach the salt and so, if she wanted it, she would need someone to reach it for her. In fact, 
she probably wants it, because she just tasted her soup and maybe she found it insipid. 
Therefore, she is requesting me to reach the salt for her.
The code model does not account for the ability of communicators to infer any such 
information from signals.
1As we will see in Chap. 5, Searle here adopts Grice’s inferential approach that in some important 
sense goes beyond the code model.
4 The Limits of the Code Model53
Inferences
Indirect speech acts seem to require communicators to be endowed with inferential 
abilities. But how common is the necessity for the audience to infer information 
from signs and background information? Consider a simplifed version of conversa￾tion (19), already discussed in Chap. 1:
(36) Joan: Will you go trekking tomorrow?
Mary: Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat.
Joan’s utterance can easily be decodifed through the syntactic, semantic, and prag￾matic rules of the language and contextual information: she asks Mary whether she 
will go trekking the next day. Mary declines; we can understand that without ques￾tion. In the code model, however, it is not easy to explain how Mary’s reply qualifes 
as an appropriate answer to Joan’s question. It has no indicator suggesting it is a 
speech act of refusal and its semantic content per se has nothing to do with Joan’s 
proposal.
To understand Mary’s refusal, Joan must use her background knowledge to draw 
inferences from it and from Mary’s utterance; for instance, Joan must know facts 
like the following:
(a) If one is moving to a new fat, then one has no time to do anything time￾consuming that day.
(b) Trekking is time-consuming.
(c) If one has no time to go trekking, one will not go trekking.
She can then infer from (a), (b), (c), and Mary’s utterance that:
(d) Mary will not go trekking tomorrow.
It is only when Joan infers (d) that she gets an adequate answer to her question. 
However, (d) is in no sense codifed in Mary’s utterance; in fact, it is implicit and 
Joan has to infer it on her own. Implicit content can only be arrived at by inference; 
therefore, one must have the ability to draw inferences to be able to engage in com￾munication involving implicit contents.
An inference is a relation between sentences: the premises and the conclusions. 
A good inference guarantees that the truth of the premises is preserved in the con￾clusions. Different kinds of inferences preserve truth in different ways or to a differ￾ent degree. Charles Sanders Peirce classically distinguished between three sorts of 
inferences: deductions, inductions, and abductions. In deductions, the truth of the 
premises is necessarily preserved in the conclusions. Consider the following 
example:
(37) All human children have metarepresentational abilities.
These children are human.
Therefore, these children have metarepresentational abilities.
Inferences54
This inference is valid: there is no possible case in which both premises are true 
while the conclusion is false. Deductive inferences have been well-studied since 
antiquity; in fact, the study of logic began when Aristotle noticed that good deduc￾tive inferences all share certain logical forms. He made explicit the logical form of 
an inference by using variables; for instance, according to Aristotle, the syllogism
(argument) (37) has the following form:
All the As are Bs.
All the Cs are As.
Therefore, all the Cs are Bs.
All the inferences resulting from the substitution of variables with terms in this form 
are valid. In his works on logic and language, the so-called Organon, Aristotle clas￾sifed several forms of good inferences or fgures of syllogisms. His classifcation 
was developed and improved by medieval logicians, who also studied other logical 
forms of valid deductive inferences that had been singled out by the Stoic logicians 
and involved variables for whole propositions rather than mere terms. Among these, 
the following are interesting:
Modus Ponens:
If p then q. If it rains then the streets are wet.
p. It rains.
Therefore, q. Therefore, the streets are wet.
Modus Tollens:
If p then q. If it rains then the streets are wet.
Not q. The streets are not wet.
Therefore, not p. Therefore, it does not rain.
Both modus ponens and modus tollens are valid forms of inference. The follow￾ing, on the contrary, is not:
If p then q. Not p.
Not p.
Therefore, not q.
In fact, not every inference that is obtained by substituting propositions for variables 
in this form is valid.
✓  If a fgure is a triangle, then it has three sides.
 A fgure does not have three sides.
 Therefore, a fgure is not a triangle triangle.
× If it rains, the streets are wet.
 It does not rain.
 Therefore, the streets are not wet
To verify that (×) is not valid, it is enough to consider a counterexample: a possible 
scenario in which both premises are true, while the conclusion is false; for instance, 
a counterexample to (×) would be a scenario in which the streets have been washed 
on a sunny day.
4 The Limits of the Code Model55
Inductive inferences derive generalizations from their instances. Consider the 
following example:
(38) These children are human.
These children have metarepresentational abilities.
Therefore, all human children have metarepresentational abilities.
In classical scientifc method, induction is required to formulate laws. However, 
inductive inferences do not necessarily preserve truth from premises to conclusions: 
if the premises of an inductive inference are true, then the conclusion is merely 
probable. Historically, induction has proven to be much more diffcult to character￾ize in logic than deduction.
Abductions are inferences to the best explanation; for instance:
(39) All human children have metarepresentational abilities.
These children are human.
Therefore, these children have metarepresentational abilities.
Abductive inference is somehow creative and has received less attention from logi￾cians. Nonetheless, we are rather familiar with abduction: every time we formulate 
particular hypotheses to explain something that is occurring, we are in effect draw￾ing abductive inferences; Sherlock Holmes’ so-called deductions are in fact abduc￾tions, just to mention a well-known example.
Overall, deduction, induction, and abduction are types of inference human cog￾nitive subjects can perform quite profciently in their daily tasks. It is not our job to 
investigate these abilities at the present time. Instead, as far as the problem of evalu￾ating the explanatory power of the code model is concerned, it must be acknowl￾edged that the inferential abilities of communicators are mobilized any time implicit 
content has to be retrieved; example (36) illustrates how easy it is for the audience 
to draw inferences from the explicit content of the speaker’s utterances. It is essen￾tial, however, to acknowledge the role that the knowledge of the audience plays as 
premises for such inferences.
Communication involving implicit contents is pervasive in everyone’s social 
experience. The code model, as it is, cannot account for implicit content. It is there￾fore necessary to extend the code model a little further and ascribe to the communi￾cators not only the knowledge of the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules of the 
language, not only knowledge of contextual information but also a set of general 
background knowledge together with the ability to draw inferences from it when 
implicit content is involved.
Mutual Knowledge
We have established that the speakers and the audience must share some background 
information to communicate. But what does it mean for cognitive subjects to share 
information? At frst, one might intuitively try to understand this idea by taking the 
sharing of information to be just knowing the same things. Let us label this way of 
sharing information simply as shared knowledge. Shared knowledge between two 
Mutual Knowledge56
individuals is constituted by all and only the things they both know. If Mary and Joan 
have both read the same newspaper this morning, the news reported by the newspa￾per is part of their shared knowledge. If they both live in the same place, they prob￾ably both know what the weather is like there: this is also part of their shared 
knowledge. However, it is unlikely that they both know the price of apples at the 
grocery store where Mary goes shopping, nor the date of Joan’s dental appointment: 
unless, of course, they tell each other. This is what having the same knowledge is 
about, and it is entirely unproblematic. The question, however, is whether shared 
knowledge is enough for communication. The answer, unfortunately, is that it is not.
As we have seen, the audience must often use their knowledge to interpret or 
decode the speaker’s messages. Let us call K the set of all the knowledge required 
by the audience to decode a certain message m of the speaker: if the audience has K, 
they can decode m and retrieve the information communicated by the speaker. 
Clearly, the speaker too must have K: in fact, knowledge of K is required for the 
speaker to codify the content that they want to communicate. Both the speaker and 
the audience must therefore know K: K must be in their shared knowledge. This, 
however, is not enough. Consider the following example2
:
Mary and Joan want to go to the movies together and have to decide what to see, so they 
check the showtime of the local theater and agree to go and see a romantic comedy at 21.00. 
Later, Mary passes by Joan’s laptop and notices the browser is open on the theater’s web￾site. She also notices that the program has changed and the last Star Wars episode is show￾ing at 21.00 instead of the romantic comedy. Mary is disappointed, because she does not 
like sci-f blockbusters at all. Therefore, as soon as she meets Joan, Mary announces: “I do 
not want to see the movie showing tonight.”
What movie will Joan think Mary is referring to? Will she think Mary has noticed 
the replacement in the theater’s program or that she has just changed her mind? 
According to the extended code model envisaged above, Joan must use contextual 
and background knowledge to identify or to infer the reference of Mary’s question. 
Joan knows the movie showing at the local theater at 21.00 is the last episode of Star 
Wars; besides, Mary knows it as well. Thus, the fact that the movie showing at the 
local theater at 21.00 is the last episode of Star Wars is part of Joan and Mary’s 
shared knowledge. What is critical, however, is that Joan does not know that Mary 
knows what movie is actually showing at the local theater at 21.00. In fact, on the 
one hand, for Mary to be sure that Joan could decode her message, she should have 
known that Joan knew that she knows what movie is actually showing at the local 
theater at 21.00. On the other hand, to decode Joan’s message, Mary should also 
know that Joan knows that she knows what movie is showing. But then, Joan should 
know that Mary knows that she knows that Mary knows what movie is showing, 
and so on.
This example illustrates that shared knowledge is not enough to ensure commu￾nication even in the extended code model. A different notion of sharing information 
2This example is adapted from Clark and Marshall (1981).

A B
Enemy
Fig. 4.2 The two generals’ paradox
between cognitive subjects is required: let us call it mutual knowledge (Schiffer, 
1972, p. 30).3
Two individuals A and B have mutual knowledge of a fact F if and only if they know that F
and they know that they both know that F and they know that they both know that they both 
know that F, and so on ad infnitum.
In the framework of the code model, background information can be used in com￾munication only if it is part of mutual knowledge. If the source does not know that 
the destination knows that they know and so on, then they have no guarantee that 
their message will be correctly decodifed. Conversely, if the destination does not 
know that the source knows that they know and so on, then they have no guarantee 
about what information can be used to decodify the message. As a matter of fact, the 
code model is unable to explain the success of communication relying on contextual 
and background information in the absence of mutual knowledge, just as it cannot 
explain it in the absence of a shared code. Therefore, the explanatory power of the 
code model depends on whether humans can achieve mutual knowledge; unfortu￾nately, this does not seem to be the case.
The following story shows why mutual knowledge is problematic. It is known as 
the two generals’ paradox.
4
The armies of two allied generals, A and B, are stationed on two opposing hills. In the val￾ley between them is the enemy camp. The enemy army outnumbers each of the two allied 
contingents so that the only reasonable possibility for the two generals to win the battle is 
to attack the enemy together at the same time (Fig. 4.2). The two generals must therefore 
coordinate a simultaneous attack, but they can communicate only by sending a messenger. 
The messenger must pass through the enemy camp where he could be captured; as a matter 
of fact, when a general sends a message, he has no guarantee the ally will receive it.
Now, suppose general A sends a messenger to general B saying, “We must attack at 
dawn”. Also, suppose the messenger passes the enemy camp unharmed and delivers 
the message. We thus have the following situation:
3Another name that is sometimes used for the same notion is “common knowledge” (cf. 
Lewis, 1969).
4This is a well-known problem discussed in information theory. See, for example, Akkoyunlu et al. 
(1975), where it is presented as a problem of communication in a group of gangsters.
Mutual Knowledge58
A knows that they must attack at dawn,
B knows that they must attack at dawn,
B knows that A knows that they must attack at dawn.
Yet, A cannot attack because he is not sure that B knows that they must attack at 
dawn. As a consequence B, who is aware of that, cannot attack either. B therefore 
sends back a messenger to A acknowledging “I know that we must attack at dawn”. 
Suppose that again, the messenger reaches A. The situation is now as follows:
A knows they must attack at dawn,
A knows that B knows that they must attack at dawn,
A knows that B knows that A knows that they must attack at dawn,
B knows that they must attack at dawn,
B knows that A knows that they must attack at dawn.
Is that enough? Surely not, because B does not know that A knows that he knows 
that A knows that they must attack at dawn. Therefore, B cannot attack, and neither 
can A. Obviously, A could send yet another messenger to B, but that would just 
propose the problem once again. In fact, as it is easy to realize, the two generals 
should send an infnite number of messengers to one another in order to ensure the 
mutual knowledge required for the coordinated attack.
Mary and Joan clearly do not fare much better than the two generals. To under￾stand each other, they need mutual knowledge about the theater’s showtime, but it 
seems they cannot obtain it beforehand. Of course, they could tell each other what 
they know, but such a communication might itself require mutual knowledge about 
something else. It is important, however, not to be misled by these examples into 
thinking that the problems of mutual knowledge originate from the fact that an inf￾nite series of transmissions of information between two individuals is required for 
them to have complete knowledge of what the other knows. Consider another 
situation:
Joan and Mary are walking down the street and they both notice a Ferrari 
passing by.
In this case, naturally, we would like to take for granted that Mary and Joan could 
use that information to communicate with one another. But do they have mutual 
knowledge of the fact that a Ferrari is passing by? Let us see. Given that both Mary 
and Joan have noticed a Ferrari passing by, they both know that a Ferrari passed by. 
Besides, given that Mary has seen Joan noticing a Ferrari passing by, Mary knows 
that Joan knows that a Ferrari passed by. And similarly, given that Joan has seen 
Mary noticing a Ferrari passing by, Joan knows that Mary knows that a Ferrari 
passed by. But then, by the same token, Mary knows that Joan knows that Mary 
knows that a Ferrari passed by and Joan knows that Mary knows that Joan knows 
that a Ferrari passed by, and so on, ad infnitum. Decidedly, Mary and Joan could 
not entertain such infnite knowledge. Notice that in this case Mary and Joan do not 
have to send messages to each other to generate the regress. In fact, the problem 
with mutual knowledge is not so much the infnite series of communicative acts 
required to ascertain it as it is the infnite series of mental representations that a

cognitive subject should entertain. And if mutual knowledge is required to explain 
how communicators interpret messages, they would have to entertain such infnite 
series of mental representations before a communication exchange could even begin.
It is also important to understand why the vicious regress of mutual knowledge 
is generated. Let Mary and Joan both have knowledge of a fact F. As we have said, 
this is not enough for Mary to be allowed to make an utterance whose interpretation 
requires Joan to know that F: Mary must also know that Joan knows that F. That is 
to say, Mary needs a second-order knowledge about Joan’s frst-order knowledge 
that F. Conversely, Joan is not allowed to use her knowledge that F in the interpreta￾tion of Mary’s utterance if she does not know that Mary knows that she knows that 
F. This would be a third-order knowledge about Mary’s second-order one. The case 
for Joan’s knowledge that F is specular (Fig. 4.3).
This pattern is replicated at every level n: for a communicator to be allowed to 
use the frst-order knowledge of F, they must also have n+1th-order knowledge of an 
nth -order knowledge of the other.
The notion of knowledge is highly demanding from a cognitive point of view. 
According to a venerable, criticized, and yet landmark idea, knowledge is justifed 
true belief5
; for instance, let us assume Mary know where her car is. In order to 
know that, frst of all she must have a belief, a mental representation of the fact that 
her car is in a certain place. If she does not have any such mental representation, 
then she just cannot be said to have knowledge that her car is in a certain place. All 
5This analysis of knowledge can be traced back as far as Plato’s Taetetus, but it is still discussed 
today in contemporary epistemology (the theory of knowledge and belief justifcation). It is con￾sidered to be seriously undermined by an argument put forward by Edmund Gettier (1963) sug￾gesting that in certain cases cognitive subjects with justifed true beliefs are not to be intuitively 
credited with knowledge. Nonetheless, no other substantial account of knowledge has been estab￾lished as an alternative.
Mutual Knowledge60
knowledge is beliefs, but not all beliefs are knowledge. Mary’s belief about her car 
must also be true for it to be knowledge. If someone stole her car and drove it some￾where else, Mary could be said only to believe but not to know that her car is in a 
certain place. Not even true belief, however, is enough for a proper characterization 
of knowledge. In fact, one might have a belief that happens to be true only by 
chance. Suppose Mary left her car in a mall parking lot, but she does not remember 
where. So she rolls a dice, and trusting her good luck, she comes to believe that her 
car is in the lane of the number that comes up; in actual fact, she is incredibly lucky, 
because the car is parked exactly in that lane. However, Mary could not be said to 
know where her car is, because she did not have any real justifcation for her belief.
If this analysis is accepted, then all knowledge must be a justifed, true belief 
actually entertained by a cognitive subject. Now, human beings are cognitive sub￾jects, but their cognitive resources are fnite, and it is extremely implausible that 
they could entertain an infnite number of mental representations all together. For 
these reasons, it is reasonable to conclude that two human beings can never fully 
achieve mutual knowledge. However, despite their cognitive limits, human beings 
do communicate: that is a fact. They must therefore do it without mutual knowl￾edge. The problem for the code model then is that it can explain communication 
only by requiring mutual knowledge. This is why the code model is ultimately inad￾equate for explaining human communication. Together with Sperber and Wilson, 
we take this inadequacy of the explanatory power of the code model to be a conclu￾sive reason to reject it.
Chapter Summary
This chapter contains an argument against the code model of communication. The 
argument has the structure of a reductio ad absurdum: we assume that the code 
model is correct, derive a contradiction from this assumption, and conclude against 
the correctness of the code model itself. In the previous chapter, we saw that if lan￾guages were merely codes, then knowing and applying the rules of syntax, seman￾tics, and pragmatics should be necessary and suffcient to communicate. It is easy to 
see that this is not the case by focusing on the role of the context in communication, 
because the basic rules of language do not consider contextual information in the 
code model. We noticed that contextual information is essential for interpreting 
communicative acts in various ways. At minimum, it is required for the saturation 
of indexicals and the disambiguation of syntactic and semantic ambiguities. It is 
also widely used for free enrichment whenever it is required for the proper interpre￾tation of utterances and for understanding indirect speech acts. Most of all, however, 
contextual information is required for inferring what a speaker may decide to com￾municate implicitly. The code model does not account for implicit communication 
at all, even if implicit communication is arguably the most common form of 
communication.
4 The Limits of the Code Model61
Can the code model accommodate the inferential interpretation of implicit com￾munication and, in general, the use of contextual information? On the one hand, for a 
speaker to send a message that requires contextual information to be interpreted, they 
should be sure that such information is available to their audience. On the other hand, 
for the audience to use the right contextual information to interpret a message, they 
should be sure that such information is available to the speaker. That is to say, the 
speaker and their audience must have mutual knowledge of the contextual informa￾tion in question. However, mutual knowledge consists in an infnite series of metarep￾resentations that cannot be achieved by the fnite cognitive systems of human beings.
This is the contradiction that we were looking for in our argument. To account 
for implicit communication—and therefore, communication in general—the code 
model requires that the speaker and the audience have mutual knowledge. But this 
is impossible. Therefore, the code model of communication is not correct.

Further Advanced Reading
In the last couple of decades, the question whether contextual information is really 
essential to meaning and communication has been at the center of the debate 
between Literalism and Contextualism in linguistics and philosophy of language. 
Forms of Literalism are advocated by minimalist authors like Herman Cappelen and 
Ernie Lepore (2005a, 2005b) and Emma Borg (2004) and indicalists like Jason 
Stanley (2000). François Recanati (2004a, 2010) is the main representative of 
Contextualism; see also Searle (1978) and Travis (1985). Relevance Theory is con￾sidered a contextualist approach as well: we will discuss it extensively in the follow￾ing chapters.
Chapter Summary62
The notion of mutual knowledge has been introduced in philosophy preemi￾nently by Lewis (1969) and Schiffer (1972). For the debate about the role of mutual 
knowledge in communication, see, for example, Bach and Harnish (1979) and Clark 
and Marshall (1981). For the idea of considering the cognitive implausibility of the 
requirement of mutual knowledge as the basis for an argument against the code 
model, see Sperber and Wilson (1986, 1990).

4 The Limits of the Code Model63
Chapter 5
Grice’s Inferential Model
The code model is grounded on a certain idea of what it is for something to have 
meaning. This is the idea that meaning something is just representing something. 
The paradigm of this idea is the concept of the sign: something that stands for some￾thing else (a concept, an object, etc.). Codes are systems of signs that should allow 
meanings to be shared intersubjectively. It is for this reason that they are conceived 
as the key concept of communication in the code model. As explained in the previ￾ous chapter, however, this approach leads to some serious problems. To develop 
alternative models for communication, a different analysis of meaning is needed. In 
this chapter, we explore a different approach by considering the work of another 
Oxford philosopher, Paul Grice.
What a Speaker Means
Grice (1957, 1969) drew two crucial distinctions in his analysis of the notion of 
meaning: on the one hand, the distinction between natural meaning and non-natural
meaning and, on the other hand, the distinction between sentence meaning and 
speaker’s meaning.
Natural Meaning and Non-natural Meaning
The former distinction allows specifying the sort of meaning that is really involved 
in human communication; for instance, consider the following uses of the verb 
“to mean”:
(40) Those spots mean measles.
(41) Dark clouds mean rain.

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-12463-1_564
In sentences like (40) and (41), meaning is a natural relation between a sign and its 
signifcance: the rash is caused by the measles; the dark clouds are rain clouds. A 
natural sign entails its signifcate: if the former is the case, then (in all probability) 
the latter is too. These cases illustrate the natural sort of meaning. This, however, is 
not the sense in which words, for instance, have meaning. Linguistic expressions are 
signs only to the extent that they are used as such. Compare (40) and (41) with the 
following:
(42) The ring of the bell means that the library is about to close.
(43) By saying “alea iacta est” Caesar meant that there was no turning back.
In these cases, the relation between the sign and its signifcate does not depend on 
its properties but on its use: the ring of the bell is used to anticipate the closure of 
the library; Caesar used the utterance of “alea iacta est” (“the die is cast”) to convey 
that after he had crossed the Rubicon with his army, the civil war against Pompey 
was inevitable; in fact, (42) and (43) illustrate non-natural meaning (meaningNN). 
When a sign has non-natural meaning, there is no entailment relation between it and 
its signifcate. So, for instance, there is no contradiction in saying the ring of the bell 
means that the library is about to close, the bell rings, but the library is not about 
to close.1
Sentence Meaning and Speaker Meaning
The second distinction drawn by Grice is between what words literally mean and what 
a speaker intends them to mean when they utter them. The former, sentence meaning, 
is the meaning conventionally associated to linguistic expressions when they are con￾sidered in abstraction from any of their utterances. The latter, speaker meaning, is the 
meaning a speaker intends specifc utterances of linguistic expressions to have on 
specifc occasions. To illustrate the distinction, consider (43) again. The sentence 
meaning of the Latin phrase “alea iacta est” is that the die is cast: this is what it liter￾ally means. This is part of what Caesar meant, but it was not all of it: he also intended 
to say that after crossing the Rubicon, there was no turning back for him.
While sentence meaning is conventional, speaker meaning is utterance-specifc: 
the former depends on the rules of the language, the latter on the intentions of the 
speaker. In fact, Grice argues that it is reasonable to maintain that sentence meaning 
is grounded in speaker meaning. How do certain linguistic expressions come to be 
associated with certain meanings? A sensible answer is that they do because speak￾ers have regularly used those expressions with the intention of conveying those 
1Notice that the difference between natural and non-natural meaning overlaps in many ways 
Peirce’s distinction between indexes and symbols. Grice is not really focused, however, on the 
classifcation of signs, so he does not simply oppose natural signs to conventional ones. To the 
contrary, the conventionality of nonnatural meaning is something that he aims to explain, together 
with the fact that nonnatural meaning is not always conventional.
5 Grice’s Inferential Model65
meanings until the association has been timelessly frozen in the rules of language. 
Grice then does not think sentence meaning can be explained independently of 
speaker meaning, even though he acknowledges that, once the rules of language are 
established, sentence meaning can be understood autonomously by means of decod￾ifcation.2
 The essential point to remark, however, is that in the Gricean model the 
source of the meaningfulness of linguistic expressions is the intentions of the speak￾ers, rather than the rules of linguistic codes. Needless to say, this is a major break￾through with respect to the semantic framework of the code model.
It is now important to understand Grice’s analysis of the notion of speaker mean￾ing. The following is his original proposal:
Shortly, perhaps, we may say that “[S] meantNN something by [p]” is roughly equivalent to 
“[S] uttered [p] with the intention of inducing a belief by means of the recognition of this 
intention”. (Grice, 1957)
The idea here is that the utterance of a sentence p is meaningful to the extent that it 
is performed by a speaker with the intention of meaning something for the audience, 
that is to say, with the intention that the audience associates a certain mental repre￾sentation to p. It is crucial to observe that, in this analysis, it is not the knowledge of 
the rules for the decodifcation of p that allows the audience to form the belief but 
the recognition of the intentions of the speaker. To highlight this point, Grice’s origi￾nal analysis can be rephrased as follows (Strawson, 1964; Grice, 1969):
“S meant something by uttering p” is true if and only if, for some hearer H, S
uttered p intending
(a) H to produce a reaction r,
(b) H to recognize that S intends (a),
(c) H’s fulfllment of (a) to be based on H’s fulfllment of (b).
This defnition ascribes a threefold intention to the speaker. Intention (a) is the 
intention to affect the beliefs and the behavior of the hearer: in the paradigmatic 
case, it can be thought as the intention to inform the hearer.3
 Notice that according 
to the code model, the success of communication consists solely in the fulfllment 
of this intention. To the contrary, in Grice’s analysis, the intention to transmit infor￾mation is not enough to account for the speaker’s intention to communicate: the 
speaker must also intend the hearer to recognize that they have such an intention. 
This is clarifed in the defnition by the presence of intention (b). Notice that (b) is 
a meta-intention, in the sense that it is about another intention, namely intention (a). 
Grice’s idea is that for the speaker to obtain what they want from the hearer by 
2This analysis of the relations between sentence meaning and speaker meaning obviously calls to 
mind the dialectics between langue and parole in the Saussurean semiotics. However, neither 
Saussure nor the tradition originating from his work have actually considered intentions as a key 
concept for the analysis of the parole.
3As a matter of fact, speakers do not always intend the hearer to form beliefs from their utterances. 
If a speaker utters “Shut the door!”, they want the hearer to shut the door. If they utter “I will pick 
you at the airport tomorrow”, they want the hearer to acknowledge their commitment to pick them 
up at the airport the next day, and so on. It is more accurate then to say that with their utterances 
speakers intend the hearer “to produce a particular response” (Grice, 1969).
What a Speaker Means66
uttering p, it is necessary that the hearer recognizes that the speaker wants some￾thing from them. It is only because the hearer recognizes the intention of the speaker 
that they may try to understand what the speaker means beyond the literal meaning 
of their utterance. Otherwise, in fact, the hearer could not even realize that the 
speaker means something at all by uttering p: it is just through the recognition of the 
speaker’s intention that the hearer realizes that the speaker is communicating with 
them. The last intention (c), then, makes explicit the sense in which the speaker 
wants to affect the hearer by communicative means: the speaker wants the hearer to 
produce certain reactions in reason of the recognition of the speaker’s intentions.
The Role of Communicative Intentions
It is worth exploring the different roles these intentions have in communication with 
a few examples. The frst one is adapted from Grice (1957) himself:
You see in the evening a man walking on the street wearing a tailcoat.
People wear tailcoats when they attend fancy social events like gala dinners or balls. 
One could even say it is a rule that men must wear a tailcoat on such occasions so 
that the tailcoat is a sign that the man is going to a fancy social event. Thus, you see 
the man in the tailcoat and you infer he is going to a fancy social event. Yet, the man 
is not communicating to you that he is going to a fancy event. Although the sign of 
the tailcoat has no natural meaning, you interpret it in the same way as you may 
interpret the sign of a skin rash: you experience the presence of the sign, and you 
apply a rule that (naturally or conventionally) associates it to its signifcance. Yet, 
just like the measles, the man has no intention whatsoever toward you. This example 
shows that the unintentional use of signs may provide information, but it does not 
qualify as proper communication. Similarly, if Mary says something to Joan and 
you overhear it, then you can naturally form beliefs and infer information from it, 
but you do it just like you would in the case of the man in the tailcoat: Mary has no 
intention toward you, and, therefore, she is just not communicating with you.
The next example is specifcally purported to highlight the essential role of the 
meta-intention (b).
A detective is investigating a murder. On the crime scene, the detective fnds hair that does 
not belong to the victim. The DNA analysis of such biological evidence allows the detective 
to identify John Smith as the primary suspect of the murder. However, the actual murderer 
intentionally left the hair at the crime scene to make the detective suspect John Smith.
In this case, the use of the hair as a sign is intentional on the murderer’s part: They 
want the detective to believe that Smith committed the crime; and yet, would you 
say that the murderer communicated with the detective? On the one hand, the mur￾derer is clearly successful in transmitting information to the detective; therefore, in 
the framework of the code model, one is forced to accept that there is 
5 Grice’s Inferential Model67
communication between the murderer and the detective. On the other hand, how￾ever, the murderer does not want their intention to be revealed to the detective, 
otherwise the detective would not suspect John Smith; in effect, intention (a) of the 
murderer to make the detective suspect John Smith can be satisfed in this case only 
if it remains hidden. But then, from the detective’s perspective, the presence of the 
hair on the crime scene appears as having natural meaning only. So the detective 
will look just for the information that the hair and what is naturally related to them 
may provide. The intentions of the murderer have no role in the process of interpre￾tation of the sign on the detective’s part; in fact, in the Gricean model, the murderer 
cannot be said to communicate with the detective in this case precisely because they 
have no intention (b).
According to Grice, human communication is characterized by the recognition 
of the speaker’s intention on the audience’s part. The transfer of information is not 
even necessary for successful communication. In other words, there can be com￾munication even if intention (a) fails, as long as intention (b) is satisfed; indeed, this 
is quite a common situation. Suppose, for instance, that Mary says to Joan that the 
earth is fat. Mary’s intention is thus for Joan to believe the earth is fat and to also 
recognize that Mary intends her to believe it. Yet, Joan might simply not believe 
Mary. Joan could therefore recognize that Mary intends on having her believe that 
the earth is fat, while not forming herself the belief that the earth is fat. In that case, 
Joan recognizes Mary’s intention (a) and, even if she does not satisfy it, it is enough 
for Joan’s utterance to count as a successful act of communication.
It has been pointed out that in Grice’s analysis the speaker’s intentions in com￾munication have three interesting properties. First, they must be directed toward the 
audience. This might sound obvious, but, as it will be explained, it is still essential 
for the analysis of the speaker meaning. Second, they must be overt (Strawson, 
1964; Schiffer, 1972) in the sense that the speaker cannot conceal them if the speaker 
wants to communicate: the intentions of the speaker must be publicly available for 
the audience to recognize. Third, they are refexive, meaning they are satisfed if and 
only if they are recognized (Searle, 1969; Bach & Harnish, 1979).
Also worth noticing is that in the Gricean model communication requires that 
both the speaker and the audience have meta-representational abilities. On the one 
hand, to have communicative intentions toward the audience, the speaker must take 
the audience to be able to have mental representations and that they can be infu￾enced. On the other hand, the audience must be able to ascribe intentions to the 
speaker, that is to say, ascribe to the speaker certain attitudes toward certain repre￾sentational contents. In fact, the audience’s recognition of the speaker’s intention 
consists in a mental representation of a mental representation of the speaker (namely, 
the desire to produce a particular response in the audience).
What a Speaker Means68
A Challenge for Grice’s Approach
Let us now consider an example originally put forth by John Searle to highlight a 
problem with the Gricean idea that the success of communication consists in the 
satisfaction of the communicative intentions of the speaker (Searle, 1965):
Suppose during the Second World War an American soldier is captured by the Italian troops. 
His only chance to save himself is to get the Italians to believe he is German. Unfortunately, 
he does not speak any German. The only German he knows is the frst verse of Goethe’s 
poem “Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühen?” (“Do you know the land where the 
lemons bloom?”): therefore, that is what he utters. Luckily for him, the Italians know no 
German either and come to believe he is in effect German.
If this case is analyzed in Grice’s terms, it must be acknowledged that it is the 
American soldier’s intention (a) that the Italians form the belief that he is German, 
and the intention (b) that they recognize his intention as well as the intention (c) that 
they believe that he is German in reason of the recognition of his intention. For 
Grice, therefore, the American’s utterance qualifes as proper communication. The 
problem is that it is not clear how the frst verse of Goethe’s poem has anything to 
do with what he meant: “on Grice’s account—Searle notices—it would seem that 
any sentence can be uttered with any meaning whatever, given that the circum￾stances make possible the appropriate intentions” (ibid., p. 45).
The problem raised by Searle seems to be a serious one. The point is dramati￾cally illustrated by Lewis Carroll in the dialogue between Alice and Humpty 
Dumpty in his novel Through the Looking Glass: 
‘And only one for birthday presents, you know. There’s glory for you!’ ‘I do not know 
what you mean by “glory”,’ Alice said.
Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. ‘Of course you do not—till I tell you. I meant 
“there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!”’
‘But “glory” does not mean “a nice knock-down argument”,’ Alice objected.
‘When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I 
choose it to mean—neither more nor less.’
Clearly, the theory of communication disdainfully endorsed by Humpty Dumpty 
cannot be right: speakers simply cannot make words mean whatever they want. If 
they could, it would not be clear how they could communicate anything at all. In the 
code model, Humpty Dumpty’s anarchy is kept at bay by the rules of the language. 
These rules are shared by the speakers and the audience and establish what utter￾ances mean. In Grice’s account, however, this answer is not available, because sen￾tence meaning is construed as derived from speaker meaning.
Searle’s criticism shows that Grice’s approach must be integrated with a system￾atic theory of speaker meaning. Such a theory should explain at least two things: 
frst, how implicit content is generated and, second, how the varieties of interpreta￾tion can be controlled. The next section deals with the frst of these desiderata. The 
latter, as we will see, is much more complex to satisfy.
5 Grice’s Inferential Model69
Conversational Implicatures
What Is Said and What Is Implicated
Speaker’s meaning has two components: on the one hand, there is what is said
explicitly by the speaker with an utterance and, on the other hand, there is what is 
implicated with it. Once again, the distinction is fairly intuitive. When Caesar 
uttered, “Alea iacta est”, he said that the die is cast and he implicated that after 
crossing the Rubicon there was no turning back for him. Notice that the notion of 
what is said does not correspond to the notion of sentence meaning. According to 
Grice in fact, sentences do not mean anything by themselves, except when someone 
uses them to mean something: sentence meaning is rather the product of a process 
of conventionalization of meaningful uses of linguistic expressions.4
 As we have 
seen, the code model is unable to account for the communication of implicit con￾tent. In the Gricean model, instead, the audience can understand what a speaker 
implicates because the recognition of the speaker’s communicative intention gener￾ates expectations about the behavior of the speaker that may orient the audience’s 
reasoning in reconstructing implicit content in the speaker meaning; in other words, 
what the audience does is trying to explain the manifest communicative behavior of 
the speaker.
Generally speaking, the rational behavior of a cognitive subject is explained by 
attributing beliefs and desires to them. An interpreter who recognizes the goal of a 
rational agent will expect them to behave in a certain way to achieve it. Depending 
on how the agent will actually behave, the interpreter may fgure out what beliefs 
made the agent behave in such a way as to achieve their goal; for instance, to explain 
why you are reading this book, one should probably ascribe to you the desire to 
learn about communication and the belief that by reading this book you will achieve 
that. In other words, one should reason along the following lines:
Why are you reading this book? You want to learn about communication. The best explana￾tion for your behavior is therefore that you believe that you will fnd useful notions about 
communication here. Otherwise it would be irrational for you to be reading this book.
Similarly, in a communication exchange, the audience has to explain why the 
speaker makes certain utterances. The recognition of the speaker’s intentions allows 
the audience to know what the speaker desires: they desire to produce a certain 
response in the audience in reason of the recognition of their intention to do it. Then 
the audience will expect that the speaker will behave so to achieve the speaker’s 
goals. Thus, the audience ascribes to the speaker the beliefs that allow the audience 
to explain why the speaker makes certain utterances. The ascription of these beliefs 
4 It is for this reason that Grice contends that what a speaker says is related to the conventional 
meaning of the linguistic expressions they use (Grice, 1975, p. 44). As we will see in the next 
chapter, however, several authors have insisted that literal meaning is often insuffcient to com￾pletely interpret what a speaker says.
Conversational Implicatures70
to the speaker allows the audience to identify what the speaker implicates. The 
inferential reasoning of the audience is roughly the following one:
Why did the speaker utter p? The speaker has a communicative intention towards me, that 
is to say they wants me to produce certain reactions in reason of the recognition of their 
intention; therefore, the best explanation for the their uttering of p is that they believe q, 
otherwise it would be irrational for them to utter p.
This is how the audience may reason in order to explain the speaker’s communica￾tive behavior. But how does that help the audience’s understanding of what the 
speaker means? What do the speaker’s beliefs have to do with what they mean? The 
answer to these questions can be found by refecting on the fact that the speaker is 
aware that the audience will try to explain their communicative behavior by reason￾ing in such a way. They are aware that the audience will attribute to them the beliefs 
that rationally explain why they made a certain utterance. And the audience knows 
that. Therefore, if the speaker does nothing to prevent the audience attributing 
beliefs to them, the audience is authorized to believe that it is precisely what the 
speaker wants them to do, that is, the speaker wants them to know what the speaker 
believes. Accordingly, the following is how the audience’s reasoning should 
carry on:
The speaker knew I would fgure out they must believe q. Since they did nothing to prevent 
me from doing that, they wanted me to think they believe q.
Now, since the audience recognized the speaker’s intention, they will take this as 
part of the speaker’s strategy to satisfy it. If this is the case, then the speaker’s beliefs 
must be part of what they meant with their utterance. In fact, it is only by under￾standing what the speaker means that the audience could react the way the speaker 
wants them to and thus satisfy the communicative intention. Hence, the audience is 
allowed to draw the following conclusion:
Therefore, q is what the speaker means.
Grice’s analysis of this reasoning will be examined below. In the meanwhile, it 
might be useful to illustrate it by considering once again our familiar example:
(36) Joan: Will you go trekking tomorrow?
Mary: Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat. 
Suppose Joan recognizes Mary’s communicative intentions, so she tries to under￾stand why Mary uttered “Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat” to fulfll them. 
Joan however, also notices that there is something wrong with Mary’s utterance. It 
says that Mary is moving to her new fat the next day, and this is all Joan could come 
to believe by interpreting it according to the rules of language. But that content has 
nothing to do with trekking by itself. So, why would Mary intend her to believe it? 
If Mary wants to communicate with Joan, what is said by her utterance is not enough 
to explain her behavior. Therefore, Joan reasons, Mary must have some other 
beliefs: for instance, she might believe that one cannot relocate and go trekking on 
the same day. If this is what Mary believes, then her communicative behavior begins 
to make sense. From the content of this belief and the explicit content of Mary’s 
5 Grice’s Inferential Model71
utterance, Joan can infer that Mary implicated that she will not go trekking with her 
the next day. If that is what she intended her to believe, then her utterance was 
appropriate after all. Intuitively, this is the sort of reasoning that allows Joan to 
understand what is implicated by Mary’s utterance.
This analysis of the speaker’s meaning provides an answer to Searle’s challenge. 
Recall that his criticism was directed against the fact that according to Grice, speak￾ers might seem allowed to make words mean whatever they want. Here, we see 
instead that in the Gricean approach a speaker can mean only what they believe the 
audience will be able to interpret them as meaning. Utterances do not just mean 
whatever the speaker wants them to. Since it is not simply by sharing rules of inter￾pretation with the audience that the speaker can communicate, they must construct 
a shared background of knowledge and beliefs that will allow the audience to inter￾pret the speaker as the speaker intends. The frst step in achieving this is by disclos￾ing their intention to communicate.
Principle of Cooperation and Conversational Maxims
Grice (1975) describes communication as a cooperative activity between rational 
cognitive subjects. Those who engage in communication decide to do it because 
they share a (possibly minimal) goal that they try to achieve through cooperation. 
Obviously, cooperation generates expectations. Grice clarifes the sorts of expecta￾tions communicators are subject to by enunciating a principle that should govern 
their cooperative activity (ibid., p. 45):
Principle of Cooperation:
Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it 
occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are 
engaged.
In a conversational exchange, the audience expects the speaker to follow the 
Principle of Cooperation, and such an expectation guides them in the interpretation 
of what the speaker means. Thus formulated, however, the principle is extremely 
general. Grice therefore articulates it in a series of maxims and submaxims that 
specify what the audience should expect from the speaker5
:
5The names of the conversational maxims echo the names of Kant’s categories, but there is no 
theoretical relation between the two lists. Grice’s choice suggests that his purpose in compiling the 
list of conversational maxims is not to carve at the joints the normativity of communicative prac￾tices but to provide a philosophical interpretation of communicative phenomena. He believed that 
his list was by no means complete and explicitly pointed out that many other aesthetic, social, and 
moral maxims are in fact observed in conversation; in this regard, his example was “Be polite” 
(Grice, 1975, p. 47).
Conversational Implicatures72
Conversational Maxims:
Quantity: (1) Make your contribution as informative as is required.
 (2) Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
 Quality: (1) Do not say what you believe to be false.
 (2) Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
 Relation: Be relevant.
 Manner: (1) Avoid obscurity of expression.
 (2) Avoid ambiguity.
 (3) Be brief.
 (4) Be orderly.
The maxims of Quantity articulate the expectation that the speaker should be suff￾ciently informative but not excessively  so. The best way to be cooperative is to 
provide just the right amount of information required by the purposes of the conver￾sation. The maxims of Quality specify that the speaker should provide only infor￾mation that is reasonably true. The idea is that giving false information does not 
help the audience. The maxim of Relation highlights the importance of the rele￾vance of a speaker’s contribution to the conversation. Finally, the maxims of Manner 
articulate the expectation that the speaker should be clear. By following the maxims, 
a speaker facilitates the process of interpretation for the audience. If the audience 
recognizes the speaker’s communicative intention, they may expect the speaker to 
be cooperative and to follow the conversational maxims.
The maxims are formulated in the imperative form, but they are not commands; 
in effect, the maxims simply express what the audience expects the speaker to do 
in order to achieve the satisfaction of their communicative intention. The norma￾tivity of the maxims derives from the audience’s expectations. They apply norma￾tively to the practice of communication because speakers are expected to follow 
them in order to be cooperative. To see the difference, just compare communica￾tion with a practice governed by prescriptive rules, such as driving a car. When 
you drive a car on a public road, what you are supposed to do is determined by 
traffc rules. Contrary to physical laws, traffc rules can be violated, even if one is 
not allowed to. Conversational maxims are neither like physical laws nor traffc 
rules; they neither describe nor establish what speakers can do. Speakers can vio￾late them and they are also allowed to violate them. If they do, however, they fail 
the expectations of the audience: as a result, the audience may think that speakers 
are no longer cooperating and quit the conversation. In other words, the price to 
pay for a speaker who violates the maxims is not a sanction but the risk that the 
audience does not recognize their communicative intention and thus does not ful￾fll it. For example, if your interlocutor keeps making only pointless or even false 
remarks during a conversation, you would probably come to the conclusion that 
they do not really want to collaborate with you: maybe they have other motives, 
but they clearly have no intentions of communicating. It would not be rational for 
them to have communicative intentions and behave in such a way. Conversational 
maxims are more akin to the constitutive rules of a game that defne what playing 
the game consists in.
5 Grice’s Inferential Model73
If they want to communicate, then speakers should abide by the conversational 
maxims; as it happens, however, they violate them all the time. Moreover, the 
violation of the maxims does not seem to correspond to the failure of communica￾tion; and the reason is not that the audience is particularly forgiving but to the 
contrary, it seems that in many cases the violation of the maxims enhances the 
results of the cooperation between speakers and the audience. Is this a problem for 
the Gricean approach? The answer is no; actually, it is just the key to its explana￾tory power. To understand why, it is important to begin by distinguishing four 
ways to violate the maxims. First, one can violate the maxims “quietly and unos￾tentatiously” (Grice, 1975, p. 49). For instance, if I ask, “Do you fnd this book 
interesting?”, and you answer, “Yes”, while you do not, you violate the maxim of 
quality by saying something false. As we have seen, these sorts of violations, once 
exposed, might be construed as the manifestation of the speaker’s unwillingness 
to cooperate and bring the communication to a close. Second, one can explicitly 
opt out from the Principle of Cooperation by saying, for example, “I cannot say 
more”. This is a violation of the maxim of quantity that is to be construed (cor￾rectly, this time) as manifesting the intention of the speaker to quit communica￾tion. Third, one might be in the position of having to violate one maxim in order 
not to violate another; in fact, different maxims might clash with each other. 
Suppose, for instance, I ask you, “Where does Joan live?”, and you are unsure 
about it; you then either have to violate the maxim of quantity by being less infor￾mative than is required, or the maxim of quality by giving me information for 
which you lack adequate evidence. Finally, the fourth case is the most interesting. 
It is the case in which maxims are voluntarily fouted for communicational pur￾poses. Speakers, in fact, might blatantly fail to satisfy the maxims to let the audi￾ence realize that they are implicating something more than what their utterances 
explicitly say. Grice’s analysis focuses on this latter case.
As we have seen, Grice makes a distinction within speaker meaning between 
what is said and what is implicated. What is said explicitly is mainly interpreted by 
means of the knowledge of the rules of language and contextual information. 
Explicit communication can therefore work well within the compliance with con￾versational maxims; to the contrary, implicit content must be somehow inferred by 
the audience. But why should the audience think that there is something implicit in 
what the speaker means? The violation of the conversational maxims provides just 
such a reason. In fact, given that communication is a cooperative activity, the viola￾tion of the maxims on the speaker’s part could appear to be irrational to the audi￾ence. If the audience notices a violation of the maxims after recognizing the 
speaker’s communicative intention, they can either decide the speaker is no more 
cooperative and quit the communication or try to infer content implicit in the speak￾er’s utterance that would explain why the speaker’s behavior is only apparently 
uncooperative. Grice calls these implicit contents inferred by the audience conver￾sational implicatures. A conversational implicature is propositional content inferred 
Conversational Implicatures74
by the audience to make the speaker’s utterance coherent with the Principle of 
Cooperation.6
Examples of Violation of the Maxims
In the following, some examples of violations of the conversational maxims are 
reviewed. These are violations that allow the generation of conversational implica￾tures. Let us start from the maxim of Quantity:
(44) War is war.
This is an identity statement that is always true, whatever the circumstances. A 
speaker who utters (44) clearly violates the frst sub-maxim of Quantity because 
they fail to give enough information to the audience. However, they probably mean 
more than what “War is war” explicitly says; in fact, they probably implicate some￾thing such as “It is known that war is terrible”, “It is known that in war there is col￾lateral damage”, and so on. These are conversational implicatures that can be 
inferred by someone who tries to understand the speaker’s choice to utter (44).
(45) A: Are you going to the party tonight?
 B: Yes, and I’m going with Joan.
In this case, the speaker provides the audience more information than is required to 
answer their question. This is a violation of the second sub-maxim of Quantity, but 
unfortunately it is easy for the audience to understand what the speaker implicated 
with it: “I will not go to the party with you”.
(46) I have nothing to wear!
Suppose (46) is uttered, as it sometimes happens, in front of a wardrobe full of 
clothes, by someone who simply does not know which outft to pick. In this case, 
the speaker is saying something that is literally false. By doing so, they violate the 
frst sub-maxim of Quality. What they implicate, however, is that they do not have 
anything that they like to wear on that occasion.
6Some critics distinguish between conversational implicatures that are generated on the assump￾tion that the speaker observes the maxims and implicatures that are generated on the assumption 
that the speaker “deliberately and ostentatiously breaches” (Levinson, 1983, p. 104) them. In the 
former, what is implicated by the speaker integrates or enriches what is said with their utterance. 
In the latter, conversational implicatures correct the explicit content of their utterance. Although 
Grice does not classify different kinds of conversational implicatures, he distinguishes between 
“saying” something and “making as if to say” (Grice, 1975, p. 53); for instance, in the case of the 
use of metaphors like “You are the cream in my coffee”, a speaker does not really say the explicit 
content of the sentence but merely makes as if to say it to implicate something else. Doubts about 
this sort of distinction have been raised by Sperber and Wilson (2002), Bach (2006), and 
Bianchi (2009).
5 Grice’s Inferential Model75
(47) It is going to be a success.
Here again, providing a little context might help. Suppose (47) is uttered by Joan to 
Mary who is going to defend her dissertation. Joan obviously cannot be sure that 
Mary’s defense will be a success; therefore, she is violating the second sub-maxim 
of Quality. What she implicates is that Mary did such a good job and is so well pre￾pared that nothing can go wrong.
(48) A: Where is Bill?
B: There is a yellow VW outside Sue’s house.
Here,7
 the literal content of B’s answer is clearly irrelevant with respect to A’s ques￾tion. If A assumes B to be cooperative, however, A might take B to be suggesting that 
there is some relation between the car’s and Bill’s location and A might draw the 
conversational implicature that Bill is at Sue’s house. As we have seen, example 
(36) can be analyzed in terms of the violation of the maxim of Relation along the 
same lines.
(49) ‘Do you know how many absolute impediments there are?’ ‘But what to you 
wish that I should know about impediments?’ ‘Error, conditio, votum, cogna￾tio, crimen,
Cultus disparitas, vis, ordo, ligamen, honestas, 
Si sis affnis. . . ,’ began Don Abbondio, counting them upon the point of his 
fngers.
‘You are playing a joke with me,’ interrupted the youth. ‘What should I know 
of your latinorum?’ ‘Well, then, if you do not understand these things have 
patience, and leave them to those who do.’ (The Betrothed Lovers, Ch. 2)
This dialogue between Renzo Tramaglino and Don Abbondio is taken from the 
second chapter of Alessandro Manzoni’s Italian novel The Betrothed Lovers. Renzo 
is in love with Lucia and meets with Don Abbondio, the priest, to arrange their mar￾riage. Don Abbondio, however, had just been threatened not to celebrate the mar￾riage by the bullyboys of Don Rodrigo, the local lordling who lusts after Lucia 
himself. Thus, Don Abbondio tries to discourage Renzo by citing the canon law in 
Latin; in doing so, he violates the frst sub-maxim of Manner. Renzo is in fact 
annoyed by the uncooperative behavior of the priest and protests that he does not 
understand Latin (“latinorum” is not a Latin word: Renzo makes it up to mean that 
Latin is gibberish to him). Yet, as Don Abbondio immediately makes explicit, the 
conversational implicature he intends to convey is just that those matters are too 
complicated for Renzo to understand.
(50) How do you make a turtle fast? You take away his food.
This old joke exploits the semantic ambiguity of the term “fast”: as an adjective, 
“fast” means quick, and, as a verb, “to fast” means to abstain from food. When 
someone understands what is said by (50) they come up with one of the 
7The example is taken from Levinson (1983, p. 102).
Conversational Implicatures76
interpretations, and the violation of the second sub-maxim of Manner generates the 
other one as a conversational implicature. In this case, this is enough to obtain a 
humorous effect, so there is probably nothing more that is implicated by the speaker 
(except maybe that the speaker himself is a funny person). At other times, the ambi￾guity produces more implicatures. This happens, for instance, with racist, sexist, 
and homophobic jokes where conversational implicatures that reinforce discrimina￾tory prejudices are generated.
(51) Walk up to the door, turn the door handle clockwise as far as it will go, and 
then pull gently towards you.
An utterance of this sentence violates the third sub-maxim of manner since the 
speaker could use a much briefer sentence like “Open the door”.8
 If, instead, they 
intentionally fout the maxim, the audience will try to understand what else they 
implicate. In this case, the conversational implicature will be something like “The 
door is tricky to open”. Notice that it is not always clear how to distinguish viola￾tions of the third sub-maxim of Manner from violations of the second sub-maxim of 
Quantity, since being prolix and giving more information than necessary actually 
coincide.
(52) Joan got pregnant and married.
From a semantic point of view, this sentence simply represents the conjunction of 
two states of affairs: Joan got pregnant and Joan got married. The audience, how￾ever, expects the speaker to abide with the fourth sub-maxim of Manner and be 
orderly. They will therefore interpret (52) as implicating that Joan frst got pregnant 
and then married. If the audience endorses certain morals, they may fnd this course 
of events abnormal and construe (52) as an exploitation of the maxim: in that case, 
the conversational implicature that they will infer is that Joan is an immoral woman.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we introduced a different approach to the analysis of communication 
based on the work of Paul Grice. We began by considering his distinction between 
natural and nonnatural meaning: the former is a natural relation between things or 
events in the world, in reason of which something can be treated as a sign of some￾thing else; the latter is what someone intends to convey by a communicative act. 
Nonnatural meaning is grounded in the intentions of a speaker. Grice analyzes 
speaker’s meaning in terms of three kinds of intentions: the informative intention 
that the audience react in certain ways to their utterance (e.g., by forming of a cer￾tain belief), the communicative intention that the audience recognize their informa￾tive intention, and the intention that the reaction of the audience depends on such a 
8See Levinson (1983, p. 108).
5 Grice’s Inferential Model77
recognition. In Grice’s analysis, communication is not about transmitting informa￾tion but about the manifestation and recognition of intentions. The literal meaning 
of linguistic expressions (as it is defned by the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic 
rules of a language) is the product of a conventionalization of what speakers usually 
mean by them.
We also saw that this approach requires an account of how speaker’s meaning is 
interpreted. Grice provides such an account in his theory of conversational implica￾tures. There are three main ideas that must be understood to comprehend his theory. 
First, Grice considers communication a cooperative activity between two or more 
people. Second, the assumption that speakers are cooperative generates in the audi￾ence the expectation that they will facilitate the interpretation of their communica￾tive acts; these expectations correspond to the conversational maxims that the 
speakers should respect. When the maxims are respected, the audience can trust the 
speakers that what they mean is simply what they say. Speakers, however, may 
decide to “fout” the maxims to let the audience understand that they are implying 
something else: this is a conversational implicature.

Chapter 6
Levels of Meaning
Not everything that is implicated by a speaker is a conversational implicature. To 
better understand the Gricean model, it is important to deepen the analysis of the 
pragmatic processes that in this model are intended to account for the possibility of 
communicating contents beyond the explicit meaning of linguistic signs.
Kinds of Implicatures
There are different ways in which contents can be said to be implicated by a speak￾er’s utterance. Classifying them is a rather complex task, undertaken with great 
effort by several philosophers and linguists. What follows is a brief review of the 
main types of content that someone can infer from what a speaker explicitly says.
Entailments
To begin with, implicatures must be distinguished from logical implications or 
entailments. A conversational implicature is a propositional content that is implic￾itly meant by a speaker while performing an utterance. An entailment is a proposi￾tional content that explicitly follows by logical rules from the semantic content of 
what the speaker says. Compare, for instance, the following cases:
(53) Joan plays tennis and Mary plays basketball.
Entailment: Joan plays tennis.
(44) War is war.
Implicature: It is known that war is a terrible thing.

The reason why “Joan plays tennis” is logically implied by “Joan plays tennis and 
Mary plays basketball” is because there is a logical rule that governs the inferential 
behavior of the conjunction according to which both conjuncts logically follow 
from a conjunction. This rule is valid because a conjunction cannot be true while 
one of its conjuncts is false. Therefore, if “Joan plays tennis and Mary plays basket￾ball” is true, then “Joan plays tennis” must be true as well. On the contrary, the 
reason why “It is known that war is terrible” is conversationally implicated by “War 
is war” is because the speaker must think “It is known that war is a terrible thing” 
for their utterance of “War is war” to be consistent with the Principle of Cooperation. 
Logical implications are a semantic phenomenon: they are implied by the semantic 
content of what a speaker says. Conversational implicatures are a pragmatic phe￾nomenon: they are implicated by the fact that the speaker makes an utterance.
Conventional implicatures 
Among pragmatic phenomena, Grice himself distinguishes between conventional
implicatures and conversational implicatures. While the latter are generated case by 
case in the specifc context in which a speaker makes an utterance, the former are 
always generated in every context by the use of certain expressions. Consider the 
following examples:
(54) Mario is Italian and therefore he is very romantic.
Conventional implicature: There is a connection between being Italian and 
being very romantic.
(55) Joan is beautiful but intelligent.
Conventional implicature: There is a contrast between being beautiful and 
being intelligent.
Conventional implicatures are conventionally associated with the use of certain 
expressions in certain sentences. In example (54), the conjunction “therefore” con￾ventionally implicates that there is a conceptual connection between the fact that 
Mario is Italian and the fact that he is romantic. Similarly in (55), the conjunction 
“but” conventionally implicates a contrast, which in the case of the above example 
is used to convey a misogynous prejudice. Since conversational implicatures are 
associated with specifc expressions, they are generated in every context even if they 
are not part of the semantic content of what is said.
Generalized Conversational Implicatures 
Conversational implicatures are a manifold phenomenon themselves. They can be 
classifed into particularized conversational implicatures and generalized conversa￾tional implicatures. The conversational implicatures that have been discussed here 
are all particularized because they are generated in specifc contexts. On the 
6 Levels of Meaning81
contrary, generalized implicatures tend to be generated by default in every context. 
Compare the following implicatures:
(56) Joan has two children.
Particularized implicature: Joan does not have much spare time for herself.
Generalized implicature: Joan has only two children.
Consider a context in which speakers are discussing the responsibilities of adult￾hood. In the context of such a conversation, a speaker who utters, “Joan has two 
children”, may well mean that Joan has little spare time for herself. If the context 
changes, however, the conversational implicature might no longer be generated. 
Alternatively, if the topic of the conversation is the joy of parenthood, the speaker 
will probably implicate something like “Joan is very lucky”. A particularized con￾versational implicature is generated only because the context allows it. On the con￾trary, a generalized conversational implicature is always generated except the 
context preempts it; thus, in both the previously considered contexts, whether the 
discussion is about the responsibilities of adulthood or the joy of parenthood, a 
speaker who utters, “Joan has two children”, always implicates “Joan has only two 
children”. A special context is required to block the generalized implicature. For 
example, if the speakers are discussing fscal exemptions for families, then the utter￾ance “Joan has two children” might implicate that she qualifes for a certain beneft 
that requires having at least two children but does not generate the implicature that 
“Joan has only two children”.
It is not always easy to distinguish generalized from particularized implicatures; 
in fact, the two phenomena tend to overlap, especially where the use of certain 
expressions becomes in part conventionalized. It can be argued, for instance, that 
the conversational implicatures generated by utterances like (44) are relatively 
context-independent (Levinson, 1983, p. 127). Taken to the extreme, this process 
gives rise to the phenomenon of catachresis, in which fgures of speech end up 
being adopted in the current use of language and their content becomes explicit:
(57) The chair has four legs.
(58) Avoid holding a wine bottle by the neck.
The analysis of generalized implicatures aims to single out regular patterns in the 
pragmatic determination of implicit contents (Gazdar, 1979; Levinson, 2000; Horn, 
2004; Atlas, 2005). These patterns deliver default interpretations of linguistic utter￾ances which pose a problem for the philosophy of language and communication; in 
fact, generalized implicatures can be accounted for neither in terms of semantic 
content nor in terms of purely pragmatic processes.
Scalar Implicatures
An illustrative example of this sort of analysis is the so-called scalar implicatures. 
These are generalized implicatures systematically generated by the expectation that 
the maxim of Quantity is being followed. Their systematicity depends on the fact 
Kinds of Implicatures82
that it is possible to identify in the language sets of expressions of the same gram￾matical category, which can be ordered on a scale of informativeness or “linguistic 
scale”. The following are examples of linguistic scales (Horn, 1972):
⟨all, most, many, some, few⟩
⟨and, or⟩
⟨n, …, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1⟩
⟨excellent, good⟩
⟨hot, warm⟩
⟨always, often, sometimes⟩
⟨succeed in Ving, trying to V, want to V⟩
⟨necessarily p, p, possibly p⟩
⟨certain that p, probable that p, possible that p⟩
⟨must, should, may⟩
⟨cold, cool⟩
⟨love, like⟩
It is easy to notice that when a sentence contains one of the expressions in a scale, 
it entails the sentence that results from the substitution of that expression with an 
informatively weaker one in the same scale; for instance, consider substituting 
“some” for “all” in the following sentence:
(59) Most students will pass the exam.
(60) Some students will pass the exam.
Here, (59) entails (60) because it is not possible for the former to be true and the 
latter false. This condition illustrates the sense in which in a linguistic scale expres￾sions are ordered according to their informativeness: more informative expressions 
represent states of affairs which include states of affairs represented by less infor￾mative expressions.
Now, scalar implicatures are generated when a speaker decides to use an infor￾matively weak expression in a linguistic scale:
(56) Joan has two children.
Scalar implicature: Joan does not have three children.
(60) Some students will pass the exam.
Scalar implicature: Not all students will pass the exam.
In cases such as these, the choice of the speaker apparently violates the maxim of 
Quantity, because they choose to give less information than they could. As a matter 
of fact, they use an informatively weak expression while there are informationally 
stronger ones in the linguistic scale; assuming that the speaker is cooperative, their 
choice can therefore only be explained by the fact that they could not do otherwise. 
Thus, for instance, when confronted with the utterance of (56) the audience should 
reason along the following lines:
The speaker said that Joan has two children. There are expressions informatively stronger 
than “two” in the linguistic scale. If they could use them, they had to do it in reason of the 
frst maxim of Quantity. Yet, they did not and therefore, assuming they are cooperating, they 
could not. The reason must be that they know that Joan has no more than two children or 
they are unsure: in either case, had they said that Joan has more than two children, they 
would have violated the maxim of Quality. Therefore the speaker implicates that Joan has 
only two children.
6 Levels of Meaning83
Generally speaking, whenever a lexical scale is given, the assertion of the weaker 
expression implicates the negation of the stronger one. Since scalar implicatures 
depend on lexical scales, they are generated by default in every context: this is what 
makes them generalized implicatures. Scalar implicatures are relatively common, 
since linguistic expressions might be ordered in lexical scales in the most various 
ways. Sometimes they heavily rely on encyclopedic knowledge. Let us examine the 
following examples:
(61) I believe that John is away.
Scalar implicature: For all I know, John could not be away.
Lexical scale: ⟨know, believe⟩
(62) A: John is brilliant.
B: Yeah, well, John is smart.
Scalar implicature: Joan is not brilliant.
Lexical scale: ⟨brilliant, smart⟩
(63) A: Have you ever visited Italy?
B: I have visited Rome.
Scalar implicature: I have not visited anywhere else in Italy.
Lexical scale: ⟨Italy, Rome⟩
Obviously, the more context-specifc background information is required to con￾struct a lexical scale, the less general can be considered the implicature; again, the 
boundaries between particularized and generalized implicatures are blurred.
Properties of the Implicatures
The categories of conventional implicatures, generalized conversational implica￾tures, and particularized conversational implicatures describe different sorts of 
implicit pragmatic content which should be carefully noticed and distinguished. It 
is important, then, to single out some of the properties that allow a better character￾ization of these different phenomena.
Calculability
To begin with, conversational implicatures are calculable. A hearer H can work out 
the conversational implicature q that a speaker S implicates with the utterance of p
by performing an inferential reasoning. Here is how it goes from H’s own point of 
view (Grice, 1975, p. 50; Levinson, 1983, pp. 113–114):
(i) S has said that p;
(ii) there is no reason to think that S is not observing the maxims, or at least the 
Principle of Cooperation;
(iii) S could not say p and be cooperative without also thinking that q;
Properties of the Implicatures84
(iv) S knows (and knows that I know that he knows) that I can see that the supposi￾tion that he thinks that q is required.
(v) S has done nothing to stop me thinking that q;
(vi) therefore S intends me to think q, and in saying that p has implicated q.
On the one hand, both particularized and generalized conversational implicatures 
are calculable. In fact, in both cases there is an inferential reasoning that the hearer 
can follow to infer the implicature q from the speaker’s utterance of p. The differ￾ence between the two cases lies in the reason why it is necessary to suppose the 
speaker thinks that q in order to make their utterance of p consistent with the 
Principle of Cooperation. In the case of generalized implicatures, there are some 
general linguistic features (lexical, morphological, grammatical, etc.) that make the 
implicature required in every context by default. To the contrary, particularized 
implicatures are determined on the basis of specifc, contextual assumptions. 
Conventional implicatures, instead, are not calculable, because there is no inferen￾tial reasoning that the audience computes to determine them; in fact, they are con￾ventionally generated by using certain expressions in certain sentences, rather than 
by expecting the speakers to behave in certain ways once their intentions have been 
recognized.
The calculability of conversational implicatures is maybe the most interesting 
characteristic of Grice’s inferential model; however, it also poses some explanatory 
problems. Steps (i)–(vi) illustrate how conversational implicatures are calculated. 
But how is such an illustration really to be construed? If it describes something like 
a procedure that goes on in the mind of the audience, then it looks quite implausible: 
actually, speakers do not entertain such complex intentions and the audience does 
not engage in such sort of inferential reasoning (Evans & McDowell, 1976, pp. 
xvii–xxi); we simply do not do that when we communicate. It is then more reason￾able to assume that Grice had no intention in describing the actual psychological 
processes taking place in someone’s head while processing conversational implica￾tures. In this sense, Grice would simply provide an intuitive and rational reconstruc￾tion of the process with no pretension of psychological accuracy. This is one of the 
reasons why Sperber and Wilson argued for the necessity of going beyond Grice’s 
philosophical analysis of implicatures by adopting a cognitive approach (Sperber & 
Wilson, 1986, p. 37). From a cognitive point of view, the Gricean calculus of con￾versational implicatures is also problematic because it still relies on mutual knowl￾edge. In fact, even if Grice does not fully make it explicit, Step (iv) in the reasoning 
requires that both the audience and the speaker mutually know that the speaker 
ought to think that q in order to make their utterance of p consistent with the 
Principle of Cooperation.
6 Levels of Meaning85
Being Part of What is Said
Obviously, conversational implicatures do not contribute to the semantic content of 
a speaker’s utterance; they are a purely pragmatic phenomenon, and have nothing to 
do with the truth conditions of what is said. In order to realize that, it is enough to 
notice that the uttered proposition could be true, while the implicature is false. 
Consider, for instance, the following example:
(64) Women are women.
Implicature: Women are expected to behave like male chauvinists expect 
them to.
Clearly, the tautology “Women are women” is true, but its chauvinist implicature is 
false.1
 It might even be the other way around: the uttered proposition might be false 
and the implicature true. This usually happens in the case of metaphors, as in the 
following:
(65) My lawyer is a shark.
Implicature: My lawyer is vicious and dangerous.
No shark has ever graduated from law school, therefore “My lawyer is a shark” is 
certainly false; however, my lawyer could really be vicious and dangerous, and so 
the implicature could be true.
The more interesting question is whether conventional implicatures are to be 
considered a semantic phenomenon after all. In fact, they are not. It is possible to 
run the same test as before on conventional implicatures as well and verify that their 
truth conditions are independent from the truth conditions of the sentence that gen￾erates them.
(54) Mario is Italian and therefore he is very romantic.
Conventional implicature: There is a connection between being Italian and 
being very romantic.
Thus in (54) what is said could be true and what is implicated could be false.
It is important to stress that what this test aims to establish is whether the truth 
conditions of the sentence and those of the implicatures are dependent on each 
other. If they are not, then implicatures do not contribute to the semantic content of 
the sentence. To understand this point, it could be useful to compare the relations 
between the truth conditions of a conjunction and the truth conditions of one of its 
conjuncts; for instance, the conjunction “Joan plays the guitar and Mary sings” is 
true if and only if both its conjuncts “Joan plays the guitar” and “Mary sings” are 
true: in this case, the truth conditions of the conjunction depend on the truth 
1Notice that the implicature is generated even if it is false. A speaker who utters “Women are 
women” in most contexts does implicate that women are expected to behave like male chauvinists 
expect them to; in fact, implicatures are not entailments: a logical implication is not valid if it could 
be the case that the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
Properties of the Implicatures86
conditions of the conjuncts. To the contrary, there is no relation between the truth 
conditions of an uttered sentence and those of its implicatures. Implicatures are not 
part of what is said by a speaker.
Notice, however, that the absence of any such semantic relation does not imply 
that there is no other sort of relation between them; in fact, there is a clear pragmatic 
relation: since implicatures are part of what a speaker means, the speaker can be 
taken to endorse them to a certain extent. This point has to do with another property 
that implicatures have: they can be cancelled.
Cancellability
Conversational implicatures are defeasible. An inference is defeasible when the 
addition of other premises might preempt its validity. Consider, for instance, the 
following inference:
The match is scratched.
Therefore, the match will light.
It is valid in standard circumstances: if you scratch a match, it will light; however, it 
is valid in standard circumstances only. If we come to know something else about 
the circumstances in which the match is scratched (i.e., if we add premises to the 
inference), it might turn out to be invalid; thus, if there is no oxygen around the 
match, it will not light if you scratch it. In fact, the following inference is not valid:
The match is scratched.
There is no oxygen around the match.
Therefore, the match will light.
In this case, the addition of a new premise is enough to turn a valid inference into an 
invalid one. This is why the original inference is said to be defeasible. Logically 
valid inferences are not defeasible. An inference is logically valid if in any possible 
state of affairs in which the premises are true the conclusion is true as well. Consider 
the following syllogism:
Socrates is man.
All men are mortal.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
Here, the inference will go through no matter how many other premises are added 
to specify the circumstances, because there is simply no circumstance in which the 
premises of this inference are true and the conclusion is false.
Now, conversational implicatures are defeasible precisely because they can be 
cancelled by giving more information. Indeed, there are two ways in which the 
generation of conversational implicatures can be blocked: they can be cancelled 
contextually, by providing contextual information that preempts their generation 
beforehand, and they can be cancelled explicitly, by negating them after they have 
been generated. To illustrate the two cases, consider the following examples:
6 Levels of Meaning87
(66) Joan: Will you go trekking tomorrow?
Mary: Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat and I am looking for an excuse 
not to do it.
(67) Joan: Will you go trekking tomorrow?
Mary: Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat, but I will come anyway.
In (66), Mary gives Joan additional information that stops the generation of the 
implicature: it would not be rational for Mary to believe that she will not go trekking 
if she is looking for a way to avoid moving the next day. Instead, in (67) Mary lets 
Joan fgure out the conversational implicature but then denies it explicitly. In both 
cases, however, conversational implicatures can be cancelled without contradiction: 
a speaker who blocks or denies a conversational implicature does not contradict 
themselves. Both particularized and generalized conversational implicatures are 
cancellable in this sense.
To the contrary, conventional implicatures are not cancellable. They are gener￾ated in every context; therefore, there is no way to stop them beforehand by provid￾ing more contextual information, and they cannot be denied without contradiction. 
Consider, in fact, what happens if one tries to cancel the implicature in (54):
(68) *Mario is Italian and therefore he is very romantic, but there is no connection 
between being Italian and being romantic.
Thus, (68) is not a sentence a speaker may use without giving the impression of con￾tradicting themselves. Obviously, it is not a semantic contradiction, as if one were to 
deny the conclusion of a logically valid inference. The contradictory feeling is con￾veyed by the fact that conventional implicatures are generated by using certain expres￾sions in certain sentences independently from the contextual information so that the 
speaker using those expressions cannot be mistakenly construed to mean them. Since 
they end up being part of what the speaker means whenever they use the expressions 
that generate them, they cannot be taken back: the speaker cannot both mean and not 
mean them. The non-cancellability of conventional implicatures confrms that 
although they are not part of the truth-functional content of a speaker’s utterance, they 
are a relevantly different phenomenon with respect to conversational ones.
Non-Detachability
Conversational implicatures are generated by the fact that the literal meaning of the 
sentence uttered by the speaker is not consistent with the assumption they are fol￾lowing the maxims. Implicatures, as Levinson (1983, p. 116) puts it, are attached to 
the semantic content of what is said. The content is what really matters for the gen￾eration of conversational implicatures, rather than the form in which such content is 
expressed. In a context in which a certain semantic content generates a conversa￾tional implicature, the very same conversational implicature will be generated by 
the utterance of any sentence with such a semantic content. If a conversational 
implicature is generated by the utterance of a sentence with a certain semantic 
Properties of the Implicatures88
content, the same semantic content cannot be expressed without generating the 
same conversational implicature. In this sense, conversational implicatures are said 
to be non-detachable from semantic content. Consider, for instance, the follow￾ing case:
(69) Joan is Joan.
Conversational implicature: Joan has her own peculiar personality.
Just like (44), here we have a violation of the maxim of Quantity that may generate 
a conversational implicature. Such an implicature cannot be detached by substitut￾ing “Joan is Joan” with a grammatically different sentence with the same semantic 
content.
(70) Joan is herself.
Conversational implicature: Joan has her own peculiar personality.
In fact, here the same conversational implicature is generated once again.
Conventional implicatures, instead, are detachable. This should not be surpris￾ing, because, in fact, conventional implicatures are not generated by the utterance of 
sentences with a certain semantic content, but by using certain specifc linguistic 
expressions. Consequently, if the sentence containing the expression that generates 
the implicature is substituted with another sentence with the same semantic content 
but without that specifc expression, the implicature will not be generated. Here 
again an example may be useful to illustrate the phenomenon:
(71) Mario is Italian but he can speak English very well.
Conventional implicature: Usually, Italians cannot speak English very well.
In this case, the use of the conjunction “but” generates the conventional implicature 
that there is a contrast between being Italian and being able to speak English well 
enough. From the semantic point of view, however, the conjunction “but” has the 
very same content as the conjunction “and”: the sentence “p but q” is true if and 
only if both p and q are true, just like “p and q” is true if and only if both p and q are 
true; however, the use of “and” in the same sentence does not generate the same 
conventional implicature.
(72) Mario is Italian and he can speak English very well.
Notice that (72) has the same semantic content of (71), and it does not generate the 
same conventional implicature.
How Many Levels of Content Are There?
The Gricean inferential model allows for the analysis of implicit communication. 
By doing this, however, it multiplies the levels of content that must be taken into 
account (Recanati, 2004a, 2004b). As it was explained, Grice himself distinguished 
between what is explicitly said and what is implicated by a speaker with an 
6 Levels of Meaning89
utterance. According to Grice, the explicit content is primarily determined by the 
semantic rules of the language, and secondarily specifed by using contextual infor￾mation. Semantic rules associate a conventional meaning to a sentence indepen￾dently of the context in which the sentence is uttered. This frst level of conventional 
content, however, is often incomplete, in the sense that it is not enough to specify 
the state of affairs that the sentence represents. In the traditional semantic analysis, 
the representational content of a sentence is what is known when the proposition is 
understood, namely what is the case if it is true. If the speaker utters, “I am walking 
along the bank”, the representational content of what they say cannot be determined 
by applying semantic rules only. To know what is the case if “I am walking along 
the bank” is true, one must know who “I” refers to and what “bank” means. That 
requires knowing the identity of the speaker and the background information in the 
given context.
Conventional meaning must therefore be flled in with contextual information in 
order to obtain the full representational content of what is said. The only inferential 
processes operating at this second level are those required for the saturation of 
indexical expressions and the resolution of syntactical and semantic ambiguities. 
Saturation and disambiguation are inferential processes because they rely on back￾ground information. Thus, to determine the reference of “I”, the audience must 
draw an inference from knowledge of both the identity of the speaker and the 
semantic rule that assigns to the frst personal pronoun the speaker who utters the 
sentence in which the pronoun occurs; and to determine whether “bank” means the 
slope of land that borders a river or the building where a fnancial institution is 
located, the reader must draw an inference from knowledge of the context in which 
John’s walking takes place. However, saturation and disambiguation only contribute 
to the determination of the representational content of the proposition uttered by the 
speaker, and, according to Grice, it is for this reason they are to be considered at the 
level of explicit content.
Finally, the last level of content is what is implicated. By and large, this sort of 
implicit content is constituted by implicatures only. To sum up, there are three levels 
of content according to this Gricean view (Fig. 6.1).

How Many Levels of Content Are There?90
As we have seen, however, some Neo-Gricean authors have identifed and 
focused on a further level of meaning characterized by generalized conversational 
implicatures. This is construed as an intermediate level: on the one hand, it is deter￾mined by pragmatic processes; on the other hand, it is required for the complete 
analysis of what is explicitly said; in fact, generalized conversational implicatures 
bring about the default interpretations that are responsible for phenomena like free 
enrichment, for example (cf. Sect. 4.1).
Neo-Griceans argue that this pragmatically enriched content is what speakers 
actually identify as the literal meaning of the sentence they utter. Consider the fol￾lowing scene: you just woke up and go to the kitchen to have breakfast. Your fat￾mate, who is already having cereal, looks at you and says:
(73) There is milk in the fridge.
What you are likely to understand is that there is enough milk in the fridge for you 
to have breakfast. This obviously is not the result of the semantic analysis of (73); 
rather, it is pragmatically enriched content obtained as a default interpretation. 
Notice that your fatmate’s utterance would be true even if there was just a drop of 
milk on the bottom of the fridge, but that is not what you take him to say explicitly. 
In such a situation, you might even retort that it is plainly false that there is some 
milk in the fridge if there is in effect just a drop.
In this sense, pragmatic processes such as enrichment and generalized implica￾tures contribute to the determination of the intuitive truth conditions of an utterance, 
that is to say of the conditions at which a competent speaker will take an uttered 
sentence to be true or false. Intuitive truth conditions could differ from the actual 
truth conditions as they are defned by the application of semantic rules. Processes 
that provide this sort of contribution are singled out as primary pragmatic processes 
and distinguished from the secondary ones that pertain to the calculation of conver￾sational implicatures.
In reason of the recognition of the importance of this level of meaning, these 
authors have stressed the distinction between two senses of what is said: on the one 
hand, a purely semantic notion that corresponds to the minimal proposition that 
results from the application of the process of saturation to the semantic analysis of 
a sentence and, on the other hand, a pragmatic notion that corresponds to the 
enriched content of an utterance that is explicitly meant by a speaker. In this view, 
four levels of meaning are considered (Recanati, 2004a, p. 52) (Fig. 6.2).
This highly detailed articulation of meaning assigns to the theory of communica￾tion the diffcult task of harmonizing signifcantly different processes into a unique 
account of communicative acts. In the next chapter, a different approach to the anal￾ysis of implicit content will be described, an approach that tries to bring back the 
analysis of all levels of meaning to a single cognitive principle and the processes 
that it governs.

Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we looked more in depth at the distinction between what is said and 
what is implicated by an utterance. We began by noticing that implicit communica￾tion is composed of different phenomena. First, implicatures must be distinguished 
from entailments. Entailments are the logical consequences that necessarily follow 
from a sentence; they are generated by the semantic content of the uttered sentence. 
Implicatures are propositions that are implicitly conveyed by a speaker with an 
utterance; they are a pragmatic phenomenon generated by a speaker’s act of utter￾ing. We then distinguished, after Grice, conventional and conversational implica￾tures: the former are associated to the use of certain expressions, the latter are 
calculated to repair an apparent violation of conversational maxims. Among conver￾sational implicatures, we also distinguished between generalized and particularized 
ones, depending on whether they are generated always by default, or only in specifc 
contexts. Grice originally identifed a few properties that may help differentiating 
all these cases: being part of what is said, being calculable, being cancellable, and 
being detachable. Only entailments are part of what is sad. To the contrary of con￾ventional ones, conversational implicatures are calculable, cancellable, and non￾detachable; because they are inferred by the audience, they can be cancelled by 
making other utterances, and they do not depend on any particular formulation of 
the semantic content of the utterance that generates them. In light of this articulated 
taxonomy of pragmatic phenomena, the Gricean approach offers a layered picture 
of the meaning of an utterance as it is interpreted by the audience: frst, there is 
sentence meaning, as it is decodifed by applying language rules, then there is what 
is said, that is the truth-conditional content of the utterance, and, fnally, what is 
implied by the utterer. Some Neo-Gricean authors have thought that the full
Chapter Summary92
truth-conditional content is only determined together with the intervention of some 
pragmatic phenomena and therefore envisaged a further distinction between what is 
said in a semantic sense and what is said in the pragmatic one. Whatever the number 
of levels one identifes, the problem with this picture is that it is not clear whether 
its different layers actually correspond to different types of contents and distin￾guishable steps in the process of interpretation, or we are just aware of the meaning 
of an utterance as the result of the entire process.

Most of the topics of this chapter are covered in Levinson (1983, ch. 3), Chapman 
(2012, chs. 4 and 5), and Birner (2012, chs. 3 and 10). More specifcally, on the 
notion of implicature, see Horn (2004) and Davis (2019).
Further Advanced Reading
Neo-Griceans insist on the regularities of the structure and use of language, defend￾ing the idea of levels of meaning that utterances may have by default in any context. 
In this sense, they maintain an intermediate position between Literalism and 
Contextualism that has been called a “syncretic view”. The Neo-Gricean literature 
is fairly extensive: here, we only consider some of the most classic essays in which 
the topics of this chapter are addressed in a general form. The characterizing feature 
of the Neo-Gricean tradition is defnitely the focus on generalized conversational 
implicatures; among the most important analyses of the subject, there are Horn 
(1972, 1984, 1989), Harnish (1976), Gazdar (1979), and Levinson (2000) and Atlas 
(2005). For a problematization of the notion of conventional implicature, instead, 
see Karttunen & Peters (1979), Bach (1999), and Potts (2005, 2007). On a more 
general note, see Bach (1994) and Recanati (2004a, ch. 4) for a discussion of the 
levels of meaning; more specifcally, see Recanati (2004b) and Stokke & Schoubye 
(2016) for the notion of “what is said”. See also the collections of essays Turner 
(1999), Bianchi (2004), and Szabó (2005) for the general problem of the distinction 
between semantics and pragmatics.

Chapter Summary95
Chapter 7
Relevance Theory
As we have seen in the two previous chapters, according to the Gricean model, com￾municative practices hinge on the recognition of intentions rather than the codifca￾tion and decodifcation of messages: the audience recognizes the speakers’ intentions 
and try to “read their mind” to infer what they mean by their communicative behav￾ior. While Grice’s legacy recommends a radical shift of perspective in the analysis 
of communication, however, it also leaves some unanswered and challenging 
questions.
The cognitive scientist Dan Sperber and the linguist Deirdre Wilson (1986) iden￾tifed four main problems in Grice’s approach. The frst one is that it distinguishes 
between different levels of content, but it does not provide a unifed account of the 
way in which they are communicated. The second one is that conversational max￾ims are formulated in terms of concepts that are left undefned; this is especially the 
case for the concept of relevance in the maxim of relation, which is adopted as an 
intuitive notion. As a result, the theory of conversational implicatures ultimately 
remains commonsensical, pre-theoretical and devoid of predictive power. The third 
problem is that Grice describes the reasoning someone must make to infer conver￾sational implicatures from what the speaker says, but does not explain how such a 
reasoning is actually performed so that the audience can infer exactly the implica￾ture they do in any given situation. In other words, given the fact that the audience 
has inferred a conversational implicature, Grice’s model may offer a rational recon￾struction of how they did it, but it does not allow predictions about what implicature 
a certain person will infer from certain utterances. Finally, the fourth problem is the 
most serious. As we have seen, conversational implicatures are calculable on the 
basis of the literal meaning of an utterance and the background knowledge of the 
audience. The problem is that for this knowledge to be used in the interpretation of 
the speaker’s meaning, it must be mutual, and ultimately this makes Grice’s model 
too implausible from a cognitive point of view.
Relevance Theory is the research program that originates from Sperber and 
Wilson’s attempt to provide a cognitively sound account of communication that

could draw from Grice’s lesson about the role intentions play in it. Another major 
contribution to the defnition of the Relevantist school was provided by Robyn 
Carston’s analysis of the semantics-pragmatics interface (Carston, 2002). This 
chapter is devoted to the presentation of the Relevantist proposal.1
Mutual Cognitive Environments
The frst issue to address in order to develop a cognitive model of communication is 
to defne a plausible notion of sharing information to be used in communication. In 
Chap. 4, we argued that the notion of mutual knowledge is inadequate for the task: 
the mutual knowledge of even a single piece of information requires an infnite set 
of recursive knowledge that no subject with our fnite cognitive resources could 
entertain. There are reasons, however, to doubt that communicators really need to 
share information in the form of mutual knowledge. As we have seen, knowledge is 
traditionally construed as justifed, true belief; and yet, communicators sometimes 
use information even if it is not true (but they merely believe it to be) and even if 
they have no guarantee that their peers actually entertain it before the communica￾tion exchange is initiated.
To meet these explanatory demands, Sperber and Wilson put forward the notion 
of manifestness, which they defned as follows (Sperber & Wilson, 1986, p. 39):
A fact F is manifest to an individual A at a given time t if and only if (i) A is capable 
at t of forming a mental representation of F and (ii) A is capable at t of accepting it 
as true or probably true.
It is easy to notice that manifestness is a much weaker notion than knowledge 
from a cognitive point of view. First, a fact can be manifest to an individual even if 
it is not actual. Consider again Mary, who thinks that her car is in the parking spot 
where she left it. Suppose that unfortunately her car was stolen, and it is actually 
somewhere else. Nonetheless, Mary has a mental representation of the fact that her 
car is in the parking spot where she left it, and she accepts it to be true. Therefore, 
the fact that her car is where she left it is to be considered as manifest to Mary. 
Second and most importantly, it is not the case that an individual must actually have 
1A preliminary caveat is in order here. Relevantists, in general, are committed to some form of the 
thesis of the modularity of the mind (Sperber & Wilson, 1986; Sperber, 1994; Sperber & Wilson, 
2002). The modular theory of mind was originally presented by Fodor (1983, 2000). Dan Sperber, 
in particular, insisted that the mind has no central processes and that there must be a dedicated 
mental module performing the operations that Relevance Theory postulates. In what follows, how￾ever, I will present Relevance Theory without dwelling much on the pros and cons of the modular￾ity thesis. I will be content with the assumption that the human mind can perform certain 
operations—specifcally, that it is able to select relevant information—regardless of how it does it. 
Clearly, the price to pay for this choice is omitting a full account of the cognitive mechanisms that 
allow communicators to perform the inferences required to understand each other. I believe, none￾theless, that Relevance Theory can still be presented as a cognitive theory of communication even 
without committing to a specifc cognitive theory.
7 Relevance Theory97
a mental representation of a fact for it to be manifest to them. This is because, 
according to Sperber and Wilson’s defnition, the individual only needs to be “capa￾ble” of forming a mental representation and accepting it as true; for instance, the 
fact that it is going to rain is considered manifest to someone who is looking at the 
dark clouds in the sky even if they have not yet drawn the inference that the dark 
clouds imply rain. Similarly, the fact that the Battle of Hastings was fought in 1066 
is considered manifest to you now while reading these lines, because you could 
recall it even if you were not thinking about it at all.
This sort of modal character built into manifestness also carries with it a certain 
gradualness of the notion. Some facts are more manifest than others, to a particular 
individual in a particular situation. This gradualness comes in two senses. The frst 
follows from point (i) in the defnition of manifestness, and it has to do with the fact 
that it is easier for the individual to form a mental representation of some of the facts 
that are manifest to them rather than others. In all likelihood, the date of the Battle 
of Hastings was more manifest to you during your school days than it is now, 
because it was easier for you to represent it in your mind then.2
 In this sense, some 
facts are more accessible than others. The second sense of gradualness depends on 
point (ii) in the defnition of manifestness. It is easy to see that an individual may 
accept a fact as more probable or less probable. For example, if you see with your 
own eyes that it is raining, you may take that fact to be more likely true than if you 
understand it by listening to the weather forecast. In this sense, facts may be mani￾fest to an individual with more or less strength.
Individuals need information to perform their cognitive tasks. Communication is 
one of these, but clearly it is not the only one. If someone needs to go back to their 
car, it must be manifest to them where it is parked. If someone needs to go for a walk, 
it must be manifest to them whether or not it is going to rain, and so on. This informa￾tion is made up of the collection of the facts that are manifest to the individual. In this 
sense, an individual’s cognitive environment can be said to consist in this information:
The cognitive environment of an individual is the set of facts that are manifest 
to them.
It is extremely unlikely for two different individuals to have the very same cogni￾tive environment. In fact, different individuals have different histories and different 
experiences. However, cognitive environments are not private, and, indeed, they can 
be shared quite easily; thus, consider again the situation in which Mary and Joan are 
walking down the street and see a Ferrari passing by. Naturally, Mary and Joan have 
different visual felds, and they might notice different things—meaning they might 
2This is plausible, but other cases seem to be more problematic. For instance, are the consequences 
of a scientifc theory manifest to those who know the axioms? On the one hand, scientists should 
be able to infer the consequences of a theory from its axioms. On the other hand, it is very unlikely 
that one might simply treat these consequences as background information in a conversation 
because they are very diffcult to infer; still, according to Sperber and Wilson’s defnition, they are 
to be considered in principle as manifest. The reasons for this choice will be clearer in the context 
of their analysis of communication.
Mutual Cognitive Environments98
form mental representations of different facts. In principle, however, they are capa￾ble of forming mental representations of the very same things in that situation. More 
precisely, they can form a mental representation of the car passing by. The fact that 
a Ferrari is passing by is therefore manifest to both. Let the shared cognitive envi￾ronment of two individuals be the set of facts that are manifest to both of them. The 
shared cognitive environment of two individuals is just the intersection of their cog￾nitive environments and cannot be used in communication for the very same reason 
why shared knowledge cannot: communicators have no guarantee of sharing the 
information contained in it. Obviously, facts cannot only be manifest to different 
individuals but also mutually manifest to them.
A fact F is mutually manifest to A and B if F is manifest to both A and B and it is 
manifest to both A and B that F is manifest to them, and it is manifest to both A and 
B that it is manifest to them that F is manifest to them, etc.
Does mutual manifestness therefore incur the same problems of mutual knowl￾edge? It is not hard to realize that, as a matter of fact, it does not, because the notion 
of manifestness is not as strong as the notion of knowledge from a cognitive point 
of view. In particular, the most striking difference is that it is in effect possible for a 
fact to be mutually manifest to two individuals as opposed to mutual knowledge that 
is not achievable by human subjects with fnite cognitive resources. This is because 
they do not have to actually form the series of all the recursive mental representa￾tions: they only have to be capable in principle to form any of them. And of course, 
in principle, they can do it (with the required amount of cognitive resources), 
because they do not have to form a mental representation of the nth fact of the series 
in order to be able to form a mental representation of the n+1th fact. The notion of a 
mutual cognitive environment, then, can be defned as follows:
The mutual cognitive environment of A and B is the set of facts that are mutually 
manifest to A and B. 
Any fact F that is part of a mutual cognitive environment is manifest to the indi￾viduals who share it, and it is manifest to them that F is manifest to them. Clearly, 
this is a recursive defnition (for if the fact that it is manifest to the individuals that 
F is manifest to them is part of the mutual cognitive environment, then in turn such 
a fact must be manifest to them too). As we have seen, however, this recursion is still 
plausible from a cognitive point of view.
It is important to realize that mutual manifestness could not be a substitute for the 
notion of mutual knowledge in the code model; in fact, the code model requires that 
communicators be guaranteed to have the same information at their disposal to cod￾ify and decodify messages. Mutual manifestness does not provide such a guarantee. 
Even if a fact is mutually manifest to the speaker and the audience, the speaker has 
no guarantee that the audience will form a mental representation of it during the 
process of interpretation of their utterances. The notion of a mutual cognitive envi￾ronment makes a cognitively plausible sense of what is for two individuals to share 
information in communication, but it essentially calls for a different account of 
communicative phenomena.
7 Relevance Theory99
Relevance and Information Processing
The notion of a cognitive environment is designed to characterize the information 
an individual has at their disposal on a given occasion; in effect, cognitive subjects 
always require information to perform tasks in their environment. Generalizing, we 
could say that every performance of a cognitive task requires the processing of some 
information. Consider a chess player who is pondering their next move. To calculate 
their best option, they need to have information about the rules of the game, the 
positions of the pieces on the chessboard, their opponent’s style of play, and so on. 
But the observation is also true for less complex tasks performed by cognitively less 
complex individuals. Male hoverfies, for instance, are usually busy intercepting 
passing females. To dart in the right direction they need to have information about 
objects passing by, their velocity and their trajectory. Unfortunately for both the 
chess player and the hoverfy, the complexity of the tasks they are busy with exceeds 
their respective cognitive abilities. The chess player is unable to mentally represent 
every possible confguration that may result from any of the moves they have at their 
disposal, so sometimes they choose the wrong move. The hoverfy is unable to per￾ceptually distinguish females from other moving objects; therefore, sometimes he 
darts at distant planes or even predators. Since they have limited cognitive resources, 
they are forced to adopt suboptimal strategies if they must act anyway: in informa￾tion processing, they need to favor effciency over accuracy. Sperber and Wilson’s 
notion of relevance can be conceived as an analysis of the sort of effciency that 
characterizes the processing of information by human cognitive subjects.
An Attentional Bottleneck
Now, the concept of effciency may sound like a vague one if it is not applied in 
relation to specifc contexts, to the performance of specifc tasks. A performance is 
usually said to be effcient because it optimizes the ratio between different param￾eters: commuting effciently, for instance, is a matter of traveling from home to 
work and back in the safest, quickest, less expensive, and less stressful way.3
 What 
are then the parameters that infuence the effciency of information processing? To 
answer this question, it is important to realize what is a specifc kind of task infor￾mation processing for a cognitive subject.
Let us consider a very simple cognitive task by way of example: suppose you 
have to exit the room you are in. To perform such a task, you obviously need certain 
3Some tasks are characterized in such a way that performing them effciently is simply a matter of 
achieving one single goal, such as getting your driving license and running a marathon. These 
characterizations, however, tend to single out the one goal to achieve by bracketing or fxing the 
other parameters; after all, you can get your driving license or run a marathon more or less easily, 
in more or less time.
Relevance and Information Processing100
physical abilities. But you also need information about your position in the room, 
the position of the exit, and the path to navigate toward it. Suppose this is all the 
information you need to exit the room: in this case, you could certainly obtain it by 
perception or even by memory. But is that the only information you have at your 
disposal in such a situation? Through perception, you could obtain information 
about the color of the ceiling above you, the size of the chair you are sitting in, and 
so on. From memory, you could obtain information about the name of your frst 
love, the statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and so on. Certainly, that would be 
a massive amount of information; and yet, only a very limited subset of it is truly 
essential for you to process in order to perform the task of exiting the room. 
Apparently, you are able to unconsciously select such a subset from all the rest. If 
you had to process all the information that you had at your disposal, you could be 
easily overwhelmed and maybe even fail to exit the room at all. In psychology, the 
phenomenon has been described in terms of the picture of an “attentional bottle￾neck” (originally in Broadbent, 1958) (Fig. 7.1).
The idea is that individuals have a limited number of cognitive resources they 
can use at one time to process information, and, as a result, they have somehow to 
flter the information upon which to place their attention (just like the narrow neck 
of a big bottle flters the fuids fowing through it). Naturally, the information that 
passes through the flter should be the most relevant for the individual at that time, 
that is, the information that is essential for the task the individual is performing. 
Since any cognitive task requires information processing, the problem of fltering 
relevant information can be considered a general one:
[A]n individual’s particular cognitive goal at a given moment is always an instance of a 
more general goal: maximising the relevance of the information processed. (Sperber & 
Wilson, 1986, p. 49)
The more relevant the information selected, the more effcient is the processing. The 
more effcient the information processing, the easier it will be for an individual to 
perform their cognitive tasks. In this sense, building an effcient cognitive environ￾ment can be considered a general purpose for an individual.

Processing Effort and Contextual Effects
By way of introduction, let us begin by noticing that the processing of any informa￾tion is always performed with respect to other information. It therefore makes sense 
to distinguish, in principle, the information to be processed from the context of the 
information with respect to which it is processed. Evidently, the context is not given 
but is constructed by an individual in a specifc situation for the processing of spe￾cifc information.
Even without committing to any particular theory of the mind and its function￾ing, it is reasonable to assume that there are at least three sources from which indi￾viduals can obtain the information they need to construct their contexts: perception, 
memory, and inference. Perception is often conceived as an immediate source of 
information, in the sense that through perceptual experience, individuals can directly 
form mental representations about facts in the surrounding environment. As far as 
memory is concerned, cognitive sciences standardly classify it as a short-term and a 
long-term memory. Short-term memory is the mind’s ability to hold ready-to-use 
information for a short period of time and then delete it; for instance, information 
about the past exchanges in a conversation are made available by short-term mem￾ory. Long-term memory, instead, is conceived as a more permanent storage, where 
information is kept in an explicit form for an indefnite period of time. Finally, infer￾ence allows an individual to draw new, reliable information from that already pos￾sessed. It allows not only to extend the information at one’s disposal but also to 
minimize the amount that has to actually be kept in memory, provided the rest can 
be inferred from it. Clearly, these quick sketches hardly explain how our cognitive 
systems deal with information. For our purposes, however, it is suffcient to keep in 
mind that there are different sources of information and some of them require more 
effort than others to be retrieved and used: it is harder to recall the date of the Battle 
of Hastings than the content of one’s last utterance in a conversation; it is easier to 
perceive the color of the sky than to infer the identity of a killer from clues at a crime 
scene. As already noticed above, not all information in an individual’s cognitive 
environment is manifest to the same degree, as some information is more accessible 
than other. In this sense, some contexts are more accessible than others because 
retrieving and processing information to construct them requires different cognitive 
efforts. It is reasonable to assume that information processing will be more effcient 
if it requires less of these cognitive efforts. Other things being equal, an individual 
should focus their attention on the information requiring less effort to be processed. 
In effect, according to Sperber and Wilson, the processing effort is one of the param￾eters that determine the effciency of information processing.
The second parameter that they identify is more directly connected with the intu￾itive notion of relevance. As previously noticed, contexts typically vary from one 
occasion to another. Depending on what the individual is doing, they will perceive 
different things, make different reasonings and recall different things more easily or 
less easily. If Joan is going to the railway station to catch a train, her context will 
contain information about the weather, the train’s departure time, the street she is 
Relevance and Information Processing102
on, the direction she has to follow, and so on. The fact that not every information fts 
in a context as well as any other must now be taken into account. Think again about 
Joan hurrying to the station, and suppose that while crossing a square she notices 
some children playing with a ball. This is certainly information that becomes mani￾fest to her by perception, but it does not really interact with any of the information 
already present in her context. Suppose instead that she walks past a newsstand and 
reads that there is an ongoing transport strike. This information has several effects 
on her context for the performance of the task at hand. It will clearly be more eff￾cient on Joan’s part to employ her cognitive resources in processing the latter rather 
than the former information. But how can an individual sort out the information that 
better fts in the context and is thus worth processing? Obviously, the problem here 
is to specify what it means for an information to “ft” into a context. A context con￾tains the information an individual is using to perform a cognitive task in a given 
situation; therefore, it must provide a useful and reliable representation of the world 
in which the individual’s performances take place. In this sense, any information 
that may refne and improve this representation is worth processing on that occa￾sion. There are several different ways in which new information may improve a 
context. First, it may allow new conclusions to be drawn from the information 
already contained in it; for instance, if it is already manifest to Joan that trains are 
likely to be canceled because of transportation strikes, she will be able to infer from 
the information regarding the ongoing strike that her train has probably been can￾celed. Second, new information may improve a context by canceling old informa￾tion already contained in it; thus, the new information obtained by Joan regarding 
the probable train cancelation contradicts the information about her train’s depar￾ture time and consequently, Joan’s old information gets canceled. It is not always 
the case, obviously, that a contradiction is resolved in favor of the new information. 
The new information might be rejected when it contradicts old information that is 
particularly strong in the cognitive environment of an individual. Suppose Mary had 
just called Joan to say that she is already on the train Joan is trying to catch, and the 
train is on schedule. In this situation, Joan will probably drop the inference that her 
train has been canceled, because she more strongly believes that her train is on 
schedule. Focusing on the strength with which information is present in a cognitive 
environment brings to light a third way in which new information may improve a 
context, namely by modifying the strength of the information already present within 
it. Suppose, for instance, you have listened to the weather report in the morning 
announcing that it is rainy today and, as a result, you believe it with a certain convic￾tion. Later, you see with your own eyes that it is indeed raining and, consequently, 
the fact that it is rainy today is manifest to you more strongly. If you see the sun 
shining instead, your confdence in the weather report may decrease, and the fact 
that it is rainy today is manifest to you less strongly. The modifcation of the strength 
of a piece of information already present in the context is an improvement, because 
it refnes an individual’s representation of the world. Sperber and Wilson call these 
ways to improve the context of old information contextual effects. The more contex￾tual effects a new information has, the more effcient it will be for an individual to 
7 Relevance Theory103
process it; thus, contextual effects are to be considered the second parameter that 
determines the effciency of information processing.
It is important to point out that cognitive efforts and contextual effects are non￾representational aspects of information processing in the sense that they are not 
represented by our cognitive systems. A cognitive system endures certain efforts to 
produce certain contextual effects while processing certain information I, but the 
mental representation of those cognitive efforts and contextual effects is not part of 
the processing of I. This is clearly apparent in our experience of information pro￾cessing. Besides, if it weren’t so, the new mental representations would constitute 
themselves as further information to be processed, in an endless regress that would 
easily consume our limited cognitive resources.
Relevance
The limited number of cognitive resources that we have at our disposal forces us to 
face the problem of maximizing the relevance of the information we process. We 
have pointed out two parameters that infuence the effciency of information pro￾cessing. The next step is to characterize the notion of relevance in terms of these. 
One might think of a very basic defnition along the following lines:
(R) A piece of information is relevant to an individual if it has at least one contex￾tual effect in at least one of the contexts accessible to them.
This defnition identifes the class of relevant information for an individual in a 
context, in the sense that it allows the classifcation of information into those that 
are relevant and those that are irrelevant to the individual in the context. For instance, 
the information that you are reading a book is not relevant to you now, because you 
already have it in your context, and it has no contextual effect. Similarly, the infor￾mation that you are a brain in a vat connected to a computer-simulated reality is not 
relevant to you now because your contextual information that is incompatible with 
it is so strong that it would be discarded without producing any contextual effect. 
Unfortunately, this defnition does not really allow understanding of how our cogni￾tive systems can sort out the relevant information on which to focus our attention. 
In fact, the problem that our cognitive system must solve to cope with the attentional 
bottleneck is not to classify information as relevant and irrelevant, but to compare 
the relevance of information. In this sense, the notion of relevance must admit 
degrees.
To address this point more precisely, Sperber and Wilson appeal to a distinction that 
the logician and philosopher Rudolph Carnap drew among different kinds of concepts, 
an exercise which might be useful to carry out here. Carnap (1962, 1966) distinguished 
between classifcatory, quantitative, and comparative concepts. Classifcatory concepts 
either apply or do not apply to any given object and are used to classify entities into 
different sorts. Concepts such as electron, car, and prime number are classifcatory 
ones. Quantitative concepts ascribe a certain numerical value to objects and make the 
Relevance and Information Processing104
world measurable. Concepts such as temperature and length are quantitative ones. 
Comparative concepts characterize objects in comparison with others. They allow us 
to draw comparisons even in the absence of a numerical value. Concepts such as sweet
and hot are comparative concepts in this sense. One can therefore say that something 
is hot, tout court, only by implicitly referring to the average; besides, one can judge 
whether x is hotter than y even without a measurement of the temperature of x and y.
Clearly, for the purpose of characterizing effcient information processing, rele￾vance is to be considered neither a classifcatory nor a quantitative concept, but a 
comparative one. Our cognitive systems must be able to compare information and 
drive attention to that which is more relevant. The two parameters of processing 
efforts and contextual effects explain how this can be done. Generally speaking, on 
the one hand, the less processing efforts information requires, the more relevant it is, 
while, on the other hand, the more contextual effects information produces, the more 
relevant it is. More specifcally, the idea is that information processing can be 
described along the following lines (cf. Fig. 7.2). In order to process new informa￾tion, an individual has to construct a context C1. The construction of C1 consists in 
the retrieving of other information from perception and memory, and this requires 
certain cognitive efforts. Such efforts, however, may be compensated by the cognitive 
benefts resulting from the effects that the new information may have in C1. If the 
benefts do not compensate the efforts, the context may be further extended to C2 by 
retrieving even more information and seeing whether in the richer context, the new 
information may have more contextual effects. Certainly, context C2 could be further 
extended to C3 with even more effort, but it is not always the case that a greater num￾ber of cognitive efforts corresponds to a signifcant extension of the context.
Let us say that information is optimally processed when the best possible balance 
is achieved between cognitive efforts and contextual effects. We can thus defne 
comparative conditions for the relevance of information to an individual: Processing Effort
Contextual Effects

(R1) Information is relevant to an individual to the extent that the contextual effects 
achieved when it is optimally processed are large.
(R2) Information is relevant to an individual to the extent that the effort required to 
process it optimally is small.
This defnition allows a better characterization of the comparison between different 
information. In this sense, in fact, a piece of information will be more relevant than 
another if it obtains a better balance between cognitive efforts and contextual effects 
when it is optimally processed.
Ostension and Communication
Relevance is a property of the information that is worth processing by a cognitive 
system with limited resources. As Sperber explains, “cognitive effciency is a matter 
of investing effort in processing the right inputs” (Sperber, 2005) and relevance is 
how our mind selects them. In this regard, relevance is primarily a notion that applies 
to information processing rather than communication, and yet as such, it dismantles 
an implicit assumption of the code model that not even Grice really put into ques￾tion, namely the idea that the processes of taking in, storing, and using information 
are not problematic and do not pose any explanatory constraint. If this assumption 
is rejected, then communication cannot be described as the activity of transferring 
information. In Sperber and Wilson’s approach, information cannot simply be trans￾ferred from an individual to another, because they need to select it for its relevance. 
We are now in the position to understand how this cognitive analysis of information 
processing relates to the inferential account of communication as a practice in which 
the speakers’ intentions generate expectations in the audience who recognizes them.
Ostensive Stimuli
We have noticed that perceptual experience can be considered the most obvious and 
recurring source of new information. When a cognitive subject receives a perceptual 
stimulus, it is treated according to its relevance: the cognitive system allocates 
resources to process it as long as the efforts are compensated with the beneft of 
contextual effects. Now, communicative stimuli are in actual fact perceptual stimuli 
as well; therefore, what difference does it make for an individual to process a stimu￾lus produced inside a communication exchange? Let us try to see by adapting an 
original example of Sperber and Wilson’s. Obviously, the point regards both verbal 
and nonverbal communicative acts, but it is easier to make the difference stand out 
by considering similar sorts of stimuli in nonverbal communication. Let us there￾fore fst consider the following situation:
Mary and Joan are sitting on a bench in a park waiting for their mutual friend Paul. Suddenly, 
the wind, gently blowing through the trees, moves the branches of a willow. Thus, Joan 
notices Paul approaching.
Ostension and Communication106
In this situation, the wind reveals a scene to Joan by moving the branches. By pro￾cessing this stimulus, she fnds the information that Paul is approaching quite rele￾vant, because it produces interesting contextual effects such as, for instance, that 
they are about to leave since Paul is arriving. Now compare this situation with the 
following one:
Mary and Joan are sitting on a bench in a park chatting with each other. Suddenly Mary 
notices their mutual friend Paul approaching just behind her. She therefore bends back for 
Joan to see him.
Mary’s move is a communicative act. To understand why, we can apply the Gricean 
analysis of speaker’s meaning. Unlike the wind, Mary has the informative intention 
to make manifest to Joan that Paul is approaching and the communicative intention 
to make manifest to her that she has such an informative intention. In this second 
situation, Joan again processes the information that Paul is approaching and infers 
the contextual effect that they are about to leave. The difference between the two 
situations is that in the latter, as opposed to the former, the stimulus that Joan pro￾cesses is intentionally produced by Mary as a communicative act to make some￾thing manifest to Joan. Sperber and Wilson call ostensive behavior any such 
behavior.
An ostension is a behavior that makes mutually manifest the intention to make man￾ifest some information.
Now, Sperber and Wilson accept the Gricean analysis of the intentions involved 
in ostensive acts and acknowledge that a communicative act is produced with the 
following:
(a) The informative intention to make manifest or more manifest to the audience a 
set of assumptions I.
(b) The communicative intention to make it mutually manifest to the audience and 
the communicator that the communicator has the informative intention (a).
It is easy to realize that in this sense ostension and communication coincide: an 
ostensive behavior is performed with the communicative intention of making an 
informative intention manifest. We can then rephrase the difference between the two 
situations considered above by saying that Mary’s, but not the wind’s, stimulus is 
ostensive. But now our question becomes: How does the fact that a stimulus is rec￾ognized as an ostensive one make any difference for an individual who processes it?
The Principle of Relevance
We must keep in mind that the most important feature of communication disclosed 
by Grice is the fact that communicative acts make the speakers’ intentions manifest, 
generating expectations in the audience. In his account, the expectations are charac￾terized in terms of the Principle of Cooperation so that to interpret the 
7 Relevance Theory107
communicative behavior of the speaker as a rational one, even when it violates 
Conversational Maxims, the audience is authorized to take conversational implica￾tures to be part of what they mean. As we have just recalled, Sperber and Wilson 
endorse Grice’s intentional analysis, but cooperation has no role to play in their 
account of communication. The recognition of an ostensive stimulus still generates 
certain expectations but they must be of a different sort.
Think again about Mary who ostensively leans back on the bench to let Joan see 
the scene behind her. They are sitting in a park; therefore, suppose that what she can 
see behind Mary are children playing, dogs running, ice cream sellers, people jog￾ging, people laying on the grass, plants, fowers, and so on. In this scene full of 
information, there is also Paul barely noticeable in the distance; it therefore takes 
Joan some time to spot and recognize him. To process the perceptual information 
that Mary’s ostension makes manifest to her, Joan has to make quite a number of 
cognitive efforts to obtain the contextual effects that compensate them. Why is she 
willing to make them? What makes her so sure that her efforts will be compensated? 
Clearly, it must be the fact that she has recognized Mary’s intention to make some￾thing manifest to her. Mary performed an ostensive behavior to make mutually 
manifest to them that she had an informative intention toward Joan. According to 
Sperber and Wilson’s account of information processing, however, for certain infor￾mation to be manifest to Joan, it should be relevant to her. Thus, given how Joan’s 
cognitive system process information, Mary’s informative intention can only be sat￾isfed if what she intends to make manifest to Joan is relevant enough to her. Joan is 
therefore authorized to expect that the efforts she will make in processing the infor￾mation made manifest to her by Mary’s ostensive stimulus will be compensated by 
enough contextual effects to make it relevant to her. The expectations generated by 
the recognition of the speaker’s intention in a communicative act in this case are 
expectations of relevance.
Let us consider another situation for a comparison. Suppose this time Joan does 
not recognize Mary’s ostensive behavior: when Mary leans back, Joan thinks that 
she is merely stretching. The scene made manifest to Joan is the same as before, but 
will she be willing to make the same effort in this case? Clearly, if she does not 
recognize Mary’s ostension, she will not realize that Mary’s leaning back is inten￾tionally addressed to her, and she will treat it like the wind’s moving the branches 
of the willow. What Joan can do then is only process the information made manifest 
to her in order to select the relevant one, just like she does with any stimulus she 
perceives; but she has no expectation that she will fnd any. Specifcally, she may not 
be willing to make the cognitive efforts required to process the information and 
notice that Paul is approaching. Consequently, she will miss the contextual effects.
In this sense, it is cognitively more effcient for an individual to spend cognitive 
efforts in processing communicative acts rather than other phenomena, because 
ostensive stimuli are designed to be relevant to them. A speaker who wants to make 
some information I manifest to the audience must produce a stimulus that is relevant 
enough for them to be processed and make I manifest to them in the processing. 
Thus, someone who recognizes the informative intention of the speaker is 
Ostension and Communication108
authorized to presume that the speaker’s stimulus will be relevant to them in the 
following sense:
Presumption of optimal relevance:
(a) The set of information I which the communicator intends to make manifest to 
the addressee is relevant enough to make it worth the addressee’s while to pro￾cess the ostensive stimulus.
(b) The ostensive stimulus is the most relevant one the communicator could have 
used to communicate I.
This is the core of Sperber and Wilson’s ostensive-inferential model of commu￾nication, which they express in the form of the following principle:
Principle of Relevance:
Every act of ostensive communication communicates a presumption of its own opti￾mal relevance.
At this point, it is important to say a few things about how the Principle of 
Relevance compares to the Principle of Cooperation. Both principles characterize 
the expectations generated in the audience by the recognition of the speaker’s inten￾tions. Thus, having recognized the informative intention of the speaker, the audi￾ence will expect them to abide with the Conversational Maxims and produce an 
optimally relevant stimulus, in accordance with the Gricean and the Relevance 
Theory, respectively. In both theories, the audience must have meta-representational 
abilities to interpret the communicative behavior of the speaker as a rational one 
purported to satisfy their informative intention. Communication, however, is not at 
all conceived as a cooperative activity in Relevance Theory. This is the main differ￾ence with respect to the Gricean account. Grice characterizes a conversational 
implicature as a content the speaker wants to contribute to the conversation but is 
not explicitly expressed in what they say. As a result, the audience has to “mind￾read” the speaker to discover which among their possible beliefs would repair their 
apparent violation of the Principle of Cooperation. In Relevance Theory, instead, 
the audience does not look for implicatures in what the speaker believes but in the 
contextual effects they can autonomously obtain by processing the speaker’s stimu￾lus. Decidedly, the contextual information most likely to produce contextual effects 
is that which is mutually manifest to both the speaker and the audience, but it does 
not have to be so. While in the Gricean account the main responsibility regarding 
the satisfaction of the speaker’s informative intention is on the audience, who must 
infer what the speaker means, in Relevance Theory the main responsibility is on the 
speaker, who must provide just the right stimulus the processing of which on the 
audience’s part would make manifest to them precisely what the speaker intends. In 
other words, we could say that in Grice’s model the interpretation of what the 
speaker means depends more on what the speaker believes, while in Sperber and 
Wilson’s model it depends more on what is manifest to the audience. In fact, it is 
also important to notice that to the contrary of the maxim of Relation, the Principle 
of Relevance cannot be fouted or violated. On the one hand, the Principle of 
Cooperation characterizes the activity of communication: the Conversational 
Maxims that articulate it make explicit what one must do to be treated as engaged in 
7 Relevance Theory109
a conversation. On the other hand, the Principle of Relevance characterizes the way 
in which a cognitive subject processes information: it describes how our minds 
work. The communicator must take this cognitive fact into account and engineer 
their ostensive stimulus for it to be relevant to the audience; in fact, an ostension is 
a stimulus designed to be relevant to the audience. This is mutually manifest to both 
the communicator and the audience once the informative intention is recognized 
and is what the audience expects.
The Role of Contextual Information
It is useful to now consider a few examples of how Relevance Theory applies to the 
analysis of different sorts of communication exchanges. The frst one is very simple, 
but it illustrates how the relevance of information depends on the context. Suppose 
that Mary asks the departure time of the train and may receive three different 
answers from Joan:
(74) When does the train leave?
(a) After 15.00. 
(b) At 15.24.
(c) 36 minutes to 16.00.
Which one is the most relevant to Mary? Unquestionably, (b) is the most accurate 
one, so it seems it should also be the most relevant. Suppose, however, that Mary is 
walking to the station, the station is ten minutes away on foot, and it is 14.50. In this 
context, the most relevant stimulus will be (a), because it allows Mary to infer that 
she will be on time with the least amount of effort: (b) will give her too much infor￾mation to process, and (c) will force her to make more complex calculations. 
Clearly, (c) seems to be too extravagant to be relevant, and yet it could be relevant in 
a very extravagant context. Suppose that Mary is trying to catch the train to defuse 
a bomb on it, which will blow up at 16.00: in this case, (c) will be the most relevant 
stimulus because it will make manifest to Mary the amount of time she has to defuse 
the bomb with the least processing effort.
The second example is purported to show how contexts are constructed by indi￾viduals while processing the stimulus they receive. Consider the following 
conversation:
(75) Mary: I am sleepy
Joan: The moka pot is in the dishwasher.
Intuitively, Joan’s answer seems to be relevant to Mary, but why? Let us try to 
reconstruct how Mary processes Joan’s utterance from the point of view of Relevance 
Theory. Suppose (75) is the frst exchange of a conversation, and there is no context 
before it. So, when Mary receives Joan’s stimulus, her context contains only one 
piece of information that is manifest to her through perception:
(I1) Mary is sleepy
Ostension and Communication110
Clearly, Joan’s utterance cannot produce any effect on a context that only contains 
(I1). Thus, Mary has to extend it, and she can do it by adding, for example, the 
information that she can retrieve from the short-term memory of the conversation as 
well as the conversational implicatures that what she said have also made mutually 
manifest to Joan:
(I2) Mary said, “I am sleepy”.
(I3) Mary wants to be awake.
Still, Joan’s utterance is not relevant yet, and Mary has to access her long-term 
memory to get information concerning (I1)–(I3). She might thus extend the context 
with the following:
(I4) Drinking coffee wakes you up
However, that is still insuffcient. She must look again in her long-term memory for 
information regarding (I4); thus, for instance:
(I5) You can make coffee with the moka pot.
In the context extended with (I1)–(I5), Joan’s stimulus has contextual effects that 
are benefcial to Mary.
She can in fact infer that:
(I6) Mary can grab the moka pot from the dishwasher, make coffee, drink it, wake 
up, and consequently get what she wants.
These are cognitive benefts that compensate Mary’s effort to construct a context in 
which to obtain them. In effect, the processing efforts mainly consist in the con￾struction of a rich enough context to produce contextual effects.
Notice that (I6) is likely what Joan intended to be manifest to Mary with her 
ostensive stimulus so that Mary would satisfy her informative intention by inferring 
it. However, Joan’s utterance may also produce effects she didn’t intend it to. 
Suppose, in fact, it is also manifest to Mary (but apparently not to Joan) that:
(I7) Washing a moka pot with soap makes coffee taste awful.
As part of the contextual effects that Mary could obtain in the context (I1)–(I7), she 
might also draw the following inferences:
(I8) The coffee will taste awful.
(I9) Joan shouldn’t have washed the moka in the dishwasher.
(I10) Joan is a pest.
Undoubtedly, (I10) is not part of what Joan meant, but it is something made mani￾fest to Mary by processing her ostensive stimulus. In this sense, ostensive stimuli 
can communicate more than what the communicator intends them to make manifest 
to the audience.
The third example is purported to show that ostensive stimuli can communicate 
even if the communicator does not intend them to make manifest to the audience 
any specifc information. Suppose that Mary and Joan have been walking up a 
7 Relevance Theory111
mountain, and they have just reached the top. Mary smiles and enjoys the view for 
a while, then turns to Joan and, while looking at her, inhales deeply. In this case, the 
stimulus is the following:
(76) Mary inhales deeply.
Clearly, Mary’s behavior is ostensive, and Joan has no problem recognizing her 
intention. But what is the information that Mary wants to make manifest to Joan 
with (76)? We can make various hypotheses:
(a) The air is clean.
(b) I am happy.
(c) At last, we are here.
⋮
Any of these could be inferred by Joan while processing (76), so which of them 
is the right one? In this case, however, it is reasonable to say that this question does 
not really make sense. It is reasonable to suppose that Mary does not have any spe￾cifc information in mind to make manifest to Joan: she probably just wants her to 
think about the kind of facts (a), (b), (c), …, and if any of them is made manifest to 
Joan, her informative intention is satisfed. Relevance Theory allows an account of 
this type of situation because the information that ostensive stimuli make manifest 
to the audience is manifold and may vary according to how the context is 
constructed.
Relevance at Play: Cognitive Environments, Echo Chambers, 
and Fake News
All these examples show that the main problem for the communicator is to design a 
stimulus that will make manifest to the audience what they intend. On the one hand, 
in order to solve this problem, the communicator must take into account the efforts 
that the audience is likely to be willing to make in a given situation; for instance, if 
a speaker is talking to people hanging out at a café, the speaker must realize that 
stimuli requiring too much effort to be processed will hardly be relevant to them; if, 
to the contrary, the speaker is giving a lecture to a motivated and attentive audience, 
the speaker could might safely assume that they will accept to make stronger efforts 
to obtain contextual effects. On the other hand, the speaker must take into account 
the information that is manifest to the audience and anticipate how it will construct 
the context to process the speaker’s stimulus. This can obviously be done by taking 
advantage of the mutual cognitive environment they share.
All this is of particular importance when the communicator realizes that the 
information they want to make manifest to the audience contradicts something that 
is strongly manifest to it. In such a case, in fact, it is very diffcult to design stimuli 
relevant to the audience. Quite interestingly, this is a problem of communication 
that has always troubled philosophy, at least since Socrates’ death sentence (399 
BC). Plato depicted it vividly in the so-called Allegory of the Cave. In Book VII of 
Ostension and Communication112
the Republic, Socrates narrates the story of a group of men born and living chained 
in a cave, facing a blank wall. They see the shadows of the objects passing in front 
of a fre placed behind them projected on this wall. These shadows are all they have 
ever seen of the world; therefore, they take them to be the things in themselves. 
Eventually, one of the men, the philosopher, frees himself, escapes the cave, under￾stands the illusion by which he had lived, and learns how real things look like in the 
sunlight. This, of course is a metaphor for philosophical knowledge. Plato noticed, 
however, when the philosopher tries to reveal what he has discovered in his journey 
to the laypeople vexed with appearances and wrong opinions that they will most 
likely reject the truth:
Now if once again, along with those who had remained shackled there, the freed person had 
to engage in the business of asserting and maintaining opinions about the shadows […] 
would he not then be exposed to ridicule down there? […] And if they can get hold of this 
person who takes it in hand to free them from their chains and to lead them up, and if they 
could kill him, will they not actually kill him? (Republic, VII 516e–517a)
References to the Allegory of the Cave are pervasive in Western thought: it has been 
brought back and modulated countless times in many forms. Let us consider, for 
instance, a recent sci-f adaptation of this well-worn philosophical myth. The Matrix 
is a 1999 movie describing a dystopian future in which machines have subjugated 
human beings. People spend their lives plugged into a computer simulation, the 
Matrix, which provides them with the neurological stimuli to make them believe 
they live in the world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. When Morpheus, 
a leader of the human rebellion, wakes up the protagonist, Neo, to this grim reality, 
he points out: “Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see 
it for yourself.” His point, in effect, could be put just in terms of the Relevance 
Theory. No one could ever tell anyone else:
(77) You are living in the Matrix.
This is because such a stimulus would simply be rejected as inconsistent with the 
most part of one’s strongest beliefs, and it would not produce any contextual effect 
at all; thus, Morpheus must provide Neo with stimuli that could be relevant enough 
to be processed by him, and let him eventually infer (77) as a contextual effect.
Philosophical issues aside, the problem of developing strategies to communicate 
with people who are unwilling to accept what is communicated is quite general, and 
it is very often experienced in public communication. Suppose someone wants to 
make manifest to a right-wing hate-oriented populist audience information that goes 
against their political beliefs, such as the following:
(78) European countries need migrants to avoid demographic and economic 
shrinkage.
The politician who would directly state (78) to such an audience would probably 
suffer the same fate as the philosopher in Plato’s allegory. If they want to be success￾ful, they should explore the mutual cognitive environment they share with their 
7 Relevance Theory113
audience and design ostensive stimuli that are less likely to be rejected as irrelevant, 
as, for example:
(a) The population in many European countries is declining.
(b) The gross domestic product of the working population is not enough to support 
the pension system.
⋮
Once the mutual cognitive environment is extended with this information and its 
contextual effects, it will also be easier to accommodate (78).
Ostensive stimuli in public communication, however, are not always designed to 
contrast the information in the audience’s cognitive environment. To the contrary, 
they often modify it by strengthening the information already contained within it. At 
times, this is a side effect of certain communicative practices, and, at other, it is 
done intentionally. An interesting example of the frst case is the phenomenon 
described as the forming of so-called echo chambers on social media. In 2018, the 
founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, was invited to testify at a US 
Senate hearing on data privacy. When Senator Orrin Hatch awkwardly asked him 
how Facebook could sustain itself given that users do not pay for its services, 
Zuckerberg smirked: “Senator, we run ads!” That was the undeniable truth of their 
business plan, yet only part of it. Social media companies such as Facebook and 
Google make money by determining the preferences of their users and hosting 
advertisement campaigns targeting groups of potential consumers selected accord￾ing to their preferences. The objective function of the algorithms elaborating aggre￾gate user data is to maximize their engagement. As a result of this market-oriented 
communicative strategy, which consists in submitting to the social platforms’ users 
only what matches their preferences,4
 these users tend to experience only stimuli 
corroborating the information that is already manifest to them. Users experience 
communication in a social network such as an “echo chamber”, which sends back 
to them the same contents they communicate through it. The contextual effects of 
these stimuli tend to strengthen certain information and prune off the potentially 
conficting ones (cf. Jamieson & Cappella, 2008). The cognitive environments of 
the users become particularly impervious to contrasting information, and it becomes 
increasingly more diffcult to design critical ostensive stimuli that could be relevant 
to them.
While echo chambers are mostly a consequence of certain marketing strategies 
in social media, the effects they have on cognitive environments are the very pur￾pose of those peculiar stimuli called “fake news”. To understand the phenomenon of 
fake news, it is obviously not enough to characterize it as false information: what 
must be explained is why it so easily becomes manifest and why people tend not to 
cast it aside even once is has been debunked. In effect, a fake news story is an 
4Notice that the contents that match a person’s preferences are not necessarily those that the person 
likes best. Engagement is more easily maximized by recommending contents that trigger faster 
reactions and therefore more interactions. Unfortunately, such reactions are often determined by 
negative feelings such as anger, discomfort, angst, and sadness (Lanier, 2018).
Ostension and Communication114
ostensive stimulus designed to be relevant to a specifc target. In this sense, fake 
news is easy to process because they mobilizes easy-to-access contexts, and it com￾pensates the cognitive subjects who process it with contextual effects which 
strengthen information that is already present in their cognitive environments. It is 
important to stress that fake news is target-specifc: not everybody is at risk of being 
misled by every fake news story, but only by those specifcally designed to be rele￾vant in a cognitive environment like theirs. In general, however, the effcacy of fake 
news on specifc individuals depends on the characteristics of their own cognitive 
environments. On the one hand, the less extended and articulated a cognitive envi￾ronment is, the more easily fake news will be processed and become manifest, 
because they will not have to be compared with other contrasting information. On 
the other hand, the less trained a cognitive subject is to make processing efforts, the 
less willing they will be of constructing a context in which a fake news story could 
be rejected, because it will have already produced gratifying effects at contexts 
which require less effort to be constructed.
Explicatures and Implicatures
In the previous sections, we have presented the core of Sperber and Wilson’s 
ostensive-inferential model of communication. As we have seen, it consists in a 
theory about how our cognitive systems process new stimuli applied to ostensions 
which generate certain expectations in communication exchanges. A few examples 
of the plasticity of this approach have been provided. In this section, we will further 
explore the explanatory power of this approach by testing it against fgures of 
speech, a linguistic phenomenon traditionally cryptic for the code model and seman￾tic analysis. There is, however, an issue with Relevance Theory that must be 
addressed before moving forward. Until now, we have talked generically about 
ostensive stimuli produced by the speaker, and we have described the pragmatic 
processes in terms of how they are understood by the audience. And yet, it seems 
that not all ostensive stimuli are the same as far as communication is concerned: 
some of them are utterances of sentences of a language. Can Relevance Theory 
account for such a difference? Is there a role for semantic content in this model?
Logical Forms
Given the analysis of the cognitive process that explains how ostensive stimuli are 
interpreted, if there is a role for the linguistic rules that defne semantic content, it 
must be in the relevance of linguistic stimuli. But what is a linguistic stimuli from 
the point of view of Relevance Theory? When a speaker makes an utterance, they 
intend on making manifest certain information to the audience by presenting a sen￾tence of the language in which they speak. As we have seen in Chap. 3, such a 
7 Relevance Theory115
sentence is constructed by applying the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic rules of 
the language. This means that such linguistic stimulus codifes certain information 
that the audience can retrieve by applying those rules. The information codifed in a 
linguistic stimulus is referred to as a logical form by Sperber and Wilson.
Now, logical forms are clearly not what is communicated by linguistic osten￾sions; we already noticed this while discussing the code model. The information 
codifed in a logical form is not even enough to deliver a propositional content: 
processes such as saturation, disambiguation, and free enrichment must be per￾formed to determine what is said by a sentence. Sperber and Wilson call the perfor￾mance of these processes the development of a logical form. The information made 
manifest as a result of the development of a logical form can be said to be “explic￾itly” communicated by the speaker’s linguistic ostension only in the sense that it is 
the information traditionally considered as codifed in linguistic signs. The develop￾ment of a logical form, however, is not to be construed by Sperber and Wilson as a 
specifc cognitive process distinct from standard information processing, as another 
interpretational ability independent from relevance. To the contrary, saturation, dis￾ambiguation, and free enrichment are guided exactly by the same criteria of effcacy 
that determine the interpretation of any ostensive stimulus, that is, by the goal of 
minimizing the processing efforts and maximizing the contextual effects. In this 
sense, the information retrieved by the development of a logical form is not to be 
construed as a semantically determined content, but as a pragmatically determined 
explicature (where the term “explicature” is obviously supposed to characterize it in 
contrast with implicatures, which are not communicated explicitly in Sperber and 
Wilson’s sense).
Let us now see how saturation and disambiguation, previously presented as 
semantic processes, can be construed instead in terms of the development of a logi￾cal form. As we have seen, saturation consists in the “contextual assignment of 
semantic values to the constituents of a sentence whose interpretation is context￾dependent” (Recanati, 2004a, p. 7). The semantic notion of saturation has it that 
certain expressions contain indexical components that require saturation with con￾textual information in order to deliver a full semantic value. According to Relevance 
Theory, the process is governed by the general purpose of maximizing the relevance 
of the processed information. Thus, suppose that someone receives an ostensive 
stimulus such as the following:
(29) I am here now.
(31) It is raining.
What they do is retrieve information that is manifest to them in order to construct a 
context in which to produce effects: in doing so, they will choose the contextual 
information that will allow them to produce the highest number of contextual effects 
with the least processing efforts; for instance, they will probably develop the logical 
form of (29) with references to the speaker and the place and time of the utterance, 
because the context in which “I” refers to the speaker, “here” refers to the place, and 
“now” refers to the time of the utterance is probably the most accessible one. The 
reason for this is that it is the one that most easily matches the grammatical 
Explicatures and Implicatures116
information recalled by the indexicals. Similarly for (31), the most accessible con￾text for the speaker will probably be one in which they can obtain the explicature 
that it is raining where the sentence is uttered.
According to Relevance Theory, the very same process is what takes place in the 
case of the processing of semantic or syntactic ambiguities. Consider again:
(32) Paul is taking a shot.
(33) Joan saw a man with a telescope.
Since there is no semantic or syntactic rule to guide the interpretation of the infor￾mation contained in a logical form, a cognitive subject must only maximize the 
relevance of the information they process by constructing a context in which to 
produce effects. The context requiring the least cognitive effort to be processed and 
produce effects will be the one that will provide the explicature. For instance, if it is 
manifest to the subject from their short-term memory that the conversation is about 
Paul’s photos, the context in which (32) is to be interpreted as “Paul is taking a pic￾ture” will probably be the most accessible one. In the case of (33), again, the subject 
will develop the logical form in the direction of the explicature that is supported by 
the most accessible context.
Notice that the subject is not compelled to develop a logical form with regard to 
the context that is most accessible to them. The reason why certain explicatures are 
less likely to be derived is not because they are excluded by semantic or syntactic 
rules, but because the other contexts that could provide them require much more 
cognitive effort to be compensated by contextual effects. Further ostensions on the 
speaker’s part, however, could make the subject revise their previous processing and 
choose other paths that lead to other explicatures.
Lexical Pragmatics
Free enrichment also contributes to the development of a logical form, but it deserves 
a specifc mention. As we presented in Grice’s analysis, it consists in the pragmatic 
completion of the semantic content of linguistic expressions, and it is “free” in the 
sense that it is not guided by syntactic or semantic rules (as is the case with the satu￾ration of indexicals). Since, according to Sperber and Wilson, the explicit level of 
content does not really exist, the phenomenon acquires an extremely general dimen￾sion in Relevance Theory. In fact, if linguistic expressions have no content indepen￾dently of the pragmatic processing of the ostensive stimuli containing them, every 
expression requires free pragmatic enrichment. In this sense, this approach calls for 
generalized lexical pragmatics.
Lexical pragmatics is a feld of research whose purpose is to investigate the pro￾cesses involved in the use of semantically underspecifed lexical items. It is usually 
conceived as regarding certain specifc uses of expressions. The two main processes 
usually acknowledged as determining or specifying the content of an expression in 
context are referred to as narrowing and broadening. The former produces a content 
7 Relevance Theory117
that is less general than the semantic one conventionally associated to a lexical item; 
on the contrary, the latter produces a more general content that can be applied in a 
larger number of cases. The two processes can easily be clarifed by means of some 
basic examples.
(79) Philosophers like to drink.
(80) This room is rectangular.
Let us consider (79) frst. If there were anything like semantic rules for the interpre￾tation of the utterance, its semantic content—that is, how the world must be in order 
for it to be true—would be different from what it intuitively means: in fact, (79) 
would be true even in a world in which philosophers only like to drink water. 
However, that is not what (79) intuitively means. If a speaker were to utter it, the 
information that they would make manifest to their audience would be something 
like the following: philosophers like to drink alcoholic drinks. The process of nar￾rowing is what allows specifying the content of “to drink” into “to drink alcoholic 
drinks”. The more specifc information is not provided by semantic rules, but sup￾plied by the audience as a result of the speaker’s utterance. Now, consider (80). I 
suppose you would take it as true of the room you are presently in. And yet, it is also 
very likely that your room is not literally rectangular: angles are not exactly 90°, 
walls are not exactly parallel, and so on. Here again, the content of sentence (80) can 
be thought as enriched with respect to the context you are in: this room is roughly 
rectangular. This time, the result of the enrichment is the determination of a broader 
content to be applied in your context.
According to the relevantist approach, both processes of narrowing and of broad￾ening are performed by spontaneous pragmatic inferences during the processing of 
information. One of the most popular ways to explain how these processes work in 
this framework is in terms of ad hoc concepts. The idea of an ad hoc concept is that 
our cognitive systems can construct non-lexicalized concepts “on the fy” on the 
basis of the encyclopedic information at our disposal and apply them to the under￾standing of a stimulus in the context at hand. The cognitive theory of ad hoc con￾cepts was originally developed by the American psychologist Lawrence Barsalou 
(1987, 1993), who argued that people can use various information from long-term 
memory to build new categories for specifc contexts and purposes. These are spuri￾ous categories such as “things to take on a camping trip”, “drink alcoholic drinks 
enjoyed by philosophers”, “roughly rectangular in the way rooms can be”, “dress to 
wear on a frst date”, and “enough drinkable milk to have breakfast”. As far as our 
purposes are concerned, the plausibility of the very cognitive processes that allow 
the construction of ad hoc concepts is not really an issue. Considerably more impor￾tant is that the possibility of constructing categories of this sort in specifc contexts 
provides an explanation for our ability to understand ostensive stimuli such as (79), 
(80), (73), and (46). According to Relevance Theory, the construction of ad hoc
concepts is clearly guided by the purpose of maximizing the relevance of processed 
information. The idea is that an ad hoc concept is constructed by using the contex￾tual information that is more accessible to produce the largest quantity of contextual 
effects.
Explicatures and Implicatures118
Implicatures
The most important result of the inferential model was the possibility of accounting 
for the implicit content in what the speaker means. Grice conceived conversational 
implicatures as belief contents that the audience ascribes to the speaker to rationally 
explain their communicative behavior. Instead, Sperber and Wilson only require the 
audience to expect that the speaker’s stimuli will be optimally relevant to them and 
then simply proceed to process them by constructing a suitable context in which to 
produce contextual effects. Thus, the speaker who wants to make manifest an 
implicit content to the audience must design a stimulus in such a way that the pro￾cessing of it will make manifest such a content to the audience as a contextual 
effect. In other words, an implicature is just information that the speaker wants to 
make manifest to the audience by making their stimulus relevant to it.
Notice that, in this sense, the notion of implicature is signifcantly more general 
than in Grice’s model; particularly, given how contextual effects are produced, it is 
reasonable to draw a distinction among implicatures between implicated premises 
and implicated conclusions. Although both implicated premises and conclusions are 
implicit contents made manifest to the audience through the processing of the 
speaker’s stimulus, the way in which they are in effect made manifest is different. 
An implicated premise is information provided by the audience in the process of 
constructing a context in which to produce contextual effects from the speaker’s 
stimulus. An implicated conclusion is information inferred in a context in the pro￾cessing of the speaker’s stimulus.
To clarify the distinction, it is worth considering once more our example (36):
Joan: Will you go trekking tomorrow?
Mary: Tomorrow I am moving to my new fat.
Implicated premises:
(a) If one is moving to a new fat, then one has no time to do anything time con￾suming that day.
(b) Trekking is time consuming.
(c) If one has not time to go trekking, one will not go trekking.
Implicated conclusion: I will not go trekking tomorrow.
Here, Joan retrieves information (a)–(c) from her memory to construct a context 
in which Mary’s utterance could have the contextual effects that compensate her for 
the processing efforts she has to make to satisfy the expectation that Mary’s osten￾sion is relevant to her. In this sense, (a)–(c) are implicated premises while the con￾textual effect inferred from them and the content of Mary’s utterance is the 
implicated conclusion.
7 Relevance Theory119
Poetic Effects
As we have already noticed, even if the speaker can try to anticipate and orient the 
way in which the audience processes their ostension, ultimately they have no con￾trol on what information will be manifest to the audience in the end; for instance, 
the audience may produce contextual effects beyond the particular information that 
the speaker intends to make manifest to it. This situation is allowed by Relevance 
Theory, and it is all but a limitation to its explanatory power. It is useful in this 
regard to distinguish between strong and weak implicatures: the former are what the 
speaker intends to communicate to satisfy their informative intention, and the latter 
are produced as a consequence of the processing of the speaker’s ostension under 
the assumption of its optimal relevance. Weak implicatures are an important com￾ponent of communicative practices. When they are numerous enough, they might 
even provide enough benefts by themselves to compensate the processing efforts 
required to produce them and vindicate the relevance presumption of an ostensive 
stimulus. Consider again example (76): by inhaling deeply and ostensively, Mary 
does not intend to make manifest to Joan any specifc strong implicature but rather 
many weak implicatures about her well-being in that situation. Mary’s ostension 
abides by Joan’s expectation of optimal relevance precisely because it allows her to 
infer all those weak implicatures.
According to Sperber and Wilson, weak implicatures are also essential to account 
for style and poetic effects. Consider, for instance, the following excerpt from the 
incipit of the 2001 movie Amélie:
(81) On September 3rd, 1973, at 6:28 pm and 32 seconds, a bluebottle fy capable 
of 14,670 wing beats a minute landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre. At the 
same moment, on a restaurant terrace nearby, the wind magically made two 
glasses dance unseen on a tablecloth. Meanwhile, in a 5th-foor fat, 28 Avenue 
Trudaine, Paris 9, returning from his best friend’s funeral, Eugène Colère 
erased his name from his address book. At the same moment, a sperm with one 
X chromosome, belonging to Raphaël Poulain, made a dash for an egg in his 
wife Amandine. Nine months later, Amélie Poulain was born.
The obvious observation that jumps to one’s mind at this point in the analysis of 
the theories of communication is that this contribution seems to blatantly fail any 
conversational expectation. Consider it, for example, from the point of view of 
Grice’s maxims: it is excessively informative, verbose, and obscure, and it is mostly 
irrelevant to the content of the movie. It is so much so that it does not seem to make 
sense as an ostensive stimulus, because it could never abide by the Principle of 
Relevance; and yet, it is an intuitively brilliant piece of communication. And weak 
implicatures account for this intuition. By processing (81), the audience produces 
abundant contextual effects that begin to construct the framework in which to under￾stand the narrative and poetic style of the entire movie.
Explicatures and Implicatures120
Figures of Speech
The greatest demonstration of the explanatory power of Relevance Theory is likely 
its ability to account for fgures of speech. This is a topic that typically troubles 
traditional analyses of semantic content in language and communication. In fact, 
fgures of speech can only be explained by introducing non-literal meaning, but it is 
not easy to explain how such meaning is determined and, especially, why it is used 
in place of the literal one.
Take metaphors, for instance. Metaphoric sentences are typically false.
(82) But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. (Romeo and Juliet, 2.2.2–3)
Juliet is not the sun, so what is it that Romeo is saying? According to Donald 
Davidson, for instance, he is not saying anything other than the false sentence 
“Juliet is the sun” (Davidson, 1978): metaphors mean just what they literally mean. 
They are not a semantic phenomenon, but a pragmatic one that must be understood 
by investigating how metaphoric sentences are used; in effect, Grice’s approach 
allows an account of the pragmatic meaning of metaphors. In the case of 
Shakespeare’s line, Romeo is fouting the maxim of Quality by saying that “Juliet is 
the sun” in order to generate the conversational implicature that Juliet is as beautiful 
as the rising sun.
The problem, however, is: Why should Romeo say something false to satisfy his 
informative intention by implicating something else? Would it not be more effcient 
for him to simply not use the metaphoric sentence? The Gricean model does not 
actually have an answer for this question. Let us try then to raise it in the framework 
of the Relevant Theory. Here, the Principle of Relevance dictates that Romeo should 
choose the most relevant stimulus for the audience; therefore, the problem is to 
explain how the metaphoric sentence could be more relevant than the nonmeta￾phoric one. By way of example, consider (82) again and compare it with the follow￾ing paraphrase.
It is night right now, and the light I now suddenly see coming from Juliet’s room while she 
opens the window and approaches the balcony, looks like the dawn to me. Just like the sun 
rises at dawn from the east, so Juliet goes out to the balcony. Like the rising sun, she is 
beautiful, she wakes up my senses, she seems to me the reason why the world, and myself, 
are alive.
Let us assume for the sake of argument that the one on the right is a good para￾phrase. In principle, a good paraphrase has the same meaning as the metaphor it 
explains. If this is the case, then both the metaphor and the paraphrase make mani￾fest the same information but, of course, there is a difference in how they do it, 
because the metaphor and its paraphrase are two different sorts of ostensions. In the 
paraphrase, the information is made manifest as explicatures, which are obtained by 
developing the logical form of the stimulus. Since the paraphrase is typically a 
grammatically complex stimulus, this process requires considerable cognitive 
effort. In the metaphor, instead, the information is made manifest as implicatures, 
7 Relevance Theory121
that is to say, as contextual effects generated in the processing of the stimulus. Since 
the metaphoric sentence is quite simple from a grammatical point of view, its pro￾cessing will be easy, especially if the information required to generate the contexts 
to produce the effects is extremely accessible as is the case here. It is not diffcult to 
realize then that while the contextual effects of the metaphor and its paraphrase are 
(in principle) equivalent, the metaphor will require less processing effort and will 
therefore be a more relevant stimulus for the audience. It is for this reason that in 
these cases the speaker should choose the metaphoric stimulus over the literal in 
order to abide by the Principle of Cooperation.
Notice that this is a very elegant treatment of metaphors, especially if compared 
with traditional ones. Relevance Theory can easily be used to account for many 
other fgures of speech by applying the same rationale of the analysis of metaphors. 
In their original work, for instance, Sperber and Wilson provide an analysis of 
epizeuxis and zeugma (Sperber & Wilson, 1986, pp. 219–224). The relevantist tra￾dition has further explored the analysis of tropes and poetic effects (see, e.g., 
Pilkington, 2000).
Conclusions
Relevance Theory is an extremely bold enterprise which aims to provide a compre￾hensive explanation of communication phenomena by applying one single princi￾ple, the Principle of Relevance, which essentially connects ostension and information 
processing. By way of concluding this chapter as well as this part of the book, we 
now try to evaluate the pros and cons of this approach in order to draw some conclu￾sions about the general enterprise of defning a theory of communication.
Problems for Relevance Theory
According to Relevance Theory, a communication exchange consists in the inter￾pretation by the audience of an ostensive stimulus provided by the communicator. 
By recognizing a stimulus as an ostension, the audience recognizes the communica￾tor’s intention to make some information manifest to them. As a result, the audience 
will expect the communicator to design a stimulus to be cognitively convenient, that 
is, relevant to them. In other words, the audience will expect that the cognitive 
efforts it will produce while processing it will be compensated by an adequate num￾ber of contextual effects. Guided by this expectation, the audience will begin to 
construct a context in which to obtain such effects.
The main advantage of this model is likely that it does not require that the com￾municator and the audience share information before the exchange takes place, that 
is to say, before the communicator produces their ostensive stimulus. Naturally, the 
wider the mutual cognitive environment the communicator shares with the 
Conclusions122
audience, the easier it is for the communicator to produce a stimulus relevant to 
them; and yet, the mutual cognitive environment is not a precondition for commu￾nication, because the process of interpretation of the communicator’s stimulus can 
be, in principle, performed by the audience independently from the communicator’s 
beliefs. This certainly also means that communication could fail, in the sense that 
the communicator might fail to satisfy their informative intention. Notice, however, 
that this is not an explanatory faw in Sperber and Wilson’s theory: to the contrary, 
it explains exactly why communication fails, as in fact it sometimes does.
The explanatory power of Relevance Theory, however, is obtained together with 
(or, at the price of) certain questionable outcomes. One of the crucial ones is that it 
is not clear how the Principle of Relevance is satisfed in the processing of an osten￾sive stimulus. The principle describes a process that the audience’s cognitive system 
could not refrain from performing: indeed, that is simply how it works. But how is 
it that such a cognitive system comes to the point when it has determined the opti￾mal ratio between processing efforts and contextual effects so that it stops process￾ing a stimulus? Sperber and Wilson explain that the system stops when it has reached 
such an optimal ratio, but the only way we can tell that it has reached such a ratio is 
that it has stopped. This circularity seems to be even more problematic if we con￾sider that communication hinges on the expectations generated by the manifestation 
of the intentions of the communicators. If there is no way to determine when the 
audience will stop processing a stimulus, how can a communicator design an osten￾sion to make certain information manifest to them as a result of that very process￾ing? The satisfaction of the communicator’s intentions risks being accounted for as 
happening by mere chance.
A second problem with Relevance Theory is strictly connected with this frst 
one. Sperber and Wilson present their model as “a cognitive psychological theory” 
that may provide “an empirically plausible account of comprehension” (Sperber & 
Wilson, 2004). In this sense, they envisage empirical tests to verify the theory; for 
instance, they tried to measure the processing time (and thus plausibly, the effort) 
required to process different sorts of stimuli, to verify whether or not literal and 
metaphorical sentences are processed in the same way. However, since the Principle 
of Relevance is not as much a rule or a maxim as it is a description of how our cogni￾tive system processes information, it always applies and therefore cannot be falsi￾fed; thus, it cannot be the case that an interpretation expected according to Relevance 
Theory is contradicted by the intuitive interpretation provided by competent speak￾ers. Since no stimulus is processed independently of the principles of Relevance 
Theory, every behavior must be interpreted according to those principles. To falsify 
Relevance Theory, communicative acts which do not convey the expectation of 
maximal relevance should be identifed.
A third yet still important problem is that Relevance Theory does not take into 
account any non-cognitive aspects of communication, such as social roles, social 
propriety, emotional impact, and so on. For instance, the reasons why Mary’s answer 
in example (36) is accepted by Joan as a communicatively proper answer clearly not 
only have to do with the information made manifest to her but also with its social 
7 Relevance Theory123
appropriateness, especially in contrast with a rude denial.5
 Examples of this kind 
could easily multiply.
What Role is Left for Literal Meaning?
In the literature, however, the most discussed topic about Relevance Theory is the 
treatment it gives to literal meaning. As we have seen, in the relevantist model, lit￾eral meaning does not exist as an independent level of content pertaining to autono￾mous processes of interpretation. What can be referred to as literal content are 
explicatures. These, however, are not conceived as literally expressed by linguistic 
stimuli, but as the development of logical forms: they are information made mani￾fest to the audience as a result of applying the same sole process of interpretation of 
linguistic stimuli that is guided by the purpose of maximizing the relevance of the 
processed information. In this sense, while the grammatical information contained 
in the logical form of a linguistic stimulus is the basis from which the process of 
constructing contexts in which to obtain effects proceeds, there is absolutely no 
sense in which what is communicated is the literal meaning of the expressions of 
that as the stimulus.
This approach is supported by the strong intuition that expressions have the 
meaning they have only when they are interpreted in a context. The idea is that even 
if linguistic expressions had something like the conventional meaning that is usually 
ascribed to them, such a meaning would be enough to determine the explicit content 
that an expression is intended and understood to have in a context so that it must 
always be integrated by inferential processes. This intuition seems to be confrmed 
by the phenomenon of semantic underdetermination that is brought to light by lexi￾cal pragmatics; specifcally, the widespread occurrences of free enrichment seem to 
testify just against the notion of a literal meaning. In the philosophy of language, 
this stance against the notion of literal meaning has been defended by contextualist 
authors such as François Recanati (2004a, 2010).
There is another strong intuition, however, which contrasts the contextualist one. 
We frst highlighted it explicitly while discussing Searle’s objection to Grice’s 
5As already mentioned in Chap. 5, Grice suggested that cases of this sort could be accounted for 
in terms of his theory, by defning maxims of conversation appropriate for politeness. Brown and 
Levinson (1987) actually followed this suggestion and defned a model for the analysis of the 
interpretation of polite speech grounded in the idea that politeness is part of conversational coop￾eration because it contributes to preserve the “face”, that is, the public image, of the participants to 
a conversational exchange. As we will see in the second part of the book, the notion of “face” and 
the problem of preserving it play a signifcant role in the dynamics of confictual situations. An 
analysis of politeness can also be accommodated in the framework of Relevance Theory, where the 
acknowledgment of an intentional violation of the cultural assumptions of politeness or of their 
ostensive respect on the speaker’s part will orient the interpretation of their utterance by the audi￾ence who aims to maximize its relevance. See, for example, Escandell-Vidal (1998) and 
Jary (1998).
Conclusions124
analysis of speaker’s meaning. Searle noticed that speakers simply cannot make the 
expressions they use mean whatever they want. The intuition is that however seman￾tically undetermined, linguistic expressions have a meaning that is assigned to them 
by the rules of the language. It is an intuition, for instance, that makes sense of the 
existence of dictionaries: in a dictionary, the conventional meaning (or meanings) of 
the expressions of a language are given and then possibly specifed by giving exam￾ples of their use in different contexts. Minimalist philosophers of language such as 
Emma Borg (2004) have defended this intuition against contextualists.
Both the contextualist and minimalist intuitions are strong. Although incompat￾ible, they both shed light on what appear to be crucial aspects of language and com￾munication. On the one hand, the minimalist approach suggests that language has 
semantic rules that convey the minimal content of expressions. On the other hand, 
the contextualist approach fully vindicates the inferential process of interpretation 
of the use of linguistic expressions in different contexts. Both approaches, however, 
have their internal drawbacks. The minimalist has to postulate a variety of levels of 
meanings governed by different sorts of processes, while a contextualist risks loos￾ing the notion of literal meaning altogether. It is important to keep in mind that 
Relevance Theory supports a radical form of contextualism and bears the burden of 
its problems.
What Communication is not and What it Probably is
In this frst part, we have discussed various models for the theory of communication. 
In our analysis, we acknowledged that it is wrong to conceive communication sim￾ply as the transfer of information and language as a mere code. Even if there were 
rules to codify the way in which certain combinations of linguistic expressions are 
to be associated to certain contents, these would not be enough to determine the 
meanings that we communicate to each other. As Paul Grice frst noticed, the prac￾tice of communication is about manifesting one’s intentions to the audience and 
recognizing the intentions of the communicator. In this sense, communication 
requires complex meta-representational abilities which are probably available only 
to certain cognitive agents, namely human beings: we make sense of the behavior of 
our peers by ascribing to them beliefs, desires, and other mental states. Thus, the 
recognition of the communicator’s intentions toward the audience generates expec￾tations that guide the understanding of what is communicated. Such understanding 
largely employs inferential processes that make use of both linguistic and contex￾tual information. According to Relevance Theory, these inferential processes require 
cognitive efforts and consist in mobilizing the information that one has at one’s 
disposal, extending it and modifying it. As a result of a successful communication 
exchange, the information the communicator shares with the audience increases. In 
the relevantist framework, the information cognitive subjects consciously share is 
referred to as their mutual cognitive environment. In this sense, we can say that 
communication has the effect of extending the mutual cognitive environment of the 
7 Relevance Theory125
communicator and the audience. As we will see in the following parts of the book, 
this is crucial to account for the role of communication in confict transformation 
and organizing practices.
Chapter Summary
This last chapter of the frst part of the volume introduced and discussed the cogni￾tive approach to communication offered by Relevance Theory. We will use this 
approach as the basic analysis of communication for the rest of this book.
Relevance Theory has been developed by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson as a 
way to improve Grice’s legacy in the direction of cognitive sciences. At the core of 
Relevance Theory there is an account of how human cognitive systems process 
information. In a basic sense, a cognitive system is simply a system that can have 
representations of the environment and use them to perform tasks. We humans have 
mental representations and therefore we are, or we have, complex cognitive sys￾tems. We have at our disposal a cognitive environment composed of all the mental 
representations that we can form and accept as true of the world. We form mental 
representations with the information that we receive from the environment by per￾ception and store in memory. Our cognitive resources, however, are fnite; com￾pared to the huge amount of such information, we have at our disposal only a limited 
amount of attention that we can devote to our mental representations: we suffer 
from an attentional bottleneck. As a consequence of that, we face the problem of 
selecting the most useful information on which to put our attention. The solution of 
this problem depends on the context in which we have to make the selection: we 
must select the most relevant information in that context. According to Sperber and 
Wilson, our cognitive systems are able to select relevant information by automati￾cally and unconsciously estimating the ratio between the costs and benefts of pro￾cessing a stimulus. The benefts of processing a stimulus consist in the positive, 
contextual effects that it produces in our cognitive environments by improving our 
general representation of the world. The costs of processing a stimulus consist in the 
cognitive efforts that we must pay for processing it. The most relevant information 
is provided by a stimulus that obtains the best ratio between cognitive efforts and 
contextual effects when optimally processed. Our cognitive systems try to maxi￾mize the relevance of any stimulus that they process by constructing cognitive envi￾ronments in which to obtain as many contextual effects with as less cognitive efforts 
as possible.
So far, Relevance Theory is only an account of information processing; commu￾nication enters the picture only when ostension is considered. An ostensive stimulus 
is a stimulus produced with a communicative intention, that is, the intention of 
manifesting an informative intention. Sperber and Wilson agree with Grice that the 
recognition of a speaker’s informative intention generates expectations in the audi￾ence. In Relevance Theory, however, these are not expectations of cooperation but 
relevance: the speaker is expected to produce the most relevant stimulus for the 
Chapter Summary126
audience. This presumption of optimal relevance is how the speaker can orient the 
process by which the audience will interpret their communicative acts; the audience 
will try to maximize the relevance of the speaker’s ostensive stimuli by making 
cognitive efforts to construct a context in which to obtain the contextual effects that 
they expect, having recognized the speaker’s informative intention. The speaker 
must then calibrate their stimuli so that with a few cognitive efforts the audience 
may obtain the content that they want to communicate as a contextual effect.
This account has several interesting consequences. First, all interpretation is now 
conceived as consisting in the pragmatic, spontaneous, inferential processes of our 
cognitive systems that try to maximize relevance. Second, the notion of a literal 
meaning that sentences have independently of the context in which they are inter￾preted collapses. Linguistic stimuli do produce contextual effects together with lin￾guistic information, but they are not decoded: the linguistic information contained 
in the linguistic stimulus (its “logical form”) is processed as any other information 
by the cognitive system of the audience with the purpose of maximizing its rele￾vance (the result of this process is an “explicature”). Third, lexicon is also to be 
investigated by pragmatics. What words mean depends on the context in which they 
are applied, in the strong sense that ad hoc concepts and categories are created by 
cognitive processes of narrowing and broadening contents “on the fy” on the basis 
of contextual information.
Relevance Theory is a powerful framework in which phenomena that are hard to 
explain in traditional accounts of meaning and communication, such as poetic effects 
and fgures of speech, fnd elegant and compact analyses. However, there are also 
some problems with this framework. First, there is a certain circularity in the expla￾nation of the way in which a specifc interpretation of a stimulus is given: the inter￾pretation is obtained when a cognitive system has reached an optimal ratio between 
processing efforts and contextual effects, but the only way to establish whether such 
a ratio has been reached is by noticing that the process has stopped. Second, Sperber 
and Wilson intend Relevance Theory as an empirical account, but it is not obvious 
what sort of empirical evidence could falsify it, because it is always assumed that 
cognitive systems behave according to the Principle of Relevance. Third, Relevance 
Theory does not consider non-cognitive aspects of information processing.

The Role of Communication in Confict 
Transformation131
Chapter 8
What Are Conficts and Why Do They 
Occur?
The Theory of Conficts is usually conceived as a research feld in sociology or 
peace sciences. In principle, this is correct. The studies in this feld, however, have 
long brought to light the fact that communication plays a central role in the analysis 
of conficts and their dynamics. Researchers increasingly agree that the establish￾ment and strengthening of communicative practices is a key factor in the transfor￾mation of conficts and, possibly, their resolution. In effect, confict management is 
one of the felds today in which a communication scientist might be called on to 
exercise their knowledge and expertise. In the frst part of this book, we have argued 
that communication is not as much about transferring information as it is about 
extending and elaborating the information we share. Enlarging mutual cognitive 
environments is crucial for the parties in a confict to envisage possible solutions 
and lay the grounds for collaboration even if they do not share the same goals. This 
second part of the book is devoted to the presentation of the Theory of Conficts. 
First, a framework is developed for the analysis of confict phenomena, then their 
dynamics are examined, and, eventually, some strategies for confict transformation 
are considered. The present chapter preliminarily discusses the intuitive notion of a 
confict and some of the various ways in which it has been approached and under￾stood. To follow is the presentation of a non-exhaustive review of some historically 
relevant stances that have been put forth regarding the notion of confict in philoso￾phy and sociology.
The Idea of Confict
It is legitimate to say that the idea of confict has always been characterized by a 
certain ambivalence in the history of the Western thought. Conficts have been 
looked at in two radically different ways. On the one hand, they have been construed

negatively as the absence of order1
: a defective condition that should be overcome 
in order for things to return to their natural equilibrium. In this sense, for instance, 
nature and societies are often thought of as organisms, whose parts harmoniously 
contribute to the functioning of the whole; thus confict, qua disharmony, is a pathol￾ogy that should be cured in order for the organism to function properly again. On 
the other hand, conficts have also been construed positively as an integral part of 
reality or even as an operating principle of the world. Confict, in this sense, would 
be a condition dependent upon the nature of things, a condition in which things in 
the world naturally fnd themselves to be. According to this second perspective, 
conficts are seen not only as inevitable but also as what produces change and there￾fore as essentially contributing to the dynamics of nature and societies.
For the sake of illustration only, let us consider some historical examples of the 
way in which these two conceptions have been modulated by Western authors.
The Ancient World
According to Heraclitus, reality is a continuous and turbulent process in which 
objects incessantly come into and go out of existence, a process in which everything 
fows like a river in which you could not step twice (Cratylus, 402A): a broken glass 
is not the same glass as before, an old man is not the young man he once was, and 
so on. The motor of this fux is the confict of opposites: “confict [pòlemon]—he 
famously wrote—is the father of all” (DK22B53).
As we have seen, with the rise of the Greek poleis, the city-states of the ffth 
century BC, the refection on conficts focused on interpersonal and social ones. In 
this context, some thought of confict as a means for social success. A central part 
of the teaching of the Sophists was in fact devoted to strategies to prevail in public 
debates.
To the contrary of the Sophists, Plato construed the confict as disorder. In the 
third book of the Republic, he described an ideally ordered society as composed of 
three classes: the producers, who work and procure the goods necessary for every￾one, the guardians, who were warriors charged with the task of protecting the soci￾ety, and the philosophers, who govern the society for its own good. Such a tripartition 
corresponds to the articulation of the human soul which is composed of a desiring 
part, a spirited part, and a rational part (Rep. 435c–445e). Just like the good of the 
soul is to be well-harmonized and each part must fulfll its task, so too the society 
1Here the expression “negatively” should not be understood as implying a value judgment. 
Technically, to give a “negative defnition” of something is to defne it in terms of what it is not; for 
instance, negative theology defnes God only in terms of what God is not, since, it is argued, the 
infnite essence of God cannot be expressed positively. A negative conception of something in this 
sense is simply a conception that understands it as the absence of something else; thus, void is just 
absence of matter.
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?133
fourishes when there is no confict among its parts. Justice for Plato is harmony 
between the parts of a well-organized society (Rep. 434c).
In his Politics also, Aristotle describes a city-state as a community of individuals 
who fulfll certain functions to satisfy certain needs and pursue certain interests 
(Pol. III.1.1275b20). Just as an organism has a soul, so a city-state has a constitution 
which organizes the functions performed by the citizens to achieve a “good life” 
(Pol. I.2.1252b29–30). A just constitution should always aim for the common 
advantage over the private one (Pol. III.6.1279a17–21). To obtain the maximum 
justice in certain given circumstances, however, constitutions should be modulated 
by considering the nature of the men they rule. In the ideal constitution for fully 
moral citizens which Aristotle describes in books VII and VIII, men achieve happi￾ness by virtuously performing the functions that best contribute to the common 
advantage.
The Debate on Modern Jusnaturalism
The process of creation and stabilization of modern nation states in Europe spanned 
the ffteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. This process consisted in the cen￾tralization of power and sovereignty together with the diffusion of bureaucracy, as a 
means of administration. The state acquires the monopoly of the legitimate use of 
violence and guarantees the law and its uniformity. This process posed several ques￾tions to political theorists. How do these political organizations rise from the social 
interactions in which humans naturally partake? What justifes their sovereignty? 
What rights do people have under them?
Modern jusnaturalists such as Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf stressed the 
distinction between the positive laws defned by men to govern their communities 
and institutions and the natural law based on nature and derived by reason. In his 
treatise De Iure Belli ac Pacis (1625), Grotius opposed the arbitrarity and relativity 
of positive laws to the rationality and universality of natural law. The latter, he 
noticed, essentially descends from human nature and is necessary like the principles 
of mathematics which not even God could change. In this sense, he drew a crucial 
distinction between divine right and natural right. What is right according to natural 
law is what conforms to human rationality, and what goes against it is irrational and 
has to be banned. Men establish laws when they associate together in a social con￾tract that gives rise to the state to defend themselves from the violence of the natural 
condition. By means of the social contract, a sovereign is conferred with the author￾ity and the power to enforce social order and peace. The positive (or civil) laws 
established by the sovereign, however, should conform to natural law and thus to 
rationality. Grotius therefore argues that the people who stipulate the social contract 
retain their rights even if they are transferred to the sovereign, and they are entitled 
to punish the sovereign who abuses his powers.
The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is also often brought alongside the 
jusnaturalist tradition. This is done with good reasons since he too discusses the 
The Idea of Confict134
consequences of the social contract regarding the rights men have in the state of 
nature. Hobbes’ explicit project in political philosophy, however, was essentially to 
defne the rational principles of a state that could preserve itself by avoiding internal 
disaggregating dynamics; in effect, he had in mind the process that led to the disag￾gregation of the English monarchy that resulted from the Civil War in the mid￾seventeenth century and that he himself had experienced. According to Hobbes, the 
confict of all against all (bellum omnium contra omnes) is a natural condition for 
human beings: men compete to the death over material things, security, and reputa￾tion. In the Leviathan (1651), he explains that competition arises because humans 
have roughly equal abilities and potential:
From this equality of ability ariseth equality of hope in the attaining of our ends. And there￾fore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they 
become enemies; and in the way to their end (which is principally their own conservation, 
and sometimes their delectation only) endeavour to destroy or subdue one another. 
(Leviathan, Ch. XIII)
The way out of this state of nature is the institution of an unnatural condition: by 
following one’s self-interest, everyone rationally decides to submit to a unique sov￾ereign that imposes a lawful order with the strength and the monopoly of violence. 
For Hobbes, the social contract is a pact of subjection (pactum subiectionis) in 
which everyone alienates one’s rights to the sovereign to put an end to the state of 
nature. In Hobbes’ view, the sovereign must be absolute, for any individual freedom 
puts the precarious order established by the social contract at risk. The sovereign 
has authority over all the subjects and no responsibility toward them, while the sub￾jects only have responsibility and no authority. The normative relation between the 
sovereign and the subjects is completely asymmetrical.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau will later develop a radical criticism of Hobbes’ politi￾cal philosophy. He argues that man is naturally moral and then corrupted by soci￾ety. In the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality (1755), he conjectures that the 
state of nature was a primitive, ideal condition in which men lived isolated and 
lawless. In the state of nature, men were driven by benign instincts such as self￾love (amour de soi) and compassion (pitié): the former is conceived as an instinct 
of self-preservation that guides man to the satisfaction of his biological needs, the 
latter is a drive to help those who suffer that counterbalances self-love and contrib￾utes to the preservation of the species. Contrary to other animals, however, human 
beings are not only naturally endowed with instincts but also with freedom: free￾dom is what allows them to act not only instinctively but also by rational choice. 
Thus, on the one hand, the fact that human beings are free implies that they are 
perfectible because they can resist their instincts while, on the other hand, it also 
implies that they can also resist their good ones. Being perfectible, humans learn 
better ways to satisfy their needs: in particular, they develop a form of cooperation 
that leads to the establishment of societies. Here, however, is where corruption frst 
begins, because men who live in societies start to compete with one another for 
resources, sexual partners, and status, thus abandoning their natural instinct for 
compassion. The more interdependent and unequal a civilization becomes, the less 
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?135
freedom remains for human beings and more conficts arise. In The Social Contract
(1762), Rousseau envisages a solution to the problem of harmonizing men’s need 
for a society with their natural freedom and morality in the notion of general will. 
This is the abstract representation of the common purposes and interests of every 
member of a society which is not necessarily instantiated in any of their particular 
will (nor their sum, average, etc.) but should come to inform the laws of the politi￾cal society (possibly by democratic processes of decision). Being subject to such 
laws is for a citizen to acquire what Rousseau calls moral freedom, a rational form 
of freedom different from the natural unconscious and amoral one. The reason why 
a government inspired by general will intends to ensure freedom within a well￾ordered society is that it should guarantee in principle the outcomes of the coopera￾tion between individuals to satisfy their common interest, rather than the specifc 
interests of some at the expense of the interests of others. Such a well-ordered 
society should extinguish conficts. The main problem with Rousseau’s solution, 
obviously, is how to determine the contents of the general will. Economic research 
in social choice theory has proven that no procedure to aggregate individual prefer￾ences into social preferences exists while respecting certain plausible conditions 
on rationality and welfare: this result is known as Arrow’s “impossibility” theorem 
(Arrow, 1950, 1951).
Classical Liberalism
The refections of John Locke on natural law and social contract put him in contact 
with the jusnaturalist tradition. Against the Hobbesian idea of the necessity of a 
liberticide sovereign, however, the liberal theory of the state inaugurated by Locke 
maintains that the freedom of the individual generating confict is essential to the 
development and fourishing of human societies. Locke argues in the Two Treatises 
of Government (1688) that men are naturally free and equal. Natural law endows 
them with inalienable rights, in particular the right to life, liberty, and property. 
When they join together in a political society established by social contract, they do 
not alienate their natural rights to the sovereign, but consent to transfer some of 
them to the government under the condition that it allows them to better enjoy their 
lives, liberties, and properties. The government exists to ensure natural rights, and it 
can therefore be legitimately overthrown if it fails in protecting them. Natural rights 
could engender confictual dynamics within a political society, but as long as they 
are guaranteed by the liberal government, the conficts they generate contribute to 
the progress of the society itself.
Liberal economics inherited this progressivist conception of the confictual 
dynamics engendered by freedom and property. In this sense, Adam Smith theo￾rized that competition in a free market is the condition for growing the general 
wealth of nations: individual endeavors led by self-interest result in unintended 
social benefts. In An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations
(1776), Smith identifes wealth with the product of labor, against both the 
The Idea of Confict136
physiocratic idea that it is the product of nature (a surplus between what is sown and 
what is harvested) and the mercantilist idea that it consists of the natural resources 
(in particular, gold) possessed as a result of a positive difference between export and 
import: “[t]he value of any commodity—he notices—[…] to the person who pos￾sesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for 
other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labor which it enables him to purchase 
or command” (ibid., Book I, Chapter V). If this is the case, then the wealth of a 
society is simply equal to the value of what its industries produce. Interestingly, 
Smith thinks that the increase of this general wealth is the unintentional result of the 
activity of the individuals who pursue their own interests. Specifcally, as previously 
argued in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), he also thinks that this process of 
pursuing individual self-interests ideally provides benefts for everyone involved:
The rich […] consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfshness and 
rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end which they 
propose from the labors of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratifcation of their 
own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improve￾ments. They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the neces￾saries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions 
among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the 
interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species. (The Theory of 
Moral Sentiments, Part IV, Chapter I, 184–185)
Together with the division of labor, which he considers the main way of increasing 
its productivity, a completely free and general market in which commodities could 
be exchanged with no limitation that would alter their value is a condition for eco￾nomic and social prosperity. In this framework, confict in the sense of economic 
and social competition is essential for the sound organization of free markets and 
free societies.
The Dialectic Approach
The notion of confict takes pride of place as a logical and metaphysical principle in 
the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Dialectics is the process that 
resolves a contradiction between two opposing sides in terms of a synthesis that 
acknowledges them as limited and thus surpasses them while preserving them. 
According to Hegel, dialectics models both the processes of thought and the pro￾cesses of reality. Particularly, dialectics is also applied to the analysis of social real￾ity where individuals struggle for reciprocal recognition. This sort of confict is 
described in the well-known fgure of the master-slave dialectics in the 
Phenomenology of Spirit (1807). In the allegoric style characteristic of the book, the 
normative relationship between the master and the slave represents the immediate 
outcome of the struggle between two self-conscious beings. When they encounter 
and confront one another for the frst time, they do not recognize themselves as self￾consciousnesses, and they fght for their autonomy against the opponent which each 
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?137
of them sees as a mere object naturally antagonizing them. This sort of life-or-death 
struggle ends with the subjugation of the one, who becomes the slave, to the other, 
who becomes the master. However, the normative relation established between 
them in this way is defective. The slave does not truly recognize the master, because 
he is simply subjected and responsible to him. The master in turn does not truly 
recognize the slave, because he simply imposes his will and has authority over what 
he desires according to what he thinks, but he never has the chance to confront his 
beliefs and desires with the world, because it is always the slave who provides 
everything to him with his labor. The master is then dependent on the slave not only 
in the literal sense that he could not do without his slave’s work but also in the alle￾goric sense that his knowledge and actions are mediated by the slave. Conversely, 
the slave only works for his master and alienates to him the product of his activity 
and knowledge; therefore, the slave in turn is reciprocally dependent on the master 
himself. By confronting with reality directly through his work, however, the slave 
learns to know the world and himself: this is how he may become an independent 
self-consciousness and eventually emancipate from the defective relation of recog￾nition with the master.
In this allegory, Karl Marx saw the epitome of class struggles which according to 
him characterize the history of human civilizations. In the Marxian account, the 
structure of every socioeconomic system involves certain contradictions that pro￾duce social conficts between classes. A social class is a group of individuals who 
play the same role with respect to the relations of production in an economic sys￾tem. In the capitalist system of production, for instance, the workers sell their labor 
to the capitalists who own the means of production. This sort of class relation is 
conceived as intrinsically exploitative, thus inevitably producing conficts in which 
the exploited people will struggle to change it. According to Marx, the social con￾ficts generated by the contradictions of the capitalist system of production will 
necessarily lead to its overthrow, but the system will counter this eventuality by 
developing institutions with the purpose of reproducing class relations. With Marx, 
the theory of conficts ceases to be a mere philosophical topic and becomes part of 
social and political sciences.
Sociology
Social conficts have been thoroughly investigated not only in philosophy and eco￾nomics, but also, clearly, in sociology. Sociology was developed as an empirical 
science in the nineteenth century by positivist philosophers, who sought to investi￾gate societies and their laws in the same manner as natural sciences do for the physi￾cal world; namely, in terms of scientifc method: making observations, formulating 
hypotheses for theoretical explanation and testing them with experiments. In effect, 
one of the very frst uses of the term “sociology” can be found in the works of 
August Comte himself. He thought of the science of social phenomena as one of the 
greatest achievements of the positive stage of the evolution of human societies; 
The Idea of Confict138
nevertheless, he conceived sociology not as much as a specifc science but as the 
ultimate science that, by dealing with the most complex objects of reality, could 
recapitulate the results of all the others together with their history. In this sense, 
Émile Durkheim crucially contributed to the emancipation of sociology from philo￾sophical investigation by defning its object and method of study. He inherited from 
Comte the idea that societies have to be investigated empirically, but beyond 
Comte’s positivism he maintained that societies are entities belonging to a specifc 
level of reality, irreducible to any other such as the physical or the biological one. 
Sociology is therefore supposed to investigate social facts, which he thought to be 
collective, psychological (thus, immaterial) representations consisting in concep￾tions and behaviors that have the power to infuence and affect individuals. Social 
facts are “ways of acting, thinking and feeling which possess the remarkable prop￾erty of existing outside the consciousness of the individual” and “they are endued 
with a compelling and coercive power by virtue of which, whether he wishes it or 
not, they impose themselves upon him” (Durkheim, 1895, p. 2). Sociology should 
not only describe social facts but also explain their causes and the way they change 
while societies are preserved.
Structural Functionalism
Durkheim saw societies as wholes composed of interrelated and interacting parts, 
and such wholes as not reducible to their parts but as existing because every part has 
its function along with the others to preserve the system’s equilibrium. A part has a 
function in a society to the extent that it contributes to the satisfaction of certain 
social needs. In this sense, conficts are dysfunctions that determine a pathological 
condition in a society (Durkheim, 1895).
The idea that societies are best looked at as organisms whose parts, with their 
individual functions, contribute to the survival of the whole, was also maintained 
and developed by Herbert Spencer, who, at the end of the nineteenth century, 
deeply infuenced the British and more generally the European academy with his 
wide-ranging application of an evolutionary approach. He thought that the dynam￾ics of every aspect of reality, from physics to culture, could be explained in terms 
of a progressive process of diversifcation and integration of increasingly different 
parts. In this sense, the evolution of an organism could be considered the para￾digm for the interpretation of every phenomenon. He considered sociology as a 
feld in which this analysis could clearly stand out as correct and fruitful. He 
argued that societies evolve into increasingly complex structures such as organ￾isms undergoing a selective pressure that, in their case, are represented not only 
by needs such as the availability of resources, production, and distribution of 
goods but also the development of new ideas. The division of labor, for instance, 
should be considered as the development of a new complex social structure in 
order to cope with such pressure.
Spencer’s functionalism also infuenced the work of the American sociologist 
Talcott Parsons. In his action theory, he conceived societies as determined by the 
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?139
voluntary actions of individuals driven by their beliefs and motivations (Parsons, 
1937). According to Parsons, societies consist of structural roles which individuals 
fll by interacting with one another. These roles are instituted by the behavior of the 
individuals: actions generate expectations whose regular fulfllment corroborates a 
series of norms that characterize a social role: for example, the wife, the professor, 
the child, and so on. These roles contribute to the satisfaction of the different needs 
of society by performing different functions, and it is for this reason that, once roles 
are instituted, societies tend to preserve them. The processes of socialization, con￾sisting in directing new individuals to fll the role that better fts them, and social 
control, consisting in the repression of the behaviors that violate social norms, are 
ways in which societies try to preserve themselves and their structure.
Structural functionalism was later refned by another great American sociologist, 
Robert Merton. In explicit contrast to Parsons’ attempt to provide a general theory 
of societies, Merton dismissed any foundational task in social science, favoring 
instead a research methodology aimed at providing what he called “middle range 
theories” of specifc social phenomena (Merton, 1957). In his view, in fact, societies 
are not functional units, and different functions can be in contrast with one another: 
specifcally, what may have a positive function for certain parts of the society at 
certain times could still be dysfunctional for other parts, or even for the same parts 
at other times. The “role-sets” that members with the same social status are expected 
to abide by do not always ft in with one another in the functioning of a society, nor 
individuals spontaneously fall in with the role-set that is attributed to them; hence, 
Merton suggests that sociologists should let go of “the utopian fgment of a per￾fectly effective social system” (ibid.) and investigate the actual, confictual, func￾tioning of societies.
Social Action Theory
Parsons explicitly credited Max Weber as a forerunner of his approach. Weber him￾self was one of the great founding fathers of sociology and certainly a crucial refer￾ence point for Parson among many others, but Parsons’ reading of Weber is 
problematic. Indeed, Weber discusses social conficts in the context of his own 
theory of social action. He proposes defning sociology as “a science which attempts 
the interpretive understanding of social action in order thereby to arrive at a causal 
explanation of its course and effects” (Weber, 1947, p. 88).
An action is social to the extent that it has meaning in the sense that it is per￾formed by an agent who orients it by considering their own beliefs and desires as 
well as the behavior of the other agents. In this regard, actions are starkly distin￾guished from mere behavioral responses to the environment, but they are also con￾sidered as not accountable in terms of normative generalizations about human 
nature. According to Weber, social action always has a subjective meaning: it is the 
meaning someone intends it to have in a certain context. In this sense, the point of 
sociology cannot be to look for the correct interpretation of an action but to provide 
a contextual understanding of it.
The Idea of Confict140
Weber distinguishes four ideal types of social action. Traditional action is an 
originally meaningful social action now performed out of habit, for example, 
exchanging gifts for Christmas. Affectional action is a social action irrationally 
motivated by an emotion, such as love, rage, fear, and so on. Value-rational action is 
an action consciously motivated by the belief that a certain behavior is intrinsically 
right. Instrumental-rational action is an action motivated by a practical reasoning to 
fulfll some utility.
When the social actions of different agents are oriented toward one another, a 
social relation is established. Confict (Kampf) is a social relation established by 
actions oriented toward the imposition of one’s will against the others (Weber, 1921, 
p. 38). According to Weber, the possibility of realizing one’s will in social action is 
the defnition of power. He identifes three main areas in which conficts may take 
place. Economic conficts arise for the possession of wealth, therefore, salaries, 
goods, lands, buildings, and so on. Social conficts arise for the achievement of 
prestige, namely the respect of the others. Political conficts arise for the achieve￾ment of power itself, that is to say for increasing one’s possibilities to impose 
one’s will.
Weber considers confict a dynamic element in a society because it allows the 
worthiest to achieve power and at the same time makes power competitive.
Understanding Conficts
What is a confict, then? In this section, some proposals are discussed to give a gen￾eral answer to this question. Our aim, however, is not to judge whether or not these 
proposals provide adequate representations of confictual situations; rather, we use 
them to highlight some of the basic characters and components of a confict. Once 
they are clearly put into view, the analysis of conficts and their dynamics will be 
introduced. The point of a defnition of conficts, in fact, is not simply to identify 
certain situations as confictual but also to understand how they are articulated and 
developed.
Different Approaches to a Defnition
In the previous section, we have singled out two different approaches in sociology: 
structural functionalism and the theory of social action. Indeed, there are two main 
strategies for defning conficts that derive from these two approaches.
On the one hand, one may focus on the structure of a social system and on the 
functions of its various parts. In this approach, conficts are conceived as originating 
from the defective interaction of the parts of a system. In this sense, conficts can 
only be understood either as malfunctions in the structure that should be overcome 
by restoring the proper functioning of its parts or as intrinsic phenomena of a 
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?141
problematic social system that inevitably result from the articulation of its defective 
structure; however, in neither of the two cases conficts are taken to be something 
that should be investigated per se.
When the sociologist Ralph Dahrendorf took on the challenge of criticizing the 
Marxist theory of confict, the tradition of structural functionalism, which then pre￾vailed in sociology, could not truly provide him with any alternative theory to coun￾terpose. The main criticism Dahrendorf addresses to the Marxist analysis concerns 
the identifcation of confict with class struggle (Dahrendorf, 1957, p.  116 ff.). 
According to Marx, in fact, classes are identifed by the role individuals play in a 
system of production and they confict because they have different interests with 
respect to the relations it determines; for instance, in the capitalist system, capital￾ists make profts by exploiting workers and therefore the two classes are in confict. 
Classes are ideally represented as united and internally non-confictual, so that any 
other confict should either be debunked as unfounded or somehow brought back to 
the contradictions of the production system.
To develop an alternative picture, Dahrendorf’s frst move is a generalization of 
the notion of confict:
I am using the term “confict” in this study for contests, competitions, disputes, and tensions 
as well as for manifest clashes between social forces. All relations between sets of individu￾als that involve an incompatible difference of objective—i.e., in its most general form, a 
desire on the part of both contestants to attain what is available only to one, or only in 
part—are, in this sense, relations of social confict. (Ibid., p. 135)
Another very general defnition proposed by Dahrendorf is the following one
The term “confict” should initially be taken to mean every relationship between elements 
that can be described as having objective (“latent”) or subjective (“manifest”) opposition. 
(Dahrendorf, 1961, p. 201)
Here, he introduces a distinction between conficts that are manifest to parties in the 
sense that parties are aware of them and conficts that are merely latent, that is to say 
hidden in the structure of the relations between parties. It is important for a theory 
of conficts to consider latent conficts; in fact, it is certainly possible for someone 
to be a party in a confict without being aware of it. By way of illustration, consider 
the following situations: Mary and Joan are thirsty, and the only way they have to 
satisfy their thirst is to buy some drinks from a vending machine, but the vending 
machine contains one bottle only. In this case, Mary and Joan’s needs are incompat￾ible because both cannot be satisfed together: Mary and Joan are therefore parties 
in a confict, even if they are unaware of it. The incompatibility depends on the facts 
of the given situation. The possibility of acknowledging latent conficts is of course 
part of the inheritance of the functionalist approach. On the other hand, however, 
Dahrendorf’s approach is actually too general. It risks including any aspect of social 
interactions into the category of confict and barely provides any analytical tool to 
distinguish between them—and we most defnitely want to distinguish between, 
say, a tennis match and World War II; besides, it does not give us any real instrument 
for the analysis of confictual situations.
Understanding Conficts142
Another approach to the defnition of conficts focuses directly on the agents who 
interact, rather than on the structure of their interaction. This second approach can 
be traced back to Weber’s analysis of social action and, in general, to the theory of 
social action that originated from it. To explain the action of the parties of a confict, 
this approach takes into account the content of their mental states: their desires, 
objectives, emotions, values, beliefs, and so on. One of the most cited defnitions of 
confict in this sense is by Friedrich Glasl:
Social confict is an interaction between actors (individuals, groups, organisations etc.), 
where at least one actor is experiencing incompatibilities in thought, concepts, perceptions 
and/or emotions and/or intentions with the other actor(s) in such a way that his implementa￾tion of his ideas/wishes is being hindered by another actor (the other actors). (Glasl, 1997)
Glasl himself points out the merits of his defnition. To begin with, it allows the 
identifcation of confict where there is an actual social interaction. A confict origi￾nates from an incompatibility between the actions of two parties: the accomplish￾ment of the one action hinders the accomplishment of the other. The focus on actions 
provides a framework for the analysis of conficts. A confict is experienced by 
actors in connection to what motivates their actions: beliefs, desires, and so on. An 
actor experiences an incompatibility between their intentions and those of another 
agent. Consider the above example once again. If Mary and Joan desire to drink and 
know that there is only one bottle left in the vending machine, they then realize that 
the one’s action will hinder the implementation of the other one’s intentions.
Glasl’s defnition permits the identifcation of conficts even if what generates 
them is immaterial and even if it is experienced asymmetrically by one of the agents 
only. In general, it offers a powerful and plastic framework for the analysis of con￾fictual situations, but it has also some important drawbacks; in fact, this approach 
can only capture manifest conficts resulting from the action of one of the parties. In 
this sense, it tends to disregard all the latent conficts that might depend on the struc￾ture of a certain social system in which the conficting parties have not yet taken on 
any active role.
Confict Formations
As we have seen, one of the problems with defning conficts is appropriately 
accounting for the fact that they can be either manifest or latent; in fact, this is but a 
symptom of the more general problem that what to look for when trying to identify 
confictual situations is often hard to characterize. As Johan Galtung suggested, 
“[t]he statement ‘this is a confict’ should always be taken as a hypothesis—not as 
something obvious, even trivial, about which consensus is easily obtained” (Galtung, 
1996, p.  72). Conficts are complex phenomena, and one should try to become 
familiar with them before even attempting a defnition.
As a frst step, Galtung (1958) suggested thinking about conficts as triadic con￾structs involving three components (see Fig. 8.1).
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?143
Attitudes
Behavior Contradiction
Fig. 8.1 The confict 
triangle
(A) The attitudes of parties.
These are the conceptions and beliefs with which each party interprets the world 
and others. In particular, they determine how each party interprets the causes of the 
confict, its actions, and the actions of the other parties. They are also the desires and 
emotions that each party has and explain the party’s behavior. Negative attitudes 
toward another party may lead to offending actions.
(B) The behavior of parties.
These are the actions that manifest the attitudes of parties. Actions aiming to 
offend or however damage the other parties often make a confict manifest, but may 
be neither the cause nor the content of the confict.
(C) The incompatibility (contradiction) that is the content of the confict.2
Two states of affairs are incompatible if they cannot obtain together. The incom￾patible goals of two or more parties may cause conficts, but conficts may also be 
generated by the fact that the necessity to satisfy certain needs is incompatible with 
the structure of the social system.
It is important to notice that these constituents are dynamically related to each 
other in the development of a confict; for instance, an incompatibility between the 
goals of two parties can be experienced as frustration, which leads to aggressive 
behavior; or, maybe the confict originated in the behavior of one of the agents, 
which generates an incompatibility, for instance, with the pursuit of happiness of the 
other agents; or again, it is the aggressiveness of the parties that triggers actions 
aimed to damage the opponent. Galtung notices that the behavior is the only con￾stituent of the confict that is truly manifest to the empirical investigation: the actions 
of the agents can be directly examined by an external observer. Instead, the other 
2The difference between incompatibility and contradiction is subtle but interesting. Technically, a 
contradiction is a logical impossibility: for instance, it is a contradiction that all men are mortal, 
and some men are not mortal. To think of the content of conficts in terms of contradiction is maybe 
too narrow. Two contradictory states of affairs are such that if the one does not obtain, the other one 
has to; therefore, again, if not all men are mortal, then it must be the case that some men are not. 
Two incompatible states of affairs cannot obtain both together, but it is possible for neither of them 
to obtain; for instance, a uniform patch of color cannot be both red and green, but it can be white. 
The goals of the actors in a confict are often only incompatible, especially when they concern the 
exclusive use or possession of certain limited resources: for instance, it was impossible for both 
Great Britain and France to have exclusive authority over the American colonies, but it was pos￾sible for the latter to be autonomous.
Understanding Conficts144
two constituents tend to be hidden: attitudes are subjective, and the incompatibility 
might be structural.
By way of illustration, let us try to demonstrate an application of this analysis 
using a very well-known historical confict: the American Civil War. A very com￾mon way to identify the Civil War as a historical event is to say that the confict 
broke out when the southern Confederate states, which had seceded after the elec￾tion of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United States, attacked Fort 
Sumter in 1861, and came to an end when Lee surrendered to Grant after the Siege 
of Petersburg in 1865. The battles, and in general all of the actions the parties took 
during the confict, characterized their behaviors. Yet, undeniably, actions and 
events are insuffcient to understand the confict that produced them; for example, 
in the analysis of the causes of the Civil War, it is also commonly pointed out that 
the reason why some of the southern states broke away from the Union was because 
Lincoln had been elected on an antislavery platform. Indeed, Union and Confederate 
states professed opposite attitudes toward slavery, surely one of the issues of the 
confict; yet, again, the incompatibility between the attitudes of the parties toward 
slavery was not the only one at stake. As a matter of fact, slavery was essential to the 
economies of most southern states which were essentially based on plantations 
which required a large availability of low-cost manual labor and free trade to access 
international markets in which to sell crops. Alternatively, Northern states were 
experiencing a tentative process of industrialization that needed protectionist legis￾lation to defend their products from the competition of the more advanced European 
manufactures. Unquestionably, these elements do not amount to a complete analysis 
of the causes of the American Civil War; still, they contribute to the bigger and more 
complex picture of the confict. Indeed, such a picture could be drawn, in principle, 
by applying more thoroughly Galtung’s framework.
By combining together the three components of a confict, it is possible to cate￾gorize different “confict formations” (Table 8.1).
It might be worth considering some examples to clarify these different cases. 
Situations in which only one component is present are relatively easy to point out; 
thus, for case (2), it could be a couple who will have to decide where to spend their 
holidays together, but have incompatible preferences (A): one wishes to go to the 
mountains, and the other to the sea. Bullying behaviors in children (B) could

engender a confict formation of type (3). A way to illustrate type (4), that is, the 
mere presence of a contradiction (C) that could turn into a reason for conficts could 
be by thinking about climate change: a process determined, among other things, by 
the incompatibility between the ways in which part of the world population main￾tains its lifestyle and our global ecosystem. When multiple components are in place, 
the dynamics of confictual situations come slightly more to the fore. Formations of 
type (5) are thus interestingly apt to describe conficts generated by cultural or 
social prejudices: an existing bias or preconception against certain groups of people 
is likely to generate discriminatory behaviors (A, B), which in turn could become 
incompatible with their well-being (A, B, C). Formations of type (6) are perhaps the 
easiest to picture. These are cases in which reasons for confict are present, and the 
parties are fully aware of the situation (C, A) but are not yet acting against each 
other. If they do act, the confict will be fully articulated (A, B, C). Any situation in 
which the scarcity of some resource forces two or more parties to compete against 
each other is a case in point. Lastly, an example that could be useful to understand 
formations of type (7) is provided by the Marxist analysis of class conficts; indeed, 
the Marxist tradition typically sees class conficts as initially emerging from the 
structural incompatibilities present in a production system and which certain social 
groups tend to take advantage of (C, B) until those who are oppressed eventually 
develop the consciousness of being a part of the confict as a “class” (A, B, C).
Characteristics of a Confict
Galtung’s analysis of confict formations provides interesting tools for developing 
an approach in which both the structure of the social system in which conficts origi￾nate and the role of the actors that effectively oppose to one another is considered. 
As we will see, however, the three components of attitudes, behavior, and incompat￾ibility can only be singled out against the background of a more specifc analysis of 
the characteristics of a given confictual situation. Galtung himself, for instance, 
noticed that to fully understand the manifest/latent dialectic, the distinction must be 
introduced between direct and indirect conficts. Conficts can also be characterized 
in term of their size, their complexity, and the sort of adversarial actions involved.
Direct and Indirect Conficts
Direct conficts are conficts between actors, conficting parties who act against each 
other. Indirect conficts are structural conficts, a contradiction in the social interac￾tion of two or more parties. The distinction depends on the degree to which the 
parties are conscious of the components of the confict. Clearly, they are always 
conscious of the behavior, since it is manifestly observable. The point, then, con￾cerns the attitudes and the contradiction: in direct conficts, the parties are conscious 
of them and, in indirect conficts, they are not. Actors can be unconscious of their 
Understanding Conficts146
attitudes. As far as the other party’s attitudes are concerned, this is obvious since 
attitudes are private and subjective. But it might also be the case that actors are not 
even self-aware of their own attitudes: they might not be conscious of what they 
really want or how they really feel; besides, they might be unconscious of what 
actually is the case because they have misconceptions (and thus they misinterpret 
the confict). Actors can therefore also be unconscious of the contradiction between 
their own and the others’ goals.
By combining all these elements together, we might achieve a better understand￾ing regarding how confict formations manifest themselves. Conficts are prepared 
when negative attitudes accumulate, offending actions are perpetrated, or a contra￾diction in the social structure creates a tension in the interaction between actors and 
their goals. The mere manifestation of conficting behavior is often just a symptom 
of a confict that is latent because the actors are not conscious or fully conscious of 
the contradiction that opposes them; or, even if there is no offending behavior, the 
actors could still become conscious of a contradiction that is present in the social 
system and organize themselves to remove it by modifying the system itself. Of 
course, it might also be the case that only one of the actors is conscious of the con￾tradiction and acts against the other. These asymmetric situations, however, may 
cause the oppressed party to become conscious of the confict and mobilize.
Dimension
The size of a confict depends on the number of people involved in it. Generally 
speaking, we may distinguish between micro-conficts concerning relations between 
individuals, meso-conficts concerning small social groups or organizations, and 
macro-conficts involving societies and cultural, ethnic, or religious groups. This 
tripartite classifcation is to a certain extent arbitrary due to the fact that the com￾plexity and the variety of social formations that may engage in confictual situations 
escape any stark pigeonholing; this is a simple and yet important observation. The 
scientifc study of conficts must reconcile the demand for an accurate representa￾tion of phenomena with the demand for an effective analysis. The choice of the 
categories for the analysis must be evaluated against their explanatory power. In this 
case, the distinction between three sizes of confict is broadly acknowledged as 
adequate for the purpose of characterizing different sorts of confictual situations 
(cf. Galtung, 2010, pp. 43–45).
It is important to notice that at each different level conficts might be internal or 
external. Internal conficts are generated within a single social unit; such, for 
instance, is a confict internal to an organization. Psychological conficts could per￾haps be classifed as conficts internal to a single person. External conficts are gen￾erated between different units of the same kind; for instance, interpersonal conficts 
or conficts between states of ethnic groups are external conficts (Table 8.2).
Can conficts arise between units of different sizes? On the one hand, it seems 
that parties who act at different levels could not engage in confict. Rousseau, for 
instance, believed that such a possibility is to be ruled out in a society governed

according to the general will: in The Social Contract, he noticed that since an indi￾vidual is both a Citizen and the Sovereign in the ideal democratic state, there can be 
no confict between the state and the individuals. On the other hand, however, if one 
looks at the structure of a social system, it may well be the case that the incompat￾ibility that gives rise to a confictual situation concerns social units of different 
sizes. National and international laws, for example, commonly allow for the possi￾bility of holding trials in which individuals are opposed to companies or states are 
opposed to individuals and companies; nonetheless, even in these cases the three 
levels explain some relevant characters of the conficts: in particular, the fact that 
they involve actors of different sizes.
Complexity
The complexity of a confict depends on the structure of the parties and of the social 
system that governs their interaction. Conficts are generated within a cultural, com￾municative, and social context. In other words, the dynamics of a confict’s compo￾nents (attitudes, behavior, and contradiction) which operate in the background of 
certain knowledge and beliefs are mediated by certain communicative practices and 
are constrained by a certain social structure. Understanding the context is essential 
for the proper identifcation of the contradiction that is the content of a confict, the 
ascription of the attitudes to the agents, and the explanation of their behavior; it is 
also crucial for being able to predict the evolution of the confict and possibly to 
intervene accordingly.
Galtung (2010) considers several distinctions for the analysis of the structure of 
the actors who engage in a confict and of their interaction. He notices preliminarily 
that structured conficts must be distinguished from non-structured ones. The latter 
arise in situations in which there is no previous relation or interaction between the 
actors. These cases are borderline but perfectly possible nevertheless. Consider, for 
instance, the confict between a colonial power and the indigenous people: typically, 
their interaction begins with their confict.
Structured conficts, however, are the most common ones. The structure of a 
confict in this sense is the structure of the social system in which the parties inter￾act, and this structure may have several different properties. First, the interaction 
between the parties might favor only one of them or, to the contrary, the benefts 
might be equally distributed among all the agents. In the former case, the interaction 
is vertical; in the latter, it is horizontal. Second, when the interaction concerns

groups, it might be weak or stronger, depending on whether all or just a few of the 
members are involved. Third, depending on the number of relations that bind the 
actors, the interaction might be specifc, diffuse, or even a fusion between the actors.
These distinctions are somewhat tentative, but they still allow a rough character￾ization of the structure of different sorts of social systems (Fig. 8.2). A conservative 
society, for example a feudal one, is characterized by vertical and weak, specifc 
interactions, because the majority of the benefts of the social interactions converge 
at the vertex of the social pyramid, and the interactions do not involve all the indi￾viduals and concern only certain aspects of their activities. In a communal society, 
instead, the interactions are horizontal, bind all the individuals together, and tend to 
be more diffuse. In both a liberal and a pluralist society, different groups of indi￾viduals, connected by horizontal relations, interact with other similar groups: the 
difference between the two is that in the former certain groups beneft from the 
interaction at the expense of the others, while in the latter, the interactions between 
different groups are horizontal as well.
Violence
In order to characterize conficts, it is also important to try to classify the behaviors 
the parties may manifest against each other and the degree of violence it implies. 
Actors may simply compete to obtain some goal or even prevent one another from 
obtaining it. In worst-case scenarios, the parties assault one another directly. The 
behavior of the parties may therefore be more violent or less violent. Violence is the 
use of force to physically or psychologically hurt someone. The presence of vio￾lence is always a sign of the presence of a confict. Not every confict, however, 
includes violent behaviors because the confict might be indirect and latent. It must 
then be acknowledged that violence can assume different forms. Clearly, there is 
interpersonal violence. Such a form of violence has been considered illegitimate in 
8 What Are Conficts and Why Do They Occur?149
the development of modern unitary states: the monopoly of the legitimate violence 
has been ascribed to the state, while internal conficts have been governed by the 
rules of right. Latent conficts, however, are often characterized by structural vio￾lence, that is, the indirect sort of violence that comes from the social structure even 
in the absence of an actor who intentionally commits it (Galtung, 1996). Both direct 
and indirect violence limit the possibilities of human self-realization. They are often 
legitimized by the cultural violence of power that aims to persuade actors as to what 
is right and wrong.
A more thorough typology of adversarial actions will be discussed in the next 
chapter.
Conclusions
In this chapter, the notion of confict has been introduced and defned. We have 
noticed that conficts can and have been construed ambivalently either as malfunc￾tions in an otherwise well-organized structure or as dynamic phenomena that 
explain change and development. Keeping both characterizations together is not an 
easy task. It requires considering both latent conficts that depend on the structure 
of the social entities in which conficts are generated and manifest conficts that are 
direct consequences of the actions of the parties.
Chapter Summary
The purpose of the frst chapter of this second part of the book is to offer a prelimi￾nary acquaintance with the notion of what a confict is. We began by sketching a 
historical overview of how some classical Western thinkers have conceived conficts 
and their role in human societies. We noticed that since ancient Greek philosophy to 
modern political science and sociology the refection on this notion has constantly 
been characterized by a tension between a positive view of conficts as manifesta￾tions of changing forces that eventually contribute to the development of societies 
and a negative view that sees conficts as disruptive of social order and well-being. 
This tension is one of the reasons why it is not easy to provide a defnition of a con￾fict. As examples of this diffculty, we considered Ralf Dahrendorf’s defnition, 
which has the merit of highlighting what it is for a confict to be latent, and Friedrich 
Glasl’s defnition, which insists instead on the active interactions of the parties. We 
focused then on Johan Galtung’s analysis of the components of a confictual forma￾tion: the behavior of the parties, their attitudes, and the contradiction that generates 
the confict. We noticed that these elements allow us to recognize and describe a 
fairly varied phenomenology of confictual situations. We also considered some of 
the main characteristics that a confictual formation may have. We noticed that con￾ficts vary for the way in which parties interact with one another, for their dimen￾sion, the complexity of the parties involved and the degree of violence that they are 
disposed to direct to one another.

Confict Analysis
This chapter discusses the elements that must be taken into account for an analysis 
of confictual situations. In the previous chapter, we have introduced Galtung’s pre￾sentation of the three components that must be individuated to characterize confic￾tual formations: attitudes, behaviors, and incompatibilities. We now need to provide 
a more refned analysis of what is involved in a confict. We begin by presenting the 
problem of identifying the parties. We then proceed to discuss what motivates them 
to take part in a confict and the way in which they may deal with it: their attitudes, 
the issues that generate the incompatibilities between them, their needs, their 
actions, and the strategies they can adopt to handle the confict.
Parties
The frst important step in the analysis of a confict is to identify the parties. The 
parties of a confict are the potential actors, that is to say, the subjects in the position 
to alter the confict dynamics (Jeong, 2008, p.  22). They have at their disposal 
resources and capacities with which they can intervene in the confict. They have an 
organization and both internal and external communicative relations with other par￾ties. Depending on the scale of the confict, the parties might be single individuals, 
groups, or institutions; in fact, it is the dimension and the internal organization of 
the parties that allows the determination of the size and the complexity of a confict. 
The actions of the parties defne their role in the confict and their responsibilities. 
But what is an action in the frst place?

Actions and Responsibilities
To begin with, actions must be distinguished from events. An earthquake spilling 
coffee out of a thermos is an event; me pouring the coffee out of a thermos is an 
action. Intuitively, an earthquake is not an actor, while I am: in the frst case, spilling 
coffee is something that happens, while in the second it is something that I do. One 
could say that spilling the coffee is something the earthquake does but only in a 
metaphorical sense.1
 This is fne as far as intuitions go, but do these intuitions stand 
on solid ground?
Our traditional conception of an action is essentially related to the notion of 
intentionality; for instance, pouring coffee is an action because it is something I do 
intentionally, while being burned by the coffee cup is not because it is something 
that merely happens to me. As the philosopher Donald Davidson pointed out, how￾ever, while every intentional behavior is an action, not every action is intentional 
(Davidson, 1971). Suppose I think that the thermos is full of tea: pouring coffee 
from it is therefore something I do but without the intention to do so. It is interest￾ing, at any rate, to ask to what extent mistakes are to be considered actions. Consider 
the case in which I try to pour the coffee from the thermos to a cup, but I clumsily 
spill it all over the foor. In this example, spilling the coffee on the foor is something 
I do, something I may be taken to be responsible for. Compare this case with a situ￾ation in which I spill the coffee because someone jiggles my hand. Is spilling the 
coffee something I do in this latter case? That is more questionable. Davidson sug￾gests that something someone does is an action if it can be described in some way 
as something someone does intentionally; therefore, while I do not intentionally 
pour coffee from a thermos if I believe that it is full of tea, pouring coffee is still to 
be considered an action of mine because what I do can be described as pouring the 
liquid inside the thermos, which I do intentionally. Similarly spilling the coffee all 
over the foor is an action of mine if what happens can be described, for instance, as 
me intentionally tilting the thermos. To the contrary, according to Davidson, it is a 
mere event that I spill the coffee if someone tilts my hand, something that just hap￾pened to me, because there is no description under which what I do can be described 
as intentional.
Davidson’s characterization is very traditional in the philosophy of action. It is 
important to notice that according to this characterization it is unnecessary for an 
actor to be conscious of their actions. Consider another example of Davidson’s: “I 
fip the switch, turn on the light, and illuminate the room. Unbeknownst to me I also 
alert a prowler of the fact that I am home” (Davidson, 1963). In this case, what I do 
can be described as “fipping the switch”, “turning on the light”, “illuminating the 
room”, “alerting a prowler”, and possibly in many other ways. My intention is to 
turn on the light and illuminate the room; however, my action can also be described 
as alerting a prowler. Alerting a prowler is then an action of mine (because a 
1See, however, (Sellars, 1962).
9 Confict Analysis155
different intentional description can also be given to what I do), and, yet, I am not 
consciously alerting a prowler.
To explain why a rational agent performs a certain action, the desires and beliefs 
of an agent must be taken into account. According to Davidson (1963), the explana￾tion of a rational action consists in identifying a pro-attitude of an agent toward a 
certain kind of action and an instrumental belief that the action in question is of that 
kind. Pro-attitudes are simply favorable attitudes: the idea is that agents have desires, 
wants, values, interests, and proclivities that make them adopt a favorable attitude 
toward performing certain kinds of actions; for instance, the love for my partner 
makes me adopt a pro-attitude toward caring for her. In the presence of such a pro￾attitude of mine, the belief that caressing her hairs is an act of care explains why I 
caressed her hair. The ascription of certain pro-attitudes and beliefs to a rational 
agent are the paradigmatic way to make sense of a person’s actions.
This means that actions and their consequences are subject to interpretation. It is 
for this reason that the identifcation of the parties of a confict might not be an easy 
task. Clearly, when the confict is latent, parties may neither exhibit offensive behav￾ior nor engage in confictual interactions. But it might also be the case that the par￾ties do not recognize one another as such because they do not interpret their actions 
as engaging them in a confict, possibly in reason of background conceptions and 
values. In these, the confict evolves when parties acknowledge themselves as 
engaged in the confict and determine their identity, interests, and goals. Once par￾ties are self-conscious, they can become actors by organizing themselves.
Allies and Third Parties
Aside from the original ones, new parties might even emerge as a result of the con￾fict itself. During a confict, parties may rally allies and supporters. These may 
interact with the dynamics of the confict because they may modify the resources 
parties have at their disposal. Besides, allies have their own interests, goals, needs, 
and values that might not coincide with those of the parties they support. They may 
therefore orient not only the actors’ strategies but also the interpretation they give of 
one another and of one another’s actions.
Not all the parties who act in a confict, however, are necessarily engaged in challeng￾ing others. It is also important to acknowledge and investigate the role of third parties in 
the management of a confict. Third parties are intermediaries who are in the position of 
facilitating the peaceful resolution of a confict. They might or might not be impartial in 
the confict, and they certainly have their interests and goals. On the one hand, the role of 
third parties is to apply leverage to alter the strategies of parties; for instance, the UN can 
impose economic sanctions as a means of forcing parties in a confict to agree to peace. 
On the other hand, third parties modify the communicative context of the confict. They 
verify facts and provide information to parties, establish objective criteria for the interpre￾tation of the actions and events that caused or worsened the confict and introduce new 
interests or goals for parties to obtain.
Parties156
In this regard, it is interesting to consider as an example the role of the UN as a 
third part in international conficts (Arielli & Scotto, 2003, pp. 140–148). The UN 
Charter establishes that no member is allowed to use force or to threaten the territo￾rial and political integrity of other nations. In the case of a dispute, parties are com￾mitted to seeking for a peaceful settlement “by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, 
conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrange￾ments, or other peaceful means of their own choice” (Art. 33). The Security Council 
is responsible for determining the existence of a threat to peace (Art. 39). When 
such a threat is ascertained, the Council may frst apply measures not involving the 
use of armed force, such as “complete or partial interruption of economic relations 
and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, 
and the severance of diplomatic relations” (Art. 41). If these measures should prove 
to be ineffective, the Council is entitled to use military measures (Art. 42).
The Security Council is not allowed to intervene in matters which are essentially 
within the domestic jurisdiction of any state, but this principle does not apply to the 
measures that would be considered necessary to counter a threat to peace (Art. 2, 
Para. 7). Initially, the peacekeeping mandate of UN missions was interpreted in 
terms of the legitimacy to deploy a neutral military force between two opponents 
who give their consent to the operation. The UN troops had to maintain the impartial 
role of an interposition force: more specifcally, as the general secretary of the UN 
Boutros-Ghali clearly stated, in peacekeeping “three particularly important princi￾ples are the consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use of force except in 
self-defence” (Boutros-Ghali, 1995, Para. 33). During the 1980s, the interpretation 
of the peace-keeping mandate was progressively extended to also cover humanitar￾ian duties, such as the monitoring of human rights and the protection of refugees as 
well as administrative duties in support of the institutional and political reconstruc￾tion that follows a confict.
For peacekeeping operations of this sort to be effective, they require certain 
political and military premises that could not be satisfed when UN forces are called 
upon to protect civil populations and humanitarian operations during open warfare 
and without the consent of the fghting parties (ibid., Para. 35). The unsuccessful 
operations in Somalia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina were an unfortunate demon￾stration of the limits of this approach.
In Somalia in 1992, the UN mission UNOSOM I was deployed to uphold the 
cease-fre of the civil war that had been fought by local factions for a year; the 
cease-fre was ignored nonetheless. In 1993, the second UN mission UNOSOM II 
was organized with increased military resources to support a federalist government 
in the country. This time, the UN troops got involved in a confict against the local 
faction leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid, and many civilians were harmed and killed 
in the fghting.
The mission UNPROFOR was deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 dur￾ing the wars that followed the fall of Yugoslavia. The mission’s mandate was two￾fold: on the one hand, it had to create the conditions for a peace between the three 
ethnic groups of Bosnians, Serbians and Croatians, and, on the other hand, it had to 
protect certain cities where refugees should have been safe. Among these was the 
9 Confict Analysis157
city of Srebrenica, originally controlled by Bosnians who were forced to demilita￾rize. On July 11, 1995, the Bosnian-Serb army attacked Srebrenica, entered the city 
and massacred the population while UN troops did not intervene.
Since the 1990s the UN Security Council has authorized multinational missions 
of peace enforcement, for example Gulf 1990, Afghanistan 2001, Libya 2011, and 
so on, whose legitimacy and effcacy have long been debated: on the one hand, they 
are defended as necessary for guaranteeing human rights where these are violated, 
and, on the other hand, they are criticized because they legitimate the use of military 
violence as a means for resolving macro-conficts.
Attitudes and Interpretations
Parties have beliefs, needs, values, and goals and they may have different attitudes 
toward certain issues and different motivations to pursue their interests. These are 
what have been called attitudes in Galtung’s model. Attitudes articulate the cogni￾tive environment of parties. As we have seen in the previous section, ascribing atti￾tudes (beliefs and desires) to parties allows an explanation of their actions and 
behaviors. The attitudes of parties determine how they see the world and interpret 
events and states of affairs.
With respect to the explanation of the actions of parties, it is important to keep in 
mind how information is integrated in a person’s cognitive environment. We dis￾cussed this at length in Chap. 7; in fact, a cognitive environment contains the infor￾mation that provides a person a representation of the world. Human beings are 
naturally endowed with fnite cognitive capacities, thus, the amount of information 
that a cognitive subject can effciently use for practical purposes is accordingly 
limited. Human beings therefore need to maximize the relevance of the information 
they process. This is achieved by selecting the information that better integrates 
with one’s own cognitive environment, that is, the information that produces the 
highest cognitive benefts with the least cognitive effort. This process is effcient, 
but it does not guarantee that the information selected as relevant is also true. While 
true information tends to be more relevant than false information, the selection of 
true information often requires substantial modifcations of previous beliefs and 
cognitive environments are rather conservative. Specifcally, the information 
selected in the past heavily infuences the selection of any new information. In order 
to be integrated, in fact, all the new information must produce some contextual 
effect on a cognitive environment. But it might well be the case that the new, true 
information is too foreign or too contrary to the previously selected one and simply 
ends up being discarded.
When Galileo Galilei reported his observations of the four satellites orbiting 
around Jupiter, a discovery that astonishingly refuted Ptolemaic astronomy, he 
encountered the vehement opposition of a large part of the scientifc and religious 
community. The Bohemian astronomer Martin Horký, for instance, raised doubts on 
the validity of Galilei’s observation by interpreting what he saw as an abnormal 
Attitudes and Interpretations158
effect of the optics of the telescope: that state of affairs would have ft in his cogni￾tive environment much better than the heliocentric theory.
These sorts of phenomena have also been investigated by social psychology with 
relation to social prejudice and discrimination. The British psychologists Henri 
Tajfel and John Turner tried to explain what they called “intergroup” behavior, that 
is to say “the interaction between two or more individuals […] that is fully deter￾mined by their respective membership in various social groups or categories, and 
not at all affected by the inter-individual personal relationships between the people 
involved” (Tajfel & Turner, 1986, p. 8). They theorized that individuals could be 
ascribed a social identity, that is, the part of an individual’s concept of self, deter￾mined by the fact that the individual perceives itself to be a member of certain social 
groups. In their experiments, they demonstrated that social identity grounds radical 
asymmetries in the ways in which people perceive the members of their own group 
(the “in-group”) as opposed to the nonmembers (the “out-group”) (cf. Tajfel, 1970). 
Even when groups are determined by trivial characteristics, the in-group bias infu￾ences social categorization, preferences and in general the polarization of attitudes 
and choices. Out-groups are perceived as more homogeneous, their members are 
characterized in terms of stereotypes, the differences between individuals of in￾groups and out-groups are emphasized and their similarities to the contrary are dis￾regarded (cf. also Sunstein, 2001, 2009).
These kinds of intergroup dynamics are extremely diffcult to dismantle because 
parties tend to interpret one another’s behavior in terms of the attitudes they already 
have toward one another. Parties develop expectations of one another’s behavior 
that they perceive as confrmed by the interpretation they give of what they do. Such 
a confrmation in turn reinforces the biased attitudes that determined the interpreta￾tion in the frst place, and so on, in a vicious circle. This situation, however, may 
also have more concrete effects. Such is the case of the so-called self-fulflling 
prophecy. The phenomenon was originally named by the sociologist Robert Merton 
and concerns the fact that a person’s behavior can actually be affected by others’ 
expectations of it (Merton, 1948). Consider a class of students and suppose a teacher 
is given artifcial and completely arbitrary information about their respective skills 
and performance. The teacher will develop different expectations about the future 
scholastic performance of each student. There is a high probability that many of the 
teacher’s expectations will be confrmed by the actual performance of the students. 
This, of course, depends on the fact that the teacher, maybe without even realizing 
it, will adopt discriminating behavior according to the expectations that they have 
toward each student: those considered promising will receive more attention, guid￾ance, and tutorship, so that in fact they will have more opportunities than the others 
to improve their performances (Rosenthal, 2002).
The contrast between the attitudes of parties and the new information they may 
acquire produces a cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) that tends to be resolved 
by selecting away or altering the interpretation of the problematic new information. 
Breaking the vicious circle necessarily goes through a modifcation of the attitudes 
of parties that might require a long time process (Snyder & Diesing, 1977).
9 Confict Analysis159
Issues
As we have just seen, determining the cause or causes of a confict is not at all 
straightforward. This not only depends on the complexity of the contexts in which 
conficts are generated but also on the structure of confict formations themselves. 
To understand the origins of a confict, however, it is important to investigate the 
development of the incompatibility that determines what the confict is about. 
Generally speaking, the content of a confict can be conceived in terms of an incom￾patibility between the goals of the actors.
A goal for an actor in a confict is something that they wish to obtain and for 
which they are motivated to compete with or even oppose other actors. It is impor￾tant to consider the motivation an actor has to pursue certain goals because it deter￾mines their willingness to pay certain prices in the confict. Identifying what the 
actors want to achieve in a confict might be complex, even for the parties them￾selves; besides, goals might change as a result of the confict itself.
To identify the goals of the actors in a confict and to understand why they are 
incompatible, it is useful to try to classify the issues that may trigger conficts. Two 
macro-categories are considered here: on the one hand, resources, and, on the other 
hand values and beliefs (see also Deutsch, 1973; Jeong, 2008).
Resources
The goal of the actors might be to obtain or control certain resources. Goals of this 
sort become incompatible when the resources are limited, such as a certain amount 
of money or land, or indivisible, such as an object, a person, and a position. As we 
have seen, Max Weber (1947) proposed a distinction between three categories of 
resources: wealth, power, and prestige. Wealth indicates mostly material things: it 
may be money, land, goods, and any form of valuable possession.
Power is traditionally challenging to defne, but in this context an actor is power￾ful if they can get other actors to act according to his will. This sort of power can be 
exercised either by promising rewards of threatening punishments. Power in this 
sense is immaterial; therefore, it might not be obvious why it should be either lim￾ited or indivisible. The reason for this is that power is an asymmetric relation 
between two actors: just like in the master-slave dialectics, one has authority and the 
other in turn is responsible; therefore, the more powerful one is, the less powerful is 
the other.
Prestige is also an elusive notion. It is synonymous with reputation and respect. 
Just like power can only be defned as a relation between an actor and those upon 
which they can impose their will, hence the prestige of an actor can only be defned 
as a relation between the actor and those who respect them. As opposed to power, 
however, prestige also essentially depends on the specifc values and conceptions of 
the group who attributes prestige. Just like power, however, prestige is a limited 
Issues160
resource because it implies a ranking in which people or groups are credited with 
more or less reputation; besides, prestige may not only be pursued for its own sake 
but also because it provides power.
Values and Beliefs
The incompatibility that generates a confict might also concern values and beliefs; 
in this case, the goal of the actors is to enforce or defend certain systems of values 
and beliefs. The determination of the nature of both values and beliefs is open to 
philosophical debate. As we have seen, an actor’s beliefs can be usefully conceived 
as their mental representations, the states of affairs they can represent as true. To 
understand what values are, it is safe enough here to be content with the idea of 
evaluative thinking as the sort of reasoning we perform when we judge things to be 
good or bad, true or false, right or wrong. A distinction can be drawn in this regard 
between judgments of fact and judgments of value: while judgments of fact, such as 
“The earth is round”, express one’s beliefs, judgments of value, such as “Killing 
animals is wrong”, express one’s values.
Values and beliefs are rooted in systems of conceptions about the world, our￾selves, and other people. They determine one’s preferences about courses of actions 
and events. For instance, a politician might judge it preferable that European coun￾tries welcome sub-Saharan migrants and refugees and struggle for their integration, 
rather than bargain with Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt to stop them with 
whatever means possible before trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea; and so, they 
might allocate budget resources for immigration welcoming policies. Another poli￾tician might have different values and different preferences and might therefore 
challenge the actions of the frst one.
In effect, a confict may also rise on values and beliefs themselves. In this sense, 
parties may oppose each other because they interpret things differently and do not 
accept the conceptions of the other parties. It is sometimes argued that values and 
beliefs are relative and perspectival. It is important to understand exactly what 
that means.
Let us begin by introducing the distinction between subjective, intersubjective, 
and objective judgments. A judgment is subjective when the criteria for its correct￾ness depend on the single individual who makes it. For instance, “The wall looks 
white to me” is a subjective judgment because only I can tell how the wall looks to 
me. Similarly, the judgment “Pistachio ice cream tastes good” is subjective because 
its truth only depends on my tastes. A judgment is intersubjective if its correctness 
depends on what the community of the judger takes to be correct. Again, for exam￾ple, the judgment of fact “Snow looks white” and the judgment of value “Kissing in 
public is acceptable” are intersubjective. Finally, an objective judgment is a judg￾ment whose correctness depends on facts of the matter. Thus, “The earth is round” 
and “Killing people is wrong” are objective judgments.
9 Confict Analysis161
Now, an incompatibility between judgments could rise only if the values or 
beliefs they express are evaluated according to the same criteria. In this sense, there 
is no possibility of raising a confict on subjective judgments: if I judge that 
“Pistachio tastes good” and you judge that “Pistachio tastes awful”, these two judg￾ments might well be true together: de gustibus non disputandum est. For the same 
reason, a confict might arise on intersubjective matters only inside a given com￾munity. Typically, however, conficts are generated by incompatible beliefs and val￾ues on the objective level. When a vegetarian says that “Killing animals is wrong”, 
they mean that it is objectively wrong and, if questioned, they will try to argue their 
point by providing objective evidence of it. If values and beliefs were merely sub￾jective, in fact, conficts about them could not even be explained.
Though objective, however, judgments of fact and of value might well be falli￾ble. This has nothing to do with the subjectivity, intersubjectivity, or objectivity of a 
judgment. A judgment is fallible because it could be wrong. When people who 
engage in conficts over values or beliefs are conscious of the fallibility of their own 
conceptions, they allow, in principle, the possibility of changing them; actually the 
confict might just be the process they choose to amend their values and beliefs.
Conversely, it is also important to stress the social dimension of evaluative and 
factual judgments. Values and beliefs are immersed in a social system that often 
tends to confrm and enforce them through law, religion, customs, language, and so 
on. Systems of values, then, are a strong way to characterize the identity of social 
groups. It is often the case, however, that different systems of values interact and 
compete within the same social group. When conficts arise, opposing parties tend 
to rally together under their different systems of values and beliefs. Values and 
beliefs can also intentionally be used to that purpose to mobilize groups of people. 
It might also be the case then that values and conceptions are used to mask other 
issues: conficts that apparently rise over systems of values and beliefs might be 
discovered to be about material resources.
Needs
While the analysis of the issues may help in understanding the origins and the 
dynamics of a confict, the motivations of the actors are often diffcult to explain 
without considering the fundamental human needs. In confict analysis, for instance, 
John W. Burton (1990) and Herbert Kelman (2002) argued that the account of 
human needs is essential in understanding the root causes of confictual situations. 
When a confict involves the negation of these needs, it cannot be resolved except 
by satisfying them frst. But what are the fundamental human needs? Needs should 
be distinguished from wants, desires, and other subjective exigencies: human needs 
objectively follow from the nature of human beings (Galtung, 1988); in fact, an 
individual has needs even if they are unaware of them.
The American psychologist Abraham Maslow famously tried to provide a gen￾eral classifcation of “social needs” (Maslow, 1954). He proposed a pyramidal 
Needs162
Self￾actualization
Esteem
Love/Belonging
Safety

Fig. 9.1 Maslow’s 
hierarchy of needs
representation where the more fundamental needs lay at the bottom of the hierarchy 
(Fig. 9.1). Higher needs become relevant for the motivation of an individual behav￾ior only once the lower ones have been met.
Physiology. These needs concern physical survival and are those an individual 
seeks to meet frst. They include air, water, food, clothing, shelter, sex, and so on. 
The list of physiological needs varies, however, according to the level at which the 
functioning of the human body is considered.
Safety. A human being needs to feel physically and psychologically safe. Maslow 
lists “security; stability; dependency; protection; freedom from fear, from anxiety 
and chaos; need for structure, order, law, limits; strength in the protector; and so on” 
(ibid., p. 39). These needs are put at risk not only by wars and natural catastrophes 
but also by economic crises. The need for security motivates an individual’s prefer￾ence for ordered societies where health, job, and welfare in general are guaranteed.
Love and Belonging. Human beings need to feel as if they belong and are 
accepted in their social group. They need to love and be loved.
Esteem. Lack of respect by others as well as lack of self-respect may be trauma￾tizing even for an individual who is otherwise well integrated in their social group. 
This sort of need may trigger conficts about prestige.
Self-actualization. Maslow notices that once all the other needs are met, a human 
being still may feel dissatisfed. With regard to their needs, the words with which 
Ulysses incites his men in the 26th Canto of the Inferno in Dante’s Divine Comedy 
come to mind: “fatti non foste a viver come bruti, ma per seguir virtute e canoscenza” 
(Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes, But virtue to pursue and knowledge 
high). The form this need assumes obviously varies from individual to individual.
Other categories of needs have been put forward in psychology and sociology. 
Galtung (1988), for instance, proposed a typology of the basic social (as opposed to 
natural) needs through a double distinction. On one hand, he distinguished between 
material needs and nonmaterial needs, while, on the other hand, he distinguished the 
needs whose satisfaction depends on other actors from those whose satisfaction 
depends on the social structure. The fourth classes that result from this articulation 
are exemplifed as follows (Table 9.1).
9 Confict Analysis163
Table 9.1 Fundamental needs
Agent Social structure
Material Security Welfare
Non-material Freedom Identity
The need for security is a material need that depends on other actors because it is 
negated by direct violence. The need for freedom is a non-material need that depends 
on other actors because it is negated by repression. The need for welfare is a mate￾rial need dependent on social structure, whose negation is misery. The need for 
identity and recognition is a non-material need dependent on the social structure, 
whose negation is alienation.
It is easy to see that different classifcations and characterizations tend to over￾lap. As far as the analysis of conficts is concerned, the acknowledgment of the 
existence of fundamental human needs explains why their negation gives rise to 
what otherwise appear to be intractable conficts.
Adversarial Actions
In this section, we will explore a typology of fully articulated conficts proposed by 
Emanuele Arielli and Giovanni Scotto (2003) based on a classifcation of confictual 
actions. As we have seen, a classifcatory analysis of the adversarial actions agents 
choose to perform is quite useful for the proper characterization of their behavior in 
a confict.
In their typology, Arielli and Scotto look at conficts from the point of view of 
action theory. They defne as confictual any situations in which the satisfaction of 
an agent’s need or desire is preempted by the action of another agent (ibid., p. 18). 
As we have seen, however, this type of approach tends to overlook latent conficts. 
It is for this reason that Arielli and Scotto extend the notion of action to include not 
only the behavior of the actors but also the states of affairs produced by it. In this 
way, their analysis takes into account both manifest and latent conficts, because the 
states of affairs produced by an action may determine structures that engender indi￾rect latent conficts.
A Typology
According to the defnition provided by Arielli and Scotto, actions are confictual 
when they preempt the satisfaction of the needs or desires of other actors. Preemption 
may be direct or indirect. On the one hand, a confictual action might be directed 
toward what the agent desires in order to contend it, or toward the very action of the 
Adversarial Actions164
agent in order to contrast it, or even against the actor himself in order to damage 
them. On the other hand, an action might also be confictual because it is uncoopera￾tive, and thus indirectly preempts the satisfaction of an agent’s desires. These four 
cases are the basis for Arielli and Scotto’s typology of the structure of conficts.
Type I: Divergence. The frst type of confict is characterized by the fact that the 
conficting agents are in a situation in which they are supposed to cooperate. In this 
case, the incompatibility is indirectly produced by the effects of the independent 
behavior of the agents. The confict originates when the agents choose not to coop￾erate, and their actions impede the satisfaction of one another’s goals. This may 
happen because the agents have different pro-attitudes, and they therefore pursue 
different goals; for instance, the players of a football team who prefer showing off 
over teamwork, or a husband and wife who fght about the destination of their vaca￾tion are conficts of type I. In these cases, they act to obtain different goals while 
they should cooperate. Agents who share the same pro-attitudes, however, might 
also cease to cooperate if they have different instrumental beliefs and thus pursue 
the same goal with different strategies; for example, different groups of activists of 
the same movement who share the same values and desires may decide to pursue 
their common goals with violent and nonviolent means. In this case, the two groups 
of activists have different beliefs about what sorts of actions would lead to the suc￾cess of their requests.
Type II: Competition. The second type of confict consists of two (or more) dif￾ferent actors who have the same goal and directly compete for the same limited or 
indivisible resource. In this case, agents possibly have the same pro-attitudes and 
the same beliefs, but what they want cannot be obtained simultaneously by all of 
them; for instance, nations who aim to obtain the exclusive control over certain 
natural resources, or companies who compete for the same slice of the market, or 
again politicians who campaign to win the elections are all conficts of this kind.
Type III: Contrast. In the third type of confict, the actions of one agent aim 
directly to modify the actions of another agent. This kind of confict does not consist 
as much in fair competition as in putting a spoke in each other’s wheel, so to speak. 
There are several ways in which this can be done, from reducing the opponent’s 
possibilities for action to direct sabotage. Reciprocal contrast is characteristic of the 
notion of strategy: actors decide what to do in function of what other actors do (or 
what they think they will do). In this type of confict, however, it may also be the 
case that the parties stop pursuing their goals altogether and simply try to hinder one 
another’s actions.
Type IV: Aggression. The fourth type of confict is characterized by actions 
directed against other actors. These sorts of aggressive actions aim to alter the tar￾get, by limiting its freedom to act in various ways: from controlling it, to damaging 
it, up to putting its very existence at risk.
9 Confict Analysis165
Questioning Some Distinctions
Arielli and Scotto admit that what their classifcation singles out are only ideal 
types, and that these ideal types inevitably become confused with one another in the 
structure of actual conficts. It is important, then, to further discuss the distinctions 
drawn by this typology.
Competition vs. Contrast
The frst distinction worth investigating is the distinction between conficts of type 
II and conficts of type III. As we have just seen, conficts of type II consist in a 
competition between two or more actors for a limited resource, whereas conficts of 
type III consist in a (possibly reciprocal) contrast directed against the very actions 
of the competing actors. The problem with drawing a sharp distinction between 
these two sorts of structures is that in actual conficts actors often adopt both com￾petitive and contrastive strategies against each other in order to prevail. Besides, as 
a matter of fact, it is not always obvious whether a certain action is simply aimed at 
contending for certain goals with another party in the confict or if it is directed 
instead to hinder the actions of another party.
Consider, for instance, a company that plans an advertising campaign for its 
product. One might try to distinguish between two general options: on the one hand, 
the campaign could aim to show the quality of the company or of the product, and, 
on the other hand, it could seek to show that the product is better than another com￾petitor’s. In the frst case, the advertising campaign is only directed toward the goal 
of the company that is selling the product to the group of potential customers for 
whom the company contends with its competitors. In the second case, the advertis￾ing campaign is also directed against what the competitors could do to contend for 
the same group of customers. The former would be a case of competition, and the 
latter a case of contrast.
Distinguishing between fair and unfair competition, however, is not always easy. 
Consider those commercials whose aim is neither to praise a product nor to compare 
it to other products, but only to make a product or a company “top of mind” in a group 
of potential customers. Is a campaign based on such commercials an action of compe￾tition or contrast? In a way, it is only directed to the goal of the company that promotes 
it: selling the product. In another sense, however, it also contrasts the actions of the 
company’s competitors because it monopolizes the attention of the customers, which 
it could certainly be argued is what companies are really competing for.
It is for this reason that in several cases the distinction is typically governed by 
rules which are acknowledged by the parties or even imposed on them by an exter￾nal authority. The rules of football, for instance, establish whether a certain action 
is legitimate as part of the fair competition between the teams or if it is a foul that 
must be punished. The fair competition of companies in the marketplace is gov￾erned by rules established by antitrust legislations and regulation of marketing and 
advertising.
Adversarial Actions166
Contrast vs. Aggression
In practice, the distinction between contrast and aggression is also often diffcult to 
draw. The problem in this case has to do with the proper characterization of what 
pertains to an actor and what pertains instead to their actions. Suppose a police off￾cer stops someone from walking down a street. Is the offcer contrasting the action 
of that person, or is the offcer acting against them by limiting their freedom to 
move? It seems the answer depends on how the offcer stops the person, on whether 
violent actions are adopted.
Violence is often used as a discrimen in the discussion about non-violent strate￾gies in confict management. Some of the actions that can be performed to contrast 
an opposing agent are not violent, such as noncollaboration, civil disobedience, and 
boycotting. Other contrasting actions, instead, are violent: they consist in breaking 
down the means by which another actor operates. It is debatable, however, whether 
certain violent actions that aim to limit the possibility for action by another party are 
to be considered conficts of type III or type IV. Sabotage is a case in point: it is an 
action directed to hinder an activity by damaging the actor’s resources. In this sense, 
it is not to be considered an aggression; however, in the legislation of several coun￾tries it is considered a crime. Mahatma Gandhi, for instance, explicitly considered it 
as a form of violence.
Just like in the case of the distinction between competition and contrast, whether 
a certain action is to be considered as a mere contrastive action or as an actual 
aggression highly depends on the interpretation that the actors give to it in the con￾text of the confict. An interesting example is the concept of “preventive war”, 
unprecedentedly advocated by the Bush administration regarding the confict 
against terrorism after the September 11, 2001, attack. Such a concept is now used 
to refer to war actions which are a paradigmatic form of aggression, but at the same 
time it is intended to present these actions as a mere strategy for contrasting an 
opponent. The purpose of the concept was to foster an interpretation of the confict 
in question as type III instead of type IV and, thus, a different distribution of respon￾sibility among the parties.
Confict-Copying Styles
Cultural perspectives, systems of values, and power relations affect human action and 
communication. Depending on these and on the price they are willing to pay to reach 
their goals, agents may consider and prefer different tactics to pursue their strategies 
in different phases of the management of the confict. The different approaches an 
agent may adopt in coping with a confict can be usefully classifed in certain general 
styles. The style of behavior adopted by an agent in a confict depends on the com￾municative relations that they have with other parties. These styles, in fact, are mainly 
characterized by different communicative patterns that are infuenced by the commu￾nicative context of the confictual situation (Jeong, 2008, pp. 29–30).
9 Confict Analysis167
A rather well-known classifcation of several different styles of confict manage￾ment has been proposed in the so-called Thomas-Kilmann confict mode instru￾ment. In 1974, Ralph H. Kilmann and Kenneth W. Thomas (1977) described fve 
sorts of confict behavior by elaborating on a grid originally developed by Blake and 
Mouton (1964) as a model for identifying different leadership styles. The grid is 
articulated along two axes: assertiveness and cooperativeness. Assertiveness is the 
extent to which an individual tries to satisfy their own concerns, while cooperative￾ness is the extent to which an individual tries to satisfy the others’ concerns. The 
fve confict-copying styles are positioned on the grid according to these two dimen￾sions (Fig. 9.2).
Avoiding is unassertive and uncooperative. An actor who avoids a confict simply 
abstains from taking part in it and renounces to pursuing their goals. An actor might 
choose to avoid the confict because they think that it would entail too high a price 
to pay with respect to the utility of the goal to be achieved or the probability of 
achieving it. This is characteristic of extremely asymmetric conficts, in which the 
weaker party sees no utility in the confict. Avoidance, however, might also be a 
tactic adopted to postpone the confict, in order to strengthen one’s resources: in this 
sense, it might be part of a wider strategy.
Competing is assertive and uncooperative. A competing actor unilaterally pur￾sues their goals at the expense of others. Competing tactics might include all sorts 
of adversarial actions that may weaken or damage the opposing parties to prevent 
them from achieving anything that is incompatible with the satisfaction of one’s 
own concern. In asymmetric conficts, the more easily the stronger part adopts a 
competing style, the more unbalanced is the relation between the actors.
Accommodating is unassertive and cooperative. It is the opposite of competing 
and consists in sacrifcing the pursuit of one’s own goals in order to allow the others 
to achieve their own. When an actor chooses an accommodating style, the actor 
acknowledges, in fact, that the others’ goals are more worth pursuing than their 
own. In this sense, an accommodating actor endorses the attitudes of the other par￾ties in the confict. Clearly, accommodation might be forcefully imposed on a 
weaker party, in which case it amounts to yielding.

Compromising

Confict-Copying Styles168
Collaborating is both assertive and cooperative. When the parties in a confict 
collaborate, they work together to fnd a solution that fully satisfes their concerns. 
Since a confict originates from an incompatibility, this means that a collaborating 
style of coping with the confict also consists in the attempt to remove or overcome 
the incompatibility between the parties’ goals. Collaborative tactics involve the con￾frontation of different attitudes to build mutual cognitive environments, resolve con￾ditions that produce material incompatibilities, fnd new solutions to given problems, 
and so on.
Compromising is intermediate between both assertiveness and cooperativeness. 
Compromise is thus a middle ground with respect to the other styles. When the par￾ties in a confict seek a compromise, they try to fnd a way to partially satisfy their 
respective concerns. Contrary to collaboration, in this case the parties accept not to 
achieve their goals completely. Compromise might be an acceptable solution when 
the costs of a competition are too high and there does not seem to be a way to col￾laborate to overcome the contradiction that gives rise to the confict.
Conclusions
The purpose of this chapter was to better qualify the elements of a confict and to 
discuss them: the parties, their attitudes, their behaviors, and the issues on which 
they oppose each other. As we have seen, identifying these elements in a confictual 
situation could be diffcult because all these elements are subject to interpretation. 
Who the parties are depends on how their roles and potentialities in certain social 
relations are understood. What the parties think about themselves, others, and the 
confict in general is affected by unconscious processes of polarization and self￾confrming belief-action-belief loops, the effect of which is often to reduce their 
mutual cognitive environments. The consequences of the parties’ behavior as well 
as their responsibilities vary according to the interpretation given to their actions. 
What the confict is about is often different from what parties aim to obtain from the 
confict with the only common ground being—if one is willing to accept the idea—
the satisfaction of each individual’s social needs.
The fact that almost all the components of a confictual situation are subject to 
interpretation, though not surprising, might still be acknowledged with dismay. One 
might think that if everything were objective, then conficts would be easier to man￾age. Yet, clearly, this is a misconception because, as it is easy to see, objective issues 
are incompatibilities nonetheless. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. The fact that con￾ficts are oriented by how their components are interpreted allows for the possibility 
of intervening in the cognitive environments of the parties, determining those inter￾pretations by communicative means. To understand how this is done, however, it is 
necessary to understand how conficts are in effect oriented by the strategies parties 
pursue to obtain their goals. This is the topic of the next chapter.
9 Confict Analysis169
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we presented the main elements that must be taken into account in 
the analysis of a confictual situation. As we saw in the previous chapter, Johan 
Galtung suggests that these elements can be classifed as the attitudes of the parties, 
their behaviors and the contradictions that generate the confict.
First, we focused on the attitudes of a confict’s potential actors. We noticed that 
actions are always subject to interpretation. In Donald Davidson’s classical 
approach, explaining an action requires the attribution to the agent of a pro-attitude 
and a set of beliefs about how to satisfy it. The need to interpret actions is the reason 
why it is sometimes diffcult to identify the parties of a confict. The structure of a 
confict may also involve allies and third parties with their own attitudes and beliefs. 
Since they are often decisive for the dynamics of a confict, they also play a delicate 
role. The important point to notice is that all the attitudes and beliefs that form the 
parties’ cognitive environments and explain their actions can be transformed by 
communication.
Second, we considered the contradictions that originate conficts. These usually 
involve one or more issues. Issues can be material or immaterial resources. Max 
Weber suggested that there are three main categories of resources: wealth, power, 
and prestige. But a confict’s issues may also involve the parties’ values or even their 
very beliefs, when these are construed as objective. A confict’s contradiction, how￾ever, may also regard the needs of the parties. Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of fun￾damental human needs and Johan Galtung’s typology of social needs are useful to 
understand why, when a confict places the parties’ fundamental needs at risk, it can 
rarely be transformed in a positive way until those needs are protected.
Finally, the behavior of the parties in a confict may consist in different types of 
actions and different styles of copying with the confictual situations itself. 
Adversarial actions vary from mere divergence to competition, contrast, and even 
aggression. Parties may be more or less assertive or cooperative: they may prefer to 
avoid the confict, accommodate the requests of the other parties, collaborate with 
them, search for compromises, or just compete with one another.

Chapter 10
Confict Dynamics
In this chapter, we will try to investigate how parties may develop strategies and 
orient the dynamics of a confict to obtain their goals. In order to do so, we will 
make use of the technical framework of Game Theory. Our purpose will be to not 
only understand how parties may interact in a confictual situation but also identify 
the necessary conditions to render this interaction positive and cooperative.
Interaction and Strategies
Generally speaking, a strategy is a plan to cope with a certain situation. In a confict, 
an actor’s strategy dictates their choices as to what actions to undertake. Lulofs and 
Cahn, for instance, distinguish strategies from tactics where a tactic is “a specifc 
observable action that moves a confict in a particular direction in line with the strat￾egy” (Lulofs & Cahn, 2000, p. 100). Thinking actions in terms of tactics encourages 
seeing them as part of the strategy that parties adopt inside a confictual situation.
To understand the notion of a strategy in the dynamics of a confict, it is impor￾tant to distinguish between two sorts of strategic reasoning. Consider the following 
situation frst. You are a skipper, and you are planning to sail across the Atlantic 
Ocean from Europe to the US. There are two main routes to do the crossing: a north￾ern stormier one from Ireland to Canada and a more southern and relaxed one from 
Portugal to Florida. Which one would you choose? It obviously depends on whether 
you prefer speed or safety, and you must seriously evaluate your boat’s conditions 
as well as your abilities; besides, you must thoroughly examine the weather fore￾casts and consider what possible accidents might occur: storms might damage your 
sails, light winds might force you to turn on the engine, and so on. You must be 
prepared to act and deal with these eventualities: board a spare rig of sails, store 
enough fuel, and so on.

Consider now a different situation. You are playing chess against someone else, 
and you must plan your moves to checkmate your opponent. In order to do that, you 
must take into account several different scenarios depending on the moves your 
opponent might decide to make. Without question, your opponent’s moves are not 
random: they react to what you do; therefore, their moves depend on yours. Among 
the moves you are allowed to play at every turn, you will choose the one you think 
would produce the best outcome for you depending on what your opponent might 
choose to do; and your opponent will act in kind to obtain the best outcome for 
themselves.
What is the difference between these two situations and the strategies that allow 
one to cope with them? In both cases, an agent is confronted with the task of deter￾mining a course of action in reason of the likelihood of certain events and their 
preferences with respect to the outcomes of those actions in those circumstances. In 
the former situation, the events are natural incidents that could happen indepen￾dently from what the agent decides to do. In the latter situation, instead, the events 
are the actions of a second agent who has their own strategy and takes into account 
what the other might decide to do. The sort of reasoning to be adopted in the two 
cases, in fact, is quite different. In the former, the strategy depends on the probabil￾ity of uncertain incidents; in this sense, this is a type of parametric reasoning. In the 
latter, the strategy depends on the outcomes of the interaction of the choices of the 
two agents; this is, instead, a strategic reasoning. Usually, the parties of a confict 
oppose one another in a context in which several events may occur, and they must 
therefore adopt both parametric and strategic reasoning. In order to focus on the 
interaction of the agents’ strategies, we will however allow ourselves some idealiza￾tion: we will bracket any parametric reasoning the parties involved in a confict may 
have to make and consider their strategies as exclusively of the latter sort. 
Specifcally, we will focus on the fact that in making their decisions the agents must 
consider that their actions are interdependent.
But what is the strategic reasoning that allows the parties to determine their 
course of action? When we dealt with the notion of mutual knowledge in Chap. 4, 
we had already discussed a situation that requires strategic reasoning: we called it 
“the two generals’ paradox”. Two generals, A and B, of two allied armies, have to 
coordinate an attack against an enemy army, which is bigger than each of them 
separately. If the allied armies attack together, they may suffer some losses but they 
will win; however, if only one of them attacks, in all probability it will be crushed. 
Now, consider, for instance, what general A’s reasoning could be. If A believes that 
B will attack, A should attack as well in order to ensure victory. But B might prefer 
not to put themselves at risk and let A engage the enemy alone instead; thus, A might 
think that if B thinks that A will attack, then B will not attack, in which case A should 
not attack either. What is the most rational choice then for A? Is mutual knowledge 
the problem again? Would communication between the two generals make any 
difference? These are just the sort of questions investigated in Game Theory.

Game Theory
Game Theory is the study of decision-making in multi-agent interaction situations; 
in other words, it studies the way in which agents take rational decisions on the basis 
of their preferences in situations in which the outcomes of their choices are infu￾enced by the choices of other agents. Game Theory was originally defned as a for￾mal theory by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern to model economic 
behavior (von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944), but it has been developed since then 
and applied in innumerable felds: from warfare to gambling, from psychology to 
biology, from logic to computer sciences and artifcial intelligence. According to the 
economist, Nobel laureate Roger Myerson “Game Theory can be defned as the 
study of mathematical models of confict and cooperation between intelligent ratio￾nal decision-makers” (Myerson, 1991, p. 1). In this sense, Game Theory may help 
us in understanding the reasoning that determines the strategies of the agents in a 
confictual situation (Rapoport, 1974). The general lines of Game Theory will be 
introduced in this section for illustrative purposes only.1
In Game Theory, a confictual situation is modeled as a game, where obviously a 
game is a technical concept. In order to defne a game, a list of players must be 
specifed along with their preferences, their information as well as the actions avail￾able to them, and the possible outcomes of the game must be determined. Many 
different sorts of games can be classifed by varying these components, and we will 
consider some of them below.
In basically every game, however, the possibility of modeling strategic reasoning 
in Game Theory is grounded in the assumption that players are perfectly rational. 
This assumption requires some qualifcation, since rationality is clearly an extremely 
delicate and complex concept, which can be analyzed in countless ways. Game 
Theory employs a very specifc “economic” notion of rationality: in Game Theory, 
a rational agent is an agent who chooses a strategy to maximize their utility. An 
agent’s utility is a measure of their preferences for the possible outcomes of a game. 
To illustrate this idea, consider someone who buys a ticket at a charity raffe: there 
are several prizes, and they have preferences about what they would like to win. 
Their preferences can be represented as the utility that the possible outcomes of the 
raffe have for them: from the minimal utility of the case in which they do not win 
anything, to the maximal utility of the case in which they win, say, a bike.2
 The util￾ity of an outcome for an agent can simply be formalized by assigning a payoff value 
to it that represents how desirable is the action for the agent. Notice that in this sense 
utility is a subjective measure.
1More detailed presentations can be found, for instance, in Binmore (2007b), Myerson (1991), and 
Tadelis (2013).
2Notice, however, that the outcomes of the raffe are not infuenced by the actions of the players; 
therefore, just like in the case of the transatlantic crossing, we do not actually need Game Theory 
to model the reasoning of the players in this game.
Game Theory174
In Game Theory, a strategy is a plan of the actions that an agent might decide to 
undertake at all the points at which the game requires them to choose what to do. If the 
game consists in one decision point only, a strategy is just an action. More often, games 
require players to make decisions at several points. In a chess game, for instance, a 
player must choose a move at every turn: their strategy will be the list of all the actions 
they decide to make. Games in which players must choose their strategies individually 
are called non-cooperative games, whereas games where players are allowed or forced 
to coordinate their strategies are called cooperative games. We will begin by focusing 
on the former. Let us review some examples in order to illustrate these concepts.
Consider, again, the confict mentioned in Chap. 9 between a husband and wife 
arguing about their vacation destination. Let us try to model it as a game. There are 
obviously two players in this game: the husband and the wife. The actors have only 
one decision to make, and they must make it simultaneously; therefore, there are only 
two strategies: going to the mountains and going to the sea. Combinatorics tells us that 
there are four possible outcomes for this game: the husband goes to the mountains and 
the wife goes to the sea, the husband goes to the sea and the wife goes to the moun￾tains, they both go to the mountains, and they both go to the sea. Now suppose that the 
husband wants to go to the mountains and the wife to the sea. These are the prefer￾ences of the players, and they defne their respective payoffs for the possible outcomes 
of the game. Let us do this by assigning an ordinal number to each of them starting 
with the less desirable one; in fact, this amounts to defning a utility function for each 
of the players. Suppose the utility function for the wife can be defned as follows:
Wife:
Wife goes to the mountains and husband goes to the sea: 0
Wife goes to the sea and husband goes to the mountains: 1
Both wife and husband go to the mountains: 2
Both wife and husband go to the sea: 3
The utility function for the husband, instead, is the following:
Husband:
Wife goes to the mountains and husband goes to the sea: 0
Wife goes to the sea and husband goes to the mountains: 1
Both wife and husband go to the sea: 2
Both wife and husband go to the mountains: 3
The payoffs can be represented in a matrix like the one depicted in Fig. 10.1.
Each cell of the matrix represent a different possible outcome of the game, 
resulting from the combination of the strategies of the husband (represented in the 
columns) and those of the wife (represented in the rows). The two values in each 
cell of the matrix represents the payoffs of the outcome for the players: the value 
on the left is the payoff for the wife and the value on the right is the payoff for the 
husband.
The situation described in this game is often used for illustrative purposes in the 
literature on Game Theory and is known as “the battle of sexes”. Notice that the 
rankings of the payoffs represent the fact that the choices of one actor are infuenced

by the choices of the other: for instance, the wife would like to go to the sea, but she 
prefers not to go to the sea if the husband decides to go to the mountains. Compare 
now the matrix in Fig. 10.1 with the matrix in Fig. 10.2, which represents another 
distribution of the payoffs for the husband and wife. In this case, the utility func￾tions of the players make explicit that their choices have no infuence on one another: 
the wife will go to the sea, and the husband will go to the mountains regardless of 
what the spouse chooses to do; in fact, we do not really need Game Theory to model 
this situation.
Notice also that the utility functions of the battle of sexes represented in Fig. 10.1
determine a distribution of the payoffs in such a way that certain outcomes are more 
preferable than others to both players; for instance, it is preferable for the couple to 
go both to the sea (top left cell) and to the mountains (bottom right cell), rather than 
go separately to different destinations (either top right or bottom left cell). A game 
in which the sum of the payoffs is different for different outcomes is called a 
variable-sum game. To the contrary, a game in which the sum of the payoffs is the 
same for different outcomes is called a constant sum game, or, more often, a zero￾sum game. In every outcome in a zero-sum game, what is gained by one player is 
lost by the others; therefore, if losses are represented by a negative payoff, then their 
sum is constantly zero. Zero-sum games model confictual situations of pure 
Game Theory176
competition. A paradigmatic example of a zero-sum game is rock-paper-scissors, 
whose matrix is depicted in Fig. 10.3.
Let us now ask what strategy a rational player of the battle of the sexes should 
choose. According to the distribution of the payoffs the husband should decide to go 
to the mountains if the wife decides to go to the mountains, and he should decide to go 
to the sea if the wife decides to go to the sea. Similarly, the wife should decide to go 
to the mountains if the husband decides to go to the mountains, and she should decide 
to go to the sea if the husband decides to go to the sea. In Game Theory, a strategy that 
leads to a higher payoff than another is said to dominate the other. It might be useful 
to represent the relations of dominance inside the matrix of a game by means of arrows 
connecting the cells. In Fig. 10.4, for instance, horizontal arrows represent the wife’s 
dominant strategies, while vertical arrows represent those of the husband.
There is clearly no strictly dominant strategy for any of the players in this game, 
that is, no strategy worth adopting for a player independently of what the others 
decide to do. In games such as this, each player must try to “read the mind” of the 
others to understand what their strategies could be and make their own choices 
accordingly.
We have said that Game Theory is based on a rationality assumption according 
to which players make their choices in order to maximize their utilities; hence, 
Game Theory invites us to think of a game as a utility maximization problem that 
each single player must solve. In this sense, the strategies that allow all players to 
obtain the best possible outcomes for themselves could be considered as the solu￾tions of the game. What counts as a solution, naturally, depends on what is to be 
considered the best possible outcome for all the player. The main contribution to 
Game Theory by John Nash, which extended and generalized the original work of 
von Neumann and Morgenstern, was a proposal for the formal analysis of this idea 
(Nash, 1950a, 1950b, 1951, 1953). According to Nash, the maximal utility for the 
players could be obtained in terms of the maximal consistency or “equilibrium” 
between their strategies. An analogy might be useful to shed some light on this

concept. In physics, equilibrium is the balance of opposing forces: a system is said 
to be in equilibrium when it keeps its motion and internal energy constant over time 
unless some external force intervenes. Likewise, in Game Theory a game is in equi￾librium when the strategies adopted by the players balance one another, meaning 
they are the best set of strategies that each player can adopt given the strategies of 
the others, so that none of them would change it unless some other player changes 
theirs. More explicitly, we can say that a set of strategies is a Nash Equilibrium if 
and only if no player could improve their payoff by changing their strategy, given 
the strategies of all the other players in the game.
As it is easy to demonstrate, the “battle of sexes” game has two Nash Equilibria: 
both husband and wife decide to go to the mountains, or they both decide to go to 
the sea. In this sense, it has two solutions: two sets of strategies that lead to out￾comes that would satisfy each player given the choices of the others. There are 
games which do not have any pure Nash Equilibrium. For instance, the rock-paper￾scissors game seems to have no solution because for every outcome, the losing 
player always has a better strategy to choose: if they played rock and the opponent 
won by playing paper, they could have had a better payoff by playing scissors, and 
so on. Nash (1950a) proved, however, that there always exists a Nash Equilibrium 
in games with a fnite number of players and a fnite number of pure strategies that 
they might choose if mixed strategies are allowed, where a mixed strategy is an 
assignment of probabilities to the different pure strategies.3
3Thus, a Nash Equilibrium for the rock-paper-scissors game is for both players a mixed strategy in 
which rock has probability 1/3, paper has probability 1/3, and scissors has probability 1/3 Consider 
a player A. Assuming that the sum of the probabilities that opponent B would choose any single 
strategy is 
PB(rock) + PB(paper) + PB(scissors) = 1
The result can be obtained as the solution of a linear system of the following equations that 
defne the expected value (EV ) of a player for every possible outcome.
EV[PA(rock)] = 0 × PB(rock) + (-1) × PB(paper) + 1 × PB(scissors)
EV[PA(paper)] = 1 × PB(rock) + 0 × PB(paper) + (-1) × PB(scissors)
EV[PA(scissors)] = (-1) × PB(rock) + 1 × PB(paper) + 0 × PB(scissors)
The same holds true for the other player.
Game Theory178
Now, the concept of a Nash Equilibrium as the solution of a game provides an 
answer to the question regarding what sort of reasoning allows the parties in a con￾fict to determine their strategies: the parties should defne their respective utility 
functions and look for a Nash Equilibrium. Let us try to apply this idea to the prob￾lem of coordination of the two allied generals. In this situation, generals A and B
have two choices: attack or retreat. The game therefore has four possible outcomes. 
The two generals would like to attack together, but if the ally retreats, they prefer to 
retreat as well. The utility functions for the two generals rank these outcomes specu￾larly from the least to the most preferred. Both prefer to attack when the ally chooses 
to attack, but if the ally retreats, they prefer to pull back as well. A matrix for the 
game of the two generals is depicted in Fig. 10.5.
It is easy to see that no one has a strictly dominant strategy in this case. Here 
again, two Nash Equilibria correspond to the expected set of strategies for both 
generals: attack if the other attacks, retreat if the other retreats.
The two generals’ confictual situation is in fact a well-known case study in 
Game Theory. The paradigmatic illustration of such a situation is traced back to an 
example considered by Rousseau in the second part of the Discourse on the Origin 
of Inequality:
If it was a matter of hunting a deer, everyone well realized that he must remain faithful to 
his post; but if a hare happened to pass within reach of one of them, we cannot doubt that 
he would have gone off in pursuit of it without scruple. (Pl., III, pp. 165–167)
Suppose that each hunter has only two options: either hunting the stag or hunting 
the hare. On the one hand, the stag is a valuable prey, but the hunters can get the stag 
only if they hunt it together. The hare, on the other hand, is less valuable but each 
hunter could get it by themselves. This is the structure of a Stag Hunt game 
(Fig. 10.6).
Since there are two solutions to this sort of game, the players must understand 
what the others will do in order to establish what is more convenient for them to do 
subsequently.
Game Theory makes explicit the strategic reasoning of the parties of a confict in 
terms of a formal model. Notice how the game-theoretic analysis has confrmed the 
intuition we had regarding what agents should do in the different games considered 
in this section. This, however, is not always the case.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma: Rationality vs. Cooperation
Let us now discuss another strategic problem considered a paradigmatic illustration 
of how Game Theory applies to the study of conficts (cf. Rapoport & Chammah, 
1965). The confictual situation in question is often described along the lines of the 
following anecdote attributed to the mathematician Albert W. Tucker.
Two bank robbers have been arrested by the police for a minor crime. The penalty for this 
crime is two years in prison. The police knows that they have also robbed a bank but have 
enough evidence to prosecute them for the minor crime only. The offcers therefore make 
an offer to each prisoner separately, asking each of them to confess to the robbery and turn 
the other one in. If one cooperates and the other does not, the frst goes free and the other 
receives a full sentence for the bank robbery, that is, ten years of prison. If they both plead 
guilty, however, they both receive a reduced sentence of fve years.
This is the so-called Prisoner’s Dilemma. It is a decision problem that can be mod￾eled as a variable-sum game for two players: prisoner A and prisoner B. They only 
have two strategies available: either cooperate with one another and refuse to con￾fess or not cooperate and confess. The utilities for the two players seem clear: the 
less time spent in prison, the better is the outcome. As always, their payoffs can 
conveniently be represented in a matrix such as the one depicted in Fig. 10.7.
How should a prisoner reason? If the other prisoner confesses, then they should 
confess to obtain the reduced sentence. But if the other prisoner does not confess, 
they have even more reasons to confess, because, in that case, they could go free. 
Given that the distribution of the payoff is specular, the same reasoning works for 
both prisoners; hence, confession is the strictly dominant strategy for both players 
in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Regardless of whether the other decides to confess, a 
prisoner’s best choice to maximize their utility is to confess; in fact, as it is easy to 
demonstrate, the case where both confess is the only Nash Equilibrium of the game, 
and in this sense, as we have seen, it can be considered the only rational solution of 
the confict. But is it in actual fact the case? If we look at the matrix in Fig. 10.7, 
there clearly seems to be an outcome in which both players would be better off. In 
fact, if they both refuse to confess, both will be convicted for only two years, rather 
than fve. Would this not be a better option than the one recommended by the Nash 
Equilibrium?

Fig. 10.7 The Prisoner’s 
Dilemma
To shed some light on this puzzle, let us begin by seeking an alternative sense in 
which such an option could be considered a solution of a game. The concept of 
Pareto Effciency may come in handy here. The concept applies to economics for 
identifying the best way in which certain resources can be allocated: a given alloca￾tion is Pareto effcient if there is no other allocation which improves the payoffs of 
at least one individual without making the others’ worse. The principle grounding 
Pareto Effciency can be expressed as follows:
Optimality: A distribution is optimal if under no alternative distribution all recipi￾ents would be better off.
If the concept of Pareto Effciency is applied in the context of Game Theory, it may 
provide another interpretation of what the solution of a game should be. In this 
alternative sense, the rational choice for an agent who aims to maximize their utili￾ties would be to adopt the set of strategies that guarantees fair Pareto Effciency. For 
instance, in the Prisoner’s Dilemma defned by the above matrix, the outcome (-2, 
-2) is clearly more effcient than (-5, -5), because both players are better off in the 
former. And undeniably (-2, -2) is more effcient than (-10, 0) and (0, -10) because 
in the latter of both, either one or the other player obtains a worse payoff.
Pareto Effciency alone, however, is not necessarily what to look for as a solution 
in a confictual situation. This is because an optimal distribution could simply be 
unfair: in fact, it might well be the case that the optimal distribution, given the alter￾natives, allocates very different quantities of resources to the recipients. At least 
another principle is therefore required to ensure that the distribution is fair:
Equity: If the position of the recipients is symmetric, then the distribution should be 
symmetric, that is to say, it does not vary when we switch the recipients.
Indeed, Skyrms (2004, p. 18) suggests that the principles of Optimality and Equity 
are decisive for the identifcation of the outcomes of a game that abide by distribu￾tive justice.
Now, let us consider these two notions of the solution of a game: Nash Equilibrium 
on the one hand and optimal and fair distribution on the other. In the case of the 
Prisoner’s Dilemma, it seems that Game Theory leads to a paradoxical conclusion: 
the most rational choice for the players is not what their best option seems to be. It 
10 Confict Dynamics181
is important to realize that the structure of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which generates 
this paradox, is not peculiar at all; in fact, it is shared by all games that model con￾fictual situations in which the cooperation between players is collectively conve￾nient but individually risky. The two prisoners would thus obtain the best option for 
them collectively by cooperating with one another and refusing to confess to the 
police; however, each prisoner individually is not sure that the other will cooperate, 
and clearly if the other does cooperate, it is still more convenient for each of them 
not to cooperate and turn the other in. What seems to be at issue in confictual situ￾ations such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma is whether cooperative behavior is rational, 
at least if rationality is construed in terms of the maximization of individual utility.
Recall that Thomas Hobbes describes similar behavioral dynamics in the state of 
nature. The natural condition of human beings is characterized precisely by the fact 
that everyone has the right to decide how to act by themselves, on the basis of their 
own individual preferences. It is important to realize that, according to Hobbes, the 
state of nature is a state of war not just because people may compete for limited 
resources, but rather because they do not trust one another. All things considered, 
Hobbes argues, people are created equal by nature and they think of themselves as 
equal, on average, in terms of physical and mental faculties. Thus, since no one is 
naturally designed to prevail in a possible confict, people might always think that it 
is worth competing against each other for some goal. This is an ineradicable even￾tuality. It follows that when someone has obtained something, they are afraid that 
someone else might try to take it away from them. To prevent this possibility, one is 
better off refusing any cooperation and fghting instead to destroy any power that 
might endanger them. It is for this reason that in the state of nature, people embark 
upon an all against all war. Hobbes’ diagnosis is that if human beings are free to 
make choices regarding their self-interest, then they will fnd it more rational not to 
trust each other and not cooperate, rather than come together and prosper. Hobbes 
saw the strategy of alienating everyone’s right to make choices and subjecting to the 
absolute power of the sovereign as the only way out of this confictual situation. 
Under the social contract, cooperation is not an equilibrium, but it is imposed by the 
sovereign through the threat of the use of force.
But is cooperation really irrational? When confronted with the Prisoner’s 
Dilemma, one might adopt several different approaches toward this question. On the 
one hand, one could point out that there is an irreducible contradiction between self￾interest and moral behavior and that moral behavior does not show itself to be ratio￾nal in Game Theory, simply because in Game Theory it is assumed that rational 
choices maximize individual utility. On the other hand, one could point out that the 
sort of confictual situations described by the Prisoner’s Dilemma are just too sim￾plistic: if more adequate models were provided for real-life confictual situations, 
then game-theoretic results would not seem so puzzling. Clearly, both the revision 
of the defnition of rationality and the development of the mathematics of Game 
Theory may be enterprises worth pursuing and both have been, in fact, explored at 
large in economic, sociological, and philosophical research. However, since our 
main focus here is the role of communication in the analysis and transformation of 
conficts, we will adopt a more conservative approach. On the one hand, we will 
The Prisoner’s Dilemma: Rationality vs. Cooperation182
accept the economic characterization of rationality as a working hypothesis in order 
to be able to exploit the game-theoretic framework for the analysis of the problem 
of cooperation in conficts. Notice that by doing so, we are not committing to the 
view that self-interest actually plays any fundamental role in the explanation of 
human rationality: we are only treating Game Theory as a model representing how 
the beliefs and desires of rational agents determine their behavior.4
 On the other 
hand, we will try to keep the technicalities to a minimum, since we do not aim to 
solve the problem of cooperation in Game Theory. In fact, the most interesting ques￾tion for us to ask regarding the Prisoner’s Dilemma is whether communication has 
anything to do with the puzzle.
It is sometimes noticed, for instance, that the reason why the Prisoner’s Dilemma 
is to be considered a non-cooperative game is because the players are separated and 
forbidden from communicating with one another: it is suggested that, if they could 
communicate, they would reach an agreement and cooperate. This suggestion, how￾ever, is misleading. The reason why games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma are clas￾sifed as non-cooperative is not because players are prevented from using means that 
would allow them to cooperate, for example communication and negotiation. They 
are non-cooperative games because players must make individual choices based on 
their own individual preferences.5
 Suppose, for instance, that the two prisoners are 
in fact allowed to communicate and agree not to confess. Now, suppose one of the 
prisoners is questioned and holds to the agreement, refusing to confess. It is then the 
other prisoner’s turn, and suppose that they actually know that their partner did not 
confess. What is more rational for them to do then? If the payoffs are those pre￾sented in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, then if the prisoner is economically rational, they 
4On several occasions, the American philosopher Robert Brandom has warned against the instru￾mentalist approach to rationality that is pursued by rational choice theorists and adopted, for 
instance, just in Game Theory (Brandom, 2011, pp. 35–36, 71; 2002, pp. 3–4). Obviously, part of 
what is for a human being to be rational is to be able to assess whether their actions and beliefs are 
correct. But what are the criteria of correctness? One might think that it is how things are in the 
world: thus, a belief is correct if it corresponds to a fact, an action is correct if it corresponds to a 
norm, and so on. On the instrumentalist approach, instead, the correctness of a performance or a 
belief is assessed with respect to its success: for example, if I have a goal, and by acting upon a 
belief I achieve it, then the belief is correct. And yet, there are any number of reasons why the 
action could have been successful and any number of reasons why things could have gone wrong. 
The contingent success of an intentional action can be no criterion for correctness. Besides, if we 
assume that an agent should have beliefs about everything that could possibly go wrong with their 
action in order to be sure that their success is not merely contingent, then which one exactly would 
be the content of the belief whose correctness is tested against such a criterium?
5Cooperative games are games in which players might form coalitions that would allow them to 
obtain better payoffs than if they acted individually. Cooperation is enforced by binding contracts 
that guarantee transferable utilities within the members of a coalition and that make it convenient 
for players to adopt mutually benefcial strategies. Cooperative Game Theory investigates how the 
best coalitions should be formed and how utilities should be shared within the members of these 
coalitions. Crucially, however, it does not explain how cooperation emerges out of the self-interest 
of non-cooperative players and presupposes the possibility of enforcing binding agreements 
among them. (See Ichiishi, 1983, 1993; Owen, 1995; Cruriel, 1997; Ichiishi & Yamazaki, 2006; 
Gilles, 2010.)
10 Confict Dynamics183
should break the deal, confess, and go free. But then of course the frst prisoner 
could foresee this and, again, if economically rational, should choose to confess in 
the frst place.
If communication is conceived as a means of transferring information from one 
player to another to secure an agreement between them, it makes no difference to 
the puzzle of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. As we have just seen, the reason for this is 
that rational players choose their strategies only on the basis of their expected util￾ity. The distribution of the payoffs is the only thing that truly makes a difference in 
Game Theory. But if this is the case, then there is actually a role for communication 
to play in the analysis of the puzzle. Recall that the utility functions that assign 
payoffs to the possible outcomes are intended to provide a formal representation of 
the preferences of the different players. In fact, when we assign a certain payoff to 
a certain outcome for a player, we mean that the player has an instrumental belief 
that by adopting a certain strategy they will obtain a certain result that will satisfy 
their desires to a certain degree. In this sense, then, utility functions model the 
aspects of the cognitive environment of a rational agent involved in the explanation 
of their actions.
Now, when we look at the confictual situations modeled by non-cooperative 
games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma from the point of view of communication, 
it is easy to realize that these games simply do not happen, so to speak, in the 
void. To the contrary, they describe problems of rational choice that are grounded 
in the beliefs and desires that in the basic framework of Game Theory are only 
implicitly represented by the utility functions of the players. As we have seen, 
Sperber and Wilson suggest thinking of this context in terms of the cognitive 
environments of the agents. How would an account of this context change the 
results of game-theoretic analysis?
Reiterated Games
As a matter of fact, cognitive environments are rather conservative; therefore the 
process required to modify them is not straightforward. Most of all it requires time. 
In the framework of Game Theory, time has been investigated with relation to iter￾ated games, that is, games that can be repeated by players several times. To illustrate 
the impact communication may have on the process of modifcation of the utility 
functions of the players of noncooperative games, let us consider another example 
of a confictual situation with the structure of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In this situa￾tion, several frms compete in a free market in which prices are governed by the law 
of supply and demand. The strategy that will collectively maximize the utilities for 
all the frms is to reduce the supply to keep prices high. If the frms will choose to 
cooperate and form a “cartel”, they will stick to a certain agreed quota of produc￾tion; yet, obviously, if that were the strategy of the other players, every single frm 
would maximize its utilities by increasing their production and beneft from the 
high prices, while the others’ strategy in turn would suffer from the fall in demand.

In jargon, such a player is called a “free rider”. In its original use, the expression 
refers to those who take a ride on public transportation without paying a ticket. In 
economics, a free rider is an individual who benefts from some collective good but 
refuses to contribute to its maintenance. The problem of free riders was famously 
pointed out by the ecologist Garrett Hardin with relation to the phenomenon he 
called “the tragedy of the commons” (Hardin, 1968). Hardin’s reasoning has been 
used to argue for the privatization of public resources. He illustrated the concept 
with the example of common pastures. Where common pastures are available, every 
single herdsman has two possible courses of actions: either keeping the cattle on 
common pastures or keeping them on private ones. If a herdsman keeps his cattle on 
common pastures, they grow bigger and faster than if he just let them pasture on his 
private felds; thus, keeping as many cattle as possible on the commons is in the 
herdsman’s best individual interest. Unfortunately, if there are too many cattle on 
the common pastures, these will soon be ruined, and they will no longer be usable 
by anyone. What should the herdsman do? If he is the only one not to exploit the 
commons, he will lose his profts and the commons will be ruined regardless. He 
will therefore keep his cattle on the common pastures, and all the other herdsmen 
will act in kind, if they are allowed to, until the commons is ruined for everyone.
Similarly, if we model the cartel situation in Game Theory, the economically 
rational solution proves to be for every frm to increase their production, regardless 
of the others’ actions and engage in a price war until their proft margin is zero. Just 
like in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, this sounds paradoxical. Figure 10.8 represents this 
confictual situation as a non-cooperative game for two players.
But, now, consider what happens in common real-life situations when players 
have to play this game multiple times. Every time they play, the frms need to decide 
whether to cooperate and respect their agreed-upon production quota or defect and 
increase production. In this scenario, players might also determine their preferences 
by taking into account their knowledge about previous interactions and their expec￾tations with respect to future interactions. Thus, in this situation, suppose that the 
frst time the game is played, one of the frms decides to break the cartel and increase 
production. If there is only one non-cooperative player, this choice will provide 
them with high payoffs on that round; however, the next time the game is played, the 
other frms will likely react against the defector by adopting the noncooperative

strategy that consists in raising their production as well. By doing so, they will cause 
a fall in prices that will lower the profts of any frm on the market. If the frms 
maintain the price war by repeatedly playing the noncooperative strategy, they will 
also eventually erase the advantage originally gained by the defector.
Obviously, the repetition of the games does not engender the convenience of the 
cooperative behavior by itself. To the contrary, rational players adopt cooperative 
strategies only insofar as they can maximize their utilities by doing so. In order to 
see this, simply consider what happens if players know exactly how many times 
they will have to interact. Experiments have shown that in repeated, noncooperative 
games, the number of cooperative choices decreases to minimum by the end of the 
game (Andreoni, 1988). The closer the last interaction, the less convenient coopera￾tion will be, because the consequences of retaliation will be less severe: this is the 
so-called end-game effect. The graduality of the results of the empirical experi￾ments simply depends on the fact that players do not always make perfectly rational 
decisions. But in fact, if we look at the problem from a mathematical point of view, 
the impact of the end-game effect is even more dramatic. Suppose that perfectly 
rational players know that they will play exactly 20 rounds of the Prisoner’s 
Dilemma: How does that affect their strategies? Let us reason backward from the 
very last interaction. In the 20th round, players know (a) that they cannot change the 
score they have obtained in previous rounds and (b) that they will not have to make 
any other decision that can be infuenced by what they choose in this round since 
there will no longer be any interactions. Therefore, in the 20th round, they will try 
to maximize their utility by choosing the Nash Equilibrium and they will defect. 
Now, let us go backward to the 19th round. In their penultimate interaction, the 
players again know (a) that they cannot change the score that they have obtained in 
the previous rounds and (b) that they will not have to make any other decision that 
can be infuenced by what they choose in this round, because they already know 
what they will play on the last round. Therefore, in the 19th round they will try to 
maximize their utility by choosing the Nash Equilibrium and they will defect. What 
about the 18th round? In this round too, obviously, players will know (a) and (b); 
therefore, they will stick to the Nash Equilibrium. It is easy to realize that the situa￾tion does not change up to the frst round. In the frst round, rational players will 
foresee what they will do in the subsequent rounds; hence, in light of (a) and (b) 
again they will choose to defect.
20th round. ⟨Defect, Defect⟩

This very simple reasoning demonstrates that if players know how many times 
they will have to play, it can be established in the framework of Game Theory that 
they should never cooperate; indeed, a dismaying result. Let us see if there is any 
chance to do better.
What is the best strategy to adopt in iterated noncooperative games such as the 
Prisoner’s Dilemma? There is a certain, general consensus that this question can be

satisfactorily answered in a unique way (see, e.g., Jurišić et al., 2012; see, however, 
Rapoport et  al., 2015 for criticism). The evidence upon which this consensus is 
based was originally provided through the experiments conducted in the early 1980s 
by Robert Axelrod (1980a, 1980b). These experiments consisted in a single stage 
round-robin tournament among computer programs, each of which simulated a dif￾ferent strategy for playing the Prisoner’s Dilemma. The payoff matrix of the game 
awarded both players 3 points for mutual cooperation, and 1 point for mutual defec￾tion. If one player defected while the other player cooperated, the defecting player 
received 5 points and the cooperating player received 0 points (Fig. 10.9).6
In the frst tournament, each program played against every other participant 200 
times. Computer programs were developed by 14 experts in Game Theory who had 
previously studied the Prisoner’s Dilemma at length. In the second tournament, the 
number of the game’s repetitions for each pair of programs was determined proba￾bilistically to avoid the end-game effect. This time, 62 candidate programs were 
submitted, and their developers were aware of the results of the frst experiment. In 
both experiments, the strategy scoring more points was the one originally proposed 
by Anatol Rapoport, who nicknamed it “TIT-FOR-TAT” because it essentially con￾sists in mimicking the tactics of the opponent (Rapoport & Chammah, 1965). This 
strategy is fairly simple:
(a) If it is the frst round, cooperate.
(b) Otherwise, do what the opponent did in the previous round.
It is also easy to comprehend why TIT-FOR-TAT is effective in round-robin tourna￾ments. First, it is clear, meaning it is easily recognizable by the other strategies and 
its behavior is predictable and reliable, due to the fact that it only considers the 
6The precise determination of the payoff matrix is obviously crucial for the results of the experi￾ments. Had the ratio between the payoff for cooperation and defection been different, different 
strategies would have been more successful or less successful. The effects of a different payoff 
matrix would have been particularly relevant for the results of the evolutionary games (see the next 
section). This should not surprise us, however. To the contrary, it should confrm the intuition that 
the possibility of modifying the payoffs is what really determines the outcomes of a confict in 
Game Theory.

previous round of the game and regularly acts according to it. This makes it a good 
partner to identify and cooperate with.
Second, it is retaliatory: if the opponent defects, it punishes them by defecting in 
the subsequent round. This minimizes the losses against uncooperative players: 
every time the opponent stops cooperating, the player obtains the worst payoff one 
time only. Besides, it discourages defections (Fig. 10.10).
Third, it is forgiving: if the opponent begins to cooperate once again, the player 
cooperates back. This favors cooperation with faithful opponents (Fig. 10.11).
Fourth, it is nice, meaning it looks for cooperation the frst time and never tries 
to fool the opponent.
This ensures good payoffs with other cooperative opponents (as, e.g., other TIT￾FOR-TATs) (Fig. 10.12).
TIT-FOR-TAT gains a lot of points. In fact, in a population where every player 
adopts TIT-FOR-TAT, the most rational thing to do is to adopt it as well: ⟨TIT-FOR￾TAT, TIT-FOR-TAT⟩ is a Nash Equilibrium for Axelrod’s iterated Prisoner’s 
Dilemma game.
It is possible to demonstrate, however, that there is nothing particularly special 
about TIT-FOR-TAT, and that its success is simply an instance of a far more general 
phenomenon. To see why this is the case, it is important to keep in mind what the 
conditions are under which the success of TIT-FOR-TAT is obtained. Specifcally, 
recall that to avoid end-game effects, players must know that at every round there 
will always be a certain probability of future interactions.7
 Besides, the application 
of TIT-FOR-TAT presupposes that the player always has enough information about 
7 In Game Theory, the expectation of future interactions on the players’ part is represented in terms 
of a discount factor that applies to the payoffs of subsequent rounds of the game. For instance, if 
the discount factor δ is 0.5 and the payoff of a certain outcome for a certain player is 4 in a certain 
round, then the payoff of that outcome for that player in the next round should be 4 × 0.5 = 2. The 
idea is that the payoffs for future outcomes should be progressively diminished (the progression 
here is the progression of a geometrical series: e.g., 4 × δ + 4 × δ2
 + 4 × δ3
 ...) since they are less 
likely to be obtained. For instance, if the discount factor is 0, that means that player are sure that 
they will not get any payoff for future games. On the contrary, if the discount factor is 1, they are 
sure that they will play any future round and get their payoffs.
Reiterated Games188
the game to tell whether the opponent has cooperated or defected in the previous 
round.8
 Now, it can be proven that under these conditions equilibria arise that are not 
the Nash Equilibria of a single round of the game and that provide the players with 
a greater utility. There is an entire series of results of this kind that are known as Folk 
Theorems, because they are part of the folklore of Game Theory, in the sense that 
they were widely known by game theorists even before they were formally stated 
and proven.9
 As far as our purposes are concerned, Folk Theorems in particular 
establish that if players have a large enough time horizon, there are always solutions 
to an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma in which both players obtain payoffs that exceed 
those of the Nash Equilibrium for the game’s single round, especially. In particular, 
if the utility gained by deviating from cooperation is not too high, there may be 
optimal and fair solutions. The mathematics behind Folk Theorems is not extremely 
diffcult to understand, but it is still too complicated for this presentation. The basic 
idea they confrm, however, is fairly intuitive: if players have a reasonable expecta￾tion that they will have to interact again in the future, they might fnd it convenient 
to cooperate rather than trying to fool one another. It is also intuitively clear that the 
Folk Theorems only apply to ideal situations, whereas in real-life conficts, the con￾ditions that they require are seldom satisfed; nonetheless, they are relevant to our 
investigation, because they establish that in principle cooperative behavior could be 
a solution to a confict.
The Evolutionary Perspective on Reiterated Games
Are nice strategies such as TIT-FOR-TAT the way out of the Prisoner’s Dilemma? 
Do Axelrod’s experiments show that cooperation can be the most economically 
rational behavior, at least in the long run? Notice, to begin with, that TIT-FOR-TAT 
does not guarantee that players will cooperate: TIT-FOR-TAT copies the opponent; 
therefore, it will cooperate if the opponent cooperates and will defect if the oppo￾nent defects. In effect, the Folk Theorems do not guarantee that in infnitely repeated 
games players will converge on optimal and fair equilibria; they only establish that 
in those games there are other more effcient equilibria. In a way, the Folk Theorems 
only show that if players expect to interact again in the future for a long enough 
time, a Prisoner’s Dilemma game can be transformed in a Stag Hunt game. There 
are several ways in which this transformation can be construed. The difference 
between them depends on how the context in which the game is played is construed.
By examining the results of his frst experiments, Axelrod noticed that the suc￾cess of certain nice strategies such as TIT-FOR-TAT in the tournaments was rele￾vantly boosted by the large number of points that they scored against certain specifc 
8Notice that this is a exceedingly strict condition rarely satisfed in real confictual situations, 
where the parties have to give interpretations of each other’s strategies.
9See, for instance, Rubinstein (1979) and Fudenberg & Maskin (1986). Myerson also infuentially 
proposed calling these results General Feasibility Theorems in Myerson (1991, pp. 331–337).
10 Confict Dynamics189
strategies. These latter did not perform very well in the tournaments, but they deter￾mined the success of other strategies. Axelrod used the expression “kingmaker” to 
refer to the strategies that played this subsidiary role in the tournament. But what if 
there are no kingmakers among the opponents? Axelrod raised this worry explicitly: 
“[D]oes TIT FOR TAT do well in a wide variety of environments? That is to say, is 
it robust?” (Axelrod, 1984, p. 48).
In order to test the robustness of TIT-FOR-TAT, he considered the repetition of 
games in an evolutionary perspective (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). He therefore 
organized a tournament where the different strategies played the Prisoner’s Dilemma 
against each other in several subsequent stages. The number of programs that played 
a certain strategy in the next stage was determined in function of the number of 
points that such a strategy had obtained in the previous stage. This was supposed to 
represent the fact that the strategies that score less points would be abandoned in 
favor of more successful ones by “future generations” of players. The idea was to 
test the success of the strategies in adapting to different environments. The results 
of the experiment showed that the less successful strategies become increasingly 
less common and eventually drop out, while the more successful ones proliferate. 
Again, the prevailing strategy in this evolutionary experiment was TIT-FOR-TAT. In 
Axelrod’s view, this result demonstrated that in effect the success of TIT-FOR-TAT 
does not depend on the context in which it is put into play.
This presentation, however, is not completely accurate. Surely, Axelrod’s evolu￾tionary experiment showed that TIT-FOR-TAT is robust enough to succeed in an 
environment without any of its kingmakers, but it does not show that TIT-FOR-TAT 
can succeed in any environment whatsoever. Notice, in fact, that since TIT-FOR￾TAT always copies the opponent, it can never win by obtaining more points in a 
series of interactions: it can either lose or tie. For instance, if it is put into play in an 
environment where there are only strategies against which it cannot tie, eventually 
it will not gain enough points to reproduce itself in the next generation. Now, one of 
the strategies that are particularly effective against TIT-FOR-TAT is one that always 
defects: such a strategy would fool TIT-FOR-TAT in the frst round and then force 
the Nash Equilibrium of any single round of the Prisoner’s Dilemma until the end of 
the series of interactions. Besides, defectors would score better against each other 
than TIT-FOR-TAT does. Consequently, TIT-FOR-TAT would be unable to invade
an environment in which all players do nothing other than defect (Fig. 10.13).
As a matter of fact, TIT-FOR-TAT only fares well together with other nice strate￾gies. In fact, if an environment contains enough nice strategies, these will proliferate 
because they will be able to play enough times against one another, and the payoffs 
of the Prisoner’s Dilemma reward cooperation over defection. Once TIT-FOR-TAT 
has occupied an environment, it is considerably diffcult for defectors to invade it,

because TIT-FOR-TAT is retaliating: the defectors would therefore score less points 
when they play against TIT-FOR-TATs or against themselves than the points that 
TIT-FOR-TATs score when they play against themselves.
There are two crucial things to notice about the evolutionary perspective on reit￾erated games. The frst one is that actors who must choose a strategy in every round 
of every stage of the game are not really the players anymore: the actual players are 
the strategies themselves which strive for evolutionary success. These players do 
not strive for the maximization of their utilities in a single round of the game. The 
utility of these players is the expected number of offspring in the next stage of the 
game. Clearly, the dynamics with which strategies replicate themselves might vary, 
but if they depend on the point they score in subsequent rounds of the Prisoner’s 
Dilemma, then there is at least something that we already know from Axelrod’s 
experiments: in iterated stages of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, strategies fare well when 
they cooperate with cooperators and defect with defectors, but they will score more 
points in the frst case. This means that, in the long run, a strategy will have more 
chances of reproducing itself (i.e., obtain more utility) from cooperation than from 
defection if the environment is favorable to cooperation. In fact, the Folk Theorems 
guarantee that mutual cooperation might be another Nash Equilibrium.
In order to see the point more clearly, consider a simple scenario. It is an evolu￾tionary tournament such as the one described above, in which strategies play the 
Prisoner’s Dilemma with the payoff matrix represented in Fig. 10.9. There are only 
two sorts of strategies: COOPERATOR and DEFECTOR, whose behavior can eas￾ily be inferred from their names: the former always cooperates and the latter always 
defects. They play only two stages with only one round. After each stage, the next 
generation of strategies will have as many individuals as the points scored by the 
previous generation (just ignore the complication of pairing in an odd number of 
players for the sake of argument). Combinatorically, it is easy to see that there are 
three possible environments:
1. DEFECTOR vs. DEFECTOR. In the frst round, each defector plays against a 
defector and therefore scores 1 point. In the second round, there are two defec￾tors. They play against each other, and again each of them scores 1 point. At the 
end of the game, each DEFECTOR has 1 heir (Fig. 10.14).
2. DEFECTOR vs. COOPERATOR. In the frst round, a defector plays against a 
cooperator: the frst scores 5 points and the latter 0. In the second round, there 
are fve defectors. They play against each other, and each of them scores 1 point. 
At the end of the game, DEFECTOR has 5 heirs and COOPERATOR has 0 heirs 
(Fig. 10.15).

against a cooperator: they both score 3 points. In the second round, there are six 
cooperators. They play against each other, and each of them scores 3 points. At 
the end of the game, each COOPERATOR has 9 heirs (Fig. 10.16).
But then, if the players of this game are strategies which aim to reproduce them￾selves, their utilities are to be measured in terms of their offspring. Thus, the actual 
payoff matrix for this game is better represented in Fig. 10.17. As is easy to demon￾strate, this game has two Nash Equilibria: ⟨Cooperate, Cooperate⟩ and ⟨Defect, 
Defect⟩. In fact, this game is no longer a Prisoner’s Dilemma: it is a Stag Hunt 
game. In this sense, the evolutionary perspective illustrates the result that the Folk 
Theorems establish.
The second important thing to notice about the evolutionary perspective on reit￾erated games, however, is that it fails to provide an answer about how to progress 
from the least to the most effcient equilibrium. As we have seen, in fact, it only tells 
us that the progression depends on the population of players. If the environment 
contains enough cooperative players, generation after generation, they can substi￾tute the defectors and resist further invasions on their part. It is possible to establish 
exactly how many cooperators are required to invade a population of defectors 
based on the dynamics of replication of the players (which of course involve the 
payoff of the game for the single rounds), but it is not possible to intervene on the 
process once the population is given.
Is the population really given anyway? Brian Skyrms (2004) famously proposed 
that the dynamics of group formation should be considered in order to explain the

matrix
evolution of cooperation. Rather than being given, he argues, populations are them￾selves determined by the interaction of agents; in fact, agents select their peers 
according to the feedback they obtain in terms of the success of their actions when 
they interact. Cooperators team with cooperators and keep out defectors and free 
riders. Skyrms’ analysis of the feedback-governed processes of social grouping 
offers interesting prospects for the evolutionary explanation of social structures. 
Still, these processes are beyond the intervention of rational agents, and the dynam￾ics of many occurrent confictual situations are not in actual fact suitable for being 
represented in terms of them: not every confict transformation depends on a change 
in the population of the parties.
What is the alternative? An interesting suggestion comes from the interpretation 
that Michael Tomasello (2009) gave of Skyrms’ work. Tomasello distinguishes 
between two ways of engaging in cooperative activities: the “I-mode”, in which one 
exclusively search for one’s own self-interest, and the “we-mode”, characterized 
instead by joint intentionality. While apes are only able to cooperate in “I-mode”, 
humans are mostly engaged in “we-mode” group activities. According to Tomasello, 
Skyrms shows how human cooperation can be properly characterized as a Stag Hunt 
game rather than that of a Prisoner’s Dilemma. Tomasello’s question, then, is how 
do humans come to be able to do that? His answer involves a story about how 
humans developed skills to engage in activities in communicational, social, and 
normative contexts. The possibility for this cultural evolutionary process is grounded 
in characteristically human metarepresentational abilities, the very same abilities 
that, as seen in Chap. 1, Tomasello believes enable humans to communicate: “[s]kills 
and motivations for cooperative communication co-evolved with these cooperative 
activities because such communication both depended on these activities and con￾tributed to them by facilitating the coordination needed to co-construct a joint goal 
and differentiated roles” (ibid., p. 74).
10 Confict Dynamics193
Conclusions
In this chapter, the game-theoretic approach to the analysis of confictual situations 
has been introduced and discussed in order to model the dynamics of the interaction 
between the strategic choices of parties. These choices depend on the practical rea￾soning of rational agents who act upon their beliefs and desires to achieve their 
goals. In Game Theory, the cognitive environment of the agents that motivates their 
actions is represented in terms of the payoff values assigned to the possible out￾comes of the confict, and the agents’ goals are represented as the maximization of 
their utilities. Game Theory also shows that in the long run cooperation is the most 
effcacious style to adopt in coping with a confictual situation. It also shows, how￾ever, that cooperation is not always the most convenient one, because it does not 
always guarantee the maximization of the utilities of the agents.
Our purpose here was not to solve the problem of cooperation in social systems; 
therefore, we did not discuss any amelioration of game-theoretic analysis. We 
noticed, however, that communication plays no role in the standard framework of 
Game Theory. The absence of communication from this picture is remarkable, given 
that the determination of the best strategies to maximize the utilities of the agents 
depends primarily on the utility functions themselves, which implicitly represent 
the agents’ cognitive environment. In effect, on the one hand, the dynamics that 
determine the cognitive environment of the agents is not really an object of investi￾gation in the theory, because the defnition of the players’ utility functions is a pre￾requisite for the game-theoretic analysis. On the other hand, it seems that on iterated 
games the only way in which the strategies of rational players could converge on the 
more risky solutions that emerge as equilibria in the long run is by backing them up 
with the appropriate common knowledge (Skyrms, 2004, p.  51): player A must 
know that player B is cooperating, player B must know that player A is cooperating, 
player A must know that player B knows that player A is cooperating, and so on. But 
as we have seen, common knowledge is not attainable through communication if 
communication is conceived in terms of the code model as the transmission of 
information. In these terms, communication has no role to play in Game Theory. 
This is why Skyrms proposes looking elsewhere to explain the evolution of coop￾erative behavior, namely to the game-theoretic analysis of group formations.10
The analysis of repeated games, however, establishes that the modifcation of the 
players’ cognitive environment may eventually result in a corresponding modifca￾tion of their utility functions that might in turn modify their strategies. We have 
learned from Sperber and Wilson that communication is not as much about transfer￾ring information as it is about enlarging mutual cognitive environments; hence, even 
if the game-theoretic analysis of conficts does not assign any role to communica￾tion, it still clearly indicates what this role should be and what could be achieved by 
means of it. Communication might contribute to the emergence of more effcient

Conclusions194
solutions to confictual situations and drive parties toward them, thus fostering 
cooperation. Cooperative strategies are often more effcient, in the sense that they 
realize equilibria that allow parties to obtain the highest payoffs for themselves and
for other parties. In Rousseau’s sense, cooperative strategies allow parties to pursue 
their general will. As Rousseau himself made clear, however, it is crucial to realize 
that such a general will is not simply given in function of the individual beliefs and 
desires of the parties; rather, it must be constructed through communication 
processes.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we used the technical framework of Game Theory to model confict 
as strategic games in which the outcomes of the parties’ decisions depend on one 
another. In this framework, a game is formalized as a list of players with a list of 
actions available to them and their payoffs in all the possible outcomes. Players are 
assumed to be “economically” rational and only try to maximize their payoffs. A 
game’s solution can be defned as a Nash Equilibrium in which no player can 
improve their payoff by changing their choice given the choices of all the other 
players.
The game-theoretic approach immediately highlights a problem with confict 
management: games such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma seem to show that a confict 
might not have cooperative solutions, even if parties would obtain higher payoffs by 
cooperating. We saw, however, that this conclusion is too hasty, especially because 
the basic formulations of the Prisoner’s Dilemma miss some crucial aspects of real￾life situations. One of these is the fact that usually parties in a confict must decide 
whether to cooperate multiple times. The dynamics of iterated noncooperative 
games was statistically studied by Robert Axelrod having different strategies, simu￾lated by computer programs, competing against one another in round-robin tourna￾ments. In order to avoid end-of game effects, the number of game iterations was 
determined probabilistically. The winning strategy was the so-called TIT-FOR￾TAT. Originally proposed by Anatol Rapoport, this strategy is very simple: it coop￾erates in the frst round and then does what the opponent did in the previous round. 
The success of TIT-FOR-TAT depends on the fact that it gains high payoffs against 
other cooperative strategies while not loosing much against noncooperative ones. 
The outcome of a reiterated Prisoner’s Dilemma in which all parties adopt TIT￾FOR-TAT is a cooperative Nash Equilibrium. This and other similar results known 
in the literature as “Folk Theorems” guarantee that cooperation is not necessarily 
considered irrational in Game Theory when players have a large enough time hori￾zon. Axelrod also demonstrated that TIT-FOR-TAT is robust, meaning that it can do 
well even in environments where there are only a few other cooperative players to 
compete with. He tested the success of TIT-FOR-TAT in evolutionary games in 
which the number of parties playing a certain strategy at a certain round depend on 
the points scored by that strategy in the previous round.
10 Confict Dynamics195
The evolutionary perspective on reiterated games proves that a strategy has more 
chances of reproducing itself by cooperating, if there are enough cooperative play￾ers in its environment. In light of this, Brian Skyrms suggested that the feasibility of 
cooperative solutions depends in fact on the relative distribution of cooperative 
players in a population. There seems to be another possibility, however; given that 
the payoffs only represent the attitudes of the players toward certain outcomes, it 
seems that the structure of a game could be modifed by communication.

Chapter 11
Confict Transformation
Game Theory provides a model to study the interactions between rational agents. 
The actions of a rational agent can be interpreted and explained on the basis of their 
beliefs, desires, and, in general, of the mental representations that constitute their 
cognitive environment. In the game-theoretic framework, these cognitive environ￾ments are implicitly represented in terms of an agent’s utility function in the context 
of a confictual situation in which different outcomes are determined by the interac￾tion of their strategies with the strategies of other parties. The mutual cognitive 
environments of parties can be modifed by communication in order to foster the 
cooperative strategies which are demonstrably more convenient to parties in the 
long run; however, while Game Theory suggests what the role of communication 
could be in confict management, in reality it cannot provide accurate descriptions 
of actual confict dynamics, if only because actual agents simply do not always act 
on the basis of their self-interest, for better or for worse. In this chapter, the role of 
communication in confict transformation is further explored.
Resolution vs. Transformation
Before proceeding, the use of the expression “transformation” requires some seman￾tic clarifcation. In the feld of confict studies, a distinction is often drawn between 
processes of confict resolution and processes of confict transformation. The for￾mer lead to some form of settlement between the parties that is supposed to resolve 
the issues that give rise to the confict. The settlement, usually a compromise 
achieved through negotiation, mediation, or even arbitration, should put an end to 
the confict. Authors such as John Paul Lederach and Johan Galtung, however, have 
taken exception to the very idea that conficts have clearly identifable beginnings 
and ends (see, e.g., Lederach, 1997; Galtung, 1995). Galtung, for instance, writes:
[Conficts are] phenomena that have no clear beginning or end [...] they wax, wane and 
transform themselves through patterns of dependent co-arising. [...] [C]onficts are gener￾ally not solved [...] What survives after a confict has disappeared from the agenda is con￾fict energy reproduced and produced by the confict. Then energy does not die [...] it 
attaches itself to one or more conficts, possibly also the old one. (Ibid., pp. 52–53)

The main difference between the resolution and the transformation approaches is 
that the latter deals with conficts even after their solution, that is, after the parties 
have reached an agreement on specifc issues and violence has ceased (Mitchell, 
2002). Under this approach, in fact, conficts are conceived as processes subject to 
change and modifcation. From this point of view, it makes sense to ask whether 
different conficts with different parties and different issues, possibly even distant in 
space or time, are manifestations of the same confictual formation originating 
from the same incompatibilities. This sort of perspective is certainly important for 
the analysis of historical processes. Consider, for example, the question that the 
historian Eric Hobsbawn poses in his famous essay The Age of Extreme (Hobsbawn, 
1994): When did the events that mainly characterized the twentieth century begin 
and end? According to Hobsbawn, the “short century” began with World War I in 
1914 and ended with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. But when did the conficts 
that continued as a result of those events end? As a matter of fact, it is neither dif￾fcult nor controversial to trace the current tensions in the Middle East back to the 
geopolitical order established on the territories of the former Ottoman Empire by 
the leaders of the winning nations during the treatises that put an end to World War 
I. The transformation approach, however, is even more signifcant for confict stud￾ies because it reorients the analysis of the problem of confict management from the 
search for a solution to the issues of the confict, to the investigation of the changes 
that occur in the confictual formation and that infuence its development.
The problem with the transformational approach then is to draw a clear distinc￾tion between the modifcations that characterize the regular dynamics of a confic￾tual process and the deeper changes that transform it. The former concern the 
interactions between parties, the manifest sequences of actions and reactions parties 
conduct to pursue their goals. These sorts of modifcations are determined by the 
behavior and attitudes of parties, by their organization and by the structure of the 
system in which they interact. The latter, instead, affect the very components and 
environment of a confictual formation: the organization of actors and their atti￾tudes, the issues of the confict and the way in which they are construed by parties, 
and the very structure of their relations.
To give an example, one of the most important shifts that may occur in a confic￾tual situation is carried out by the empowerment of parties. This is the process by 
which people or groups move from powerlessness to autonomy (Bush & Folger, 
1994). The process of empowerment does not consist as much in the acquisition of 
the material resources for action as in learning the ways to think and act as a self￾conscious actor. As a result of the process of empowerment, parties develop their 
possibilities not only for action but also crucially for self-determination and recipro￾cal recognition. Although it might sound counterintuitive, parties should promote 
the empowerment of their adversaries if they wish for a positive transformation of 
the confict; in fact, an empowered adversary will be confdent in its identity and 
capabilities; therefore, it will be less afraid to recognize the perspectives, the needs, 
and the goals of others. It will not fear of losing its status or possibility of acting 
regardless of what might happen; hence, it will be more likely to explore new paths 
and new scenarios that could lead to cooperative solutions to the confict’s issues.
11 Confict Transformation199
The debate between the resolution and the transformation approaches is, to a 
certain extent, a merely semantic one, but it contains an important insight: the notion 
of the solution of a confict is a delicate one. Settlements among the parties on spe￾cifc issues do not resolve a confict if they do not unravel the incompatibilities that 
generate the confictual situation itself. If no change is produced in the confictual 
formation, the confict will most likely emerge again in the future: new issues will 
arise, new parties will engage, and new antagonizing behavior will be practiced. A 
resolution can be found for a confictual situation, if any, only by promoting positive 
transformations in the processes that govern the course of the confict. In this sense, 
we will talk about the resolution of a confict as a process of positive transformation 
of the structure that generates the confictual formation. By “positive transforma￾tion”, we mean a modifcation that yields the confict’s de-escalation.
Escalation and De-escalation
Escalation is the process by which a confict becomes more severe. At frst glance, 
the dynamics of escalation seem easy to understand. When two or more parties are 
engaged in a confict, they act against one another in certain ways that characterize 
a certain level of the confict’s severity. If one of the parties undertakes more severe 
actions, then other parties might reciprocate. Thus, the process of escalation can be 
pictured as a ladder (Fig. 11.1). Each rung corresponds to a level of the confict’s 
severity. The confict escalates when the parties undertake more severe actions, and 
it de-escalates when the parties undertake less severe ones.
This model, however, is too simplistic. In order to see why, let us begin by asking 
how a confict’s severity is graded. The frst notion that naturally comes to mind in 
this regard is violence. Here, violence is better construed as a characteristic that 
actions may have: a violent action is aimed to cause harm or, in general, to force￾fully determine someone to act against their will. As we have seen, adversarial 
actions come in various degrees, from harmless divergence to aggression. A confict 
is obviously as severe as it is violent.
In his analysis of class conficts, however, Dahrendorf (1957) rightly notices that 
violence cannot be the only parameter to consider in this matter. He describes the 
variability of conficts inside a space defned by two coordinates: violence and what 
he calls “intensity” (201ff.). The latter refers to the degree of involvement of parties 
in the confict: the more resources, energy, and commitment a party has invested in 
Fig. 11.1 Escalation: the ¼
ladder model
Escalation and De-escalation200
a confict, the more involved it is in the confict. Figure  11.2 represents some 
examples.
World War II was a paradigmatic, highly intense, and violent confict. Conversely, 
the Cold War, which followed it and saw the US and the countries of the Western 
Bloc opposed to the Soviet Union and the countries of the Eastern Bloc for half a 
century, was characterized by an ideological contrast that pervasively involved the 
parties on essentially every possible level of interaction. But it never really erupted 
into episodes of extreme violence because the frightful eventuality of an atomic war 
kept the escalation at bay. The fght against terrorism is sometimes qualifed as a 
low-intensity confict, because, even if it falls short of a conventional war, terrorism 
still involves military operations and violent actions in which large numbers of peo￾ple are killed. Still, it might be controversial whether or not parties involved in so￾called low-intensity conficts actually have a low degree of commitment to them.
Even though Dahrendorf’s analysis qua applied to class confict is somehow 
timeworn, nonetheless it still has several merits. First, it is very effective in high￾lighting the complexity of the problem of defning a confict’s degree of severity. On 
the one hand, violence is unfortunately a rather clear notion, even if it can some￾times be hard to recognize. The intensity of a confict, on the other hand, is not so 
easy to characterize. Dahrendorf proposes at least three parameters to measure the 
intensity of a confict.
First, he notices, a confict becomes more severe if the number of issues increases. 
The issues, as we have seen, are what the confict is about or what the parties take it 
to be about; for example, the possession of certain territories might be an issue in a 
confict between two countries. New issues might be added to the confict if parties 
become more involved in the confict. Consider our previous example again. If both 
countries consider the contended territories as defnitory of their respective exis￾tence as a nation, then the national identity of parties becomes a new issue in their 
confict. If they try to gather allies among other countries, then the international 
relations between all these other parties might become issues of the confict as well.

If the level of violence rises, then the damage and losses suffered by parties are also 
likely to become issues. The more issues the confict is about, the more it is complex 
and the higher is the parties’ commitment. Once an issue is on the table, it is not 
easily dismissed, and it must be addressed in the process of the confict’s resolution.
A second reason why the intensity of a confict might increase is because parties 
invest more resources in it. This might happen either because resources are needed 
to carry on adversarial actions or as a consequences of the damages suffered in the 
confict requiring reconstruction. The necessity to compensate the resources lost in 
the confict might obviously become an issue itself; resources might be material, 
such as money and sometimes, unfortunately, human lives, as well as immaterial, 
such as prestige and reputation. When parties put too much effort and too many 
resources into a confict, they might reach the point where they no longer see any 
way to recoup their investment except by persisting in the confict. This situation, 
usually referred to as “overcommitment”, makes it extremely diffcult for parties to 
adopt courses of actions that may lead to the de-escalation of the confict.
A third process that, according to Dahrendorf, increases the intensity of a confict 
has to do with certain modifcations that may occur in the attitudes of parties. He 
notices that parties might experience a gradual reduction of the cognitive complex￾ity of the framework in terms of which they understand the confict: they begin to 
give univocal explanations, they have a limited number of strategies at their dis￾posal, their prejudicial beliefs are reinforced, and it becomes increasingly more dif￾fcult for them to entertain and evaluate alternative views. Parties develop and 
strengthen an antagonistic image of one another that jeopardizes any chance for 
cooperation. We have already discussed this sort of cognitive phenomena engen￾dered and maintained by vicious circles such as self-fulflling prophecies: party A
has a prejudicial belief against party B, therefore A undertakes actions against B, 
thus provoking the reaction of B that reinforces A’s prejudice. Once the cognitive 
environment of parties has become rigid and impervious to new and different infor￾mation, communication exchanges themselves become adversarial: parties prefer to 
rigidify and formalize communication, use it to gain advantages of the enemies or 
simply quit it altogether.
The analysis proposed by Dahrendorf has a second crucial merit. The “ladder 
model” implies that the escalation and de-escalation are simply the two directions 
that a confict could take; moreover, it suggests that escalation can be converted into 
de-escalation straightforwardly by simply reverting the steps that led to the higher 
level of the confict’s severity. For instance, consider what happened during the 
Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. One might think that since the confict had escalated 
because the Soviet Union deployed ballistic missiles near the US borders, the con￾fict simply de-escalated once the missiles were dismantled. This is not what actu￾ally happened, however. In 1961, Soviet missiles were deployed in Cuba following 
the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. In response, the US established a naval blockade 
around the island. The tension between the two countries, however, did not wane 
because the missiles were removed. To the contrary, the Soviet Union agreed to 
withdraw the Cuban missiles as a consequence of the negotiation with the US. In 
general, real-life examples demonstrate that it is not at all easy to revert the process 
Escalation and De-escalation202
of escalation. But why is this so? Dahrendorf’ s remarks suggest an answer to this 
question: the reason is that the process of escalation is determined by modifcations 
in the deep structure of the confict formation that transform it and engender new 
dynamics. Once the transformation has occurred, it cannot be reverted except by 
introducing opposite modifcations in the confict formation.
A different model for the interpretation of the process of confict escalation that 
better complies with this insight is the spiral. Understanding escalation as a spiral￾ing process allows one to highlight the dynamics of reinforcement of the intensity 
of a confict that places the interaction between the parties on an entirely different 
level that cannot simply be descended like a ladder.
The “spiral model” (Fig. 11.3) incorporates the idea that escalation modifes the 
structure of the confict. But what are the modifcations involved in escalation? 
Some of these were already described by Dahrendorf. In particular, Christopher 
Mitchell, whose research in confict theory is particularly devoted to the investiga￾tion of the role of change in confict resolution, singles out at least fve processes 
(cf., e.g., Mitchell, 2006).
The frst one he considers is mobilization. It consists in the process of investing 
time, effort, and resources in the confict so that one’s goals can be achieved. The 
resources that a party may decide to invest in the confict are not only material; for 
instance, this process includes the emergence of an awareness of the confict and the 
development of an interpretation of it, the strengthening of one’s identity and one’s 
organization, and so on. In this sense, mobilization produces changes inside the par￾ties. It is also easy to see how the mobilization of resources could reach the point 
where the value of what parties have invested in the confict exceeds the payoff of 
the achievement of their goals and therefore generates overcommitment.
A second process that can intensify a confict is enlargement, that is, the engag￾ing of other actors in the confict. Parties may look for supporters to strengthen their 
positions as well as seek allies that can directly take part in the confict alongside 
them. It might also be the case that parties recruit other actors to fght proxy wars in 
their stead. The engagement of new actors makes the structure of the confict 
remarkably more complex, not only because their relations should be considered 
but also because each one of them carries conceptions, goals, and interests more 
diffcult to harmonize all together.
Fig. 11.3 Escalation: the ¼
spiral model
11 Confict Transformation203
The harmonization of a confict’s issues can also be problematic because of their 
polarization. When parties of a confict confront each other, they tend to adopt oppo￾site and distant positions rather than looking for middle ground settlements. This 
process reverberates on all the confict’s issues, until parties perceive their positions 
to be so distant that they hardly communicate any longer. Polarization is typical of 
political struggles, where the need to place oneself on the political spectrum to be 
clearly recognizable by the voters often forces politicians to adopt certain positions 
on certain themes precisely because the opponents have adopted the opposite ones.
Another process often associated with polarization is dissociation, which consists 
in the reduction of contact between a confict’s parties; dissociation takes parties 
materially apart. When interaction is still present, it becomes ritual and limited to 
formal contexts, where parties can easily avoid putting any real effort into confront￾ing with one another in order to change their positions. Clearly, communication is the 
sort of interaction that is mostly impoverished in this process; in fact, as already 
noticed, once the adversaries are so polarized that their mutual cognitive environment 
is minimal and cannot be extended, communication itself is perceived as pointless.
The last of the processes that Mitchell recalls in this regard is entrapment. This 
happens when parties no longer consider engagement in a confict to be a proftable 
course of action, and yet, they are also unable to see a way to withdraw from it. This 
might be because parties have invested such a considerable number of resources in 
a confict that victory is conceived as the only way to indemnify what they have 
already lost; in fact, entrapment can be a consequence of overcommitment. But it 
might also be the case that parties refuse to entertain the possibility of changing 
their strategies because that might be considered an acknowledgment of their mis￾takes, and they fear the loss of prestige or social status. Entrapment is a process that 
mostly concerns the attitudes of parties and their conceptions about what their pay￾offs could be in possible outcomes of a confict.
All the processes Mitchell deals with affect the deep structure of a confict for￾mation. They must be distinguished from the modifcations which a confict is sub￾ject to as a part of its regular dynamics. In this sense, the “spiral model” is misleading, 
because it implies that escalation is a continuous process that should be managed. 
Friedrich Glasl (1982, 1997) convincingly argued that this is not the case. He notices 
that during each stage of a confict, parties experience specifc thresholds deter￾mined by the qualities that characterize the intensity of the stage. When one of the 
parties crosses a threshold, the whole confict transforms so that new qualities are 
perceived and new thresholds are set. Glasl famously proposed modeling the escala￾tion process as the fow of a river contained by dikes. The fux of the river represents 
the intensity of the confict and the dikes represent the thresholds. When the water 
overfows the dikes or breaks them, the confict spreads over new territories, that is, 
higher levels of intensity. In his model, Glasl singles out nine stages of the escala￾tion process which can be grouped into three main phases (Fig. 11.4).
The three main phases correspond to three different sorts of games in which the 
utility functions of the players allow, respectively, for the following: win/win solu￾tions, in which all parties can achieve their goals; win/lose solutions only, in which 
Escalation and De-escalation204

III
lose/lose
Fig. 11.4 Escalation: the river model
what the one party gains is lost by the others; and lose/lose solutions only, in which 
all parties obtain low payoffs.
In the frst phase, parties are aware of themselves and of the confict, even if it is 
latent. They are actively engaged in fnding an effcient and shared solution; there￾fore, in this phase the main style of coping with the confict is cooperation, and the 
focus of parties is on the very issues of the confict. The frst stage of this phase, 
however, is tension. As Glasl notices, in fact, cooperation has its price: parties must 
struggle and accept to make sacrifces to keep it going. In this frst stage, parties 
confront with one another and discover that they have different interests and possi￾bly incompatible goals. The purpose of the confrontation is still to harmonize the 
different perspectives, but different strategies are pursued and different conceptions 
are contrasted. The second stage is thus polarization. The distance between the par￾ties’ opposing positions, which emerged in the frst stage, widens. Parties now con￾ceive their own conceptions as right and superior to the others. They still cooperate 
in fnding a shared solution, but they also begin to compete to assert their own point 
of view. Since the objective is now to prevail in the debate, communication is no 
longer directed toward the analysis of the issues, and, as prescribed by the teaching 
of the ancient Sophists, rhetorical expedients are deployed in order to win the dis￾cussions. The third and last stage of the frst phase is labeled by Glasl “deeds not 
words”; in fact, at this stage of the confict parties move from words to action. As a 
consequence of polarization, the positions are now so distant from one another that 
parties think it is no longer worth trying to change them by simply supporting their 
reasons in a debate; thus, they follow up their words with actions that might prove 
them right. This choice has several important consequences for the dynamics of the 
confict. Among these is the fact that action requires internal organization and coor￾dination so that parties need to become more cohesive and committed; besides, the 
interpretation of actions is more complex and the cognitive distance between parties 
becomes more serious.
In the second phase, the confict becomes a zero-sum game since parties no lon￾ger envisage the possibility of a shared solution. Cooperation is now extremely 
problematic because it is the very relation between parties that generates the con￾fict. In this phase, parties develop hostile attitudes toward one another. Prejudice 
11 Confict Transformation205
and distrust govern their interactions and get confrmed through vicious circles such 
as self-fulflling prophecies.
In the fourth stage of the confict, coalitions are formed. Parties try to gather sup￾porters and allies to win the confict. Coalitions are formed around main ideas that 
underline their affnities and identify one group against the others. In the character￾istic in-group/out-group dynamics, negative conceptions of adversaries are nurtured 
in opposition to the positive characterization of the members of one’s own group. 
These artifcial images of oneself and the enemies acquire a crucial role in the 
framework with which parties interpret the confict.
The ffth stage is characterized by the loss of face. One’s “face” is the social 
credit associated with one’s role or status.1
 Losing one’s face is a sort of social ostra￾cism, in consequence of which one is deprived of the credit and the esteem of the 
other members of society. The moral polarization between the conceptions of the 
self and of the enemy that have been established in the previous stage now calls into 
question the social coexistence of the parties. The confict is now a confict about 
values, and the actions of parties aim to discredit the adversaries and make them 
lose their face. Two of the parties’ fundamental needs are under attack: the need for 
esteem and the need for belongingness.
The sixth stage is threat. Now, parties systematically use threat to change the 
positions of adversaries. A threat is a commitment to act (e.g., to punish) if certain 
requests are not complied with. The most severe form of threat is the ultimatum, in 
which time itself is a condition for the satisfaction of the requests. A threat is an 
aggression to the autonomy of the adversary and determines an increase in violence; 
in fact, a threat is credible only insofar as the threatener is in effect able to act if the 
requests are not satisfed. To make a credible threat, then, a party must display its 
ability to follow through with it; thus, it usually performs a demonstrative action. As 
a reaction, the party that is fearful of being threatened might decide to undertake a 
preventive measure. In other words, it could try to preempt the threat; for instance, 
it could immediately break any channel of communication because a threat is inef￾fectual if it cannot be made, or it could intentionally weaken itself so as to be inca￾pable of complying with the requests of the eventual threat. But the party could also 
try to harm the opponent beforehand, to diminish its ability to follow through with 
the threat. In this way, it crosses the threshold of this second phase.
Violence is the main characteristic of the third phase in Glasl’s model of confict 
escalation. Parties believe that there is no longer a positive way out of the confict; 
therefore, they do not focus as much on their gains as on the others’ losses; in fact, 
they experience a drastic reduction in the set of strategies available to them. They 
become increasingly more irrational in their decisions up to the point where they 
begin to ignore their own self-interest in order to harm the adversary; therefore, they 
mostly go for open aggression as a confict-coping style.
The seventh stage is characterized by sabotage. To prevent threats, parties bring 
about aggression by targeting the sanctioning potential of others. Since this tactic is 
1The concept of “face” was introduced by Goffman as “the positive social value a person effec￾tively claims for himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact” 
(Goffman, 1967, p. 5).
Escalation and De-escalation206
reciprocal, parties suffer signifcant losses, but their only focus is to infict superior 
damage on their adversaries. Such retaliation dynamics, however, easily escalate to 
violent actions directed not only against the resources of parties but also toward the 
integrity of parties themselves.
The eighth stage is simply destruction. When the consequences of reciprocal 
sabotage begin to put the very existence of parties at risk, they begin to focus on the 
destructive effects of their attacks independently of the problem of preventing 
threats: their purpose is now the pure and simple annihilation of the adversary, 
therefore making the confict irrational.
The ninth and last stage is what Glasl calls “together into the abyss”. At this 
point, he notices, parties have lost control of the violence and even contemplate the 
possibility of self-destruction if that also implies the destruction of the enemy. It is 
an all-out war in which no third party is allowed to remain neutral.
Glasl’s model offers a characterization of different degrees of a confict’s inten￾sity, but it is not intended to be an accurate classifcation of every possible process 
of confict escalation; rather, it is better construed as a useful tool to recognize the 
effects of certain escalating processes and to organize the intervention of third par￾ties. When the processes that contribute to increasing the intensity of a confict are 
individuated, Mitchell’s advice for planning interventions that might lead to the 
de-escalation of conficts is to engender processes that might “bring some change in 
the opposite direction” (2006, p.  88): disengage some of the parties, reduce the 
commitment of the adversaries in the confict, and, most of all, restore contacts and 
restart communication between them, so that their mutual cognitive environment 
could be extended. In the following, we will deal with a few examples of communi￾cative strategies that may bring about these changes.
Reframing
A major contribution to the positive transformation of confictual situations occurs 
when parties begin developing alternative perspectives about themselves and on one 
another, with respect to the relations they have and the behavior they adopt toward 
one another, a confict’s issues, and so on. In short, confict transformation is strictly 
related to the development of alternative frames for understanding a confict.
Frames as Cognitive Environments
The notion of frame has many parents but only one grandfather: the English psy￾chiatrist and anthropologist Gregory Bateson. All the authors that use and discuss 
some version of the frame theory agree on tracing back to his work on play and 
phantasies (Bateson, 1955). Bateson compared the behavior animals have when 
they fght and when they play at fghting. He noticed that animals adopt both sorts 
11 Confict Transformation207
of behavior as a response to certain signals. In both cases, they do the same things: 
they run, chase, and attack each other. And yet, when they play, their actions do not 
stand for what they usually stand for: attacks are not really attacks, bites are not 
really bites, and so on. Their actions, he concludes, have no meanings on their own, 
but only within a psychological frame in which they are interpreted.
After Bateson, frames have been rediscovered under different names and 
employed in different felds. The sociologist Ervin Goffman, for instance, devel￾oped frame theory as a general account of how cognitive subjects organize natural 
and social experience. According to Goffman, frames are “the principles of organi￾zation which govern events – at least social ones – and our subjective involvement 
in them” (Goffman, 1974, pp. 10–11). In other words, Goffman suggests under￾standing frames as the conceptual structures that allow us to answer the question: 
“what is going on here?” A frame is articulated in a set of elements—that is, the 
objects that belong to the structure—and scenarios—that is, what goes on according 
to certain rules and principles. There are both natural and social frames. For instance, 
in a frame that allows us to interpret the falling of a leaf, there are the leaf, a tree, the 
air, and the ground and the scenario of the leaf foating in the air and gently falling 
down to the ground. As another example, what takes place in a hospital can be inter￾preted with a frame in which there are doctors, patients, scalpels, operating rooms, 
and so on, and scenarios such as a doctor operating on a patient with a scalpel in an 
operating room. When something strange happens, such as a leaf falling up or a 
patient with a scalpel, we notice that it is, in fact, strange because it is out of 
the frame.
According to Goffman, frames are not static structures simply given to us: we 
can operate with frames. Specifcally, among the operations that Goffman discusses 
there is the keying of frames. Here, “keying” means transposition: just like musical 
scores can be transposed in another key, so certain parts of a frame can be trans￾posed into another frame in which they may assume different meanings. This is 
what happens in the games analyzed by Bateson: when animals are in “play-mode”, 
they transpose the meaning of the actions they perform when they fght for real into 
another frame that inherits the structure of the original one but systematically modi￾fes some of its parts. What is more interesting, however, is the fact that frames can 
also be fabricated, in the sense that they can be constructed intentionally to bring 
about specifc interpretations of certain events. Clearly, the effect of fabrications is 
to deceive those to whom they are proposed. This might be done with malicious 
intent, but it might also have positive consequences, as it happens, for instance, to 
the audience in the case of the theatrical experience.
Frames have also been considered essential for the analysis of language and 
communication (Tannen, 1993). In 1975, Charles Fillmore suggested that the 
semantic interpretation of linguistic expressions should always be defned with 
respect to a frame because that is the way in which they are understood (Fillmore, 
1976): since then, frame semantics, the study of how linguistic forms evoke cogni￾tive frames, has been a thriving feld of research in cognitive linguistics. Deeply 
infuenced by Fillmore’s work, the cognitive linguist George Lakoff proposed think￾ing of frames as neurobiolgically realized in the brain structure of a cognitive 
Reframing208
subject (Lakoff & Johnson, 2003). He explained the role of framing in public com￾munication and, especially, in the strategies that can be used to orient and set the 
agenda of political conficts (Lakoff, 2004).
The notion of frame has been developed over different research areas, with dif￾ferent intents and regarding different problems; thus, it is not a unitary notion at all. 
As far as confict theory is concerned, however, it is supposed to play a practical role 
in confict transformation; therefore, all these differences have mostly been blurred 
(Dewulf et al., 2009). In this context, a frame is simply the conceptual structure 
through which a party interprets a confict. At this level of generality, a frame can 
also be effcaciously construed as a cognitive environment in the terms of the cogni￾tive model of Relevance Theory. Both frames and cognitive environments are con￾ceptual structures that allow information processing. They play the same explanatory 
role with respect to the analysis of a cognitive system, in the sense that they both 
offer the basis for an account of how cognitive systems can select and use the infor￾mation relevant for them in order to perform their specifc tasks. Both the applica￾tion of frames and the modifcation of cognitive environments are pre/subconscious 
processes that are not represented by cognitive systems. Both determine semantic 
interpretations and infuence actions. The main differences between frames and 
cognitive environments depend on the theory of mind on the background of which 
they are defned: they might be taken to consist in different sorts of content (concep￾tual, preconceptual, prototypical, etc.) and to intrude to a greater or lesser extent on 
the gathering and determination of the information coming from different sources 
(perception, memory, etc.). Yet, there are reasons to disregard these differences for 
the sake of the present discussion. Specifcally, as we have already said, the applica￾tion of neither the notion of frame nor the notion of a cognitive environment in 
confict theory is really bound to any specifc theory of mind. Therefore, here we 
propose characterizing a frame exactly as the cognitive environment of a party 
engaged in a confict (qua so engaged).
Reframing Conficts
Against this background, it is easy to see why one of the most effcacious insights 
developed in the analysis of confict transformation is the idea of reframing. As 
Clem McCartney defnes it, reframing is “a learning process that involves a subject 
critically refecting on and then adapting assumptions in the framework they cur￾rently espouse” (McCartney, 2007, p. 3). In other words, reframing is the active 
modifcation of the framework in terms of which parties understand and act in the 
confict they are engaged in. Reframing has been successfully applied by peace￾keepers and peacebuilders in real-life conficts since the 1980s as a practical 
approach to confict transformation. But it also has an intrinsic value from a theo￾retical point of view because it shows what certain changes in the confict process 
consist in, especially those that can be engendered by communication. By modify￾ing the mutual cognitive environments of a confict’s parties, reframing intervenes 
11 Confict Transformation209
on the structure that determines the parties’ strategies and, consequently, the dynam￾ics of their interactions. In Chap. 9, this structure and these dynamics have been 
illustrated in the terms of Game Theory. Here again, game-theoretic analysis can 
help understanding the impact of reframing: as Mitchell noticed, “one crucial 
change that reframing can bring about is by altering conception of the nature of ‘self 
interest’” (Mitchell, 2006, p. 94). We have suggested above that a frame can be use￾fully construed as a cognitive environment. It is important, then, to keep in mind 
that a cognitive environment is constantly subject to updating and refnement as 
long as new experience is made and new stimula are processed. In this sense, the 
frame, that is the cognitive environment of parties in a confict, is always changing 
anyway. Reframing has to do with the changes connected to a confict’ positive 
transformations: depolarization, withdrawal of prejudices, broadening of the rea￾sons for cooperative actions. All these changes are brought forward by the extension 
of the parties’ mutual cognitive environment. It is for this reason that communica￾tion is crucial to reframing.
McCartney (2007) discusses some of a confict’s aspects that can be affected by 
reframing and are worth considering here by way of illustration. Among these is the 
very nature of the parties who are engaged in a confict and their relationship. We 
have already seen in the previous section that when a confict is in the zero-sum 
game phase, parties consider one another adversaries to be defeated. In such a sce￾nario, parties view any of the others’ disadvantage as an advantage for themselves. 
It is for this reason that they try to delegitimize one another so that the adversaries 
cannot fnd support in the outer community. They refuse to acknowledge their oppo￾nents as legitimate parties, so that they should not be allowed to interact with them 
at all. They may also try to argue that the others’ demands are illegitimate because 
they violate laws and morals, and, consequently, they should not be considered in 
the confict’s solution. They may even accuse the adversaries of lacking moral 
authority, and, therefore, they could not be trusted in the process of the confict’s 
resolution. As long as parties regard one another as untrustworthy enemies, win/win 
solutions to the confict are diffcult to fnd.2
 Reframing should transform the atti￾tudes of parties toward one another from blame to reciprocal recognition. 
Recognition means acknowledgment of the others as subjects with legitimate 
beliefs, interests, needs, and goals that must be considered in the confict’s dynam￾ics. As Hegel taught us, reciprocal recognition has normative implications: recogni￾tion is the attribution of a normative status, treating someone as committed and 
entitled to certain things and, thus, the acknowledgment of reciprocal authority and 
responsibility. Notice, however, that recognition per se does not imply the develop￾ment of positive attitudes: adversaries might well reciprocally recognize one 
another. Realizing this might in effect require the reframing of certain concepts. For 
instance, Coral Bell (1971) called “adversary partnership” the sort of relationship 
between Kennedy and Khrushchev that made it possible to negotiate a positive 
2 In Chap. 10, we noticed that cooperative strategies can succeed in repeated rounds of Prisoner’s 
Dilemma game only if there are enough players in the environment willing to trust the opponent 
and cooperate.
Reframing210
solution to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, based on the fact that both the leaders 
had a common interest in avoiding a nuclear war. Another example is the oxymo￾ronic concept of “parallel convergences”, used by the Italian politician Aldo Moro, 
leader of the Christian Democracy, to characterize the policy of strategic alliance 
with the Communist Party that led to the phase of the so-called Historic Compromise 
in the 1970s during which the Christian Democracy governed with the external sup￾port of the Communists. The sort of reframing that allows for reciprocal recognition 
does not guarantee conceptions to be shared between parties, but it makes it possible 
for them to think of themselves as engaged in the search for a solution to shared 
problems. In this new framework, the adversary becomes a resource rather than an 
obstacle for the achievement of one’s own goals.
Part of the reframing of the attitudes that parties have toward one another deals 
with the understanding that they have of their respective positions. As we have seen, 
parties tend to adopt opposite positions concerning the issues of a confict. The 
polarization of these positions is both the cause and the effect of the strategies that 
parties adopt to achieve their goals. Clearly, the more polarized the positions are, the 
less reconcilable they appear to be, and, as a result, a confict seems to be intractable 
to the parties; however, while polarization might generate new issues in a confict, 
the actual content of a confict is determined by the incompatibility present in the 
confict formation. While opposed positions may or may not be assumed by parties 
regarding different issues of the confict, the incompatibility often has to do with 
their very needs. As we have seen in Chap. 9, fundamental needs are distinct from 
interests and desires. Even if parties might develop a framework for the interpreta￾tion of their needs, these needs are something parties have independently from their 
attitudes and conceptions toward them. For this reason, they are exempt from polar￾ization and are therefore more easily reconcilable; besides, no confict can truly be 
resolved if the fundamental needs of the parts are taken into account in the solution. 
In this case, reframing consists in moving the focus from the positions parties 
assume in a confict to their needs.
As McCartney notices, another crucial component of a confict formation that 
can be affected by reframing is the nature of the very incompatibility that underlies 
a confict’s issues and, consequently, the nature of its possible solutions. The way in 
which the incompatibility is conceived essentially determines the phase of a confict 
in which parties take themselves to be engaged. Consider, for instance, a confict 
over certain resources. As long as parties believe that the benefts associated with 
the resources are exclusive, they will fght for the exclusive possession of the 
resources because they will envisage only win/lose solutions to the confict. The 
moment they cease to see any way of obtaining any utility from the confict, if for 
some reason they still feel compelled to take part in it (entrapment), they will settle 
for lose/lose solutions and accept to destroy the resources to ensure others cannot 
have them. This is the typical dynamics of the tragedy of the commons. Obviously, 
the parties should better be enabled to also see win/win solutions to their confict. 
The transformation from a lose/lose, to a win/lose and eventually to a win/win 
framework is exactly what the process of de-escalation is about; and in fact, as we 
have seen in game-theoretic models, this would allow parties to converge with their 
11 Confict Transformation211
strategies on more effcient equilibria. This is the purpose of reframing, but how can 
it be done?
Let us focus with McCartney on a toy example: two people, Peter and Mary, want 
one orange. Is there any way to handle this situation to make everyone happy? There 
are indeed many: here we consider fve of them. To begin with, if the goal of parties 
is not the exclusive possession of the resource and the resource is available in a suf￾fcient quantity, the resource can simply be divided. In our example, both Peter and 
Mary could have half the orange and be content with that. This clearly depends on 
what Peter and Mary’s needs truly are: in general, division will lead to a compro￾mise in which each party gains something and loses something. Another option is 
compensation. If it is not possible to divide the resource, the party who gets it can 
indemnify the other. For example, Mary could have the orange and give two apples 
to Peter for compensation. This second option is also a compromise; however, since 
a confict usually involves several issues, each party can obtain something it values 
and lose something unimportant for it if the negotiation is effcacious. Yet, not every 
reframing necessarily leads to a compromise. If other factors like time or other 
resources are not at issue, the parties can try to expand the resource to have enough 
of it to fully satisfy both. For instance, Peter and Mary could buy other oranges, or 
even decide to plant an orange tree and wait. This option is not always available, but 
even when it is, it easily goes unnoticed when unjustifed assumptions are made 
regarding the context. Another type of solution that might go unnoticed for the same 
reason is disaggregation. If the resource is articulated in different elements, proper￾ties or qualities, and parties are only interested in some of these, the parties may 
have what they want all together. In our example, Peter could have the orange peel 
to make a cake, while Mary could have the juice to drink. Disaggregation resolves 
the incompatibility: what the parties perceive as an incompatibility in fact reveals 
itself not to be. Again, in this case, it is crucial to clarify what the actual interests and 
needs of the parties are. The last option that we consider here is simply to let the 
parties have the resource in sequence. If the parties do not require the resource at the 
same time and if the resource can be used without ruining or impoverishing it, they 
may use it one after the other; in fact, a case in point would be if both Peter and 
Mary need the orange as a subject for a painting.
Overcoming Obstacles in Reframing
These are important aspects of a confict formation, the reframing of which might 
bring forward de-escalation dynamics. However, part of the framework in terms of 
which the parties understand and act in a confict also concerns the very negotiation 
in which the process of reframing should take place. In fact, parties have concep￾tions regarding the best strategies to gain the most for themselves from negotiation, 
that is, to obtain the satisfaction of their own requests. When the frame of a negotia￾tion hinges on the self-interest of the parties, the cooperative approach might be 
considered wasteful because it requires a corresponding move from the adversaries 
Reframing212
who are untrustworthy, and is therefore perceived as a sign of weakness. This is 
exactly the sort of situation that we explored with Game Theory in Chap. 10 when 
we discussed the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Parties are often dissatisfed with the less￾effcient, non-cooperative approach but consider themselves forced to adopt it in 
reason of the antagonism of the adversaries; besides, parties are much more willing 
to adopt cooperative strategies at the very beginning of a confict, rather than at its 
end or after the confict has been going on for some time. As we have seen, this may 
depend on end-of-game effects. But it may also depend on the fact that the parties’ 
framework becomes increasingly less fexible. This is due to the intrinsic conserva￾tism of the cognitive environments and of the various vicious circles produced by 
the confictual interaction between the parties that tend to confrm preconceptions 
and reciprocal distrust. In an escalation process, however, the noncooperative 
approach typically entraps parties into a situation in which everyone is strong 
enough to prevent the other to win, but no one is strong enough to actually win the 
confict. This situation has been called “hurting stalemate” (cf. e.g., Rubin et al., 
2004), and is characterized by the fact that, while every party suffers important 
losses in participating in a confict and with all probability will be unable to win and 
be compensated, it still endures because it does not see any convenient way to get 
out of it.3
The reasons why parties feel entrapped in a confict usually stems from the fact 
that their frames grow increasingly more rigid and simplifed during confict escala￾tion. Some of the vicious circles that are responsible for this have already been 
discussed. One of them is the phenomenon of the so-called self-fulflling prophecy. 
Another one we noticed in the analysis of evolutionary stage games of the Prisoner’s 
Dilemma is the following: it is extremely diffcult for cooperators to invade an envi￾ronment in which there are only noncooperative players. Generally speaking, the 
vicious circles that make cognitive environments rigid and impervious to reframing 
have the following shape (Fig. 11.5).
These kinds of circles go around in the following manner. A party entertains a 
preconception that makes it resist reframing; therefore, it experiments other ways of 
coping with the confict. Yet, in the absence of any modifcation of the framework in 
terms of which the party understands and acts in the confict, it obtains little, if any, 
result. Such failures, in turn, confrm the party’s preconceptions.
The deeper the parties are entangled in vicious circles and stalemates, the more 
strenuously they oppose reframing. They can adopt several tactics to do this, even 
during the negotiations; for instance, they might pretend to constructively engage in 
negotiations with the intention of fnding shared solution and willingness to revise 
their preconceptions, while in fact they aim and behave in such a way as to impose 
their frame on their adversaries. As we have seen, parties soon begin to think of their 
3Obviously, this is why parties are dissatisfed with the non-cooperative approach. Some authors 
have identifed just the situation of hurting stalemates as the moment in which the confict is “ripe” 
to begin the process of de-escalation, because the parties might be frustrated by their previous 
courses of action and therefore be more willing to seek settlements (Zartman & Berman, 1982; 
Zartman, 1983, 1985, 2000).

frame as the right one during the process of escalation and try to make others accept 
it. As a result, they tend to conceive reframing as the revision of the others’ frames 
only. For instance, they negotiate by posing the acceptance of their point of view as 
a condition; besides, they distrust the other parties during negotiations because they 
fear that their possible openness might in fact be a maneuver to impose their own 
frame. If none of the parties succeeds in imposing their own frame on the others, 
they all risk of getting entrapped in a hurting stalemate, especially in asymmetric 
conficts where the stronger party focuses exclusively on subduing the weaker party 
and the weaker party focuses exclusively on resisting the stronger party.
Parties might also resist reframing even if they are honestly willing to openly 
engage in a negotiation. They might believe, for instance, that the main issues of a 
confict are too diffcult to tackle directly; therefore, they might prefer to set them 
aside at frst and address minor issues in the meantime to see whether fnding a 
shared solution to the latter could favor the reciprocal trust required among the par￾ties to go back to the former more successfully at a later date. As a matter of fact, 
this is often the approach promoted by mediators because it should favor the elimi￾nation of reciprocal prejudices from the parties’ frames. If the reframing does not 
affect the structure of a confict, however, progress might be limited; hence, there is 
the risk of generating frustration in the parties that could trigger vicious reinforce￾ments of their own frames instead. Parties might even be tempted to drop coopera￾tion and try to impose their frames, even while negotiating on the minor issues. This 
in turn could lead to entrapment and stalemates.
On the one hand, even if parties abandon the idea of imposing their framework 
and start openly negotiating to avoid hurting stalemates, still, if they do not engage 
in reframing processes, they risk obtaining no results, getting frustrated and rein￾forcing their cognitive environments. On the other hand, if parties try vice versa to 
forcefully break the vicious circles of negotiation failures and frustration by impos￾ing their frame on their adversaries, they risk entrapment in hurting stalemates. 
Clearly, the alternative would be to try to seriously engage in the process of 
Reframing214
reframing. In confict studies, the resistance of parties in adopting new perspectives 
in the confict is usually explained by the fact that parties invest their frameworks 
with emotional and identity values: in their frames they see the conditions in terms 
of which they can recognize, act, and achieve their goals. Therefore, to abandon 
their frame is for them not only to give up on the confict but also, on a deeper level, 
to lose themselves. Besides, in the win/lose phase of a confict, the persevering com￾mitment to their own frame is conceived as a tactical advantage: if the adversary is 
less determined, they will give up frst. Again, this approach likely leads to a hurting 
stalemate.
The cognitive analysis of communication proposed by the Relevance Theory of 
Sperber and Wilson also allows us to consider another reason that contributes to 
explaining the resistance of parties to put effort into the process of reframing; in 
fact, the conservativeness of a framework has certain cognitive advantages that have 
to do with the optimization of the information. A cognitive subject with limited 
cognitive resources must allocate them only to processing the most relevant infor￾mation, in order to be effcient in performing their tasks. Information is relevant to 
a cognitive subject only if it produces high contextual effects at the price of low 
cognitive efforts. New information can replace old information already present in 
the cognitive environment only if it is stronger than the latter. However, the more 
involved a subject is in an escalating confict, the more accessible and stronger their 
frame will be and the harder it will be to revise it. It is therefore not easy to modify 
a frame: in order for some new contrasting information to be integrated in the par￾ties’ cognitive environment, it must not only be true and practically useful but also 
cognitively convenient.
Reframing requires effcacious communication strategies that must break the 
vicious circles with which the frame confrms itself. Thinking frames in terms of 
cognitive environments is useful here: it allows us to apply the Relevance Theory 
approach to the problem and think of reframing in this context as a specifc instance 
of the process of enlarging the mutual cognitive environment of a confict’s parties. 
Generally speaking, therefore, a signifcant part of the success of reframing depends 
on the ability of the parties and mediators to produce ostensive stimula designed to 
add shared information to their cognitive environments and discharge the incompat￾ible ones. As was more extensively discussed in Chap. 7, to obtain these contextual 
effects it is crucial that the stimula are relevant enough for the parties to treat them 
with the minimum cognitive effort they are willing to put into the negotiation. The 
communication that is intended to bring forward the process of reframing must 
therefore be carefully calibrated on the characteristics of the stage in which the 
confict happens to be.
Reframing involves the introduction of new concepts and the modifcation of old 
ones. It aims to fnd new ways to understand the structure of a confict, the incom￾patibility that generates it, and its possible shared solution. It also creates new rela￾tions between the issues of the confict and helps in realizing whether issues impact 
one another, in discovering correlations between them, in fnding common causes, 
and in developing explanations.
11 Confict Transformation215
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we considered the processes of confict escalation and de-escalation. 
We began by noticing that these processes can be better understood by thinking of 
confict management as aiming at the positive transformation rather than the resolu￾tion of confictual situations. In fact, the intensity and complexity of a confict are 
not quantities that may be linearly increased or decreased; when the structure of 
confictual situations changes, it does so in radical ways. In his model, Friedrich 
Glasl describes nine stages of escalation and highlights how each stage is character￾ized by progressively more severe dynamics of contraposition that cannot be simply 
reversed once established. De-escalation requires the transformation of these 
dynamics.
In this regard, a major contribution to the positive transformation of a confictual 
situation occurs when parties develop alternative perspectives on the situation itself, 
modify their perceptions about their adversaries, and envisage new solutions to their 
issues. This process is known as the reframing of a confict. In cognitive sciences, a 
frame is the background information that allows the interpretation of actions and 
events. For our purposes, we can think of frames in terms of the cognitive environ￾ments of Relevance Theory. In this sense, a confict’s reframing is the modifcation 
of the parties’ mutual cognitive environment and can be achieved through commu￾nication. Reframing, however, is not easy because cognitive environments are char￾acteristically hard to modify in confictual situations.

Further Advanced Reading
Confict management is obviously one of the main objects of research in peace stud￾ies, and many different approaches have been developed to understand and practice 
it. This chapter mainly focused on the transformational approach to confict man￾agement. For the very idea of confict transformation, see part II of Galtung (1996). 
Galtung has developed what he calls the “Transcend method” for confict transfor￾mation: a description of the method with useful examples of practical applications 
can be found in Galtung (2000, 2004). Another approach to confict transformation 
is presented in Mitchell (2006). The notion of reframing as a kind of confict trans￾formation is more thoroughly discussed in Mayer (2000). For the role of communi￾cation in confict transformation, see also Krauss and Morsella (2006) and 
Saunders (2008).

The Communicative Constitution of 
Organizations219
Chapter 12
Organizations and Communication
What Is an Organization?
The theory of organizations raises interesting challenges from a philosophical point 
of view. As was the case for the theory of communication and the theory of con￾ficts, the frst question worth asking here again in our investigation is: What is an
organization? And once again, we may experience by now a familiar puzzlement 
when confronted with this sort of question. On the one hand, we are certainly well 
acquainted with organizational phenomena, such as public administrations, compa￾nies, political parties, associations, committees, and so on. On the other hand, how￾ever, we may be unsure as to how to characterize them. So, consider the United 
Nations, for example. We defnitely know that the UN is an organization: indeed, as 
is stated in the preamble of its charter, it is an organization of peoples aiming to 
prevent war, affrm human rights, establish justice, and promote progress. And yet, 
we also know that the peoples who individually pursue those same goals all around 
the world do not constitute an organization per se. What is it, then, that constitutes 
them as an organization? And, in general, what does it mean for the members of an 
organization to constitute it? As a matter of fact, we can easily point out organiza￾tional structures and processes, but we may not know what to say if asked to explain 
what makes them organizational. We recur to metaphors at times in trying to express 
what we mean when we talk about organizations. For etymological reasons, a very 
common one is the metaphor of the organism (e.g., Laloux, 2014, p.  56). 
Organizations are thus like organisms because their parts pursue common goals by 
interacting with one another and collectively acting on and adapting to their envi￾ronment. And yet, there are many other ways in which organizations are not like 
organisms: they do not reproduce, they do not evolve by natural selection, and, most 
importantly, they are made of people rather than sub-personal parts. Metaphors may 
be suggestive and even illuminating at times, but they will soon let us down in our 
analysis.

In effect, when we think about it, we quickly come to realize that organizations 
are quite elusive to characterize. Still, any dictionary contains a defnition of orga￾nization. It is interesting to consider dictionary defnitions in a preliminary way, 
because they may help in focusing on the sort of problems that arise when a proper 
analysis of organizational phenomena is attempted. If we look for a defnition of 
organization in a learner’s dictionary, what we will fnd is typically something along 
the following lines: an organization is “a group of people who work together in an 
organized way for a shared purpose” (Cambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.
cambridge.org/, 2021). This type of defnition is all but uncommon in organizational 
textbooks as well (cf. e.g., Smith et al., 2013). Defnitions of organization such as 
this one all usually stress the same three points: (a) organizations are groups of 
people, (b) people in an organization cooperate with each another, and (c) they 
pursue the same goal. But then the problem with this way of defning organizations 
is that (a)–(c) involve notions that, as we have often noticed in this book, are in turn 
very problematic in themselves.
To begin with, take the concept of a group. The dictionary defnition suggests 
that people working together with the same purpose do not constitute an organiza￾tion if they do not form a group, and, yet, when is it the case that a collection of 
people properly forms a group? Although the words “collection” and “group” are 
sometimes treated as synonyms, they do not quite designate the same thing. 
Consider, for instance, all the people born on March 31, 1981, or the people inside 
the Sistine Chapel at this very moment. Clearly, they are two collections of people, 
but do they form two groups? Collections are simply classifcatory items: if you 
think of a property, you can always pick the collection (or set) of objects which 
satisfy it—with certain specifc exceptions very well known in set theory. A collec￾tion in this sense could even be empty: if it is 4 am, presumably there is no one 
inside the Sistine Chapel. On the other hand, there is no set of intrinsic or extrinsic 
properties that is necessary and suffcient for people to share in order to form a 
group. This is because groups are social objects (as are organizations). The meta￾physics of social objects is the topic of social ontology, a wide research feld in 
philosophy which we cannot even begin to explore here1
; nevertheless, we will have 
to deal with some of its puzzles if we want to understand what organizations are.
Social objects are not of the same sort as ordinary objects such as chairs or 
cats: even if we sometimes talk about them in the same ways, they are identifed 
by different criteria, we apply different predicates to them, and we do different 
things with them. The philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the confusion between 
these different types of objects a “category mistake” and illustrated it with the 
following anecdote, which is especially instructive as far as the analysis of orga￾nizations is concerned:
A foreigner visiting Oxford or Cambridge for the frst time is shown a number of colleges, 
libraries, playing felds, museums, scientifc departments and administrative offces. He 
then asks “But where is the University? I have seen where the members of the Colleges live, 
1See, however, Chap. 17.
12 Organizations and Communication221
where the Registrar works, where the scientists experiment and the rest. But I have not yet 
seen the University in which reside and work the members of your University.” It has then 
to be explained to him that the University is not another collateral institution, some ulterior 
counterpart to the colleges, laboratories and offces which he has seen. The University is 
just the way in which all that he has already seen is organized. (Ryle, 1949, p. 6)
The foreigner in Ryle’s story is simply not familiar with treating the compo￾nents of the University as a unitary object. For our purposes, it is sufficient to 
notice that an important condition for the existence of social objects is that they 
are recognized and treated as such. Think, for example, about a social object 
that we are all familiar with: money. Money is not an organization, but like 
organizations it is a social object. Does money exist? In this moment, I have 
money in my wallet and I can use it to buy a coffee. An espresso costs one euro, 
and I can pay it by passing a coin to the barista. But obviously, none of the 
material properties of the coin accounts for the fact that I can give it to baristas 
and get a coffee in return. As a matter of fact, I also have money in my bank 
account, and I could use it as well to buy an espresso for one euro without han￾dling any cash. Generally speaking, social objects are characterized by certain 
social rules that establish how to correctly treat them. Social objects exist to the 
extent that people recognize certain rules and accept to be bound by them.2
Treating something as money, for instance, is treating it as an object that can be 
universally given and received in exchange for goods and services; thus, money 
exists because people treat it in certain ways in certain practices.
In a sense, social objects resemble fctional ones.3
 A group of children playing 
astronauts, for instance, may decide to treat a couch as a spaceship. Fictional objects 
are objects existing only inside a story, such as Edmond Dantès or the spaceship of 
the group of children playing astronauts. Therefore, also fctional objects exist 
because they are treated in certain ways according to certain rules.4
 But social 
objects are not merely fctional. On the one hand, the rules of a fctional story are 
completely internal to it, meaning they can only be evaluated with respect to the 
fction that they establish. Edmond Dantès cannot be both the Count of Monte Cristo 
and Socrates’ wife in the story as it is, but nothing really constrained Dumas from 
adopting this rule in the narrative.5
 On the other hand, social rules have a different 
kind of objectivity, meaning they are evaluated with respect to how things are in the 
world. You could certainly treat whatever you want as money if only the others are 
willing to play along, so to speak. But the reason why they probably will not is 
2See Searle (1995, 2010).
3For an analysis of the metaphysics of fctional objects, see, for example, (Thomasson, 1999).
4Rakoczy and Tomasello (2007) suggested that the cognitive processes in the two cases are essen￾tially the same, and the ontogenetic origins of human ability to create social objects can be traced 
back to children’s ability to engage in pretend play.
5Clearly, that would probably be a very poor fctional story. But in what sense could this be con￾sidered an external, objective constraint on the rules governing the existence of Edmond Dantès in 
the fctional story?
What Is an Organization?222
because the goods and services which you would exchange for that money have 
certain objective underpinnings that the social rules governing money have to 
consider.6
The rules establishing organizations are social rules. In this sense, people in an 
organization form a group because they treat themselves and are treated by others as 
members of such a group in a framework of social rules. The problem now is to 
explain what this means and when it is correct to treat something as an organization; 
unfortunately, these are probably among the hardest questions to answer in contem￾porary organizational theory. Organizations, in fact, are indeed social objects, but 
they are not merely objects: they act. Consider, in general, what it is to treat some￾thing as an agent. As already noticed in Chap. 9, agency can be characterized in 
terms of intentionality: an action is a behavior that is intentional according to at 
least some description of it (Davidson, 1971). Both my laptop and my neighbors, for 
instance, sometimes behave in ways that annoy me: my laptop requires updates I do 
not want to do, and my neighbors listen to the TV at a high volume. Obviously, 
neither my laptop nor my neighbors intend to irritate me, but while my neighbors 
intend to hear the TV well enough for themselves, there is no way to describe my 
laptop’s requiring updates as something it intends to do. The laptop, in fact, has no 
intentions whatsoever, and, therefore, none of its behaviors is to be considered an 
action. To the contrary of my neighbors, my laptop cannot be treated as an agent, 
and no responsibility can be ascribed to it for what it does.
Treating something as an agent is treating it as able to perform intentional behav￾ior. Actions can be explained by ascribing to the agent goals to pursue and beliefs 
about how to pursue them. My neighbors, for instance, want to hear the TV well and 
believe that by turning up the volume they will achieve their goal. Similarly, treating 
an organization as an agent is ascribing goals and beliefs to it. But how can organi￾zations have goals and beliefs? Certainly, it does not mean to say that the people 
who constitute an organization all have the same goals and beliefs. Consider goals 
frst. Suppose the only goal that a company members all pursue is obtaining a pro￾motion. This does not mean that obtaining a promotion is the goal of the company; 
besides, as we know from Part II, the pursuit of the same goal is likely to give rise 
to confict rather than organization. The same applies to beliefs. Suppose all mem￾bers of a research group have supervised an experiment: each member has collected 
a different dataset and has different views about the experiment. It could even be the 
case that the beliefs of the individual members are incompatible with one another.
The purposes and beliefs of an organization should be what motivates the collec￾tive actions of its members. But what is a collective or social action? Here again we 
run into an obstacle. Clearly, doing the same thing often does not count as a 
6The reader must be aware of the fact that a lot of dust is being swept under the rug with these 
commonsensical remarks. From a philosophical point of view, the task of providing a satisfactory 
account of the objectivity of socially established norms is an enormous one. Fortunately, however, 
it does not signifcantly add much to the point we are making as far as our present purposes are 
concerned. We will therefore make do with the intuitive distinction between fctional and social 
objects, and, as philosophers use to say when they are exposed, leave that story for another day.
12 Organizations and Communication223
collective action; thus, a group of workers lifting a piano do it collectively, but when 
they all take a rest and smoke a cigarette, they do the same thing but do it individu￾ally. Intuitively, the difference seems to be that only in the frst one the workers 
really do the same thing together, meaning they cooperate.
Cooperation is the last of the points mentioned by our dictionary defnition of 
organization. We have already discussed it at length in the second part of this book 
with relation to the theory of conficts. We encounter it again here as a crucial ele￾ment for the characterization of organizations. Cooperation is fostered when people 
share goals and beliefs in the way we have seen earlier. The process by which peo￾ple come to share goals and beliefs is what has been called the enlargement of a 
“mutual cognitive environment” by Sperber and Wilson (1986) and the construction 
of a “frame” by Bateson (1972) and Goffman (1974). We could even already say 
that this very process is what ultimately constitutes organizational phenomena: 
organizations share concepts and practices to interpret the world, and develop 
shared reasons for action. This, of course, can be obtained only through communi￾cation. It is by communicating that people enlarge their mutual cognitive environ￾ments and construct shared frames in which they are recognized and recognize 
themselves as a group with shared purposes and cooperate to achieve them. Indeed, 
as far as the relation between communication and human organization is concerned, 
the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey wrote:
Society not only continues to exist by transmission, by communication, but it may fairly be 
said to exist in transmission, in communication. There is more than a verbal tie between the 
words common, community, communication. Men live in a community in virtue of the 
things they have in common; and communication is the way in which they come to possess 
things in common. (Dewey, 1916, p. 4)
There are various forms of organizational communication that determine different 
organizational structures and are worth discussing.
The CCO Thesis
The idea we will explore in this chapter and those to follow is that communication 
is the key concept in the analysis of what organization is. In a way, the most straight￾forward incarnation of this idea is the thesis that communication constitutes organi￾zations (CCO) (McPhee & Zaug, 2000). It is interesting to briefy review how this 
thesis has been brought about.
In an article published in 2004, Gail Fairhurst and Linda Putnam noticed a grow￾ing interest in discourse analysis on the part of scholars in organizational sciences 
(Fairhurst & Putnam, 2004). They mainly referred to the works of critical theorists 
such as Stanley Deetz (1992), ethnomethodologists such as Deirdre Boden (1994), 
The CCO Thesis224
and, in particular, the communication scientist James R. Taylor (Taylor, 1988; 
Taylor et al., 1996; Taylor & van Every, 2000).7
Conversation analysis originated from the research of Harvey Sacks, Emmanuel 
Schegloff, and Gail Jefferson (1974). It is the study of the regularities that occur in 
discursive situations when people talk with each another. An obvious yet intriguing 
observation to be made about discourses is that almost invariably people take turns 
in conversation in these situations: only one person speaks at a time, changeovers 
are smooth, and the number of participants does not affect them. Apparently, speak￾ers follow implicit rules for turn-taking that govern their discursive practices. When 
something goes wrong, for instance when two speakers fnd themselves talking at 
the same time, they either treat the violation as unintentional and try to correct the 
mistake or treat it as intentional and try to understand the reason for it; these, of 
course, are simple organizational rules. But more complex rules govern how conver￾sations are initiated and terminated, how words and topics are chosen, and how the 
social relations between speakers infuence the register of the conversation and the 
characteristics of the conversational slots assigned to the participants. What is 
thought-provoking from the point of view of organization theory is that the rule￾governed practices of conversation, in the different contexts in which they are per￾formed, could be seen as the foundation upon which every organization is grounded.
Without question, this approach implies an extremely wide characterization of 
organizational phenomena. Taylor and van Every, for instance, proposed an “ele￾mentary” defnition: an organization is “that which serves to constrain interaction 
by structuring its occasions of talk and, by so doing, to generate a kind of common 
accord (not necessarily unanimous) as to the objects and agent of communication” 
(Taylor & van Every, 2000, p. 73). Their idea, then, is that communication provides 
the basic tools for internally controlling and stabilizing multi-agent practices. The 
challenge of this path is to extend this analysis from the small and simple practices 
of conversation to the big and complex ones of organizational management; that is 
to say, the challenge is to explain how communication can construct the mutual 
cognitive environments required by collective agents engaged in articulated 
cooperation.
Various approaches to this challenge have been recognized. Fairhurst and 
Putnam, for instance, classify three different orientations in the analysis of the rela￾tionship between communication and organization:
Some researchers see an organization as an already formed object or entity with features 
and outcomes refected in discourse. Other scholars see organizations in a constant state of 
becoming through the ways that the properties of discourse and patterns of interaction shape 
7The idea that organization is essentially constituted by communication was also forcefully put 
forward by Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998) in his theory of autopoietic social systems (Luhmann, 
1995, 2018); however, the way in which Luhmann represents communication, while convenient 
for his analysis of organizations, is ultimately unrecognizable from the point of view of the 
approach that we have adopted here. We therefore prefer to omit the presentation of his theory, 
even if we acknowledge it as an attempt to go beyond the classical theory of organizations by offer￾ing answers similar to those that we offer here to problems similar to those from which we began.
12 Organizations and Communication225
organizing. Still others see organizations as grounded in action, anchored in social practices 
and discursive forms. (Fairhurst & Putnam, 2004, pp. 5–6)
In effect, this tripartition is generally characteristic of the metatheory of organiza￾tion, in the sense that it can be generally applied to characterize various approaches 
to the analysis of organizations, even outside CCO. The frst orientation, for exam￾ple, was typical of the functionalist approach of Systems Theory; it considers orga￾nizations as objects with a certain structure. The structure represents the roles that 
the various parts play in the overall functioning of the organization and the relations 
that they have with one another. The structure is an abstract entity that is instantiated 
by the actual parts that compose the organization at a given time. In a sense, how￾ever, it can be said to exist independently of any of its instantiations; for instance, 
the structure remains the same if one of the parts of the organization is substituted 
with another one with the same function, for example in a company when an 
employee is fred and another one is hired to do the same job. If one thinks of orga￾nizations as objects in this way, then the study of their structure must come frst in 
the analysis. Scholars with this orientation think that either organizations are to be 
identifed with their structure or at least that they can be better understood only in 
terms of their structure. Communication is considered as something that happens 
inside an organization and contributes, among other things, to constituting its struc￾ture, but as distinct from what the organization is. As we have said, however, orga￾nizations are social objects. The problem with this orientation, then, is that by 
focusing only on structures it may be hard to explain how organizations are consti￾tuted and how they change in order to successfully adapt themselves and their activ￾ities to the environment in which they operate.
The second orientation focuses on the process of organizing, rather than on the 
object that results from it. More precisely, scholars with this orientation reject the 
very idea that organizations are objects altogether. The process of organizing is the 
process of collectively acting in and coping with the environment by adapting to the 
feedback it provides. Communication precedes the process of organizing and is 
essential to it, because it allows interactions and the establishing of the norms that 
make it possible in the frst place. In characterizing this orientation, Fairhurst and 
Putnam have in mind the approach of Karl Weick (1969), who originally suggested 
thinking of organizations in terms of verbs such as “organizing” rather than nouns 
such as “organization”. But they also ascribe this orientation to those scholars in 
organization theory who try to develop a Foucauldian discourse analysis.8
Elaborating on the work of the French philosopher Michel Foucault, such an 
approach investigates the relations between language and power and conceives the 
formation of discourses in socially and historically contingent situations as the pro￾cess of establishing power/knowledge relations that are then perceived as objective 
and necessary inside the framework of ideas provided by those discourses, that is, 
in Foucault’s terminology, discourses tend to produce ideology: structure is the 
product of discursive practices, but it is then perceived as objective inside those 
8For an overview, see, for example (Knights & Morgan, 1991) and (McKinlay & Starkey, 1998).
The CCO Thesis226
practices (Foucault, 1969, 1976, 1980). While sharing the emphasis on the dynam￾ics of the discursive processes that constitute organization, the Foucauldian approach 
has the merit of also trying to account for the objectivity of organizational structures 
or, at least, for the reasons why they are taken to be objective. The overall problem 
with this second orientation is that while it is easy to make sense of organization 
processes at the micro-level of minimal discursive practices, for example using a 
certain set of labels to classify work performance or ascribing a certain normative 
status to someone together with a certain title, it is much harder to explain how 
socially complex organizational structures can be synthesized by purely discur￾sive means.
The third orientation, according to Fairhurst and Putnam, “treats action and 
structure as mutually constitutive” (Fairhurst & Putnam, 2004, p. 16). What they 
mean by this is that the main feature of this last orientation is to conceive the discur￾sive practices that constitute organizations as processes of action and interpretation. 
In this sense, an organization is construed as a refexive process in which discursive 
practitioners provide accounts for the outcomes of their previous performance and, 
from these interpretations, draw the rules that will guide their own future actions. In 
this regard, the rules that constitute the structure of an organization are established 
by the way in which practitioners make sense of their actions and, at the same time, 
determine the actions of the practitioners themselves. As Taylor and van Every put 
it, organization emerges from this accounting process:
If organization is emergent in communication, as we believe, then it is not a being, but a 
becoming. What we ought to be studying is not organization or ideology, because neither 
has any ontological status independent of communication, but the processes of communica￾tion by which we continue to construct both to become the world we live in. (Taylor & van 
Every, 2000, p. x)
The problem with this last orientation is that it forces the analysis of organizational 
phenomena into a tension between the notions of object and process. On the one 
hand, an organization is conceived as the object that results from the world-coping 
processes consisting in communicative practices. On the other hand, organization is 
also thought of as the process of communicative reinterpretation of the previously 
adopted world-coping solutions purported to modify them.
Different Approaches to the Study of Organizations
Organizations are undergoing turbulent changes recently. Markets and societies are 
changing so rapidly and deeply that both individuals and collectivities struggle to 
keep pace. Unquestionably, this is what they have always been doing in our contem￾porary history; and yet, at present, we arguably face challenges of a previously 
unknown magnitude. Globalization is subverting standard methods of production 
and distribution of wealth all around the world. Technological innovation is con￾cretely reinforcing the promise of relieving humanity of the burden of sustaining 
economic reproduction through its own labor, possibly at the cost of making human 
12 Organizations and Communication227
beings themselves economically unnecessary. Ecological disequilibria resulting in 
climate change and global pandemics are threatening our very existence as a species 
on this planet.
From a theoretical point of view, the CCO model for the interpretation of organi￾zational phenomena faces the considerable challenge of making sense of these pro￾cesses. To better understand the answers this model provides, we will frst introduce 
the questions traditionally raised in the study of organizations. We will begin in 
Chap. 13 by considering some classical alternatives to CCO proposed by the theory 
of Scientifc Management and by the Human Relations approach. We will quickly 
review their historical development and discuss their shortcomings. To better under￾stand organizing processes, Chap. 14 will deal with Systems Theory, which will 
assist in focusing on the relations between the parts of an organization and the rela￾tions of an organization with its environment. We will then move on to illustrate 
some of the forms in which CCO has been proposed. In Chap. 15, we will present 
Weick’s theory of sensemaking, which characterizes organizations in terms of the 
communicative activities of agents who are engaged in the process of making sense 
of the world. Chap. 16 will discuss Taylor and van Every’s idea that organization 
emerges from conversational practices when the appropriate expressive resources 
are available and persist. Finally, Chaps. 17 and 18 will develop the CCO thesis with 
the analysis of the way in which organizations can be treated as objects and agents.
Chapter Summary
We began the third part of this book by questioning our basic intuitions about what 
organizations are. We noticed that these intuitions usually gravitate toward three main 
ideas. The frst is that organizations are groups of people. The second is that organiza￾tion implies cooperation. The third is that it therefore requires sharing goals and inten￾tions. We also acknowledged that all these ideas contain notions that are deeply 
intertwined and highly problematic from a philosophical point of view: groups are 
social objects whose status depends on constitutive norms, following the same norms 
requires cooperation, and cooperation is only possible by sharing beliefs and intentions.
This preliminary analysis has an interesting consequence. If we accept the idea 
that communication is precisely what allows us to share beliefs and intentions, it 
seems plausible to try to explain organizations in terms of communicative processes. 
This is basic idea of the thesis that communication constitutes organizations. There 
are various ways in which this idea can be understood, that depend on how commu￾nication is construed and offer different views about what organizations are. If one 
thinks of communication as the transferring of information, then one will conceive 
organization as the structure of the fows of information that connect the members of 
a group. If one thinks of communication as a practice instead, then one will conceive 
organization as essentially consisting of processes of interpretation. Finally, if one 
thinks of communication as a means for extending mutual cognitive environments, 
then one will conceive organization as a process of constitution of social groups.

Chapter 13
Classical Theories of Organizations
This chapter contains a brief presentation of two of the major approaches that have 
dominated both the theory and the practice of organization in the twentieth century. 
The origin of the frst one, Scientifc Management, coincided with the birth of the 
modern theory of organizations. The second one, Human Resources, emerged in 
reaction to the failures of the frst as a diagnosis of its defects and an attempt to 
elaborate alternatives that could avoid them. In their paradigmatic and idealized 
form, however, both approaches have been proven to be insuffcient by themselves 
for the purpose of providing the theoretical and technical resources to understand 
the complexity of organizational phenomena and to operate with them.
Scientifc Management
Modern studies on organizations began in the 1910s with relation to specifc busi￾ness management problems. In the previous one and a half centuries, the industrial 
revolution had required a reconstrual of the way in which individual labor contrib￾uted to the new manufacturing processes that characterized industrial production. 
The need for a new analysis can easily be appreciated by comparing the activity of 
an artisan in a workshop to the labor of a worker in a factory. The former manufac￾tures his goods individually and takes responsibility for his actions and choices in 
the production as well as for the quality and the value of his products in the market. 
The latter contributes with a specifc operation to a production process on whose 
general structure and outcomes he has neither control nor responsibility. Clearly, the 
essential role of the division of labor for the success of the industrialized production 
processes had already long been noticed and celebrated. Adam Smith, preeminently,

had vividly illustrated the division of labor’s convenience in his famous example of 
a pin factory.1
 It is worth quoting here in its entirety:
To take an example, therefore, from a very trifing manufacture; but one in which the divi￾sion of labor has been very often taken notice of, the trade of the pin-maker; a workman not 
educated to this business (which the division of labor has rendered a distinct trade), nor 
acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same 
division of labor has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost 
industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in 
which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is 
divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. 
One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a ffth 
grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct 
operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade 
by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this 
manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are 
all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two 
or three of them. I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were 
employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct opera￾tions. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with 
the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them 
about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins 
of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty￾eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight 
thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. 
But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having 
been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made 
twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, 
perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of 
performing, in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different opera￾tions. (Smith, 1776, pp. 14–15)
There are three things especially worth noticing in Smith’s presentation from the 
perspective of organizational analysis. First, the fact that the division of labor 
requires the identifcation of the tasks in which a specifc job can be effciently 
divided. Although the concept potentially applies to any job (even “trifing” ones), 
the actual division is the result of a delicate process of analysis and planning that 
must be adapted to the characteristics of the different jobs. Second, workers require 
specialized education in the branches in which the job has been divided. Since the 
fnal product of the job is the result of the coordinated activity of different workers, 
1The detailed analysis of the operations required for the production of a pin in Smith’s example is 
substantially quoted from the entry “Épingle”, written by Alexandre Deleyre for the Encyclopédie, 
edited by Diderot and D’Alembert, and published from 1751 to 1772. In this sense, the 
Enlightenment had a decisive infuence on the consolidation of the theoretical background for the 
development of the scientifc management of labor. The celebration of the “machine” both as a 
symbol of the power of the technique and as a model for the understanding of reality paved the 
way, among other things, for the material analysis of cooperation. Long before the success of sci￾entifc management, such principles were applied to the training of European armies, with the 
purpose of identifying a set of effcient, simple operations that soldiers should learn and execute 
unconsciously, as gears in a mechanism.
13 Classical Theories of Organizations231
the ability of a single workman is not to be assessed with respect to the quality of 
what he produces but to the effciency with which he performs certain operations. 
Third, effciency consists in time saving. Given that quality standards must be dealt 
with in the planning of the production process, workers are simply as effcient as 
they are fast in performing their tasks.
Frederick Taylor
Considering all these elements is crucial to signifcantly increase the productivity of 
a specifc trade by means of the division of labor. This means that the very concept 
of the division of labor raises an organizational question: How should the labor of 
the individual workers be organized to optimize the production processes of a fac￾tory? This is the question that the American engineer Frederick Taylor addressed in 
his seminal investigations into business management. In his most famous work, The 
Principles of Scientifc Management (Taylor, 1913), he argued in favor of the con￾stitution of a science of management, whose purpose would be the investigation of 
the principles and laws of human cooperative activities. Only by means of such a 
scientifc approach, he thought, it could be possible to increase the productivity of 
human collective enterprises and thus “to secure the maximum prosperity for the 
employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for each employee” (ibid., p. 1). In 
the absence of such a scientifc approach, productivity could only be entrusted to the 
diverse beliefs and rule-of-thumb routines of the workers.
According to Taylor, it is a manager’s responsibility to scientifcally investigate 
the production process in order to identify the different tasks in which it can be 
divided and determine the most effcient way to perform them. The concept of the 
one best way to perform an operation in the production process is at the core of 
Taylor’s approach. He thought that the empirical analysis of the different ways to 
perform a specifc task could determine the single one that allows performing it with 
the minimal number of motions in the minimal amount of time. His method con￾sisted in measuring the workers’ performance with a stopwatch to establish a base 
parameter, compare each performance with the other, and identify the one best way; 
for instance, he famously tried to determine the right size for a shovel by timing 
workers while they moved a pile of coal with different ones. Taylor aimed for the 
standardization of simple specialized tasks and conceived the organization of the 
productive process as the implementation of such standards. As far as productivity 
is concerned, he believed that standard tasks are more important than the people 
who perform them; individual workers are interchangeable, as long as they are 
appropriately trained.
In this view, organization is the result of the application of a structure elaborated 
by following the Scientifc Management approach. Managers are fully responsible 
for the design of the work tasks and for their enforcement in the production process. 
It follows that they must also have the authority to enforce them. The notion of 
authority in the Scientifc Management approach is particularly interesting from a 
Scientifc Management232
communicative perspective. On the one hand, authority must be univocal and the 
chain of command rigidly hierarchical; managers must make decisions and workers 
have to comply with them. On the other hand, however, managers are not invested 
with authority due to their charisma or other individual qualities of theirs: managers 
must have authority because they are assigned with the task of enforcing a certain 
design of the work process, which is assumed to be objectively correct to the extent 
that it has been scientifcally elaborated and tested. Authority belongs to the func￾tion rather than the person. In principle, therefore, even managers are interchange￾able in their function; besides, as long as the chain of command is univocal, it is 
unnecessary that all the manager’s functions are performed by a single person. 
Specifcally, Taylor thought that authority should be divided into several functions 
performed by different foremen, in order to make enforcing and controlling the 
design of the work process more effcient. This is the so-called management tech￾nique of functional foremanship (Fig. 13.1).
According to Taylor, there are essentially eight functions in which foremanship 
can be partitioned. These functions fall into two kinds: planning and production. 
There are four foremen with a planning function: a route clerk, who designs and 
controls the work fow from one step of production to the next; an instructional card 
clerk, who specifes the one best way in which the different tasks have to be per￾formed; a time clerk, who defnes the appropriate time schedule for the different 
tasks and the correspondent payment for the workers performing them; and a disci￾plinarian, who is the personnel manager responsible for the discipline of the work￾ers. There are also four foremen who perform functions in the production area: a

gang boss, who is responsible for the means of production; a speed boss, who super￾vises the speed of the work; an inspector, who verifes the quality of the production 
and of the products; and a repair boss, who is responsible for maintenance and 
repair. In this way, every worker is supervised by eight foremen.
Notice how this hierarchical structure shapes communication along the lines of 
the authority relations established inside the organization; just like authority runs 
top-down through the chain of command, so communicative relations are only con￾ceived as vertical. There is no need and consequently no role for horizontal com￾munication between workers because coordination is ensured by the management 
plan. Indeed, in the conception of organization provided by Scientifc Management, 
communication itself is only present in the form of orders transmitted from the 
managers and the foremen to the workers. Organization per se has nothing to do 
with communication as it is instead conceived as the enforcement of a structure that 
is developed before any activity has even begun and independently from the rela￾tions workers have with one another.
Henri Fayol
Whereas Taylor’s generative contribution to the classical approach of Scientifc 
Management mainly focused on methods and techniques, Henri Fayol attempted to 
provide a theoretic foundation to the science of management that could be used to 
train managers (Fayol, 1917). According to Fayol, industry consists in six kinds of 
activities: technical activities (production), commercial activities (buying and sell￾ing goods, machinery, products, and services), fnancial activities (searching for and 
using capital), security activities (protecting property and people), accounting activ￾ities (keeping and providing fnancial records), and managerial activities. The latter, 
of course, are what the organizational structure of an industry depends on. 
Managerial activities must perform fve different functions: planning, organizing, 
commanding, coordinating, and controlling. The different industrial activities 
require different knowledge and are carried out in different proportions in different 
jobs; for instance, a worker needs more technical knowledge, while a manager 
needs more managerial knowledge. Fayol, however, noticed that to the contrary of 
other forms of knowledge, no managerial scholarship was available to train manag￾ers to perform their functions. He therefore proposed a systematization of what is 
required to perform these functions into 14 principles of management: division of 
labor, authority, discipline, unity of command, unity of direction, subordination of 
individual interest to general interest, remuneration of personnel, centralization, 
scalar chain, order, equity, stability of tenure, initiative, and esprit de corps.
Some of these principles, such as the subordination of the individual to the gen￾eral interest or the remuneration of personnel, are self-explanatory. Others mirror 
Taylor’s approach; for instance, Fayol acknowledges the importance of the division 
of labor and the need for the authority of managers and the discipline of workers. By 
advancing the principle of order, he also shares the view that what really counts in 
Scientifc Management234
the organization of an industry are roles and functions so that effcient management 
must assign the right tasks to the right people. The principle of unity of direction 
also insists on another idea of Taylor’s, namely that cooperation can only be achieved 
by enforcing organizational structure: for the efforts of the employees involved in 
the same activities to be focused in the same direction, they must be supervised by 
the same manager and organized so as to follow the same plan.
The principles most relevant to our investigation are obviously those which 
shape communicative relations in an industry as an organization. These are the prin￾ciple of the scalar chain and, in particular, the principle of the unity of command. 
The unity of command principle dictates that every subordinate must receive orders 
by one superior only. In this way the chain of command does not overlap and no 
subordinate can be in the position of receiving contradictory orders (Fig. 13.2).
The principle of the scalar chain claims that communication must follow the 
chain of command. Again, communicative relations are defned along the lines of 
the relations of authority: orders must be delivered from the higher levels in the 
hierarchy down to the workers who must execute them, while feedback and reports 
must be issued from the lower levels up to the managers who must make decisions. 
This is what the information communicated in the organization amounts to. Fayol 
underlines the importance of such communication not skipping any step in the chain 
of command or, worse, short-circuiting different chains. Supervisors must give 
orders only to their direct subordinates, and subordinates must report only to their 
direct supervisor, otherwise, orders and reports would risk accumulating for the 
same people and congesting communication channels. Except when explicitly 
authorized by supervisors, subordinates must not communicate directly with one 
another, otherwise they could undertake actions outside of the managers’ plans; 
hence, as illustrated in Fig. 13.3, if D had to communicate with G, the message 
should frst follow the scalar chain up to A and then down to G, to respect the rela￾tions of authority.
Again, in Fayol’s view, organizing consists in authoritatively planning and man￾aging: defning the functions required for a certain business and creating the condi￾tions to do it in the most effcient way for those who will have to perform them. 
Communication in an organization is only vertical, fowing along the chain of com￾mand and only in the form of orders and reports: “The line of authority is the route 
followed – via every link of the chain – by all communications which start from or 
go to the ultimate authority” (ibid., p. 14).

Max Weber
To complete the presentation of the main characters of the Scientifc Management 
approach, Max Weber’s account of bureaucracy is also worth mentioning in this 
brief survey. In contrast to Taylor and Fayol, Weber was not an engineer but a soci￾ologist. He studied organization from an analytic and prescriptive point of view, 
rather than a practical and applicative one. He views bureaucracy as a rational sys￾tem of authority for the administration of modern organizations. Like power, author￾ity is a social relation, but unlike power which is the ability to enforce one’s will 
despite resistance, authority is willingly obeyed by those upon which it is exerted. 
Weber (1947) distinguished among three sorts of authorities: charismatic, tradi￾tional, and rational-legal.
Charismatic authority rests on specifc qualities of individual persons. A charis￾matic leader is followed, rather than merely obeyed, by those who acknowledge and 
value such qualities. This kind of authority is independent from the role of the person 
who exerts it and from a context of rules that could establish it. In this sense, it is not 
structural. Besides, since it is essentially personal, it cannot be transferred to others. 
Thus, Weber notices, organizations governed by charismatic authority may be eff￾cient if the leader indeed possesses good qualities for administration, but they are 
unstable and unable to manage the transition of power from one person to another.
Traditional authority rests on the customs and the traditions of a social group. 
The paradigm for this type of authority are kingdoms, but it can also be identifed in 
family-owned companies. Traditional authority is obeyed by those who share such 
traditions, and does not necessarily have to be established by explicit rules. 
Organizations governed by traditional authority are usually stable, because customs 
usually deal with the transition of authority as well; thus, for instance, the authority 
of the king is passed on to his heirs after his death. These organizations become 
unstable only when the traditions themselves are put into question. The major prob￾lem with this sort of authority, however, is that it does not guarantee an effcient 
administration, since it is independent from the qualities of those who are credited 
with it.
Scientifc Management236
Finally, rational-legal authority is the kind of authority proper to bureaucracy. 
This kind of authority does not pertain to a person but to a role. It rests on the rules 
that establish the tasks, the prerogatives, and the powers of a role in an organization. 
Offcials exert power under this sort of authority only within the scope of their 
offce, and they are obeyed in reason of the acknowledgment of the legality of the 
order that establishes the offce and its authority. In this sense, what is obeyed is not 
really the person but the legal order. In Weber’s view, bureaucratic authority is 
exerted by “a continuous organization of offcial functions bound by rules” (ibid., 
p. 330). Each offce must be assigned with specifc competencies and the means to 
carry out its functions. Offces are organized in a hierarchical order and are imper￾sonal, in the sense that the people who hold them do not own their position nor the 
means of production and administration. Their acts are legitimate in reason of the 
order that establishes their offces and therefore have to be formulated and recorded 
in writing, in order to be accountable to that same order.
According to Weber’s analysis, the rational-legal authority expressed by a 
bureaucracy is clearly the most effcient form of organization. First, it is impersonal, 
in the sense that it belongs to the offce and not to the person who holds it; therefore, 
it poses no problem for the transmission from one offcial to another. Second, it is 
meritocratic because offcials are appointed on the basis of the qualities they are 
required to posses to perform the functions of their offce. Third, rational-legal 
authority is also universal, in the sense that it is objectively determined by universal 
rules which are valid for everyone, and thus it is accountable to anyone.
Just like Taylor and Fayol, Weber thinks of organization in terms of a structure of 
functions and authority relations that could guarantee the effcient coordination of 
its members. The principle of the division of labor is at the basis of the determina￾tion of the functions to be performed in an organization and justifes the impersonal￾ity of the different offces. Communication can be part of an organization, especially 
in the form of the documentation of its activity, but it plays no role in the constitu￾tion of the organization itself, which instead depends on the norms and rules that 
establish bureaucratic authority.
Communication in the Scientifc Management Approach
These classical theories aim to develop a scientifc approach to the study of organi￾zations. They attempt to defne the laws and principles that govern organizational 
phenomena. Under the assumption that underlying processes are regular and con￾texts stable, the idea is that it is possible to defne the objective best ways to do 
things cooperatively. Planning is separated from and precedes execution. 
Organizations are conceived as a result of the application of an organization plan to 
coordinate the activity of a group of people. People are themselves interchangeable 
as far as the execution of a plan is concerned. In this sense, the science of organiza￾tions is supposed to orient managers in the elaboration of such a plan, rather than in 
cooperation itself; the latter should simply be the outcome of an effcient plan. 
13 Classical Theories of Organizations237
Managerial activity should consist in two subsequent tasks. Primarily, it should con￾sist in the defnition of an effcient division of labor in which all the functions 
required for the successful activity of the organization are identifed, characterized 
as a series of tasks to be performed and assigned to the most suitable personnel. 
Secondarily, it should consist in the exercise of the authority required to make the 
personnel to adhere to the plan and carry out the assigned tasks and functions.
Those who follow the Scientifc Management approach deal with communica￾tion in organizations in two different ways. On the one hand, they think of commu￾nication as one of the functions to be performed in the organization. In this sense, 
exchanging information and in general communicating with each other is one of the 
tasks that the members of the organization have to perform. On the other hand, the 
Scientifc Management approach focuses on the structure of communicative rela￾tions within the organization, rather than on communication itself and determines 
such a structure along the lines of the relations of authority.
From this point of view, organizational charts are a useful instrument for the 
planning, analysis, and evaluation of the structural pros and cons of an organization. 
These diagrams show how departments or macro areas with different functions in 
the organization are related with one another. Organizational charts were already 
appreciated, especially by Fayol, because they allow a clear idea of the scalar chains 
of authority at a glance. Today, organizational charts come in different styles, to 
better illustrate different approaches to management. In its most traditional and 
basic form, however, an organizational chart shows the position of each department 
in the chain of command, thus identifying its line function or staff function 
(Fig. 13.4).
Line functions contribute to the main activity of the organization. In an organiza￾tional chart, they are usually connected by vertical lines illustrating relations of 
authority. In Fig.  13.4, the scalar chain of command goes from the CEO to the 
CEO

workers and the salespeople. Staff functions are essentially advisory functions. In 
an organizational chart, they are usually indicated by horizontal lines intersecting 
with the line of command. In Fig. 13.4, the fnancial and legal advisor, together with 
the human resources manager, constitute the CEO’s staff.
The inspection of organizational charts allows the identifcation of the structural 
problems of communication that Fayol was particularly concerned about; for 
instance, one can clearly verify on an organizational chart whether the principle of 
the unity of command is observed or not. But one can also read the span of control, 
that is to say, the number of subordinates a supervisor has. If the span is too high, 
control could be loose and reports could overfll the fow of communication. Another 
evident parameter is the height of the chart, that is, the length of the chain of com￾mand that can be measured by the number of levels of authority from top to bottom. 
In too high a chain of command, orders could not fow through quickly enough. A 
little more diffcult to read on an organizational chart is the load of communication 
channels, namely the volume of information exchanged between different depart￾ments. Overloaded channels of communication could also cause problems in the 
management of an organization.
It is important to realize that the focus on the structural properties of communica￾tion that is typical of the Scientifc Management approach also has several disadvan￾tages. First, by forcing it to follow relations of authority, communication is 
essentially made vertical, formal, and procedural. Horizontal, peer-to-peer commu￾nication is downplayed, if not explicitly discouraged, thus limiting the creativity of 
the organization’s members, hindering their cooperation and diminishing the overall 
quality of their work conditions. Additionally, by focusing on structures, the 
Scientifc Management approach makes organizations more rigid and less able to 
adapt to diffculties and changes: any modifcation of the structure requires an exter￾nal analysis and the planning and enforcing of another structure.
Human Relations
The Human Relations approach shifts the focus from structure to people. Whereas the 
point of view of Scientifc Management sees the effciency of an organization as 
having to do with the properties of an organization plan, the Human Relations per￾spective is concerned with the attitudes, mood and motivations of the people who 
contribute to an organization’s activity.
Elton Mayo
In 1927, a team of social scientists from the Harvard Graduate School of Business 
Administration was called to conduct research in the Western Electric factory of 
Hawthorne, Illinois. The team was directed by Professor Elton Mayo and the leader 
13 Classical Theories of Organizations239
was his assistant Fritz Roethlisberger. The situation at the plant was already known 
to be problematic: even if the organization was state of the art and the workers were 
substantially better off than most of their colleagues in other companies in the US, 
they were dissatisfed and uncooperative. Besides, the plant’s management was fac￾ing a peculiar situation from an organizational point of view. The Western Electric 
technicians had tried to improve productivity by applying the principles of the 
Scientifc Management approach; for instance, they had tested different lighting 
conditions on different groups of workers to determine which were the most eff￾cient. Clearly, the rationale of these experiments did not differ much from Taylor’s 
measurement of the workers’ performances with differently sized shovels: in both 
cases, the aim was to identify the one best way to do the job. Indeed, the technicians 
expected to fnd a proportional correlation between the improvement of the working 
conditions determined by certain parameters and an increase in productivity. What 
they had discovered, however, was surprising: productivity had increased in all 
groups of workers that had been tested.
Mayo and his colleagues concluded that there was only one constant in all the 
changes the technicians had made in the working conditions: the fact that they were 
making such changes and that the workers were aware of it. A correlation was there￾fore hypothesized between the attention given to the workers and the increase in 
their productivity (Mayo, 1933). The identifcation of this phenomenon, later called 
the “Hawthorne Effect”, had a great impact not only on the theory of organization 
but also on social sciences in general. The Hawthorne Effect consists in the fact that 
people aware of being observed tend to change their behavior because of it. In the 
case of the Hawthorne plant, the workers’ behavior had changed positively as far as 
productivity was concerned. By suggesting that a “human factor” could infuence 
productivity, the Hawthorne Effect seemed to falsify the very basis of the Scientifc 
Management approach.
Roethlisberger conducted a series of experiments to establish which were the 
parameters actually affecting working effciency in the factory (Roethlisberger & 
Dickson, 1939). The research team tested physiological parameters, such as less￾ened fatigue resulting from a reduced working hours, economical parameters, such 
as incentives, and psychological parameters, such as higher morale generated by the 
concession of rest pauses which allowed workers to converse with one another and 
concurrently demonstrated the management’s interest in them. Workers were also 
questioned about their opinions and reasons for complaint or satisfaction with 
respect to management. The results of the experiment were interpreted as support￾ing the thesis that psychological facts are decisively more important than others. 
Besides, work performance slightly but constantly increased throughout all the 
experiments, and that again was interpreted as due to the attention given by the 
scientists to the workers who were encouraged to develop team spirit by improving 
the communicative relations among themselves and with the management.
These conclusions were the basis upon which Mayo articulated a general criti￾cism against Scientifc Management and proposed the development of an alternative 
paradigm that could value the quality of human relations above the impersonal 
structure of organization plans. He argued that while Taylor and Fayol’s scientifc 
Human Relations240
method was essential to identify, investigate, and manage the specifc conditions in 
which human beings cooperate with one another in organizations, their approach 
failed to acknowledge the psychological character of such conditions, which are 
crucially determined by the social environment of people working together. It is for 
this reason that productivity can be improved by taking care of the psychological 
needs of workers, encouraging communicative relations at every level of the organi￾zation, and fostering team spirit and a sense of belongingness. In this new paradigm, 
the construction of a socially healthy working environment is what managers should 
aim for.
Douglas McGregor
The human factor, to which the Human Relations approach had given pride of place 
in organizations, presented the challenge of developing managerial strategies that 
could take advantage of it. In this sense, the relations between people’s beliefs and 
their working performances were clearly worth investigating. Douglas McGregor, a 
social psychologist and management professor at MIT, in his research directly 
addressed the question about what motivates people to work. First, in a seminal 
paper (McGregor, 1957) and then more extensively in his infuential book The 
Human Side of Enterprise (McGregor, 1960), he suggested that the organizational 
governance inspired by the principles of Scientifc Management should be under￾stood as the cause rather than the solution of poor work performance and lack of 
motivation often perceived by management.
McGregor synthesized what he singled out as the conventional conception of 
management at the time into a set of propositions, which he simply called 
“Theory X”:
1. Management is responsible for organizing the elements of productive enter￾prise—money, materials, equipment, people—in the interest of economic ends.
2. With respect to people, this is a process of directing their efforts, motivating 
them, controlling their actions, and modifying their behavior to ft the needs of 
the organization.
3. Without this active intervention by management, people would be passive—even 
resistant—to organizational needs. They must therefore be persuaded, rewarded, 
punished, controlled—their activities must be directed. This is management’s 
task—in managing subordinate managers or workers. We often sum it up by say￾ing that management consists of getting things done through other people.
These beliefs characterize the interventive and controlling approach typical of 
Scientifc Management, according to which organization is an effcient structure 
planned and enforced on a sometimes recalcitrant reality, in order to achieve the 
general effciency of an enterprise, possibly at the expense of the particular needs of 
those who work in it. McGregor suggested that in fact this approach refects another 
set of assumptions:
13 Classical Theories of Organizations241
4. The average man is by nature indolent—he works as little as possible.
5. He lacks ambition, dislikes responsibility, prefers to be led.
6. He is inherently self-centered, indifferent to organizational needs.
7. He is by nature resistant to change.
8. He is gullible, not very bright, the ready dupe of the charlatan and the demagogue.
In fact, it is these pessimistic views about human nature that suggest that the work￾ers’ behavior must to be tightly controlled to fulfll organizational needs. In light of 
these views, a manager may opt for coercion or for incentives. In the frst case, the 
workers will be antagonistic toward the hard approach, and in the second they will 
take advantage of the soft one; in both cases, working performances will be poor. 
But is the Theory X correct? Social scientists, MgGregor admits, have duly verifed 
that human behavior in organizations in effect corresponds to the assumptions upon 
which Theory X is grounded. What he takes exception to is the idea that such behav￾ior is intrinsic to human nature. In his view, the sort of behavior that Theory X is 
purported to coerce into organizational structure is actually produced as a conse￾quence of such coercion. Indeed, this situation can be explained in terms of the 
model of a self-fulflling prophecy: managers entertain beliefs about the uncoopera￾tive nature of their workers; therefore, they adopt coercive managerial strategies that 
in fact cause workers to react with, as a reaction, the antagonistic behavior. In this 
way, Theory X will engender a vicious regress, since the behavior of the workers, in 
turn, will confrm the beliefs of the managers. Therefore, the reason why uncoop￾erative behavior is widely observed in industrial organizations is that Theory X is 
widely applied in them.
According to McGregor, however, there is also another reason for doubting the 
correctness of Theory X. In his opinion, this reason can be better highlighted by 
drawing on the classifcation of social needs proposed by Maslow. As you may 
recall from Chap. 9, Maslow’s pyramid is an ordering of needs including, from bot￾tom to top, physiological needs, safety, belonging, esteem, and, fnally, self￾actualization. These needs motivate human behavior hierarchically: lower needs are 
the most essential ones, but once they are satisfed, men necessarily begin to chase 
the higher ones. This also means, however, that satisfed needs no longer motivate 
behavior. Now, the problem with Theory X is that it seems to ignore precisely the 
fact that men also have a complex variety of higher needs. On the one hand, it only 
focuses on the workers’ lower needs by providing them with good wages, produc￾tion incentives, and good working conditions. Yet, of course, once these needs are 
satisfed, they cease to motivate the workers. On the other hand, Theory X provides 
only few opportunities for, or even hinders, the satisfaction of workers’ higher needs 
by reducing their social relations and frustrating their creativity and self￾development. As a result, workers are motivated to antagonize the organizational 
structure that prevents them from satisfying their higher needs. It is for this reason 
that Theory X is ruinous in McGregor’s analysis.
But what is the alternative? Bearing in mind Maslow’s pyramid, it is not diffcult 
to come up with a different set of propositions to better capture those characteristics 
Human Relations242
of human nature that could motivate positive behavior in organizations. McGregor 
calls these proposition “Theory Y”:
1. Management is responsible for organizing the elements of productive enter￾prise—money, materials, equipment, people—in the interest of economic ends.
2. People are not by nature passive or resistant to organizational needs. They have 
become so as a result of experience in organizations.
3. The motivation, the potential for development, the capacity for assuming respon￾sibility, the readiness to direct behavior toward organizational goals are all pres￾ent in people. Management does not put them there. It is a responsibility of 
management to make it possible for people to recognize and develop these 
human characteristics for themselves.
4. The essential task of management is to arrange organizational conditions and 
methods of operation so that people can achieve their own goals best by directing 
their own efforts toward organizational objectives.
The assumptions of Theory Y include the following:
5. The expenditure of physical and mental effort in work is as natural as play and 
rest. The average human being does not inherently dislike work. Depending 
upon controllable conditions, work may be a source of satisfaction and will be 
voluntarily performed.
6. External control and threat of punishment are not the only means for bringing 
about effort toward a company’s goals. Man will exercise self-direction and 
self-control in the pursuit of the objective to which he is committed.
7. Under the conditions of modern industrial life, the intellectual potentialities of 
the average human being are only partially utilized.
8. Commitment to objectives is a function of the awards associated with their 
achievements. The most signifcant aspects of such work (e.g., the satisfaction 
of ego and self-actualization needs) can be direct products of effort directed 
toward organizational objectives.
9. The average human learns under proper conditions not only to accept but even 
to seek responsibility. Avoidance of responsibility, lack of ambition, and empha￾sis on security are general consequences of experience, not inherent human 
characteristics.
10. The capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of imagination, ingenuity, and 
creativity in the solution of organizational problems is widely, not narrowly, 
distributed in the population.
These propositions are self-explanatory. Notice how the sets composing the two 
theories are extremely polarized. Whereas Theory X was all about coercion and 
control, Theory Y relies on self-direction and self-control: managers who follow the 
latter approach promote decentralization and delegate decisions to the workers by 
letting them to plan their activity and encouraging them to assume the responsibil￾ity for it.
It is important to stress that the Manichaean opposition between Theory X and 
Theory Y is not supposed to represent any actual or possible confict in managerial 
13 Classical Theories of Organizations243
practices. McGregor proposes these sets of assumptions as ideal paradigms of two 
different approaches that can be found instantiated in different degrees in existing 
situations: by drawing on different assumptions, managers may adopt different 
styles of leadership depending on the different conditions in which they have to act. 
It is also fair to admit, however, that the paradigmatic character of McGregor’s work 
decisively contributed to its success. In fact, he provided not as much a detailed 
analysis that could be falsifed or a detailed managerial strategy that could fail, as a 
general framework to understand the results of certain managerial practices and 
plan certain interventions.
Rensis Likert
The American social psychologist Rensis Likert is probably most famous for his 
contribution to psychometrics: the Likert scale is still nowadays one of the most 
common tools for the measurement of attitudes in psychological research (Likert, 
1932). As a director of the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan, 
however, he scientifcally studied organizational behavior in order to identify the 
most successful managerial practices. In his famous volume New Patterns of 
Management (Likert, 1961), he tried to synthesize a new effcient system of man￾agement by empirically observing and comparing the practices of successful and 
unsuccessful managers. In particular, he characterized four sorts of management 
systems: exploitative-authoritative, benevolent-authoritative, consultative and 
participative.
In the exploitative-authoritative system, managers do not trust employees, power 
is centralized, decisions are not delegated, and responsibilities are not shared. The 
activities of the employees are strictly controlled, and they themselves are motivated 
by fear through threats and punishments. Communication is only vertical and down￾ward, while human relations are not taken care of. Productivity is extremely low in 
this system.
In the benevolent-authoritative system, managers trust employees to do what 
they are ordered to. Employees are motivated through both punishments and 
rewards. Teamwork is sometimes required of them, so they are at least empow￾ered by the possibility of communicating in groups and making decisions about 
how to solve specifc problems. Responsibilities, however, are never really shared, 
because teamwork is actually controlled by the managers. Indeed, managers not 
only have the last word on essential decisions but also establish the ways in which 
employees are allowed to communicate and take action. Decentralization is lim￾ited or rather ostensible, because power is still essentially centralized, and com￾munication is still mostly vertical and strictly downward. Productivity in this 
system is higher than in the frst one, but the satisfaction of the employees is still 
fairly low.
The consultative system is characterized by the fact that communication 
between managers and employees is both downward and upward. In this system, 
Human Relations244
managers trust their employees on both their abilities and opinions, so they are 
actually consulted before decisions are made. Managers keep control over general 
policies, but employees are empowered by the responsibility of making decisions 
that infuence their work. Since the employees are involved in the decision-making 
process, they are motivated and do not feel the authority of the managers as 
imposed upon them.
The participative system instantiates the principles of the Human Relations 
approach. Managers fully trust their employees, fully involving them in 
decision-making processes. Communication is mostly horizontal. Goals are set
collectively and pursued collaboratively. Since all the members of the organiza￾tion are committed to its goals, performances are also evaluated at all levels of 
the hierarchy. Responsibilities are shared, and employees feel like they belong 
with the organization. Work performance and satisfaction are at the high￾est level.
Supported by his analysis of the experimental data of his research, Likert consid￾ered participative management as the most effective system. He also tried to develop 
an organizational structure that could implement such system. He thought that the 
benefts of participation could be achieved by grouping employees into work units. 
Each work unit should have a relative decisional autonomy but should also take part 
in the more general process of decision-making. In his view, these work units should 
overlap in the direction of the hierarchy in the organization: each unit has a leader 
or supervisor who is both a member of the unit and a member of a higher-ranking 
unit. These individuals with multiple memberships should function as “linking 
pins” between different work units, thus ensuring that the decision-making process 
is actually diffused along the organizational hierarchy so that every member of the 
organization could be involved in it (cf. Fig. 13.5).
In Likert’s model, management is integrated into an organization’s activity, 
rather than concentrated at the top of a hierarchy. Communication is horizontal 
(intra-unit) and vertical (inter-unit) in both downward and upward directions.

13 Classical Theories of Organizations245
Communication in the Human Relations approach
The role of communication is central to the Human Relation approach. In contrast 
to Scientifc Management whose principles privilege control and authority rela￾tions, this approach focuses on the importance of trust and social relations; there￾fore, while in the former, communication essentially consists in the transmission of 
orders and information along the chain of command and mostly in a downward 
direction, in the latter communication takes the form of consultation, discussion, 
and also socialization. In the theory of Scientifc Management, organization is the 
result of a plan that is imposed on employees; therefore, communication may have 
a role either as part of the process of teaching the employees to comply with the plan 
or as a part of the plan itself should the performance of a certain task require it. 
From the point of view of the Human Relations theorist, instead, the informal com￾munication both between employees and between supervisors and subordinates is 
especially important as far as the constitution of an enjoyable working environment 
and a sense of belonging to the organization are concerned.
An example of this sort of informal communication is the so-called organiza￾tional grapevine. People who work together tend to develop social relations and 
establish a network of informal channels of communication regardless of the lines 
of authority. Grapevine communication does not follow organizational rules, runs 
mostly horizontally, and is more widespread at the lower levels of an organization. 
While it is a source of rumors, it can be more effective than formal communication 
in transferring information throughout the organization. Scientifc Management 
considers informal communication as an ineffcient loss of time, as a potential 
source of impediments to the realization of organization plans, and thus, essentially, 
as detrimental to productivity. Conversely, Human Relations appreciates organiza￾tional grapevine to the extent that it contributes to the establishment of positive 
social connections among employees.
Human Relations suggests in fact that a healthy network of informal communi￾cation could be quite benefcial to an organization, and managers should learn how 
to preserve and make good use of it; actually, one of the basic tenets of this approach 
is that employees who are well integrated in the social environment of the organiza￾tion, commit to its general goals as to their own, and feel that they could satisfy their 
needs for self-actualization in such a context will be more productive.
There is one major issue with this approach, however. In fact, while the Human 
Relations approach still aims to improve productivity, organizational studies have 
unequivocally shown that productivity is not always boosted by simply adopting the 
managerial strategies fostered by this approach. How should we interpret this result? 
Was the identifcation of the problems with Scientifc Management mistaken, after 
all? Not really. The problem rather has to do with the general focus of the approach. 
Once it became clear that employees work better in a socially satisfying and person￾ally stimulating environment, Human Relations emphasized the role of informal 
communication to strengthen social bonds, sense of belonging, and motivations. 
Indeed, attention given to these aspects of organizational life may have a great 
Human Relations246
impact on organizational culture (Schein, 2010). Organizational culture consists in 
the values and the vision, the norms and the conventions, the language and the ritu￾als, and the beliefs and the habits guiding and shaping the behavior of the members 
of an organization. As is often put in organizational studies, it is “the way things are 
done around here” (Deal & Kennedy, 1982). Indeed, it is not just what happens at 
the surface of organizational life, but what makes it happen deeply in it. Now, 
although organizational culture may be essential for the productivity of an organiza￾tion, it does not exist in a void, so to speak. It is enacted by people whose actions 
determine the actual functioning of the organization in the context of the structure 
of plans, rules, and procedures with which the organization pursues its goals; there￾fore, if managers focus exclusively on culture and forget to modify structure as well, 
it might be the case that the former fails to be enacted in the latter. Consider Likert’s 
“linking pin” model, for instance, which was intended to provide organizations with 
the appropriate structures to implement the principles of the Human Relations 
approach. While Likert introduces participative teamwork in which members of the 
organization can effectively take part in the decision-making processes, the pyrami￾dal structure of his model still imposes a predominantly vertical orientation of com￾municative fows; this corresponds to the relations of authority and makes it so that 
the decision-making processes to which the employees take part are ultimately led 
by the management.
To see this point more clearly, it may be useful to consider the actual role assigned 
just to communication by Human Relations; in fact, while communication is given 
pride of place in this approach, it is still considered as essentially marginal to the 
organizational process itself. At best, communicative relations are conceived as a 
psychological means to improve productivity, rather than as a constitutive part of 
the very activity of an organization. This is obvious even in McGregor’s infuential 
model. While Theory Y was proposed as an alternative to the dehumanizing organi￾zational structures inspired by the principles of Scientifc Management, the focus on 
the satisfaction of higher human needs that it encouraged was still conceived as a 
way to motivate workers. In this framework, communication is mostly exploited to 
achieve the psychological conditions—a sense of belonging, esteem, and self￾actualization—required for workers to boost their performances.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we presented two classical approaches in the theory of management 
and organization: Scientifc Management and Human Relations. Scientifc 
Management refers to the frst attempts that apply scientifc methods to the study of 
organizations; the latter were conceived as complex mechanisms and their analysis 
aimed at understanding and ameliorating their functioning. Frederick Taylor, for 
instance, considered essential to measure work in order to determine the “one best 
way” to perform a task and optimize productivity; Henri Fayol defned managerial 
13 Classical Theories of Organizations247
activities and appreciated the possibility offered by organizational charts to inspect 
all the parts of an organization and their relations. In this approach, managers are 
supposed to identify all the functions required to perform certain tasks in the most 
productive way and impose their plan on organization members. No individual per 
se is essential to such a plan: only the function that they must perform matters. An 
important contribution to the theory of Scientifc Management was given by Max 
Weber’s account of bureaucracy. Weber acknowledged that the members of a 
bureaucracy exercise a specifc type of authority precisely in reason of the function 
performed by their offce. In Scientifc Management, communication is mainly con￾sidered a function that an organization must perform: it consists in transferring 
information from one another of its parts and members, and the fows of information 
follow authority relations.
The approach of Human Relations criticizes the importance given to impersonal 
organization plans and focuses on the human factor instead. It originates from Elton 
Mayo and Fritz Roethlisberger’s interpretation their experimental results that led to 
the identifcation of the so-called Hawthorne effect, the phenomenon by which peo￾ple modify their behavior as a consequence of the awareness of being observed. 
Human Relations gives pride of place to the analysis of the infuence of psychologi￾cal parameters on productivity. Douglas McGregor explicitly reversed the principles 
of Scientifc Management, the “Theory X”, advocating for a different set of assump￾tions, the “Theory Y”, with which managers could motivate positive behaviors in 
employees. On the same note, Rensis Likert favored participative systems of man￾agement in which employees are trusted and involved in decision-making processes. 
In Human Relations, informal communication is favored as a social practice to 
improve the well-being and sense of belongingness of the members of an 
organization.
Focus Points
• What function does communication perform in the productivity of an 
organization?
• How can the well-being of the members of an organization be improved by com￾municative practices?

13 Classical Theories of Organizations249
Chapter 14
Systems Theory
The approaches of Scientifc Management and Human Relations stand in stark con￾trast with each other. They offer a polarized view of the theory of organizations in 
which it seems that one must choose one side or the other for better or worse, and 
simply espouse its perspective. Several scholars, obviously, have found such a pic￾ture hardly satisfying, especially because there are relevant aspects of organiza￾tional phenomena that truly cannot be dealt with in either approaches; in particular, 
since both Scientifc Management and Human Relations focus on organizations 
internally—the former on structures, the latter on people—they both fail to appreci￾ate the role of the environment in which organizations act and the complex prob￾lems regarding their integration with such an environment.
The work of Joan Woodward was paradigmatic in this sense. She was the chief 
of the Human Relations Unit at South East Essex College and was entrusted with 
the task of conducting a survey on organizational administration in British industry. 
Her fndings denounced the explanatory shortcomings of the main theoretical mod￾els in organization theory at the time (Woodward, 1965). The frms she investigated 
had very different organizations and achieved very different performances, but she 
observed that the same organizational structures and practices could result in sig￾nifcantly different outcomes in different conditions; in particular, she noticed that, 
in the best performing frms, the organizational structures had been adapted to the 
demands imposed by different production technologies: “[c]ommercially successful 
frms seemed to be those in which function and form were complementary” (ibid., 
p. vi). On the one hand, this obviously meant that there is no “one best way” to do a 
job, and, on the other hand, that internal human relations do not solely depend on 
human needs but are also contingent on situational demands; in effect, these are the 
main tenets of the Contingency Theory that originated from Woodward’s research.1

The focus on the specifc relationships that an organization has with its environ￾ment surely offers a fresh and promising point of view in organizational studies. But 
it also raises a serious question: If contingencies are decisive for the proper func￾tioning of organizations and no truly general laws can be formulated to account for 
organizational phenomena, how is a theory of organizations possible in the frst 
place? Contingency Theory tries to answer this question by individuating system￾atic connections between organizational variables, such as the structure of authority 
relations, and environmental variables, such as technology and the feld in which 
organizations operate. One of the basic assumptions of this research program is that 
it is possible to investigate organizations as social systems interacting with their 
environment. The application of the theory of systems to the study of organizations 
foreruns Contingency Theory and is grounded in Parsons’ functionalism. In this 
employment, Systems Theory tries to account for the fact that organizations main￾tain their states of equilibrium with respect to the inconstancy of environmen￾tal inputs.
Contingency Theory has been one of the main research paradigms in organiza￾tion theory, orienting organizational studies in the 1970s and 1980s. As far as the 
analysis of the role of communication in the constitution of organizations is con￾cerned, however, the comprehensive analysis of the integration between an organi￾zation and its environment provided by Systems Theory alone is more interesting 
than the statistical work that has characterized the attempts to individuate correla￾tions between contingent variables in Contingency Theory. It is for this reason that 
this chapter focuses on the former.
Organizations as Systems
A General Theory of Systems
Systems Theory is a broad and interdisciplinary research feld. The approach we are 
concerned with was originally developed by the Austrian biologist Ludwig von 
Bertalanffy. At the University of Vienna in the early 1920s, Bertalanffy was a stu￾dent of Moritz Schlick, the famous Austrian physicist and philosopher, founder, and 
organizer of the Vienna Circle. The latter was a group of scientists and philosophers, 
leading spokesmen of the Logical Neo-Positivism movement, which at the begin￾ning of the last century had an extraordinary infuence on logic, semantics, and the 
philosophy of science.
As a biologist, Bertalanffy began refecting on the notion of system with relation 
to the problem of assessing the epistemological status of the categories that we use 
to explain life. At the end of the nineteenth century—and, as a matter of fact, even 
much later—physics was viewed as a paradigmatic science, a model of epistemo￾logical rigor and scientifc method. Its explanatory power was acknowledged as a 
testament to the success of scientifc enterprise. Scientifc explanation was consid￾ered nowhere as grounded as for physical phenomena. It is for this reason that 
14 Systems Theory251
modern science in its entirety was characterized by a strong reductionist ideal, both 
on the theoretical and on the ontological plan: a science was thought to be rigorous 
as long as its laws and objects could be reduced to those of physics.
But is reductionism reasonable when it comes to the sciences of life? Are organ￾isms reducible to physical objects? Are their properties and behavior explainable by 
physical laws? Bertalanffy thought that these questions had to be answered nega￾tively and therefore that the reductionist approach in biology had to be rejected. 
Biological categories, he argued, are just different from physical ones: living organ￾isms are wholes that cannot be understood simply in function of their parts. He 
proposed that the category of “system” could be used as the basis for a new theoreti￾cal foundation of biology (Bertalanffy, 1932, 1942). Later, he generalized his 
approach to a General System Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968). He envisaged not just an 
anti-reductionist but an openly holistic view of scientifc investigation in which phe￾nomena had to be considered in their complexity, and the behavior of a system’s 
elements had to be understood and explained in terms of their interactions with 
other elements. He thought that such a General System Theory could provide a new 
interdisciplinary scientifc paradigm as an alternative to the traditional mechanistic 
and analytical one.
In a very general sense, Bertalanffy noticed, “[a] system can be defned as a 
complex of interacting elements” (ibid., p.  55). The interaction of the elements 
requires a holistic approach to the study of systems. The parts of a system cannot be 
analyzed independently from one another, because a system is not the mere sum of 
the elements that compose it. The behavior of a single element is infuenced by the 
behavior of other elements. An element plays a role in the functioning of the system 
that can be understood only with respect to the relations it has with other elements. 
Elements interact with one another to pursue a common goal as a system.
The notion of system itself is borrowed from physics. A physical system is sim￾ply the portion of reality that becomes the object of study. Identifying a system is 
drawing a distinction between the system and its environment. Broadly speaking, 
there are two sorts of systems: closed systems and open systems. Closed systems 
have no exchanges of matter with their environments. A closed system is sometimes 
said to be isolated if it does not even exchange energy or information. Consider, for 
instance, a ball moving on a frictionless surface. Clearly, it does not exchange mat￾ter with the environment; besides, the force applied on the ball by the surface coun￾terbalances gravity; therefore, in the absence of friction, no external net force is 
applied on the system. To the contrary, open systems have exchanges of matter, 
energy, and information with the environment. A pot of water boiling on a stove is 
an open system: it exchanges energy with the environment, because the stove heats 
the water and the water releases heat in the air, and it also exchanges matter, because 
water evaporates, turns into gas, and leaves the pot. More interestingly, living organ￾isms are open systems as well: they take food, water, heat, information, and so on 
and release body waste, heat, other information, and so on.
A system has one or more states in which it can be. A state of a system is a math￾ematical description of the system in a certain moment in time which is defned in 
terms of a set of variables or parameters. In the case of the ball, for instance, a state 
Organizations as Systems252
of the system can be defned in terms of the position and velocity of the ball. In 
mechanistic systems, future states can be predicted on the basis of the current state 
variables because the system obeys necessary laws: thus, given the position and the 
velocity of the ball moving on the frictionless surface, it is possible to determine the 
position and the velocity of the ball in the future. Organisms, to the contrary, do not 
obey laws of mechanics; they exhibit a different behavior. Not only do they have 
exchanges with the environment, but they also tend to reach and maintain states of 
equilibrium. In biology, the tendency of organisms to reach and maintain certain 
properties that are stable in time when the external conditions change has been 
described as homeostasis.
2
 Organisms pursue homeostasis by maintaining the fux 
of external exchanges constant in a specifc way. The equilibrium that an organism 
tends to maintain is not static, but dynamic: it produces energy, matter, and informa￾tion and requires energy, matter, and information for it to be preserved. This dynamic 
preserving of equilibrium states has been referred to as “equifnality”. Bertalanffy 
also formulated a law of equifnality: “[i]f a steady state is reached in an open sys￾tem, it is independent of the initial conditions, and determined only by the system 
parameters, i.e., rates of reaction and transport” (ibid., p. 142). To the contrary of 
mechanical processes which exhibit a preordained path and can adapt their behavior 
to changes only if those changes are already expected in their design, organismic 
processes may equally reach the same state, the same “goal”, by exploiting different 
strategies starting from different conditions and following different paths. In an 
open system, steady states are reached because of the self-regulating processes of 
the system independently from the initial conditions.
Organizations and Their Environment
Certainly, organizations can be classifed as systems according to Bertalanffy’s 
original defnition. But what sort of systems are they? Do they function better as 
closed systems or as open ones? Are they mechanistic or organismic? Consider, for 
instance, a factory organized according to the principles of Scientifc Management: 
work is performed in the assembly line and supervised by several clerks responsible 
for the implementation of an organization plan. The elements of the factory interact 
with one another in a mechanical way and follow the course predetermined in the 
organization plan. Such a factory would defnitely be a mechanistic system. An 
organization of this sort limits the exchanges with the environment to a minimum: 
raw materials and semi-fnished products are bought and enter the assembly line, 
fnished products exit and are sold on the market, workers are paid, and machines 
are purchased. All these exchanges must be considered in an organization plan for 
2The notion of homeostasis was later applied directly to organizations (cf. Hannan & 
Freeman, 1989).
14 Systems Theory253
production to function as expected. Ideally, the more the factory could approximate 
a closed system, the better the organization plan would work.
Unquestionably, the more exchanges there are, the harder it is to take them into 
account. Organizations are deeply interrelated with their environments, and they are 
affected by even slight modifcations. The price of semi-fnished products on the 
market might rise, the price of the fnished ones might drop, the cost of living might 
increase, political and social contexts might change, technology might improve, and 
so on. According to the Scientifc Management approach, an ideal organization plan 
should consider any of these possible changes in the environment, but this is 
extremely diffcult. The Human Relations approach does not truly change the view 
on organizations in this regard but enhances the awareness of the enormous range of 
variables that must be managed: the well-being of the employees, their moods, aspi￾rations, engagement, and so on also impact the functioning of production processes. 
Such a degree of control is obviously impossible. In this sense, then, the problem 
with conceiving organizations as mechanistic closed systems is that such systems 
are unable to cope with change.
Contrarily to both Scientifc Management and Human Relations, system theo￾rists suggested that organizations should rather be considered open systems and 
investigated how organizations react and adapt to modifcations in their environ￾ments. In their infuential volume, The Social Psychology of Organizations (1966) 
Daniel Katz and Robert Kahn focused specifcally on the relations between 
the actions performed by an organization operating as a system and the feedback 
that its actions receive from the environment. External feedback orients the action 
of the organization by producing modifcations through the whole system. Katz and 
Kahn described the cycle of input, throughput, and output with which a system 
processes and transforms matter, energy, and information from and to the environ￾ment (cf. Fig. 14.1).

Organizations as Systems254
In their model, an organization takes from the environment the resources that are 
necessary for it to operate and returns to the environment the products of its activity: 
the effects of such a process on the environment, in turn, provide feedback to the 
organization that allows it to adapt and preserve its states of equilibrium by modify￾ing the process itself.
Preserving the system’s equilibrium in the face of external changes requires 
action. In this regard, Katz and Kahn draw a parallel with the notion of entropy in 
physics. Intuitively, entropy is a measure of disorder. It can be conceived as measur￾ing how many different confgurations the elements of a system may assume while 
preserving the state of the system; for instance, the entropy of a pile of sand is quite 
high, because the grains can be rearranged in numerous ways while preserving the 
pile. By contrast, the entropy of a glass is rather low because not many ways exist 
in which the parts can be rearranged while preserving the glass. The notion of 
entropy is deeply intertwined with understanding the relations between a physical 
system and its environment. The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed 
by saying that the internal entropy of a closed system never decreases; indeed, it is 
extremely improbable that the pieces of a shattered glass get back together by them￾selves. This means that closed systems tend toward states of maximum disorder. To 
the contrary, open systems can resist entropy by actively preserving their states of 
equilibrium. This, of course, requires not only exchanging matter and energy with 
the environment but also modifying the system itself. It is in this way, that open 
systems abide by the law of equifnality. According to Katz and Khan, organizations 
exploit the law of equifnality as a principle of self-correction: if negative feedback 
is received, the system reorganizes in order to reach its goal in a different way. “The 
equifnality principle—they notice—simply asserts that there are more ways than 
one of producing a given outcome” (ibid., p.  32): this is in stark opposition to 
Taylor’s principle of the “one best way”, but it is only possible in open systems.
Organizations as Systems of Roles
The application of Systems Theory to the study of organizational phenomena gives 
crucial insight into the complex relations between an organization and its environ￾ment; and yet, at the same time, it makes the constitutive question regarding organi￾zations even more pressing. As mentioned above, Systems Theory originates in the 
feld of biology to explain how organisms preserve themselves by interacting with 
the environment. Organizations, however, are not biological but social systems: 
Thus, what is it that constitutes and preserves them?
Systems, we have said, are not mere compositions of elements. The elements of 
a system are its functional parts: they cannot be understood primarily as indepen￾dent items, but as nodes in the structure determined by the relations they have with 
each other in the functioning of the system. According to Katz and Kahn (1966), as 
far as organizational systems are concerned, such a structure does not consist of 
physical objects but rather of acts. In this sense, an organization is not to be 
14 Systems Theory255
conceived primarily as a collection of people, machines, buildings, and so on. An 
organization exists as long as a collection of acts are coordinated and unifed into a 
structure by the attitudes, beliefs, habits, values, and motivations of the members of 
the organization who perform them. In the absence of this psychological cement, 
the authors argue, the organization collapses (ibid., p. 187).
Organizations, however, tend to last longer than the individual members who 
psychologically cement them. To understand why, it is important to realize that the 
structure of acts and events that compose an organization does not come to light 
abruptly by some act of creation or institution; rather, it is the result of “a process of 
learning the expectations of others, accepting them, and fulflling them” (ibid., 
p. 188). In the context of this process, members who take part in the functioning of 
an organizational system establish relations with one another. These relations defne 
roles in the functioning of an organization which are what is usually referred to as 
“offces”. According to Katz and Kahn, however, offces are characterized not as 
much by a rigid job description as by the process of learning, acknowledging, and 
fulflling expectations in the functioning of the organizational system. Once a role 
is determined, of course, it may become relatively independent from the member 
who has it, so that different people could have it in different times.
Katz and Kahn develop a very simple and clear vocabulary for the analysis of 
roles in organizational systems. To begin with, they identify a person’s role-set as 
the collection of roles with which they have a relation in a system (Fig.  14.2). 
Role behavior consists in the activities that a person is expected to perform and that 
together with those of the other members of a role-set will produce a certain out￾come in the functioning of the system. The actual determination of a role behavior 
is the result of a negotiation between what acts are expected from a person in a role￾set and what they themselves acknowledge as their duty. On the one hand, the other 
members communicate their expectations to infuence a person’s behavior: this is 
the process of role-sending. On the other hand, the person makes up a conception of 
what actions are expected from them, the received role, on the basis not only of role￾sending but also of their perceptions, values, and beliefs. Thus, the role behavior is 
what the person actually does at the end of this process. The process itself can be 
described as a subsystem of the organization, whose output is the performance of a 
role behavior. Obviously, among the effects produced by a role behavior, there is 
also some feedback to the subsystem that will affect the subsequent episodes of role 
sending and determination of the received role. Such a subsystem interacts with the 
overall functioning of an organization and is infuenced by the environment.

The process that produces role behaviors is what essentially constitutes organiza￾tions in Katz and Kahn’s model because it constructs that “psychological cement” 
between the acts of different individuals which consist in regularly fulflled expecta￾tions. Notice how this model is powerful enough to include and explain the main 
principles with which the classical approaches to organization theory accounted for 
the constitution of organizations. On the one hand, Scientifc Management pre￾scribes that roles must be assigned by managers who defne an organization plan; 
indeed, in an organization managed according to the principles of Scientifc 
Management, the only members of an employee’s role-set are their supervisors, and 
everyone must fulfll the expectations of those who occupy a higher position in the 
hierarchical structure of authority. In this type of organization, role-sending consists 
in the communication of orders along the line of authority, and the received role of 
every employee is evaluated along the same authority relations. On the other hand, 
Human Relations guarantees that the most effcient strategy to fulfll the goals of an 
organization is to enhance the motivations of its members by improving the social 
relations between them. As a matter of fact, the better social relations an employee 
has in their role-set, the more likely it is that their received role is aligned with the 
role behavior expected from them.
However, the picture of an organizational system provided by Katz and Kahn 
does not seem to be fully consistent. The problem lies with an ambivalence which is 
inherent in the very notion of organizational role: on the one hand, roles are deter￾mined in function of the relations that elements have in the organizational system; 
on the other hand, they are fulflled by the members of the organization who actu￾ally perform actions in the functioning of the system. Organizations are thus con￾ceived as consisting of a structure of role behaviors, and yet role behaviors are 
nothing but people enacting them. But then, is it the structure of roles or the people 
that really make up an organizational system?
Learning Organizations
The analysis of this sort of cycles of action and feedback which Katz and Kahn 
brought to the attention of managers and organizational scholars makes an impor￾tant contribution toward a better understanding of what organizations are and how 
they operate. Identifying and managing these cycles, however, is not so easy in 
practice because organizations are complex systems whose behavior is hard to ana￾lyze; nonetheless, it is important to understand where this diffculty comes from. 
Broadly speaking, it makes sense to say that the complexity of a phenomenon can 
be of two different kinds (Senge, 1990, p. 71). On the one hand, detail complexity 
depends on the number of variables that must be considered in an analysis of the 
phenomenon. On the other hand, dynamic complexity depends on the fact that the 
phenomenon is determined by cause-effect relations which are not evident, either 
because they are distant in time or because short-term effects are different from 
long-term ones. A sensible strategy for coping with detail complexity is usually to 
14 Systems Theory257
decompose the phenomenon in parts which are easier to deal with and then recom￾pose the analyses of these parts into an analysis of the whole. Nevertheless, this 
approach is unavailable in the analysis of systems which, as we have noticed, cannot 
be understood as compositions of their parts; in fact, the sort of complexity which 
characterizes systems is the dynamic one. To deal with this in the study of organiza￾tions, a different approach has to be envisaged.
The Beer Game
There is a nice simulation game that was developed for didactic purposes in 1960 by 
the MIT Sloan School of Management and which illustrates the problems with feed￾back in system dynamics. Players are assigned a role in the supply chain of a beer 
brand: the brewery, the distributor, the wholesaler, and the retailer. Each player must 
support costs for the inventory and for backorders: the goal is to keep costs at a 
minimum. Every week, the retailer places orders to the wholesaler, who in turn 
places orders to the distributor, who in turn places orders to the brewery, who of 
course produces the beer. Crucially, the beer takes two weeks to be produced, and 
two weeks to be shipped from one link of the chain to the other, with orders taking 
two weeks to be communicated. This means that there is a signifcant delay between 
the moment when a player takes action and the moment when the effects of such 
actions become manifest to them (cf. Fig. 14.3).
During the game, players must cope with a single event: the increase in demand 
for the beer. Demand increases only once and then remains stable on the higher 
value for the rest of the game. Players, however, tend to overreact to the event. The 
problems begin with the retailer. He is the frst to notice the increase in demand and 
places orders for more beer, but soon he fails to keep up with the customers in any 
case because of the delays in the supply chain: to avoid backorders, he asks for 
increasingly more beer. These orders run up through the distribution chain to the 
wholesaler, who tends to react similarly by placing even higher orders to the dis￾tributor, who in turn does the same with the brewery. By the time the brewery has 
increased production, however, the frst beers have been shipped to the retailer, who 
now has too much beer to sell and begins to place increasingly lower orders to avoid 
the cost of the inventory. The wholesaler has the same reaction, followed by the 
distributor and eventually the brewery. In the face of the stable demand from the 
Consumers

customers, the trend of the orders placed by the players usually shows the typical 
“bullwhip effect” (Forrester, 1961) represented in Fig. 14.4.
Evidently, this is not the right way for a system to react to the feedback from the 
environment because it will not lead to equilibrium states. Conceiving organizations 
as open systems that receive feedback from the environment also requires acknowl￾edging that problematic events are themselves effects of previous actions. Acting 
directly against those effects may throw the system further out of balance and 
engender vicious cycles: the more unbalanced the system, the more severe the 
effects. While direct solutions may appear to be effcacious approaches to problem￾atic events, they actually ignore the dynamics of the system in which causes and 
effects could be distant in time.
To successfully operate in an environment, an organization must understand how 
it itself works as an open system and identify the leverage point on which to act in 
order to introduce small changes that will produce signifcant outcomes.
The Fifth Discipline
According to Peter Senge, founder and director of the Center for Organizational 
Learning at MIT Sloan School of Management, the identifcation of the failure to 
cope with situations such as the one simulated in the Beer Game is essentially a lack 
of systems thinking. In his 1990 book, The Fifth Discipline, he suggested that sys￾tems thinking should be considered the last and most important of the disciplines of 
what he called a “learning organization”. The notion of learning organizations refers 
to the learning process of acquiring new theoretical knowledge and practical abili￾ties that organizations experience in their exchanges with the environment. If orga￾nizations are open systems, learning processes cannot be a prerogative of certain 
individuals only, for example the managers: the whole system must engage in 
learning.
Senge illustrates fve disciplines or “component technologies” that contribute to 
the development of a learning organization. A discipline in this sense is conceived 
as a body of theories and practices to be studied and mastered, a “developmental 
path for acquiring certain skills or competences” (Senge, 1990, p.  12). The fve 
disciplines are as follows:
Fig. 14.4 Bullwhip effect
14 Systems Theory259
Personal Mastery. Personal mastery is the process of development and clarifca￾tion of one’s own personal vision. Having a personal vision is not just pursuing 
a goal, but being guided by intrinsic desires and focusing one’s energies on 
what one wants to do. A vision is not something that can be imposed but it can 
be encouraged and instilled. The importance of having a personal vision 
depends on the gap between the vision and the reality as it is. Experiencing this 
gap produces a tension that can however be both creative and emotive: in the 
frst case, it can be positive and foster change; in the second case, conversely, 
it can be negative and hinder change by presenting it as impossible. Systems 
thinking allows the identifcation of the effects of the two types of tensions in 
the processes that make the activity of an organization grow and slow down, 
respectively.
Mental Models. A mental model is a conceptual structure that guides cognitive 
processes of understanding and action. It can be conceived in terms of 
Goffman’s notion of frame. In the context of the activity of a learning orga￾nization, however, mental models risk placing serious limitations on sys￾tems thinking; in fact, if the relation between certain events as causes and 
effects is taken for granted as part of the framework, it will not be ques￾tioned and modified even if required to. Yet, just like cognitive frameworks, 
mental models cannot be done without. The goal of the discipline of mental 
models, then, is to understand how they work and how they can influence 
the activity of the organization for better or for worse.
Shared Vision. A shared vision is a one shared by the members of the organization. 
It consists in the shared values and goals that constitute the basis for collabora￾tion. According to Senge, a shared vision is built by means of dialogue, just like 
mutual cognitive environments are developed through communication.
Team Learning. Team learning allows the members of a team to improve themselves 
and their behavior collectively. People who are excellent at their individual work 
might fail to provide a signifcant contribution to the behavior of a team. As 
Senge puts it, team learning consists in the harmonization and alignment of the 
thoughts and energies of the members of a team. It results from a balance between 
discussion and dialogue. Discussion is a form of communication aimed at pre￾senting and defending one’s own ideas. Dialogue is a form of communication 
aimed instead at developing new ideas, by suspending one’s own commitments 
and engaging in deep listening, which allows the exploration of the mental mod￾els of the other members of the team.
Systems Thinking. Systems thinking is the ability to identify system dynamics in 
complex processes. It is essential to learning organizations because events appear 
to us as distant in space and time, but they are in fact interconnected: they can 
Learning Organizations260
only be truly understood as elements of complex processes. Systems thinking 
allows the understanding of the dynamic complexity of a system as a whole. It 
requires “seeing interrelations rather than linear cause-effect chains, and seeing 
processes of change rather than snapshots” (ibid., p. 73). Systems thinking is the 
ffth discipline because it gathers the others and gives sense to them as a para￾digm for learning organizations.
Systems Archetypes
These fve disciplines encourage the construction of shared information to be used 
as grounds for collaborative solutions to organizational problems. To put it in terms 
of Sperber and Wilson’s analysis of communication, they allow the development of 
mutual cognitive environments in the context of organizational processes. As Senge 
suggests, they permit the recognition and the management of the dynamic complex￾ity characteristic of open systems. In practice, however, the problem was still how 
to jumpstart systems thinking in existing organizations.
Senge thought that the learning processes of organizations would be greatly 
facilitated if organizational theorists could defne specifc systems archetypes suit￾able to train managers in systems dynamics. In his book, Senge uses systems arche￾types extensively to explain the application of the fve disciplines to learning 
organizations. The “language” of systems archetypes was further elaborated by 
Daniel Kim to a considerably complex degree (Kim, 1992, 1994a, 1994b; Kim & 
Anderson, 1998; Kim, 2000). We do not need to present archetypes in such detail 
here; still, it is worth presenting a couple of examples to illustrate the way in which 
Senge analyzes systems dynamics.
The frst archetype to be considered here is a simple reinforcing loop (Fig. 14.5).
A reinforcing loop in a system is a condition whose output produces feedback 
which reinforces the condition itself and thus causes a higher output. Reinforcing 
loops can be both virtuous or vicious, illustrating how even small changes could 
produce big effects. Recognizing reinforcing loops is essential for managing sys￾tems dynamics. We have already encountered this archetype while discussing con￾fict dynamics; indeed, we now see that a self-fulflling prophecy is just a 
paradigmatic case of a reinforcing loop and that various escalation processes are in

fact reinforcing loops, this being precisely the reason why they are hard to hinder. 
Senge takes as an example the arms race during the Cold War: the arming of the US 
threatened the Soviets, driving them to fortify their own army, which in turn threat￾ened the Americans, who consequently needed to strengthen their own, and so on, 
in a vicious cycle.
The second archetype we consider here Senge calls “balancing process with 
delay” (Fig. 14.6). This is a variation of a reinforcing loop in which corrective 
actions are undertaken to fll the gap between the actual conditions and the 
desired ones. What is characteristic of this archetype is that the effects of the cor￾rective actions on the actual conditions are delayed; in other words, the archetype 
represents situations in which the system has to react to delayed feedback. In 
fact, it is the sort of dynamics that players of the Beer Game usually fail to 
notice. When a gap is experienced between the actual and the desired conditions, 
corrective action is undertaken to bring forth the necessary changes; however, if 
one is unaware of the delay interposed between the cause, that is the corrective 
action, and its effect, that is the changes in the actual conditions, one is tempted 
to take measures that are too strong. These actions will cause changes that are too 
extreme, overshooting the target in the other direction and creating another gap 
between the actual conditions and the desired ones, in an endless vicious cycle 
represented by the bullwhip effect.
Reinforcing loops and balancing processes with delay are basic patterns which 
can however be combined to form more complex archetypes in the same way as 
grammar categories; indeed, as it was noticed above, Senge and his scholars devel￾oped these archetypes as expressive resources to teach the fundamentals of systems 
thinking. In general, they are useful to learn how to identify and manage the dynamic 
complexity of the processes in organizational systems. As far as we are concerned, 
the most interesting among these processes are obviously the communicative ones.
Learning Organizations262
Communication in Systems Theory
In Systems Theory, fows of information are conceived as an essential component of 
the functioning of organizations. As a social open system, an organization exchanges 
information with the environment and transforms information in throughtput pro￾cesses. This approach allows for a more comprehensive account of the fows of 
information with respect to both Scientifc Management and Human Relations. The 
former considers orders and internal feedback as the only transfers of information 
that are relevant for the functioning of an organization, running respectively down￾ward and upward along the lines of authoritative relations. The latter insists on the 
importance of informal networks of communication to motivate the individuals, 
rather than for the functioning of the organization itself. Systems Theory focuses 
instead on the role that communication has in the very processes that constitute an 
organization as a social system.
Along these lines, Katz and Kahn affrm that “communication—the exchange of 
information and the transmission of meaning—is the very essence of a social sys￾tem” (Katz & Kahn, 1966, p. 428). Indeed, the negotiation of role behavior within a 
role-set is essentially a communicative process. As it is easy to see, however, the 
problem with their analysis is that it is essentially informed by the code model of 
communication. They focus on how information is transferred in, out, and through 
an organization. The issues they discuss ft squarely into information theory: they 
notice that, to avoid information overload, social systems must be restricted net￾works of communication in which channels are selected and regimented; they 
explain why individuals occupying different positions in a social system have dif￾ferent perceptions of and responses to identical inputs in terms of a difference in the 
codes that they have at their disposal; they investigate the effciency of communica￾tion networks in terms of their shapes and sizes and in general, describe communi￾cation in terms of the direction, capacity, and rate of information fows. As we have 
seen in Part I, this model is fundamentally inadequate to account for human com￾munication and ultimately undermines the possibility of understanding how com￾munication allows for groups of individuals to organize and cooperate in order to 
pursue shared goals.
A different theory of communication is necessary to provide a better analysis of 
organizations. By elaborating on the idea that communication is essential to the 
functioning of a social open system, Senge distilled into his fve disciplines a more 
thorough communicative strategy to manage the constitution of organizations that 
could effciently adapt to the necessities and changes of their environments. His 
strategy aims to develop and nurture a shared, comprehensive framework of motiva￾tions about the purposes to pursue, and beliefs about how to do that effciently in 
14 Systems Theory263
complex situations.3
 Senge’s approach focuses on the role of communication in the 
development of the frame of systems thinking that he considered to be crucial for 
the learning processes of organizations. Our analysis of the communicative pro￾cesses of the constitution of organizations will now proceed by further investigating 
the frames that make organizations possible.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we explored the possibility to think of organizations as open systems 
that aim at states of equilibrium in the exchanges with their environment. There are 
various explanatory advantages to this approach. Systems Theory was originally 
developed for the scientifc analysis of biological phenomena; therefore, it vindi￾cates the metaphor of organizations as organisms. More importantly, it answers the 
questions raised by Contingency Theory about the decisive importance of organiza￾tional and environmental variables over organizational structures and practices.
We saw that Daniel Katz and Robert Kahn describe an organization’s activity as 
cycles of inputs, throughputs, and outputs, the effects of which provide feedback to 
the organization to better adapt to the environment. As it is for organisms, such an 
activity is performed by the entire system: parts are individuated in terms of the 
functional role that they play in the activity of the whole. In an organization, such 
roles are usually referred to as “offces”. In Katz and Khan’s terms, each organiza￾tion member has a role-set determined by their relations with other roles and a role 
behavior that consists in what they are expected to do in their position; such expec￾tations are negotiated with the other members in the activity of the organiza￾tion itself.
Peter Senge argued that systems thinking, that is, the ability to recognize and 
control system dynamics in complex processes, is at the basis of management. To be 
successful, organizations must learn how they function as open systems in their 
environment and identify leverage points on which to act to obtain intended results. 
He also developed a language of system “archetypes” to classify and help noticing 
various patterns of systems dynamics.
We also noticed that there are two important ways in which communication is 
important in the systemic approach to organizations. First, organizations entertain 
internal and external fows of information that must be investigated to understand

their functioning as open systems. Second, communicative practices determine the 
roles that members must perform to contribute to the functioning of an organization 
and, more importantly, the awareness that members have of system dynamics.

Chapter Summary267
Chapter 15
Sensemaking
The application of Systems Theory to the study of organizational phenomena origi￾nally highlighted the complex relations and exchanges that an organization has with 
the environment. The main insight made available by systems thinking is that nei￾ther the structure of an organization nor the social and psychological condition of its 
members can be conceived independently of such relations and exchanges. The 
relations between an organization and its environment, however, are problematic in 
a way that we have not yet explicitly discussed.
Let us begin with a seemingly obvious point. The environment is undeniably 
objective: it is the changing, contingent reality that organizations have to cope with. 
In principle, the more information organizations are able to process, the more they 
should know about reality, the better they should be able to understand their dynam￾ics as those of an open system, and the better they should be able to adapt to their 
environment. And yet, as we already saw in the case of Contingency Theory, infor￾mation by itself might not guarantee effcient organizations if it does not provide a 
unitary picture to grasp, if it does not allow for the establishment of rules to act 
upon, and if it does not make sense.
Under the hypothesis that communication constitutes organizations, this should 
not be surprising. If cognitivist approaches to communication such as Sperber and 
Wilson’s Relevance Theory and Goffmann’s Frame Theory are correct, at least on 
the analysis of the processes of determination of sense and meaning that they pro￾vide, then clearly the way in which organizations understand and manage their envi￾ronment cannot be accounted for only in terms of the information they process, 
regardless of the amount, kind, or quality. This is because in a group of people who 
cooperate to achieve shared goals, information-processing, and decision-making 
involve the interpretation of the environment.
The processes of interpreting and making decisions shape both the organization 
and its environment, which in turn will bring about new interpretations and deci￾sions in the dynamics of their interactions. The result of these processes is not a 
collection of abstract concepts, but a repertoire of assumptions, strategies, tools, and

solutions to successfully cope with problems that have been encountered in the 
pursuit of shared goals. This chapter is devoted to the analysis of the notion of sen￾semaking, introduced by Karl Weick in the theory of organization precisely as an 
account of the way in which the communicative determination of shared meanings 
constitutes organizations.1
Organizing
Karl Weick is probably the author who frst and foremost tried to revolutionize orga￾nizational thinking by forcefully and originally arguing that organizations should 
not be conceived as much in terms of the category of object, as of process. He essen￾tially proposes overriding one of the basic assumptions of Systems Theory and 
acknowledging that there is no presupposed distinction between an organization 
and the environment, in reason of the fact that “[p]eople create their environments 
as those environments create them” (Weick, 1995, p. 34).
Loose Couplings
Open systems are subject to transformation to the extent that they strive to preserve 
their equilibrium states with respect to a continuously changing environment. The 
tighter the elements of a system are related to each other, the less the system will be 
able to modify itself to adapt to external changes. Thus, Weick notices, the organiza￾tions that are more successful in preserving themselves are those whose structure is 
composed of subsystems which are loosely coupled with one another. Such loose 
couplings allow each of the subsystems to continue performing their functions for 
the organization even if the others impede them, malfunction, or even disappear. In 
this sense, loose couplings are not problematic for the organization: on the contrary, 
they are what allows it to persist. If this is true, then the model of a system as an 
object with a structure may not be the right way to look at organizations.
Weick radically maintains that organizations are neither objects nor systems of 
objects. The very title of his seminal volume The Social Psychology of Organizing
(1969) was an explicit and polemic reference to Katz and Kahn’s book published 
three years before. Weick’s point was that to change the way in which organiza￾tional phenomena are conceived, the very language used to talk about them should 
be modifed: managers and researchers should stop talking about organization and 
1The concept of sensemaking elaborated by Weick is deeply rooted in the general framework for 
understanding experience and action originally developed by Classical American Pragmatism. 
Weick himself made explicit his debt in particular to William James and John Dewey (Weick, 
1969, 1995, 2012).
15 Sensemaking269
start talking about organizing. The semantics of names and nominalization convey 
the idea that organizational phenomena have to do with ontologically stable entities, 
which can be identifed in contrast with their environment and whose persistence 
through change must be accounted for. In the analysis of the relations between an 
organization and its environment, the question to be answered seems to be: How can 
organization X change, while still remaining X? Weick thinks instead that such a 
question does not make much sense. In a Heraclitean vein, he argues that organizing 
is a process in constant evolution. What is identifed as an organization is just a 
temporary phase of the process of organizing that can be isolated in the fux and 
considered as an entity only for certain specifc purposes. To resist the temptation to 
hypostatize such entities, names should be substituted with verbs and organization 
talk with organizing talk.
Making Sense of Experience
Weick grounds his analysis of the process of organizing in a general framework for 
the cognitive analysis of experience. In this analysis, he moves from premises that 
are not in fact dissimilar from those acknowledged by Sperber and Wilson in their 
relevantist account of the processing of information by cognitive subjects. Weick 
begins by highlighting the fact that experience is not just the intake of information 
from the environment; information about things in the world is not just given imme￾diately by experience. As a matter of fact, there is no defnite information “out 
there” ready to be “taken in”. Experience is rather a chaotic, formless fux in which 
agents are immersed. There is no ready-made information in this fux, only potential 
information: in order to use such information, agents must make it available by 
selecting, disambiguating, and ordering the fux of experience. As a result, agents 
manage to give sense to the world they experience. Just like, according to Sperber 
and Wilson, the processing of relevant stimuli was the solution for cognitive sub￾jects to cope with the problem of their attentional bottleneck, so sensemaking, 
according to Weick, is the solution for them to cope with the problem of extracting 
information from their fux of experience.
Sensemaking consists in the cognitive and social processes with which agents 
give sense to their experience. It involves constructing a framework in which to 
contextualize and interpret external stimuli. Information can be obtained from 
external stimuli as long as the framework is in place and allows for making sense of 
experience. The need for sensemaking comes to the fore when something does not 
ft the framework, when expectations are disconfrmed, when courses of action are 
interrupted, and when consolidated strategies fail. Experience fows substantially 
unnoticed until something interrupts it. Such an interruption is not only an informa￾tionally but also an emotionally relevant event for a cognitive subject: “[e]motion is 
what happens between the time that an organized sequence is interrupted and the 
time at which the interruption is removed, or a substitute response is found that 
allows the sequence to be completed” (Weick, 1995, p.  46). To cope with such 
Organizing270
troubling events, a new sense must be given to experience. Notice that sensemaking 
is not really a mere interpretation because the latter implies the attribution of mean￾ing to something given, such as a symbol, a text, and a situation, while the former 
also involves the creation of something new, that is meaningful information which 
was not there before to be found and interpreted.
According to Weick, sensemaking and organizing are simply one and the same 
thing. Making sense of experience is organizing the reality and vice versa. He insists 
that this should not be considered a metaphor. In his view, a manager’s task is fnd￾ing their way around problematic situations by constructing a coherent framework 
to reduce uncertainty and allow themselves and other people to successfully cope 
with the problem and continue pursuing their shared goals. In this sense, managerial 
activity is different only in degree but not in essence from the activity of any single 
cognitive subject struggling with the problem of making sense of uncertainty in 
their own fux of experience. Crucially, Weick also insists on the fact that, as far as 
the process of sensemaking is concerned, there is not even a difference between the 
defnition of an organization plan to assign specifc tasks to different employees and 
the development of social relations to improve the quality of a working environment 
and the motivations of the people who work there. In other words, the specifc 
domains of activities, that the approaches of Scientifc Management and Human 
Relations assigned to the managers and that appeared to be in stark opposition, are 
in fact now considered by Weick as species of the more general process of 
sensemaking.
The Need for Sensemaking
As we have seen, the most important idea one has to understand about the notion of 
sensemaking is that environment is not a repository of information to take in and use 
to solve problems, but a fow of experience to shape and use to reduce the uncer￾tainty that hinders action. Reality is devoid of sense if considered independently 
from the meaning that individuals ascribe to it. As Weick puts it, reality is the prod￾uct of sensemaking: “[t]o talk about sensemaking is to talk about reality as an ongo￾ing accomplishment that takes form when people make retrospective sense of the 
situations in which they fnd themselves and their creations” (Weick, 1995, p. 15).
To illustrate the consequences of this idea, Weick recounts a story recorded in a 
poem by Miroslab Holub, Brief Thoughts on Maps:
The young lieutenant of a small Hungarian detachment in the Alps sent a reconnaissance 
unit out onto the icy wasteland.
It began to snow
immediately,
snowed for two days and the unit did not return.
The lieutenant suffered:
he had dispatched
his own people to death.
15 Sensemaking271
But the third day the unit came back.
Where had they been? How had they made their way?
Yes, they said, we considered ourselves
lost and waited for the end. And then one of us
found a map in his pocket. That calmed us down.
We pitched camp, lasted out the snowstorm and then with the map we discovered our 
bearings.
And here we are.
The lieutenant borrowed this remarkable map
and had a good look at it. It was not a map of the Alps but of the Pyrenees.
In Weick’s reading, this story shows how organizing consists in giving sense to 
events, reducing ambiguity to make action possible. The soldiers of the story got 
lost in the Alps and did not know how to fulfll their goal of reconnecting with their 
detachment. What saved them was not the map of the Pyrenees, obviously, but their 
course of action: they decided to interact with the environment, to notice clues, to 
interpret them, to develop strategies based on such interpretations, to evaluate their 
effects, and to repeat the process until they eventually succeeded; indeed, according 
to Weick it is this process of sensemaking that in fact explains why organization 
plans work, when they do.
The Ingredients of Sensemaking
To distill the essence of sensemaking, Weick often uses a quotation from Graham 
Wallas (1926) about a girl who, being told to be sure of her meaning before she 
spoke, said:
How can I know what I think till I see what I say?
Making sense of experience, according to Weick, is a continuous retrospective pro￾cess of selecting information from a thematized environment, developing plausible 
explanations for these data and adapting one’s expectations about reality and one￾self (Weick, 1995, ch. 2).
Enactment
The frst remark to make about the story of the lost Hungarian soldiers is that the 
information the soldiers needed was neither on the map nor in the environment. As 
a matter of fact, no information was to be found anywhere until they began to act: 
they pitched camp and prepared themselves to survive the snowstorm. As Weick 
puts it, there is no such thing as experience until someone does something. The 
environment is not there to be experienced: the environment must be enacted. It is 
important to understand that the enactment is the process of activating the environ￾ment rather than being passively acted upon by it. The environment continuously 
acts upon us in many sorts of ways, producing our chaotic fow of experience. 
The Ingredients of Sensemaking272
Certain processes in the environment cause proximal instantaneous perceptual stim￾ula, such as the sound of a siren in the night; other processes cause effects that will 
have a more long-term, remote infuence on us, such as carbon dioxide emissions 
and trade agreements. All these diverse processes produce egological changes that 
determine variations in the fow of our experience. Such variations are something 
that a subject can notice and focus their attention on. Enactment is the subject taking 
action in order to focus their attention on certain differences in the fow of experience.
Weick suggests that enactment can be conceived as a cognitive bracketing 
(Weick, 1969, p. 153): the act of isolating a portion of experience to examine it. This 
might sound mysterious, but in fact it is something quite familiar. To understand 
what enactment is about, you could try picturing yourself at a party in an extremely 
crowded and noisy room: you are having a conversation with a friend, but you 
barely distinguish what they say; therefore, you focus on the sound of their voice, 
you turn yourself in their direction, possibly you get closer, and even ask them to 
repeat their words. If you succeed, then you can place your attention on what your 
friend is saying to you. Notice that you have modifed the environment in order to 
do so; in fact, your environment is now an enacted one. By insisting on the notion 
of enactment, Weick aims to highlight that information is not merely given in the 
experience of the environment. This means that what we actually perceive is in part 
determined by the result of enactment. As another example, consider a mycologist 
walking in a forest: they will in all likelihood focus on the ground to spot mush￾rooms; maybe they will pull aside the undergrowth to observe one better or raise its 
cap to determine its species. They might not even notice the spiders, the butterfies, 
and the other insects, which an entomologist, instead, taking the mycologist’s same 
steps would rather focus their attention on. The bracketing action might be guided 
by frames, in Goffman’s (1974) sense, which allow one to notice only certain things. 
Quite interestingly, the frames that guide one’s enactment are not always under 
one’s control. Social media, for instance, provide an other-directed, enacted envi￾ronment in which users tend to have a relatively large part of the experience of 
the world.
A second sense in which the notion of enactment can be instantiated is in con￾nection with the amplifcation of a deviation. In this case, enactment is an action that 
amplifes a variation in the fow of experience; indeed, as we have learned to observe 
by applying systems thinking, it often happens that the environment provides rein￾forcing feedback to an agent’s action. If such an amplifying loop is triggered by a 
minor variation, the disturbance might increase in magnitude and effects. Weick’s 
focus here is not on the effects of the amplifying loop on the environment but on the 
very process of sensemaking. Consider, for instance, a large team of people grouped 
together to deliberate over a problem. The task requires the group members to meet 
frequently and to prepare themselves to give their contribution. It might well happen 
that not everyone has enough time to spend on the project and keep pace; therefore, 
some simply stop attending the meetings. At the beginning, it could be just a matter 
of a few people. This is a minor variation but with an interesting consequence: the 
members who keep attending the meetings are those who have more time to study 
the problem. Meeting after meeting, the frame with which the group understands 
15 Sensemaking273
the problem grows in complexity so that fewer and fewer people have time to keep 
pace with the group’s activity. The result of this amplifying loop in enactment is that 
the problem is progressively transformed into a very complex matter on which a 
very high expertise is required for proper deliberation (cf. Weiner, 1976).
Enactment, however, may also properly take the form of a self-fulflling proph￾ecy. This is the third sense of enactment that Weick invites us to consider. As we 
have already seen, a self-fulflling prophecy is a cognitive loop spinning when the 
assumptions of a subject orient their behavior in such a way that the effects of their 
actions end up confrming their original assumptions. A bank run is a fairly illustra￾tive example of a self-fulflling prophecy of the type we have already considered: 
the belief that the bank is insolvent pushes the account holders to withdraw their 
deposits which is actually what makes the bank insolvent in the end. Enactment, 
however, may engender more extreme cases of self-fulflling prophecies. Since 
enactment involves the intervention of a cognitive subject on their fow of experi￾ence, it might well be the case that what is then experienced by the subject are the 
effects of their intervention. We have already discussed how cognitive frames essen￾tially contribute to the determination of the meaning that a subject confers to experi￾ence. The claim here is the even more radical one that, since the assumptions 
contained in frames orient the enactment of an environment on a subject’s part, they 
can ultimately determine the content of their experience that will then confrm the 
frames themselves. In this sense, the very process of interpretation of ostensive 
stimula described by Sperber and Wilson can be conceived as a self-fulflling proph￾ecy engendered by enactment. According to Relevance Theory, in fact, when the 
audience recognizes the informative intention of the speaker in producing a com￾municative stimulus, they assume that the stimulus is, for them, the most relevant 
the speaker could produce. By acting under such an assumption, the audience will 
then proceed to construct contexts in which to derive contextual effects. The con￾struction of the context and the derivation of the contextual effects is what would 
count as the enactment of the speaker’s stimulus in Weick’s sense; yet, of course, 
such an enactment is what will make the speaker’s stimulus actually relevant in 
the end.2
Selection
The second remark to make about the story of the lost Hungarian soldiers is that 
after they enacted their environment they began to make sense of it by identifying 
relations, patterns, and regularities; this is how they found their bearings. They used 
2As a matter of fact, the parallel with Relevance Theory is not fully cogent, because the process of 
maximizing relevance is standardly construed as not being consciously guided by the expectations 
of the audience; however, the comparison helps to highlight the fact that, according to Weick, self￾fulflling prophecies engendered by enactment are common and deeply rooted in our cognitive 
processes.
The Ingredients of Sensemaking274
the map, but obviously the map itself could not provide them with a representation 
of the environment. They managed to orient themselves by imposing an interpreta￾tion on the cues with which they had provided themselves by enacting the 
environment.
Weick refers to the determination of a structure on the enacted environment as 
selection, and characterizes it as the second phase of the process of sensemaking. As 
Weick defnes it: “[s]election is the organizational process that generates answers to 
the question ‘What’s going on here?’” Weick (1969, p. 176). In this sense, it corre￾sponds to the construction of a frame which, as we have seen in Chap. 11, Goffman 
characterized as the structure that allows answering that very same question. Indeed, 
the information made available in the enacted environment is intrinsically equivo￾cal. Consider again the soldiers trying to fnd their bearings and suppose that at a 
certain point they manage to identify a certain peak on the horizon. Now they have 
a landmark, but how should they use it? Are they north or south, east or west of the 
peak? They must decide, impose a spatial relation on the environmental information 
they have, and act accordingly.
It is important to highlight the fact that the sort of indetermination characterizing 
the cues extracted from enacted environments is not to be conceived as the lack of 
complete information. According to Weick, the problem of selection simply cannot 
be solved by acquiring new data. Indeed, enacted environments may often provide 
too much data, which makes selection even more diffcult: the more data there are, 
the more meanings must be given to them. It is important to notice that here Weick 
does not think of the content of enacted environments in terms of information the￾ory. We have already encountered the approach of information theory in Part I. In 
information theory, information is conceived as the reduction of uncertainty. From 
an epistemic point of view, this is a somewhat intuitive idea: if having information 
about something is knowing something about what it is, then having information 
about something is also knowing something about what it is not; trivially, if you 
know that I am 1.72 meters tall, then you know that I am not 50 centimeters tall, that 
I am not 5 meters tall, and so on. If you know my height, your uncertainty about me 
decreases: this is what having information about me consists in. While discussing 
the code model of communication in Part I, however, we also have pointed out that 
this idea of information is insuffcient to account for how meanings are determined 
and communicated by human beings. Any information that could reduce uncer￾tainty in effect is determined in the context of other information which provides a 
frame for the interpretation; for instance, you can obtain information (in the sense 
of information theory) from the knowledge of my height just because you know 
how to measure heights in meters, how to compare measurements, and so on. 
Unquestionably, the fact that information is obtained only with respect to a frame of 
interpretation does not imply that information depends on frames of interpretation 
as well: in Weick’s words, it only means that information is equivocal and requires 
selection.
Selection is a process of decision-making that consists in choosing a frame for 
the interpretation of the environment and using it to constrain future experiences 
and actions. In fact, in Weick’s view, selection is retrospective and recursive. On the 
15 Sensemaking275
one hand, the interpretations produced by selection apply to previously enacted 
environment. On the other hand, interpretations are determined by both patterns 
implicit in enacted environments and by previous interpretations (ibid., p.  175). 
Those selection results that prove to be successful for understanding an action in 
previously enacted environments tend to be reapplied and infuence future enact￾ments. They are adopted as frames and exploited until new equivocalities emerge 
which require new sensemaking. In this sense, the relation between enactment and 
selection has interesting repercussions on the ability of an organization to adapt to 
environmental changes. Generally speaking, it has pros and cons. By removing 
equivocalities, selection establishes those interpretative patterns, practices, and rou￾tines with which an organization tries to cope with the environment to pursue its 
goals. When these patterns, practices, and routines are well established, the organi￾zation must deal with less uncertainty, smoothening the decision-making processes. 
On the other hand, however, well-established frames also tend to make an organiza￾tion miss possible cues of systemic processes in the environment that could affect 
the organization itself: if problematic cues are selected out, the organization is 
deprived of the raw material required to initiate sensemaking processes that could 
allow it to adapt to those processes. As we have seen in Chap. 7, a similar situation 
occurs when new stimula are processed by impoverished and polarized cognitive 
environments: since they do not contain enough information to produce contextual 
effects, only certain stimula can be relevant to them and have a chance to be 
processed.
Retention
For selection to apply retrospectively and recursively to enacted environments, the 
resulting interpretations must somehow be retained for future applications. In this 
sense, retention is the third and last phase of sensemaking. Weick borrows the 
notion from the philosopher William James:
[R]etention means liability to recall, and it means nothing more than such liability. The only 
proof of their being retention is that recall actually takes place. The retention of an experi￾ence is, in short, but another name for the possibility of thinking it again, or the tendency to 
think it again, with its past surroundings. (James, 1890, vol. 1, p. 654)
Nevertheless, Weick is not overly interested in the psychological processes that 
make retention possible; he is much more concerned with the effect that it may 
specifcally have on sensemaking. Just like experience is not to be conceived as tak￾ing a picture of the environment, so retention is not to be conceived as putting a 
picture away in a drawer from which to pull it out in the future; in fact, there is no 
picture to take and no drawer to store it. It is not raw data which are retained but the 
interpretational patterns, practices, and routines resulting from selection; and, cru￾cially, retention alters the results of selection themselves. This happens because 
retentions are processed by previous retentions, meaning that previously retained 
The Ingredients of Sensemaking276
information shapes the way in which new information is retained: previous patterns 
tend to be confrmed and reinforced, discordant ones tend to be assimilated to coher￾ent ones, links tend to be created between them, and so on.
As was the case for enactment and selection, retention too contributes to the 
reduction of uncertainty in the activity of an organization; however, it may also 
contribute to jeopardizing the organization’s ability to adapt to the structural changes 
in the environment. The more impoverished the pool of interpretational and agen￾tive strategies an organization retains, the less able it will be to cope with diverse 
kinds of problems. An organization’s success depends on a delicate balance between 
stability and fexibility. Stability is required to successfully cope with regular con￾tingencies in well-established, retained ways. Flexibility is required to successfully 
cope with environmental changes by developing new strategies to retain; too much 
stability makes the organization vulnerable to change, and too much fexibility 
makes it unable to overcome the uncertainty that may hinder its action. In this sense, 
every time enactment and selection are performed, the problem of deciding whether 
retained information should be used to do that must be solved.
Cause Maps and Stories
What sort of information is produced by selection and retained when successful? 
Recall that organizing is initiated by problematic variances in the fow of experi￾ence. Cognitive processes make sense of environmental changes by individuating 
relevant variables and establishing relations of cause and effect between them. As 
we know from the analysis of Systems Theory (Chap. 14), the determination of 
these relations can be extremely complex: certain causes have delayed effects, cer￾tain causes increase their effects, and certain others decrease them. A cause map is 
a systematic structure representing these variables and their relations: “it summa￾rizes those variables and connections that are inferred by a person after repeated 
exposure to a stream of experience” (Weick, 1969, p. 140). In this sense, cause maps 
describe system dynamics, and Senge’s archetypes can be thought as a vocabulary 
for the development of cause maps. The production of cause maps can be conceived 
in terms of what Senge defnes as the discipline of systems thinking inside learning 
organizations. Indeed, cause maps provide a crucial contribution to the organizing 
process, because they allow making sense of the environment by reducing equivo￾cality. It is important to notice, however, that contrary to Senge’s idea of systems 
thinking as purported to recognize system dynamics, in Weick’s view cause maps 
are produced by the agents in the process of making sense of the environment and 
imposed on it. Organizing does not consist in adapting one’s behavior to the system 
dynamics in which one fnds oneself already embedded but rather in the process of 
establishing cause maps to make sense of the equivocality of enacted environments 
and act upon them.
An interesting example of a cause map may be provided for the process of sen￾semaking itself.

Indeed, sensemaking, or organizing, can be pictured as a recursive process as in 
Fig. 15.1. In the diagram, four processes are depicted: environmental or ecological 
change, enactment, selection, and retention. Processes have an impact on one 
another. The symbols “+” and “−” indicate the sort of effect, direct or inverse, that 
each process has on those with which it is related. Thus, as we have seen, environ￾mental change determines enactment, which in turn may determine environmental 
change in an amplifying cycle. Enactment determines selection, and selection deter￾mines retention. Retention, in turn, impacts both selection and enactment, directly 
or inversely, depending on whether past experience is trusted or disbelieved.
Maps reduce the equivocality of experience and provide the basis upon which to 
take action. In The Psychology of Organizing, Weick originally suggests that they 
could be considered what the sense we make of experience in organizing processes 
consists in; therefore, he argues, cause maps are the organization (ibid., p. 140). He 
later changed his mind about the substance of sensemaking and came to think that 
the notion of a map is not good enough to illustrate what making sense of equivocal 
experience consists in. Somewhat counterintuitively, the problem with maps is that 
they are accurate. The idea that the accuracy of sense is a problem has a ring of para￾dox to it, but in fact it follows directly from a dilemma in the process of sensemak￾ing that is worth highlighting. On the one hand, sensemaking makes experience 
understandable by drawing boundaries and tracing relations between stable, dis￾crete portions of it. On the other hand, fows of experience are intrinsically unitary 
and continuously changing. As Weick puts it, “there remains a chronic disjunction 
between the discrete products of sensemaking and the continuities they map” 
(Weick, 1995, p. 108).
Weick explores several different ways in which to characterize the substance of 
sensemaking: minimal sensible structures composed of a frame, a cue, and a con￾nection (Upton, 1961), ideologies (Trice & Beyer, 1993), cultures (Schein, 2010), 
paradigms (Morgan, 1980), theories of action (Hedberg, 1981), traditions (Shils, 
1981), and stories (Bantz, 1993). All these offer expressive resources to articulate 
sense. Weick, however, insists particularly on the importance of the narrative forms 
of sensemaking. Stories allow making sense of events, because they establish cause￾effect relations and allow the integration of partial information with hypotheses, 
deductions, and context; besides, the practice of telling stories is crucial for retain￾ing sense and building a community in which to share and preserve it: in fact, stories 
are continuously modifed, integrated, and developed every time they are narrated, 
The Ingredients of Sensemaking278
in order to adapt them to the communal need for sense. Compared to other sense￾making expressive resources, stories are less accurate, but they have decisive advan￾tages. Specifcally, they establish and preserve the plausibility of sensemaking:
If accuracy is nice but not necessary in sensemaking, then what is necessary? The answer 
is, something that preserves plausibility and coherence, something that is reasonable and 
memorable, something that embodies past experience and expectations, something that 
resonates with other people, something that can be constructed retrospectively but also can 
be used prospectively, something that captures both feeling and thought, something that 
allows for embellishment to ft current oddities, something that is fun to construct. In short, 
what is necessary in sensemaking is a good story. (Weick, 1995, p. 60)
Sensemaking as a Social Process
One of the major diffculties in understanding the notion of sensemaking has to do 
with the fact that it is easy to misunderstand it as an essentially individualistic pro￾cess: the psychological process of making sense of one’s own private experience. In 
this regard, we are particularly vulnerable to such a misunderstanding along the 
path we are following in this book, because we fnd ourselves approaching Weick’s 
work thinking of the analysis of the processes of meaning determination provided 
by Relevance Theory, which we have been using as a benchmark model in the the￾ory of communication. It is tempting, then, to simply draw a parallel between sen￾semaking and relevance-guided information processing, as if they were both 
accounts of how a cognitive subject individually solves the problem of attributing 
meaning to the stimula received from the environment.
That this is a misunderstanding can easily be highlighted by noticing that sense￾making is essentially a process of expression involving various sorts of vocabular￾ies, which, as we have seen, are deployed in any phase of the process, from enactment 
to selection and retention (Weick, 1995, ch. 5). Thus, although the structures of 
sensemaking are imposed by the single individual on their own experience, the 
expressive resources determining those structures are socially negotiated by the 
actors who deal with the equivocality of experience together. It is sometimes sug￾gested, especially by the Human Relations approach, that collaboration is only pos￾sible when actors share the same beliefs, values, and goals: in other words, when 
they share the same cognitive environment. Weick warns against this idea and 
notices that effcient coordination may also be achieved between actors who not 
only have different cognitive environments but also have notably different experi￾ences. The distinction between mutual knowledge and mutual cognitive environ￾ment that we have drawn in Part I could be useful to grasp this point. As Sperber and 
Wilson argue, having the same cognitive environment is neither suffcient nor nec￾essary to share meanings. It is insuffcient because it must also be manifest to us that 
we have them; it is unnecessary because it may well be manifest to us that we have 
different beliefs and that may well be a mutual cognitive environment wide enough 
for us to communicate successfully.
15 Sensemaking279
In an organization, actors act together as a group, but what makes it possible for 
them to do so is the mutual cognitive environment that they share; indeed, it is the 
social negotiation of sensemaking that makes them act together. As far as the pur￾poses of our investigation are concerned, this is obviously a crucial acknowledg￾ment; but it is not enough because, as we have seen, groups are not yet organizations. 
The question that must be asked next is how exactly the development of a mutual 
cognitive environment can contribute to the constitution of an organization in the 
process of sensemaking. To answer this question, Weick deploys a distinction origi￾nally drawn by Norbert Wiley (1988) between intersubjective and generic subjec￾tive meaning. Both are socially determined, but while intersubjective meaning is the 
dynamic synthesis of different individual perspectives realized by conversation, 
generic subjective meaning is the static structure of roles and rules that gives shape 
to a social body by providing routines and models of action and interpretation.
As Weick notices, an organization lives in the dialectic between intersubjectivity
and generic subjectivity. On the one hand, uncertainty and equivocality continu￾ously require the negotiation of sense at the intersubjective level. On the other hand, 
the results of such negotiation consist in the establishment of frames and proce￾dures, which allow to successfully deal with the environment. The stability of the 
generic subjective meaning is obviously precarious and is always put at risk by 
environmental change so that new intersubjective meanings are required, while the 
negotiation of intersubjective meaning is always dependent on the frames provided 
by the generic subjective one. What is crucial for us to notice is that this sort of 
dialectic which constitutes organization is essentially realized through communica￾tive practices that develop the mutual cognitive environments of the actors.
A Tension in Sensemaking
Weick explicitly suggests that “communication activity is organization” (Weick, 
1995, p. 75), and in his analysis of sensemaking he articulates why it is so: com￾munication allows making sense of the problematic situations with which social 
cooperative activities have to cope. However, his approach also highlights an inter￾esting tension. On the one hand, previously created sense is required to apply well￾established solutions that have proven to be successful in the past. On the other 
hand, the creation of new sense is also required in order to fnd novel solutions for 
the unfamiliar ambiguities that continuously come into view. Clearly, the two 
requirements are incompatible with one another. The more one is committed to 
certain interpretations and certain solutions, the more effciently one will deal with 
previously encountered problems, but the less one will be able to adapt to variations 
and new challenges; vice versa, the more one is engaged in sensemaking, the more 
easily one will adapt to environmental changes, but the less effciently one will deal 
with them.
Sensemaking seems to force upon us a trade-off between effciency and adapt￾ability. Indeed, such a trade-off is yet another facet of a tension that we have been 
A Tension in Sensemaking280
encountering repeatedly in the analysis of the very notion of organization. In a 
sense, in fact, an organization is a process resulting from the coordinated activities 
of its members. In another sense, an organization is an object with a structure that 
functionally articulates its parts. It is easy to see that the tension between process 
and structure troubles Weick’s analysis as well: if organization is just communica￾tion activity, how could a persistent structure emerge from it?
This tension is intrinsic to the communicative characterization of organizations 
and can never truly be released. From a theoretical point of view, however, this ten￾sion allows for the highlighting of the various aspects and degrees in which an 
organization can be treated as an object, and, in particular, as an agent. As we will 
see in the next chapters, all these aspects and degrees can be thought of as grounded 
in communicative processes.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the radical proposal of Karl Weick to think of organiza￾tion in terms of sensemaking, that is, as processes of interpretation and enactment 
of the environment. As we saw, Weick began his refection with a criticism of the 
systems approach. He argued that the success with which open systems fnd equilib￾ria in their environment does not depend on a structure in which each part contrib￾utes to the functioning of the whole but, to the contrary, on the loose couplings that 
connect these subsystem with one another and allow them to continue performing 
even when things change and expectations are subverted.
In opposition to Katz and Khan, he suggested that organizational phenomena 
should be studied as processes of organizing rather than social objects. He also 
rejected the idea of a methodological or even ontological distinction between a sys￾tem and its environment. Weick insists that the environment exists only if it is 
enacted by the system: from a cognitive point of view, the notion of an environment 
external to the system is the result of a certain action of the system itself that pro￾duces a salient variation in the fux of its experience. Enacted environments do not 
provide information by themselves: such information is selected by developing 
interpretational frames to make sense of the experience that has become salient. 
Finally, these frames are used to act and, if successful, are retained until expecta￾tions are subverted again and a new process of sensemaking is required.
At frst, Weick made explicit that the results of the processes of sensemaking are 
cause maps that resemble Senge’s systems archetypes. Later, he also considered 
other kinds of expressive resources, such as stories: these are less accurate, but def￾nitely more effcacious in establishing the plausibility of senses. It is important to 
acknowledge that in Weick’s view, sensemaking in organizations is an intrinsically 
social process in which senses are negotiated by the organization members. 
Successful frames are retained and implicitly applied in routinary performances, but 
15 Sensemaking281
when things change and these senses do not work anymore, communicative prac￾tices are required to develop new ones: this is why Weick says that sensemaking is
communication.
In our concluding remarks, we noticed that the sensemaking approach highlights 
a tension in the analysis of organizational phenomena. On the one hand, organiza￾tion is a practice and a process, by means of which certain complex tasks are per￾formed and certain challenges are met. On the other hand, however, an organization 
is the social object that results from those practices and processes. Weick, however, 
insists only on the former and describes organizing as a process of making sense of 
experience.

Emergent Organizations
A major contribution to understanding the tension between structure and process in 
the communicative characterization of organizations has been provided by Taylor 
and Van Every’s infuential volume Emergent Organizations (2000). Like Weick, 
they too move from the assumption that “the study of organization is in fact the 
study of communication” (ibid., p. xi), but they then proceed to discuss exactly how 
the former emerges from the latter.
The Notion of Emergence
In philosophy, emergence is a technical concept that fnds its application in the 
analysis of certain ontological issues. Generally speaking, the latter are problems 
regarding the ontological status of a piece of the furniture of the world: What sort of 
thing is it? Does it exist? What sort of properties do apply to it? How is it related to 
other things? and so on. Philosophers discuss ontological issues constantly, and it is 
not diffcult to understand where such puzzles originate from. In fact, we fnd our￾selves referring to all sorts of things in the ordinary language. Some of them are the 
familiar, material objects of our everyday lives: just like the Walrus of Lewis 
Carroll’s poem, we talk of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings. 
Yet, others are not. Some of the things we talk about do not exist, such as Pegasus 
and Santa Claus. Some are just postulated to exist, such as the micro-entities of 
physical theories—although these, sometimes, come to be observed later, in that 
complicated and theory-laden sense of observation is available only to scientists and 
experts, according to which, for example, a certain event that happened in a 27 km 
ring of superconductive magnets and registered by a building-size machine is an 
observation of a certain particle. All in all, many of the things we ordinarily refer to 
are just ontologically problematic, in the sense that we are not sure whether they do

really exist or are merely ways we use to talk about and explain certain phenomena. 
As noticed at the beginning of this part, organizations are precisely a case in point.
Now, the question of course is how to treat these ontologically problematic enti￾ties to which we sometimes refer. Philosophers have devised and tried to justify 
various approaches which might appear more plausible or less plausible in different 
cases. Thus, one could be a realist about some of these entities and believe that they 
simply exist: this is the common and healthy attitude that we have, for example, 
toward atoms or persons. On the other hand, one could believe that some of the 
things we talk about, such as the Pegasus mentioned above, are mere fctitious enti￾ties. Of some others, one could often prefer to say that they exist only in a provi￾sional sense, but that they are actually reducible to something else: for example, we 
would probably accept to say that a table is nothing more than the molecules com￾posing it. Some cases, however, could be less straightforward to assess. Consider a 
swarm of bees, for instance. On the one hand, we may have the intuition that a 
swarm is nothing more than the bees composing it. On the other hand, however, the 
swarm exhibits behavior and properties that cannot be simply reduced or even 
explained on the basis of those of the single bees: a swarm grows, reproduces, dies, 
and so on. Indeed, one could be willing to say that the swarm, as a collective indi￾vidual, “emerges” from the bees. Generally speaking, whenever a system reaches a 
level of complexity in which it begins to exhibit properties that cannot be explained 
in terms of the properties of its parts, the properties of the system could be said to 
emerge from the latter.
Emergentism About Mental Episodes
Mental episodes are a very well-known example of ontologically problematic yet 
explanatorily useful kind of entities, for which an emergentist account has been put 
forward and thoroughly discussed in philosophy. This discussion is particularly rel￾evant to our study, because Taylor and Van Every draw an interesting analogy 
between the emergentist analysis of minds and the emergentist analysis of organiza￾tions. To understand such an analogy, it is worth dwelling on mental episodes a little 
more here. To begin with, notice that as ordinary speakers, we are well acquainted 
with talking about our thoughts, desires, feelings, pains, and so on. Even so, phi￾losophers stumble upon questions such as the following: When I have a thought, 
what is it that really happens to me? Is there an object to which I am related? If so, 
what kind of object is it? What sort of relation do I have with it? and so on. Indeed, 
mental episodes are as ontologically puzzling entities as any from a philosophical 
point of view. In spite of this, mental episodes are not easily dismissed because they 
play a signifcant role in the way in which we make sense of ourselves as rational 
cognitive subjects; in fact, we use mental episodes to explain our experience of the 
world, our behavior, and our motivations. We say, for instance, that Jane sees the 
green tree over there because she has a perception of it, we say that Mary drank the 
gin because she had a thirsty feeling and also the thought that it was water, and we 
16 Emergent Organizations285
say that John pushed Bob with the intention to harm him and so he is responsible for 
breaking his leg.
In this book, we too have extensively exploited the explanatory framework of 
mental episodes each time we have talked about mental representations. We have 
adopted such a framework without in actual fact questioning it, but were we really 
entitled to? There are indeed several answers that can be provided to the ontological 
doubts about mental episodes raised by philosophers. As a frst option, one might 
try to bite the bullet and accept the existence of mental episodes as just another sort 
of entities, besides physical ones. The problem with this dualism is that mental enti￾ties do not ft very well into the best image of the world that we have: the image 
provided by modern sciences. Physics and biology, for instance, tell us that there are 
forces, particles, tissues, and organs in the world, but no thoughts or feelings. The 
more scientifcally oriented philosophers might thus want to consider a second 
option: rejecting mental episodes completely and trying to reduce their occurrences 
to physical ones. For example, one might want to argue that when Mary is said to 
have a thought, there is no mental entity that she has in actual fact: what happens is, 
say, that a certain electrical potential arises in her cerebral cortex, and nothing more. 
Unfortunately, not even this sort of reductionism is fully convincing per se. In this 
case, the problem is that physical episodes do not (at least not yet) explain every￾thing that we account for in terms of the framework of mental episodes. A third, 
somehow craftier, option is to argue that while there are in fact only physical enti￾ties, these can also have mental properties that are emergent from their physical 
ones. Thus, for instance, while I am actually nothing but a complex physical entity, 
that can have physical episodes like a certain electrical potential in his cerebral cor￾tex, the complex physical entity that I am can also, in its functioning, have some 
mental episodes such as a certain thought. In this approach, mental episodes cannot 
be reduced or even explained only in terms of the physical ones: the former are said 
to emerge from the latter. At the same time, these emergent mental episodes are not 
merely idle, but may have certain causal powers with respect to other mental or even 
physical episodes. Suppose, for instance, that I have an itchy feeling on my nose (a 
mental episode): such a feeling may bring forward the thought of raising my hand 
to scratch it (another mental episode), and that, in turn, may cause the raising of my 
arm (a physical episode). 1
But how could mental properties emerge from merely physical ones in this 
sense? The most basic intuition supporting the emergentist approach is that wholes 
or complexes may have properties that neither parts have nor can be accounted for 
only in terms of the way in which the parts are put together. To sharpen this intuition 
a little, let us consider some properties of wholes that are not emergent. First, 
consider as an example fve rocks weighing one kilo each: the pile of those rocks 
weighs fve kilos, but that is not an emergent property of the pile. In effect, there is 
one and only one property, the property of having a determinate weight that both the 
1There are several problems with the emergentist approach as well (cf. Kim, 2005). These prob￾lems, however, are quite beyond the purposes of the present analysis; therefore, they will not be 
discussed here.
Emergentism About Mental Episodes286
rocks and the pile have, and such that the way in which the latter has it depends on 
the way the former have it. Next, consider a wooden ladder: none of the pieces of 
wood composing the ladder is a ladder by itself, but “being a ladder” is not an emer￾gent property of the ladder because being a ladder is just for the wooden pieces to 
be arranged in a certain way. Let us now consider an emergent property or at least a 
property that has often been considered as an emergent one in the past: the property 
of being alive. An organism, it has been argued, is alive in a sense in which none of 
its parts is by itself, and which cannot be explained solely in terms of the composi￾tion of its parts. The idea of treating “being alive” as an emergent property is to 
conceive life as resulting from but not reducible to the functioning of the parts of an 
organism. As a matter of fact, this has become increasingly controversial due to the 
development of biochemistry; notice, however, that the claim that life can, in prin￾ciple, be accounted for in terms of biochemical properties coincides with the denial 
that “being alive” is an emergent property.
The claim that mental episodes are emergent from physical ones, then, is the 
claim that the functioning of physical systems may endow them with mental states. 
For instance, the emergentist philosophers agree that our neural systems are the 
only things that really exist, but they also maintain that the functioning of such sys￾tems enables us with mental episodes that cannot be reduced to their physical ones. 
The emergentist claim concerning mental episodes has a very important conse￾quence worth noting here. As we have often noticed, in fact, mental episodes are 
intrinsically characterized by having content: having a mental episode involves hav￾ing a mental representation. Treating mental episodes as emergent from physical 
ones therefore means conceiving our mental representations as roughly resulting 
from the functioning of our neural systems.
We now have all the elements for understanding the analogy between the emer￾gence of mental episodes and the emergence of organizations.
A Powerful Analogy
Taylor and Van Every (2000, ch. 6) explore the possibility that, just like mental 
episodes could be conceived as emergent from the physical processes of neural 
systems, so organizations could be conceived as emergent from the communicative 
processes of cooperative agents. A very insightful strategy that they adopt to inves￾tigate this analogy consists in using Artifcial Intelligence (AI) 2
 as a model for 
understanding the emergence of cognitive abilities from the functioning of merely 
physical systems.
2The research in Artifcial Intelligence aims to build artifacts that are able to think and act intelli￾gently in the same sense in which humans do. Philosophers usually distinguish between a strong
and a weak reading of this goal. In the strong reading, the purpose of AI is to build artifcial per￾sons, with all their cognitive abilities. In the weak reading, the purpose is to build artifacts that 
could imitate actual persons in the performance of their cognitive abilities.
16 Emergent Organizations287
The idea of conceiving organizations in terms of computational systems is not a 
novel one: it traces back to James G. March and Herbert A. Simon’s 1958 path￾breaking book Organizations. In contrast to the standard picture fostered by the 
theory of Scientifc Management, these authors proposed thinking about the 
employees of an organization not as gears in a mechanism but as routines in a com￾puter device. March and Simon argued that while employees are better acknowl￾edged as thinking beings, the rationality of each single one of them is inevitably 
bounded by the limited information that they have about the situations in which they 
operate and by the perspectival interpretation that they inevitably give of it. What 
makes their actions fully rational in an organization is the fact that they react to situ￾ations by applying performance programs, which have been specifcally defned to 
respond to those situations correctly. In this sense, while an organization is a system 
that processes environmental information, makes decisions, and performs actions, 
employees individually do none of that: they simply compute performance programs.
When March and Simon talk about programs, they have in mind the algorithms 
that govern the behavior of a computer. Back in the 1950s, at the verge of the com￾putational era, anyone who knew the meaning of the word “computer” was thereby 
familiar with the notion of algorithm. Today, computers are incomparably more 
pervasive in our society, but the vast majority of us can use such devices without 
programming them. In a very basic sense, an algorithm is simply a series of instruc￾tions that can and must be executed one after the other. They must obviously be 
codifed so that the computer can process and execute them: that is the purpose of 
programming languages, but, in principle, the same instructions can be expressed in 
natural language. For instance, Fig. 16.1 represents an algorithm for performing the 
addition of two natural numbers x and y.
The rationale of this algorithm is easy to understand simply by inspecting it: to 
sum y to x, you want to recursively perform z times the successor operation on x, 
until z is equal to y. Once the algorithm is understood, there will be no doubt about 
Let z = nd store it in memory.
If y = z, the output is x. Stop.
Otherwise continue.

what a computer is doing while performing it, even if the computer is a machine. In 
our case, it will sum x and y. This possibility is granted by the fact that what the 
computer does is merely to follow the instructions of the algorithm that are explic￾itly expressed in language and thus, crucially, interpreted. In these conditions, such 
a possibility is guaranteed in principle even if the algorithm is codifed and is much 
more complex than the one in our example, so that it takes some expertise to under￾stand it.
The idea of a mechanical computation of algorithms is the basis of the work of 
Alan Turing which gave birth to the very concept of a computer and the theory of 
computation (Turing, 1936). It is essentially the very same idea that still enables 
most of the functioning of today’s computers. It is also the idea that March and 
Simon used to model the rationality of an organization in terms of the application of 
performance programs on the part of its members. What March and Simon suggest 
is that an organization is a complex system of employees performing routines, just 
like a computer is a complex system of chips performing routines. The latter, just 
like the former, are capable of rational behavior to the extent that they are pro￾grammed to exhibit it. Like computers, organizations do something in a sense that 
is not reducible to their parts and the way in which they are connected. In fact, the 
meaning of what they do depends on the meaning of the instructions that the pro￾grammer has defned. Thus, it is only because you understand the program in 
Fig. 16.1 that you know that a machine computing it is summing x and y. Similarly, 
it is only because you understand an organization plan that you know what an orga￾nization implementing it is doing.
It is easy to see that along these lines our analogy would easily lead us back to 
the principles of Scientifc Management. It is not even diffcult to understand why: 
the model of communication adopted to account for how a computer—or, by the 
same token, an organization—comes to process information and performs tasks is 
the code model. The idea is that the instructions to be performed are codifed and 
transferred to the emergent device which decodifes and executes them. Remarkably, 
however, the idea of a mechanical computation of algorithms turns out to be prob￾lematic for the very purposes of AI itself. In particular, it shows some limitations 
when we attempt to make a computer perform cognitive tasks that require process￾ing of contextual information and selecting the relevant one for the task at hand. It 
is again easy to see why. In fact, for a computer to operate effciently in the presence 
of contextual information, the algorithms that govern its behavior must tell it how to 
select and use the relevant information case by case. And yet, explicitly considering 
all possible cases beforehand could be almost impossible, at least if the context is 
not controlled. Ultimately, the problem of handling contexts has put a serious end to 
the frst wave of AI research. It is worth noticing again that, conversely, humans are 
excellent at selecting and using relevant contextual information. One might even 
attempt to conclude from this that the mechanical computation of algorithms does 
not really seem to be the best model for the functioning of human cognitive devices. 
Fortunately, some effective alternatives have already been provided in the develop￾ment of AI.
16 Emergent Organizations289
Neural Networks
When Alan Turing (1950) devised his famous test for answering the question “Can 
a machine think?”, he reckoned that communication is so characteristic of human 
rationality that a machine that could not be distinguished from a human being in 
conversation should be considered as intelligent. 3
 Turing famously predicted that 
by the end of the twentieth century programmed computers that would have 30 
percent chance of winning a fve-minute long imitation game could be built. He 
thought, however, that the decisive factor would be the increase in the machines’ 
memory, that is to say, in their ability to store information. Clearly, Turing was not 
wrong: the growth of memory and computational power has been defnitely crucial 
for the development of AI. Nonetheless, as it was suggested above, more and more 
advances in the feld have been strengthening the conviction that limitations are also 
to be found in the theoretical approach to algorithms itself, more specifcally in the 
assumption that computers must process explicit symbolic information.
Regardless of whether the Turing Test is to be considered a sensible standard for 
artifcial intelligence and whether programmed computers will ever be able to pass 
it, in the frst two decades of the twenty-frst century the most interesting examples 
of artifcial intelligent behavior have clearly been exhibited by machines developed 
with different assumptions. These assumptions are usually brought together under 
the label of Connectionism: “the view that intelligence consists not in symbolic 
processing, but rather non-symbolic processing at least somewhat like what we fnd 
in the brain” (Bringsjord & Govindarajulu, 2019). Although the machines based 
upon connectionist assumptions are supporting the growth of AI today, the ground￾ing idea for their architecture traces back to a 1943 paper of Warren McCulloch and 
Walter Pitts, in which they described the structure and functioning of an artifcial 
neuron (Fig. 16.2).
Like their biological counterparts, artifcial neurons have inputs a1, … , an, cor￾responding to the dendrites, each of which is characterized by a weight w1, … , wn
that biases the information received through that input. Each neuron is characterized 
3More precisely, the scenario of the test envisaged by Turing is the following. A woman and a 
computer are isolated in two different rooms. Remotely, a human judge asks questions of the two. 
The machine passes the Turing Test if the judge cannot distinguish it from the woman on the basis 
of their answers. In this sense, the Turing Test is the paradigm of the weak reading of the goal of AI.

by an activation function f. When a neuron is activated, it applies f to calculate its 
output ŷ based on the weighted inputs that it receives, again, just like biological 
neurons fre on their axons. Artifcial neurons can be connected with one another, so 
as to become the nodes of multilayered artifcial neural nets (Fig. 16.3).
Notice that the output of a neural network essentially depends not only on the 
activation functions of the neurons but also on the weights of their connections. 
Indeed, by varying the weights it is possible to vary the output of the net. This 
means that, by appropriately correcting the bias weights of the nodes, it is possible 
to teach a neural net to give certain outputs for certain inputs. Roughly stated, the 
training process of a neural network is the following one. First, weights are set ran￾domly and the output of the net is computed for certain given inputs. If the output 
differs from the intended ones, weights are automatically adjusted to increase the 
probability of obtaining the correct output. The process is repeated until the outputs 
are (mostly) correct. Pruned of the technical details, this is the basic idea that Frank 
Rosenblatt applied to train his Perceptron, a single-layered neural network that 
proved to be able to recognize certain optical patterns in the inputs impinging on a 
projection area (Rosenblatt, 1958). Unfortunately, notwithstanding the animated 
discussions that they ignited at the time, the substantial results of these frst experi￾ments were too meager to really launch a research feld. Things began to change in 
the 1980s when new, more complex multilayered networks were studied and the 
technology was developed to effectively train and use them. In the last 20 years in 
particular, the development of machine learning has increased dramatically, making 
Connectionism the most prominent, if not promising, approach in AI.
Neural networks allow us to refne in a very important sense the analogy between 
the emergence of intelligence from computational processes and the emergence of 
organization from communicative processes. Programmed computers show intelli￾gent behavior because they compute algorithms purposefully written for the machine 
to perform a certain task. The machine acts intelligently to the extent that it

computes the algorithm, even if it cannot write its own program autonomously. 
Notice that this is the sense in which, according to March and Simon, individuals 
overcome their bounded rationality when they follow the routines learned as mem￾bers of an organization. The most striking difference between neural networks and 
programmed computers, however, is that neural nets do not perform their tasks by 
computing algorithms that codify instructions to perform those tasks. This is clearly 
the core of the connectionist approach. Neural nets perform their tasks because they 
have been trained to do so. While an expert can read an algorithm and understand 
what task the machine computing it is intended to perform, no external observer can 
tell what the task of a neural net is simply by looking at its nodes, because they do 
not codify any instruction. And yet, neural nets are credited with the ability to per￾form tasks considered intelligent, such as recognizing shapes and calibrating mech￾anisms. Humans are standardly construed as performing such intelligent tasks 
intelligently, that is to say, in virtue of having mental representations and acting 
upon them. It could therefore be argued that either our standard explanation of 
intentional actions is completely wrong or something akin to mental representations 
must be credited to neural networks as well. Notice that the adoption of the latter 
option requires dropping the assumption, typical of the code model, that informa￾tion must be codifed to be communicated and processed. If neural networks process 
information, that behavior emerges from the functioning of their nodes.
Now our analogy becomes even more inspiring: just like in a neural network, 
information is distributed in the way in which nodes are related with one another, so 
in an organization information is distributed in the way in which members commu￾nicate to one another. In both cases, the processing of information would emerge 
from the functioning of the parts of the system.
Upshots of the Computational Analogy
Before proceeding any further, it is important to pause and refect on what in fact has 
been established in this chapter and what has not. Let us start by reviewing the path 
we have followed. We began with a problem for the CCO thesis, a problem that had 
been highlighted by our analysis of Weick’s approach: If organizational processes 
are communicative processes, how could an organization also be an object? The 
notion of emergence allows a straightforward, positive answer to this question: an 
organization could be thought as emerging from the complex communicative activi￾ties of its members. By way of discussing this answer, we have explored the analogy 
between the computational theory of minds and the computational theory of organi￾zations. This was our path. Now, let us consider what we have learned by following it.
First, we have not established that neural networks are minds. At best, we have 
been confronted with a conditional: if a rational agent is understood as having men￾tal representation and if a neural network is understood as performing intelligent 
tasks, then a neural network too is to be understood as having mental representa￾tions. Notice, however, that there are two big “ifs” in this claim, expressing very 
problematic conditions. Indeed, there are two main ways to resist the conclusion 
Upshots of the Computational Analogy292
that neural networks have mental representations. On the one hand, one could take 
the intelligent behavior of neural networks to show precisely that rational agents do 
not have mental representations. On the other hand, one could adhere instead to the 
standard understanding of rational agency and refuse to acknowledge that neural 
networks actually perform intelligent tasks intelligently. The frst option is interest￾ing, but it is also rather farfetched; after all, the computational model of the mind 
could just be wrong. The hypothesis that mental processes are computational pro￾cesses has unquestionably provided impressive advances in the AI program of simu￾lating intelligent tasks, and, yet, it is just a hypothesis: no one really knows whether 
consciousness actually is a computational process, as opposed, for instance, to a 
physical one. In comparison, the second option seems to be a reasonable fallback, 
and, indeed, it roughly represents the position of the majority of AI researchers who 
construe the results of neural network as a statistical simulation of very specifc 
cognitive tasks.
Second, we have not even established that organizations are minds. In addition to 
what has just been said about neural networks, it must also be acknowledged that 
organizations are systems whose parts are persons who are themselves rational 
agents. Certainly, at times in the past, the effciency of certain sorts of organizations 
has been conceived as depending on the possibility of making individuals function 
like gears in a mechanism—for example, soldiers in an army and workers at the 
assembly line. Yet, such approaches have failed precisely to the extent that they have 
not acknowledged the role of cognitive subjects in the performance of the tasks of 
an organization. What must be acknowledged, in any case, is that organizations, as 
opposed to cognitive subjects, have no mental representations upon which to act.
On the positive side, there are two important points that have been highlighted in 
the analogy between organizations and neural networks. The frst one is that com￾plex systems can perform intelligent tasks even if what they must do is not explicitly 
codifed as instructions; thus, just like neural networks can perform their tasks with￾out specifc programs written by a coder, so can organizations perform their tasks 
without specifc orders issued by a manager. The second point is that even if they 
cannot really be said to have mental representations, complex systems do entertain 
and manipulate information which is not, in any sense, possessed by its parts. This, 
as we have seen, is true for neural networks and their nodes, but also, more interest￾ingly, for organizations and their members, who may not share beliefs and goals 
with one another and still contribute to the processing of information on the part of 
the organization as a whole.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the emergentist approach to the analysis organizations 
developed by James Taylor and Elizabeth Van Every. This approach is based on the 
analogy between the way in which some philosophers say mental properties emerge 
from physical ones and the way in which the collective properties of an organization

could be said to emerge from the individual ones of its members. Generally speak￾ing, emergent properties are properties of a whole that cannot be reduced to or 
explained in terms of the properties of its parts. Emergentism about mental episodes 
is usually framed in terms of the computational theory of mind, according to which 
the mind is a computational system, and is supported by the advances of 
Connectionism in the feld of artifcial intelligence. To the contrary of the classical 
symbolic AI, the connectionist approach is based on artifcial neural networks that, 
after proper training, are able to perform intelligent tasks without computing algo￾rithms that explicitly codify instructions to perform those tasks; in a way, the intel￾ligent behavior of a neural network emerges from the properties of its neurons and 
their connections. By analogy with this kind philosophy of mind, one could argue 
that the intelligent behavior that an organization performs cannot be reduced or 
explained in terms of the behavior and relations of its members but emerges from it. 
The emergentist approach aims to account for the sense in which we say that orga￾nizations process information and make decisions by treating the latter behavior as 
emergent from the communicative practices of organization members.

Further Introductory Reading
Even if it is especially interesting for the philosophy of communication, emergentism 
is not at all standard in the theory of organizations; in fact, it is not usually dealt with 
by textbooks in organization studies. However, it is not uncommon to fnd authors 
who espouse the emergentist approach in their own theories; for instance, Keyton 
(2011, pp. 10–17) offers an emergentist defnition of organizations that is also a use￾ful presentation of Taylor and Van Every’s proposal. For an introduction to the mind￾body problem and emergentism in the philosophy of mind, see Jaworski (2011), 
especially chapters 1 and 8. For a presentation of neural networks in the connection￾ist approach, see Carter (2007, ch. 19).
Further Advanced Reading
To better understand the notion of emergent properties, see O’Connor (2021). For a 
comprehensive introduction to Artifcial Intelligence from a philosophical point of 
view, see Copeland (1993). The best way to go into the details of Taylor and Van 
Every’s proposal is to read their own work, especially Taylor and Van Every 
(2000, 2011).

Chapter 17
Objectivity
The analogy between organizations and neural nets is a powerful one, but it is not yet 
suffcient to account for the emergence of organizations from communicative prac￾tices. As we have seen, the connectionist approach suggests that something like a 
“collective mind” can emerge from the functioning of a complex system of mindless 
parts interacting with one another. Even if that were true, however, it would not be 
enough to explain the sense in which a group of people communicating with one 
another can constitute an organization because an organization is not just a process 
of forming and manipulating “mental” representations: it is also an embodied actor. 
In this and the following chapter, we will try to put into focus what is still missing for 
a proper vindication of the CCO thesis and discuss some possible ways to integrate it.
Artifacts and Culture
By way of explaining the objectivity of organizations, there is a frst, obvious sense 
to be considered according to which they are attributed a permanent reality. This is 
the sense that puzzled the foreign visitor of a British University in Ryle’s example.1
Remember that what he could not understand was the sense in which the various 
facilities of the University constitute the University itself. As we have seen, in 
Ryle’s analysis, his mistake was not simply to believe that the University was an 
object over and above its facilities, but to miscategorize the University as an object 
at all. The visitor’s category mistake must be remedied by explaining how the mate￾rial parts and products of an organization are involved in the activity of the organiza￾tion as an expression of the organizing processes. Edgar Schein (2010), he himself 
a psychologist and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, provided a

very effective framework for such a recategorization by interpreting organizing pro￾cesses in communicative terms (cf. Frost et al., 1991). Schein’s theory is about cul￾ture and leadership, but in fact his concepts can be readily correlated with the theory 
of communication used in this book.
The frst problem with the application of cultural studies to the theory of organi￾zations that Schein thinks must be addressed is a defnitional one; indeed, culture is 
a multifarious concept, variously used to refer to different notions, in different con￾texts and with different purposes. Schein’s approach instead requires a precise char￾acterization of the concept of culture itself, which he proposes to defne as “a pattern 
of shared basic assumptions that was learned by a group as it solved its problems of 
external adaptation and internal integration, that has worked well enough to be con￾sidered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to per￾ceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems” (ibid., p. 17). Schein distinguishes 
three levels at which organizational culture emerges: the artifacts produced and 
enacted by the organizing processes, the beliefs and values endorsed by the organi￾zation members and the basic assumptions with which they make sense of the world.
Now, it is easy to see that culture, in this sense, amounts to the collection of 
mental representations that a group collectively assumes to be true of the world, and 
so, clearly, can also be thought of in terms of the notion of a mutual cognitive envi￾ronment borrowed from Relevance Theory; indeed, culture is elaborated by the 
communication exchanges between the members of an organizing group and is cor￾roborated by the positive cognitive feedback that they receive when successfully 
acting upon it. The basic assumptions in the mutual cognitive environment of the 
group pervasively determine the shared values and common patterns of behavior 
that orient inner and outer interactions; thus, culture provides a unifcatory frame￾work for the interpretation of events. Once a set of basic assumptions is corrobo￾rated, they become implicitly endorsed and their cognitive effects end up being for 
the most part unconscious: both old and new phenomena tend to be understood in 
alignment with such assumptions, and contrasting cues tend to be ignored or how￾ever underplayed. As we have seen in Part I, this is typical of the selective function 
of a cognitive environment, whose purpose is to maximize the relevance of the 
stimula processed by a cognitive system. In fact, the revision of the implicit basic 
assumptions in terms of which a group understands the world and operates in it is a 
complex and, Schein notices, psychologically painful process: culture is central to 
the identity of group members and all the events and communications that are 
incongruent with it may well generate anxiety; indeed, a group is characteristically 
defned by Schein in opposition to a mere collection of people precisely by the fact 
that its members share a history of culture development.2
2Although we will need to improve this characterization, Schein’s point already highlights the 
essential role of communicative processes for the constitution of a group. The fact that a culture is 
always the culture of a group points to another reason for psychological distress when its basic 
assumptions are challenged, in addition to those we have already considered with respect to the 
rigidity of mutual cognitive environments; in fact, if the endorsement of a culture is the determin￾ing factor of group membership, criticizing the culture of the group jeopardizes one basic need of 
a human being.
17 Objectivity297
Leadership, as Schein conceives it, can only be understood together with culture: 
culture is created and managed by a leader. The history of a group begins when 
someone is able to impose their view about how to solve a collective problem or 
about the strategy to perform a shared task: if the outcomes of acting upon their 
view are successful, they may become a leader and the group may acknowledge 
such a view as correct. The more positive feedback the view receives, the more 
lightly it is acted upon until it becomes a set of implicit basic assumptions in the 
mutual cognitive environment of the group. In this sense, a culture is the result of 
the learning process of a group, and the function of a leader is to manage such a 
process: initiating it, steering it, and possibly disrupting it whenever its basic 
assumptions become dysfunctional.
Now, Schein insists that culture requires the intervention of a leader to be created 
and managed. Such an idea, however, ostensibly rests on a certain view about what 
the fows of communication in an organization should be: a view that is both theo￾retically and empirically disputable.3
 The point that is worth stressing in Schein’s 
analysis is that organizations are constituted by the communicative process of 
developing mutual cognitive environments. Such environments provide the grounds 
upon which are developed shared values and beliefs and, in general, what is often 
called the “climate” of an organization. Although these are probably the cultural 
products that most easily come to mind, Schein points out that there are also more 
apparent levels of organizational culture that deserve to be given the same analysis. 
These are precisely what he calls the “artifacts”, and they constitute the outermost 
manifestation of the culture of an organization, a level that simply “includes all the 
phenomena that one sees, hears, and feels when one encounters a new group with an 
unfamiliar culture” (Schein, 2010, p. 25). Norms, routines, customs, and stories are 
commonly listed as examples of artifacts, together with social conventions, rituals, 
and symbols, but also mission statements and other organizational documents. All 
these have received most of the attention in the literature about organizational cul￾ture and rightly so: they are familiar objects of investigation in cultural analysis in 
general, and, as we have seen, they are especially key to organizing processes. 
Indeed, an artifact can be considered “anything that one can see, hear, or feel in the 
organizational experience, and often the frst things we notice about an organization 
when we enter it” (Keyton, 2011, p. 23). Yet artifacts can be much more material 
than that.
The style and clothing by the members of an organization, for instance, are a case 
in point. Steve Jobs famously followed a characteristic dress code in his later years 
3Keyton (2011) argues that powerful cultures, initiated and propagated by a charismatic leader, are 
characteristic only of some types of organizations and ultimately refect the traditional view of 
organizing processes that traces back to Scientifc Management (ibid., p. 54). More importantly, 
thinking of leadership in terms of culture requires reframing the notion of leadership itself as an 
emergent property of organizing processes (ibid., 143ff.). Just by way of example, consider the role 
that Frederic Laloux (2014) attributes to the leader of what he calls a “teal” organization. For a 
comprehensive analysis of the different views that have been proposed about the relationships 
between the role of leadership and culture, see Day et al. (2014).
Artifacts and Culture298
as the CEO of Apple. He revealed in his biography that the example of the uniform 
worn by the workers at Sony in the 1980s made him realize the importance of a 
distinctive way of dressing for the sort of bonding it could establish in a group of 
people: he also tried to impose a dress code at Apple, without much success 
(Isaacson, 2015). Other examples of material artifacts are the architecture of the 
buildings and the working spaces of an organization (Gagliardi, 1990; Steele, 1973, 
1981); in fact, the way in which spaces are utilized is a direct expression of the 
organizational culture of a group. Where certain roles or people are treated as more 
important in the organization, more crucial to decision processes, and more central 
to communicative relations, this is usually underscored by the number and type of 
space allocated to them. At times, such a difference in rank is expressed as a differ￾ence in status and space becomes a status symbol itself: for example, senior execu￾tives are often given larger offces on higher foors with private facilities and 
dedicated conference rooms. To the contrary, cultures that favor horizontal fows of 
communication and participated decision-making processes may prefer open spaces 
with frugal, functional furniture and leave the employees free to modify and deco￾rate their working environment. Buildings themselves may express organizational 
culture with their style, size, and location.
Artifacts have a clear, communicative constitution and purpose. They are pro￾duced within organizing processes in order to make them explicit and to orient 
them. The sense in which artifacts orient behavior is apparent. Rules and conven￾tions normatively regulate what the members of an organization are supposed to do. 
Stories and rituals also establish behavioral blueprints for anyone who needs to 
know “how things are done around here”. Yet again, it is easy to see how material 
artifacts also dramatically contribute to the same purpose. A physical separation of 
the management in special spaces, for instance, imposes special practices and fows 
of communication; to the contrary, simple furniture and open spaces may convey 
the assumption that horizontal, direct communication and frank confrontation are 
positively valuated as is functionality over status.
Schein, however, strongly points out that it would be a serious mistake to con￾ceive artifacts as directly codifying the assumptions of an organizational culture. 
His point is that cultural analysis cannot simply take the symbolic character of the 
outermost manifestations of the basic assumptions of an organization at face value 
because there is no such face value. Artifacts can only be understood together with 
the process of culture development that generates them. In the absence of an already￾acquainted familiarity with a certain organizational culture, the interpretation of 
artifacts can easily be misleading. Schein’s warning addresses the methodology of 
cultural studies and, yet, it highlights a deeper assumption about communication 
that should not surprise us; in fact, the aftermath of the rejection of the code model 
in Part I shed light on the fact that symbols only have signifcance when realized 
with the intention of letting them be interpreted by someone in the context of shared 
background information. In the same sense, artifacts qua symbols can only be inter￾preted by knowing the organizational culture that produces them and that it is their 
purpose to make explicit and corroborate. This holds true both for symbols that are 
inner-directed, for example the rites of socialization intended to teach newcomers 
17 Objectivity299
the “rules of the game”, and for those that are outer-directed, for example the huge 
entry hall of an executive building intended to intimidate visitors.
Artifacts represent a frst apparent level at which the material dimension of an 
organization emerges from its communicative constitution. They do not only illus￾trate the sense in which an organization has physical components that communicate 
and cooperate with one another to ensure the functioning of the system which they 
are part of. They also manifest the objective character required to make organization 
explicit as communicative processes creating and reproducing mutual cognitive 
environments. This, however, is not the only dimension of objectivity from which 
organizations beneft.
Texts and Actants
The former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger is often quoted for an alleged 
pointed remark regarding the organizational failures of the European Union in the 
1970s: “Who do I call if I want to speak to Europe?” The joke obviously has to do 
with the fact that the roles of the secretary of state and president of the US have no 
real counterparts in the EU constitution and that, more generally, it is unclear who 
is in fact entitled to speak on behalf of the European Union. Interestingly, Kissinger’s 
remark epitomizes quite well what Taylor and Van Every (2000) seem to have in 
mind when they insist that the most relevant objective dimension of an organization 
is its agentivity.
Their argument is ample and articulated, but the main thread can quickly be out￾lined as follows. The process of organizing mainly consists in conversations vari￾ously intertwined with one another that help in making sense of the world for 
interpretation and action. These conversational practices are continuous and imper￾manent, but they also produce objective forms of texts, such as reports, memos, 
charts, maps, stories, and so on. While these texts are of course revisable and super￾sedable, contrary to the events in a face-to-face conversation, they instantiate per￾manent material that can be meaningfully used in communication and action. Such 
material can indeed be used by someone entitled to give voice to the content pro￾duced by conversational practices. When texts are voiced and acted upon on behalf 
of an organization, the organization actually speaks and acts. These are the main 
steps of the argument and they are now worth considering in more detail.
The starting point of Taylor and van Every is conversation analysis. As a matter 
of fact, if someone examines the members of an organization in order to identify the 
activities in which they are involved, one will invariably fnd oneself focusing on 
communicational practices: whether it is the transmission of orders and reports or 
the participation in meetings and assemblies or even mere grapevine, communica￾tion clearly stands out as the most characterizing part of what the members of an 
organization do as opposed to people acting individually. As we have noticed earlier 
(Chap. 12), conversation analysis helps to draw attention to the fact that basic forms 
of organization, such as patterns of turn-taking, are established by the need to solve 
Texts and Actants300
coordination problems within conversational exchanges. Yet, obviously, turn-taking 
is too basic a structure to account for the complexity of the organizing processes as 
they are realized by communication. Another essential characteristic to consider is 
the fact that while the individual conversational events per se are independently 
located in time and space, conversations in an organization are “laminated” (Boden, 
1994) one over the other by means of sharing objects, contexts, meanings, expres￾sive resources, and roles. It is important to understand how different conversational 
events come to share all these.
According to Taylor and van Every, the possibility for conversational events to 
intertwine so as to constitute unitary conversational practices depends on the role of 
texts. Texts are the forms in which conversations take place. In a very narrow sense, 
they can be both spoken and written language. In a much wider sense, however, they 
can also be construed as amounting to every material or immaterial product of the 
sensemaking processes of an organization; thus, texts are an evolving repertoire of 
expressive resources that allow contents to be shared not because they are the means 
through which contents are transmitted between one another, but because they are 
the temporary product of a collectively negotiated interpretation of the world. 
Clearly, the production of texts is an ongoing process, which represents both the 
input and the output of conversations. On the one hand, texts determine what con￾versations are about because they represent states of affairs in the world and provide 
the means and context to articulate and negotiate an interpretation of them. On the 
other hand, texts are what conversations produce, because the contents they express 
persist through conversational events.
To explain the sense in which texts overcome the locality of conversation, Taylor 
and van Every borrow from the French sociologist Bruno Latour’s account of the 
way in which technology essentially contributes to mediate actions and social inter￾actions.4
 The essential meaning of Latour’s notion of mediation can be best illus￾trated by means of one of his own examples (Latour, 1994). Consider, for instance, 
the debate on gun violence in the US and the famous line of defense with which the 
National Rife Association argues against frearms regulations: “guns do not kill 
people, people do”. Now, as far as slogans go, this may sound catchy but it is also 
pointless since, of course, no one really maintains that guns do anything by them￾selves. Those who argue in favor of gun control insist instead on the fact that guns 
are made to kill. Guns do not possess autonomous intentionality, do not pursue their 
own goals, and do not act upon them; but they have material properties that enable 
and constrain certain actions to be performed by means of them. The interesting 
suggestion put forward by Latour is that the action of a person with a gun is to be 
construed as not determined solely by either the intentionality of the subject or the 
materiality of the object. On the one hand, the intentions of a subject are mediated 
by the material properties of the instruments that enable and constrain certain 
4Latour’s approach was originally introduced together with Michel Callon (Callon & Latour, 
1981) and later developed with the contribution of John Law into what has been called “actor￾network theory”. For a comprehensive presentation of actor-network theory, see Latour (2005).
17 Objectivity301
possibilities. On the other hand, the material properties of the object used as an 
instrument are mediated by the purposes of the user. But then, who is the agent to 
be considered as responsible for a killing? Is it the person or the gun? Latour says, 
it is neither: a person with a gun is someone else, a different agent with different 
purposes and different means to satisfy them.5
Latour suggests characterizing the bearer of this sort of mediated agency by 
retrieving from the narratology of the semiotician Algirdas Julien Greimas6
 the 
notion of an actant and putting it into new use (Callon & Latour, 1981). As the 
source of an action, an actant does not need to be an individual human actor. Most 
often, it is not, because agentivity involves the mediation of some sort of instrument. 
The spectrum of such generalized notion of agentivity introduced by Latour 
stretches from cases in which a human being performs an action by their own means, 
to cases in which control mechanisms continue to perform the action they were 
intended to by themselves, even without the contribution of a human agent. These 
are all examples of actions performed by actants.
The last major step in Taylor and van Every’s argument consists in explaining the 
sense in which organizations can be construed as actants as well; at this point, it 
should not be diffcult to understand its rationale. According to their approach, lan￾guage is an instrument: the expressive resources employed and developed within 
discursive practices allow the production of texts precisely by enabling and con￾straining certain possibilities to express ideas and perform actions; in other words, 
collectively produced texts are a technology that mediates the agency of those who 
are to speak and act by means of them. When this happens, “[t]he collectivity speaks 
through a spokesperson, or persons, who gives voice to a representation through the 
production of a text” (Taylor & van Every, 2000, p. 241). Yet, clearly, the agent in 
this case is not the spokesperson but the actant resulting from the mediation of the 
agency of the spokesperson by means of the texts negotiated within the discursive 
practices of the organization. Such an actant can be said to speak and act on behalf 
of the organization, as it emerges from discursive practices.
Along these lines, it is now possible to envisage a diagnosis of the organizational 
problem denounced by Kissinger’s remark: the EU had failed to negotiate the appro￾priate texts—that is, the appropriate institutions, in this case—to enable a suitable 
actant to speak and act on par with the US secretary of state. It is important to real￾ize, however, that the pattern of agentivity identifed by Taylor and van Every is 
considerably more widespread in the analysis of what organizations do in general; 
in particular, it does not apply only to actions directed toward the outer but also to 
actions within an organization. When the head of a university department ratifes the 
decision of the board, for instance, they do it on behalf of the department on the 
basis of the authority that is conferred upon them by the university regulations, and 
they do it by means of the production of a report which has been discursively 
5Latour (1994) also calls this mediation “translation”, which means “displacement” in its etymo￾logical sense.
6For an overview, see Greimas (1987).
Texts and Actants302
negotiated by the members of the board; similarly, when a worker assembles parts 
of a car, they do it on behalf of the company they work for by using instruments and 
following procedures collectively developed for them to do that.
Norms and Statuses
We have reached a point in our investigation of the nature of organizations at which 
we can allow ourselves not to be frightened by philosophical abstractness. We have 
identifed several types of material and immaterial, personal and non-personal enti￾ties that contribute to explaining what an organization consists of. We have also 
explained how these components come to acquire new powers and become actants 
by interacting with one another in organizational processes; indeed, we have come 
as far as to understand the reason why organizations tend to raise the ontological 
embarrassment epitomized in Ryle’s anecdote about the foreigner visiting a British 
University. Organizations are physically indistinguishable from, yet ontologically 
non-equivalent to the nonsocial objects that constitute them. The same clearly holds 
true for social objects in general. Cambridge University is thus composed of its 
buildings and facilities, its administrative staff, its professors and its students, its 
documents, its regulations, and so on, but it is not just them.
We have been explaining that the processes by means of which an organization 
is constituted are essentially communicative ones. We have also argued that conver￾sation articulates coordinated practices and when successful, these become the basis 
for the development of an organizational culture that is made explicit and conveyed 
by an organization’s artifacts. This, however, is not enough to put at ease those phi￾losophers troubled by ontological distress. They wish to know in what sense an 
organization should be considered another object over and above its members and 
its artifacts. While it is beyond our present purposes to engage in debates on social 
ontology, it is still worth discussing certain answers that have been given to this 
question, in order to correctly focus on one more aspect of the communicative con￾stitution of organizations.
As a matter of fact, we have already encountered the sort of cases that raise typi￾cal ontological scruples regarding social objects when we briefy discussed perfor￾mative speech acts in Chap. 3. Consider marriage, for instance, where a couple gets 
married by means of a speech act. In the case of a religious marriage, it may typi￾cally be the pronouncement of marriage performed by an offciant during a cere￾mony; in the case of a civil one, it is the acknowledgment of a couple’s will by a 
government offcial. The speech act brings into existence a new object, namely the 
marriage. But how is that even possible? Do we really possess such a magical or 
quasi-divine power? Some philosophers have thought that this cannot be right, that 
17 Objectivity303
there must be some confusion related to the idea of social objects and that the cor￾rect thing to say is simply that they do not really exist.7
Although such an eliminativist stance might be justifed on the grounds of some 
methodological principle of ontological parsimony, it seems far too drastic from an 
intuitive point of view. Indeed, if the philosophical underpinnings of the notion of 
existence are put in brackets, it is not diffcult to tell what is “added” to reality when 
a social object is created by means of a speech act. Consider marriage again and ask: 
What changes with respect to the couple once they are married? Clearly, it is their 
status. This is probably one of the frst answers that comes to mind, but it is essen￾tially correct. The notion of “status” is a normative one: something or someone has 
a status to the extent that it is treated as subject to certain norms. Thus, a married 
couple is treated as committed to abiding by certain duties, such as caring for each 
other other, and entitled to certain rights, such as inheriting each other’s property 
upon death. They can even do things they could not do before acquiring their new 
social status such as adopting a child.8
The frst thing to notice about these norms is that they do not govern existing 
practices, but institute new ones. The easiest way to grasp this distinction is by com￾paring again traffc laws with the rules of chess. The former establish what must be 
done in certain circumstances; for example, “Drivers approaching a stop sign must 
come to a complete stop before continuing past the sign”. The latter establish what 
playing chess consists in; for example, “A bishop moves any number of vacant 
squares in any diagonal direction”. The former are usually called regulative rules 
and the latter constitutive rules.9
 The norms characterizing a status are constitutive 
ones: indeed, they constitute what having such a status consists in. Again, in the 
example of chess, being a bishop is typically for a certain piece of wood to have a 
certain status, that is, to be treated as governed by certain norms, such as the one 
expressed just a few lines above.
Now, a bishop may look like too simple a social object. What about marriages, 
or, to the point, organizations? These are certainly more complex social objects, but 
their nature does not change. Their complexity depends on the articulation of the 
social norms that constitute the statuses that are attributed by bringing them into 
existence. The American philosopher Amie Thomasson (2019) provided a useful 
classifcation of the normative structure of social groups. She distinguished between 
7See, for example, (Effngham, 2010), with particular regard to social groups.
8Notice that all these things belong to the realm of social norms and refer to other social objects: 
duties, rights, property, adoption, and so on. Does the normative layer encompassing all this really 
exist? Clearly, this is precisely the sort of questions that generate most of the ontological puzzle￾ment about social objects. As anticipated above, however, we will not dwell on this problem. We 
will be content, instead, with noticing that normative statuses are possessed to the extent that they 
are attributed, and that the problem of their objectivity depends, if anything, on the correctness of 
their attribution. What we must be more concerned with is the very process of attribution of norma￾tive statuses, because that is where communication is involved. This will be part of the topic of the 
next chapter.
9We have already encountered the notion of constitutive rules, while discussing the nature of 
Grice’s conversational maxims in Chap. 5.
Norms and Statuses304
internal, structuring, and external norms. Internal norms govern how members of a 
group behave with one another and constitute the status of a “member” as it is 
acknowledged inside the group. In the case of an organization, these norms concern 
most of what has been characterized as culture: beliefs, desires, and values, but also 
dress codes, rituals, styles of communication, and so on. Those who do not abide by 
internal norms might fail to be recognized as peers by the other members of the 
group. Structuring norms characterize roles inside a social group. According to the 
point of view of Scientifc Management, they correspond to the jobs defned by an 
organization plan. In Systems Theory, they are identifed as the expectations defn￾ing the functional roles that different persons could occupy in the functioning pro￾cesses of an organization. Finally, external norms have to do with the relations 
between members of a social group and other non-members; they govern the way in 
which those who have the status of members of a group are treated outside the 
group. External norms have also to do with what constitutes treating an actant as 
acting instead of the group. By way of example, external norms govern the way in 
which what is reported by a spokesman is to be treated as the opinion of its organi￾zation, or the decisions of a CEO are to be treated as having consequences for the 
employees.10 It is important to realize that these norms do not have to be explicitly 
stated or even acknowledged to be in place (Bicchieri, 2006). In certain cases, obvi￾ously, they are institutionalized as laws, contracts, and charters, but that is not a 
necessary condition for the existence of a social object.
We have now shed some light on the promissory remarks about the normative 
nature of organizations that were put forth in the introduction of this third part of 
the book. Organizations are social objects, and, as such, they exist in virtue of 
norms characterizing the statuses that the constellation of material and immate￾rial objects composing them are treated as having. Once this point is taken, how￾ever, another question which is even more important for our concerns must be 
answered: How is communication involved in the creation and conservation of 
social objects? John Searle (1995, 2010) argues that it does in an essential and 
fairly straightforward way. By elaborating on his original work on speech acts, he 
assumes that all social objects are in effect brought into existence and continue in 
their existence by what he calls “Status Function Declaration”. The declaration 
of a status function is a performative speech act making explicit a constitutive 
rule of the form:
X counts as Y in C
10As Thomasson notices, not all three kinds of norms are necessary to characterize social groups. 
Several examples of this could be provided. Members of a group could recognize one another and 
be recognized as such, but could be lacking an internal structure of structuring norms; by contrast, 
a group who is a party in a confict could experience a process of be empowerment that provides it 
with internal and structuring norms but still fails to be externally recognized by the other parties. 
It could also be the case that external norms are established to attribute certain social statuses—
such as the status of an “immigrant”—to people who do not share any internal or structuring norm. 
Clearly, in the case of institutionalized social groups such as organizations, all three kinds of norms 
tend to be in place.
17 Objectivity305
The declaration of a status function establishes that object X should be treated as 
having the status Y in context C: for example, “This piece of wood counts as a 
bishop in a game of chess.” Once the declaration is performed, the social object Y 
(the bishop) is brought into existence, and, as long as the rule is applied, X (the 
piece of wood) is treated as performing the function corresponding to the status it is 
treated as having.
Searle insists that a status function “necessarily involves language, or at least 
some form of symbolism” (Searle, 2010, p. 95). At frst sight, this does not sound 
right in general. Consider money, for instance—one of Searle’s favorite examples 
of a social object. When I pay my espresso by handing an euro to the barista, I do 
not perform any speech act (except maybe to thank him). Certainly, my payment 
is grounded in numerous linguistically explicit acts, performed by possibly vari￾ous monetary authorities that have made it correct for me to exchange such a coin 
for the espresso. And yet, not all deontic statuses are instituted by explicit speech 
acts; as we have seen above, a large part of the internal norms that make up an 
organizational culture are only implicitly endorsed by its members. Searle him￾self acknowledges that status functions are performed in virtue of the collective 
acceptance or recognition of those statuses and that such a recognition, although 
implicit or possibly even contested, is what really grounds deontic statuses (ibid., 
p. 94). Indeed, it rather seems to be the opposite: certain status functions are made 
explicit by performing appropriate linguistic acts with appropriate vocabularies 
when people feel the need to do so in specifc situations. This gives a hint of what 
Searle truly has in mind when he stresses the importance of language in the deter￾mination of deontic statuses. The point is that treating something as having a 
normative status is not simply developing a disposition to react to it in certain 
ways. Baristas have not simply been conditioned to accept coins from the people 
they have served as part of their apprenticeship: they abide by certain norms with 
certain contents. What must be collectively accepted or recognized in order to 
ascribe a certain deontic status is the content of the relative constitutive norms; 
therefore, language, according to Searle, is required for the determination of such 
contents.
Searle’s point, however, raises at least two problems: at this point, they should 
look to us like a familiar one and a novel one. Both problems deal with the fact that 
norms must be collectively recognized for social objects to exist. Thus, Searle 
notices that social norms have a content and proceeds to infer that language is 
required for the determination of such content so that the same statuses are collec￾tively attributed. Our issue with the content of social norms in the present context, 
however, is not as much how to determine it as how to mutually share it.11 And we 
know from the analysis of the failure of the code model that language per se is not 
11 It is important to realize that there is in fact a problem with the determination of the content of 
social norms and that it is a serious one. Although we will not address this problem directly, in the 
next chapter we will consider some insights about the practices in which the contents of social 
norms are determined.
Norms and Statuses306
really a solution to the problem of sharing contents. This is the frst problem with 
Searle’s account, and it should come as no surprise at this point of the book. The 
solution, however, should also spring to mind easily: for the same constitutive 
norms of social objects to be in place, the content of such norms must be in the 
mutual cognitive environment of those who follow them. As we have seen, this can 
be achieved by communicative means since the purpose of communication is to 
extend mutual cognitive environments. This clarifes a frst sense in which commu￾nication is essential for the constitution of social objects. The second problem, how￾ever, is more diffcult. It has to do with the fact that constitutive norms must be 
recognized for statuses to be attributed at all and for social objects to be constituted. 
Explaining this requires a deeper account of collective intentionality, which is the 
topic of the next chapter.
Chapter Summary
We began by noticing that organizations are not only collective minds but they also 
have objective dimensions. It follows that the emergentist approach presented in the 
previous chapter is not suffcient to completely account for organizations in terms 
of communicative practices. We discussed several ways in which organizations are 
objective.
First, organizations are objective because they have objective parts: buildings, 
equipment, products, and so on. Edgar Schein’s theory of organizational culture and 
leadership explains that all these artifacts are involved in and express organizing 
processes. According to Schein, organizational culture is a frame of implicit assump￾tions that have been internalized by organization members as supporting successful 
practices and are therefore taught to new members as representing correct ways to 
approach and solve problems. Schein believes that an organizational culture must be 
initiated by a leader, who originally proposes the frame as a contribution to sense￾making and then manages to impose it as the result of the learning process of the 
group. We pointed out, however, that this may be controversial. The essential idea is 
that culture is elaborated by communicative means within a group. As long as a 
culture is functional, it is expressed by an organization’s artifacts; these can be both 
material, such as furniture and clothing, and immaterial, such as conventions and 
rituals. Artifacts are communicatively constituted and have a constitutive purpose: 
they coordinate the activities and the cognitive environments of organization 
members.
Second, organizations are objective because they act. According to Taylor and 
van Every, this second dimension of the objectivity of organization can be explained 
in terms of conversational practices as well. They notice that most of what organiza￾tion members do is communication, and, by elaborating on the results of conversa￾tional analysis, they maintain that this continuous practice produces texts: a 
permanent but evolving repertoire of expressive resources that contribute sharing 
conversational practices and meanings. Eventually, texts can be used by someone 
17 Objectivity307
who is entitled to speak on behalf of the organization and give voice to the content 
produced by conversation. They explain this possibility in terms of Bruno Latour’s 
account of how technology mediates actions. In Latour’s terms, an actant is the 
subject of agentivity when, in its most interesting sense, an action can be performed 
by a human being thanks to the mediation of certain technology. Therefore, when 
texts that have been produced by the conversational practices of organization mem￾bers mediate the action of the person who act on behalf of the organization, the 
organization itself is the actant.
Third, organizations are objective because they are social objects existing in vir￾tue of normative statuses that institute them. We argued that normative statuses are 
established by communicative practices. According to John Searle, this is done by 
means of specifc speech acts that he calls “status function declarations” and are 
used to attribute normative statuses to given objects in specifc contexts. We noticed, 
however, that what really establishes a normative status is the collective acceptance 
or recognition of it.

Chapter 18
Normativity
In the previous chapter, we have explored several senses in which the objectivity of 
organizations can be accounted for. Organizations have material and immaterial 
components, parts, and functions that are typically determined by communicative 
processes. From an ontological point of view, however, organizations are social 
objects: they exist to the extent that all such components are socially treated as con￾stituting and enacting an organization. Treating something as having a certain status 
is adopting a normative attitude toward it which consists in following the norms that 
establish the correctness of certain actions. For instance, treating something as 
money assumes that it is correct to accept certain amounts of it in exchange for 
goods and services, and that the norms establishing such a practice are a binding 
reason for a barista to accept my euro as a payment for my espresso. In this sense, 
treating something as having a certain status is doing something with it and socially 
treating something as having a certain status is doing something together. Indeed, 
social objects can be said to exist just because the norms that determine them are 
binding reasons for a social group.1
Again, we are all engaged in the practice of 
using money and that is precisely how money exists.
If all this is true, then an account of social objects necessarily involves an analy￾sis of collective actions in social practices. This is why a more thorough analysis of 
the normativity that grounds the constitution of organizations is required to fully 
understand the idea that organizations are social objects. What has to be explained 
is how the norms that determine the statuses of the components of an organization 
are internally and externally established. It is for this reason that this last chapter 
1 It is worth noticing that this does not imply that norms are only intersubjectively valid. The point 
here is merely that for social objects to exist, norms must be binding for a social group. That leaves 
the question regarding the objectivity of norms undecided.

will deal with some aspects of collective intentionality: norms, shared intentions, 
and collective actions.2
Shared Intentions and Cooperation
Let us begin by asking preliminarily what it is to recognize a norm, and let us do it 
by discussing a simple example:
(83) Men ought to be in suit and tie inside the chamber of the Senate.
This is a typical dress code in Italy, the US, and many other countries around the 
world. Senators recognize the norm and abide by it. Do they approve it? As far as 
their duties are concerned, it does not really matter. They could obviously change 
the norm if they do not like it, but they are required to follow it as long as it is in 
place. The frst point to make, then, is that recognizing a norm is not the same as 
endorsing it. Recognizing a norm has to do with treating it as a reason for action. 
Thus, male senators wear a suit and tie inside the chamber because of the norm they 
acknowledge. This result, however, seems to be in contrast with what we estab￾lished in Chap. 9 about the explanation of rational action in terms of desires and 
beliefs—or, more precisely, pro-attitudes and instrumental beliefs: it seems that by 
itself a norm could not explain an action without a corresponding desire to abide by 
it. It seems, therefore, that it would be more appropriate to say that a male senator 
wears a suit and tie because of his desire to abide by the norm he acknowledges.
This is indeed a delicate point, and it is better to dwell on it with care. What we 
are searching for is an analysis of the relations between the acknowledgment of a 
norm that, in the case of the Senate dress code, could be expressed as,
(84) Men shall be in suit and tie inside the chamber of the Senate.
And the corresponding individual pro-attitude, that, in the case of a male senator, 
should be,
(85) I shall be in suit and tie inside the chamber of the Senate.
2Keep in mind that “intentionality” is a technical term in the philosophy of mind which refers to 
the property of mental states to be about things. Intentions are mental states and, as such, have 
intentionality. Shared intentions, such as shared beliefs, shared emotions, and so on, are mental 
states of different people jointly about things. As we have seen in Chap. 1, scientists like Michael 
Tomasello argue that joint intentionality is a cognitive ability that humans have developed in their 
evolution and typically begin to manifest at the latest when they are around 9 to 12 months old. In 
its current use, the term “collective intentionality” was introduced by John Searle (1990), in order 
to characterize his attempt at extending his original account of intentionality (Searle, 1983) beyond 
the level of single individuals. Now, Searle identifes social objects as what collective intentional 
states are about and, as we have seen in the previous chapter, explains the existence of social 
objects in terms of shared intentions. Hence, a certain confusion might arise because collective 
intentionality, social ontology, and shared intentions are typically bundled together by 
philosophers.
18 Normativity311
Notice that both (84) and (85) are intentions. The former is the intention that a 
certain state of affairs is realized and the latter is the intention to perform a certain 
action. Once the acknowledgment of the norm and the pro-attitude are thus pre￾sented as intentions, the relation between them should be easier to defne. In fact, 
treating a norm as a reason to act is having a pro-attitude toward the content of the 
norm. In this regard, the difference between (84) and (85) is that only the latter is in 
the frst person and can lead to action directly (if the conditions are appropriate). But 
it is also easy to see that (84) implies (85), in the sense that, in general, “Shall it be 
the case that p” implies “I shall do that which contributes to bringing it about that p” 
(cf. Sellars, 1980).
Hopefully, these few initial remarks are enough to give an idea of how and why 
norms can provide motivation for action. The next step consists in explaining how 
intentions can be shared for collective action. The most obvious problem here is that 
motivating intentions seem to be intrinsically frst personal; indeed, it seems that the 
sense in which intentions explain actions requires either that they are directly for￾mulated in the perspective of the frst person or, at least, that they imply frst￾personal intentions. For instance, I can intend to raise my arm, but I cannot intend 
you to raise yours—obviously, I could wish you to raise your arm, but a wish is a 
completely different state and, more importantly, my wish would not directly 
explain your arm raising.3
 If intentions really are intrinsically frst personal, how 
could they possibly be shared?
At frst sight, it might seem that a sensible reaction to this question would be sim￾ply to doubt that shared intentions are even a thing: Is there really anything over and 
above frst-personal individual intentions? Is anything like that really required to 
explain collective action? One might try and support such doubts by providing a 
reductivist account of shared intentions, that is to say, an account purported to 
reduce shared intentions to individual ones and explain the former away.4
 A tenta￾tive proposal for such an account could initially go along the following lines:
A and B share the intention to J if and only if both A and B have the intention to J.
It is not diffcult, however, to see how this does not work. On the one hand, it is 
not suffcient for A and B to have the same intention in order to share it. Suppose 
that both Mary and Jane are in love with Paul and intend to marry him: clearly, they 
3Notice that, in effect, I could have the intention that you raise your arm in the sense of (12), but 
that would bring about your arm raising only as a consequence of a frst-personal intention of 
mine—for example, the intention to force you to raise your arm. That would mirror the relation 
between (12) and (13). In this case, my intention would be to realize the state of affairs of you rais￾ing your arm—“Shall you raise your arm”—and would imply a frst-personal intention to contrib￾ute to the realization of such a state of affairs, just as (13)—“I shall do that which contributes to 
bringing it about that you raise your arm”. Therefore, that would not be a case in which intentional￾ity is other than frst personal.
4The British philosopher Margaret Gilbert effcaciously called these “summative accounts” of col￾lective intentionality, because they try to explain the latter in terms of sums of frst-personal indi￾vidual intentional states (Gilbert, 1989, 1996).
Shared Intentions and Cooperation312
have the same intention but they do not share it.5
 On the other hand, it might not 
even be necessary. Suppose now that Mary and Jane are both factory employees, 
assigned with different tasks, who intend to do their job. Clearly, they intend to do 
different things, so they have different individual intentions; still, by acting upon 
such individual intentions, they contribute to making the production of the factory 
go on in such a way that the shared intention could be ascribed to them to realize the 
latter state of affairs.6
It is safe to conclude that shared intentions do not result as a sum of individual 
ones. The last example, however, may give us a hint of what is wrong with the 
attempt of reducing away shared intentions. Characteristic of shared intentions is 
the fact that they are deployed to explain collective action: therefore, their analysis 
must take into account the fact that individuals who have them must have them 
together.
7
 In this sense, the problem with the above formulation is that it tries to 
ascribe shared intentions to individuals distributively, while they can only be had 
collectively. But what would it mean for Mary and Jane to have the same intention 
collectively? At this point, one could suggest looking back at the relation between 
(84) and (85): the former is an intention that a state of affairs is realized, which 
implies the latter, namely an individual intention to act. Based on this model, one 
could try and think of an intention shared by Mary and Jane frst as an intention that 
a certain state of affairs is realized; such an intention would then imply frst-personal 
intentions for both Mary and Jane to contribute to the realization of such a state of 
affairs. But that still would not be enough for them to be said to act together. 
Crucially, their contributions must be such to mesh with one another. In other words, 
Mary’s sub-intention to do her part and Jane’s sub-intention to do hers must be 
mutually responsive.
5 In this example, the realization of the one’s intention preempts the realization of the other’s, but 
that does not always have to be the case. In Chap. 12 we considered another example in which a 
group of people individually intend to smoke a cigarette: each of them has an individual intention 
with the same content as the others, but they do not really share one.
6Do Mary and Jane really share an intention in this case? Here intuitions may differ. More on this 
example below.
7Clearly, there is an analogy here with the mutuality condition required for sharing background 
information in communication; yet, in this case, it does not make sense to think of the form of 
shared intentions as simply recursive: A and B share the intention to J if and only if both A and B
have the intention to J and they both have the intention that they have the intention to J, etc. That 
is not what sharing intentions is about, not to mention that the notion of such recursive meta￾intentions would be highly problematic per se. Taking into account the fact that individuals with 
shared intentions have them together means, instead, accounting for the fact that they act together 
upon them. 
18 Normativity313
Famously, Michael Bratman (1992, 1999) proposed an analysis of shared inten￾tions exactly along these lines. As far as our purposes are concerned, his proposal 
may be simplifed, adapted, and presented as follows8
:
A and B share the intention to J if and only if
(a) Both A and B intend that A and B do J.
(b) Both A and B intend that A and B do J by way of mutual responsiveness in 
sub-intentions.
(c) (a) and (b) are mutually manifest to A and B.
Let us make an example. Suppose that Mary and Jane play on the same football 
team and suppose that (a) they both have the following intention:
(86) Mary and Jane shall win the match.
Can they be said to share it? Yes, according to Bratman’s analysis, provided that (b) 
they intend to make that happen by cooperating with each other: for example, Mary, 
who is a defender, will intend to contribute to the victory of the team by stopping 
opponents and recovering the ball:
(87) I shall stop the opponents and recover the ball.
Jane, instead, is a forward player and will intend to contribute to the victory of the 
team by scoring goals:
(88) I shall score goals.
Clearly, for them to really cooperate, (c) their respective intentions and sub￾intentions must be in their mutual cognitive environment.
Consider again, by contrast, the case of the factory employees who intend to 
perform their job. In this case, although their intentions may be de facto mutually 
8Two main modifcations are adopted here. First, the use of the frst-personal plural pronoun “we” 
has been expunged in the characterization of the intended state of affairs. This is indeed a major 
change. For reasons that will be immediately clear, however, it does not truly alter the essence of 
Bratman’s analysis. To the contrary, it facilitates putting some of its features in the right light. 
Indeed, the fact that the analysis works even in this guise shows that the “we” formulation is not 
really essential to it. Second, Sperber and Wilson’s notion of mutual cognitive environment is used 
here in place of Bratman’s original formulation in terms of “common knowledge”. Such an adapta￾tion, of course, is convenient to our presentation. I allow myself to do it in reason of Bratman’s own 
characterization of common knowledge:
One way to put this idea is to say that it is common knowledge among A and B that p just 
when (a) A knows that p, (b) B knows that p, (c) A knows that B knows that p, (d) B knows 
that A knows that p, (e) A is in an epistemic position to know that (d), (f) B is in an epistemic 
position to know that (c), and so on—where once we get past (d) the stages of the hierarchy 
are a matter of what A and B are in an epistemic position to know, not of what they explicitly 
know. For present purposes I will mostly work with an intuitive notion of common knowl￾edge. […] My hope, though, is that the main points I want to make are available to alterna￾tive treatments of common knowledge. (Bratman, 1999, p. 5, emphasis added)
Shared Intentions and Cooperation314
responsive because their jobs are defned according to a plan, they do not necessar￾ily share intentions according to Bratman’s analysis. Maybe they are simply focused 
on their jobs and nothing more; maybe they are not truly interested in the production 
of the factory at all. Are they cooperating, then? No, in Bratman’s sense they are not. 
Clearly, there must be an organization plan in reason of which Mary and Jane have 
been assigned their jobs to make the factory’s production carry on, but that is not 
enough for Mary and Jane to be said to be cooperating in this framework.9
This seems to be a huge step forward in the understanding of shared intentions, 
which could get us much closer to having a clear picture of the normative practices 
that ground organizations. There is a subtle issue with Bratman’s account, however, 
that must be considered for the purposes of a proper characterization of group inten￾tionality. The issue can be highlighted by asking the following question: Do any 
collection of people having intentions as in Bratman’s analysis above really form a 
group? In our football example, Mary and Jane do by assumption because they play 
in the same team. Yet, consider another situation. Suppose that a certain website is 
hosting unethical material and a certain number of hackers around the world form 
the intention to take it down. They do not know each other and they do not know 
they have formed such an intention, but they know that to take the website down a 
coordinated attack has to be launched. Do they have a shared intention in Bratman’s 
sense? Not really. They do have the same intention about the realization of a state of 
affairs. They do have individual intentions to give their contribution according to 
sub-plans that mesh with one another. What is missing is the third condition: they 
do not share a mutual cognitive environment about their intentions. If they did, that 
is what would make their action genuinely a collective one, what would actually 
make a group out of them. We see, then, that what really explains the togetherness
in Bratman’s account is not so much what agents intend, as what they know.10 In 
other words, Bratman’s shared intentions are not really shared: they are rather inten￾tions about states of affairs that different people mutually know they are having and 
acting upon.11
Admittedly, this is a sense in which a collection of individuals could be said to 
act together, but it is too thin. It might apply in the context of Systems Theory, for 
instance, and be used to characterize the action of an individual who knows that 
what they do contributes to the functioning of the system of which they are part. Yet, 
it is hardly an analysis of the collective sort of intentions that should characterize 
group action in an organization according to the account we are looking for.
9 It is worth noticing that, by the same token, the model of organization characterized by traditional 
Scientifc Management is not to be considered cooperative according to Bratman’s analysis.
10This criticism is explicitly articulated, among others, by Searle (2010).
11 It might be useful to think of this implication of Bratman’s analysis in terms of the cognitive 
framework described by Tomasello (cf. Chap. 1). Bearing this in mind, one could say that the sort 
of intentions that Bratman characterizes are something that non-human animals could defnitely 
have as well. Clearly, they could not be ascribed Bratman’s shared intentions but only because they 
could not have mutual knowledge about their intentions. In fact, in Bratman’s account, meta-rep￾resentational abilities are only required for sharing information but do not directly involve inten￾tions themselves.
18 Normativity315
We-Intentions and Recognition
Unfortunately, this brings us back to our original question: Are there real collec￾tively shared intentions? We are not back to square one, however. Thanks to the path 
we have traveled, we are now in the position to fully understand the answer that the 
American philosopher Wilfrid Sellars originally gave to this very question in the 
seminal paper that actually gave rise to the debate on shared intentions (Sellars, 
1980). According to Sellars, collectively shared intentions are intrinsically 
“we-intentions”.12
What does that mean? At frst sight one could understand Sellars’ answer to the 
problem of group intentionality as if he were simply postulating a new kind of inten￾tions that are at the same time shareable, such as intentions that a state of affairs is 
realized, and directly motivating, such as individual intentions to do something: 
plural frst-personal intentions. But that would be a serious interpretational mistake. 
In effect, who could have such plural intentions? Just like individual intentions can 
be had by individual persons, it seems that plural intentions could only be had by 
plural persons. In other words, according to this interpretation Sellars would sug￾gest accounting for collective action by ascribing intentions to the mind of a collec￾tive individual. Such a notion, as we have seen in Chap. 16, is the result of a useful, 
but ultimately misleading analogy. Even if states with representational content 
could be said to emerge from the functional behavior of the non-intentional parts of 
a complex system, it does not really explain the sense in which the intentional sub￾jects who are the members of an organization share beliefs and intentions that 
explain their cooperative actions. In fact, Sellars does not maintain that groups have 
a collective mind, nor that anything like that is required to explain collective 
intentions.
Sellars’ main point is that we-intentions are characterized by the fact that they 
can only be had by members of a group. His point can be better appreciated by 
comparing we-intentions and intentions that a state of affairs is realized. Whereas 
the latter simply specify a state of affairs to be realized (which may or may not 
involve those who in effect intend it to be realized), we-intentions directly address 
the reciprocal responsibility of those who share them to perform certain actions. 
The idea is that having an intention together only makes sense for different indi￾viduals when they are committed to doing things together. Thus, we-intentions are 
reasons for action for all and only those who have endorsed such responsibilities 
toward one another. In this view, normative relations are what makes a group out of 
a collection of individuals. Clearly, belonging to a group is not a simple state of 
affairs. As we have seen, Schein thought of the constitution of a group in terms of 
the process of developing and sharing a culture. Sellars instead sees it as consisting 
in a network of normative relations of commitments and entitlements that the mem￾bers of the group establish with one another. This is why we-intentions are con￾strued as shareable only by the members of a group.
12The same point is highlighted by Tuomela (2003, 2007, 2013).
We-Intentions and Recognition316
The best way to clarify the notion of a we-intention is by examples. Consider 
again Mary and Jane, who are members of the same team and intend to win the 
match. As a we-intention, this must be expressed in terms of the frst-personal plu￾ral. Thus:
(89) We shall win the match.
How is (89) different from (86) above? Obviously, (89) also specifes a state of 
affairs that Mary and Jane intend to be realized. And clearly, (89) too implies for 
both Mary and Jane the frst-personal individual intentions (87) and (88). However, 
it does in a different sense than what Bratman suggests. In his analysis, the relevant 
implication was grounded on the idea of a hypothetical plan (or best course of 
action) that each agent should adhere to for the intended state of affairs to be real￾ized. Such a plan is what the agents must mutually know in order to cooperate with 
one another. Here, instead, (89) is to be construed as equivalent to
(90) Each of us shall give her contribution to win the match.
In this sense, as an intention (90) is available to be had only by Mary, Jane, and 
their team members. It is from (90) that (87) and (88) follow. Notice as well that 
they do not follow from (90) in the same way they follow from (86); there, Mary 
and Jane inferred their individual intentions to contribute to winning the game in 
reason of the determination of the best strategy for each of them to realize the 
intended state of affairs. Here, Mary and Jane infer their individual intentions 
because they are two of the “us” who are directly addressed by the we-intention 
specifed in (90). In general, “Shall each of us do that which contributes to bringing 
about p” implies “I shall do that which contributes to bringing about p” if and only 
if I am one of “us”. In other words, while in the frst case Mary and Jane adopt a 
private point of view, in the second case they adopt the social point of view of the 
team; they intend to give their contribution because they ought to as members of 
the team.
Now is the appropriate moment to assess and try to summarize the entire picture 
we have been drawing about norms, shared intentions, and collective actions. We 
began by restating that organizations are social objects. They exist to the extent that 
people, together with many other material and immaterial objects, are socially 
treated as having certain statuses. Such statuses are determined by internal, structur￾ing, and external norms that govern the practices in which members and parts of the 
organizations are involved. In this sense, organizations exist to the extent that peo￾ple engage in the same practices and abide by the same norms. Abiding by a norm 
is acknowledging it as a binding reason for action which can be explained in terms 
of sharing intentions. There are various senses in which intentions can be shared 
which may apply to different contexts. To characterize the sense involved in the 
account of the normative structure of organizations, however, the full Sellarsian 
notion of we-intentions is required. In fact, we-intentions allow for an explanation 
of the collective action of a group, rather than the mere coordination between the 
individual actions of a collection of people. Members of a group sharing 
18 Normativity317
we-intentions perform collective actions directly in reason of the intentions they 
share. We-intentions provide individual agents with reasons for collective action, 
because they have endorsed responsibilities that they express by saying “we” to 
refer to members of the group to which they belong. This analysis of shared inten￾tions accounts for the existence of organizations on all the levels of internal, struc￾turing, and external norms. Internal and structuring norms are acknowledged as 
binding by members of an organization who treat one another as having the norma￾tive statuses that articulate the internal structure of the organization and account for 
the roles, routines, and practices that allow the functioning of the organizational 
processes. External norms are acknowledged as binding by all the other members of 
the community in which the organization exists and account for the possibility of 
the organization to interact with its physical and social environment as both an 
object and a subject.
At this point, there is but one last crucial step to be taken. The account of the 
normative structure of organizations that we have just provided is based on the 
Sellarsian analysis of we-intentions. Such an analysis in turn is grounded in the 
idea that members of a group recognize one another as bound by the same norms. 
But what does recognizing one another mean? This is precisely the last issue that 
must be addressed to conclude our presentation. The analysis of the notion of recip￾rocal recognition is a traditionally dreadful problem in philosophy, whose depths 
we will not even try to begin to explore here. Just remember that we have already 
encountered it along the way, when we mentioned Hegel’s views on conficts (cf. 
Chap. 8). The Phenomenology of Spirit would in fact be the right place to really 
start understanding the notion. Yet, again, our purposes are much more modest 
here. We will content ourselves with addressing a specifc instance of the problem, 
namely the analysis of the relations of reciprocal recognition among the members 
of a group, and we will only focus on the communicative aspects involved in such 
relations.
It is important to realize, frst, that reciprocal recognition is not a matter to be 
settled by specifying objective criteria that individuals should meet in order to be 
correctly treated as members of a group. As was underlined, the notion of group 
membership is a normative one: the members of a group are those who acknowl￾edge certain rules. But how can you tell whether someone is following a rule? This 
is a somewhat delicate point; therefore, let us try to understand it with a basic exam￾ple. Consider a little boy who is learning sums. He does exercises and he seems to 
apply the rule correctly, until he encounters the sum “68 + 57” and answers “5”. You 
will obviously say that he made a mistake. Yet, he replies that he thought “5” to be 
the correct answer. The problem, notice, is not whether the boy is correct: he is def￾nitely wrong. The problem is the kind of mistake he has made. In fact, he contends 
that he did not make a mistake in the application of the rule for adding two natural 
numbers: he rather thought the rule to be a different one. Instead of “x + y” he 
thought it to be, say, “x + y if x, y > 57 and 5 otherwise” (Kripke, 1982, p. 9). Can 
you not simply explain that to the child? Certainly, you can. Yet, clearly, trying to 
provide a better specifcation of the content of the rule could never actually prevent 
We-Intentions and Recognition318
the possibility of the boy getting it wrong again unnoticingly. Therefore, how can 
you tell whether someone is following a certain rule? You cannot ask because one 
could have gotten the rule wrong and mean something different with how one speci￾fes it. And you cannot extrapolate it from a fnite piece of one’s behavior because 
different interpretations of the rule that still match all the instances in such a sample 
could be given.
Wittgenstein (1953) famously suggested that this sort of paradoxes about rule￾following actually rest on an erroneous picture of the content of the norms, whose 
grasp is actually not to be explained in terms of having certain mental representa￾tions, but of the engagement in certain social practices, or, as he says, “forms of 
life”. In our case, the consequence of Wittgenstein’s approach is that one cannot 
recognize others (or be recognized oneself) as members of a group by checking 
their behavior against the content of the norms that are constitutive of the group. If 
membership in a group is following certain rules, it means engaging in certain social 
practices. Wittgenstein peremptorily insisted that the notion of a “form of life” is an 
ultimate one: it has to be assumed as “given” and unanalyzable. It therefore would 
not make sense to look for further criteria against which to evaluate the engagement 
in social practices. Norms do not come frst and then practices come to be governed 
by them. To the contrary, any norm is in place only to the extent that people recog￾nize one another as engaging in the same social practices. In this sense, reciprocal 
recognition would not consist as much in the mental grasp of the fact of being part 
of the same group, as in the institution of the social practices that allow for the 
norms constitutive of the group to be in place.
But then, what does such an institution consist in? We will try to sketch an answer 
to this question by exploiting the communicative reading of Hegel’s original ideas 
that has been developed by the American philosopher Robert Brandom (2009, 
2019). Let us begin by making the point more explicitly that social norms are not 
part of the natural realm. They are a social product of people adopting normative 
attitudes, that is, of treating others and ourselves as subject to evaluation with 
respect to the correctness of their and our behavior.13 This is what makes norms 
binding for us, reasons for action. Now, adopting a normative attitude toward some￾one is exerting a certain kind of authority. For instance, the teacher who evaluates 
the student’s assignments is allowed to do that because their authority is acknowl￾edged by the student. The student, vice versa, is hold responsible by the teacher for 
the correctness of their assignments. Indeed, to every authority corresponds an 
inverse responsibility. Is the normative relation between the teacher and the student 
reciprocal, however? This is another delicate question. At frst sight, it seems that it 
13This view is supported by a prestigious tradition tracing back to the modern debate on social 
contract and to jusnaturalist authors like Samuel Pufendorf. Although the view is not uncontrover￾sial, there are some good reasons to adopt it in our analysis; in fact, the alternative would be to 
believe that social norms are given in the world independently from us establishing them. And yet, 
we have argued that groups are social objects with a normative structure. Under this alternative 
view, therefore, one should also believe that organizations simply exist in nature, in the same sense 
as forests or piles of sand.
18 Normativity319
is not: after all, the teacher is entitled to assign tasks, while the student is only com￾mitted to do them. This frst impression, however, is wrong. Although students are 
typically shocked when they frst realize it, they are the ones who attribute the 
teacher their role. In other words, students have the authority to ascribe to the 
teacher the status in reason of which the teacher is then entitled to assign tasks to 
them. And the teacher is responsible toward them for performing the teaching role 
correctly. Without questions, things are a little more complicated than that in our 
society, but the core of this analysis still stands. The teacher and the student recipro￾cally recognize one another as having authorities and responsibilities that character￾ize the practice of teaching in which they are engaged. The practice of teaching is 
instituted by such reciprocal recognition.
To summarize, recognizing someone is attributing a normative status to some￾one, that is, treating someone as being responsible or authoritative (Brandom, 2009, 
p.  70). Recognition is necessary for the institution of normative statuses: one is 
authoritative only to the extent that one’s authority is acknowledged, and one is 
responsible only to the extent that one is held responsible. Recognition is reciprocal
when those who recognize are also in turn recognized, that is, when those who are 
attributed authority are also held responsible to those who attribute it, and those who 
are held responsible are also attributed the authority to be held responsible. Notice 
again that reciprocity in this sense does not apply to normative statuses but to nor￾mative attitudes. Individuals who reciprocally recognize attribute normative sta￾tuses to one another, but do not necessarily attribute the same statuses. Indeed, 
different individuals could recognize one another as having different statuses.
Once this point is clear, we can ask: What difference would it make were norma￾tive attitudes not reciprocal? Raising this question will eventually help in highlight￾ing the role of communication in establishing the normative structure of groups. As 
always, it is better to proceed by focusing on examples. Consider our teacher and 
student again: What would happen if they did not reciprocally attribute their author￾ities and responsibilities? Clearly, there are two possibilities. In the frst case, it is 
only the teacher who adopts normative attitudes toward the student and holds them 
responsible for their assignments: the teacher’s authority does not depend on the 
student’s recognition; therefore, the teacher has all the authority and no responsibil￾ity. In the second case, it is only the student who adopts normative attitudes toward 
the teacher and acknowledges the teacher as entitled to give assignments: what the 
student is responsible for does not depend on the teacher; therefore, the student has 
only the responsibility they want to have. It is easy to see what goes wrong in both 
cases. In the former, the teacher, having no responsibility toward the student, can 
impose whatever assignment and evaluate it however they like. In the latter, the 
student, endorsing only the responsibilities they want, is allowed to decide what 
assignments to which to commit and how they are to be evaluated. Either way, the 
teaching practice will not work because the norms that should characterize it are 
determined incorrectly.
We are now in the position to understand that the problem with asymmetrical 
recognition in the institution of social practices is that it does not allow for a proper 
determination of the norms that should govern such practices. It could even be 
We-Intentions and Recognition320
argued that asymmetrically established norms are not norms at all. On the one 
hand, if someone is held responsible to an authority one does not recognize, in 
doing so one is not as much acting in reason of some norm as being simply com￾pelled to act. On the other hand, if someone has the authority to decide what 
responsibility to endorse, in acting upon such responsibilities one is not in actual 
fact following a norm. It is only when social practices are instituted by reciprocal 
recognition that they can properly be said to be governed by norms. It is for this 
reason that reciprocal recognition is required to give groups their normative 
structure.
But how is the specifc content of some norms determined? What authorities or 
responsibilities do reciprocally recognizing individuals attribute to each other in a 
specifc group? What norms do they take one another to be following in a specifc 
practice? It is important to refect on these questions to not misunderstand what 
reciprocal recognition truly is. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind 
Wittgenstein’s admonition not to think of the content of a norm as something that 
must be grasped before one can follow it. In this sense, in order to reciprocally 
recognize each other, individuals do not need to mutually know in advance what 
norms they will be treating one another as following. Reciprocal recognition is not 
an event but a process. Reciprocally recognizing individuals attribute to one another 
authorities and responsibilities that are continuously negotiated and revised by inte￾grating one another’s perspective and elaborating the results of their tentative appli￾cations. Here, the similarities with communication already become visible. Just 
like communication is not an event of transmitting information that necessitates 
mutual background knowledge but a process of extending mutual cognitive envi￾ronments, so reciprocal recognition is not an event of instituting normative rela￾tions that necessitates previous agreement, but a process of negotiating the norms 
of collective practices.
An even stronger thesis could be yet maintained at this point. In light of the 
insights of theory of communication and the theory of collective intentionality that 
we have discussed, we are entitled to claim that reciprocal recognition is essentially 
a communicative practice purported to extend not only the information that people 
share about the world but also the intentions they share to act in such a world. This 
is particularly evident in the case of the constitution of organizations. When Karl 
Weick developed his view of organizing as the process of sensemaking, he also 
clearly saw that sensemaking is essentially communication. Individuals who orga￾nize themselves are engaged in the constant elaboration of shared interpretations of 
their environment and provisional strategies for collective action. By having put the 
normative structure of sensemaking practices into the right focus, we are now in the 
position to see that organizations exist as objects only within such practices in which 
individuals treat each other as members of a group and share beliefs and collective 
intentions. In this sense, organizing is taking part in the same communicative 
practices.
18 Normativity321
Chapter Summary
In this last chapter, we dealt with the normative dimension of social objects. We 
began by recalling that social objects exist to the extent that certain normative atti￾tudes are collectively adopted in a communicative practice: generally speaking a 
social object is something (e.g., a piece of paper) that is collectively treated as 
something else (e.g., money) in certain contexts (e.g., a market). Adopting a norma￾tive attitude toward something implies that different people have the intention to 
abide by some rule; therefore, the analysis of social objects requires the analysis of 
collective intentions.
The frst problem we encountered with the notion of collective intentions is that 
it seems that intentions must be frst personal to motivate action, but obviously, frst￾personal intentions could not be shared. What can be shared are intentions that cer￾tain states of affairs are realized. The latter kind of intentions, in turn, imply 
frst-personal intentions to give one’s contribution to the realization of the state of 
affairs in question. Michael Bratman, however, argued that this is not yet suffcient 
for sharing intentions: it is also required that those who share an intention also 
intend their individual contributions to mesh-up with one another. Crucially, 
Bratman also insists on the mutual knowledge of the respective, individual inten￾tions as a third requirement. We noticed that, as a matter of fact, this is what really 
accounts for sharing intentions and cooperation in his analysis.
A different analysis is proposed by Wilfrid Sellars, who suggests considering 
shared intentions as intrinsically “we-intentions” that can only be had by individu￾als as members of a group. In this sense, shared intentions account for the collective 
action of a group. Individuals become members of a group to the extent that they 
adopt certain normative attitude toward one another, that is, acknowledge to be and 
treat one another as bound by certain rules.
The idea that group membership consists in following rules, however, raises a 
problem. Rules are not natural matters of fact; they must be interpreted and a judg￾ment is required to establish whether someone is following a rule correctly. But the 
judgment itself could be right or wrong depending on how the rule is interpreted; 
therefore, another judgment would be required, and so on ad  infnitum. Ludwig 
Wittgenstein argued that the solution to this problem is to stop thinking that rules 
are defned independently of the practices that they govern: practices are instituted 
when practitioners recognize each other as bound by certain rules. Robert Brandom 
suggests that this institution consists in the reciprocal adoption of normative atti￾tudes and the reciprocal recognition as members of the same group engaged in the 
same practice. He sees reciprocal recognition as a continuous process of negotiation 
and redefnition of the norms that institute a social group. We concluded that it is 
this communicative practice that constitutes organizations.

Further Introductory Reading
For an introduction to the philosophical problems of collective intentionality, see 
Schweikard and Schmid (2021). For a presentation of the paradoxes of rule-follow￾ing, see Stern (2004, ch. 6). For the notion of recognition, see Ikäheimo and Laitinen 
(2011, ch. 1).
Further Advanced Reading
Bratman’s analysis of shared intentions is a reference point in the studies on collec￾tive intentionality: for his work on shared agency, see in particular Bratman (1999, 
2014). However, see also Tuomela (2007, 2013) and Gilbert (2014). For the notion 
of “we-intentions”, see Sellars (1980), Tuomela & Miller (1988), and Tuomela 
(2003, 2005). Most of the philosophical debate about Wittgenstein’s refections on 
rule-following is focused on the question whether the notion of meaning can be 
accounted for in terms of the rules that govern linguistic practices. Kripke (1982) is 
just a case in point, but the relevant bibliography is immense. For a discussion, see, 
for instance, Wright (2001, especially chs 1, 4, and 7). An excellent analysis of 
Wittgenstein’s argument in the Philosophical Investigations is offered in McDowell 
(1984). The papers collected in Ikäheimo and Laitinen (2011) explore from differ￾ent perspectives and philosophical traditions the notion of recognition in connection 
with social ontology and shared agency. Brandom’s full interpretation of the 
Hegelian notion of recognition can be found in Brandom (2019).
