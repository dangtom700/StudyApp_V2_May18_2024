1.1. INTRODUCTION
Humanity has gone through a process of evolution in order to survive and main￾tain its social, cultural, and professional existence. Equipment, which was previously 
simpler and more individual, has become more specific and common over the years. 
The development process goes from macro to micro, nano, and pico size, respec￾tively. This technological development started centuries ago. The example of the 
Lycurgus cup was produced 1600 years ago, when the name “nanotechnology” was 
not even heard yet. This proves once again the importance of nanotechnology. It 
is known that many giant institutes, universities, companies, and public research 
centers have made large investments in the field of nanotechnology (Salerno et al., 
2008). Nanotechnology and nanoscience are all small-sized objects, materials, and 
devices that are studied, applied, processed, and developed in nanodimensions 
(1 nm = = 10-3µm 10 m-9 ) (Köksal and Köseoğlu, 2021). The fact that nanotechnol￾ogy is interdisciplinary and brings together many different technologies guides tech￾nological developments. So new combinations, fields, and formations will be born 
in many fields of science, technology, and industry (Romig, 2004). This makes the 
importance of nanomaterials even greater.
Nanoparticles (NPs) differ from macro- and microscale materials regarding their 
physical, chemical, and other features. Nanoparticles are of interest in scientific 
studies because of their higher surface-area-to-volume ratios, functionally versatile 
chemical properties, and high chemical and physical stability (Ameen et al., 2021). 
Although nanoparticles have been used for many years, from the basic sciences 
(physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) to many private sectors, it is promising that the 
studies are developing with an increasing trend (Wolf and Medikonda, 2012).
NPs can be classified as organic (liposome, exosome, virus, etc.) and synthetic 
(chemically synthesized), depending on their composition, biological origin, and 
size (macroscopic, microscopic, and ultrafine NPs). However, NP classification may 
 2 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
be done based on the usage area (therapeutic, diagnostic, theranostic, etc.), particle 
shape (spherical, rod, cube, star NPs, etc.), and surface modified or not (poly(eth￾ylene) glycol (PEG) modified, targeted ligand conjugate, sensitive, etc.). While 
MF-NPs may be used for different purposes in diverse areas, they may be used for 
different purposes in similar studies by making use of their advantages. As can be 
seen in Figures 1.1 and 1.2, MF-NPs have been used in biomedical applications. They 
can deliver a therapeutic drug to a specific target in the biological environment, as 
well as being used as imaging agents for binding to the target.
1.2. PROPERTIES OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL NANOPARTICLES
1.2.1. Physical Properties of MF-NPs
The optical and electrical properties of MF-NPs are interrelated (Khan et  al., 
2019a). The optical properties of MF-NPs, like their colors, absorption, and 
reflection efficiency, are just a few of the many physical properties (Ealia and 
Saravanakumar, 2017).
FIGURE 1.1 Usage areas of medical polymer multifunctional nanoparticles.
FIGURE 1.2 Schematic illustration of multifunctional nanoparticles utilized for drug delivery.Multifunctional Nanoparticles 3
1.2.2. Magnetic Properties of MF-NPs
Magnetic MF-NPs are highly desirable for research in various areas like biomedi￾cal applications, magnetic liquids, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At very 
small sizes (less than 20 nm), magnetic MF-NPs have distinct magnetic character￾istics (Khan et al., 2019b). Two basic factors determine the MF-NPs magnetic prop￾erties: finite size effects and surface area effects that occur as a result of the crystal 
structure’s symmetry breaking on the particle surface. Many magnetic character￾istics of MF-NPs, including magnetic moment per atom and magnetic anisotropy, 
differ according to the bulk materials (Obaidat et al., 2014).
1.2.3. Mechanical Properties of MF-NPs
MF-NPs’ mechanical properties differ significantly from those of macro- and micro￾particles. MF-NPs are becoming an efficient alternative for surface modifications of 
numerous materials thanks to their mechanical strength. Moreover, with the unique 
mechanical properties of MF-NPs, stronger nanocomposite coatings can be made, 
and the properties of lubricants containing MF-NPs, such as friction, wear, and lubri￾cation, can be improved. It is possible to obtain data about mechanical properties 
with various techniques (Guo et al., 2013).
1.2.4.  Electrical Properties of MF-NPs
The nano materials have improved electrical, optical, magnetic, and mechanical 
characteristics, which are made clear by their increasing surface/volume ratios (Biju 
et  al., 2008). The special properties (e.g., conductivity and semiconductivity) of 
MF-NPs have been commonly used in modern electronic applications such as sen￾sors (Ealia and Saravanakumar, 2017).
1.3. CLASSIFICATION OF MF-NPs
1.3.1.  Organic MF-NPs
Well-known multifunctional organic nanoparticles include liposomes, dendrimers, 
micelles, and similar compounds. These are thermally and electromagnetically 
radiation-sensitive, nontoxic, and biocompatible nanoparticles. Numerous MF-NPs 
have a hollow, spherical structure, like liposomes and micelles. In biomedical appli￾cations, organic MF-NPs are frequently used in drug delivery systems because 
of their diverse properties, such as biocompatibility and nontoxicity (Ealia and 
Saravanakumar, 2017).
1.3.1.1. Liposomes
Liposomes, which have a double layer and resemble cell membranes, make ideal 
models for researchers doing biological studies (Panahi et al., 2017). The main com￾ponent of self-assembled liposomes is phospholipid molecules. However, it should 
be highlighted that not all phospholipid-containing nanostructures are liposomes 
(Panahi et al., 2017). Liposomes are popular because of their superior properties, 4 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
which include colloidal stability, biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and efficient target￾ing. They are mostly synthesized at the nanoscale in aqueous conditions (Lombardo 
and Kiselev, 2022). Liposomes are used in diverse compound carrier systems in the 
food, cosmetics, and medical fields (Panahi et al., 2017). Liposomes are synthesized 
by several techniques, such as microfluidization, reverse phase evaporation, thin￾film hydration, freeze-drying, ether injection, freeze-thaw, sonication, and bubble 
methods (Amoabediny et  al., 2018). Figure  1.3 indicates the scheme of liposome 
preparation.
The liposome structure’s size is directly linked with the efficacy of encapsulation 
inside the liposome. In addition to the effectiveness of encapsulation, liposome size is 
a crucial factor controlling their half-life in circulation. The ideal vesicles, when lipo￾somes are used for drug delivery, typically range between 50 and 150 nm. Liposomes 
can be classified into four categories: multilamellar vesicles (MLV), multivesicular 
vesicles (MVV), small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), and large unilamellar vesicles 
(LUV) (Nsairat et al., 2022).
1.3.1.2. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are lipid-based nanoparticles that are created with 
lipids that are solid at ambient conditions. SLNs were prepared as an alternative for 
carrier systems for pharmaceuticals that were efficiently soluble in water at the end of 
the 20th century (Amoabediny et al., 2018; Lingayat et al., 2017). Due to their unique 
properties, which include their tiny size, high surface area, and excellent drug encap￾sulation capacity, SLNs are being studied more for use in pharmaceutical research. 
They have numerous advantages, like long-term controlled release of the drug into 
circulation and high biocompatibility, which improve drug stability. They also 
include some disadvantages, like unexpected gelation tendencies and unsuccessful 
FIGURE 1.3 Schematic representation of liposome synthesis (Panahi et al., 2017).Multifunctional Nanoparticles 5
drug encapsulation for hydrophilic drugs (Lingayat et al., 2017). The SLNs are pre￾pared by using various methods. These are the solvent evaporation method, micro￾emulsion-based method, high-pressure homogenization, film-ultrasound dispersion, 
ultrasonication or high-speed homogenization, supercritical fluid method, double 
emulsion method, solvent injection technique, precipitation technique, solvent emul￾sification-diffusion method, and membrane contractor (Yadav et al., 2013). Figure 1.4
indicates the structure of SLNs.
1.3.2. Polymer-Based MF-NPs
Solid colloidal particles whose sizes vary between 10 nm and 1 μm are called poly￾meric MF-NPs. These MF-NPs are mostly prepared from biocompatible and biode￾gradable polymers. Like lipid-based MF-NPs, polymeric MF-NPs may be employed 
as one of the drug delivery systems. Due to their small dimensions, high stability, 
water solubility, and nontoxicity, polymeric MF-NPs are interesting carriers (Sajid 
and Płotka-Wasylka, 2020).
1.3.2.1. Polymeric Micelles
Amphiphilic polymers with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail via self-assem￾bly form polymeric micelles at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) (Perumal 
et al., 2022). Diverse amphiphilic polymers are used to synthesize micelles (Ghosh 
and Biswas, 2021). CMC is the name given to the concentration of surfactant on 
which micelles form. Various micelle morphologies, including spherical and reverse 
micelles, can form according to the ambient conditions, hydrophobic tail, and hydro￾philic head parts. There are many methods for the preparation of micelles, including 
dilution, lyophilization, evaporation of the solvent, dialysis, and water-oil emul￾sion. Numerous methods, such as the atomic force microscope (AFM), small-angle 
X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), are used to characterize the produced micelles (Perumal et al., 
2022). Figure 1.5 indicates the scheme of polymeric micelles.
FIGURE 1.4 Scheme of solid lipid nanoparticles.6 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
1.3.2.2. Dendrimers
Dendrimers are spherical, hyperbranched polymeric nanostructures with a central 
core (Vasile, 2019). Numerous characteristics of dendrimers, like size, molecular 
weight, and chemical composition, may be controlled based on the degree of polym￾erization and the monomers they contain. Thanks to their special qualities, like their 
controlled polymeric form and higher loading capacity, dendrimers make good assis￾tant platforms for medical studies involving diagnosis and treatment. For biomedical 
applications, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers made from polypropylenei￾mine and 1,2-diaminoethane cores are becoming more and more popular for reasons 
such as biocompatibility, excellent separation from blood, sizes less than 5 nm, and 
uniform shape (Lee et al., 2012). Figure 1.6 illustrates diverse MF-NPs structures.
1.3.3.  Inorganic MF-NPs
Besides their superior optical and magnetic properties, inorganic MF-NPs also 
possess various properties such as stability, inertness, and simplicity of functional￾ization. Thanks to these properties, the usage areas of inorganic MF-NPs are chang￾ing, and they are often preferred for disease detection and treatment. (Anselmo and 
Mitragotri, 2015; Huang et al., 2011).
FIGURE 1.5 Schematic illustration of the spherical micelle formation from the polymer or 
surfactant (CMC = critical micelle concentration) (Perumal et al., 2022).
FIGURE 1.6 Schemes of various MF-NPs: (a) liposomes, (b) nanomicelles, (c) polymeric 
MF-NPs, and (d) dendrimers.Multifunctional Nanoparticles 7
1.3.3.1. Gold MF-NPs
Since gold MF-NPs have excellent optical characteristics and good chemical stabil￾ity, they have been applied in many fields (Sardar et al., 2009). The gold MF-NPs can 
be easily prepared or conjugated with a large number of functionalizers, including 
polymers, surfactants, proteins, and peptides. The gold MF-NPs are prepared in var￾ious forms by numerous biological, physical, and chemical methods (Hammami and 
Alabdallah, 2021). Examples of shapes are gold nanospheres, nanorods, nanoshells, 
and nanocages (Figure 1.7) (Das et al., 2011).
1.3.3.2. Silver MF-NPs
Silver MF-NPs, which have unique antimicrobial and surface plasmon resonance fea￾tures among metal-based MF-NPs are becoming more popular. The silver MF-NPs 
have unique antimicrobial properties, and localized surface plasmon resonance is 
established by their crystal structure, dimensions, and shape (Natsuki et al., 2015). 
The silver MF-NPs are used in many industries, like textile, food, cosmetic, and 
medical care. Moreover, silver MF-NPs are recently one of the most researched and 
used MF-NPs in the field of biotechnology. Researchers have observed that silver 
MF-NPs are a good alternative for many biomedical products because they are bio￾compatible and nontoxic (Gherasim et al., 2020). Figure 1.8 shows applications of 
AgNPs in biomedicine.
1.3.3.3. Iron Oxide MF-NPs
Nowadays, iron oxide MF-NPs are becoming more popular because of their unique 
characteristics, which include large surface-area-to-volume ratio and superpara￾magnetism. Iron oxide MF-NPs, created by chemically combining iron and oxygen 
molecules, show an essential role in several biological (MRI and thermal therapy, 
etc.) and geological research because they are easily obtained, widespread, and 
cost-effective. Also, iron oxide MF-NPs can be used as durable pigments (paints, 
varnishes, and colored concrete) and as catalysts. Synthesis methods of iron oxide 
MF-NPs show diversity, and chemical approaches are generally preferred (Ali et al., 
2016). Figure 1.9 indicates a comparison of the chemical, physical, and biological 
methods for producing iron oxide MF-NPs.
1.3.3.4. Platinum MF-NPs
The antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer potential of platinum MF-NPs 
makes them remarkable nanoparticles for studies in a variety of fields, including 
FIGURE 1.7 Schematic representation of various types of gold MF-NPs (Das et al., 2011).8 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
FIGURE 1.8 Applications of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in biomedicine (Gherasim et al., 
2020).
FIGURE 1.9 Comparison of three distinct methods for producing iron oxide MF-NPs (Ali 
et al., 2016).Multifunctional Nanoparticles 9
pharmacology and nanomedicine. Platinum MF-NPs find a place not only in the 
medical field but also in industry in various applications, such as catalytic studies. 
Platinum MF-NPs, which are metal-based MF-NPs, are created by bottom-up and 
top-down approaches. Similar to other MF-NPs, platinum MF-NPs are character￾ized by diverse methods like scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction 
analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) (Jeyaraj et al., 2019).
1.3.3.5. Palladium MF-NPs
Palladium shows an excellent catalytic effect and rapid hydrogen absorption proper￾ties. However, the fact that palladium is known as an expensive noble metal limits its 
use in many areas (Saldan et al., 2015).
1.3.3.6. Quantum Dots MF-NPs
Recently, nanoscale materials have provided extremely effective study structures 
for many different advanced studies in fields such as biology, optoelectronics, elec￾tronics, and biomedicine. These structures can be classified into three types: two￾dimensional (2D), one-dimensional (1D), and zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructures. 
Examples are thin films or quantum wells for 2D, quantum wires for 1D, and quan￾tum dots for 0D (Bera et al., 2010). Multifunctional quantum dot (QD)-NPs are uti￾lized in many different areas, including solar cells, LED, and laser technology, and 
they are also used in biomedical applications and diverse research like imaging and 
drug delivery (Kargozar et al., 2020). Multifunctional QDs-NPs may be created by 
the sol–gel process, microemulsion process, and vapor deposition methods (Bera 
et al., 2010).
1.3.4. iNorgaNic oxide Mf-NPs
1.3.4.1. Silica MF-NPs
Silica, which is a part of sand, glass, and quartz, is chemically called silicon dioxide 
( ) SiO2 . It is used in many areas, such as glass and ceramics and, moreover, in nano￾medicine applications due to its biocompatibility, chemical or physical modification 
ability, and mechanical properties (Lee et al., 2012). Silica MF-NPs illustrate the 
potential to effectively absorb radiation in the visible and near-infrared spectrums 
of electromagnetic waves. Thanks to this feature, silica MF-NPs are used in in vivo 
imaging (Rabaan et al., 2022).
1.3.4.2. Titanium Dioxide MF-NPs
The impacts of the widespread use of titanium dioxide ( ) TiO2 production on the 
natural world and community health is the issue of numerous studies. TiO2 MF-NPs 
are well organized at the nanoscale, and they are utilized across several sectors, like 
medicine carrier systems, food preparation, and cosmetics. TiO2 MF-NPs have supe￾rior characters, such as being environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and resistant 
to chemical erosion. In addition to various chemical techniques, including the sol–gel 
method and the hydrothermal method, it is also possible to create TiO2 MF-NPs by 
more environmentally friendly biological synthesis methods (Irshad et al., 2021).
 
 10 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
1.3.4.3. Cerium Oxide MF-NPs
Cerium, a lanthanide group element, is also a rare earth metal. Cerium oxide exists 
in two oxidation forms: cerium (IV) and cerium (III) (Singh et al., 2020). In addition 
to its catalytic qualities, it also demonstrates antioxidant capabilities. Cerium oxide 
MF-NPs are applied in diverse areas, including biomedicine, environment, and agri￾culture (Singh et al., 2020). It is possible to produce cerium oxide MF-NPs with two 
basic methods: chemical and biological methods (Rajeshkumar and Naik, 2018).
1.3.5.  Hybrid MF-NPs
In numerous recently published studies, there has been increased interest in hybrid 
materials created by polymers and inorganic- or organic-based systems. The creation 
of hybrid polymer materials puts limitations on the synthesis of novel chemicals 
(Soares et al., 2020).
1.4. SYNTHESIS METHODS OF MF-NPs
There are many different devices and techniques for preparing and characterizing 
nanoparticles. In this section, information is given about the chemical, physical, and 
biological synthesis methods of nanoparticles.
1.4.1.  Chemical Synthesis Methods
Chemical synthesis methods used for the preparation of nanoparticles include the 
sol–gel method, the microemulsion process, polyol synthesis, hydrothermal synthe￾sis, and chemical vapor deposition. Among them, the sol–gel method, hydrothermal 
synthesis, and chemical vapor deposition methods are the most commonly used.
1.4.1.1. Sol–Gel Method
Sol–gel is one of the well-known methods for creating M-NPs. There are two main 
components of this method: the sol and gel phases of the sol–gel procedure (Dhand 
et al., 2015). In the gel phase, a solid macromolecule disperses in a solvent, while 
in the sol phase, particles in the liquid phase form a colloidal solution (Ealia and 
Saravanakumar, 2017; Dhand et al., 2015). During the sol–gel process, precursors 
such as metal alkoxide or aloxysilanes in the molecular structure are dissolved in 
alcohol derivatives or water, and then gel is obtained via hydrolyzed/alcoholyze with 
heat and stirring (Rajput, 2015; Bokov et al., 2021). The gel is wet and moist and 
can be dried depending on the usage area (Bokov et al., 2021). In addition to being a 
cost-effective technique, the sol–gel method also provides many advantages, such as 
simple synthesis procedures, excellent uniformity, and high purity (Sajid and Płotka￾Wasylka, 2020). Dubey et al. (2015) used the sol–gel process to produce and charac￾terize amorphous SiO2 MF-NPs. The amorphous structure of the SiO2 MF-NPs was 
confirmed by TEM, and the average diameter of monodisperse silica MF-NPs was 
found to be around 25 nm. As a result, simple and cost-effective SiO2 nanoparticles 
for commercial purposes were produced by the sol–gel technique.Multifunctional Nanoparticles 11
1.4.1.2. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
CVD is the process that occurs when components in the environment are evaporated 
at high temperatures and deposited uniformly on a surface (Dhand et al., 2015; Ealia 
and Saravanakumar, 2017). Creating extremely pure, uniform, robust, and tough 
nanoparticle formations are among CVD’s advantages. On the other hand, this tech￾nique has some disadvantages (Ealia and Saravanakumar, 2017).
There are several kinds of chemical vapor deposition methods, including atmo￾spheric pressure CVD (APCVD), atomic layer CVD (ALCVD), low-pressure CVD 
(LPCVD), and metal-organic CVD (MOCVD) (Carlsson and Martin, 2010). In their 
study, Liu et al. (2011) produced excellent single-layer and multilayer graphene on Cu 
substrates using LPCVD. Substrate annealing and partial hydrocarbon pressure are 
factors that affect the homogeneity of the graphene coating. In addition, it has been 
determined that the purity of the Cu film is important in the controlled synthesis of 
single-layer or multilayer graphene films.
1.4.1.3. Hydrothermal Synthesis
The hydrothermal method is another way to prepare MF-NPs at different tempera￾tures by adjusting the pressure aqueous solvents. MF-NPs can be produced by this 
technique from materials that become unstable at high temperatures. Depending on 
the vapor pressure of the material in solution, the morphologies of MF-NPs can be 
monitored thanks to this technique. (Sajid and Płotka-Wasylka, 2020).
1.4.2. Physical Synthesis Methods
In the physical techniques to prepare MF-NPs, pressure, heat, or electrical energy are 
used to obtain potential physical changes such as condensation, melting, or evapora￾tion. The lack of solvent contamination makes these approaches advantageous in the 
production of monodisperse MF-NPs, but it is not a cost-effective method due to the 
plentiful waste generated during the process. (Dhand et al., 2015).
1.4.2.1. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)
PVD technology is one of the methods used to deposit thin layers, which vary in size 
from a few nanometers to a few micrometers (Dhand et al., 2015). It is used in many 
areas, including aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and electronics (Ichou et  al., 
2024). PVD is a vacuum deposition technique that does not cause environmental 
pollution (Dhand et al., 2015). There are many types of PVD, such as electron beam 
physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) and pulsed laser deposition.
Yu et al. (2018) explained the synthesis and characterization of gallium-indium 
(Ga-In) liquid metal nanoparticles using the PVD technique, and they characterized 
them using SEM. The results show that Ga-In liquid metal nanoparticles could be 
simply composed on diverse surfaces by PVD.
1.4.2.2. Mechanical Milling
Mechanical milling is a size reduction process that follows the fragmentation of par￾ticles into different sizes. In general, this technique is effectively used to prepare 12 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
nanoparticles with wide size distribution. Mechanical milling, which is an easy and 
cost-effective method, takes place in an inert gas atmosphere (Yadav et al., 2012; De 
Carvalho et al., 2013).
1.4.3. Biological Synthesis Methods
A nontoxic way of producing biocompatible nanoparticles is through biosynthesis. 
While preparing nanoparticles with the biosynthesis method, unlike traditional 
methods, natural ingredients such as fungi, bacteria, and plant extracts are used. The 
unique and advanced features of nanoparticles produced by biosynthesis make them 
ideal for use in biological applications (Ealia and Saravanakumar, 2017). Nowadays, 
green synthesis among biosynthesis methods is getting more popular for the prepa￾ration of nanomaterials. Conventional physical and chemical methods have negative 
effects on the environment and living things due to the formation of various toxic 
by-products. Green synthesis has simple procedures, and it helps to easily form NPs 
at room temperature. Over the last ten years, this method has been very interesting, 
especially for silver ( ) Ag and gold ( ) Au MF-NPs. Green synthesis approaches are 
increasingly popular due to the previously mentioned advantages of using plant-based 
syntheses (Gour and Jain, 2019). Bio-based synthesis utilizing microorganisms, bio￾molecules, and plant extracts are the three main groups into which bio-assisted tech￾niques can be classified (Dhand et al., 2015).
1.5. CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES OF MF-NPs
The most important elements of characterization techniques are microscopes. These 
devices have been evolving for centuries and are being revised day by day with the 
addition of innovative and newer technologies. The first simple microscopes used the 
method of angular magnification of the object with the help of a lens. The advanc￾ing technology has enabled the development of microscopes and thus the design of 
high-tech devices. Today, the latest microscope technologies include laser scanning 
confocal technologies with mesolens (Noble et al., 2024).
The most widely used microscopes are SEM, TEM, AFM, and Brunauer-Emmett￾Teller (BET).
1.5.1.  Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
SEM is used for getting high-resolution images, SEM uses secondary electrons and 
detects signals generated by the interaction of these beams with the sample surface. 
The electron beams falling on the sample cause interactions among the electrons. 
Thus the electrons in the sample are excited, and the detector senses diverse elec￾trons. Via the detector, these signals are collected and processed. SEM has been 
customized over time. High-resolution SEM (HRSEM) instruments have been cus￾tomized to offer high resolutions at the atomic scale, especially for nanotechnology, 
chemistry, and materials science. The other customized microscope, focused ion 
beam SEM (FIB-SEM) is designed to provide a three-dimensional (3D) image of 
the sample and information about its spectra. Environmental SEM (ESEM) enables Multifunctional Nanoparticles 13
the scanning of samples under high pressure and humidity. Hong et al. (2024) also 
studied gold-based nanoflowers with Au NPs and investigated their enhanced skin 
regeneration, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. Samples were examined 
using SEM and similar imaging devices, and positive data were obtained.
1.5.2.  Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
In the TEM technique, electrons passing through a sample placed on a small tip are 
monitored. Electrons penetrate the sample and interact with sample atoms. This is 
the main feature of the TEM technique, which creates a 3D image of the sample and 
provides information about the crystal structure of the sample.
1.5.3. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Analyzer (BET)
BET technology is used to determine the surface area and porosity of MF-NPs based 
on the principle of adsorption of a very thin layer of gas on a solid surface. Although 
nitrogen gas is generally preferred in BET analyses, inert gases such as argon or 
krypton are also used. However, the amount of gas depends on the temperature, gas 
pressure, and strength of the gas–solid interaction (Hwang and Barron, 2011). BET 
provides information about the pore size and total surface area of the porous sample. 
BET is also used for different purposes, such as gas desorption, sorption measure￾ment, surface area analysis, and capillary tube surface area analysis.
1.5.4.  Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)
AFM is a microscopic approach that produces 3D topography of nano-sized material 
surfaces with high magnification ratios (Modena et al., 2019). The sample surface 
is scanned with the thin, sharp AFM tip, and the results are obtained by recording 
the forces generated between the surface and the tip. AFM is a preferred method for 
three-dimensional imaging of samples as it does not require any coating or modifi￾cation prior to analysis (Mourdikoudis et al., 2018). Biao et al. (2017) have published 
a study on chitosan-functionalized silver nanoparticles, in which chitosan was used 
as a reductant and stabilizer to produce a steady silver colloid in an aqueous solution. 
The colloid has been indicated by AFM to be Ag nanoparticles functionalized with 
chitosan.
1.5.5.  X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD is one of the characterization methods for MF-NPs and is widely used for a 
variety of materials such as composites, solar cells, metals, alloys, and semicon￾ductors. Various information, such as the crystal structure of MF-NPs, the degree 
of crystallinity, and the size of the crystals can be obtained with XRD analysis 
(Mourdikoudis et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2020). In his study, Raoufi (2013) reported 
the synthesis of zinc oxide ( ) ZnO nanoparticles by the precipitation method. It was 
discovered that when the annealing temperature increased, the lattice parameters got 
closer to the XRD standard, and the crystallinity and particle size increased.14 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
1.5.6. x-ray PhotoelectroN sPectroscoPy (xPs)
XPS is a popular method for surface chemical analysis. XPS is the preferred method 
for determining various properties of a material, such as the electronic structure, ele￾mental composition, and oxidation state of the elements in the material. Furthermore, 
the analysis includes ligand exchange interactions and functionalization of the sur￾face particles (Mourdikoudis et al., 2018).
1.5.7. sMall-aNgle x-ray scatteriNg (saxs)
One of the characterization methods of materials is SAXS. X-rays are sent through 
the material to be analyzed, and the scattered light is collected and recorded using a 
detector (in the range of 0.1° ° -5 ). Depending on the intensity of the scattered light, 
SAXS is used to characterize the size distribution, morphology, and crystallinity of 
the material (Modena et al., 2019).
1.5.8. Nuclear MagNetic resoNaNce (NMr)
NMR is an analytical characterization technique used to provide information about 
the structural form of a particle. NMR is a method based on the energy difference 
between the spin-up and spin-down states of the nucleus when the sample under 
investigation is exposed to a high magnetic field. NMR is often used to study the 
coordination or interactions between the ligand and the surface of diamagnetic or 
antiferromagnetic NPs (Mourdikoudis et al., 2018). Wang et al. (2017) presented a 
method for designing multifunctional nanoparticles based on nucleobase molecular 
recognition. In this study, a self-assembling amphiphilic prodrug, 3′,5′-dioleoyl clo￾farabine (DOC) was synthesized and characterized. The synthesized nanoparticles 
have been reported to be effective in the targeted delivery of clofarabine to the tumor 
zone and intracellular controlled release of drugs.
1.5.9. dyNaMic light scatteriNg (dls)
DLS is a method to determine the MF-NPs’ size in colloidal suspensions 
(Mourdikoudis et al., 2018). The Brownian motion of each of the nanoparticles in 
liquids is measured by DLS. The primary expected outcome of this measurement is 
the density-weighted distribution of the particles’ hydrodynamic equivalent diameter 
(Babick, 2020). The multiple scattering impacts in DLS can be prevented with NP 
concentrations that are comparatively low (Mourdikoudis et al., 2018).
1.5.10. eNergy disPersive x-ray (edx)
EDX analysis is based on creating specific X-rays that indicate the existence of 
elements in samples and is applied in tandem with TEM or SEM. Many research￾ers working in various biomedical research fields use EDX analysis (Scimeca 
et  al., 2018). Kong et  al. (2008) explained in their study that they synthesized 
MWMTs / Fe3 4 O NPs / PANI composite nanotubes. According to the EDX result, Multifunctional Nanoparticles 15
some specific peak points were obtained for C, O, Fe, and Cl; the C peaks are located 
at 0.24 keV, 0.52 keV, 0.69 keV, and 2.61 keV, respectively.
1.6. APPLICATIONS OF MF-NPs
Nanotechnology has a wide range of uses. In particular, nanotechnological applica￾tions and materials are included in all physics, chemistry, material science, mechan￾ical and electrical engineering, and biology-based engineering studies. In recent 
years, serious investments have been made in nanoscale studies as well as macro￾and microscale studies in the fields of automotive, medicine, defense, and engineer￾ing. These developments continue rapidly with the emergence of high-performance 
and efficient products. Many innovative investors, institutions, and university R&D 
centers are interested in the various applications seen in Figure 1.10.
Besides the common and well-known methods, MF-NPs are also pioneering spe￾cific studies. By utilizing many different combinations, purpose-built products with 
completely different properties are emerging. For example, surface modifications of 
infrared metallic NPs by conducting polymers turn them into plasmonic nanoan￾tennas that can photogenerate charge carriers. For this, a combination of organic 
chemistry and plasmonics is utilized (Wang et al., 2015).
1.6.1.  Electronics and Optoelectronics
Multifunctional nanoparticles are of great interest in the fields of electronics and 
optoelectronics thanks to their unique properties. For example, plasmonic NPs are 
FIGURE 1.10 Applications of nanoscience.16 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
prepared with gold or silver NPs. They have localized surface plasmon resonance 
(LSPR) behavior that strongly interacts with light at the nanoscale. So they are used 
in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), photovoltaics, and photodetectors.
1.6.1.1. Sensors
A sensor is a device that consists of a sensing system called a receptor, a readout 
system, and a transducer and is used to detect the presence and amount of analyte in 
a sample (Huang et al., 2021). Sensors detect environmental factors, collect and mea￾sure data, and convert them into electrical, mechanical, or optical signals. Sensors 
measure physical quantities (temperature, pressure, humidity, magnetism, light, etc.) 
and transfer them to electronic systems. Sensors are used in industrial processes, 
automation, and control systems, electronics, and many other fields. In summary, the 
tasks of a sensor are detection, measurement, processing, and output. Although there 
are different types of sensors, according to the fundamental measurement parameters, 
sensors are chemical, magnetic, pressure, temperature, humidity, and light sensors. 
According to their physical functioning, there are optical (photocell), piezoelectric, 
tunneling, Hall effect, motion, metal-nanoparticle-based capacitive, and inductive 
sensors. Ultrasonic sensors and infrared sensors are also widely used. While silicon 
is the most widely utilized material in sensor fabrication of semiconductors, metal, 
aluminum, and plastic are also used for diverse applications. Metal-oxide based sen￾sors, have gained interest in the industry due to their good stability, wide bandgap, 
and portable conductive carriers (Sapner et al., 2024). ZnO -based sensors enable the 
safe transportation and/or utilization of hydrogen (Vaferi et al., 2024).
1.6.1.2. Nanoelectronics
Nanoelectronic devices are ultrasmall devices that exceed the limit of scalability, 
including the design, manufacture, and operation of electronic systems and devices 
(Afolalu et al., 2021). The purpose of the researcher is to make electronic devices 
that are reduced to nanosize smaller, faster, and more powerful. Nanoelectronic 
devices cover the properties of the components of transistors, semiconductors, and 
nanomaterials. Single electron transistors (SET), field effective transistors (FETs), 
spintronics quantum-based devices, superlattice arrangements, carbon nanotubes, 
and molecular electronic devices are some of the nanoelectronics. The well-known 
MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field electrotransistor) is a type of transistor 
commonly used in the semiconductor industry.
As a result of the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), 
together with integrated circuit (IC) systems, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical sys￾tems) technology has emerged (Zhou et al., 2019). By integrating sensors, photonics, 
actuators, energy, fluids, and basic sciences, NEMS performs with high precision, 
speed, resolution, and accuracy. Due to strength and flexibility problems in Si-based 
NEMS, studies with carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been sustained in recent years.
1.6.1.3. Chips
Chips are used in many sectors, such as materials science, medicine, electronics, and 
energy. Nanotechnology has revolutionized chip technology, bringing innovations 
and advantages. These include increased performance, energy efficiency, advanced 
manufacturing techniques, functional and novel nanomaterials, and miniaturization. 
 
 
 Multifunctional Nanoparticles 17
Chips are commonly used for sensing, imaging, energy storage, catalysis, biomedical 
applications, and drug delivery. The use of multifunctional nanoparticles in chip tech￾nology plays a role in the development of efficient, compact, lightweight, and multi￾functional (MF) systems that extend the capabilities of many electronic devices. The 
most widely used MF-NPs in newly manufactured chips are graphene, gold, silver, sil￾icon, platinum, magnetic, and quantum dot nanoparticles. In addition to these, a wide 
range of materials, such as nickel, magnesium, cobalt, rare earth elements (REEs), 
zinc, and titanium dioxide have been used in chip technology (Seo et al., 2018).
1.6.2. Medicine and Health Applications
1.6.2.1. Biosensors
Biosensors combine a biological component and a physicochemical detection com￾ponent to diagnose and detect an analyte. They have recently been used to read and 
evaluate DNA and RNA sequences, replacing the use of complex instruments. Here, 
electrostatic repulsion is utilized, a biosensing approach based on the repulsion of 
objects with the same electrical charge. One of the biggest advantages of these sen￾sors is that they provide results quickly (Baykara, 2016).
Developing close contact with a biological analyte and its sensing surface while 
protecting the component’s stability is the primary objective of biosensors (Huang 
et al., 2021). Diverse chemical and physical designs are used to achieve this stabili￾zation (Jiang et al., 2018; Zuo et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2021). Figure 1.11 shows the 
principles of biosensors.
FIGURE 1.11 Scheme of biosensor working principle (Huang et al., 2021).18 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
In biosensor systems, some features such as selectivity, sensitivity, repeatability 
(measurability), and measurement results are requested.
Biosensors can be classified according to certain parameters. For example, they 
are classified according to biotransducer and transducer type. Classification accord￾ing to biotransduction elements includes enzymes, antibodies, antigens, oligonucle￾otides, cell membrane receptors, organelles, cells, and phage particles. Classification 
by transducer type includes optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, and thermomet￾ric biosensors. Figure 1.12 shows the classification of biosensors and biochips.
The sensitive biological layer in biosensors may attach to a transducer through a 
variety of chemical and physical processes (Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2015, 2021). 
A bioreceptor is a biological system, such as an organism or tissue, or a biological 
molecular species, such as an enzyme, protein, etc., that uses a biochemical process 
for detection (Huang et al., 2021).
The majority of biological receptors depend on relationships between antigen 
and antibody, nucleic acid, enzyme-substrate, and cellular, enzymatic, and syn￾thesized biological receptors (Zhang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019; Huang et al., 
2013, 2021).
The most typical group of bioreceptors used in health and medicine are biodetec￾tion sensors.
1.6.2.2. Biochips (Microarray Systems)
Biochips, also known as microarrays, are small solid substrates, usually manufac￾tured using glass and silicon. They are designed to detect biological and chemical 
FIGURE 1.12 Classification of biosensors and biochips (Huang et al., 2021).Multifunctional Nanoparticles 19
analytes. Biochips are formed by combining a biological component with a signal 
converter (transducer). The biological components identify the target analyte. The 
analyte is detected and converted into a signal by the transducer. With the devel￾opments in the last 20  years, DNA, RNA, and protein chips have enabled basic 
biological research, early diagnosis systems, identification of gene mutations that 
cause diseases, and clinical tests. Thus diagnosis time is shortened, resistance genes 
belonging to some drug groups are detected, and identification problems can be 
solved. Figure 1.13 shows the main components of biosensors schematized.
Multiple species can be detected simultaneously by cumulative biosensors. Each 
sensor contains a unique bioreceptor that helps identify some of the several analyti￾cal substances found in the material. The sum of those formations uses the identical 
sensing point or measurement time for each analyte (Huang et al., 2021). All sensor 
components, including the transducer, amplifier, sampling system, and sensor ele￾ments, as well as all required circuits and pathways, are integrated into a single chip 
in assembled biochip systems (Shi et al., 2017).
Biochips, which enable precise analysis of biological systems at the nanoscale, 
have become important in everything from clinical diagnosis and treatment to bio￾medical research, thanks to nanotechnology. This multidisciplinary approach is 
expected to stimulate further research.
Nanoparticles made of rare earth elements (gadolinium, etc.) and silica, as well as 
inorganic materials such as metals, metal oxides, and semiconductors, have unique 
optical, magnetic, plasmonic, and electrical properties (Mohammadpour et al., 2019). 
FIGURE 1.13 Main components of biosensors.20 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
These unique characteristics enable MF-NPs to be conjugated with dyes, therapeutic 
agents, and targeting legends. They can be readily decorated using standard coating 
techniques like liposomes, nanocrystal layer-by-layer assembly, silica/mesoporous 
silica, micelles, and biopolymers (Bao et al., 2013). Inorganic nanoparticles come in 
a variety of forms and have many different applications. In optical imaging, photo￾acoustic imaging, and computed tomography (CT), for instance, gold nanoparticles 
are excellent contrast agents (Popovtzer et al., 2008; Gobin et al., 2007). Additionally, 
photothermal treatments can make use of gold nanocages and nanoshells (Hirsch 
et  al., 2003; Huang et  al., 2006). It takes very little optimization to use similar 
nanoparticles of gold for both medicinal and imaging purposes at the same time.
MF-NPs contribute to the healthcare sector with devices that perform multiple 
laboratory functions and tasks on a single small chip with picoliter-level fluids (urine, 
blood, etc.) with laboratory-on-chip (LOC) techniques. These devices are developed 
within the scope of MEMS (microelectronic mechanical system) and are sometimes 
referred to as a micrototal analysis system (µTAS). In addition, it offers fast, sen￾sitive, and easy detection of chemicals in water and air samples for environmental 
monitoring and detection of pathogens and toxins in agricultural activities. Some 
applications of biochip technology are given in Table 1.1 (Baykara, 2016).
Other applications of MF-NPs in medicine and healthcare are as follows:
Drug delivery: Small biological molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids can be 
transferred by using MF-NPs in the development of systems for drug deliv￾ery. Drug delivery systems commonly employ carbon-based, silica-based, 
and inorganic-based NPs, such as iron oxide. Their objectives are to coun￾teract the natural toxicity of certain medications and to specifically target 
complicated illnesses with controlled drug release (Jadhav et al., 2024).
In gene therapy, nanoparticles act as carriers in gene delivery. MF-NPs offer a 
treatment method for many diseases by protecting and preventing the break￾down of nucleic acids and boosting their absorption by cells.

Regenerative medicine: MF-NPs are used for tissue repair, tissue regeneration, 
and stem cell therapy with growth factors, cytokines, and stem cells.
Antimicrobial applications: Infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi 
can disrupt the microbial membrane, prevent biofilm formation, and/or fight 
microbial replication, offering alternative treatment methods to drugs.
1.6.2.3. Bioimaging
MF-NPs are very important for biomedical imaging as they have features such as 
enhanced contrast, high biocompatibility, and efficient targeting. They are used in 
positron emission tomography (PET), optical imaging, computed tomography (CT), 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Krishnan, 2020). These nanoparticles are 
used in conjunction with imaging agents to improve sensitivity, contrast, and allow 
for the real-time monitoring of biological structures. There are a wide variety of 
imaging agents, such as fluorophores, radionuclides, and contrast agents. MF-NPs 
are used in optical imaging by exploiting their fluorescence effect, in MRI by exploit￾ing their superparamagnetic properties and in nuclear imaging by exploiting their 
radioactive properties. MF-NPs used in surface functionalization selectively bind 
to specific cells and/or tissues with targeting ligands (antibodies, peptides, etc.) and 
improve image quality. MF-NPs can simultaneously carrier therapeutic agents or 
drugs to the desired tissue and organ, generating imaging data to monitor treatment 
responses.
For example, superparamagnetic demic oxide (SPION) has been used for drug 
delivery, diagnostic tools, and magnetic targeting (Vangijzegem et al., 2023), while a 
study with gold NPs conjugated with anti-epidermal growth factor examined tumors 
formed by human squamous cell carcinoma head and neck cancer cells injected into 
nude mice. Small tumors, undetectable by current anatomical computed tomography 
were enhanced and clearly visualized by molecularly targeted gold NPs (Reuveni 
et al., 2011).
1.6.3. eNviroNMeNtal aPPlicatioNs
The use of nanoparticles offers some new applications in terms of environmental pol￾lution prevention, cleaning, and sustainability. Many studies are carried out to reduce 
the use of raw materials, which are sources of pollution, to minimize the amount of 
waste, and to ensure optimum use of energy. Instead of macro- and even microscale 
production and R&D studies, MF-NPs minimize raw material and energy consump￾tion, reduce the amount of waste generated, and thus save time and energy through 
ecological green chemical processes. For example, thanks to some novel nanocata￾lysts, energy consumption is reduced, and lower temperatures are sufficient for appli￾cations (Nowack, 2008; Mansoori et al., 2008).
In water treatment systems, MF-NPs offer selective adsorption of organic con￾taminants, heavy metals, chemicals, and contamination from personal hygiene items. 
Thanks to nanotechnological filtration systems, pollutants are effectively eliminated 
from water resources. Under UV or visible light scattering, titanium dioxide ( ) TiO2
and iron oxide ( ) Fe3 4 O nanoparticles (NPs) are utilized in photocatalytic processes 
 22 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
to degrade organic contaminants. Magnetic MF-NPs are also frequently used in 
water treatment systems. It is acknowledged that nanotechnology has the potential 
to be a significant technological advancement in the resolution of numerous water￾treatment-related issues (Timoumi et al., 2007, 2008a, 2008b; Tlili et al., 2008; Sa’ed 
and Tlili, 2015; Khan et al., 2019a).
MF-NPs used in air filtration systems provide cleaner air by capturing pollutants, 
evoporated organics, and particulate matter (PM). It is also used for filtering submi￾cron particles, known as secondary pollution. For example, nanofiber fibrous mem￾branes based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and konjac glucomannan (KGM) loaded 
with ZnO NPs have been synthesized. Highly effective air filtration systems made 
with these synthesized products have been reported to exhibit better photocatalytic 
and antibacterial activity (Lv et al., 2019).
MF-NPs used in soil remediation studies are used to improve the soil, increase 
its yield and quality, and remove pollutants (Kristanti et  al., 2021). In addition, 
MF-NPs can neutralize pollutants in soil and prevent their transfer to groundwater. 
The most commonly used MF-NPs for these are inorganic and carbon-based NPs. 
Nanocomposites have been shown to be highly effective for the removal and immo￾bilization of As in arsenic-contaminated soils (Alidokht et al., 2021). MF-NPs have 
been used for waste management, environmental sensing and monitoring, and nano￾biological remediation.
1.6.4.  Energy-Related Applications
Thermal management, photovoltaics, energy storage, catalysis, and thermal regulation 
are the domains in the energy sector where MF-NPs are commonly used and where 
extensive R&D investigations are being conducted. As a primary energy source, alter￾native and renewable environmentally friendly energy sources (solar, wind, geother￾mal, biofuels, etc.) are becoming more important instead of fossil-based fuels, which 
are gradually decreasing (Baykara, 2016). MF-NPs used as catalysts are used in hydro￾gen production, fuel cells, and carbon dioxide conversion and storage. Nanocatalysts 
are classified as nanoparticulate, nanoporous, nanocrystalline, and supramolecular 
catalysts (Qin et al., 2017). Nanocatalysts are also classified according to their usage 
areas: water purification with silicate nanoparticles through advanced oxidation pro￾cesses (Uzun and Teker, 2019) or single nanoparticle coulometry methods to investi￾gate the electrochemical activity of nanocatalysts (Lin et al., 2021). Figure 1.14 shows 
the applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology according to energy sources.
1.6.5. Military Applications
One of the most critical usage areas of nanoscience is defense and security. 
Investments and protocols are prepared by many countries and agencies. Particularly, 
nanoscience in military and security is drawing wide attention (Baykara, 2016). 
Nanotechnological products are preferred in military equipment, textiles, unmanned 
vehicles, stealth technology, treatment, concealment, defense, and spotting technol￾ogies. Researchers focus on data collection, evaluation, and even data transmission 
systems with small dust and stone-sized systems called smart dust systems. The Multifunctional Nanoparticles 23
FIGURE 1.14 Applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology according to energy 
sources (Baykara, 2016).
lightweight, flexible, bulletproof, therapeutic, and even camouflage features are suit￾able for military textiles. For vehicles (land, air, sea, and space), studies are carried 
out on ghost features, as well as lightweight, effective, and security features. In terms 
of the security intent, nanotechnology has started to be used in many fields, such as 
information, communication, remote control, logistics, and biology.
Nanofibers with magnesium oxide nanoparticles are preferred instead of activated 
carbon in military textile products because of their higher protection rate (Choudhary 
et al., 2023).
In energy storage devices such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and batteries, 
MF-NPs are used as an electrode material, an additive material, or an electrolyte 
(Kumar et al., 2022). They are used to improve energy storage efficiency, perfor￾mance, energy density, cycle life, and the safety of storage devices.
MF-NPs are also used in photovoltaic devices and dye-sensitized solar cells for 
solar energy harvesting and conversion (Bera et al., 2021). Quantum dots are used 
as nanowires and plasmonic NPs to improve light absorption, charge separation, and 
charge transport in solar cells.
1.6.6.  Other Applications
1.6.6.1. Food Applications
MF-NPs are involved in many areas, such as food safety, pathogen detection, or inhi￾bition disease treatment in agriculture. For example, safer techniques for pathogens 24 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
and harmful entities are used in the manufacturing, design (of new food products), 
processing, packaging, and shipment of food products. They are also used in the 
detection, localization, reporting, and remote control of food products in intelligent 
systems for both food safety and beneficial food processing and delivery. They are 
even used in the transport, preservation, and delivery of functional nutrients to spe￾cific parts with encapsulation and delivery systems (Baykara, 2016). They are also 
used in waste reduction, contaminant detection, food fortification, nutrient delivery, 
texture modification, flavoring, transparency (beverages, etc.), and color enhance￾ment technologies. Figure 1.15 shows the practices of nanotechnology in food and 
agriculture.
For example, silicate nanoparticles can be used in food packaging to reduce the 
leakage of oxygen and other gases, and silver nanoparticles can be used to inhibit 
microbial growth and extend the shelf life. Using the silver, zinc oxide, and titanium 
dioxide nanoparticles can prevent foodborne diseases and even sterilize the food 
itself and the connected equipment.
1.6.6.2. Textile Applications
MF-NPs are used in antibacterial and antimicrobial clothing, yarns, knits, and fab￾rics that are stain-resistant, durable, and of high tensile strength and that are non￾ironing and easy to clean. The properties sought in nanotextiles are water, oil, and 
dirt repellency, dust repellency, wrinkle resistance, durability, nonflammability, 
sweat absorption, UV protection, antistatic properties, and ballistic, heat, and cold 
impermeability, etc. For example, titanium dioxide MF-NPs with photocatalytic 
FIGURE 1.15 Nanotechnology practices in food and agriculture (Baykara, 2016).Multifunctional Nanoparticles 25
properties are used in self-cleaning textiles with the help of light. Antibacterial 
socks with nanosilver content have become frequently preferred in terms of health 
and comfort. Wearable sensors and smart clothes are designed with adding carbon 
nanotubes or graphene nanoparticles. In addition, nonflammable work clothes used 
in hazardous occupational groups are designed with montmorillonite clay and alu￾mina NPs. Antibacterial properties, the ability to heal injured skin, microorganism 
growth, flammability, and UV resistance studies were carried out on fibers and fab￾rics obtained with silver, titania, and zinc oxide NPs (Rivero et al., 2015).
1.6.6.3. Personal Care and Cosmetics
MF-NPs are frequently used as additives in cosmetics and personal care products. 
The common purposes of MF-NPs are to provide UV protection, moisturizing, and 
nourishment, anti-aging, antioxidant effects, homogeneous spreading, color, and tex￾ture properties. Titanium dioxide, zinc dioxide, fullerenes, liposomes, dendrimers, 
cubosomes, hydrogels, quantum dots, and nanotubes are used in cosmetics (Baykara, 
2016). TiO N2 Ps that are used in UV protection can also be used as an effective 
whitener in toothpastes. Many cosmetics contain silver nanoparticles due to their 
antibacterial effect.
1.6.6.4. Building and Construction
MF-NPs used in the building and construction industries aim to minimize the envi￾ronmental impact of materials and structures while increasing their durability and 
energy efficiency. MF-NPs containing building materials produced are desired to 
be long-lasting, lightweight, and high strength and have high insulation properties. 
MF-NPs are mostly additive elements. MF-NPs may be paint, cement, concrete, 
heat and sound insulation and adjustment, reinforcement, functional nanocoat￾ings on different materials, or fire retardants (Baykara, 2016). Porosity in silica 
 nanoparticle-doped concrete is eliminated, and a highly resistant and dense material 
is obtained. In titanium-dioxide-doped cement and concrete applications, with NPs 
that have a catalytic effect, dirt-repellent, self-cleaning, antifungal, and air-pollu￾tion-resistant properties are achieved (Baykara, 2016). CNT-doped cement-based 
sensors have increased conductivity and even provide better reproducibility and sen￾sitivity due to pore filling with CNT and NiNF hybrid combinations ( ) NiNF and 
bridging with CNT fibers (Dinesh et al., 2021). Concretes with the addition of CNT 
are also capable of self-monitoring and/or damage detection.
1.6.6.5. Protection of Archaeological Findings
The preservation of cultural heritage is very important for society. For this reason, 
MF-NPs are used for the unearthing, cleaning, restoration, consolidation, and preser￾vation of historical artifacts with minimal damage. Although NPs are not yet widely 
used in this area, studies and research in this field continue unabated. For example, 
the synthesis of nanoscale organics and nanoscale Mg( ) OH particles is used in the 2
restoration and conservation processes of artifacts (Kim et al., 2009; Baglioni et al., 
2009). Stone consolidations are examined and extremely bright results are obtained 
by eliminating the cracking problem in the artifacts with silica nanoparticles, some 
additives, and TEOS-(tetraethoxysilane)-based solutions (David et al., 2020).26 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Nanocomposites formed with a mixture of the polymer Fluormet CP and Cloisite 
30B organoclay in different ratios are used for protection and consolidation in 
Neopolitan yellow tuff stone (D’Arienzo et al., 2008).
Sr(OH)2 nanoparticle syntheses have shown protective coating and consolidation 
effects on wood, murals, paper, and other artistic works, especially on stone and rock 
(Grassi et al., 2009). Similarly, important results were obtained from epoxy and ami￾no-silane-based coatings with the nanostructured and sol–gel methods (Khramov 
et al., 2003).
The use of MF-NPs is not limited to these areas. Especially in sports equipment 
and gear, it gains importance in terms of superior strength, high hardness, corrosion 
resistance, light weight, etc. In the automotive and glass industries, MF-NP-doped 
products are encountered by utilizing hydrophobicity/hydrophilic properties, surface 
area, and chemistry. MF-NPs are also used for scratch-resistant, water-repellent, 
and corrosion-resistant materials with exterior surface nanocoatings, while there are 
applications in areas such as road holding, durability, and vibration reduction in auto 
tires, interior comfort, and ease of use.
In transportation, MF-NPs are used in the production of light, fast, smart compo￾nents and vehicles with adaptable structures.
The uses of MF-NPs in space technology are as follows: thermal method, solar 
cells, building materials, fuel saving, storage and transmission, and electronic sensors.
1.7. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
It is a fact that MF-NPs have many sectoral benefits in general. MF-NPs used in 
electronics and energy fields offer more precise and efficient methods compared to 
other traditional methods. Environmentally friendly and low-cost methods have been 
developed with low energy and less bulk material. There is increasing interest in the 
production of modern, efficient, sensitive, and ergonomic devices by working in var￾ious fields with different sensor and chip technologies. MF-NPs in sensors are highly 
preferred because they can perform multiple functions in a single nanoscale entity. 
However, sufficient supply has not yet been created as an application. The reason is 
that they are still very new and expensive systems.
There are important developments in terms of human health and raised living 
standards. The use of MF-NPs in health and medicine enables early diagnosis and 
treatment, with drug delivery systems, it has a significant impact on people’s lives 
with targeted treatment without damaging healthy tissues. MF-NPs are used in envi￾ronmentally friendly energy, water, and air systems. They are used in many areas, 
such as monitoring, tracking, controlling, and eliminating environmental data. 
Removing pollutants and undesired gases with water and air purification systems is 
very important for a green world and healthy lives.
The food safety, diversity, and effectiveness rate of personal care products, offer￾ing more useful clothes than standard clothes in textiles, smart and durable systems 
in the building construction sector, and even the use of archaeological artifacts in the 
discovery, evaluation, and protection are among the advantages of MF-NPs.
Despite all these advantages, there are also some disadvantages. These are dis￾cussions about toxicity, side effects, and compliance with ethical rules, which have Multifunctional Nanoparticles 27
not yet been adequately elucidated, especially in health and biomedical studies. In 
addition, another disadvantage related to this sector is that it is not yet clear whether 
the nanoparticle-added materials produced are actually nanosized and whether there 
are health risks. Another concern about the use of nanoparticles is that more research 
is needed, especially on the absorption of nanoparticles through the skin and their 
long-term effects (Smith, 2017). There are regulations and standards for the use of 
nanoparticles. The use of nanosized particles in the cosmetics industry has been 
studied as harmful and is of concern to users. The accumulation of nanoparticle-con￾taining cosmetic products in wastewater as a result of cleaning with water and the 
risks of pollutants that harm water and the environment should be determined. To 
prevent this, information should be provided on the labels of products containing 
nanoparticles, and academic studies should be increased to determine their harm￾ful effects and eliminate them, if any. The biggest disadvantage of environmental 
impacts is the lack of sufficient information and studies on their accumulation and 
control in waste treatment systems.
Although MF-NPs used in the building construction provide improvements in 
many parameters, they are not preferred due to their high costs. Research is ongoing 
to reduce costs in order to make it suitable for common use.

2.1. INTRODUCTION
Nanotechnology, dating back to the ninth century, has been used to create ancient 
objects like steel swords and glass that change color when reflecting light (Amen 
et al., 2021). However, in recent years nanomaterials, such as nanoparticles, nano￾tubes, and nanofibers, have garnered immense attention due to their exceptional 
properties and unique characteristics that emerge from their nanoscale dimensions 
(1–100 nm) (Elsaid et al., 2023). At this scale, materials exhibit novel and enhanced 
properties that differ from their bulk counterparts due to a high surface-area-to￾volume ratio, which enables more significant interactions with surrounding environ￾ments (H. Wu & Li, 2022). These NPs can be derived from natural processes like 
supernovae and, within the earth’s biosphere, can be synthesized in labs using vari￾ous techniques to meet other demands and modified or functionalized to offer versa￾tile behavior in a wide range of applications (Rahman, 2021). These functionalized 
and modified nanoparticles create a new category of nanomaterials known as multi￾functional magnetic nanoparticles (MF-MNPs). These MF-MNPs have now become 
prominent because of their widespread use across industries such as medicine, elec￾tronics, analytics, and many more (Díez et al., 2022). These MF-MNPs represent a 
cutting-edge convergence of nanotechnology, materials science, and biotechnology, 
offering unparalleled potential in various scientific and industrial domains (Shinde 
et  al., 2022). That is because, unlike nonmagnetic nanomaterials, multifunctional 
magnetic nanoparticles have special qualities like degradability, diagnostic imaging, 
and remote motion controllability (Ko et al., 2022).
This chapter highlights the fundamentals of MF-MNPs and their contribution 
across different industries. As we delve into the chapter, we embark on a journey 
to explore their synthesis, properties, multifunctionalities, and basic characteristics. 
From targeted drug delivery to environmental remediation and advanced diagnos￾tics, MF-MNPs have become transformative agents, addressing complex challenges 
and ushering in a new era of innovation. Additionally, the chapter will offer a thor￾ough overview, dissecting the complexities of MF-MNPs and illuminating how they 
will influence various scientific fields in the future.Fundamentals of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 35
2.2. WHAT ARE MULTIFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC 
NANOPARTICLES?
MF-MNPs refer to nanoscale materials that possess magnetic properties and are 
engineered to exhibit multiple functionalities for diverse applications (Díez et al., 
2022). This section provides an overview of MF-MNPs, including their emergence, 
definition, importance in the current era, and a brief overview of their applications.
2.2.1.  Emergence of MF-MNPs
The origins of MF-MNPs can be found in the early advancements in magnetic mate￾rials and nanotechnology, although they have garnered a lot of attention recently. 
The emergence of these nanoparticles is closely associated with advancements in 
nanotechnology as scientists have been investigating methods to create nanoparti￾cles possessing magnetic characteristics for diverse uses (Mukherjee et al., 2020). 
As technology progressed, scientists realized the potential for combining multiple 
functionalities within a single nanoparticle, leading to the birth of new genera of 
NPs that can be called multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (Ali et al., 2021). Thus 
MF-MNPs have developed historically since the early 20th century as a result of 
persistent innovation and ground-breaking discoveries (Gao et al., 2009).
2.2.2.  Defining MF-MNPs
MF-MNPs refer to nanoscale materials that possess both magnetic properties and 
additional functionalities. These additional functionalities can include features 
like targeting specific cells or tissues, drug delivery capabilities, imaging contrast 
enhancement, efficiency improvement, and much more (Sharma et al., 2016). The 
integration of diverse functions into a single nanoparticle enables a wide range of 
applications, making them versatile tools in various fields and have broadened their 
applications across various scientific and technological domains (Fang & Zhang, 
2009). These nanoparticles are typically composed of a magnetic core (Figure 2.1
displays the structure of MF-MNP and different types of magnetic cores), often made 
of materials like iron oxide, and a surface coating or shell that imparts additional 
functionalities. The design and engineering of MF-MNPs involve tailoring both the 
magnetic and nonmagnetic components to achieve specific properties and applica￾tions (W. Wu et al., 2015).
2.2.3.  Role of MF-MNPS in the Current Era
The significance of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MF-MNPs) in the mod￾ern era lies in their potential to transform various industries, including environmen￾tal, medical imaging, and biotechnological analysis. Due to their unique combination 
of magnetic properties and additional functionalities, they serve as valuable tools for 
targeted therapies and environmental remediation (Comanescu, 2023). For instance, 
in recent times, these nanoparticles can be specifically designed to target particular 36 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
cells or tissues, facilitating precise drug delivery and imaging. The integration of 
multiple functions into a single nanoparticle enhances efficiency and effectiveness 
across various applications (Malik et  al., 2023). Furthermore, MF-MNPs play a 
pivotal role in contemporary science and technology, contributing to diverse appli￾cations ranging from biomedical tools to advanced analytical techniques and inno￾vative approaches for sensing and remediating environmental challenges (de Dios & 
Díaz-García, 2010).
2.3. BASIC PROPERTIES OF MF-MNPs
MMNPs are an important example of how magnetic and nanoscale technologies 
have come together, offering a platform with a wide range of applications in various 
fields (Comanescu, 2023). A thorough understanding of the foundations is necessary 
to fully comprehend MMNPs. This section explores the fundamental properties of 
MF-MNPs:
FIGURE 2.1 Structure of a multifunctional magnetic nanoparticle and different types 
of magnetic cores: (a) Structure of a multifunctional/multimodality MNP, with a magnetic 
core, a polymeric coating, and targeting ligands extended from the surface of the MNP with 
the aid of polymeric spacers. Therapeutic payloads (drugs and genes) and imaging reporters 
(fluorophores and radionuclides) can be either embedded in the coating or conjugated on the 
surface. (b) Different types of magnetic cores: spherical nanocrystal, core-shell nanocrystal, 
heterodimer nanocrystal noncrystalline nanoparticle (Fang & Zhang, 2009).Fundamentals of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 37
2.3.1. Magnetic Properties
2.3.1.1. Magnetic Strength
One of the key characteristics of MMNPs is their strong magnetic strength, which 
is derived from the magnetic cores of MMNPs, which, in turn, are composed of 
inorganic nanocrystals such as metals, alloys, and metal oxides, or occasionally self￾assembled micelles and polymeric NPs (Fang & Zhang, 2009).
2.3.1.2. Magnetic Responsiveness
Different MMNPs react to an external magnetic field in distinct manners. When 
exposed to an external magnetic field, some exhibit aligned magnetic moments; how￾ever, when the field is removed, they become random (Farinha et al., 2021). On the 
other hand, ferromagnetic MMNPs have a strong, stable magnetization and remain 
magnetically aligned even when there is no external magnetic field. The fundamen￾tals of MMNPs are made up of this variable responsiveness to an external magnetic 
field. This varied responsiveness in the external magnetic field contributes to the 
fundamentals of MMNPs (Dong et al., 2009).
2.3.1.3. Types of Magnetism
The magnetic characteristics of MMNPs are derived from magnetic nanoparticles, 
which are usually between a few and several hundred nanometers in size. Their 
responsiveness and applicability are determined by their magnetism, such as fer￾romagnetism or superparamagnetism and are essential elements in a wide range 
of technological applications. In the context of nanoparticles, their magnetization 
behavior differs between ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic NPs under an exter￾nal magnetic field. Ferromagnetic NPs maintain net magnetization, while superpara￾magnetic NPs exhibit no net magnetization due to the rapid reversal of magnetic 
moments, and those NPs that consist of these behaviors are the main building 
blocks of MF-MNPs (Issa et al., 2013). A brief overview of the type of magnetism in 
MF-MNPs will be discussed in this chapter.
2.3.1.3.1. Superparamagnetism
Superparamagnetism refers to a phenomenon exhibited by certain materials, espe￾cially nanoparticles, when they possess magnetic properties similar to those of a per￾manent magnet but without a permanent magnetic dipole moment. In the context of 
nanoparticles, superparamagnetism is particularly relevant for small magnetic par￾ticles, typically below a threshold size or critical size (the size when thermal energy 
surpasses magnetic anisotropy, leading to erratic magnetic moments, hindering sta￾ble orientation, typically on the order of a few nanometers) (Akbarzadeh et al., 2012). 
At this scale, thermal fluctuations can easily overcome the energy barrier associated 
with magnetic anisotropy, leading to the random reorientation of magnetic moments. 
As a result, superparamagnetic nanoparticles exhibit a lack of permanent magneti￾zation in the absence of an external magnetic field. However, when subjected to such 
a field, these nanoparticles rapidly align with the field direction, showcasing high 
magnetic susceptibility. The reversible magnetization in response to the external field 38 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
and rapid relaxation dynamics make superparamagnetic MMNPs ideal candidates 
for applications in targeted drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
hyperthermia therapy (Xiao & Du, 2020).
2.3.1.3.2. Ferromagnetism
Ferromagnetism in nanoparticles refers to the phenomenon where the magnetic 
moments of individual atoms within the nanoparticle align parallel to each other, 
resulting in a strong collective magnetic behavior. Magnetic moments in ferromag￾netic nanoparticles tend to spontaneously align in the same direction, even at the 
nanoscale. This results in the creation of a magnetic domain with a net magnetic 
moment (Farinha et al., 2021). This alignment lasts until a temperature threshold 
known as the Curie temperature is reached, after which thermal oscillations cause 
the alignment to break. The stability of the magnetic orientation in ferromagnetic 
MMNPs (like reduced-sized iron nanoparticles and nickel nanoparticle-based 
MMNPs) lends itself to long-term applications where a sustained magnetic response 
is desired such as magnetic sensors, biomedical devices, and data storage (Tsai, 2011).
2.3.1.3.3. Antiferromagnetism
Antiferromagnetism is characterized by the alignment of adjacent magnetic moments 
in opposite directions, resulting in a net zero magnetic moment for the nanoparti￾cle. The antiparallel arrangement reduces the overall magnetization of the material. 
Due to their tendency to interfere with the development of strong overall magnetic 
effects, antiferromagnetic nanoparticles are less common in MMNPs. MMNPs with 
antiferromagnetic components, however, may have special qualities in some appli￾cations (Issa et  al., 2013). For instance, core/shell antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic 
nanoparticles can be produced by combining an antiferromagnetic core (like hematite, 
α-Fe O2 3) with a ferromagnetic shell (like cobalt, Co). The antiferromagnetic core pro￾vides stability, while the ferromagnetic shell enhances overall magnetic properties, 
creating a synergistic effect. These kinds of MMNPs may find use in specialized 
fields like spintronics or in the development of customized magnetic responses for 
particular uses, where a blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic behaviors is 
desired. Additionally, antiferromagnetic nanoparticles contribute to advancements in 
high-density magnetic storage and sensor technologies (Balasubramanian et al., 2016).
2.3.1.3.4. Other Magnetic Features
Certain magnetic features, such as blocking temperature, spin lifetime, coercivity, and 
susceptibility, rely on nanoscale rules. Scientists can precisely control magnetism by 
understanding and applying these rules, affecting behaviors from regular to extra-small 
magnetic phenomena. For instance, altering the size of cobalt nanoparticles changes 
their behavior; the blocking temperature shifts from room temperature to 10 K as the 
size of Co NPs decreases. This rule contributes to enhancing existing MMNPs and 
developing improved magnetic nanomaterials for new applications (Jun et al., 2008).
2.3.2.  Structural Properties of MMNPs
Understanding the structure of MMNPs involves examining key dimensions, includ￾ing size, shape, and composition. These parameters influence the overall behavior 
and performance of MMNPs in different applications.Fundamentals of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 39
2.3.2.1. Size of MF-MNPs
The size of MMNPs is a crucial parameter in terms of their fundamental behaviors. 
It impacts their properties and responses toward different applications. In addition, 
size-driven behavior enhances the reactivity of MMNPs and makes them highly 
efficient. For instance, the alteration of the size of MMNPs alters their property 
toward the magnetic field and finally alters their application as well (Dudchenko 
et al., 2022). Second, in analytical and environmental applications, their small size 
allows them to navigate complex matrices effectively. This attribute enhances their 
performance in tasks such as sensing, detection, and remediation, showcasing the 
significance of nanoparticle size in optimizing their utility across various domains 
(Natarajan et al., 2019).
2.3.2.2. Shape of MMNPs
Another important factor that determines the properties of MMNPs is their shape. 
Certain shapes, like cubes, rods, and spheres, have specific benefits when it comes to 
surface interactions and magnetic response. Researchers can customize MMNPs to 
perform optimally in a variety of applications by carefully synthesizing them with 
specific shapes. As per Díez et al. (2022), anisotropic shapes have the potential to 
offer increased magnetic responsiveness, which is essential for effective separation 
and manipulation in environmental remediation (Díez et al., 2022).
2.3.2.3. Composition
The composition of MMNPs, including the materials used in their construction, has a 
significant impact on their chemical and physical properties. Their different compo￾sition influences magnetic strength, stability, and biocompatibility, which results in 
their diverse functionality. For example, iron-based MMNPs, especially those based 
on magnetite and maghemite, are used extensively in biomedical applications due to 
their low toxicity profile. Conversely, other elements like Co, Ni, Cr, and Gd also 
commonly need to be used in vivo with appropriate coatings or chelation due to their 
extremely toxic nature (Fang & Zhang, 2009).
Therefore, accurate characterization is essential for understanding the properties 
of MMNPs. Various techniques, such as spectroscopy, microscopy, and magnetic 
measurements, are employed to characterize the size, shape, composition, and mag￾netic properties of MMNPs. These techniques are crucial for ensuring the reproduc￾ibility and reliability of MMNP-based applications (Lin & Samia, 2006).
2.4. CHARACTERISTICS OF MMNPs
2.4.1.  Surface Modification
Surface modification refers to any alteration or change made to the outer layer or surface 
of nanoparticles aimed at modifying the physical or chemical properties of the nanopar￾ticle surface. It includes coating nanoparticles with surfactants, polymers, or other 
materials to alter their surface characteristics. These surface modifications of MMNPs 
can serve different purposes, such as improving the stability, biocompatibility, or dis￾persibility of nanoparticles in different environments (K. Sharma et al., 2011). Surface 
modifications are critical for biomedical applications; they enhance biocompatibility 
and enable functionalization for targeted delivery or sensing. It also helps to minimize 40 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
the total surface area and surface energy of the system if required. The modification 
of the surface is mostly utilized for two reasons: either to stabilize the MMNPs or to 
enhance their target capabilities (Kai et al., 2011). Both of the cases are discussed next.
2.4.1.1. Surface Modification for Stabilization
As the nanoparticles are formed, they tend to aggregate to reduce the system’s overall 
surface area and energy. This aggregation is prevented by adding a suitable surfac￾tant during the synthesis process, stabilizing and dispersing the nanoparticles. These 
surfactants can be of two types: oil-soluble or water-soluble surfactants. Commonly 
used surfactants in oil phases include oleic acid, lauric acid, and dodecylphosphonic 
acid. Water-soluble surfactant modification is (de Dios & Díaz-García, 2010), (Kai 
et al., 2011). On the other hand, the choice of surfactant depends on the intended 
application of the nanoparticles. For instance, in biomedical applications, biocompat￾ibility is a key concern, necessitating the use of non-toxic, water-soluble surfactants 
like polyethylene glycol (PEG). These surfactants not only prevent aggregation but 
also enhance the nanoparticles’ stability in biological environments. Conversely, in 
industrial applications, where the nanoparticles may be exposed to organic solvents 
or harsh conditions, oil-soluble surfactants may be preferable due to their robust sta￾bility and resistance to degradation. Hence, optimizing the surfactant type is critical 
to achieving desired nanoparticle functionality for specific applications. 
Silane is a versatile coupling agent (displayed in Figure 2.2) and is used in both oil￾based and water-based systems. It enhances compatibility between materials in appli￾cations like polymer composites, paints, and adhesives (de Dios & Díaz-García, 2010).
2.4.1.2. Targeted Modification
Targeted modification can be achieved through physical and chemical methods. 
Physical methods involve adsorbing antibodies or proteins onto the nanoparticle sur￾face through electrostatic interactions., Chemical methods involve covalently link￾ing surface groups of nanoparticles with specific biological molecules, such as using 
amino, aldehyde, or thiol groups as modification sites (de Dios & Díaz-García, 2010). 
Targeting molecules include small molecules (e.g., folic acid, methotrexate), peptides, 
and antibodies that specifically bind to receptors on cell surfaces. Specific mole￾cules like folic acid, methotrexate, peptides, and antibodies can be used for targeted 
FIGURE 2.2 Silane surface coating of a magnetic nanoparticle (de Dios & Díaz-García, 
2010; CC BY license: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/).Fundamentals of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 41
modifications. These targeting molecules may bind to receptors on cell surfaces and 
enable MF-MNPs to specifically deliver into particular cells or tissues (Kai et al., 2011).
2.4.2.  Functionalization
Functionalization of MMNPs involves the addition or attachment of functional groups 
or molecules onto the surface of nanoparticles, which can introduce specific properties 
or capabilities to the MF-MNPs. Functionalization often involves chemical reactions 
to attach specific ligands, biomolecules, or other entities to the nanoparticles in order 
to provide MF-MNPs with particular functionalities, such as targeting specific cells, 
enhancing imaging contrast, or facilitating drug delivery (de Dios & Díaz-García, 2010).
Surface functionalization plays a pivotal role in enhancing MMNP functionality. 
Through biofunctionalization or chemical modifications, researchers impart specific 
properties to MMNPs, enabling targeted interactions with biological systems or facil￾itating compatibility in various applications. To make MMNPs suitable for biologi￾cal applications, their surfaces are functionalized through surfactant addition, which 
involves adsorbing amphiphilic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydro￾philic components on NP surfaces) or surfactant exchange, which involves the direct 
replacement of the original surfactant with a new bifunctional surfactant (Schladt 
et al., 2011). Various materials are used for coating NPs, including polymers such 
as lipids, proteins, dendrimers, gelatin, dextran, chitosan, pullulan, PEG, poly(eth￾ylene-co-vinyl acetate), PLGA, and poly(vinyl alcohol). For instance, multifunctional 
probes for sensitive imaging applications, including magnetic-fluorescent nanohy￾brids (FMNHs) conjugated with specific molecules effective for drug delivery and 
therapeutic efficiency (Hao et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2009). Additionally, poly (glycidyl

Multifunctional 
Magnetic Nanoparticles

3.1. INTRODUCTION
In the field of nanomaterials research, multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles 
(MNPs) are cutting edge. They incorporate a combination of magnetic strength 
and a variety of capabilities that surpass their conventional uses [1]. This investi￾gation starts with a look back at the development of magnetic nanoparticles over 
time, exploring their basic magnetic properties and eventual application in real￾world settings. The radical transition from single-function magnetic nanoparti￾cles to multifunctional versions represents a fundamental change in the study of 
nanomaterials, with an emphasis on purposeful engineering for a wider range of 
capabilities. Through customized surface alterations and functionalizations, this 
deliberate integration is accomplished, advancing MNPs into a field where their 
adaptability spans a variety of applications, from environmental remediation to bio￾medicine [2–4]. Modern research is highly interdisciplinary, with physicists, phar￾macists, biologists, and engineers working together to maximize the possibilities of 
MNPs and position them as cutting-edge scientific platforms. The transition from 
single-purpose magnetic nanoparticles to multipurpose ones is comparable to a par￾adigm change in science. In the past, studies concentrated on the inherent magnetic 
characteristics of nanoparticles; however, multifunctionality is a development away 
from this single focus. These days, nanoparticles are purposefully designed to have 
a variety of functions, expanding their current and possible uses [5–8]. This change 
is qualitative rather than just quantitative, and it represents a comprehensive reinter￾pretation of the function and potential of magnetic nanoparticles in nanomaterials 
research.
Multifunctional MNPs’ actual potential is found in their adaptability to a wide 
range of applications. These nanoparticles are revolutionary tools in biomedicine that 
can be used for magnetic hyperthermia treatment, targeted drug administration, and 
enhanced imaging methods including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [9,10]. 60 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
MNPs’ deliberate design makes it possible to deliver drugs with a level of accu￾racy and effectiveness that was formerly impossible. MNPs have a similar effect on 
advances in catalysis, sensors, and nanocomposites in the field of materials science. 
They are essential in catalytic applications because of their surface functions and 
customized characteristics, which improve selectivity and reactivity [11,12]. Their 
magnetic fingerprints also aid in the creation of extremely selective and sensitive 
sensors. Moreover, adding MNPs to nanocomposites improves their mechanical, 
electrical, and magnetic qualities, opening the door for novel materials with pre￾viously unheard-of qualities. Examining the many synthesis methods that allow 
for the deliberate creation of these nanoparticles is essential to comprehending 
multifunctional MNPs. The synthesis techniques, which range from cutting-edge 
physical techniques like high-energy ball milling and laser ablation to conventional 
chemical techniques including co-precipitation and sol–gel synthesis, are cru￾cial in modifying the size, composition, and form of MNPs. Furthermore, hybrid 
approaches such as Janus particles and core-shell architectures provide novel ways 
to realize multifunctionality. For instance, in an experiment, Drozdov et  al. [13] 
presented a methodology for creating multifunctional nanomaterials through the 
biomimetic polymerization of dopamine derivatives. Here, a mixture of dopamine 
conjugates was used to modify the magnetite nanoparticles, leading to the one-step 
production of multifunctional magneto-fluorescent nanocomposites. The resultant 
substance showed a normal in vivo biodistribution pattern for nanosized formula￾tions and remarkable biocompatibility at dosages up to 200 µg / mL. Antibodies 
targeting HER2 were coupled with the manufactured systems to improve selectivity 
against HER2-positive cancer cells. The resultant material could be used for tar￾geted medication delivery and dual magneto-optical in vivo research. Using X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) examination, the average crystallite size of the produced mag￾netic nanoparticles (MNPs) was revealed to be 10.3 nm, as shown in Figure 3.1a. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
imaging, as shown in Figure  3.1b, c, supported this conclusion. The material’s 
XRD pattern showed a primary peak at 35.58°
, which corresponded to the crys￾talline plane with Miller indices of (311). Other notable peaks, indicative of the 
magnetite crystalline phase, were found at 18.36°

No. R061111 ).
The mean hydrodynamic radius of the MNPs was determined to be 34 nm based 
on dynamic light scattering (DLS) data, and Figure 3.1d shows that the correspond￾ing zeta potential reached +29 mV. Previous studies have shown that the Fe(II)-OH 
groups on the interface of the MNPs were responsible for this higher zeta poten￾tial, which shifts the material’s isoelectric point to pH 8.2 (Figure 3.1e). The particle 
magnetization curve demonstrated the material’s superparamagnetic behavior, which 
means that in the lack of external magnetic fields, there was no residual magnetiza￾tion (Figure 3.1f). This description highlights the special qualities of the produced 
MNPs and their possible uses in a range of industries. The synthetic methodology 
that was presented provided a flexible and gentle method for producing a range of 
multifunctional hybrid nanomaterials.

Similarly, Lin et  al. [14] focused on the synthesis of a versatile nanoparticle 
platform designed for imaging, targeting, and synergistic cancer phototherapy. 
Reduced graphene oxide, nano zero-valent iron (nZVI), and polydopamine com￾pensate for the created nanoparticles (rGO). Polydopamine-conjugated nZVI/rGO 
(nZVI/rGO@pDA) was made by immobilizing nZVI on the surface of GO (nZVI/
GO) and then altering it with dopamine. With its capacity to attach proteins to 
cancer cells and absorb near-infrared radiation (NIR), this system exhibits great 
efficiency in photothermal and photodynamic cancer therapy, providing focused 
targeting of breast cancer cells. Under NIR irradiation (808 nm), the application 
of nZVI/rGO@pDA at a modest dose (10 µg/mL) caused irreversible damage to 
MCF-7 cells without causing cytotoxic effects in normal cells. Additionally, even at 
minimal intensities, nZVI/rGO@pDA demonstrated remarkable sensitivity in mag￾netic resonance imaging (MRI), matching that of nZVI@pDA. This new material 
combines the benefits of nZVI, rGO, and pDA, offering specialized targeting abil￾ities, good biocompatibility, and efficacy in cancer phototherapy and tumor imag￾ing. Treatment response was monitored by evaluating the MRI signal intensity of 
nZVI/rGO@pDA in phototherapeutic therapy. As such, this substrate exhibits great 
potential for obtaining therapeutic and imaging results in the phototherapy treat￾ment of breast cancer.
This chapter gives readers a thorough understanding of the synthesis processes 
used to create multifunctional MNPs and provides insights into the many strategies 
used in their manufacture. Beyond synthesis, the examination of the magnetic proper￾ties and surface features that affect MNP functions is part of the broader exploration.62 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
3.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL 
MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
3.2.1. Magnetic Properties
These magnetic characteristics are important since they are essential for customizing 
MNPs for certain uses. The foundation of MNP design is the comprehension and 
manipulation of these attributes, which allows researchers to tailor their behavior to 
the desired application [15–17]. The size, shape, and composition of the nanoparticles 
are among the variables that can affect the magnetic moment’s intensity and reac￾tivity, which is a crucial parameter. One important factor affecting MNPs’ magnetic 
behavior is their size. The consequences of quantum mechanics are more noticeable 
at the nanoscale, where MNPs may exhibit superparamagnetic behavior instead of 
ordinary ferromagnetism [18–20]. Because of its small size, thermal fluctuations are 
able to face electromagnetic anisotropy, which results in the absence of magnetic 
remanence when there is no external field. As a result, researchers may manipulate 
the behavior of MNPs by manipulating their size, which is directly related to how 
receptive they are to magnetic stimuli. Moreover, the magnetic properties of MNPs 
are largely determined by their shape. Different geometries, such as spherical or 
anisotropic forms including nanorods or nanocubes, affect how the magnetic dipoles 
are arranged inside the nanoparticles. The entire magnetic moment and the reaction 
to external magnetic fields are subsequently impacted by this. Engineers and sci￾entists can add a new level of customization to MNPs’ magnetic characteristics by 
modifying their shape to suit particular uses. Another important factor is the archi￾tecture of MNPs [21]. Researchers could adjust the magnetic properties of MNPs by 
selecting various magnetic materials and possibly adding nonmagnetic components. 
Because of the composition’s deliberate architecture, MNPs may perform a variety 
of tasks in a range of applications. This compositional control is also important for 
making sure MNPs meet industry standards, such as those in materials science and 
healthcare.
3.2.2.  Size, Shape, and Composition Control
In order to fully realize and optimize the unique capabilities of MNPs, control over 
their size, shape, and composition is an essential undertaking. A crucial factor that 
significantly affects MNPs’ magnetic activity within this complex interaction is their 
size [22–24]. The implications of quantum mechanics become more evident at the 
nanoscale, where smaller nanoparticles frequently display superparamagnetic behav￾ior. In this case, the loss of magnetic remanence occurs in the absence of an external 
magnetic field due to competition between thermal energy and magnetic anisotropy 
[25–28]. On the other hand, bigger nanoparticles might exhibit ferromagnetic prop￾erties, in which magnetic domains align and magnetization is maintained even in 
the absence of external stimulation. Researchers may customize MNPs to meet the 
unique needs of various applications by adjusting their size, which gives them a flexi￾ble ability to fine-tune their magnetic responses. Shape control gives the construction 
of MNPs an extra level of complexity beyond size. The morphological characteristics, Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 63
which might be spherical or anisotropic in shapes such as nanorods or nanocubes, are 
essential in controlling the magnetic response. The shape of the nanoparticles affects 
the arrangement of magnetic dipoles within them, which in turn affects the total mag￾netic moment. This form of control improves some functionality and diversifies the 
magnetic behaviors. For example, anisotropic forms can have more magnetic anisot￾ropy, which in some cases improves stability. The deliberate alteration of shape offers 
scientists a flexible toolkit to customize MNPs for particular applications, creating 
new opportunities for materials science, healthcare, and other fields [29–32].
Apart from their dimensions and form, MNPs’ composition is a crucial factor in 
determining their characteristics. This entails selecting magnetic materials carefully 
and, occasionally, adding nonmagnetic components. One of the most important fac￾tors affecting MNPs’ magnetic behavior and responsiveness is their composition. 
Researchers may obtain distinct magnetic qualities and hence enable variety in appli￾cations by varying the selection of magnetic materials. Nonmagnetic elements can 
also offer new functions or enhance biocompatibility, extending the applications of 
MNPs in a variety of disciplines. Because of this compositional control, scientists 
may precisely adjust the characteristics of MNPs to make sure they meet the require￾ments for the intended uses.
3.2.3.  Surface Modifications and Functionalization
The stability, biocompatibility, and usefulness of MNPs are significantly influenced 
by their surface features, which make them important variables. Understanding the 
critical role that the MNP surface plays, scientists use surface alterations and func￾tionalization techniques to give these nanoscale objects more adaptability so they 
may be easily incorporated into a wide range of applications. The application of 
biocompatible coatings on MNPs is a fundamental method for surface modifica￾tion. This entails covering the surface of the nanoparticle with substances like poly￾mers or surfactants [33–35]. The main goal is to provide colloidal stability, which is 
important for MNP behavior and dispersion, especially in biological settings. The 
biocompatible coating prevents MNPs from aggregating, preserving their unique 
characteristics and averting inadvertent interactions that could impair their func￾tionality. The possibility of using MNPs in biomedical applications—where stabil￾ity in physiological conditions is crucial—is made possible by this surface change. 
Additionally, the MNP surface’s deliberate functionalization offers a further degree 
of customization, enabling researchers to customize how their systems interact with 
external stimuli or biological systems. Usually, functionalization entails attaching 
particular molecules or ligands to the surface of nanoparticles to impart predefined 
functions. This deliberate alteration has great relevance in the field of biomedical 
applications. By selectively attaching themselves to the surface of MNPs, ligands 
can enable targeted drug delivery by attaching to and recognizing particular recep￾tors on the target cells’ surfaces. By reducing off-target effects, this focused strategy 
improves drug delivery’s accuracy and effectiveness.
Moreover, MNPs could be functionalized using biomolecules for imaging appli￾cations to improve contrast or offer particular targeting abilities. Imaging techniques, 64 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
like magnetic resonance imaging, can be made more particular by associating bio￾molecules that attach to specific tissues or cells. By carefully crafting the MNP sur￾face in this way, scientists can broaden the range of uses by adding a degree of 
functionality and specificity that is customized to meet the needs of many scientific 
and technical fields.
3.3. SYNTHESIS METHODS
3.3.1.  Chemical Methods
3.3.1.1. Co-precipitation
One of the fundamental chemical processes in the creation of multifunctional mag￾netic nanoparticles is co-precipitation [36–38]. With this method, metal salts are pre￾cipitated from a solution concurrently, resulting in the creation of nanoparticles. The 
technique is well-known for being easy to use and scalable, which makes it suitable 
for commercial and large-scale production. Co-precipitation is a simple process in 
which a precipitating agent is added to a solution containing metal ions to cause 
the production of solid particles. Nevertheless, even with its benefits, co-precipita￾tion presents difficulties in terms of attaining accurate control over the properties of 
the resultant MNPs [39,40]. It becomes essential to regulate variables like reaction 
temperature, pH, and precipitation rate in order to customize the size, composition, 
and form of the nanoparticles. Finding a balance between simplicity and the require￾ment for exact control over the synthesis process is inherently challenging. The dif￾ficult task of attaining accurate co-precipitation has consequences for the MNPs’ 
final functionality. For focused applications, particularly in the biomedical arena, 
careful control over shape and composition is crucial, and size homogeneity is essen￾tial for consistent magnetic characteristics. When using co-precipitation, researchers 
have to work around these complexities by adjusting reaction conditions and utiliz￾ing sophisticated procedures to produce manufactured MNPs with the necessary 
properties. In an experiment, Mikelashvili et al. [41] utilized a method employing 
chemical coprecipitation to synthesize Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated with citric acid. 
In an NH4OH base, ferrous and ferric salts were co-precipitated at a stoichiomet￾ric ratio of 1:1.9 with the additional benefit of ultrasonication (sonolysis) in a low 
vacuum setting. By using this method, the nanoparticles were produced in colloi￾dal suspensions, demonstrating their potential for a variety of uses in biomedical 
research. The nanoparticles were subjected to electrohydraulic discharges prior to 
the citric acid coating, which resulted in high discharge currents up to several tens 
of amperes. This electrohydraulic treatment was carried out with a pulsed direct 
current in a water medium. The result of this precoating process was a major factor 
in determining how the produced nanoparticles behaved. The generated magnetite 
nanoparticles were characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, which showed 
that the particle sizes were 25 nm, and XRD, which determined the average crys￾tallite diameter (D) of 25–28 nm. Superparamagnetic behavior was established in 
all samples by magnetometry analysis. Interestingly, after electrohydraulic process￾ing, citric acid-covered nanoparticles showed a greater saturation magnetization of 
58 emu/g than directly coated specimens, which showed a saturation magnetization Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 65
of 50 emu/g. Measurements of zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) 
clarified the hydrodynamic diameters and surface charges of the nanoparticles. The 
hydrodynamic diameters of the citric acid-covered nanoparticles were 93 and 115 nm, 
and their zeta potentials were −26 and −32  mV, respectively. In contrast, bare 
nanoparticles displayed larger hydrodynamic sizes at 226 nm and a zeta potential 
of 21 mV. Remarkably, the electrohydraulic discharge treatment played a pivotal role 
in enhancing citric acid coverage and improving the dispersion of the particles. This 
methodological development holds substantial promise for the synthesis of nanopar￾ticles tailored for applications in the biomedical field, showcasing potential advance￾ments in various biomedical applications.
Similarly, Azadpour et al. [42] conducted the synthesis and characterization of 
L-arginine-(Arg-) modified magnetite ( ) Fe3 4 O nanoparticles (RMNPs) through a 
streamlined one-step co-precipitation method. Following the initial synthesis, these 
aminated nanoparticles (NPs) underwent a meticulous coating process involving pre￾oxidized dextran (Dext), introducing aldehyde groups (DextCHO) onto the polymer 
chain through a robust chemical linkage. The key role of the amino acid, Arg, was to 
act as a mediator, establishing a chemical link between Dext and the magnetic core. 
The resulting Arg-modified and Dext-coated Fe3 4 O NPs underwent comprehen￾sive characterization employing various analytical techniques, including scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample mag￾netometer (VSM). The analyses confirmed the presence of a magnetite core in the 
synthesized samples, as corroborated by both XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra. The 
FT-IR results provided further validation of the chemical bonds associated with Arg 
and Dext within the samples. SEM imaging unveiled the spherical nature of the NPs 
with a well distributed size, while VSM analysis indicated the superparamagnetic 
behavior of the samples. Notably, the observed decrease in saturation magnetization 
post-Dext coating affirmed the successful application of the covalently bonded coat￾ing to RMNPs. Moreover, the TGA analysis revealed various levels of weight loss 
in the magnetic nanocomposites, providing concrete evidence for the modification 
of magnetic cores with Arg and the subsequent coating with Dext. This covalently 
bonded coating approach demonstrates significant potential for biomedical applica￾tions of magnetic nanoparticles. Figure 3.2 presents scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) images depicting the morphology of RMNPs and DextCHO-RMNPs. As 
illustrated in these images, the majority of MNPs exhibit a spherical shape. The 
average particle size is observed to be 47 nm for RMNPs and 59 nm for DextCHO￾RMNPs. This increase in particle size for DextCHO-RMNPs serves as confirmation 
that RMNPs have undergone a successful coating with Dext. Furthermore, the par￾ticle size distribution in DextCHO-RMNPs shows a more uniform pattern compared 
to RMNPs, as evident in the particle size distribution diagrams associated with both 
RMNPs and DextCHO-RMNPs.
Musat et al. [43] investigated the nanostructured composite materials based on 
iron oxides due to their potential for developing versatile thin films and membranes. 
These materials hold promise for various applications, including sustainable magnetic 
field adsorption, photocatalysis processes, intelligent coatings, packaging, and bio￾medical uses. This study specifically focused on the synthesis of superparamagnetic 66 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

iron oxide (core)–silica (shell) nanoparticles designed for functionalizing thin films 
and membranes. The nanoparticles were synthesized employing co-precipitation and 
ultrasonic-assisted sol–gel methods. The research delves into the combined influence 
of the magnetic core co-precipitation temperature (at 80 and 95°
C ) and ZnO-doping 
of the silica shell on the photocatalytic and nanosorption properties of the resulting 
composite nanoparticles. Remarkably, the adsorption and photodegradation constant 
rates observed for SiO2-shell functionalized nanoparticles were three to four times 
higher than those for the initial core iron oxide nanoparticles. The resulting mag￾netic nanoparticles (MNPs) were subjected to evaluation for their suitability in film 
deposition. This comprehensive exploration provides valuable insights into tailoring 
multifunctional nanomaterials for diverse applications in advanced technologies. 
Similarly, Khalid et  al. [44] focused on assessing the toxicity and neural uptake, Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 67
both in vitro and in vivo, of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO-NPs), 
which possess notable potential for diverse pharmaceutical applications due to their 
distinctive physical and chemical attributes. The principal aim of the study was 
to quantify the in vitro cytotoxicity of dextran-70,000-coated SPIO-NPs, whether 
labeled or unlabeled with rhodamine 123, in C6 glioma cells and primary hippocam￾pal neural cells. Additionally, the research aimed to scrutinize the in vitro and in vivo 
cellular uptake of labeled SPIO-NPs. The nanoparticles, synthesized using Massart’s 
co-precipitation method, exhibited an average size ranging from 10 to 50 nm and a 
polydispersity index of 0.37. The concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was assessed 
using the tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro￾mide (MTT). To discern the intracellular localization of SPIO-NPs, confocal laser 
microscopy was employed. In vivo, confocal neuroimaging (ICON) was conducted 
on male Wistar rats following intravitreal injection, and this was followed by ex 
vivo retina whole mount analysis. The outcomes indicated that, when subjected to 
in vitro testing at concentrations within the diagnostic and therapeutic dosage range, 
SPIO-NPs exhibited no cytotoxic effects on C6 glioma cells for up to 24 hours of 
incubation. The hippocampal cell culture similarly displayed unimpaired viability 
at low doses after a 24-hour incubation period. These results strongly suggest that 
the dextran-coated SPIO-NPs developed in this study hold promise for in vivo drug 
delivery applications.
3.3.1.2. Sol–Gel Synthesis
A flexible and effective chemical technique for creating multifunctional magnetic 
nanoparticles is sol–gel synthesis. This procedure entails turning a sol, or colloidal 
solution, into a gel, which is then dried to produce nanoparticles. The flexibility of 
sol–gel synthesis is seen in its capacity to precisely control the structure and com￾position of the final MNPs. The first step of the procedure is the production of a 
sol, which is the dispersion of precursor components in a liquid media. A regulated 
transition from this sol to a gel forms a network of interconnected particles in three 
dimensions [45,46]. After that, the gel is dried, forming MNPs with characteristics 
shaped by the original composition of the sol. The versatility of sol–gel synthesis in 
customizing MNP composition and structure is one of its main benefits. Researchers 
may fine-tune the size, shape, and content of the nanoparticles by varying param￾eters including precursor concentration, solvent type, and reaction circumstances. 
This degree of control is essential for customizing MNPs to fulfill unique needs for 
a range of applications [47–49]. Developing intricate MNP architectures is a par￾ticularly beneficial application of sol–gel synthesis. Multiple components can be 
included in the gel using this process, leading to the production of hybrids with a 
variety of functions, composite materials, and core-shell structures. Applications 
requiring multifunctionality, including targeted drug administration, imaging, or 
catalysis, require this complexity. The regulated attributes attained via sol–gel syn￾thesis augment the consistency and repeatability of MNPs, guaranteeing uniformity 
in their functional attributes and magnetic behavior. Consequently, sol–gel-produced 
MNPs find use in numerous industries where exact control over the characteristics 
of nanoparticles is essential. In an experiment, Adam et al. [50] focused on the sys￾tematic development of durable, consistent, and functional nanomaterials through a 68 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
simplified process, a critical factor for anticipating future applications. In the realm 
of porous materials, the ability to fine-tune nanoparticle properties—such as spe￾cific area, pore size, and morphology—by manipulating fundamental parameters 
like pH, temperature, or solvent is imperative. The principal objective of this study 
was to explore the controllable modulation of pore morphology in mesoporous silica 
(MS) nanoparticles (NPs) using the sol–gel reaction temperature (Tsg). The results 
underscored the facile customization of the pore morphology of MS NPs, both when 
existing independently and when forming a shell around iron oxide nanoparticles (IO 
NPs), through adjustments in Tsg. Specifically, Tsg governs the morphology, leading 
to either a stellar (ST) configuration characterized by large radial pores of approx￾imately 10 nm when below 80°C or a worm-like (WL) structure, featuring a small, 
randomly oriented pore channel network with 3–4 nm pore size when above 80°C. 
A  thorough comparison and discussion delve into the relaxometric and magneto￾thermal characteristics of IO@MS and IO@WLMS core-shell NPs, each showcasing 
stellar or worm-like morphologies, respectively. This analysis seeks to shed light on 
the pivotal role of pore structure in the context of MRI and magnetic hyperthermia 
applications. Similarly, Pogorilyi et al. [51] explored the utilization of sol–gel tech￾nology to fabricate versatile silica-based materials with specific functions for water 
purification, particularly targeting the removal of complex organic pollutants. The 
most effective approach involved using enzymatic reagents grafted onto nanocarri￾ers. However, a challenge arises as enzymes were easily deactivated in the presence 
of heavy metal cations. To address this issue, the research focused on preventing the 
inactivation of immobilized urease by Cu (II) and Cd (II) ions. This was achieved by 
employing magnetic nanoparticles equipped with additional complexonate functions, 
specifically diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA). TGA results indicate that 
the Fe3 4 O / SiO N 2 2 - - H DTPA nanoadsorbents contained up to 0.401 mmol/g of 
DTPA groups. In the concentration range of Ceq 0 = −50 mmol/L, the maximum 
adsorption capacities for Cu (II) and Cd (II) ions are determined to be 1.1 mmol/g and 
1.7 mmol/g, respectively. The Langmuir adsorption model fits well within the exper￾imental data at concentrations in the range of Ceq = − 0 10 mmol/L. The study also 
delves into the adsorption mechanisms for both cations. To enhance the stability and 
reusability of the adsorbent, 5 wt% of immobilized urease is cross-linked with glutar￾aldehyde. This process prevents enzyme loss in repeated use, maintaining unchanged 
activity for at least 18 cycles. Cross-linking at 10 wt% urease on particle surfaces 
results in a notable decrease in urea concentration from 20 mmol/L to 2 mmol/L
in up to 10 consecutive decomposition cycles. The presence of DTPA groups ensures 
that Cu2+ ions at a concentration of 1 µmol/L do not significantly impact urease 
activity. Overall, the magnetic Fe3 4 O / SiO N 2 2 - - H DTPA U - rease nanocom￾posite sorbents exhibit high potential for urease decomposition, even in the presence 
of heavy metal ions.
Vasilescu et al. [52] enhanced the catalytic performance and operational stabil￾ity of the commercial cellulase Cellic CTec2 by employing the sol–gel entrapment 
technique for immobilization. Furthermore, sol–gel entrapment with the deposition 
onto magnetic nanoparticles is incorporated, utilizing binary or ternary systems of 
silane precursors in combination with alkyl- or aryl-trimethoxysilanes at varying Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 69
molar ratios. The primary objective is to augment the catalytic efficiency of the cel￾lulase biocatalyst, particularly in the hydrolysis reaction of Avicel microcrystalline 
cellulose. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) emerges as a valuable tool for high￾lighting essential characteristics of the morphology of immobilized biocatalysts, 
offering insightful information about microstructure, porosity, and texture. These 
details bear significance as they can be correlated with the catalytic efficiency of 
the studied material. To analyze the impact of different precursor silanes and the 
immobilization method on the morphology of the sol–gel material with entrapped 
cellulase, an SEM characterization study was conducted. In Figure 3.3, SEM images 
at 10,000× magnification depict the results of this study. The entrapped biocatalyst 
(SG6), obtained through the direct sol–gel method using a binary system of precur￾sor silanes (PhTMOS:TMOS) at a molar ratio of 1:1, exhibits a porous structure with 
particles, some even submicrometric, densely packed (Figure 3.3a). Interestingly, the 
SEM image of the control sol–gel matrix (Figure 3.3b) shares similarities with that 
of the immobilized biocatalyst. On the other hand, the entrapped biocatalyst (SG9) 
produced with the ternary silane precursor system (VTMOS:PhTMOS:TMOS) at a 
molar ratio of 0.4:1.6:1, featuring a higher phenyl group content, displays a porous 
structure with smooth areas and tiny particles, generally less than 4 µm, adhering to 
the smooth surfaces of larger particles (Figure 3.3c). This specific structure correlates 
with favorable catalytic efficiency values observed in the CMC hydrolysis reaction. 
In contrast, the control gel exhibits a distinctly different morphology, characterized 
by block-like structures with nearly completely smooth surfaces and sharp edges.
Furthermore, as the concentration of phenyl groups in the sol–gel matrix decreases 
and the content of vinyl groups in the entrapped biocatalysts increases, SEM images 
(Figure 3.3e–f) reveal more compact structures. Spherical particles in these struc￾tures measure 5–10 µm and are situated on the compact surface of the matrix. This 
denser configuration is associated with a slightly lower catalytic efficiency, suggest￾ing that overly dense sol–gel matrices might impede the transfer of reactants and 
products, limiting the corresponding mass transfer. Furthermore, the study delved 
into investigating the impact of the reaction medium’s temperature and pH on the 
catalytic performance of the nanobiocatalysts, alongside assessing their operational 
stability under optimized conditions. The immobilized biocatalysts exhibited supe￾rior performance compared to their native cellulase counterparts. The most efficient 
magnetic cellulase biocatalyst is successfully reused in seven consecutive batch 
hydrolysis cycles of microcrystalline cellulose, consistently maintaining remanent 
activity values exceeding 40%. These promising findings suggest the feasibility of 
scaling up the process.
Kanagesan et al. [53] synthesized the antioxidant and cytotoxicity properties of 
copper ferrite ( ) CuFe2 4 O and zinc ferrite ( ) ZnFe2 4 O nanoparticles, using a sol–gel 
self-combustion method. The XRD patterns confirm the successful formation of 
copper ferrite and zinc ferrite, and TEM reveals average particle sizes of 56 nm for 
CuFe2 4 O and 68 nm for ZnFe2 4 O . Both types of nanoparticles exhibited ferromag￾netic behavior, with saturation magnetization values of 31 emu/l ( ) 50.63 Am / 2 Kg for 
copper ferrite and 28.8 Am / 2 Kg for zinc ferrite. Additionally, the synthesized fer￾rite nanoparticles demonstrate effective scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 70 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

of these spinel ferrite nanoparticles.Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 71
3.3.2. Physical Methods
3.3.2.1. High-Energy Ball Milling
High-energy ball milling is a well-known mechanical method for creating multi￾functional magnetic nanoparticles in the field of physical techniques. This technique 
is based on the idea that particles and milling balls colliding will cause mechanical 
stress and aid in the creation of MNPs. The capacity of high-energy ball milling 
to yield nanoparticles with regulated sizes and increased surface reactivity is what 
makes it significant. Precursor materials and milling balls are loaded into a mill￾ing chamber to start the operation. The particles receive mechanical energy from 
the high-speed spinning of the milling chamber, which causes them to break and 
become more refined into nanoscale dimensions [54–57]. The size dispersion of 
the resultant MNPs can be precisely controlled due to the regulated nature of this 
mechanical synthesis. Producing MNPs with regulated sizes is very helpful in appli￾cations where consistency is essential, such as obtaining reliable magnetic character￾istics. Furthermore, the increased surface reactivity of the nanoparticles produced by 
high-energy ball milling expands their use in a range of industries, such as biomed￾icine and catalysis. Nevertheless, careful evaluation of milling parameters is criti￾cal to the effectiveness of high-energy ball milling. The ball-to-powder proportion, 
milling time, and milling speed are important variables that affect the size, shape, 
and characteristics of the synthesized MNPs. A deep comprehension of the material 
system and the intended properties of the nanoparticles is necessary for optimizing 
these parameters [58–61]. When using high-energy ball milling, researchers have to 
walk a tightrope between attaining controlled synthesis and preventing unfavorable 
outcomes like overheating or particle aggregation. This necessitates a sophisticated 
method of parameter optimization to guarantee repeatability and dependability in the 
final MNPs. In an experiment, Batres et al. [62] focused on assessing the influence 
of the high-energy ball milling (HEBM) homogenization process on the phase dis￾tribution of hydroxyapatite-barium titanate (HA/BT) composite coatings developed 
through the air plasma spray technique (APS). The investigation includes a com￾parative analysis with coatings homogenized by mechanical stirring homogeniza￾tion (MSH). Different weight percentage ratios of BT in the HA matrix (10%, 30%, 
and 50% w/w) were examined for both the HEBM and MSH processes. In addition 
to structural analyses, the study investigated the mechanical properties and adhe￾sion strength of the coatings. Pull-out tests, following ASTM C633 standards, were 
employed to assess the degree of adhesion or bonding strength. Nanomechanical 
properties, including adhesive strength, cohesive/adhesive failure type, stiffness, 
elastic modulus, and hardness, were quantified through nanoindentation. The out￾comes revealed that HEBM powder processing demonstrated superior efficiency in 
achieving a more uniform phase distribution, with the 30% w( ) /w BT in the HA 
matrix exhibiting the best bonding strength performance and cohesive failure type. 
Figure 3.4 depicts representative EDS elemental mapping for both the surface and 
cross section of the HA/BT coatings. The backscattered electron (BSE) micrographs 
highlight brighter regions in the coating, and according to the elemental mapping 
results, these areas correspond to the barium titanate (BT) phase present in the 
coatings. The EDS elemental mapping provides valuable insights into the spatial 72 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

distribution of elements, particularly emphasizing the distinct regions correspond￾ing to the BT phase within the coating structure. Furthermore, HEBM-treated coat￾ings showed slightly greater crystal phase stability and reduced crystal shrinkage 
compared to MSH. The nanomechanical properties of the coatings processed with 
HEBM, including enhanced adhesive strength and cohesive/adhesive failure type, 
stiffness, elastic modulus, and hardness, indicate the positive impact of this tech￾nique on optimizing the overall performance of the HA/BT composite coatings.
Ahmadi et al. [63] introduced a groundbreaking method for the large-scale pro￾duction of functionalized molybdenum disulfide ( ) MoS2 nanosheets tailored for 
integration into polymer nanocomposites. MoS2 nanosheets, widely acknowledged 
as a significant counterpart to graphene, have gained substantial attention owing to 
their distinctive properties that find applications across various advanced technolog￾ical domains. Despite the considerable interest, achieving the simultaneous synthesis 
and functionalization of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets on a sustainable and large scale has 
presented persistent challenges. To overcome these challenges, the research employs 
a hydrothermal-assisted ball milling approach, strategically designed to mitigate lat￾eral size reduction issues encountered during the ball milling process. The hydro￾thermal treatment serves to minimize the adverse effects of breaking mechanisms 
on the dimensions of the nanosheets. Notably, the hydrothermal pretreatment induces 
the initial intercalation of an organic molecule, such as 4,4-diaminodiphenyl sul￾fone (DDS), within the stacked MoS2 sheets. This intercalation process significantly 
enhances horizontal shear forces, promoting sliding and peeling mechanisms during Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 73
the subsequent low-energy ball milling. The collaborative application of these tech￾niques yields the production of 2H functionalized MoS2 nanosheets. The synthesized 
nanosheets exhibit a few layers with an average lateral dimension surpassing 640 
nm, an ultrathin thickness of approximately ~6 nm, and an impressive surface area 
reaching ~121.8 m2 /g. These remarkable characteristics, combined with the incor￾poration of functional groups, unlock the complete reinforcing potential of MoS2
nanosheets, making them highly effective in enhancing the mechanical properties of 
diverse polymeric matrices.
Chakraborty et al. [64] investigated the magnetic properties of nanocomposites, 
specifically those comprising SmCo5 alloy powders with an additional 10 wt% Fe, 
introducing an innovative approach that involves utilizing recycled materials. The 
precursor, SmCo5, is derived from magnets recycled through the hydrogen decrepita￾tion process. A comprehensive investigation is conducted, drawing comparisons with 
samples processed from pristine SmCo5 raw material. The synthesis methodology 
incorporated dry high-energy ball-milling followed by subsequent heat treatment. 
The findings highlight a robust soft/hard exchange coupling, characterized by a sig￾nificant coercivity—a fundamental attribute for the development of commercially 
viable permanent magnets. Notably, the energy products derived from the recycled 
material range from 80% to 95% in comparison to those obtained from virgin 
SmCo5, depending on the specific durations of milling and annealing. This under￾scores the potential of recycling practices and emphasizes the sustainability inherent 
in the production methods. Consequently, the synthesized powders and associated 
processes emerge as promising contenders for the evolution of specialized and 
nanostructured exchange-coupled bulk industrial magnets in the future. Similarly, 
Zhang et al. [65] determined the influence of high energy ball milling (HEBM) and 
a specialized dispersant on the capacitive properties of γ - Fe O2 3 –carbon nanotube 
(MWCNT) composites. Conducted at McMaster University, the study is motivated by 
the escalating interest in ferrimagnetic materials and composites boasting electrical 
capacitance. The overarching goal was to enhance capacitive properties while con￾currently minimizing electrical resistance in pursuit of multifunctional devices. The 
composites, meticulously crafted from γ - Fe O2 3 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
(MWCNTs) through a colloidal processing approach, undergo thorough evaluation 
for their potential in energy storage within the negative electrodes of supercapaci￾tors. Notably, the integration of HEBM into the synthesis of ferrimagnetic γ - Fe O2 3
nanoparticles plays a pivotal role in elevating capacitive properties. The study metic￾ulously examines the resulting particle morphology, shedding light on the intricacies 
of this enhancement process. Gallocyanine assumes a crucial role as a co-dispersant 
for γ - Fe O2 3 and MWCNTs. Leveraging its polyaromatic structure and catechol 
ligand, gallocyanine adeptly adheres to γ - Fe O2 3 and MWCNTs. This unique inter￾action facilitates electrostatic dispersion and thorough mixing of the components, a 
phenomenon intricately discussed in the study. In the 0.5 M Na S2 4 O electrolyte, the 
composites, where γ - Fe O2 3 undergoes high-energy ball milling and is co-dispersed 
with MWCNTs using gallocyanine, attain an exceptional capacitance of 1.53 Fcm-2 . 
This achievement was indicative of the success of HEBM and colloidal processing 
strategies in fostering high capacitance at remarkably low electrical resistance. The 
demonstrated efficiency in charge–discharge processes positions these synthesized 74 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
composites as promising candidates for the fabrication of advanced multifunctional 
devices. Their potential is underscored by the synergistic interplay between fer￾rimagnetic and capacitive properties, paving the way for innovative applications in 
various technological domains.
3.3.2.2. Laser Ablation
Laser ablation is a highly advanced physical technique that is particularly useful for 
synthesizing multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles. It is characterized by excellent 
purity and precision. This technique creates nanoparticles by applying laser pulses 
to a targeted material, causing ablation. Because it can create MNPs with very little 
contamination, laser ablation is especially valued for providing a route for applica￾tions where purity is critical [66,67]. A concentrated laser beam is first utilized to 
strike a target substance in a controlled setting, usually a metal. The target material 
vaporizes and then condenses into nanoparticles as a result of the high-energy laser 
pulses. The main benefit of laser ablation is that it can produce MNPs without the 
need for extra solvents or chemical precursors, which reduces the possibility that 
the finished product would contain contaminants. The exact control that laser abla￾tion provides over the size and makeup of the manufactured MNPs is one of its key 
advantages. Scientists can adjust variables like laser power, length, and wavelength to 
customize the properties of the nanoparticles. This degree of control guarantees con￾sistency in the composition and size dispersion, which enhances the MNPs’ repeat￾ability and dependability.
Laser ablation is especially well suited for applications requiring high purity, such 
as in medical or technological devices, because of its little contamination. Since 
no chemical precursors or solvents are involved, there are no worries about left￾over contaminants, making laser-ablated MNPs a desirable option for applications 
where material integrity is crucial [68,69]. Although laser ablation is praised for its 
accuracy and purity, rigorous laser parameter adjustment is necessary for successful 
deployment. It is crucial to adjust variables such as laser fluence and repetition rate 
to attain the intended attributes of nanoparticles while maintaining the integrity of 
the synthesis method. For instance, in an experiment, Popov et al. [70] focused on 
the innovative laser-ablative synthesis of ultrapure magneto-plasmonic core-satel￾lite nanocomposites designed specifically for biomedical applications. The proposed 
methodology involves laser ablation from an Fe target in the presence of previously 
ablated water-dispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs). This intricate process yields bare 
(ligand-free) core-satellite nanostructures characterized by a substantial Fe-based 
core, intricately adorned with smaller Au NPs (mean size 7.5 nm). The Fe-based 
core contributes to a robust magnetic response in the nanostructures, demonstrating 
a magnetization exceeding 12.6 emu/g. Simultaneously, the Au NPs-based satellite 
shell plays a crucial role by providing a broad extinction peak centered at 550 nm. 
This peak extends into the near-infrared region, aligning strategically with the rela￾tive tissue transparency range of 650–950 nm. The study delves into the underlying 
mechanisms governing the formation of these magnetic-plasmonic nanocomposites. 
Recognizing the importance of colloidal stability in biological environments, the 
research introduces a protocol involving the coating of core-satellites with various 
polymers. These nanocomposites, free from toxic impurities, exhibit a harmonious Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 75
blend of robust magnetic and plasmonic responses, making them highly promising 
for diverse biomedical applications. Such applications include cutting-edge therapies 
like photo- and magneto-induced treatments, magnetic resonance imaging, and pho￾toacoustic imaging. Beyond showcasing an innovative synthesis approach, the study 
underscores the versatility and potentially transformative impact of these nanocom￾posites in advancing the field of biomedical technologies. Similarly, Ahmed et al. 
[71] employed a pulsed laser ablation technique to customize two distinct nanofi￾brous scaffolds, namely those based on cellulose acetate (CA) and Polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA). To enhance their properties, these scaffolds were augmented with magne￾tite nanoparticles (MNPs) and varied concentrations of graphene oxide (GO). Upon 
meticulous examination of the surface morphology, nanofibers with the highest GO 
content in CA exhibited diameters spanning from 45 to 180 nm and 450 to 850 nm, 
while those in PVA showcased dimensions ranging from 115 nm to 315 nm. The 
incorporation of GO sheets was observed to be uniform within the scaffolds, with 
dimensions ranging from 23.3 × 23 µm to 26.6 × 35 µm . Notably, the maximum 
roughness peak height (Rp) exhibited an exponential surge with the addition of GO, 
underscoring the significant impact of GO on surface characteristics. Furthermore, 
assessments of cell viability emphasized the high biocompatibility of the scaffolds. 
Exploration of HFB4 cell line attachments provided insights into the uniform adher￾ence and proliferation of cells throughout the scaffolds. These compelling findings 
highlight the considerable potential of these nanofibrous scaffolds for a broad spec￾trum of applications, with a particular emphasis on their suitability for wound heal￾ing and dressing purposes.
Dadashi et al. [72] focused on the structural and optical features of nanoparti￾cles derived from both pure iron and iron oxide, synthesized through the advanced 
pulsed Nd:YAG laser ablation technique implemented in liquid media. The intrinsic 
significance of iron and its oxides in catalytic, magnetic, and biomedical applica￾tions, including drug delivery, hyperthermia, and contrast agents, underscores the 
relevance of this study. The laser ablation method, known for its versatility and 
efficacy in generating nanoparticles, involves the interaction of a laser with a tar￾get in a liquid medium. In this study, deionized water and acetone were chosen as 
the liquid media for synthesizing pure iron and iron oxide nanoparticles. Deionized 
water, being a fundamental component in various chemical solutions, and acetone, 
a straightforward organic liquid often used as a solvent for polymers, offer flexibil￾ity in the synthesis process. The ablation process utilized a Q-switched Nd:YAG 
laser with specific parameters, including a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm, an 
energy output of 180 mJ/pulse, and a pulse duration of 12 ns. The laser operated at a 
repetition rate of 10 Hz for a duration of 10 minutes, and, to ensure uniform ablation 
and prevent texturing effects, the pure iron target underwent manual rotation. It is 
noteworthy that the nanoparticles exhibited a predominantly spherical shape, with an 
aspect ratio close to 1. The average particle sizes in deionized water and acetone were 
measured at 26 nm and 14 nm, respectively. XRD results elucidated the formation 
of pure iron nanoparticles and a mixture of iron oxide nanoparticles in acetone and 
deionized water, respectively. The UV-visible spectrum of colloidal nanoparticles 
in acetone demonstrated the characteristic optical extinction of iron nanoparticles. 
Furthermore, the optical absorption of nanoparticles synthesized in deionized water 76 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
showcased an absorption edge used for bandgap calculation. This study not only 
provides insights into the mechanism of nanoparticle formation but also delves into 
aspects of stability and oxidation. The findings emphasize the potential of this rapid 
and adaptable synthesis method for producing pure iron and iron oxide nanoparti￾cles, with specific relevance to applications in the biological domain. Similarly, Ali 
et al. [73] focused on the synthesis and characterization of CuCo2 4 O nanoparticles 
(NPs) through the laser ablation of a copper-cobalt alloy ingot, aiming to explore 
their multifunctional capabilities. Nanoparticles, owing to their diverse features 
within a single assembly, offer considerable potential across various applications. 
The initial qualitative examination of the arc-melted copper-cobalt ingot sample uti￾lized laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The subsequent synthesis of 
CuCo2 4 O NPs involved employing the alloy as a target material for Nd:YAG laser 
ablation, a process that yielded nanoparticles with distinctive magnetic properties. 
The magnetic characteristics of the synthesized NPs were meticulously studied 
using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). TEM and DLS analyses revealed the 
nanoparticles’ spherical nature with average sizes of 32 nm and 28 nm, respectively. 
In addition to their structural and magnetic properties, the antibacterial activity of 
CuCo2 4 O nanoparticles was evaluated against S. aureus and E. coli strains, serving 
as positive and negative controls, respectively. The nanoparticles exhibited nonmuta￾genic potential against S. typhimurium TA - 98 and TA -100 strains. Furthermore, 
the study explored the potential of CuCo2 4 O nanofluid in magnetic hyperthermia 
applications. Specific absorption rates (SAR) of 4 5. 7 and 5.17 W / g were deter￾mined for magnetic field strengths of 230 µT and 247 µT, respectively. Additionally, 
the size and morphology of the synthesized CuCo2 4 O nanoparticles were scruti￾nized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), depicted in Figure 3.5a. The 
associated histogram, presented in Figure 3.5b, reveals an average particle size of 32 
nm based on the TEM image. It is noteworthy that the reported particle size ranges 
from 30 nm to 90 nm, while spherical microstructures exhibit an average diameter of 
20 nm, and nanorods showcase sizes within the range of 10–20 nm.
This research not only sheds light on the antibacterial properties of the synthe￾sized nanoparticles but also emphasizes their promising applications in magnetic 
hyperthermia. The multifaceted attributes of CuCo2 4 O NPs position them as versa￾tile candidates for a wide range of biomedical and technological applications, show￾casing their potential impact in various fields.

3.3.3.1. Core-Shell Structures
Core-shell architectures stand out as a trademark in MNP development, and hybrid 
techniques offer a flexible and complex method for the production of multifunctional 
magnetic nanoparticles. By encasing a magnetic core in a functional shell, this novel 
technique produces a synergistic combination of the magnetic characteristics of the 
core and the customized functionalities of the shell. The magnetic core gives the 
nanoparticles a strong base. It is often made of materials like iron oxide that have 
exceptional magnetic properties. Encircling the magnetic core, the functional shell 
provides a layer that may be precisely built to satisfy application-specific needs. The 
 Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 77
shell may include components that improve biocompatibility, offer certain chemical 
functions, or permit interactions with biological systems, depending on the desired 
usage. The purposeful pairing of core and shell results in improved multifunction￾ality, stability, and biocompatibility. Because the core-shell construction serves as 
a barrier, inhibiting aggregation, and protecting the magnetic core from outside 
effects, it improves stability in MNPs [74–76]. For applications where MNPs are 
exposed to challenging chemical or biological environments, this stability is essen￾tial. Furthermore, the inclusion of a biocompatible shell improves MNPs’ compati￾bility with live tissues, which is important for medical applications.
The multifunctionality of core-shell systems is one of their most attractive features. 
By customizing the shell to hold therapeutic payloads, imaging agents, or targeting 
ligands, researchers can increase the versatility of MNPs in a variety of applications. 
Because of their versatility, core-shell MNPs are essential for developing tailored 
medication delivery, imaging methods, and other cutting-edge applications.
3.3.3.2. Janus Particles
An innovative hybrid approach that stands out in the field of multifunctional mag￾netic nanoparticles (MNPs) is the Janus particle design. These particles exhibit a 
unique duality consisting of two separate sides, each with unique features. This novel 
method opens up a wide range of applications in materials science and biomedicine 
by enabling one side to display magnetic behavior while the other side has particular 
functions. The Roman deity with two faces, from which the term “Janus” originates, 
symbolizes a dual nature in the context of MNPs. The ability of the magnetic side to 
respond to external magnetic fields allows for targeted delivery and precise manip￾ulation [77,78]. Conversely, the functional side is painstakingly designed to possess 
attributes specific to the intended use, promoting a well balanced combination of 
magnetic and functional qualities. The ability of Janus particles to be multifunc￾tional due to their careful design is one of their distinguishing features. Through 
the smooth integration of customized functions with magnetic responsiveness, these 
particles are transformed into multipurpose instruments. Janus MNPs, for instance, 
FIGURE 3.5 (a) TEM image of laser-synthesized nanoparticles. (b) Corresponding histogram 
(Adapted from Ref. [73] under CC BY 4.0).78 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
demonstrate the versatility of this hybrid approach in biomedical applications by 
using their magnetic side to enable targeted drug delivery or imaging and their func￾tional side to support particular cellular interactions.
Janus MNPs are particularly promising in the biological domain. Their functional 
side improves interactions with biological systems, while their magnetic responsive￾ness directs exact delivery within the body. In the context of customized medicine, 
where Janus MNPs could be precisely tailored to meet individual patient demands 
and maximize treatment effects, this flexibility is extremely significant. Janus MNPs 
have uses in materials science and biomedicine in addition to sensing, materials engi￾neering, and catalysis. These particles’ special potential to accelerate developments 
in a variety of material applications stems from their mix of customized capabilities 
and magnetic responsiveness, demonstrating the wide range of opportunities made 
possible by the Janus particle hybrid method.
3.4. APPLICATIONS IN BIOMEDICINE
3.4.1.  Targeted Drug Delivery
Targeted medication delivery is one of the innovative uses of MNPs in biomedicine. 
MNPs could be functionalized with ligands that recognize particular cells or tis￾sues, and they are precisely tailored to carry therapeutic payloads. Because MNPs 
functionalize with ligands, tailored medication delivery employing them is highly 
effective. These ligands are specifically selected to bind and recognize target cells or 
tissues with high specificity, adding a level of accuracy that is frequently absent from 
conventional drug delivery techniques. MNPs can precisely localize therapeutic sub￾stances by selectively homing in on target locations thanks to the functionalization 
process. The magnetic characteristics of MNPs activate once they arrive at their 
intended location, providing a special method for regulated medication release [79]. 
MNPs could be adjusted to discharge their therapeutic payloads exactly where they 
are needed, under the effect of an external magnetic field. The capacity to release 
drugs on desire gives the delivery procedure an extra degree of control and guaran￾tees that therapeutic substances are administered precisely when needed. The field 
of cancer therapy appears to be particularly promising for this targeted drug delivery 
approach. Through the utilization of ligand-functionalized MNPs, physicians could 
target therapeutic medicines precisely to malignant cells, while reducing uninten￾tional harm to healthy tissues. By focusing the medication at the tumor site, the con￾trolled drug release method increases the therapeutic efficacy even further.
The benefits of employing MNPs for tailored drug delivery transcend beyond 
improved therapeutic effectiveness. Traditional medication delivery systems can dra￾matically reduce systemic side effects by focusing the therapeutic payload on the tar￾get region. The entire effectiveness of treatment and the degree of patient tolerance 
are enhanced by this decrease in off-target effects. Furthermore, MNPs’ precision 
in drug delivery makes it possible to provide more individualized care. A degree 
of personalization consistent with precision medicine is possible by adjusting the 
ligands and magnetic properties of MNPs to the unique features of a patient’s illness. 
This individualized method could lead to better results and fewer side effects, which 
would be a major improvement in the field of medicine.Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 79
3.4.2. Magnetic Hyperthermia
One notable use of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in biomedicine is 
magnetic hyperthermia, which provides a focused and the least intrusive method for 
therapeutic interventions, especially in the treatment of cancer. This creative tactic 
makes use of MNPs’ special capacity to produce heat in the presence of an exter￾nal magnetic field. MNPs are injected into the target tissue, which is frequently the 
tumor location, in the setting of magnetic hyperthermia. The precise design of these 
nanoparticles guarantees their efficient distribution in the target tissue. After the 
MNPs are placed correctly, an external alternating magnetic field is implemented 
[80–82]. The MNPs rapidly oscillate in response to this alternating magnetic field, 
which allows them to absorb energy from the field. Importantly, the MNPs transform 
the received energy into heat, which causes a localized rise in body temperature 
within the target tissue. Significant therapeutic ramifications stem from this regu￾lated hyperthermia, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. A focused strat￾egy to eliminate malignant tissues with the least amount of damage to surrounding 
healthy cells is made possible by the selective heating of tumor cells.
The efficacy of magnetic hyperthermia resides in its capacity to take advantage 
of the intrinsic variations in temperature sensitivity between healthy and malignant 
cells. Due to their accelerated growth and frequently damaged vasculature, tumor 
cells are more vulnerable to heat-induced damage than healthy cells. The MNPs 
rapidly oscillate in response to this alternating magnetic field, which allows them to 
absorb energy from the field. Importantly, the MNPs transform the received energy 
into heat, which causes a localized rise in body temperature within the target tissue. 
Significant therapeutic ramifications stem from this regulated hyperthermia, partic￾ularly in the framework of cancer treatment. A focused strategy to eliminate malig￾nant tissues with the least amount of damage to surrounding healthy cells is made 
possible by the selective heating of tumor cells.
3.4.3.  Imaging and Diagnostic Tools
MNPs are essential for improving diagnostic and imaging instruments because they 
provide better functionality and contrast in a variety of imaging modalities.
3.4.3.1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are essential as very efficient con￾trast agents in magnetic resonance imaging in the field of medicine. This applica￾tion uses the intrinsic magnetic properties of MNPs to improve the contrast in MRI 
images, giving medical professionals a strong tool for precise and in-depth imaging 
of diseased diseases and anatomical structures. The local magnetic field within the 
imaging region is changed by the magnetic characteristics of MNPs. This change 
makes MRI pictures more contrast-rich, making it easier to distinguish between var￾ious tissues and structures. MNPs improve the general quality of MRI imaging as a 
result, giving doctors a more intricate and nuanced picture of the internal anatomy 
[83,84]. MNPs stand out in MRI applications due in large part to their adaptabil￾ity. MNPs’ surfaces can be functionalized with targeted ligands to precisely tune 
them for particular diagnostic uses. The amount of specificity imparted by this 80 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
functionalization surpasses that of conventional contrast agents. MNPs improve the 
precision of diagnostic imaging by enabling focused imaging of the targeted loca￾tions by the attachment of ligands that bind preferentially to particular tissues or 
cells.
MNPs’ unique imaging properties are very promising for creating individualized 
and focused diagnostic strategies. Clinicians use contrast agents in standard MRIs, 
which increase contrast in a broad way over the imaging region. On the other hand, 
MNPs’ functionalized surfaces allow for a more focused and targeted strategy. This 
enables the detection and characterization of targeted locations by highlighting par￾ticular tissues or cells of interest with better clarity. Furthermore, one noteworthy 
development made possible by MNPs in MRI is the capacity to create customized 
diagnostic strategies. Through the customization of MNPs to specifically target bio￾markers or traits particular to an individual’s disease, physicians can progress toward 
a more accurate and individualized diagnosis. This is in line with the changing con￾cept of personalized medicine, which bases diagnoses and treatments on the particu￾lar characteristics of each patient.
3.4.3.2. Fluorescence Imaging
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles have a wide range of applications in bio￾medical imaging, one of which is fluorescence imaging. By partnering with fluores￾cent dyes, MNPs play a crucial role in this method’s production of multifunctional 
probes, opening the door to real-time molecular-level biological process viewing. 
When MNPs are combined with fluorescent dyes, multifunctional probes are created 
that, in response to external stimuli, release certain signals. The capacity to image 
fluorescence provides never-before-seen insights into the complex molecular land￾scapes found within living systems [85–87]. MNPs serve as fluorescent dye carriers, 
making it possible to see cellular and subcellular structures and conduct a thorough 
analysis of dynamic processes. MNPs’ ability to respond to outside stimuli is one 
noteworthy feature in fluorescence imaging that helps to explain their multifunc￾tionality as probes. Fluorescent dyes combined with MNPs produce unique signals 
under certain light-related situations or when exposed to certain light wavelengths. 
This responsiveness improves MNPs’ versatility for a range of applications, enabling 
researchers to customize their use in accordance with the particular demands of the 
imaging situation.
In several biomedical scenarios, the real-time visualization of fluorescence imag￾ing made possible by MNPs is used. For example, the capacity of MNPs to offer 
real-time, dynamic feedback throughout surgeries is advantageous for intraopera￾tive imaging. Surgeons can traverse and identify particular tissues more precisely 
by using fluorescence-labeled MNPs, which could lead to better surgical outcomes. 
Furthermore, MNPs with fluorescence properties are essential for observing how 
nanoparticles behave in biological systems. This is especially true in the realm of 
nanomedicine, where the distribution and fate of nanoparticles play a crucial role 
in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. By incorporating MNPs into flu￾orescence imaging methods, scientists can follow the path of these tiny particles 
and learn important details about how they interact with and distribute across living 
things. Fluorescence imaging’s sensitivity is increased when MNPs are incorporated, Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 81
and it also helps to increase the specificity of detection. Researchers can target cer￾tain proteins or structures of interest by customizing MNPs with specific fluorescent 
dyes, allowing for a more targeted and selective imaging method. This increased 
specificity and sensitivity marks a breakthrough in therapeutic and diagnostic moni￾toring, where accuracy is crucial.
3.5. ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS
3.5.1.  Removal of Contaminants
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have become extremely effective 
and adaptable instruments in the field of environmental applications, especially when 
it comes to the vital duty of eliminating pollutants from soil and water. Meticulously 
designed, MNPs exhibit remarkable adsorption capabilities, making them powerful 
tools for eliminating a wide range of contaminants that pose a risk to ecosystem 
health. MNPs’ intrinsic magnetic qualities greatly add to their usefulness in envi￾ronmental remediation. Because MNPs are magnetic, they can be easily retrieved 
from contaminated environmental matrices [88,89]. This characteristic is essential 
to developing a reusable and effective decontamination method. An external mag￾netic field could be used to precisely gather the nanoparticles and the pollutants that 
the MNPs have absorbed once they have done so. This simple rescue method adds 
to the entire sustainability of the remediation endeavor while also streamlining the 
decontamination process. Furthermore, the capacity of MNPs to be customized via 
surface functionalization adds to their efficacy in the elimination of contaminants. 
Through surface modification, researchers can tailor MNPs’ chemical characteris￾tics and improve their affinity for particular pollutants. Functionalization makes it 
possible to remove pollutants including organic compounds, heavy metals, and other 
dangerous substances on a targeted basis. MNPs’ customized specificity guarantees 
that they will bind to the problematic contaminants with preference, offering the 
accuracy needed for successful environmental rehabilitation [90,91].
There is a great deal of promise in using MNPs to remove contaminants in order 
to address urgent environmental issues. Hazards to human health and ecosystems 
are posed by heavy metals and organic pollutants, which are frequently caused by 
industrial processes, agricultural runoff, or inappropriate waste disposal. MNPs pro￾vide a flexible and effective way to reduce these hazards by giving you the ability 
to isolate and concentrate pollutants from various environmental media. Moreover, 
the significant feature of MNPs in environmental applications is their sustainability. 
Because of their reusable nature, which is made possible by magnetic retrieval, reme￾diation agents don’t need to be constantly replenished or disposed of. This improves 
the financial viability of environmental cleaning initiatives and is consistent with 
sustainable and environmentally friendly methods.
3.5.2.  Catalysis for Environmental Remediation
MNPs are essential and transformational in environmental remediation cataly￾sis, in addition to their involvement in pollutant removal. MNPs’ unique surface 82 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
characteristics and magnetic responsiveness make them perfect catalysts for a range 
of procedures meant to reduce pollution and enhance environmental quality. MNPs 
are suitable for functionalization with catalytic materials due to their distinct sur￾face characteristics. This facilitates their active involvement in degradation reac￾tions, which in turn promotes the breakdown of contaminants within the matrix. 
When MNPs are equipped with catalytic capability, they can be effective catalysts 
for chemical transformations that help clean up wastewater and industrial effluents. 
MNPs’ catalytic activity comes into play especially when conventional remediation 
techniques are insufficient. Wastewater and industrial effluents can include complex 
mixes of contaminants, such as refractory materials that defy traditional treatment 
techniques and persistent organic chemicals. With their specialized catalytic func￾tions, MNPs provide a flexible and effective way to deal with these problems by 
encouraging the breakdown and conversion of stubborn pollutants [92,93].
The ability of MNPs to respond to external magnetic fields is a noteworthy 
characteristic of environmental catalysis. Because of their reactivity, MNPs can be 
selectively manipulated and guided to particular locations inside contaminated envi￾ronments. MNPs could be focused on specific regions by using an external magnetic 
field, guaranteeing a highly focused and effective catalytic remediation strategy. This 
spatial precision adds to the entire efficacy of environmental cleanup activities, espe￾cially in situations where pollutants are isolated or where concentrated treatment is 
required. The use of MNPs in environmental catalysis highlights how well suited 
they are to solve pollution issues and promote environmentally friendly behaviors. 
Researchers and environmental professionals can create customized methodologies 
for treating contaminants by utilizing the catalytic properties of MNPs, leading to 
more effective and environmentally sustainable remediation techniques. Moreover, 
the application of MNPs in environmental catalysis is consistent with larger initia￾tives to switch to sustainable methods. Their capacity to engage in focused and effi￾cient catalytic reactions raises the efficacy of remediation procedures overall and 
advances the creation of environmentally friendly and long-lasting solutions for envi￾ronmental cleaning.
3.6. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
MNPs show great potential in a variety of applications; yet several obstacles prevent 
them from being seamlessly integrated. For safe deployment, biocompatibility and 
possible toxicity issues, particularly in biomedical situations, demand a thorough 
examination. Large-scale use is hampered by scalability and production costs, which 
calls for the development of affordable and scalable synthesis techniques. In com￾plex biological or environmental environments, stability concerns and the tendency 
to aggregate necessitate solutions to guarantee long-term functionality [94–96]. It 
is still difficult to achieve targeting precision, particularly in biomedical applica￾tions. This requires improvements in surface functionalization and targeting ligand 
design. Furthermore, ethical and regulatory frameworks need to change to ensure the 
responsible use of MNPs across industries.
Several new trends and orientations present promising opportunities for the future. 
New developments in synthesis methods, such as green synthesis and bottom-up Synthesis of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles 83
approaches, are intended to improve repeatability and solve scaling problems. 
Improving MNPs for drug delivery, imaging, and environmental cleanup requires 
improved surface functionalization, which includes the integration of biomolecules. 
Combination therapies offer more individualized and efficient interventions by uti￾lizing the synergies between therapeutic drugs and MNPs. Precision medicine is 
about to undergo a revolution thanks to MNPs, which are intelligent and sensitive 
and can be used for stimuli-triggered medication release and imaging. Furthermore, 
the theranostic potential of MNPs in conjunction with developments in in vivo imag￾ing portends a new era of real-time monitoring in personalized medicine. MNPs’ 
potential for use in pollution control and cleanup is supported by their incorporation 
into environmental sensing platforms for real-time monitoring [97–99]. Materials 
science, environmental technology, and medicine will all advance as a result of 
MNPs working together with companies and researchers to manage these trends and 
problems.
3.7. CONCLUSION

nanoparticles since multifunctional versions have opened up a wide range of applica￾tions in materials science, biomedicine, and the environment. MNPs are incredibly 
versatile due to their precise engineering. Their special blend of magnetic properties 
and customized features make them effective instruments for targeted medication 
delivery, imaging, treating hyperthermia, and environmental cleanup. This chapter 
offers a thorough overview of the latest advancements in MNP design and fabrica￾tion, including novel synthesis techniques, surface modifications, and hybrid tactics 
that allow for exact control over composition, size, and form. The landscape is being 
formed by emerging trends and future directions as MNPs manage present hurdles, 
which include scale issues and biocompatibility concerns. Transformative applica￾tions are made possible by the development of intelligent and sensitive MNPs, cus￾tomized surface functionalization, and sophisticated synthesis processes. The use of 
MNPs in environmental sensing, in vivo imaging, and combination therapy points to 
a trend toward more individualized and sustainable medical procedures.
Across disciplinary borders, MNPs present opportunities and problems that 
encourage cooperation among engineers, biologists, physicists, and chemists. 
Because of their combined expertise, MNPs are at the vanguard of innovation, pro￾viding answers to challenging issues in environmental management, materials sci￾ence, and medicine. The dynamic environment of MNPs will surely continue to be 
explored, innovated, and breakthroughs in the upcoming chapters. These multifunc￾tional nanomaterials are poised to redefine scientific and technological boundaries 
as researchers and industry navigate ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, 
and the ever expanding potential of MNPs. They will shape a future in which the 
integration of magnetic nanoparticles with diverse functionalities becomes an indis￾pensable tool for advancing environmental sustainability, materials engineering, and 
human health.84 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

ligands (keys) selectively bind to the receptors (locks) on the target cells. This 
specificity ensures precise and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents [47].
b. Polymer Coatings
• Overview: Polymer coatings serve as a protective layer around nanoparti￾cles, offering several advantages such as immune system evasion and con￾trolled release of the therapeutic payload [48].
• Immune Shielding: The polymer coating extends the period that the nano￾particles are in the bloodstream by helping them avoid being recognized by 
the immune system. The likelihood of reaching the target spot is increased 
by this stealth-like characteristic [49].
• Controlled Release: Polymer-coated nanoparticles’ regulated medication 
release guarantees a long-lasting therapeutic impact, minimizing potential 
side effects and optimizing treatment outcomes [50].
c. Stimuli-Responsive Triggers
• Overview: The purpose of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles is to have them 
react to certain environmental signals that occur within the body, including 
variations in pH, temperature, or enzyme activity [51].
• Precision in Drug Release: By incorporating stimuli-responsive elements, 
nanoparticles can be designed to release their therapeutic payload selec￾tively in response to conditions prevalent in the targeted area. This precision 
enhances therapeutic efficacy while minimizing off-target effects [52].
d. Magnetic Guidance
• Overview: Magnetic guidance involves the use of magnetic nanoparticles 
that can be navigated within the body using external magnets [53].
• Steering with Precision: These magnetic nanoparticles can be directed to 
precise locations within the body by manipulating external magnetic fields. 
This approach enables targeted drug delivery to specific tissues or organs,

5.1. INTRODUCTION
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MF-MNP) could be a promising field in a few 
areas, such as in hyperthermia therapy, much appreciated for their particular properties 
[1, 2]; they create warmth in infected tissues, helpful in symptomatic imaging [3, 4], par￾ticularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is also feasible to target certain tissues 
or cells with nanoparticles because of their unique features [5, 6]. Another possible use 
for nanoparticles is early detection; as they may change their surroundings, they can be 
employed in this capacity [7, 8]. A very beneficial medical procedure known as hyperther￾mia therapy raises a patient’s body temperature or the temperature of a particular area of 
the body above the average body temperature of 37°C. In this context, there are two types 
of hyperthermia: one is external hyperthermia, which depends on the utilization of elec￾tromagnetic waves [9, 10], ultrasound, or infrared [11, 12] by means of an external gadget 
to extend the temperature of a particular body part, and the other is internal hyperthermia, 
based on the utilization of catheters [13, 14]. Both strategies are employed for local hyper￾thermia. As for global hyperthermia, artificial fever is actuated, involving chemical sub￾stances or medicines with the aim of expanding the generally body temperature [15, 16].
The objective of this chapter is to grandstand the potential applications of MF-MNP 
within the therapeutic field, with a specific focus on hyperthermia treatment. We aim 
to understand how the specific magnetic properties of MF-MNP can be utilized to gen￾erate targeted heat in diseased tissues, opening up conceivable outcomes for diagnos￾tic imaging, especially in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and enabling specific 
targeting of tissues or cells. Another goal is to explore the potential of MF-MNP in 
early disease detection by modifying their environment. We seek to deepen the under￾standing of both external and internal hyperthermia and their uses in specific contexts, 
including local hyperthermia. Finally, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of inducing 
global hyperthermia through the administration of chemicals or drugs, thereby paving 
the way for new positive medical approaches to raise overall body temperature.Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Hyperthermia Therapy 115
5.2. MULTIFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
5.2.1.  Types of Magnetic Nanoparticles
There are a few types of functional magnetic nanoparticles. In Table 5.1, we have listed 
the main types of nanoparticles along with the principal functionalities for each type.
The Figure 5.1 explains how MF-MNP use a plasmonic/magnetic action to both 
raise and cause hypothermia.

5.2.2.  Composition and Synthesis
The synthesis and composition of MF-MNP constitute a promising field due to the 
properties and applications of these nanoparticles, especially in the medical domain. 
A few of the primary syntheses and their characterizations are shown in Table 5.2.
5.2.3.  Optical Imaging
Because of their magnetic characteristics, MF-MNP are utilized in optical imaging 
to improve object detection and visibility (Figure 5.2), allowing for more accurate 
targeting. These nanoparticles may find value in optical imaging in the medical field, 
particularly in the early detection of disease [26, 27].

5.3. MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES IN HYPERTHERMIA THERAPY
5.3.1. Magnetic Nanoparticles and Heat Generation
MF-MNP can produce heat for industrial or medicinal purposes due to their magnetic 
characteristics. A procedure called magnetic hyperthermia is used to treat cancer by 
injecting magnetic nanoparticles into the tumor site and then applying an alternating 
magnetic field. The ability of these nanoparticles to absorb magnetic energy and 
transform it into heat (Figure 5.3) allows for the targeted destruction of cancer cells 
[28, 29]. Also, in the industrial sector, magnetic nanoparticles are employed as agents 
for magnetic heating to strengthen materials. They can also be utilized to adjust fluid 
viscosity and destroy impurities through heating [30, 31].
5.3.2.  Hyperthermia as a Cancer Treatment
When treating many tumor types such as bladder cancer, cervical carcinoma, recur￾rent breast cancer, etc., hyperthermia is still an effective local anticancer treatment 
when combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. As a radiosensitizer or che￾mosensitizer, hyperthermia is administered at a temperature higher than the physio￾logically ideal range, typically 40°C to 43°C, for about an hour [32].
Table 5.3 lists the different ways that hyperthermia impacts cells, tissues, and intra￾cellular functions, including DNA repair mechanisms and systemic immunological 
responses. Hyperthermia can also affect elements vital to tumor survival and progres￾sion, including the microenvironment, vascularization, immunological responses, and 
oxygen delivery, in addition to targeting cancer cells in tumor areas [33].
FIGURE 5.3 Magnetic nanoparticles and heat generation.118 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
One important technical concern with the hyperthermia modalities that are now 
on the market, such as radiofrequency capacitance hyperthermia and whole-body 
hyperthermia, is the challenge of heating a local tumor location to the appropriate 
temperature without causing considerable harm to normal tissue. Large numbers of 
tumor cells can be killed by high temperatures, but traditional hyperthermia can also 
seriously harm normal tissues [34].

Therefore, a mostly experimental method for applying hyperthermia that may 
be able to address these drawbacks is magnetic-nanoparticle-mediated intracellular 
hyperthermia. Using an external alternating magnetic field, magnetic nanoparticles 
are directed toward tumor tissue in order to produce heat in the nanoparticles by 
relaxational loss or hysteresis loss (Figure 5.4) [35]. Magnetic hyperthermia, which 
induces heat by subjecting the target to an alternating magnetic field and kills tumor 
cells by ablation (T  =  45°C–56°C) or mild heating to cause biological weakness 
(T = 40°C–45°C) is one of the most advanced techniques based on MNPs [36].
5.4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
In conclusion, this chapter provides a thorough overview of MF-MNP in hyperther￾mia therapy and concludes with a comprehensive review of MF-MNP in the treat￾ment of hyperthermia. We have looked at the composition, fabrication techniques, 
and applications of magnetic nanoparticles as optical imaging agents in medicine. 
Moreover, we have proven their capacity to produce heat as a therapeutic agent for 
hyperthermia, demonstrating, for instance, their early usefulness in illnesses like 
cancer. This synthesis provides an advantage for researchers working in the field of 
magnetic nanoparticles and hyperthermia, as well as a chance for a specialist audi￾ence interested in the biological underpinnings of hyperthermia. As such, this syn￾thesis adds information and techniques on MF-MNP to the literature, enriching it.
In light of this work, we are working on future projects in our chemistry lab that 
involve the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles as well as the applica￾tion of these nanoparticles in various fields, such as electrochemistry as corrosion 
inhibitors or biology as antibacterial agents. This is due to the extensive study con￾ducted in the field of MF-MNP. Additionally, we have the chance to expand the area 
of their applications through worldwide collaborations in this exciting subject.

6.1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as a significant area of research due 
to their unique properties and versatile applications across various fields, particularly 
in biomedicine. These nanoparticles typically range from 1 to 100 nm in size and 
possess magnetic properties that allow them to be manipulated by external magnetic 
fields (1–3). The advent of nanotechnology has opened up new avenues for the syn￾thesis and application of these particles, leading to advancements in medical diag￾nostics, drug delivery, and therapeutic interventions. The superparamagnetic nature 
of MNPs is the cornerstone of their functionality. Unlike bulk magnetic materials, 
which retain magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field, superpara￾magnetic nanoparticles exhibit magnetism only when subjected to such a field (4, 5). 
This property ensures that the nanoparticles can be precisely controlled, reducing the 
risk of aggregation when the magnetic field is removed. This controllability is crucial 
for biomedical applications where precision and safety are paramount. The synthesis 
of MNPs involves various techniques such as co-precipitation, thermal decomposi￾tion, and hydrothermal synthesis, each method offering distinct advantages in terms 
of particle size, distribution, and surface characteristics (6). The choice of synthesis 
method depends on the intended application, as different biomedical applications 
require specific nanoparticle attributes. Surface functionalization of MNPs further 
enhances their applicability. By attaching specific ligands such as antibodies, pep￾tides, or nucleic acids to the nanoparticle surface, researchers can target specific 
cells or pathogens. This functionalization is vital for ensuring that MNPs interact 
selectively with their intended targets, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 123
the efficacy of biomedical interventions (7, 8). Figure 6.1 shows the range of nano￾materials that can be incorporated with a magnetic nanoparticle core to significantly 
enhance the performance and accuracy of sensing applications. This integration 
leverages the unique properties of each nanomaterial to achieve more sensitive and 
precise detection capabilities.
In the field of diagnostics, MNPs have revolutionized the field with their ability 
to act as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (10). One notable 
example is the development of Feridex (peroxides), an iron oxide nanoparticle used 
as an MRI contrast agent to enhance the visibility of liver lesions. This contrast agent 
has been particularly valuable in detecting hepatic metastases, providing clearer and 
more detailed images than traditional gadolinium-based contrast agents. The high 
surface-area-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles allows for the attachment of numer￾ous imaging agents, improving signal intensity, and providing clearer images of bio￾logical tissues. In addition, the magnetic properties of MNPs enable their use in 
magnetic particle imaging (MPI), a technique that offers high spatial resolution and 
sensitivity (11–13). MPI has shown great potential in detecting vascular abnormali￾ties and tracking stem cells in vivo, offering a noninvasive method to monitor cellu￾lar therapies and disease progression. Beyond imaging, MNPs play a crucial role in 
the separation and detection of biological entities such as bacteria and viruses. The 
application of an external magnetic field allows for the rapid and efficient isolation 
of target microorganisms from complex biological samples. This capability is partic￾ularly important in clinical diagnostics where the timely identification of pathogens 
can significantly influence treatment outcomes. For instance, in China, researchers 
have developed a magnetic-nanoparticle-based method for the rapid detection of 
FIGURE 6.1 Various nanomaterials that can be integrated with a magnetic nanoparticle core 
to enhance the efficiency and precision of sensing (Adapted from Ref. [9] under CC BY 4.0).124 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. By functionaliz￾ing MNPs with specific antibodies against M. tuberculosis, they achieved a quick 
and reliable separation of the bacteria from sputum samples, facilitating faster diag￾nosis and treatment initiation. In another example, scientists in India have utilized 
MNPs to detect and isolate Salmonella typhimurium in contaminated food samples 
(14–17). Functionalized MNPs with antibodies specific to Salmonella were used 
to capture the bacteria, which were then separated from the food matrix using a 
magnetic field. This method significantly reduced the time required for pathogen 
detection compared to traditional culture-based techniques, highlighting the poten￾tial of MNPs in ensuring food safety. In Africa, MNPs have been employed to detect 
the Ebola virus. During the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, rapid and 
accurate detection of the virus was critical for controlling the spread of the disease. 
Researchers developed a magnetic nanoparticle-based assay where MNPs function￾alized with antibodies against the Ebola virus glycoprotein were used to capture 
the virus from blood samples. The bound virus was then detected using a magnetic 
relaxation technique, providing a quick and sensitive diagnostic tool that was crucial 
in the outbreak response. The integration of MNPs with various detection platforms, 
including optical, electrochemical, and magnetic sensors, further enhances the sen￾sitivity and specificity of pathogen detection. In the United States, researchers have 
developed a magnetic nanoparticle-based biosensor for the detection of E. coli in 
water samples. The MNPs were functionalized with aptamers specific to E. coli, and 
the presence of the bacteria was detected using an electrochemical sensor (18, 19). 
This biosensor demonstrated high sensitivity and could detect E. coli at very low 
concentrations, making it a valuable tool for monitoring water quality and preventing 
waterborne diseases. In low-resource settings, the development of point-of-care diag￾nostic devices based on MNPs is particularly impactful. For example, in sub-Saharan 
Africa, malaria remains a major public health challenge. Researchers have developed 
a magnetic nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for the detection of Plasmodium 
falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most severe form of malaria. The assay 
uses MNPs functionalized with antibodies against the parasite antigens, providing a 
rapid, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostic tool that can be deployed in remote areas 
without the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment. Similarly, in Southeast 
Asia, where dengue fever is prevalent, MNPs have been used to develop a rapid 
diagnostic test for the dengue virus (20, 21). The test employs MNPs coated with 
dengue-specific antibodies to capture the virus from blood samples, which is then 
detected using a colorimetric readout. This approach has significantly reduced the 
time required for dengue diagnosis, allowing for timely medical intervention and 
better management of the disease. Figure 6.2 shows the biological process involved 
in the synthesis of MNPs. This method utilizes biological entities such as microor￾ganisms, plant extracts, or enzymes to facilitate the formation of MNPs, offering 
a more eco-friendly and sustainable approach compared to conventional chemical 
synthesis methods.
In therapeutic applications, MNPs offer innovative solutions for targeted drug 
delivery and hyperthermia treatment. Targeted drug delivery involves loading thera￾peutic agents onto MNPs and directing them to specific disease sites using an exter￾nal magnetic field. This approach ensures that high concentrations of the drug are The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 125
delivered directly to the target site, reducing systemic side effects and improving 
therapeutic efficacy (23, 24). Hyperthermia treatment leverages the ability of MNPs 
to generate heat when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. This localized heat￾ing can induce cell death in cancerous tissues while sparing surrounding healthy 
tissues. The precision and control afforded by MNPs in these therapeutic modalities 
highlight their potential to transform conventional treatment strategies. The appli￾cation of MNPs extends beyond human medicine into areas such as environmen￾tal monitoring and food safety. In environmental monitoring, MNPs can be used 
to detect and remove pollutants, including heavy metals and organic contaminants, 
from water and soil. Their ability to be manipulated by magnetic fields allows for 
the efficient separation of pollutants from environmental samples (25, 26). In food 
safety, MNPs can be employed to detect and isolate harmful pathogens, ensuring 
the safety and quality of food products. Despite the promising potential of MNPs in 
various applications, several challenges need to be addressed to fully realize their 
benefits. Scalability of production and ensuring the consistent quality and functional￾ity of MNPs remain significant hurdles. The biocompatibility and long-term safety of 
MNPs are critical considerations, as the interaction of nanoparticles with biological 
systems can lead to unintended toxicological effects (27). Regulatory frameworks 
governing the use of MNPs in biomedical applications must also evolve to keep 
pace with technological advancements, ensuring that new therapies and diagnostic 
tools are both safe and effective. Interdisciplinary research is essential to overcome 
these challenges and drive the field forward. Collaboration among chemists, biol￾ogists, engineers, and medical professionals is necessary to develop standardized 
protocols for the synthesis, functionalization, and application of MNPs. Advances in 
FIGURE 6.2 Biosynthesis process for creating MNPs (Adapted from Ref. [22] under 
CC BY 4.0).126 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
computational modeling and simulation can aid in predicting the behavior of MNPs 
in biological systems, guiding the design of safer and more effective nanoparticles.
6.2. PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF 
MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
6.2.1.  Superparamagnetism
Superparamagnetism, a defining property of MNPs, has revolutionized biomedical 
applications worldwide. Unlike their bulk counterparts, MNPs exhibit unique mag￾netic behavior due to their small size and thermal dynamics, making them invaluable 
in various medical technologies. In the field of medical imaging, superparamag￾netic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have emerged as key players. For instance, 
Resovist (ferucarbotran), an FDA-approved SPION-based contrast agent, is used in 
MRI to enhance imaging of liver lesions (28, 29). In Europe and Asia, Resovist has 
been pivotal in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases, offering 
superior visualization and aiding in treatment planning. The superparamagnetic 
nature of SPIONs allows precise localization under magnetic fields during imaging 
sessions, ensuring accurate delineation of tumor margins and metastatic foci, which 
is crucial for guiding surgical interventions and monitoring therapeutic responses. In 
drug delivery, SPIONs are utilized to enhance targeted therapies. Researchers in the 
United States have developed SPION-based nanocarriers for delivering anticancer 
drugs directly to tumor sites (30). Functionalized with targeting ligands such as anti￾bodies or peptides, these nanoparticles can navigate through the bloodstream under 
the influence of external magnets, homing in on cancer cells while sparing healthy 
tissue. This approach minimizes systemic side effects and improves therapeutic out￾comes, exemplified in clinical trials where SPIONs loaded with chemotherapy agents 
have shown enhanced efficacy in treating solid tumors like breast cancer.
In diagnostics, SPIONs are integrated into advanced technologies for rapid and 
sensitive detection of pathogens. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, research￾ers employed SPION-based assays for detecting the virus in blood samples. By func￾tionalizing SPIONs with specific antibodies against Ebola antigens, they achieved 
quick and reliable detection, crucial for containment efforts and patient management. 
This rapid diagnostic capability has also been leveraged in Southeast Asia for detect￾ing dengue virus infections, where SPION-based tests enable timely diagnosis and 
treatment initiation, reducing disease transmission and improving patient outcomes 
(31, 32). Moreover, the biocompatibility and safety of SPIONs have been extensively 
studied to ensure their clinical applicability. In Europe, ongoing research focuses on 
optimizing SPION coatings to enhance biocompatibility and stability in physiolog￾ical environments. Coatings with biodegradable polymers or surface modifications 
with hydrophilic groups improve nanoparticle circulation time and reduce immuno￾genicity, essential for long-term medical use. The global impact of superparamag￾netic nanoparticles extends beyond medicine. In environmental sciences, SPIONs are 
employed for water purification by removing heavy metals and pollutants from con￾taminated sources. Researchers in Asia have developed SPION-based filters capable 
of efficiently trapping pollutants in water treatment facilities, contributing to sustain￾able environmental management practices.The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 127
6.2.2.  Size and Surface Characteristics
The size and surface characteristics of MNPs are crucial determinants of their 
behavior and functionality across various global applications. MNPs typically range 
in size from 1 to 100 nm, offering a high surface area to volume ratio that enhances 
their reactivity and facilitates the attachment of functional molecules such as drugs, 
antibodies, or imaging agents. This property is exploited globally in biomedical 
applications, where MNPs are engineered to penetrate biological barriers and target 
specific sites within the body (33). For instance, in cancer therapy research con￾ducted in Europe and the United States, small-sized MNPs enable the precise deliv￾ery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor tissues while minimizing systemic toxicity. 
Researchers worldwide are also focusing on synthesizing MNPs with optimized 
sizes for applications like MRI contrast agents, ensuring clearer imaging and rapid 
renal clearance to enhance patient safety. Surface modification plays an equally piv￾otal role in tailoring MNPs for specific biomedical and environmental tasks (34, 35). 
Across continents, researchers modify MNPs’ surfaces with biocompatible polymers 
such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve stability and extend circulation time in 
the bloodstream. This approach is pivotal in the development of targeted drug deliv￾ery systems, where PEGylated MNPs enhance biocompatibility and reduce immune 
system recognition (36–39). Furthermore, surface functionalization with targeting 
ligands like antibodies or peptides enables MNPs to selectively bind to cells or tis￾sues, enhancing their utility in diagnostics and therapy. In Japan, for example, anti￾body-functionalized MNPs are utilized for imaging Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers, 
offering insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic interventions 
(40–42). Environmental and industrial sectors globally leverage MNPs’ surface 
characteristics for applications such as water purification and pollutant detection. In 
China, nanostructured materials incorporating MNPs effectively remove heavy met￾als and organic pollutants from wastewater, benefiting environmental sustainability 
efforts. Meanwhile, in South America, positively charged MNPs are deployed in soil 
remediation projects to adsorb contaminants, showcasing their electrostatic interac￾tions’ effectiveness in environmental cleanup. Additionally, MNPs with hydrophilic 
surfaces are integrated into biosensors in Australia for detecting bacterial contam￾inants in food and water supplies, underscoring their role in ensuring public health 
and safety.
6.2.3.  Stability and Biocompatibility
The stability of magnetic nanoparticles is another critical factor that influences their 
performance in various applications. Stability can be considered in terms of both the 
physical and chemical contexts. Physical stability refers to the ability of nanoparti￾cles to maintain their size, shape, and dispersion without agglomeration or sedimen￾tation over time. Chemical stability involves resistance to oxidation, degradation, 
or dissolution in different environments (43, 44). For instance, iron oxide nanopar￾ticles are prone to oxidation, which can alter their magnetic properties and reduce 
their effectiveness. Coating the nanoparticles with biocompatible materials, such as 
silica, gold, or polymers, can protect them from oxidation and enhance their stabil￾ity. Moreover, stable nanoparticles ensure consistent performance and reliability in 128 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
diagnostic and therapeutic applications, where fluctuations in nanoparticle properties 
can lead to variable outcomes. Biocompatibility is a fundamental requirement for 
the use of magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical applications (45). Biocompatibility 
refers to the ability of nanoparticles to perform their intended function without elic￾iting any undesirable effects in the host organism. This includes nontoxicity, nonim￾munogenicity, and minimal interference with normal physiological processes. The 
biocompatibility of MNPs largely depends on their composition, size, surface char￾acteristics, and coating materials. For example, iron oxide nanoparticles, which are 
commonly used in biomedical applications, are generally considered biocompatible 
due to their similarity to natural iron metabolism in the body. However, ensuring 
biocompatibility also involves rigorous testing and evaluation, including in vitro and 
in vivo studies, to assess the potential cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and immunogenicity 
of the nanoparticles. Surface coatings, such as PEG or dextran, can further enhance 
the biocompatibility of MNPs by preventing protein adsorption and reducing recog￾nition by the immune system. Additionally, biodegradable coatings, such as chitosan 
or alginate, can ensure that the nanoparticles are safely metabolized and excreted 
from the body after fulfilling their function.
Magnetic nanoparticles are designed with these properties in mind to optimize 
their performance for specific applications. For example, in magnetic hyperthermia, 
where MNPs are used to generate heat to kill cancer cells, superparamagnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles are preferred due to their efficient heat generation under an alter￾nating magnetic field (46, 47). The size of the nanoparticles is selected to maximize 
the heating effect while ensuring adequate penetration into the tumor tissue. Surface 
functionalization with targeting ligands ensures that the nanoparticles specifically 
accumulate in the tumor site, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. 
Stability and biocompatibility are crucial to ensure that the nanoparticles remain 
effective and safe throughout the treatment period. In drug delivery applications, the 
size and surface characteristics of MNPs are tailored to achieve efficient drug load￾ing, controlled release, and targeted delivery. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are 
used to guide the drug-loaded nanoparticles to the target site using an external mag￾netic field, enhancing the concentration of the therapeutic agent at the desired loca￾tion. Surface functionalization with pH-sensitive or temperature-sensitive polymers 
can enable the controlled release of the drug in response to specific stimuli in the 
target environment. Biocompatibility is ensured by using nontoxic and biodegradable 
materials for coating and functionalization, reducing the risk of adverse reactions 
(48–50). In the field of diagnostics, the high surface area and magnetic properties 
of MNPs enable their use as contrast agents in MRI and MPI. Functionalization 
with imaging agents, such as gadolinium or fluorescent dyes, enhances the signal 
intensity and provides clearer images of biological tissues. Stability is important 
to ensure that the nanoparticles maintain their contrast-enhancing properties over 
time, while biocompatibility is essential to prevent any toxic effects during imaging 
procedures. In environmental applications, the stability and surface characteristics 
of MNPs are crucial for their effectiveness in removing pollutants from water or 
soil. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be functionalized with specific ligands 
to capture heavy metals, organic contaminants, or pathogens, which are then sepa￾rated using an external magnetic field. The stability of the nanoparticles ensures that The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 129
they remain effective in various environmental conditions, while biocompatibility is 
important to prevent any harmful effects on aquatic or terrestrial organisms.
6.3. MECHANISMS OF SEPARATION USING MNPs
6.3.1. Magnetic Field Manipulation
The manipulation of MNPs through magnetic field techniques represents a trans￾formative approach in both biomedical and industrial applications worldwide. This 
methodological innovation harnesses the inherent magnetic properties of MNPs, 
predominantly superparamagnetism, to achieve precise and controlled separation 
processes in complex biological and environmental matrices (51–53). In biomedical 
research and clinical diagnostics, the ability to selectively isolate specific biomole￾cules, cells, or pathogens from heterogeneous samples is crucial for disease detec￾tion, treatment monitoring, and biomedical research advancements. Magnetic field 
manipulation techniques play a central role in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy 
of these processes. Across Europe, magnetic field manipulation has revolutionized 
diagnostic platforms by enabling the development of highly sensitive and specific 
assays for detecting pathogens. Electromagnetic systems, equipped with electromag￾nets capable of generating adjustable magnetic fields, are employed to manipulate 
MNPs functionalized with targeting ligands such as antibodies or peptides. These 
ligands selectively bind to biomarkers or surface antigens present on target bacteria, 
viruses, or cancer cells within clinical samples such as blood, serum, or tissue biop￾sies. For instance, in cancer diagnostics, researchers utilize MNPs conjugated with 
tumor-specific antibodies to isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral 
blood samples (54–56). The application of a magnetic field allows for the precise 
capture and separation of CTCs, which are rare and present at extremely low con￾centrations amid a vast excess of normal blood cells. This isolation process not only 
facilitates the early detection of cancer but also provides valuable insights into dis￾ease progression and therapeutic response. Moreover, in infectious disease diagnos￾tics, magnetic separation platforms are employed to detect and quantify pathogens 
with high sensitivity and specificity. In the detection of bacterial infections, MNPs 
functionalized with antibodies against bacterial surface antigens selectively bind to 
target pathogens present in clinical samples. The subsequent application of a mag￾netic field enables the isolation of bound MNPs, effectively separating the target 
bacteria from the sample matrix (57, 58). This approach enhances the reliability of 
diagnostic tests by minimizing interference from nontarget components and reduc￾ing false-positive results.
In North America, advancements in magnetic field manipulation techniques have 
catalyzed the integration of MNPs into automated separation systems tailored for 
industrial applications. These systems utilize both permanent magnets and elec￾tromagnets to generate controlled magnetic gradients, optimizing the separation 
of contaminants from diverse matrices such as food products, pharmaceutical for￾mulations, and environmental samples. For example, in the food industry, magnetic 
separation systems are employed to ensure product safety by removing metal con￾taminants from food streams (59, 60). MNPs integrated into these systems bind to 130 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
ferrous and nonferrous metals, enabling their efficient removal from food products 
during processing. This application not only enhances food safety standards but also 
supports regulatory compliance and consumer confidence in food quality. Similarly, 
in pharmaceutical manufacturing, magnetic separation technologies facilitate the 
purification of drug formulations by selectively binding and removing particulate 
contaminants or impurities. MNPs functionalized with specific ligands are used to 
capture and separate undesirable components from pharmaceutical products, ensur￾ing product purity and efficacy. This process is critical for maintaining stringent 
quality control measures and meeting regulatory requirements within the pharma￾ceutical industry.
The effectiveness of magnetic field manipulation techniques in isolating MNPs 
and their targets relies on the fundamental principles of magnetism and nanoparticle 
behavior. MNPs typically exhibit superparamagnetism, characterized by their ability 
to magnetize in the presence of an external magnetic field and demagnetize when the 
field is removed (61, 62). This property is advantageous as it prevents MNPs from 
aggregating or clumping together under physiological conditions, thereby facilitat￾ing their dispersion and interaction with target entities in biological samples. The 
manipulation of MNPs through magnetic fields involves the application of controlled 
magnetic forces to guide and concentrate nanoparticles toward specific targets. In 
clinical settings, researchers utilize electromagnetic systems equipped with coils 
and magnets to generate magnetic fields with adjustable strengths and orientations 
(63–65). This allows for precise manipulation of MNPs within complex biological 
samples, ensuring selective binding and isolation of target biomolecules or pathogens 
while minimizing nonspecific interactions.
In research laboratories and academic institutions globally, magnetic field manip￾ulation techniques with MNPs are driving innovations across various scientific disci￾plines. These techniques are instrumental in advancing fields such as molecular biology, 
immunology, and neuroscience by facilitating the isolation and study of specific cellular 
components or biomolecules (66–70). For instance, in neuroscience research, magnetic 
separation platforms enable the isolation of neural stem cells or neuronal progenitor 
cells from brain tissue samples. MNPs functionalized with cell-specific antibodies or 
markers selectively bind to target cells of interest, allowing researchers to isolate and 
analyze these cells for studying neurodevelopmental processes or investigating poten￾tial therapeutic interventions for neurological disorders (71, 72). Moreover, in drug 
discovery and development, magnetic separation technologies support the purification 
and characterization of therapeutic compounds, biomarkers, or drug delivery vehicles. 
MNPs functionalized with drug molecules or targeting ligands enable the selective 
capture and separation of bioactive compounds from complex mixtures, facilitating 
the identification of lead compounds with desired pharmacological properties. This 
approach accelerates the drug development process by streamlining purification work￾flows and enhancing the reproducibility of experimental results.
6.3.2.  Isolation of Bacteria
The isolation of bacteria using MNPs represents a sophisticated and versatile approach 
that finds applications across clinical diagnostics and environmental microbiology The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 131
globally. This multifaceted process integrates specific binding interactions and pre￾cise magnetic manipulation techniques to selectively capture and isolate pathogenic 
bacteria from diverse sample matrices (73, 74). In clinical laboratories worldwide, 
MNPs functionalized with antibodies or peptides play a pivotal role in the rapid and 
accurate detection of bacterial infections. These MNPs are tailored to target specific 
bacterial surface antigens, facilitating their selective capture from patient samples 
such as sputum, blood, or urine. For example, in Asia, magnetic bead-based assays 
have been developed to diagnose bacterial infections like tuberculosis. By coating 
MNPs with antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, these assays 
enable the direct isolation of tuberculosis-causing bacteria from clinical specimens. 
This targeted approach not only expedites diagnosis but also enhances the sensitivity 
and specificity of detection methods, crucially informing timely treatment decisions 
and disease management strategies. Beyond clinical settings, magnetic separation 
techniques with MNPs are increasingly employed in environmental microbiology to 
monitor and mitigate bacterial contamination in water sources (75, 76). In Australia, 
for instance, researchers utilize MNPs coated with bacteriophage-derived peptides 
or DNA aptamers to selectively capture pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia 
coli (E. coli) or Salmonella species from environmental samples. The integration of 
MNPs with magnetic manipulation systems allows researchers to concentrate bac￾terial contaminants from large volumes of water, enhancing the efficiency and sen￾sitivity of microbial detection methods. This approach is particularly significant in 
regions susceptible to waterborne diseases and microbial contamination outbreaks. 
By targeting specific bacterial strains known for their pathogenicity and environ￾mental persistence, researchers can effectively assess water quality and mitigate 
public health risks associated with bacterial contamination (77–79). The ability to 
concentrate and isolate bacteria using MNPs ensures that microbial detection meth￾ods meet stringent regulatory standards and contribute to safeguarding public health 
through proactive environmental monitoring and management practices. Figure 6.3
shows the detailed mechanism of synthesizing MNPs for molecular diagnosis. This 
FIGURE 6.3 Mechanism of synthesizing MNPs for molecular diagnosis (Adapted from Ref. 
[80] under CC BY 4.0).132 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
process involves the controlled chemical or biological synthesis of MNPs, followed 
by functionalization with specific targeting molecules. These functionalized MNPs 
can then bind to target biomolecules, enabling their detection and analysis. The pre￾cise synthesis and functionalization steps ensure high specificity and sensitivity in 
molecular diagnostic applications, facilitating early and accurate disease detection.
The effectiveness of MNPs in isolating bacteria hinges on their unique physico￾chemical properties and the principles of magnetic manipulation. MNPs typically 
exhibit superparamagnetism, wherein they magnetize in the presence of an external 
magnetic field and demagnetize when the field is removed. This property prevents 
MNPs from agglomerating under physiological conditions, ensuring their disper￾sal and interaction with bacterial targets without compromising sample integrity 
(81, 82). In practice, researchers functionalize MNPs with specific ligands such as 
antibodies, peptides, or aptamers that selectively bind to bacterial surface antigens 
or biomarkers. This functionalization enhances the MNPs’ affinity and specificity 
toward target bacteria, facilitating their efficient capture and separation from com￾plex sample matrices. Upon binding to target bacteria, the application of a mag￾netic field allows for the manipulation and concentration of MNPs, thereby isolating 
the bound bacteria while minimizing interference from nontarget components. The 
application of MNPs for bacterial isolation extends beyond traditional diagnostic 
approaches, encompassing research and development efforts aimed at advancing 
microbial detection technologies. In research laboratories globally, MNPs serve as 
versatile tools for studying bacterial physiology, antimicrobial resistance mecha￾nisms, and environmental adaptation strategies. By isolating pure cultures of specific 
bacterial strains, researchers can conduct in-depth molecular and genomic analyses 
to elucidate microbial pathogenesis and inform the development of novel therapeu￾tic interventions. Moreover, MNPs facilitate the development of rapid and sensitive 
diagnostic assays for bacterial infections, offering significant advantages in terms of 
assay speed, accuracy, and ease of implementation (83, 84). The integration of MNPs 
with automated detection platforms enhances throughput and scalability, making 
these technologies well suited for clinical settings with high sample volumes and 
stringent diagnostic requirements. Li et al. (85) present the development of a highly 
sensitive and quantitative lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) strip, designed for the 
simultaneous detection of two common respiratory bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus
and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The assay utilizes surface-enhanced Raman scatter￾ing (SERS) tags for detection. These tags are composed of magnetite nanoparticles 
coated with gold ( ) Fe3 4 O @Au and functionalized with 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic 
acid) (DTNB), which enhances the Raman signal, as shown in Figure 6.4. The rec￾ognition element 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA) is then attached to these 
nanoparticles. The 4-MPBA serves as a universal capture agent capable of binding 
to multiple types of bacteria in complex samples, such as those found in respiratory 
secretions. The integration of Fe3 4 O @Au/DTNB with 4-MPBA provides dual func￾tionality: magnetic enrichment and specific bacterial capture. This combination sig￾nificantly improves the sensitivity of the assay. In practical terms, the detection limits 
for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were determined to be eight colony-forming units 
per milliliter (CFU/mL) and 13 CFU/mL, respectively. These sensitivity levels are 
notably higher than those achieved with conventional colloidal gold-based methods.The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 133

6.3.3.  Isolation of Viruses
The isolation of viruses using MNPs represents a significant advancement in biomed￾ical and industrial applications, driven by the unique challenges posed by viral size 
and structural complexity. Researchers worldwide are exploring innovative strategies 
to harness MNPs for efficient viral separation and detection across clinical diagnos￾tics, biopharmaceutical production, and environmental monitoring contexts (87–89). 
In Europe, magnetic nanoparticle-based assays are at the forefront of rapid and sen￾sitive viral detection in clinical settings. These assays utilize MNPs functionalized 
with viral-specific antibodies or aptamers designed to selectively bind to viral parti￾cles present in patient samples. For instance, in the context of respiratory infections, 
MNPs conjugated with antibodies against influenza viruses or coronaviruses enable 
the specific isolation and concentration of viral particles from respiratory secretions 
or blood specimens. This targeted approach enhances the sensitivity and accuracy of 
diagnostic tests, facilitating early detection and timely management of viral infec￾tions. The integration of magnetic field manipulation techniques allows researchers 
to manipulate and concentrate MNPs bound to viral targets, thereby facilitating their 
isolation from complex biological matrices. This capability is crucial for minimizing 
interference from nontarget components and enhancing the reliability of diagnostic 
assays. By leveraging MNPs’ magnetic properties, clinicians can achieve rapid turn￾around times in viral diagnostics, providing critical information for patient care and 
public health management strategies. In North America, magnetic field manipulation 
techniques play a pivotal role in viral purification processes essential for biopharma￾ceutical production. MNPs functionalized with high-affinity ligands, such as protein 
A or protein G, are employed to capture and purify viral vectors used in gene therapy 
or vaccine development. These MNPs bind specifically to viral capsids or envelope 
proteins, facilitating their selective separation from cell culture supernatants or fer￾mentation broths (90, 91). The application of magnetic separation systems enables 
the efficient removal of impurities, host cell debris, and other contaminants that 
may compromise the purity and potency of viral-based therapeutics. By controlling 
magnetic field strengths and gradients, researchers achieve precise manipulation of 
MNPs within production systems, ensuring high recovery rates and product yields 
while maintaining product integrity. This process is essential for scaling up biophar￾maceutical manufacturing processes and meeting stringent regulatory requirements 
for the production of safe and effective viral vectors (92–99).The Separation and Detection of Biological Objects 135
The effectiveness of MNPs in isolating viruses relies on their unique physicochem￾ical properties and the principles of magnetic manipulation. MNPs exhibit super￾paramagnetism, allowing them to magnetize in the presence of an external magnetic 
field and demagnetize when the field is removed. This property prevents MNPs from 
agglomerating under physiological conditions, ensuring their dispersion and interac￾tion with viral particles without compromising sample integrity. Functionalization 
of MNPs with viral-specific ligands enhances their affinity and selectivity for viral 
targets, facilitating the efficient capture and isolation of intact viral particles from 
complex biological samples. Upon binding to viral components, the application of 
a magnetic field enables researchers to manipulate and concentrate MNPs bound to 
viral targets, thereby facilitating their separation from nontarget components. This 
approach minimizes background noise and maximizes the sensitivity of viral detec￾tion assays, making it suitable for applications requiring rapid and accurate viral 
diagnostics (100, 101). Beyond clinical diagnostics and biopharmaceutical produc￾tion, MNPs are driving innovations in viral research and development. In research 
laboratories, MNPs facilitate the study of viral pathogenesis, host–virus interactions, 
and antiviral drug development. By isolating pure cultures of specific viral strains, 
researchers can conduct detailed molecular and genomic analyses to unravel viral 
replication mechanisms, identify therapeutic targets, and evaluate potential vaccine 
candidates. Moreover, MNPs support the development of advanced viral detection 
platforms, including point-of-care diagnostic devices and high-throughput screen￾ing assays. The integration of MNPs with miniaturized detection systems enhances 
assay sensitivity and portability, enabling rapid on-site detection of viral pathogens in 
resource-limited settings or during disease outbreaks. This capability is particularly 
valuable for epidemiological surveillance, pandemic preparedness, and global health 
initiatives aimed at controlling infectious diseases. Samman et al. (102) introduced 
MICaFVi (magnetic immuno-capture flow virometry), a novel nanobiosensor diag￾nostic tool designed for detecting coronaviruses. MICaFVi integrates MNPs-based 
immuno-capture for virus enrichment with flow virometry analysis, achieving high 
sensitivity in detecting viral particles and pseudoviruses. As part of its validation, 
MICaFVi successfully captured virus-mimicking spike-protein-coated silica parti￾cles (VM-SPs) using anti-spike-antibody-conjugated MNPs (AS-MNPs), followed 
by precise detection via flow cytometry. The results demonstrate MICaFVi’s capa￾bility to identify MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-mimicking particles and MERS-CoV 
pseudoviral particles (MERSpp) with exceptional specificity and sensitivity, achiev￾ing a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.9 µg/mL (20 pmol/mL). This innovative approach 
holds promise for developing practical, specific, and point-of-care diagnostic tests. 
MICaFVi represents a significant advancement in diagnostic technology, offering a 
robust solution for rapid and sensitive coronavirus detection and potentially enhanc￾ing infectious disease surveillance and management strategies. Similarly, Song et al. 
(103) presented a novel nanoplatform integrating biofunctionalized MNPs with 
upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for the rapid and specific detection of Shigella. 
The method utilizes Shigella-specific aptamer-functionalized horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP) that interacts with MNPs@UCNPs modified with complementary strands. 
The detection principle involves the binding of HRP to MNPs@UCNPs in the pres￾ence of Shigella, as shown in Figure 6.5. Upon magnetic separation in the absence of 136 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Shigella, HRP remains bound to MNPs@UCNPs, facilitating the oxidation of color￾less 3,3′, 5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to blue oxTMB. The fluorescence quench￾ing at 545 nm arises from the overlap between the absorption peak of oxTMB and the 
emission peak of MNPs@UCNPs. This fluorescence biosensor enables the detection 
of Shigella within 1 hour, achieving a limit of detection of 32 CFU/mL. The efficacy 
of this nano platform was validated with satisfactory results in detecting Shigella in 
chicken samples. This innovative approach not only enhances detection speed and 
sensitivity but also demonstrates the potential of nanotechnology in improving food 
safety surveillance and pathogen detection strategies. This research underscores the 
significance of advanced nanomaterials in developing practical biosensing platforms 
for rapid and specific detection of pathogens, addressing critical challenges in food￾borne illness prevention and public health.

7.1. SEPARATION AND DETECTION OF BIOLOGICAL 
MOLECULES
The separation and detection of biological molecules constitute an important area 
of modern biotechnology. These processes enable the isolation and identification 
of specific molecules from complex organisms at the cellular level. An important 
development in this field is the use of magnetic nanoparticles [1]. Thanks to their 
special properties, magnetic nanoparticles offer an ideal platform for the effective 
separation, isolation, and detection of biological molecules. The utility and use of 
nanomaterials is undoubtedly one of the most exciting areas in bioanalytical science 
that fully emerged in the last quarter of the 20th century. The unique properties of 
these nanomaterials provide various advantages in bioanalytical applications. These 
advantages are based on factors such as nanomaterials’ ability to interact with bio￾logical systems, high surface area, customizability, and usability in various appli￾cations. In particular, the advancement of nanotechnology has increased the ability 
to recognize, monitor, and detect various biological molecules. The use of nanoma￾terials in bioanalytical applications ranges from the development of biosensors to 
drug delivery systems. These materials are used effectively in many areas such as 
examining events at the cellular level, biomedical imaging and improving medical 
diagnostic processes. These achievements of nanomaterials are the result of an inter￾disciplinary approach; advances in engineering, materials science and biotechnology 156 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
have come together to shape this exciting field. In this way, the use of nanomate￾rials in bioanalytical science enables the early diagnosis of diseases, improvement 
of drug development processes, and groundbreaking steps in biomedical research 
[2]. Magnetic nanoparticles are an effective tool, especially for the separation and 
detection of proteins. These nanoparticles can make selective interactions with pro￾teins and then isolate these proteins quickly and efficiently with the help of a mag￾netic field. In this way, the identification and characterization of targeted proteins 
becomes more effective, especially in biomedical research and diagnostic processes 
[3]. Magnetic nanoparticles also provide an ideal platform for enzyme immobiliza￾tion. Enzymes can be made more stable and long-lasting by immobilizing them on 
magnetic nanoparticles. This makes enzymes more effective and reusable in indus￾trial biotechnology processes and biosensor applications [4]. In this context, the use 
of magnetic nanoparticles on the separation and detection of biological molecules 
remains an important research area in biotechnology and biomedical research. The 
properties and application potential of magnetic nanoparticles contribute to sustain￾ing scientific and technological advances in this field.
7.2. ROLE OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
Magnetic nanoparticles have very important uses in the medical field, and new areas 
of use are emerging as time goes by. They have an important place in terms of diagno￾sis and treatment. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are materials with nanometer-scale 
magnetic properties. MNPs have various applications in fields such as biomedicine, 
biotechnology, chemistry, and materials science [5]. For example, MNPs can be 
used in cancer diagnosis and treatment by methods such as MRI imaging, magnetic 
hyperthermia, and drug delivery. MRI imaging provides clearer visualization of tis￾sues by increasing magnetic resonance signals of MNPs. Magnetic hyperthermia 
aims to kill cancerous cells by MNPs producing heat in response to an externally 
applied magnetic field. Drug delivery provides targeted therapy by directing drug 
molecules bound to the surface of MNPs to the area exposed to the magnetic field. 
In this way, MNPs function as smart nanosystems that act at the desired location by 
control of the magnetic field. MNPs play an important role in cancer treatment [6]. 
An example of breast cancer is given as a result of studies on cancer diagnosis and 
treatment of magnetic nanoparticles.
7.2.1.  Imaging of Primary and Metastatic Disease
The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) offers significant potential in imaging 
primary and metastatic diseases. Evidence in this area includes magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and its integration with other imaging techniques. The specific inter￾action of MNPs on tumor cells offers the opportunity to optimize treatment strate￾gies by providing a more sensitive and specific tumor detection [6].
7.2.2.  Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)
Magnetic nanoparticles play an effective role in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). 
This technique is used to evaluate the risk of cancerous cells spreading to the lymph The Separation and Detection of Biological Molecules 157
nodes. MNPs are selectively targeted to lymph nodes, facilitating the identification 
and removal of lymph nodes during surgical intervention [7].
7.2.3. drug delivery systeMs
Magnetic nanoparticles offer a targeted and localized treatment strategy when used 
in drug delivery systems. MNPs target cancer cells without damaging healthy tissues 
by directing the drugs they carry to a specific area. In this way, it is aimed to reduce 
side effects and make the treatment more effective [8].
7.2.4. MagNetic hyPertherMia
Magnetic hyperthermia involves concentrating magnetic nanoparticles in a targeted 
area and then heating tissues by applying a magnetic field. This method provides 
controlled heating to kill cancer cells. MNPs offer a new strategy for cancer treat￾ment by targeting tumor cells, especially in breast oncological surgery [9].
Increasing evidence for the use of magnetic nanoparticles in these fields is lead￾ing to the development of potential cutting-edge clinical applications, particularly 
in areas such as breast oncological surgery. The unique properties of these materi￾als offer great potential for the development of noninvasive diagnostic methods and 
improvement of treatment strategies.
7.3. BASIC PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
Magnetic nanoparticles are tiny particles with nanometer dimensions and magnetic 
properties. These nanoparticles usually have a core material and a coating material 
surrounding this core. Magnetic nanoparticle structures can be specifically designed 
for different industrial, medical, and scientific applications [10].
7.3.1. defiNitioN of MagNetic NaNoParticles
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are tiny particles with nanometer dimensions and 
magnetic properties. MNPs mostly consist of a core material and a coating material 
surrounding this core, and this structure affects the behavior of the particle [11].
7.3.2. structure of MagNetic NaNoParticles core
The core plays a crucial role in defining the magnetic characteristics of the nanopar￾ticle, comprising metal or metal oxides. It encompasses magnetic elements or com￾pounds like iron ( ) Fe , nickel ( ) Ni , cobalt ( ) Co , or their respective oxides. The 
magnetic properties of the nanoparticle are influenced by factors such as core size, 
shape, composition, and crystal structure [12].
7.3.3. coatiNg Material
This is a material that covers the magnetic core. This material prevents the oxidation, 
agglomeration, and toxicity of the core. It also increases the surface functionality, 158 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
biocompatibility, and targeting ability of the nanoparticle. This material can be poly￾mers, silica ( ) SiO2 , dextran or other biological materials. The coating material plays 
an important role in biomedical applications of nanoparticle [13].
7.4. SURFACE MODIFICATIONS OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
Surface modifications of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) play a critical role in shap￾ing their properties for specific applications. These modifications improve the outer 
layer of the nanoparticle in terms of stability, biocompatibility, and functionality [14].
7.4.1. coatiNg Materials
Polymer coatings: Polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl 
alcohol (PVA), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are widely used to stabilize 
MNPs in various environments [15].
Silica coatings: Silica (SiO2) coatings provide a protective layer and can be 
functionalized for specific applications [16].
Lipid coatings: Lipid-based coatings provide MNPs tailored for biological 
applications [17].
7.4.2. fuNctioNalizatioN
Amine functionalization: The introduction of amino groups increases the reac￾tivity of conjugating MNPs with biomolecules or drugs [18].
Carboxyl functionalization: Carboxyl groups facilitate binding with molecules 
through covalent or electrostatic interactions [19].
Thio functionalization: Thio groups enable bonding with gold surfaces or 
other thio-reactive compounds [20].
7.5. BIOCOMPATIBILITY
Surface modifications aim to increase the compatibility of MNPs in biologi￾cal applications and reduce potential toxicity and immunological response [21]. 
Biofunctionalization with proteins, antibodies, or targeting ligands increases speci￾ficity in biomedical applications [22].
7.5.1. hydroPhilicity/hydroPhoBicity adjustMeNts
Hydrophilic coatings prevent aggregation by increasing the stability of MNPs 
in aqueous solutions.

with lipid membranes [23].
7.5.2. targetiNg ligaNds
The addition of targeting ligands, particularly antibodies or peptides, enables specific 
binding to particular cells or tissues [24]. This is important in drug delivery systems 
and in vivo imaging applications.

7.5.3. MagNetic hyPertherMia aPPlicatioNs
Coatings of MNPs for magnetic hyperthermia require stability under physiological 
conditions. Special coatings are designed to optimize heat production for therapeutic 
purposes [25].
7.5.4. drug delivery systeMs
Surface modifications can be customized to load and release drugs in a controlled 
manner. For example, pH-sensitive coatings can enable the release of drugs in acidic 
tumor environments [26].
7.5.5. diagNostic iMagiNg
Surface alterations impact the counter-enhancement characteristics of MNPs in 
imaging modalities like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Enhancing stability 
through coatings enhances the efficacy of MNPs as contrast agents. Tailoring sur￾face modifications for MNPs depends on the specific application, and scientists are 
actively investigating inventive strategies to customize these alterations for diverse 
purposes, particularly in the realm of medical diagnosis, targeted drug delivery, and 
therapeutic applications [27].
7.6. MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLE SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES
Various techniques outlined in literature are employed for the synthesis of magnetic 
nanoparticles (MNPs). These methods encompass co-precipitation, microemulsion, 
thermal decomposition, solvothermal, sonochemical, microwave-assisted, chemical 
vapor deposition, combustion, carbon arc, and laser pyrolysis [28]. It has been noted 
that alternative approaches, including electrochemical synthesis, can also be utilized 
for nanoparticle (NP) production. Additionally, unconventional methods, such as 
laser pyrolysis, microorganism, or bacterial synthesis, offer alternative pathways for 
NP synthesis [28].
7.6.1. greeN syNthesis Method
Green nanotechnology has gained considerable attention due to its focus on pro￾cesses that mitigate or eliminate toxic substances to restore the environment. 
Within this realm, the biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles using plants has been 
advanced through various green synthesis methods, leveraging inactivated plant 
tissue, plant extracts, exudates, and other living plant parts. These approaches 
facilitate the synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) using environmentally friendly, 
nontoxic, and safe components, marking a significant advancement in biomedical 
applications [29].
Biological methods for nanoparticle preparation also involve environmentally 
friendly ingredients such as enzymes, fungi, and plants or plant extracts when uti￾lizing microorganisms [30]. The utilization of plants or plant parts in nanoparticle 
preparation may offer advantages over other biological processes by eliminating the 
detailed work associated with preserving microbial cultures. The selection of plants 160 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
for the biosynthesis of magnetic nanoparticles is driven by the presence of reducing 
agents that may play a role in the biosynthesis of these nanoparticles [31].
In a study by Awwad and Salem, they proposed a rapid, nontoxic, facile, and 
green synthesis method for magnetite nanoparticles in a one-step reaction. They 
argued that magnetite nanoparticles could be obtained in a low-temperature range 
and are coated by the carboxylic groups of the protein in carob leaf extract [32].
Green synthesis offers an economical, environmentally friendly, nontoxic, and 
safe method for the production of magnetic NPs. As suggested by Awwad and Salem, 
green synthesis of magnetite NPs has the advantages of a rapid reaction, low toxic￾ity, and easy applicability. These green synthesis methods offer potential solutions 
for biomedical applications by minimizing environmental impacts and using safe 
components [33].
7.6.2.  Solution Precipitation Method
One of the traditional approaches to nanoparticle preparation involves the precipi￾tation of products from solutions [34]. In this method, metal precursors dissolve in 
a shared solvent, and a precipitating agent is added to create an insoluble solid. The 
major advantage of the precipitation reactions lies in their ability to produce large 
quantities of particles. Homogeneous precipitation reactions, in particular, result in 
uniform particles, encompassing the separate processes of nucleation and the subse￾quent growth of nuclei [35].
7.6.3. Microemulsion
Microemulsion is characterized as a thermodynamically stable isotropic distribution 
involving two immiscible phases of water and oil, facilitated by the presence of a 
surfactant [36]. Surfactant molecules can create a monolayer at the interface between 
oil and water, with hydrophilic head groups in the aqueous phase and hydrophobic 
tails dissolved in the oil phase. This method offers several advantages, including the 
use of uncomplicated equipment, the potential for precise control over particle size 
and composition, and the synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs) with a crystalline struc￾ture and high specific surface area [36, 37]. The synthesis conditions involve ambient 
temperature and pressure. NPs produced through the microemulsion method tend to 
be smaller in size and to exhibit higher saturation magnetization. The properties of 
NPs prepared using this method are contingent upon the type and structure of the 
surfactant, an amphiphilic molecule that reduces interfacial tension between water 
and oil, leading to the formation of a transparent solution [38].
7.6.4. Polyol Method
The polyol technique presents itself as a promising method for the synthesis of uni￾form nanoparticles with potential applications, particularly in biomedical imaging 
such as magnetic resonance imaging [39]. This approach involves reducing dissolved 
metallic salts and precipitating metals directly from a polyol-containing solution 
to generate fine metallic particles. As an example, Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles The Separation and Detection of Biological Molecules 161
(MNPs) were synthesized using the co-precipitation method, integrating a surface 
decoration process and the polyol technique. Factors influencing the adsorption of 
metal ions, including pH, temperature, amount of adsorbent, and contact time, were 
systematically studied. The polyol method has proven effective in producing nano￾crystalline alloys and bimetallic clusters [40].
In the polyol method, the liquid polyol acts as a solvent for the metallic precursor, 
a reducing agent, and, in some instances, a complexing agent for metallic cations. 
The solution undergoes stirring and heating to a specific temperature, reaching the 
polyol’s boiling point for less reducible metals. Precise control over the average size 
of metal particles can be achieved by introducing foreign particles through seeding 
the reactive medium, a process known as heterogeneous nucleation. This separation 
of nucleation and growth stages enables the creation of homogeneous particles [41]. 
The polyol method employs various metal salts, encompassing iron, cobalt, nickel, 
copper, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, tin, rhenium, tungsten, platinum, 
gold, iron-zinc, cobalt-zinc, cobalt-nickel, and nickel-zinc, making it suitable for syn￾thesizing metal nanoparticles. Furthermore, metallic nanoparticles produced using 
the polyol method were observed to be shielded by surface-adsorbed glycol, thereby 
minimizing oxidation. The use of a nonaqueous solvent addresses the hydrolysis 
issue commonly associated with fine metal particles in an aqueous state [42].
7.7. INTERACTION OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES 
WITH BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES
7.7.1. Protein Adsorption and Magnetic Nanoparticles
The primary determinant influencing the behavior, functionality, and applications of 
nanoparticles is the adsorption of proteins onto magnetic nanoparticles [43]. A com￾prehensive understanding of protein adsorption plays a pivotal role in advancing bio￾medical applications, including drug delivery, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy [44]. 
Key factors such as the size of magnetic nanoparticles, their charge, and the mate￾rial employed for surface coating exert a substantial impact on the process of protein 
adsorption [45]. All these features determine the types and amounts of adsorbed pro￾teins. In order for a magnetic nanoparticle to adsorb protein, it must be exposed to 
biological fluids. This determines the physicochemical and biological properties of the 
nanoparticle [46]. Protein adsorption is the most important step for biomedical applica￾tions and is an indicator of the suitability and success of a drug or tumor treatment [47].
7.7.2.  Enzyme Immobilization and Magnetic Nanoparticles
Enzymes serve as highly efficient biocatalysts that facilitate both biochemical and 
chemical reactions. These catalysts demonstrate the capability to execute numer￾ous delicate reactions under mild conditions, including ambient temperature, phys￾iological pH, and aqueous media [48]. These inherent properties position enzymes 
as potential candidates across various domains, spanning organic syntheses to appli￾cations in healthcare and pharmaceuticals. However, their operational stability and 
lifespan limitations present challenges to fully realizing these advantages [49].162 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
To overcome these challenges, various modification methods are employed, 
including enzyme immobilization, protein engineering, use of additives, and the 
immobilization of enzymes, as preferred strategies to enhance catalytic stability. 
Magnetic nanoparticles, particularly in the size range of 10–20 nm, exhibit opti￾mal performance. These nanoparticles offer notable benefits such as a large sur￾face-to-volume ratio, ease of separation in external magnetic fields, and high mass 
transfer efficiency [50]. In the context of enzyme immobilization, the adsorption 
capacity of magnetic nanoparticles relies on the chemical bonds present on both the 
nanoparticle and the protein surface [51]. Enzyme immobilization with magnetic 
nanoparticles has breakthrough potential in many fields. This method appears to 
be effective in many areas such as biocatalysis, biomedical applications, and envi￾ronmentally friendly chemical processes. This strategy can increase the stability of 
enzymes, increase their reusability, and make biocatalytic processes more efficient. 
Particularly in industrial applications, enzyme immobilization in magnetic nanopar￾ticles allows biocatalytic processes to gain wider acceptance by providing sustainable 
and economical solutions. It is envisaged that this method will be further optimized 
in the future by combining it with advances in green chemistry and biotechnology. 
In this way, enzyme immobilization in magnetic nanoparticles can open the doors to 
a new era in biocatalysis [52].
7.8. NUCLEIC ACID BINDING AND MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
Integration of magnetic nanoparticles through nucleic acid interactions has emerged 
as a powerful strategy in various applications in diagnostics, drug delivery, and 
biotechnology. Magnetic nanoparticles can be effectively manipulated and distin￾guished under external magnetic fields thanks to their unique superparamagnetic 
properties. In the field of diagnostics, these nanoparticles, functionalized with com￾plementary probes, are revolutionizing disease diagnosis by making it easier to selec￾tively capture and detect specific DNA or RNA sequences. Additionally, magnetic 
nanoparticles play a key role in targeted drug delivery systems that enable precise 
delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy [53]. In biotechnology, the use of these 
nanoparticles in nucleic acid isolation contributes to advances in molecular biology 
research by optimizing processes such as PCR and DNA sequencing. The use of 
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in target enrichment and pathogen detection has led 
to significant progress in genetic applications such as infectious disease identification 
and genetic variant discovery. Scientists continue their work in this field by using 
enzymes that can catalyze many sensitive reactions and work under mild reaction 
conditions, especially in suitable conditions such as ambient temperature, physiolog￾ical pH, and aqueous environment [54].
The rapid and sensitive identification of pathogens holds paramount significance 
for global health. Magnetic nanoparticles have been extensively explored for this 
purpose, as evidenced by several studies. Zhu, for instance, constructed a magnetic 
nanocarrier proficient in efficiently enriching Listeria monocytogenes and preparing 
its nucleic acid. Chen introduced a method involving the selective capture and enrich￾ment of targets through the creation of a “MB250-target-MB30” structure using The Separation and Detection of Biological Molecules 163
magnetic separation and a magnetic relaxation switching sensor. This approach facil￾itated the detection of Salmonella enteritidis and viruses [55]. Additionally, Kwon 
developed a colorimetric technique utilizing platinum-coated magnetic nanoparticle 
clusters for the naked-eye detection of Escherichia coli in milk [56]. Similarly, Wang 
devised a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-labeled sandwich structure 
using magnetic nanoparticles for the enrichment and detection of Staphylococcus 
aureus [57].
These studies underscore the significance of employing magnetic nanoparticles in 
the realm of pathogen detection. In summary, magnetic nanoparticles have proven to 
be an effective strategy for the target enrichment of nucleic acids and the detection 
of pathogens. These methods not only enhance the accuracy and sensitivity levels in 
genetic analyses but also contribute to cost reduction in experimental procedures.
7.9. BIOLOGICAL MOLECULE SEPARATION 
TECHNIQUES OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES
7.9.1. Magnetic Separation
Magnetic separation is a technique employed for the preparation of samples in 
diagnostic applications, aiming to isolate target entities (e.g., bacteria, viruses, par￾asites, and cancer cells) from complex raw samples using an external magnetic 
field [58]. This method can be accomplished with both low and high magnetic field 
gradients. Achieving rapid, selective, and accurate disease detection is crucial in 
FIGURE 7.1 Gene detection by bacterial enrichment.164 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
clinical diagnosis. However, biological samples are inherently complex and consist 
of multiple components. Therefore, isolating the specific target entity from these 
intricate samples is a critical step in disease diagnosis. The principle underlying 
magnetic separation is the application of magnetophoretic force, wherein magnetic 
particles move under the influence of an external magnetic field to isolate the target 
entity [59].
This technique is characterized by being nonbiologically invasive, cost-effective, 
and energy-efficient, with minimal physical contact between the magnetic source 
and biological samples [60]. The efficacy of magnetic separation techniques not only 
impacts diagnostic outcomes but also influences accuracy and the time required for 
detection. Thus comprehending the factors influencing the magnetic separation pro￾cess and target detection is imperative [61].
In Figure  7.2, the separation of various molecules using a magnetic field is 
schematized. The first tube contains a mixture of both targeted and nontarget 
molecules. In the second stage, the targeted molecule is separated using a mag￾netic field. As a result, nontarget molecules are separated and target molecules are 
obtained [62].
An additional noteworthy technique employed in magnetic separation is low-gra￾dient magnetic separation (LGMS). This process utilizes low magnetic field gradi￾ents, enabling the isolation of target entities from complex samples in the presence of 
a magnetic field. Particularly utilized in the sample preparation stage of biomedical 
diagnostic applications, LGMS involves the movement of magnetic particles in a 
low magnetic field gradient [63]. Magnetic separation is often used to reduce the 
complexity of samples used in disease diagnosis and to isolate desired target entities. 
LGMS is preferred in cases where high magnetic field gradients cannot be used and 
thus allows magnetic particles to move effectively even at lower magnetic field gra￾dients [64]. This method is a widely used technique in the diagnosis of diseases and 
sample preparation in biomedical research. Understanding how magnetic particles 
FIGURE 7.2 Decomposition process using magnetic field.The Separation and Detection of Biological Molecules 165
behave at low magnetic field gradients is important for the effective application of 
LGMS.
7.9.2. Magnetic Nanoparticle-Based Chromatography
Chromatography is the widely used method to separate and analyze mixtures. 
Magnetic-nanoparticle-based chromatography is a separation technique that uses 
magnetic nanoparticles as support material [65]. Magnetic nanoparticles generally 
consist of magnetite, maghemite, and iron oxide materials [66]. The surface of mag￾netic nanoparticles can be functionalized using various captors and ligands to bind 
to the target substance with specific interaction. In this case, chromatography also 
increases selectivity and efficiency [67]. The solid phase is the phase that affects the 
transition in the sample component fixed on the support material. In this chroma￾tography method, our solid phase is magnetic nanoparticles. When we add the sam￾ple, the nanoparticles in the solid phase bind the molecule we want [68]. Our bound 
substances remain bound to magnetic nanoparticles in the chromatography column. 
We need to perform a deabsorption process to obtain the substance we want in pure 
form. In this chromatography method, an external magnetic field is used for this 
process [69]. Magnetic-nanoparticle-based chromatography has been applied in vari￾ous fields, including biochemistry, medicine, and environmental science. It is widely 
used in the purification of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and pep￾tides [70]. Magnetic-nanoparticle-based chromatography provides many advantages, 
such as faster separation and purification compared to conventional chromatography, 
reduced sample volumes, improved sensitivity, improved control over the separation 
process due to magnetic manipulation, and reusability of magnetic nanoparticles 
in multiple separation cycles [71]. However, there are also usage difficulties. There 
may be disadvantages such as ensuring the stability and reproducibility of magnetic 
nanoparticles and addressing potential problems such as nonspecific binding [72].
7.10. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the role of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles in the separation 
and detection of biological molecules represents an important area in biomedical 
applications of nanotechnology. This book chapter has presented a comprehensive 
review of the basic properties of magnetic nanoparticles, their synthesis methods, 
and their interaction mechanisms with biological molecules. The selective isolation 
abilities of these nanoparticles have been emphasized, with particular emphasis on 
their specific interactions with proteins, enzymes, and nucleic acids.
Successful binding of proteins and enzymes on magnetic nanoparticles enables 
the selective isolation of target molecules.
This chapter highlights the advantages of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles 
on the separation and detection of biological molecules, shedding light on potential 
applications in this field. Future research should aim to further develop this tech￾nology, make it more specific and effective, and increase its usability in clinical 
applications. As studies in this field continue, magnetic nanoparticles may enable the 
diagnosis and treatment of many diseases in the future.166 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

8.1. INTRODUCTION
The field of nanotechnology has been a driving force behind transformative devel￾opments in medicine, biology, and pharmacy. Among the myriad of nanomaterials, 
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as exceptionally versatile tools with 
a profound impact on various aspects of these disciplines.1
 Characterized by their 
diminutive size, with at least one dimension measuring less than 100 nm, MNPs pos￾sess remarkable magnetic properties that have unlocked a plethora of applications. In 
this chapter, we embark on a comprehensive journey to explore the multifaceted roles 
and applications of magnetic nanoparticles. Our exploration spans from the intricacies 
of MNP synthesis to their fundamental characteristics, and we delve deep into practi￾cal applications across diverse fields such as biocatalysis, therapy, and drug delivery.
The synthesis of MNPs has undergone continuous evolution, blending traditional 
techniques with innovative methodologies to attain precision in fabrication. These 
synthesis methods can be broadly categorized into physical, chemical, and biologi￾cal approaches, each tailored to exploit unique advantages suited for specific appli￾cations.2,3
 We provide an in-depth examination of the primary methods for MNP 
synthesis, encompassing diverse techniques such as ball milling, electron beam 
lithography, laser ablation, sputtering, aerosol spray pyrolysis, co-precipitation, ther￾mal decomposition, microemulsion synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, and the sol–
gel method, among others.
Furthermore, we recognize that the composition of magnetic nanostructures plays 
a pivotal role in determining their suitability for various applications. Consequently, 
we classify these nanostructures into two distinct categories, mono-component and 
multicomponent structures, illuminating their specific properties and applications 
in this context. The functionalization of magnetic nanomaterials represents another 
crucial facet of our exploration. We elucidate the techniques employed to tailor mag￾netic nanomaterials, encompassing a spectrum of physical and chemical methods. By 
doing so, we underscore their implications in enhancing particle size, shape, stability, 
and biocompatibility.4
Lastly, we embark on a comprehensive journey through the extensive array of 
applications that MNPs find in the biotechnological fields.5
 From their contributions 172 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
to nutritional analysis, protein and enzyme immobilization, protein purification, 
and biosensing, to their pivotal roles in tissue engineering, biomedical applications 
like drug delivery, hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, and magnetic resonance 
imaging—our exploration leaves no stone unturned.
This comprehensive investigation into multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles 
seeks to equip readers with a profound understanding of their synthesis and the 
extensive spectrum of their applications in therapy, biology, and pharmacy. The bur￾geoning advancements in this field hold the promise of inspiring future innovations 
and applications across various domains of science and technology, underscoring the 
enduring significance of MNPs in shaping our scientific landscape.
8.2. COMPARISON OF MAIN SYNTHESIS METHODS OF MNPs
Over the past decade, substantial advancements have been made in exploring diverse 
techniques to synthesize magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Achieving precision in the 
fabrication of MNPs is vital, as it can influence a range of characteristics including 
their physicochemical properties, dimensions, stability, dynamics, and compatibility 
with biological systems.6
 Broadly, the creation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) 
falls into three main categories: physical approaches, chemical techniques, and bio￾logical or microbial processes.
Physical techniques like gas phase deposition and electron beam lithography are 
based on the top-down strategy beginning with a bulk material and progressively 
depleting it to create nanoparticles. In contrast, chemical and biological methods 
are typically straightforward, flexible, and efficient, offering notable control over the 
composition and shape of the resulting material.7–11

8.2.1.1. Ball Milling Approach
Ball milling stands as a prominent method for nanoparticle synthesis, boasting both scal￾ability and affordability. However, its simplicity and cost-effectiveness belie the intricate 
nature of the process. Achieving the desired nanoparticle phase, minimizing residue 
presence, and effectively controlling particle size necessitates the careful optimization 
of several key parameters. There are two distinct methods of mechanical ball milling:
Conventional ball milling: In this method, coarse Fe3 4 O particles with larger 
sizes are reduced into ultrafine particles through collisions with steel balls 
or by repeatedly impacting against the inner wall of the milling tank.12
High‑energy ball milling: In high-energy ball milling, raw materials undergo 
mechanical alloying, leading to the synthesis of nano-spinel-type ferrite. 
This process is achieved using a high-energy ball mill.12 On the other hand, 
several significant drawbacks associated with ball milling include the poten￾tial for contamination of the powder due to contact with steel balls, as well 
as the mechanical and chemical effects that may result in the amorphiza￾tion of magnetite crystals. Additionally, ball milling demands a substantial 
amount of energy and often necessitates extended milling durations.13
 Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 173
8.2.1.2. Electron Beamlithography Approach
Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a precise technique for creating customized 
nanoscale patterns, demonstrating the ability to manufacture intricate three-dimen￾sional micro- and nanostructures. In the EBL process, bulk high-purity iron mate￾rials or thin iron films, initially applied to a substrate’s surface, transform into iron 
oxide ( ) Fe3 4 O nanoparticles. This transformation occurs through exposure to an 
electron beam. The electron beam induces the evaporation of the original iron pre￾cursors, leading to the creation of one-dimensional arrays of shape-tailored super￾paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.
8.2.1.3. Laser Ablation Approach
The laser ablation approach for preparing magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is a pre￾cise and controlled method used in materials science and nanotechnology. In this 
technique, a high-energy laser beam, often from a pulsed laser system like an exci￾mer or Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser, is focused onto 
a target material containing the magnetic elements of interest.13 The intense energy 
from the laser rapidly heats and vaporizes the target material, creating a high-tem￾perature plasma plume in the process. As the plasma plume expands and cools, it 
undergoes a phase transition and forms small MNPs as the atoms and ions recombine 
and condense. The size, composition, and properties of these MNPs can be finely 
tuned by adjusting laser parameters such as energy density, pulse duration, and repe￾tition rate. This level of control allows researchers to tailor the characteristics of the 
MNPs to meet specific requirements for various applications.14 In contrast to tradi￾tional synthesis techniques, laser ablation stands out for its exceptional capability to 
precisely modulate the phase composition, size, and morphology of nanoparticles. 
Varying synthesis conditions have been shown to yield MNPs in both spherical and 
hexagonal shapes, with remarkably consistent average diameters. This level of selec￾tivity in shaping and sizing particles sets laser ablation apart as a highly versatile and 
effective method in nanoparticle fabrication.15
8.2.1.4. Sputtering Approach
The sputtering approach represents a well established and scientifically rigorous 
method for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles. In this technique, a target mate￾rial comprising magnetic elements is subjected to a bombardment of high-energy 
ions, typically generated within a vacuum chamber. These ions, often derived from 
noble gases like argon, possess sufficient kinetic energy to dislodge atoms or clus￾ters from the target surface.16 As the sputtered material is ejected, it condenses and 
coalesces on a substrate placed within the vacuum chamber, forming MNPs with a 
controlled size and composition. The precise control over experimental parameters 
such as gas pressure, ion energy, and deposition time allows for the fine-tuning of 
MNPs properties, including their crystalline structure, magnetic characteristics, and 
size distribution.
8.2.1.5. Aerosol Spray Pyrolysis
Aerosol spray pyrolysis is a versatile and scientifically rigorous method for the 
preparation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). In this approach, a precursor solu￾tion containing magnetic elements is atomized into fine droplets and then introduced 
 
 174 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
into a high-temperature reaction chamber. Within the chamber, the solvent rapidly 
evaporates, leaving behind a cloud of precursor molecules that undergo chemical 
reactions and nucleation. The controlled heating of this aerosol cloud at elevated 
temperatures triggers the decomposition of the precursor compounds, leading to the 
formation of MNPs through nucleation and subsequent growth. The size, composi￾tion, and magnetic properties of the MNPs can be precisely controlled by adjusting 
various parameters such as precursor concentration, reaction temperature, and resi￾dence time within the chamber. Aerosol spray pyrolysis offers a robust and scalable 
approach for the synthesis of MNPs.
8.2.2. aPProaches to PrePariNg MagNetic NaNoParticles

8.2.2.1. Co-precipitation Method
The co-precipitation method is a widely employed technique for the synthesis of mag￾netic nanoparticles, particularly iron oxide nanoparticles like magnetite ( ) Fe3 4 O or 
maghemite ( ) - Fe O2 3 . In this method, iron salt precursors are dissolved in sepa￾rate solutions and then mixed, followed by the addition of a base, typically sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH), to adjust the pH. Heating and aging the solution at controlled 
conditions lead to the formation of magnetic nanoparticles.17 These nanoparticles can 
be subsequently isolated, purified, and characterized. The co-precipitation method 
offers the advantage of producing magnetic nanoparticles with tunable properties, 
such as size, composition, and magnetic behavior, making it a versatile choice for 
various applications in fields ranging from biomedicine to materials science.
8.2.2.2. Thermal Decomposition Method
Thermal decomposition is a widely used method for synthesizing magnetic nanopar￾ticles (MNPs) with precise control over their size, shape, and composition. In this 
technique, organometallic precursors, such as metal carbonyls or metal oleates, are 
heated to elevated temperatures in the presence of a solvent and often a surfactant. 
The thermal decomposition process leads to the reduction of the metal precursor, 
resulting in the formation of MNPs.18
The choice of precursor and reaction conditions, including temperature and reac￾tion time, play a crucial role in determining the properties of the synthesized MNPs. 
By carefully selecting these parameters, researchers can achieve monodisperse 
MNPs with a narrow size distribution. Surfactants or capping agents are often 
used during synthesis to stabilize the MNPs, preventing their agglomeration and 
controlling their surface properties.19 This method versatility and ability to produce 
MNPs with tailored characteristics make thermal decomposition a valuable approach 
for various applications, including magnetic data storage, magnetic sensors, and bio￾medical applications like targeted drug delivery and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) contrast agents.
In the thermal decomposition method, organometallic precursors play a pivotal 
role in generating monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) at elevated temperatures.20 This 
technique results in the formation of MNPs characterized by excellent crystallinity, 
 Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 175
precise size control, and distinct morphological features. During the decomposi￾tion of these organometallic precursors, organic surfactants are introduced to the 
reaction mixture, facilitating the synthesis of MNPs with specific desired sizes and 
shapes.21
8.2.2.3. Microemulsion Synthesis Method
The microemulsion synthesis method is a sophisticated approach for crafting 
nanoparticles with exceptional precision. In this technique, a microemulsion system 
comprising water, oil, and surfactants acts as the reaction medium.22 This unique 
environment allows for the creation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) character￾ized by superior crystallinity, tightly controlled particle sizes, and precisely defined 
shapes. Organometallic precursors are introduced into the microemulsion, and, with 
the assistance of organic surfactants, the synthesis process can be finely tuned to pro￾duce MNPs with specific desired characteristics.22 The resulting MNPs find applica￾tions in various fields, including catalysis, biomedicine, and data storage, where their 
size, shape, and magnetic properties can be tailored to meet specific needs.
Additionally, the microemulsion synthesis method offers several advantages, 
including high reproducibility and the ability to produce monodisperse MNPs in a 
scalable manner.23 The controlled reaction conditions and the amphiphilic nature of 
the microemulsion components provide a favorable environment for the formation of 
MNPs with remarkable uniformity, making this method a valuable tool in nanotech￾nology research and industrial applications alike.
8.2.2.4. Hydrothermal Synthesis Method
The hydrothermal synthesis method is a widely utilized technique for produc￾ing magnetic nanoparticles and nanomaterials under controlled high-pressure and 
high-temperature conditions within an aqueous solution. In this method, a precursor 
solution containing the relevant chemical constituents is sealed in a high-pressure 
reactor and heated to temperatures typically ranging from 100°C to 300°C . The 
elevated pressure and temperature create a unique environment conducive to the for￾mation of nanoparticles with specific properties.24
During hydrothermal synthesis, the precursor compounds dissolve, react, and 
nucleate to form nanoparticles. The controlled reaction conditions, including tem￾perature, pressure, reaction time, and precursor concentrations, allow for fine-tuning 
the size, shape, composition, and crystalline structure of the resulting nanoparti￾cles. The hydrothermal method is particularly advantageous for producing complex 
nanomaterials, including metal oxides, semiconductors, and nanocomposites, with 
well-defined characteristics.25
One key advantage of hydrothermal synthesis is its applicability to a wide range 
of materials, making it a versatile choice for various industries, such as materials 
science, energy storage, and environmental remediation.26 Moreover, the method is 
environmentally friendly as it often uses water as the solvent, reducing the need for 
hazardous organic solvents. This versatility and control over nanoparticle properties 
make hydrothermal synthesis a valuable tool in nanotechnology research and indus￾trial applications.176 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
8.2.2.5. Sol–Gel Method
The sol–gel method is a well established and extensively utilized approach for nanopar￾ticle synthesis, particularly in the production of metal oxides. This technique involves 
the hydroxylation and condensation of a molecular precursor in an aqueous solution, 
leading to the formation of a nanoparticles.27 Subsequent condensation and polymer￾ization processes result in the development of a three-dimensional network of metal 
oxides known as a wet gel. To achieve the desired crystalline structure, additional heat 
treatments are often necessary. Compared to other methods, the sol–gel technique 
offers several advantages, including the ability to work at lower temperatures and 
greater control over reaction kinetics by adjusting the chemical composition.28
8.2.3.  Approaches to Preparing Magnetic Nanoparticles
Using Biological Techniques
Biological techniques offer innovative approaches to prepare magnetic nanoparticles 
with unique properties and potential applications in various fields to address the dif￾ficulties associated with conventional physical and chemical techniques.29,30 One such 
method involves using living organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, as natural tem￾plates for nanoparticle synthesis.31 These organisms can accumulate metal ions from 
their environment and convert them into magnetic nanoparticles, often resulting in 
nanoparticles with well-defined shapes and sizes. This biologically mediated synthesis 
is environmentally friendly and allows for precise control over nanoparticle character￾istics, making it an attractive approach for tailored magnetic nanoparticle production.
Another approach utilizes biomolecules like proteins, peptides, or DNA as tem￾plates or stabilizing agents for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles.32 These 
biomolecules can bind to metal ions and guide their self-assembly into well orga￾nized nanostructures. By modifying the properties of these biomolecules or care￾fully selecting them, researchers can control the size, shape, and magnetic properties 
of the resulting nanoparticles. This method is versatile and can produce magnetic 
nanoparticles with high biocompatibility, making them suitable for various biomed￾ical applications, including drug delivery and imaging.
Furthermore, genetic engineering techniques can be employed to design and engi￾neer microorganisms or proteins specifically for the synthesis of magnetic nanopar￾ticles.33 By manipulating the genetic makeup of these organisms, researchers can 
enhance their ability to produce nanoparticles with desired magnetic properties and 
functionalities. This approach allows for the creation of tailored magnetic nanopar￾ticles that can serve as efficient contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) or as components in advanced materials for various technological applica￾tions. Overall, biological techniques offer promising and sustainable methods for the 
synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles with diverse properties and applications.34
8.3. COMPOSITION OF MAGNETIC NANOSTRUCTURES
The significance of magnetic nanostructures in biocatalysis is strongly influenced 
by their composition and properties. These nanostructures serve as a flexible foun￾dation for applications such as enzyme immobilization, targeted delivery, improved Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 177
catalytic activity, and controlled release, rendering them indispensable tools in a 
range of biotechnological and biomedical contexts.35,36
Magnetic nanostructures can be broadly classified into two main categories: 
mono-component and multicomponent structures.37 Mono-component nanoparticles 
consist of a single type of material, typically a magnetic material such as iron oxide 
or iron carbide, which can offer simplicity and controlled properties. On the other 
hand, multicomponent nanoparticles are composed of a magnetic material along 
with other components, which can provide the opportunity for enhanced and diverse 
properties, expanding their potential applications.
These nanoparticles have gained significant popularity in the previously men￾tioned applications due to their facile fabrication, low toxicity, and amenability to 
surface functionalization. Additionally, other types of magnetic nanostructures may 
include iron oxides ( ) c-Fe2 3 O , alloy-based materials ( CoPt3 and FePt), pure metals 
(Fe and Co), and spinel-type ferromagnets (MgFe2 4 O , MnFe2 4 O , and CoFe2 4 O ).38
The composition of magnetic nanostructures plays a crucial role in determining their 
magnetic properties, stability, and suitability for specific applications. For instance, 
the choice of composition can influence the magnetic behavior, surface reactivity, 
and biocompatibility of the nanostructures, making it an important consideration in 
the design and development of magnetic materials.39,40 When delving deeper into the 
composition of magnetic nanostructures and their significance in targeted biocatalytic 
application, it is imperative to explore the nature of magnetism, including concepts 
amid permanent magnets and external magnetic fields.41 A permanent magnet pos￾sesses its own intrinsic magnetic field, whereas an external magnetic field is applied 
from an outside source.42 For instance, Fe3 4 O nanoparticles exhibit superparamag￾netic behavior, making them responsive to external magnetic fields. Fe3O4 directly 
influences its magnetic properties.42,43 A  high saturation magnetization allows for 
efficient response to magnetic fields, facilitating controlled manipulation within a 
system. The use of Fe3 4 O enables the biocatalyst to be recovered from the reaction 
medium more rapidly by applying an external magnetic field.44 However, magne￾tite is quite difficult to stabilize against oxidation, giving mixtures of oxides with 
smaller magnetization response. Thamara et al.,38 utilized cobalt ferrite ( ) CoFe2 4 O
not only to tackle this issue but also to establish a robust matrix with commendable 
chemical stability, facile synthesis, and mechanical hardness. Therefore, enhancing 
the enzyme immobilization by chelating electron donor atoms, including O, N, and S 
from proteins by transition-metal ions Co2+ and Fe3+ , constructs a composite with 
hydroxyapatite to avoid particle aggregation.

Monocomponent magnetic nanostructures, including those based on iron (Fe), nickel 
(Ni), and cobalt (Co), as well as metal alloys, oxides, and carbides, exhibit remarkable 
potential in the realm of biocatalysis.45–47 These nanostructures serve as catalysts in 178 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
biological processes, facilitating efficient and selective reactions. In biocatalysis, the 
magnetic properties of these nanostructures enable easy separation and recovery, 
enhancing their reusability and overall catalytic efficiency. The unique character￾istics of each type of nanostructure offer tailored solutions for specific biocatalytic 
applications. Whether applied in enzymatic reactions, biomolecule immobilization, 
or other biotechnological processes, mono-component magnetic nanostructures play 
a pivotal role in advancing the field of biocatalysis by providing versatile and effec￾tive catalytic platforms.48
While iron (Fe) and iron oxides with a relatively consistent composition remain 
the most prevalent, numerous variations cater to specific needs. Ferrites incorpo￾rating additional elements such as zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and even rare 
earth (RE) metals are presently being developed for biomedical applications.49,50 The 
appeal of pure metal particles lies in their substantial magnetization potential, espe￾cially notable in pure iron (Fe) and iron-cobalt (FeCo) alloy particles.
Meanwhile, certain particles like iron-platinum (FePt) target an exceptionally 
high magnetic uniaxial anisotropy, particularly sought after in permanent magnets or 
storage media technology. Traditionally, permanent magnets have been crafted from 
rare earth (RE) alloys like neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) or samarium-cobalt 
(Sm-Co). However, the ongoing quest for magnets without rare earth elements has 
recently led to the development of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) composed of iron 
and cobalt carbides, showcasing a remarkably substantial anisotropy.
Nanostructured transition metal carbides and nitrides, particularly those featur￾ing iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni), have garnered significant interest for 
their noteworthy attributes in biocatalysis and other fields like nanomagnetism, 
biomedicine, and so on.51 Despite the inherent challenges associated with the syn￾thesis of these carbides and nitrides, especially at the nanoscale due to their intrin￾sically harsh characteristics, the difficulties are offset by the enhanced performance 
biocatalytic.
8.3.2. Multicomponent Magnetic: Nanostructures; 
Heterostructure Magnetic Nanostructures; 
Exchange; Couple Magnetic Nanostructures
The amalgamation of magnetic nanomaterials with substances from different classes 
leads to the creation of multicomponent nanoparticles, exhibiting a spectrum of fresh 
structures and distinct, improved, synergistic, and/or complementary functionalities. 
In this context, we delve into the latest advancements in the fabrication of multicom￾ponent magnetic nanoparticles, outlining the resultant structures and their innovative 
properties.52
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been integrated with various components, 
yielding systems endowed with multifunctional capabilities in the realms of sensing, 
biocatalysis, targeted infection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), drug delivery, 
and more. For example, porous nanoparticles show great promise in the realm of 
drug delivery by enabling the loading and precise release of therapeutic agents.53
Conversely, metal nanoparticles may exhibit plasmonic or catalytic properties, offer￾ing utility in disease detection for SARS-CoV-2.54Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 179
In particular, core-shell particles have been crafted using two distinct magnetic 
materials arranged in concentric layers. Additionally, hetero-structured nanopar￾ticles, reminiscent of the dual-faced Roman god Janus, have emerged. Examples 
include FePt/Au, Co/Au, and FePt/iron oxide dimers, demonstrating responsiveness 
to magnetic fields or light excitation. Additionally, core@shell nanoparticles, het￾erodimers plasmonic–magnetic gold–iron oxide nanoparticles expose both active 
surfaces simultaneously, showcasing separated surface physicochemical properties 
without the protective layer characteristic of core@shell structures.55
Moreover, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated or filled with these 
superparamagnetic particles exhibit alignment at room temperature on various sub￾strates through deposition from an aqueous solution in an external field.56 A recent 
development involves carbon capsules loaded with a substantial quantity of MNPs, 
presenting novel possibilities for diverse applications. This integration of MNPs into 
varied structures and materials opens avenues for innovative advancements in bio￾catalytic applications and beyond.
8.4. SYNTHESIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF MAGNETIC 
NANOMATERIALS
Due to the advancement of nanoparticle synthesis technology, the application of 
magnetic nanoparticles in the biomedical and material science fields is receiving 
much attention. The particle size, shape, stability, and biocompatibility of the syn￾thesized nanoparticles depend on the preparation method.57 In addition, magnetic 
nanoparticles can be synthesized top-down or bottom-up. The top-down approach is 
the mechanical size reduction of bulk materials, while the bottom-up approach is the 
chemical synthesis of molecular materials to form nanoscale materials.58,59 The bot￾tom-up method of nanoparticle synthesis is the most suitable method for the prepara￾tion of magnetic nanoparticles due to the ease of forming smaller nanoparticles and 
the ability to control the shape and size distribution of nanoparticles.58
Co-precipitation is a simple and commonly used method for the synthesis of 
MNPs. This method requires the use of aqueous solutions of salts and bases. Basic or 
alkaline solutions are converted into saline solutions at elevated or room temperature 
under chemically inert atmospheric conditions.59,60 As the polydispersity of the reac￾tion increases at higher temperatures, the size of the MNP crystals decreases, and the 
degree of aggregation decreases.60,61
Microemulsions are an important technique used for the synthesis of MNPs due 
to their valuable properties such as smaller droplet size, spherical structure, high sta￾bility, and tunable tendency in the size-controlled synthesis of MNPs.62 This method 
involves mixing two immiscible solvents: thermodynamically stable water and oil with 
or without activators (surfactants).59 Two main methods are required for the synthesis 
of MNPs: the one-microemulsion method and the two-microemulsion method. Single￾microemulsion methods typically use a pure initiator or reactant such as ammonia 
( ) NH3 as the reaction initiator. This method is a diffusion-based process in which 
reactants diffuse into droplets used in the microemulsions. The two-microemulsion 
method is a method of mixing two reactants dissolved in the nanodroplets of two dif￾ferent microemulsions to form nanoparticles by drop-to-drop synthesis.63180 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Sonochemical methods for the synthesis of MNPs involve the use of ultrasound 
in addition to the electrochemical procedures used for the synthesis of MNPs.59,64
The application of high-power ultrasound in an aqueous environment leads to the 
formation of cavitation, which causes the growth and collapse of microbubbles.64,65
When the microbubbles break down, they release heat, often at high temperatures 
and pressures, breaking bonds and causing chemical reactions to form nanoparti￾cles. This method is environmentally friendly, convenient, reproducible and allows 
better control of the amount of MNP preparation than other preparation methods.66
Experiments have shown that both methods produce ferrite nanoparticles with a spi￾nel-magnetite crystal structure. However, the crystallinity of the magnetite nanopar￾ticles prepared by the sonochemical method was higher than that of the magnetite 
nanoparticles prepared by the co-precipitation method.
Hydrothermal or solvothermal methods are another environmentally friendly, 
convenient, efficient, and reliable method used to synthesize MNPs of various sizes 
and shapes that do not require organic solvents or postprocessing.67,68 Morphological 
control of MNPs by hydrothermal methods can be improved by adjusting synthesis 
parameters such as temperature, time, and surfactants.67,69 Usually, the hydrothermal 
synthesis of nanoparticles requires high temperature ( ) 220°C and high pressure (107 
Pa). This increase in temperature and pressure favors the nucleation and rapid growth 
of nanoparticles, leading to the formation of microparticles.68 In addition, nanoparti￾cles prepared by this method are thermodynamically stable and can also be used to 
form other materials that cannot be easily prepared by other methods.70
Photochemical synthesis of nanoparticles combines physical and chemical meth￾ods to produce nanoparticles. This method focuses on the absorption of photons 
by the active compound and their conversion into reactive radicals that initiate the 
formation of intermediates.71 Another way to synthesize environmentally friendly 
nanoparticles is to use electromagnetic waves. This is a new technology that reduces 
energy consumption.
8.5. APPLICATION OF MNPs
The concept of nanotechnology was first proposed by Feynman in 1959. Nanoscale 
particles have improved properties due to reduced surface atomic interactions and 
coordination compared to bulk materials. Nanoparticles can be composed of metals 
or nonmetals depending on their basic form. Metal nanoparticles are mainly com￾posed of gold, silver, copper, magnetic materials (cobalt, nickel), and semiconductor 
materials. On the other hand, nonmetallic nanoparticles are mainly composed of 
carbon-based materials. Metal nanoparticles have been extensively studied for their 
electrical, optical, and catalytic properties.72,73 As a result, these nanoparticles have 
been used in a variety of applications, including food packaging, animal husbandry, 
electronics, agriculture, biosensors, medicine, and healthcare.74
8.5.1. Biotechnological Applications
8.5.1.1. Nutritional Analysis
Food safety is becoming an important social issue because contaminants contained 
in food pose a serious threat to human health. Nanoparticle-based sensors have Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 181
significantly improved the specificity, sensitivity, and signal intensity of food analy￾sis instruments.
In practice, the use of nanoparticles75 is designed as an alternative or complemen￾tary analytical tool for conventional approaches. The use of magnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles in food is justified, on the one hand, by their nontoxicity and biocom￾patibility and, on the other hand, by the nonretention of residual magnetic properties 
after removal of the magnetic field.76 In addition, their high specific surface area, 
high loading capacity, and easy separation of complex mixtures make it an ideal tool 
for food analysis. For example, the use of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as elec￾trodes or additives in electrochemical biosensors can improve sensitivity. Synthetic 
nanoparticles based on green metals extend shelf life and protect foods from pack￾aging damage.77 However, despite the variety of approaches, there are many limita￾tions to food safety and quality, including expensive equipment and short detection 
times. In addition, nanoparticles synthesized from environmentally friendly materi￾als can detect a wide range of food contaminants, including pathogens, heavy metals, 
pesticides, illegal additives, drugs, mycotoxins, contaminants, spoilage indicators, 
etc.78 More studies are being done to identify foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, 
Escherichia coli, Pyrethroid insecticides, sulfonamide, Ara h3/4 peanut allergen, 
Listeria monocytogenes, β-lactam antibiotics, organophosphorus pesticides, etc.).79
8.5.1.2. Immobilization of Proteins and Enzymes
Food industry companies use enzymes because of their excellent catalytic proper￾ties.80 However, free enzymes are generally unstable under pH, temperature, or other 
conditions, making them difficult to recover and reuse. It is therefore highly desir￾able to improve the stability of the enzyme after immobilization. Enzyme stability 
and reuse can be improved by enzyme modification, engineering, and immobiliza￾tion. Magnetic nanoparticles are a potential alternative for enzyme immobilization 
because they offer several advantages.81,82
They are in demand for the stability and reusability of proteins/enzymes due 
to their solubility, superparamagnetic nature, high surface area, biocompatibility, 
and ease of dissolution. They also have low toxicity due to their biocompatibility. 
Magnetic iron nanoparticles coated with chitosan ( Fe3 4 O @ chitosan) were cross￾linked with xylanase and cellulase to a magnetic saturation of 93%. The surface of 
iron oxide nanoparticles modified with polydopamine has been shown to regenerate 
cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase.83,84 These Fe3 4 O @ chitosan nanoparticles should 
be useful in the future for supporting enzymes. Their use as catalysts in industry 
includes the ability to efficiently separate reaction products from other molecules 
and to reuse immobilized enzymes. However, commercial-scale biotechnology and 
biorefinery processes require cost-effective, highly magnetically sensitive materials 
and industrial-scale magnetic separators.83 The use of Fe3 4 O @ chitosan nanoparti￾cles as catalysts in industry is certainly useful for supporting enzymes. This includes 
the ability to efficiently separate reaction products from other molecules and to reuse 
immobilized enzymes. However, commercial-scale biotechnology and biorefinery 
processes require cost-effective, highly magnetically sensitive materials, and indus￾trial-scale magnetic separators.83 Lipase was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles 
and significantly hydrolyzed fish oil with 95% efficiency.81 The immobilized lipase 
retained over 50% activity even after 20 recycles.182 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
8.5.1.3. Protein Purification
Proteins are functional elements used for a variety of purposes in biology, including 
chromatography, precipitation, ultrafiltration, centrifugation, and dialysis. However, 
these methods have several limitations, including lengthy handling processes, 
expensive equipment, and the need for specialized operators.85 Self-separation using 
nanoparticles of magnetic oxide offers advantages over existing methods. The desired 
surface properties of the reaction mixture can be operated to facilitate the separation 
of the biomolecule with the desired surface characteristics of the reaction mixture 
and other briquettes (for example, friendly or quasi) by eliminating other stages, such 
as separation and centrifugal filtration. Magnetic nanoparticles offer a large specific 
surface that can increase affinity for this purpose during protein purification, selec￾tively combining a large amount of protein and directly targeting compounds from 
primitive samples efficiently, flexibly, and automatically. Magnetic nanoadsorbents, 
which are microemulsions of iron nanoparticles, facilitate the one-step purification of 
target proteins from crude cell lysates by high-gradient magnetic fishing and provide 
an excellent specific area to remove. Labeled green fluorescent protein was purified 
using magnetic nanoparticles, and the utility of magnetic nanoparticles for the puri￾fication of labeled proteins was investigated.86 Additional buffer standardization can 
improve the expected affinity of proteins for nanoparticles.87 However, other studies 
on protein purification using iron nanoparticles are ongoing.88–89
8.5.2. techNological aPPlicatioNs
8.5.2.1. Biosensor
Identification of pathogens and their presence is important both for disease control 
and for reducing mortality through early diagnosis. Bioanalytical sensors use ferro￾magnetic nanoparticles coated with fluorescent substances, metals, silicon dioxide, 
or polymers. Using bioactive proteins such as hemoglobin (Hb), cytochrome P450, 
and myoglobin (Mb) as core-shell nanoparticles can selectively detect DNA damage. 
Magnetized nanoparticles have also been used in glucose biosensors, where they 
are converted to electrochemically detectable analytes by immobilized oxidase, 
producing electrochemically detectable products. Iron oxide nanoparticle chitosan 
composite glucose biosensor responds within 5 seconds.90 Cancer biomarkers poly(3, 
4-ethylenedioxythiophene), poly(styrene sulfonate), and nanostructured iron oxide 
nanocomposites ( ) nFe O2 3@PEDOT:PSS are anonymous, flexible, lightweight, and 
disposable immunizers based on iron nanoparticles. Used to develop a detection plat￾form, they have improved sensitivity of carcino embryonic antigen identification on 
transparent paper.
8.5.2.2. Tissue Engineering
In recent years, tissue engineering has been seen as a solution to the shortage of 
organ donors. Cellular regenerative medicine aims to efficiently restore, maintain, 
and improve tissue function using cells, materials, and physical/biochemical pro￾cesses.91 Magnetic nanoparticles act as a binder or adhesive. In addition, magnetic 
iron oxide nanoparticles act as radiation absorbers and provide directional energy 
transfer to facilitate electric current or short-wavelength light sources.92
 
 
 Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 183
In addition, antibacterial properties associated with nanoparticles may work 
synergistically to prevent implant failure in tissue engineering.93 Nanoparticles are 
useful for binding tissue-derived vascular grafts with favorable chemical, physical, 
and mechanical properties while enabling noninvasive imaging of manipulated 
and transplanted tissues using magnetic fields.94 The use of cells loaded with iron 
nanoparticles at the site of the disease/defect is also a promising approach for tissue 
regeneration. Iron nanoparticles have been used for cell-free regeneration of spinal 
cord injuries, especially when combined with magnetic fields and therapies. A reduc￾tion in the production of reactive oxygen species by iron nanoparticles has been 
reported.95 Researchers have developed magnetic gelatin nanocapsules loaded with 
transforming growth factor ( ) TGF - 1 for effective treatment.96 In addition, biocom￾posites such as hydrogels and iron nanoparticles can be used for tissue regeneration. 
A gelatin-genipin hydrogel system impregnated with iron oxide nanoparticles has 
been shown to ameliorate magnetic field-induced spinal cord injury in rats.97 In cystic 
fibrosis, the combination of iron nanoparticles and appropriate drugs showed a better 
response than either drug alone.98
8.5.3. BioMedical aPPlicatioNs
8.5.3.1. Targeted Drug Delivery
The development of nanoparticles is an important area of research in the field of 
magnetic nanoparticles for the controlled and efficient delivery of therapeutic chem￾icals, offering several advantages over traditional drug delivery systems.
The design of nanoparticles must be tailored to account for different properties to 
precisely modify their structural features to efficiently and selectively deliver drugs 
to specific regions. For this reason, magnetic drug delivery devices typically use 
a core-shell structure with an organic or inorganic shell to ensure adequate drug 
delivery. Nanoparticles have a diameter of 20–400 nm and easily penetrate tumors, 
improving permeability and retention. At the same time, the pharmacokinetics and 
in vivo behavior of the prepared nanoparticles are very important and should be 
considered.99 In fact, the weak electrostatic attraction of magnetic nanoparticles on 
the surface due to adsorption makes it impossible to reach the necessary drug con￾centration at the target site for the therapeutic effect. Therefore, applying a magnetic 
field to nanoparticles in vitro increases their concentration, providing sustained and 
complete release with sufficient therapeutic effect.
In addition, other studies have shown that RGD peptides containing L-arginine, 
glycine, and aspartic acid are effective for drug delivery.100 Unlike biological barri￾ers that reduce diffusion through the target site due to low specificity, side effects, 
and suboptimal pharmacological activity inherent in conventional drug delivery 
methods, this magnetic drug delivery system promotes drug release through the 
membrane because the drug is magnetic in the transmembrane transport system. 
Nanoparticles are used for the targeted delivery of serratiopeptidase. Therefore, this 
drug is internalized into endothelial cells or taken up by tumor cells, enhancing its 
anti-inflammatory effects in mice.101 In addition, due to the magnetic nanoparti￾cle-based drug delivery system, significant drug loading and targeting (magnetic and 
biological properties) are possible, resulting in a 66% release rate at the tumor site 184 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
and a superior recovery rate compared to existing drugs method ( ) 1% .
102 Among 
others, functionalized iron nanoparticles have been proposed for field-assisted drug 
delivery, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved commercial 
iron oxide nanoparticles.103
8.5.3.2. Hyperthermia
Magnetic hyperthermia uses heat generated by magnetic nanoparticles in a magnetic 
field. Different types of magnetic nanoparticles have been produced using different 
coating materials with different shapes and surface charges depending on tumor type 
and target location. Magnetic nanoparticles, with their tunable physical and chemical 
properties, create a protein corona that is believed to be used to kill malignant cells 
by establishing an external magnetic field that generates the heat used to destroy 
cancer cells at the tumor site.104 Iron oxide nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm are 
believed to have improved energy absorption and heating properties compared to 
other materials.
This is because different magnetic field parameters are used to generate hyper￾thermic effects in vitro. The researchers also found that varying the magnetic field 
amplitude of 10 kA/m and frequency of 400 kHz produced the maximum tempera￾ture.105 In vitro diagnostics offer high sensitivity and accuracy due to nanoparti￾cle-antibody conjugates (e.g., immunoassays). In vivo applications have shown that 
nanoparticle-antibody conjugates are effective due to targeting, payload flexibility, 
and adaptive biodistribution. Nanoparticle-antibody conjugates are widely used in 
medical immunoassays and tumor imaging.106
8.5.3.3. Photothermal Therapy
Photothermal therapy uses a near-infrared light source and a biocompatible photo￾thermal treatment agent, which is mainly a nanostructure of precious metals, such 
as carbon, metal, and semiconductor nanomaterials, and is characterized by strong 
infrared light scattering and absorption close.107 The specific interaction between 
metal nanoparticles and light enhances optical and photothermal treatments.108
Various chemicals such as gold-based compounds are frequently used, but the 
unknown toxicity of this metal precludes long-term clinical trials. There are also iron 
oxide compounds that are combined with various chemicals and are used alone as 
photothermal agents for cancer treatment. Combining infrared light with an oscillat￾ing magnetic field can improve the heating efficiency of iron oxide nanoparticles.109
Therefore, there is interest in combining magnetic nanoparticles with other photo￾thermal agents. Nanoparticles can be magnetically directed to specific locations, and 
their diffusion in the tumor can be controlled.
This can provide additional functionality to treatment systems as it absorbs more 
radiation and converts energy into heat more efficiently. It can be used as a treatment 
system that releases solid drugs using the heat generated after irradiating infrared 
rays to magnetic nanoparticles. However, when magnetic nanoparticles are used 
alone, there is a major drawback that the molar absorption coefficient is minimal 
in the near-infrared. This error can be corrected by examining the clustering of the 
nanoparticles. Nanoparticle-assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) has shown prom￾ise for tumor treatment by generating high local temperatures at the tumor site under 
 
 Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 185
visible or near-infrared (NIR) light. The high temperature directly kills tumor cells 
and neutrophils, releasing active chemicals with antitumor properties that kill resid￾ual tumor cells and reduce tumor recurrence.
8.5.3.4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis
Instead of using iron oxide nanoparticles instead of a simple contrast agent, you can 
improve the medical image. In fact, their high and good authority-self-characteristic 
make them a good choice as a contrast. Not only can it diagnose tumors or encephali￾tis, but it can also detect thrombosis early on.110 In addition, proteins immobilized on 
magnetic iron nanoparticles are used in practical applications due to their biocompat￾ibility, high saturation magnetization, and superparamagnetic properties. However, 
exposed nanoparticles can be oxidized by air, leading to dispersion and magnetic 
loss. Magnetic iron oxide contrast agents are coated with a suitable surface layer to 
improve stability under physiological conditions. In addition, polymer-coated com￾pounds are more biocompatible than conventional formulations.111
8.5.4. Biological reMediatioN of eNviroNMeNtal PollutioN
8.5.4.1. Decomposition of Polluting Dyes Present in Wastewater
Dyes are used in a variety of industries, including textiles, leather, and cosmetics, but 
are a major cause of water pollution because they are visible and persist even at very 
low concentrations.
Dyes produce toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic wastes that affect aquatic 
resources, even chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand 
(BOD), and are hazardous to humans.112 The ultimate removal of these dyes from 
wastewater is now essential for the conservation of aquatic and terrestrial life. The 
use of green nanoparticles is not limited to bromothymol blue and methyl orange; all 
other dyes, such as Navy blue, safranin, Congo red (CR) malachite green, acridine 
orange, monochlorobenzene, and rhodamine B, can also be removed from water. The 
green-derived nanoparticles are able to completely remove methylene blue (MB) and 
methyl orange (MO) from water at relatively low concentrations ( ) 10−200mg / L . 
Iron nanoparticles were used for the photocatalytic degradation of the organic dyes 
methylene blue and methyl orange with efficiencies of 82.1% and 53. %9 after 95 
and 205 minutes. Bromothymol blue dye breaks down faster than methyl orange. 
Green Purpureocillium lilacinum synthetic iron nanoparticles were used to extract 
two dyes, safranin and dark blue, at 100 ppm. As a result, the decomposition rates of 
safranin and blue dye by iron nanoparticles were 66% and 49. %3 , respectively, and 
were found to reach a maximum after 2 hours.113
8.5.4.2. Removal of Heavy Metals from Wastewater
Nanoparticles can be used to treat a variety of organic and inorganic pollutants in 
wastewater by adsorption. This technology uses a method of immobilizing nanoma￾terials on special supports and organic membranes.114
Metal nanoparticles are deposited on surfaces by redox reactions, co-precipita￾tion, or adsorption. The reactivity of iron nanoparticles depends on many factors 
that affect the removal mechanism, including the degree of oxidation, chemical 186 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
properties, and reaction with contaminants. Several studies have been conducted in 
this area, including the adsorption of chromium (VI) using nanowires, which is an 
efficient and reliable means of extracting cadmium (II) from aqueous solutions.115
When using stable nanoparticles, nanogar slurries have been shown to be very effec￾tive in remediating polluted aquifers.116 Green tea nanovalent iron (GT-Nzvi) with a 
diameter of 5–10 nm effectively removes hexavalent chromium from contaminated 
groundwater. Finally, nanoscale zero-valent iron sulfide (S-nZVI) is effective in 
removing Hg(II), Ag(I), Cu(II), and Pb(II) and has been shown to achieve 99%
removal in about 5 minutes and is effective in removing Ni(II) and Zn(II).117
8.5.4.3. Wastewater Treatment
Most environmental toxins are a combination of metals and organic pollutants, mak￾ing it difficult to remove both components simultaneously. Trichlorethylene (TCE) 
degradation was achieved using starch-based bimetallic Fe/Pd nanoparticles with 
a high degree of wastewater dechlorination.118 Iron nanoparticles synthesized from 
biological processes have been used to treat eutrophic wastewater. Another study 
showed effective removal of nitrate from wastewater using iron nanoparticles synthe￾sized from eucalyptus leaves and green tea extracts.119 Researchers are investigating 
the role of iron nanoparticles as a micronutrient additive in the anaerobic digestion of 
slaughterhouse wastewater. Eco-friendly synthesized iron nanoparticles are used to 
remove Pb(II) and rifampicin from wastewater with 100% and 91. %6 efficiencies, 
respectively. Studies have shown that iron nanoparticles synthesized in an environ￾mentally friendly manner are effective as adsorbents for the simultaneous removal of 
mixed contaminants from wastewater.120
8.5.4.4. Degradation of Pollutants through Stabilization
Since the addition of nanoparticles can reduce the decomposition efficiency of various 
environmental pollutants, nanoparticles can be added to polymers, zeolites, silica, and 
other solid materials. For example, iron nanoparticles derived from plants have been 
used for pollution treatment after stabilization with various substances.121,122 In fact, 
when iron nanoparticles and bimetallic Fe/Pd nanoparticles were incorporated into 
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes,121 iron (Fe) immobilized on the membrane 
increased the dechlorination rate of trichloroethylene (TCE) in wastewater. In contrast, 
K10 montmorillonite was used to stabilize zero-valent green iron (ZVI) nanoparticles 
and efficiently removed 100% arsenic from aqueous media within 30 minutes at low 
pH (2.75) and high Ph(1.1).122 In another study, a highly stable chitosan-encapsulated 
iron nanoparticle composite was used in batch-and-column experiments to remove 
arsenic and arsenic with 98. % 79 and 99. % 65 efficiencies, respectively, making it an 
excellent adsorbent for removing arsenic from contaminated water.123
8.5.5. Medical aNd theraPeutic aPPlicatioNs
Due to the unique properties of magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic resonance imaging 
is suitable for evaluating drug delivery efficiency, monitoring the delivery process, 
noninvasive monitoring of therapeutic response, magnetic stimulation, magnetic field 
and localization, and/or hyperthermia-induced efficiency enhancement combination 
 Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 187
therapy.124 This explains the use of nanoparticles in a variety of medical applica￾tions, including pesticides, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Although most magnetic 
nanoparticles do not have adverse effects on liver and kidney function after intrave￾nous administration, the potential toxicity of the particles depends on their surface 
charge, size, shape, coating material, etc. As the number of nanoparticles increases, 
toxicity increases significantly. Increasing the number of magnetic nanoparticles 
increases therapeutic efficacy and allows for more aggressive and higher drug doses. 
Iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely studied and used as magnetic nanopar￾ticles. Five iron oxide nanoparticles (Gastromark, Feridex, Resovist, Sinerem, and 
ferumoxytol) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
or the European Commission (EC) as X-ray contrast agents or iron supplements 
(Gastromark, Feridex, Resovist, and Sinerem).
8.5.5.1. Antibacterial Activity
Confronted with resistance to available antibiotics, nanoparticles can also be used 
in biomedical applications, opening new avenues for the development of therapy.125
Iron oxide nanoparticles are frequently studied due to their high surface charge 
and hydrophobicity, which increases their ability to adsorb and penetrate bacterial 
biofilms. They also have magnetic and paramagnetic properties.126–127 Further, they 
show excellent biocompatibility in vivo and in vitro, qualitatively distinguishing iron 
oxide nanoparticles from zinc oxide nanoparticles, which exhibit high cytotoxicity. 
This is despite the similarity of iron and copper oxide nanoparticles in their efficacy 
against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.128,129
Previous studies have shown that cultures of Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
bacteria are sensitive to iron oxide nanoparticles.130 Others have found that oxide 
nanoparticles exhibit greater antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria.131
The mechanism of action of iron nanoparticles affects the growth and development 
of microorganisms by causing dissociation of the bacterial biofilm, cell wall dam￾age and membrane rupture, and combinations of different types of lethal bacteria.132
It can also be used in regenerative medicine.133
8.5.5.2. Antiviral Activity
Promising antiviral activity results have been demonstrated with the use of nanopar￾ticles containing metals and metal oxides against dengue virus,134 rotavirus,135 influ￾enza virus,136 (HIV-1),136 and SARSCoV-2.136, 137 The nanoparticle coating induces the 
production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages and tumor cell lines, which 
are taken up by these cells. The size and composition of nanoparticles are critical 
factors that determine their toxicity and therapeutic efficacy.138 The nanotoxicity of 
inorganic nanoparticles has limited their use in clinical practice.139 Gold nanoparti￾cles are generally considered biocompatible, but with an average size of 1.4 nm, they 
are toxic. In contrast, the delivery of iron oxide nanoparticles into cells affects iron 
metabolism and prevents and treats SARS-CoV-2 infection.140
8.5.5.3. Antiparasitic Activity
Treatment with antiprotozoal chemotherapy agents, antiparasitic, and anthelmintic 
agents has resulted in resistance to parasites, particularly protozoa, ectoparasites, 188 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
and parasites. The use of nanoparticles for antiparasitic activity has shown excellent 
results in the treatment and control of parasitic infections. As a result, they have con￾tributed to the development of modern medicine in the last 10 years.141 Nanoparticles 
can be used as efficient drug carriers and are therefore effective in treating para￾sitic diseases. They are known to penetrate biological barriers, have adequate target￾ing, protect against drug degradation, and have adequate release, physical stability, 
accumulation, and intracellular release.142 Nanoparticles overcome limitations such 
as low cell permeability, random distribution, low bioavailability, and rapid drug 
clearance.143
8.5.5.4. Anticancer Activity
Several studies are investigating the use of nanoparticles for anticancer activity. By 
controlling local drug delivery using magnetic fields through magnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles coated with biopolymers, the side effects and shortcomings of existing 
methods, such as lack of site-specific action, are minimized. The latter should have 
high magnetic properties, narrow particle size distribution, and transparent encapsu￾lation surface. Nanoparticles loaded with anticancer drugs induce efficient killing of 
melanoma cell lines and induce structural changes consistent with the induction of 
apoptotic cell death.144 Functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles offer a wide range 
of therapeutic possibilities, including the covalent attachment of ligands, proteins, 
antibodies, and drugs using external magnetic fields.145 Recent studies using chitosan 
combined with citric acid, chitosan, and folic acid have shown that the properties 
of iron oxide nanoparticles on the surface change, resulting in superparamagnetic 
behavior.
8.5.5.5. Immune Modulatory Activity
Drug development and cancer research is a growing field with an emphasis on the 
role of immune function in cancer biology and treatment response.146 Results from 
clinical trials regarding the role of nanoparticles in inducing antitumor immune 
responses in humans are controversial.147,148 Iron oxide nanoparticles are being stud￾ied as immunotherapy or vaccines.107,149 The interaction between iron oxide nanopar￾ticles and immune cells has been reported to promote apoptosis due to high oxidative 
stress.150 Recent reports of iron oxide nanoparticles activating the immune system 
both locally and systemically suggest more sophisticated immunobiological actions 
mediated by nanoparticles or iron.151,152 The mystery of how antitumor immune stim￾ulation works remains unresolved.
8.5.5.6. Antifungal Activity
Nanoparticles can be used in antifungal treatment. Studies have reported that iron 
oxide nanoparticles prepared for tannic acid in alkaline media are crystalline, stable, 
and clear and that they have antifungal activity. Compared with the standard antibi￾otic mycostatin and iron-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles as a disinfectant, mycostatin 
had a higher zone of inhibition against Aspergillus niger of 18 mm.153 A recent study 
showed that iron oxide nanoclusters could be used for antifungal drugs.154 Other stud￾ies have shown that iron oxide nanoparticles can inhibit the growth of all Candida sp. 
tested and have antifungal potential.155Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Biocatalysis 189
8.6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles 
(MNPs) across various fields of therapy, biology, and pharmacy underscores their 
versatile and significant role. The detailed exploration of their synthesis methods, 
including physical, chemical, and biological techniques, highlights the advancement 
in nanoparticle technology and its tailored applications. The adaptability of MNPs in 
creating mono-component and multicomponent structures enhances their efficacy in 
diverse applications such as biocatalysis, drug delivery, imaging, and environmental 
remediation. The unique physicochemical properties of MNPs, coupled with their 
compatibility with biological systems, make them indispensable tools in advanc￾ing medical and biotechnological innovations. However, the challenges associated 
with their synthesis, such as controlling size, shape, and functionalization, alongside 
ensuring biocompatibility and minimal toxicity, remain areas of ongoing research 
and development.
Looking forward, the expansive potential of MNPs in biotechnology and medicine 
calls for continued research, particularly in understanding and mitigating their tox￾icity and environmental impact. The integration of MNPs in clinical and industrial 
applications demands a comprehensive understanding of their interactions with bio￾logical systems, requiring extensive in vivo studies and clinical trials. Furthermore, 
advancements in green synthesis methods offer promising avenues for environ￾mentally sustainable production of MNPs, aligning with the global shift towards 
eco-friendly technologies. The future of MNPs lies in the convergence of interdis￾ciplinary research and in exploring novel applications while addressing the ethical, 
environmental, and health-related implications of nanotechnology. This would not 
only lead to groundbreaking advancements in healthcare and industry but also pave 
the way for responsible and sustainable innovation in the field of nanotechnology.

9.1. INTRODUCTION
Nanoparticles (NPs) have garnered significant scientific interest due to their unique 
structural, optical, and electrical characteristics that differ from those of individual 
molecules or bulk materials. Currently, scientists can develop and prepare unusual 
NPs with adjustable sizes, shapes, and components for many purposes [1, 2]. For 
instance, the ability of NPs to produce magnetic fields and impact their immediate 
surroundings has resulted in their use as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imag￾ing (MRI) methods [3]. NPs are tiny particles, typically between 1 nm and 100 nm 
in size; however, in some instances, NPs are many hundreds of nanometers in size. 
These particles are composed of either inorganic or organic materials, such as poly￾mers. The significance of NPs stems from their distinct features compared to bulk 
materials of the same composition. These differences mostly arise from size effects, 
magnetic and electrical properties, and the influence of surface phenomena as the 
particle size decreases. Magnetic NPs possess inherent benefits that provide sev￾eral promising prospects in the field of biological applications such as they provide 
tunable sizes ranging from 2 to 20 nm, allowing for easy optimization of sizes and 
attributes to align with the biomolecules of interest in the research. The NPs may be 
controlled using an external magnetic gradient, offering significant benefits for many 
applications both in laboratory settings and inside living organisms. Additionally, 
magnetic NPs serve a crucial function as agents to increase contrast in MRI imaging 
[4–7]. Superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs are favored for their capacity to be mag￾netized when subjected to a magnetic field, but they do not retain permanent mag￾netization after the field is deactivated. Consequently, they are less likely to clump 
together and cause harmful blood channel blockages. The magnetized NPs need to 
be modified in a way that ensures stability against aggregation under physiological 
pH and ionic strength conditions. Additionally, the modification should limit their 
capture by the body’s immune system and offer reactive sites that are ideal for bind￾ing medicines and biological ligands [8, 9]. Magnetic NPs show great potential as 
they are biocompatible and can be easily modified with organic or inorganic metallic 200 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
or oxide materials. This allows for effective dispersion and makes them suitable for 
further functionalization by attaching various bioactive molecules [10]. Scientists are 
even creating tailor-made NPs that are similar in size to biological structures. These 
NPs may exhibit various functions depending on their contents and the method used 
to activate them. In this chapter, magnetic NPs, whether with highly saturated mag￾netization, functionalized NPs, and various functional composite magnetic NPs for 
their bio and biochemistry usages, are briefly described.
9.2. USAGE OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES IN VARIOUS 
BIOMEDICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITIES
Nana et al. [11] investigated how magnetic nanowires provide distinct benefits com￾pared to conventional NPs when included in multifunctional systems for therapeu￾tic purposes, both in terms of their composition and use. Cancer is considered one 
of the most malignant illnesses owing to its high rates of death and occurrence. 
Conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, have 
achieved a certain level of success in treating and managing cancer. Nevertheless, 
every method has its own challenges, particularly in terms of invasiveness or lack 
of specificity in its lethal impact, resulting in significant negative consequences. 
The current focus in anticancer treatment has been on multifunctional nanosystems, 
which aim to create drug delivery systems that are safe, effective, and efficient. These 
systems have the potential to overcome the drawbacks of existing tactics. Some of the 
most promising multifunctional nanosystems include the use of magnetic drug tar￾geting, actuation, or hyperthermia in conjunction with triggered drug release mech￾anisms. These nano systems may also be combined with diagnostic procedures like 
magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging. NPs have extensive uses in 
many sectors such as medicine delivery, among others. Nanowires (NWs) are used 
to trigger nonchemotoxic cell death by the application of magnetic force and the 
generation of localized hyperthermia in the presence of an alternating magnetic 
field. Huang et al. [4] further investigated the usage of various magnetic NPs in bio 
and biotechnological fields. Magnetic NPs exhibit distinctive characteristics when 
subjected to a magnetic field. Nanomaterials that incorporate iron oxides and other 
materials possess a multifunctional form, allowing them to exhibit high specificity, 
unique optical properties, and strong magnetic properties. This composite material 
have the potential to substantially improve their usefulness and broaden their range of 
uses. These magnetic NPs have several functions and may be used for various appli￾cations such as purifying proteins, immobilizing enzymes, removing contaminants 
from the body, delivering drugs via hyperthermia, conducting photothermal treat￾ment using near-infrared light, and performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Socoliuc et al. [12] investigated iron oxide NPs as the fundamental constituents of 
extremely exciting magneto-responsive systems in the field of nanomedicine, par￾ticularly in drug delivery applications etc., along with appropriate characterization 
techniques that are in accordance with the nature of magnetic NPs. The production 
of superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs dispersions may be achieved by two methods. 
The first method involves dispersing iron or iron oxides into an aqueous solution by 
crushing and scattering the solid phase. The second method involves condensing in Multifunctional Particles used In Bio- and Nanobiotechnology 201
homogeneous phases, comprising precursor materials obtained from either a liquid 
or a gaseous state. The primary distinguishing characteristic of ferrofluids within 
the broader category of magnetic colloids is their enduring colloidal stability, even 
under intense and nonuniform magnetic fields that are often encountered in many 
applications. Review concluded that the current goal of material science involves the 
tough creation of diverse NP systems for nanomedicine. Iron oxide NP systems are 
nanomaterials with high potential for use in medical testing and therapeutic applica￾tions. Toth et al. [13] first prepared the CSA-coated core-shell magnetite NPs (CSA@
MNP) by the method explained in the literature [14]. The magnetic fluid obtained has 
shown enough colloidal stability for in vivo use, but a full investigation of its precise 
physical, physicochemical, and colloidal characteristics has not been conducted. The 
primary objective of this study was to thoroughly analyze the CSA@MNPs that have 
been created using a postsynthesis coating technique, with the specific purpose of 
being used in biomedical applications. Figure 9.1 displays the adsorption isotherm of 
CSA on MNP, which was measured using the batch approach. The density measure￾ment and enzymatic digestion were used, followed by UV-absorption concentration 
calculation.
Above ~0.2 mmol/g of CSA addition, the CSA-coated magnetite NPs become well 
dispersed. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the uncoated 
MNPs is shown alongside the image of the coated sample to facilitate direct com￾parison. The TEM picture of the CSA@MNP sample reveals several white spaces 
between the MNPs, which may be attributed to the surface coating preventing their 
tight aggregation. The suspension of the naked sample likely contains aggregates 
mostly composed of bigger primary particles, which are dispersed due to the sta￾bilizing influence of the CSA-coating. The magnetization curve of CSA@MNPs 
in fluid media exhibits superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature, as 
anticipated for magnetite NPs with a tiny size of around 10 nm, which are covered 
with a nonmagnetic organic layer. Thus the magnetization (MS) of the superpara￾magnetic CSA@MNPs came out to be 56.9 emu/g, which was in the range of range 
of 53–58 emu/g, and it indicated that the magnetic core size was unaltered due to 
iron dissolution on CSA adsorption. The FTIR-ATR spectra and XPS studies pro￾vided evidence that CSA produces metal–carboxylate complexes on the surface of 
the MNP, with the metal ions being located inside the inner sphere. This bond for￾mation facilitates the H-type adsorption isotherm, allowing for the production of a 
magnetic fluid with a low equilibrium CSA concentration, which is advantageous for 
further in vivo applications. In one more study, Gao et al. [15] discusses the designs 
FIGURE 9.1 Adsorption isotherm of CSA on MNP at pH ~6.3 mM and 10 mM NaCl (Ref. 
[13]).202 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
and uses of multifunctional magnetic NPs in the field of healthcare. These NPs have 
gained significant attention in research. When it comes to creating multifunctional 
nanostructures out of MNPs, there are typically two main approaches. The first tactic 
is to functionalize molecules. Magnetic NPs may be “tagged” in a controlled manner 
by coating them with biofunctional chemicals, which causes them to interact with 
biological entities with great affinity. Following the process of molecular function￾alization, the biofunctional magnetic NPs are able to offer remarkable specificity 
and responsiveness for a wide range of biological applications. The second method 
involves combining magnetic NPs and other functional nanostructures by successive 
growth or coating, which results in the creation of a single entity that is capable 
of bestowing several functionalities on a nanoscale. Biomolecules interacting with 
magnetic NPs can then be utilized in various ways (as given in Figure 9.2) such as in 
bacterial detection, purification, and effective manipulation of proteins, toxin decor￾poration, etc.
In order to locate bacteria at low quantities, it is often necessary to wait for a 
considerable amount of time before doing additional investigation. Although it is 
feasible to identify the species of bacteria by combining biofunctional magnetic NPs 
with a particular antibody, this method may have a low degree of accuracy and result 
in a high level of expense. In order to determine the kind of strains at low concen￾trations in a rapid and reliable manner, the combination of magnetic NPs for bacte￾rium accumulation with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for DNA 
analysis may offer certain benefits. In the end, biofunctional magnetic NPs would 
be able to assist in opening up a new and appealing channel for the detection of 
pathogens and the diagnosis of diseases. Furthermore, purification of proteins and 
the ability to manipulate them effectively are both essential for the study of proteins 
FIGURE 9.2 Applications of magnetic NPs when functionalized with biomolecules.Multifunctional Particles used In Bio- and Nanobiotechnology 203
and its applications in the biological sciences. Among the procedures that are now 
in use, magnetic separation and purification is a technique that is both easy and 
dependable for the selective capture of certain proteins, genetic materials, organ￾elles, and cells. One of the examples in the literature is dopamine, used for preparing 
the NTA-terminated magnetic NPs, which are then helped out for the separation of 
six histidine (6×His)-tagged protein. In the process of protein separation, magnetic 
NPs demonstrated a high degree of specificity, which suggests that magnetic NPs, 
as a generic and adaptable system, should be able to selectively interact with various 
biological targets at low concentrations, provided that the appropriate anchors and 
ligands are used. Kozenkova et al. [16] synthesized Fe3O4-Au nanoheterostructures, 
characterized by TEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectroscopy; the size of 
NPs in water was measured by dynamic light scattering, and a SQUID magnetometer 
was used for measuring the magnetic properties. This transmission electron micro￾graph (TEM) is indicative of the dimeric NPs that are composed of a gold sphere and 
a well-defined magnetite octahedron brought together in a ratio of 1:1. On average, 
the diameter of the spherical Au NPs is 6 ±1 nm, whereas the median diagonal length 
of the Fe3O4 NPs is 12 ± 4 nm. It is worth mentioning that the creation of magnetite 
octahedra with regular shapes and average sizes, such as those reported here, is a 
somewhat rare occurrence. Under the wavelength range of 15−20 nm, the predom￾inant function that surface energy plays is to promote the formation of nanograins 
with a spherical shape, which have the lowest surface area. It would seem that the 
existence of pristine nuclei of noble metals, together with a prolonged reaction time 
and a high temperature, are all factors that contribute to the creation of tiny octahe￾drons of Fe3O4. Figure 9.3 depicts the XRD pattern, in which the specific peaks for 
ferrite and Au were in the pattern, but no impurities The average crystallite size was 
found to equal to 5 ±1 nm and 14 ±1 nm for Au and Fe3O4; this finding is in excel￾lent accord with the results obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 
FIGURE 9.3 X-ray diffraction pattern of Fe3O4-Au NPs (Ref. [16]).204 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
which reveals that both components possess a single-crystal nature and a high degree 
of crystallinity. On the other hand, the inclusion of plasmonic components in hybrid 
nanostructures makes them intriguing for use in a variety of applications, including 
magnetically assisted optical sensing, among others. To add even more usefulness to 
the gold surface, it is possible to further functionalize it by including other proteins. 
The biomedical sciences are now facing a number of problems, one of which is the 
discovery of noninvasive methods for the identification and detection of early-stage 
tumors. Because of its excellent spatial resolution and tomographic capabilities, mag￾netic resonance imaging (MR) is a strong imaging technology that does not need any 
invasive procedures.
However, the signal sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) for certain 
biological targets is primarily reliant on the specificity and selectivity of the ligand 
that is employed to target magnetic NPs to particular tissues. In order to improve 
the sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) signals for in vivo tumor identification, 
it is important to develop magnetic NPs that precisely target tumors. Several pro￾teins, including transferrin, herceptin, and chlorotoxin, have been attached to the 
outermost layer of iron oxide NPs [17–19]. Regrettably, these protein ligands have 
a tendency to exhibit immunogenicity, and the biological macromolecules used are 
both costly and inaccessible for several cancer kinds, consequently restricting their 
potential uses. In the same field, Shi et al. [20] altered the surface of iron oxide NPs 
using dendrimers for the purpose of biological imaging applications. Dendrimers 
are a novel category of synthetic macromolecules that are highly branching, are 
monodispersed, and possess an established framework, arrangement, and topology. 
Dendrimers, namely poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, have shown the abil￾ity to attach to targeting ligands, imaging agents, and drug molecules in order to 
facilitate tailored cancer therapies. The use of dendrimer chemistry to manipulate the 
surfaces of iron oxide NPs is anticipated to provide opportunities for the detection 
of diverse biological systems. The synthesized shell-cross-linked iron oxide (SCIO) 
NPs possess the properties of being soluble in water, stable, and compatible with 
living organisms. The synthesized SCIO NPs were examined using TEM. The shape 
of the SCIO NPs treated with FA remains mostly unchanged throughout the process 
of polymer assembly and cross-linking. Pictures obtained by staining with phos￾photungstic acid clearly demonstrate that all Fe3O4 NPs are encased by the polymer 
multilayers, as shown by the brilliant rings. This observation indicates the effective 
completion of the self-assembly process. Calvo et al. [21] provides a detailed explana￾tion of the synthesis of magnetic gold NPs (mGNPs) and their potential applications 
in biological assays. It also discusses various advanced techniques for analyzing 
mGNPs, including their morphology, chemical makeup, optical characteristics, and 
magnetic behavior. Three batches of mGNPs will undergo distinct characterization 
procedures. The bespoke NPs produced by nanocomposite possess a composition 
comprised of a magnetite core (Fe3O4) enveloped by a silica (SiO2) layer and topped 
with a gold shell, as given in Figure 9.4. Magnetite is a material that is commonly 
selected for the synthesis of NPs. This is due not only to the fact that it has excep￾tional superparamagnetic characteristics and a high magnetic saturation but also, as 
desired, to the fact that it is biocompatible. In order to produce iron oxide cores, a 
high-temperature reduction of an iron precursor was carried out in diethylene glycol Multifunctional Particles used In Bio- and Nanobiotechnology 205
in the presence of a polyacrylic acid stabilizing polymer. The reduction was activated 
by the quick addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Following the completion of the 
core synthesis and purification processes, an amorphous silica layer was added. This 
layer serves as a substrate for the attachment of tiny gold seeds, leading to the subse￾quent creation of a conformal gold shell that incorporates the seeds.
After that, the surface of the silica was amine-functionalized by a reaction with 
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane. Following that, the particles were treated with an 
aluminum salt in order to enhance the stability of the silica surface throughout 
the future processing stages. The morphology of a nanostructure, such as mGNPs, 
encompasses the size and form of its constituents. Even little alterations in these 
morphological characteristics may lead to substantial modifications in their magnetic 
and plasmonic capabilities. Hence, it is essential to visually perceive the core-shell 
configuration in addition to the overall morphology and dimensions of the NPs. The 
sample size must be sufficiently big to accurately represent the characteristics of 
the whole population and must also be sampled in a way that minimizes the risk of 
overlooking any variations within the population. TEM employs an electron beam 
with a high energy that effectively enters the sample, resulting in the interaction 
between the transmitted electrons and the nanometric framework, ultimately gener￾ating a picture. This method simplifies the examination of both the overall size and 
shape of NPs and provides a reliable average of the size distribution of the batch of 
NPs. By analyzing a large number of TEM pictures, a significant quantity of NPs was 
identified (given in Figure 9.5a). This enormous data set was then used to build the 
histograms (Figure 9.5b) for each batch.
FIGURE 9.4 Preparation of magnetic gold NPs from the magnetite (Fe3O4) and gold (Ref. [21]).206 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
The particle size distribution was found to be very constant, nearly matching the 
specs given by the manufacturer. This subdistribution was limited and may be 
ascribed to either a more compact magnetite and silica core or subtle differences in 
the thickness of the gold layer. Although there was a little absence of particles that 
were biased toward smaller sizes, this subdistribution was not significant. Further, 
the optical properties of the mGNPs were studied by using the dark field single￾particle spectrophotometry (DF-SPS) technique; however, their applicability is 
restricted due to the poor statistical performance that results from the fact that they 
can only investigate a limited number of NPs for each measurement. This indicates 
that the batches are appropriate for use in biomedical applications, even if there may 
be some individual variance owing to inhomogeneities in the outer gold layer. The 
overall optical response is within expectations. Magnetite is unique among particles 
because of its magnetic characteristics, which have practical and therapeutic uses in 
medicine and industry. In addition to the magnetite’s intrinsic magnetic capabilities, 
the silica and gold shell that encases it greatly affects them, dampening their sensi￾tivity to outside magnetic fields. So when the synthesis is complete, it is crucial to use 
techniques to characterize the magnetic behavior. Superconducting quantum inter￾ference device (SQUID) magnetometry measures the magnetic characteristics of 
massive amounts of mGNPs using an extraordinarily sensitive method based on 
superconducting loops, measures the magnetic behavior of NPs, and produces hys￾teresis curves. When it comes to assessing whether or not these particles are effective 
FIGURE 9.5 (a) TEM analysis of mGNPs. (b) Size distribution illustrated by histograms 
(Ref. [21]).Multifunctional Particles used In Bio- and Nanobiotechnology 207
as biosensors, in vitro tests are an extremely important factor. Not only do the mGNPs 
have optimum optical responses for the aforementioned tests, but they also display 
enhanced biosensing kinetics when they are subjected to the effect of external mag￾netic fields. Corr et al. [22] briefly explained that several diverse fluorescent-magnetic 
nanocomposites have been created in recent years. There is a significant need and 
strong desire for these and based on the preceding explanation, it is evident that mag￾netic-fluorescent nanocomposites have novel avenues and prospects in the fields of 
chemistry, biology, and medicine. It is possible to utilize fluorescent-magnetic nano￾composites to isolate not only cells but also a wide variety of biomolecules and other 
biological entities. This opens the door for the simultaneous control of the process 
via the use of fluorescence microscopy capabilities. Magnetic/fluorescent nanocom￾posites provide distinct possibilities for bio- and chemo-sensing. The composite 
materials possess two distinct characteristics: the ability to detect specific organisms 
using both magnetic resonance and fluorescence methods and the capability to func￾tion as magnetic tweezers for moving and manipulating the sensor in three dimen￾sions. Considering all of the recent advancements that have been achieved, the field 
of fluorescent-magnetic nanocomposite is still in its infancy stage. Significant efforts 
are required for the continued development of these materials and their application. 
In the long run, new fluorescent-magnetic nanomaterials might serve as all-in-one 
diagnostic, surgical, and nanosized drug delivery tools. This would be beneficial for 
the detection and treatment of cancer, HIV, and a variety of other diseases. As a 
result of their diminutive size and the fact that they possess both magnetic and fluo￾rescent capabilities, these nanocomposites provide a novel opportunity for targets￾directed applications that are under controlled conditions. This has a particularly 
high level of significance in the field of medicine, since one of the most significant 
drawbacks of any NP treatment is the difficulty in delivering the particle to the spe￾cific location of interest. Therefore, the research and development of magnetic-fluo￾rescent nanoprobes, as well as their use, have the potential to revolutionize several 
facets of contemporary medicine. Nevertheless, toxicity is a key worry when arguing 
for the use of NPs in any and all medicinal applications. Wang et al. [23] investigated 
bisphosphonate modified magnetite NPs, which were further studied for the possibil￾ity of eradicating radioactive metals from investigated liquids (water or blood). The 
metal ions are crucial for survival, but their buildup above appropriate amounts in 
tissues or organs typically causes numerous illnesses and problems because they 
create coordination complexes with crucial functional groups, displace other metal 
ions, or disrupt the active conformation of biological molecules. Heavy metals that 
are radioactive, such as uranium, cesium, and americium isotopes, are poisonous to 
people and also provide radiological risks. Hence, it is crucial to devise a secure and 
efficient method for eliminating radioactive materials from the body (decorporation) 
after radioactive contamination resulting from accidents or potential acts of malice. 
Although the magnetically assisted chemical separation (MACS) process has limita￾tions for in vivo use, it offers valuable insights for developing a decorporation method 
using biocompatible magnetic NPs. The combination of magnetic NPs and hydrogel 
containing bisphosphonate significantly reduces the toxicity of UO2+
2 -contaminated 
wounds in mice, prompting the creation of a compound of dopamine and bisphos￾phonate to alter magnetite Fe O NPs for the purpose of removing UO2+
3 4 2 from the 208 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
body. The MNPs that were created have the ability to eliminate 99% and 69% of 
UO2+
2 from water and blood, respectively. This outcome indicates that these modi￾fied, compatible MNPs may serve as valuable and efficient agents for the targeted 
and rapid elimination of radioactive metal poisons inside a living organism. While 
phosphates and proteins in biological systems, such as blood, also competitively bind 
to UO2+
2 the strong affinity between bisphosphonate and uranyl ions, thanks to the 
chelating action, enables effective decorporation. The use of MNPs and suitable 
ligands offers a promising framework for the development of a biocompatible 
approach to remove radioactive substances from the human body. Furthermore, cus￾tomizing the ligands or using other innovative nanomaterials also enables the identi￾fication, retrieval, and removal of additional toxic heavy metals from biological 
systems. Gu et al. [24] also prepared and characterized the cellular uptake of the 
conjugate of porphyrin and iron oxide NPs, and the composite thus formed was uti￾lized to detect cancer. Cancer, characterized by the unregulated proliferation and 
dissemination of malignant cells, has the potential to impact almost every bodily 
tissue and continues to pose a significant challenge to human well-being. The pri￾mary research endeavors in chemotherapy have been concentrated on the exploration 
and creation of novel therapeutic medications that target particular elements inside 
cancer cells. However, significant endeavors have also been dedicated to enhancing 
treatment approaches that are minimally invasive or noninvasive for cancer. 
Hyperthermia (HT) and photodynamic treatment (PDT) are noninvasive techniques 
that have regained attention due to recent advancements in photosensitizer chemistry. 
The selective absorption of porphyrin derivatives in tumors may aid in targeting the 
MNPs specifically to tumors for hyperthermia (HT) therapy. Combining these two 
modalities is a sensible approach to optimize the efficacy of cancer therapy. The good 
thing about combining both porphyrin derivatives and iron oxides is the biocompat￾ibility. Second, both may be biodegradable after treatment. The extensively researched 
pharmacokinetics and little systemic toxicity have resulted in the initiation of clinical 
studies and use of porphyrin derivatives in PDT and iron oxides in HT. Additionally, 
porphyrin derivatives and iron oxides exhibit complementary characteristics and 
purposes. Dopamine was used as anchor as its binding on the iron oxide is excellent, 
magnetite is considered a superparamagnetic material that allows for precise control 
over the sizes and shapes of magnetite NPs, ranging from 6 nm to 50 nm. Formed 
Fe3 4 O -porphyrin NPs are then characterized by TEM and showed that the magne￾tite NPs exhibited a restricted size distribution, with less than 5% variation. The 
NPs maintain a high level of crystallinity, ensuring that the interactions between the 
dihydroxybenzene linkers and the magnetite NP surfaces do not significantly modify 
the magnetic characteristics of the NPs. The SQUID magnetometer reveals that the 
NPs exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at ambient temperature. The UV-visible 
spectra of the methanol solution displays two distinct absorption peaks at wave￾lengths of 280 nm and 400 nm. The former is derived from the phenyl group, whereas 
the latter is associated with the Soret band of porphyrin, confirming the presence of 
magnetic NPs. In addition, a thermal stability test was conducted on the composite 
by immersing it in a water-methanol solution and boiling it for 30 minutes. The fluo￾rescence spectra of the composite remained unchanged, indicating that the benzyl 
group stays attached to the surface of the NPs. This outcome demonstrates that the Multifunctional Particles used In Bio- and Nanobiotechnology 209
composite material is capable of withstanding thermal treatment, making it a suitable 
contender for high-temperature applications. This is an uncomplicated, universal, 
and resilient approach to fabricate the molecular conjugates of MNPs and porphyrin 
derivatives, which currently fulfills several fundamental prerequisites of photody￾namic therapy (PDT) and hyperthermia (HT).
9.3. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
This article has included a summary of the biochemical and biological uses of mul￾tifunctional magnetic NPs. Magnetic NPs with multiple functions, which are a com￾bination of other materials and iron oxides, inherit from other components excellent 
surface chemistry, special optical properties, and magnetic properties. All of these 
characteristics would significantly increase the potential of such composite bifunc￾tional nanomaterials and broaden the range of applications for them. Upon conjugation 
of the magnetic NPs with appropriate ligands or polymers, the resulting bifunctional 
nanomaterials demonstrate exceptional specificity in binding and remarkable sensi￾tivity. These nanomaterials not only hold potential for various biological applications 
such as protein purification, toxin decorporation, bacteria detection, etc. but also 
offer the advantage of multiple functionalities in diagnosis and therapy. For example, 
there is a significant possibility that NW might substantially enhance the therapeutic 
effects of cancer treatment. Nevertheless, the magnetic nanowires have not yet real￾ized their full potential in the medicine industry. This is because there are still more 
applications and functionalization that can be molded into the magnetic nanowire 
flexible platform. It is very necessary to conduct efficient in vivo research for mul￾tifunctional NW nanosystems in order to move this technology into the preclinical 
phase. Through the use of a three-dimensional targeting model, it is possible to make 
advancements in the realm of tumor targeting, which will allow for the accumula￾tion of magnetic nanowires inside the tumor. It is necessary to do in vivo research 
in order to investigate and perfect the process of controlling temperature changes. 
Also, magnetic NPs, as a universal and adaptable system, preferentially interact with 
different biological targets at low concentrations, provided the appropriate anchors 
and ligands are utilized. This finding is supported by the specificity of MNPs, which 
was shown in the process of protein separation. After fulfilling their diagnostic and 
therapeutic objectives, it is important for these NPs to be removed by biological sys￾tems without causing any further harmful consequences. Further research should be 
conducted to investigate the enduring impacts of these NPs and their conjugates on 
biological systems. Another most significant challenge that nanomaterials continue 
to encounter is heterogeneity, and it is difficult to exert exact control over the number 
of functional molecules that are present on the surface of NPs. For the purpose of 
manufacturing NPs that have accurate composition, homogeneous surface modifi￾cation, and repeatable functionalization, researchers need to create more effective 
methodologies. In the end, biofunctional magnetic NPs would be able to assist in 
opening up a new and appealing channel for the detection of pathogens and the diag￾nosis of diseases. There is a strong need to conduct more research and examination 
of multifunctional magnetic NPs in order to develop effective nanobiotechnology for 
biochemical and biomedical purposes.210 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

10.1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) possess both magnetic particle and nanoparticle 
(NPs) characteristics, having sizes in nano range when presented in a magnetic field. 
With reducing size and increasing surface area and volume ratio, MNPs allow an 
increased surface effect, small size effect, quantum size effect, and macroscopic quan￾tum tunneling effect. MNPs are classified into metal NPs, metal oxide NPs, and alloy 
NPs. Metal NPs includes iron, cobalt, and nickel [1, 2]. Metal oxide NPs consist of 
iron oxides ( γ - Fe O2 3 and Fe3 4 O ) and ferrites ( CoFe2 4 O and Mn0.6Zn0.4Fe O2 4 ) 
[3, 4]. Alloy NPs include FeCo and FePt [5]. Some magnetic nanoparticles have super 
magnetism, which refers to the state of MNPs when introduced to an external mag￾netic field, in which NPs react similarly to paramagnets with the difference being 
the higher level of attraction, hence “super.” All the MNPs are easily guided in the 
presence of external magnetic fields [6]. This is often used in materials science, elec￾trochemistry, biochemical sensing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and envi￾ronmental and medical research [7]. MNPs also play a significant role in removing 
pollutants and relieving toxicity, such as membrane separation for water treatment 
and purification. Researchers use MNPs to immobilize biomolecules (antibodies, 
proteins, enzymes, etc.) and utilize simple, rapid, cheap, and efficient separation of 
target biomolecules [5–7]. Biomarkers in complex clinical samples can be precon￾centrated and enriched, separating interfering matrices, and increasing the sensitiv￾ity and specificity of testing. Magnetic drug targeting utilizes targeted drug delivery 
in vivo through active targeted therapy strategy. In vitro detection and application 
of MNPs plays an important role in early rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, 
thus assisting in prevention, management, treatment, and prognosis of diseases [3]. 
MNPs are also used for lateral flow test strips and microfluidic platforms such as 
lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices for continuous flow of magnetic cell separation and can 
be developed into portable devices that are easy to use. MNPs have attracted great 
interest of researchers due to their excellent properties [6, 7].
 Applications in Cell and Molecular Biology 213
MNPs have high surface-area-to-volume ratio, high binding rate with detection 
substances and can perform magnetically controllable aggregation and dispersion, 
making preconcentration, purification, and separation of nucleic acids simple and 
easy. MNPs have good dispersibility, which can bind biomolecules quickly and 
effectively. The binding is reversible, and the aggregation and dispersion of MNPs 
can be controlled. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the particles are 
nonmagnetic and are uniformly suspended in solution, while when an external 
magnetic field is used, the particles have magnetism and can be separated. Active 
substances such as bioactive adsorbents or other ligands connected to the surface 
of MNPs can be combined with specific biomolecules, like enzymes, DNA, or pro￾teins and separated under the action of an external magnetic field. This method 
has high specificity, rapid separation, and good reproducibility. In this chapter, we 
discuss about various applications of magnetic nanoparticles, as in cell tracking, 
drug delivery, tumor detection, cell-based therapy, cancer detection, nucleic acid 
detection, etc. [4–7].
10.2. USE IN MAGNETIC PARTICLE IMAGING
Rigorous works done on MPI have led to the development of MPI theory and instru￾ments. At present, MPI, with advancement of imaging tracer and no restrictions on 
penetration depth, leads to the various application like tumor detection, cell tracing, 
blood pool imaging, and locate magnetic hyperthermia [8–10].
10.2.1.  Cell Tracking
One of the most suitable MPI techniques is cell tracing. Advantages of MRI are 
high sensitivity and resolution, and the utilization of superparamagnetic nanoparti￾cles makes devices efficient to detect 200 labeled cells. Moreover, MPI shows tissue 
penetration with no background noise, making its suitable for in vivo cell tracking. 
For example, a ferroferric oxide nanoparticle is wrapped in a semiconductor polymer 
as an MPI tracer. This tracer had excellent performance in MPI scanning [11]. Its 
MPI signal intensity was far better than the imaging tracer VivoTrax and Feraheme. 
The results showed that MPI had a better signal-to-noise ratio, and MPI could detect 
a minimum of 250 labeled cells according to the imaging results. They also did 
a long-term imaging study on mice, which showed that MPI signals could still be 
detected 10–20 days after the injection of cancer cells labeled with the particles. 
Pratx et al. used superparamagnetic particles to label exosomes, and the MPI results 
were that the exosomes released by hypoxic cancer cells were taken up more readily 
by hypoxic cancer cells. The exosomes released by hypoxic cancer cells can thus 
deliver drugs more effectively to the hypoxic area of the tumor [12]. A specialized 
tracer was designed having high saturation magnetization, high sensitivity, and high 
resolution in MPI. It performed remarkably well in the labeling and tracking of stem 
cells compared to the commercialized tracer VivoTrax. The tracer also achieved the 
real-time and long-term tracking of stem cells in vivo [12, 13].214 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
10.2.1.1. Tumor Cell Detection
As cancer is still a lethal disease for humans, the early-stage diagnosis and treatment 
of cancer is still a topic of crucial research. The treatment of cancer mainly depends 
on the stage of cancer, and it is curable if it is detected at early stage. The high 
sensitivity of MPI is suitable for tumor detection of early-stage cancer. In practice, 
MPI takes advantage of the permeability and retention (EPR) effect to detect tumors. 
Therefore, MPI has great clinical application value in the early diagnosis of cancer. 
Moreover, studies confirmed that MPI can track tumors in vivo. As Berkeley’s MPI 
imaging results show, the magnetic nanoparticles were first distributed to organs 
with larger blood volumes, such as the heart and lungs. As the intravascular signal 
decreased with time, the signal in the liver and kidney increased. In terms of tumor 
detection, the tumor rim enhancement caused by the initial vascular wash-in could be 
seen in detail through MPI scanning. Then the scanning results showed that the mag￾netic nanoparticles began to accumulate inside the tumor due to the EPR effect [3]. 
A  glioma-targeted MPI tracer by modifying iron oxide nanoparticles with lacto￾ferrin-targeting was crafted for brain tumors. They conducted in vivo imaging on 
tumor-bearing mice using a modified tracer [14]. According to the imaging results, 
the MPI signals of the tumor-bearing mice have high sensitivity and contrast. The 
Jianghong Rao group designed a multimodality nanoparticle tracer that enabled 
multimodal imaging to detect tumor xenografts in living mice [14]. The imaging 
modalities included MPI, MRI, photoacoustic imaging, and fluorescent imaging 
using Fe3O4@ semiconducting polymer nanostructure [3] and had high biocompat￾ibility. According to the in vivo MPI results, the designed nanoparticles had slower 
reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake and a significantly longer half-life in blood 
circulation and were more effective for passive tumor targeting via the EPR effect 
than VivoTrax [14].
10.2.1.2. Blood Pool Imaging
MPI shows generates better blood pool imaging as compared to CT and MRI due to 
high image contrast and high sensitivity. MPI resolves the main problems of blood 
pool imaging by distinguishing the blood in the capillaries from that in the surround￾ing tissues. MPI detects only the magnetic nanoparticles in the blood and does not 
image surrounding tissues that do not contain magnetic nanoparticles, the device 
will generate images that can more easily distinguish blood and the surrounding tis￾sues. At present, MPI is used in the measurement of intestinal bleeding [15], cerebral 
blood volume [16], and brain injury [17] and has provided significant research results. 
Conolly studies confirmed that MPI enabled the high contrast visualization of gas￾trointestinal (GI) bleeding in a GI polyp development mouse model according to the 
aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles. The intensity of the MPI signal was linearly 
correlated with the mass of magnetic nanoparticles; the device could achieve gut 
bleed quantification using a nonradioactive and long-circulating PEGylated tracer. 
The Conolly group also explored the application of MPI in imaging traumatic brain 
injury [17]. Research showed that MPI could detect the initial stage of traumatic 
brain injury and the corresponding hematoma in the closed skull. In addition, the 
device could be used to determine the location, severity, and depth of bleeding of any Applications in Cell and Molecular Biology 215
traumatic brain injury in the closed skull. Another study also confirms that MPI can 
also detect changes in cerebral blood volume
10.2.1.3. Hyperthermia
Magnetic hyperthermia therapy kills cancer cells by heating tumor tissue. The 
approach includes delivering superparamagnetic nanoparticles to tumors and then 
adding a high-frequency AMF that has no limitation on penetration depth. The par￾ticles, in response to the AMF, generate and release heat to the surrounding envi￾ronment. To protect healthy tissues from heat, accurate dosage is needed to ensure 
that the tumor cells are killed without damaging the surrounding healthy tissues. 
Therefore, the precise targeting and dose control of magnetic hyperthermia are criti￾cal problems to be solved in clinical practice [18]. Because SPIONs can generate MPI 
signals and heat simultaneously, MPI can form a platform for precise real-time visu￾alized magnetic hyperthermia based on those particles [19]. Precise heating loca￾tion can be achieved if the nanoparticles are transferred to the tumor area and the 
hyperthermia treatment is limited to the treatment area. Therefore, MPI can achieve 
precision in magnetic hyperthermia because, according to its imaging principle. MPI 
can enable dose planning for hyperthermia. The Conolly group demonstrated the 
application of MPI in hyperthermia and achieved dose planning and heat location. 
This idea was proven through a series of experiments, including in vitro experiments, 
in vivo experiments, and real-time temperature monitoring [18–19].
10.3. THERAPEUTIC USES OF MNPs
MNPs have a range of uses, including enhancing the signal obtained from magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, promoting the accumulation and deposition 
of biotherapeutic compounds such as genes and peptides in rewarding micro niches, 
and mediating the destruction of cancer cells and biofilms through the production of 
a local thermo-ablative effect, often referred to as magnetic hyperthermia [20].
10.3.1. MNPs and Targeted Drug Delivery
The use of therapeutic cells, proteins, and nucleic acids in the treatment of various 
conditions is a highly active area of research. To address this, novel magnetically 
driven delivery systems have been developed to facilitate the fast, efficient, and 
site-specific delivery of biotherapeutic interventions [20].
10.3.2.  Therapeutic Viruses
Therapeutic viruses have been touted as a potential cancer therapy for decades with 
adenoviruses considered one of the most powerful gene-delivery systems. However, 
there are several challenges relating to nonspecific immune responses to their appli￾cation. In addition, through the application of an external magnetic field, virus-conju￾gated MNPs can be targeted to specific sites improving gene transfection efficiency; 
this process is otherwise known as magnetofection [21].216 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
10.3.3. Nucleic Acid and Protein Delivery
Nucleic acid and protein-based treatments are largely dependent on successful cel￾lular uptake. Given the concerns surrounding viral safety and costly production 
methods, nonviral vectors, such as the use of MNPs as vectors, are highly sought 
after. Here, external magnetic fields are used to manipulate SPNs into promoting 
the accumulation and deposition of nucleic acid-based therapies often leading to the 
expression or suppression of a gene. Nawwab Al-Deen et al. [22] used an improved 
experimental design to enhance the transfection of P. yoelii merozoite MSP119 and 
maturation of dendritic cells. Given the MSP119 protein can confer resistance to 
malaria, these results demonstrate the potential for MNPs to contribute to the pre￾vention of infectious diseases as well as their treatment. These results indicate that 
the delivery of therapeutic peptides might be significantly improved using a magnet￾ically driven approach [23].
10.3.4.  Cell-Based Therapies
Stem cell and immune cell-based therapies have long been investigated as treatments 
for various life-threatening conditions, such as ischemia. However, poor cell reten￾tion often hinders cell transplantation efforts [24]. In response, MNPs have been con￾jugated to the surface of stem cells and immune cells to improve graft retention and 
subsequent gene transfection. Kyrtatos et al. (2009) [25] demonstrated the successful 
delivery of human CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells to sites of vascular injury to 
male Sprague–Dawley rats (carotid artery injury models) in vivo. Through the appli￾cation of an external magnetic field accumulating MNPs at sites of catheterization. 
More recently, the therapeutic potential of nanoparticle-labeled cardiospheres in vivo 
has been demonstrated. Here, they injected nanoparticle-labeled cardiospheres into 
the left ventricular cavity of female Wistar Kyoto rats, leading to fourfold higher cell 
retention in both the short term (24-hour period) and long-term (3-week period). It 
is also possible, in addition to functionalizing the cell membranes of immune cells 
with SPNs, to stimulate the endocytosis of MNPs by cells of interest allowing the 
host cell to then exhibit superparamagnetic properties demonstrating an example of 
molecular mimesis [26].
10.4. DIAGNOSIS
10.4.1.  Cancer Diagnosis
Cancer screening is an important factor that contributes to the reduction of the inci￾dence, morbidity, and mortality of cancer. In the case of cervical cancer, the effects 
of screening are considerably dramatic, with a decrease in mortality of over 80% . 
Similarly, early detection is a critical factor in patient survival rate; as for detection of 
the primary tumor through routine cancer screenings, the prognosis is usually fatal [27]. 
Thus the common goal of cancer screening and early detection is to detect the malig￾nancy or preneoplastic states prior to the symptom onset, as the treatment is the 
most effective at this point [27]. Biomarkers are biological molecular entities that Applications in Cell and Molecular Biology 217
can be objectively measured and are associated with physiological functions, disease 
progression, treatment efficiency, and adverse effects to a therapeutic agent [28, 29]. 
Cancer biomarkers are biological molecules produced by cancer cells or body tissues 
as a response to cancer development, and they indicate tumor progression [28, 29]. 
Nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, oncofetal antigens, cytokeratins, carbohydrates, or 
hormones can serve as biomarkers, and they can be found in biological fluids, includ￾ing blood, saliva, urine, stool, sputum, and cerebrospinal fluid, as circulating cancer 
cells or cell-free cancer DNA, which enters by direct release from the original tissue 
through the necrotic tumor cells by phagocytosis or cell lysis [27–29]. Although there 
is a tremendous scientific focus on the discovery of novel cancer biomarkers [30], 
most biomarkers have proven to have poor accuracy and efficacy [28]. Magnetic par￾ticles have proven their important potential in cancer imaging, diagnosis, and treat￾ment. Conventional cancer imaging techniques include magnetic resonance imaging, 
magneto-acoustic tomography, computed tomography, and near-infrared imaging. 
Consequently, magnetic particle imaging is a tracer imaging modality that directly 
measures superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles based on their vivo relaxation 
dynamics. This technique is characterized by several advantages, including high 
image contrast, signal linear with the tracer concentration, no depth attenuations, 
high sensitivity, high temporal resolution, and safety, as it does not involve ionizing 
radiation [28, 29]. Hence, by accurately binding to specific molecules from the bio￾logical sample, magnetic particles could aid the detection of trace analytes that are 
relevant to cancer diagnosis. Thereupon, they could allow for the early detection of 
malignancy prior and possibility of developing novel cancer therapies with higher 
survival rates.
10.4.2.  Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases
Infectious diseases can be defined as disorders caused by pathogenic microorgan￾isms, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, or fungi, which can be directly or indirectly 
spread from one individual to another [31]. Infectious diseases and their worldwide 
spread have become a serious public health concern, as they affect millions of lives 
daily [32, 33]. The effective, early diagnose of infectious diseases is a major issue, 
since rapid diagnostic tools could reduce the incidence of these disorders and the 
risk of developing antimicrobial resistance, avoid overtreatment due to the adminis￾tration of inadequate treatment, allow for distinction between pathogens that present 
similar symptoms, and prevent deterioration and further spreading. Standard clin￾ical diagnosis techniques include invasive detection through biopsy or endoscopy 
and biomarker-based diagnostic tools, such as microscopy, cultures, enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, lateral flow assay, and polymerase chain reaction [32, 33]. 
By integrating magnetic nanoparticles into bioassays and biosensing devices, rapid 
diagnosis could be achieved without sample pre-enrichment, purification, or pre￾treatment steps. Thus magnetic particles could be applied for the specific isolation 
of biomarkers related to infectious diseases [32]. There have been several studies 
in the literature reporting the use of magnetic particles for the detection of viruses. 
Specifically, hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus were captured and detected using 218 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
carboxyl-derivatized magnetic beads [34] and magnetic digital microfluidic systems 
[35], respectively, with improved specificity and virus liberation from the matrix. 
Furthermore, one study reported the targeting and isolation of the influenza virus 
using erythrocyte-membrane-cloaked nanoparticles modified with magnetic func￾tionalities by encapsulating superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. The detec￾tion of the chikungunya virus has also gained considerable interest, with applications 
relying on gold and iron oxide nanocomposite systems [34] and retroviral-based 
virus-like particles in magnetic-bead-based platforms [35]. Other studies have 
focused on the detection of adenoviruses and rotaviruses using magnetic particles 
functionalized with monoclonal antibodies [34, 35]. Moreover, the detection of bac￾teria has witnessed considerable advancements through the use of magnetic particles. 
Thus, Gram-negative bacteria, especially L. monocytogenes, have been efficiently 
captured using vancomycin-functionalized polyethylene glycol-modified magnetic 
nanoparticles, due to their surface moieties [35].
10.4.3. Nucleic Acid Detection
The high binding capacity, specificity of binding, and the fast-magnetic response 
makes MNPs ideal for nucleic acid detection in high-throughput samples requiring 
fast turnaround time. Infectious disease identification MBs introduce a new technical 
approach of nucleic acid isolation by coupling with molecules that bind specifically 
to nucleic acids and can be easily isolated by applying magnetic fields. Parham et al. 
[36] developed a specific and efficient DNA capture method that is compatible with 
both PCR and nonamplification detection technologies for Group B streptococci 
(GBS) identification. Superparamagnetic beads were functionalized with oligonucle￾otide capture probes of different lengths used to capture GBS genomic DNA (gDNA) 
[37]. Captured DNA was then detected using quantitative PCR. Technologies such 
as polymeric biosensors could provide a rapid and sensitive method for nucleic acid 
detection from diverse organic samples. A magnetic nanobiosensor uses MBs coated 
with SA and biotin-labeled antibodies against Salmonella enteritidis to capture 
Salmonella enteritidis in milk, cheese, and water, while visual quantitative detec￾tion is carried out through signal amplification by horseradish peroxidase (HR) [38]. 
In another study, fluorescent MNPs was used for simultaneous detection of H9N2, 
H1N1, and H7N9 avian influenza viruses. The application of MNPs can capture and 
separate target chains without sample pretreatment, and single particle counting can 
be performed by fluorescence. This method has simple signal amplification steps, 
high detection sensitivity, and great potential in the early diagnosis of various dis￾eases. Silica modified MNPs could be used to extract virus (HBV, HCV, and HIV) 
nucleic acids and amplify them [39]. A new point-of-care test (POCT) system was 
designed based on MNPs. After testing the performance of the instrument, an auto￾matic real-time adenovirus detection experiment was carried out. The experimental 
results are similar to those of commercial systems, proving the reliability of the sys￾tem. Magnetic nanobeads (MagNBs) could be combined with gold nanoparticles in a 
silica shell to carry out enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to monitor, reduce the 
spread of, and provide immediate clinical treatment to influenza A virus [37].Applications in Cell and Molecular Biology 219
10.4.4. Mutation Site Detection
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common variation in the human 
genome. The study of SNPs helps to explain the phenotypic differences of indi￾viduals and the susceptibility of different groups and individuals to complex dis￾eases. Some SNPs are mutation sites of disease-causing genes, which have practical 
research significance and application prospect in various aspects such as suscep￾tibility assessment, early diagnosis, and prevention and treatment of diseases [38, 
39]. Due to the special physicochemical properties and biocompatibility of MNPs, 
such as high separation speed, high efficiency, reusability, simple operation, no need 
of expensive instruments, and no influence on the activity of separated substances, 
they have been widely used in various biological detections. In a reported study [40], 
short DNA-modified NP-labeled was used with hundreds of biological barcoded 
DNA (Bbc-Au NP) as a signal probe, along with another DNA-modified magnetic 
microparticle (Oligo-MMP) as a capture probe to form a Bbc-Au NP/DNAtarget/
Oligo-MMP hybrid structure after complementary pairing. The unlabeled detection 
and SNP detection of the target DNA can be executed at the same time. Li designed 
a high throughput, automated SNP genotyping method based on AuMNP arrays and 
dual-color single-base extension. The advantage of this assay is that it does not need 
to carry out the necessary procedures for purification and complex reduction of PCR 
products, simplifying the process and increasing the potential for automation [41]. 
First, the biotin-labeled primer was captured by SA-GMNPs, the ssPCR product 
was hybridized with the primer to carry out the dual-color single-base extension, the 
fluorophore GMNP complex of each sample was fixed on the slide, and the genotype 
of each sample was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the fluo￾rophore GMNP complex on the array. Another study [42] confirms the use of ExoIII 
nuclease and MNPs for SNP typing and detection, which use a double-probe detec￾tion system with signal amplification. Ge used a method based on the color change of 
a solution caused by AuNP enrichment to observe and detect DNA methylation [43]. 
The probe was released by thermal denaturation and added to the unmodified AuNP 
solution. Salt-induced aggregation was used for colorimetric detection. Compared 
with other methods using sodium bisulfite and methylation-specific restriction 
enzymes, this method provided a simpler rapid DNA methylation detection. Through 
a new HCR-BRCA strategy, Dadmehr developed a very sensitive and convenient 
fluorescent biosensor based on Fe3O4 /Au core/shell NPs for rapid detection of 
DNA methylation. After the target unmethylated and methylated ssDNA was added, 
the fluorescence intensity increased linearly with the increase of unmethylated 
ssDNA concentration. This detection system will be applied to the early diagnosis of 
methylation-dependent diseases such as cancer [44].
10.5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTIVE
In the past decade, MNPs, have proved a useful tool in promoting the deposition of 
therapeutic compounds, in mediating the destruction of cancer cells and biofilms, 
and in improving the sensitivity of MRI techniques. Production of specialized encap￾sulation strategies has shown that MNPs can now be targeted to specific tissues, 220 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
including cancer cells, revealing the possibility for a novel personalized approach to 
MNP-mediated treatment. Similarly, developments in the field of magnetic hyper￾thermia have mediated near complete tumor regression and the resenitization of 
drug-resistant bacterial strains to antibiotics. These features characterize MNPs as 
versatile and adaptable tools for use in a broad range of biomedical contexts
Although MNPs have many advantages, improvements are still needed in many 
aspects. First, the magnetic separation performance of MNPs should be improved, 
thus meeting the application requirements in fast response and accurate positioning 
under an external magnetic field. Second, MNPs stability could be improved because 
it directly affects its application; for example, storage stability could be improved so 
that MNPs can be shipped and stored at room temperature. Finally, preparation of 
MNPs with multifunction improves surface functionalization and ligand bonding 
efficiency. MNPs combined with molecular diagnostic systems are used to develop 
fully automatic and closed nucleic acid detection assays. If detection time and sensi￾tivity can be improved, it will have great impact in clinical detection, biomedicine, 
and other fields.

11.1. INTRODUCTION
Significant environmental components such as soil, water, and air can become 
contaminated by various microorganisms, leading to issues with living condi￾tions, public health, and industries. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens (bacte￾ria, fungi, viruses) are an emerging problem worldwide. MDR pathogens threaten 
global public health, leading to more extended hospital stays, higher medical costs, 
greater mortality, and morbidity. Superbugs are strains of bacteria, fungi, and 
viruses resistant to several types of antibiotics, which are the potentially most dan￾gerous and current threats to us. The most commonly described multidrug-resistant 
bacteria are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Salmonella spp. (WHO 2018). Antibiotics 
are typically used for treating infections triggered by microbes. However, due to 
increased antibiotic use, a huge number of the bacteria are multidrug resistant. 
The field of medical science faces numerous challenges due to the growing rate 
of drug-resistant microorganisms. The field of nanotechnology has emerged in the 
creation of promising nanomaterials that could potentially replace conventional 
antibiotics. For centuries, metallic copper has been utilized as an antimicrobial 
agent for wound treatment and water sterilization. In recent years, nanotechnology 
has drawn much interdisciplinary effort and is being integrated into all aspect of 
the betterment of human life.
Nanotechnology gifts us novel prospects for exploring the bactericidal and fun￾gicidal effects of novel Ag-, Zn-, and Cu-based NPs and iron-oxide-based MNPs. 
Metallic Cu NP and Cu-based NP MNPs also exhibit strong antimicrobial activity 
against various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and viruses, with 
Cu and Ag being anciently used for water and food preservation (Mallick et al. 2021; 
Mallick and Sabui 2021; Sabui et al. 2023). Since ancient times, MNPs have been 
used in medicinal applications. Neel’s groundbreaking research on the magnetic 224 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
behavior of MNPs, which was published in the 1950s, led to the development of 
magnetically active nanostructures (with sizes in the range of 1–100 nm), which 
are now valuable materials for science and technology, especially since 2000. Nano 
entities exhibit resilience, flexibility, and reactivity, with unique characteristics like 
high surface-area-to-volume ratio and size-dependent magnetic properties. MNPs 
are nanomaterials with ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism that are made of 
magnetic elements like iron, cobalt, and nickel, as well as their alloys. Due to these 
qualities, MNPs have drawn a lot of interest in a wider range of application areas, 
including imaging, gyroscopic devices, spintronics, magnetic fluids, data and energy 
storage and harvesting, environmental tools, and catalysis.
In light of their unique magnetic properties—superparamagnetism, high satu￾ration fields, extra anisotropic contributions that are tunable by external magnetic 
fields, and interactions with biological and pharmaceutical entities—MNPs with 
sizes ranging from 1 nm to 100 nm have been studied thoroughly in comparison to 
bulk components. MNPs are an important class of nanomaterials that can be applied 
to modern diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (De et al. 2017). Numerous appli￾cations, particularly in the fields of targeted drug delivery, MRI, and antimicrobials, 
have been made possible by the research on MNPs. MNPs are suitable for magnetic 
applications such as the magnetic separation of biomolecules, small molecules and 
cells, magnetic hyperthermia treatment, multimodal imaging, tissue repair, and so 
on due to their high biocompatibility and ability to respond to external magnetic 
fields. In recent years, there has been an increase in fascination with the application 
of nanotechnology. MNPs of sizes ranging from 1 nm to 100 nm were specially 
studied compared to bulk parts due to their unique magnetic properties such as 
superparamagnetism, high saturation field, an extra anisotropic contribution that 
the external magnetic field can manipulate, and their action toward biological and 
drug entities. MNPs are a major class of nanomaterials that can be used in modern 
therapeutic and diagnostic methods. The studies in MNPs have opened the door 
to a wide variety of applications, especially in antimicrobial, MRI, and targeted 
drug delivery. The ability of MNPs to respond to external magnetic fields and high 
biocompatibility makes the MNPs suitable for magnetic applications, such as mag￾netic separations of biomolecules, small molecules and cells, magnetic hyperther￾mia treatment, multimodal imaging, and tissue repair. The multifunctional MNPs 
are emerging in the field of antibacterial activities (Rehman et al. 2019). Antibiotics 
are generally treated against bacterial infections. However, much use of the bacte￾ria poses multidrug resistance from an increased use of antibiotics. The increasing 
rate of microbial resistance against drugs causes many complications in the field 
of medical science. Nanotechnology has emerged in the field of creating prom￾ising nanomaterials to replace traditional antibiotics. MNPs’ magnetic properties 
offer a broad range of biological applications, from in vivo therapeutics to diagnos￾tics (Martins et al. 2021). MNPs have the potential for magnetic applications such 
as tissue repair, multimodal imaging, biomolecule separation, and hyperthermia 
treatment due to their high biocompatibility and capacity for response to external 
magnetic fields. Many research groups are now concentrating on various areas of 
knowledge associated with MNPs.Antimicrobial Applications 225
11.2. SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES OF MNPs
MNPs have garnered significant interest across various domains due to their dis￾tinct characteristics and varied uses. The size, shape, and other characteristics of 
the MNPs are determined by their synthesis techniques, which also affect how 
well suited they are for particular uses. Physical, chemical, biological, or hybrid 
 methods—combinations of multiple approaches—can be used for producing MNPs. 
Stable and biocompatible MNPs have found applications in antimicrobial, drinking 
water, and wastewater treatment, anticorrosion or self-healing coatings, biosensors, 
anticancer medications, targeted drug delivery, and the destruction of cancer-caus￾ing cells in pharmacological applications. The most popular and useful methods 
for synthesizing MNPs and their applications have been covered here. MNPs are 
characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy 
(FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), 
X-ray diffraction (XRD)‚ Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) 
spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and vibrator sample mag￾netometer (VSM). FESEM and TEM were used to visualize the morphology of the 
SPION. Several phases of iron oxide nanoparticles, including hematite ( ) - Fe O2 3 , 
maghemite ( ) - Fe O2 3 , and magnetite ( ) Fe3 4 O , have been investigated using Raman 
spectroscopy.
11.3. WET CHEMICAL
Sol–gel, co-precipitation, and hydrothermal synthesis, among others, are examples 
of wet chemical processes that have been developed for producing ultrafine, highly 
homogeneous, and high-purity nanoparticles. Bomila et al. successfully synthesized 
lanthanum-doped ZnO nanoparticles using zinc acetate and lanthanum nitrate, mea￾suring their magnetic properties using VSM analysis (2018).
11.4. CO-PRECIPITATION METHOD
The co-precipitation method is a widely used synthesis method for MNPs because 
this method is very fast, simple, and suitable in mild conditions. In this method, 
aqueous metal salts are mixed at sufficient temperatures with a base, which acts 
as a precipitating agent (Yazid and Joon 2019). Batch variability is influenced by 
factors like pH, medium ionic strength, and reaction temperature during synthesis. 
The formation of MNPs depends on the base used when a mixture of Fe(II) ion and 
Fe(III) aqueous salt solution is mixed under an inert atmosphere. Compared with 
another method of synthesis, co-precipitation is more facile and convenient (Yazid 
and Joon 2019). The researchers synthesized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles using 
co-precipitation in the water phase, a minor modification; 100 mL of deionized water 
were used to dissolve a mixture of 25 mM FeCl2 and 50 mM Fe N( ) O3 2 , which was 
then mixed and heated to 25°C for an hour in a nitrogen atmosphere. Next, using a 
burette, 0.5 mM deoxygenated 125 mL NaOH was added to the solution that has 
a 2:1 ratio of Fe3+ to Fe2+ . The resultant solution was again stirred for 1 hour for 
 
 226 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
complete precipitation. As soon as the MNP stopped growing with the excess NaOH, 
the NaOH titration was stopped. Following complete precipitation, the precipitate 
was repeatedly cleaned with distilled water and dried at 600°C for an entire night. 
The solution turned black as a result of the iron reacting with the base, indicating 
the formation of MNP (Yazid and Joon 2019). By using the co-precipitation method, 
pure NiO and different concentrations of Nd3+ -ion-doped NiO ( 0.01M, 0.02M , and 
0.03M ) nanoparticles were produced by Rahman and his group. The study exam￾ined the magnetic behavior at room temperature at different concentrations of Nd 
doping. The Rahman et al. (2018) study demonstrated that NiO and Nd-doped NiO 
nanoparticles (NI1−x
 NdxO with size 28 nm) demonstrated superior antibacterial prop￾erties compared to the commercial antibiotic erythromycin (Rahman et al. 2018).
11.5. HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS
The hydrothermal method is one of the most common syntheses for MNPs. In this 
method, the formation of nanoparticles can happen at a wide range of temperatures 
from room temperature to very high temperature. Many types of MNPs have been 
successfully synthesized by this method. Using this method, we can synthesize the 
MNPs that are not stable at high temperatures, and the material with high vapor pres￾sure can also prepared without loss of material (Haw et al. 2010). Daou et al. (2006) 
reported the synthesis of Fe2.95O4 MNPs, with an average grain size of 39±5 nm in 
a controlled stoichiometry and ferrimagnetic behavior at room temperature, by using 
a hydrothermal process. The magnetic measurements show that the powder obtained 
after hydrothermal treatment had ferrimagnetic behavior at room temperature with 
a saturation magnetization of 82.5 emu/g, near that of bulk magnetite (Daou et al. 
2006). Haw et  al. (2010) successfully synthesized superparamagnetic ( ) Fe3 4 O
MNPs using a hydrothermal method. The superparamagnetic behavior of these 
Fe3 4 O MNPs at room temperature has been measured with VSM. FeCl2 2 .4H O and 
FeCl3 , with NaOH acting as a reducing agent, are precursors in the hydrothermal 
process that precipitate Fe3 4 O and then undergo hydrothermal processing to yield 
Fe3 4 O NPs. To improve both the biocompatibility and stability of the as-prepared 
Fe3 4 O NPs, chitosan was coated to their surface. The average diameter of the parti￾cles, according to TEM as well as XRD data, was 17.22 nm, and good crystallinity 
was maintained (Haw et al. 2010).
11.6. SOLVOTHERMAL
An alternative to the hydrothermal method, the solvothermal method employs 
organic solvents as the reaction medium. A “hydrothermal condition” is one in 
which the temperature is above boiling and the pressure is increased above atmo￾spheric pressure. Solvothermal synthesis is a technique that involves heating reac￾tants in an autoclave, usually composed of Teflon or stainless steel, to create MNPs 
(Ni et al. 2022). MNPs with regulated crystal structures and enhanced crystallinity 
can be produced using this technique. Additionally, organic solvents avoid aggrega￾tion during synthesis and offer improved control over growth kinetics. For example, 
polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG1000) was used as a surfactant, ethylene glycol as a 
 Antimicrobial Applications 227
dispersion medium, and ferric trichloride hexahydrate and sodium acetate as raw 
materials by Ni et al. (2022) in the solvothermal method to produce Fe3 4 O NPs. 
The NPs have been characterized using a zeta potentiometer, TGA, XRD, HRTEM, 
VSM, TGA, and FT-IR (Ni et al. 2022). There are a lot of different types of micro￾organisms in the nanometer-to-micrometer dimensions range. The threat of deadly 
infections caused by bacterial agents has decreased due to the great potential of engi￾neered MNPs in therapeutic procedures toward a variety of drug-resistant bacte￾ria. Numerous biocompatible MNPs with impressive effects on a range of bacterial 
strains have recently been introduced. The production of MNPs has largely relied on 
conventional synthesis techniques like co-precipitation and hydrothermal processes. 
The MNPs for antibacterial applications are mainly required to be superparamag￾netic, recyclable, and nontoxic. CuFe2 4 O MNPs have been produced by solvother￾mal synthesis and utilized as a productive magnetic precursor for the immobilization 
of papain before their antibacterial properties were examined (Atacan et al. 2018). 
Atacan et al. observed stronger antibacterial activity when CuFe2 4 O MNPs were 
doped with Ag NPs against both Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. 
coli bacteria (Atacan et al. 2018). Gheidari et al. (2020) synthesized spherical cobalt 
ferrite MNPs in the size range of 20–33 nm using polyethylene glycol as a solvent by 
the solvothermal method in a surfactant-free condition and studied bacteriostatic and 
bactericidal effects (Gheidari et al. 2020).
11.7. SOL–GEL METHOD
For the production of MNPs, the sol–gel method is a flexible and popular technique. 
Synthesizing MNPs involves dissolving a molecular precursor in water or alcohol, 
heating, stirring, and forming a sol, which is then transformed into a gel and dried. 
Particle size and morphology can be precisely controlled using this method by vary￾ing the pH, reaction conditions, and precursor concentration. Moreover, dopants can 
be added using the sol–gel method to change the properties of NPs for particular 
uses.
Lemine et al. (2012) synthesized Fe3 4 O MNPs using a sol–gel method and charac￾terized them using various advanced instruments. Their results showed single-phase, 
spherical NPs (8 nm) with a homogeneous size distribution, and room temperature 
ferromagnetics behavior was confirmed by SQUID measurements (Lemine et  al. 
2012). Hashemi and colleagues used egg white protein (albumin) heated to 800°C to 
produce cobalt ferrite MNPs using the sol–gel autocombustion technique. Albumin 
was added, which resulted in a smaller crystallite CoFe2 4 O size as well as higher 
saturation magnetization and coercivity. Because of the albumin, there is a cation 
redistribution that modifies coercivity and magnetization, which in turn modifies 
magnetic anisotropy and inversion degree (Hashemi et al. 2023)
11.8. MICROEMULSION METHOD
The word “microemulsion” was proposed by Schulman et al. in 1959. Nowadays, 
microemulsion has a wide range of applications, especially in the field of synthe￾sizing NPs and MNPs. Microemulsions comprise at least three components: a polar 
 228 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
phase (typically water), a nonpolar phase (typically oil), as well as a surfactant 
(Salvador et  al. 2021). They are isotropic, macroscopically uniform, and thermo￾dynamically stable solutions. Salvador et al. (2021) synthesized superparamagnetic 
nanoparticles (SPIONs) using the microemulsion method. Because of the effective 
control over the shape, composition, and size of the MNPs produced, microemulsion 
techniques could prove beneficial. Their synthesized SPIONs with average diame￾ters between 5 4. nm and 7 2. nm and large monodispersity have been synthesized 
through precipitation in a W/O microemulsion, with cetyl trimethyl ammonium bro￾mide (CTAB) as a main surfactant, 1-butanol as a cosurfactant, and 1-hexanol as the 
continuous oily phase (Salvador et al. 2021).
11.9. GREEN SYNTHESIS
Green techniques for the biosynthesis of MNPs have been developed, utilizing a vari￾ety of biological systems, including microorganisms and plant extracts. Plant extract 
is a cost-effective and easily accessible reducing agent, containing a blend of inor￾ganic and organic agents among its constituents. Kombaiah et al. (2018) developed a 
green method for synthesizing cobalt ferrite NPs using the okra plant (Abelmoschus 
esculentus) as a reducing agent in the conventional and microwave heating methods 
(Kombaiah et al. 2018). Furthermore, the synthesized CoFe2 4 O NPs, which existed 
as ferromagnets, showed exceptional antimicrobial activity toward bacterial and fun￾gal strains. Recently, Eldeep and his colleagues synthesized highly crystalline super￾paramagnetic SPIONs by environmentally friendly synthesis using Citrus sinensis
peel extract (Eldeeb et al. 2023). These SPIONs demonstrated strong antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and catalytic dye degradation activities (Li et  al. 2019). along 
with a range of antimicrobial effects against different pathogenic bacteria that were 
resistant to multiple drugs. Under an alternating magnetic field, the Fe3 4 O demon￾strated optimal magnetic hyperthermia techniques, qualifying them for use in bio￾medical applications (Eldeeb et al. 2023).
Thakur et al. (2020) produced barium ferrite NPs ( BaFe12 19 O NPs) in an envi￾ronmentally friendly way using an extract from the rhizome of the Acorus calamus. 
Powder X-ray diffraction and SEM were used to confirm the formation of BaFe12 19 O
NPs, with an average grain size of 70 nm. These MNPs demonstrated antifungal 
activity against a range of plant pathogenic fungi, with 600 mg / L showing the 
highest percentage of mycelial growth inhibition (76.67%) (Thakur et  al. 2020). 
According to their sizes, Table 11.1 lists the different MNPs that were synthesized 
via various synthesis techniques.
11.10. BACTERICIDAL EFFECT OF MNPs
Bacteria are microscopic, prokaryotic, unicellular organisms that live in symbiotic 
and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Bacteria are ubiquitously in the 
environment and are beneficial to life, but some can cause severe detriment. Bacterial 
infections cause 300 million cases of severe illness each year worldwide (Gupta et al. 
2016, 2019). Antibiotic medications are generally used to kill or inhibit the growth 
of bacteria and other microbes. Since available antibiotics inhibit DNA replication,

protein synthesis, and cell wall synthesis, the number of conventional antibiotic-resis￾tant genes is rising in a variety of bacterial species, impacting both humans and ani￾mals. The overexpression of specific enzymes by bacteria, such as aminoglycosides 
and b-lactamases, can result in the breakdown of antibiotics, including beta-lactams, 
penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, and carbapenems. Antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria can be caused by chromosomal mutations, inductive gene expression, DNA 
exchange, bacteriophage, or extrachromosomal DNA conjugation by plasmids. DNA 
conjugation via plasmid transfer is a usual procedure found in anaerobic species, 
pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae.230 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can self-colonize to form biofilms that 
are resistant to the host’s endogenous defenses (Li et al. 2019). Because bacteria’s extra￾cellular matrix forms a microenvironment that allows them to evade immune responses 
and develop resistance to conventional antibiotics, biofilm infections are difficult to treat. 
The overuse of antibiotics in the community and hospitals against pathogenic bacteria 
causes adverse effects (Raffi et al. 2010) on human beings and the environment. The 
emergence of antibiotic-resistant novel bacteriological strains is a serious public health 
concern because it raises the possibility of fatal infections. The creation of novel bac￾tericidal materials is essential, but bacterial biofilms present formidable obstacles. The 
bioactivity of MNPs, both as free ions and as complex species, is well-known and has 
been documented for many years (Rehman et al. 2019). MNPs are unique antibacterial 
NPs due to their reaction to magnetic fields, requiring superparamagnetic, recyclable, 
and biocompatible properties for their use in antibacterial applications. When magnetic 
fields and different sizes and concentrations of MNPs are combined, the biofilm matrix 
undergoes damage. and detachment occurs. According to Li et al. (2019), MNPs can 
deeply penetrate biofilms, causing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) disruption 
and potentially leading to the biofilm’s removal through detachment and breakup (Li et al. 
2019). They find that treatments with 30 mg mL−1 of 11 nm iron-oxide MNPs can reduce 
biofilm bacteria by as much as 5 log10 when applied in a magnetic field (Li et al. 2019).
MNPs and bacteria’s interactions are influenced by various factors such as van 
der Waals forces, hydrophobic and receptor-ligand interactions, and electrostatic 
attraction. The interaction of iron-oxide-based magnetic NPs (Fe O - Fe O
( ) 3 4 and γ 2 3),
copper ferrite NPs CuFe2 4 O , and nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) with bacteria/biofilm 
matrices plays a crucial role in designing MNP-based antibacterial systems (Gupta 
et al. 2016, 2019). The way that MNPs and microbes interact is greatly influenced by 
the structure of the bacterial cell wall. Given that the size and shape of the MNPs are 
anticipated to directly affect how the bacteria and their biofilms are affected, flow 
cytometric assay, agarose gel electrophoresis for realizing the interaction between 
DNA and MNPs, zeta potential (ζ) measurements, FESEM, TEM analysis, fluores￾cence microscopic, and spectroscopic investigation were performed to understand 
the mechanism of bactericidal action of MNPs and MNP-based hybrid NPs by 
numerous research groups. MNPs and MNP-based hybrid NPs adhere to the bacte￾rial cell wall. It has been reported that smaller-sized MNPs, were able to create pores 
on the bacterial cell wall, which led to perforation of the cell wall causing irrepara￾ble damage to the membrane. Using chemical-based co-precipitation and gas phase 
condensation techniques, Bhosale et al. (2018) synthesized NiFe2O4 NPs and inves￾tigated their antimicrobial properties on two Gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcus 
pyogenes and S. aureus, two Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella typhmurium, and 
E. coli, and one fungal species, Candida albicans. NiFe2 4 O NPs severely interfere 
with the cell’s metabolism, resulting in the production of intracellular ROS and 
an electrostatic interaction with bacteria that upsets the cell’s metabolism (nucleic 
acid or protein synthesis) and ultimately results in cell death (Bhosale et al. 2018). 
Using sonochemical synthesis techniques, Rehman et al. synthesized Nd-substituted 
cobalt ferrite NPs, i.e., CoNdx
Fe2−xO4 ( ) 0 0. . x 0 2 NPs, and investigated their 
antibacterial and anticandidal efficacy against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans
(Rehman et al. 2019). Gheidari et al. (2020) reported that strong antibacterial activ￾ity against bacteria, especially Bacillus cereus, was demonstrated by CoFe2 4 O NPs. Antimicrobial Applications 231
The lowest IC50 for Bacillus cereus was 0.061 mg / ml , and the MBC and MIC val￾ues ranged from 0.12 mg/mL to 0.48 mg/mL. B. cereus and Pseudomonas aerugi‑
nosa were found to be sensitive and resistant, respectively (Gheidari et al. 2020). 
Chaurasia et  al. (2016) demonstrated the antibacterial efficacy of radiofrequency 
treatment, either in isolation or in conjunction with magnetic nanoparticle core-shell 
nanoparticles (MCSNPs) therapy (magnetic core Fe3 4 O coated with silica shell). 
As a control, different MCSNP concentrations, exposure durations, and incubation 
temperatures were tested to find the ideal conditions for 100% bacterial killing. 
The resulting ideal conditions were as follows: 1 1 × 08 UPEC cells were subjected 
to 0 4. MHz RF at 46°C for 30 minutes after receiving 1 mg / mL MCSNPs (10 pg 
per cell equivalent) (Figure 11.1a). Next, in the presence or absence of MCSNPs, the 
FIGURE 11.1 Antibacterial efficacy of radiofrequency treatment, either in isolation or 
in conjunction with Fe3 4 O @SiO2 therapy (RMT): (a) How different antibacterial therapies 
affect the death of UPEC. Combined with MCSNP treatment (RMT), radiofrequency (RF, 
400 kHz) demonstrated 100% killing in 30 minutes at 45°C. The figure legends indicate that 
the other conditions had substantially less antibacterial efficacy. (b) CFU measurements of the 
antibacterial efficacy of different treatments against EGFP-expressing UPEC. (c) The impact 
of RF duration on antimicrobial efficacy against either MCSNP-trapped (RMT) or free-living 
(RF only) UPEC. (d) UPEC microphotographs taken using an SEM under different conditions 
for 30 minutes. The UPEC cells were subjected to four different treatments: control at (I) 
25°C and (II) 46°C , (III) RF treatment alone at 46°C , and (IV) UPEC trapped with MCSNPs 
and treated by RF at 46°C (RMT).232 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
killing efficiency of the control condition was compared at 25°C ( ) RT and 46°C. 
While MCSNP-trapped bacteria at 25°Cand 46°C demonstrated roughly 30% and 
40% killing, respectively, UPEC incubated at 46°C for 30 minutes showed 37%
killing (Figure  11.1a, b). At 46°C, free bacteria without MCSNPs showed 60%
killing with RF, while at 46°C, RMT killed 100% of the bacteria in 30 minutes 
(Figure 11.1a, b). The efficacy of RF in conjunction with MCSNPs was evaluated 
by comparing the time-dependent killing that occurs during RF to RMT. It was dis￾covered that the bacterial killing efficiencies of RF and RMT were 28% and 65%, 
respectively, in the first 5 minutes. The efficiency of killing bacteria increased with 
the duration of exposure; for the RF and RMT treatments, 60% and 100% killing, 
respectively, were attained in 30 minutes (Figure 11.1c). SEM was employed, along 
with other controls like UPEC at 25°Cand 46°C, to monitor the phenotypic change 
during RF versus RMT on the exposed cells. SEM images showed changes in bacte￾rial cell surfaces during RMT (Figure 11.1d–IV) compared to 25°C, 46°C, and RF 
controls (Figure 11.1d I–III), while the RMT-treated bacteria showed changes in cell 
surface morphology (Figure 11.1d–IV) in comparison to the corresponding controls 
(Chaurasia et al. 2016).

11.11. MYCOCIDE OR FUNGAL GROWTH INHIBITION 
POTENTIAL MNPs
Fungi are nonphotosynthetic, filamentous eukaryotic microorganisms with hetero￾trophic nutrition, including yeasts, molds, rusts, smuts, mildews, and mushrooms. In 
the 21st century, invasive fungal infections—like mycoses—are a major contributor 
to a number of human diseases. They are frequently chronic, challenging to identify, 
and medication resistant. In the past 40 years, fungus plural fungi have become a 
major threat to human health due to the ever increasing number beyond normal of 
immunodeficient persons: those immunosuppressed due to therapy for cancer and 
organ transplantation, AIDS patients, and those undergoing major surgical proce￾dures (Cioffi et al. 2005). Mycoses can range in severity from superficial skin infec￾tions to systemic infections, some potentially fatal, in various organs, including the 
brain, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment of deeply 
invasive mycoses are frequently a challenge. The development of new approaches 
to the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections is the subject of inten￾sive research. As already outlined, fungi can also be harmful pathogenic agents, 
and copper has been used for decades as an effective fungicidal (Prasad Prajapati 
et  al. 2023). Pathogenic fungi, including Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum, 
and Neofusicoccum sp., infect various plant species, causing various diseases and 
ecological and economic issues worldwide. Fungicides that are specific to a given 
site are the most widely utilized technique for managing plant diseases. Because 
target fungi can develop a variety of defenses against pesticides, plant pathogenic 
fungi are able to adapt through mutations, which lowers the efficacy of fungicides 233 Antimicrobial Applications

(Hazra et al. 2023; Prasad Prajapati et al. 2023). Applications for NPs and MNPs in 
material science, engineering, biomedicine, and agriculture are very promising. NPs 
and MNPs have the pesticide effect that can be used to stop the growth of various 
pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi (Prasad Prajapati et al. 2023). MNPs 
are used in sewage treatment, water purification, crop micronutrients, animal feed, 
and herbicides. They also have the effect of a pesticide and stop the growth of patho￾gens. SPIONs, which function as both antimicrobial agents and stimulants of plant 
growth, have numerous benefits in the field of agriculture. Iron is a vital microele￾ment for numerous physiological functions in plants, including photosynthesis and 
chlorophyll. Parveen et al. (2018) prepared Fe2 3 O NPs with a 10–30 nm particle size 
using tannic acid as a reducing agent. They found that the Fe2 3 O NPs showed signif￾icant antifungal activity against various fungal pathogens. The highest inhibition was 
observed against Trichothecium roseum ( ) 87. % 14 , followed by Cladosporium her‑
barum ( ) 84. % 89 . The highest zone of inhibition was observed against Penicillium 
chrysogenum ( ) 28.67mm (Parveen et al. 2018). Giannousi et al. (2015) showed that 
30 nm copper(I) oxide NPs with antifungal properties, in combination with 9 nm 
nickel ferrite ( ) NiFe2 4 O MNPs to form NiFe2 4 O @Cu2O NCs nanocomposites 
(NCs), can be used to induce magneto-mechanical stress in Saccharomyces cere‑
visiae yeast culture. They revealed that the cells’ sensitivity to NCs increased when 
they were exposed to a low-frequency magnetic field (10 min, 30 Hz, 35 G) and that 
the nanosize effect was insignificant (Giannousi et al. 2015). The process includes 
breaking down the outer layer of cells and triggering programmed cell death. This 
creates new difficulties for smart device performance and product design, but it also 
makes it possible to measure magneto-mechanical properties and improve signal￾ing. The high biocompatibility of MNPs-based nanosystems is demonstrated by 
their ability to effectively inhibit fungal biofilm formation, maintain immunomodu￾latory properties, and not impede osteoblast viability or proliferation (Ashraf et al. 
2022). Table 11.3 summarizes the relationship of MNPs and their antifungal effects 
with different targeted fungi dosages, percentages of inhibition, and mechanisms 
of action. Niemirowicz et al. (2017) demonstrated that the use of LL-37 peptide and 
ceragenin-CSA-13 coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs@LL-37, MNPs@CSA-13) 
in treating clinical isolates of C. albicans leads to the generation of the reactive oxy￾gen species shown in Figure 11.2B (Niemirowicz et al. 2017). Data showed that after 
adding MNP@LL-37 and MNP@CSA-13, respectively, at a concentration of 100 μg/
mL, the electrokinetic mobility of the C. albicans changes from −11 eV to −8 eV or 
−6 eV (Figure 11.2C). The electrokinetic mobility of the cells changed after the addi￾tion of MNPs@LL-37 and MNPs@CSA-13, as shown by atomic force microscopy 
in Figure 2D, E. The proposed mechanism of cationic lipid-functionalized positively 
charged MNPs@LL-37 and MNPs@CSA-13 against fungi is shown in Figure 11.2A 
(Niemirowicz et al. 2017).

are generated via physical, chemical, and biological processes. The chemical and

indicates that MNPs, particularly antibacterial nanoagents, have significant thera￾peutic potential due to their favorable magnetic field response, large surface area, 
recyclability, and biocompatibility. Surface coating techniques, including biocom￾patible polymer layers, are crucial for improving MNPs’ ability to combat bacteria 
and incorporate other nanoparticles. MNPs can work in tandem with pathogens to 
cause both penetration and structural disruption (which is dependent on the NPs’ size 
and shape). These MNPs may be effective in treating microbial infections by causing 
damage to the cell wall, increasing membrane permeability, or producing reactive 
oxygen species. Like ferrous ions, the formation of ROS is the primary mechanism 
underlying SPIONs’ antibacterial effects. Furthermore, many formulations contain￾ing iron magnetic nanoparticles are being suggested as antimicrobials or treatments 
for infections. These MNPs may therefore be useful in the fight against microbial 
infections. By employing MNPs as a contrast agent and reducing prosthesis infection 
through bacterial death either alone or in conjunction with other antibiotics, a plat￾form based on nanotechnology offers a novel approach to treating chronic orthopedic 
implant infections. MNPs’ strong, consistent antibacterial efficacy during subsequent 
recycling makes them a promising new, biocompatible, and reusable antibacterial 
agent. MNPs have shown promising antimicrobial performance in vitro, but their in 
vivo applications are expected to be extraordinary with future research expanding 
the understanding of their biological and physiochemical properties.

Magnetic Nanoparticles 
in Nanotoxicology

Elyor Berdimurodov
12.1. INTRODUCTION
Nanostructured materials (Ns) are not a recent research topic since many Ns 
have been largely investigated and utilized in the past [1–3]. But the develop￾ing subject of nanotechnology usages has rapidly expanded into a large area of 
research in recent years [4]. To a certain degree, this rapid achievement can be 
attributed to the development of novel techniques for measuring, preparing, and 
seeing nanoparticles. The manufacture of new and sophisticated microscopes, 
equipment for preparing nanotechnology devices, nanocantilevers, innovative 
biological sensors capable of detecting multiple analytes, novel techniques of 
synthesizing and characterization, and many other factors are all contributing 
to the nanoparticle’s research field’s rapid development [5]. These new break￾throughs, collectively with the many and occasionally uncommon characteristics 
that the materials exhibit at the nanometer scale, make the nano field very appeal￾ing to many disciplines [6,7].
The growing field of nanotechnology is producing a wide range of novel nanoma￾terials; however, it is additionally creating specific problems, particularly ones con￾cerning human and ecological security [8]. Nanostructures are far more sophisticated 
when compared to other items, such as small medicinal medications or substances 
in the microscopic or macroscopic range. New nanoparticles are finding numerous 
applications in industries such as energy, food, cosmetics, medicine, textiles, con￾struction, and computing. Nanostructures (Ns) can enter live organisms through 
unexpected pathways and interact with their biological systems due to their small 
size. Nanostructures, whether intended or unintended, can cause toxicity on multiple 
levels, which should be thoroughly investigated [9].
Nanoscale materials have outstanding significance in numerous biological appli￾cations owing to their small size and compatibility with viruses, cells, proteins, or 
genes. Nanoparticles are recognized to be very small to move into the body without 
interfering with its normal functions and can penetrate areas inaccessible by other 
medicinal techniques. Cells respond to topography on size scales as tiny as 5 nm, 
which is up to 1000 times smaller than their own size [6].Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanotoxicology 243
Changes in reactivity to morphological structure can literally cause growth or 
death. Nanostructured materials enable the investigation of these important pro￾cesses at the single-cell level [10].
Nanotoxicology has a long history and extensive knowledge of how some com￾pounds affect human health. The main question is what the primary factors directly 
involved in nanomaterial toxicity are [11]. Toxicity is determined by a number of 
factors, including size (small size allows nanomaterials to interact more effectively 
with biological systems), form, composition, charge, coating, aggregation or capacity 
for self-assembly, capacity for conjugation (strong or weak bonds) with other com￾ponents (proteins, lipids, etc.), catalytic properties, or some combination with other 
biological components [9]. Furthermore, toxicity is highly influenced by the nanoma￾terials’ ability to be biodistributed, hence causing local or systemic problems, their 
rate of clearance and tissue localization, and, most crucially, whether the materials 
utilized are biodegradable or not [12].
12.2. SOME DEFINITIONS
Before going into detail about the contents of this section, it is essential to review 
some of the concepts and definitions of the terms that will be used throughout this 
chapter.
• Nanotechnology: Nanotechnology is the design and fabrication of sub￾stances at the level of molecules and atoms. The National Nanotechnology 
Initiative’s strongest definition of nanotechnology refers to structures with 
at least one dimension in the 1–100 nm size range. Despite this limitation, 
nanotechnology is often used to describe structures that are several hundred 
nanometers in size and are created through either bottom-up or top-down 
engineering of individual components. Research works focused on the use 
of nanotechnology in drug delivery and in the identification of multifarious 
areas of opportunity where present and emerging nanotechnologies could 
enable totally new classes of therapies [13].
• Nanotoxicology: Nanotoxicology is a discipline of bionanoscience that 
studies and applies the toxicity of nanomaterials. Nanotoxicology is the 
study of the toxicity of nanomaterials. Due to quantum size effects and a 
high surface-area-to-volume ratio, nanoparticles have distinct features when 
compared to their larger counterparts. Increased nanotechnological appli￾cations for industrial, consumer, and medical applications offer numerous 
benefits, but they have also raised major concerns about potential health and 
environmental dangers from exposure to manufactured nanoscale materials 
[14]. Such worries encouraged study in the burgeoning subject of nanotecht￾nology, resulting in a rising number of articles claiming that created nano￾materials can elicit major toxic effects due to their unique physicochemical 
features. Despite the fact that most nanotoxicological investigations were 
conducted under exaggerated exposure settings, they have led to a common 
belief that all nanomaterials constitute a considerable health risk.244 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
To establish the real or perceived dangers of nanomaterials following inhalation, 
oral, or dermal routes of exposure, knowledge on potential human and environmental 
exposure, as well as dose response toxicity information, will be required [15].
• Magnetic nanoparticles: A nanoparticle or nano-object is a physical object 
with qualities that differ significantly from the comparable bulk material and 
a dimension of at least 1 nm (no more than 100 nm). Magnetic characteris￾tics (and other physical properties) are highly size dependent when dealing 
with nanoparticles. As a result, magnetism scientists are primarily interested 
in particles with dimensions that are compatible with (or less in comparison 
to) the dimensions of magnetic domains in the respective bulk materials 
[16]. Their small nanometric size gives them interesting properties, and they 
are generally composed of a metal core (iron, cobalt, nickel, etc.) coated 
with other molecules [17]. Magnetic nanoparticles are being investigated as 
physical and efficient constituents for a wide range of applications, includ￾ing healthcare and aerospace.
12.3. MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES ASSETS AND USES
Given the extensive spectrum of biomedical-related prospective uses of magnetic 
nanoparticles (MNs), significant advances in production and application have been 
made and published in recent years [18,19]. Magnetic nanoparticles are useful in a 
wide range of medicinal applications, from localized tumor heating to targeted med￾icine delivery to sick locations. MNs are also mainly used crucial domains such as:
• Active drug transport;
• Magnetic resonance imagery scan;
• High-density magnetic storage devices;
• Catalyst inorganic dye elimination and water splitting reactions;
• Polymeric solar cells;
• Cell and gene healing;
• Solar cell power transform;
• Magnetic separation or contaminants sensing in numerous aqueous systems;
• Biomedical uses and sensors.
With their high surface area, size-dependent superparamagnetic characteristics, pre￾cise tunability, and ease of surface modification, MNs are widely used in a variety of 
biomedical applications over the last two decades [20]. The aforementioned MNs can 
be designed and manipulated in conjunction with other nanoparticles and functional 
chemicals to create multimodal systems that can be used in theragnosis [21]. Superior 
biocompatibility, high loading effectiveness, regulated drug release, and in vivo sta￾bility are actually required for the successful incorporation of these nanoparticles in 
physiological systems [20,21].
It has been widely reported that MNs with nanoscale size, suitable for a variety of 
biomedical uses, present perfect qualities, which include structural, magnetic, crys￾talline, and catalytic properties, that are determined by the synthesis techniques [21]. Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanotoxicology 245
Recently, magnetic nanoflowers (MNFs) are described as a novel system in terms of 
morphology, with a structure similar to a flower and higher stability and enhanced 
heating efficiency when compared to similar nanoparticles with standard formats. 
Such properties allow them to be used in magneto-hyperthermia applications [22]. 
Furthermore, the magnetic hyperthermia features of MNFs, as well as new findings, 
have been critically examined, as their future prospects in biomedicine due to their 
complex structure, which allows for a wide variety of magnetic dynamics.
On the other hand, a novel mesoporous nanomagnetic copper ferrite/drumstick 
composite CuFe O / DC , ( ) 2 4 with a BET surface area of 16.96 m2
/g and a crystallite 
size of 17.91 nm, was synthesized and has shown good adsorption potential for both 
Pb (II) and malachite green [23]. Hence it was concluded that Pb (II) and mala￾chite green adsorption on CuFe2O4/DC has been accomplished via electrostatic and 
coordination interactions. It also was endothermic and accorded with the Langmuir 
equilibrium isotherm model [23].
Tolga Gul and coworkers [24] have recently performed satisfying use of coen￾zymes-based nanoflowers, incorporated magnetic carbon nanotubes, as nanocata￾lyst for cationic and anionic dyes removal (Figure 12.1). The HRP-Lac NF@mCNT 
nanocomposite material (NC), combining horseradish peroxidase-laccase nanoflower 
(HRP-Lac NF) and tiny particles of iron oxide (Fe3O4 NPs) patterned as a magnetic 
carbon nanotube (mCNT), was rigorously used in dye degradation as a function of 
pH. In fact, the authors found that the maximum decolorization of malachite green 
was 99% at pH 7.4, while the maximum decolorization of acid orange 7 was 100% at 
pH 7.4. Even after 16 successive reuses, they confirmed the decolorization achieve￾ment at 95% for malachite green and 85% for acid orange 7. This occurred via two 
mechanisms: enzymatic degradation and physical adsorption.
Bender et al. [25] investigated thoroughly the interrelationships among structure, 
magnetic characteristics, relaxation dynamics, and magnetic hyperthermia perfor￾mance of 39 nm MNFs made up of tightly packed iron oxide cores. These MNFs 
exhibited remanent magnetization, which the authors explained by the exchange con￾nection between the cores, but they also have observed signs of internal spin disorder.
On another front, due to their high stability, ease of fabrication, and improved 
catalytic activity, organic-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers have received a lot of atten￾tion in recent years as support material for enzyme immobilization [26]. Based on 
their ease of separation, structural stability, and potential to improve catalytic effi￾ciency, MNFs have become known as an attractive potential enzyme immobilization 
FIGURE 12.1 Application of HRP-Lac NF@mCNT NC in dye decolorization (Ref. [24]).246 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
framework to address this issue. However, in some specific cases, due to their low 
density and great dispersion, handling, and separating, usage of some specific hybrid 
nanoflowers for enzyme immobilization presents a significant problem [26].
Patil et al. [26] reviewed several ways to create MNFs, as well as potential future 
research areas. They also showed how enzymes could be immobilized by the use of 
MNFs and how they equally could be used in environmental cleanup, biosensors, 
and the food industry. In fact, the possible enhancements to the material in order 
to improve its catalytic performances, reliability of structure, and adaptability have 
been largely considered and analyzed.
The field of biosensing has also benefited from the specific features of nanocom￾ponents. In fact, Campanille et al. [27] described a magneto-elastic (ME) biosen￾sor for cordless tracking of the chemicals in liquid. The ME biosensor underwent 
testing versus human immunoglobulin-G (Ig-G) in the range of 0–20 μg/ml. The 
sensitive components, antihuman Ig-G generated in goat, have been immobilized 
on the outermost layer of the sensor’s employing a newly developed photochemi￾cal immobilization technique (PIT), while a new amplification procedure based on 
gold-covered magnetized nanoparticles (core-shell nanoparticles) was shown to con￾siderably improve sensitivity. The gold nanoflowers generated on the center of the 
magnet allowed the antihuman immunoglobulin-G to be connected to the nanopar￾ticles in order to leverage the sandwich detection approach. The experimental results 
showed that the 6 mm × × 1 mm 30 mµ ME biosensor with an amplification process 
based on magnetic nanoparticles has a detection limit of less than 1 nM, operates 
well in water; and has a reaction time of a few minutes. As a result, the ME biosensor 
is particularly prospective for instantaneous wireless recognition of infectious agents 
in analyzed solutions and for everyday medical testing.
12.4. MULTIFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC 
NANOPARTICLES SYNTHESIS
In this part will be presented some potentially helpful design processes of multi￾functional magnetic nanoparticles for biomedicine, which attracted increased 
research interest due to their easily accessible multimodality. In general, there are 
two approaches to creating magnetic nanoparticle-based multifunctional nanostruc￾tures (Figure  12.2) [5]. Molecular functionalization is the preliminary approach. 
Biofunctional molecules (such antibodies, biological receptors, or ligands) coat the 
magnetic nanoparticles and cause them to engage with a biological entity with high 
affinity, resulting in a controllable method of “tagging.”
To reach these multifunctional nanoparticles synthesis, multifarious technics are 
used, such us:
• Chemical vapor deposition method
• Microwave-assisted method
• Co-precipitation method
• Microemulsion method
• Solvothermal/hydrothermal method
• Thermal decomposition methodMultifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanotoxicology 247
FIGURE 12.2 Scheme depicting two methods for creating MNs and their possible usages 
(Ref. [5]).
FIGURE 12.3 Transmission electron image of flower-like nanoparticles (Ref. [28]).
Biofunctional MNs with molecular functionalization present exceptional selectiv￾ity and sensitivity for numerous biological applications. The second method is to 
sequentially grow or cover magnetic nanoparticles and other functional structures, 
resulting in a single entity with numerous functions at the nanoscale.
In previous work, Honougeq et  al. [28] created unique nanostructures that 
are larger than superparamagnetic sizes for very effective magnetic hyperther￾mia. When synthesized in a mixture of DEG (diethylene glycol 99%) /NMEDA 
(N-methyldiethanolamine 99%), the alkaline hydrolysis of iron (II) and iron (III) 
chlorides produced nanoparticles with a flowerlike structure.
The flowerlike structure of the nanoparticles (Figure  12.3) is the result of an 
assemblage of maghemite nanocrystals with a size of roughly 11 nm regardless of 
the experimental settings. The production process allows for the modification of the 
nanoflowers’ size, polycrystalline character, and magnetic characteristics, resulting 248 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
in a significant increase in their heating capacity (high specific loss power values) 
when compared to previous approaches while employing just harmless iron oxide.
Furthermore, functional magnetic nanoparticles consist of a magnet core with 
an appropriate protective coating or surface functionality. For the synthesis of the 
magnetic core of the necessary nanoparticle, diverse mono- and multistep synthetic 
processes were proposed (Figure 12.4) [21].
Ijaz Dar and coworkers were successful in creating a homogeneous hybrid 
 nanoflower-shaped structure using Au@Mn O3 4 magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles. 
The nanoflowers’ synthesizing method is compatible with heteroepitaxial growing 
process that generates Mn3O4 nanopetals on the Au-core surface [29]. The generated 
hybrid nanoflowers have a considerable photothermal heating impact with a heating 
propagation efficacy of 38%, which is close to Au (gold) nanorods and nanoparticles. 
The combined junction exhibits potential magnetic and optical properties, and the 
prepared Au@Mn O3 4 nanoflowers exhibit strong near-infrared absorption to pro￾duce excellent photothermal efficacy and also a significant T1-weighted magnetic 
resonance improvement of images in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the nanoflowers 
exhibited little toxicity toward key organs.
Hence, magnetic hyperthermia is quickly becoming a valuable adjunct therapy 
for cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy [30,31]. As a result, the 
applicability of several types of nanoflowers such as magnetic-oxide, magneto-plas￾monic, and magnetic-organic/inorganic nanoflowers has been widely examined [32]. 
Furthermore, the most popular chemical pathways for designing nanoflowers have 
been extensively addressed and emphasized with a focus on specific approaches and 
new views on the utilization of emerging magnetic nanoparticles [33].
FIGURE 12.4 Magnetic nanoparticles commonly used synthesis methods (Ref. [21]).Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanotoxicology 249
Maghemite (γ − Fe2O3) nanoflowers with various morphologies have been synthe￾sized by Gavilán and coworkers using a polyol-assisted process [34]. In fact, mor￾phologies with multicore, single-core, together with nanoflowers and hollow spheres 
could be obtained. For this purpose, sodium acetate has been used to control the 
assemblage progression after the nucleation, leading to diverse particle structures. 
Besides, nanoflowers formation mechanism has been elucidated. Starting from a 
lepidocrocite (γ − FeOOH) structure, the initial reactants undergo rapid dehydroxyl￾ation to an intermediate phase, which evolves to maghemite nanoflowers after some 
incubation time. After the nanoflowers are created, a crystallization process occurs 
in which the (γ − FeOOH) crystalline particles size grows (approximately 11–23 nm) 
inside the nanoflowers, while the flower particle remains basically fixed (approxi￾mately 60 nm) (Figure 12.5). Also, different morphologies of samples were coated 
with citric acid, and their heating capacity in an alternating magnetic field was mea￾sured. It has been found that nanoflowers with large cores densely packed (23 nm and 
tuned by low NaAc concentration) have five times the heating capacity of nanoflow￾ers with smaller core sizes (15 nm), four times the heating capacity of hollow spheres, 
and 1.5 times the heating capacity of single-core nanoparticles.
In a recent research work, Mahsa et al. [35], using a mussel-inspired technique, 
prepared a unique mussel-inspired magnetic nanoflower tested as an efficient nano￾zyme and antibacterial agent for organic dyes biosensing and catalytic reduction. 
Magnetic polydopamine (PDA)-Cu nanoflowers (NFs) have been produced by 
integrating magnetic Fe3 4 O @SiO N2 2 H core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) into mus￾sel-inspired PDA and copper phosphate, respectively, as the organic and inorganic 
components (Figure 12.6). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were used 
to analyze the flower-like shape of MNPs PDA-Cu NFs. The crystalline structure of 
MNPs and copper phosphate was confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD).
Hence comparative results on two distinct amounts of the copper sulfate precursor 
demonstrated that increasing the concentration of copper sulfate leads to increased 
size, surface availability, and morphological changes in nanoflowers. The presence 
of MNPs in the PDA-Cu NFs structure resulted in excellent magnetic field separation 
performances.
Finally, PDA and copper nanoparticles in MNPs PDA-Cu NFs have demonstrated 
antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria. 
Furthermore, MNPs PDACu-NFs exhibited stronger antimicrobial properties than 
PDA-Cu NFs, due to their magnetic nanoparticles positive charge.

12.5. MULTIFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES 
AND NANOTOXICOLOGY
Nanotoxicology is a subfield of toxicology that is concerned with studying the det￾rimental consequences of exposure to both natural and artificial nanomaterials on 
biological systems, including effects on human beings, animals, and the surround￾ing environment [36]. It is also occasionally considered a subset of “nanoscience.” 
According to other scientific investigations, the “nanoparticles” toxicity by inhala￾tion was then called nanotoxicology [37]. In fact, the advent of nanotechnology has 
had a significant impact on daily life. Nanomaterials (NMs) are used to make a vari￾ety of items, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and food.
Although nanotechnology has provided many potential benefits, there is still sub￾stantial ambiguity concerning the dangers of NMs to humans. As a result, it is criti￾cal to ensure users’ safety [38].
With increasing investments in nanoscience around the world, there will be a 
surge in consumer items that rely on nanotechnology, as well as an increased demand 
for nanotoxicology assessment of potential detrimental consequences [39].
12.5.1. Nanomaterials Toxicity
The need for precise and impartial data about nanomaterials toxicity prompted the 
quick development of a new science, nanotoxicology, dedicated to expanding under￾standing of phenomena occurring at the interface of nanomaterials biological systems.
Despite the various economical and therapeutic uses, specific toxicities are 
linked with nanoparticles and other tiny materials, and fundamental information is 
essential to face these adverse effects correctly. During numerous human activities, 
nanoparticles infiltrate nature via water, air, and soil. Also, the use of nanoparticles 
for ecosystem treatment purposely injects or dumps manufactured nanoparticles into 
aquatic ecosystems. Investigations have also shown that nanoparticles may reach 
FIGURE 12.6 Magnetic nanoparticles PDA-Cu NFs mussel-inspired mechanism of 
formation (Ref. [35]).Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanotoxicology 251
cells through breathing or swallowing and may migrate inside the body to different 
parts where toxicological effects could be exerted [40].
Effectively, white blood cells (macrophages) in the lung do not remove nanoparti￾cles well. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) studies reveal induced short-term inflammation 
and unexpected lung fibrosis or growths; however, iron pollutants cause considerably 
larger inflammation diseases.
In medicine, theranostics, a rapidly expanding field, has the potential to perform 
diagnosis and treatment at the same time by recognizing tumor particles. In fact, 
magnetic multifunctional nanoparticles, wrapped with a polymer and canalized on 
the site of interest by an outer magnetic field, make this conceivable. They can be 
employed as agents in nuclear magnetic resonance to increase picture contrast and 
allow for better tumor detection. The regulated and focused release of medicines is 
another excellent therapeutic application. Furthermore, Paolo [39] reported the fact 
that an appropriate polymeric layer enabled the addition of chemotherapic products 
to the particle, which can then be released over time. Iron oxides, such as Fe3O4
magnetite and (γ − Fe2O3) maghemite, and gold are the most commonly employed 
materials in the synthesis of nanoparticles for medical use.
Despite their potential benefits, many medications do have certain negative 
effects. While many researchers have looked into the impacts of NMs in vivo and in 
vitro, Lim et al. focused on their epigenetic consequences in the biological system 
[38]. They reported that nanomaterials incorporating dioxide of silicon (SiO2), diox￾ide of titanium ( ) TiO , 2 silver (Ag), and the oxide of zinc (ZnO) are among the most 
frequently utilized for alimentary purposes.
Moreover, heavy-metal-based nanoparticles such as lead, mercury, and tin have 
been observed to be so stiff and stable that decomposition is difficult, which can lead 
to a variety of environmental toxicities [40]. It is well hoped that the use of novel 
approaches would lessen toxicity in the human body.
12.5.2. PreveNtiNg NaNotoxicity
Understanding structure-activity features that may allow in silico prediction of nano￾material toxicologic traits so that they can be avoided by design is one of the current 
concerns in nanotoxicology. To reduce the cost and time required to evaluate the 
toxicity of the growing number of nanomaterials that need to be characterized and 
selected for hazard potential during the discovery and development stages, inno￾vative combinations of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo tests are being developed. An 
important contemporary challenge in nanotoxicology is the development of novel in 
vitro and in vivo toxicologic study techniques that allow for the successful evaluation 
of nanomaterial toxicity utilizing very small volumes of test material [37].
In fact, photothermal therapeutic treatment (PTT) has become recognized as a 
viable cancer cure processing technique. Nevertheless, the nanoparticles (NPs) uti￾lized in PTT may be biopersistent and possibly harmful. Saeed et al. [41] explored 
the potentially beneficial usage of ( ) Fe3 4 O nanoflowers as not toxic, effective pho￾tothermal, and powerful molecules for imagery-guided photothermal treatment of 
cancer. Hence, easy solvothermal approach has been used to create polyethylene 
glycol-coated ( ) Fe3 4 O nanoflowers with controlled dimensions. The photothermal 252 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
treatment efficiency of the Fe-NFs has been found to be superior to that of ( ) Fe3 4 O
nanoparticles. Furthermore, the Fe-NFs have outstanding magnetic characteristics 
and the capacity to evaluate therapy performance using radiation therapy.
The nano risks should be assessed in accordance with the logical framework 
shown in Figure 12.7.
The main six steps are as follows:
Step 1: Describe materials and applications: This is a basic explanation to 
set the stage for a more in-depth examination of the materials’ qualities, 
risks, and exposure throughout its existence. Users should be able to fill 
in the blanks with information currently available in-house or in scientific 
literature.
Step 2: Profile life cycles: The user considers the nanomaterial’s whole life 
cycle to create profiles to the material’s essential qualities, risks, and expo￾sures, as well as how those characteristics may change over time. The 
characteristics profile describes the physical and chemical properties of a 
nanomaterial. The hazard profile describes the possible safety, health, and 
environmental hazards of the nanomaterial. Furthermore, the exposure 
profile describes the potential for human or environmental exposure to the 
nanomaterial, including exposure through both planned usage and inadver￾tent release.
Step 3: Evaluate risks: All the information obtained in the profiles is analyzed 
in this stage in order to identify and characterize the nature, magnitude, and 
probability of dangers provided by a specific nanomaterial and its expected 
application. The user evaluates gaps in the life cycle profiles and decides 
how to remedy them, either by generating data or by substituting “reason￾able worst case” assumptions or values for data.
Step 4: Assess risk management: In this step, the user examines the available 
options for risk management described in step 3 and proposes a plan of 
action. Engineering controls, protective equipment, risk communication, 
product or process adjustments, and, in rare situations, stopping the devel￾opment of the material or application are all options.
Step 5: Decide, document, and act: A  cross-functional review panel ana￾lyzes the risk evaluation and risk management suggestions in this step and 
chooses whether or not to continue development and production. The user 
notes those decisions and their reasoning and distributes important infor￾mation with the appropriate parties. The user may also decide that further 
information is required and take action to obtain it.
Step 6: Review and adapt ongoing management: This is an iterative process 
of regularly planned and event-triggered reviews to update the life cycle 
profiles and risk evaluation, check that risk management systems are func￾tioning properly, and modify those systems in the face of new information 
or new conditions.Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanotoxicology 253
12.6. CONCLUSION
In this review, a comprehensive overview of the fundamental aspects, properties, 
synthesis, and structural elucidation of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles, 
especially in nanotoxicology, has been provided.
The purity, dispersity, and stability of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles in 
a physiological environment are critical for in vivo biomedical applications. As a 
result, more research and exploration of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles is 
required to achieve successful nanotechnologies for biomedical usages.
In conclusion, although multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles have many fas￾cinating potential medicinal applications, significant hurdles and issues remain 
to be undertaken. For example, nanomaterial heterogeneity remains a key issue, 
and it is difficult to accurately manage the quantity of functional molecules on 
the nanoparticles’ surface. Researchers must innovate more effective methods 
for creating nanoparticles with exact composition, homogeneous alteration of the 
surface, and repeatable modification. More importantly, environmental aspects 
should be taken into account before using these materials for any applications, 
especially in the case of heavy metals, which are prone to environmental haz￾ards and can also affect the livings as well. Furthermore, though nanoparticles 
are beneficial for a variety of application, significant health risks are associated 
with their uncontrolled usage and discharge into the natural environment, which 
should be considered in order to make NPs use more convenient and environmen￾tally acceptable.

13.1. INTRODUCTION
Electrochemical sensors find wide application in the environmental and biomedical 
fields, as well as in the food, oil, and agricultural sectors, as they provide a low-cost 
solution for detection. Electrochemical sensors have become a more appealing alter￾native for pharmaceutical applications in recent years due to their capacity to analyze 
analytes of interest quickly, selectively, and sensitively. Devices that use the proper 
transducers to transform changes in electrochemical events into electrical signals are 
known as electrochemical sensors. A small layer of electrolyte separates the work￾ing electrode and reference electrode in most electrochemical sensors (Figure 13.1). 
Analytical data may be obtained from the electrochemical sensor by the electrical 
signal produced by the interaction of the target analyte with the detection layer. 
Electrochemical sensors work by producing an electrical signal proportional to the 
concentration of the analyte species and by redox reactions at the top of the electrode. 
To determine the existence or concentration of the desired analytical substance, they 
employ the electrical signal produced by the detection layer’s associations. Different 
classification systems (e.g., conductometric, potentiometric, impedimetric, ampero￾metric, and voltametric sensors) are used to group these devices. However, ampero￾metric sensors are used to identify electroactive species with biological or chemical 
identification. These sensors can be used for drug quality assessment, drug pharma￾cokinetic property evaluation (i.e., distribution and release of the drug in the body), 
and detection of drug contamination. The kind of material used to create the sensing 
platform is efficient in producing an electrochemical sensor that is both good and 
dependable. As a result, nanomaterials offer numerous benefits for sensor technolo￾gies in the electrochemical platform development process. Compared to other types 
of sensors, nano-based sensors are superior in many aspects, such as selectivity, 258 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
high sensitivity, and small size. Nanoparticles have a huge surface area and unique 
electrical properties that can improve sensors’ sensitivity and selectivity and overall 
analytical performance. Furthermore, the surface features of nanoparticles can be 
functionalized with specific binding groups or receptors, further increasing selectiv￾ity to enable detection of specific analytes. The electrochemical sensor’s reactivity 
and surface/volume ratio are significantly raised by adding nanoparticles to the sens￾ing surface. This feature makes it possible to detect the monitored analyte amount 
even at lower concentrations.
In recent years, magnetic nanoparticle-(MNP-) based sensors are preferred as 
ideal components due to their easy integration into electrochemical sensors and inno￾vative pharmaceutical applications. MNPs find application in magnetic separation, 
in vivo imaging, drug and gene delivery, diagnostics, and other fields. It provides 
numerous opportunities across various fields. The basic elements of magnetism are 
the orbital and spin movements of electrons and their interactions with one another. 
Metals, oxides, and their alloys are the three categories for magnetic particles. The 
interaction between the magnetic moments of the particles and an external magnetic 
field is often the basis for the mechanism of action of MNPs. With this interaction, 
the ability to easily manipulate the changes in the position and movement of the 
material provides the opportunity for use in many areas. Furthermore, the fact that 
chemical variables like temperature, pH, concentration, or surface charges have no 
effect on magnetic interactions makes MNPs an excellent choice for electrochemical 
sensors. As a result, the role and importance of MNPs in electrochemical sensors 
enable them to increase the sensitivity, selectivity and stability and to improve analy￾sis processes. Adapting the surface modifications of nanoparticles allows for specific 
designs for a variety of uses.
This book chapter focuses on topics related to multifunctional MNPs in elec￾trochemical sensors for pharmaceutical products. Multifunctional MNPs electro￾chemical sensors make it possible to obtain sensitive and reliable results in studies 
such as drug quality control, active substance determination, and evaluation of phar￾macokinetic properties. Within the scope of this topic, synthesis, characterization, 
and integration studies of multifunctional MNPs used in electrochemical sensors 
FIGURE 13.1 (a) Electrochemical sensor example. (b) Working diagram (Rocha-Santos, 
2014; figure created in BioRender.com).Electrochemical Sensors for Pharmaceuticals 259
are discussed. This section discusses how electrochemical sensor technology can 
be combined with innovative materials such as MNPs in the pharmaceutical field, 
and the current challenges, future opportunities, and advantages of this combination.
13.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF NANOPARTICLES IN 
ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSING FOR PHARMACEUTICALS
Techniques for pharmaceutical applications, such as drug recognition, detection, and 
analysis, are covered in pharmaceutical sensing. In this discipline, the application of 
different nanomaterials—particularly nanoparticles—is growing. Because of their 
small dimensions and large surface-area-to-volume ratio, nanoparticles are useful 
in a variety of applications (Aylaz et al., 2021). Pharmaceutical sensing uses a wide 
range of nanoparticle kinds that are made for different applications. Table 13.1 lists 
a few popular varieties of nanoparticles along with some of their uses (George et al., 
2023; Mollarasouli et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021a).

nanoparticles, their specific properties, using areas, sensitivity, biocompatibility, and 
biodegradability affect pharmaceutical studies (Saleh, 2020).
Nanoparticles preferred in pharmaceutical analysis have several specific proper￾ties that are desired. The first of these features is that they allow charge and energy 
changes/transfers that can be integrated into sensor systems in terms of optical and 
electrochemical properties. In addition, it is very important that the surface chem￾istry of these particles is suitable for various modifications and coatings (Aylaz & 
Andaç, 2022; Sajid & Płotka-Wasylka, 2020). For example, the gold nanoparticles 
may be included in an optical detection system with their surface plasmon reso￾nance properties. At the same time, the chemical attraction of gold nanoparticles to 
many biological molecules is a factor that increases the effectiveness of these sen￾sors. Thanks to higher surface area, there are more areas to adsorb/capture analyte 
molecules. Since this is a factor that increases sensor efficiency, nanoparticles are 
frequently used in sensor systems (Ielo et al., 2021; Kopac, 2021).
Another feature that nanoparticles must have in pharmaceutical research is that 
they must have high stability. Synthesizing nanoparticles that can remain stable for a 
long time in different environmental conditions without agglomeration or degradation 
is desired for many studies because, with constant stability, nanoparticles are included 
in sensor applications that provide more sensitive and accurate results. Biocompatible 
synthesis of nanoparticles or making them biocompatible with various modifications 
increases the use of nanoparticles, especially in sensors that sense drug research and 
other biological events. The biocompatibility of nanoparticles is important in biomed￾ical applications (Akbarzadeh et al., 2012; D. Sharma & Hussain, 2020). In particular, 
nanoparticles used in intracellular and extracellular detection and monitoring appli￾cations must be nontoxic and have minimal interactions with biological systems. The 
surfaces of the nanoparticles should be easily functionalizable for immobilization of 
various biological recognition elements (e.g., antibodies, aptamers) or sensing sensors. 
This enables specific tuning of nanoparticles to detect specific analytes. Finally, the 
ease of production and scalability of nanoparticles are preferred. Large-scale produc￾tion is important for industrial applications and enables nanoparticles to be obtained 
cost-effectively (Joudeh & Linke, 2022; Sajid & Płotka-Wasylka, 2020).
13.2.2.  Fundamentals of Electrochemical Sensing Developed
for Use in Pharmaceutical Applications
Nanoparticle-based electrochemical sensors are preferred for drug detection, 
research, development, optimization, and commercialization in pharmaceutical 
applications. In the pharmaceutical field, sensitive, high-accuracy, short response 
time, low detection limit, easy-to-use, and low-cost analyses are performed with elec￾trochemical sensors. By integrating nanoparticles into these electrochemical sensors, 
various advantages are achieved compared to macro dimensions (Lakshmanakumar 
et al., 2021; Nemčeková & Labuda, 2021). The advantages of nanoparticles enable 
sensing with more sensitivity, high selectivity, and stability, as previously explained.
With the use of electrochemical sensor systems in which nanoparticles are inte￾grated, drug research and development studies and biomedical applications are Electrochemical Sensors for Pharmaceuticals 261
developing at a very high rate. The designed nanoparticle integrated electrochem￾ical sensors are prepared in basically five steps. The first of these is the selection 
of the type and shape of nanoparticles and the determination of the preparation 
method. In this step, nanoparticle selection is made according to the feature 
desired to be imparted to the sensor system during analysis. Particles of different 
types (polymeric, metallic, magnetic, fluorescence, etc.) and of various shapes and 
sizes are selected and synthesized for specific requirements in the sensor system 
(Aylaz et al., 2022; Feroz & Vadgama, 2020; Ge et al., 2020; Trotter et al., 2020). 
The second step is the integration of the synthesized nanoparticles into the sensor. 
With this process, nanoparticles are fixed to the sensor surface with appropriate 
modification methods. This step is very important for sensor performance and 
stable analysis. Therefore, the appropriate method must be carefully selected and 
applied. After the nanoparticles are immobilized on the sensor, it is necessary to 
decide which method will be analyzed. With electrochemical sensors, spectro￾scopic analysis based on single impedance change, voltametric analysis, ampero￾metric analysis, and multianalysis methods, used together, can be applied. After 
the detection method is decided, the analysis part begins. The most important 
points at this stage are to ensure high sensitivity, accuracy, selective and low detec￾tion limit analysis. For this, the sensor must be optimized after the basic exper￾imental conditions are determined. The first goal in optimization should be to 
determine sensor limits such as repeatability, interaction time, and control studies. 
The first aim is to be able to perform more sensitive and high-resolution analyses 
in sensors prepared and used for pharmaceutical purposes compared to existing 
sensor systems (Alsaiari et al., 2021; Eddaif & Shaban, 2022; Kuhn et al., 2020; 
Shanbhag et al., 2023).

MULTIFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES 
FOR PHARMACEUTICAL SENSING
13.3.1. Methods for Preparing Multifunctional Magnetic
Nanoparticles for Pharmaceutical Applications
The importance and considerations in the use of various nanomaterials, especially 
nanoparticles, in pharmaceutical research have been previously mentioned. In recent 
years, interest in MNPs has increased in some sensor studies. Some of the reasons 
for this are that it can be easily adapted to desired systems and can be moved easily 
with the application of a magnetic field (Aylaz et  al., 2021) (Figure  13.2). MNPs 
can be prepared and used in their basic form or as multifunctional. Especially mul￾tifunctional MNPs are frequently preferred in pharmaceutical research. The fact 
that multifunctional MNPs used for pharmaceutical studies are prepared by differ￾ent methods can affect their application areas, the nanoparticles’ dimensions, their 
chemical and physical properties, also their charges (Anjum et al., 2023; Setia et al., 
2023). Table 13.2 summarizes the preparation methods and their advantages of mul￾tifunctional MNPs.262 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

13.4. INTEGRATION OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL MNPS INTO 
ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSORS FOR USE IN 
PHARMACEUTICAL ANALYSES
Integration of multifunctional MNPs into sensors for pharmaceutical drug recog￾nition, monitoring, and research is the most important factor in terms of sensor 
sensitivity and therefore performance. With correct immobilization or integration, 
electrochemical sensors become sensitive, fast, and highly selective; otherwise a 
low-efficiency sensor application will occur (Mollarasouli et al., 2021).
The following strategies make it possible to employ multifunctional MNPs in 
electrochemical sensor systems designed for drug analysis in a cost-effective way. 
These methods’ efficiency and the specificity of sensors contributes to a product that 
is more reliable for pharmaceutical sensing. For this purpose, magnetic nanoparticle 
modification is important to improve the adsorption/desorption of the analyte mol￾ecule to the sensor and the detection of reaction kinetics. MNPs can be modified 
with different bioreceptors, synthetic ligands, or promoter groups. The aim here is 
to reduce the analyte detection limit by increasing the sensitivity of the magnetic 
nanoparticle integrated electrochemical sensor. On the other hand, the most promi￾nent advantage of using MNPs is that they can be easily guided by using magnets. In 
this way, analyte molecules may be easily captured, enriched, or removed from the 
environment. The enrichment process facilitates detection in some trace amounts of 
samples or body fluids. In addition, thanks to the external magnetic field, MNPs can 
be easily moved or removed from the environment within the system or in the batch 
process. We have mentioned that MNPs can be easily functionalized or even multi￾functionalized. This allows electrochemical sensors to detect even small amounts of 
analytes with sensitivity and high accuracy. Analyte adsorption is increased by using 
receptors or ligands with high affinity for the analyte. Therefore, thanks to specific 
and sensitive detection, it reduces matrix-related noise during electrochemical mea￾surement (Baretta et al., 2023; Kumar, 2023; Q. Li et al., 2023; Y. Yang et al., 2020).
A multidisciplinary approach is used in the creation and improvement of multi￾functional magnetic nanoparticle-based sensors for use in pharmaceuticals in order 
to provide a sensitive, fast, and accurate analytical platform for drug detection, track￾ing, and measurement. These studies evaluate the reusability of electrochemical sen￾sors, their sensitive and accurate measurement, and the synthesis and integration 
stages of MNPs that directly affect all of these. The first feature that an electro￾chemical sensor must have to work with the desired sensitivity and performance is 
the preparation of MNPs compatible with the sensor (Kannan & Maduraiveeran, 
2023; Ma et al., 2023). (After this stage is optimized, the functionalization processes 
for integrating nanoparticles into the electrochemical sensor must be successfully 
carried out and characterized. Particles can be various specific ligands, biological 
molecules, receptors, or synthetic recognition materials. In this way, a sensor specific 
to the analyte to be sensed will be prepared. This step increases the sensor perfor￾mance. Designing the sensor platform includes the integration of MNPs, electrode 
configuration, and signal readout system. These components are carefully designed 
to optimize the sensor. The sensor whose design has been completed needs to be 
optimized. With optimization, sensor readouts are carefully evaluated with regard 
to critical parameters such as analyte detection limits, response time, reusability, 264 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
and analytical sensitivity. If necessary, the design and operations are re-optimized 
(Garkani Nejad et al., 2021; Pakapongpan et al., 2022; L. Yang et al., 2022). After 
all sensor preparations are completed, the appropriate environment for analysis must 
be determined. The focus here is on managing the matrix effect. Pharmaceutical 
samples often contain complex matrices. Therefore, the ability of the sensor platform 
to cope with matrix effects is important, and strategies are developed to minimize 
background noise. Finally, the sensor is evaluated in terms of whether the designed 
sensor platform is suitable for practical use, easily applicable in the pharmaceutical 
industry, and sustainable. Therefore, the scaling of the manufacturing process and 
the simplicity of use of the sensor are important (Monsef & Salavati-Niasari, 2022; 
Zhang et al., 2021).
The designs of sensors developed with multifunctional MNPs in pharmaceuti￾cal applications present a few challenges. The ability of the sensor to distinguish 
a particular analyte from other components is important. Additionally, the analyte 
must be detectable at trace amounts (Mollarasouli et al., 2021). However, from time 
to time, the expected sensitivity may be impaired by factors such as environmen￾tal conditions, analyte media, and the necessity of working with complex samples. 
Another difficulty is the complexity of the sample matrix. These matrix components 
can affect the performance of the sensor and increase background noise. This is 
an undesirable situation in sensor studies (Ullah Khan et al., 2021). Prepurification/
enrichment studies are carried out to prevent this. Another challenge is stability and 
reproducible measurement. It is important that the designed sensors are stable and 
can produce repeatable results. It is also important that the production process is 
reproducible and applicable on a large scale. Beyond all these difficulties, the sen￾sor must be easy to use and low cost. It is important for sensors to be used in the 
pharmaceutical industry to be user-friendly and cost-effective for easy accessibility 
(Chouhan et al., 2021; Materón et al., 2021; Tran et al., 2022).
13.5. PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT AND 
MECHANISMS IN PHARMACEUTICAL SENSING
In the last few years, attention has increased toward analytical techniques for exam￾ining the quality of food, medications, and environmental compounds as well as for 
keeping an eye on the existence of pertinent compounds in items used in everyday 
life. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is making rapid progress to meet the 
demands of an increasingly populous world. If these developments in pharmaceutical 
production are not controlled, it is inevitable that new biological and environmental 
problems will arise (Karimi-Maleh et al., 2020).
The development of drug analysis methods is one of the most significant stages 
in the invention of novel medications and quality control procedures. Only when 
the pharmaceuticals are labeled, pure, and taken in the right dosage will they fulfill 
their intended purpose. Monitoring patient overdose and keeping an eye out for phar￾maceutical contaminants in wastewater and environmental water resources become 
crucial, in addition to quality control measures for pharmaceutical production and 
distribution (Qian et al., 2021b). Therefore, it is imperative to have an analytical tool 
that is precise, focused, inexpensive, and quick. These pharmaceuticals may acquire Electrochemical Sensors for Pharmaceuticals 265
contaminants during different phases of production, shipping, and storage, making 
them dangerous to administer; as a result, they need to be identified and measured. 
When it comes to the analysis of pharmaceutical substances, many analytical tech￾niques are available for evaluating the quality control of the final dosage form in 
drug research. Titrimetric, chromatographic, spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and 
electrochemical techniques, along with their corresponding methods, have gener￾ally been employed in pharmaceutical analysis. Numerous analytical tools that can 
be employed in quality control units were covered in the literature. Methods like 
electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL), chemometric techniques, high-pressure 
liquid chromatography (HPLC), and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry 
(LC–MS) are frequently used in pharmaceutical analysis quality control protocols 
(Rocha-Santos, 2014). The most popular method for detecting pharmaceuticals is 
HPLC, which enables the components dissolved in the liquid phase to be passed over 
a stationary phase and separated. UV-Vis spectrophotometers are commonly used 
as detectors because they offer sensitive and focused detection. Information regard￾ing the density and concentration of pharmaceutical substances can be gathered by 
utilizing their ability to absorb light at specific wavelengths. These methods have 
certain limitations, including cost, the requirement for personnel skills, and labor-in￾tensive procedure protocols, despite their sensitivity and selectivity. Pharmaceutical 
analysts are therefore trying to find other methods that have the advantages of the 
previously mentioned methods without the drawbacks.
The advantages of electrochemical methods over other analytical techniques, 
including their inexpensiveness, user friendliness, good performance, easy handling, 
and real-time monitoring, have been demonstrated. Consequently, there has been a 
lot of interest in sensor progress. The improvement of sensor technologies has been 
significantly impacted by the usage of nanomaterials. Nanomaterial-based electro￾chemical sensors and biosensors are being developed to investigate the identification 
and analysis of anti-inflammatory properties, depression medication, antimicrobial, 
antiviral, and anti-allergic classes of medicinal component groups. The synthesis of 
nanomaterials with flexible forms, sizes, chemical charges, and physical and chemi￾cal properties has advanced significantly (Omer et al., 2022). Constant development 
is going on for new electrochemical sensors to improve their sensitivity and stability 
and to lower detection limits. With the introduction of nanomaterials with controlla￾ble morphologies, sizes, surface charges, and physicochemical properties, the devel￾opment of electrochemical sensors has advanced dramatically. Numerous significant 
drug classes, including anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antibacterial, antifungal, 
antiviral, and anticancer medications, have been identified by electrochemical sen￾sors. Depending on the drug structure, these sensors need particular sensor inter￾faces in order to reach their full detection potential.
13.6. APPLICATIONS OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL MNPS IN 
ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSORS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS
The branch of science that studies the transformation of chemical energy into phys￾ical energy resulting from the interaction between matter and electrical energy is 
known as electrochemistry. The case in which electron transfer occurs is called 266 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
electrochemical reactions. Electrochemical measurements are often specific for 
a particular oxidation state of an element, molecule, or reaction product. For this 
reason, electroanalytical methods have superior properties because they are more 
selective and relatively cheaper than other analysis methods. Sensors are known as 
systems that detect differences in the environment and transmit these differences 
and information to other electronic devices. One of the most important components 
of a sensor is the transducer. The sensor first creates a measurable signal for the 
thermal, mechanical, magnetic, radiation, electrical, and chemical changes in the 
environment through the transducer, then processes this signal, and turns it into a 
meaningful output. There are many types of sensors depending on their structure 
and usage area.
Electrochemical sensors are devices that respond selectively and reversibly to 
ions or compounds. According to their working principles, electrochemical sensors 
have four main types: amperometric (current measurement), voltametric (current and 
potential), potentiometric (voltage measurement), and conductometric (conductivity 
measurement) (Stradiotto et al., 2003). Amperometry refers to measurement at a con￾stant potential. It is based on the measurement of current changes resulting from 
oxidation or reduction of the electroactive material. Amperometric immunosensors 
are capable of detecting the concentration-dependent current that arises from the 
various reactions of an electroactive species at the electrode surface (Baranwal et al., 
2022). The most widely used kind of electrochemical sensors are amperometric ones. 
The potentiometric sensor is based on the measurement of the potential difference on 
the electrode with the analyte-sensitive organic layer. Voltammetry is the measure￾ment of an electrical current while a controlled variation in the potential is applied. 
Additionally, the electrical conductivity that varies with each reactant present in a 
FIGURE 13.3 MNP-based electrochemical sensing method (Mollarasouli et al., 2021; figure 
created in BioRender.com).Electrochemical Sensors for Pharmaceuticals 267
solution can be measured using conductometric electrochemical sensors. Because 
conductance is the inverse of resistance, some researchers have also referred to these 
systems as conductometric/impedimetric. The total conductivity or resistivity of the 
solution changes when ions or electrons are produced during a chemical reaction. 
Therefore, the working electrode in sensor systems must be selective toward the 
analyte. For this reason, by incorporating nanomaterials into electrochemical sensor 
systems designed with developing nanotechnology, they have become sensitive, selec￾tive, and stable. Nanomaterials show advanced optical, electrical, magnetic, thermal, 
and catalytic properties thanks to their unique properties and dimensional superi￾ority. Thanks to these superior properties, nanomaterials are frequently preferred 
in electrochemical sensor systems. Because of this, electrochemical sensor systems 
created with evolving nanotechnology have become more sensitive, selective, and 
stable through the incorporation of nanomaterials (Evans et al., 2012). A lot of work 
has gone into creating MNPs in recent years due to their many benefits, including 
their size, physicochemical characteristics, and low production costs. MNPs have 
various applications in fields such as enzyme immobilization, diagnostics, drug and 
gene delivery, thanks to the properties changing with the magnet used (Mollarasouli 
et  al., 2021). MNPs can be designed as multifunctional systems to increase their 
adequacy and performance in their intended use. To achieve this, various surface 
coatings can be applied to the particles in order to give them desired and stable bio￾medical properties. Additionally, by preventing the pharmacokinetic effects and tox￾icity of the MNPs resulting from their interactions with biological proteins or cells, 
the biocompatibility of the particles can be increased. Pharmaceutical analysis is 
extremely important in the identification, determination, measurement, purification, 
and quality control of a substance in drug production (L. Li et al., 2020). Target spe￾cies can be selectively captured by multifunctional MNPs, collected using an applied 
magnetic field, and separated from the remainder of the sample.
13.7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The use of MNPs in pharmaceutical applications reveals some important findings 
based on basic diagnosis and treatments. The first of these is to ensure high selec￾tivity and sensitivity sensing. MNPs are frequently preferred in drug detection and 
transportation applications. MNPs’ easy modification, unique physical structure, 
very small size, and ability to be prepared in desired sizes enable easy and sensi￾tive detection of the target analyte. In sensor systems where MNPs are used, sep￾aration processes are carried out with external magnetic fields. This contributes to 
rapid results. In addition, reliable detection is achieved thanks to MNPs modified 
with receptors specific to the target molecule. Again, thanks to specific modification 
steps, the target molecule is captured quickly and selectively, and the analysis is 
completed in a short time. As previously mentioned, MNPs, via the special receptors, 
may adsorb the desired molecule precisely and easily even in complex matrices, and 
analysis can be easily performed. In fact, the strategies that can be used to overcome 
the limitations of multifunctional MNPs in pharmaceutical sensing and to expand 
their applications are generally similar to the strategies that first come to mind when 268 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
developing nanomaterials used for similar purposes. Some of the most crucial tactics 
among them include surface modifications, biocompatibility and toxicity improve￾ments, sensitivity and selectivity enhancements, diversification of nanoparticle func￾tions, development of hybrid and integrated systems, and so on. High sensitivity, 
targeted detection, rapid analysis, multiple analysis ability, reusability, etc. are among 
the most desired features for pharmaceutical sensing. The more of these properties 
it has simultaneously, the more useful a multifunctional nanoparticle is. MNPs may 
also have the ability to separate target molecules from mixed samples with magnets. 
This allows target components in complex matrices to be analyzed more effectively. 
Owing to these characteristics, especially functionalized multifunctional MNPs can 
make great contributions to the development of pharmaceutical analysis methods.
The advancement trends in pharmaceutical sensing using multifunctional MNPs 
also parallel the development of other multifunctional nanomaterials used for bio￾logical purposes. In this regard, various strategies involve multifunctional MNPs to 
meet the major requirements of pharmaceutical sensing, including enhanced sen￾sitivity, multiple biomarker detection, quick and portable diagnostic tools. The key 
ones include the development of novel and more varied target-oriented techniques, 
the combination of various nanotechnological materials and biomaterials, and the 
investigation of ways to get beyond biological barriers.
In conclusion, considering the amount of research done, it is evident that multi￾functional MNPs have a great deal of promise for use in pharmaceutical sensing. The 
ability to prepare the sizes, surface properties, surface charges, and modifications of 
the synthesized MNPs as desired makes the sensor system to be used scalable. This 
provides opportunities such as adapting the prepared sensor system to more than one 
analyte and performing analysis in complex environments. These findings are the 
reasons why the prepared multifunctional MNPs are used in many biological sensor 
applications, especially pharmaceutical applications. The distinguishing features of 
multifunctional MNPs are that they enable effective, high-accuracy, and sensitive 
analysis/identification in drug discovery and development steps (Keshta et al., 2024; 
Paramasivam et al., 2024; Raoof et al., 2023; S. Sharma et al., 2024).

14.1. INTRODUCTION
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), characterized by their versatility, man￾ifest as small bodies or particles with a metallic core containing metals such as iron, 
cobalt, or nickel, enveloped by a multitude of other molecules, thereby creating a com￾plex structure with varied magnetic properties [1]. Magnetism was discovered more than 
2500 years ago with an ore named magnetite Fe3O4 [2], located in western Turkey. The 
compass was the first application of magnetism, developed by the Chinese author named 
Shen Kuo in the year 1086 [3]. Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have 
been around since the turn of the 20th century and have found a lot of use in the new tech￾nologies of this day. More precisely, since their invention in 1973, these multifunctional 
magnetic nanoparticles have been instrumental in transforming the field of magnetic res￾onance imaging (MRI) [4]. In 1989, in France, a pioneering event occurred, marking 
the advent of medical imaging using multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles for the first 
time [5]. Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles, thanks to their versatility, extend across 
various fields of application, primarily in medicine [6–8]. These applications encompass 
aspects such as cutting-edge medical imaging [9,10], the implementation of revolutionary 
targeted therapies [11–14], and the potential for early diagnosis, thereby demonstrating 
their significant potential in advancing modern medical practices [15,16]. In this chapter, 
we conducted a bibliographic review on multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles, exam￾ining their size, shape, specific surface, as well as their optical and magnetic properties. 
Additionally, we have researched the uses of the applications of multifunctional magnetic 
nanoparticles in variety of industries, including healthcare, particularly in the areas of 
targeted therapy, early diagnosis, and medical imaging. We have also studied the phys￾ical, chemical, and biological characteristics of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles.Applications in Biomedicine 273
14.2. PROPERTIES OF NANOPARTICLES
The multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 nm, 
are often divided into three major categories [17]. First, there are ultrafine nanopar￾ticles, measuring less than 100 nm. Next, fine nanoparticles fall within the range of 
100 to 250 nm. Finally, coarse ultrafine nanoparticles are characterized by diameters 
ranging from 250 to 1000 nm [18]. Thanks to the small size of nanoparticles, unique 
optical properties have been observed [19]. Some materials based on nanoparticles 
thus modify their light emission and absorption properties. The nanoparticles oper￾ate in a manner like a classical magnet, albeit on a nanoscale, thereby demonstrat￾ing magnetic properties that are comparable but on an extremely reduced scale [20]. 
Because of their extremely small size, the nanoparticles have special chemical char￾acteristics that are fascinating to scientists. Their surface reactivity, stemming from 
this reduced size, greatly influences their interactions with the environment, thereby 
opening doors to applications in catalysis. This characteristic is crucial in the field 
of colloidal stability, where nanoparticles can maintain a homogeneous dispersion, 
offering exciting opportunities in various industrial sectors [21,22].
14.3. APPLICATIONS IN BIOMEDICINE OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL 
MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES (MNPs)
In the realm of biomedicine, multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are 
essential because they can be used for positron emission tomography, targeted ther￾apy, early diagnosis, and medical imaging, among other uses (PET). In medical 
imaging, these infinitesimally small particles offer enhanced resolution, allowing for 
a more precise visualization of biological structures [23]. Utilizing the unique char￾acteristics advantage of the specific properties of multifunctional magnetic nanopar￾ticles, targeted therapy minimizes unwanted effects by delivering medication straight 
to sick cells. MNPs are employed as contrast agents in the field of early diagnosis 
to identify abnormalities at an early stage of the disease [24]. Lastly, the capacity 
of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles to precisely mark regions of interest is 
advantageous for positron emission tomography, allowing for a thorough imaging of 
biological processes at the molecular level [25]. Thus the broad range of applications 
of multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) opens up important new avenues 
for biomedical advancement. A summary of some of the medical uses for multifunc￾tional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is shown in Figure 13.1. [26].
14.4. PREPARATION METHODS
14.4.1.  Synthesis of Nanoparticles by Chemical Methods
Nanoparticles are prepared through several synthesis methods. Among these meth￾ods, we find the ascending and descending methods. The first ascending method 
(bottom-up) involves fabricating nanoparticles atom by atom or molecule by mol￾ecule, with a controlled combination of atoms or molecules. Meanwhile, items that 274 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

already exist are shrunk to a size that is closer to nanometric diameters using the 
second descending (top-down) approach. Both methods yield nanoparticles, but the 
preferred method for chemist researchers is the ascending method, as it allows for 
controlling the size of nanoparticles during fabrication [27,28]. Figure 13.1 summa￾rizes the principle of two chemical methods: bottom-up and top-down.
Table 14.1 provides a detailed overview of the various methods for the synthesis of 
silver-(Ag-) and gold-(Au-) based nanoparticles, highlighting the specific conditions 
of each process and describing their applications.
14.4.2.  Synthesis of Nanoparticles by Biological Methods
Due to the toxicity and cost of chemicals, researchers prefer green biological meth￾ods for preparing nanoparticles. Several methods of nanoparticle synthesis by bio￾logical means are mentioned in this study.
Among the biological methods for nanoparticle synthesis is the biological reduction 
method; in this approach, plants and algae are utilized [31]. The Biomineralization 
method involves the use of microorganisms [32]. There is also the enzymatic syn￾thesis method, where enzymes serve as catalysts for the reduction of metallic com￾pounds [33]. The plant cell culture method involves the cultivation of plant cells [34]. 
Protein extraction entails using proteins from biological sources [35], and, finally, the 
fungal method involves the use of fungi [36]. Each method facilitates the preparation 
of nanoparticles in an environmentally friendly manner.

14.5. CONCLUSION
The chapter is intended for an audience consisting of scientists and professional 
researchers in the field of nanotechnology and its relationship to biomedicine. We 
review research on multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and their appli￾cations, in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including the detection of diseases 
before their manifestation. In this chapter, we have discussed various synthesis meth￾ods and explored the chemical and biological aspects of these approaches. Researchers 
can use the information provided in this chapter to study the characteristics of multi￾functional magnetic nanoparticles. In addition, deepening the understanding of syn￾thetic methods applied to specific multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), 
whether through chemical or biological processes, can open new perspectives in the 
field of nanotechnology.

15.1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic nanoparticle-based drug delivery is a means in which magnetic particles 
such as iron oxide nanoparticles are a component of a delivery vehicle for magnetic 
drug delivery, due to the simplicity with which the particles can be drawn to mag￾neto-puissant targets. Magnetic nanoparticles can impart imaging and controlled 
release capabilities to drug delivery materials such as micelles, liposomes, and 
polymers.
Single-molecular magnets are a defined as a platform that incorporates insolu￾ble drugs into biocompatible carrier materials, without adding magnetic iron oxide 
nanoparticles that might adversely affect patients susceptible to iron overdose. The 
drawbacks in conventional magnetic drug delivery methods can be overcome by 
switching from typical iron oxide nanoparticles to ones based on molecular magnets 
to utilize their anticancer nanomagnet with proven cancer-fighting ability.
However, insoluble drugs also have some inherent drawbacks, such as poor water 
solubility, loss of magnetic activity in solvents, and potential cytotoxicity when accu￾mulated in tissues and organs.
As an alternative synthetic method of magnetic drug delivery, a non-iron-oxide￾based smart delivery platform has been very recently developed by self-assembly 
of the drugs into nanocargoes encapsulated by a smart polymer, exhibiting biosafe 
multifunctional magnetic capabilities, a magnetic field, pH-responsive heat-releasing 
hyperthermia effects, and controlled release.
Furthermore, the number of new cases of cancer increases every year, making it 
one of the world’s deadliest diseases. The most common type of cancer is carcinoma, 
which can affect the pancreas, breasts, skin, lungs, or other organs [1–3]. During 
the past few years, nanotechnology has been involved in chemotherapy, radiation 
therapy, and targeted therapy for the treatment of various types of cancer [4–6]. 
Nanomaterials are used in modern nanomedicine for developing early diagnostic, 
detection, and treatment methods. Several factors affect the potential biomedical 
applications, including porosity, size, surface functional groups, electronic proper￾ties, zeta potential, and possible interactions [7–11]. Modern nanomedicine requires 280 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
optimizing the design and physiochemical characteristics of nanohybrid nanostruc￾tures before tackling other significant issues. Especially, advances in hybrid magnetic 
nanostructures research have had a groundbreaking impact on biomedical applica￾tions [12–14]. A  great deal of effort has been spent on developing ferromagnetic 
hybrid magnetic nanostructures with controlled parameters [15–18].
15.2. MAGNETIC NANOMATERIALS
The advent and development of nanomedicine offer new avenues to improve con￾ventional cancer therapies. Magnetic nanomaterials and hybrid nanostructures are 
set to hold a lot of interest in the future because of their physicochemical properties, 
adjustable size and shape, and ease of functionalization. In biomedical applications, 
iron oxide nanoparticles, especially maghemite and magnetite oxides—ferrites—are 
commonly used because of their ability to decompose in the body and release oxygen 
and iron [19]. They can be easily excreted from the body after degradation through 
oxygen transport and metabolic systems. Hence understanding the physicochemical 
properties, such as size- and shape-dependent properties, composition, and function￾ality of magnetic nanoparticles is crucial when these materials are used in modern 
cancer diagnosis and therapy. An overview of different types of magnetic nanomate￾rials and surface functionalization strategies is provided in this section.
15.2.1. Polymeric Magnetic Nanostructures
Polymer magnetic nanostructures have emerged as a promising approach for can￾cer treatment due to their unique physicochemical properties. These nanostructures 
are composed of a polymer matrix and magnetic nanoparticles, which can be func￾tionalized with therapeutic agents such as chemotherapy drugs or imaging agents. 
The magnetic nanoparticles can be attracted to a specific location in the body 
using an external magnetic field, allowing for targeted delivery of the therapeutic 
agents to cancerous tumors [20–22]. Several methods can be used to synthesize a 
polymer-magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer treatment. The most common 
approaches are layer-by-layer assembly, self-assembly, and co-precipitation. Polymer 
magnetic nanostructures are particularly useful for improving the therapeutic effi￾cacy of chemotherapy drugs [23]. In many cases, chemotherapy drugs are insolu￾ble in water, making it difficult to deliver them to cancerous tumors in the desired 
concentrations. A  polymer matrix can improve the solubility of chemotherapy 
drugs, leading to higher drug concentrations at the tumor site [24]. Furthermore, the 
polymer matrix can protect chemotherapy drugs from degradation in the body and 
prevent side effects. Polymer-magnetic hybrid nanostructures can also improve the 
targeting of therapeutic agents for cancerous tumors [25]. An external magnetic field 
can be used to attract nanostructures to a specific location in the body by attaching 
magnetic nanoparticles to their surfaces. Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents can 
improve the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment by delivering them to the tumor.
In magnetic polymeric micelles, a polymer core is surrounded by a shell of mag￾netic nanoparticles. Polymeric nanoparticles are small, spherical particles com￾posed of a polymer shell and a magnetic core [26]. In addition to their use in cancer Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Drug Treatments 281
treatment, polymer magnetic nanostructures have also been explored for use in drug 
delivery and imaging applications. These nanostructures can be functionalized with 
contrast agents or biomarkers, which can help to visualize cancerous tissue and mon￾itor the progression of the disease through magnetic resonance imaging scans.
15.2.2.  Carbon Magnetic Nanostructures
Carbon–magnetic hybrid nanostructures have emerged as a promising approach for 
cancer treatment [27]. These nanostructures are composed of both carbon-based 
materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, and magnetic materials, which 
allow them to be easily manipulated and targeted to specific areas within the body 
[28]. The potential applications of carbon magnetic hybrid nanostructures are in the 
realm of cancer therapeutics, detection, and the diagnosis of cancer [29]. The mag￾netic material allows the nanostructures to be directed to specific areas within the 
body using an external magnetic field, whereas the carbon-based material can be 
used to encapsulate and release the therapeutic agent at a controlled rate [30]. The 
most widely used carbon-hybrid materials are graphene and carbon nanotubes, both 
of which can be used to deliver cancer therapeutics, such as small interfering mole￾cules, which can help to inhibit the expression of specific genes that are involved in 
cancer development and progression [31]. Dual functioning magnetic multi-walled 
carbon nanotubes (MWCN) were also prepared by the addition of iron nanoparticles 
inside the capillary and surface functionalized with gadolinium using the wet chem￾ical method. The developed magnetic carbon structures can be used in imaging and 
magnetic hyperthermia applications in cancer treatment [32]. Graphene-oxide hybrid 
with magnetic material could significantly enhance the efficiency of antitumor effi￾ciencies both in vitro and in vivo through magneto-thermal effect and reactive oxy￾gen-species-related immunologic effect [33]. These studies demonstrate the potential 
of the carbon-magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer treatment and suggest that 
these nanostructures may be effective for delivering a wide range of cancer therapeu￾tics to specific areas within the body.
15.2.3. Noble-Metal-Based Magnetic Hybrid Nanostructures
Noble metals, such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, have unique chemi￾cal and physical properties that make them attractive for use in medicine. Cancer 
treatment using noble-metal-based magnetic hybrid nanostructures is a promising 
area of research that holds great potential for improving the effectiveness of cancer 
therapies. These properties, combined with the ability to manipulate their size and 
shape at the nanoscale, make them ideal candidates for use in cancer treatment. The 
morphology of the as-prepared nanostructures depends on the synthesis conditions 
used. Based on the synthesis techniques, different morphologies, such as rod-like, 
film, spherical, hierarchical, powder, and other morphologies, can be attained [33]. 
The most common structures of noble-metal-based magnetic hybrid nanostruc￾tures include nanorods, nanoprisms, nanocages, nanowires, nanocubes, hexagonal 
sheets, and nanospheres [34]. Gold nanoparticles are being explored to treat tumors 
by antitumor drug administration, hyperthermia, and angiogenesis inhibition [35]. 282 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
In addition, silver nanoparticles have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer 
cells, making them potentially useful for preventing the spread of cancer. Bian et al. 
reported the synthesis of silver nanocages decorated on an octreotide template based 
on peptide-directed silver mineralization. The particle size and morphology were 
fine-tuned through the addition of silver nitrate resulting in an optimized surface 
plasmon resonance behavior. The resulting catalysts were reported to have excel￾lent antitumor properties and photothermal efficiency [36]. Additionally, noble￾metal-based magnetic hybrid nanostructures are being used in cancer treatment by 
magnetic resonance imaging [37]. However, these materials have the potential to 
significantly impact the way that cancer is diagnosed and treated in the future.
15.2.4. Biomolecular Magnetic Nanostructures
The use of biomolecules conjugated to magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer 
diagnostics is also developed by several researchers. There are several examples of 
biomolecules, such as genetic materials, that can be conjugated into magnetic hybrid 
nanostructures for use in cancer diagnostics [38]. In a new study, a magnetic nano￾flower delivery system has been developed to target cancer therapy. Nucleic acid can 
be conveniently separated by introducing magnetic nanoparticles instead of the tradi￾tional nucleic acid structure. Biomolecules, such as DNA and proteins, can be conju￾gated into magnetic hybrid nanostructures to create contrast agents for use in cancer 
diagnostics. These nanostructures, which are typically composed of a magnetic core 
surrounded by a shell of biomolecules, can be used to enhance the visibility of can￾cerous tumors during imaging procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging or 
computed tomography. By incorporating DNA into the nanostructures, it is possible 
to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis, as the DNA can bind spe￾cifically to cancer-associated genes or proteins. This can help to diagnose cancer in 
its early stages, as well as to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. One of the main 
advantages of using biomolecules conjugated to magnetic hybrid nanostructures for 
cancer diagnostics is their ability to specifically target cancer cells. By designing 
the biomolecules to bind to specific receptors or biomarkers found on the surface of 
cancer cells, it is possible to create contrast agents that are preferentially taken up by 
tumor cells. This can help to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis, as well as 
to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Another potential use of magnetic hybrid 
nanostructures conjugated with biomolecules in cancer diagnostics is using biosen￾sors. These nanostructures can be designed to detect specific biomolecules that are 
associated with cancer, such as specific proteins or genetic mutations. By detecting 
these biomolecules, it is possible to diagnose cancer in its early stages, when it is 
most treatable.
15.3. CANCER DIAGNOSIS
The development of more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tools has allowed efficient 
and early diagnosis to be achieved. Several imaging techniques are being developed 
for cancer diagnosis, including magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic nanoprobes, 
magnetic nanoparticles for multimodal image acquisition, magnetic-optical imaging Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Drug Treatments 283
probes, and magnetic biosensors. A cancer diagnosis system has been developed by 
combining a variety of magnetic nanoparticles with hybrid nanostructures. The size, 
shape, crystalline structure, and chemical composition of magnetic hybrid nanopar￾ticles have a significant impact on their chemical and physical properties. The follow￾ing section provides in-depth information on magnetic hybrid nanoparticles involved 
in various diagnosis systems [39]. In particular, the diagnosis system is integrated 
with AI technology to enhance its performance. The purpose of this section is to 
discuss recently published articles on the integration of artificial intelligence with 
cancer diagnosis systems.
15.4. CANCER THERAPY
Currently, magnetic nanoparticles are used to diagnose cancer, allowing healthcare 
practitioners to observe cancer cells anywhere in the body. Alternatively, magnetic 
nanoparticles can be used in cancer therapy via chemotherapy drug delivery, stimu￾li-responsive drug delivery, hyperthermia, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, 
and magnetic nanorobots. This section provides an overview of magnetic nanoma￾terials and their nanocomposites that are used in the design of these therapeutic 
applications.
15.5. CHEMOTHERAPY DRUG DELIVERY OR 
ANTICANCER DRUG LOADING AND RELEASE
Chemotherapy drug delivery is a process of delivering anticancer drugs to target 
cancer cells while minimizing the effect on healthy tissues. Chemotherapy drugs can 
be delivered via a variety of methods, including intravenous injections, oral tablets, 
transdermal patches, and topical creams [40]. Traditional chemotherapy drugs are 
delivered through a systemic approach by administering intravenously and circu￾lating them throughout the body. This systemic approach has the potential to cause 
significant side effects due to the drug’s nonspecific targeting of healthy as well as 
cancerous cells [41]. To reduce the side effects and improve drug efficacy, various 
drug delivery systems have been developed to deliver chemotherapy drugs directly 
to tumors or tumor-associated tissues. Recent advancements in chemotherapy drug 
delivery have focused on improving the specificity of drug delivery and providing 
more localized targeted therapy. This approach has been particularly important in 
the treatment of solid tumors. Drug delivery systems allow cancer drugs to be local￾ized to the tumor site and released in a controlled manner.
15.5.1.  Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery
Stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems are drug delivery systems that can be pro￾grammed to release drugs in response to various external stimuli [42]. This type of 
system is used to control the release of drugs to maximize their therapeutic efficacy, 
reduce their side effects, and increase their safety [43]. Some of the most used stimuli 
are temperature, pH, light, and ultrasound. These stimuli cause a change in the mate￾rial, which allows the drug to be released from the material [44]. This type of drug 284 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
delivery has the potential to provide more precise and targeted drug delivery, which 
could lead to improved therapeutic outcomes. Research on this topic has focused 
on the development of materials that are responsive to the desired stimuli and can 
release the drug in response to the stimuli. Researchers have explored the use of 
polymeric materials, such as hydrogels and nanoparticles, as well as other materials, 
such as liposomes, for this purpose [45, 46]. Ultrasound-sensitive drug delivery sys￾tems use materials that are sensitive to sound waves, such as microbubbles, in order 
to release drugs in response to changes in sound intensity. Ultrasound can cause local 
high temperatures and membrane perforation, causing tumor cells to absorb drugs 
more readily by altering their membrane permeability [47]. Nanocarriers can release 
drugs by ultrasound through either the thermal or mechanical effects of cavitation 
or radiation forces. Physical forces exerted on nonsensitive nanocarriers cause struc￾tural destabilization, resulting in drug release [48]. This also causes blood vessels to 
become more permeable, allowing particles and drugs to enter tumors more easily.
15.5.2.  Hyperthermia Treatment for Cancer
Hyperthermia, or thermal therapy, is a cancer treatment that uses heat to damage or 
destroy cancer cells and shrinks tumors. Hyperthermia is a cancer treatment method 
in which the cancerous tissues were directly cured by heating the specific areas of 
a patient’s body that have a tumor. During the procedure, the patient is exposed to 
temperatures that are higher than normal body temperature, and the affected area 
is exposed to heat for several hours. As a result, the immune system responds more 
effectively against cancer, while immune suppression inhibits the overhauling of dam￾aged cancer cells [49]. Additionally, magnetic nanoparticles are injected directly into 
the tumor and then exposed to a strong magnetic field generated by an external source 
[21]. This field causes the particles to vibrate, creating heat that is then transferred 
to the tumor. The heat generated by the magnetic nanoparticles can kill cancer cells 
without damaging healthy tissue. This type of treatment is typically administered in 
combination with other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation [50]. Studies 
have shown that hyperthermia can be effective in treating some types of cancer, such 
as brain tumors and melanoma [18]. However, it is still considered experimental, and 
more research needs to be completed to determine its effectiveness in treating other 
types of cancer. Another example of a multifunctional magnetic nanostructure is mag￾netic hyperthermia agents [16]. Magnetic nanoparticles can be heated using an alter￾nating magnetic field, allowing clinicians to target specific regions of the body with 
thermal energy. This heat can be used to kill cancer cells and improve the effectiveness 
of chemotherapy drugs. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of magnetic 
nanoparticles to be used for in vivo hyperthermia cancer treatment. It was reported 
that synthesized-ferrites-based magnetic nanoparticles were nontoxic and exhibited 
improved structural, colloidal, magnetic properties, and heating performance.
15.6. CONCLUSION
Recent research has focused on developing multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles 
capable of imaging and delivering cancer-targeted therapies to patients. Magnetic Multifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles in Drug Treatments 285
nanoparticles have been used to manufacture microchips capable of detecting cancer 
earlier using an early detection system. In the future, a low-cost magnetic microchip 
system may be able to detect cancer sooner. A magnetic nanoparticle and nanosensor 
offers the advantages of both technologies—sensitivity and versatility in addition 
to low price and quick test time—for the diagnosis of cancers. However, biosensors 
require specialized magnetic wafers, making their implementation more challeng￾ing than sensors based on magnetic immune systems or electrochemical sensors. 
Compared to magnetite nanomaterials and their noble metal nanocomposites, ferrite 
materials offer the advantages of lower costs, rapid detection, and a simple operational 
procedure. Through the combination of magnetics and electrochemistry, cancer bio￾markers can be detected in circulating blood. Commercialization and translation to 
end users are still far off, and each stage of the process must be verified in real 
time. Moreover, several other issues need to be carefully checked to ensure that elec￾trodes are stable, repeatable, reproducible, and repeatable. A biosensing application 
relies on magnetic nanoparticles with advanced surface functionality. Among the 
key developments are the accurate control of magnetic nanoparticles as well as their 
uniform size distribution, crystal structure, and shape. The magnetic properties have 
been standardized by recent developments in preparation procedures, and this allows 
for the magnetic properties to be stabilized and thus used in very sensitive biosensors 
for cancer detection.

Issues of Multifunctional 
Magnetic Nanoparticles

16.1. INTRODUCTION
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have emerged as attractive materi￾als for a variety of biomedical applications, such as drug administration, imaging, 
and cancer therapy. Their unusual magnetic properties, as well as their capacity to 
be functionalized with a variety of ligands, make them ideal for therapeutic drug 
delivery and control. However, the safety and toxicity of MNPs are key factors in 
their therapeutic application [1, 2].
MNPs’ possible negative effects on biological systems are currently being inves￾tigated [3, 4]. Concerns have been expressed about their cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, 
immunotoxicity, and neurotoxicity [5, 6]. These effects vary according to particle 
size, shape, surface coating, and exposure route [7–9].
Understanding the mechanisms causing MNP toxicity is critical for identifying 
measures to reduce its consequences. Oxidative damage, inflammation, and inter￾actions with biological molecules have all been implicated in MNP-induced toxicity 
[3, 4].
MNPs are tiny particles that exhibit magnetic characteristics. MNPs’ magnetic 
characteristics can be conveyed using a variety of metals, including nickel, cobalt, 
and iron. Coating the magnetic core with both natural and synthetic polymers, such 
as fibronectin, dextran, along with RGD peptides, can improve biocompatibility by 
protecting biological entities from detrimental interactions [10]. Surface topography, 
protein-binding ability, along with surface charge changes may all be utilized to tai￾lor surface coatings to specific requirements [11]. This has less harmful effects while 
increasing particle functionalization, which promotes improved interaction with bio￾logical entities [12]. MNP behavior can also be influenced by particle size [13] and 
magnetism (paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and superparamagnetic) [14].
To fulfill a broader range of applications, multifunctional nanoparticles must be 
reengineered and modified at their surfaces. Combining fluorescence properties, 
near-infrared absorption, along with photon scattering is especially preferred as they 
all significantly enhance in vivo imaging competence. But this is not an easy process. 290 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Combining, for example, the properties that enable good NIR response with those 
that make a particle an effective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast sub￾stance is a challenging undertaking [15]. It takes special and intricate methods to get 
all of the necessary qualities. Gold, a noble metal, was applied to the outer layer of 
nanoparticles by Jin et al. [15] in order to increase their multifunctionality and blend 
their ability to absorb near-infrared light with that of dispersing photons. This team 
successfully created homogeneous gold-coated MNPs that keep their measurements 
and electrical power, stay magnetized, and maintain their thermal characteristics 
as well as their ability to respond to NIR spectra by creating smooth nanoparticles 
with the core spatially segregated from the shell [15]. Mahmoudi and colleagues 
went above and beyond by synthesizing gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles featur￾ing uneven edges, which facilitated Raman spectroscopy and therefore molecular 
imaging [16]. Mahmoudi and Shokrgozar tried to increase the variety of uses of these 
particles in different research by putting a fluorescent polymeric dye among the gold 
coating and the core [17]. In vivo or in vitro imaging now has an extra imaging mode 
thanks to this straightforward addition.
In this chapter, we present a complete summary of our current understanding of 
the safety and toxicity issues connected with multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles. 
We will go over the physicochemical features of MNPs that influence their biocom￾patibility and toxicity, the methods of cellular uptake and biodistribution, and the 
potential negative consequences for biological systems. Furthermore, we will look at 
options for improving the safety profile of MNPs and reducing potential dangers. By 
summarizing the existing literature on this topic, we hope to provide insights into the 
challenges and potential for responsible MNP development and use in a variety of 
applications while protecting human health and the environment.
16.2. SAFETY AND TOXICITY ISSUES OF MNPs
Toxicity issues are a major worry since they are essential to tissue engineering along 
with regenerative medicine. As mentioned previously, MNPs are used in regenera￾tive medicine; however, only when cells (therapeutic agents) are labeled with MNPs, 
the cells can be inserted into the body. Using dangerous particles gradually can 
significantly lower cell-based therapy’s therapeutic effectiveness [18]. The study of 
the detrimental effects of biological, physical, or chemical substances people and 
animals, as well as the environment, is known as toxicology [19]. Reduced mito￾chondrial activity, membrane leakage, and aberrant morphology are the outcomes of 
toxic cellular impacts. This may negatively impact the viability of cells and prolif￾eration, including metabolic activity, which would lower the treatment’s therapeutic 
effectiveness [20]. There is always a chance that MNPs may migrate throughout 
the body after being placed into treatment and transferred into organs, where they 
will inevitably infiltrate and accumulate. The body could react to this by becoming 
inflammatory or immune [19]. All of these are incredibly undesirable results. For 
this purpose, stem cell labeling necessitates both the long-term retention of MNPs 
and the preservation of typical cellular properties [21]. This begs the question, would 
any of the characteristics of MNPs linked to regenerative medicine have a negative 
impact on the body (in vivo applications) or on cells (in vitro applications)?Safety and Toxicity Issues 291
The properties of MNPs, such as their structural characteristics, dose, and 
intended use, all have an impact on how poisonous they are to biological beings [19]. 
It’s possible that the particles’ inherent chemical makeup makes them dangerous. It’s 
interesting to note that some minerals, like gold, that are regarded as harmless in 
large amounts can turn toxic at the nanoscale [19]. Some metals—like cobalt, nickel, 
cadmium, zinc, and silver—are poisonous to living things and should not be used in 
biomedical applications. On the other hand, titanium- and iron-oxide-based particles 
are believed to be far less hazardous to cells [22].
It has been demonstrated that the presence of cadmium selenide (CdSe) causes 
cadmium ions to cause cell death in primary hepatocytes [18]. Additionally, it is cru￾cial to put MNPs into cells [18]. If MNPs are absorbed by disrupting the biological 
activity of a cell, for instance, they may trigger a cytotoxic reaction; yet if they are 
attached to the cell membrane, they wouldn’t [18]. However, in other situations, stick￾ing SPIONs to the cell surface may interfere with cell-surface contact [12]. In addi￾tion, physical characteristics like surface coating and size, along with the shape of the 
particles, might potentially cause a dangerous reaction by coagulating and aggregat￾ing in accordance with those characteristics [19]. It is crucial to take into account the 
destiny of the MNPs once they are liberated from the cells when talking about what is 
possible in vivo uses of MNP. Taking into account MNP degradation and the effects 
of building up MNPs or MNP by-products in different tissues and organs provides 
additional difficulties [3]. It is believed that degradation products interact with a range 
of physiological elements and cells. Because of this, it is important to fully investigate 
how the breakdown products affect the nearby tissue [3]. Therefore, it is impossible to 
make assumptions in this field, and appropriate research should be ongoing.
MNP toxicity is mostly thought to originate from oxidative stress at the cellular 
level [23]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are destructive oxidants like hydro￾gen peroxide along with hydroxyl radicals, and helpful antioxidants like glutathione 
as well as vitamin C are out of balance, leading to oxidative stress. Most often, insuf￾ficient oxygen reduction results in the production of ROS [24].
The buildup of oxidants ultimately causes cellular proteins, enzymes, lipids, 
including nucleic acids to break down, compromising regular biological processes 
and culminating in the development of illness, cell apoptosis, and necrosis [24]. ROS 
can be produced by the surface of the MNP, metal ions leaking out of the core, or the 
release of oxidants by enzymatic degradation [3].
An optical dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe can be used to monitor ROS pro￾duction after SPION injection [20]. It has been demonstrated that dissociated iron 
oxide MNP increases the production of ROS and hydroxyl radicals, which may 
impair cell metabolism, promote apoptosis, and cause cellular toxicity [12]. However, 
ROS may be used in cancer treatment to eliminate dangerous cancer cells [24].
16.2.1.  Toxicity Mechanisms
As previously mentioned, the main causes of in vivo toxicity are the buildup and dis￾semination of MNPs. It is generally known that the three factors of particle dimen￾sion, particle coating, and particle mass govern the biodistribution of MNPs [25]. 
Specific examples of these traits that affect MNP biodistribution will be covered in 292 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
this section. Opsonization, a method by which antibodies identify foreign pathogens 
(in this case, MNPs) for phagocyte clearance, has been used to investigate the biodis￾tribution of MNPs [26]. Within minutes, it was demonstrated that optonized MNPs 
were removed from the circulation and distributed as follows: 80–90% via the liver, 
5–8% by way of the spleen, and 1% across the bone marrow [25].
Moreover, the particle surface has a major influence on MNP interaction and toxic￾ity. Therefore, studies of the best coatings for excretable, functioning MNPs are needed.
Depending on the size of the particles and the barriers separating the circulatory 
system from the tissues, the body circulates and eliminates them in different ways.
According to Zamay et al. [27], 40% of MNPs are excreted via urine 24 hours 
after birth, having been removed from the endocrine system. MNP distribution was 
as follows: the kidneys removed particles with diameters of less than 20 nm; the 
heart, kidneys, bone marrow, and stomach cleared particles 30–150 nm, while the 
liver and spleen accumulated particles between 150 nm and 300 nm. Since macro￾phages, which are responsible for eliminating MNPs along with other foreign mate￾rials, are highly concentrated in these organs, the bulk of MNPs accumulate there.
Figure 16.1 depicts how MNPs are distributed throughout the body. It is import￾ant to remember that a rise in concentration with untreated MNPs often follows a 
decrease in particle dimension, resulting in a longer period for blood circulation [27].
FIGURE 16.1 Biodistribution of MNPs in organs and tissues (Ref. [27]).Safety and Toxicity Issues 293
Because too much intracellular iron might harm cellular constituents including 
proteins and nucleic acids, the most pertinent safety mechanism to be studied is 
interfering with normal, physiological iron metabolism after in vivo MNP break￾down [28]. Because of this, it is essential to be able to track the development and 
elimination of these particles over time while researching MNP toxicity profiles. The 
best suitable MNP design for a given function may be identified thanks to variations 
in MNP form, dimension, structure, and surface.
16.2.2. Methods for liMitiNg toxicity
Biocompatibility and suitable surface chemistry are two desirable qualities of MNPs 
that support a healthy safety profile [9]. One of the best methods for lessening these 
MNPs’ detrimental impacts is modifying the surface. Changes to the surface can 
slow down MNP aggregation, prevent magnetic property changes so that MNP 
remains effective, and limit adhesion involving plasma proteins so that major inflam￾matory reactions are avoided in vivo. For example, enhancing the hydrophilicity of 
nanoparticles decreases the probability of MNP recognition by macrophages, lead￾ing to extended periods of blood circulation. In imaging and tracking applications, 
this is frequently needed.
Targeted ligands having functional characteristics that cause these advantageous 
surface modifications might include aptamers, polysaccharides, peptides, antibodies, 
as well as small acidic compounds. Ligands functionalize MNPs, prolonging their 
duration in the bloodstream and enabling more targeted distribution. In a study, aptam￾ers have shown minimal cytotoxicity at extremely high doses ( ) 100− µ 200 g/mL [29]. 
Iron oxide nanoparticles with magnetic properties were coated with the amino acid 
arginine by Nosrati et al. [30], and the surface of the nanoparticles was subsequently 
conjugated with PEG.
Using an in vitro hemolysis assay and an in vivo mouse model, respectively, cyto￾toxicity and hemocompatibility tests were conducted. Colorimetric assays were used 
to test the viability of a kidney cell line and a fibroblast at different sample concen￾trations (Figure 16.2a, b). The altered nanoparticles were contrasted with unaltered 
iron oxide nanoparticles.
Fewer than 2 8. % of hemolytic activity and no discernible impacts of PEG-Arg@
IONPs on cell line development were shown by the results, indicating acceptable 
blood biocompatibility. Lastly, MRI techniques were used to assess the in vivo 
clearance along with biodegradation of MNPs, and the results showed long blood 
circulation periods and safe MNP breakdown [30]. The capping approach is very 
new and has produced less cytotoxicity than an unmodified surface, despite the 
fact that there are several potential methods for enhancing the surface composi￾tion of MNPs. Last but not least, functionalizing MNPs with coatings and surface 
alterations might increase biocompatibility while lowering the possibility of accu￾mulation or unfavorable host reactions. It is essential to investigate the mean blood 
circulation length along with the distribution in the body of MNP clearance in order 
to optimize the application of magnetic particles imaging (MPI). In light of this, it is 
essential to conduct and publish studies that successfully lower toxicity. Keselman 
et al. [31] effective prolongation of MNP blood circulation duration was achieved 294 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
without causing harm to macrophages or healthy cells within a predetermined dura￾tion. In female rats, they examined the in vivo organ biodistribution along with 
clearance time of two tracers: LS-008 (LodeSpin Labs, Seattle, WA, USA) and 
Ferucarbotran (Meito Sangyo Co., Japan). The outcomes demonstrated that while 
the LS-008 tracers were filtered by the spleen after being in circulation for several 
hours, the majority of Ferucarbotran tracers were quickly filtered through the liver. 
According to the study’s findings, MPI could identify the nanoparticles under the 
study’s long-term clearance as well as their short-term biodistribution. All things 
considered, our work shows that MPI can lessen toxicity concerns while simul￾taneously tracking the long-term clearance and short-term biodistribution of two 
common MPI tracers. This work demonstrates that, for some applications, specific 
MNP tracers may be a safer option.

16.3. CHALLENGES
16.3.1. Toxicity of MNPs
A wide range of materials at the nanoscale can now be produced thanks to recent 
developments in nanotechnology. Reports state that components linked to nanosci￾ence and nanotechnology are present in over 500 consumer items [32]. Over 12 nano￾medicines have been authorized by the FDA thus far, and many more are nearing 
the end of their development [32]. One of the most urgent issues that needs greater 
research is the toxicity of magnetic nanoparticles. Accurate reporting of nanoparticle 
toxicity has proven challenging due to the multiplicity of parameters that influence 
toxicity, such as dosage, chemical makeup, mode of administration, dimensions, bio￾degradable properties dissolution, pharmaceutical kinetics biological distribution, 
chemical composition of the surface, design, and morphology. Among these vari￾ables, altering magnetic nanoparticles’ surface properties can be a useful method 
for lowering toxicity [33]. Comprehensive cytotoxicity investigations should be con￾ducted both in vitro and in vivo in order to fully comprehend the toxic effects of 
nanoparticles, as in vitro experimental findings may be deceptive [34]. Crucially, it 
has been demonstrated that a number of nanomaterials obstruct cell viability tests 
[35]. For instance, Monteiro-Riviere et  al. recently demonstrated that interactions 
between nanoparticles and dyes can cause classic dye-based tests (such as MTT and 
neutral red [NR] assays, which evaluate cell viability) to provide false findings [36]. 
Numerous studies would be required to verify the toxicity of nanoparticles [37].
Iron oxide nanoparticles have been the subject of the most research when it comes 
to magnetic nanoparticle toxicity. These extensively utilized and presumably biocom￾patible nanoparticles—which include Feridex® along with Endorem®—have been 
employed in MRI applications. According to Cengelli et al., brain-derived endothelial 
EC219 cells and murine N9 and N11 microglial cells were not harmed by iron oxide 
nanoparticles encapsulated with dextran and other PVAs [38]. According to Müller 
et al., human monocyte–macrophage interactions were not toxically affected by the 
iron oxide nanoparticle Ferumoxtran-10 (Sinerem®, Guerbet, France; Combidex®, 
Advanced Magnetics, USA) at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml over a 72-hour period; 
at very high concentrations of 10 mg/ml, this may have been slightly toxic [39].
16.3.2.  Targeting and Regulating Magnetic NPs Using
an External Magnetic Field
Reaching the targeted treatment location using magnetic nanoparticle drug carri￾ers is one of the most challenging problems in magnetic particle-based therapeutics. 
Despite a great deal of work being put into creating magnetic carriers, control strat￾egies for these nanoparticles are still rather basic and often involve placing a perma￾nent magnet close to the desired location [40, 23]. Particle focusing is not optimally 
achieved with this control mechanism, and the tissue penetration depth of permanent 
magnets’ magnetic field is limited to 8–12 cm [41, 42], the use of this method on 
deeper tumors is thus prohibited.296 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

far left, a single magnet allows for continuous operation. (b): The ferrofluid is moved toward 
the center by varying the intensity of a magnet, so achieving dynamic control. (c) Ferrofluid 
concentration map with a temporal average shows the hot area in the middle. (Reproduced with 
permission from Ref. [44]. Copyright 2009 Elsevier).
Using magnetic implants, which may magnetize magnetic nanoparticles when 
needed, is one way to improve local medication delivery [43]. Shapiro suggests direct￾ing magnetic carriers toward deeply embedded tissue targets by using dynamically 
modulated magnetic fields [44]. Another kind of magnetic control was developed, con￾sisting of eight magnets, each of which was controlled by a different algorithm. The 
results of the simulation suggested that a magnetic fluid may be driven into the center 
by dynamically controlled magnets, creating a hot spot at the target (Figure 16.3).Safety and Toxicity Issues 297
Despite the fact that this technique seems very promising, it’s crucial to empha￾size that controlling nanoparticles in vivo is far more challenging. There aren’t many 
models on this topic [45–47]; nonetheless, an ideal strategy that takes into account 
intricate vascular structure and blood flow must be developed.
16.4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) show significant potential for a vari￾ety of biomedical applications, such as drug administration, imaging, and cancer 
therapy. However, their clinical translation necessitates a comprehensive examina￾tion of their safety and toxicity profiles. This chapter has thoroughly analyzed the 
potential negative effects of MNPs on numerous biological systems, investigated the 
role of many factors in their toxicity, and reviewed current knowledge of the under￾lying mechanisms. We have also discussed regulatory considerations and guidelines 
for the safe use of MNPs in biomedical settings. MNPs’ toxicity varies according to 
their physicochemical features, such as size, shape, surface coating, and exposure 
route. Understanding these characteristics is critical for developing and optimizing 
MNPs for specific applications while reducing hazards. More study is needed to bet￾ter understand the mechanisms driving MNP toxicity and find measures to reduce 
its consequences. Long-term studies are also needed to determine MNPs’ possible 
chronic toxicity and influence on human health. By resolving the safety and toxic￾ity concerns connected with MNPs, researchers, and physicians can maximize their 
potential for biomedical applications while protecting patients’ well-being.
MNPs offer a useful, noninvasive way to track, control, and target stem cells in 
order to maximize treatment for use in clinical settings. Nevertheless, safety con￾cerns could make using MNP in regenerative medicine illegal. Alternative tech￾niques for tracking and controlling stem cells in vivo would have to be developed as 
a result. Before performing an in vivo transplant, the procedure’s safety needs to be 
established, regardless of the technique’s therapeutic effectiveness. Actually, a wide 
variety of particles are available for study as well as commerce. Because of this, it is 
hard to give a firm response to the query, “Are MNPs toxic?” Each proposed usage 
of MNPs should have its negative consequences evaluated. There have been no unfa￾vorable consequences from marking stem cells with SPIONs, according to several in 
vitro toxicity studies. Conversely, long-term in vivo studies have not gotten as much 
attention and are therefore an important field of study.

17 Future Perspectives 
of Multifunctional 
Magnetic Nanoparticles 
in Therapy, Biology, 
and Pharmacy

17.1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic nanoparticles are widely employed in many different applications, such as 
cell sorting, DNA, MRI, isolation, treatment of hyperthermia, and medicine admin￾istration. The most widely used magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical applications 
have been magnetite nanocrystals due to their chemical stability and biocompatibil￾ity. To get around these problems, a lot of research has focused on surface modifica￾tion of nanoparticles (NPs) using a variety of functional groups (such as carboxyl and 
amine groups). However, it takes a lot of work and time to add functional groups to 
the surface of magnetite nanoparticles. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) in 
biomedical applications is currently hindered by a number of important issues, such 
as good dispersibility in aqueous solutions, biocompatibility, and functionality (1).
Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) are an intracellular contrast 
agent with a prolonged cellular residence time after phagocytosis. Clathrin receptors, 
which are implicated in the internalization of many different nanoparticles, have 
been proposed as potential factors influencing SPION uptake. After internalization, 
SPION congregates in lysosomes, where it co-localizes with dextranases and accu￾mulates iron before being gradually broken down. The biosynthesis of SPION@Ag@
Cs will be described in this chapter along with a green route approach and the neces￾sary steps to prepare them for a variety of medical applications (2, 3).
17.2. BIOSYNTHESIS SPION@PLASMONIC@CHITOSAN 
CORE-SHELL NANOCOMPOSITE FROM FUNGUS SPECIES
A wide range of techniques have been used to create nanomaterials with precise sizes 
and shapes. These techniques are typically divided into two categories: top-down 
and bottom-up. Green chemistry is a low-cost, environmentally friendly option that 302 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
is being used more and more for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Recent research has 
examined a wide range of organisms, including human cells, plants, algae, bacteria, 
fungi, and yeast, to see which ones would be the best for efficient synthesis. By 
reducing metal ions into metal atoms and acting as capping agents, these biosystems 
aid in the production and stabilization of the resultant nanoparticles. The goal of the 
expanding discipline of biosynthesis is to replace hazardous products created from 
petrochemicals that are bad for the environment and energy (4–6).
Because of their amazing qualities, which may be used in a variety of applications, 
superparamagnetic nanoparticles are among the most intriguing metals. The medical 
field can employ them for effective drug targeting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
improved surface-to-volume ratio biosensors, and hyperthermia cancer therapy due to 
their ease of separation, biocompatibility, and high refractive index. Other intriguing 
metals include silver nanoparticles, which have a special surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) characteristic that has greatly expanded their use in biosensors and biomedical 
imaging. Due to its historical use as a potent antimicrobial in processes and utensils, 
silver has been widely employed in industry as an antimicrobial and antifungal (7, 8).
Due to their characteristics being notably different from their mass, core-shell 
metals are receiving more attention these days. Size-induced quantum-size confine￾ment in metal core-shell nanoparticles has been observed. Recently, other sophis￾ticated functional applications have been researched, including optoelectronics, 
sensors, electronics, and catalysis. The amalgamation of characteristics from both 
types of nanoparticles presents intriguing uses in surface-enhanced Raman scatter￾ing, catalytic degradation, electrochemical sensors, and cancer cell apoptosis. Their 
antifungal and antibacterial properties have also been demonstrated (9, 10).
Here, our goal is to synthesize a FeO@Ag core shell using a green, facile one￾pot method. To do this, we will let the magnetic nanoparticles grow in a medium 
containing Ag atom nucleation seeds and fungus filtrates, and we will examine 
how well three different fungal species—Aspergillus deflectus, Fusarium oxys‑
porum, and Penicillium pinophilum—produce the core shell functionalized with 
chitosan. The findings showed that all three species, with the exception of F. oxys‑
porum, contributed to the creation of the nanocomposites. Additionally, the studies 
demonstrate that the generated core-shell nanocomposites have very little cytotox￾icity, making them suitable for use in cellular imaging, drug targeting vectors, and 
hyperthermia.
Mycelia and the fungal filtrate have been separated in an aseptic environment. 
After the creation of the seeds, 2.5 mM Fe( ) SO4 and 5 mM FeCl3 were added, they 
were mixed together with 50 mL of sterile distilled water (pH adjusted to 12.5), and 
the mixture was agitated vigorously for an hour at room temperature. This was done 
in a spotless Erlenmeyer flask. Then 50 cc of 2 mM AgNO3 was combined with the 
fungal filtrates. The magnetic nanoparticle seeds were mixed with the latter solution 
and agitated rapidly at 37°C. After being subjected to many washings, the nanoparti￾cles were separated using centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and 0°C after a 72-hour inter￾val. FTIR and UV/visible spectroscopy were utilized to investigate the development 
of the core shell (11).
We have devised a simple, straightforward, and environmentally friendly one-pot 
technique that produces monodispersed, crystalline, superparamagnetic Ag covered Future Perspectives 303
FIGURE 17.1 HRTEM of Ag-FeO-chitosan core shell NPs biosynthesized from (a) A.

with a chitosan core shell at ambient temperature. The outcomes validate the com￾posite’s plasmonic and magnetic characteristics. The biosynthesis of the core-shell 
nanocomposites was shown to be effective in all three species; however, Fusarium 
oxysporum exhibited the best zeta potential and lowest particle size distribution. Less 
than 20% of the examined cell lines were cytotoxic to the core shells of the three 
species; however, at 100 ppm doses, F. oxysporum exhibited 30% cytotoxicity with 
MCF7 and P. pinopholium 33% with PC3.
According to the findings, these nanoparticles can be safely used for imaging, 
hyperthermia, and medication delivery. The easy method of creating nano core-shell 
synthesis and its possible use in medical applications are innovative aspects of this 
work. The creation of γF2O3-based core-shell Ag functionalized with chitosan has 
provided us with numerous opportunities to synthesize various types of core-shell 
nanoparticles that are safe for use in imaging, biosensing, and drug delivery. With 
a one-pot biosynthesis process, conclusive characterization data demonstrate the 304 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy

creation of Ag covered with chitosan core shell and γF2O3-. They are an ideal can￾didate for medication and gene delivery, biosensors, and hyperthermia due to their 
form, size, superparamagnetic qualities, zeta potential data, and minimal cytotoxicity 
(12–14).
The goal of this effort was to identify the ideal fungal species for the plasmonic@
superparamagnetic core-shell nanoparticle biosynthesis. This work has been finished 
with the Fusarium oxysporum selection.
17.3. PREPARATION CONDITIONS EFFECT ON THE 
PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC–
PLASMONIC CORE–SHELL NANOPARTICLES 
FUNCTIONALIZED WITH CHITOSAN: GREEN ROUTE
The forces that drive the uptake of nanoparticles into the cells may be hydrophobic, 
electrostatic, bending, stretching, or restricted receptor endocytosis. Depending on 
the particle size, one of these forces will predominate. When particles are very small, 
the bending force predominates and mediates the membrane’s deformation, but when 
particles are larger, the stretching force is in charge of the membrane’s deformation. 
According to Ref. (15), adhesion strength, membrane tension, and bending energy 
all have a role in how easily nanoparticles enter cells. When specific proteins bind 
to nanoparticles, the reticuloendothelial system removes them from the body and 
facilitates subsequent clearance. As a result, the relationship between the uptake and 
the size of nanoparticles is a competition between the bending and stretching forces 
of the membrane (16).
Thus regulating the size and form of nanoparticles is essential for both commer￾cial and medicinal uses (17–19). The reaction temperature, pH, rate of nucleation, 
and reaction duration were found to be the physicochemical characteristics that best 
represent the size and form of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) (20). Ref. (21) has also 
demonstrated that the mechanism by which Au NPs enter cells is by receptor-medi￾ated endocytosis. They have shown that Au NPs with a low-aspect-ratio rod shape 
are probably going to exhibit more cellular uptake than those with a high aspect ratio. 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the morphologies of the nanoparticles 
play a crucial influence in determining their activity within the cell (22).
The kind of base that is employed in the co-precipitation procedure to generate 
magnetic nanoparticles greatly influences the qualities of the final product as well as 
the size and distribution of the particles. In order to investigate the impact of prepa￾ration conditions on the physicochemical properties and, consequently, the possible 
medical applications of these nanoparticles, we have chosen two distinct tempera￾tures and concentrations of salt for this work. For the co-precipitation process of iron 
oxides, we have chosen two distinct temperatures: room temperature and 80°C. In 
addition, we have maintained the Ag formation process reaction at room temperature 
because this reaction takes place in the presence of fungal filtrates, and an increase 
in temperature would impact the organic materials in the filtrate. Additionally, we 
chose two distinct iron salt ratios, 1:1 and 1:2, while the AgNO3 salt was constant as 
it was optimized elsewhere and it was beyond our interest (23).306 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
The process of synthesis relies on the deposition of Ag-atoms onto the seeds of 
iron oxide nanoparticles (FeO NPs) through the regulated reduction of Ag precursor 
in a growth solution that contains FeO NPs [27]. Under antiseptic circumstances, the 
fungal filtrates and mycelia were meticulously separated. Ag NP seeds were prepared 
in the following manner: 50mL of fungal filtrates were mixed with 2 mM AgNO3, 
and the mixture was vigorously shaken at 37°C.
Three methods have been used to prepare the FeO NPs seed solution: (a) Put 
2.5 mM Fe S( O )4 and 5 mM FeCl3 in a sterile Erlenmeyer flask. (b) 2.5 mMFe S( ) O4
and 5 mM FeCl3 were combined in 50mL of sterile distilled water while being vigor￾ously shaken at room temperature. (c) 10 mM FeCl3 and 5 mM Fe S( ) O . 4 They were 
combined at 80°C with vigorous shaking in 50 mL of sterile distilled water. The 
three samples had their pH adjusted to 12.5. For 72 hours, the two solutions were 
combined while being shaken at 37°C.
After the nanoparticles were cleaned, FTIR and UV/visible spectroscopy were 
used to investigate the core-shell development. We did not add chitosan to the 
reaction, as the results and interpretation of the ATR-FTIR data will demonstrate. 
Instead, the functionalization of chitosan active groups on the surface of the nano￾composite is spontaneous in the reaction mechanism due to the presence of chitin 
(the deacetylated form of chitosan in the fungus’s cell wall).
The production of chitosan as the outermost layer in the nanocomposite γ - F2O3@Ag
was confirmed by our findings. The results demonstrate the enhancement of LSPR 
with increasing preparation temperature and Fe-salt concentration. Moreover, the 
sample with the highest concentration of Fe-salt exhibited the highest magnetic, 
crystallinity, lowest particle sizes, and lowest cytotoxicity. Ag shell presence, which 
inhibited Fe oxidation, has been identified as the cause of the weakening of the Fe 
peak in the XRD pattern. Furthermore, the blue shift in the LSPR of Fe@Ag dis￾covered in comparison to pure Ag shows a decrease in the Ag ratio to the benefit of 
Fe content, suggesting that the plasmonic effect may be tuned with changes in salt 
concentration and consequently particle size decrease.
Since the magnetic nanoparticles below 20 nm are superparamagnetic, the superpara￾magnetic behavior at the highest Fe ratio can be explained by the decrease in particle size. 
As Ag salt is reduced to generate Ag Nps, oxidation of the carbonyl and amino groups 
in the chitosan adsorbed on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles may be the cause of 
the rise in absorbance at regions 1550-1500 and 1400-1200 -1 cm . The information 
highlights the value of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and transmission in characterizing 
structural alterations in nanoparticle interfaces as a result of preparation conditions.
According to the Zeta potential values, there is sufficient electrostatic repulsion 
force between particles to prevent Brownian motion-induced attraction and collision. 
This has an impact on the stability of magnetic-plasmonic core-shell nanoparticles. 
All things considered, the findings validate that the preparation conditions of these 
magnetic-plasmonic core-shell nanoparticles could be successfully adjusted and con￾trolled and that their physicochemical characteristics show that they are excellent 
candidates for use in medicine (23). Using a high-resolution transmission electron 
microscope (HRTEM) (Figure 17.3), it is possible to observe how sample B’s break￾like structures and sample A’s spherical nanoparticles formed. Additionally, the num￾bers attest to the particle size being smaller than 50 nm. Utilizing picture J, a particle 
size distribution was carried out. The findings indicate that the created nanoparticle FIGURE 17.3 HRTEM and the corresponding particle size distribution of Fe2 3 O @Ag @Cs

indicating the creation of a cluster and sub-cluster of nanoparticles. Figure 17.3 dis￾plays the distribution of particle sizes.

17.4. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF GINGER-LOADED 
NANOPARTICLE VERSUS GINGER EXTRACT 
AS A NOVEL THERAPY OF EXPERIMENTALLY 
INDUCED ACUTE ULCERATIVE COLITIS
A crippling chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is more common in young 
women is called ulcerative colitis (UC) (24–26). Over the past ten years, emerging 
nations like Egypt have seen a rapid increase in the frequency of UC, despite the 
condition being more common in western nations (27). The symptoms of UC include 
bloody stools, stomach pain, and diarrhea that can go away and return. It frequently 
begins proximally at the rectum and spreads to encompass the entire colon (28–30). 
Numerous variables, including intestinal microbiota, epithelial function, mucosal 
immunology, and genetic vulnerability, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
ulcerative colitis (UC), while their exact roles remain unclear (31). These factors are 
thought to cause a decrease in antioxidant activity and an increase in the formation 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn causes colonic inflammation (32).
UC is being treated with immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory medications 
in traditional medicine. Numerous potentially fatal side effects of these medications 
include infection and an elevated risk of cancer (33, 34). Targeted therapy, specifically 
anti-TNF-α and selective adhesion molecule inhibitors, has been developed recently to 
combat inflammatory reactions in ulcerative colitis. However, severe side effects, high 
cost, and need for systemic administration of these medicines limit their utilization (35).
Research is focused on discovering alternative therapies because the pharmaco￾logical treatment that is now available has numerous drawbacks. Herbs have been 
utilized for numerous ailments, including cancer, in traditional and folk medicine 
(36, 37). They also have antioxidant and anticancer properties. In albino rats, ginger 
extract reduces inflammation and inhibits the growth of ulcers (38, 39). The active 
ingredients in ginger, called shogaols or gingerols, have anti-inflammatory, anticar￾cinogenic, and antioxidative qualities. They have also successfully decreased colitis 
(40). Considering that its LD50 is roughly 1 g/kg, it is safe to use (41).
Recently, drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles were created and tested 
to enhance the therapeutic outcome of ulcerative colitis. This method significantly 
improves the treatment of UC by preventing the loaded drug from degrading in the 
environment, increasing its solubility, augmenting its absorption, lowering systemic 
toxicity, and enabling sustained release of the drug (42–43).
This work aims to assess the efficacy and prospective applications of ginger-de￾rived nanoparticles (GDNP) in treating acute UC in DSS/ethanol rat model in com￾parison to ginger extract (GE) (45).310 MF-NPs in Therapy, Biology, and Pharmacy
Eight weeks is the typical age of mature male albino rats (180–250 g) that are 
clear of particular pathogens. Animal Breeding Core Helwan were kept in isolator 
plastic cages with shavings, two or three per cage, under conventional laboratory 
settings (sterilized food, 50% humidity, temperature at 23–24°C, and a 12-hour light￾dark cycle). Following a two-week period of quarantine, all rats were divided into 
experimental and control groups based on their body weight. Every rat was given 
unrestricted access to a commercial feed and regular tap water in separate bottles. 
The Ethical Committee of Helwan University authorized all procedures, which com￾plied with the rules set forth by the animal house of Ain Shams University. Animals 
were included and excluded from the study based on no predetermined standards. 
The allocation and treatment of the groups were known only to the authors. Fifty 
grams of raw ginger were cleaned, dehydrated, and mixed. Using distilled water, the 
blended extract was adjusted to 200 mL, centrifuged at 3000 gm for 29 minutes, and 
the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 gm for 40 minutes. After being separated, 
the supernatant was sonicated for 10 seconds using 1 mg/mL SPION@Ag.

The amide II NH2 band disappears in the NPs functionalized with ginger spec￾trum, a new band appears at 1020 cm-1

the notable alteration in the spectrum of ginger.
The immobilization of ginger on the surface of NPs was confirmed by the UV/
visible spectrum of both ginger and NPs functionalized with ginger, which were 
reported at (Figure 17.7b). Figure 17.7c displays the superparamagnetic nanoparticles

OXIDE NANOPARTICLES AND BEE VENOM ON SOME 
GENES’ EXPRESSION IN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA
According to (47), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of can￾cer-related mortality and the fifth most frequent malignancy worldwide. Liver cirrhosis 
is linked to the majority of HCC cases (48). In order to improve target cell accu￾mulation and reduce side effects from high-dose chemotherapy, na noparticle-based 
cancer treatments offer a novel way of delivering anticancer drugs directly to tumor 
cells and to drug-resistant cancer cells at effective quantities (49–53). A novel type of Future Perspectives 313

The National Research Centre (NRC) Dokki in Giza, Egypt, provided 42 male 
albino rats weighing 18,010 grams. Polypropylene cages with stainless steel wire 
coverings were used to house seven rats in each cage. The rats were kept in a regular 
laboratory environment with water, food, and a 12-hour light-dark cycle. After all 
animal operations were finished in accordance with the experimental animal care

by HCC. Group III HCC rats were administered sorafenib (10 mg/kg b.wt.) for a 
period of 15 days (El-Ashmawy et al. 2017). Group IV HCC rats were administered 
Fe2O3@Ag@Cs core shell NPs (10 mg/kg b.wt.) for a period of 15 days in Group III

venom (10 mg/kg b.wt.) and sorafenib loaded on Fe2O3@Ag@Cs core-shell NPs (10 
mg/kg b.wt.). The liver index was calculated using the following formula after the

promising anticancer agent with an attractive role in sorafenib targeting, which 
makes our method distinctive. It reduces the therapeutic dosage and consequently 
the side effects while performing better than bee venom as a conventional can￾cer treatment. In addition, it produced a noteworthy difference in the fold of 
expression in our investigated genes, DTL, DUSP1, NFKBIA, and SOCS2, which 
is strongly associated with the pathogenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma and 
offers a useful perspective on the course and outcome of HCC, supporting our 
hypothesis regarding the function of sorafenib in contrast to bee venom (54). (See

17.6. EV ALUATION OF THE IMMUNOGENICITY OF ECO-FRIENDLY 
γFE2O3@AG@CS NANOCOMPOSITE AS A PLATFORM FOR THE 
DISCOVERY AND SCREENING OF VACCINE ADJUVANTS
Nanomedicines function as foreign substances once they are delivered in vivo, poten￾tially stimulating, suppressing, or triggering the immune system. These immune system 
modifications brought on by NPs are, however, undesired in the bulk of applications of 
nanomedicine, including imaging (55, 56). In vitro, neither human monocyte-macro￾phages nor aortic endothelial cells exhibited an inflammatory response upon exposure 
to iron oxide nanoparticles. Conversely, oxidative stress may be brought on by high dos￾ages of iron oxide NPs. Human monocyte-derived DCs treated with PVA-coated SPION 
exhibited reduced antigen processing and CD4 (+) T cell activation capacity (57, 58).
By causing oxidative stress and inflammation, intranasal delivery of AgNPs rang￾ing in diameter from 52.2 to 23.64 nm has been demonstrated to enhance respiratory 
immune function. Oxidative stress was already present before AgNPs triggered alveolar 
macrophages to initiate phagocytosis by producing ROS and free radicals. The biolog￾ical processes of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages were thus interfered with. 
Increased cytokine and oxide secretion followed, promoting respiratory immune activity. 
The inconsistent outcomes may be explained by the different sizes of the NPs (59, 60).
Hu et  al. found that whereas negatively charged Fe2 3 O NPs promoted autoph￾agy, positively charged Fe2 3 O NPs increased DC cross-presentation (61). Engineered 
nanoparticles can be made to specifically engage with the immune system or to evade 
its recognition. Synthetic NPs have been utilized frequently to create novel immu￾notherapy methods. One sort of treatment that includes purposefully modifying the Future Perspectives 317
immune system is immunotherapy. The fact that immunotherapy has fewer adverse 
effects than prescription drugs is one of its most important advantages (62, 63).
An effective method for examining the macromolecular chemistry of biological 
materials such as cells and tissues is Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) imaging. 
Through the use of bidimensional detectors and Vis-IR microscopes, it delivers spatially 
resolved biochemical information. Owing to the abundance of spectrum data, multivar￾iate analysis offers a quick and reliable method for interpreting them by enabling the 
immediate identification of spectral groups (clusters) on the chemical maps (64, 65).
In this work, we employed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA) and 
FTIR imaging to examine the immune system’s submolecular interactions with engi￾neered nanoparticles (NPs) for further immunomodulatory goals.

The term “opsonin” was used by Wright and Douglas (1903) to refer to a substance 
or factors in serum that interact with particles to facilitate phagocytic cell digestion. 
These early IgM antibodies have a low affinity because they are produced before 
somatic hypermutation has occurred in B cells. IgG stimulates the complement sys￾tem in addition to effectively opsonizing viruses for phagocyte engulfment (66).
The amounts of IgG and IgM in the blood of the treated animals were measured 
using the Elisa assay. After 2 hours of γFe2O3@Ag@Cs NCs IP-injection of animals, 
Figure 17.14 shows a considerable increase in IgM and IgG concentrations, which are 
then followed by a decline at 6 hours and an increase for IgM at 24 hours, while IgG 
concentrations stay normal. The figures indicate.Future Perspectives 319
IgG increased four times compared to normal, although IgM increased only once, 
according to the statistics. An essential role of phagocytes, like macrophages, is 
particle removal. It is normal practice to utilize antibodies and other soluble innate 
immune proteins to opsonize biological material and enhance macrophage clearance. 
It is commonly known that macrophages may readily accept particles coated with 
IgG. Numerous recent investigations have demonstrated that natural IgM is capa￾ble of identifying the damaged-self in a range of tissues, including necrotic or late 
apoptotic cells. Most of these investigations concentrated on the impact of comple￾ment activation on IgM-mediated late apoptotic cell clearance. Antibody-dependent 
particle clearance is influenced by particle size. IgM is more effectively absorbed by 
smaller particles (1 mm) than by bigger particles (>1 mm). Apoptotic cells and the 
microparticles they produce are the targets of IgM.
Overall, the data point to a stimulatory effect on the immune system for the used 
core-shell nanoparticles (γFeO@Ag@CsNC) at the indicated dose (100 ug/mL). This 
effect is demonstrated by increased secretion of antibodies (IgG and IgM), lipid, 
nucleic acid, and protein syntheses after an immune organ-specific uptake time. 
After therapy, membrane permeability and signaling activity are synchronized by 
the cytokines IgG and IgM. These results may serve as a good indicator that the 
aforementioned nanocomposite is a promising option for immuno treatment and as 
an adjuvant in vaccinations. To validate the theory and use the nanocomposite as a 
vaccine adjuvant, more research is required (67).
