Nanochemistry is a subject that deals with the transformation of the materials when it moves from 
macro to micro to nanoscale. This resulted in a special phenomenon known as quantum size effects. 
This effect is responsible for imparting a new degree of freedom to the material, thus consequently 
leading to altogether new properties in the material. It involves bottom up approach where atoms 
stick to each other in a very regulated fashion and then stop or restrict the growth of nanoparticles 
beyond 100 nm. The miniaturization of materials from macro to nanoscale increases the surface to 
volume ratio. The atoms at the surface of the nanomaterial possess dangling bonds, thus increasing 
the surface energy. The surface effects are dominantly seen in nanoscale systems. The impurities or 
dopants decrease the surface energy and this phenomenal repercussion has a greater effect on fuel 
cells, batteries, catalysis as well as sensing. Further, surface functionalization and passivation and 
surface functionalization defects also lead to transformation of the properties of the nanomaterials. 
Hence, self-assembled nanostructures possess plethora of different applications depending upon 
the tunability and functionalization of the materials. This has been well explained in Chapter 1. 
In Chapter 2, the surface stabilization and functionalization of metal oxide semiconductors is well 
explained as they exorbitantly exhibit their role in gas sensing, LEDs, transistors and many more. 
Such metal oxide nanoparticles possess different physical, chemical, thermal, magnetic and optical 
properties that is well explained in Chapter 3. Such nanomaterials can be synthesized using physical, 
chemical or biological methods (Chapters 4, 5 and 6). Further, nanomaterials can be characterized 
using electron microscopy and SQUID (Chapters 7 and 8).
Chapter 9 explains the different analytical devices formulated from different kinds of 
nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. Such biosensing devices and lab￾on-a-chip systems exploit different techniques such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and 
optical and magnetic techniques for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Nanoparticles (NPs), 
especially, organic and inorganic, are used for drug delivery since they improve multiple drug 
limitations as reduced biodistribution, effectiveness, specificity, bioavailability, and unwanted side 
effects. These NPs can be designed for passive targeting by taking advantage of enhanced permeation 
and retention effect in the tumor microenvironment or for an active targeting by modifying their 
surface with different moieties for responding to endogenous or exogenous stimuli and guide them 
to the target location and diminish immunogenicity. This is well explained in Chapter 10. Moreover, 
several applications of nanotechnology, in particular the use of nanomaterials for prevention and 
treatments of diseases like cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases, includes the design 
of efficacious and safe nanomaterial immunotherapies for achieving new immunotherapeutic 
mechanisms such as molecular and cellular immunotherapies (Chapter 11). On the other hand, cell 
culture is one of the main milestones in biomedical science. However, tridimensional and dynamical 
culture models like organs-on-a-chip are promising in vitro models since they can mimic the 
cellular microenvironment and interactions while at the same time monitor the results with different 
biosensors and keep control of inlets and outlets (Chapter 12). 
Chapters 13 and 14 deal with the synthesis of carbon catalysts and graphene and their various 
applications in different areas such as hydrogen storage (Chapter 15) as well as electrochemical iv Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
water splitting (Chapter 16). Nanomaterials also have applications in the construction industry 
during the formulation of cementitious materials for the increment of tensile strength and durability 
of the building structures (Chapter 17). Last but not the least, Chapter 18 deals with the design of 
biomimetic devices that can play an important role in the development of brain-computer interface 
implants and cyborgs. The human-machine hybrid technologies derived from nanomaterials can 
provide service to human beings with its enhanced speed and strength.Contents

1. Introduction
Self-assembly has been related to nanostructures that are well controlled and tunable, and represent 
favorable ways for surface functionalization (Kühnle 2009). The process majorly involves somewhat 
less ordered to more ordered self-assembled nanoarchitectures with minimal energy requirement at 
final equilibrium configuration (Lombardo et al. 2020). The interplay of molecule-molecule along 
with molecule-substrate interactions having various molecular building blocks, surface chemistry, 
and the structure helps to govern molecular self-assembly when considering solid surfaces (Kühnle 
2009). Along with this, self-assembly technique has emerged while keeping the nanoparticles’ 
properties intact. Self-assembly can be defined as the process by which molecules or nanoparticles 
or any other component organize spontaneously through direct specific interactions (Grzelczak et al. 
2010). Just like a single nanoparticle displays unique properties, the assembly of such nanoparticles 
can have collective properties when present in bulk. The assembly of nanoparticles can even be used 
to enhance the related mechanical properties (Nie et al. 2010). 
Various approaches have been explored to design and develop versatile nanostructures with 
multifunctionality. Among them, self-assembling nanostructures have attracted researchers from 
diverse fields due to their distinct properties and multitude of applications. Self-assembly is a 
spontaneous bottom-up process involving specific interactions leading to the formation of nanohybrids 
(Patil et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2018). Self-assembly mainly involves either electrostatic forces, host￾guest molecular interactions, chemical bonding, non-covalent hydrophobic-hydrophobic or π–π 
interactions (Zhao et al. 2018, Ji et al. 2019, Li et al. 2012). These self-assembled nanomaterials 
can be broadly categorized into three types based on their composition and origin which include 
(1) organic (2) inorganic/hybrid and (3) soft nanohybrids (Nie et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2018). Organic￾derived nanostructures are mainly formed from polymers and small molecules, whereas inorganic 
nanostructures are usually composites and hybrids. Soft nanohybrids includes DNA and peptides. 
The self-assembly process is influenced by surrounding media as the crucial interactions between

the components occur at the interface because of the freedom of motions of components (Ariga 
et al. 2019).
The scope of the chapter is to summarize the materials forming self-assembly, their structure, 
and functionalization. Here, we have tried to capture the basic understanding of nanomaterial 
chemistry and related morphologies. We have also illustrated a few concepts of nanohybrids with 
their advantages and disadvantages. The fabrication and modulation of material for multimodal 
imaging and combined therapy have also been highlighted.
2. Organic self-assembly
The natural tendency of organic material to form diverse structures and functionalize themselves 
through utilizing self-assembly in an effective biological system has been gaining importance 
(Stupp et al. 2014). The organic nanomaterials consisting of carbon components are very versatile 
and offers control over chemical and morphological characteristics (Lombardo et al. 2020). In this 
section, we have described briefly the major organic molecules stated as polymer and lipid-based 
self-assembled systems. 
2.1 Polymeric self-assembly
Polymeric nanoparticle assembly can be formed by block copolymer with distinguishable 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements. Polymer materials offer a wide range of possible structures 
influenced by intermolecular interactions sufficient to drive the assembly formation (Rupar et al. 
2012). Polyelectrolytes with water-soluble macromolecules have a high charge density to produce 
a stern double electric layer as per Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory. This stern double￾layer electric layer serves to increase the electrostatic repulsion against the attractive van der Waal 
forces. Such sort of electrostatic repulsion and attraction behavior of polyelectrolytes-based micelles 
is pH-dependent and can also be stated as counterion dependent (Dou at al. 2003). A concept of 
hierarchically arranged self-assembly of an amphiphilic ABC miktoarm star terpolymer mediated by 
counterion was revealed by Hanisch et al. The conjugation was extended to explore the polycationic 
segment. Here, the presence of iodide/triiodide counterions played an important role in forming 
micro-compartmentalized particles containing fine structures with periodic lamellar morphology 
(Hanisch et al. 2013). Another aspect is redefining the final self-assembled structure which can’t 
be well predicted and control over final morphology becomes difficult. Ahead of this, research 
states core-shell micellar nanofiber structure formation with polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene 
glycol-block-poly(p-dioxanone) obtained as the final crystallizable core. The approach combined 
the anisotropic micellization process of the copolymer formation in water and further reassembling 
into fiber (Zhai et al. 2013). In combination with other molecules like those of biological origin, 
polymers can act as multivalent counterions for self-assembly and vice versa (Liu et al. 2010). In an 
example provided in Figure 1, the behavioral characteristic of polymer self-assembly can be easily 
correlated in different solvents. Likewise, monodispersed micelles of positively charged PEG￾block-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PEG-b-P4VP) in acidic solution self-assembled due to the presence 
of negatively charged circular plasmid DNA which acted as counterion (Zhang et al. 2014). The 
hierarchical structures of co-assembly of copolymeric micelles can be used for combined therapies 
with both therapeutic and diagnostic agent carrier systems. Liu et al. produced a multifunctional 
assembled structure for carrying theranostic agents. The carriers were synthesized by a process 
of co-assembly of anionic cylinders with poly(acrylamidoethylamine)-block-polystyrene cationic 
spherical micelles stating mix morphologies (Shrestha et al. 2012). Yet another common strategy of 
effective delivery by controlling particle size is by altering surface chemistry through hydrophilic 
polymer brush, further reducing the antibodies absorption and targeting specific cells (Champion 
et al. 2007). Self-Assembled Nanostructures 3

Merocyanine dimerization induced supramolecular cross-linking of micelle in water and reverse micelle formation in toluene 
(Matsumoto et al. 2019). (C) Strategy design of amphiphilic monomers and copolymers (Rajak et al. 2020).
Another form of material behavior supported by polymers is a hydrogel. They tend to retain 
water and swell to form 3D structures. Biocompatible, biodegradability and high moisture retaining 
capability help them to get distinguished as polymeric self-assembled hydrogels. Components like 
poly (lactic–glycolic acid) (PLGA) and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) have been reported for 
their biopolymeric nature (Vashist et al. 2013). Hydrogels can even be classified as thermoresponsive 
hydrogels like polymer of PEG–PLGA–PEG triblock and others including poly(ethylene glycol) and 
poly(L-lactic acid) as drug delivery agents (Lee et al. 2007, Jeong et al. 1997). Another example of 
self-assembled hydrogel formation is given in Figure 2. A very important requirement of biomedical 
translation of mouldable and injectable hydrogels is by finely tuning the mechanical properties 
of hydrogel-based systems. Polymer nanoparticle interaction arising as a result of self-assembled 
structure doesn’t require much complex synthetic approach. A report of a non-covalent interaction 
between the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose derivatives (HPMC-x) and core-shell nanoparticles 
have been reported. They showed reverse and transient interactions between nanoparticle and 
chain governing polymer-nanoparticle (NP) self-assembled hydrogel. Poly(ethylene glycol)-block￾poly(lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) NP could deliver both molecules of hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
nature by entrapping them into the gel (Appel et al. 2015).
Molecular self-assembly of polymers, which includes the abrupt formation of supramolecular 
aggregates and structure in different states, has also been keenly engineered. Due to dynamic 
chemical structure and the different binding sites, they can be said to be broadly classified depending 
on the combination as supramolecular engineered polymers which are built by small molecules, 
a mixture of small molecules and macromolecules, and those which have only macromolecules 
(Wang et al. 2014). Their unique characteristic has been simplicity in morphology, template ability, 4 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
functionalization, and responsiveness to be utilized for various biomedical applications (Zhuang 
et al. 2016). The directionality and spatial geometrical distribution in solvents like water due to 
hydrogen bonds provide highly ordered structures to get self-assembled ranging from lower to higher 
units (Okesola et al. 2009). Another technique that has recently advanced in playing a significant 
role in elucidating the mechanism linked to copolymer self-assembly of the micelle is through 
simulation (Akcora et al. 2009). Simulation is a theoretical analysis to gain detailed information on 
experimental studies. In self-assembly, it can be used to study behavioral characteristics and types of 
copolymer building blocks under different conditions (Zhang et al. 2017). Macromolecular structure 
prediction, electrostatic interactions, and understanding the charged nanoscale motifs can also be 
achieved by molecular simulation (Akcora et al. 2019). The dissipative particle dynamics simulation 
method deals in the study of core-core coupled self-assembly with anisotropic graft copolymer 
micelle and correlating for experimental data interpretations (Zhuang et al. 2016).
2.1.1 Diagnostics and bioimaging
Visual probes to recognize desired molecular pathways have been of importance and are getting 
explored in most research areas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical and nuclear imaging, 
all have shown potential in the biomedical field and a similar trend is with polymer-based probes 
(Wallyn et al. 2019). Polymer-based imaging probes provide advantages over small-molecules due 
to their integrity, stability, and reduced toxicity (Lu et al. 2007). Apart from this, higher target 
specificity, mainly while incorporating supramolecular engineered probes, have major advantages of 
facilitating both diagnosis and treatment. Optical imaging using fluorescence has been widely used 
when it comes to diagnosis and clinical studies. However, basic hurdles might include absorption, 
scattering of light, or autofluorescence (Licha et al. 2001). A research group reported supramolecular 
dot-shaped nanosize-based aggregates on bis(pyrene) derivatives for lysosome-directed imaging. 
The nano-aggregate represented good pH- and photo-stability with reduced toxicity in physiological 
conditions. It can be used as a better molecular candidate of fluorescence nanoprobes for live-cell 
imaging when targeting lysosomes (Wang et al. 2013). Like optical imaging, MRI and CT imaging 
Figure 2. (A) Polymer gelatin and pectin containing self-assembled hydrogel formation at reduced pH (Wu et al. 2015). 
(B) Self-assembly of chitosan hydrogel and its network (Gun et al. 2015).Self-Assembled Nanostructures 5
has also attained prominence recently. Non-ionizing radiation, an easy distinction of target, high 
spatial and soft-tissue resolution are some advantages of imaging through MRI (Knight et al. 2011). 
Sensitive supramolecular nuclear probes were designed by Wang et al., where supramolecular 
nanoparticles of controlled size assisted in microPET/CT imaging while achieving trafficking of the 
lymph node in vivo. Here, the size as the main characteristic modulated the activity of supramolecular 
nanoparticles as imaging agents (Wang et al. 2009).
2.1.2 Delivery system
Polymeric engineering for therapeutic purposes has escalated tremendously. Few benefits include fast 
and easy supramolecular precursor synthesis with good biocompatibility and responsiveness (Liechty 
et al. 2010). A wide variety of different units can also be incorporated to make it more functionalized 
through multiple building blocks. The manufacturing processes for designing the carrier system is 
complex enough that hinders the reproducibility and quality-control (Peer et al. 2007). Additionally, 
building blocks, either polymer or small molecules, have a diverse range of compositions and 
functionalities required for optics, magnetic and biomedicine, and more. Likewise, amphiphilic 
polymer with hydrophilic PEGylated compound encapsulated hydrophobic drug photosensitizers 
has been effective in demonstrating the self-assembly of polymeric nanomicelles (Tu et al. 2011). 
Various stimuli-responsive drug carriers with enhanced therapeutic efficacy can accomplish active 
targeting over conventional systems. Polymeric nanocarriers with pH, thermal, light, redox-, enzyme 
responsiveness have been studied for their drug delivery properties (Fleige et al. 2012). With 
covalent and non-covalent linkages, controlled assembly and disassembly can be easily achieved 
for drug delivery. For example, a triple responsive carrier system with a double hydrophilic block of 
supramolecular having copolymer micelle was synthesized by a research group. Thermal responsive 
Poly-N-Isopropylacrylamide and pH-responsive poly(dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate) formed the 
self supramolecular engineered polymers for carrying doxorubicin which is an anticancer drug. 
The release study stated control of drugs by pH, temperature, and additional competitive molecules 
in a gradient manner. Also, compared to micelle, it showed covalent linkage, and supramolecules 
exhibited a faster release profile (Loh et al. 2012).
2.2 Lipid-based self-assembly
Lipids show diversity in their geometry and the type of assembly formed upon coming in contact 
with water. Structurally, lipids have a hydrophobic head, which is mostly a fatty acyl chain and 
hydrophilic polar head and hence are categorized under amphiphilic molecules. In an aqueous 
environment, a compact or internalized part of lipid forms the hydrophobic core and the inner 
part covers a hydrophilic region. This phenomenon is energetically favorable and can be termed 
as underlying self-organized molecules when coming in contact with water (Tanford 1974). The 
geometrical parameter, size, shape, and possible interactions of lipid head or tail are particularly 
considerate for charged lipids. Likewise, in phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol, the head 
groups are distanced enough due to repulsive forces to create a stable structure (Petrache et al. 2004, 
Brown et al. 2015). Apart from this ion composition of an aqueous solution, temperature and pH may 
also change the lipids’ geometrical parameters to form lipid assembly (Kociurzynski et al. 2015). 
This causes solid-liquid phase transition where it may be referred to as chain melting transition 
and varies with different lipids’ composition. For example, glycolipids having sugar groups show 
more solid-phase transition temperature (Kociurzynski et al. 2015). This temperature and degree of 
packaging in the liquid phase are dependent on the degree and length of fatty acyl chain saturation. 
Lipids with lower value form low order bilayer phase and with high mobility known as liquid￾disordered phase (Van Meer et al. 2008). Cholesterol addition increases acyl chain in liquid disorder 
membranes (Veatch et al. 2005). Oppositely, bilayers formed by long-chain saturated lipids have 6 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
higher solid-like phase with low mobility and high order. As the order is high, they are referred to as 
liquid-ordered phase (Maxfield et al. 2005).
When dealing with drug delivery systems, designing biocompatible and biodegradable nano 
self-assembly systems is highly important and desirable (Farokhzad et al. 2006). Apart from the 
polymers described above, liposomes also form composite nanostructures acting as drug carrier 
in multifunctional plateforms (Torchilin et al. 2005). Liposomes are amphiphilic lipid molecular 
vesicles of self-assembled structure, in which the hydrophilic agent could be entrapped in the inner 
portion whereas the hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds in the liposomal membrane (Xie 
et al. 2012). As a famous delivery vehicle, liposomes with nanoparticles have higher encapsulation 
efficiency, demonstrate extended drug release profile and by carrying chemotherapeutic agents, they 
can be used to strategize nanomedicines (Sengupta et al. 2005).
3. Inorganic/hybrid self-assemblies
Self-assemblies can also be derived from inorganic as well as metallic materials, which may be 
composed of inorganic material alone or hybrids of inorganic and organic materials (Nei et al. 
2010, Sanchez et al. 2005, Rui Hitzky et al. 2003). They are recognized due to their unique optical, 
magnetic, and electronic properties (Li et al. 2010, Pandey et al. 2016). These properties significantly 
vary when these materials are brought down from bulk to nanoscale that finds promising clinical 
applicability. Besides, these properties are tunable and are dependent on the composition, size, 
shape, and surrounding solvent medium (Pandey et al. 2016, Scholes 2018, Sun et al. 2003, Jain et 
al. 2007, Wu et al. 2016). Hence, they are widely used for imaging, therapy, and imaging-guided 
therapy applications. Several major types of inorganic materials used to produce self-assembled 
structures include gold nanoparticles (NPs), silica NPs, iron oxide NPs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 
graphene, etc. However, these materials are used in conjunction with organic materials to form 
nanohybrids that provide the necessary interactions for their self-assembly.
Self-assembling gold nanoparticles with functionalized surfaces help in fluorescence sensing 
applications. They demonstrate tunable optical properties due to which they are used in different 
applications of sensing, photonics, catalysis, and biotherapy (Miao et al. 2018, Alex et al. 2015). 
Fu et al. studied self-assembled gold nanoparticles (SAGNPs) for photothermal applications. 
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified by dithiol was used as a crosslinking agent to form SAGNPs 
presented in Figure 3(A), (B). Results indicated that the nanohybrid uptake improved into cancer 
cells and glutathione (GSH) responsive bio-disintegration in the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced 
photothermal performance with enhanced therapeutic efficacy was reported (Fu et al. 2018).
Quesada et al. developed core-shell type nanohybrid material where the redox-responsive 
amorphous organosilica forms a thin shell (6–10 nm) over the surface of the PLGA nanoparticle 
core through self-assembly process (Quesada et al. 2013). Silica coating over the PLGA core 
imparts chemical inertness, porosity, and biocompatibility. The self-assembly was achieved through 
silsesquioxane and tetraethyl orthosilicate containing a disulfide bridge as shown in Figure 3(D). 
These organic disulfide bridges act as molecular gates that selectively get cleaved by reducing 
agents. Such redox-sensitive systems are widely used for slow and sustained delivery of hydrophobic 
drug molecules. Yang et al. designed core-shell structured self-assemblies of anisotropic rare-earth 
β-NaREF4 nanocrystals (NC). The self-assembly was driven by selective etching of NC using oleate 
anion (OA–
) and highly lattice mismatched driven epitaxial growth (Yang et al. 2019). Further, 
the nanohybrid surface was functionalized with N-(2-pyridinyl)benzoylacetamide (HPBA), a pH￾responsive ligand exhibiting great potential in optical encoding.
Nanostructures based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are extensively used in the field of 
biocatalysis, chemical sensors, hydrogen storage, and power storage (Abdalla et al. 2015, Quesdada 
et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2019, Ajayan et al. 2001). Li et al. fabricated six various inorganic-organic 
nanohybrids of metal/metal oxide nano building blocks on CNTs using self-assembly mentioned Self-Assembled Nanostructures 7
in Figure 3(C). In particular, TiO2
/CNTs nanocomposite when used as cathode demonstrated 
significantly improved electrochemical performance in Li-battery application (Li et al. 2007). Self￾assembly resulted in the nanostructures formation at large-scale synthesis with control over particle 
shape, concentration, and size.
Kabachi et al. reported self-assembled nanostructures formed by electrostatic interaction, utilizing 
the exfoliated MoS2
 nanoplates of negative charge and iron oxide nanoparticles’ (NPs) positive 
charge having two different sizes (Kabachii et al. 2013). Quaternized poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl 
metacrylate-costearyl metacrylate) (poly(DMAEMQ-co-SMA), an amphiphilic copolymer, was 
used to functionalize the hydrophobic surface of iron oxide NPs, resulting in improved solubility 
and imparting the positive charge for self-assembly formation with MoS2 nanoplates. Results 
indicated that more MoS2
 was needed to compensate for the charge as a larger fraction of copolymer 
was retained by larger NPs. Such nanostructures demonstrated high catalytic activity and find their 
application in the production of hydrogen using solar energy and removing the dangerous pollutants 
from wastewater. Zheng et al. reported self-assembled three-dimensional graphene nanohybrids 
demonstrating oxidase-like and intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. The one-pot solvothermal method 
was used for Fe3
O4
 and Pd nanoparticles’ in situ synthesis, which was present over the graphene 
(3DRGO_Fe3
O4
-Pd) (Zheng et al. 2015). Higher catalytic activity was noticed with 3DRGO_Fe3
O4
-
Pd Pd containing Fe3
O4
 nanoparticles due to the synergistic effect between them as compared 
with monometallic loaded nanohybrids. Further, the designed 3DRGO_Fe3
O4
-Pd nanohybrid 
demonstrated high affinity and catalytic efficiency towards substrate H2
O2
 due to which it was used 
for the colorimetric detection of urine glucose and GSH with high selectivity and sensitivity. In 
another experiment, Hussain et al. designed self-assembled core-shell nanohybrids between neutral 
hematite nanoparticles (HemNPs) and negatively charged carboxylated polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) 
through heteroaggregation (Hussain et al. 2020). The effect of HemNPs to PSNPize concentration 
ratio on the size of nanohybrids was studied. Results revealed that with concentration increase of

PSNPs, the size of nanohybrids gets reduced as the homoaggregation of HemNPs is prevented by 
abundant PSNPs that form the shell, whereas PSNPs’ increased size resulted in nanohybrids with the 
larger size. From the research ongoing for self-assembly to advance inorganic chemistry and related 
nanohybrids, it can be said to make a huge difference to science in the coming future.
4. Soft nanohybrids
Self-assembly can also be achieved in a solution without using any template or external interference. 
This type of assembly is favored by bonds having attractive forces such as hydrogen bond, covalent, 
electrostatic, or dipole-dipole interaction (Nie et al. 2010), while particles can also be assembled 
with the use of templates such as carbon nanotubes (Correa-Duarte et al. 2005), polymers (Zhang 
et al. 2006), viruses (Dujardin et al. 2003), or DNA molecules (Aldaye et al. 2008). Likewise, the 
templates are classified as hard or soft templates. Examples of the hard template can be carbon 
nanotubes or inorganic nanowires that are chemically functionalized. These hard templates 
offer a well-crafted structure but lack control over spacing between the deposited nanoparticles, 
whereas soft templates can be classified as proteins, DNA molecules, or viruses (Nie et al. 2010, 
Dujardin et al. 2003, Aldaye et al. 2008); these types of templates provide binding sites for 
nanoparticle attachment.
4.1 DNA nanocages
The emergence of nanotechnology and its contribution towards the discovery of novel materials 
in biological applications has widely impacted nanomedicine, of which DNA is versatile for the 
nanoscale structures’ self-assembly. The main features which make DNA a suitable nano-assembly 
are: DNA being double-helical structure has diameter of ~ 2 nm and helical pitch of ~ 3.4 to ~ 3.6 nm, 
and length of DNA molecule is ~ 50 nm which serves as a self-assembly rigid building block. The 
DNA base pairing (A:T and G:C) gives direction to the molecular self-assembly pathway. The single￾stranded overhangs connect duplexes providing a way for hierarchical assembly (Chandrasekaran 
et al. 2016). 
DNA nanocages serve functions like drug delivery, biosensing, and imaging. DNA-based 
drug delivery targets the tumor site restricting enzymatic degradation. The two known major DNA 
nanocages types are pure and hybrid DNA nanostructures with size ranging from 10–100 nm. Pure 
DNA nanostructures include DNA polyhedrons, nanoribbons, DNA origamis, and nanoflowers, 
whereas hybrid DNA nanostructures involve hybrid conjugates with DNA like DNA-inorganic 
nanoparticles, and DNA polymer, and DNA-lipid hybrids (Yang et al. 2020). Many DNA nanocages 
have been synthesized starting from DNA cubes (Zhang et al. 2009), hinged tetrahedron (Smith 
et al. 2011) as shown in Figure 4 (A), (B), (C).
DNA nanocarriers function as smart delivery devices for carrying molecular cargos. The 
conjugate formed by the interaction between inorganic NPs and DNA nanoparticles possesses 
properties intrinsic to both components. Encapsulation of gold NPs within polyhedral DNA 
nanocages has been shown in the following Figure 4 (D). This system ensured the controllable 
release of Au-NPs at the target site proving its potential application for cargo delivery (Zhang et al. 
2014). In one of the studies, an assembled antigen-DNA conjugate showed an antibody response 
that was long lasting against antigen without any reaction with the DNA-assembly.
4.2 Self-assembled peptides
All the 20 amino acids that make peptides are structurally similar but they differ in side groups. The 
arrangement of these amino acids is based on first-order structures (sequence length), second-order Self-Assembled Nanostructures 9

the tail-polyhedra driven by maximization of DNA hybridization between the single-stranded tails on DNA polyhedra and the 
DNA single strands immobilized on DNA-AuNPs. Reproduced with permission (Zhang et al. 2014).
structures (alpha/beta-helix or coiled-coil), and third-order structures (a geometric shape) (Li et al. 
2019). Peptide-based nanoparticles are emerging in drug therapy with the fact that peptides can be 
easily conjugated with other nanoparticles which can help them to rapidly be taken up by the targeting 
cells. Secondly, peptides are easier to synthesize, have better biocompatibility, bioavailability, and 
low immunogenicity (Li et al. 2020). Moreover, peptides self-assemble and arrange in the form of 
nanoparticles, nanofibers, or nanotubes due to their aggregation property (Wang et al. 2016). Some 
of the functional peptides have been summarized in Table 1.
Peptides can also ensemble through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, π–π, or 
electrostatic interactions. As presented in Figure 5, α-helix, β-sheets, and β-hairpin are the common 
secondary structures that form self-assembled nanofibers, and nanotubes through non-covalent 
bonding interactions (Wang et al. 2020, Chen et al. 2019). 
One of the reported self -assembled dipeptide Diphelnyalanine, Phe-Phe (FF) has been used 
for various nanohybrids. It is known as the amyloid-β polypeptide core motif to drive self-assembly 
in Alzheimer’s disease (Görbitz 2006). Among different types of peptide assemblies, “stimuli￾responsive” peptide nano-assemblies are more responsive as drug-delivery vehicles, as they show 10 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

In some studies, peptide-based hybrid nanostructures are proven to be useful in cancer therapy. 
In one such study, a peptide-hybrid nano-assembly was made by fabrication of polylactide (PLA) and 
short peptide sequence VVVVVVKK (V6K2). These were further conjugated with anticancer drugs 
doxorubicin and paclitaxel. The peptide-based nanoparticle conjugate demonstrated more toxicity 
to the cancer cells compared to free drug, proving PLA-V6K2 nano-assembly to be efficacious

5. Conclusion
The actual concept of self-assembled nanoarchitectures could be found in their organization and 
molecular interplay. As we move towards higher-order, the chances of structural disruption even 
broaden and can lead to the collapse of assembly. In such cases, the study of energy dissipation is of 
utmost importance. Another potential feature is a selection of nano self-assembly systems based on 
the application and carrying capacity. Circumstantial ambiguity lies in the assembly and similarly 
scaled nanostructure while constructing controlled functionality materials. To be concise, be it 
organic/inorganic/soft nanohybrids, the conceptual relation of geometry, chemical modification, 
charge, and synthesis strategy critically defines the spatio-temporal nano self-assembly and its later 
evolution.

Surface Stabilization and 
Functionalities of Nanostructures

1. Introduction
In the last 30 years, the development of novel technologies based on nanostructures has directed 
the efforts of the scientific community to unravel the new physicochemical properties of 
such nanostructures compared to macroscopic materials. Nanotechnology has proven that the 
development of nanostructures is based on the interconnection of different scientific disciplines 
such as physics, chemistry, medicine, or engineering, to name a few. Nevertheless, the scientific 
community currently faces the challenge of understanding the different phenomena at nanoscale 
(such as the stabilization and functionalization processes), which is directly linked to the rational 
design of materials for novel applications in different fields.
One of the most relevant materials nowadays are metal oxide semiconductors (MOx’s), which 
display a high versatility making them excellent candidates for their use in different applications 
such as gas sensors, optoelectronic materials, water splitting, biosensors platforms, smart materials, 
among others. Nevertheless, to achieve such versatility in MOx’s, the development of stabilization 
and functionalization protocols is of paramount relevance. 
This chapter describes several concepts related to the synthesis, characterization, stabilization, 
and functionalization of pertinent MOx’s thin films. Two types of thin film deposition techniques are 
mainly addressed: chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP). Different 
methods of stabilization and functionalization of surfaces are also brought into focus. Moreover, 
the development of new strategies to expand the palette of MOx’s nanostructures applications is 
discussed.
1.1 Nanomaterials
Nanomaterials are defined as objects in which at least one dimension is between 1 nm and 100 
nm (1 m = 1 × 10–9 nm). They can be in solid form (powders), liquid (colloidal suspensions), 
and thin films. Up to now, nanomaterials have been involved in numerous applications such 
as biotechnology, cosmetics, medicine, electronics, among others. This is due to the high

surface/volume ratio, conferring nanometric-scale materials with peculiar and novel properties such 
as chemical reactivity, mechanical resistance, enhanced magnetism, or conductivity. Nanomaterials 
are significantly different from those at the macroscopic scale (bulk size) and can be obtained, in 
general terms, using two different approaches: top-down (miniaturization) and bottom-up (growth) 
(see Figure 1).
In the top-down approach, the strategy is to reduce the size of the material by chemical or 
mechanical methods, for example, through focused ion beam techniques or milling. In contrast, 
in the bottom-up strategy, the growing of nanostructures is due to the agglomeration of atoms 
or molecules during the nucleoid formation followed by condensation growth using physical 
(Iii et al. 2015, Chichkov et al. 1996) or chemical methods (Costanzo et al. 2016) and kinetic 
synthesis (Vivien et al. 2019). 
According to their dimensions, nanomaterials are classified as zero-dimensional (0D), one￾dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D). The 0Ds have three 
dimensions in the sub-nanometric regime (quantum dots); in the 1Ds, one of their dimensions is 
outside the nanometric range, this classification includes nanotubes and nanowires; 2D materials 
possess two dimensions outside the nanometric range, such as thin films or plates. Finally, in 3D 
materials (also known as superlattices or supercrystals) (Pileni et al. 2014), self-assembly of very 
well organized nanoparticles gains relevance during the growth of the materials, which can be 
classified as heterogeneous growth (layer-by-layer deposition of nanoparticles due to evaporation 
of a good solvent) or homogeneous growth, which form colloidal crystals due to destabilization of 
a poor solvent (Boles et al. 2016) (see Figure 2).

1.2 Metal oxide semiconductors
Metal oxides (MOx) semiconductors combine an oxide anion with a cation of a single metal 
and display interesting optical, mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties derived from 
their characteristics of electronic charge transport, defects in the crystal lattice, and composition. 
According to classical band theory, the defects introduce discrete energy levels in the band of the 
material; the majority charge carriers (electrons or holes) are derived in n-type (NiO, CuO) or p-type 
(SnO2
, In2
O3
, WO3
) semiconductors. Based on their physical properties, MOx´s are classified as 
(a) non-transitions metal-oxides and (b) transition metal-oxides (Madhuri 2020). 
(a) Non-transition metal oxides: A large bandgap separates the filled valence band and empty 
conduction band. For example, MgO and SiO2
.18 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
(b) Transition metal oxides are formed by combining a metal transition and oxygen atoms, where 
d orbitals in the metal are partially filled; this characteristic confers them good thermal and 
electrical conductivity, moreover, transition metal oxides display multiple oxidation states 
(Ashrit 2017). Examples: ZnO, MnO, WO2 3 3
Currently, some of the most employed MOx are titanium dioxide (TiO2
), zinc oxide (ZnO), 
tungsten oxide (WO3
), tin dioxide (SnO2
), copper oxide (CuO), aluminum oxide (Al2
O3
), and 
molybdenum oxide (MoO3
), to name a few. Figure 3 depicts the evident growth in the number of 
publications for MOx in the last two decades.

2. Metal oxide semiconductor thin films
Generally, thin films are described as layers of a material deposited on a substrate; the thickness 
can be in the range of atomic layer to one micrometer. Fabrication of thin films involves 
bottom-up and top-down methods highly related to physical and chemical deposition techniques 
(Figure 4). The films exhibit different properties depending on the material, structure, thickness, and 
deposition conditions. Different characterization techniques are required to unravel the composition, 
morphology, and structure of thin films; some techniques are briefly described below (Kodigala 
2014):
a. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS): Analysis of the chemical composition in a sample 
through X-ray emitted by the atoms present in the sample. It is useful for materials composed of 
elements with atomic numbers higher than carbon.
b. X-ray diffraction (XRD): Provides information on the crystalline structure of the materials and 
crystallite size.
c. Ellipsometry: Useful technique to determine thin film thickness, growth, surface quality, and 
optical constant (Hilfiker 2011).
d. Atomic force microscopy (AFM): Employed to quantify roughness in the surface of a material 
and in the determination of hardness, electrical, and thermal properties (Tararam et al. 2017). 
e. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM): Useful technique to visualize structures and morphologies 
on the surface of a sample.

f. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS): It is employed to investigate the elemental and 
chemical information and the electronic state of the atoms of a certain material. 
g. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): Provide high-resolution images and quantitative and 
qualitative chemical information at resolutions below 1 nm. 
Thin films are employed in many research fields thanks to their optical, electrical, and physical 
properties. The growth of thin films can be achieved by different techniques such as sol-gel, 
ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP), sputtering, or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Every technique 
produces thin films with specific characteristics, whereby the chosen deposition route depends 
on the particular needs of the application. In this chapter, two different deposition procedures to 
fabricate MOx´sthin films, namely chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis 
(USP), will be reviewed. 
2.1 Chemical vapor deposition 
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) consists of the dissociation of a material (in solid or liquid phase) 
activated by heat, light, or plasma. The gas molecules are deposited onto a substrate leading to the 
growth of solid materials (Pierson 1999). The main advantages of this technique are the versatility 
for depositing a large variety of elements and compounds, purity of the materials obtained, 
high reproducibility, uniformity of the films, and a large area of deposit (Frey and Khan 2015). 
Disadvantages include the use of hazardous gases as precursors, and in some cases, requires highly 
sophisticated vacuum systems.
CVD systems can display different configurations according to the desired properties of the 
targeted material. In general, two kinds of CVD reactors are mainly used: hot-wall and cold-wall 
(Arjmandi-Tash et al. 2017). The first employs a furnace to heat the substrate; this guarantees 
temperature control, whereas in the second configuration the substrate is locally heated, thus 
having more control on the deposition rate. The specific characteristics of the synthesized materials 
and properties are mainly associated with experimental variables, such as precursor materials, 
atmosphere, temperature, substrate, or reactor type. According to the specific conditions of the 
process, different CVD variants have been developed and are displayed in Table 1.

and USP techniques.

2.2 Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis
Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) is one of the most widely used techniques for the deposition of thin 
films of different metal oxides’ nanostructures. Due to its versatility in the homogeneous coating 
of large deposition substrate areas and the modification of conditions (temperature, atmosphere, 
frequency, and intensity of ultrasound), the control of film´s morphology and thickness can be nicely 
adjusted. It is also an excellent alternative for upscaling thin films to an industrial level, reducing 
production costs compared to other methods in producing thin films (see Figure 5 for a schematic 
representation of this procedure). 
USP technique has also been reported as a method for synthesizing nanoscale materials in 
powders or particles, having excellent morphological control of nanostructures, and obtaining 
different uniform particle sizes. Suslick and collaborators reported the formation of nanostructured 
silica (Bang and Suslick 2010) and carbon (Skrabalak and Suslick 2007), among other materials 
by USP. Kundu et al. reported the synthesis of NiCo2
O4
 nanospheres with high electrochemical 
responses and employed them as anode materials in supercapacitors or as cathode materials for 
lithium-ion batteries (Kundu et al. 2018). Meanwhile, Bogovic and collaborators propose a 
possible model in forming nanoparticles synthesized by USP in their studies on the synthesis of 
Al2
O3
 nanospheres. This model suggests the formation of nano-objects by evaporation, drying, and 
calcination of smaller droplets of metal precursors within a solvent (Matula et al. 2013).
USP working principle mainly consists of three steps:
(1) Ultrasound: Its main role is the nebulization of precursors due to the effect of the formation of 
capillary waves (waves travel along with the interface between two fluids), generating small 
droplets (sizes average from 1 to 20 μm), and finer sphericity (Chatzikyriakou et al. 2017, Bang 
and Suslick 2010). Special care should be taken to avoid confusion with the ultrasound used

in sonochemistry, which induces chemical reactions due to the formation of implosive bubbles 
(acoustic cavitation) (Skrabalak and Suslick 2005, Bang and Suslick 2010).
(2) Spray: Once the micro-droplets have been generated during the nebulization of the precursor, 
they pass through a nozzle that spreads them uniformly and homogeneously on a selected 
substrate (polymer, paper, transparent conductive oxides, etc.). The spray must accomplish 
specific parameters for the control of morphology and thickness in the deposition of thin films.
(3) Pyrolysis: Finally, the substrate is heated (between 50ºC to 1000ºC) during the spreading of the 
micro-droplets of the precursor. The heating plays two different roles, allowing the evaporation 
of the solvent where the precursors are contained as organic or aqueous phases and removing 
the surfactant to have continuous films free of structural fractures. During the calcination, the 
growth processes of the mesostructured materials take place (Chatzikyriakou et al. 2017). 
The fabrication of metal oxides nanostructured thin films using USP has been employed 
to develop functional materials for different applications due to the diverse physico-chemical 
characteristics of nanostructures. With the development of optoelectronic devices in past years, 
several research groups have focused on the innovation of electrochromic materials using MOx, 
which can absorb ultraviolet (UV), near-infrared (NIR), and visible light. Chatzikyriakou et al.
reported the deposition of mesoporous WO3
 films on conductive SnO2
:F (FTO) substrates, obtaining 
high coloring efficiency due to UV irradiation (Chatzikyriakou et al. 2017). On the other hand, 
Milliron and co-workers reported the synthesis of tin plasmonic nanocrystals doped with indium 
oxides deposited on FTO conductive substrates, obtaining active electrochromic materials for near￾infrared radiation (1500 to 2000 nm) (Maho et al. 2020). The use of USP facilitates the low-cost 
production of thin films with high-quality materials. Fauzia and collaborators developed electrodes 
for UV radiation photodetectors with high sensitivity, responsivity, and detectability, by depositing 
zinc oxide (ZnO) film on In2
O3
:Sn (ITO) substrates, obtaining a film with irregular crystal size 
(~ 48 nm), as well as in morphologies, obtaining comparable results to those observed in highly 
studied electrodes for photodetectors based on noble metals (Au, Ag, Pt) (Putri et al. 2020). Other 
applications involving the fabrication of nanostructured MOx thin films using ultrasonic spray 
pyrolysis include the development of materials for hydrogen production through water splitting in 
solar energy conversion devices. Li and co-workers reported low photoelectrochemical efficiencies 
in water separation processes using BiVO4
 thin films on ITO substrates; however, by doping with 
WO3
 and conducting thin-film reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere, a high photoelectrochemical 
efficiency for hydrogen production in water splitting processes was obtained (Li et al. 2010). 
Table 2 depicts different possible applications of nanostructured metal oxide thin films obtained by 
USP technique.
In the first part of this section, we addressed USP operation principles, which consists of three 
steps: the formation of particles by ultrasound, the uniform deposition of the particles via spray 
spreading, and finally, the calcination of the materials at specific temperatures. However, other 
parameters should be considered for the deposition of thin films using this technique: 
(A) Solution flow rate
An essential factor to consider during the thin film deposition process since the flow rate controls 
the droplet size in the spray due to the amount of liquid deposited on the substrate (Neagu et al. 
2006). Zeggar et al. reported the optical variation of CuO thin films between 1.4 eV – 1.6 eV, where 
a high flow rate promoted the formation of small CuO crystals (Lamri Zeggar et al. 2015).
(B) Deposition rate on the substrate
This process can significantly influence different aspects during the deposition of metal oxides on 
substrates, such as the thin film thickness, the size of the deposited nanocrystals, the amount of 
deposited material, among others. Aoun and co-workers determined the effects caused at different 22 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
deposition rates of colloidal solutions on a substrate (between 10 and 35 ml) for the production of 
ZnO thin films, obtaining diverse structural, optical, and conductivity characteristics and electrical 
resistance due to the increase of deposited volumetric quantities of colloidal solution on a substrate. 
(Aoun et al. 2015).
(C) Distance between the nozzle and the substrate
The distance between the colloidal solution nozzle and the substrate (where the particles are 
deposited) is one of the most important parameters to take into account; distances between 
3 to 9 cm have been reported in literature, which can affect the distribution of the particles on the 
substrate surface. A smaller space favors the obtention of a thicker film by having a total coverage of 
the deposit on the substrate. On the other hand, depositing at a larger distance will result in a higher 
evaporation rate of the smaller droplets of the solution during transport to the substrate, resulting 
in more separated particles. It should be noted that the flow rate of the solution directly influences 
the distance between the nozzle and the substrate. Neagu et al. showed that the achievement of 
fracture-free zirconium oxide coatings is related to the distance between the nozzle and the substrate, 
obtaining a thin film free of fractures with a distance of 57 mm. Meanwhile, depositing at distances 
less than 40 mm, the films displayed structural fractures (Neagu et al. 2006). 
(D) Pyrolysis temperature 
It provides control of the solvent evaporation temperature of the solution droplets, the calcination of 
the surfactant, and the mesoporous or crystalline characteristics of the thin films. Oh et al. reported 
calcination effects on substrates of Co3
O4
, CuO, and NiO thin films, obtaining different shapes and 
sizes of crystals, correlating with the material´s electrochemical properties (Oh et al. 2007).
MOx semiconductor thin film fabrication requires certain conditions to facilitate their 
production without being affected by external or internal factors that may impact their structural or 
chemical properties. Several stabilization methods are carried out to generate high-quality thin films 
in different MOx materials. In the following section, we will revise certain stabilization parameters 
for the formation of MOx semiconductor thin films.
2.3 Stabilization
Some materials at the nanoscale tend to change their behavior or properties under different 
conditions. In this chapter, stabilization can be understood as the conservation of the material’s 
properties when exposed to determined external conditions, maintaining its optimal performance in 
the application for which it was designed. Many factors can cause oxidation, reduction, crystallinity

change, or physicochemical changes in the MOx properties. In this contribution, the emphasis is 
drawn to environmental conditions, temperature, chemical, and structural stability.
2.3.1 Environmental conditions
Oxygen has an essential role in forming MOx; many studies have been published to describe 
synthesis methods in controlled conditions where air or water vapor contributed and accelerated the 
reactions to produce MOx (Malwal and Packirisamy 2018). However, vapor water also can cause 
cracking, changes in the morphology, and instability in the MOx´s films (Zhang 2021, Saunders 
et al. 2008). Water vapor also reacts with the surface of MOx in two ways: chemical and physical 
absorption with MOx, resulting in variation of electrical properties. This behavior is useful in 
humidity sensors thanks to chemical adsorption that could generate OH groups and electrons related 
to the conduction band of MOx (Yan et al. 2021).
On the other hand, reactions between oxygen and metals can give origin to different oxides 
species. For example, in tungsten oxide, partial pressure and temperature induce a change 
of stoichiometry of the materials evidenced by color change: yellow to WO3
, blue-violet to 
WO2.9, reddish-violet to WO2.7, and brown to WO2
 (Lassner and Schubert 1999). Rinaldi et al. 
reported that more oxygen vacancies within the crystal resulted in darker materials (Figure 6) 
(Rinaldi et al. 2018).

 under different temperatures (Reprinted with permission from Rinaldi FG, 
Correlations between Reduction Degree and Catalytic Properties of WOx Nanoparticles (ACS Omega), 2018, 
3(8): 8963–8970).
2.3.2 Temperature 
Annealing treatments are mainly used to remove organic molecules and evaporate solvents in 
thin films; this process may also modify the crystallinity, crystallite size, defects, stoichiometry, 
morphology, and structure of MOx thin films. For example, the annealing of ZnO thin films at 
600ºC in O2
 induces changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic properties (Lim et al. 2021). 
In WO3
, the annealing treatment has been related to modifications in the morphology, or in the 
promotion of changes from amorphous to crystalline phase of TiO2
 thin films (RM et al. 2020). 
Temperature changes can also promote fractures in thin films, which are caused by dehydration 
or removal of organic compounds (Roselló-Márquez et al. 2020); for certain applications, it is of 
paramount importance to avoid this kind of damage in the films (such as in solar cells). One way 
to protect MOx thin films is by using thermal barrier coatings, which must be thermally stable, 
chemically inert, resistant to corrosion/oxidation, and adhesive to the substrate; in this context, rare 
earth metals, zirconates, or mullite coatings are mainly employed (Zazpe et al. 2017). 
On the other hand, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is employed to improve the material’s 
crystallinity by precisely controlling the heating and cooling of the materials. The heating rate is kept 
very high to minimize any effect of diffusion (RM et al. 2020); moreover, this technique allows the 
activation of doping elements in MOx, reducing morphology changes, and delaying crystallization. 24 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
2.3.3 Surfactants 
The use of surfactants is essential for stabilizing microdroplets during deposition processes in 
the production of thin films. Surfactants must have the ability to prevent agglomeration between 
particles, with a good dispersion between them due to surfactant-surfactant interactions (steric and 
electrostatic repulsions) and having excellent solvation with certain solvents. So when the solvent is 
evaporated, it avoids interaction between particles. Surfactants are involved in the USP calcination 
process for MOx thin film deposition, where the surfactant is promoted to be eliminated, increasing 
its critical concentration in the form of micelles on the surface of the microdroplets, controlling the 
growth of mesostructures (thin films), and varying the thickness, roughness, and porosity. Among 
the most commonly used surfactants for the production of thin films, we find polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) (Denayer et al. 2014), cationic surfactants (HTAB), gemini surfactants, anionic surfactants 
(NaC12H25SO4
) (Bertus et al. 2013), copolymers (L62) (Lai et al. 2005) and acetic acid (CH3
COOH) 
(García-Sánchez et al. 2010) .
In this section, we reviewed some of the essential points for stabilizing colloidal solutions for 
the deposition of thin films and several topics to be considered to enhance the physicochemical 
properties of the substrates. In the following sections, we will discuss certain strategies to conduct 
thin films’ functionalization.
2.4 Functionalization
Functionalization of nanostructures can be defined as expanding the material’s fundamental properties 
to add new functionalities, characteristics, or capabilities to obtain certain functions for a possible 
application. Functionalization can be conducted in several ways, such as chemical modification 
of the surface, or structural modification, to name a few. This chapter discusses different ways to 
expand MOx thin film properties using heterostructures and composites.
2.4.1 Heterostructures
Heterostructures are the union of two different materials; one of the main objectives is to develop 
new structures with improved and tunable physicochemical properties (Vattikuti 2018). The union 
between semiconductors must have electric equilibrium to generate a flow of charge carriers and align 
the Fermi levels of both materials, allowing electrons’ fluxes from higher energies to lower energy 
states and inducing the layer depletion, modifying the electrons’ flow and electronic properties (Zappa 
2018). Electronic properties and structural changes in the heterostructures depend on the properties 
of the materials combined during this process. The union between different semiconductors can be 
described as (a) random distribution (doping), (b) a base material and another on the surface, and 
(c) layer over layer. Some examples of heterostructures formed by two MOx have revealed the 
enhancement in different applications, such as TiO2
/AgO, and TiO2
/Ag2
O photocatalytic activity 
for degradation of organic pollutants; the junction p-n type semiconductors favored degradation 
of organic pollutants under ultraviolet and visible irradiation (Xu et al. 2021). In another example, 
WO3
-Pd demonstrated high efficiency to probe acetone and hydrogen in gas sensors (Chávez et al. 
2013). Another field that benefited from the development of heterostructures are Li-ion batteries, for 
instance, WO3
/ZnO heterostructured electrodes exhibited remarkable reversible discharge capacity, 
high rate performance, and excellent cycling stability (Tu et al. 2021). 
2.4.2 Composites
The development of composite materials can be described as the combination of two or more 
materials to promote a positive synergy between the properties of each material. A fundamental 
criterion of composite materials is their architecture, which allows a better efficiency in transporting Surface Stabilization and Functionalities of Nanostructures 25
ions, electrons, or molecular species (Kim et al. 2015). The most studied materials so far are 
transition metal oxide coatings, including niobium pentoxide (Nb2
O5
) and tantalum pentoxide 
(Ta2
O5
) which, due to their multifunctional properties, have been used in applications such as energy 
storage (Augustyn et al. 2013), photovoltaic materials (Le Viet et al. 2010), catalysis (Ziolek et al. 
2013), and chemical stability (Rani et al. 2014).
These materials (Nb2
O5
 and Ta2
O5
) display a dual behavior in their properties when assembled 
with WO3
; they can extend the electrochromic characteristics of tungsten oxides by blocking 
NIR radiation (Llordés et al. 2013), as well as extending the optical modulation coloration 
(Wang et al. 2016). Furthermore, both materials have anti-photochromic properties that may be 
present in amorphous WO3
 thin films. Different ways of depositing the aforementioned transition 
metal oxide coatings have been reported. For instance, Kim et al. reported the formation of WO3
composite thin films, which are responsive to visible light at different voltage loadings (Figure 7). 
This was achieved by spin coating niobium polyoxometalate oxides (POM) onto an amorphous 
WO3
 thin film, where the WO3
 mesopores were filled with POM (Kim et al. 2015).
Wang et al. reported the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit a Ta2
O5
 film on 
amorphous WO3
 thin films to fill the oxygen vacancies located in the crystal structure of WO3 
(Wang et al. 2016). By employing this approach, the modulation for the thickness of the thin films 
was achieved from 0 to 2.5 nm, depending on the required ALD cycles. Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterizations showed that 
Ta2
O5
 was completely and uniformly embedded in the tungsten oxide. Saez et al. reported that the 
pore size of the amorphous WO3
 thin films is an important factor in the penetration of transition 
metal oxide coatings, obtaining poor penetration of Nb2
O5
 and Ta2
O5
 by electrodeposition (Saez 
et al. 2020).

2.4.3 Substrates
This section will discuss the importance of substrates to achieve the fabrication of thin films of MOx 
with various properties, which are used in multiple technological applications or the innovation of 
semiconductor materials. For the development of smart materials, substrates are the essential part 
of the whole system, which must be transparent, electrically conductive, with high morphological 
uniformity, and high optoelectronic response. In general, these substrates are made of transparent 
conducting metal oxides (TCO), although other alternatives have been reported (Granqvist 2014). 
TCO substrates are highly doped thin films generally fabricated by CVD or sputtering methods 
depending on the type of targeted substrate. For instance, the fabrication of SnO2
:Sb (ATO), and 
ZnO:Al (AZO) substrates using USP deposition process has been reported (Lee and Park 2006, 
Marouf et al. 2017). Certain highly doped transparent oxide substrates are listed in Table 3. 
Maho et al. conducted a comparative study between ITO and IWO substrates used as substrates 
in the deposition of WO3
 thin films by USP. The results obtained showed significant differences in 
terms of morphology between the substrates; meanwhile, ITO substrate showed better resistance, 
mobility, and better redox reactivity in cyclic voltammetry characterizations; IWO substrates 
displayed a better coloration efficiency for electrochromic applications (Maho et al. 2017).

3. Applications
Throughout this chapter, we have revised in general terms the great versatility of the physicochemical 
properties that MOx can display, making them excellent material to be used in cutting-edge 
applications, as well as in the development of novel strategies to generate smart materials. In this 
section, we show some of the main application fields of MOx thin films. 
3.1 Gas sensor
Gas sensor technology consists of the real-time detection of gaseous compounds. The application 
extends to monitoring atmospheric pollution, explosive gases, even disease diagnosis. MOx are an 
important element in the development of the conductometric gas sensor. The main characteristic is 
the change of conductance of the MOx when exposed to certain gas. These changes are generated by Surface Stabilization and Functionalities of Nanostructures 27
the surface reaction kinetics and electron mobility derived from interactions between gas molecules 
and the MOx surface. 
MOx display different responses to a specific gas; for example, SnO2
 thin films deposited by 
sputtering were reported as a gas sensor for CO (Chemistry 1996). On the other hand, ZnO and WO3 
have been employed to detect acetone, and TiO2
 displays gas sensing responses to NO2
, O2
, CO2
, and 
NH3
 (Nunes et al. 2021). In order to improve the conductometric response in gas sensors, MOx are 
usually doped with certain metals such as Pd, Cr, or Cu.
3.2 Optoelectronic devices
Optoelectronic devices consist of electronic materials (usual semiconductors) that absorb different 
types of radiation between UV and IR regions, with a certain degree of control of the quantum 
mechanical effects of light (electron-hole photo-generation) (Adams and Barbante 2015). MOx 
semiconductor thin films have been among the most widely used materials in the development and 
innovation of optoelectronic devices. These include what is currently called smart materials, i.e., 
materials that can change their optical properties when irradiated with light. 
Currently, WO3
 has been one of the most studied transition MOx’s for the development of 
photochromic/electrochromic devices due to its wide variety of crystal structures, which contain 
natural cavities; it is an excellent candidate as a receptor for external cations, also called “tungsten 
bronze”. WO3
 is relevant material in developing intelligent windows due to its dual electrochromic/
photochromic properties and its electrochemical reversibility, its efficiency in color switching (Kim 
et al. 2015), and high coloration efficiency (Runnerstrom et al. 2014).
On the other hand, molybdenum oxide (MoO3
) has been studied to a lesser extent than tungsten 
oxide. However, it also shows excellent photochromic properties and incredible versatility in its 
perovskite-like crystal structure. Additional materials that have attracted attention due to their 
photochromic properties are titanium dioxide (TiO2
), vanadium oxide (V2
O5
), and niobium oxide 
(Nb2
O5
).
3.3 Photocatalysis
Photocatalysis is a process heavily employed to remove pollutants from water through photo￾induced reactions assisted by a photocatalyst; in this context, semiconductor MOx has displayed 
high efficiencies in the treatment of polluted industrial wastewater through photocatalytic processes. 
Several MOx including ZnO, TiO2
, Fe2
O3
, Cu2
O, and WO3
 have been utilized, TiO2
 being one of 
the most popular MOx due to its high photostability, chemically inert nature, and low cost. For 
instance, the degradation of methyl orange (Perillo and Rodríguez 2021), polystyrene nanoparticles 
from aqueous media (Domínguez-Jaimes et al. 2021), and rhodamine B (Dao et al. 2021) has been 
demonstrated using TiO2
. Moreover, the use of heterostructures such as Ag/ZnO has rendered 
excellent photocatalytic performances for the degradation of rhodamine B (Ha et al. 2021).
In a general way, this section describes some of the main applications of MOx thin films. 
Nevertheless, there are many other fields where MOx can be applied. Table 4 displays a summary 
of MOx thin films’ main applications.
4. Conclusions and future perspectives
This chapter focuses on a small part of the fascinating characteristics of transition metal oxide (MOx) 
thin films, covering certain synthetic procedures, namely chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and 
ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP), and several approaches to enhance their optoelectronic properties 
through surface stabilization and functionalization methodologies. Different stabilization conditions 
before, during, and after the deposition process of thin films with different MOx were revised. These 28 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
can ultimately affect the film´s final shape and morphology, avoiding defects in electronic properties, 
and obtaining fracture-free films due to the use of surfactants. Moreover, possible functionalization 
protocols involving the use of heterostructures and ligands were addressed, with the ultimate 
purpose of enhancing or conferring novel functionalities to MOx thin films. Finally, a summary of 
possible applications where MOx thin films are mainly used is presented. There is still a long way 
ahead to further explore and develop new strategies to stabilize and functionalize nanostructured 
materials; however, innovative studies have recently paved the way to achieve such goals. It is 
expected the scientific community will continue working on this topic, which will ultimately help in 
the development of emerging technologies to fulfill society’s near future necessities.

1. Introduction 
Nanoparticles are considered to be intermediate systems—smaller than bulk systems (which obey 
Newton’s laws of motion), and bigger than atoms or a simple molecule (which follow the principles 
of quantum mechanics). The study of small dimensional materials are of great interest to material 
scientists. These small objects’ typical size ranges from 1 to 100 nm. Nanotechnology is a broad 
and interdisciplinary area of research that is immensely contributing to the modern science and lead 
to unprecedented developments in almost every domain. Though the use of NPs has been reported 
long back, the scientific potentials and their quantum behaviors were introduced to the world by the 
famous talk from Richard Feynman in 1959 ‘There’s plenty of room at the bottom’.
Though the nano-term was coined by Norio Taniguchi in the year 1974, such systems were 
already being exploited in all our regular activities. In the 4th century AD, glasses and cups were 
painted with metal-based paints. Daniel and Astruc have summarized the use of soluble gold from 
ancient times to the Middle Ages (Daniel and Astruc 2004). Earlier, in and around 4th century BC, 
soluble gold sols were used in different manufacturing units in Egypt and China (Gao 2014). In the 
Middle Ages, stained glass windows were seen in many churches, creating impressive artistry. The 
artisans who were themselves not professional experts were oblivious to nanotechnology but the 
colorful paintings out of the metal sols were quite fascinating to be seen. Hence, the whole world 
was already using this technology before the actual coining of the term nano. Academically, these 
transition metal nanoparticles (MNPs) were explored only in the 20th century. In the seventeenth 
century, gold sols were exploited to treat different diseases such as epilepsy, tumors, and other 
venereal diseases (Dykman and Bogatyrev 1997). Later, in 1857, Michael Faraday reduced the

aqueous solution of gold chloride, thus synthesizing gold colloid thin films and study their optical 
properties that could find reversible color changes when compression was applied on the material 
(Gao 2014). 
In 1908, Gustav Mie explained about the optical properties of the gold sols. This led to the 
study and description of the plasmonic as well as excitonic properties of different metallic as well 
as semi-conductor nanoparticles. The research community tried to understand the fundamentals of 
the nanoparticles based on their different sizes and shapes. They were also involved in synthesis of 
the particles using different methods, purification and post-synthetic modifications for plethora of 
applications. The nanomaterials were characterized and studied using different simulation models. 
Nanomaterials exhibit many compelling properties mainly due to two physical effects. First, the 
quantum discrete electronic states, which influences their optics, magnetic and electrical properties. 
Second, the high surface to volume ratio that enhances their chemical reactivity, thermal and 
mechanical properties, etc. 
Various ways of preparing and engineering nanoparticles were classified into two main 
approaches, viz., top-down and bottom-up. In the top-down approach, the starting materials are 
in bulk or macro-sized form, and size-reduction down to nanomaterials follows various physical 
and/or chemical techniques, whereas in a bottom-up approach, the fundamental particles such as 
atoms and molecules are bounded together following a so-called self-assembly technique. Top￾down approaches consist of physical methods such as lithography, milling, attrition, etc. These 
methods use either light, electrons or electrostatic forces for the formation of these nanostructures, 
the only problem being that metallic nanoparticles synthesized through these methods may present 
undesired imperfections. Bottom-up approaches are considered more precise strategies, different 
Figure 1. Top-down and Bottom-up approach.Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 35
methods include co-precipitation, sol-gel, microemulsions, etc. The bottom-up approach is a far 
more controlled system in which the precursors form highly specific structures such as rods, wires, 
spheres, flakes, etc. 
2. Properties 
2.1 Physical (Structural) properties (dimensions and shapes)
Nanoscale materials behave in different ways in comparison to bulk materials. These special 
properties are not only confined to different chemical behavior, but to morphological special 
arrangements with unique and tunable physical and structural properties, mainly related to surface 
effects. Surface effects are seen (in comparison with bulk) that have less stabilized surface atoms. 
In small particles, the larger portion of the atoms are on the surface and the average binding energy 
per atom is also very high (Roduner 2006). The surface-to-volume ratio changes with size reduction, 
and hence the phase transition temperatures vary (Roduner 2006). Due to large surface area of the 
material, thermal properties are enhanced due to the occurrence of heat transfers at the surface, and 
mechanical properties such as strain and elasticity are deemed tunable (Saleh 2020). Thus, physical 
properties are dependent on conditions such as cristallinity, geometry and surface of the material 
(Guerra et al. 2019). 
Quantum size effects are also introduced in these nano-systems, as delocalized electrons can be 
described as “particles in a box”, for which its electronic behavior (densities of state, energies, etc.) 
depends on the size of the box (rather than its dimensionality). Therefore, its impact is more related 
to chemical properties such as catalytic activity, electrical properties and magnetic properties due to 
the importance of electrons and orbitals influenced by the size effects (Roduner 2006).
The numerous applications given to nanomaterials are supported by their special characteristics; 
thus, study for enhancing and engineering of these materials is hugely important (Baer et al. 2008). 
The analysis and understanding of nano-materials requires unique and specific approaches. Molecular 
dynamics simulations and theory are used to comprehend and predict thermal and mechanical 
properties in macro and nano-scales (Mohammadi et al. 2020). Thermal analysis techniques are 
widely used for evaluating a nanomaterial’s change of mass, heat flux, change of temperature, 
mechanical stability with thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal 
analysis and thermomechanical analysis, respectively (Seifi et al. 2020). Finally, microscope-assisted 
techniques and theories (i.e., nanoindentation) can help evaluate further mechanical information 
(elasticity, flexibility) (Reghunadhan et al. 2018) . 
According to the classification of dimensionality and shape of nanomaterials (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D) 
(Sudha et al. 2018), physical properties could be discussed with certain precision. 
2.2 Mechanical properties
Mechanical properties of nanomaterials typically depend upon their response, under external stress 
or load (brittleness, strength, plasticity, toughness, elasticity, etc.). Information on the specific 
conditions for engineering a material’s strength are vital to certain applications. The nature (chemical 
properties) and preparation (synthesis) are relevant; however, conditions such as grain size, and 
grain boundary structure have been deemed quintessential to the tunability of mechanical properties 
(Wu et al. 2020).
Flexibility as a mechanical property is intrinsically related to a bending modulus which 
indicates bending resistance (Teng et al. 2019), parallel to the Young modulus which characterizes 
a material’s elasticity (deformation resistance) (Callister and Rethwisch 2011). These properties are 
layer and thickness dependent; therefore, plate-like (2D) nanomaterials are studied, i.e., Young’s 
Modulus will decrease with less than 10 layers, and approach the bulk material constant beyond 36 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
20 layers (Sun and Zhang 2003). Layer formation capacity of a nanomaterial is closely related 
to these properties; thus, stacked monolayered morphology is desired with adequate interlayer 
distance for functionalization of the material (i.e., ion/electron conductivity) while ensuring uniform 
distribution without sacrificing the material’s stability (Zhu et al. 2018a). For nanotubes, Young’s 
modulus decreases as tube diameter increases (Xiao and Hou 2006), and even these can form 
multiwalled systems mimicking 2D materials for enhanced mechanical properties (Tao et al. 2015). 
2D material arrangements are desired for their flexibility (Teng et al. 2019). Nanosheets have 
been found to provide mechanical stability as flexible building blocks (Li et al. 2013). Their large 
aspect ratio (106
) in comparison with length to thickness, low surface roughness, and even properties 
such as noncovalent adhesion greatly enhance mechanical stability of these materials. Surprisingly, 
the mechanical stability of nanosheets decreases as thickness is increased (Fujie et al. 2009).
Some of these layered materials (graphene, h-BN, Zr phosphonate, MoS2
, etc.) show low 
coefficient friction, which translates into solid-state lubrication. Sliding happens within the layers 
due to weak interlayer interaction (Van der Waals interactions); therefore, lubricant-substrate 
interactions may affect the expected behavior (stick-slip and wear) (Spear et al. 2015). Addition 
to oils in order to obtain 2D nanomaterial based lubricant additives is also explored. Furthermore, 
stability takes another meaning as these materials have to be tested under extreme conditions (high 
temperature, high relative motion speed, high vacuum and high pressure), also securing fluid related 
parameters such as dispersion, in-oil stability, viscosity, etc. (Xiao and Liu 2017). 
Hardness and plasticity are also intrinsically related to crystallinity and phase of the material. 
However, structure and dimensionality can also provide answers towards further improving these 
characteristics. High-melting point compounds (carbides, nitrides and borides) with 20–35 GPa 
can be turned to super hard materials with an adequate transition to a nanostructured state 
(Guo et al. 2013).
In 2D nanomaterials, hardness increases with thickness reduction, while avoiding brittle states 
(dislocation and crack propagation) (Andrievski 2009). Nanocrystalline metals (Ni- and Co- based) 
exhibit great hardness-strength relationship and can be used for conventional coarse-grained metals 
and alloys (Brooks et al. 2008).

2.3 Thermal properties
Thermal applications require the consideration of certain parameters such as thermal 
conductivity, thermal expansion, thermal stability, etc. Nanomaterials’ efficient appliance on 
insulation, comfort, cooling and energy conversion require previous knowledge and prediction 
capabilities on heat exchange dynamics and thermal effects and its relation to nanostructuring 
(Volz 2009).
Thermal conductivity measures a material’s capacity to conduct heat (Bird et al. 2007). In a 
macroscopic system, contribution to this property is deemed by phonon modes with wavelength 
equal or greater than its macroscopic length scale (using molecular dynamics based on the 
Boltzmann equation). However, due to anharmonicity in the interaction potential of nanoscopic 
materials, thermal conductivity is affected. The increase in this property has to do with phonon￾phonon scattering reduction as size is decreased (Che et al. 2000). Two-dimensional (2D) structured 
layered nanomaterials have been studied for this thermal conductivity increase (i.e., 2D-BN 
nanosheets with 400 W/mK in plane) related to the decrease in thickness (Guerra et al. 2019). 
Addition of nanoparticles to a base-fluid (nano-fluids) grants enhanced thermal conductivity with 
correlation to increase in volume fraction, size change, and aspect ratio (i.e., nanorod > nanorhombic 
> nanosphere, nanocylinder > nanosphere, etc.) (Li 2013, Afrand 2017, Yang et al. 2019).
Thermal expansion coefficient indicates a material’s response to temperature in terms of its 
shape and size (Tipler and Mosca 2003). For nanomaterials, thermal expansion coefficient increases 
when grain size decreases. Considering surface effects, based on thermodynamical relations, an 
equation can be used to effectively evaluate this parameter as size varies, and therefore accurately 
predict expansion behavior (V/V0
) as temperature changes (shown in Eq. n and n+1) (Singh and 
Singh 2015). Mechanical stability is also closely related to the thermal expansion coefficient, i.e., 
nanomaterial addition for alloy reinforcement (WS2
 inorganic tubes) improve hardness, tensile 
strength, etc. (Huang et al. 2018).

Heat capacity is a thermodynamic property, which describes the quantity of heat supplied to a 
given mass so that it produces a unit change in the temperature. Thus, specific heat derives from this 
property taking into account heat capacity per mass (Tari 2003). Parallel to thermal conductivity, 
specific heat capacity is only influenced by phonon vibrations, with Debye and Einstein models 
used for analysis as they take into account vibration modes of inner and surface atoms. This value 38 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
is apparently higher for cubic and thin particle shapes. Moreover, in terms of size, for nanoparticles 
larger than 10 nm, the specific heat capacity decreases concerning the nanoparticle diameter due 
to the quantum size effect. However, at smaller sizes, heat capacity will increase due to quantum 
size effects (Wang et al. 2006). Effect is also widely harnessed on nanofluids (water-based Al2
O3 
(Zhou and Ni 2008), CuO (Zhou et al. 2010)). Finally, thermal stability, referring to melting point 
and other phase transitions, vary as well. Melting point decreases as dimensionality and size 
decreases (surface/volume ratio increase) (Jiang et al. 2003) due to lower stabilization of surface 
atoms (Roduner 2006). Through various approximations and models, other transitions such as glass 
transition of polymers can be better understood for designing thermally stable materials (Zhang et 
al. 2018). Corrosion and wear resistance require testing in order to obtain high-temperature stable 
materials that can withstand long-term exposure to aggressive environments (Andrievski 2014). 
It is important to mention that more thermodynamic (rather than thermal) properties also vary in 
nanomaterials. Physiochemical approximations to nanoscale entropies, enthalpies, free energies, 
etc., change with size, dimensionality and composition, which can also address endless properties 
further (Yang and Mai 2014).
2.4 Chemical properties (catalytic) 
Inorganic nanocatalysts have received plenty of attention during the last three decades due to 
their interesting physicochemical properties: high surface area, active sites, better selectivity, high 
chemical stability, and moderate ease to operate on an industrial scale. They can be applied in 
energy and environmental applications (oxidation, reduction, pure hydrogen production, fuel cells, 
etc.). Similarly, these materials can be used in autocatalysis for air cleaning, water purification; and 
sensors, for detection of harmful or combustible gases or substances in solution, etc.
The exploitation of MNPs has begun since ascertaining the novel catalytic activity of Au 
nanomaterials in low-temperature CO (carbon monoxide) oxidation (Haruta et al. 1987). Later, 
in 1941, polymer-protected Pd and Pt nanoparticles for hydrogenation applications were among 
the earlier reports in the nanocatalysis field (Rampino and Nord 1941). However, it took a long 
time to focalize the catalysis field on nano and sub-nanostructures. In general, nanoparticles’ 
catalytic properties are enormously dependent on parameters such as size, shape, composition, 
and morphology. Noble nanoparticles have an extra advantage in photocatalysis applications due 
to their apparent natural surface plasmonic properties. On the other hand, SCs (semiconductors) 
and insulator nanostructures (transition metal oxides, borides, sulfides, phosphates, carbides, etc.) 
present some advantages: selectivity, reactivity, and chemical stability as both photocatalysts and 
electrocatalysts. 
2.4.1 Noble metal catalysts
The plasmonic excitation of noble metal nanoparticles makes them appropriate for various catalytic 
processes. Noble NPs are highly utilized in electrochemical catalysis and photocatalysis so far due 
to their LSPR, pairing light flux to the electronic conduction of MNPs, with facile preparation, 
chemical stability, and high catalytic activities (Wang et al. 2014, Pradeep and Anshup 2009). 
The catalytic activity of Au nanostructures has received significant attention for CO oxidation, 
purification of hydrogen supplies for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, and chemical 
processing (McEwan et al. 2010). Approximately 5 nm-sized Au particles have exhibited excellent 
catalytic properties in many reactions, such as partial oxidation of hydrocarbons (HCs), water–gas 
shift reactions, and NOx
 reduction (Thompson 2007). Similarly, the studies on CO oxidation on 
supported Au NPs show that the smaller the size (diameter < 5 nm), the greater activity on various 
MO (metal oxide) supports. At ambient conditions, tiny gold nanoparticles (2–4 nm in diameter) Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 39
have largely increased CO oxidation rate by a hundred-fold, in comparison with gold NPs with 
diameters ranging from 20–40 nm (Ertl 2002). 
The transition regime where the intermediate sized (between 2.3 and 1.7 nm) gold nanoparticles 
exhibit both metallic and molecular behavior demonstrated excellent activity in the oxidation of 
both CO and alcohols (Zhou et al. 2016). Pt nanoparticle’s size effect compared between ~ 30 nm 
and 1−5 nm, tested for specific electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus evidencing 
high efficiencies by sub-nanometric size particles (von Weber and Anderson 2016). Nowadays, 
sub-nanoparticles of a few dozens of metal atoms (~ 1 nm) have proven highly active in catalytic 
processes, thanks to modern techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration 
corrected electron microscopies. 
Some supports can also act synergistically with nanoparticles and enhance catalytic performance. 
For instance, N-doped carbon supports were outperformed as compared to non-doped carbon 
supports (Kornienko et al. 2018). Ultra-small (below 2 nm-sized) noble MNPs (Au, Pd, and Pt) 
highly dispersed on Ni-doped carbon supports have shown extraordinary electrocatalytic activities 
in the methane oxidation reaction (Liu et al. 2016).
Though particle size is very critical for the reactivity of the nanoparticles, the particle shape 
counts as well by influencing surface atomic arrangement and exposed facets, active sites, adsorption 
energies, and reactivity to specific molecules (Gu et al. 2012). Recently, gold particles’ activity 
with similar size distributions (~ 3 nm) was studied using different MO as supports (TiO2
, Fe2
O3
, 
Al2
O3
, MgAl2
O4
, SiO2
). The measured CO oxidation rates for different supports were assigned to the 
disparities in Au particle shape and their exposed facets on the various oxide supports. The catalytic 
performance of gold particles supported on Al2
O3
, are more significant than gold particles supported 
on reducible oxides (TiO2
, Fe2
O3
) (Lopez 2004). For instance, da Silva et al. experimentally 
proved that Pd NPs exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity on exposure of {100} surface facets 
in comparison to {111} facets, leading to highest current density, thus causing electrooxidation of 
formic acid (da Silva et al. 2016). 
Likewise, specific multi-metallic nanomaterials can enhance the catalytic performances in 
comparison to their monometallic counterparts. The compositional variations in multimetallic 
nanomaterials directly affect their constituents’ electronic states. As a consequence, it affects their 
adsorption energies and catalytic reactivities (Li et al. 2018a). For example, Cux
Pd1–x bimetallic 
nanocubes (with 20 at% of Cu) showed the best electrocatalytic activity leading to the formic acid 
oxidation, which can be compared with pure platinum nanocubes of similar sizes (Xu et al. 2010). 
However, LSPR effect of noble metal NPs can also utilize co-catalysts to improve the performance 
of SC photocatalysts. Several oxide-based SCs (TiO2
, Bi2
O3
 Fe2
O3
, CeO2
, ZnO, etc.), and chloride 
and bromide based SCs (AgCl, AgBr) have been explored and studied in detail. A Schottky junction 
is formed when the metallic nanoparticles are in contact with SCs, thus stimulating fast charge 
transportation and suppressing charge carrier recombination. This plasmonic effect of NPs (LSPR) 
contributes significantly to photocatalytic activity (Sarina et al. 2013). 
Noble metal NPs deposited on insulator supports (Al2
O3
, ZrO2
, SiO2
, zeolite, etc.) have 
significantly wider bandgaps where photoexcitation is very limited and not possible under UV light. 
In this case, noble metal nanoparticles that possess excited electrons due to LSPR react with the 
reactants and then transform sunlight to chemical energy using photon-activated photocatalytic 
reaction.
Reasons for the significant photocatalytic activity of noble nanostructures are:
• LSPR of metal NPs acts as antennae to enhance a broad spectral range of UV-Vis light 
absorption.
• LSPR absorption on the metal cluster surfaces excites electron-hole pairs in the depletion 
region, which can then activate the surrounded molecules for the desired chemical reactions. 40 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
• LSPR polarized the metallic nanoclusters, thus generating electrons and holes on the surface of 
the metals. These electrons in turn augmented the redox reaction rate as well as mass transfer 
rates too. 
• Plasmonic enhancement of the electric field near metallic NPs surface increases the density of 
the available conduction electrons much higher than that of any SC’s surface.
A majority of photocatalysts are studied in their powder or mobile form to benefit their large 
surface area, and simplicity of operation. However, it is not easy to retrieve them entirely from the 
system and may require expensive filtration techniques. Moreover, many mobile nanocatalysts are 
toxic and difficult to handle in large-scale industrial applications. Therefore, to avoid such issues, 
recent photocatalysis research focuses on supported/immobile photocatalyst, thus compromising 
their surface area. 
Intrinsic catalytic activity depends on the active sites of catalysts in their electrode form, but 
their conductivity plays an equally critical role. Graphene and its derivatives are good examples, 
having high conductivity and good chemical stability, and are suitable to combine with metal or SC 
nanomaterials to form composite electrocatalysts with further improved activity and stability (Yang 
et al. 2021). 
Kwak et al. reported Au clusters combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in the form 
of nanocomposites. In the redox process, Au/rGO composites show a significant enhancement of 
current output and potential difference (13.4 μA and 127 mV at the oxidation peak) compared with 
that of Au clusters (4.5 μA and 60 mV). Both of these values indicate that the electron transfer 
process is enhanced by combining Au25 with rGO (Kwak et al. 2016). 
Noble metals have been extensively studied; however, their high cost limits their use in practical 
and industrial applications. Consequently, it is necessary to find an alternative where non-noble 
metals such as MOs, borides, carbides, nitrides and sulfides, etc., have been widely investigated. 
2.4.2 Catalytic properties of transition metal oxides
Metal oxides (TiO2
, Bi2
O3
, Fe2
O3
, CeO2
, ZnO, etc.) are earth-abundant and more promising catalysts, 
and cheaper alternatives than noble metal nanostructures. Moreover, they have been exploited in 
various electrochemical reactions due to their intrinsic oxidation stability, high-density material 
defects, and oxygen vacancies, which can benefit catalytic activity.
Similarly, transition MO nanoparticles have been also tested on various supports. Graphene 
oxide-supported MO nanoparticles exhibited better charge transfer, and synergistic effects in overall 
catalytic activity, some of them being able to be arranged as one-dimensional (1D) structures such 
as nanowires, belts, whiskers, and ribbons in order to enhance charge transfer. For instance, SnO2 
nanofiber’s geometry improves electron transportation by shortening the ions diffusion length and 
enlarging electrolyte-electrode contact, resulting in high current density. 
Transition metal boride (TMB)-based materials (FeB2, Co2B, NixB, etc.) are considered to 
be efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction 
(OER) (Jiang and Lu 2020). Similarly, transition metal carbide and nitride (MCN) nanomaterials 
are also considered to be efficient electrocatalysts, which is attributed to their fast electron transport, 
more than enough active sites, and high available surface area. Most MCN catalysts have either a 
3D mesoporous structure or ultrathin nanosheet structure, offering highly active site exposure. The 
strong nano-interface between different domains can promote the formation of excess active sites 
(Jin et al. 2019). Benefited from this strategy, MCN catalytic activity has been broadly employed in 
various electrocatalytic reactions such as HER, OER, ORR, CO2RR, etc. 
In addition, a more significant density of active sites can also be found in metal sulfide and 
phosphide nanostructures. For instance, metal-phosphide (Ni2P, Co2P) based nano-catalysts can 
enhance the intrinsically electrocatalytic activity with their natural high electronegativity behaving 
as hydrogen transporters in HER. In metal sulfides, MoS2 and WS2 are the most suitable HER Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 41
electrocatalysts due to their high performance originating from their available surface sites. S-sites 
behave as active sites, and their S-vacancies can also improve the electrocatalytic HER performances 
through their H2O association and disassociation process. 
In catalysis, a prolific research has been carried out on the supports which hold the transition 
metal ion catalysts, especially focused on reducing their size down to sub nanometer scale; for 
example, host ceramic matrices like zeolites, micro structured silica, alumina and other oxides 
(Cejka et al. 2017). On the other side, carbon based supports with different dimensional materials￾1D, 2D and 3D-such as nanotubes, graphene derivatives and metal organic frame works (MOFs) 
as novel catalyst supports have gotten great attention from the catalysis community (Furukawa 
et al. 2013). It is noteworthy to mention that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are also applied 
for various electrocatalytic applications. Their reticular synthesis and careful selection allow strong 
bonding between organic and inorganic domains, resulting in high-grade MOF crystals. These 
diverse characteristics and MOFs’ interior chemical tuning flexibility make them versatile for many 
catalytic applications such as gas separation, detection, gas storage, synthetic fuel, etc.
2.5 Optical properties 
Bulk metals are well known for being good light reflectors due to their high density of charged 
electrons. When the conductive metal size shrinks down to the nanoscale, like sub-wavelength 
of incident electromagnetic radiation, the small volume of electrons constrained within the 
nanostructures indeed absorbs the light and leads to plasmonic effects. That is why when a light 
shine on metallic nanoparticles, they illuminate in beautiful lustrous colors due to a plasmonic 
resonance effect. In Middle Age Europe, the ultrafine gold and copper metal particles were utilized 
by incorporating in the glass to decorate the gothic church windows and artisanal pottery work 
(Hunt 1976). 
The earliest report on the SP (surface plasmon) polaritons was made in 1902 (Wood 1902). Later, 
Lord Rayleigh interpreted these optical phenomena, and a few years later, Fano consolidated these 
anomalies with electromagnetic surface waves on selected metallic grating under light illumination 
(‘On the dynamical theory of gratings’, 1907) (Fano 1941). In 1950s, the consecutive work of 
Ritchie, and Powell, and Sawn, proposed and verified the concept of SPs by correlation with an 
energy loss in thin metallic films (Ritchie 1957, Powell and Swan 1960). A decade later, Otto as well 
as Kretschmann and Raether almost simultaneously, reported the experimental method to generate 
SPs of gold and silver nanoparticles for the first time around 1970 (Otto 1968, Kretschmann and 
Raether 1968).
2.5.1 Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) 
SPPs are surface-charged electromagnetic waves propagating along the interface of a conductive 
metal and/or dielectric material coupled to a p-polarized electromagnetic wave. The magnitude 
of the propagated wave can be determined by the relative permittivity of dielectric material, with 
nothing but propagating media. 
2.5.2 Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
When light shines on MNPs, the surrounded free-electron cloud oscillates at the incident electric 
field’s frequency, called local surface plasmons. LSPR describes the enhancement of these 
oscillations when the frequency of electromagnetic radiation matches with the frequency of the 
electron cloud of metal particles (Baffou and Quidant 2014). Therefore, the dipole-like electron 
oscillation in LSPR along the associated electromagnetic field’s direction makes nanoparticles 
efficient absorbers with a specific frequency.42 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
The nanoparticles’ absorbed energy from the excitation can be further released or transferred 
afterwards, and radiatively redistributed to the far-field. It can also be released locally as heat 
dissipation into the metal due to the oscillation damping. This is also known as the photothermal 
effect of MNPs (Yaqoob et al. 2020).
2.5.3 Applications of surface plasmon polaritons 
The capability to manipulate and control the electric field, both within the MNPs and near the 
confined surface, opens up a realm of possible applications such as SPP waveguides (Maier et al. 
2003, Oulton et al. 2008, Weeber et al. 1999) and sources (Lerosey et al. 2009), SERS (Gopinath 
et al. 2009), optical data processing (O’Connor and Zayats 2010), photovoltaics (Ferry et al. 2008), 
chemical and bio sensors (Moores et al. 2004, Rosi and Mirkin 2005), etc. 
2.5.3.1 Plasmonic waveguides
Optical interconnections in the form of waveguides can provide very high bandwidth in data 
transmission. SP based photonic circuits are future technologies for achieving high-density photonic 
integration with small electronics dimensions. SPP waveguides such as Ag spherical nanoparticles 
arranged in a linear chain fashion, with a distance calculated by Mie theory, have shown light 
propagation along the chain by pairing the irradiation at parallel polarization (Weeber et al. 1999). 
Bozhevolnyi et al. designed plethora of subwavelength waveguide structures, such as V-grooves 
of Au on Silica substrate, single Y-splitters, and Mach–Zehnder configured interferometers with two 
consecutive Y-splitters, etc. All these SPPs’ structures manifest single-mode with mostly losses of a 
few dB at telecom wavelengths (Bozhevolnyi et al. 2005).
The surface with low roughness and high-quality patterned noble metal nanostructures are 
indispensable since SPP propagation loss is directly dependent on it. Recent work shows that 
the measurement of SPP propagation lengths approaches theoretical values in exhibiting Raman 
scattering enhancements for sensing applications for perfectly flat and ultra-smooth Au patterns on 
Si-substrate (Nagpal et al. 2009).
2.5.3.2 Near-field optics 
SNOM is an optical imaging technique able to control and observe light at nanometer-scale 
resolution. The strongly localized SPP modes in nanoscale metal structures essentially slow-down 
the coupled electromagnetic waves, which means a decrease in the effective wavelength in the midst 
of the metal nanostructures. Therefore, this confined field of light results in a spatial resolution close 
to the size of metal nanostructures, and is used to construct nanoscale images. 
Ketterson et al. (1995) reported a SNOM based on SPPs looming from the ultrathin metal film 
surface, and a tungsten probe tip placed in Kretschmann’s total internal reflection configuration. 
As a result, the scattered SPPs are enhanced by the localized surface irregularities and radiate in a 
conical fashion. In this case, scattered SPPs serve as a probe to shun the complications associated 
with aperture-based probes, and exploit SPPs to improve the signal and boost the signal’s collection 
efficiency (Kim et al. 1995). 
2.5.3.3 Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy 
Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is one of the essential applications of SPPs currently, 
and was discovered by Jeanmarie and Van Duyne (Jeanmaire and Van Duyne 1977), and Albrecht and 
Creighton in 1977 (Albrecht and Creighton 1977). Electromagnetic enhancement attributed to the 
excitation of SPPs is one of the most recognized mechanisms of SERS compared to other mechanisms, 
such as chemical enhancement or resonance enhancement (Moskovits 1978). Electromagnetic Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 43
enhancement is nothing but SPP induced enhancement of molecular Raman scattering resulted from 
the light coupled illuminated metal nanostructures. SERS is known to detect ultra-low concentrated 
targets with high molecular sensitivity and specificity and provide more information on its chemical 
structure and conformation (Almehmadi et al. 2019). The SPs of nanostructures can directly affect 
SERS’ sensitivity and selectivity. So far, the most preferred plasmonic nanostructures are Au and Ag 
as SERS’s substrates, definitely due to their higher enhancing factor. 
Tian et al. reported SERS effect for the exanimation of organic dye Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as 
a function of different shapes of gold nanostructures with equivalent dimensions. After running 
a systematic measurement, the resultant SERS signals’ intensity were classified following shape 
dependence SERS effect: nanospheres < nanosphere aggregates < nanotriangles < nanostars 
(Tian et al. 2014).
Stamplecoskie et al. described the influence of Ag particle size, with the same Ag concentrate 
on SERS intensity, in probing R6G dye at a long wavelength excitation (785 nm). The optimal 
size of Ag NPs was 50–60 nm based on the dynamic depolarization and better absorption on the 
available surface area at constant Ag concentration (Stamplecoskie et al. 2011). 
For example, Xu et al. reported SERS ultrasensitive detection of R6G molecules by using 
a novel substrate, i.e., porous anode alumina with a periodical aligned silver nanowire arrays. 
Reported the detection of the Raman signals with a low concentration of 10–13 M under visible 
light (514.5 nm) excitation (Xu et al. 2009).
2.5.3.4 Data Storage
Future data recording and retrieving mechanisms can use the resonance of SPPs of the metallic 
nanostructures. Multiplexed optical recording by far/field spectroscopic optical detection technique 
can allow storing the information beyond 1 Tbit cm/3. In another instance, there are plasmonic 
based data storage systems where a femtosecond pulsed laser can irradiate a bunch of plasmonic 
optical disk constituting a collection of plasmonic metal nanostructures. Each nanostructure can 
change the femtosecond pulse laser spectrum; thus, each structure can store a one/unit bit cell. 
Thus, the plasmonic based nanostructure based data storage is dependent on the variation of SPP 
wavelength, polarization as well as spatial dimensions of the individual or multiple nanostructures. 
A five-dimensional optical recording studied the peculiarities of longitudinal LSPR of Au 
nanorods(Figure 3). One-dimensional noble metals (Au nanorods) possess the ability of anisotropic 
polarization that depends upon their diameter and incident light wavelength. The sample consists 
of multiple alternative stacks of recording layers (1 micron) and a transparent spacer (10 microns). 
The recording layer made of spin coated polyvinyl alcohol doped with Au nanorods is divided 
into domains responsive to three specific wavelengths and polarizations. Therefore, it contains an 
overall of nine multiplexed states in one single recording layer. The advantage of such a concept is 
multiplexing in the orthogonal direction and providing multiple recordings in each dimension, and 
data stability at ambient conditions with numerous readouts (Zijlstra et al. 2009). 
2.5.3.5 Solar cells 
Solar cells transform light energy directly into electrical energy via the photovoltaic effect. The 
SPs, including LSPRs and SPPs, have been extensively studied to enhance thin-film solar cells’ 
efficiency. Using plasmonic excited metallic nanostructures, not only can the light be trapped or 
concentrated at the absorber, but these materials can also serve ingeniously as back contacts or 
even anti-reflective electrodes in some innovative designs. Plasmonic nanostructures incorporated 
in the absorber materials can drastically reduce their thickness due to their efficient light absorption 
compared to the conventional solar cells. Three different configurations of integrated plasmonic 
structures are utilized to improve overall solar cell efficiency, such as:44 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
2.5.3.5.1 Top surface plasmonic structures
They can be configured on the top surface of the solar cell absorber in the form of nanoparticles 
that could enhance light absorption by scattering the sunlight and reducing the reflection. Plasmonic 
structures can also be placed in the form of a thin mesh or grid, which eventually serves as a 
top electrode and aid plasmonic excitation. The MO or dielectric particles can also induce light 
scattering, but not as good as metal plasmonic elements. For example, high-density gold nanoparticles 
deposited on the amorphous silicon surface demonstrated an 8.1% increase in energy conversion 
efficiency (Derkacs et al. 2006). Similarly, photocurrent increment due to SPP was systemically 
studied with the incorporation of different metallic nanoclusters (Au, Ag and Cu) at the ITO-CuPe 
interface. Overall photocurrent enhancement followed the sequence of 1.3 (Ag) < 2.2 (Au) < 2.7 (Cu)
(Stenzel et al. 1995). 
2.5.3.5.2 Embedded plasmonic structures 
The intensity of the light absorption in the solar cell can be enhanced by embedding plasmonic 
structures directly in the absorber layer. Robust light localization around embedded plasmonic 
elements aid in the generation of photocurrent in the solar cell (Knight et al. 2013). 
2.5.3.5.3 Back surface plasmonic structures
Similar to top surface plasmonic structures, they can be configured at the back surface of a solar cell 
to enhance the light absorption by trapping light and serving as a back electrode. These configurations 
can benefit both SPP at the metal-absorber interface, and also be coupled to waveguide modes of the 
absorber. Au convex nanostructures deposited at the back of the perovskite solar cell (PSC) reduced 
the losses and enhanced light absorption, consequently increasing photocurrent density from 
Figure 3. Sample arrangement and patterning of (Left) thin recording films of spin-coated PVA doped with Au nanorods, 
separated by a transparent pressure-sensitive adhesive. In the recording layers, different images were patterned using various 
wavelengths (λ1–3) and polarizations of the recording laser. When illuminated with unpolarized broadband illumination 
(Middle), a convolution of all patterns will be observed on the detector. When the adequate polarization and wavelength are 
chosen (Right), patterns can be read out individually (Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Limited, Nature,

Gu, Vol. 459 (2009)). Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 45
18.63 mA/cm2
 to 23.5 mA/cm2
. Therefore, overall photoconversion efficiency increased from 
14.62 to 19.54% (Tooghi et al. 2020). 
Generally, photoactive layers must be optically thick enough to absorb most of the incident 
light and efficiently generate the photoexcited charge carriers. However, thin absorber layers 
can enhance the conversion efficiency by facilitating adequate photocarrier collection over short 
distances. Researchers found out that SPPs enabled solar cells can increase light absorption in the 
active material layer, especially at the SC and metal nanostructures interface, improving the overall 
efficiency in solar energy devices.

photovoltaic devices using one dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D) patterned periodic 
metal nanostructures are reported elsewhere (Gan et al. 2013).
2.5.3.6 Chemical sensors and biosensors 
Continuous demand for reliable, sensitive, and eco-friendly sensors brings on an enormous research 
interest towards many biological and environmental issues. The first practical sensing application 
using SPR phenomena was reported in 1983 for biomolecular detection (Liedberg et al. 1983). SPR 
based bio and chemical sensors have become an essential platform for qualitative and quantitative 
chemical and biomolecular interactions. Commercial SPR-based biosensors and experimental 
devices are more often represented in Kretschmann’s scheme of plasmon excitation due to their 
ergonomic planar design and relative simplicity (Kretschmann 1971). 
SPR based sensors function in two ways, one being in the change of refractive index on the 
surface of a metallic film when in contact with the sample (Homola et al. 1999). The characteristics 
of light waves depend on the refractive index of the dielectric environment, which impacts the 
propagation length of SPs. Recently, the author reported a second detection mechanism apart from 
the refractive index change on SPR based sensors. It is based on the surface electron-polaritons’ 
density change, that can be sensitive to the difference in chemical ligands coordination (Daniel and 
Astruc 2004). 
SPP biosensors have many advantages:
1. They are versatile and can be used to detect any chemical or analyte. 
2. They require no labels such as radioactive or fluorescent labels to detect the analyte.
3. They have a fast detection response time, and can measure in real-time biomolecular interactions.
In the SPR sensors, any tiny mass, concentration, and refractive index change is tied to the 
particular immobilized molecules on the exterior of the thin metallic sensor and can be perceived 
as RU signals with an aid of a transducer. The localized surface plasmon causes electromagnetic 
enhancement in the tenuous field of the sensor surface (Ekgasit et al. 2004).
Au nanostructures are very commonly used as SPR sensor surfaces due to their versatility and 
high sensitivity for most analytes. Nano MOs and magnetic nanostructures with significant SPR 
signal magnification provide monitoring of multiple substances such as drugs, enzymes, hormones 
as well as bacteria and cells (Herberg et al. 2005). 
SPR sensor is constituted of a thin metallic film, on top of which lies another thin dielectric 
metallic layer. The performance of the sensor purely depends on the thickness of the metal layer and 
its dielectric constant. Graphene is a one atomic thick carbon layer in the form of a perfectly arranged 
planar honeycomb structure that has large surface area. Its abundant π conjugation structure renders 
it a highly suitable candidate for SPR biosensing (Szunerits et al. 2013).
Like graphene, a single atomic thick structure platinum diselenide (PtSe2
) has reported remarkable 
optoelectronic properties. It has drawn significant attention in the fast growing 2D materials field. 
SPR sensors through 2D layer of PtSe2
, graphene, and phosphorene have been studied, proving that 46 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
only the sensitivities of silver or gold film biochemical sensors for graphene, and phosphorene were 
observed at 118°/RIU and 130°/RIU, while the sensitivities of the PtSe2
-based biochemical sensors 
touched as high as 162°/RIU (Ag film) and 165°/RIU (Au film) (Jia et al. 2019).
SPR biosensors based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), where WS2
 layer 
coated on Al thin metal film surface, report more than three times angular sensitivity with 7-layers 
WS2
 coated on 36 nm Al thin film, compared to the typical structure-based single Al thin film, 
obtaining a maximum phase sensitivity with bilayer WS2
 and 35 nm Al thin-film composite 
structures (Zhao et al. 2018).
MNPs are excellent materials for sensitive SPR-based biosensors. However, they still 
presenting some disadvantages, such as the surface inadequacy for biological use, their natural 
particle aggregation, and the loss of magnetic activity in biological environments. To surmount 
these problems, MNPs in the form of core-shell (ferrites such as Fe3O4, Fe2O3 as cores with shells 
containing Au, Ag, or alumina) are synthesized. For instance, Fe3O4@Au as a DNA biosensor 
(Kouassi and Irudayaraj 2006) have been designed. SPR bio-sensor made of core-shell Fe3O4@
Au MNPs were used as agents for the detection of the hepatocellular carcinoma tumor marker, 
α-fetoprotein (Liang et al. 2012). 
2.6 Dielectric properties
The plasmonic structures made of metals suffer from high radiation losses, heating and incompatibility 
with MOs fabrication processes. Recent developments have been made in nanoscale optical physics, 
targeting the manipulation of optically induced Mie resonances in dielectric as well as metal or 
SC nanoparticles with high refractive indices. Such nanostructures have remarkable characteristics 
known for reduced dissipative losses, and large resonant enhancements in electric and magnetic 
fields. Resonant dielectric nanostructures offer great promise in the optoelectronics field for various 
technological applications such as nanoantennae, capacitors, actuators, and sensors. 
On the other side, dielectric nanocomposites with a concept of dispersion of nanoparticles 
in polymer have good compatibility with interfaces. These polymer nanocomposites can cover 
many applications such as nano-electronic, polymer bionanomaterials, reinforced nano-polymer 
composites, etc. However, the handling of such diverse technology with desirable dielectric 
properties is a great challenge, due to the complex and meticulous synthesis techniques. 
Nanocomposite materials have many advantages in electric and dielectric characterization, such 
as dielectric confinement effect, surface effect, quantum effect, and volumetric effect. Moreover, 
nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable, consequently leading to aggregation. The NP 
aggregates are thus responsible for the formation of defect centers, enhancement of the local electric 
field, and decrease of the breakdown strength (Calebrese et al. 2011), but also highly increasing 
the dielectric losses resulting from DC conduction. Therefore, by blending nanoparticles with 
many varieties of polymers in the form of nanocomposites, such aggregations could be avoided. In 
most of the cases, such combinations require the polymer in solution or in melted form in order to 
disperse the nanostructures homogeneously (Krishnamoorti 2007). The type, size, geometric shape, 
and dispersion or concentrations of nanoparticles have apparent effects on the overall electric and 
mechanical properties of nanocomposites. 
They can either assist or restrict the free charge mobility and decrease or increase electric 
insulation to access or limit the generation of mobile charge and the movement of charge carriers 
in polymer dielectrics. Therefore, the improvement in dispersion of inorganic nanofillers is vital in 
enhancing the electrical and mechanical properties of nanocomposites (Ng et al. 2001, Zhang et al.
2000).Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 47
2.6.1 Dielectric insulators 
Blending of nanoparticles into polymeric matrices can control overall dielectric performances 
with the aim to apply in industrial processes. For instance, nanoparticle composed polymers have 
better dielectric strength than conventional insulation materials. Furthermore, some of the specific 
nanomaterials can increase the charging capacity of power dielectric material, thus being used in 
high-charge storage capacitors. MO nanoparticles like magnesium oxide, fumed silica, barium 
titanate (BT), alumina, and titanium dioxide can increase the dielectric constant of electrical 
insulation materials. In contrast, the materials like clay, silica, glass beads nanoparticles decrease 
dielectric constants with increased volume fraction for variant electrical insulation systems. 
Similarly, low-loss dielectric materials (Sebastian et al. 2015) have got constant demand in wireless 
telecommunication applications such as Internet of Things (IoT).
However, the clear relationship between the concentration of filler, and the permittivity of 
the composite was uncertain (Brosseau et al. 2007), until Maxwell demonstrated an analytical 
approximation method by considering permittivity and volume fraction of spherical shaped 
nanoparticles, which are homogeneously distributed in an inclusion polymer matrix (Lombardo 
2007). According to the Maxwell-Wagner theory of interfacial polarization, the material’s dielectric 
behavior at low frequency can be represented as two layers. The first layer is a large number of 
grains, which conducts layers at higher frequencies. The second layer constitutes of grain boundaries, 
acting as a highly resistive medium at lower frequencies; therefore, as the frequency increases, the 
constant dielectric increases. At low frequency, generally, (ε′) has low values and then rises along 
with frequency and reaches a constant value at higher frequencies. This rise of (ε′) can be correlated 
to collective contributions of electronic, ionic, and interfacial polarization (Kumar et al. 2006).
The dielectric constant of CdS nanocomposites is larger than the bulk CdS, especially in the 
low frequency range (Suresh 2014). CdS nanoparticles with particle size around 3.85 nm exhibited 
better dielectric properties, due to their quantum confinement effect, observed on having a wider 
bandgap of 2.58 eV with a blue shift of 480 nm in the optical absorption spectrum with respect to 
the bulk counterpart (2.42 eV). 
Mn3
O4
 ferro-nanoparticles demonstrated a high dielectric constant because of their smaller size 
well-dispersed nanoparticles, and each Mn3
O4
 nanoparticle acts as a nano-dipole under electric fields; 
therefore, cumulative dipole moment results in a high dielectric constant (Dhaouadi et al. 2012). 
Nonetheless, nano-grain boundaries play an essential role in transport properties. For instance, ZnO 
nanofillers in the polymer matrix have shown a high electrical permittivity with high nano-grain 
boundaries containing many defect structures. The particle size of inorganic nanoparticles in the 
polymer matrix has quite an influence on the dielectric behavior, where the dielectric properties 
of nanocrystalline ZnO particles with different particle sizes (d = 22–98 nm) were studied. There 
are two regions of conduction mechanisms that depend upon the core particle conduction and 
grain boundary conduction. The 22 nm-sized ZnO nanocomposite has a large volume fraction of 
interfaces that induce a better barrier hopping conduction and a quantum tunneling mechanism due 
to the smallest nanoparticles (Parvez Ahmad et al. 2019, Cheng et al. 2018).
BT nanoparticles coated with double layers such as hyperbranded aromatic polyamide (HBP) 
and PMMA nanocomposites were reported as core@double-shell nanocomposites. These double 
polymer layer shell has shown higher dielectric constant and low dielectric loss as compared to 
core@single layer BT@PMMA composites (Xie et al. 2013).
Compared to the PVDF loaded with BT nanofibers (NFs) and BT@TO NFs nanocomposites, 
the novel design nanocomposites filled with BaTiO3@TiO2@Al2O3 NFs presents low dielectric 
loss, high breakdown strength, and low leakage current densities. Therefore, a novel core-double 
shell structure aids the effectivity of polymer nanocomposites for compact and flexible high energy 
storage devices (Pan et al. 2017).48 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
2.7 Magnetic properties 
Magnetic properties of nanoparticles:
Magnetic nanoparticles are broadly defined as nanoparticles that can be manipulated using magnetic 
fields. They are also known as magnetic nanobeads. 
2.7.1 Physical properties of magnetic nanoparticles 
The magnetic moment of a material is obtained by the addition of the individual magnetic moment 
of particles that have both mass and electric charges. A spinning electric-charged particle results 
in the generation of a magneton (magnetic dipole). Ferromagnets are materials in which all the 
magnetons are aligned towards one direction and their resultant moment is different to zero. For 
example, several crystalline materials exhibit ferromagnetism (Fe, Co, or Ni). If all magnetons 
presented in a unit volume of ferromagnetic material are aligned in the same direction, it is known 
as a Weiss domain or magnetic domain. The magnetic behavior of a ferromagnetic material depends 
on the size of the domain. The size of a ferromagnetic material is reduced to the order of a single 
magnetic domain and will have a uniform magnetization due to aligned magnetons, whereas in 
larger particles, the magnetons are pointing to all sorts of random directions due to their multi￾domain nature and have non-uniform magnetization. When the size of particle approaches a single 
domain, due to the discrete nature of electronic band structure, it is possible to observe permanent 
magnetism in certain metals. For example, Pd nanoparticles are ferromagnetic which is not the case 
in their bulk form (Sampedro et al. 2003). 
Coercivity is the capacity of a ferromagnetic material to resist an external magnetic field 
without losing its magnetism. Coercivity is denoted by HC and usually measured in oersted or 
ampere/meter. The important feature of ferromagnetic materials is their strongly size-dependent 
coercivities. It has been corroborated that as particle size lessens, the coercivity rises to a maximum 
and later decreases towards zero. When the magnetic dimension drops down to a critical diameter 
(Dc) where there is only a single domain, coercivity is maximized. When the size of single-domain 
particles diminishes below a critical diameter, then coercivity tends to become zero, thus resulting in 
superparamagnetic in nature (Figure 4). The concept of superparamagnetism of magnetic materials 
in the nanoscale was first proposed by Frenkel and Doefman in 1930 (FRENKEL and DOEFMAN 
1930). They predicted that ferromagnetic NPs with a particle size smaller than single-domain size 
would display superparamagnetic properties. These superparamagnetic particles are sensitive to 
thermal fluctuations. Some single domain nanoparticles can behave either as ferromagnetic or 
superparamagnetic or sometimes both, depending on temperature. This thermal transition from 
superparamagnetism to ferromagnetism is called blocking temperature (i.e., cobalt ferrites). The 
advantage of superparamagnetic particles can be employed in biological environments. For example, 
ferrite oxide-magnetite (Fe3
O4
), and maghemite (Fe2
O3
) are the most studied magnetic materials 
that can be exploited in the form of superparamagnetic substance (Mikhaylova et al. 2004). The 
ferromagnetic NPs can be employed to fabricate permanent magnetic arrays for high-density data 
storage whereas super magnetic NPs possess different applications viz., biological sensing, imaging, 
and drug delivery. 
2.7.2 Industrial applications 
MNPs are customarily exploited as pigments in porcelain, and paints (Hradil et al. 2003). Along 
with iron oxide, some ferrites have also been applied as catalysts during the synthesis of ammonia, 
the desulfurization of natural gas, Fisher-Tropsch synthesis for BT and oxidation of alcohols (Park 
et al. 2000, Kharisov et al. 2016). Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 49
2.7.2.1 Biomedical applications 
Magnetic nanoparticles are widely used in biomedical applications; it can be in vivo (inside the 
body) or in vitro (outside the body) (Tartaj et al. 2003). Ferromagnetic iron oxides’ nanoparticles 
have been highly used compared to other materials because of their higher sensitivity and nearly 
saturated superparamagnetic properties. Consequently, it is easy to track such particles without 
sacrificing their stability in an aqueous colloidal suspension. 
2.7.2.2 In vivo applications 
For in vivo applications, degradation of MNPs is a paramount factor and depends on the core material 
and the coating material. Further, core-shell nanoparticles are effective in the body since they are 
highly biocompatible in nature, allows drug delivery and possess very high magnetic properties 
(KILPATRICK et al. 1997). 
To employ the magnetic nanoparticles inside the body, their size and surface functionality 
play crucial roles. The size of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) is around 
10 to 40 nm, generally preferred for pro-longed blood circulation and better biodistribution (Lu et al. 
2007). On application of an external magnetic field to SPIONs, their magnetic characteristics can be 
exploited, and magnetic energy can be transferred into SPIONs in the form of heat in order to target 
tumor tissues locally. This technique is known as hyperthermia and is one of the most successful 
cancer therapies (Gao et al. 2004) .

2.7.2.2.1 Drug delivery systems
MNPs with the combination of an external magnetic field and/or magnetizable implants on them 
allows the delivery of nanoparticles in vivo to the targeted area. Then, pathogenic cells are fixed 
by releasing drug at the local site known as magnetic drug targeting technique (Casula et al. 2006). 
This kind of local site treatments can eliminate side effects and high dosages. The surfaces of these 
particles are most commonly functionalized with organic polymers and inorganic metals or MOs to 
generate biocompatibility and suitability for the coupling of multiple bioactive molecules (Gupta 
et al. 2007). Controlled drug release is one of the recent advances in MNP loaded drug delivery 
systems (DDS). Combining MRI imaging can permit real-time tumor-tracking, and controlled and 
stimuli triggered anticancer drug release (Ulbrich et al. 2016). 
SPION could serve a critical mission from precise drug delivery to inflammatory sites to 
maintain adequate concentrations at low cost and with no side effects. Recently, developments in the 
synthesis and drug delivery efficacity of several hollow structured magnetic MOs were summarized. 
The drug delivery efficiency has been tested in vivo and worked adequately on various antibotics 
(Cefradine, Vancomycin, enrofloxacin), anticancer drugs (Doxorubicin, cisplatin, camptothecin, 
paclitaxel, Docetaxel (DOX) and 5-Fluorouracil), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and Natural drugs ex: RhB or R6G (Gao et al. 2004).
2.7.2.2.2 MRI diagnosis
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most dominant non-invasive imaging methods in 
clinical analysis, based on the relaxation of protons in tissues. MRI is widely used as a diagnostic 
tool to present high spatial resolution of the tissues. Proton relaxation of accumulated magnetic 
nanoparticles on specific tissues is compared with that of the surrounding tissues, thus serving as an 
MRI contrast agent (Sun et al. 2008). This can also serve to monitor physiological and molecular 
changes to indicate the status of organ functions, blood flow, detection of inflammatory diseases, 
etc. (Thorek et al. 2006). Iron (Fe) and a few other NPs based on Gd or Mn have been studied as 
contrast sources in developing new MRI. NPs of Gd2O3, GdF3, and GdPO4 properties have been 
considered as T1 MRI CAs and tested with other nanostructured materials such as nanoporous silicas 
and dendrimers perfluorocarbon NPs, and nanotubes. Latest Gd-based NPs have a significantly high 
improved relaxation due to their ability to stock a high number of paramagnetic ions. 
Recently, a novel strategy- grafting/peeling-off surface coating of nanoparticle- has demonstrated 
adequate activity as magnetic resonance imaging probes can be specifically cleaved by specific 
enzymes, in an enzyme-rich milieu. Moreover, selective activation of nanoprobes by a specific 
enzyme renders greater tumor accumulation and enhanced retention time within the tumors. There is 
a possibility of functionalizing the surface of the nanoprobe with either cleavable or non-cleavable 
PEG linkers for the construction of active or inactive probes, respectively. To exemplify this aspect, 
Sun et al. attached cleavable PEG linkers on the fluorescent dyes of the probes; thus, this complex 
acted as an indicator to track enzymatic activities in vitro (Sun et al. 2019).
2.7.2.3 In vitro applications
2.7.2.3.1 Bio-separation
MNPs are mainly employed in diagnostic separation, selection, and magnetorelaxometry applications 
in vitro. Moreover, they got considerable attention in the separation of specific biological entities. 
Performing bio-separation in large volumes is a time-consuming procedure and requires an expensive 
filtration system, whereas superparamagnetic colloids are ideally optimal for this application due to 
magnetization being controllable with an external magnetic field (Fatima and Kim 2017).
Optimal particle size is required to have a decent magnetic response and sufficient specific 
surface area, which directly influences the bio-separation efficiency. Colloidal stability and Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 51
multifunctionality of magnetic nanocomposites are crucial for better compatibility with various 
bio agents. Recent advances have been successful in superparamagnetic nanoparticles and 
nanocomposites’ functionalization for separation of proteins, peptides, cells and exosomes as well 
as blood purification in bio-separation applications (Yang et al. 2020). 
2.7.2.3.2 Sensors in detection of bacteria, viruses and proteins
Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with efficient systems like antibodies, aptamers, can be 
used as a sensor to detect bacteria, viruses, cells, proteins, etc. (Zhang et al. 2013). The majority of 
biosensors are based on iron oxides (g-Fe2
O3
 and Fe3
O4
), due to their high active surface, ease of 
surface modification, high chemical stability, and fast reaction kinetics (Nabaei et al. 2018).
The inherent magnetic properties, like magnetoresistance and giant magnetoresistive effect 
(GMR), make metallic nanoparticles suitable as magnetic labels indicating molecular interactions. 
Specific recognition of the biomolecules is an essential requirement of the biosensor. The essential 
part of bio-recognition is the immobilization of molecules onto magnetic particles. Many bio￾recognition mechanisms were applied in sensing. In general, bare MPs are unstable and have 
low compatibility to biorecognition molecules, consequently limiting their potential in many 
applications. Therefore, the surface modification strategy of MPs would help colloidal stability and 
relevant functional groups for the adequate conjugation of biomolecules. 
In the previous sections where we have discussed about different properties of nanoparticles, 
we have dealt with different MNPs. Now we would like to discuss about the two most promising 
and advanced type of nanoparticles that possess many applications in solar cells, electrical and 
electronic systems. 
3. A special discussion on metal sulfides 
Metal sulfides contain either localized and/or itinerant 3d electrons. Covalent bonding is present, 
resulting in reduced formal charge on transition metals and enabling metal-metal bond formation. 
Uniqueness to their structural conformation is mainly caused by hybridization between 3s and 
3p orbitals with 3d orbitals favoring trigonal-pyramid configuration; S-S bonding may produce 
molecular anions, and the large polarizability of the anions favor adjacent layer connection via Van 
der Waals interactions (Rao and Pisharody 1976).
Sulfides are generally softer than their oxidated counterparts (with the exception of PbS). 
Nonetheless, for this and its layer lattice structure, lubricating properties appear with friction level 
decreasing at high speeds and loads. Complex sulfides show good pad and disk wear (Melcher 
and Faullant 2000). Also, these compounds have lower thermodynamical stability than oxides, and 
lower melting points (rare-earth sulfides being the exception) (Mrowec and Przybylski 1984). 
Nanostructured sulfides are sought as the number of active sites and intrinsic activity is related 
to its morphological characteristics. Hollow metal sulfides have great active site density (Joo et al.
2019), desirable aspect when taking into consideration the great charge capacity metal sulfides show 
(α-MnS = 900 –1300 mAh/g, FeS = 500 mAh/g, FeS2 = 600 mAh/g, etc.). Thus being adequate 
enough to be used as electrodes, with their cycling stability being a determinant parameter. Voltage 
efficiency is also limited to their large band gap hindering any commercial applications (i.e., in 
lithium-ion batteries) (Xu et al. 2014).
Some sulfides behave as SCs (CdS, PnS, SnS2
, SnS, MoS2
, Bi2
S3
, CuS, etc.), while others 
behave as metals or even insulators. Therefore, the tuning of its optical properties (i.e., band gap) is 
achievable as any similar material, through size and morphology modification, surface engineering, 
doping, etc. (Shen and Wang 2013). Considering previous physical properties, these materials are 52 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
suitable for flexible optoelectronic applications, as films conserving their crystallinity ensure high 
conductivities and high charge carrier mobilities (Shinde et al. 2015).
Also, sulfides as energy materials have to deal with high temperature instability, volume 
expansions and slow reaction kinetics, in some cases due to insufficient interlayer spacing for transport 
phenomena (Barik and Ingole 2020). Molybdenum and vanadium sulfides are strong candidates 
for batteries, not only for their capacity, but for their desired 2D layered structure. Graphene-like 
morphology provides the material with adequate space for electrolyte-ion transportation while 
shortening transportation of ions and electrons, resulting in high specific capacity and cyclic stability 
(Geng et al. 2018). 
On medical applications, 2D materials are suited for drug delivery, as extensive surface 
interactions are enabled on a small scale. Mechanical properties permit potential biomedical 
performance, and even optical-therapy strategies (Zhu et al. 2018b). Usage in photothermal cancer 
treatment for metal sulfides is viable. Ag2
S, Bi2
S3
, CdS, and CuS NPs coated with proteins have 
shown high photothermal efficiency, biostability and, furthermore, biocompatibility (Sheng et al.
2018). 
3.1 MoS
Molybdenum monosulfide is a rarely studied structure as it can be found at high pressures 
(120 GPa). At ambient pressure, hexagonal MoS is the most stable with an Imm2 space group 
(a = 11.660 Å, b = 3.306 Å, c = 5.555 Å) and higher covalent character; however, Pmn21 (a = 3.013 Å, 
b = 4.528 Å, c = 4.686 Å), Amm2 (a = 3.148 Å, b = 12.083 Å, c = 5.323 Å), and Pmmn (a = 4.463 Å, 
b = 3.11 Å, c = 4.381 Å) phases are energetically more stable (metastable) at all pressures 
(Wei et al. 2017).
DFT has been used to predict monolayered structures, in order to find stable configurations. 
Buckled configuration is more stable than puckered configuration for MoS, even foretelling its 
non-magnetic metallic behavior (Pandey and Chakrabarti 2019). Even information such as cluster 
geometric distribution, electronic structures (numerical electron spin density), and chemical 
bonding are available. In synthesis, sulfur atoms sequentially occupy the terminal sites, resulting 
in polisulfidation rather than controlled monosulfidation (Wang et al. 2013). As synthesis methods 
lack, further properties and applications for this monochalcogenide are missing; however, further 
possibilities of experimentation and investigation arise.
3.2 MoS2
Molybdenum disulfide is a layered metal sulfide, with generally a laminate structure (~ 0.65 nm 
(Li and Zhu 2015)), which gives it its lubricating properties (film forming properties) (Rui et al. 
2014). It is quite stable as it is not affected by diluted acids or oxygen (Coutinho et al. 2017). 
It is polytypic: 2H structure follows P63
/mmc space group (a = b = 3.16 Å, c = 12.29 Å), 3R 
structure belongs to R3m space group (a = b = 3.16 Å and c = 18.37 Å), and the space group of 
metastable synthetic 1T is P1 (a = b = 3.36 Å, c = 6.29 Å) (Rui et al. 2014). 2H (hexagonal) is 
more stable energetically as temperature increases, while 3R (rhombohedral) is better suited for 
thermal insulation. Their complex dielectric function and absorption are responsive to the plane 
of polarization of incident light. Through their Brillouin zone, phonon stability is ensured, which 
indicates dynamical stability (Coutinho et al. 2017).
Metastable MoS2
 presents unique physical properties due to its unique structure. Electron 
hopping between 1T islands show a distinctive metal-like electron transport mechanism. 
Superconductivity is proven when measuring magnetic and heat capacity (Tc
 = 4 K); even when 
ensuring a nanosheet structure, superconducting volume fraction can be completely confirmed 
(100%). Trimerization of Mo atoms in 1T phases enable ferroelectricity due to spin-orbit coupling Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 53
effect. Finally, two-spin parallel 4d electrons in dxy,xz,yz orbitals predict ferroelasiticity and may 
enable ferromagnetism (Zhao et al. 2018a).
As expected, it is a very soft material (1–1.5 Mohs), with a 5.06 g/cm3
 density and a low ionic 
character (22%). Mechanically, it is highly elastic, has low pre-tension, and for its Young’s modulus 
(0.33 ± 0.07 TPa in 5 to 25 layer nanosheets), it is a suitable alternative to graphene (Castellanos
Gomez et al. 2012). Thermally, it sublimates (theoretically) and oxidates at 450ºC and evaporates/
decomposes at 950ºC (Melcher and Faullant 2000) (following MoS2
 to Mo2
S3
 to Mo (Liu et al
‐
.
2017)). Electrically, its theoretical capacity of 167–669 mAh/g makes it adequate for energy storage 
(batteries) (Rui et al. 2014). Mobility could be up to 200 cm2
/V/s (at 25ºC), with current on/off 
ratio of 1 × 108
, following n-type behavior. Its 1.8 eV direct band gap gives a photocurrent response 
of 7.5 mA/W (at 50V) (Li and Zhu 2015). However, these characteristics are not absolute, as the 
engineering of different systems and phases of MoS2
 permit the tuning and enhancing further of a 
variety of properties.
Monocrystalline defect-free MoS2 possesses high mechanical strength (Young’s modulus 
of 158.2, resulting strength of 27.3 GpA), as previously, the variation from brittle to ductile has 
been proven to depend on the density of vacancy defects. Therefore, processes such as annealing 
(annealing temperature and time) greatly change lattice properties, through reconstruction and 
migration of grain boundaries (GBs) (Wu et al. 2018). Tuning GBs also propitiate ferromagnetic 
behavior, and presence of Mo-Mo/S-S bonds means unpaired 4d electrons of Mo present in the 
vicinage of defect rings. Limits are set since a decrease in linear density of homo-elemental bonds 
means energetic stability increase for GBs (Gao et al. 2017).
Preferred morphology of nanostructured MoS2
 is thermodynamically dependent (pressure￾temperature-composition), monolayer 2D structure (nanosheets) being the most thermodynamically 
favored (in comparison with bi- and multilayer). Also, the increase of layered disulfide is inversely 
proportional to the number of layers due to surface contributions. As to its preparation, Mo diffusion 
is the controlling factor since its diffusivity is extremely low in comparison to that of sulfur (Shang 
et al. 2016).
Nanoribbon structures have also been explored, being non-direct variable bandgap SCs, width 
and edge atoms dependent. Stiffness is ensured (~ 107 N/m) in the system, and even vacancy defects 
and adatoms adsorption may induce magnetic moments (Ataca et al. 2011). Zig-zag nanoribbons 
exhibit magnetic semiconducting behavior, while its armchair counterpart exhibits metallic 
nonmagnetic behavior. Thus, interest has increased for future research and applications of these 
highly stable MoS2
 1D structures (Li et al. 2008).
Electrical and energy applications vary from metallic to semiconducting MoS2
. The metallic 
phase is widely applied in batteries (lithium-ion, sodium-ion, etc.), supercapacitors, and even for 
hydrogen evolution reaction. Stability has been found to increase on hollow tube assemblies, as the 
material is easily affected by pH, light, electron beam, heat, etc. (Jiao et al. 2018). 
Photocatalytic activity for MoS2
 based catalysts (semiconductive phase) is harnessed on 
hydrogen production, water remediation (organic pollutants decomposition, inorganic pollutants 
treatment, and photocatalytic disinfection), and photosynthesis (CO2
 reduction, NH3
 production, 
and organics production), and also with some photoelectrocatalytic experiments showing improved 
performance (Li et al. 2018b). As opposed to nanosheets with bandgap tunability being thickness 
dependent (Lee et al. 2012), NPs have tunable optical properties due to quantum confinement, 
thus showing excitation dependent emission profiles (with emission lifetime being size dependent), 
adequate for dye treatment (Bhattacharya et al. 2020).
Ultimately, even MoS2
 is suited for a wide variety of biomedical applications such as 
functionalization for drug delivery and photothermal cancer treatment. As various pathways have 
been explored (cellular trafficking, endocytosis/exocytosis, and nanocell activity), NIR laser in 
tissues requires improvement, as well as MoS2 in vivo stability needs to be ensured (Zhu et al.
2018b).54 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
4. A special discussion on Perovskite oxides
In 1839, calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO3
) mineral was discovered by Geologist Gustav Rose in the 
Ural Mountains of Russia, named perovskite after an eminent Russian mineralogist Lev Perovski 
(1792–1856) (Johnsson and Lemmens 2007). Perovskites are a class of materials with a similar 
structural formula ABX3
 (A and B are cations of different valence and ionic radii, and X is an anion). 
In the cubic unit cell of ABO3
 perovskite, B cation is located at the body center. An octahedron of 
X anions is located at face-centered positions and surrounded by B ions (Wolfram and Ellialtioglu 
2006). In contrast, A cation is located at the cube corner positions (Figure 1). The detailed cell 
structure is mentioned in the upcoming section. Most of the inorganic perovskites are transition 
MOs (ABO3
), where X anions are based on oxygen.
Two different types of perovskites exist, i.e., inorganic and hybrid, where hybrid is a mixture of 
organic and inorganic components. 
4.1 Inorganic perovskites
Inorganic perovskites have outstanding magnetic and electrical properties and exhibit different 
insulating, semiconducting, metallic, or superconducting behaviors. For example, MgSiO3
 and 
FeSiO3
 are most abundant in the Earth’s crust (Galasso 1969). Some perovskite oxides possess 
different properties such as insulating, metallic, magnetic and super conducting (Wolfram and 
Ellialtioglu 2006). Inorganic perovskites got many attentions due to its high performance, low cost, 
and abundance.
Perovskites are known for various good electric, optical, and magnetic properties. These materials 
also possess adequate characteristics for numerous applications such as photo and electrochromic 
catalysis, electronics, energy storage, and acoustics due to their versatile physicochemical properties. 
They have been employed as active catalysts for CO and HCs oxidation, oxygen reduction reactions, 
and can also significantly aid in electrochemical applications such as sensing, water-splitting, 
hydrogen production, and fuel cells.
In the ABO3
 form, an ion A is either an alkali earth metal or lanthanides, and a B ion is generally 
from transition metal. A is generally larger than B, and O is the oxygen ion with the ratio of 1:1:3 
located at face-centered positions (Figure 6) (Johnsson and Lemmens 2007). 
Hines et al. reported that the ideal perovskite structure is cubic where corner-linked BO6
 octahedra 
are linked with interstitial A cations. However, the possibility of various elements and crystalline 
distortions may endure different structures such as orthorhombic, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and 
tetragonal from cubic perovskite to orthorhombic. However, all these distorted perovskites hold 
oxygen coordinations commonly with A and B sites by tilting the BO6
 octahedra and connected A 
cation displacement (Galasso 1969).
The stabilization of perovskite structure is facile and shows excellent flexibility of composition 
and various combinations of periodic elements due to their ability to incorporate multiple sizes and 
charges. 
As aforementioned, simple cubic perovskite has an atomic arrangement in a 3D corner-sharing 
octahedral fashion. Au contraire, layered perovskites include 2D layers of corner-sharing octahedral 
separated by cations layers. Thus, perovskites and layered perovskites’ electronic energy bands are 
noteworthy, and their structure is singular in specific properties. 
Moreover, the substitution of different ions into the A- and/or B-sites would lead to a deviation 
from an ideal stoichiometry, resulting in tuning optoelectronic properties (Atta et al. 2016).Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 55
4.2 Hybrid perovskites
Hybrid halide perovskites (HPs), the mixture of organic-inorganic components, have been at the 
top in researched optoelectronic materials in recent two decades (Kim et al. 2012). The surprise 
acceleration in photoelectrical conversion efficiency is considered the future of solar cells with 
guaranteed 25% solar conversion efficiency lately (Green et al. 2021). Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) 
have taken over the performance of copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) and advances towards 
commercialization and PSCs play an important role in plethora of applications (Green et al. 2021).
The synthesis of hybrid perovskites is usually achieved by facile chemical routes and in cost￾effective methods. Solution-based methods (hydrothermal, solvothermal, etc.) can permit bulk to 
molecular range covering 3D to 0-dimensional structures (Mitzi 2007).
In the atomic arrangements in hybrid perovskite (ABX3
), the component A is commonly an 
organic cation such as methylammonium (MA+
) or formamidinium (FA+
), or an atomic cation (often 
Cs+
) or a mixture, whereas the B component is commonly a divalent metal cation (usually Pb2+, Sn2+
or a mixture) and X component is a halide anion (typically Cl–
, I–
, Br–
 or a mixture) (Zhao and Zhu 
2016, Kitazawa et al. 2002). 
Compared to bulk perovskite materials, nanostructured materials such as quantum dots, 
nanoplatelets, nanowires, and layered 2D structures have exceptional photophysical properties (Zhao 
and Zhu 2016). The following sections focus on the unique features of hybrid PSCs. We particularly 
discuss their excellent optoelectronic properties and the impact of their structural changes. 
4.3 Tolerance factor of perovskite structure
V.M. Goldschmidt presented the tolerance factor t related to the perovskites crystal structure, which 
applies to the empirical ionic radii at room temperature
t = (RA + RB)/(√–
2(RX + RB) 
where RA, RB and Rx are the radius of the A-site cation, B-site cation, and X-site anion, in case of 
pure inorganic perovskites, where X is ion O2–. Factor t can be used to assess the degree of distortion 
of perovskite from the ideal cubic structure (Kieslich et al. 2014). In general, the B-site is typically 
taken by a large atom. Consequently, the A-site must be large enough to reduce the tolerance factor. 
The tolerance factor for hybrid or inorganic perovskites estimates the ionic radii of the molecular 
cations to beget perfect perovskite crystal symmetry. From the equation, t will decrease when the 
ratio of rA/rB diminishes. Based on the tolerance factor value, the variation of perovskite crystalline 
structure can be estimated. In metal halides, the cubic structure of the perovskite should be close to 
1 (between 0.813 and 1.107). On the other side, electroneutrality must not be overlooked, neutral 
balanced charge is essential to stabilize the perovskite structure. Thus, adding the charges of A 
as well as B cations would combine together to be equal to one whole charge of X anion, thus 
balancing the stoichiometry. 
Currently, lead and tin HPs have been the most-studied, as mentioned earlier, having MA+
 and/
or FA+
 anions for the A site. The tolerance factors for the traditional Pb or Sn HPs are displayed in 
Figure 6. When large or long-chain (alkylamine) groups occupy the A site, lead HP shifts a 2D layered 
structure. Similarly, the transition of perovskite structures is temperature-sensitive. For instance, 
the MAPbI3 perovskite reversible cubic (alpha) to the tetragonal (beta) phase transition happens 
at 330 K. Similarly, at shallow temperatures tetragonal (beta) phase transits into the orthorhombic 
(gamma) phase at around 100–150 K; atomic structure is shown in Figure 6 (Zhao and Zhu 2016).56 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
The single-crystal MAPbI3 perovskite with cubic phase structure has a bandgap measured to 
be 1.51 eV. However, MAPbI3 perovskite PSCs suffer from a comparably large bandgap (1.57 eV) 
and low charge-carrier transport. Therefore, FAPbI3 perovskite has been envisaged as a substitute, 
with a cubic phase with a comparatively lower bandgap of 1.48 eV. At the same time, the electronic 
band structure and, therefore, the absorption coefficient are worthy of comparison. However, they 
are significantly sensitive to the humidity in the atmosphere that induces a great number of surface 
defects, reducing the energy barrier for nucleation of the non-perovskite phase. Nanostructured HPs 
have drawn much attention due to their defect-tolerant structure and facile synthesis in comparison 
with conventional materials. Their properties and applications in photovoltaics, photocatalysis and 
photoelectrocatalysis. Nevertheless, HPs suffer from low chemical, thermal, and photostability 
factors. They are susceptible to photooxidation by exposition to atmospheric oxygen and humidity 
(Bisquert and Juarez-Perez 2019). HPs are also extremely sensitive to temperature and UV light 
exposure (Misra et al. 2015). Consequently, enhancing environmental stability is a popular subject 
in the studies of HPs. 
4.4 Tunable light emitting perovskites 
Moreover, hybrid perovskites have an exceptional bandgap tunability as compared to other SCs. 
Simply playing with their physical dimensions and chemical composition can achieve the bandgap 
engineering and color tunability exhibits from the UV to the NIR spectral regions (390–1050 nm) 
(Protesescu et al. 2015)
4.5 Bandgap tuning by anion and cation exchange
Ionic radii of commonly used ions in ABX3
 HPs (Shannon 1976, Kieslich et al. 2014) can be studied 
as follows.
4.5.1 Influence of A-site (cation) modification
From the general band diagram of HPs, A-site cation has no direct contribution to band-edge states. 
However, their modifications can prevent the geometric distortion of the crystal structure by sharing 
the corners with PnI6 octahedra in the APnI3 perovskites. Therefore, the bond distance and angle 
between the Pn2+ and X ions depend on the A-site cation size, ultimately affecting the distribution 
of the band edge states (Amat et al. 2014). For instance, the bandgap of APbI3 perovskite varies 
depending on the A cation size, such as 1.48 eV, 1.51 eV, and 1.7eV for FA, MA, and Cs, respectively. 
4.5.2 Influence of B site (cation) modification
Pb-based perovskite materials were primarily reported due to their high efficiency in the conversion 
of solar energy. However, researchers are interested in finding an alternative in B-site cation to 
replace Pd because of the toxicity issues. In that search, Sn has a valence electron configuration as 
similar to Pd and shows potential to replace in B-site cation in perovskites (CsSnI3
, MASnI3
, and 
FASnI3
) (Stoumpos et al. 2013). Because of the smaller ionic radius in comparison to Pd+2, bandgaps 
are narrowed (1.3–1.4 eV). However, photoconversion energy, has been reported to be less than that 
of compared to Pd-based one (PCE < 12%). It is because they are prone to oxidize easily and convert 
Sn2+ into Sn4+ in signification proposition. Plenty of research has been conducted to hinder the 
oxidation of Sn2+, resulting in a mix of Pd and Sn perovskites which have shown better suppression 
of Sn4+ and reduction of defects and low bandgap around 1.25eV which is ideal for better PCE in 
solar cells (as high as 24.8%) (Lin et al. 2019).Inorganic Nanoparticles: Properties and Applications 57
4.5.3 Influence of X site (anion)-modification
The modification of X-site anions can greatly alter the optoelectronic properties since they directly 
affect the band edge states. The halide anions with 8 valence electrons change from 3p to 4p to 5p 
when X changes from Cl to Br to I. According to the ionic radii of X, the octahedral corner sharing 
with B site cation influences the bandgaps of perovskites. 
For example, the HP, the anions including Cl−
, Br−
, and I−
 (ionic radii 181, 196, and 220 pm, 
respectively) bonded with Pb2+ in corner sharing octahedral fashion. The decrement in the ionic 
radius of halide anion causes decrease in their bond length with Pd in octahedral PbX6
, therefore 
resulting in an increase of the material’s bandgap. For example, by substitution of different halides 
in MAPbX3
, their optoelectronic properties were tuned, such as amplified spontaneous emission 
(ASE) and lasing at wavelengths bewteen 390 nm to 790 nm (Buin et al. 2015, Maculan et al. 2015). 
The strategy of using mixed anions such as I and Br was reported MAPb(I1–xBrx
)3
 [0 < x < 1] 
by Noh et al. in order to enhance the perovskite light-harvesting capacity and proved that the ratio 
of the halides could chemically control the perovskite bandgap engineering (Noh et al. 2013). On 
the other hand, pseudohalogen polyanions (SCN and BF4
) were used in order to replace the low 
chemical stable halide ions, especially iodide I–
. For example, BF4
 have been incorporated into 
MAPbI3
, has a negligible optical absorption due to its ionic radii (0.218 nm), and is similar to 
the I (0.220 nm). Therefore, the mixed pseudohalogen/HPs MAPbI3–x(BF4
)x shows higher order of 
photoresponse and electrical conductivity due to inclusion of fluorine as compared to pure halide 
perovskites (Nagane et al. 2014, Hendon et al. 2015). 
4.6 Tunable band-gap by nanocrystal shape and size 
Compositional changes in perovskites have demonstrated a fine color tuning, where colloidal 
nanocrystals of size 5–10 nm with mixed-halide (OA: MA)PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, and mixture) report 
a continuously tunable photoluminescence emission from 385 to 770 nm by changing composition 
and size (nanostructuring) (Pathak et al. 2015). Kovalenko and co-workers also experimented with 
CsPbX3
 nanoparticles that possess emissions from 410 to 700 nm with a controlled synthesis of 
monodisperse nano-cubes with crystal sizes varying from 4 to 15 nm (Protesescu et al. 2015). 
4.7 Applications of halide perovskite-based composites 
Pure HP and HP based composites have been employed in a varied range of applications, such as 
white LEDs, photoemission, detectors, photocatalysts, photovoltaics and memristors. 
4.7.1 LEDs
Current technology of high-quality LEDs is based on III–V direct bandgap SC materials, which 
is an expensive technique and requires a decent vacuum and high process temperatures. On the 
other hand, direct-bandgap SC-based perovskites are cheap and facile to synthesize. Their easy 
color tuning in the visible and infrared regions makes them very capable for various optoelectronic 
applications such as color displays and lighting and optical communication applications (Pathak 
et al. 2015, Byun et al. 2016).
The encapsulated HP nanostructures in a polymer matrix manifested a better white light 
emission performance. Moreover, the polymer encapsulation could avoid oxidation and improve 
their chemical stability in an open environment (Li et al. 2016).58 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
4.7.2 Photocatalyst and photovoltaic 
In general, photocatalysis has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in 
CO2
 reduction, water splitting, degradation of organic compounds, etc. HP-nanostructures are best 
photocatalysts, provided their chemical stability can be enhanced. They possess broader visible light 
absorption range and carrier diffusion length is also longer. In consequence, lead HP materials can 
be configured in tandem with MOs or ferrites in order to avoid their degradation in moisture and 
profit their bandgap and high photovoltage generation. 
Recently, photoelectrochemical (PEC) hybrid electrode configuration has been reported, where 
the MAPbI3 solar cell coupled with the MOs such BiVO4 (Chen et al. 2015) or hematite (Gurudayal 
et al. 2015) photoanode for solar fuel generation or water splitting applications.

Physical Methods for Synthesis of 
Nanoparticles
Kailas R. Jagdeo
1. Introduction
Nanoparticle synthesis is the production of particles from 1 to 100 nm in characteristic size which is 
considered the key factor in the nanotechnology field. On December 29, 1959, Richard P. Feynman, 
in his well-known talk on “There is plenty of room at the bottom: An invitation to enter a new 
field of Physics” at the California Institute of Technology (Feynman 1960), introduced the idea of 
miniaturization and that science and technology would be able to manipulate and control individual 
atoms and molecules leading to a new field in science. Since then, with a new sky touching thought 
of Feynman, the new ideas and concept about Nanotechnology started flourishing. In 1974, the word 
nanotechnology was first introduced by Norio Taniguchi (Professor, Tokyo University of Science, 
Japan) to explain semiconductor processes using thin film deposition as well as ion beam milling to 
exhibit the characteristic control to the range of nanometers. The evolution in the nanotechnology 
field leads to tremendous applications in various fields like material science, medical science, 
physical, chemical and biological sciences, bio-technology, pharmaceutical science, food technology, 
agriculture, energy, environment, etc. 
The nano-size particles show important characteristic of increased surface to volume ratio, 
which leads to various applications in supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, fuel cell, etc. It is reported 
that the transformation from bulk material to nano-size material shows change in physical and 
chemical properties, even if having the same composition as bulk material. This encourages the 
researcher to develop the nano materials with enhanced properties like catalytic activity, electrical 
conductivity, hardness, optical, mechanical, antibacterial, etc. Due to the interdisciplinary approach 
of nanotechnology, there are various techniques available to synthesize nanomaterials. Physical, 
chemical, biological and hybrid techniques of synthesis give different forms of nanomaterials like 
tubes, rods, wires, dots, clusters, colloids, thin films, etc. The method of synthesis of nanomaterials 
is selected as required for different applications. Nanoparticles can be prepared by using either 
top-down or bottom-up approach. Basically, in top-down approach the large size bulk material is 
simply broken down into nano-size particles whereas in bottom-up approach nanomaterials are 
synthesized by building of materials from atom by atom, molecule by molecule and cluster by 
cluster. The approach and technique of synthesis mostly depends on the type of nanomaterials,

materials of interest, quantity and their applications. On the basis of dimensionality, nanomaterials 
are categorized into zero dimensional (0D), one dimensional (1D), two dimensional (2D) and three 
dimensional (3D).
This chapter discusses only simple physical methods for synthesis of nanoparticles/nano 
materials.
2. Ball Milling
Production of nanomaterials using ball mills is the simplest mechanical method. The working 
principle of ball milling is the impact and size reduction of source material. The impact is caused due 
to falling of balls from top of the chamber (as shown in Figure 2) which reduces the size of source 
materials; this continuous process gives nanomaterials. Ball mills consist of a hollow cylindrical 
shaped chamber with a tight lid which rotates about its axis, as shown in Figure 1. The inner surface 
of the chamber is made rough by lining with an abrasion-resistant material like Mn (manganese), 
stainless steel (SS) or rubber. The electromagnet can be placed outside the chamber which exhibits 
the pulling magnetic force on the source material. By changing the strength of magnetic force, the 
milling energy can be changed to the required levels. The chamber is partially filled with balls and 
source material, usually 2:1 mass ratio. Balls are normally made of SS, WC (tungsten carbide), Si3
N4
(silicon nitride), Al2
O3
 (alumina), ZrO2 (zirconia), agate or rubber, etc. Heavy balls can be used for 
increasing impact energy on the source material on collision. It is observed that the larger size balls 
produce smaller grain size but it may introduce large defects in synthesized nanoparticles. During 
the process of synthesis of nanoparticles, the temperature of the chamber may rise to the range 
100–1100ºC. So water cooling or cryo-cooling can be used to dissipate the generated heat. Various 
types of ball mill are designed as per required applications. Generally, ball mills are categorized as 
per their mechanical operations into attritor, horizontal, planetary, high energy, or shaker. A specific 
gaseous atmosphere is required or vacuum is to be maintained during the process of synthesis of 
nanomaterials in order to obtain pure nanomaterial. High-energy ball mills are normally used for 
synthesis of nanomaterials, which are available in the form of planetary ball mills, vibrating ball 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of ball mill.
Rotating impeller68 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
mills and attrition ball mills. The tumbling mills with low energy are available as per requirements 
for synthesis of nanomaterials.
Among all these ball mills, planetary mill is widely used for preparation of nanoparticles. In 
this mill, the chamber with partially filled balls is kept on a specially designed rotating disk and the 
chamber also rotates around its own axis. As higher distance gives higher kinetic energy to balls and 
exhibits stronger impact on source material, the size of the chamber of planetary mill is kept larger. 
This results in increased efficiency of synthesis process of nanomaterials.
In tumbler mill, the partially filled chamber rotates about its longitudinal axis. Here, the 
diameter of the chamber affects the efficiency of the synthesis process of nanomaterials. The large 
diameter of chamber allows greater height of balls to fall and consequently higher energy is attained 
by balls, which results in increased impact on the source material.
In vibratory mills, the partially filled chamber is shaken back and forth at high frequency of 
vibration. For preparation of nanoparticles, frequency of vibration and amplitude of vibration are 
key factors but mass of source material also plays a vital role. 
Fe nanoparticles (Munoz et al. 2007), CuO nanopowder (Ayoman and Hosseini 2016) and 
TiO2 nanoparticles (Carneiro et al. 2014, Damonte et al. 2004) are synthesized by ball milling. 
Calcium carbonate nanoparticles are synthesized from Achatina fulica shell by dry milling followed 
by wet milling (Gbadeyan et al. 2020). Ball milling of jute fiber wastes is used for preparation of 
nanocellulose (Baheti et al. 2012) and functionalization of nanocellulose derivatives (Carmen et al.
2019).
3. Electric arc deposition
Electric arc deposition works on the principle of electric arc discharge, which is an electric discharge 
with the highest current density. The system consists of two electrodes—anode and cathode. Both 
electrodes are separated by an extremely small distance and kept in a suitable gas atmosphere. 
An extremely high voltage is maintained across the electrodes, so an extremely high electric field 
is produced. Due to this electric field, sudden spark is generated which results in extremely high 
localized temperature that leads to an arc plasma and vaporization of the electrode material. The

vaporization and subsequent cooling of electrode materials produces nanoparticles of it. The 
vaporization of electrode material works on the principle of thermionic emission.
Arc discharge method became more popular in 1991 when Iijima prepared carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs) using graphite electrodes (Iijima 1991). Arc discharge direct current (dc) or alternating 
current (ac) can be used for synthesizing carbon nanotubes and carbon nano fibers but it is reported 
that dc arc discharge provides higher yields of CNTs, mostly multi-wall CNTs. Single walled CNTs 
can be prepared using electrodes doped with catalyst particles such as Nickel-Yttrium, Cobalt￾Yttrium, Nickel-Cobalt, etc. It is also a powerful technique for preparing graphene using graphite 
rods. 
4. Laser ablation
Laser ablation method is used for obtaining various kinds of nanoparticles and became more popular 
after using it for synthesis of carbon nanotubes by using graphite target (Smalley et al. 1995). This 
technique is being used for synthesizing carbon nanotubes, semiconductor quantum dots, nanowires 
and core shell nanoparticles. The basic principle of nanoparticles’ preparation in a background of 
gas is the nucleation and growth of species generated by laser-vaporization. The rapid quenching of 
vapor decides the purity of nanoparticles. With extremely rapid quenching of vapors, nanoparticles 
exhibiting quantum size effect with the range of less than 10 nm can be synthesized.
Laser ablation in general involves the process of laser irradiation, which removes material from 
the target surface. The basic difference in laser ablation and laser evaporation is that laser ablation 
uses the non-equilibrium vapor/plasma conditions created at the target surface by intense powerful 
laser beam, whereas laser evaporation emphasizes the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium; 
heating and evaporation of material is done at this equilibrium. 
Laser ablation system has three important parts:
(a) Powerful laser source like ArF excimer laser, XeCl excimer laser, CO2 laser, Nd-YAG 
laser, etc.
(b) Ablation chamber
(c) Vacuum system
Figure 3. Schematic representation of Electric Arc Deposition system.70 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
In laser ablation, a focused laser beam from laser source is allowed to incident on the solid target 
material, fitted in ablation chamber which is filled with ambient media (gas or liquid). It induces 
the large amount light absorption at surface of target material. So temperature of absorbing material 
increases, which makes the vaporization of target material into laser induced plasma plume. The 
plume size and emission spectrum of it depends on four factors: 
(a) Material of target
(b) Ambient media (gas or liquid)
(c) Ambient pressure
(d) Laser conditions
The vaporized materials in some cases can be condensed into clusters and particles without any 
chemical reaction, whereas in some cases vaporized material can react with reactants introduced 
in the ablation chamber and produce new materials. The condensed particle can be either collected 
through a filter system, which consists of a glass fiber mesh or deposited on a substrate. During 
the process of vaporization and deposition, essential high vacuum is to be maintained, so High or 
Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) vacuum system is attached to ablation chamber. The ablation chamber 
is evacuated with a vacuum system and can be filled with inert gas or reactive gases as required for 
synthesis of nanomaterials. Here, gas pressure plays a key role in determining the size of particles 
and their distribution.
In pulsed laser ablation, a powerful pulsed laser source can be used for vaporizing target material 
into plasma plume. Due to use of a powerful pulsed laser, a tightly confined, both spatially and 
temporally, plasma plume is obtained. But this method produces a small amount of nanoparticles. 
Iron oxides and strontium ferrite (Shinde et al. 2000), TiO2
 (Harano et al. 2002), ZnO (Mintcheva 
et al. 2018), silver (Perito et al. 2016) and hydrogenated-silicon (Makimura et al. 2002) nanoparticles 
are synthesized by using pulsed laser ablation method. 
Figure 4. Schematic of Laser Ablation apparatus.Physical Methods for Synthesis of Nanoparticles 71
5. Laser pyrolysis
Nowadays, laser pyrolysis method is used for synthesis of nanoparticles. Here, in the pyrolysis 
chamber, the reactant gases (gaseous-phase precursors) can be introduced with carrier gases like 
helium or argon where the reactant gases meet the powerful laser beam (CO2
 laser in continuous 
mode). The high power laser beam (2400 W) generates elevated localized temperatures. As a 
result, the reactant gas decomposes, which collides and interacts with carrier gas. This triggers the 
nucleation and growth of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can be either allowed to grow and deposit on 
cooled substrate or collected by a catcher, which is equipped with a filter. Here, gas pressure is also 
the key factor in deciding particle size and particle distribution.
Although the gaseous precursors are used in laser pyrolysis synthesis, solid or liquid can be used 
in some cases but it involves safety issues, cost of precursor and availability. The liquid precursors 
with sufficiently high pressure can be delivered as vapors from a bubbler to the reaction zone as 
small droplets, which rapidly evaporate upon laser heating. 
Silicon-Carbide (Ershov et al. 2020), ceramic (D’Amato et al. 2013) and metallic tin-based 
nanoparticles (Dutu et al. 2015) are synthesized by laser pyrolysis.
6. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)
PVD is the coating technique based on the principle of vaporization of coating material. It involves 
the transfer of coating material on an atomic level under vacuum conditions. It is being widely 
used for coating on substrates and obtaining thin films. But the recent technical developments and 
advances in PVD technique lead to the use of PVD for synthesis of nanostructured coatings, nano￾thin films, multilayered nano-thin films and nanocomposites. Normally, the physical method used 
to generate vapor of coating material is either thermal evaporation or sputtering for deposition on 
the target substrate. Beside that cathodic arc, ion beam or pulsed laser can also be used for Physical 
Vapor Deposition. Sputtering is more suitable than thermal evaporation as it gives better bonding

strength with the substrate. The PVD follows three steps for synthesis of nanoparticles or nano thin 
films:
(a) The material which is to be deposited is firstly converted into vapor phase by using physical 
methods.
(b) The supersaturation of the vapor phase in an inert atmosphere promotes the condensation of 
metal nanoparticles.
(c) The condensation of vapor on substrate takes place to form nano thin film or consolidation of 
nanocomposite takes place by thermal treatment under inert atmosphere.
The PVD system consists of filaments or boats of refractory. This is made of metals like 
tungsten, tantalum and molybdenum. In this refractory, the materials which are to be evaporated 
are kept in crucibles. A PVD system needs reactive gas or an inert gas with proper pressure for 
collision with material vapor. It consists of a cold finger, which is connected to a cooling system on 
which clusters or nanoparticles get condensed. The device consists of scrapers, which are used to 
scrape nanoparticles and also a special arrangement-piston-anvil in which nanoparticle powder can 
be compacted. 
From high temperature boats of refractory, metals or high pressure metal oxides get evaporated 
or sublimated. It is observed that near to the boat, density of this evaporated material is notably 
high and their size normally found in nanometers. These evaporated atoms and clusters can collide 
with gas molecules and form larger size particles. These particles are forced to move towards the 
cold finger where they get condensed. Particle size and their distribution depends on the rate of 
evaporation, gas pressure maintained in the chamber and distance of source of evaporator from cold 
finger. The particles condensed on the central cooled rod can be scraped and consolidated with a 
special piston-anvil system to form a pallet. The gases like O2
, H2
 and NH3
 are used which works as 
reactive gas that can interact with evaporated materials and form oxide, nitride or hydride particles. 
After obtaining these particles, with appropriate post-treatments one can achieve the desired metal

compound or pure nanoparticles. The gas pressure in the deposition chamber plays a vital role in 
deciding size, shape and phase of evaporated material. 
7. Sputtering
In the sputtering method, vaporization of materials from the surface of the target (solid) is obtained 
by bombarding high energetic ions of an inert gas (Argon) on the target surface, which causes 
ejection of atoms and clusters. This ejected material of the target gets deposited on the substrate. 
Sputtering is mostly used for thin film deposition or for obtaining nano thin film on the substrate.
The sputtering method follows two important steps: the first step is the introduction of controlled 
inert gas (Ar) into the vacuum chamber and the second step involves electrically energizing the 
cathode in order to obtain self-sustaining plasma. The surface of the cathode exposed to the substrate 
acts as a target, which is actually a slab of material to be deposited on the substrate surface. The inert 
gas atoms may lose their electrons inside plasma and become positively charged ions. These ions 
are accelerated and directed to strike with sufficient kinetic energy onto the target. Here they lose 
energy to target atoms and cause the sputtering out of some target atoms/molecules in addition with 
clusters, ions and secondary electrons. The sputtered material constitutes a vapor stream. This vapor 
stream traverses the chamber and allows it to hit and stick to the substrate in order to form thin film 
or surface coating. During the process and before the deposition process, it is necessary to maintain 
high vacuum or ultra-high vacuum in the chamber.
The basic and commonly used methods for sputter depositions are Direct Current (DC) 
sputtering, Radio Frequency (RF) sputtering and Magnetron sputtering. The type of sputtering 
depends upon which type of power is used on the cathodes. For conductive materials, DC power is 
used whereas for non-conductive materials RF power is suitable. If the reaction gas like O2
 or N2 
is added to Ar gas, the resultant sputtering is known as reactive sputtering. Here with argon, ions 
of reaction gas are produced. These ions react with the sputtered layer atoms and form the reaction 
products, which can be deposited on the substrate. 
Figure 7. Schematic of Sputtering deposition.74 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
1. DC Sputtering
This is the simplest method of deposition. In this method, the sputter target is connected to the 
negative terminal of the power source and maintained at high negative voltage. The substrate is 
connected to the positive terminal of the power source or ground or kept floating. When the required 
pressure by the vacuum system is obtained in the chamber, inert gas (Ar) can be introduced at 
suitable pressure, normally less than 10 Pa. As soon as the required high potential is obtained across 
the anode and cathode, the cathode glows and glow discharge occurs. This results in plasma which 
contains electrons, ions, neutral atoms and even photons obtained due to collision. Some energetic 
electrons on impact with inert gas cause gas ionization. A sufficiently large number of ions are 
produced in the chamber, which get accelerated and cause the sputtering of the target. Further, the 
deposition of sputtered material on substrate is obtained. The material which is to be deposited on 
substrate normally decides whether substrate is to be heated or cooled.
2. RF Sputtering
In RF sputtering, AC modulation of power at radio frequencies is used across the terminals of anode 
and cathode, which alternatively reverses the polarities. This causes an oscillation in electrons, so a 
sufficient amount of gas ionization is possible. Target itself is biased to negative potential and hence 
working as cathode. In this sputtering, plasma formed tends to diffuse throughout the whole chamber 
rather than concentrating around the cathode or target as happens with DC sputtering. Although it 
is useful for many types of dielectric coating or insulating coatings, it has some disadvantages. The 
deposition rate in RF sputtering is observed to be less than DC sputtering. Another disadvantage 
is that the RF power is itself complicated as it requires a high voltage power supply and expensive 
advanced circuitry, which may cause additional overheating problems.
3. Magnetron Sputtering 
DC/RF Magnetron sputtering gives greater sputtering rate than conventional DC/RF sputtering. This 
sputtering rate can be obtained by providing an additional strong magnet in the DC/RF sputtering 
system. Here, both electric and magnetic fields acting on electrons make electrons move in helical 
paths and confine the electrons in the plasma near or at the target surface. These helical moving 
electrons may ionize more atoms in the gas. These helical moving confined electrons increase the 
plasma density and deposition rate. It prevents direct damage, which is possibly caused by direct 
impact of these electrons with substrate or the growing film on substrate. 
HIPIMS is High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering in which a train of short and intense 
pulses with low duty cycle is delivered to the cathode. During a pulse, a very high power creates very 
high dense plasma, which results in a large fraction of ionized sputtered atoms without overheating 
the target. HIPIMS produces high performance dense coatings with good adhesion, and a uniform 
film without droplets on complexed shaped substrates.
Copper (Jaiswal et al. 2015), gold (Terauchi et al. 1995) and flower-like tungsten (Acsente et al.
2015) nanoparticles are synthesized by Magnetron Sputtering.
8. Ion beam techniques or ion implantation
Ion implantation is one of the advanced techniques used for synthesis of nanomaterials. Ion 
implantation assembly typically consists of an ion source with ion gun, ion deflector with accelerator 
and target chamber. Amount of ions implanted (fluence) per square cm is called dose (ions/cm2
). 
In ion source with ion gun, ions of desired elements are produced and with specially designed ion 
gun, ions are ejected. In an ion deflector with an accelerator, ions get electrostatically accelerated 
and directed towards the target with high energy. In high vacuum target chamber, ions get implanted 
on the substrate. The low energy (less than 200 eV) as well high energy (few keV to hundreds of Physical Methods for Synthesis of Nanoparticles 75
keV) ions can be used to obtain nanoparticles. To synthesize nanoparticles, the typical ion beam 
energies used range from 50 to 150 keV with fluences in range from 1016 to 1018 ions/cm2
. It is 
observed that the concentration of implanted atoms which modifies surface composition of substrate 
increases as fluences increases (William and Poate 1984). The nanostructure modification (Avasthi 
and Pivin 2010) and shape-modification of patterned nanoparticles (Heo and Gwag 2015) can be 
possible by ion beam technique. Now, focused ion beam nanofabrication is a promising technique 
for fabrication of 3D nanostructures and devices (Li et al. 2021).

Chemical Methods for the 
Synthesis of Nanomaterials
Jagruti S. Suroshe
1. Introduction
As compared to physical methods, chemical methods provide better control over the characteristic 
properties of nanocrystallites by tuning the particle size, shape as well as surface modification 
of nanocrystallites and have been the subject of matter of few reviews and books (Burda et al. 
2005, Malik et al. 2010, Lalena et al. 2007). Chemical methods can be categorized as solid phase 
(mechanical attrition, mechanochemical synthesis), wet chemical or liquid phase (precipitation, 
micelles or micro-emulsion, solvothermal, electrochemical, sonochemical, microwave synthesis, 
liquid-liquid interface methods and sol-gel method) and vapor/gas phase processes (chemical vapor 
deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.). Among these processes, liquid phase methods are more relevant 
for the preparation of metal chalcogenides and hence they have been briefly discussed below. 
(i) Co-precipitation method 
This method involves precipitation of sparingly soluble products induced by chemical reactions 
such as hydrolysis, complexation, oxidation, reduction or by changing reaction conditions like 
temperature, concentration, pH, etc. These chemical reactions are governed by nucleation as well 
as the development process which decides the particle size and morphology of the products (Rane 
et al. 2018, La Mer and Johnson 1947, Schmidt et al. 2003). 
The products obtained from this method are mostly insoluble products obtained under high 
supersaturation conditions. A huge number of tiny particles will be formed in an important process 
known as nucleation. The properties, morphology and size of these products will be appreciably 
influenced by secondary operations like Ostwald ripening and aggregation. The supersaturation 
state required to persuade precipitation is generally the outcome of a chemical reaction (Rane et al. 
2018).

The conventional coprecipitation synthetic methods include: 
1. Oxides produced from polar and non-polar solutions. 
2. Formation of metal chalcogenides by using molecular precursors. 
3. Coprecipitation using microwave/ultrasonication 
4. Metals obtained using aqueous solutions, by reduction from organic solutions, electrochemical 
reduction and decay of metal-organic precursors. 
Among the earlier methods, this method is used for the synthesis of nanomaterials. However, the 
method has some advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include simple and fast preparation, 
low temperature, control over composition, homogeneity and particle size, non-polluting and 
energy-saving approach. The polymerization of the material may get influenced due to the existence 
of metallic precursors in the solution. This usually affects the specimens with unacceptable 
characteristics consisting of less described pore size. Moreover, the above perspective has restricted 
appropriateness to polymeric supports (White et al. 2009). 
Yazid and co-workers synthesized magnetic nanoparticles via the co-precipitation method for 
effective elimination of bulky metals from synthetic wastewater (Yazid and Joon 2019). Tinwala and 
co-authors prepared La2
Ce2
O7
 nanoparticles by co-precipitation method and obtained nanoparticles 
that were well characterized by using various characterization techniques like Thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA), Electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tinwala et al. 2014). 
(ii) Solvothermal/Hydrothermal method 
The solvothermal method has been a versatile technique to prepare inorganic materials either in 
non-polar solvent or in the polar solvent at elevated temperatures and pressures in a closed vessel 
and takes the benefit of increased diffusion of chemicals and solubility of inorganic compounds 
under these conditions (Rane et al. 2018). The method is addressed as solvothermal method or 
hydrothermal method depending on the medium (organic solvent or water) in which the reactions 
are carried out. However, the term solvothermal has also been used in the literature for heating 
precursors in presence of coordinating solvents. The method offers precise control on the size 
and appearance of the particles. By altering experimental conditions like duration of reaction, 
solvent, temperature, surfactant type as well as precursor type, these characteristics can be changed 
(Lu 2012). 
Suroshe et al. synthesized functionalized carbon nanotube/ZnO nanocomposites by solvothermal 
decomposition method and studied its capacitive behavior by coating it on glassy carbon electrode 
(Suroshe and Garje 2015). Palve et al. synthesized ZnS nanomaterials from complexes of Zinc(II) 
thiosemicarbazone and characterized by various characterization techniques (Palve and Garje 2011).
(iii) Sol-gel method 
Sol is a suspension of colloidal particles in a solution or liquid. When it is mixed with other liquids, 
it affects the development of an endless three-dimensional network known as ‘gel’. This method 
usually relates to the hydrolysis as well as condensation of alkoxide precursors or metal alkoxides, 
directing to the diffusion of oxides in a sol. Then the sol is free from solvent by removing it. More 
often, H2
O is served as a solvent, although the hydrolysis of precursors can be done using an 
acid or base. Acid catalysis gives rise to a polymeric gel; however, basic catalysis leads to the 
development of a colloidal gel (Lam et al. 2008). The properties of the final products get affected by 
major parameters such as the condensation and hydrolysis rates. Small particles can be observed at 
gradual as well as the higher governed rate of hydrolysis. Figure 1 demonstrates the route for sol-gel 
synthesis (Owens et al. 2016). As per the need for a particular application, various steps involved Chemical Methods for the Synthesis of Nanomaterials 79
in this process can be changed, elongated or eliminated entirely exclusive of gelation as well as 
solvation.
This process depends upon the appearance of the sol, i.e., if it is existing in the form of a solution 
or a suspension of fine particles (Wang 2020). The size of particles is dependent upon the pH, 
constitution of the solution as well as temperature. In this system, magnetic ordering can consider 
the obtained phases including the particle volume fraction together with the size distribution along 
with the dissipation of the particles (Tavakoli et al. 2007). For nanocomposites obtained by the gels, 
framework conditions, as well as the porosity of the material, are estimated by the rate of hydrolysis 
along with condensation of the gel precursors and additional redox reactions throughout the stages 
of gelling and successive heating (Tavakoli et al. 2007, Teja and Koh 2009). 
Yahaya and co-workers discussed the preparation of crystalline TiO2
 nanoparticles by the sol￾gel process. This process includes two major processes- hydrolysis and condensation. Precursors 
such as Ti[OCH(CH3
)2
]4
, (TTIP), TiCl3
, TiCl4
, TiBr4
 and Ti(OBu)4
, are more often used for the 
preparation of TiO2
 nanomaterials. These precursors are treated with water to carry out hydrolysis 
reactions and then on condensation, they form a 3-D network (Yahaya et al. 2017).

(iv) Template method
The template method is very popular for the preparation of functional materials with several 
nanostructures (Liang et al. 2010, Lou et al. 2008). This is an easy approach for the synthesis of 
nanomaterials by encouraging the target materials to extend as per the model of the templates. 
This scheme imparts a simple process for the preparation of nanostructures with expected shape 
as well as the size and has been broadly used in the fabrication of 1-dimensional nanostructures 
(Zhao et al. 2008). In most of the cases, templates introduced for the preparation can be categorized 
into two classes: (1) soft templates, which includes ligands, organogelators, polymers as well 
as surfactants, (2) hard templates that are either employed in the form of physical scaffolds for 
the adjacent deposition of expected coating substances or used as structure-specifying layout 
and as chemical reagents that interact with more reagents to fabricate appropriate nanomaterials 
(Fan et al. 2008). 
In the 1970s, this technique was first introduced by scientist Possin to synthesize nanowires 
(Possin 1970) and in the 1990s, Martin developed this methodology and proposed the word “template 
synthesis” (Martin 1994). The often-used templates consist of organized porous membranes 
developed with anodized Al2
O3
 (Murakami et al. 1999), silica (Kim et al. 2003), nanochannel glass 
(Berry et al. 1996) and ion-track-etched polymers (Chakarvarti and Vetter 1998). 
(v) Electrodeposition method
This method is interesting for forming a metallic layer through the cathodic reduction on the surface 
in polar otherwise non-polar solvents. Cathode used is the substrate substance that is dipped in a 
solution consisting of a metal salt to be coated. The solubilized metallic ions are sent towards the 
cathode followed by reduction to form metals (Anon n.d.). By using the electrodeposition method, 
Yang and co-authors introduced reduced graphene oxide on carbon fiber electrode to explore its 
response towards uric acid, dopamine and ascorbic acid. Figure 2 illustrates the synthesis of reduced 
graphene oxide/carbon fiber composite by electrodeposition method (Yang et al. 2014). With the 
help of data obtained from various studies, the authors concluded that this composite is an excellent 
electrode material for biochemical gadgets. 
The characteristic merits of the electrodeposition method are that it can allow the conformal 
coating of materials and one can simply manage the thickness of the coated layers (She et al. 2008).

colsurfa.2014.05.029.)Chemical Methods for the Synthesis of Nanomaterials 81
By controlling certain parameters like current, and potential, nanomaterials with desired morphology 
and required electrocatalytic properties can be synthesized. Experimental results reveal that the 
crystallite size of nanostructures at greater overvoltage is affected by substrate pore diameters to a 
small extent. However, this impact is huge at lower overvoltage (Serp et al. 2002). Figure 3 below 
presents a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of nano electrodeposited Ni-Co at 80 mA/cm2
(Paul et al. 2014).

(vi) Micro-emulsion method 
The method involves the isotropic dispersions of two immiscible liquids like oil with water which 
can be maintained by surfactants (cationic, anionic or neutral) placed at the interface of oil with 
water. They can be either water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W) micro-emulsions. A micelle is 
a cluster of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid where the hydrophilic head point towards the 
surrounding solvent and the hydrophobic tail is directed inwards to the core of the micelle (oil-in￾water). The micelle is referred to as reverse or inverse micelle if the hydrophilic moiety of surfactant 
points inward to the micelle’s center (water-in-oil) (Rane et al. 2018, Pinisetty et al. 2011). 
The micro-emulsions allow size-choice development of the particles in droplets of water 
captured in a hydrocarbon solvent. The characteristic properties are chiefly directed by the water￾to-surfactant molar ratio. The size and shape of a micelle is a role of the surfactant molecule’s 
geometry, concentration, along with the pH and ionic strength of the solution (Lu 2012). Finnie 
and co-workers proposed a system for the synthesis of SiO2
 nanoparticles in an acidic and alkaline 
environment, which are shown below in Figure 4. SiO2
 nanoparticles were prepared by interaction 
of tetramethyl orthosilicate inside the droplets of water of a water-in-oil microemulsion at 
pH 1.05 (acidic) along with pH 10.85 (basic). It was observed that with a change in pH from acidic 
to basic, the hydrolysis reaction of tetramethyl orthosilicate slows down. Under basic conditions, 
spheres of ~ 11 nm were formed whereas in an acidic medium ~ 5 nm spheres were obtained which 
was highly uniform in size (Finnie et al. 2007). The development of particles in microemulsions is 
controlled by a mechanism similar to that of colloidal suspensions: nucleation with the development 
of particles takes place by either ripening aggregation or coagulation.
(vii) Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) 
In this method, vapors of the suitable precursors are put forward into a preheated CVD apparatus 
where the vapors are adsorbed and thermally decomposed or reacted with other vapors present in 
the reactor to deposit the required material. Nucleation can either occur in the gaseous phase or on 
the substrate. In the former case, it is homogeneous while in the latter it is heterogeneous (Martínez 
and Prieto 2007). Figure 5 shown below illustrates the basic apparatus required for chemical vapor 
deposition at the laboratory level for coating (Choy 2003). 82 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

CVD has reactions proceeding the nucleation and development of nanomaterials from the 
vapor-phase precursors. In the CVD process, at higher temperatures and below nonequilibrium 
conditions, gas-phase reactions with the development of particles occur. This operation is chiefly 
related to vapor-phase reactions, nucleation via supersaturated vapors to obtained particles, 
particle development through vapor condensation and/or heterogeneous chemical interactions, 
agglomeration via particle-particle collisions promoted through Brownian motion with coalescence Chemical Methods for the Synthesis of Nanomaterials 83
or sintering amongst particles. The size of particles between 5–200 nm can be manufactured with 
the help of this method. Generally, argon or nitrogen can be used as a carrier gas, which helps to 
carry the volatilized precursors across a heated reaction compartment. A tube-shaped furnace can be 
employed as a heat source with temperatures up to 1500 K. Carbonyls, chlorides and metal-organic 
compounds are generally utilized as precursors. Low-temperature synthesis leads to the formation 
of tiny, porous, and in many examples, glassy nanomaterials. Nucleation of oxides is effectively 
rapid because of oxidation as well as large concentrations of the precursor vapors. 
Salifairus and Rusop synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using camphor oil above ferrocene 
and aluminum isopropoxide (C9
H21O3
Al) catalyst by the CVD method. They varied deposition 
temperature from 700ºC to 900ºC and obtained CNTs were well characterized by various 
characterization techniques (Salifairus and Rusop 2013). Manawi et al. also discussed a review 
paper that includes the preparation of several carbon nanomaterials like fullerenes, CNTs, carbon 
nano-onion (CNO), carbide-derived carbon (CDC), carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and graphene by the 
CVD method (Manawi et al. 2018). 
(viii) Polyol method 
Out of several methods, to synthesize nanoparticles in solution, the ‘polyol method’ is simple and can 
be easily set up; therefore, it is of commercial significance. In this process, the polyol is mentioned 
as a diol, mostly a 1,2-diol like ethylene glycol along with their derivatives, di-, tri-, tetra- till 
poly(ethylene glycol), represented as EG, DEG, TEG, TTEG, PEG, etc., respectively, and also to 
dissimilar isomers of propanediol, butanediol, pentanediol, etc. Substances consisting of higher 
than two –OH groups like glycerol, carbohydrates and pentaerythritol are also viewed like polyols. 
The availability of multiple hydroxy groups leads to increase in boiling point and viscosities, which 
further gives unique properties like reducing and coordinating properties. These properties are very 
much helpful for the synthesis of nanoparticles for tuning their size and shape (Fievet et al. 2018).
Murray et al. at IBM synthesized FePt nanoparticles by polyol method. Co-reduction of 
iron pentacarbonyl and Platinum (II) bis (acetylacetonate) at elevated temperatures gives FePt 
nanoparticles of size 3 nm. Monodispersed magnetic face-centered cubic (fcc) (A1 phase) FePt 
nanoparticles were synthesized using the same procedure followed by post-synthetic annealing at 
500ºC to generate face-centered tetragonal (fct) (L10 phase) FePt crystals (Sun et al. 2000, Yu et al. 
2008). Several advantages offered by polyol medium are shown below in Figure 6. Polyol medium 
has multiple advantages such as high boiling point, reducing medium, high viscosity and its capacity 
to coordinate metal precursors.
The high boiling point of polyol medium helps to carry out synthesis at comparatively high 
temperature, confirming crystalline materials can be manufactured. Polyol medium is a reducing 
medium that prevents the oxidation of synthesized metal particles. It can also coordinate metal 
precursors and particle surfaces, which further help to minimize coalescence. The high viscosity 
of the polyol medium facilitates a diffusion-controlled regime for the growth of particles, which 
ultimately results in structures with controlled morphology (Fievet et al. 2018). FePd nanoparticles 
can be synthesized with the help of stabilizers such as oleic acid and oleylamine (Chen and Nikles 
2002). 
(ix) Sonochemical method 
Currently, ultrasound has been utilized for the preparation of nanoparticles. It supplies strong 
mechanical forces, which help to disperse reactants easily. In the course of sonication of liquid, 
cavitation occurs from the implosive fall down of bubbles, which further leads to the formation of 
localized hot spots around 5000 K and a lifetime of some nanoseconds or less than that. Therefore, 
chemical reactions usually occur inside the bubbles. By controlling the ultrasonic irradiation power, 84 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
the shape, as well as size of the nanomaterials, can be governed. A setup for the sonochemical 
method is illustrated below in Figure 7 (Hujjatul Islam et al. 2019). 
The sonochemical method is simple, operating conditions are ambient and someone can easily 
manage the particle size of desired nanomaterials by introducing precursors of different concentrations 
in the solution and also by controlling the power of ultrasonic irradiation. Sivakumar and coauthors 
synthesized nanocrystals of zinc ferrite with the help of the precursors of Zn and Fe acetates along with 
rapeseed oil (Sivakumar et al. 2006). Cao and coworkers prepared nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite 
particles with the help of ultrasonic precipitation process using Ca(NO3
)2
 and ammonium dihydrogen 
phosphate as source materials and carbamide (NH2
CONH2
) as precipitating agent (Cao et al. 2005). 
Bastami et al. prepared Hausmannite (Mn3
O4
) nanoparticles by the sonochemical method in different 
media under ambient conditions without the addition of any additives. The obtained nanoparticles 
were well characterized by various characterization techniques. With the change in media, different 
shapes and sizes of nanomaterials were observed. Using mineral oil, diamond shape nanomaterials 
with a size ~ 50 nm were observed whereas in vegetable oil, spherical nanoparticles with a size of ~ 
7 nm were observed (Bastami and Entezari 2010). 
2. Conclusion 
In the present chapter, we focused on various chemical methods to synthesize nanomaterials. Every 
method has certain advantages and some disadvantages. Depending upon the nanomaterial which 
is to be synthesized, a suitable method can be adopted which helps to synthesize material with 
good yield; it will be also easy to control the shape and size by changing certain parameters. Here, 
we successfully demonstrated co-precipitation, solvothermal, sol-gel, template, electrodeposition,

1. Introduction
Our nature is full of mysteries which have become a constant source of curiosity and information 
for us. Nature has figured out how to make the most effective miniaturized practical products in 
ingenious and stylish ways. Living creatures have devised ingenious ways to produce a wide range 
of inorganic structures through evolution. Nature knows how to create highly advanced materials 
that are designed and built to perform complex biological functions as efficiently as possible (Lloyd 
and Lovley 2001). One such mystery is Quantum Sciences, where the natural operations occur at 
atomic and sub-atomic levels. It is at this atomic level that the boundaries of Physics, Chemistry 
and Biology have merged together. At this level, most of the physical laws and chemical principles 
are transformed to a great scope, giving materials unbelievable properties, which are exploited in 
material fabrication. Nanotechnology has emerged as a versatile branch of material science which 
deals with the properties of material at nanometric dimensions (1–100 nm). Nanoparticles of one 
or more than one dimensions, having the size of 100 nm or less, have enthralled all with their 
peculiar and interesting properties, as well as a multitude of applications that outperform their bulk 
equivalents (Daniel and Astruc 2004, Kato 2013). Biology, agriculture, food, telecommunications, 
cosmetics, electronics, pharmacy, and biomedical and food devices are among these fields. 
Nanoparticles, especially metallic nanoparticles (MtNPs), have risen to prominence because of 
their unique physicochemical characters and biotechnological applications (Slavin et al. 2017, Khan 
et al. 2017).
Physical synthesis, such as thermal decomposition, radiation aided, electrochemical, 
sonochemical, and microwave aided methods, as well as chemical synthesis, such as reduction of 
liquids, photochemical and chemical reactions in reverse micelles, are all choices for nanoparticle 
synthesis (Punjabi et al. 2015). While both chemical and physical methods possess an advantage 
that the nanoparticle shape and size can be regulated, they have a variety of disadvantages, including

the use of poisonous chemicals, high synthesis costs, and poor yield. MtNPs have hazardous 
chemicals bound to their surfaces, which may have harmful implications in biomedical applications 
(Mukherjee et al. 2013, 2015, Patra et al. 2015, Ovais et al. 2018a). 
With growing concerns of using physical and chemical methods, research has moved towards the 
green chemistry route or biological synthesis of MtNPs using various types of microorganisms and 
plants. The biological method of MtNP production is less expensive, biocompatible, nontoxic, eco￾friendly, and comparatively simple (Figure 1) (Mukherjee et al. 2013, 2015, Patra et al. 2015, Ovais 
et al. 2018a). However, this process results in the generation of polydisperse nanoparticles, due to 
its diverse photochemistry (Salunke et al. 2014, Ovais et al. 2016) (Figure 1). In this chapter, we 
will be dealing with the various green eco-friendly mechanisms using microorganisms and plants to 
produce nanoparticles.
2. Metal Nanoparticles’ Synthesis by Microorganisms
Haefeli identified a bacterium isolated from a silver mine as Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259, 
efficient in synthesizing silver (Ag) nanoparticles, as the first bacteria capable of synthesizing silver 
nanoparticles in 1984 (Haefeli et al. 1984, Venkataraman et al. 2011, Klaus et al. 1999). Nanoparticle 
biosynthesis utilizing microbial strains such as actinomycetes, microbes, yeast, fungi, marine algae, 
and viruses has attracted a lot of interest in the field of green and eco-friendly nanotechnology in 
recent years (Singh et al. 2006). Microorganisms serve as highly effective nanofactories for the 
environmentally safe and low-cost production of a wide range of metal nanoparticles, including 
gold (Au), silver, copper (Cu), and palladium (Pd), as well as metallic oxides like titanium oxide 
(TiO2
) and zinc oxide (ZnO). Nanotubes, nanoconjugates, nanorods, and nanowires are examples 
of nanoscale materials that come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and types (Albanese et al. 2003). 
Metal nanoparticles have applications in a variety of areas and are showing biocompatibility with 
minimal toxicity, making them exceptional drug delivery devices and sensor carriers in diagnostic 
instruments (Sadowski 2010). The reduction of metal in its elemental state, which can either 
be collected intracellularly or extracellularly, is the key process for microorganism-mediated 
nanoparticle synthesis (Ahmad et al. 2007, Kalimuthu et al. 2008, Sadowski et al. 2008, Saifuddin 
et al. 2009, Jain et al. 2011, Janardhanan et al. 2013).

2.1 Bacteria
Bacteria and actinomycetes have evolved to inhabit ecological niches consisting of heavy metal 
concentrations. Thus, similar mechanisms to tolerate these metals have been selected across different 
bacterial genera and for different metals (Thakur 2006). Bacteria, which are immune to metals and 
thrive on them, perform an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of metallic ions. Since 
the oxidation state of a heavy metal affects its solubility and toxicity, this is a vital consequence of 
microbial heavy metal resistance (Spain 2003, Malekzadeh et al. 2002). Bacteria and actinomycetes 
have developed a variety of strategies to combat the toxic effects of metals and metalloids, including 
aggregation, tolerance, and even biomethylation and transformation to reduce their bioavailability 
and toxicity.
Metal speciation and transport in the atmosphere are highly influenced by bacterial behaviour.
Different bacteria have different reactions to toxic substances (Thakur 2006). In the 
rhizosphere, there is increased microbial activity, which could lead to increased trace element 
aggregation, transformation, degradation, and biomethylation. Biosorption, sulphide deposition, and 
biotransformation are also established methods for removing harmful heavy metals or metalloids 
from wastewaters by microbes in the rhizosphere (reduction, volatilization). This mechanism 
is reliant on the cell’s metabolic function, as defined by its intrinsic biochemical and structural 
properties, physiological and/or genetic adaptation, environmental changes in metal requirements, 
availability, and toxicity (Cha and Cooksey 1991). Temperature, pH, and biomass concentrations all 
have an effect on live cells’ ability to extract metallic ions from aqueous medium (Chen and Ting 
1995).
Metal tolerance in microbes is mediated by phosphate, carbonate, and/or sulphide precipitation, 
volatilization through methylation or ethylation, physical exclusion of electronegative components 
in membranes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), energy-dependent metal efflux 
systems, and intracellular sequestration (Gadd 1990, Silver 1996). Protecting a human cell from 
the toxic effects of the high concentrations of heavy metals is one of the most difficult challenges it 
faces. By altering the metal ion’s redox state, by reduction or the creation of non-toxic complexes 
such as sulphides and oxides, these effects may be eliminated. The eventual destiny of these metal 
ions is for them to be converted to a neutral oxidation state and then for each atom to be fabricated 
into nanoscale particles (Silver 1996).
The intracellular and extracellular methods have been used for metal nanoparticles’ 
synthesis (Figure 2). Extracellular biosynthesis takes place outside the bacterial membrane using 
techniques like 
(a) utilizing bacterial biomass, 
(b) utilizing bacterial culture’s supernatant and 
(c) utilizing extracts free from cell debris. 
Synthesis of nanoparticles is favoured, extracellularly over intracellular one, since it does not 
require complicated downstream processing (Singh et al. 2013). These nanoparticles have been used 
in a number of uses, the bulk of which are biomedical in nature. 
Beveridge’s group in 1980 showed that bacteria can synthesize gold nanoparticles and that 
the cell wall was the site of metal deposition in Bacillus subtilis (Beveridge and Murray 1980). 
His group confirmed that on incubation of bacterial cells with Au3+ ions, nano sized gold particles 
were precipitated within the cells (Southam and Beveridge 1996, Forty and Beveridge 2000). 
Similar results were obtained by Nair and Pradeep when they incubated lactobacillus strain isolated 
from butter milk (Nair and Pradeep 2002). They showed that lactic acid bacteria from the whey 
of buttermilk, when mixed with gold and silver ions together, could form alloys of Au and Ag. 
Nanoparticles of gold biosynthesized (AuNPs) by Rhodopseudomonas capsulata and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa have been studied and it was seen that pH does perform a crucial role in the shape and Bionanofabrication: A Green Approach towards Nanoparticle Synthesis using Plants and Microbes 91
size of AuNPs. At pH 6, AuNPs with diameters having a range from 20 to 80 nm were developed 
(Pourali et al. 2017, Singh and Kundu 2014). All metal nanoparticles produced have a size gap, 
which may be due to the nanoparticles being shaped at different times. Due to restrictions related 
to particles nucleating within species and released outside the cell, the size of nanoparticles may be 
restricted (Oza et al. 2012a).
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized in the intracellular periplasmic space 
by Bacillus sp. (Klaus et al. 1999). In one report, two separate isolated strains of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa were utilized to biosynthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), resulting in AuNPs of 
various sizes (Pugazhenthiran et al. 2009). Rhodopseudomonas capsulata was used to create AuNPs 
that were spherical (10–50 nm) and triangular plate (50–400 nm) (He et al. 2007). Serratia ureilytica 
was used to produce ZnO nanoflowers, which were then impregnated into cotton fabrics, resulting 
in antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and E. coli (Dhandapani et al. 2014). It was noticed that 
Lactobacillus plantarum was utilized to facilitate ZnO nanoparticles’ biosynthesis (Selvarajan and 
Mohanasrinivasan 2013). Aeromonas hydrophilais was used to biosynthesize ZnO nanoparticles, 
which were then tested for antimicrobial properties (Jayaseelan et al. 2012). Halomonas elongate 
developed triangular shaped nanoparticles of CuO, which were screened for antimicrobial action 
against E. coli and S. aureus (Rad et al. 2018). Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles having 
a diameter of 29 nm were synthesized by Bacillus cereus. These particles had a dose-dependent anti￾cancer activity on the 3T3 and MCF-7 cell lines (Fatemi et al. 2018). Bacterial strains were used to 
make bimetallic Ag-Au nanostructures (Nair and Pradeep 2002).
2.2 Algae
Marine algae, including both micro and macroalgae, have invited substantial attention in the field 
of nanomanufacturing. Microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris and Spirogyra insignis, as well as 
macroalgae such as Sargassum wightii and Chondrus crispus, have been used to biosynthesize 
noble metallic nanoparticles having elevated antimicrobial potential and biocompatibility, which 
can be used in biomedical tool design, drug distribution, catalysis, and electronics (Govindaraju 
et al. 2009, Kahzad and Salehzadeh 2020, Castro et al. 2013). Nucleation, regulation of element, and 
stabilization of nanoparticle shape, facilitated by enzymes in the algal cell, and biological reduction 
Figure 2. Various bacterial mechanisms for heavy metal resistance.92 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
of metallic ions by the functional enzymes are among the mechanisms defined for nanoparticle 
biosynthesis using these microalgae (Castro et al. 2013).
Scenedesmus sp. was utilized in the biosynthesis of Ag nanoparticles, which resulted in the 
development of AuNPs with sizes ranging from 3 to 35 nanometers within living cells.
Nucleation points and size stability are thought to be aided by an assortment of stabilizing 
and reducing agents. The antimicrobial potential of these Ag nanoparticles against Streptococcus 
mutans and Escherichia coli was excellent (Jena et al. 2014). Desmodesmus sp. was used to make 
silver nanoparticles of sizes varying from 10 to 30 nanometers. Proteins, polysaccharides, phenolic, 
and polyphenols compounds have also been implicated in the regulation of particle dimension and 
stabilization.
Antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella sp. was observed, as 
well as antifungal potential against C. parapsilosis (Öztürk 2019). The synthesis of AgNPs was 
performed using Fusarium oxysporum cell free culture filtrates, and the results revealed that the 
highest nanoparticle synthesis rate occurred during the stationary step, when the extracellular enzyme 
nitrate reductase activity was at its peak. In addition, raising the C:N ratio activated the nitrate 
reductase enzyme, resulting in the development of small AgNPs with a narrow size distribution 
(Hamedi et al. 2017). Laminaria japonica (Kim et al. 2016), Gelidium amansii (Pugazhendhi et al. 
2018), Sargassum plagiophyllum (Dhas et al. 2014) algal extracts were used to biosynthesize silver 
nanoparticles. The combination of aqueous silver nitrate with all three algal extracts resulted in the 
development of 50 nm spherical AgNPs.
Extracts of Chaetomorpha linum resulted in the development of AgNP clusters ranging in size 
from 3–44 nm. The addition of aqueous AgNO3 solutions to entire living cultures of wild type and 
cell wall deficient C. reinhardtii strains resulted in the creation of round-shaped particles having a 
diameter of less than 10 nm that crystallized in a face centered cubic (FCC) cell lattice structure 
(Rahman et al. 2019).
Tetraselmis kochinensis was applied for the intracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles with 
measurements between the range from 5 to 35 nm and a spherical shape. The metal ions were 
reduced by enzymes present in the cell wall more than anywhere else, presumably suggesting that 
they were reduced by cell wall enzymes rather than elsewhere (Senapati et al. 2012). Algal extracts 
of Stoechospermum marginatum (Rajathi et al. 2012), and Galaxaura elongata (Abdel-Raouf 
et al. 2017) were used for the synthesis of gold nanometal. Within the range of 3–95 nm, both 
extracts gave rise to circular, hexagonal, and triangular forms, with all particles exhibiting strong 
antibacterial activity. Biosynthesis of AuNPs was also done using Chlorella pyrenoidusa extract. 
The results showed that stable particles with sizes of 25–30 nm formed. The presence of nitrate 
reductase, which converts auric ions to AuNPs, was indicated by the substantial decrease in nitrate 
reductase production (Oza et al. 2012b).
Sargassum bovinum has also been used in the biosynthesis of palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs). 
The bioreduction of Pd2+ ions resulted in octahedral PdNPs with a size range of 5–10 nm. As a 
hydrogen peroxide tracker, these PdNPs perform admirably (Momeni and Nabipour 2015). The 
development of spherical PdNPs of 5–20 nm was achieved through a one-step biological synthesis 
of PdNPs that make use of Chlorella vulgaris. At room temperature, the reduction of Pd2+ ions 
into PdNPs took just 10 minutes. The amide and polyol groups found in the algal extract serve as 
reducing and stabilizing agents, according to FTIR spectra (Arsiya et al. 2017). Extracts of Padina 
tetrastromatica and Turbinaria conoides were used as bioreducers to make zinc oxide nanoparticles 
(ZnO NPs). The role of different functional groups in the development of ZnO NPs was indicated 
by FTIR analysis of the extract. The antibacterial activity of the crystalline particles obtained was 
rectangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal in shape, with a size range of 90–120 nm (Shanmugam 
2018). Sargassum muticum extract was used to make hexagonal ZnO NPs with a diameter of 
30–60 nm. The results show that ZnO NPs have apoptotic, antiangiogenic, and cytotoxic effects Bionanofabrication: A Green Approach towards Nanoparticle Synthesis using Plants and Microbes 93
at both concentrations and incubation times, indicating that they could be used as a cancer therapy 
complement (Sanaeimehr et al. 2018).
Diatoms are algae that can be found in the sea or in some other wet area. They are unicellular, 
with a living component within an amorphous silica shell. Diatoms can range in length from 20 to 
200 metres. Polycondensation is prevented by absorbing silicic acid [Si(OH)4
] within the cell, which 
is bound to the cofactor. Silicic acid is stored in the Golgi bodies of cells. Transport vesicles are 
made of silica. Vesicles are phospholipid bilayers that can absorb a solution or water and aggregate 
to form silica deposition vesicles (SDV), an organism’s mineralized portion (Kulkarni 2015).
The procedures behind biological mineralization or biomineralization, or the deposition of 
inorganic minerals in living organisms, have been extensively studied in order to create novel 
nanomaterials. Diatoms are unicellular microalgae made up of frustules, which are biomineralized 
silica cell walls. Diatom frustules have a 3D-porous micro-nanostructure with a strongly periodic 
and hierarchical morphology (pennate and centric). Mechanical defense, biological defenses, 
filtration, UV protection for DNA, and light harvesting optimization are some of the hypotheses 
regarding their natural functions (Aguirre et al. 2018, Fuhrmann et al. 2004, Losic et al. 2009).
The diatoms have several openings (pores and slits) from which molecules are constantly 
exchanged with the atmosphere.
The complex patterns and symmetries are unique to each species and are dictated by genetics 
(Pickett-Heaps et al. 1990). It has been determined which organic molecules are needed for the 
construction of these diatom walls. Under moderate physiological conditions, diatom silica walls 
reach a high degree of complexity and hierarchical structure. As a result, the biological processes 
that produce patterned biosilica are of interest to the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology. From 
their unique interactions with silaffins and silica, diatoms successfully process silica.
Diatom frustules have many benefits over comparable synthetic mesoporous silica compounds, 
such as MCM-4, including greater biocompatibility, lower toxicity, and ease of purification (Kröger 
et al. 2002). The optical and optoelectronic properties of diatom frustules are also fascinating 
(Fuhrmann et al. 2004, Mazumder et al. 2010). The richness of silanol (Si-OH) groups makes 
the surface of diatoms readily functionalize (also in vivo), enabling maximum use of structural 
nanopatterning capacity (Li et al. 2014).
Using diatoms to synthesize nanoparticles is a rapidly expanding research area with the goal 
of fully utilizing the novel properties of diatom frustules, as well as the tremendous ability of the 
cellular pathway for silica biomineralization, to produce novel functionalized nanomaterials for 
evolving applications in sensing, photonics, and drug delivery (Panwar and Dutta 2019). The 
inclusion of the xanthophyll pigment fucoxanthin is another feature of diatom frustule. Many 
reports have emphasized the successful function of fucoxanthin as a metal ion photo-reducing agent 
in the stabilization of silver nanoparticles. In vitro antimicrobial activity of these silver nanoparticles 
against Bacillus stearothermophilus, Streptococcus mutans, and E. coli was found (Jena et al. 2015) 
and their possible utilization in detecting dissolved ammonia in water samples was checked using 
optical chemosensing (Chetia et al. 2017). Natural silicification was used to produce functionalized 
biogenic silica (frustules) of 100–200 m size using Coscinodiscus wailesii (Li et al. 2014) and 
frustules were updated with murine monoclonal antibody UN1 using Coscinodiscus concinnus Wm 
(De Stefano et al. 2009). These biogenic silica with photoluminescence activity may be used in the 
application of immunosensors.
The extracts of Cosinodiscus argus and Nitzschia soratensis were used to create a multi-layered 
box series of biogenic silica (frustules) that were bio-mineralized with purified primary rabbit IgG. 
These functionalized frustules will then be used as a fluorophore-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG 
detection optical immunochip (Kamińska et al. 2017). Pseudostaurosira trainori extracts were used 
to make functionalized biogenic silica (frustules) that were bio-mineralized and integrated with Au 
nanoparticles. These 4–5 m frustules can be applied in a range of immunosensing functions as well
(Zhen et al. 2016).94 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
3. Plants
Plant components for nanoparticle manufacturing have a number of benefits, including ease of 
preparing, packaging, cost-effectiveness, accelerated growth, reproducible, robust components, 
environmental friendliness, the avoidance of harsh and poisonous chemicals, and zero environmental 
pollution (Lade and Shanware 2020). Plant-mediated silver nanoparticle synthesis outperforms 
chemical and physical approaches and can be readily increased in quantity for maximum production.
In 2003, a paper on plant-facilitated synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Alfalfa (Medicago 
sativa) was published, marking the beginning of plant-mediated nanotechnology. AgNPs have been 
synthesised from a variety of plant components, including the stem, root, bark, seed, fruit, peel, 
callus, flower, and leaves (Rajeshkumar and Bharath 2017).
Extracts of black and green tea waste were applied to make gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and 
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The resulting nanoparticles were found to be stable and to be in the 
nanoscale range, with AuNPs measuring 10 nm and AgNPs measuring 30 nm (Onitsuka et al. 2019). 
The synthesized AgNPs had a size distribution ranging from 25 to 85 nm, with an average particle 
size of 53 nm, and a C. sinensis (red tea leaves) extract was also used to create monodispersed 
AgNPs.
Furthermore, it was discovered that the diameter of a large group of particles was more than 
45 nm (Pluta et al. 2017). The starch content in some plants has also been attributed to reduction 
and formation of stable nanometals. Rumex dentatus (Toothed dock) plant extract not only reduced 
Ag+
 ions but also formed stabilized AgNPs. The particles were in the range of 5–30 nm, enveloped 
by a thin layer of organic substance, which is characteristic of AgNPs synthesized by plant extracts 
(El-Shahaby et al. 2013). To synthesise AuNPs, leaf extracts of Syzygium cumini (Java Plum) and 
Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar Periwinkle) were used, with the synthesis taking just 15 and 
10 minutes, respectively (Lal and Nayak 2012). Plant extracts have also been discovered to have 
a shape-directing effect on metal nanoparticles, in addition to being easy to synthesise. Single 
crystalline gold nanotriangles were biosynthesized by changing the volume of Aloe vera extract and 
the carbonyl compounds contained in the extract (Chandran et al. 2006). Water soluble antioxidants, 
polyphenols (flavonoids), are abundant in plant leaf extract (Pandey and Rizvi 2009).
Green tea extract was recently used to test the cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of Ag+
 ions’ 
reduction and AgNP biosynthesis. The formulation and stabilisation of AgNPs seemed to be 
mediated by polyphenolic compounds such as catechins found in the extract of C. sinensis, which 
serve as capping and reducing agents (Rolim et al. 2019). The hydroxyl and ketonic groups in 
phenolic compounds are responsible for metal binding and the chelate effect (Saxena et al. 2012).
Rutile TiO2 NPs with sizes ranging from 20 to 45 nm are synthesized without the use of a 
surfactant, mould, or capping agent using the root extract of Euphorbia heteradena Jaub. The 
hydroxyl groups of phenolics present in root extract are liable for the reduction of TiO(OH)2
 and 
also act as capping ligands to the surfaces of TiO2
NPs, according to FTIR spectroscopic analysis of 
the extract (Nasrollahzadeh and Sajadi 2015a). Another phenolic agent, rosmarinic acid, was used 
as a bioreductant for the rapid synthesis of polydispersed, spherical AgNPs in the Coleus aromaticus
leaf extract (Vanaja et al. 2013). The strong nucleophilic property of the aromatic rings, rather than 
ideal chelating groups within the molecule, is linked to the chelating ability of phenolic compounds. 
Active oxygen molecules can scavenge directly from phenolic compounds like flavonoids.
Flavonoids have antioxidant properties, which means they donate electrons or hydrogen 
atoms to other molecules. Flavonoids and other biochemical agents, which are present in the 
F. benghalensis (Banyan) leaf extract, are not only the source of reducing the AuNPs but also 
provide the anti-agglomeration ability to nanoparticles (Singh and Jain 2014). Without the use of 
any additional reducing agents, leaf extracts of Withania coagulans (Vegetable rennet) (Atarod et al. 
2016) and Tabebuia berteroi (Pink trumpet flower) (Vellaichamy and Periakaruppan 2016) reduced 
Fe3+, Pd2+, and Ag+
 ions to nanometals. The role of flavonoids in the leaf extracts is confirmed by Bionanofabrication: A Green Approach towards Nanoparticle Synthesis using Plants and Microbes 95
FTIR analysis, which not only reduce metallic ions but also serve as stabilizing and capping agents. 
The possible mechanism of palladium nanoparticle (PdNP) formation is given as follows (Atarod 
et al. 2016) -
nFlOH + Pd+2 → nFlO (radical) + nPd0
nFlO (Radical) + Pd+2 → nFlOX + nPd0
 (Nucleation)
nPd0
 + Pd+2 → Pdn
+2 (Growth)
Pdn
+2 + Pdn
+2 → Pd2n
+2n
(Pd2n
+2n)n
 + (FlOH)n
 → Palladium NZV
Flavonol antioxidants such as epicatechin, catechin, and their polymeric derivatives were 
discovered to reduce Pd2+ and Cu2+ ions in Theobroma cocoa L. seed extract, via the hydrogen 
donation potential of phenolic antioxidants during a radical mechanism. This culminated in the green 
synthesis of stable Pd/CuO NPs in aqueous media. The particles were 40 nm in size on average, 
with a thin layer of phytochemicals on the nanocomposite that avoids particle agglomeration 
(Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2015). Ambrosia maritima (Coastal Ragweed) aqueous leaves’ extract was 
used to biosynthesize AgNPs by reducing silver nitrate (AgNO3).
The transmission electron microscope was used to classify the biosynthesized AgNPs, which 
revealed they were circular in shape and ranged in size from 25 to 50 nm. The presence of a secondary 
metabolite, sesquiterpene lactone, and flavonoids in the synthesis and stabilization of these AgNPs 
is suggested by FTIR study of the extract (El-Kemary et al. 2016). Under surfactant-free conditions, 
Ginkgo biloba L. (Maidenhair tree) leaf extract was used as a stabilizing and reducing agent in the 
green synthesis of Cu nanoparticles (CuNPs) in the 15 to 20 nm size range. According to an FTIR 
analysis, the presence of flavonoid and other phenolics in the crude extract of Ginkgo biloba L., 
especially quercetin, may be responsible for metal ion reduction and the formation of metal 
nanoparticles (Nasrollahzadeh and Sajadi 2015b). The leaf extract of Psidium guajava (Common 
guava) was used to generate spherical and stable silver nanoparticles in less than 10 minutes. The 
extract’s organic molecule content was utilized as a green AgNP capping and reducing agent. 
Quercetin-3-O—Dxylopyranosid Rutin, isoquercitrin, avicularin, quercetin-3-O—L-arabinoside, 
quercitrin, quercetin, and kaempferol were included in HPLC study, which may be responsible for 
the Ag+
 ions reduction. Synthesized AgNPs had a typical particle size of 15–20 nm and had excellent 
antibacterial efficacy (Wang et al. 2018). To make AgNPs, researchers used an aqueous extract of 
Lagerstroemia speciosa (Pride of India) leaves. We were able to obtain spherical AgNPs with an 
average size of 12 nm and strong antibacterial action.
FTIR research was used to look at the potential biomolecules involved in reduction and 
synthesis. The spectrum showed peak at C-X stretching, which is a distinctive trait for alkyl 
halide functional groups, which may act as capping and reducing agents for the creation of silver 
nanoparticle (Saraswathi et al. 2017). The electrostatic exchanges between proteins in plant material 
extract and silver ions have also been suggested as a mechanism for Ag bioreduction.
Proteins reduce Ag+
 ions, causing secondary formation changes and the formation of Ag nuclei. 
Silver nuclei are formed as Ag+
 ions are reduced and accumulate at the nuclei, resulting in the 
creation of AgNPs (Rajeshkumar and Bharath 2017). Within 72 hours, silver ions were reduced in 
the peels of Punica granatum L. fruit, yielding AgNPs with a scale of 5–50 nm. The peel extract’s 
proteins and amino acids formed a coating around the AgNPs, resulting in stable nanoparticles 
(Al-Othman Monira et al. 2017). The amino and carbonyl groups in amino acids’ main chains can 
bind to metal ions, as can side chains like the nitrogen atoms in histidine’s imidazole ring or the 
carboxyl groups in glutamic and aspartic acid.96 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Thioethers, thiols, and hydroxyl groups are examples of metal ion binding side chains. 
The synthesis of AgNPs and AuNPs has been linked to tyrosine residues in peptides or proteins 
(El-Seedi et al. 2019). AgNPs of 40–50 nm size with strong antibacterial activity against skin 
resident and transient flora were obtained using Phoenix sylvestris L. (Indian date) seed extract to 
minimize and stabilize Ag+
 ions. The O–H group of phenols, amide groups, and carbonyl groups 
of proteins present in the seed extract formed a layer of the NPs and serve as potential capping 
agents to avoid nanometal aggregation and provide stabilization, according to the FTIR range of 
synthesized NPs (Qidwai et al. 2018). At room temperature, mixing an aqueous mixture of selenium 
acid (H2
SeO3
) with C. annuum extract resulted in the development of highly stable rod-like, quasi￾spherical, and spherical selenium/protein composites with dimensions of 100 to 300 nm enclosed 
by a dense protein coating. Electrophoretic analysis of the crude extract and the protein extracted 
from the nanocomposites reported a similar 30 kDa protein which is thought to have tyrosine, 
tryptophan, and phenylalanine residues and might have resulted in the reduction of SeO3
2− ions to Se0
. 
SDS-PAGE, Cyclic voltammogram (CV), Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) and HPLC results 
point towards the presence of protein residues such as tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine and 
Vitamin C in C. annuum extract, which act as stabilizing and reducing agents and convert SeO3
2−
ions to Se0
 (Li et al. 2007). 
Silver and gold nanoparticles with catalytic activity were generated using aqueous stem extract 
of Angelica gigas (Korean angelica) by green chemistry technique. Field emission gun transmission 
electron microscope (FEG-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and particle size analyzer confirmed the 
crystalline and spherical nature of AgNPs and AgNPs with sizes varying from 40 to 300 nm. FTIR 
analysis attributed the reduction of metal ions and subsequent stabilization of nanometals to the 
presence of polypeptides in the extract (Chokkalingam et al. 2019). 
The following steps are used in the common procedure for plant-mediated AgNP synthesis: 
plant materials are collected from different plant sites and washed with detergents before being 
thoroughly soaked in double distilled water for 2–3 cycles. Farm content that has been washed and 
dried should be allowed to air dry at room temperature.
Plant materials are weighed and boiled for 10–15 minutes with 100 ml deionized distilled water 
and subsequently cooled. A nylon mesh cloth was used to filter the solution and held at 4ºC. The 
collected filtrate was then dissolved in an aqueous solution of AgNO3
 (1 mM) and stored at room 
temperature. The production of AgNPs by the interaction of silver metal ions and of plant extract 
is shown by subsequent colour variations in the reaction mixture. The development of AgNPs can 
also be verified using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Metal ion concentration, reaction mixture 
pH, extract contents reaction, temperature, reaction length, and agitation are both chemical and 
physical restrictions that influence AgNPs synthesis. The morphology, form, and scale of AgNPs 
are influenced by factors like metal ion concentration, extract composition, and reaction time 
(Rajeshkumar and Bharath 2017)
4. General method of biosynthesis of nanoparticles
4.1 Using plants
The metal solution (1 mM) and the plant extract are combined in a particular ratio (Eg 95:5 ml). 
Microwave oven, autoclave, sonication, heating, boiling, and other techniques can also be used to 
carry out the reaction. The kinetics of the reaction, which is dependent on which methods were used 
to carry out the reaction, determines the shape, size, and form or type of nanoparticles produced. 
A single sound wave, for example, can have a different effect on nanoparticle synthesis than light 
intensity or colour. The impact of sunlight on the nanoparticle size and shape is unique.Bionanofabrication: A Green Approach towards Nanoparticle Synthesis using Plants and Microbes 97
4.2 Using bacterial cells
The bacteria are grown in nutrient broth in an Erlenmeyer flask for 12 hours at 37ºC under shaker 
conditions (150–200 rpm). The culture is combined with the metal salt during the incubation phase. 
To provide proper stability to the structure, 5–10 g of bacterial mass is needed for the metal ion 
reduction and capping of synthesised nanomaterials. The biomass can associate with the metal salt 
over the 120-hour incubation period. The extracellular synthesis of nanomaterials is investigated by 
looking at the colour shift in the test tube contents.
Following that, the contents of the test tube are centrifuged to isolate the bacterial mass for 
nanomaterial suspension.
5. Processes of MtNP synthesis by microorganisms
For the biosynthesis of nanomaterials, microbial cells have been extensively used. Microbes such 
as fungi, bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and actinomycetes can be used as bio factories to reduce metals 
such as silver, selenium, copper, cadmium, magnetite, gold-silver alloy, palladium, platinum, silica, 
and various other metals to nanoparticles for use in biological uses (Narayanan and Sakthivel 
2010). Despite the fact that a wide range of microbial organisms are capable of forming metal 
nanostructures, the process of nanoparticle biosynthesis remains unknown.
The catalytic mechanism of the microorganism’s isoenzymes can play a role in the biosynthesis 
of nanoparticles using microorganisms to some degree (He et al. 2008, Ahmed et al. 2003a). 
Enzymes secreted by microorganisms are responsible for the creation of metal nanostructures, as 
well as electron transfer to redirect the electron of a reducible agent (such as reductase, reducing 
sugar, electron donor, etc.) to metal ions. Microbes synthesise these nanoparticles using enzymes 
formed either extracellularly or intracellularly as a result of a number of bioreduction processes 
(Figure 3).
5.1 Extracellular enzymes
Extracellular microbial enzymes perform an essential role in the biological synthesis of metal 
nanoparticles as a reducing agent (Subbaiya et al. 2017). Cofactors such as Nicotinamide Adenine 
Dinucleotide (NADH) and the reduced form of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate 
(NADPH) related enzymes also serve as reducing agents by passing electrons from NADH to NADH￾dependent enzymes that function as electron carriers, according to research (Bose and Chatterjee 
2016). The extracellular biosynthesis of AuNPs by Rhodopseudomonas capsulata is aided by the 
secretion of NADH and NADH-dependent enzymes. R. capsulate uses NADH-dependent reductase 
enzymes to transfer electrons from NADH to perform gold biological reduction of AuCl2
. Gold 
ions accept electrons, reducing Au3+ to Au0
 and resulting in the formation of gold nanoparticles 
(Dhandapani et al. 2017).
A variety of other considerations, such as the precursor concentration, pH, temperature, 
and reaction time, all play a role in limiting the size of MtNPs. In addition to these enzymes, a 
host of molecules such as anthraquinones, naphthoquinones, and hydroquinones are involved in 
the synthesis of MtNPs (Patra et al. 2014). Microorganisms have used variations in biosorption, 
solubility, extracellular accumulation, metal complexation, toxicity by oxidation-reduction 
pathways, and the lack of special transporters in the biosynthesis of NPs. Extracellular enzymes 
like cellobiohydrolase D, acetyl xylan esterase, Beta-glucosidase, and glucosidase are produced by 
many fungi and perform vital role in the biosynthesis of MtNPs (Ovais et al. 2018b). The fungus￾secreted enzyme nitrate reductase aids in the biological reduction and synthesis of MtNPs.98 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

AgNPs are synthesised outside of the cell. Many studies have shown the contribution of nitrate 
reductase in the extracellular processing of MtNPs (Kumar et al. 2007a,b). Using commercially 
available nitrate reductase discs, researchers discovered that these NADH-dependent reductase 
enzymes were involved in the reduction of Ag+
 ions to Ag(0) and the formation of silver nanoparticles 
(Ingle et al. 2008, Durán et al. 2005). The reduction of gold and silver NPs was carried out using
Fusarium oxysporum. According to reports, extracellular reductases formed by fungi reduced Au3+
and Ag1+ to Au–Ag NPs. In addition, shuttle quinone and nitrate-dependent reductases generated by
Fusarium oxysporum species were utilized in the synthesis of NPs extracellularly (Senapati et al. 
2005). Despite the existence of reductase, some plants, such as Fusarium moniliforme, were unable 
to generate AgNPs, meaning that reduction of Ag1+ occurs via coupled oxidation-reduction reaction 
of electron carriers including NADP-dependent nitrate reductase (Durán et al. 2005). In an in vitro
analysis, F. oxysporum nitrate reductase was used to synthesise AgNPs in the absence of oxygen and 
in the presence of a cofactor (NADPH), a stabiliser protein (phytochelatin), and an electron carrier 
(4-hydroxyquinoline). Outside of the cell, this fungus developed a significant number of AgNPs 
(Kumar et al. 2007a, Karbasian et al. 2008). F. oxysporum, on the other hand, was shown to be 
capable of synthesis of semiconductor CdS nanoparticles, extracellularly.
The reductase enzyme obtained from F. oxysporum was used to biosynthesize highly luminescent 
CdSe nanoparticles in this analysis (Kumar et al. 2007b, Ahmad et al. 2002). Other fungal strain’s 
enzymes, such as Fusarium solani and Fusarium semitectum, were also used in the extracellular 
processing of AgNPs. 
According to the results, specific proteins may be responsible for the reduction of Ag+
, 
resulting in the production of AgNPs (Basavaraja et al. 2008, Ingle et al. 2009). Cladosporium 
cladosporioides and Coriolus versicolor synthesised AgNPs outside of the cell using fungal organic 
acids, polysaccharides, and proteins. These fungi were found to be capable of synthesizing AgNPs, 
and the organic acids, polysaccharides, and proteins used in the process influenced the growth and 
form of the nanocrystals (Balaji et al. 2009). The extracellular biosynthesis of AgNPs was stabilised 
by fungal proteins after growing Aspergillus niger in an AgNO3 solution (Gade et al. 2008). In 
contrast to other chemical and physical techniques used in the synthesis process, Aspergillus 
fumigatus extracellularly synthesized AgNPs in a fraction of the time (10 mins) (Bhainsa and 
D’souza 2006). As a result, A. fumigatus was discovered to be an excellent applicant for large-scale 
development of a range of NPs.
In addition, Penicillium fellutanum reduced Ag1+ ions in a relatively small period of time 
(10 min). Additional tests showed that the reduction Ag1+ ions were due to an enzyme, nitrate 
reductase (Kathiresan et al. 2009). The release of NADH-dependent enzyme nitrate reductases by 
Penicillium brevicompactum carried out the Ag1+ ions reduction (Shaligram et al. 2009). Sargassum 
wightii greville, one of the algae known to biosynthesize NPs, was analysed for its ability to rapidly 
reduce Au3+ ions to form AuNPs having a size of 8–12 nm (Singaravelu et al. 2007). Chlorella 
vulgaris, a filamentous algae, was utilized in the processing of Au nanoparticles, resulting in Au and 
Au+1 nanoparticles (Lengke et al. 2006).
5.2 Intracellular enzymes
Bacteria and fungi, as well as sugar molecules, perform an essential role in the intracellular metal 
removal mechanism. Following the reduction within the cell, the associations between positively 
charged groups and intracellular enzymes are used to capture metallic ions from the medium (Dauthal 
and Mukhopadhyay 2016, Thakkar et al. 2010). The accumulation of MtNPs in the periplasmic 
region, the cell wall, and the cytoplasmic membrane has been observed.100 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
This may be attributed to metal ion flow through membranes and reduction of the metal using 
enzymatic processes, which results in the development of MtNPs.
For the intracellular synthesis of AuNPs, alkalo-tolerant (Rhodococcus sp.) and alkalo￾thermophilic (Thermomonospora sp.) actinomycetes were used (Ahmad et al. 2003a,b) for the 
formation of AuNPs having uniform dimensions. Enzymes found on the mycelia’s surface and in 
the cytoplasmic membrane aided in the reduction of Au3+.
Intracellular reduction and the development of AgNPs is carried out by Verticillium biomass.
AgNPs is produced underneath the surface of the cell wall due to bioreduction enzymatically, 
which is not harmful to the fungi, according to electron microscopic pictures (Mukherjee et al. 
2001a). The biosynthesis of AuNPs was carried out in a related manner, with the reducing enzymes 
coming from the fungus Verticillium.
AuNPs were discovered entrapped inside the fungi’s cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall, 
suggesting that Au3+ reduction was carried out by reductase enzymes present in that area of the 
cell (Mukherjee et al. 2001b). AuNPs are precipitated within bacterial cells following incubation 
with Au3+ ionic solution, according to reports (Southam and Beveridge 1996). When Pseudomonas 
stutzeri (AG259) was subjected to a AgNO3 solution of high concentration, reduction of Ag1+
ions took place, and AgNPs were synthesised in the bacterial periplasmic region (Klaus et al. 
1999). Plectonema boryanum, a filamentous cyanobacterium, was exposed to Au(S2O3)2 3- and 
AuCl4-solutions, AuNPs were formed at the cell membrane area and gold sulphide was found 
intracellularly (Lengke et al. 2006). Incubation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium in an ionic Au3+
solution formed AuNPs having a particle size of 10–100 nm. Laccase and ligninase enzymes were 
used as extracellular and intracellular reducing agents to reduce Au3+ ions, respectively (Sanghi 
et al. 2011). Other parameters, such as the fungus’ incubation age, the incubation temperature, and 
the concentration of the AuCl4-solution, have shown to have a direct impact on the form of AuNPs. 
Shewanella algae, a mesophilic bacterium, has also shown to be an effective biological reducer of 
AuCl4- ions to elemental gold. The presence of Au nanoparticles in the periplasmic space of bacteria 
was discovered thanks to intracellular enzymes (Konishi et al. 2007). Brevibacterium casei reduced 
aqueous mixtures of Au3+ and Ag+ ions to spherical AuNPs and AgNPs, by using intracellular 
enzymes (Kalishwaralal et al. 2010).
6. Biomolecules involved in nanoparticles synthesis
The procedure for controlling the size of nanoparticles is intriguing in its simplicity.
One of the appropriate pathways is the role of stress proteins such as Glutathione (GSH), 
PhytoChelatins (PCs), and MetalloThioneins (MTs), as well as superoxide dismutases, catalases, 
and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Animals, fungi, algae, some prokaryotes, and in 
some cases, plants, all contain GSH and metallothioneins (Yadav 2010). In the presence of metals, 
these molecules are triggered. The introduction of heavy metals into the environment has serious 
ramifications. In the presence of heavy metals, higher organisms develop cysteine-rich peptides 
such as PCs, GSH, and MTs, which bind metal ions (such as lead, cadmium, copper, and mercury) 
and sequester them in biologically inactive ways (Yadav 2010).
Phytochelatins (PCs) are small cysteine-rich polypeptides with the general form (g-Glu-Cys)
nGly (Mirza et al. 2014). Phytochelatins are among the most potent metal chelators, capable of 
neutralising the negative effects of a wide variety of dangerous metals. In the case of heavy metal 
(HM) toxicity, PCs are synthesised in the cytosol. PC–metal and PC–metalloid complexes are 
extremely stable in nature, and they shape and sequester themselves in vacuolar compartments 
where metal toxicity is minimal (Dago et al. 2014, Ray and Williams 2011, Shen et al. 2010). Since 
phytochelatin (PC) and other metal-binding proteins can bind heavy metals, they have been used 
to extract them. Phytochelatins are proteins that can form metal complexes with cadmium, copper, 
silver, lead, and mercury, while metallothioneins are gene-encoded proteins that can bind metals like Bionanofabrication: A Green Approach towards Nanoparticle Synthesis using Plants and Microbes 101
copper, cadmium, and zinc. MTs can aid in (a) maintaining the homeostasis of vital transformation 
HMs, (b) sequestration of toxic HMs, and (c) defence against intracellular oxidative disruption, 
despite the fact that their precise physiological function is unknown (Xu et al. 2011). Park et al. 
(2010) reported on the in vivo synthesis of different NPs using recombinant E. coli expressing 
Arabidopsis thaliana PCS (AtPCS) and/or Pseudomonas putida MT (PpMT). Semiconducting 
(Cd, Se, Zn, Te), alkali-earth (Cs, Sr), magnetic (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn), noble (Au, Ag), and rare-earth 
fluorides (Pr, Gd) metals were incubated in different variations of recombinant E. coli cells for 
in vivo synthesis. The resulting NPs’ optical, magnetic, and physicochemical properties were studied.
The established SeZn and CdTe NPs were of various shapes and sizes, demonstrating that 
PC (synthesised by AtPCS) and PpMT expressed in cells of E. coli could synthesise various 
semiconducting nanocrystallites in vivo. The d lattice structure and size of NPs synthesised in vivo
by MT and PC vary, meaning that PC and MT have distinct metal binding and assembly properties 
(Hirata et al. 2005, Cobbett et al. 2002, Robinson et al. 2001, Grill et al. 1985). The binding affinity 
of MT for Cu was found to be higher than that for Cd or Zn (Coyle et al. 2002). In PC and MT, 
one Cd ion is seen bound to two and three cysteine residues, respectively (Hirata et al. 2005, Grill 
et al. 1985). It is possible that coexpression of PpMT and AtPCS in E. coli would allow for the 
synergistic biosynthesis of more diverse metal NPs. Cells that coexpressed or expressed both AtPCS 
and PpMT simultaneously accumulated NPs. The NPs CdSe, CdZn, SeZn, and CdTe all had well￾defined crystalline structures with interplanar lattice lengths, which is a feature of these NPs. Park 
et al. (2010) showed that coexpression of AtPCS and PpMT results in a wide range of metal NPs. 
Simultaneous expression of MT and PCS in E. coli strengthened the assembly of different metal 
elements into closely arranged NPs. The size of the metal NPs could be monitored by adapting the 
concentrations of the supplied metal ions. Semiconducting (Cd, Se, Zn, Te), alkali-earth (Cs, Sr), 
magnetic (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn), noble (Au, Ag), and rare-earth fluorides (Pr, Gd) metals were incubated 
in recombinant E. coli cells in various variations for in vivo synthesis. The optical, magnetic, and

physicochemical properties of the resulting NPs were investigated (Toppi and Gabbrielli 1999). PCs 
are also unable to metabolise or remove Cd. They have been observed to form complexes of Cd￾GSH and Cd-PCs in order to effectively sequester Cd within vacuoles (DalCorso et al. 2008, Toppi 
and Gabbrielli 1999) and to help in Cd transportation via phloem and xylem vessels (Mendoza￾Cózatl et al. 2008). The fact that PC growth was related to HM accumulation in both below-ground 
and above-ground tissues provided further support for PC induction in response to HM stress. 
According to study, PCs participate in HM transport (Salt and Rauser 1995), meaning that their 
detoxifying abilities are secondary or part of a broader process. Despite the fact that PCs have been 
shown to play a role in HM detoxification and aggregation in higher plants, the development of HM 
complexes is insufficient to explain the HM or species specificity of hyperaccumulation (Baker 
et al. 2000). As a result, it is still unclear what role PCs play at the cellular level during the HM￾tolerance process, necessitating further investigation.
7. Role of Excreted electron shuttlers in metal ion reduction
The mechanism by which microbes pass electrons to minerals that are poorly soluble has been 
the focus of extensive research (Turick et al. 2002). Our understanding of cellular transfer derives 
from a thorough examination of photosynthesis and respiration in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
systems. The structure and role of different membrane-bound proteins involved in electron transport 
processes is now well understood (Gray and Winkler 1996). During nanoparticle synthesis, electrons 
may be transferred through low molecular weight redox mediators such as ubiquinol, NADH, or 
oxygen/superoxide, or by direct interaction between c-type cytochromes redox proteins and the 
metal ion (Bewley et al. 2013).
In this mode of electron transfer, tiny mobile molecules adept at undergoing redox cycling 
are used (i.e., an electron shuttle). These molecules serve as terminal electron acceptors, passing 
electrons from metal-to-metal oxide, which is then reoxidized. In theory, a single shuttle molecule 
could loop thousands of times and thus have a significant effect on the turnover of the terminal 
oxidant such as iron. Organic molecules that play an important role as electron shuttlers include 
humic compounds, quinones, phenazine, and thiol-containing molecules such as cysteine, but 
anything that is redox-active and has the appropriate redox potential can also be used (Madigan 
et al. 2000). Several studies have been performed to examine the role of cytochromes and redox 
mediators in metal nanoparticle extracellular synthesis.
During anaerobic respiration, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is found to use ferric oxide minerals 
as terminal electron acceptors, and c-type cytochromes are believed to be active in this electron 
transfer pathway. Metal-reducing bacteria S. oneidensis MR-1 and associated strains Shewanella
also developed a metal-reducing machinery, or Mtr pathway, for transporting electrons across cell 
membranes to the surface. The role of c-type cytochromes in moving electrons from quinol at the 
inner membrane (IM), periplasmic space (PS), and outer membrane (OM) to the metal oxide surface 
(Fe(III) oxide) has been suggested as a molecular mechanism. CymA, MtrA, MtrB, MtrC, and 
OmcA are some of the protein components involved in the Mtr pathway.
Outside the bacterial cell membrane, a related mechanism for bacterial metal nanoparticle 
synthesis has been proposed. CymA is a quinol dehydrogenase from the NapC/NrfH family of inner￾membrane tetraheme c-type cytochromes (c-Cyt). The theory is that CymA oxidises the quinol in the 
inner membrane and passes electrons to MtrA either directly or indirectly through other periplasmic 
proteins. MtrA is a decaheme c-Cyt found in MtrB, which is a porin-like protein with a trans outer 
membrane. MtrA transfers electrons from the outer membrane to MtrC and OmcA on the outermost 
surface, along with MtrB. MtrC and OmcA, two outer-membrane decaheme c-Cyt, are transported 
from the outer-membrane to the cell surface through the bacterial type II secretion pathway. OmcA 
and MtrC are terminal reducing agents that can bind to the surface of Fe(III) oxides and directly 
transfer electrons through the exposed hemes component of these oxides. Flavins secreted by Bionanofabrication: A Green Approach towards Nanoparticle Synthesis using Plants and Microbes 103
S. oneidensis MR-1 cells can be used as diffusible factors by OmcA and MtrC to accelerate Fe(III) 
oxide reduction. OmcA and MtrC, due to their broad redox potentials and extracellular location, can 
also serve as terminal reducing agents for soluble Fe (III) (Shi et al. 2012).
The molecular structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfH has been determined. According to 
this model, quinol binds inside the pocket adjacent to heme 1 of D. vulgaris NrfH, where it is 
oxidised (Rodrigues et al. 2006, 2008). Later, the first molecular model of electron transfer across 
the bacterial outer-membrane was developed (Hartshorne et al. 2009).
As shown in Figure 5, MtrB is a trans outer-membrane spanning-barrel protein that serves 
as a pocket for MtrA to enter the membrane. MtrAB is an extracellular reductase that acts as a 
trans outer-membrane electron transport module. MtrA contains a signal peptide that, through the 
bacterial secretary mechanism, transports the synthesised polypeptide to the periplasmic space. MtrA 
polypeptides are grouped into two pentaheme domains, each with a sequence similar to that of NrfB 
from E. coli. Since truncated MtrA is expressed in E. coli with just one of its pentaheme domains, 
it folds correctly and has five hemes, indicating that MtrA has two repeated functional domains 
(Clarke et al. 2008). The electron transfer from the NrfB heme groups that form a molecular wire is 
facilitated by this sort of heme structure.
In a sample, the molecular structure of MtrF, a MtrC homolog, was determined. The same study 
discovered molecular structural proof in favour of a terminal reducing agent for S. oneidensis MR-1 
outer-membrane c-Cyt in Fe(III) oxide reduction (Clarke et al. 2011). A recent study was published 
to better understand the function of c-type cytochromes in nanoparticle extracellular synthesis. A 
mutant strain of Shewanella oneidensis lacking cytochrome genes (MtrC and OmcA) was used for 
AgNP biosynthesis.
The mutant strain of S. oneidensis produced nanoparticles that were smaller in size and number 
as compared to the wild-type strain. This indicates that c-type cytochromes aid in electron transfer to 
extracellular metal ions (Ng et al. 2013). The outer membrane c-type cytochrome protein complexes 
(ombB, omaB, and omcB) are specifically involved in the extracellular reduction of Fe(III)-citrate 
and ferrihydrite in a metal-reducing bacterium. The Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA strain has been 
identified (Liu et al. 2014, 2015). Another study on Geobacter sulfurreducens AgNP synthesis 
discovered a similar mechanism of electron transfer through c-cytochromes.
Figure 5. The proposed Metal-reducing (Mtr) extracellular electron transfer pathway of S. oneidensis MR-1 which is similar 
to bacterial metal nanoparticles’ synthesis outside the bacterial cell surface (Gahlawat and Choudhury 2019).104 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Electrons produced during this process were transported through the periplasmic space by 
Fe2+/hemes of c-cytochromes (Ppc) to Fe3+/hemes of the outer membrane cytochromes (Omc). 
As a result, electrons were transferred from Omc’s protein centre to surface-attached Ag+ ions in 
order to synthesize AgNPs, while cytochromes were oxidised back to Fe3+/hemes (Vasylevskyi 
et al. 2017). According to the findings of these studies, multiheme complexes facilitate the transfer 
of electrons from the inner membrane to the cell wall (or outer membrane) through periplasm, 
resulting in the extracellular reduction of metal ions into nanoparticles.

8. Conclusion
The use of biological agents in nanomaterial synthesis is an environmentally safe, cost-effective, and 
fast way of producing nanomaterials. Nanomaterials’ peculiar properties make them attractive for 
a wide range of nanotechnology applications. Because of their high stability and biocompatibility, 
nanomaterials’ synthesis using biosynthesis is very unique. It’s crucial to understand the various 
forms of active groups that can be found in nature and bind to the surface of nanoparticles. The 
existence of these classes, as well as several other physical factors, can influence the scale, form, 
and morphology of nanoparticles. Using these criteria for biological nanoparticle synthesis will 
aid in studying the unexplained information of nanoparticle synthesis regulation at the gene stage. 
In contrast to chemical and physical processes, biological synthesis of nanoparticles is a sluggish 
process that can take several hours to several days depending on the biological agent. The biosynthesis 
process would be more appealing if the synthesis time is reduced. The size and monodispersity 
of the nanoparticle produced are the two most important factors in evaluating nanoparticle 
synthesis. According to reports, the nanoparticles produced by biological entities decompose after 
a period of time. As a result, thorough research is needed to fully comprehend these problems. 
The monodispersity and particle size could be regulated by changing parameters such as microbial 
cell growth stage (phase), biological entity form, synthesis conditions, pH, growth medium, source 
compound of target nanoparticle, substrate concentrations, reaction time, temperature, and addition 
of nontarget ions. Biosynthesis approaches are also advantageous because nanoparticles can be 
covered with a lipid coating, which provides durability and physiological solubility, which is vital in 
biomedical functions. There is currently research underway to help pinpoint the compounds that are 
needed and play a key role in nanoparticle synthesis. This would aid in the development of methods 
with a short reaction time and a high synthesis efficiency rate.

1. Introduction 
Electron microscopy is the main characterization technique used to study nanostructured materials. 
Its development was driven by the limitations displayed by visible light microscopy (VLM). In 
the XIX century, Ernst Karl Abbe published his work related to the limitations of VLM, which 
are directly related to the diffraction processes involved in the image formation mechanism of 
such microscopes. Equation 1 shows the mathematical expression, derived by Abbe, related to the 
minimum distance that can be resolved using VLM:
0.61 d
n sen
λ
θ = (1)
In this equation, d is the resolution of VLM; λ is the visible light wavelength used to illuminate 
the studied sample; n corresponds to the refraction index where the observation is performed; while 
θ corresponds to the magnification lens’ collection semi-angle. The term in the denominator, n sen θ, 
is known as the numerical aperture. The resolution in VLM is defined based on Rayleigh’s criterion, 
as the minimum resolvable distance between two image source points, when the first diffraction 
minimum of one source point coincides with the maximum of the other. In accordance with 
Equation 1, in a conventional VLM, under the illumination of blue light (λ = 400 nm), the numerical 
aperture reached a value very close to unity several years ago; as a result, the resolution limit 
reached by conventional VLM is approximately 250 nm. Technical advances in VLM allowed it to 
reach this theoretical limit around 1930 (Judith et al. 2012), driven mostly by the requirements set 
by microbiology, and their need to study the inner structure of different cells and microorganisms. 
Nonetheless, conventional VLM had reached a limit that, according with Abbe himself, human 
ingenuity would not be capable to surpass.
However, in 1924 French physicist Louis de Broglie published his doctorate dissertation 
entitled “Research on the theory of the quanta” (Louis de Broglie 1925), where he theorized about 
the wave nature of electrons, and how these particles show the same dual wave-particle nature

proposed by Einstein for light, in his seminal work published on 1905 about the photoelectric effect. 
The first experimental evidence on the wave nature of electrons was observed by C.J. Davisson and 
L. Germer in 1927. In an experiment investigating the elastic scattering of electrons by the surface 
of a nickel crystal, the scientists noticed that electrons emerged from the crystal at unexpected 
angles. These angles corresponded to the angles predicted by the constructive interference condition 
proposed by Bragg’s law. Knowing the crystal interplanar spacing and measuring the diffraction 
angles, Davisson was able to determine the wavelength of the electrons and found it to coincide with 
the de Broglie wavelength based on Equation 2.
h λ = (2)
me
ν
In Equation 2, λ is de Broglie’s wavelength, h is Plank’s constant, me
 is the mass of the electron 
at rest and v is the velocity of the electron. After this experimental confirmation of his theory, 
Louise de Broglie was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 “for his discovery of the 
wave nature of electrons”, as stated on the webpage of the Nobel Prize organization (https://www.
nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes-in-physics/).
These advancements in the understanding on the nature of elementary particles, and their 
behavior, inspired German physicist Ernst Ruska and German engineer Max Knoll to develop a 
microscope based on electrons. They proposed that a microscope using electrons to illuminate the 
samples, with wavelengths thousands of times smaller than those of visible light, could provide a 
much more detailed picture of objects than the images provided by conventional VLM. Based on this 
idea, they designed and constructed the first transmission electron microscope (TEM) in history in 
1933. Ernst Ruska was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 “for his fundamental work 
in electron optics, and for the design of the first electron microscope”, as stated on the webpage of 
the Nobel Prize organization (https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes-in-physics/). 
2. Transmission electron microscope
TEM equipment comprises several systems working together to assure a proper performance. The 
electron gun, or emitter, is the system responsible for producing the electron beam. There are two 
major commercial types of electron emitters, based on the fundamental phenomenon responsible for 
the electron emission: thermionic emitters and field effect gun (FEG) emitters. Thermionic emitters 
are made of tungsten or LaB6
. As suggested by their name, the thermionic emission phenomenon 
is responsible for the electron emission; hence, they operate at high temperatures (~ 2800 K for W 
and ~ 1900 K for LaB6
). Operation vacuums are in the range between 10–5 – 10–6 mbar, while the 
emission current densities are in the range between 3 – 30 A/cm2
, with effective source radii between 
1,500 – 5,000 nm; these two last parameters limit the “smallest” area that can be analyzed to be in 
the order of several nanometers. On the other hand, FEG emitters are made mostly of tungsten, and 
there are two types commercially available, Schottky and Cold-FEGs. A promoted tunneling effect, 
due to the morphology of the emitter’s tip and the use of high electric fields, is the mechanism 
responsible for the electron’s emission. They operate at lower temperatures than thermionic emitters 
(~ 1800 K for Schottky and ~ 300 K for Cold-FEGs). Operation vacuums for this technology are in 
the range between 10–9 – 10–10 mbar, while their emission current densities are in the range between 
5,000 – 17,000 A/cm2
, with effective source radii between 2.5 nm – 15 nm; these two last parameters 
are responsible for excellent illumination in small regions, allowing the acquisition of high quality 
high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images. Once the electrons are generated from the emitter, they 
enter the acceleration ring, where they will be subject to the acceleration voltage, which is a TEM’s 116 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
operational parameter defined by the user. This acceleration voltage will define the final wavelength 
display by the electron beam, based on the following equation:
2 2 1
2 e

h
eV m Ve

λ =

(3)
In this expression, λ is de Broglie’s wavelength, h is Plank’s constant, me
 is the mass of the 
electron at rest, V is the acceleration voltage, e is the charge of the electron and c is the speed of 
light in vacuum. 
After being accelerated to the desired voltage (velocity), the electrons enter the illumination 
system. This system is composed of the electromagnetic lenses and apertures that allow the 
manipulation of the electron beam. The electromagnetic lenses allow to manipulate the electron 
beam by the generation of a magnetic field produced by an electrical current moving through a 
copper coil, and the electric filed produced by the voltage applied between two metal plates, known 
as the polar pieces. The force exerted over the electrons in the traveling beam is described by the 
Lorenz force (Equation 4). 
F eE v B = +× ( ) (4)
In Equation 4, F is the total force experienced by the electron beam, e is the charge of the 
electron, E corresponds to the applied electric field, v is the velocity of electrons and B corresponds 
to magnetic field applied. As it can be deduced from the Lorenz force equation, applying an electric 
and magnetic field to a moving electron produces a force that allows its manipulation, whereas the 
apertures restrict the electron beam’s angular spread when entering the electromagnetic lenses.
The vacuum system is very important within a TEM, since electron microscopy relies on the 
fact that the emitted and accelerated electrons travel in an environment free of anything that could 
potentially affect their trajectory, while traveling down the emission gun to interact with the sample. 
The vacuum requirements are mainly defined by the type of the electron source featured by the 
electron microscope (EM), as previously discussed. All vacuum systems include different types of 
pumps working together to generate the operational vacuum. In general, modern EM instruments 
have a mechanical, or roughing, pump to generate the initial vacuum, normally reaching vacuum 
levels of ~ 10–3 Torr. The next vacuum stage is reached with turbomolecular pumps, attaining 
vacuum levels in the range between 10–3 – 10–11 Torr. In many contemporary thermionic electron 
source EM, these are the only two pump types forming the vacuum system. However, FEG electron 
sources equipment always displays a third type of vacuum pump, known as Ion Getter Pumps (IGP). 
This type of pumps can reach vacuum levels between 10–6 – 10–12 Torr, which are mainly responsible 
for maintaining the ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions required for proper FEG instruments’ 
operation. 
The wave nature of electrons, and its tunable wavelength, is the main reason behind the 
development of EM. Nevertheless, electrons interact stronger with matter than photons, producing 
a wide variety of secondary signals not available in VLM. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the main 
signals generated by the electron scattering of a high energy electron beam interacting with a thin 
sample (for the rest of the chapter, we’ll assume all samples are electron transparent, which is a 
requirement for a proper analysis in TEM). Each of this signals provide information about different 
aspects of the analyzed sample, when properly collected and interpreted, these signals provide 
information about the sample’s morphology, chemical composition, crystalline structure, atoms’ 
valence states, atomic chemical bonding interactions, atomic radial distribution functions, optical 
and electrical properties, among others.Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 117
The different detectors featured by the EM will determine which techniques can be used in 
that instrument. These set of detectors determine the capabilities displayed by the EM and form the 
detection system. 
In Figure 1 can be observed the main signals generated due to the interaction between a high 
energy electron beam and a thin specimen. The signals observed “over” the specimen are mainly 
used in scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), with the exception of the “Characteristic X-Rays”, 
that is equally important in SEM and TEM studies. The signals identified as the “Transmitted 
Electrons”, and showed “below” the specimen, are the main signals used in TEM. Within these 
signals is contained the information provided by the different TEM techniques available for the 
characterization of nanoparticles. In the following sections of this chapter, the fundamentals of the 
main techniques currently used in the characterization of nanoparticles will be briefly described.
3. TEM and HRTEM
Different mechanisms of image formation are related to different TEM techniques. The most basic 
one relates to the projection mass thickness contrast mechanism (Figure 2a). In this image formation 
mechanism, the bright areas observed in the TEM images correspond to areas within the specimen 
Figure 1. Electron scattering signals produced by the interaction of a high energy electron beam with a thin sample 
(Garcia 2006).118 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
that allow the electron beam transmission through the sample in the forward direction. The images 
formed through this mechanism correspond to maps of the projected mass thickness within the 
sample. This image formation mechanism can be easily assimilated if the simple expression used to 
describe the absorption of radiation by materials (Beer’s Law) is remembered.

 is the original intensity of the electron beam before interacting with the 
sample, ρ is the sample’s density, t is its thickness and μ/ρ is the mass absorption coefficient. This 
image formation mechanism is predominant in amorphous samples and it is of main significance 
in biological samples; it exploits, mainly, the unscattered electrons that went through the sample 
without suffering any interaction (Garcia 2006).
Another basic contrast mechanism for image formation is related to the diffraction contrast 
mechanism, which is fundamentally important in crystalline samples. A crystalline sample may 
produce changes in the electron beam trajectory by diffracting the beam off the optic axis of the 
EM. Then, contrast within the TEM image can be produced between these regions deviating the 
electron beam and the regions of the sample that do not affect the beam’s trajectory (Figure 2b). In 
this contrast mechanism, the use of an objective aperture is primordial, since this aperture allows 
to select which diffracted beams will be used for the image formation. A diffraction contrast image 
can be thought to be something like a map showing the regions within the sample with different 
crystal orientations. TEM images based on this contrast mechanism will display “bright areas” in the 
regions where the sample diffracted electrons in the direction selected by the objective aperture, and 
will display “dark areas” in the regions where the sample diffracted the electron beam away from the 
objective aperture. One basic approach to describe the constructive interference condition required 
for diffraction to occur is given by Bragg’s Law (Garcia 2006):
2 sin( ) hkl λ θ = d (6)
In this expression, λ is the wavelength of the radiation, dhkl is the interplanar distance between 
crystal family planes (hkl) and θ is Bragg’s angle, where the electron waves are diffracted. Whenever 
this relationship between the incident radiation wavelength, interplanar distance within the crystal 
structure and the orientation of the crystal planes with respect to the electron beam is fulfilled, 
strong Bragg diffraction spots are expected to appear in the diffraction pattern. Experimentally 
Figure 2. TEM image formation mechanism corresponding to: (a) mass contrast and (b) diffraction contrast (Garcia 2006).Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 119
demonstrated by Davisson, as previously discussed, electron diffraction patterns are produced 
whenever an electron beam interacts with a crystalline material, as long as the electron beam’s 
characteristic wavelength is in the same order of magnitude as that of the interplanar distances 
found in the crystalline material. This is always the case for commonly acceleration voltages 
used in commercial TEMs. Figure 3 shows a typical electron diffraction pattern for a sample of 
nanoparticles. In this figure, the bright spots correspond to Bragg’s spots diffracted to the Bragg 
angle, θ, measured with respect to the TEM’s optical axis, corresponding to the families of planes 
indicated in the figure; all the Bragg spots at the same distance from the center of the diffraction 
pattern correspond to the same family of planes.
Diffraction contrast constitutes the basic contrast mechanism for two very important imaging 
modes in conventional TEM: bright field (BF) and dark field (DF). In BF mode, the TEM image 
is formed with the sample’s regions which are not diffracting the electron beam away from the 
EM’s optic axis while in DF, TEM images show those sample’s regions diffracting the electron 
beam off the optic axis of the electron microscope, such that certain Bragg’s spots pass through the 
objective aperture, located in the EM’s objective lens back focal plane, considering that the objective 
aperture can be manipulated to select the desired Bragg’s spots to be used to form the DF image 
(Williams and Carter 1996). Since diffraction events are one kind of elastic scattering, the discussed 
Figure 3. Typical electron diffraction pattern corresponding to a sample of nanoparticles [unpublished data from the 
chapter’s author].120 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
techniques are based on the collection of elastically scattered electrons, however with low scattering 
angles, corresponding to the Bragg angles. These three contrast imaging mechanisms constitute the 
basic imaging techniques in conventional TEM.
High resolution imaging (HRTEM) is one of the TEM techniques most used to characterize 
nanoparticles. In this technique, the imaging contrast mechanism is the phase contrast imaging; for 
this particular contrast mechanism, it is an important requirement that the sample is considered to 
be a “phase object”, which means that the electron beam won’t suffer multiple scattering events 
within the sample. This translates to a “very thin TEM sample”, where single scattering events are 
assured; once this requirement is fulfilled, the sample can be considered a “weak phase object”. This 
“weak phase object” changes the phase of the electron waves within the electron beam traveling 
through the sample; however, it does not affect its amplitude. How much the phase of the electron 
beam would be altered, would be proportional to the crystal potential related to the specimen (phase 
object) (Garcia 2006).

 is the projected crystal potential that varies as the position within the crystalline sample 
changes, φ(x,y,z) is the potential energy associated to the electron in the beam traveling through 
the crystal as a function of its position, while t represents the specimen’s thickness (phase object) 
(Garcia 2006).
The phase contrast image formation mechanism can be realized as follows (Figure 4): the 
incident electron waves fall upon the sample’s surface; this sample is very thin and with an orientation 
such that the electron waves travel parallel to the atomic sites corresponding to the nuclei. As these 
electron waves travel through the crystal, those electrons passing through these sites corresponding 
Figure 4. Schematic of phase contrast imaging mechanism (Garcia 2006).Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 121
to the position of the atoms’ nuclei will be phase delayed relative to the electron waves passing in 
between the atomic columns. The specimen’s periodic crystal potential affects the electron waves’ 
phase passing through it. When the electron waves reach the specimen’s exit surface, the electron 
beam’s wavefront displays a phase modulated by the crystal potential of the sample, and these 
phase modulations transmit information about the sample, such as the atomic positions within the 
crystal structure. This modulated wavefront interferes with itself as it travels through the electron 
microscopes’ objective lens, carrying this crystallographic information (Garcia 2006). 
However, based on the image formation mechanism in electromagnetic lenses, no contrast 
would be observed in the image plane of an aberration-free electromagentic lens perfectly focused. 
It is necessary to translate the phase information carried by the electron waves into amplitude 
information to generate contrast. This procedure could be carried out by slightly defocusing the 
objective lens. Nonetheless, real electromagnetic lenses display several aberrations, the spherical 
aberration (Cs
) being the most important one. This aberration is responsible for the translation of 
phase information to amplitude information in focused images; however, it is also responsible for 
limiting the ultimate achievable resolution in the TEM. Aberrations, defocus and the characteristics 
of the electromagnetic lenses have a direct effect on the TEM image formed; all possible effects are 
incorporated to the image in the objective lens’ back focal plane, where the amplitude is proportional 
to the Fourier transformation of the electron wave function at the exit surface of the specimen 
(Garcia 2006).

In Equation 9, χ is known as the contrast transfer function, g is a reciprocal lattice vector

electron beam, Cs
 is the spherical aberration displayed by the objective lens and Δf is the defocus 
value. The electron wave function’s Fourier transform at the exit surface of the specimen (F{Ψe
}) 
is multiplied by the factor exp[–χ(g)], which contains the effect the objective lens has on the image 
formation (aberration, defocus, etc.). However, the important effect is related to the phase contrast; 
hence, the imaginary term of the Euler expansion of the expression exp[–χ(g)] (sin[χ(g)]) is the only 
one that matters (Garcia 2006).
{ }sin ( ) ψ χ e (10)
The wave function of the electron beam exiting the objective lens’ back focal plane is the 
Fourier transform of the wave function of the electron beam at the exit surface of the specimen, 
multiplied by the contrast transfer function corresponding to the TEM’s objective lens. This wave 
function will be Fourier transformed, again, at the time it leaves the objective lens, as it propagates 
to the image plane (Garcia 2006).
The resolution and contrast displayed by TEM phase contrast images are inherently 
interconnected. Sample thickness variations, or objective lens defocus variations, might produce 
contrast reversals in phase contrast images; hence, “bright spots” can turn “dark” just by changing 
the defocus value in the objective lens. Therefore, in order to interpret HRTEM images in a reliable 
manner, it is necessary to perform image simulations to accurately account for all the factors 
influencing image formation (Williams and Carter 1996).
4. STEM
Among the TEM techniques that have gained an increasing popularity for the characterization of 
nanoparticles in the last ten years, the Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) can 
be highlighted. In this technique, the electron beam is focused on the surface of the sample by the 
F g122 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
objective lens to form an atomic scale probe; this electron probe is “scanned” across the specimen’s 
surface, while all scattered electrons, and secondary signals can be collected by the variety of 
detectors available in the TEM. In this technique, images are generated by scanning the focused 
electron beam over the specimen surface, while the scattered or generated signals are collected to 
form the different types of images or spectra, each signal carrying different information about the 
sample. On this aspect, there is a great similarity between Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 
and STEM. Henceforth, a STEM image can be considered as a collection of individual scattering 
experiments, where different signals can be discriminated by their scattering angle and/or energy 
loss, generating information about the specimen’s structure and/or chemical information that can be 
collected simultaneously by different detectors (Figure 5) (Garcia 2006). 
Electrons scattered elastically are used to form a wide variety of signals when collected by the 
proper detectors (such as HAADF, ADF, SAED), most of them related to imaging and specimen’s 
crystal structure. On the other hand, electrons scattered inelastically, or the signals produced by such 
interactions, can be acquired by a different set of detectors (such as EELS and EDXS detectors); 
these signals provide information about the specimen’s chemical, electronic and structural 
characteristics. Both sets of signals can be acquired simultaneously and in a very efficient manner, 
allowing the performance of quantitative analyses with spatial resolutions impossible to achieve 
in other characterization methodologies, making STEM, and their related signals, one of the most 
powerful analytical techniques available for microanalysis at high-spatial resolution (Browning 
et al. 1997).
5. HAADF
One of the most important STEM signals used in the characterization of nanoparticles is the High 
Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) technique, also known as Z-contrast. The HAADF images are 
Figure 5. Schematic representation of the STEM technique (Garcia 2006).Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 123
produced by collecting, with an annular detector, the incoherently elastically scattered electrons that 
were scattered to high-angle (> 50 mrad) (Figure 5), also known as Howie detector (Howie 1979). 
The most relevant aspect related to this technique is its chemical sensitivity, since the scattering 
factors associated to the atoms of different elements are closely related to the nuclear scattering 
factors, also known as Rutherford-like scattering factors. In this regard, an accurate estimate to 
determine the scattering cross-section associated to different elements can be obtained from the 
relativistic Rutherford differential cross-section:

(11)
In Equation 11, σ denotes the atomic interaction cross-section, Ω is the solid angle, λR
corresponds to the relativistic wavelength of the electrons, Z is the atomic number for the different 
elements, a0
 corresponds to the Bohr radius, θ denotes the scattering angle, while θ0
 denotes the 
screening parameter (Williams and Carter 1996).
In STEM mode, particularly in HAADF images, it is important to consider each atom as 
an independent scatterer; then, any atom’s scattering factor can be replaced by the cross section 
calculated from Equation 11, where a clear ~ Z2
 dependence can be observed. Hence, the intensity 
of the signal observed in this technique is directly proportional to the atomic number of the elements 
contained in the sample. The spatial resolution in STEM mode techniques is only limited by the 
probe size, which can be directly understood as the diameter of the electron probe formed by the 
microscope’s illumination system (Browning et al. 1997), which is strongly determined by the 
coefficients of spherical aberration of the objective lens, Cs
, the wavelength of the electron beam, λ
, and the lens defocus, Δf. 
Compared to phase-contrast methods, such as HRTEM, HAADF is a very attractive technique 
for composition mapping at atomic resolution and, in general, for high resolution imaging, due to 
its strong chemical sensitivity and the atomic cross-section scattering, where the atoms within the 
samples are responsible for the scattering of the electrons, allowing for a direct interpretation of the 
images, and not requiring the image simulation mentioned in the HRTEM technique. 
6. EDXS and EELS
Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) 
are two techniques highly intertwined since both are related to the same inelastically scattered 
electron event. One of the most useful inelastic interactions produced between the electron beam 
and the specimen is the one generated when an incident electron from the beam collides with an 
inner-shell atomic electron. The total energy during the collision needs to be conserved, as stated 
by the energy conservation law; hence, the incident electron loses an amount of energy equal to 
the amount of energy gained by the bombarded inner-shell atomic electron (Garcia et al. 2017). 
With conventional acceleration voltages used in TEM instruments (80 kV–300 kV), the electron 
beam energy is high enough to transmit the required energy to the inner-shell atomic electrons to 
be expelled from the atom, leaving the atom in a highly excited and unstable condition, from which 
the atom needs to come out as quickly as possible. There are two mechanisms the atoms can use 
to get rid of this excess of energy and go back to a more stable state. In one mechanism, an outer￾shell atomic electron undergoes a downward transition to fill the vacant space left by the expelled 
inner-shell electron, and the excess energy is released as an electromagnetic wave (X-rays), with an 
energy equal to the energy difference between the atomic electronic levels involved in the electronic 
transition, as stated in Bohr’s atomic model (Garcia et al. 2017). In the other mechanism, the excited 
atom releases its excess energy as kinetic energy of another outer-shell electron, from the same 124 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
energy level originally occupied by the outer-shell electron that made the electronic transition to 
fill the vacant space left in the inner-shell atomic level. These emitted electrons will have the same 
energy as the energy difference between the atomic electronic levels involved in the electronic 
transition. This phenomenon is known as Auger emission, and the emitted electrons through this 
mechanism are known as Auger electrons. These two energy relaxation mechanisms compete; 
however, heavier elements tend to use the emission of X-Rays, while lighter elements tend to use the 
emission of Auger electrons. A graphical description of these mechanisms is illustrated in Figure 6.
As previously discussed, the energy of the X-Rays emitted by the atoms when returning to a 
more stable configuration from an excited state is equal to the energy difference between the atomic 
electronic levels involved in the electronic transition; thus, the characteristic X-Rays emitted by the 
atoms are related to their electronic structure, which is unique in every atom in the periodic table. 
Hence, every element in the periodic table has its own family of characteristic X-Rays, allowing the 
identification of the presence of the different elements composing the analyzed sample.
On the other hand, the original electron from the beam colliding to the inner-shell atomic 
electron, responsible for the generation of the characteristic X-Ray, lost the amount of energy 
required to free the inner-shell electron from its atom. This electron from the beam no longer 
has its original energy, associated to the acceleration voltage used in the instrument; instead, this 
electron loses a specific amount of energy, related to the inelastic scattering event occurring when 
transmitting through the sample. These inelastic interactions arise primarily from electron-electron 
interactions, being the inner-shell ionization events previously described the most commonly used 
in the nanoparticles characterization, particularly to identify their chemical composition. These 
inelastic electron-electron interactions can provide chemical, structural, electrical, and optical 
information about the sample. Other important inelastic interactions, in order of importance, 
are phonon excitations, inter-band and intra-band electron transitions, plasmon excitations, and 
inner-shell ionizations. Electrons undergoing any of these feasible inelastic interactions produce 
the Electron Energy Loss (EEL) signal. An EEL spectrum possesses three characteristic regions 
(Figure 7): the zero-loss peak, which is formed by the transmitted electrons and contains information 
about the resolution of the spectrum (Ahn et al. 1983, Egerton 1979). Next, the low-loss region 
(< 50 eV) shows the signals related to the electrons from the beam that suffered an inelastic 
interaction with the weakly bound outer shell electrons in the sample or were responsible for 
producing a wide variety of collective or crystal vibrations in the sample, such as phonon vibrations, 
plasmon oscillations, inter- or intra-band transitions; thus, it can provide information regarding the 
Figure 6. Schematic illustration of the atomic energy relaxation mechanisms involving the emission of X-Rays or Auger 
electrons [unpublished data from the chapter’s author].Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 125
electronic and optical properties of the sample. Finally, the high loss region of the spectrum (> 50 
eV) contains information related to the inelastic interactions of the electron beam with the inner￾shell electrons, remembering that this type of interactions convey the information that allows to 
identify the elements found in the specimen, and how they are bonded. Ionization edges observed 
in different energies are related to different elements, allowing to identify which elements can be 
found in the sample, while differences in the fine structure of these ionization edges can be related 
to the chemical (bonding) state in which the atoms are found within the sample, and structural 
(atomic arrangement) characteristics of the analyzed sample. Moreover, by selecting electrons with 
a specific energy loss, with specialized slits, an image can be formed associated with them; in this 
way, the elemental distribution inside the specimen can be directly visualized (Elemental Mapping). 
7. TEM characterization of nanoparticles 
Metallic nanoparticles have been widely used in biotechnology applications (Morones et al. 
2005, Elechiguerra et al. 2005, Martinez Sanchez et al. 2007). One of the most known cases is the 
bactericidal effect several metallic nanoparticles have shown, particularly the case of silver (Morones 
et al. 2005). The antibacterial properties of silver have been known and used by humanity for a very 
long time; however, nanotechnology allowed a better understanding of this property, and opened 
new areas that allowed its improvement. The higher reactivity displayed by metallic nanoparticles, 
related to their higher surface-to-volume ratio along with their crystallographic surface structure, 
Figure 7. (a) Low-loss region of the Electron Energy Loss Spectrum (EELS), including the zero-loss peak (< 50 eV). 
(b) High-loss region of the spectrum, considering energies above 50 eV (Garcia 2006).126 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
has been proven to affect the bactericidal properties of silver nanoparticles, since nanoparticles in 
the size range between 1–10 nm have been proven to show an increased interaction with bacteria, 
mainly due to the fact that small silver nanoparticles are highly faceted, with a high density of (111) 
facets on their surface. This (111) facets have been observed to strongly interact with the membrane 
of bacteria, being able to even penetrate within the bacteria (Morones et al. 2005). Another case 
where the size and surface crystallographic arrangements of silver nanoparticles was determinant 
in the interaction with another biomolecule or microorganism was in the interaction with the HIV-I 
virus (Elechiguerra et al. 2005). In this case, silver nanoparticles within this size range attached to 
the surface of the HIV-I virus; however, the arrangement of the nanoparticles on the surface of the 
viruses suggest they interact with the virus by preferentially interacting with the glycoprotein gp 
120. This conclusion was drawn from two known facts: the center-to-center distance between the 
nanoparticles coincides with the distance between this type of glycoproteins, and the fact that the 
gp 120 glycoprotein knobs have exposed sulfur-bearing residues that would be attractive sites for 
nanoparticle interaction, specially metallic nanoparticles. As a consequence, this interaction between 
the silver nanoparticles and the gp 120 glycoprotein would inhibit the virus from binding to the cells 
(Elechiguerra et al. 2005). For these applications, it is crucial to possess the ability to measure, 
with the highest accuracy, the size of the silver nanoparticles used, and only electron microscopy 
techniques allow to measure nanoparticles in that size range in a reliable and reproducible manner. 
Additionally, HRTEM images, in combination with HRTEM image simulations, allow to determine 
the crystallographic facets found on the surface of the nanoparticles, which has been proven to be 
very important in determining the interaction between the microorganisms and metallic nanoparticles 
(Figures 8 and 9).
Specific crystallographic facets forming on the nanoparticles’ surface are determined by the 
nucleation and growth mechanism occurring during their synthesis. One of the most influential 
factors determining the crystallographic facets found on the surface of nanoparticles is the capping 
ligand used during the synthesis (Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2018). In Figure 10, HRTEM images from 
semiconductor nanoparticles are shown, indicating the presence of two types of crystallographic 
facets on their surface, (100) and (111) facets. In that particular study, the capping layers based 
on shorter C-chain carboxylic acids increased the presence of (100) facets on the surface of the 
nanoparticles, while longer C-chain carboxylic acids increased the presence of (111) facets; these 
variations had an important effect on the final electronic structure displayed by the semiconductor 
nanoparticles as well (Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2018).
Other important applications of metallic and oxide nanoparticles in the biotechnology field 
are associated to their ability to deliver immunotherapeutic agents to specific target areas, related 
to their potential for dense and versatile surface functionalization (Evans et al. 2018, Raymond 
et al. 2012, Burt et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2011, Moreno-Cortez et al. 2015), their capacity to be used 
for optical or heat-based therapeutic methods, such as hyperthermia induction (Evans et al. 2018, 
Garza-Navarro et al. 2010, Torres-Martinez et al. 2014, Torres-Martinez et al. 2013, Ravichandran 
et al. 2015, Ravichandran et al. 2015, Torraya-Brown et al. 2014), and the biolabeling capabilities 
that have shown several semiconductor nanoparticles (Cheng-An et al. 2007, Gee and Xu 2018, 
Campargue et al. 2020). 
Gold nanoparticles are among the most used when immunotherapeutic applications are 
intended. This is due to several factors; among them, the following can be highlighted: the 
wide variety of synthesis methods available, the tunability these methods offer on their final 
morphological characteristics, along with their optical response, and the flexibility these 
synthesis methods offer on the gold nanoparticles’ surface functionalization (Raymond et al. 
2012, Burt et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2011). In all these aspects, the reliable characterization offered 
by TEM is vital in determining the final characteristics displayed by the gold nanostructures 
intended for different biotechnological applications. Burt et al. (Burt et al. 2004) developed a 
synthesis method that used bovine serum albumin protein as the protective agent, to make gold Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 127

nanoparticles compatible with biotechnology applications. The synthesized gold nanoparticles were 
characterized by means of TEM techniques. STEM-HAADF studies allowed the easy observation 
and reliable measurement of the synthesized gold nanoparticles “attached” to the bovine serum 
albumin protein “film”. Figure 11 shows the STEM-HAADF images where gold nanoparticles 
can be observed as “bright spots”, since the intensity in this technique is directly related to 
the atomic number, Z, of the atoms found in the sample; since gold has a high atomic number 
(Z = 79), the gold nanoparticles can clearly be discerned from the organic bovine serum albumin 
protein surrounding them. The synthesized nanoparticles displayed average sizes between 1.4 nm 
and 1.8 nm; characterization of such small nanoparticles, particularly their size, is more reliable when 
performed via STEM-HAADF analysis, compared to conventional TEM or HRTEM. The HRTEM 
studies of the gold nanoparticles showed that the morphology and shape of the nanoparticles with 
such small average size varied from pentagonal, octahedral, to quasi-spherical (Figure 11 c–e). 
Metallic nanostructures, such as gold nanorods covered by a mesoporous silica capping layer, 
have also been studied as probes for imaging cancer cells (Wang et al. 2011). In this particular 
system, the fluorescence and Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) signals can be generated Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 129

and processed independently, depending on the excitation wavelength used during the analysis. 
Moreover, these signals can potentially be used for multiplexed imaging in living cells, compared 
with traditional imaging probes. In this type of nanostructures, an accurate measurement of the 
nanorods’ dimensions is very important, since the specific dimensions will determine the plasmon 
excitation energies displayed by the nanorods (Figure 12). Moreover, conventional TEM can also 
show the mesoporous silica layer covering the gold nanorods, allowing the measurement of the 
thickness of the capping layer (Figure 12B).
Magnetic nanoparticles have been widely studied for biotechnology applications, such as 
contrast agent for MRI studies, drug delivery agents, and hyperthermia inductors (Garza-Navarro

et al. 2010, Torres-Martinez et al. 2014, Torres-Martinez et al. 2013, Ravichandran et al. 2015, 
Ravichandran et al. 2015, Torraya-Brown et al. 2014). Hybrid nanostructured materials, combining 
a magnetic core with an organic shell are the typical structures sought for these kind of applications. 
For the case of the magnetic core, oxide nanoparticles are the most commonly used, in particular 
the iron oxide nanoparticles. However, it is important to mention that a reliable characterization of 
the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles is extremely important since slight variations in the crystal 
structure of the nanoparticles can translate into large variations in their magnetic properties. Hence, 
a reliable methodology to characterize their composition, morphology and crystal structure is vital, 
with TEM, and their related techniques, being the most used and trusted techniques to perform such 
characterization. 
A hybrid nanostructured material (HNM) based on spinel metal oxide nanoparticles and a biopolymer 
was synthesized and characterized by Garza-Navarro et al. (Garza-Navarro et al. 2010). In that study, 
the authors synthesized spinel metal oxide (SMO) nanoparticle of MnF2
O4
 embedded in a chitosan 
biopolymer matrix. However, due to the small size of the nanoparticles (size range between 1.8 nm – 8 nm) 
and the chitosan matrix around them, a reliable confirmation of the chemical composition was very 
challenging. For this case, an image Cs
 corrector microscope (IC-TEM) was employed to perform 
the study. Image and probe Cs
 correctors were developed in the early 2000s, and they allowed 
to improve the resolution of electron microscopes down to their current limits, close to 50 pm

(Judith et al. 2012). With this improved resolution, and in combination with an EELS analysis, it 
was possible to confirm the desired composition of the synthesized MnFe2
O4 nanoparticles. In the 
EELS spectrum shown in Figure 13c, clear oxygen (O), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) signals 
can be detected in the nanoparticles indicated with arrows in the IC-HRTEM images shown in 
Figures 13a and b. 
In a continuation of the previous study, magnetic SMO nanoparticles stabilized in ovoid￾like carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC)/cetyltrimethylammonium-bromide (CTAB) templates were 
synthesized, and thoroughly characterized via TEM techniques (Torres-Martinez et al. 2013). This 
HNM was synthesized by controlling the hydrolysis of the inorganic iron salts, used as precursors, 
into aqueous dissolutions with CMC and CTAB. The competition between the CTAB and SMO 
nanoparticles to occupy the CMC intermolecular sites close to their carboxylates functional groups, 
allows to manipulate the size of the SMO nanoparticles and the CMC/CTAB ovoid like templates, 
just by adjusting the CTAB/SMO ratio, affecting not only the morphology of the HNM, but also 
its magnetic response (Torres-Martinez et al. 2013). Conventional TEM studies (Bright Field 
image) allowed the characterization of the shape and size of the organic CMC/CTAB template 
(Figure 14a), whereas STEM-HAADF studies enabled the observation of small SMO nanoparticles 
within the CMC/CTAB templates (Figure 14b), even when BF images didn’t show the presence 
of such small nanoparticles within the organic template. This was possible due to the great 
atomic number difference between the organic CMC/CTAB template, and the composition of the

SMO nanoparticles, and the fact that the signal intensity in this technique is directly related to 
the composition of the sample. In the synthesis conditions that produced “larger” nanoparticles, 
measuring and characterizing such SMO nanoparticles were not as challenging, their observation 
being obvious in BF images (Figure 14c). HRTEM images allowed the measurement of the 
interplanar distances present in the synthesized SMO nanoparticles (Figure 14d) and contributed 
to finally characterize the crystal structure of the nanoparticles through a selected area electron 
diffraction (SAED) study, confirming the spinel crystal structure obtained in the synthesized 
nanoparticles. This is an example of the versatility the TEM offers to characterize nanoparticles. 
Using one instrument was possible to characterize the organic template of the HNM, at least its 
size and shape; the size, morphology, composition, and crystal structure of the different magnetic 
SMO nanoparticles; and how these nanoparticles are distributed within the organic phase to form 
the HNM. All this information allowed the understanding, interpretation and even tuning of the 
magnetic properties displayed by the synthesized HNM.
In similar studies, Ravichandran et al. (Ravichandran et al. 2015, Ravichandran et al. 2014) 
have synthesized cubic spinel cobalt ferrite (CoFe2
O4
) nanostructures for possible drug delivery and/
or T2
 MRI contrast agent applications. In this case, the CoFe2
O4
 nanostructures displayed a needle￾like morphology, with diameters around 15 nm and an aspect ratio close to 3:5. These nano-needles 
displayed a superparamagnetic behavior, with cell viability results that proved their biocompatibility 
for possible biotechnology applications. In this case, TEM conventional imaging (BF TEM) was 
used to study the size and morphology of the CoFe2
O4
 nanostructures synthesized; HRTEM results 
allowed the measurement of interplanar distances displayed by the nano-needles’ crystal structure. 
Also, EDXS results confirmed the chemical composition of the synthesized nanostructures, showing 
clear signals for the cobalt (Co), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O) in the EDXS spectra acquired, and finally, 
SAED studies confirmed the cubic spinel cobalt ferrite crystal structure. Examples of all these 
analyses are shown in Figure 15.
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) of semiconductor materials have displayed attractive optical 
properties, in particular the manipulation of their optical absorbance and emission signals, based 
on their size and surface chemistry control, as a consequence of quantum confinement effects 
(Garcia-Gutierrez 2018, Garcia-Gutierrez 2013, Garcia-Gutierrez 2014, Gregg 2003, Wise 2000). 
When CQDs are photo-excited, electron-hole pairs, known as excitons, are generated. An exciton 
is a quasiparticle derived as a consequence of the coulombic interaction between a hole in the 
valence band, or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and an electron in the conduction 
band, or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Gregg 2003). Upon recombination of these 
electron-hole pairs, fluorescence light is emitted, where it is possible to manipulate the wavelength 
of the emitted photon by controlling the size of the CQDs, with smaller CQDs showing smaller 
wavelengths (Wise 2000). Also, it has been proved that the surface chemistry, and the atomistic 
surface arrangement, play an important role in determining the final wavelength displayed by 
photons emitted by CQDs (Garcia-Gutierrez 2018). In this way, it is possible to tune the “color” 
of the light emitted by CQDs just by changing some of the reaction parameters, such as reaction 
time, temperature, precursors’ ratio, etc. Compared to common organic fluorophores, CQDs offer 
several interesting advantages, such as a continuous absorption spectra, narrow and symmetric 
emission spectra, significantly higher fluorescence lifetimes, and a reduced photobleaching (Cheng￾An et al. 2007). The most common semiconductor CQDs system studied, regarding their emission 
properties, are the cadmium chalcogenides (Murray et al. 1993). However, most common CQDs are 
synthesized in organic solvents; hence, it is imperative to perform ligand exchange procedures that 
allow replacing the organic soluble capping ligand for an aqueous soluble one (Gee and Xu 2018, 
Yu et al. 2006). This process also has the goal to increase the biocompatibility of the CQDs, which 
commonly are composed by elements with a high toxicity, such as Cd and Pb. 
One of the potential applications of such CQDs is cellular labeling (Cheng-An et al. 2007).

in cells; in this regard, CQDs can replace organic fluorophores as fluorescence marker of the 
antibody, taking advantage of all the emission properties previously described for the CQDs. Also, 
instead of labeling whole cells, specific molecules can be the target, making possible to track the 
movement of such molecules around the cells. CQDs can also be used to label cells and trace them 
in cell cultures. Labelling animal tissue is also a possible application of CQDs, aiming to develop 
the conditions to use them as contrast agents in human beings (Cai et al. 2006). In the particular 
application in human beings, CQDs have a great advantage, being possible to manipulate their 
emission wavelength deep into the infrared, just by adjusting their average size. Human skin can 
absorb light, which is a problem for labeling deep inside tissues; however, for the case of infrared 
light, human tissue only absorbs moderately this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
All these possible applications rely on the capability to measure the size of the synthesized 
CQDs in a reliable and reproducible way. The final emission wavelength sought will determine the 134 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
final size synthesized, which will also depend on the chemical composition. For the case of CQDs 
based on lead chalcogenides, when visible or near infrared emission is sought, their final size is 
close to 2 nm; measuring such small nanoparticles is more reliable in STEM-HAADF images than 
in conventional TEM or HRTEM images, as previously stated. The discussed characteristics of 
such signal reduced the uncertainty at the time of the size measurements in STEM-HAADF images 
(Figure 16), producing more reliable results. Ultrasmall lead sulfide CQDs were synthesized in the 
strong quantum confinement regime, displaying absorption and emission signals in the visible and 
near IR range (Torres-Gomez et al. 2020).
In addition to an accurate measurement of its size, it is also extremely important to determine 
CQDs’ chemical composition, as well as their crystal structure. Again, EDXS and SAED technique 
prove to be very useful for these purposes. Figure 17 shows the EDXS spectra and SAED pattern 
acquired for a group of lead selenide CQDs; these results confirmed the expected chemical 
composition and stoichiometry (PbSe), as well as the expected FCC crystal structure.
Another aspect critical in determining the optical properties of CQDs is their surface capping 
layer. In general, the characterization of the chemical nature of the layer covering CQDs is performed 
with the use of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy techniques (Burt et al. 2004, Garza-Navarro et al. 
2010, Torres-Martinez et al. 2014, Torres-Martinez et al. 2013, Gee and Xu 2018, Garcia. Gutierrez 
et al. 2013, Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2014 Torres-Gomez et al. 2020). Nonetheless, TEM techniques 
such as STEM-HAADF and EELS can contribute in determining their dimensions and chemical 
composition (Garcia-Gutierrez et al. 2014). In the case of lead telluride CQDs, it was possible to 
study the effect of the synthesis conditions on the “final thickness” displayed by the capping layer on 
these lead chalcogenide CQDs. Aberration corrected STEM (AC-STEM) images allowed the clear 
observation of the interface between the inorganic crystalline core of the CQDs, and the organic 
amorphous shell covering them. Additionally, EDXS and EELS results confirmed the presence of 
lead and tellurium in the core of the CQDs, while also confirming the presence of carbon (C), oxygen 
(O) and lead (Pb) in the amorphous shell, complementing the FTIR results, leading to the conclusion 
that the actual capping layer for this kind of CQDs, synthesized by the hot-injection method, display 
a lead oleate capping layer. For this measurement, the spatial resolution offered by the EELS study, 
in an AC-STEM instrument, was crucial, along with the high intensity of low atomic number, such 
as carbon (C) and oxygen (O), in the EELS technique, compared to EDXS. Figure 18 shows the 
AC-STEM images of the capping layer for different lead telluride CQDs, synthesized under different 
conditions, and the element line profile study performed, where the composition of the different 
regions in the CQD can be observed.
Another type of semiconductor nanoparticles with excellent photoemission properties that have 
gained a lot of attention from the scientific community in recent years are the inorganic perovskites 
nanoparticles (Manser et al. 2016, Paul 2018, Protesescu et al. 2015, Shamsi et al. 2018). This type 
of semiconductor nanoparticles exhibits the general formula ABX3
, where A is a cation with valence 
1+, normally Cs; B is also a cation with valence 2+, normally Pb; and X is a halogen (Cl, I, Br) 
with valence 1–. The intense emission displayed by this type of semiconductor nanoparticles can be 
tuned along the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, by changing the nanoparticle size, 
but mainly by changing the chemical composition, in particular the halogen atom. Studies are being 
carried out by several research groups all around the world trying to elucidate the nucleation and 
growth mechanisms of these type of semiconductor nanoparticles. Shamsi et al. (Shamsi et al. 2018) 
have studied the transformations occurring when using CsX (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals with a cubic 
crystal structure, and homogeneous size distribution, as the precursor to grow CsPbX3
 (X = Cl, 
Br, I) perovskite nanoparticles. They used HRTEM to characterize the evolution of the perovskite 
nanoparticles formation. HRTEM studies allowed the determination of the growth mechanism of the 
perovskite nanoparticles started from the outside of the CsX nanoparticles, promoting the Cs+
 cation 
exchange for Pb2+ cations forming, in the early stages of the reaction, a core-shell structure, where Electron Microscopy Characterization of Nanoparticles 135

the shell was formed by CsPbX3
 perovskite, and the core was cubic CsX, as it was observed in the 
HRTEM images shown in Figure 19.
Finally, advancements in TEM technology electron-optics have reached a resolution limit close 
to 50 pm in commercially available EM equipment. The availability of Cs
-correctors for the objective 
lens, capable of correcting the spherical aberration in the HRTEM images, or in the electron probe 
in STEM mode, has opened a window to reach resolution limits, even smaller than Bohr’s radius, in 
almost any well-prepared electron microscopy lab in the world. In recent years, the EM community 
has stopped their attempts to reach smaller resolutions, recognizing the fact that the information 
that could be acquired from smaller resolutions would be “difficult” to interpret. On the other hand, 
it has directed their efforts in attempts to study phenomenon, such as the nucleation and growth of 
nanoparticles, as they occur in real time. The combination of the superb spatial resolution displayed 
by current EM, along with their increased mechanical, electrical and thermal stability, and the in situ
capabilities offered by different sample holder technologies, has opened a whole new field within 
the EM community. The in situ or in-operando studies represent the frontier in EM nowadays. There 
are plenty of advantages the biotechnology community could take from this new frontier in EM￾from studies to better understand the nucleation and growth mechanisms as the nanoparticles are 
being synthesized, to the interaction between nanoparticles and microorganisms as it is happening 
in real time. The possibilities are enormous, just limited by the imagination and creativity of the 
researchers. As an example, Hutzler et al. (Hutzler et al. 2018) studied the growth mechanism of 
silver shell on gold nanorods using an in situ liquid cell TEM with an advanced architecture. Their 
advanced design was based on microwells where the liquid was confined between a thin Si3
N4
 thin 
film on one side and a few layers of graphene on the other. This well-defined sample thickness, and an 
ultra-flat cell top, made possible the application of HRTEM analysis combined with analytical TEM 
techniques, such as EDXS and EELS, in this type of samples and in situ studies. This combination 
of HRTEM data with the chemical information provided by the EDXS results provided completely 
new insights into the growth of these silver shell gold nanorods. It was shown that silver bromide 
nanoparticles, formed in the stock solution, play an important role in the exchange of silver ions. 
HRTEM images, along with EDXS results, as shown in Figure 20, showed that the silver shell 
growth was correlated to the dissolution of the silver bromide nanoparticles.138 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
8. Conclusions
TEM is the most versatile technique available for the characterization of nanoparticles. Understanding 
the fundamentals of the different signals offered by this technique is very important to make a better 
interpretation of the results acquired. A high energy electron beam possesses a small wavelength, 
determined by the De Broglie wavelength equation, making it possible to analyze objects in 
the angstrom, even in the picometer scale due to the development of Cs
 corrector technology. 
Additionally, the interaction between this high energy electron beam and the analyzed sample 
produces a wide variety of signals carrying information on the elastic and inelastic interactions the 
electrons on the beam undergo when traveling through the sample. All the signals related to these 
electron beam—specimen interactions give rise to the different TEM techniques, which are useful 
for the study and characterization of nanoparticles for biotechnology applications. It was shown 
that determining the size, morphology, chemical composition, crystal structure, atomistic surface 
arrangement and capping layer nature, are among the most important characteristics required to 
know for a nanoparticle system intended for biotechnology applications. TEM related techniques 
can provide all the relevant information about these characteristics when the proper signals are 
correctly analyzed and interpreted. Additionally, the in situ and in-operando modes of analysis in 
TEM open a whole new world of opportunities and possibilities in studying the interaction between 
living systems and nanoparticles.

Magnetic Characterization of 
Nanoparticles
Marlene González Montiel
1. Introduction
The magnetic behavior of nanoparticles smaller than 100 mn—dimension similar to the domain 
wall width (Bean 1955, Kittel 1946)—is usually described, among other factors, by its volume, 
shape, and embedded matrix because they behave as single domain particles (see Figure 1c). These 
particles are able to inverse their magnetization merely by means of rotating their macroscopic 
magnetic moment, a mechanism initially proposed by Stoner-Wohlfarth (Stoner and Wohlafarth 
1948), who neglected dipolar interactions and thermal agitation for simplicity’s sake. This simple, 
but useful model, considered almost spherical magnetic nanoparticles of V volume and Ms
 saturation 
magnetization with permanent magnetic moment m = Ms
V along which the anisotropy energy Ek
is minimum as the magnetic moment can be aligned in a privileged magnetization axis (so-called 
easy axis). This alignment is dependent on the effective anisotropy density constant K (which is 
proportional to the particle size) and the angle between m and the easy axis θ:
Ek
 = KVsin2
 (θ) (1)
At low temperatures (absolute zero) and applied fields lower than the critical field for moment 
inversion (or reversal), the Stoner-Wohlfarth model suggested the existence of two equilibrium 
situations in the energy scenery (see Figure 1) in which the m moment can hop between up and 
down positions with a characteristic relaxation time (τ) because of thermal agitation. This relaxation 
time is obtained by the Arrhenius-Néel law (Neel 1949) and can be determined by the energy barrier 
KV = ΔE, the frequency f
0
 with the magnitude order of the magnetic moment precession frequency, 
and the Botzman constant kB.

By using the initial susceptibility, the magnetic response of the nanoparticle system can then 
be described as the temperature variation of the initial susceptibility, which comprises two different 
regimes: (1) superparamagnetic particles exhibiting rapid relaxation and (2) thermally stable 142 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
particles exhibiting irreversible magnetic behavior. It must be noticed that, in the Stoner-Wohlfarth 
model, neither phase transition nor abnormality occurs when the moment of a particle transits from 
the thermally stable state to the superparamagnetic state.
The characteristic measuring time τm (time window) of the applied experimental technique 
strongly influences the measured magnetic behavior in nanoparticle systems due to its connection 
to the intrinsic relaxation time τ of the system that is associated with the energy barrier. The time 
window can vary from slow values—as in magnetometry assessments (usually 100s)—to very fast 
ones—as in Mössbauer spectroscopy (10–8 s). When τm >> τ, the relaxation is quicker in this time 
window than the magnetization orientation, which allows the system to reach thermodynamical 
equilibrium because the nanoparticles are in superparamagnetic regime (Neel 1949). Conversely, 
when the system relaxation occurs very slowly, τ >> τm, the quasi-static properties of the system can 
be seen as ordered magnetic arrangements (the nanoparticles are in the so-called blocked regime). 
The blocking temperature TB is then the inflexion transition point from both regimes (slow and quick 
relaxation) and is influenced by the characteristic measuring time τm. TB is also associated with the 
energy barrier for reversal, KV, and thereby grows when the particle size upsurges (Knobel et al. 
2008). For example, the relation between the critical particle size for a superparamagnetic system 
and the blocking temperature is directly proportional when τm = 100s: 
TB
~~ KV/25kB
(3) 
Figure 1. (a) Angular dependence of the energy barrier reversal for ideal superparamagnetic systems. The continuous line 
is for zero field and the dotted line is for a field lower than the coercive field (see Section 2). Above TB, the thermal 
effects allow flips of the magnetic moments between the easy magnetization directions by getting over the energy barriers 
in zero applied magnetic field and consequently the coercivity HC = 0. (b) The easy rotation axis for a fine particle (see also 
Section 2). (c) In ideal, non-interacting nanoparticles’ systems (superparamagnetic), the particles are very small (typically 
RSP< 20 nm) and belong to a single domain. The critical size value (RC) depends on the former components, i.e., for 
Fe3
O4 nanoparticles, this size is widely estimated to be around 76 nm (Li et al. 2017).Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 143
Hence, from Equation 3, it can be inferred that bigger particles become superparamagnetic 
at higher temperatures. Consequently, different particle size in a nanoparticle system will have 
different blocking temperatures.
In ideal, non-interacting and nanostructured metallic and metal oxide systems, the particles 
are very small and belong to a single domain (see Figure 1) that is below the critical volume size. 
For this reason, the thermal energy at which a measurement is done is enough to equilibrate the 
magnetization of a nanoparticle’s assemblage in shorter time than it takes to do the measurement 
(Neel 1949). As such, particles present a magnetization with long range order, and behave as 
superparamagnetic. 
Nevertheless, in a real sample measurement, the nanoparticle’s size is not always monodisperse, 
as some of the nanoparticles are below the critical size (superparamagnetic) and others remain 
above the critical size (thermally stable particles). Different particle sizes imply different anisotropy 
barrier KV. For this reason, a detailed information about the particle size distribution, shape and 
surface contributions in the magnetic system of nanoparticles must be taken into account for real 
polidisperse or non-spherical (anisotropic) systems. 
The role of dipolar interactions (Hansen 1998) between particles must also be mentioned 
because many studies of magnetic nanoparticles revealed the magnetic behavior of either ‘‘weakly” 
or as ‘‘strongly” interacting systems, yet many efforts have been made to synthesize adequate 
systems in the laboratory that can be used to test and scrutinize the existing theoretical models 
to fully comprehend the role of dipolar interactions in the description of magnetic nanoparticles 
(Knobel et al. 2008).
When dealing with real systems, it is very complex to identify the contribution of each effect 
such as size, shape, and anisotropy origins (magnetocrystalline, shape, stress or surface) in the 
final measurement; it requires an excellent magnetic nanoparticle synthetic route grade, and more 
importantly, a basis to elucidate the relationship between their interactions and intrinsic properties. 
In this regard, samples that are synthesized, nearly monodispersed, and uniformly shaped (Rivas 
Rojas et al. 2018) may offer a satisfying accord between the known models and the data that is 
obtained from the magnetic characterization measurements.
This chapter’s aim is to expound some of the usual magnetic characterization techniques and 
the parameters obtained from their analysis to describe magnetic nanoparticles’ isotropic systems. 
As seen below, miscellaneous nanoparticles’ systems are discussed to elucidate their best description 
with the support of recognized author’s works, models and approaches known in literature, hoping 
that this compilation helps the reader to decide on the model/approach which fits the most with his/
her research and magnetic data processing.
2. (ZFC-FC) zero field cooling-field cooling measurements 
The (ZFC-FC) Zero Field Cooling-Field Cooling is a procedure that consists of magnetization 
measurements as a function of varying (decreasing or increasing) temperature routine. First, the 
sample is cooled with non-applied magnetic external field usually from room temperature (300 K), 
where all nanoparticles regularly show superparamagnetic behavior, to the lowermost accessible 
temperature (near 1.8 K in Helium liquid Magnetometers). At that moment, a small and constant 
magnetic external field that is commonly around 8 × 103 A/m (~~ 100 Oe) is turned on while 
the sample is heated until it reaches the highest temperature from which it was initially cooled 
(i.e., 300 K), temperature adequate to detect an early growth and posterior decrease of its 
magnetization. Finally, the sample is immediately cooled again until it reaches the lowermost 
temperature while the external applied field is still turned on (see Figures 2, 3 inset and 6).144 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

correlating the particle size radius obtained by Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering 
with the radius obtained by using simple ZFC-FC measurements. The Rprob radius was found to be 10 Å greater than that 
obtained by TEM; the authors ascribed this difference to a magnetic correlation between particles attributed to direct contact 
or dipolar interactions. Reprinted with permission from Micha et al. 2004.Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 145
2.1 Non interacting, monodisperse magnetic particles
In ideal, mono-sized and non-interacting magnetic nanoparticles, the system performs a transition 
among irreversible and reversible states throughout the ZFC-FC routine. During this transition, a 
narrow temperature region is expected, while warming with a turned-on applied field, the thermal 
energy kBT is firstly smaller than the anisotropy barrier KV and consequently the magnetization 
remains insignificant. Once kB T ≅ KV (see Equation 2), the magnetization increases rapidly to 
its value of thermodynamic equilibrium, describing the irreversible/reversible regime transition 
region owing to the exponential variation of the Néel relaxation time on the temperature (Bean 
and Livingston 1959). The inflection point (IP) of this increase can be designated as the Blocking 
temperature TB in this kind of well isolated systems (Bruvera et al. 2015). This criterion has 
been reported in several works, where the analyzed systems are considered as monodisperse and 
each nanoparticle is well separated between them, which results in a ZFC shape with a narrow, 
symmetrical and well defined peak (Medina et al. 2020).
A good way to differentiate a non-interacting magnetic nanoparticles’ arrangement from 
an interacting one is well exemplified by Allia et al. (Allia et al. 2014), where a characteristic 
performance (from the ZFC profile) related with an almost non-interacting and monodisperse 
superparamagnetic nanoparticles system is described for Fe3
O4
 in a silica matrix nanoparticles as 
depicted in Figure 2. As seen there, the ZFC shape of the peak described by the Fe3
O4
 in a silica 
matrix nanoparticles corresponds with a narrow, symmetrical and well defined form, whereas for 
the bare Fe3
O4
 nanoparticles sample, magnetic interactions between particles (or polidisperse size 
distribution) are anticipated owing to the shape of its ZFC curve (see Figure 2). Here, a wide spread 
peak is perceived along a wide temperature range, and depending on the author, this maximum 
value will not necessarily match with the maximum of the ZFC peak, TMAX (see Section 1.2). In this 
example, the difference between bare Fe3
O4
 and Fe3
O4
 in a silica matrix particles was attributed 
to the distinct size distributions of the two different magnetic nanoparticles systems (aggregates) 
and not entirely negligible interactions on the bare Fe3
O4
 nanoparticles. It is also important to 
notice that the ZFC-FC curve from bare Fe3
O4
 particles presents higher maximum than the Fe3
O4
in a silica matrix particles. As depicted in Equation 3, bigger particles are expected because they 
become superparamagnetic at higher temperatures. Thus, TMAX = TB just when the larger number of 
nanoparticles within the sample are all blocked. Nevertheless, if the system presents a large size 
distribution, this method, TMAX = TB, could be the worst to use because the difference between the 
real TB and the TMAX can be as big as the double of its number (Bean and Livingston 1959).
2.2 Non interacting, polydisperse magnetic particles
As the particle size is proportional to the anisotropy barrier KV (and size also influences the 
nanoparticles’ relaxation times), a TB is expected for each different size contribution in a polydisperse 
nanoparticle system. This section makes this assumption despite the discordance between some 
articles in the literature, where the use of maximum temperature (TMAX) and the Inflection point (IP) 
criteria is still reported assuming monodisperse and non-interacting magnetic nanoparticles even in 
polydisperse systems. The assumption of using different approaches was well defined and defended 
by expert theoretical and experimental groups around the world to describe more realistic magnetic 
nanoparticles systems, where polydisperse and interacting samples are more usually obtained in the 
laboratory. Nevertheless, it is important to remind the reader that monodisperse and non-interacting 
magnetic nanoparticles are very difficult (but not impossible) to obtain when using good synthetic 
methods and good experimental mounting of the analyzed samples during measurements.146 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
In this context, Micha et al. (Micha et al. 2004) described the use of magnetic measurements in 
relation to the magnetic nanoparticle size. In this article, they use an easy method for nanoparticles’ 
size estimation and assume an arrangement of spherical, non-interacting and polydisperse magnetic 
particles, in which the distribution of the particle size ensemble can be determined and characterized 
by using ZFC-FC measurements. In this case, the blocking temperature TB is determined as the ZFC 
and FC intersection, which is associated with both the effective magnetic anisotropy constant K and 
to the largest particle RMAX radius by the relation:
4π
3 R3
MAX = 25kBTB
/K (4) 
All the ensemble nanoparticles are superparamagnetic above the blocking temperature TB. 
Meanwhile, a gradual blocking of minor particles occurs when T < TB since a critical radius R 
corresponds to a temperature T agreeing with Equation (4). The projection along the externally 
applied magnetic field (in this case, Micha et al. used 100 Oe ~~ 8 × 103 A/m) is provided by the 
ZFC magnetization measurement of the magnetic moment of randomly frozen particles, for they 
have greater radius than and the contribution of the superparamagnetic, polarized particles have 
a radius that is smaller than R. On the other hand, the projection of greater particles (polarized 
frozen moments) and smaller particles (polarized superparamagnetic ones) is provided by the FC 
magnetization measurements. Therefore, the blocking distribution of temperatures and the radius 
distribution can be deduced from the derivative of the difference between ZFC–FC measurements, 
d(MFC–MZFC)
⁄dT (see Figure 3). In Micha et al.’s work, the volume distribution stayed denoted by 
an asymmetric log-normal distribution (although other distributions can be used as described by El￾Hilo (El-Hilo 2012)). Since the FC curve becomes flat at low temperatures, the most probable radius 
Rprob is simply obtained from the ZFC(T) curve’s inflexion point at T1
 (Equation 5).
4π
3 R3
prob = 25kBT1
/K (5)
 Above the blocking temperature TB, the Curie-Weiss law can be applied and the radius RCW can 
be obtained from the susceptibility variation (Equation 6):
MCW (H, T) = 
M2
SH
3kB(T – θCW) R3
CW (6)
where MS
, θCW, and kB are the saturation magnetization of the analyzed ion, the Curie-Weiss 
temperature and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. The difference concerning RMAX, Rprob, and RCW
radii is influenced by the MS
 and K values and the size distribution of the analyzed metal or ion 
nanoparticles. These assumptions are not attained by supposing strictly monodisperse systems.
A very similar work defending the d(MFC–MZFC)
/dT criterion was reported by Mamiya et al. 
(Mamiya et al. 2005). It uses Equation 1 and different theoretical approaches ascribed to the 
fluctuations of the direction of magnetization that is frozen in a narrow range of temperatures around 
TB. Using an excellent theoretical methodology, Mamiya et al. (2005) state that the difference between 
ΔMFC–MZFC in the range between T and T + ΔT is proportional to the distribution of polydispersive
nanoparticles even with an external applied magnetic field H. However, Mamiya et al. (2005) recall 
that the fluctuations in each particle are really frozen just in the interval among 0.9 TB and 1.05 TB. 
Consequently, the statement of the abrupt particles freezing is an oversimplification for both ideal 
monodispersive and polydispersive systems when their dynamics are strictly analyzed.
More recently, Bruvera et al. (Bruvera et al. 2015) compared the aforementioned methods 
for non-interacting particles (Inflection point (IP), the maximum temperature (TMAX) criteria and Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 147
the derivative d(MFC – MZFC)
/dT method) when applied to polysize nanoparticles with log normal 
distribution. They used the Stoner-Wolfarth model by introducing thermal agitation to numerically 
estimate their ZFC-FC curves and considering all the particles’ easy axes aligned with the same 
direction of the field. In this work, Bruvera et al. simulated numerous samples with different particle 
sizes (polysized) by means of diverse parameter sets, fluctuating the scale parameter σ of the log’s 
normal number distribution and the mean magnetic nanoparticles radius. From this, they obtained 
the TB distribution from the sum of monosize curves to construct the polysize simulation to later 
compare the results with the ZFC-FC derivative. As a result, all the simulated cases of 〈TB〉 that 
were compared to the ZFC-FC derivative were identical and remained constant for different scale 
parameters σ. In contrast, the simulated polysized curve that was compared to the IP value moved 
towards lower temperatures while the TMAX simulated curve shifted in the opposite direction (see 
Figure 4).
Additionally, Bruvera et al. tested their simulations by comparing them with experimental 
measurements from magnetite magnetic nanoparticles in hexane to associate the TB simulated 
distribution by means of the ZFC-FC derivative curve with the size information obtained from 
Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). Figure 5 shows this evaluation with a very good 
correspondence. 
Therefore, after seeing that Bruvera et al. strongly support the validity of Micha-Mamiya’ s 
method in polydisperse nanoparticles systems, this section strongly encourages the reader to use the 
derivative method in polydisperse nanoparticles systems.

2.3 Interacting magnetic particles
It is well known that, in real nanoparticle systems, a big proportion of the atoms belonging to each 
nanoparticle are in the surface. In this case, the easier way to diminish that surface energy is by 
aggregating or agglomerating nanoparticles. The aggregation of a group of nanoparticles is not 
desirable because the aggregate will behave as a macro particle. Therefore, some external coating 
agents are usually used to avoid interaction or agglomeration of small nanoparticles that may affect 
the macroscopic magnetic properties in concentrated systems. The election of a matrix or coating 
agent will help obtain long distanced nanoparticles with almost negligible interactions between 
them or controlled dipolar interactions if the particles are embedded in a matrix where the separation 
between them is small enough. 
Well-separated nanoparticles are desirable to avoid interactions between them because the 
models used for non-interacting superparamagnetic particles are not adequate to describe the 
results obtained by experimental characterization (Knobel et al. 2008, Moscoso-Londoño et al. 
2017, Rivas Rojas et al. 2018), as it was described in the previous section. It is almost impossible 
to differentiate in real ZFC-FC curves each interaction contribution that is related to the samples 
with a polydisperse distribution or with different shape (non-spherical), for the behavior of 
each blocked particle near TB can be related to mechanisms that are not addressed yet, such as 
the anisotropy that can be attributed to single or collective origin (Bitoh et al. 1995, Knobel 
et al. 2008, Mamiya et al. 1998). Therefore, to clarify the nature of the slowdown blocked-particles 
near TB, some authors recalled the idea of controlled interacting systems, as will be described in this 
section. Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 149
2.3.1 Dipolar interactions 
Mamiya et al. (Mamiya et al. 2004) pointed out that, around the vicinity of TB, the slowdown 
mechanism of monodispersive particles with controllable inter-particle interactions must be 
ascribed to cooperative dipolar interactions, that are able to vary the blocking barrier heights. These 
interactions influence the transitional region n(TB) between paramagnetic and superparamagnetic 
states. Therefore, by analyzing the MZFC and MFC curves, Mamiya et al. constructed a model for 
the blocking of each spherical particle that results from anisotropy (Bean and Livingston 1959) by 
introducing an interacting term Jdd into each barrier height:
EB = 4/3 KπR3 + ΔE(Jdd) (7)
where K is the anisotropy constant and R the sphere radius. Since TB ∝ EB, the ΔE(Jdd) term is related 
with the TB via the n(TB) distribution variation when the value of Jdd increase. In this model, n(TB) 
distributes beginning from low TBL to high TBH. Then, the MZFC and MFC show the features defined 
in Figure 6a inset: above TBH, both temperatures are equal as the system is sufficiently equilibrated, 
while below TBL, the MZFC is different from the MFC as the fluctuations are altogether blocked. 
Using this model, Mamiya et al. compared the magnetic response through the nTB distribution of 
approximately mono-dispersive, magnetic nanoparticle systems that are randomly ordered, which 
differed merely in their dipolar interactions’ strength. Mamiya’s group conclusions also demonstrated 
how dipolar interactions among mono-dispersive, magnetic nanoparticle systems that are randomly 
ordered can originate a change in the individual blocking mechanism to turn it into a spin-glass-like 
or any other kind of collective, magnetic spin rotations, depending on the analyzed system, as stated 
in a very recommendable review from Knobel et al. (Knobel et al. 2008). In this review, Knobel 
et al. outline how important are controlled dipolar interactions in some nanoparticles assemblies, 
how their presence has repercussions in the magnetic particles alignment at lower temperatures 
and in the shape of the nTB distribution, which advances relevant documentation related with the 
microscopic mechanisms implicated in the particle magnetic moment rotation.

temperatures is reflected in a non saturation of the magnetization and changes in the coercive field during the Magnetization

2.3.2 Surface effect interactions
As mentioned in the beginning of the current section, the interactions in nanoparticles’ systems can 
also be attributed to surface effects even when dealing with bigger particles. The surface effects are 
mainly attributed to the lower coordination number (spin disorder) on the broken exchange bonds in 
the surface of the particles (Neel 1949, Zysler et al. 2003), which unavoidably causes misalignment 
of the spins that belong to the surface regarding the orderly spins linked to the core in small size 
nanoparticles. This spin disorder on the surface might disseminate inside the core of the particle, 
making the superparamagnetic model no longer valid, where ideal and single domained particles 
with spins pointing in the same direction with coherent fluctuations are assumed.
For instance, to illustrate the later point, De Biasi et al. (De Biasi et al. 2005) reported a lower 
magnetization in the surface than in the core when using the Metropolis algorithm and Monte Carlo 
simulations with amorphous Co-Ni and Fe-Ni-B nanoparticles to provide a clear evidence of how 
the interactions in the core-surface interface and the superficial anisotropies alter the particle’s 
anisotropy barriers at low temperatures and, therefore, the distribution as well as the collective 
alignment of the particles at very low temperatures. A similar experimental work is being achieved 
by M. Gonzalez M. et al. (M. González M. et al. unpublished data) by analyzing different NiCoFe 
layered double hydroxides, where from analyzing the MZFC and MFC measurements (see Figure 6a, 
zoom region), a broad maximum of the MZFC is expected for a broad TB distribution associated with 
the anisotropy energy barriers’ distribution. Nevertheless, another but sharper maximum of MZFC is 
depicted at much lower temperatures. The observed sharp peak at low temperatures TF is attributed 
to the freezing of surface spins in this temperature region, where the surface spin fluctuations delay 
allows short-range interactions between the spins belonging to the surface forming magnetically 
correlated spins regions (De Biasi et al. 2002) that lastly lead to distorted and frozen superficial spins 
states (M. González M. et al. unpublished data, Zysler et al. 2003) reflected in the non saturation 
of the magnetization and changes in the coercive field during the Magnetization versus Applied 
magnetic field measurements (see Section 2.1.3 and Figure 6b).
As outlined in this section, very valuable information about the distribution size in nanoparticles 
systems and some of the mechanisms involved in the particles magnetic moments alignment, 
attributed to the matrix they are into, can be obtained by a proper and careful analysis of the MZFC
and MFC curves though, as pointed out in the previous paragraph, other measurements are also 
desirable to complement and achieve additional information concerning the analysed nanoparticles 
system, as shall be described in Sections 2 and 3.
3. (M Vs H) magnetization Vs applied magnetic field measurements
The (M Vs H) Magnetization Vs Applied Magnetic Field procedure consists of magnetization 
measurements (M) in a specific temperature (isothermal measurement) while an imposed magnetic 
field is externally applied (H). The external field variation grows from the null value until it reaches 
the complete alignment of all nanoparticle magnetic moments in large positive or negative H 
external field values (usually around 7 T in commercial magnetometers). This is called saturation, 
which is not always achieved, as described in Section 1.3.2 due to surface effects. The external field 
variation from positive, then returning to negative values until finally reaching (again) the positive 
branch saturation is called Hysteresis loop (see Figure 7). 
The model of magnetization reversal in non-interacting particles belonging to a single domain 
that is presented by Stoner-Wohlfart and was described in the previous section offers adequate 
description about the increased coercivity value below TB. In this case, the thermal energy (KT) is 
not able to overcome the magnetic anisotropy (KV), then the direction of each magnetic moment 
particle starts to fluctuate and rotate from the applied magnetic field backwardly to the nearby easy 
magnetization axis resulting in a non-null coercivity value. Nevertheless, when the thermal effects Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 151
can overcome the energy barriers in zero applied magnetic field, a coercivity HC = 0 is expected at 
temperatures above TB, since the anisotropy barrier is overwhelmed, which allows the flips of the 
magnetic moments between the easy magnetization directions (see Figure 1 and 7). 
3.1 Langevin function
3.1.1 Non interacting, monodisperse magnetic particles
The magnetization hysteresis (M Vs H) curves for ideal, superpamagnetic, and non-interacting 
particles that are supposed to rotate coherently usually present a sigmoidal shape with fast saturation, 
zero coercivity HC = 0, and remanence MR = 0. This happens in thermodynamically equilibrated 
systems (Tamion et al. 2010) where the anisotropic term is not taken into account since it is assumed 
to be very low. This statement attends to the classical paramagnetic models, which considers greater 
magnetic moments (usually thousands of Bohr magnetons) where the highest magnetization MS
value reachable can be described by:
M/MS
 = coth(μH/kBT) – kBT/μH = L(μH/kBT) (8)
where L is the Langevin function. If the Langevin law is valid, the M/MS
 versus H/T curves of 
a sample at different temperatures must superimpose in a single universal Langevin scaling. A 
good approximation scaling can be obtained using low fields and temperatures above TB, where 
results compatible with the superparamagnetic behavior are expected (Fonseca et al. 2002). For 
instance, Fonseca et al. reported that the scaling is valid only when the system is comprised of 
non-interacting particles and spherical in shape (see Figure 7). However, the experimental evidence 
(Goya et al. 2003b, Vejpravová et al. 2005) shows that in real non-interacting systems with narrow 
size distribution, the suggested scaling law does not give appropriate results.

3.1.2 Non interacting, polydisperse magnetic particles
As stated in the last section, real nanoparticles’ systems are constituted by a collection of variable 
particle sizes. Consequently, the magnetization of superparamagnetic particles can be best estimated 
as a weighted sum of Langevin functions (Ferrari et al. 1997):
M = ∫
0
∞
L( μH
kBT ) MS dx (9)
where MS
 is nearly temperature independent and is given by:
MS
 = ∫
0
∞ 1
√
—2π μσ
exp[– ln2 (μ/H0
)
2σ2 ] dμ (10)
where the log-normal distribution width is symbolized by σ and the median of the distribution values 
is denoted by μ0
 which is associated to the average magnetic moment < μm > by < μm > = μ0 e–σ2/2. 
Figure 7 shows the best fit curves obtained for normal Langevin function (Equation 8) and the sum 
of Langevin functions (Equation 10) for nanocristalline Ni particles; as can be seen, even if both fits 
seem to obtain similar results, the greatest dissimilarity comes from the resulting fitted parameters, 
as the magnetic moment values μ0 and μm. Comparing these results, the (sum of functions) log￾normal Langevin function obtained parameters show excellent accordance with the transmission 
microscopy observations, confirming the best performance of the weighted sum of Langevin 
functions for explaining real superparamagnetic systems.
3.1.3 Interacting magnetic particles
According to Kechrakos and Trohidou (Kechrakos and Trohidou 2000), dipolar interactions help to 
reduce the system’s magnetic performance, advising that magnetization approaches saturation and 
remanence slower than the analogous non-interacting superparamagnetic systems (phenomena also 
observed when surface effects are not neglected). To comprehend the influence of dipolar interactions 
in diverse nanoparticles systems, Allia et al. (Allia et al. 2001) formulated a phenomenological 
Interacting Superparamagnetic Model (ISP) that considers interacting (through dipolar long-range 
fields) nanoparticles’ magnetic moments, μ. The total influence of these interacting particles is
modeled by using a fictional temperature T*, so-called apparent temperature, which is added to the 
real temperature in the weighted sum of Langevin function’s denominator (Moscoso-Londoño et al. 
2017):
M(H,T) = nCO ∫
0
∞
 μCO L( μCO(H–HC)
kB(T + T*
) ) f(μCO)d μCO (15)
where the subscript ´CO´ denotes corrected fit values, nCO is the corrected number of magnetic 
moments of paramagnetic particles per mass unit, and the T* is linked to the dipolar interaction 
energy εD through εD = kBT*, which can be calculated by using low field susceptibility measurements. 
The later description was formulated by Moscoso-Lodoño et al. (Moscoso-Londoño et al. 
2017), who used iron oxide nanoparticles at different concentrations and T* calculated values that 
fitted their M Vs H curves. As a consequence, they determined the apparent 〈μAP〉 and corrected 
magnetic moments 〈μCO〉 with values higher than the apparent ones, as predicted by the Kechrakos 
and Trohidou (Kechrakos and Trohidou 2000) simulations, see Figure 8. All 〈μAP〉 moments were Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 153
of the same order of magnitude for the analyzed samples when using the classical Langevin 
methodology, while in concentrated systems 〈μCO〉, moments increase from low temperatures until 
they subsequently reach a decreasing tendency. Near those temperatures, the reached maximum 
can be described as a constraint on the ISP model, particularly when a substantial proportion of 
nanoparticles are still blocked. 
The Moscoso-Lodoño group unraveled how the ISP model can characterize clusters of different 
nanoparticles as if they were single and larger magnetic entities per unit volume, a phenomenon 
that could emerge from interactions amidst and between the clustered nanoparticles. This approach 
completely agreed with the other characterization techniques used by this group. 
A very good work published by Mendoza Zélis et al. (Mendoza Zélis et al. 2017) and Sanchez 
et al. (Sánchez et al. 2017) also used the aforementioned methods but applied them to different 
arrays and nanostructured shapes. While these articles are beyond the scope of this chapter, they are 
strongly recommended for readers working with no-spherical shapes.

3.2 Coercive field non interacting magnetic particles 
3.2.1 Non interacting, monodisperse magnetic particles
For ideal superparamagnetic nanoparticles systems, a null coercive field is expected above TB, as 
detailed in the beginning of Section 2. However, at low temperatures, the coercivity belonging to a 
non-interacting and randomly oriented particles system with random distribution of anisotropies is 
estimated to satisfy the next equation (Bean and Livingston 1959, Linderoth et al. 1993, Torres et 
al. 2015):
HC(T) = HC0 [1– ( T
—
TB
)
1/2] (11)
When supposing T = 0 in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, the HCO must take the value 
HCO = 0.48(2K/MS
) and the HC(T) can be written as (Stoner and Wohlafarth 1948):
HC(T) = 0.48 2K
—
MS
[1– ( T
—
TB
)
1/2] (12)
All the above coercivity expressions contemplate a coherently reversal process of magnetization. 
However, it does not consider the size distribution because the total HC of a system does not 
correspond to a simple superposition of individual particle’s coercivities.
As can be appreciated in equations 11 and 12, HC follows an almost linear dependence with 
T1/2 at low temperatures. Therefore, extrapolating the linear fit interval to T = 0, the values HCO and 
hence the anisotropy term K can be obtained, respectively. Likewise, the extrapolation of HC(T) = 0 
provides the values of TB, which must be consistent with the values obtained by the MZFC and MFC
measurements (see Section 1), i.e., see Figure 9, where the HC Vs T1/2 linear fit region is plotted for 
Figure 9. Temperature dependence of the coercivity Hc

Conversely, fitting the linear region by assuming the anisotropy constant as temperature 
independent (Torres et al. 2015), the values of K can be obtained by extrapolating T = 0. Nevertheless, 
it is worth noting that the obtained K values must be used cautiously (Moscoso-Londoño et al. 2017) 
as Equation 12 is founded on the classic superparamagnetic models and does not take into account 
important parameters present in real samples’ systems, such as the temperature dependence of the 
magnetic parameters involved (Bean and Livingston 1959), surface effects, particle size dispersion, 
dipolar interactions effects, or structural disorder effects related to the Verwey transition that may 
impact the anisotropy determination of the analyzed systems (Yosida and Tachiki 1957).
3.2.2 Non interacting, polydisperse magnetic particles
The HC(T) behavior that considers particle size distribution was described by Nunes et al. (Nunes 
et al. 2004) using a phenomenological approach that takes into account the unblocked particles’
contributions. Thus, the blocked particles’ coercive field is obtained as follows (Knobel et al. 2008, 
Yosida and Tachiki 1957):
HCB = α —2K
MS
[1– ( —T
〈TB〉
T
)
1/2] (13)
where α takes the 0.48 or 1 values, if the particles are randomly oriented or if their easy axes are 
almost all oriented, respectively (see Section 2.2.1). As this equation just regards the volume fraction 
of blocked particles at temperature T, the 〈TB〉
T
 represents their average blocking temperature.
Therefore, the total description of the particle size distribution can be ascribed to blocked 
(HCB, Equation 13) and superparamagnetic particles. In this regard, Keller and Luborsky (Kneller 
and Luborsky 1963) considered the influence of the superparamagnetic and blocked particle 
contributions when analyzing the magnetization curves as linear for H < HCB. Hence, by averaging 
both contributions, the total coercive field can be calculated:
〈HC〉
T
 = Mr (T)
χS (T) + [(Mr (T)/HCB] (14)
where Mr
(T) isthe temperature-dependent remanence and χS
(T) the superparamagnetic susceptibility 
in a determined temperature T. The parameters aforementioned in Equation 14 can be acquired by 
experimental characterization, i.e., the blocking temperature distribution f(TB) can be obtained from 
the MFC – MZFC curves as presented in Section 1. To test this proposition, Nunes et al. used a Cu90Co10
granular alloy sample that did not follow the HC linear dependence with T1/2. As can be seen in 
Figure 10, without taking into account the unblocked particles’ superparamagnetic susceptibility, 
they obtained the curves indicated by the dashed and dotted lines by using Equation 13, working 
well for isolated and narrow distributions (Bean and Livingston 1959). The average blocking 
temperature reliant on temperature is described by the dashed line, which notably demonstrates the 
lack of the superparamagnetic correction term. In contrast, the dashed-dotted line was acquired by 
using Equation 14 and the average blocking temperature for all particles, which resulted in a superb 
agreement with the experimental data at low temperatures in which the majority of particles remain 
blocked. Lastly, by using Equation 14 and the average blocking temperature 〈TB〉
T
 and considering 
the volume fraction of blocked particles at a determined temperature, they obtained the solid line, 
which perfectly describes the experimental data in the whole temperature range.156 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
3.2.3 Interacting magnetic nanoparticles
As isolated nanoparticles tend to aggregate due to steric and surface effects, then dipolar interactions 
are expected to impact the HC values. For this reason, these interactions must be taken into account 
and need to be widely studied when describing more realistic nanoparticle magnetic systems. 
For example, Neél (Néel 1955) suggested that HC diminishes (in order to lower the anisotropy 
energy) with the increase in the “interaction field” or packing fraction ∈ following the relation 
HC = HC∞ (1 – ∈). In a later paper, Wohfarth (Wohlfarth 1955) demonstrated the existence of a particle 
orientation dependency on dipolar interactions due to the fact that these interactions are direction￾dependent. Consequently, this results in a decrease or increase of HC depending on the orientation of 
the particles. Later, more recent works (El-Hilo 2010, El-Hilo and Bsoul 2007, Holmes et al. 2007, 
Sharif et al. 2007) described an evident dependency on HC in terms of an increase or decrease in the 
anisotropy energy due to interaction-induced effects.
As the increase or decrease depends strongly on the studied system, Das et al. (Das et al. 2010) 
realized that applying interaction induced changes in K could not describe by itself their Nickel 
nanoparticles’ systems but rather can be described by the effect of fluctuating dipolar magnetic fields 
due to fluctuations in the magnetization of nearest neighbor particles. As a result, they qualitatively 
described the dynamics of magnetization in the presence of dipolar interactions as a collective effect 
(Suzuki et al. 2009). These collective dynamics of particle magnetizations that are the result of 
dipolar interactions, added as an energy term ± Edip to the anisotropy energy, were responsible for 
the increase in HC in their Nickel nanoparticles’ studied systems, see Figure 11. 
A recent theoretical work solved by the Monte Carlo Method from Agudelo-Giraldo et al. 
(Agudelo-Giraldo et al. 2020) also describes how the coercive field and remanence can alter the 
magnetization processes of a series of nanogranular films. Their simulations also suggest changes

in HC and in the anisotropy because of the competition among local and boundary anisotropies, 
showing how anisotropic local environment and collective phenomena are significant to explain 
nanomaterials with distorted grain boundaries.
4. Dynamic properties, AC measurements
So far, this chapter has described some of the most suitable techniques to characterize nanomagnetic 
materials using static measurements. Nonetheless, another useful experimental technique is the 
AC (Alternating Current) susceptibility measurements, where the excitation field is applied at 
different frequencies (f) to follow the processes of particle relaxation (see Equation 2). Different 
applied frequencies imply a variation in the number of particles that can go behind the oscillations, 
modifying, as a consequence, the magnetic response since the sample magnetization might be 
delayed from the alternating field. The AC method yields to a susceptibility χ = χ' + χ'' built of two 
main components: (1) χ' the real part and (2) χ'' the imaginary or dynamic part, which is related with 
dynamic processes that produce spin reversal lags in presence of an alternating external field.
4.1 Relaxation time
Considering small nanoparticles with low anisotropy energy Ea
, the nanoparticle magnetic moment 
can pass the anisotropy energy barrier Ea
 from one orientation to the other due to thermal agitation, 
where the characteristic time between the two possible orientations is the so-called Neél relaxation 
time, τN. Writing Equation 2 in a different manner, the Neél relaxation time can be defined as:
τN = τ0
 exp ( Ea
kBT) (15)
Figure 11. The coercive field Hc
 at T = 10 K is plotted as a function of the particle diameter d. The peak for each curve 
separates the single domain (SD) from the multi domain (MD) particles. Particles with diameter higher (smaller) than the 
peak diameter (dc
) are MD (SD). The critical diameters dc1, dc2 and dc3 for each sample are identified with arrows. In the 
SD region (i.e., d < dc
), the coercivity increases with increasing dipolar interactions as shown by the vertical dashed arrow. 
Reprinted with permission from Das et al. 2010.158 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Where τ0 is the characteristic time, which must take values between 10–9 and 10–11 s according to the 
superparagmentic theory (Goya et al. 2003a) and Ea
 = KV is characterized in the simplest case by 
only one anisotropy axis, as described in the beginning of this chapter.
On the other hand, for unfrozen fluidic solutions in which the nanoparticles are allowed to rotate 
and, thus, change their orientation and anisotropy axis trying to align with the external magnetic 
field in order to reduce the magnetic energies, it is necessary to use a different expression to define 
their relaxation processes. In this regard, the “Brown relaxation” will be the best option because 
its characteristic time, τB, is defined by the liquid viscosity of the matrix in which the sample is 
contained, η, and the hydrodynamic nanoparticle volume VH considering the magnetic core and 
coating (Zhakhovskii and Anisimov 1997):
τB = 
3ηVH
kBT (16)
Depending on the system, both relaxation mechanisms can be present above certain temperature 
(usually in ferrofluids with broad distribution of particle size and mean radii ~ 10 nm) and the 
resultant characteristic time τ can be obtained by adding both contributions (Rosensweig 2002):
1
–
τ
 = —1
τN
 + —1
τB
(17) 
Normally, the absorption of the particle system will follow the quickest relaxation 
processes. Owing to the dissimilar size relations for the two relaxation regimes that are given by 
Equations 15 and 16, there are different spectral regions in which the two relaxation mechanisms 
may occur. For example, the Néel relaxation predominates in small particle sizes and measurements 
with high frequencies and the opposite works for the Brown relaxation, see Figure 12. For this 
reason, the Brown relaxation is not well applied for hyperthermia experiments (Hergt et al. 2010). 
Figure 12. Time constants Vs particle size for magnetic particles. Reprinted with permission from Rosensweig 2002.Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 159
As stated in last paragraph, the Neél process is the dominant relaxation detected in small 
nanoparticles’ arrangements (r < 9 nm) when τN < τB (Rosensweig 2002). Considering that the 
measurement typical time for a vibrating sample magnetometer τm is around 0.1 – 100s, then 
τm >> τB and the nanoparticles are allowed to freely rotate in the course of the measurement, while 
for low temperatures’ measurements, i.e., frozen water, merely the Neél relaxation is expected as 
the nanoparticle magnetic moment is in a minimum energy blocked state when τm < τN (Henrard 
et al. 2019).
The literature usually reports two main methodologies to acquire the relaxation time of a 
nanoparticle system: the Neél-Arrhenius and the Vogel-Fulcher laws, both of which will be described 
in the next sections.
4.2 Neél-Arrhenius law
The expected behavior for superparamagnetic systems assumes a modification (shift) of the 
maximum in temperature (Tmax) with increasing frequency for both components χ' (real) and χ'' 
(imaginary) susceptibilities (Dormann et al. 1999), see Figure 13. Nevertheless, this tendency is 
not always indicative of superparamagnetic behavior. For that reason, a convenient method for 
classifying the freezing/blocking processes obtained by the dynamic measurements determines the 
Figure 13. Temperature dependence of the in-phase (real) component χ’(T) of the magnetic susceptibility for a Ni27Co39Fe33
layered double hydroxide sample, at different excitation frequencies. Arrows indicate increasing frequencies. Inset: Out of

data from the chapter author].160 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Mydosh parameter Φ (Mydosh 1993), which is an empirical parameter that denotes the relative shift
of the temperature per frequency decade:
Φ = ΔTmax
Tmax Δlog10( f ) (18)
Where ΔTmax is the difference among the Tmax values measured in the Δlog10( f ) frequency range. For 
weakly or non-interacting superparamagnetic systems, the expected value for the Mydosh parameter 
Φ must be (Φ ~ 0.1–0.13) (Masunaga et al. 2009, Vázquez-Vázquez et al. 2011, Zhakhovskii and 
Anisimov 1997); the values below this interval are characteristic of nanoparticle systems with 
intermediate interactions (Nadeem et al. 2011) and the values below the interval are related to 
strong interparticle interacting systems (Moscoso-Londoño et al
like surface behavior (Φ ~ 5 × 10–3 – 5 × 10–2) (Goya 2002). Consequently, if the analyzed systems 
show the above mentioned shift in the Tmax with increasing frequency and a Mydosh parameter value 
between 0.1–0.13, a thermally activated Néel–Arrhenius fit for superparamagnetic particles must 
. 2017) or result from spin-glass 
simulate the experimental data.
The Néel–Arrhenius fit model is described by Equations 2 and 15, in which the energy barrier, 
Ea
 = keffV sin2 θ is proportional to the particle volume V at null external magnetic field, keff is the 
effective magnetic anisotropy constant and θ is the angle amid the easy magnetization axis and the
particle magnetic moment. Then, when plotting ln(τ) Vs 1/TB
 a linear plot is expected. Figure 14 
shows the Arrhenius plot obtained for the imaginary component χ'' from the work of Goya et al. 
(Goya et al. 2003a) in which they used spherical 5 nm magnetite nanoparticles. In this work, they 
calculated the keff = 35.6 × 105 erg/cm3
 and τ0
 = 9 × 10–13s values by applying equation 15 and the radii 
obtained from electronic microscopy data. The resultant effective anisotropy is an order magnitude 
higher than the first order magnetocrystalline anisotropy from the bulk material. This augmentation

 value is 
slightly smaller than the expected values between 10–9 and 10–11 s, according to the superparagmentic theory. Reprinted with 
permission from Goya et al. 2003a.Magnetic Characterization of Nanoparticles 161
is usually expected because of smaller particle size, surface effects (Luis et al. 2002), extra intrinsic 
contributions from the particle anisotropy (shape, magnetostrictive or magnetocrystalline), and 
interparticle dipolar or exchange interactions, which have direct repercussions on the energy barrier 
(Goya et al. 2003a). Therefore, the authors point out to be cautious with the values obtained from the 
Néel–Arrhenius law fitting since they can also lead to obtaining values without physical meaning 
(Vázquez-Vázquez et al. 2011).
In contrast, when the obtained keff value is slightly bigger than the bulk one, it is convenient 
to link this value with the estimated coercive field for spherical particles with magnetocrystalline 
anisotropy by using the relation HC = 2Keff /MS
 (valid for uniaxial anisotropy particles with no 
interactions, see Section 2.2.1), whose values must agree with the obtained values from the hysteresis 
curves at low temperatures.
4.2.1 Neél-Arrhenius modified law-dipolar interactions
For some applications, it is decisive to identify how the superparamagnetic relaxation rate is 
modified by the magnetic dipolar interactions. Unfortunately, the experiments performed and the 
theoretical work in the literature provide dissimilar, and inclusively opposing, results because of 
the many possible origins of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy that predict when the inversion of 
magnetic moments becomes faster (Hansen 1998, Morup et al. 1995, Mørup and Tronc 1994) or 
slower (Andersson et al. 1997, El-Hilo et al. 1992) as the dipolar interactions are switched on (Luis 
et al. 2002). To attest the latter point, Luis et al. followed the theoretical piece of Dormann et al. 
(Dormann et al. 1988) and made the assumption that, when the magnetic moment of a specified 
cluster flips, the energy of a neighbor spin changes by an extent equivalent to their common dipolar 
interaction energy. Hence, before the analyzed spin flips again, the nearest neighbor’s magnetization 
is polarized via a new local dipolar field. Thus, the relaxation time can be expressed as the one used 
for independent clusters with an extra interaction energy Edip term added in Equation 15:
τ±
 = τ0 exp ( Ea
 ± Edip
kBT ) (19)
where the +/– signs are related with the spin reversal direction to the local field (interacting field) 
produced by the neighbors. An opposed direction is denoted by (+) while in the same direction is 
denoted by (–), leading to different relaxation times depending on the local field alignment. 
This approach has been used in some works (Goya et al. 2003b, Goya 2002) and has given 
reasonable good fitting parameters. Nevertheless, Vogel-Fulcher is the most commonly reported law 
for interacting nanoparticle systems, as described below.
4.3 Vogel-Fulcher law
As stated in the previous sections, the Arrhenius law can lead to fitting values without physical 
meaning (Vázquez-Vázquez et al. 2011), even when using the dipolar term interaction because of the 
many possible origins of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This is specially so at low temperatures 
when, depending of the analyzed system, some magnetic clusters interact (via dipole, exchange or 
other forces) so as to have cooperative effects, as evidenced by static magnetic measurements for 
some interacting systems (see Sections 1 and 2). In this context, the more recommended law to use 
is the Vogel-Fulcher.
The Vogel-Fulcher law was formulated for interacting nanoparticle systems (likewise Dorman 
et al. (Dormann et al. 1988, 1999)) assuming that the anisotropy energies were stronger than the 
interactions between particles (Shtrikman and Wohlfarth 1981). In that sense, the Vogel-Fulcher law 162 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
introduces a fictitious temperature T0
VF term that is proportional to the dipolar interaction’s strength 
between particles:
τ = τ0
 exp [ Keff V
kB (Tmax–T0
)] (20)
where τ0 is the relaxation time obtained from the Vogel-Fulcher (V-F) law, Tmax is the temperature 
indicative of the beginning of the blocking process (i.e., the temperature of the maxima in the peak 
position in AC susceptibility), as long as Tmax >> τ0
VF, and τ is the measuring window. Assuming the 
pre-exponential factor τ0
 = 10–9s and using the V-F expression, the Vazquez-Vazquez (Vázquez￾Vázquez et al. 2011) group obtained fitting T0
 values that indicate strong particle interactions, as T0
symbolizes the temperature from which the relaxation time diverges.
Also, Moscoso-Lodoño et al. (Moscoso-Londoño et al. 2017) used the V-F law and obtained 
values around the expected for superparamagnetic nanoparticles’ systems (τ0
 around 10–9s and 
Keff in good agreement with the values extracted from their coercivity analysis) using iron oxide 
nanoparticles at different concentrations, see Figure 15. 
It must be noticed that, in Equation 20, the term T – T0
 may resemble the T* fictitious temperature 
used in the ISP model seen in Section 2.1.3 for magnetic interacting systems; nevertheless, the 
ISP denominator includes an added T* term giving different interpretative meaning. In the V-F 
expression, the temperature T0
 symbolizes that some critical quantity is diverging there (i.e., viscosity 
or relaxation time). A mixture of both models can be found in the work from Allia and Tiberto (Allia 
et al. 2011, Allia and Tiberto 2011) in which by modifying the Arrhenius law by adding an extra

term (T + T*) they explained how anisotropy can drive to colective magnetic interactions that are no 
negligible. Therefore, the reader must choose very carefully the model that adjusts the best with the 
hypothesis that best describes its nanoparticle magnetic system.
5. Conclusions
This chapter provides a general overview of the basic techniques used to characterize magnetic 
nanomaterials by using Vibrating Sample Magnetometers (VSM) and Superconducting Quantum 
Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometers. These techniques must converge on describing the 
same phenomena by using the different approaches described in Sections 1, 2 and 3. The non￾interacting monodisperse systems are the most simple nanoparticle systems. These systems use 
simple equations and assumptions to differentiate the superparamagnetic and thermally stable 
regimes. Nevertheless, the analysis and description complicates when interactions, surface effects, 
the many possible origins of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and even viscosity cannot be 
neglected. As the experimental evidence suggests, cooperative dipolar interactions can vary the 
blocking barrier heights, the blocking temperature distribution and likewise the heating efficiency 
during AC magnetic measurements that may have cooperative effects at low temperatures. Therefore, 
the reader must choose very carefully the model that adjusts the best to the hypothesis that best 
describes its nanoparticle magnetic system.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Dimensionality of nanostructures 
Research in nanotechnology has become increasingly popular since it impacts several scientific, 
technological, and social matters. The nanometric scale, usually considered between 1–100 nm, 
gives nanomaterials unique properties that are reflected in peculiar and attractive results compared 
to the bulk materials (Saleh 2020). These nanostructured materials (NMs) can be classified into 
different categories according to personal interests. For this chapter, NMs will be classified first in 
terms of their dimensionality and then regarding their properties and function.
In 1995, nanostructured materials were categorized for the first time based on their crystalline 
shape and chemical composition (Gleiter 1995). This classification, however, was not complete 
since the relationship between the dimensionality of the nanosized building blocks and the material 
as a whole was not fully considered. The emergence and exponential creation of a great number of 
nanomaterials motivated Skorokhod to initially extend Gletier classification and later restructure it, 
along with Pokropivny. Thus, in 2007, they reported a modified classification in which they coined 
the terms zero-, one-, two, and three-dimensional nanostructures, which are widely employed today 
(Pokropivny and Skorokhod 2007).
Zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructured materials are characterized by having all their dimensions 
below 100 nm. Nanoparticles are the best example of this class and can have different chemical 
nature like metallic (Au, Pt, Ag), semiconductor (quantum dots, metal oxides) and magnetic (ferrites, 
maghemite). Also, the preparation of particles with shapes such as spheres, cubes, and hollow spheres 
can be found in literature. Meanwhile, the 1D group is formed by wires, tubes, filaments, and fibers, 
with one of their dimensions not in the nanoscale. In contrast, bidimensional (2D) materials contain 
only one of their dimensions in the nanometric scale. Some examples of this group are graphene, 
nanodiscs, nanoprisms, nanoplates, and thin films. Finally, all the dimensions of 3D nanomaterials 
exceed 100 nm. Nevertheless, they have structural features that are in the nanometric scale 
(Liu et al. 2011, Singh et al. 2020, Saleh 2020). Nanostructured microspheres, polycrystals, 168 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
honeycombs, nanocomposites and nanopillar arrays are some examples of this group. Some 
authors, however, include in this category materials with dimension(s) smaller than 100 nm, but 
with a notable 3D structure like dendritic particles, and nanobuds (Tiwari et al. 2012). This chapter 
describes the incorporation of these four NM groups in biosensing and lab-on-a-chip systems.
1.2 Biosensors
Chemical sensors are analytical devices whose response depends on a chemical stimulus (affinity 
interaction or reaction) by an analyte in a specific manner to detect it qualitatively or quantitatively 
(Eggins 2007, Ensafi 2019). Biosensors are chemical sensors with a biological element, or a derivative 
from one, as the sensing element. The concept emerged in 1962, with the glucose biosensor (Clark 
Jr. and Lyons 1962, Newman and Setford 2006) and was later formalized by the International Union 
of Pure and Applied Chemistry (Nagel et al. 1992). Biosensors combine a biorecognition element 
with a transduction method to transform the chemical signal of interest to a measurable, typically 
electrical, signal (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. General schematic of nanobiosensors, with examples of the two main bioreceptor classes (nucleic acids and 
proteins) and the two most reported nanostructures (Au nanoparticles and C nanotubes), all in the same scale. Insets show the 
molecular structures of double-stranded DNA and part of the primary structure of glucose oxidase. The molecule in green is 
the enzyme cofactor at the active site.Nanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 169
The coupling gives biosensors the capability to selectively detect analytes of biological origin 
(proteins, cells, DNA, etc.) and non-biological origin (drugs, toxins, ions, etc.) in simple or complex 
matrices (Kirsch et al. 2013). Biosensors can be classified by the biorecognition mechanism used, 
the presence or absence of labels, and the signal transduction type. Biorecognition can be affinity￾based, where the binding of biomolecules like nucleic acids and proteins produces the response. 
Alternatively, catalytic biosensors use the rate of a reaction, typically by an enzyme, as the 
analytical response. The biorecognition event then must be transduced to be detected, for example, 
optically, magnetically, electrically or electrochemically as detailed in the following sections. The 
changes monitored in the transductor can arise directly from physicochemical changes in either 
the biorecognition element or the molecule to be detected. Sometimes, however, neither of these 
molecules is suitable for a given transduction mechanism and an appropriate marker or reporter, 
known as a “label”, is added to one of the components. While label-free methods are desirable for 
simplicity, label-based ones are more generally applicable. At the end, independent of the used 
strategy, the signal recorded by the device must be related with the analyte concentration in a 
predictable manner.
1.2.1 Optical transduction
These transductors use changes in the intensity of light at a given wavelength, which arise from the 
biorecognition event. The most used optical phenomena are absorption, scattering, fluorescence, 
phosphorescence, polarization, rotation, interference, reflection, and refraction (Farré and Barceló 
2020). 
Substances that absorb light are known as chromophores and are usually employed either as 
visual indicators or monitoring their transmittance with a spectrophotometer. Some biomolecules 
absorb UV or visible light (Figure 2a), making spectrophotometry a standard tool, for example, 
to determine DNA purity. After absorption, some molecules reemit light at a longer wavelength 
through fluorescence (Figure 2b). Sensing can be performed by labeling a molecule of interest with 
a fluorophore, whose intensity will reflect the changes in analyte concentration. Alternatively, a 
donor fluorophore can transfer energy to an acceptor one via fluorescence (or Förster) resonance 
energy transfer (FRET) when their separation is smaller than approximately 10 nm. This is a non￾radiative dipole-dipole interaction that results in the quenching of the donor and an increase in the 
acceptor fluorescence (Gauglitz 2005, Bhatt and Bhattacharya 2019). The emission dependence 
on the donor-acceptor proximity makes it applicable to study intra- or intermolecular interactions, 
for example, between proteins and cells (Margineanu et al. 2016). Fluorescence has been heavily 
employed in biosensing, partly due to its high sensitivity (Zhong 2009).

scattering.170 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
When photons emitted by a laser impinge on a molecule with energy away from any electronic 
state transition, the molecule will assume a virtual state (Figure 2d). Upon returning to the ground 
state, it can do so to a vibrational state different from the original one through inelastic scattering. 
The changes in the vibrational state will cause either a loss (Stokes, Figure 2e) or an increase (anti￾Stokes, Figure 2g) in the energy of the inelastically scattered photons. This process is the basis 
of Raman spectroscopy and is dependent on changes in polarizability of the molecule, therefore 
providing structural information.
1.2.2 Electrochemical and electrical transduction 
An electrochemical biosensor measures the concentration of an electroactive species from variations 
on the current or potential, for amperometric or potentiometric methods, respectively. The obtained 
responses are detected on an electronic conductor (frequently referred to as the electrode), which 
acts as the transducer. In amperometry, the electron transfer processes (redox reactions) result from 
Figure 3. (a) The three different generations of enzymatic electrochemical biosensors. (b) Principle of BioFET biosensing.

effect transistor based bio-sensing” Nanoscale, Matsumoto et al. 5, 10702–10718. Copyright (2013); permission conveyed

the application of a potential. Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors are the most commercialized 
example to date. These can be classified in the so-called “generations” according to their electron 
transfer mechanism (Figure 3a). In the first generation, a reaction subproduct is detected at the 
electrode, while in the second generation a mediator is added to replace it. In third generation 
enzymatic biosensors, electrons flow directly from the enzyme cofactor to the electronic conductor 
or vice versa, depending on whether an oxidation or reduction reaction is employed, respectively. 
This phenomenon is termed direct electron transfer (DET) and, although it is frequently reported 
in the literature, the experimental evidence to detect it is still debated (Milton and Minteer 2017, 
Bartlett and Al-Lolage 2018). Potentiometry measures a potential difference between two electrodes 
when no current flows through them. Its main application is measuring the activity of ions such as 
H+
, K+
, Ca2+, Na+
, and Cl–
, through ion selective electrodes (Ding and Qin 2020).
Field effect transistors (FETs) contain a region fabricated in a semiconductor material termed 
channel, connected to a pair of electrodes termed source (S) and drain (D). A third electrode, known 
as gate (G), is polarized to create an electric field that affects the conductance between S and D 
(Figure 3b). Two variations have been used for sensing. In ion sensitive FETs (ISFETs), an ion￾sensitive material is used instead of a metallic gate, accumulating charge differently as the ion 
concentration changes. In biosensor FETs (Bio-FETs), bioreceptors are immobilized on the gate. 
Interactions with charged molecules create the necessary field changes to obtain a FET response 
(Pachauri and Ingebrandt 2016, Vu and Chen 2019). FETs are only sensitive to ionic changes within 
the Debye length, beyond which charges are screened. Because of the high ionic strength of the 
biological media, its Debye length is in the order of only 1 nm (Schasfoort et al. 1990). Thus, 
measuring changes in the charge distribution of large molecules (e.g., proteins) immobilized on the 
surface represents a challenge. 
1.3 Lab-on-a-chip 
To describe the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) concept, imagine a chemical or biomedical laboratory. All that 
large equipment with specific functions, located in a space of several square meters, can be replicated 
in devices, usually called “chips”, that measure only a few square centimeters. The miniaturization 
of the laboratory functions on LOC devices reduces process time, reagent cost, and sample volume 
while increasing portability. LOCs evolved from the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) 
from which they took their micro and nanofabrication techniques. The idea that these devices could 
be applicable to analytical chemistry was reflected in the coinage of the term “micro total analysis 
system”, or µTAS (Manz et al. 1990). In medical science, the idea is less recent, as it represents 
a miniaturization of conventional in vitro diagnostic devices (Schönberger and Hoffstetter 2016). 
The LOC structure can be simple or complex according to the needs of a particular application, 
making their development a multidisciplinary field, with contributions from biology, chemistry, 
engineering, microfabrication, physics, materials science, microfluidics, etc. Equally, their possible 
applications are many, their role in two biomedicine fields attracting the most attention. Portable 
point-of-care (POC) diagnostic devices (Figure 4b) must be considerably simpler to operate than 
common analytical equipment (e.g., without much sample pretreatment) by non-skilled users. Other 
desirable qualities are fast analysis time, low cost, and long shelf life (Jung et al. 2015, Primiceri 
et al. 2018, Mejía-Salazar et al. 2020). Biomimetic organ-on-a-chip (OOC) cell cultures, in contrast, 
are attractive implementations of LOC platforms for drug research and personalized medicine 
(Figure 4d). These devices are intended for a lab environment and use by highly trained personnel. 
As such, they do not require portability and, instead, need high stability during long operation 
periods (Wu et al. 2020, Azizipour et al. 2020). 
Frequently, LOCs have networks of microchannels through which the liquid samples and 
other reagents flow. These devices usually make use of the behavior fluids present at these scales, 
including laminar flow (Tarn and Pamme 2014, Zhang and Hoshino 2019). Microfluidic LOC 172 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
platforms are usually fabricated using photolithography, soft-lithography or micromilling, although 
paper-based devices prepared by inkjet or screen printing are growing in popularity. The interest in 
nanoscale phenomena and improvements in nanofabrication techniques like e-beam lithography and 
nanoimprint lithography have prompted the emergence of nanofluidic LOCs. At this scale, van der 
Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, electrokinetic effects, and nucleation phenomena dominate 
the behavior of the flow (Eijkel and Berg 2005, Eijkel et al. 2009, Daiguji 2011).
Optical (Pires et al. 2014), electrochemical (Rackus et al. 2015), and magnetic sensing 
(Jamshaid et al. 2016) have been incorporated into LOCs. Also, many of the used biosensing 
strategies employ nanomaterials. Besides the obvious increase in area/volume compared to the bulk 
materials, nanobiosensors enable unique strategies taking advantage of the fact that the biomolecules 
themselves are nanostructures (Figure 1). Next, we describe nanomaterials used for biosensing, 
emphasizing the technologies that have been incorporated in LOCs.

2. 0D Materials
Nanoparticles have been widely used in biosensing, with examples for optical (Kang et al. 2008, 
Jiang et al. 2013, Ghasemi et al. 2018) and electrochemical (Luo et al. 2006) detection since the 
1990s. Besides the in vitro applications discussed here, they have been used in vivo as agents in 
imaging, theragnostics and drug delivery (Jiang et al. 2013, Khan et al. 2018).
2.1 Metal nanoparticles
Nanoparticles composed of noble metals, notably gold and silver, have been used in both optical 
and electrochemical biosensing platforms (Zeng et al. 2011, Vidotti et al. 2011, Doria et al. 2012, 
Malekzad et al. 2017, Chang et al. 2019). 
Most optical sensors using metallic nanoparticles make use of the plasmon resonance that takes 
place when their conduction electrons oscillate upon being exposed to incident electromagnetic 
radiation. The radiation wavelength (λ) will therefore cause changes in the transmittance (T), 
usually called absorption. This quantity (–log10 T), however, is more precisely termed extinction, as 
it includes not only absorption, but also scattering. The extinction cross section (CE) for a metallic 
nanosphere of radius r, then, is obtained by adding the cross-sections for each phenomenon (CA and 
CS
 for absorption and scattering, respectively)
CE = CA + CS
 = k Im (α) + k4
—6π
 |α|
2 (1)
where k and α are the radiation wave vector and the metal polarizability, respectively. These two 
quantities are defined as
2πn
k = med (2) λ
α = 4πr3 ( εpart – εmed
εpart + 2εmed
) (3)
where nmed is the medium refractive index, εpart the metal dielectric constant, and εmed the medium 
dielectric constant. Note that dielectric constants for metals are complex numbers (Lakowicz 2005). 
From Equations 1–3, it can be observed that the absorption and scattering phenomena depend on the 
nanoparticle size. While absorption is proportional to the cube of the radius, scattering is more readily 
affected by size, varying in proportion to the sixth power of the radius. Therefore, scattering will 
dominate on larger particles and absorption on smaller ones. For 22 nm radius gold nanoparticles, 
for example, most of the extinction is already due to absorption (Messinger et al. 1981). 
The quantum model commonly known as “particle in a box” predicts that the electronic transitions 
redshift for larger “boxes”. Indeed, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of diameters between 2 and 11 nm, 
which are most common in biosensing, present a plasmon absorption at wavelengths between 516 
and 524 nm, appearing red (Amendola and Meneghetti 2009). Their color has made AuNPs suitable 
to label biomolecules, evidencing their presence in a particular location. For example, AuNPs have 
been the most popular label in lateral flow assays like pregnancy tests (Chun 2009, Koczula and 
Gallotta 2016). AuNPs conjugated to a bioreceptor (commonly an antibody or antigen) interact with 
antibodies or antigens in the sample and flow along a porous medium through capillary action. A 
region of the porous medium modified with capture antibodies immobilizes the analyte along with 
the nanoparticle-bioreceptor conjugate, creating a visibly colored region (typically a line) detectable 174 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
by the naked eye (Figure 5). A control line with a capture strategy that does not require an analyte 
is used to confirm that flow has gone through the detection areas (O’Farrell 2009). Alternatively, 
some immunoassays first conjugate the antibodies to small (< 2 nm) AuNPs, later enlarging them to 
200 nm by catalytically depositing silver or gold on their surface. This process produces an easily 
observable colorimetric signal (Lei and Butt 2010). 
When AuNPs aggregate, their dipoles interact with the ones of the surrounding particles. 
Therefore, the side of a particle that is polarized positive will be in proximity with the negatively 
polarized side of another particle. This plasmon coupling reduces the oscillation frequency and 
increases the plasmon absorption wavelength (Rechberger et al. 2003). Small gold nanoparticles 
with usual absorption around 520 nm present a very pronounced redshift to around 620–650 nm, 
which can be discerned visually. Upon aggregation, initially red suspensions containing such 
AuNPs become blue/purple. This effect is heavily used to produce a variety of colorimetric assays 
that change the aggregation state of the nanoparticles when exposed to the analyte. Proteins, nucleic 
acids, small molecules, whole cells, and even metallic ions have been detected this way (Verma 
et al. 2015, Poornima et al. 2016, Sabela et al. 2017, Jazayeri et al. 2018, Ghasemi et al. 2018, 
Gaviña et al. 2018). Silver nanoparticles also change color upon aggregation (yellow to red) but 
have been less popular, partly because of the poorer stability compared to their gold counterparts 
(Sabela et al. 2017).
The physicochemical principles behind the aggregation vary widely. A popular approach 
consists of the formation of cross-linked networks of nanoparticles, very frequently by nucleic acids 
covalently bound using thiol chemistry (Li et al. 2010). Electrostatic adsorption can also be used 
to immobilize oligonucleotides, without requiring the target analyte to be thiolated to interact with 
the nanoparticles. Positively charged capping agents, like polyethyleneimine, can electrostatically 
interact with anionic DNA and RNA, immobilizing them on the nanoparticle surface (Hakimian 
et al. 2018). 
Commonly, the aggregate size and the inter-particle separation are not controlled (Figure 6a). 
On the other hand, Guo et al. designed a system in which AuNPs are asymmetrically modified

oseNanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 175
with oligonucleotides, which are partly complementary between them and partly complementary 
to a DNA analyte. As a result, upon interaction with the analyte, the three strands form a Y-shaped 
structure, holding together a dimer of gold nanoparticles (Figure 6b). Because the aggregate is small, 
the system presents higher stability than larger aggregates which tend to precipitate. Furthermore, the 
design ensures a very small distance between the two particles (< 1 nm), enhancing the wavelength 
shift and therefore improving sensitivity (Guo et al. 2013).
Nanoparticles modified with oligonucleotides can detect more than just nucleic acids. An 
ingenious example derived from this system by the Mirkin group quantifies copper ions, taking 
advantage of the “click chemistry” reaction catalyzed by this ion. They employed azide- and 
alkyne- terminated oligonucleotides immobilized in AuNPs using the shift in the DNA melting 
temperature to quantify the copper ions (Xu et al. 2010). The use of melting temperature adds a 
further degree of selectivity of these DNA sensors. Another example of this approach is the single 
mismatch resolution on a DNA sensor by using a high-fidelity ligase. Both target and mismatch 
DNA cause AuNP aggregation, but the mismatched strand prevents ligation, resulting in a lower 
melting temperature (Li et al. 2005).
Metal nanoparticles do not necessarily need to be modified with the biorecognition element. 
For example, electrostatic immobilization of tyramine on citrate-capped AuNPs has recently been 
reported for colorimetric sensors. The polymerization of the phenolic hydroxyl moieties in the 
tyramine is carried out through the reaction with horseradish peroxidase and H2
O2
, causing cross￾linking of the nanoparticles and their subsequent aggregation. The analyte is first conjugated with 
Figure 6. Comparison of two strategies for DNA sensors based on aggregation of AuNPs. In (a), AuNPs modified with two 
oligonucleotides partially complimentary with the target DNA form large cross-linked aggregates. This results in an increase 
in absorbance at wavelengths longer than 550 nm without showing a defined peak. In (b), assymetric AuNP modification 
ensures that only dimers are formed with a specific interparticle gap, resulting in a well defined transition between two 
conformations. (Adapted with permission from Journal of the American Chemical Society, 135, Guo et al. “Oriented Gold 
Nanoparticle Aggregation for Colorimetric Sensors with Surprisingly High Analytical Figures of Merit”, 12338–12345,

the enzyme catalase, which decomposes the hydrogen peroxide, indirectly preventing the phenol 
polymerization. This system has been used in both direct (Zheng et al. 2019) and competitive 
immunoassays (Liang et al. 2018). 
Non-crosslinking aggregation employs changes on either the nanoparticle surface charge or the 
media ionic strength. Changes in the ionic strength can be caused by adding salts (like MgCl2
) or 
by modifying the solution acidity. Since the nanoparticle stability in solution is determined by their 
inter-particle electrostatic repulsion, high ionic media screens these charges causing aggregation. 
An interesting work uses oligonucleotide-modified AuNPs complementary to the product of a loop￾mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Upon increasing the solution ionic strength, particles 
bound to the amplicon remain stable in solution (red), while aggregation takes place when DNA is 
either absent or non-complementary (Reuter et al. 2020).
Because of their simple signal detection, colorimetric assays are good candidates for use in 
POC devices. Visible color changes can be useful qualitatively. Quantitation, on the other hand, 
requires some sort of (albeit simple) instrumentation. Some approaches have used conventional or 
smartphone cameras to measure the color change (Lei and Butt 2010, Zheng et al. 2019). Others have 
gone further and designed portable colorimeters that can measure the absorption in two wavelengths 
(Zhao et al. 2014, Reuter et al. 2020). In these systems, solutions can be measured using either 
commercial cuvettes, custom-made microplates or microchannels. Furthermore, nanoparticles can 
be deposited on paper to perform either spot or lateral flow analysis, prompting systems that not 
only use the different colors between the dispersed and aggregated nanoparticles, but also their 
different migration characteristics in the flow (Zhao and van den Berg 2008). 
Elastic (Rayleigh) scattering of light by nanoparticles has also been used as an analytical 
signal. This phenomenon can be measured by using a conventional fluorescence spectrofluorometer 
with matching excitation and emission wavelengths. As stated in Equations 1–3, scattering is 
proportional to the sixth power of the particle radius and can be used to monitor processes that 
involve nanoparticle growth. AuNPs were shown to increase their size when exposed to H2
O2
 in a 
solution containing HAuCl4
 and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride. The H2
O2
 reduces the Au3+ only 
at the gold nanoparticle surface. The enzymatic rate of peroxide-producing oxidases can be followed 
by monitoring the scattering intensity, allowing the sensing of the enzyme substrates (Shang et al. 
2008).
Inelastic scattering of light has also been used in nanobiosensor design as surface enhanced 
Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Signal enhancement down to the single-molecule detection is 
caused by a metal structure in close proximity (< 10 nm separation) in two different ways. In the 
electromagnetic mechanism, excitation and emission rates increase with the square of the local 
electric field enhancement (ELoc/E). Neglecting the differences between the excitation and emission 
light frequencies, the enhancement presents a fourth power dependence on ELoc/E (Pilot et al. 2019). 
In the chemical mechanism, enhancement occurs due to changes in the polarizability of the Raman￾active species, including charge transfer with the substrate (Le Ru and Etchegoin 2013, Yaraki 
and Tan 2020). Label-free SERS use the signals from the analyte and can provide useful structural 
information but is prone to overwhelming by similar signals from the background. The use of labels 
enables better quantitation, at the expense of structural information (Li et al. 2020).
Nanomaterial design for SERS focuses on architectures where the electric field is maximized, 
“hot spots” located on the tips of anisotropic nanostructures and in the gaps between them (Le Ru 
and Etchegoin 2013). Nanorods, with two plasmon absorptions and strong field enhancement at their 
ends, have been used as SERS substrates, after various surface modifications (Rekha et al. 2018, 
Yilmaz et al. 2019). However, reliable selective modification of their ends is an active challenge 
(Fontana et al. 2016, Fisher et al. 2017) that would allow for consistent end-to-end assembly and 
reproducible SERS. 
Metal colloids are easily adapted to microfluidic SERS. Silver colloids, for example, have 
been used in a droplet-based platform to detect levofloxacin in urine (Hidi et al. 2016). The analyte Nanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 177
adsorbed on the silver surfaces prompts the aggregation of the nanoparticles creating hot spots 
(Hidi et al. 2015). However, flowing the sample along the colloid increases random adsorption of 
SERS structures in the walls. Alternatives include droplet-based assays (Figure 7) and purposely 
immobilized SERS structures. For example, nanoparticles can be temporarily trapped in a region 
of the channel. Another option is to fabricate or deposit the nanostructures on the channel surface. 
Nanosphere lithography has been used to deposit nanotriangle arrays (Camden et al. 2008), whose 
enhancement factor can be increased coupling nanoparticles to these deposited nanostructures (Li 
et al. 2013). Raman spectrometry is instrumentally more complex than colorimetry or fluorimetry, 
causing a delay in SERS point-of-care biosensors. During the last decade, however, several handheld 
Raman spectrometers have been commercialized, opening the way for more SERS LOCs.
Fluorophores are affected by metallic nanoparticles in a complex manner, quenching their 
fluorescence in some cases, and enhancing it in others, depending on several factors (Figure 8). 
Smaller particles favor quenching while larger structures preferentially enhance it, which has been 
explained in terms of their absorption and scattering processes (Lakowicz 2005). Fluorescence 
enhancement is maximized at an optimal fluorophore-metal separation; shorter distances cause 
quenching, while longer separations resemble the fluorescence process without nanoparticles. It is 
generally accepted that the electric field enhancement around the particle increases the fluorophore 
excitation rate (Figure 2a). There is some disagreement, however, in its effect on the emission rate. 
Some people consider that, after the fluorophore transfers energy to the nanoparticles, they can 
radiate this energy (Figure 2b), effectively increasing the radiative rate (Ribeiro et al. 2017). Others, 
however, treat this energy transfer as a non-radiative contribution (Figure 2c), and suggest avoiding 
spectral overlap if enhancement is desired (Kang et al. 2011, Yaraki and Tan 2020). Despite the 
lack of mechanistic consensus, both fluorescence quenching and enhancement have been used 
to design biosensors. Quenching-based sensors rely on the initial immobilization of fluorophore￾modified biomolecules, typically peptides or oligonucleotides. Upon interaction with the analyte, 
the fluorophore is released increasing emission. This strategy has been used to detect, for example, 
enzymes and small molecules (Park et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2014).

The use of metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) for actual biomolecule detection was explored 
only in the last two decades using metal colloids or deposits (Geddes et al. 2005, Jeong et al. 2018, 
Badshah et al. 2020, Yaraki and Tan 2020). Since a larger enhancement is observed for small 
quantum yield fluorophores, MEF has been attractive for the sensing of the weak fluorescence of 
some biomolecules, like nucleotides, without the need for a label. However, most systems rely on 
fluorescently labelled biomolecules. Due to the highly customizable particle size and shape, MEF 
systems have been designed for dyes ranging from the UV to the near IR (Fothergill et al. 2018). 
A common mechanism is the interaction between two biomolecules with affinity, one of which is 
labeled with the fluorophore and the other with the nanostructure (Figure 8D). MEF systems can 
be used simply as highly fluorescent labels, requiring constant metal-fluorophore separation for 
maximum enhancement. A SiO2
 shell has been the preferred separator since it can easily coat metal 
nanoparticles and can be further functionalized. 
The highest change in fluorescence can be obtained by switching from the quenching regime to 
the enhancement one. An interesting approach first immobilizes the dye directly on the surface of 
AuNPs, quenching its emission. Separately, silica-coated AgNPs are modified with thiol-terminated 
groups. The interaction between the two kinds of nanoparticles created “hot spots” in the gap 
between them, containing the fluorophore. The enhancement factor compared to the quenched state 
was ~ 100 while the one compared to the free fluorophore was only ~ 5 (Li et al. 2016). Finally, 
silver, gold and copper nanoclusters smaller than 2 nm are fluorescent under certain conditions. 
These clusters require capping or templating agents to avoid aggregation. DNA has been used as 
Figure 8. Steps to design a MEF biosensor. (Reproduced from Fothergill et al. “Metal enhanced fluorescence biosensing: 
from ultra-violet towards second near-infrared window” Nanoscale, 2018, 10: 20914–20929—Published by The Royal 
Society of Chemistry under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.)Nanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 179
a templating agent, allowing for the design of bioassays that change fluorescence according to 
environment modifications by DNA binding events or metal ions (Liu 2014).
Metal nanoparticles (predominantly Au and sometimes Ag) have been used for electrochemical 
biosensing either bare, coated with their capping agent or functionalized with biomolecules (Rasheed 
and Sandhyarani 2017, Wongkaew et al. 2019). Current enhancement based simply on the increased 
electroactive area will not be discussed. AuNPs have been used as labels to electrochemically detect 
biorecognition events at an electrode surface, using various strategies. They can be oxidatively 
dissolved, later reducing the ions back to the metallic form on the electrode surface. A related method 
first deposits Ag on the AuNPs, and Ag electrochemistry is followed instead. Alternatively, captured 
nanoparticles can electrocatalyze a reaction (like water reduction) that would not produce significant 
current in an electrode of another material, like carbon (Parolo et al. 2013). Gold nanoparticles can 
also be modified with electroactive compounds producing a locally high concentration that can 
easily be detected. Some of these electroactive compounds, like ferrocene, are typically included as a 
thiolated derivative covalently modifying AuNPs (Takahashi and Anzai 2013). Others are indirectly 
incorporated, like [Ru(NH3
)6
]3+, which intercalates in AuNPs modified with double-stranded DNA. 
A different strategy involves using the AuNPs as electron conductors to promote electrochemical 
reactions in electrode surfaces modified with mixed self-assembled monolayers containing a 
biomolecule. These layers prevent the electron exchange with electroactive molecules in the solution. 
Upon a biorecognition event, AuNPs bind to the layer enabling electron transfer to the electrode. 
Also, AuNPs improve electron transfer between oxidoreductases and electrode surfaces even better 
than some redox mediators. This has been used to develop sensors to quantify cholesterol, H2
O2
 and 
glucose (Shumyantseva et al. 2005, Tangkuaram et al. 2007, Sharma et al. 2012). Interestingly, the 
use of L-serine as a reducing agent during the AuNP synthesis resulted in nanoparticle chains that 
presented better conductivity and therefore enhanced biocatalytic currents. 
2.2 Semiconductor nanoparticles
Semiconductor nanoparticles have been used in biosensing applications, the most common example 
being the fluorescent quantum dots (QDs). These are typically cadmium chalcogenide (e.g., CdSe) 
nanoparticles 2–10 nm in diameter. Because of the quantum confinement and the material bandgap, 
the fluorescence emission wavelength depends on the particle diameter. Quantum dots absorb light 
in a broadband but emit in narrow peaks that range from the UV to the near IR. Therefore, QDs are 
suitable for multiplexing assays with a single excitation wavelength. Since QDs display superior 
photostability than organic fluorophores, they are used to detect ions, proteins, nucleic acids, drugs, 
etc. (Frasco and Chaniotakis 2009). In their simplest implementation, quantum dots act as labels, 
indicating the presence of a biological molecule. This function, for example, has been used to detect 
apoptotic cells by modifying the quantum dots with the protein annexin V (Le Gac et al. 2006). 
Later, a similar system was applied in a microfluidic device to screen anticancer drug activities in 
an efficient manner (Zhao et al. 2013). Energy transfer to and from the QDs enables more complex 
strategies (Figure 9), starting with their use as donors for FRET assays. Also, QDs can transfer their 
energy to AuNPs, quenching their fluorescence similar to organic dyes. Finally, QD non-radiative 
excitation can be carried out by chemiluminescence, bioluminescence, electroluminescence all of 
which have been used in diverse bioassays (Pisanic et al. 2014). 
Metal oxides of several metals (Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, Ti, Ag, Va, Zr, Zn, W, etc.) have been used to 
produce nanoparticles suitable for biosensing (George et al. 2018). A common approach includes 
immobilization of biomolecules on their surface by either physical or covalent adsorption. Several 
enzymes, for example, have been immobilized to produce electrochemical and optical biosensing 
platforms (Shi et al. 2014). These materials are less costly than noble metals and present catalytical 
or electrocatalytical activity for several reactions of interest, sometimes even offering an (albeit less 
specific) alternative to enzymes. 180 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
2.3 Magnetic nanoparticles
Magnetite (Fe3
O4
) and maghemite (γFe2
O3
) nanoparticles are superparamagnetic, remaining 
magnetized while an external magnetic field is present. This is because their size is smaller than 
the magnetic domain size, causing the individual magnetic moments of all its atoms to be aligned. 
Magnetic nano- and microparticles have been used in biosensing and LOCs, both for separation and 
detection (Jamshaid et al. 2016). In separation, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are functionalized 
with biorecognition elements with affinity to the analyte. Upon application of a non-uniform 
magnetic field either through the movement of a magnet or activation of an electromagnet, MNPs 
in a diamagnetic fluid (like H2
O) are attracted towards the regions of higher magnetic field. This 
phenomenon is called magnetophoresis and traps magnetic particles while the rest of the molecules 
can be washed away. Upon removal of the magnetic field, the particles are resuspended and further 
processed. This batch strategy has its shortcomings, like unwanted entrapment of contaminants in 
the spaces between the aggregated particles. Also, there is the risk of strong interactions forming 
between functionalized particles during the aggregation that may hamper their resuspension. 
Alternatively, MNPs can be sorted in a continuous flow inside microfluidic channels (Alnaimat 
et al. 2018). A magnetic field gradient normal to the flow results in a sum of velocities in a diagonal 
direction. Since the deflection is dependent on the particle size, separation can be achieved based on 
this property. Besides separating magnetically labeled biomolecules and cells, magnetophoresis has 
also been employed to separate red blood cells, which have intrinsic magnetic properties.
A different strategy uses MNPs as labels, usually detecting them through giant magnetoresistance 
(GMR) and magnetic relaxation switching assays (MRSw). In GMR, an electrically conductive 
non-magnetic thin layer is placed between two ferromagnetic ones. If the spins of the ferromagnetic 
layers are parallel, little spin-dependent electron scattering takes place and the electric resistance 
is low. When one of the ferromagnetic layers switches its spin due to an external magnetic field, 
the spins of the two ferromagnetic layers are antiparallel. Increased spin-induced scattering causes

a high resistance that can be monitored externally. These sensors can detect weak magnetic signals 
and are cheaper and much simpler to include in LOC devices compared to superconducting quantum 
interference device (SQUID) magnetometers (Shen et al. 2018). Furthermore, cobalt nanoparticles 
have been embedded in gels, forming nanogranular GMR sensors with the potential to be printed in 
paper-based biosensors (Eickenberg et al. 2013).
Magnetized nanoparticles create an inhomogeneity on the surrounding magnetic field, 
which affects the protons in the neighboring water molecules. Their proton magnetic relaxation 
is characterized by measuring the transverse T2
 relaxation time using nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) techniques. T2 decreases when MNPs aggregate, motivating a variety of so-called magnetic 
relaxation switching (MRSw) bioassays (Figure 10a), favouring aggregation or disaggregation in 
response to the analyte (Haun et al. 2010). NMR measurements have been integrated into microfluidic 
portable platforms (Figure 10b), in which patterned coils are used to both emit the required radio 
frequency (RF) excitation signal and to measure the NMR relaxation response (Lee et al. 2008). A 
mechanistic study using avidin as a model analyte predicted that this technique could achieve limits 
of detection of ∼ 100 fM before the synthesis of particles with high transverse relaxivity becomes 
too complex (Min et al. 2012). 
3. 1D Materials
3.1 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
These nanotubes can be thought of as graphene sheets that have been folded into a cylindrical 
shape. Their intramolecular interactions are dominated by covalent bonds between sp2 carbon atoms, 
while van der Waals forces prevail between neighboring CNTs. The rolling direction (chiral vector) 
heavily influences their properties (Aqel et al. 2012). Carbon nanotubes consisting of a single layer 
or graphene are termed single-walled (SWCNT) while those consisting of several concentric layers 
are called multi-walled (MWCNT). Multi-walled CNTs are highly electrically conductive, while 
the conductivity of SWCNTs depends on their chiral vector, adopting a conductor, semiconductor,

or non-conductor character. Besides their electrical characteristics, CNTs present optical, thermal, 
and mechanical properties that make them interesting in several fields. A common challenge 
when designing biosensors that employ CNTs is their hydrophobic nature. Therefore, CNTs are 
chemically functionalized, also improving their biocompatibility and reducing their toxicity. It is 
common to find the CNTs by themselves or with a biomolecule, incorporated in different polymers/
biopolymers, detergents, solvents, etc. (Pastorin et al. 2005, Tîlmaciu and Morris 2015).
Because of their electrical conductivity and shape, CNTs can serve as electrode “extensions” 
to achieve direct electron transfer between the electrode and the enzyme active site, which in some 
cases is deeply buried (Figure 1). Some of the enzymes that, together with CNTs, have been used 
in biosensors are glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), xanthine 
oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, cholesterol oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and organophosphorus 
hydrolase (Wu and Hu 2007, Xia and Zeng 2020). It is possible to functionalize the CNTs with 
carboxyl, amino or sulfhydryl groups, for example, to generate bonds with the biomolecules 
(Zhou et al. 2019). CNTs modified with more complex groups, like anthracene, aminoethylphenyl, 
naphthoate, 1-pyrenebutyric acid adamantyl amide, favorably orient the enzyme immobilization 
for better DET (Meredith et al. 2011, Lalaoui et al. 2016, Gentil et al. 2018). Zhao et al. evaluated 
the conformational changes of GOx, the most popular enzyme to study DET, when it interacts 
with MWCNTs. Using circular dichroism, they found a higher amount of β-sheet structure and a 
lower amount of α-helix structure compared to the free enzyme. These conformational changes 
could reduce the hindering to the active site, enabling the DET with the CNTs (Zhao et al. 2010). 
The number of walls in MWCNTs affects the efficiency of the DET process. Using CNTs with 
predominantly 1, 3, 7 and 12 walls, Liu et al. reported a maximum DET with the triple-walled tubes. 
They rationalize their observations in terms of the electron tunneling between the walls in the CNT 
(Liu et al. 2018).
Semiconductor SWCNTS display fluorescence in the near-infrared, with their chiral-dependent 
bandgap determining their emission wavelength between 900–1600 nm (Li and Shi 2014). SWCNTs 
offer high photostability and, because of their NIR emission, reduced interference from biological 
autofluorescence (Diao et al. 2015). Other advantages include the absence of blinking and a large 
difference between excitation and emission wavelengths. SWCNTs have been applied in optical 
sensing of proteins, biomarkers, DNA, and small molecules like adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), 
reactive heteroatom species, H2
O2
 and nitric oxide (Farrera et al. 2017, Hofferber et al. 2020).
SWCNTs have been incorporated in Bio-FET devices, delivering “ultrasensitive” detection, 
probably because of their high surface-area to volume ratio as well as the fact that all the charge is 
transported at the surface (Matsumoto and Miyahara 2013, Sadighbayan et al. 2020). CNT FETs 
have been employed to detect DNA hybridization, as well as to detect and quantify protein and 
intracellular molecules of biomedical interest (Allen et al. 2007, Liu and Guo 2012). To use CNTs 
as FET components, they must be arranged between the source and drain electrodes, which demands 
high fabrication capabilities. Also, only semiconductor CNTs are useful, therefore requiring their 
separation from highly conductive ones. 
The inclusion of CNTs in LOC devices has been extensively reviewed (Choong et al. 2008, 
Ghasemi et al. 2017). Besides the applications in the sensing stage, they have been incorporated 
on the walls or forming membranes. CNTs can be grown on substrates that later form part of the 
chip structure or be deposited after assembly, for example, by drop casting or flowing of CNT￾containing solutions or gels through the channels. An interesting use of CNT-modified walls is 
to obtain superhydrophobic surfaces that minimize the fluid-wall contact, therefore reducing the 
hydrodynamic resistance (Joseph et al. 2006). Also, the adsorption of organic compounds by 
CNTs has been exploited to design separation (solid phase extraction and chromatography) stages 
integrated into the LOC devices (Mogensen and Kutter 2012).Nanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 183
3.2 Nanowires
Nanowires (NWs) are cylindrical in shape and usually have diameters of around 10 nm while 
displaying variable aspect ratios, usually above 1000. They are made of many materials, 
including metals (Cu, Au, Ag, Ni, Pt), oxides (ZnO, SiO2
, TiO2
), semiconductors (Si, In, Ga, Ge), 
superconductors (YBCO) and conducting polymers (polypyrrole, polyaniline). Semiconductor 
nanowires are the most useful as biosensing transducers. In fluorescence biosensors, NWs can 
improve the sensitivity by an optical fiber effect, in which fluorophore emission is captured by 
NWs via near field interactions, concentrating and guiding the light. This effect is dependent on 
the NW diameter and light wavelength and is useful for the collection of low fluorescence signals 
(Warren-Smith et al. 2010, Verardo et al. 2018). In an interesting example of NWs in fluorescence￾based sensors, phosphorylated fluorescein was immobilized on Si NWs. Upon dephosphorylation 
by alkaline phosphatase fluorescence increases, allowing enzyme quantification (Wang et al. 2014).
NWs have been used as semiconductor channels in FETs, increasing the sensitivity compared to 
conventional flat FETs (McAlpine et al. 2003). This is partly because of their increased area/volume 
that allows more charged molecules near the semiconductor. BioFETs have been prepared using NWs, 
either depositing them on the electrodes or nanofabricating them. While the first option is simpler 
and cheaper, the second one offers more control and reproducibility. By immobilizing a variety of 
bioreceptors, molecules such as glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, proteins, and oligonucleotides, have 
been detected (Ahmad et al. 2018). 
There are limited examples of NW in LOCs, most of which are included in a few reviews 
that also deal with CNT (Lee et al. 2009, Lim et al. 2010, Krivitsky et al. 2012, Adam et al. 2013, 
Gamal et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2018). A good example incorporates a nanofabricated SiNW FET in 
PDMS microfluidic chips (Figure 11a-b). The NW is modified with amino terminated molecules

the SiNW FET array with detail of the 20 nm wide NWs. (c) Changes in the relative resistance as complementary DNA is

separation system. (e) Changes in the electropherograms as the orientation of the nanowires relative to the channel axis is

onto which ssDNA was electrostatically adsorbed. Upon flow of the complementary DNA through 
the chip, the increase in negative charges produced by the DNA hybridization results in a decrease 
in the FET resistance (Figure 11c) (Bunimovich et al. 2006). Another work demonstrated the use of 
magnetic NiNWs at the outlet of an electrophoresis microchannel as an “adaptative” material. These 
NWs were controlled by an external magnet, positioning them in contact with a current collector 
to use them as an electrode for electrochemical determinations. By rotating the magnet, the NW 
angle with respect to the channel could be controlled, affecting the separation of the signals in the 
electropherogram (Figure 11d-e) (Piccin et al. 2007).
4. 2D Materials
4.1 Graphene-based materials
Graphene has very special electronic and optical properties. Graphene oxide (GO) is obtained 
by chemically oxidizing graphite, exfoliating sheets with a large number of defects and oxygen￾containing groups (Compton and Nguyen 2010). In GO, most of the carbon atoms present a sp3
hybridization and the material is an electrical insulator. GO can be reduced either thermally, 
chemically, or electrochemically, partially restoring the sp2
 structure while leaving some defects 
and oxygen-containing groups. Different electrical conductivities can be obtained depending on 
the C/O atomic ratio (Punckt et al. 2013). These three materials have been integrated into several 
electrochemical, electrical and optical biosensing schemes (Pumera 2011). 
Graphene oxide has been reported to not offer any advantage over graphite in electrochemical 
sensing (Chua et al. 2011). Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has displayed better performance, 
thanks to a balance between the presence of electroactive defect sites and material conductivity. 
For example, it can resolve the electrochemical oxidation of the four nucleobases, while glassy 
carbon and graphite fail to properly separate adenine and thymine signals. This can help estimate 
oligonucleotide composition without the need for a label (Zhou et al. 2009). Graphene has been 
used in FET biosensors. In a recent example, messenger RNA (mRNA) riboswitches immobilized 
on graphene were used to detect uncharged purine analogs. Upon binding of the analytes with 
the riboswitch, its conformation changed, moving the charged phosphate backbone closer to the 
graphene, shifting the FET transfer curve (Tian et al. 2020). In principle, this strategy could also be 
applied to conventional DNA aptamers.
Graphene-based materials have been coupled with other nanomaterials to attain further 
benefits (Parnianchi et al. 2018). For example, decorating graphene with gold nanoparticles helps 
reduce its agglomeration acting as a nano-spacer, while improving the electrical conductivity and 
surface area (Khalil et al. 2016). Several graphene-based biosensors employing electrochemical 
and FET transduction have been successfully incorporated into lab-on-a-chip platforms (Sengupta 
and Hussain 2019). Furthermore, graphene derivatives have also been used in other components 
of the chips. For example, a mixture of reduced graphene oxide and PDMS was used to adsorb 
potentially toxic residues at the chip outlet (Chalupniak and Merkoci 2017). 
5. 3D Materials
Asymmetric silicon nanopillar arrays, in which each row is laterally shifted with respect to the 
previous one, have been used for separation. In this arrangement, smaller objects go straight while 
larger ones follow the nanopillar shift angle, having been employed to separate exosomes and DNA 
in microfluidic chips (Wunsch et al. 2016, 2019). Arrays of metal-coated nanopillars have been 
employed as substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, with signal intensity depending 
on the pillar density and the homogeneity of the hot spots. Some approaches rely on depositing Nanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 185
metal only at the top of the nanopillars, generating “suspended” plasmonic nanoparticles (Magno 
et al. 2018). Others use the structure in the metal deposits to achieve high EM fields (Chen et al. 
2020, Choi et al. 2020). More ambitious strategies use the gaps between the pillars to create the hot 
spots (Liu et al. 2017). Careful fabrication leads to good control of the gap size to maximize the 
desired signal enhancement (Li et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2017). Even smaller gaps were obtained by 
using high aspect ratio nanopillars which, upon solvent evaporation, form structures in which the tips 
of several nanopillars aggregate in a reproducible fashion. Molecules trapped in the space between 
the tips generate the SERS signal (Kim et al. 2011, 2012). These strategies are compatible with LOC 
microfabrication and several examples of integrated devices have been reported (Huang et al. 2015), 
including a nanopillar array integrated within a centrifugal microfluidic device. Besides acting as a 
SERS platform, the array separates analytes based on their affinity for the gold structures (Durucan 
et al. 2018). Although nanosphere lithography has been employed to fabricate arrays of simple 
features like holes and triangles, complex structures like hole-disc and hole-ring combinations have 
also been obtained, providing improved SERS enhancement (Ho et al. 2014).
Hierarchical microscale materials with nanoscale features have been particularly useful in 
electrochemical biosensing. Hollow titania microspheres composed of nanosheets, for example, 
have been shown to trap enzymes in their interior, using the nanoplate structure as funnels, while 
allowing the enzyme substrate to move freely (Xie et al. 2011). The Kelley group has developed 
fractal electrodeposited structures that, when modified with bioreceptors, provide ultrahigh 
sensitivity in electrochemical biosensing (Figure 12c-d). By extending this technology to the 
100 µm scale, they were able to efficiently capture long bacterial RNA, reducing accumulation time

of chitosan (CS) and MWCNTs. Fractal Au structures before (c) and after (d) Pd deposition. (Subfigures a-b republished

by various orders of magnitude (Soleymani et al. 2011). Composite nanomaterials can synergistically 
employ the properties of each component to improve performance. For example, a bi-enzymatic 
electrochemical biosensor was recently developed on a nanostructured porous gold electrode 
(Figure 12a-b). The pores increased the electroactive area and helped in the electrodeposition of 
a chitosan—MWCNT matrix. GOx and HRP were immobilized in this nanocomposite, achieving 
excellent analytical performance and remarkable long-term stability (Juska and Pemble 2020). 
6. Perspectives
Portable biosensors are here to stay. Although they will never be a replacement for clinical laboratories, 
POCs will be important not only in healthcare but also in areas such as food, environment, and 
agriculture (Ragavan and Neethirajan 2019, Farré and Barceló 2020). Microfluidics and related 
techniques will be instrumental in achieving portable and user-friendly devices. As discussed 
throughout the previous sections, several nanostructures have proven their potential for biosensing 
in LOCs. To fully exploit their capabilities, however, several nanostructures can be simultaneously 
integrated with the microscale device features. One great example of such integration uses MNPs 
for separation and AuNPs for transduction (Zheng et al. 2019). The authors also employ polystyrene 
microspheres loaded with catalase flowing the whole system in a microfluidic device (Figure 13). 
The presence of E. coli is quantified employing a smartphone application to extract the hue value 
of images of the detection chamber. Furthermore, the lower energy consumption requirements of 
Figure 13. A microfluidic device for the colorimetric detection of Escherichia coli using a smartphone. The sample 
containing the bacteria is first mixed with polystyrene (PS) microbeads modified with a detection antibody (DAb) and the 
enzyme catalase (CAT), and magnetic nanoparticles with immobilized capture antibodies (CAb). The PS—E. coli—MNPs 
are then separated in a chamber using an external magnetic field. Once released, they move to a second channel in which 
they mix with H2
O2
, horseradish peroxidase, tyramine (TYR) and gold nanoparticles. In the absence of bacteria, catalase is 
not present, and the peroxide triggers a phenol polymerization reaction, cross-linking the AuNPs and changing the solution 
to blue. When E. coli is present, the catalase-containing constructs move into the mixing channel, decomposing the peroxide 
and preventing the aggregation of AuNPs, retaining the red color. (Reprinted from Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 124–125,

aggregation and smart phone imaging”, 143–149, Copyright (2019), with permission from Elsevier.)Nanostructures in Diagnostics: Bio-sensing and Lab-on-a-chip Systems 187
these smaller devices will prompt the integration of energy sources in the same device (Figure 4a), 
achieving self-powered biosensors (Hickey et al. 2016, Çakıroğlu and Özacar 2018).
Nevertheless, there are several challenges in nanobiosensor design, one of them being its 
interdisciplinarity. While the synthesis of the nanomaterials is fully dominated by material scientists, 
the sensing design usually involves the participation of physical, biological, and analytical chemists. 
A lack of deep understanding in any of these areas can result in “handwavy” explanations that 
hinder progress in device reliability. While the use of oversimplified cartoons is didactic, it hides 
the complexity that truly lies in these systems, and that is usually reflected in the uncertainties of 
fabricated device operation. Acknowledging the effects of heterogeneity, contamination and batch 
to batch variations will allow more rational design, and ultimately more predictable responses.
The recent COVID-19 pandemic tested the response of research and development institutions 
to bring applicable ideas to life in an efficient manner. Apart from vaccine development, the 
spotlight was on the availability of testing methods that could be widely applicable in all social 
contexts. Soon, publications appeared detailing POC approaches to the detection of either viral 
RNA or antibodies (Tymm et al. 2020, Hussein et al. 2020). A year after the disease appeared, 
lateral flow immunoassays (Figure 5) and some integrated microfluidic benchtop equipment like the 
Cepheid GeneXpert are the only examples massively applied. This showcases the maturity stage of 
POCs and nanobiosensors and highlights the need for further improvements to achieve the goal of 
handheld ultrasensitive diagnostics.
Finally, it must be remembered that the relationship between nanostructures and lab-on-a-chip 
devices is both ways. While this work has focused on the importance of nanostructures as components 
of biosensing devices, the use of LOC systems to synthesize and characterize nanomaterials has 
been reported (Figure 4c) with exciting developments that can ultimately influence the future of 
nanobiosensors (Medina-Sanchez et al. 2012, Krishna et al. 2013).

1. Introduction
The main field of nanomedicine is treating and diagnosing diseases through the improvement and 
use of nanotechnology and nanomaterials (Li et al. 2019). Nanomaterial dimensions are between 
1 and 100 nm, which is an appropriate size range for helping drugs overcome biological barriers 
and contact the target. Organic and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed for these 
purposes. NPs display a wide range of useful chemical, biological, mechanical, electrical, magnetic, 
and structural properties, and have been employed for gene and drug intracellular distribution. 
Some examples of NPs are quantum dots (QD), lipid nanoparticles (LN), dendrimers (den), metallic 
nanoparticles (MNP), nanogels, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and polymers, among others (Patra 
et al. 2018, Su and Kang 2020, Tayo 2017). Moreover, NPs as drug delivery systems (DDS) can 
improve the efficiency of drugs for anti-microbial, antiviral, and anticancer treatments by using 
various targeting strategies (Figure 1) (Raza et al. 2019a). 
NPs designed for drug delivery systems have unique morphological, physical, and chemical 
properties, which are affected by their size, shape and surface chemistry, all determining their 
biocompatibility, immune response evasion, and controlled release of their cargo (Patra et al. 
2018, Tayo 2017). The payload can be functional genes, small interfering RNA (siRNA), proteins, 
imaging agents, and drugs for in vivo and in vitro therapies (Waehler et al. 2007). For DDS, the 
configuration of the NPs (e.g., inorganic or organic) and the way the payload is linked to the NP 
(e.g., matrix system or core-shell system) are both important (Siepmann et al. 2008). NPs are intended 
to enhance the efficacy and safety profiles of chemotherapeutic drugs or agents and increase the 
target specificity, through passive or active targeting, while being protected from the surrounding 
conditions and without disturbing healthy cells or tissue (Iqbal and Keshavarz 2018, Jeong et al. 
2007). The nanoscale dimensions of NPs enable efficient infiltration of tissue, guarantee a more 
efficient supply of drug at the targeted site, and reduce adverse effects (Mirza and Siddiqui 2014).

NPs can also be designed to respond to endogenous or exogenous stimuli, such as enzymes, 
pH, glutathione (GSH) or light, temperature, ultrasound (US), among others (Tayo 2017). Stimuli￾responsive DDS can extend the capabilities of normal therapeutic treatments. For example, stimuli￾responsive polymeric NPs have a key role to play in different tissue or cell sections, intracellular or 
extracellular, and achieving a precise and efficient payload release (Raza et al. 2019a). Finally, NPs 
have been applied in the field of theranostics, comprising therapy, diagnosis, and as imaging devices 
at the same time, especially in cancer (Haba et al. 2007, Koo et al. 2011, Lehner et al. 2013). 
2. Drug and nanoparticle protection
The administration of drugs or therapeutic agents to the desired location is one of the main difficulties 
for achieving an efficient treatment in several diseases. The therapy with these agents has several 
shortcomings, such as reduced biodistribution, non-selectivity, low bioavailability, unwanted 
adverse effects, poor specificity, and low effectiveness (Kadam et al. 2012, Majumder and Minko 
2020). Likewise, drugs need to overcome several physiological barriers, such as opsonization by the 
mononuclear phagocyte system and poor absorption and solubility (Blanco et al. 2015, Bonifácio 
et al. 2014). An encouraging solution for these problems is to combine drugs with NPs that show an 
enhancement in their biological and physicochemical characteristics and construct a proper targeting 
Figure 1. Representation of several organic and inorganic nanoparticles employed for intracellular drug delivery. 196 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
pathway for delivering the therapeutic agents into the specific location of the body (Jahan et al. 
2017). This targeted application provides for increased drug concentration in the desired location, 
thus reducing the total dosage needed and reducing overall negative side-effects. The several 
disadvantages of NPs are poor access after oral administration, intravenous intakes need more drug 
quantities, lower diffusion capability into the exterior membrane, and undesired side-effects after 
administration (Patra et al. 2018). Furthermore, NPs help in the evasion of the destruction of drugs 
in the gastrointestinal tract and protecting non-water-soluble drugs from physical obstacles to reach 
the desired site (Patra et al. 2018). NPs interact with different drugs via physical interactions such 
as electrostatic and van der Waals forces or chemical interactions such as covalent and hydrogen 
bonds (Patra et al. 2018). Covalently attached drugs to NPs have numerous benefits like increased 
circulation time, less toxicity, more drug stability, and better biocompatibility (Raza et al. 2019a). In 
addition, contrast agents linked to NPs associated with drugs offer a method of tracking and imaging 
in in vivo systems (Yetisgin et al. 2020). However, the efficiency of the delivery will depend on 
the shape, size, and chemical/physical properties of the NPs as well as the targeting of the drug via 
passive or active pathways (Bonifácio et al. 2014).
3. Passive and active targeting
NPs incorporate their payload via two different pathways: passive and self-delivery. In the passive 
mode, cargo is integrated via hydrophobic interactions in the inner cavity. When NPs are targeted 
and reach the desired sites, the proposed quantity of the drug is discharged in a hydrophobic location. 
In self-delivery, the drug molecules are used themselves for building the NPs instead of being only 
the payload and are directly ligated to the NPs structure for simpler distribution. Nevertheless, in 
this method the timing is critical since if it is not released at the proper time, the cargo will not reach 
the target area (Lu et al. 2016). 
Besides, an extra important feature is responsible for categorizing the targeting of drugs 
into passive and active targeting. In passive targeting, the NPs with the payload move inside the 
bloodstream and are attracted to the target site by their affinity to certain properties like molecular 
shape, pH, temperature, and accumulate in specific regions taking advantage of the enhanced 
permeation and retention (EPR) effect as in tumors (Patra et al. 2018, Raza et al. 2019a). The EPR 
effect is attributed to leaky vasculature, lack of efficient lymphatic drainage, and greater number of 
blood vessels in tumors as compared to healthy tissue (Figure 2B) (Fang et al. 2011, Tayo 2017).
The main disadvantage of passive targeting is the early delivery of the drug even if the NP has an 
extended biological half-life (Raza et al. 2019a). 
For DDS with active targeting, NPs are coupled to moieties that provide NPs with the ability to 
target and bind specific locations and diminish immunogenicity. NPs can be coated with recognition 
molecules, including antibodies (Ab), peptides, polysaccharides, polymers, folic acid (FA), among 
others. These modified NPs can recognize the targets or overexpressed receptor structures in 
malignant cells or diseased tissue. The key objectives are often unique proteins or antigens expressed 
on the surface of cancerous cells, as well as receptors and lipid constituents of the cell membrane. 
After identification and attachment to the cell, NPs can cross the cell membrane, reach the desired 
site and deliver the payload (Figure 2A) (Patra et al. 2018, Raza et al. 2019a, Tayo 2017). These NPs 
accumulate in the targeted site, enhance the therapeutic efficiency and reduce side effects from the 
loaded drugs (Majumder and Minko 2020). For example, hyaluronic acid (HA)—a polysaccharide 
found in the extracellular matrix—is a well-used ligand that has demonstrated encouraging outcomes 
to enhance the antitumor activity against several cancers like breast cancer, melanoma stem-like, 
and lung adenocarcinoma, together with reduction of protein corona development and assisting 
DDS for retinal gene treatment (Gao et al. 2017, Shen et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2017). NPs can 
encounter several barriers inside the organism that prevent effective delivery of the therapeutic agent. Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 197

malignant cells and (B) passive targeting taking advantage of the enhanced permeation and retention effect of tumors.
Non-specific binding to non-targeted cells is one common problem. One solution is conjugation 
with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to decrease NP interactions with blood cells and reduce undesirable 
protein adsorption, which is vital for non-fouling NPs in several applications (Tayo 2017). 198 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
4. Barriers to the uptake of nanoparticles
NPs have several obstacles once they enter into the bloodstream. They are predisposed to protein 
opsonization (proteins attach to NP surface as a label for detection from the immune system), 
reticuloendothelial system (RES), aggregation, and immunogenicity to reach the target site 
(Sercombe et al. 2015, Yetisgin et al. 2020). For instance, opsonized NPs are released from the 
bloodstream by filtration from the spleen, kidney, and liver or by phagocytosis. This quick clearance 
from the body reduces retention time and restricts bioavailability. To circumvent this problem, NPs 
are coated with PEG, acetyl groups, or other moieties (Shreffler et al. 2019). Additionally, NPs larger 
than 200 nm are cleared in the RES by phagocytic cells while NPs lesser than 10 nm are cleared 
by filtration via the kidney. Hence, NPs with < 100 nm have a higher circulation period. Further 
NPs between 20–200 nm exhibit more accumulation in tumors since they are not identified by the 
RES or filtrate by physiological systems (Bhatia 2016). Furthermore, the surface charge of the NPs 
has a key function in their clearance. NPs with a positive surface charge produce a greater immune 
response compared to negative or neutral NPs. Surface potentials from –10 to +10 mV exhibit less 
vulnerability to non-specific interactions and phagocytosis (Ernsting et al. 2013). Polymers like 
PEG, poly-lactic acid (PLA), chitosan, and poly-L-lysine reduce the toxicity of cationic NPs (Patra 
et al. 2018).
Once the NPs have reached the target area, they can be internalized by cellular uptake as 
endocytic processes like vesicular internalization, non-phagocytic, and phagocytic pathways. The 
caveolar- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis are commonly studied cellular 
uptake mechanisms. After cellular uptake, the particles are engulfed by the cell membrane and are 
channeled to the intracellular endocytic pathway including endosomes and lysosomes. If the target 
is the nucleus, the NP shape, ligand coating, surface charge, and size need to be well established to 
guide the NP across the nuclear membrane and achieve the internalization into the nucleus (Doherty 
and McMahon 2009, Patra et al. 2018, Zhao et al. 2011). Further, nuclear targeting can be realized 
using TAT peptides conjugated with silica nanoparticles for the delivery of doxorubicin (Pan et al. 
2012). TAT peptides can also be conjugated with gold nanoparticles as well as different kinds of 
polymeric nanoparticles for effective targeting towards the nucleus (Tkachenko et al. 2003). Also, 
once the NPs have arrived at the targeted location either via passive or active targeting, NPs can 
experience poor release of drugs into the target site. To overcome this challenge, stimuli-responsive 
NPs have been developed to provide guided, more efficient and controlled delivery upon several 
stimuli (Majumder and Minko 2020). 
5. Endogenous and exogenous stimuli 
Stimuli-responsive NPs stimulate and control the distribution of the payload and decrease adverse 
effects by shifting the hydrophobic and hydrophilic equilibrium of the NPs structure or by cleaving 
disulfide bonds offering several biomedical applications (Tayo 2017). These stimuli are either 
endogenous (internal or biological) or applied externally (Table 1). Stimuli-responsive NPs are

usually created with hydrophilic or amphiphilic exterior shell and a hydrophobic interior core. The 
shell is normally an endogenous or exogenous susceptible stimuli-responsive polymer (Majumder 
and Minko 2020). 
6. Endogenous stimuli
Endogenous stimuli are specific for diseased tissue and are useful for boosting drug or agent 
specificity. This involves pH, temperature, high quantities of enzymes, and increased concentration 
of GSH due to oxidative stress (Li et al. 2018). The NPs are designed to respond to the endogenous 
stimuli, thus guiding towards the destruction of the NP structure and ultimately delivering the 
encapsulated or attached agent (Rasheed et al. 2018). For instance, tumors are considered to have 
atypical changes in its microenvironment (TME) such as temperature, pH, and oxygen and enzyme 
levels (Yokoyama 2002). These features can be utilized to stimulate the NPs to disintegrate and 
released their cargo at the chosen location (Pärnaste et al. 2017). 
6.1 pH-responsive NPs
NPs can be coated with polymers that are sensitive to pH changes since they have ionizable pendant 
groups attached to the hydrophobic chain of the polymer. Thus, they conjugate a category of 
polyelectrolytes with ionic functional bases (pyridine and amines) that undergoes conformational 
change with variations in the pH or there are acidic sensitive clusters such as sulfonate and carboxylic 
acids that break in acidic pH (Deirram et al. 2019, Manchun et al. 2012, Pang et al. 2016). They 
either donate or accept protons as a consequence of the switching pH (Liu et al. 2017). As a result of 
these electrostatic alterations in the charges, the polymeric chain is changed and the NP is disrupted. 
When the net charge of the chain increases, it produces electrostatic repulsion of the chain, creating 
an alteration in the system from collapsed to expanded state, while when the net charge diminishes 
it goes from expanded to collapsed state (Tayo 2017). This pH responsive strategy as well as the 
targeting moieties attached to the NPs helps in the delivery of the payload in the injured tissues 
as well as in the cell interior. The reason behind this release is that there is minor alteration in 
the pH of damaged tissues in comparison to the normal ones, which stimulates the pH responsive 
polymers to release the cargo, especially in the case of chemotherapeutic drug release in tumor 
microenvironment (Figure 3) (Colson and Grinstaff 2012). The pH of intracellular and extracellular 
matrix is also different, aiding for more specific targets (Wu et al. 2018).
Two protocols are used for creating NPs with pH-responsiveness like integrating acid￾functionalized groups to the polymeric backbone or linking active drugs to the lateral chain of 
the polymer. These active drugs have the option to begin the pH-responsiveness, making several 
conformational variations in the polymeric support altering the NPs structure. Numerous polymers 
have been employed for fabricating pH-responsive NPs such as acrylic acid, PLA, polyketals, 
acrylonitrile, polycarbonates, polyanhydrides, methacrylic acid, and polycaprolactone (PCL) 
(Chen et al. 2010, Zhang et al. 2007). These polymers are involved partially or completely in 
initiating changes in the hydrophilic character as a response to pH-stimuli leading to the destruction 
of the NP (Raza et al. 2019a). For example, healthy tissues and malignant tissues have different pH 
values. TME and inflammation sites have a pH of 6.5 to 7.2 as compared to 7.4 of normal tissues. 
The TME has lower pH since acidic metabolites are generated from the hypoxic surroundings, thus 
stimulating NPs to release the anti-cancer drugs towards the target site (Figure 3) (Tayo et al. 2015). 
Additionally, pH-responsive liposomes are applied against Hepatitis-B virus to realize cytosolic 
cargo delivery (Wu et al. 2018).200 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
6.2 Redox-responsive based drug delivery
Redox potential gradients exist around extra- and intracellular surroundings of diseased tissue. The 
concentration of the reducing agent GSH is two times higher in the nucleus and cytosol than in the 
extracellular space or endosomes (Cheng et al. 2011, Meng et al. 2009, Schafer and Buettner 2001, Son 
et al. 2012). The redox potential around intracellular (reductive) and extracellular (oxidative) space 
is associated with the GSH concentration (Schafer and Buettner 2001). NPs redox-responsiveness 
is helpful when the payload is targeted inside the cell and is more advantageous for DNA or siRNA 
distribution (Fleige et al. 2012, Mintzer and Simanek 2009). Moreover, higher amounts of oxidizing 
agents such as superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide are the result of cancer cell proliferation 
(Raza et al. 2019a). One goal is to create glutathione-responsive NPs with acid-labile groups (Cheng 
et al. 2011). This includes disulfide linkers in the shell of the NP that can be reduced and cleaved to 
release the drug or gene at the target site within the cell (Cheng et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2009, Son et al. 
2012). The disulfide connection in glutathione-responsive block copolymers among hydrophobic 
and hydrophilic parts generates a micelle configuration called “shell-shedable”. At the same time, 
when these micelles enter the circulation in the extracellular milieu, the disulfide linkers of the NPs 
are undamaged, but when they enter into the cytosol, following endocytosis inside the malignant 
cells, the disulfide linkers are reduced to thiol groups and cleaved due to the elevated levels of GSH, 
leading to the destruction of the NP and eliciting the cytosolic discharge of the payload (Figure 4) 
(Cheng et al. 2011, Majumder and Minko 2020, Meng et al. 2009). Since tumors have higher GSH 
values than healthy tissue, NPs with cleavable disulfide bonds can be utilized to target tumors with 
redox-responsive systems and distribute anti-cancer drugs like trastuzumab, doxorubicin (DOX), 
and p53 tumor suppressor gene (Kumar et al. 2017, Son et al. 2010). 
6.3 Enzyme-responsive NPs
The biocatalytic activity of enzymes present within diseased cells can also be utilized for targeted 
delivery by creating enzyme-responsive NPs (Rasheed et al. 2018). In every metabolic and biological 
activity, the dysregulation or regulation of enzymes in the microenvironment at intracellular level 
have main roles in responsive DDS since they offer advantageous and exclusive characteristics 
(Hu et al. 2013, Rasheed et al. 2018). The payload is delivered when the polymeric moiety is 
destroyed by enzymes (Raza et al. 2019a). Glycosidases, phospholipases, and proteases are of 
high significance because they are regularly overexpressed in malignant tissue as inflammation 
and cancer (Figure 5) (Basel et al. 2011, Majumder and Minko 2020). Trypsin is one of the main 
digestive proteinases and has a key role in exciting numerous digestive enzymes. Radhakrishan

Figure 4. Internalization of redox-responsive nanoparticle. The redox-responsive bonds are stable outside the malignant 
cells with low levels of glutathione. Once the nanoparticle enters the malignant cell by endocytosis, the levels of glutathione 
rise, reducing the disulfide bonds to thiol groups and releasing the drug from the nanoparticle. 
Figure 5. Enzyme-responsive nanoparticle in normal state before enzyme action and disrupted nanoparticle with the enzyme

and co-workers (2014) created a nanocapsule for delivering anticancer drugs inside the malignant 
cells that can be disrupted with the presence of trypsin and deliver the cargo (Radhakrishnan et al. 
2014). Moreover, another therapeutic target involved in Alzheimer’s disease are oxidoreductases 
due to their key function in oxidative stress and in cancerous tissues is the extracellular proteolytic 
enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases which are overexpressed (Eskandari et al. 2019, Kundu 
and Surh 2010, Shay et al. 2015). In addition, neutrophils are the first immune cells to arrive at 
the inflammatory sites and secrete a protease called human neutrophil elastase. This protease is 
employed for controlled DDS and enhances the targeted anti-inflammatory therapies (Aimetti et al. 
2009, Korkmaz et al. 2010, Rosales 2018).
6.4 Temperature-responsive NPs
Polymers susceptible to temperature become totally miscible with water/solvent above or below 
the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) or lower critical solution temperature (LCST), 
respectively (Bordat et al. 2019, Tayo 2017). These NPs are created to survive at high temperatures 
by releasing the cargo and elevated temperatures are natural in tumor or diseased tissue areas 
(Khoee and Karimi 2018). For instance, healthy and damaged tissues have a narrow difference 202 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
of temperatures. This provides the opportunity to design NPs with a payload that remain stable 
under normal body temperature and then switch precisely and rapidly their hydrophilicity and 
hydrophobicity equilibrium to collapse and deliver the agents or genes within the injured tissues 
in response to the higher temperature (Figure 6) (Cheng et al. 2008, Chilkoti et al. 2002, Liu et al. 
2017, Schmaljohann, 2006, Zhang et al. 2005a). For example, temperature-responsive NPs had 
more delivery of drugs in diseased tissue with temperatures around 40ºC as compared to normal 
tissue at 37ºC, thus exhibiting decreased cell viability in cell cytotoxicity assays (Khoee and Karimi 
2018). 
6.5 Ionic microenvironment-responsive NPs
Ionic microenvironment-responsive NPs are created with suspended basic or acidic functional units 
in the polymer structure, highly manipulating the degree of ionization. Therefore, from the total 
number of units the NP has, the degree of ionization will depend on releasing the payload (Raza 
et al. 2019a, Zhang et al. 2005b). An elevated number of acidic entities in the polymeric vehicle 
enhances the electrostatic repulsion among carboxyl groups with negative charge of diverse chains 
causing more swelling at a higher pH. Conversely, a high quantity of basic entities like amines can 
ionize and at low pH exhibit electrostatic repulsion (Zhang et al. 2005b). Thus, these responsive 
polymeric NPs can either donate or accept protons as a response to ionic strength changes, thus 
activating the drug delivery. Polymers with LCST changes are more attractive for fabricating ionic 
microenvironment-responsive NPs (Furyk et al. 2006). 
7. Exogenous stimuli 
Exogenous stimuli are physical phenomena that depend upon the external milieu of the target area 
once the loaded NPs reach the diseased site. These stimuli can involve magnetic field, electric 
field, ultrasound, temperature, or light and are accountable for alterations or destruction of the NP 
structure leading to the cargo release (Hu et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2017, Rasheed et al. 2018). Hence, in 
these procedures the outer factors control exactly the payload delivery and can be applied to specific 
areas in the body to activate the distribution of the drug. Most of these stimuli lead to the production 
of heat; thus, the design of the thermo-responsive polymeric NPs are of great interest (Raza et al. 
2019a, 2019b).

drug at tumor tissue areas.Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 203
7.1 Temperature-responsive DDS
Temperature-responsive DDS maintain the agent or drug in normal temperature and upon exposure 
to elevated temperatures, the cargo is released (Liu et al. 2016). DDS are created to respond to 
external stimuli over the desired site. This rise of temperature stimulates the NP to generate heat 
and modify the thermo-sensitive material of the DDS in such a way that it ruptures and delivers the 
cargos at the desired site. This procedure is normally applied for inducing hyperthermia for thermal￾based treatments with chemotherapy at the same time. Light, magnetic field, and ultrasound are 
usually employed for this purpose because they show an accurate control and production viability 
(Figure 7) (Raza et al. 2019a, Yang et al. 2018). The temperature-responsive polymers, LCST and 
UCST, respond to variation of temperature. At lower temperatures below LCST, the polymers 
are accountable for higher swelling due to increase in hydrophilicity. Furthermore, an increase in 
hydrophilicity is done by a rise of temperature beyond UCST. These changes in DDS hydrophilicity 
swelling leads to the payload release (Karimi et al. 2015). For example, micelles loaded with DOX 
and camptothecin grafted with polypyrrole were exposed to the near infrared region (NIR). The 
absorption produced heat due to photo-thermal influence raising the temperature and stimulating 
the cargo delivery from the micelles. This heat created an enlargement of temperature-responsive 
polymer by conversion from hydrophobic to hydrophilic (Yang et al. 2018). 
Figure 7. Representation of temperature-responsive nanoparticle with thermal agents in normal tissue and activated by 
external temperature stimulus disrupting the nanoparticle and releasing the drug at tumor tissue areas. 
7.2 Light-responsive NPs
Light-responsive NPs are used in pharmaceutical and biomedical studies to accomplish drug delivery 
as they have the advantage of superior spatiotemporal control (Lino and Ferreira 2018). Several 
wavelengths like ultraviolet (UV), visible, and NIR are applied for regulating the cargo release 
(Figure 8) (Hossion et al. 2013). Nevertheless, due to the low penetration of UV and visible light, 
they are not considered for therapy purposes in vivo, whereas NIR is a valuable light source since 
it infiltrates deep into tissues being less destructive, with more penetration, and more secure than 
the UV light to the organism (Saravanakumar and Kim 2014, Xiang et al. 2018). One strategy for 
constructing a light sensitive NP is by including adequate photochromic functional clusters in block 
copolymers that switch hydrophobic and hydrophilic equilibrium in the micellar structure once the 
NP is exposed to the light wavelengths (Babin et al. 2009, Zhao 2012). Photochromic moieties are 
usually light-responsive polymeric nanomaterials. When light hits the moieties, they experience 
photochemical changes like photocleavage, photoisomerization, and photodimerization, eventually 
leading to the disruption of the NP, thus releasing the payload. This light source is easily operated 204 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

and disrupting the nanoparticle. 
from the exterior of the organism (Fomina et al. 2012, Tomatsu et al. 2011). It is also considerable to 
use surface plasmon and additional photothermal effects to activate the delivery of the cargo in the 
desired cells (Zhao 2007). Moreover, the plasmon absorption of NPs can be adjusted for activating 
them at any required wavelength between UV and NIR region (Tayo 2017). Three approaches exist 
for drug delivery with NIR: 
- Upconverting NPs is a method to initiate elevated energy light-sensitive constituents by the NIR 
light and transform NIR light to UV or visible light. This method is used for new fluorescence 
labels for imaging and sensitive bioanalysis. Also, it is beneficial for photopolymerization since 
after the conversion of NIR to UV or visible light, it activates a cascade of polymerizations 
(Gwon et al. 2018). 
- Two-photon activation: at the same time two identical or different frequency photons excite 
a particle from its ground state to a greater energy state. This approach needs an excited light 
source to center small areas to obtain effective instantaneous energy. This technique has been 
used for imaging and DDS NIR-responsive unit fabrication for a two-photon of NIR absorption 
with two-photon NIR sensitizing agent (two-photon in NIR equal to one-photon of UV) (Yang 
et al. 2016b). 
- Photo-thermal effect: this technique involves the conversion of light into heat by photo-thermal 
agents stimulating heat sensitive material, thus disrupting the NPs’ structure guiding the drug 
release. The photo-thermal agent such as IR780 on exposure to a particular wavelength of light 
transforms into heat, thus weakening the NP platform (Li et al. 2017, Raza et al. 2019). 
7.3 Ultrasound-responsive NPs
Ultrasound (US) waves are reviewed as external stimuli since they are generated by radiation forces 
as well as mechanical and thermal effects, which are accountable for stimulating the DDS for 
delivering the cargo (Figure 9) (Luo et al. 2017, Paris et al. 2015). Elevated US exposure generates 
microbubbles that collapse quickly at inertial cavitation boosting the absorbency of the genes or 
drug delivery into the malignant tissue (Yan et al. 2013). The drawbacks of microbubbles are their 
big dimensions and small circulation period reducing the clinical uses (Tayo 2017). For instance, 
US was employed for heating PEGylated mesoporous silica NPs (MSN) with a thermo-responsive 
linker. The linker was cleaved after 24 hours of US waves treatment guiding the DDS and exhibiting 
a positive charge on the MSN, thus rising the cellular uptake. This MSN displayed around 50% 
decrease in cell viability of human osteosarcoma compared with no US exposure (Aryal et al. 2010).Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 205
Figure 10. Representation of magnetic-responsive nanoparticle being guided to the tumor tissue area by an external magnetic 
field and heated to produce magnetic hyperthermia and release the drug.
7.4 Magnetic-responsive NPs
Magnetic field stimuli control the magnetic-responsive DDS since it infiltrates into the body tissue 
and is employed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Raza et al. 2019a). This stimulus guides 
the drug to its target and induces hyperthermia for delivering the payload (Figure 10) (Schleich et al. 
2015, Thirunavukkarasu et al. 2018). Hyperthermia-based magnetic NPs are studied for drug delivery 
purposes. Local hyperthermia gives the possibility of magnetic based imaging due to it being a 
contrast agent and finally leading to tumor inhibition (Zhou et al. 2018). Thirunavukkarasu and 
colleagues (2018) showed a difference between the DOX release at different temperatures loaded 
onto a superparamagnetic iron oxide (Fe3
O4
) nanoparticle (SPION) with temperature sensitive poly￾lactic-co-glycolic acid (PGLA) base and the drug alone. The in vitro studies showed ~ 39% of drug 
distribution at 37ºC as compared to ~ 57% at 45ºC. The temperature of the medium was raised to 
5.2ºC by employing an alternating magnetic field (AMF) at 4.4 kW displaying an important tumor 
inhibition besides being an in vivo MRI contrast agent (Thirunavukkarasu et al. 2018). Therefore, 
SPIONs are injected close to the target area and when magnetic fields are applied at the target 
location, the magnetic force will guide the SPIONs to gather and deliver the cargo (McBain et al. 
2008).

7.5 Electrical-responsive NPs
After electro-responsive NPs uptake, weak electrical field is employed over the desired area 
achieving a coordinated on-site drug delivery. Several processes for releasing the payload with 
electrical stimulation are known such as destroying NPs structure, redox reactions, and incentive 
of temperature-responsive DDS via generated heat by electrical impulses (Ge et al. 2012, Jeon 
et al. 2011, Servant et al. 2013). Finally, each stimuli-responsive NP has several challenges and 
advantages as exhibited in Table 2.Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 207
8. Organic and inorganic nanoparticles
NPs’ size makes them suitable for several agents to overcome biological obstacles and move 
them to the desired target area, more bioavailability is achieved for poor soluble drugs, and an 
improved protection from destruction is accomplished. Also, NPs surface can be modified for their 
effective applications in several medical services, particularly with targeted therapy. These changes 
functionalize and stabilize the NPs improving their efficiency and letting them to be responsive to 
internal or external stimuli. Therefore, diverse clinical needs demand different DDS to encounter the 
particular necessities. These NPs are classified by their structures and compositions into organic and 
inorganic NPs (Figure 11) (Su and Kang 2020). 
Figure 11. Nanoparticles’ division between organic and inorganic and their subsequent divisions used in health treatments 
and therapeutic applications. 
8.1 Organic nanoparticles 
Organic NPs are perfect for attaching or encapsulating drugs, genes, or imaging probes and 
supplying the payload in an organized process into the desired target area. Organic NPs are divided 
into polymeric systems including micelles, dendrimers, and nanogels and lipid-based systems 
comprising solid lipid NPs (SLN) and liposomes. The majority of approved NPs by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical therapies and treatments are organic NPs (Jahangirian et al. 
2017, Xing et al. 2016).
8.1.1 Lipid-based systems
Solid lipid nanoparticles
Solid lipid NPs are aqueous colloidal dispersions of 10 to 100 nm size contained in a solid lipid 
matrix at body and room temperature. The drug release characteristics are affected by the type 
of lipid while the biodegradable and biocompatible surfactants enhance their stability (de Jesus 
and Zuhorn 2015, Majumder and Minko 2020). SLN are multipurpose drug vehicles encapsulating 
high numbers of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and lipophilic drugs and nucleic acids (Dolatabadi et al. 208 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
2015, Majumder and Minko 2020). SLNs are normally fabricated with an elevated configuration of 
liquid lipids heated higher than their melting point dissolving the drug in the liquefied lipid. This 
mixture of drug with melted lipid is distributed in the aqueous phase and heated for achieving a 
homogenized mixture. Moreover, SLNs can be coated with different moieties to control the target 
delivery and stimuli-responsive drug discharge exhibiting success in releasing therapeutic agents via 
pulmonary, intranasal, and oral administration. SLNs increase the oral bioavailability by 3.5- and 
11-folds of glibenclamide and efavirenz, correspondingly, compared to drug suspensions (Battaglia 
et al. 2016, Elbahwy et al. 2017, Gaur et al. 2014, Shen et al. 2015). Likewise, SLNs are employed 
for topical and ocular drug administration because the benefits of a higher absorption of the NP is 
achieved on the biological membranes. This way of administration is important since it elevates the 
therapeutic efficiency by accumulating the cargo locally and decreasing the adverse effects produced 
by systemic circulation (Mu and Holm 2018). Also, SLNs are employed as DDS to enhance the poor 
stability of siRNAs and reach the desired location for therapeutic activities (Majumder and Minko 
2020). Mu and Holm (2018) gives more information about the SLN design and characterization for 
drug delivery (Mu and Holm 2018). 
Liposomes 
Liposomes are spheres constituted by a phospholipid bilayer surrounding completely an aqueous 
core. Big liposomes have a diameter of 200 nm while the small liposomes between 60 and 80 nm 
(Joshi et al. 2016). The usual procedure for liposome synthesis is thin layer humidification, 
motorized stirring, solvent dehydration, solvent insertion, and surfactant solubilization (Kotla 
et al. 2017). They are arranged in different structures, size, and composition with several lipids 
and surface changes like attaching ligands or PEG to the surface for more stabilization named 
PEGylation (Suk et al. 2016, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Moreover, agents are incorporated into the hollow 
core of the liposome after formation (active) or during formation (passive). These features facilitate 
the therapeutic treatment since the hydrophilic drugs (e.g., 5-fluro-deoxyuridine and ampicillin) 
are normally loaded into the aqueous core and the hydrophobic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B and 
indomethacin) in the hydrocarbon chain, thus increasing their biodistribution (Akbarzadeh et al. 
2013, Kotla et al. 2017, Patra et al. 2018). Additionally, several kinds of agents can be incorporated 
either in numerous aqueous layers or within lipid and aqueous compartments (Figure 12). This 
enables the delivery of several cargos in sequence with separation of layer among outer shell and 
inner core (Patil and Jadhav 2014). Nevertheless, payload inside the liposomes are not accessible 
until they are delivered; hence, it is important to accumulate numerous liposomes in the target site 
to increase bioavailability (Akbarzadeh et al. 2013). 
Figure 12. Liposomes used for therapeutic treatments with hydrophilic drugs loaded into the aqueous core and hydrophobic 
drugs in the hydrocarbon chain. Also, liposomes can be incorporated either in aqueous layers or within lipid and aqueous 
compartments.Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 209
These NPs are noteworthy DDS as the inner aqueous core gives protection to the payload from 
the surrounding environment and due to the similarity between liposome and cell membrane, it 
enables the assimilation of the cargo into the cytoplasm (Bozzuto and Molinari 2015, Elegbede et al. 
2008). For example, different liposomal shapes like ellipsoids, spheres, and cylinders have been 
employed with the drug, Doxorubicin (Sumetpipat and Baowan 2014). The first FDA approved NP 
for therapy were liposomes from lipid systems and micelles. Doxil, a doxorubicin-based liposome, 
was the initial FDA accepted DDS for treating breast and ovarian cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma 
(Bulbake et al. 2017, Patra et al. 2018). Furthermore, liposomes have already been combined with 
numerous stimulators like pH, light, ultrasound, temperature, and enzymatic responses and imaging 
agents along the target ligand to enhance the efficacy while having theranostic properties (Sercombe 
et al. 2015, Tayo 2017). Some problems with liposomes moving in the bloodstream are its encounter 
with low- and high-density lipoproteins reducing their stability and attracting opsonins aiding the 
RES on identifying and destroying liposomes, but they also have several advantages (Table 3) (Patra 
et al. 2018). 
Polymeric systems
Polymeric nanomaterials have achieved more consideration for drug and gene delivery due 
to different advantages (Table 3) (Crucho and Barros 2017). Several NPs enter in this category 
such as nanogels and micelles and their toxicity varies according to the polymer used during the 
synthesis. Several natural and synthetic polymers are widely employed for NPs’ production. Natural 
polymers like alginate, gelatin, albumin, and chitosan offer an important enhancement in the agent’s 
efficiency and overcome toxic problems. On the other hand, to reduce toxicity and immunogenicity 
of synthetic polymers as PEG, polyvinyl alcohol, PCL, PGLA, and PLA, the polyester forms are 
employed (Letchford et al. 2009, Patra et al. 2018). The biodegradability and biocompatibility 
of polymeric systems depends on which polymer is utilized during synthesis (Patra et al. 2018). 
Polymeric NPs are divided in two categories according to their composition: (i) nanocapsules have 
an exclusive polymer membrane that surrounds the therapeutic drug and (ii) nanospheres have a 
polymeric matrix in which the therapeutic drug is directly distributed throughout the matrix. The size 
of these NPs varies between 10 and 200 nm for biomedical objectives (Letchford et al. 2009, Patra 
et al. 2018). Furthermore, these NPs’ surface can be changed and functionalized with a recognition 
ligand increasing the specificity of polymeric NPs for the desired location (Yetisgin et al. 2020). For 
example, chitosan-based NPs merged with FA and alginate are good carriers of 5-aminolevulinic 
acid aiding for diagnosis of colorectal cancer and allowing endoscopic fluorescent detection (Yang 
et al. 2011).
Micelles 
Micelles are built of amphiphilic-block copolymers showing a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic 
exterior shell, supplying safety from non-specific uptake by the RES guaranteeing more stability 
(Ahmad et al. 2014). These features help transport several essential water insoluble chemotherapeutic 
drugs like camptothecin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and tamoxifen towards their target, while at the same 
time the exterior shell stabilizes the core, making the entire arrangement water soluble (Maeda 
2010, Patra et al. 2018). Micelles are synthesized via precipitation of one block by complementing 
with a solvent or solvent-based straight ending of polymer trailed by a dialysis process (Miyata 
et al. 2011, Xu et al. 2013). The size of the micelles varies from 10 to 100 nm, which also increases 
the capability of taking the advantage of the EPR effect, accumulation in the tumor site, and usually 
possess a limited dissemination to evade quick renal excretion, thus increasing its tumor tissue 
concentration (Maeda 2010, Patra et al. 2018). Moreover, surface modification of the micelles aids 
in protecting the agent or drug from being destroyed by the gastrointestinal system creating an 210 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

option for oral distribution of protein drugs like insulin (Veiseh et al. 2014). Drugs are incorporated 
into polymeric micelles by three processes (Mourya et al. 2011):
- Dialysis: the solution of copolymer and the drug in organic solvent, located in the organic 
solvent, is merged within a dialysis bag and submerged into water. Then the solvent is exchanged 
with water, creating the micelle assembly with the drug in solution in a dialysis bag and is 
dialyzed afterwards. 
- Direct dissolution: in the water medium, the drug and amphiphilic copolymer merge together 
by themselves forming drug-loaded micelles. This method is generally linked with low drug 
loading. 
- Solvent evaporation: a volatile organic solvent dissolves the drug and copolymer, and a thin 
film of both products is obtained after removing the solvent by evaporation. The polymeric 
micelles loaded with the drug is the result of the reconstitution of the film with water. Both the 
cargo and copolymer are dissolved using an organic solvent. 
8.1.2 Nanogels
Nanogels are mainly hydrophilic and biocompatible polymeric networks with a diameter smaller 
than 100 nm produced by electrostatic interactions, covalent or hydrogen bonding, or Van der 
Waals forces (Dumville et al. 2011, Oh et al. 2008, Skulason et al. 2012). Nanogels possess 
high hydrophilicity and swelling properties with adaptable size as well as elevated water content 
permitting them to encapsulate huge quantities of water in aqueous solution (Dumville et al. 2011, 
Skulason et al. 2012, Tahara and Akiyoshi 2015). They are good DDS options since they entrap drugs, 
proteins, cytokines, vaccines, and DNA or RNA, reduce drug escape, and are easily administered 
via mucosal or parenteral ways (Neamtu et al. 2017). In addition, nanogels deliver the payload by 
passive diffusional discharge or the nanogels’ surface structure can be modified for active targeting 
(Dumville et al. 2011, Skulason et al. 2012).
8.1.3 Dendrimers (den)
Dendrimers are complex, large, three-dimensional, and highly monodispersed NPs. They are 
synthesized via a repetitive sequence of chemical reactions controlling the size regulated by each 
generation either by initiating the structure from the core and going to the outside or initiating 
from the outside of the dendrimer (Figure 13) (Cheng et al. 2011, Paleos et al. 2010). Their usual 
Figure 13. Representation of dendrimer’s structure. 212 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
size is between 1 and 10 nm and are produced by polymerization in spherical structure guiding the 
formation of cavities inside the den. These inner core cavities are hydrophobic in nature, thus aiding 
hydrophobic drug delivery, and possess the capability of entrapping high molecular weight drugs, 
aiding gene treatments (Chauhan 2018, Pavan et al. 2010, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Three ways exist for 
loading the payload into the den: covalent conjugation, normal encapsulation, or static interaction 
(Tripathy and Das 2013). Additionally, den have free end groups, which can be changed or employed 
to increase the target specificity and distribution of the drug (Yetisgin et al. 2020). den release the 
cargo by in vivo destruction of covalent bonding of the drug due to appropriate enzymes, suitable 
environment, or variations in it facilitating the administration of the agent (Tripathy and Das 2013). 
Furthermore, several categories of den exist such as poly-propyleneimine (PPI), core-shell, peptide, 
chitin, chiral, polyethyleneimine, liquid crystalline, and poly-amidoamine (PAMAM). PAMAM is 
the most used dDen for biomedical applications such as oral, ocular, and transdermal drug delivery 
(Kesharwani et al. 2014, Noriega-Luna et al. 2014, Tayo 2017). Moreover, PAMAM is employed 
for downregulating multidrug resistance in cancer by incorporating siRNAs-related protein 
(Pan et al. 2019).
8.2 Inorganic Nanoparticles
Inorganic NPs have several intrinsic features like optical, mechanical, electronic, and magnetic 
properties that are suitable for diagnosis, imaging, and sensing (Dong et al. 2015, Dreaden 
et al. 2012). Inorganic NPs include gold (Au), silver (Ag), iron oxide, silica NPs, QDs, and CNTs. 
Nonetheless, only a certain number of inorganic NPs have been recognized for clinical use since the 
majority remain in clinical trials (Patra et al. 2018). 
8.2.1 Metallic nanoparticles 
Metallic NPs applied for medical purposes are in the size range of 1–100 nm (Yetisgin et al. 2020). 
The most reviewed MNPs are Au, Ag, iron (Fe), and copper (Cu), but other types such as palladium 
(Pd), zinc oxide (ZnO), cerium dioxide (CeO2
), gadolinium (Gd), titanium dioxide (TiO2
), and 
platinum (Pt) are gaining more attention (Patra et al. 2018). Besides, the surface of MNPs can be 
modified for decreasing the cytotoxicity of the NPs and enhancing the precision of their targets, 
biocompatibility, and stability (Tayo 2017, Yetisgin et al. 2020). For example, drugs are physically 
adsorbed by AuNPs or linked to AuNPs surface through covalent or ionic bonding, delivering them 
in a stable way via stimuli activation once AuNPs are internalized into cells through receptor￾mediated endocytosis (Jia et al. 2017, Kong et al. 2017). AuNPs are also useful for colorimetric 
biosensing and bioimaging with photoacoustic, two-photon luminescence, and photothermal 
imaging (Dreaden et al. 2012). Likewise, AuNPs and AgNPs possess a feature, which is known 
as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) (Patra et al. 2018). When the suitable wavelength 
of light is applied as an external stimuli, they show photothermal conversion due to the LSPR 
and generate heat, thus damaging the malignant cells (Yetisgin et al. 2020). In addition, the LSPR 
properties can be personalized for different application as diagnosis, imaging, photothermal therapy, 
and electrochemical and optical detection (Singh et al. 2018). 
8.2.2 Magnetic nanoparticles
On the other hand, MNPs formed from their oxides like magnetite (Fe3
O4
), maghemite (Fe2
O3
), 
cobalt ferrite (CoFe2
O4
), and chromium dioxide (CrO2
) are interesting since they have the skill of 
arbitrarily flipping direction of magnetization with the effect of temperature, a characteristic known 
as superparamagnetism, and they respond to an exterior magnetic field. This magnetic moment 
provides a robust signal variation in MRI and when they are exposed to an AMF, they generate heat 
named magnetic hyperthermia, allowing eradication of cancer tumors (Ali et al. 2016, Andocs et al. Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 213
2009, Tayo 2017, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Also, these magnetic NPs can be directed to a particular region 
in the body applying an external magnetic field (Figure 10). A key factor for medical applications 
is the ratio of stimulated magnetization to the related field called magnetic susceptibility (Cuenca 
et al. 2006). For instance, SPIONs are extensively used as contrast agents in MRI due to their large 
magnetic susceptibility (Cuenca et al. 2006). Moreover, the superparamagnetic features enable the 
stable release of cargo to the target location with a higher accumulation (Fan et al. 2011). Finally, 
FDA approved ferumoxytol for iron deficiency anemia, blocking tumor development by stimulating 
pro-inflammatory macrophages polarization (Zanganeh et al. 2016). For more information about 
magnetic NPs in nanomedicine, check Wu and colleagues’ (2019) review (Wu et al. 2019). 
8.2.3 Silica-based
Silica-based NPs have several advantages and are an interesting carrier due to their porosity, 
capacity of functionalization, and surface features, being able to load genes, therapeutic proteins, 
and drugs (Table 3) (Chen et al. 2018, Tang et al. 2012). Silica NPs have a big surface area wrapped 
with polar silanol moieties, encouraging water adsorption and enhancing the payload stability 
(Bharali et al. 2005). This high surface area of silica-based NPs possess a high capacity suitable for 
loading therapeutic agents and link several ligands such as antibody, peptides, functional groups, 
among others for active targeting. Moreover, the sealable pores with modifiable size, geometry, 
and structure enable a homogenous integration of different drugs with diverse properties and sizes 
(Figure 14) (Majumder and Minko 2020, Tang et al. 2012). Additionally, the pore size is designed to 
accomplish a continuous release rate and to be covered with stimuli-responsive moieties to increase 
the drug administration in the targeted location like the supply of the encapsulated β-cyclodextrin 
in tumor tissue with acidic pH (Mura et al. 2013). Nevertheless, the pore size is highly selective 
for drug absorption. Silica-based NPs have an open entry for the therapeutic cargo to enter in the 
body and properly distribute itself in a well-organized fashion. Therefore, these NPs’ pore diameter 
has to be well manufactured and designed for the chosen drug, since molecules superior to the pore 
diameter will not be efficiently absorbed into the NP (Tang et al. 2012). Tang and associates (2012) 
possess more information about the synthesis, biocompatibility, and drug delivery of silica-based 
NPs (Tang et al. 2012). 
Figure 14. Representation of silica-based nanoparticle.
8.2.4 Carbon nanotubes
Carbon-based nanotubes have tubular structures between 1–100 nm in length and 1 nm in 
diameter (Figure 11) (Iijima 1991). Carbon nanotubes comprise single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) 
(1–2 nm diameter), multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) (2 to 6 nm interior and 5 to 20 nm exterior 214 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
diameter), and C60 fullerenes (Hasnain et al. 2018, Reilly 2007). The firm geometric form and 
size of carbon nanotubes make them interesting DDS, especially C60 fullerenes and SWNTs, since 
their inner diameter is equal to half of the average helix diameter of DNA (Reilly 2007). Raw 
CNTs are hydrophobic; thus, they first need to be modified for biomedical applications and become 
more biocompatible and water-soluble (Liu et al. 2009). For instance, PEGylation improves the 
cargo loading size (Liu et al. 2010). A PEGylated CNT with paclitaxel was evaluated in the 4T1 
murine breast cancer model that exhibited a higher efficacy in the treatment than paclitaxel alone 
(Liu et al. 2008). Furthermore, CNTs’ functionalization act as vehicles for several therapeutics such 
as small-molecules, nucleic acids, and peptides, releasing them in several organs depending on the 
modifications of the CNTs, which can also be responsive to various stimuli (Bianco et al. 2005, 
Hasnain et al. 2018, Liu et al. 2009). In addition, SWNTs and MWNTs enter the cell by direct 
insertion or endocytosis via the cell membrane (Yetisgin et al. 2020). CNTs are widely studied for 
cancer, but they are also studied for avoiding atherosclerosis and crossing the brain-blood barrier 
(BBB) for neurological diseases (Flores et al. 2020, Gonzalez-Carter et al. 2019). 
8.2.5 Quantum dots
Quantum dots have a diameter between 2 and 10 nm with optical properties such as photoluminescence 
and absorbance, making QDs appropriate for image directed drug delivery purposes. They exhibit 
an emission in the NIR (< 650 nm) useful for biomedical images (Majumder and Minko 2020). 
Due to their elevated photo-stability, narrow emission, and bright fluorescence, they are employed 
for tracking drugs or agents inside the diseased tissue or cell (Bailey et al. 2004, Matea et al. 2017). 
Besides, achieving multiplex imaging, QDs with the identical light source can give distinct emission 
colors over a huge spectral range by only changing their core structure, composition, and size 
(Liu et al. 2010). Moreover, in medicine QDs are reviewed for bioimaging, sensors, and DDS 
since the exterior aqueous shell is employed for linking the QD with DNA, peptides, or proteins 
(Iga et al. 2007, Patra et al. 2018). Cai and colleagues (2016) created a responsive ZnO QDs to pH, 
loaded with DOX, and covered with HA and PEG for targeting HA-receptor CD44 cells. The QDs 
were secured in physiological pH and DOX was conjugated to PEG and once the QDs entered the 
TME, the acidic conditions discharged DOX, enhancing the anticancer activity (Cai et al. 2016). 
Finally, the diverse NPs described previously possess some advantages and limitations as explained 
in Table 3. 
9. Therapeutic applications of nanoparticles
Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents means successfully accumulating the payload in the target 
location. For this, the cargo needs to elude the immune system, NPs should stay for a small duration 
of time in the body, and deliver the drug. Approximately 20% of therapeutic DDS under clinical 
assessment or in clinics were fabricated for cancer, but nanotechnology provides numerous aids for 
treating chronic human diseases (Patra et al. 2018, Yetisgin et al. 2020). A short list of therapeutic 
NPs for treatments of several diseases approved by the FDA and European Medicine Agency is 
shown in Table 4. 
9.1 Autoimmune diseases
The two main diseases treated with DDS are acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA has an unknown cause accountable for the cartilage and bone 
destruction, affecting nearly 1% of the worldwide population. Therapies for RA need long-term 
procedures producing systemic side effects (Falconer et al. 2018). DDS release therapeutic agents to 
inflamed tissue targeted to the synovial membrane. An inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-α extensively Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 215

applied is certolizumab pegol (CZP). CZP combined with PEG increases the half-life and exhibits 
encouraging outcomes for long-term treatments (Lim et al. 2018). Likewise, liposomal and polymer 
NPs deliver a target-specific and continuous delivery of anti-HIV drugs for improving the efficacy of 
the therapies, thus reducing the systemic adverse effects (Herskovitz and Gendelman 2019). 
9.2 Cancer
Cancer is one of the biggest causes of death worldwide while chemotherapeutic drugs are the 
most used treatment for several types of cancer. Nevertheless, these drugs are deficient of aqueous 
solubility, are non-specific, and toxic to benign cells. Also, cells can become resistant to these drugs 
which is another important drawback of these drugs (Moorthi et al. 2011, Stavrovskaya 2000). DDS 
overcome these shortcomings by targeting the cancerous cell directly and delivering the payload 
in passive or active targeting at a continuous rate increasing the efficiency of the cargo (Mishra 
et al. 2010). The first DDS for cancer therapy was a PEGylated liposomal formulation of DOX, 
accomplishing a larger circulation period and avoiding the RES. The size was less than 120 nm, 
consequently, taking advantage of the EPR effect and gathering in the tumor area and reducing 
cardiotoxicity (Barenholz 2012). Furthermore, in cancer, theranostic NPs serve to track the location, 
identifying the stage, and diagnosing the disease plus providing a knowledgeable reaction for 
therapy (Chen et al. 2014). On the other hand, stimuli-sensitive NPs have also been employed like 
DOX-based temperature-responsive liposome called thermoDOX and is assessed in phase II breast 
trials and phase III hepatocellular carcinoma clinical trials (Majumder and Minko 2020).
9.3 Neurodegenerative diseases
Targeted distribution serves for several conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and 
cancer (Yetisgin et al. 2020). NDs are described through the progressive loss of neuron functions 
ultimately causing neuronal death. People with ND such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s 
disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have gradual loss of neurons resulting in symptoms 
related to dementia, memory, and movement (Yetisgin et al. 2020). The current strategies are blocked 
by the BBB restrictive formation. BBB has an elevated selective semipermeable membrane that 
allows restricted blood circulation in the brain and inhibits the entrance of almost all the molecules 
in circulation for keeping the homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) (Pardridge 2012). 
The restrictive formation of the BBB allows only a small number of therapeutic agents to get into 
the brain; thus, elevated doses are needed that leads to many inimical side effects. DDS are mainly 
dedicated to cross the BBB and deliver the drugs in the damaged area of the brain (Figure 15) 
(Wohlfart et al. 2012). Moreover, QDs, lipid-based NPs, and polymeric NPs permit the entrance 
of cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate to target the key pathological characteristic 
of AD amyloid-β by crossing the BBB and reducing the side-effects (Yetisgin et al. 2020). Also, a 216 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons occurs in PD and targeted delivery with liposomes 
or polymeric NPs of dopamine is a NP therapeutic approach for PD (Kulkarni et al. 2015). Finally, 
MS is accountable for motor neuronal damage in charge of voluntary muscle movements such 
as walking and talking and finally leading to respiratory failure. Loading riluzole, the only agent 
approved for therapy, into SLN enhances the release of the payload in the CNS (Bondì et al. 2010, 
Mazibuko et al. 2015). For a more detailed review concerning DDS involvement in BBB, Patel and 
Patel (2017) can be reviewed (Patel and Patel 2017).
9.4 Cardiovascular diseases
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) disturb the cardiovascular system, peripheral arteries, and vascular 
systems of kidney and brain. Despite the new approaches, heart failure affects many people 
worldwide and is one of the leading reasons of death (Neeland et al. 2018). DDS applied in CVD is 
more dedicated to targeted delivery and rising bioavailability for vascular restenosis (Yetisgin et al. 
2020). SLN and liposome exhibit better oral bioavailability and precise distribution of the cardio￾protective polyphenol resveratrol, which has limited water solubility and bioavailability (Neves 
et al. 2013). Polymeric NPs loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor is an encouraging 
method to enhance tissue remodeling in acute myocardial ischemic models (Formiga et al. 2010, 
Simón-Yarza et al. 2013).
9.5 Infectious diseases
Antimicrobial drugs are the main approach to treat infectious diseases, although sometimes the 
drugs become inadequate once the pathogens have acquired resistance. Therefore, the treatment 
has to increase the ratio and frequency of the drug, increasing the adverse effects and toxicity. 
Figure 15. The limiting construction of the brain blood barrier only allows a small quantity of drug to enter into the brain, 
therefore needing elevated doses having side effects. In addition, nanoparticles are mostly employed to cross the brain blood 
barrier and deliver the drugs in the injured regions of the brain.Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 217
In addition, numerous pathogens are in latent state or are active, but found intracellularly thus 
making them difficult to come in contact with the drug (Hillaireau and Couvreur 2009, Sendi and 
Proctor 2009). DDS overcome these drawbacks and produce formulations to attack several bacteria, 
parasites, fungi, or viruses (Yetisgin et al. 2020). These DDS can be organic or inorganic NPs. For 
example, the liposome formulation of ciprofloxacin LipoquinTM is suggested as a broad-spectrum 
Ab for infections in lungs and is manufactured for inhalation procedures for continued delivery 
of up to 24 h and elimination of the systemic effects of the elevated doses of Ab (Yetisgin et al. 
2020). Also, several liposomes as vehicles are approved by the FDA for treating fungal or protozoal 
infections, multiple myeloma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and lung problems (Patra et al. 2018). 
9.6 Ocular diseases
Polymeric micelles and liposomes are used for ocular treatments, specially targeting the payload 
to the proper eye compartment by increasing the corneal permeability and residence period on the 
tear film (Kulthe et al. 2012, Mandal et al. 2017, Weng et al. 2017). PLGA polymer combined with 
the drug pranoprofen considerably increases its ophthalmic release, and analgesic and local anti￾inflammatory effects of the agent (Abrego et al. 2015). In addition, lipid-based NPs were used to 
treat glaucoma with brimonidine (Ibrahim et al. 2015).
9.7 Pulmonary diseases 
Pulmonary lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are frequently lethal and without an efficient 
therapy for repairing lung function (Sugawara and Nikaido 2014, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Actual 
treatments are applied in lungs locally or systemically through inhalation of the drug. However, 
the active molecules of the drugs are in aerosol formula leading to elevated lung toxicity due to the 
burst delivery. Additionally, the size of the aerosol lowers the efficacy of the therapeutic agent since 
higher than 5 μm and lower than 1 μm cannot go through or remain in the respiratory tract or are 
suspended in the air and respired. DDS allows to increase the bioavailability of the cargo and its 
organized release, and lower the frequency of treatment and its dosage (Lim et al. 2016, Yhee et al. 
2016). Natural and synthetic polymers are extensively employed in nanomedicine preparations for 
lung inhalation. For example, PAMAM den were successfully applied for lung inhalation produced 
with the anti-asthma agent beclomethasone dipropionate (Nasr et al. 2014).
9.8 Regenerative therapy
Regenerative therapy centers on increasing regeneration and repair of tissues with biocompatible 
materials’ utilization by exploiting the natural mechanisms of the cell. One approach for regenerative 
treatments is with stem cell-based therapy (Yetisgin et al. 2020). The aim is to endorse bone 
regeneration with therapeutic NPs as natural or synthetic polymers, MNPs, and silica-based NPs. 
For instance, calcium-phosphate inorganic NPs are applied since they have similarities with the 
bone (Alves Cardoso et al. 2012, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Furthermore, releasing numerous growth 
factors by DDS promotes osteoblast for bone formation (Park et al. 2016). Natural and synthetic 
polymers’ NPs with anti-inflammatory drugs are transported into the infected target of large wounds 
blocking the inflammation (Gonçalves et al. 2015, Warabi et al. 2001). 
10. Limitations
Delivery of drugs with large dimensions has several drawbacks like reduced target specificity, 
solubility, bioavailability, and absorption, possible side effects, and instability (Patra et al. 2018). 218 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
DDS could overcome these disadvantages, but their design has some aspects that need to be reviewed 
and considered before the creation of NPs such as biodegradability, clearance or safer elimination 
after payload administration, biocompatibility, metabolism, and long-term toxicity (Raza et al. 
2019a, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Hence, manufacturing of NPs has to take into consideration the size 
and its possible relationship with toxicity and initiation of immune responses (Yetisgin et al. 2020). 
For example, smaller NPs enhance nucleus distribution of the agent, causing systemic problems 
at cellular level; polymeric NPs have several problems such as immunogenicity, biocompatibility, 
difficulties for scaling up, cytotoxicity, and organic solvents used for synthesis; and some NPs 
like den, MNP, micelles, and QDs have the tendency to agglomerate with other circulating NPs 
producing lower supply of the cargo; consequently, it is necessary to PEGylate these NPs for 
avoiding this problem (Chang et al. 2013, Yetisgin et al. 2020). Moreover, regarding responsive 
stimuli NPs, several downsides exist such as premature drug release, and non-targeted areas with 
similar characteristics as pH and oxidative stress could potentiate the delivery of the payload in off￾target regions (Raza et al. 2019a, Su and Kang 2020). Also, a better knowledge of the physiological 
environment of the diseased and healthy tissue could avoid the enzymatic destruction of the NPs on 
the route to arrive to the target location (Majumder and Minko 2020).
Likewise, administrative matters for achieving support and employing the DDS is an extra main 
holdup in the field (Raza et al. 2019a). Very few NPs succeed the trials and become accessible in the 
market and commercially for the people. This implies more revisions are needed about the toxicity, 
manufacture, and preparation (Yetisgin et al. 2020). For instance, more studies regarding the chronic 
toxicity, safety entrée of NPs into the cells, immune compatibility of NPs with macrophages, contact 
of NPs with blood components, and biocompatibility of a single component do not assure NPs’ safety 
and can provoke pro-inflammatory consequences, activation of complements, and coagulation. 
Consequently, more toxicity and in vivo safety evaluations are necessary in studies before clinical 
applications (Su and Kang 2020). Finally, large scale production is still limited due to little loading 
efficacy, purification, and identical production (D’Mello et al. 2017).
11. Conclusions 
In summary, drug delivery systems, especially NPs like lipid-based systems, polymeric systems, 
metallic and iron oxide NPs, silica-based NPs, carbon nanotubes, and quantum dots can help drugs 
overcome several limitations including poor biodistribution, non-selectivity, low bioavailability, 
unwanted adverse effects, poor specificity, and low effectiveness. Once the drugs are incorporated 
into the NPs, these DDS surfaces can be modified for active targeting and be guided to specific 
cells or damaged tissue and distribute the payload and avoid detection from the immune system. 
However, the NPs can also use the passive targeting by employing several characteristics the 
damaged tissue have such as EPR and pH levels. Furthermore, these NPs can be manufactured with 
stimuli-responsive polymers and take advantage of endogenous stimuli such as pH, temperature, 
enzyme, and redox or exogenous stimuli such as magnetic, ultrasound, light, and temperature. These 
stimuli control the direction of the NP to the target location and release the cargo from the NPs by 
reacting with the different stimuli. Some NPs can answer to a dual stimulus, either exogenous or 
endogenous, or mixture of both, increasing the target specificity and efficiency for drug delivery 
(An et al. 2016, Raza et al. 2019b). Zhang and co-workers (2018) display a tumor targeting micelle 
with double endogenous stimuli, pH and redox (Zhang et al. 2018). Additionally, You and colleagues 
(2018) created a tumor targeting NP with endogenous (redox) and exogenous (NIR) stimuli 
(You et al. 2018). Moreover, the future of DDS is leading to multi-therapeutic NPs for treating 
more than one disease. Currently, several NPs have been approved by the FDA and different NPs 
are designed for diverse diseases like ocular, infectious, pulmonary, autoimmune, cardiovascular, 
cancer, and neurodegenerative. Drug-delivery using Inorganic and Organic Nanoparticles 219

Engineering Immunity to Disease 
Using Nanotechnology
Michelle Z. Dion1,2,3 and Dr. Natalie Artzi2,3,4,5,*
1. Introduction
Disease and its associated pathologies result from the inability of the immune system to 
appropriately respond to pathogens, commensal microorganisms, and the body’s own cells (healthy 
or compromised). In the case of cancer and infectious disease, initial immune responses that can 
control disease burden may become dysregulated and ineffective as the disease evolves, resulting in 
immune escape and disease progression. For autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the immune 
system fails to sustain tolerance to self-antigens or commensal antigens, resulting in immune 
effector-mediated damage to healthy cells and tissue. Even appropriate immune responses can be 
detrimental to wound healing and to the outcome of therapeutic interventions, such as antibody 
therapy and transplantation. A common theme across diseases is that traditional clinical strategies 
use blunt approaches that do not address the underlying immunopathology of the disease. 
To address this gap, immunotherapies have become a pillar in the treatment of cancer and 
other diseases. Immunotherapy seeks to generate or restore a state where therapeutic immune 
responses can be achieved by strategically modulating one or more stages in the development of 
protective effector immunity or of immune tolerance to treat disease. This includes therapeutic 
strategies that engineer the phenotype and repertoire of T cells and B cells and that deliver cytokines, 
small molecules, and antibodies to alter immune cell signaling, activation, and trafficking. The 
immunotherapy arsenal consists of vaccines; immunomodulatory molecules such as cytokines and 
small molecule adjuvants; adoptive cell therapies; antibodies; and oncolytic viruses (Table 1). The 
strategies and components of this arsenal are continuously expanding and have been used to treat 
a variety of diseases. In cancer and infectious disease, effective immunotherapy requires that the 
proposed intervention results in the successful induction, maintenance, and resolution of a specific, 
high quality immune response to the diseased cells or pathogen at the desired site within the body 
that can overcome disease evolution and immune escape (Eppler and Jewell 2019). In hyperactive

and autoimmune diseases, the goal of immunotherapy is to dampen or control hyperactive immune 
responses to promote tolerance and tissue regeneration. In comparison to traditional therapies, 
immunotherapeutic approaches can offer numerous advantages including specificity (ability to 
generate immune responses specific to disease- or self-antigens while limiting bystander damage), 
durability (ability to generate robust responses with the capacity for immune memory that prevent 
disease occurrence or recurrence regardless of the time or location), and adaptability (the ability Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 231
of the immune system to alter its repertoire of cells and their specificity through epitope spreading 
or the like to protect against disease evolution) (Galluzzi et al. 2018). Immunotherapy can also 
generate immune responses with abscopal effects that allow them to control or eliminate disease at 
sites in the body disseminated from the treatment site, making it advantageous for the treatment of 
metastatic cancer. Because of these advantages, immunotherapeutic strategies are being explored 
across disease types and have garnered many regulatory body approvals in recent years (Dobosz 
and Dzieciatkowski 2019). 
Despite these successes, the clinical scope of immunotherapy remains limited. Current 
challenges to effective therapy include off-target toxicities, interpatient differences in efficacy and 
durability, expensive and complex manufacturing procedures, and insufficient control of disease 
immune escape (Galluzzi et al. 2018). Thus, strategies that provide more precise control over the 
timing, the location, and the context in which immunomodulatory signals are presented to specific 
immune cells and tissues have the potential to significantly improve immunotherapy outcomes 
by overcoming these challenges. Nanomaterials offer a highly tunable mechanism by which to 
address these challenges given their proven ability to alter the delivery profile of therapy across 
time and space to improve the safety and potency of therapies. Additionally, nanomaterials have 
novel mechanisms of action that can synergize with molecular and cellular immunotherapies. In 
this chapter, we briefly introduce foundational concepts in immunology to provide insight into 
how the immune system functions and the ways in which it can be modified to achieve improved 
outcomes in immunotherapy. We then discuss design considerations for developing nanomaterials 
for immunotherapy based on their range of tunable physiochemical and surface properties. Finally, 
we highlight how these features are being integrated into the design of nanomaterials to enable novel 
mechanisms of action to enhance the delivery, potency, and durability of molecular and cellular 
immunotherapies. 
2. Foundational concepts in immunotherapy
The immune system is composed of an expansive repertoire of organs, cells and molecular agents 
that interact through dynamic signaling pathways to initiate, maintain, and resolve immune function. 
The body relies on this intricate and dynamic system to protect against disease by recognizing 
and eliminating foreign pathogens and unhealthy cells while sparing healthy tissue. The ability 
of effector components of the immune system to differentiate between healthy and diseased host 
cells relies on the integration of surface and secreted molecule signaling between host and effector 
immune cells. Cells presenting self-antigen and expressing co-inhibitory molecules instruct the 
immune system not to attack, while those presenting foreign or disease antigens and expressing co￾stimulatory molecules prime the immune system for attack. Traditionally, immunity is divided into 
the innate and adaptive immune systems, which are differentiated by the timing of their response 
following pathogenic assault and their capacity to generate memory to encountered antigens 
(Abbas et al. 2018). The functions of the innate and adaptive immune system are bridged by the 
activity of specialized innate immune cells known as antigen-presenting cells. Innate and adaptive 
immunity work cooperatively to respond to and eliminate disease (Figure 1). In this section, you 
will be introduced to the foundational concepts underpinning innate and adaptive immunity and 
how these understandings are used to drive the design of efficacious immunotherapies in different 
disease states. We will provide background on the key molecules, cell types, organs, and responses 
involved in generating efficacious immune responses. This section will provide context for our later 
discussion of nanomaterial-based applications for immunotherapy in the proceeding sections.232 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Figure 1. The role of innate and adaptive immunity in the cancer immune cycle. The combined, coordinated action of innate 
and adaptive immunity allows for the discrimination between healthy and diseased cells or pathogenic agents. The cells of the 
innate immune system detect the pathogen directly through cell surface interactions or indirectly through damage associated 
molecular patterns released by dying or infected cells. Innate immune cells then can stimulate an adaptive immune response 
by presenting antigens-derived from the disease microenvironment to T cells in the lymph nodes. They can also carry out 
effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis to attempt to eliminate the pathogenic agent directly. Adaptive immune cells 
that are activated in the lymph nodes then enter the blood and traffic to the disease site, where they need to extravasate and 
infiltrate the disease microenvironment. Once there, T cells recognize their cognate antigen displayed on diseased cells and 
eliminate these cells. This creates additional antigens and DAMPs, restimulating the immune cycle until all disease has been 
eliminated or exhaustion and immune escape occurs. (Reprinted with permission from Demaria et al. (2019). Harnessing 
innate immunity in cancer therapy. Nature, 574(7776): 45–56.)
2.1 Innate immunity
The innate immune system is responsible for generating rapid responses to infectious agents and 
disease through the recognition of conserved molecular patterns and pathogen components, and 
generally does not develop immune memory within its cellular repertoire (Abbas et al. 2018). The Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 233
short-half life and limited proliferation of these cells enable their responses to be quickly resolved to 
prevent tissue damage from prolonged exposure to their effector activities (Eppler and Jewell 2019). 
The key cells of the innate immune system are macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, 
and natural killer cells. Innate immune cells circulate in the blood and are present in tissues as tissue￾resident cells to protect against infection and disease. Specialized innate immune cells known as 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which include macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), are highly 
phagocytic and continually sample their environment to surveil for pathogens. These cells detect 
pathogens using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns (PAMPs), which are conserved structural motifs or molecules common to bacteria and 
viruses that are not usually found in healthy human tissue. PRRs include toll-like receptors (TLRs) 
and stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) (among others) and sense a wide variety of 
microbial and viral products intracellularly and extracellularly including bacterial lipopeptides and 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), flagellin, and single-stranded and double-stranded DNA and RNA. 
In response to PAMPs, APCs become activated and secrete inflammatory cytokines to recruit 
additional immune cells to the site of disease. These cells can also express cytotoxic molecules to 
destroy pathogens or damaged tissue and can phagocytose or internalize diseased cells, pathogens, 
or debris for degradation (Figure 1). Importantly, antigen uptake also drives APC maturation and 
migration to secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and the lymph nodes, where adaptive 
immune cells (T cells and B cells) await APC activation to generate cytotoxic cellular and humoral 
immune responses. APCs must display the cognate antigen of the B cell or T cell (or the specific 
antigen that the T cell receptor (TCR) or B cell receptor (BCR) can recognize) to activate it. As a 
result, APCs, particularly DCs, bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. This process will 
be further discussed in the next section (Adaptive immunity). The innate immune system also 
contains cytotoxic cells called natural killer cells which are responsible for eliminating host cells 
that lack MHC-I expression (MHC-I is often downregulated by tumor cells and virally infected 
cells so that they can avoid killing by adaptive immune cells) (Demaria et al. 2019). Together, these 
capabilities allow innate immune cells to identify and eliminate pathogens and trigger inflammatory 
and adaptive immune responses. 
2.2 Adaptive immunity
In comparison to the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system responds more slowly to 
primary exposures (7–14 days) but can generate expansive immune cell repertoires upon antigen 
challenge that can develop into memory cells that can persist for extended periods of time, including 
through the life of a person (Abbas et al. 2018). Adaptive immune cells are generated and developed 
in the bone marrow and thymus before circulating to secondary lymphoid organs, such as the lymph 
nodes and spleen, for further activation and instruction by APCs. Because they require activation by 
APCs, adaptive immune cells are slower to respond to pathogens and disease than innate immune 
cells. The key adaptive immune system cells are T cells and B cells and their associated subtypes, 
each of which have different effector functions in response to antigen recognition. 
B cells recognize soluble or cell-surface-derived antigens and secrete antibodies, which are 
immune macromolecules capable of directly neutralizing pathogens and that mediate antibody￾dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Antibodies are involved in immune complement 
activation and play a critical role in the humoral response to vaccination as the titer, affinity, 
epitope specificity, valency, and effector mechanisms of the generated antibodies determine the 
immune system’s ability to neutralize pathogens (Clem 2011). To produce specific, long-lasting 
antibodies that protect against disease, B cells must undergo several processes. Class switching is 
one of these processes, which produces antibodies with different structural features, or classes, that 
enable a range of immunological functions required to clear pathogens. Another important process 
is affinity maturation, which is mediated by helper T cells (discussed in the next paragraph) and 234 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
occurs in specialized domains of the lymph nodes called germinal centers. In this process, B cells 
iteratively generate antibodies with higher affinity and selectivity for their target antigen. B cells 
in germinal centers can further differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells. Together, these 
processes ensure that a more potent and specific antibody repertoire with diverse effector functions 
is generated to neutralize infections. 
T cells complement the function of B cells by coordinating adaptive immune responses and 
executing cytotoxic response. T cells are mainly divided into CD4+ (helper T cell) and CD8+ (cytolytic 
T cell) subtypes. CD4+ T cells are largely responsible for orchestrating downstream responses 
and secrete cytokines that mediate their effector functions. They are critical in the phagocytic 
elimination of microbes by macrophages, in activating other leukocytes such as neutrophils and 
eosinophils, and in the proliferation and differentiation of other T cells and B cells (Tay et al. 2020). 
They respond primarily to extracellular pathogens and are activated by antigens presented on major 
histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) molecules on APCs. In contrast, CD8+ T cells are activated 
by antigens presented on MHC-I molecules. They are primarily responsible for killing infected 
or diseased (tumor) cells that display foreign antigens and for eliminating intracellular pathogens 
through the release of granules following target cell engagement (Waldman et al. 2020). Certain DC 
subsets can load exogenous antigen peptides on MHC-I and MHC-II complexes through a process 
known as cross-presentation, priming antigen-specific immune responses in both CD4 and CD8 
T cells. Cross-presentation is crucial in both mounting an immune response against cancer and 
infectious diseases, as well as in controlling immune reactivity and inducing tolerogenic responses 
(Abbas et al. 2018). This allows for both intracellular and extracellular disease antigens to be 
presented to immune cells, giving access to a broader range of epitopes.
The interactions between adaptive immune cells and APCs, particularly DCs, are critically 
important to the proper generation and regulation of adaptive immune responses and rely on the 
presence of three signals. DCs present antigens to T cells using MHC-I and MHC-II complexes 
(signal 1), with the outcome of antigen recognition being determined by the nature of the expressed 
co-receptors and cytokines (signals 2 and 3) (Figure 2). The engagement of co-stimulatory or co￾inhibitory molecules at the immune synapse during antigen presentation governs the type, specificity, 
and duration of the immune response (Friedl et al. 2005). Secreted cytokines are considered the third 
signal involved in immune synapse signaling and affect the ability of adaptive immune cells to 
sustain effector functions. This is a mechanism of immune tolerance where the context of antigen 
presentation (whether with the expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokines or inhibitory 
co-receptors and cytokines) licenses the functional activity of T cells, making this interaction a 
critical target in immunotherapy. This complements central tolerance, which occurs during T cell 
development, to limit self-reactivity to prevent the development of autoimmune diseases. APC 
negative feedback signaling mechanisms can also use this process to restrain immune responses to 
prevent tissue damage from chronic immune activation, as is seen in cancer (Peng et al. 2020, Oh 
et al. 2020). To explain further, APCs continually uptake self-antigens during immunosurveillance 
but are unable to activate adaptive immune cells due to low levels of antigen presentation and the 
lack of immunostimulatory cue expression. When an APC senses danger (PAMPs) in addition to 
antigen, it will express co-stimulatory surface molecules and cytokines that trigger T cell activation 
via integration of the surface exposed and soluble inflammatory cues. The presentation of antigen to 
T cells concurrently with tolerogenic signals or in the chronic absence of costimulatory signals can 
result in the production of T regulatory cells (Tregs), in T cell anergy (a functionally inactive, non￾proliferative, nonresponsive state), or in T cell deletion (Friedl et al. 2005). Tregs play an important 
role in immune tolerance as they suppress the activation and effector functions of other T cells 
(Abbas et al. 2018). As a result, Tregs have significant influence over the maintenance and duration 
of immune responses to tumors and to self-antigens in autoimmune disease (Friedl et al. 2005, 
Cifuentes-Rius et al. 2020). Tregs can amplify tolerogenic responses in bystander immune cells 
through the production of immunosuppressive cytokines. Due to the impact of these processes on Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 235
the generation of protective immunity or of immune tolerance, the molecules, cells, tissues, and 
processes involved in immune synapse interactions are powerful targets for immunotherapeutic 
modulation (Figure 3). Following immune synapse signaling, activated T cells undergo rapid 
proliferation, exponentially expanding the availability of antigen-specific effector cells. These cells 
then enter the circulation and traffic to sites of disease following chemokine gradients generated 
by innate immune cells. If the activated T cell recognizes its antigen, it will carry out its effector 
mechanisms to induce elimination of the pathogenic agent or cell. 
Together, B cells and T cells represent a diverse repertoire of cells that execute highly specific 
and potent immune responses using a range of effector mechanisms. The cooperative, multi￾component processes required to generate and regulate effective adaptive immune responses 
illustrate the complexity of this system. 
2.3 The influence of non-immune components on immune responses
In addition to modulating the functions and components of the immune system discussed above, 
immunotherapy strategies can also modify the activity and composition of non-immune components, 
such as diseased cells, stromal tissue, the vasculature, and the microbiome. Diseased cells, such as 
cancer cells, are eliminated by the immune system based on their susceptibility to immune cell 
killing and recognition (antigen expression) through a process known as immunoediting (Dunn 
et al. 2004). This places a negative selection pressure on diseased cells that promotes the growth and 
evolution of clones or variants that can escape the immune system. Mechanisms of immune evasion 
include subversion of the immune response by expression of surface or secreted immune regulatory 
molecules such as PD-L1, the loss of immunogenic antigen expression, and the downregulation of 
Figure 2. The Immune Synapse. The interactions between soluble proteins and cell surface receptors on T cells and antigen￾presenting cells govern the outcome of T cell activation. The three signals that antigen-presenting cells can give to T cells 
are: (1) the antigen-MHC complex; (2) co-stimulatory receptors; (3) immuno-instructive cytokines. (Adapted from “Three 
Signals Required for T Cell Activation”, by BioRender.com (2021). Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender￾templates.)236 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

expression of antigen-presenting proteins, such as MHC molecules (Galluzzi et al. 2018). This can 
result in a rapid increase in disease burden and disease dissemination, overwhelming the immune 
system and causing extensive tissue damage. The creation of an immunosuppressive disease 
microenvironment by these cells can further inhibit the induction of immunity by immunotherapy 
or the activity and durability of the generated response. 
Bystander cells and tissues of the body are also gaining recognition as significant influencers 
of immunity including stromal cells and the gut microbiome (Krausgruber et al. 2020, Sepich￾Poore et al. 2021). Non-immune, non-disease microenvironment components, such as the blood and 
lymphatic vasculatures, stromal cells, nerve cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), can influence 
the efficacy of immunotherapy (Galluzzi et al. 2018). The integrity of the blood vasculature and the 
molecular expression profile of the blood vasculature influences the trafficking of immune cells 
and therapy to the disease site. The blood vasculature also regulates the access of oxygen and key 
nutrients to immune cells and others in the disease microenvironment. The lymphatic vasculature, 
or lymphatics, provide a channel for activated antigen-presenting cells to leave peripheral tissues 
and traffic to the local draining lymph nodes to prime T cells. Macromolecules, such as antigens, 
pathogens, and cytokines, can also be transported to the lymph nodes from peripheral tissues via 
the lymph, which can further induce adaptive immune cell responses in the lymph nodes. Within 
the microenvironment, the composition and density of the extracellular matrix can influence the 
penetration of immune cells and nanoparticle therapy in addition to the migration and spread 
of diseased cells. Finally, recent work has shown that the gut microbiome, or the collection of 
microorganisms that live in the human digestive tract, and its metabolites can modulate the immune 
system and alter the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer and other diseases (Round and Mazmanian
2009, Gopalakrishnan et al. 2017, Matson et al. 2018, Halfvarson et al. 2017).
While incomplete, this is illustrative of the numerous points of potential intervention beyond 
components of the immune system for nanotechnology-mediated immunotherapy. Each disease 
will have unique features of its cells, microenvironment, baseline immune response, and systemic 
sequalae that will influence the quality of the incited immune response to targeted interventions. 
This provides extensive opportunities to employ new and innovative nanotechnology-based 
immunotherapy approaches as discussed in the following section. 
3. Designing nanomaterials for immunotherapy
For immunotherapy to be successful, it needs to be able to induce a timely response at specific 
tissues with sufficient breadth, specificity, and durability to eliminate disease in cancer and 
infectious disease or to control aberrantly activated effector immune mechanisms in autoimmune 
and inflammatory diseases (Irvine and Dane 2020, Cifuentes-Rius et al. 2020). Furthermore, the 
immunotherapeutic strategy needs to be dynamic, capable of countering disease evolution and 
preventing disease immune escape and recurrence. As a result, multi-faceted approaches requiring 
dynamic control over the spatiotemporal kinetics of combination therapies are likely required to 
balance durable immunotherapeutic efficacy with safety. Given their tunability, nanomedicines offer 
a unique opportunity to enable these features for immunotherapy without inducing toxicities. 
Nanomaterials have been studied extensively for the treatment of disease because of their 
ability to alter the biodistribution, tissue accumulation, and cell uptake profiles of therapy by passive 
and active mechanisms; to prevent drug degradation; to enable unique combination therapies by 
reducing toxicities; and to control the temporal release of therapy by enabling controlled, pulsatile, 
or stimuli-responsive release (Goldberg 2019, Song et al. 2019, Irvine and Dane 2020, Gong et al. 
2021). These mechanisms of action are enabled by the highly tunable features of nanomedicines, 
such as their modifiable physiochemical properties and nano-biological surface interfaces (Eppler 
and Jewell 2019). These properties are often referred to as the nanotechnology toolbox (Song et al. 238 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
2019, Gong et al. 2021) and encompass approaches such as surface, size, shape, and stiffness 
modification; controlled, activatable, and/or sequential release; and selection of nanomaterial 
type and structure (Figure 4). This toolbox is continually expanding to include new functions 
and enable new therapeutic strategies. In addition to the mechanisms previously discussed, new 
strategies are emerging that allow for nanomedicines to overcome physiological barriers and to 
recapitulate complex cell-cell interactions more effectively (Eppler and Jewell 2019, Gong et 
al. 2021). Nanomaterials have also given us more sophisticated control over the in vivo delivery 
and activity of genetic, molecular, and cell engineering therapies that are increasingly expanding 
our ability to engineer biology for therapeutic purposes (Ditto et al. 2009, Shim and Kwon 2012, 
Tong et al. 2019). Finally, nanomaterials are enhancing our ability to monitor disease and host 
responses to therapy in vivo across time and spatial scales (Zhong et al. 2019). 
The following section will provide an overview of considerations for designing nanomaterials 
for immunotherapy before we describe specific examples of studies that used nanomaterials to 
enable novel immunotherapeutic applications in the final sections of this chapter. From this section, 
you will understand the influence of material properties on the delivery and therapeutic performance 
of immunotherapeutic nanomedicines. Further, this section is meant to provide an overview of the 
immuno-supportive mechanisms of action associated with each property or feature. More extensive 
discussions of these fundamental mechanisms can be found in the literature (Look et al. 2010, 
Figure 4. The Tunable Properties of Nanomaterials. Nanomaterials have highly tunable properties that can be used to alter 
the drug delivery (biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, cell uptake profile, etc.) and therapeutic (efficacy, immune profiling) 
profiles of immunotherapy. These properties include physiochemical properties (material choice, particle structure, size, 
shape, elasticity); surface properties (charge; chemistry; coatings; targeting ligands-multivalency, density, types); release 
properties (sustained; stimuli-responsive; programmable); and their delivery context (number of particles; route of 
administration; timing of administration; combinations). (Adapted from Song, W., Anselmo, A. C., & Huang, L. (2019).

3.1 Physiochemical properties
The physiochemical properties of nanoparticles include material type, size, shape, deformability, and 
particle structure. Each of these features can be designed to influence the resultant bioavailability, 
biodistribution, cell uptake, and immune response profiles of the nanomedicine. While the general 
implications of each feature are discussed, it should be noted that the incited immune responses 
and delivery profiles associated with a given immunotherapeutic nanomedicine result from the 
combined features of the particle and can also be influenced by the given application. 
3.1.1 Material type and particle structure
Given its central role in the formation of nanoparticles and their structure, material type has a 
significant influence over the physiochemical properties and biological profiles (distribution, 
pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, invoked immune responses) of the nanoparticle. Further, 
while materials were previously thought to be immunologically inert, recent studies have illustrated 
that materials can generate a range of immunomodulatory effects with the invoked responses varying 
greatly in their type, duration, and magnitude depending on the context of the studied response 
(Table 2; Shields et al. 2019). The immunomodulatory properties of nanoparticle materials have 
inspired interest in using these materials in many novel applications including as drug-free 
immunotherapies (Casey et al. 2019, Saito et al. 2019) and as adjuvants in minimalist nanovaccines 
(Luo et al. 2017). Further, recent advances in the computational design of programmable biological 
materials have inspired the use of immunotherapies, such as antibodies, proteins, and DNA or RNA 
adjuvants, as the building blocks of carrier-free or polymer-free nanoparticles (King et al. 2014, 
Zhang et al. 2014, Divine et al. 2021). These applications are discussed in greater detail in the 
subsection of this chapter, Direct Immunomodulation through Novel Material Design. 
Beyond its immunomodulatory effects, material type determines different nanomaterial 
mechanisms of action that can synergize with immunotherapy. For example, certain materials, such 
as inorganic materials and metal-organic frameworks, can act as radiosensitizers or photothermal 
sensitizers and/or are magnetic, and, as a result, can enhance immunogenic cell death by localizing 
and potentiating treatment with external energy sources (Irvine and Dane 2020). These properties can 
also allow these materials to release cargo in response to stimuli or home to specific environments and 
be retained there when different physical fields are applied (Sanz-Ortega et al. 2019). This endows 
nanomaterial-based immunotherapy with higher delivery specificity than free immunotherapies. 
Magnetic properties of materials have also been used to induce surface receptor clustering on 
nanoparticles to mimic the dynamics of surface proteins and receptors found at immunological 
synapses to enhance immune signaling with T cells and the resultant activation and proliferation 
of these cells (Kosmides et al. 2018). These properties of material type enable these materials 
to act imaging contrast agents. For example, Zhong et al. recently used erbium-based rare-earth 
nanoparticles as near-infrared-IIb molecular imaging probes to study the cellular responses of the 
tumor microenvironment and secondary lymphoid organs to immunotherapy in live animals (Zhong 
et al. 2019). As the development of efficacious immune responses is reliant on the coordinated 
spatiotemporal modification of immune cells, this nanoparticle material-based property can provide 
critical information about the biological action of therapies driving patient responses in real-time by 
allowing scientists and clinicians to monitor immune cell migration and activation across time and 
correlate it with therapeutic outcomes, delivery profiles, and treatment schedules. Materials based 
on quantum dots (Bruns et al. 2017) and carbon nanotubes (Fadel and Fahmy 2014), among others, 
can also serve as theranostic particles. Additionally, material type can influence the therapy’s release 240 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
kinetics from the particle and the nanoparticle’s biodegradation properties. A common example 
is the use of polyester-based nanoparticles to control drug release by altering polymer properties 
that affect its degradation by esterase-mediated hydrolysis, such as polymer chain length/molecular 
weight, polymer hydrophobicity, and end-capping (Makadia and Siegel 2011). Polymer architecture 
and chemistry can also influence the material’s ability to deliver cargo, such as genetic materials and 
small molecular innate immune receptor agonists, intracellularly (Irvine and Dane 2020). Given the 
emergence of therapeutic genetic engineering technologies that can engineer biology to treat disease 
with molecular and cellular precision, an understanding of the impact of nanomaterial properties on 
organ-specific, cell type-specific, and subcellular delivery and trafficking is of critical interest for 
the safe and effective implementation of these therapies in patients. 
Particle material also dictates particle chemistry and therefore particle structure. Particle structure 
impacts numerous drug delivery parameters including the types of therapies that can be delivered, 
the number and amount of therapies that can be loaded, and the way these therapies are presented 
to the immune system or body. Core-shell particles, for example, have multiple compartments that 
can enable the encapsulation of therapy into their core, incorporation of therapy into their shells, 
or conjugation or absorption of therapy to their surface. This enables the delivery of therapies with 
divergent properties, such as peptide antigens and some small molecule adjuvants, to the same cell 
or tissue (Irvine and Dane 2020). Particle structure also impacts the nature (chemistry, surface area, 
etc.) of the nanomaterial-biological interface and the biological stability or durability of the particle. 
In one example, Moon et al. engineered interbilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles (ICMVs) 
to create lipid drug carriers that exhibit enhanced extracellular stability compared to multilamellar 
vesicles and liposomes but that degraded rapidly in response to high concentrations of lipases 
intracellularly (Moon et al. 2011). When used to co-entrap antigens and an immunostimulatory 
adjuvant, the structural properties of ICMVs generated enhanced antibody titers in comparison 
to MLVs and liposomes and resulted in increased antigen-specific humoral and T cell responses 
following repeat administration, providing a distinct advantage over viral-based vaccine vectors. 
While non-exhaustive, these studies highlight the myriad of ways material type and particle 
structure can impact the design of nanoparticle immunotherapies and their applications and can 
result in distinct synergistic mechanisms of action. 
3.1.2 Size
Because many biological barriers have size-dependent permeability, a nanoparticle’s size has a 
significant impact on its biological transport, and therefore its ability to reach different subcellular, 
cellular, and tissue immune compartments. One of the most common barriers to nanoparticle 
delivery is the vascular endothelium. The ability of nanoparticles to cross endothelial barriers is 
dependent on both active and passive transport mechanisms and the physiology and pathophysiology 
of the vasculature. The physiology, such as the presence of fenestrations and the size of cell-cell 
junctions, of the tissue-associated vasculature and its alteration in disease dictates its permeability 
to nanomedicines and the design of nanoparticle properties that can enable efficient extravasation 
from the blood (Poon et al. 2020). For example, nanoparticles have been thought to take advantage 
of a passive transport phenomena specific to tumor vasculature pathophysiology (the Enhanced 
Permeability and Retention effect or EPR) by which long-circulating nanoparticles leverage 
increased fluid leakage from poorly formed vasculature to enter the tumor tissue (Prabhakar et al. 
2013). While the clinical applicability of the EPR is the focus of intense debate, it is illustrative of 
how physiological and pathophysiological features of biological barriers can influence the design 
of nanoparticle size. Similar design considerations can be drawn for surface modification, such as 
targeting moieties, that can take advantage of differential surface receptor expression by diseased 
vasculature to enable active transport effects. Nanoparticle size can also impact the particle’s ability 
to transport through the tissue stroma, which is composed of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 241
connective tissue cells (Chen et al. 2019). Components of the ECM include proteoglycans and 
fibrous proteins. The composition and density of the ECM can vary between tissues and disease 
states, which can alter the pore size and steric hindrances within this matrix, affecting the diffusion 
of nanoparticles of different sizes and charges (Netti et al. 2000). This can impact the ability of 
nanoparticles to reach their targeted cell types. At a cellular level, size impacts the nanoparticle 
cell internalization method, with particles < 100 nm in diameter being preferentially internalized 
by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while larger particles require phagocytosis or micropinocytosis 
(Jiang et al. 2008). Nanoparticle shape can also influence these processes. 
In immunotherapy applications, size has a critical influence on nanoparticle delivery to the 
lymph nodes and lymphatic trafficking (Schudel et al. 2019). Nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm in 
diameter selectively accumulate in draining lymph nodes whereas larger particles rely on migratory 
DC-dependent transport of particles to the draining lymph nodes to incite an immune response 
(Reddy et al. 2007, Liu et al. 2014). As a result, the direct lymph node processing of smaller particles 
could lead to more rapid and enhanced activation of cellular and humoral immune responses than 
larger particles that are dependent on cell migration to the lymph nodes. Furthermore, nanoparticle 
size can dictate particle access to different immune cells within the lymph nodes as the reticular 
network restricts the access of materials in the lymph from reaching the paracortex in a size￾dependent fashion (Schudel et al. 2019). This can influence the immune response generated due 
to nanoparticle association with different lymph node immune cell populations. For example, 
nanoparticles that were similar in size to viruses were found to predominantly interact with B cells 
within the lymph nodes (Manolova et al. 2008). Therefore, immunotherapy nanomedicines that 
target interactions or processes occurring in specific subregions of the lymph node should include 
size optimization in their design strategy. Specific strategies that have been used to target the lymph 
nodes and its subregions are discussed further in this chapter’s subsection, Targeting Tissues that 
Regulate Immunity.
In summary, nanoparticle size has a major influence over the particle biodistribution and 
transport kinetics, including in critical immune infrastructure like the lymphatics and lymph nodes. 
Nanoparticle size also contributes to particle geometry, including surface area and volume, which 
impact cell uptake, molecular and cellular interactions, tolerability, and the amount of therapy 
loaded. 
3.1.3 Shape
Like size, nanoparticle shape has a significant influence over the nanoparticle’s biological 
transport, biodistribution, and cell interactions. Particle shape can influence the surface area of 
the particle for a given volume, which can impact the adhesion dynamics of the particle due to 
the formation and maintenance of multivalent interactions with cell surface proteins (targeting, 
uptake) and circulating proteins (protein corona formation) (Kapate et al. 2021). Nanoparticle 
shape influences the fluid flow dynamics of particles within biological fluids, like the blood. In the 
blood vasculature, nanoparticles with non-spherical shapes can drift because of their asymmetry, 
which influences particle margination and, as a result, particle plasma half-life and biodistribution 
(Tan et al. 2012). Nanoparticle shape also influences the cell-particle interaction dynamics. Different 
types of innate immune cells demonstrate preferential nanoparticle uptake that is shape-dependent, 
with spherical nanoparticles being more preferentially taken up by macrophages and rod- and disk￾shaped particles being more preferentially internalized by neutrophils (Safari et al. 2020). This is 
influenced by the internalization mechanisms of the cell. Non-phagocytic cells, such as endothelial 
and epithelial cells, use different mechanisms to uptake extracellular materials, such as endocytosis 
and pinocytosis (Kapate et al. 2021). Particles with lager aspect ratios exhibited higher uptake 
rates and improved cytosolic drug delivery in these cells (Parakhonskiy et al. 2015). Importantly, 
the shape-dependent difference in macrophage phagocytosis also impacts the biodistribution of 242 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
these particles as it reduces the liver clearance rate of non-spherical particles from circulation in 
comparison to spherical particles, enhancing their bioavailability to other organs (Decuzzi et al. 
2010, Arnida et al. 2011). Non-spherical particles also have less lung alveolar macrophage uptake, 
which was shown to reduce adverse nanoparticle-mediated cardiopulmonary reactions because 
of delayed particle recognition following intravenous administration in pigs (Wibroe et al. 2017). 
Following cell internalization, nanoparticle shape can also influence intracellular trafficking, as 
non-spherical particles were shown to increase nanoparticle import through the nuclear envelope, 
an important consideration for genetic cargo (Hinde et al. 2016). Finally, shape is known to impact 
the immune response to nanoparticles. Tazaki et al. found that gold nanoparticles with different 
shapes (sphere, rod, cubic) generated different APC cytokine secretion profiles and antibody titers 
following vaccination in mice (Tazaki et al. 2018). In a separate study, Kumar et al. demonstrated 
that antigen-conjugated spherical polystyrene particles generated an antigen-specific immune 
response that was biased towards Th1 with a lower IgG1/IgG2a antibody ratio while the rod-shaped 
particles’ response was biased towards Th2 and had a higher IgG1/IgG2a antibody ratio (Kumar 
et al. 2015). In summary, nanoparticle shape has a significant influence over the fluid flow transport 
and cell-interaction dynamics of nanoparticles that can mediate shape-dependent biodistribution and 
immune activation profiles. 
3.1.4 Elasticity
The impact of nanoparticle elasticity is not as well studied as the other nanoparticle physiochemical 
properties as it is more difficult to modulate (in isolation) across particle types. Elastic modulation 
is most often achieved by changing the particle crosslinking densities in gel-like particles. A study 
by Guo et al. examined the role of elasticity in nanolipogel particle uptake by different cell types 
and found that softer nanoparticles accumulated more in tumors, compared to their less deformable 
counterparts which accumulated in the liver (Guo et al. 2018). This resulted from an elasticity￾dependent shift in particle internalization pathways where softer particles were able to use more 
energy-efficient fusion mechanisms and harder particles used endocytosis. Cell membranes can 
less efficiently wrap softer nanoparticles as these particles can deform and prevent the formation of 
adequate attachments, reducing cell internalization (Anselmo and Mitragotri 2017). This is further 
exacerbated if the particle has a large particle edge with which the cell is interacting. Similarly, 
forces driving ligand-receptor interactions between nanoparticles and cells can cause more 
significant deformation of softer particles, reducing their cell binding (Hui et al. 2020). Anselmo 
et al. demonstrated similar results for polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel nanoparticles and showed 
that harder nanoparticles are more rapidly and more frequently phagocytosed by immune cells 
(Anselmo et al. 2015). Together, this drives the reduced uptake of softer particles by circulating 
immune cells and liver macrophages in vivo, increasing their blood circulation time and tissue 
targeting potential. A nanoparticle’s deformability can also influence its ability to squeeze between 
cell-cell gaps and through biological matrices, such as during extravasation (Song et al. 2021). This 
feature could be used to mediate enhanced delivery if the particle can squeeze through tight junctions 
and reform without losing its cargo. These studies demonstrate that nanoparticle biodistribution, 
pharmacokinetics, cell uptake, and cell surface interactions can be optimized by tuning the particle’s 
elasticity.
3.2 Surface chemistry and surface modifications
Nanoparticles interact with many different fluids, molecules, cells, and tissue structures during their 
time in the body. These interactions are referred to as nanomaterial-biological interactions and they 
dictate many of the therapeutic outcomes of nanomedicines (Poon et al. 2020). The nanoparticle 
surface is the main interface of interaction between nanomaterials and the body’s components. As a Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 243
result, numerous studies have focused on engineering the particle surface by altering its chemistry, 
coating it with biological membranes, and modifying it with targeting ligands to achieve desired 
molecular and cellular interactions and biodistribution profiles. 
Surface properties can impact the adsorption of proteins from biological fluids onto the 
nanoparticle, influencing the type, diversity, and conformation of proteins within the protein corona 
and its associated biological and immune responses (Lundqvist et al. 2008). The characteristics 
of the protein corona can influence the biodistribution of the nanoparticle, based on the particle’s 
interaction with macrophages in the liver, APCs in the spleen, and other components of the 
reticuloendothelial system (Poon et al. 2020). For example, hydrophilic and inert coatings, such as 
poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) coatings, are frequently used to reduce the formation of protein coronas 
on nanoparticle surfaces, which can minimize nanoparticle recognition by macrophages and other 
phagocytes (Stolnik et al. 1994). Despite these coatings, however, protein coronas generally still 
form and become a new interface through which the nanoparticles interact with cells and tissues, 
ultimately impacting their in vivo fate (cell uptake, biodistribution, immune response) (Vincent et al. 
2021). The protein corona may also influence the efficacy of other surface modification approaches, 
such as targeting moieties (Mirshafiee et al. 2013, Salvati et al. 2013). Recent studies have shown 
that surface chemistry can mediate the adsorption of complement proteins and of albumin, as well 
as the folding state of these adsorbed proteins, which influenced particle opsonization, uptake by 
innate immune cells, and clearance (Moghimi and Szebeni 2003, Chen et al. 2016, Nguyen and 
Lee 2017, Ren et al. 2019, Vincent et al. 2021). Further, a recent study showed that variances in 
plasma composition between patients can cause differences in the formed protein coronas and the 
resultant nanoparticle-immune cell interaction profiles (Ju et al. 2020). As a result, strategies that 
can engineer the composition of the protein corona in situ or ex vivo to achieve specific nanoparticle 
properties are of intense interest. 
The propensity of nanoparticles to form protein coronas has been leveraged for antigen capture 
and has been widely used in in situ vaccination strategies as described later in this chapter. In 
a seminal study, Min et al. leveraged this propensity of nanoparticles to form protein coronas in 
biological fluids to engineer nanoparticles that, when injected intratumorally, efficiently captured 
tumor-associated antigens released by radiation therapy and enhanced the presentation of these 
antigens by APCs (Min et al. 2017). The particles’ surface chemistry impacted the composition and 
diversity of the formed protein corona, whereas unmodified particles and DOTAP nanoparticles 
captured the widest variety of proteins, including cancer neoantigens and DAMPs. When combined 
with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, this strategy improved survival and tumor control in 
both primary treated and metastatic untreated lesions via the abscopal effect. Overall, this study 
demonstrated a new mechanism by which nanoparticle surface chemistry can influence protein 
corona characteristics to enhance the combination of standard therapies (like chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy) with immunotherapy and augment in situ vaccination strategies. 
While not directly probing the mechanism of the nano-biological interactions, other studies 
have reported that particle surface charge can influence cell uptake propensity and immune cell 
activation, with cationic particles demonstrating higher uptake and being more inflammatory than 
anionic particles (He et al. 2010, Fromen et al. 2016). Kranz et al. found that negatively charged 
lipid nanoparticles could enhance the delivery efficiency of RNA to lymphoid organs and APCs, 
particularly splenic dendritic cells, following intravenous administration (Kranz et al. 2016). In 
a separate study, Cheng et al. showed that lipid nanoparticles could be targeted to select organs 
(besides the liver) and cells by altering the amount and charge of different lipid “SORT” molecules, 
which influenced the generated particles’ global pKa (Cheng et al. 2021). While not exhaustive, 
these examples illustrate how nanoparticle surface properties can influence particle biodistribution, 
pharmacokinetics, and cell interactions. 
To achieve biological interactions with high specificity and high affinity, active targeting 
agents, such as antibodies, antibody fragments, ligands, DNA aptamers, and peptides, can be 244 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
chemically conjugated or indirectly bound to the surface of the nanoparticle (Bertrand et al. 2014). 
In immunotherapy, this is an attractive approach because many immune cell types and activation 
states are classified based on surface marker expression, which can be targeted by these molecules to 
enhance cell and activation state delivery selectivity. Numerous studies have used this functionality 
to target nanoparticles to immune cells in vivo (Ramishetti et al. 2015, Schmid et al. 2017, Smith et 
al. 2017, Kedmi et al. 2018, Veiga et al. 2018, Zhang et al. 2019a). Further, antibodies, which are 
commonly used targeting agents because of their high specificity and affinity, can also be engineered 
to interact with innate immune surface receptors through their Fc regions, resulting in specific effector 
functions. Molecular engineering approaches can be further appropriated to generate targeting agents 
with specific structures and activities and that can leverage different conjugation chemistries. The 
number of moieties, their distribution, and their density on the particle surface impacts the observed 
binding affinity and selectivity of the nanoparticle construct for its targeted moiety (Bertrand 
et al. 2014, Tjandra and Thordarson 2019). Depending on the properties of the targeting agent, these 
features can also affect the duration and magnitude of the invoked signaling cascade, which can 
be important if the agent is also being used for immune modulation or other therapeutic purposes. 
However, these interactions are ligand-target pair specific as the conformational binding dynamics 
of different moieties can influence the receptor antagonism, agonism, or neutral responses. 
 Multivalency is used to enhance the discrimination of active targeting agents for different 
cell types through super-selectivity (Tjandra and Thordarson 2019). Multivalent binding is the 
formation of multiple bonds between nanoparticle surface molecules and their receptors on the 
target cell or biological entity. Super-selectivity is the ability of multivalent constructs to obtain near 
on-off binding to their targets expressing a certain number of receptors compared to monovalent 
ones (Liu et al. 2020). This, in theory, allows cancer cells to be discriminated from healthy cells 
when nanoparticles are used to target receptors overexpressed by cancer cells (Carlson et al. 
2007). However, studies have suggested that the application of this approach in the in vivo setting 
is complex, with scavenger endothelial cells and macrophages acting as cellular reservoirs for 
nanoparticles (Miller et al. 2015, Hayashi et al. 2020) and macrophages taking up more cancer 
cell targeted nanoparticles than tumor cells (Turk et al. 2004). Further, a study by Korangath et al. 
suggests that antibody-targeted nanoparticle retention in immunocompetent mice is a function of 
nanoparticle-immune cell interactions rather than antibody-cell receptor interactions (Korangath 
et al. 2020). A more thorough study of the influence of targeting molecule characteristics (Fc type, 
ligand type, multivalency), receptor type, conjugation chemistry and specificity, and nanoparticle 
properties (size, material type) is needed before this can be drawn as a general conclusion 
regarding nanoparticle active targeting. While macrophage phagocytosis can be exploited based 
on the physiochemical properties of the particle, as previously discussed, these findings suggest 
that the nanotechnology-biological interactions regarding receptor-targeting (and others) need to 
be more carefully investigated. Recently, using statistical mechanical modeling and experimental 
trials, Liu et al. described the combinatorial entropy-related phenomena of range selectivity where, 
under certain conditions, multivalent entities bind only to other entities that have a receptor density 
within a given span (Liu et al. 2020) (Of note, this phenomenon can also occur for monovalent 
constructs, but it is described here given its importance to understanding multivalent biological 
interactions). The authors suggested that, biologically, this phenomenon could be used by cells to 
unbind nanoparticle constructs from their surface receptors by increasing the number of receptors 
available or to avoid recognition by other cell types. Together, these studies illustrate the need to 
carefully study the intricacies of nanotechnology-biological interactions, including those governing 
active targeting. Beyond cell type targeting, surface modification with biologically active agents can 
be used to control the presentation, diversity, and valency of immunomodulatory signals presented 
to immune cells by nanomedicines (Irvine and Dane 2020). This concept and its applications are 
discussed further later in this chapter (Improved immune signaling and immune interactions using 
multivalency).Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 245
Coating nanoparticles with cell membranes or creating nanoparticles from cell membrane￾derived vesicles is another method to appropriate bioderived entities to recapitulate complex 
biological interactions. In comparison to active targeting strategies, these strategies can easily 
incorporate multiple surface molecules and leverage inherent cell-cell interactions and biological 
functions of the cell from which the membrane was derived. However, this approach gives less 
control over the number and the identity of the surface moieties and may require ex vivo manipulation 
of donor cells. Genetic engineering can enhance control over certain characteristics of the derived 
cell membrane or vesicle, such as surface protein expression, to achieve tailored functions. As 
demonstrated later in this chapter, the creation of nanoparticle-cell hybrids using these strategies 
has resulted in nanoparticle immunotherapeutic strategies with novel functions.
3.3 Stimuli-responsive delivery and controlled release
Stimuli-responsive materials have allowed for the controlled alteration of particle physiochemical 
properties and the release of surface coatings and targeting agents to allow for improved 
nanoparticle maneuvering of different biological microenvironments. Additionally, this feature 
can program nanoparticles to release therapies in response to endogenous alterations in the target 
microenvironments or in response to exogenously provided cues and be used to cleave prodrugs 
(Goldberg 2019). As a result, novel immunomodulatory drug release profiles (such as pulsatile 
release) can be achieved in addition to improved delivery to specific intracellular compartments 
and anatomical locations. This can be important in controlling the delivery of cytotoxic agents, such 
as chemotherapy and antimicrobial agents, which can synergize with immunotherapy by causing 
immunogenic cell death, by eliminating immune-evasive clones or variants, and/or by reducing 
disease burden. Careful attention should be paid, however, to the kinetics of these therapies’ release 
profiles, as prolonged exposure to subtherapeutic levels can enhance the development of therapeutic 
resistance and burst release can obliterate bystander immune cells in the disease microenvironment, 
potentially limiting its therapeutic synergy with immunotherapy and safety (Kirtane et al. 2021). 
External stimuli, such as those derived from photothermal and ultrasonic modalities, can also 
provide therapeutic effects. Examples of different stimuli include pH, temperature, enzymes 
(endogenous host/microbiome-derived and CRISPR-Cas9), redox potential, light, ultrasonic 
waves, and electrical and magnetic fields (Mura et al. 2013). In a related feature, the chemistry 
of the nanoparticle and its stimuli-responsiveness can allow for programmed release of therapy 
with different kinetics, including sustained, sequential, and pulsatile profiles. This can widen the 
therapeutic window, impact the nature of the generated immune responses, and reduce the dosing 
frequency of therapy (Goldberg 2019). For example, vaccination with poly(lactide-co-glycolide) 
nanoparticles was shown to generate superior humoral and cellular responses than vaccination with 
liposomal particles due to differences in antigen release kinetics (Demento et al. 2012). As this 
example illustrates, one of the largest contributions these features provide to nanomaterials-based 
immunotherapy is the ability to better control the spatiotemporal kinetics of the therapy or therapies, 
allowing for dynamic alterations in immune signaling, and in the magnitude and duration of the 
incited immune responses.
3.4 Delivery context
While not a direct parameter of the nanotechnology itself, the delivery context of the immunomodulatory 
nanoparticle therapy, including the number of particles given, its route of administration, and the 
timing of its administration relative to other therapies, can influence the design of the nanoparticle, 
its fate in the body, and the outcome of immunotherapy. Ouyang et al. made the important discovery 
that a dose threshold exists for enhancing nanoparticle accumulation in tumors (Ouyang et al. 
2020). The authors showed that doses over 1 trillion nanoparticles overwhelmed Kupffer cell uptake 246 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
rates, causing a nonlinear decrease in liver clearance and prolonging nanoparticle circulation. This 
enhanced tumor delivery efficiency to up to 12% in comparison to the median delivery of 0.7% 
of injected dose typically seen using nanoparticle-mediated delivery (Wilhelm et al. 2017). While 
applied to chemotherapy here, this concept is critical for the design of systemic nanomedicine 
therapies that target tissues outside the organs of the reticuloendothelial system. This study is an 
important example of how nanomedicine design extends beyond particle attributes alone to achieve 
effective delivery and therapeutic outcomes. 
The route of administration determines the molecules, cells, tissues, and organs to which the 
nanomedicine will be exposed and the biological barriers that will impede its delivery to the target 
site. It determines which components the nanoparticle will interact with and in what order the 
nanoparticle will encounter them as it travels to its target site (or otherwise). This has a significant 
influence on many nanomaterial-biological interactions, like protein corona formation, as different 
protein types and compositions are encountered in the blood than in the interstitial fluid, cerebrospinal 
fluid, saliva, and mucosa (Nguyen and Lee 2017). These interactions dictate the nanomaterial’s fate 
in the body (biodistribution, pharmacokinetics) and its ability to perform its therapeutic function 
effectively (Poon et al. 2020). This, in turn, influences the propensity of the nanomedicine to 
accumulate in off-target sites, in part dictating the development of adverse side effects. In the context 
of immunotherapy, local administration has been investigated as it can confine potent therapies 
to the target site, enhancing their interactions with these cells and tissues and minimizing their 
exposure to off-target tissues (Goldberg 2019, Irvine and Dane 2020). Francis et al. demonstrated 
that checkpoint blockade therapy was more efficacious when delivered locoregionally to tumors 
using materials than when given systemically because of increased therapy accumulation in target 
tissues (tumor, tumor-draining lymph nodes) (Francis et al. 2020). Nanomaterials can be used to 
increase the retention of therapies at target sites by engineering their size and surface chemistry to 
interact with components of the microenvironment, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Engin 
et al. 2017). Systemic therapy via intravenous injection (IV) is more clinically translatable and can 
reach sites that are not readily accessible for local injection, while transdermal and intramuscular 
delivery are frequently used for the delivery of vaccines. In a recent study using synthetic nanoparticle 
vaccines linking neoantigen peptides and a TLR7/8 agonist, Baharom et al. showed that route of 
administration altered the quality of the immune response generated in response to nanoparticle￾mediated vaccination because of the duration of antigen presentation by DCs (Baharom et al. 2020). 
IV vaccination resulted in more stem-like T cells than subcutaneous injection, which generated 
more effector cells. When combined with checkpoint blockade, therapeutic IV vaccination led 
to improved antitumor responses in comparison to subcutaneous vaccination. Another study by 
Hunter et al. reported that route of administration also impacted the efficacy of a tolerogenic vaccine 
against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis because of its effect on the internalization of 
nanoparticles by different DC subtypes (Hunter et al. 2014). IV delivery again showed improved 
outcomes in comparison to subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and oral administration routes. 
One important consideration in selecting the route of administration for a nano-immunotherapy 
is understanding the differences between the immune response the therapy generates in different 
tissues. It is increasingly recognized that immune responses are tissue-specific (Hu and Pasare 
2013, Horton et al. 2019) and, as a result, the impact and response generated by one route of 
administration may significantly differ from another if it accumulates in lymphoid tissue in one 
area of the body as opposed to another. For example, Hiltensperger et al. showed that helper T cells 
primed in the inguinal lymph nodes versus the mesenteric gut draining lymph nodes have distinct 
functional phenotypes and infiltration patterns in central nervous system autoimmunity while a 
study by Esterházy et al. demonstrated that the lymph nodes of the same organ can have distinct 
immunological function, with proximal lymph nodes in the gut mediating tolerogenic responses 
and distal lymph nodes mediating pro-inflammatory responses (Hiltensperger et al. 2021, Esterházy Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 247
et al. 2019). As a result, the immunobiology of different organs and disease pathologies are important 
considerations when designing nanomaterial-based immunotherapy systems. 
Finally, when designing a nanomaterial immunotherapy strategy, one must consider its context 
in relation to therapies used in current clinical practice and within proposed combinations. Often, 
it is desirable to situate novel immunotherapies within the context of currently used clinical 
therapies, as you can build upon the known efficacy of these therapies, more readily enabling 
clinical translation. However, for example, conventional cancer therapies, like chemotherapy and 
surgery, can have local and systemic immunological effects that can blunt the efficacy of some 
immunotherapies (Galluzzi et al. 2018). Modifying the timing or delivery of these therapies in 
relation to nanoparticle immunotherapy (or in their release from combination chemoimmunotherapy 
nanoparticle systems) can determine whether its impact on the resultant immunological response is 
detrimental, neutral, additive, or synergistic (Silvestrini et al. 2017). Furthermore, certain therapies, 
such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, ultrasound and photothermal therapy, can 
be used to precondition target microenvironments to enhance nanoparticle therapy delivery (Mead 
et al. 2019, Chen et al. 2019). Conversely, nanoparticle immunotherapy can also be used to alter 
the target tissue’s immunobiology prior to conventional therapy. In one example, gold nanoparticles 
were conjugated to TNF-a (a vascular targeting agent) and administered prior to photothermal 
therapy in tumor-bearing rodents (Shenoi et al. 2011). These particles induced vascular damage 
and significant decreases in blood flow, recruiting inflammatory immune cells to the tumor and 
significantly enhancing photothermal therapy. These studies demonstrate how the therapeutic 
context of nanoparticle therapy can influence immunotherapeutic outcomes.
3.5 Summary
Taken together, these sections provide a foundation for understanding the influence of nanoparticle 
properties on nanotechnology-mediated immunotherapeutic delivery and therapeutic outcomes. The 
next sections will describe applications in which these nanomaterial engineering principles were 
leveraged to develop innovative therapy for cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. 
4. Leveraging nanomaterial properties for enhanced 
immunotherapy
Nanomaterials can be designed with enhanced properties that achieve more specific delivery across 
multiple length scales, more potent immunomodulatory properties, and that direct the spatiotemporal 
action of combination therapy to enable the design of safe and efficacious immunotherapeutic 
treatments. In this section, we discuss the ways in which the different intrinsic properties of 
nanomaterials, such as material type, stimuli responsiveness, and surface modification, have been 
leveraged to modulate immune cells and their interactions with other cells and microorganisms. 
4.1 Direct immunomodulation through novel material design
Recent studies have illustrated that not all materials are immunologically inert, as previously 
thought, but instead can generate potent immunomodulatory responses. A summary of the broad 
classification of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory properties of different material types is 
given in Table 2. However, many of these immune responses depend on a range of material-based 
and application-based factors, and the magnitude of the immune response varies greatly between 
some materials. Regardless, the ability for a material to modulate the immune system is attractive 
as it can minimize the number of components needed within a given nanomaterial immunotherapy 248 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
formulation. This has resulted in the design of nanomaterials and nanoparticle compositions with 
immunomodulatory effects. 
Traditional polymer-based materials have been explored as drug-free strategies for modulating 
immune responses. Casey et al. developed cargo-free nanoparticles to control inflammation resulting 
from sepsis (Casey et al. 2019). Here, the authors showed that the immunomodulation achieved 
by the particles, composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and poly(lactic acid), was dependent 
on numerous particle properties including molecular weight, composition, and charge. Particles 
prepared with a negatively charged surfactant (poly(ethylene-alt-maleic acid), PEMA) significantly 
blunted immune cell responses to intracellular and extracellular TLR stimulation, whereas particles 
prepared with a neutral-charged surfactant had limited activity. Mice treated with the PEMA 
particles survived longer in an endotoxemia model. In a separate study, Saito et al. investigated how 
polymer molecular weight and composition influenced the activity of drug-free poly(DL-lactide-co￾glycolide) and poly(DL-lactide) nanoparticles in EAE (Saito et al. 2019). Nanoparticles composed 
of high molecular weight PLG resulted in improved disease control in comparison to low molecular 
weight PLG particles and PDLA particles because of increased particle interaction with immune 
cells in circulation that restrained these cells entrance into the central nervous system, lowering 
inflammation. Together, these studies show how particle material, composition, and preparation can 
be used to generate immunomodulatory responses using only polymeric materials.
Several novel synthetic materials have also been developed that have intrinsic immune adjuvant 
properties in addition to their delivery properties to enable minimalist nanovaccines (Figure 5A; 
Luo et al. 2017). Luo et al. were the first to demonstrate that a synthetic material could simultaneously 
agonize innate immune STING pathway signaling (which promotes immune activation, inflammation, 
and antigen cross-presentation) and efficiently deliver tumor antigens to the cytosol of DCs 
(Luo et al. 2017). To identify this polymer, the authors screened a library of pH-sensitive polymers 
for their ability to incite cytotoxic lymphocyte and helper T cell responses (Figure 5B-C). The 
transition pH (pH 6.9, early endosomal pH) and polymer architecture (seven-membered ring side 
chain) dictated the efficacy of the induced T cell response. Further, the polymer’s transition pH 
also determined its ability to buffer the luminal pH of the endosome to drive cytosolic delivery of 
its encapsulated antigens via the proton sponge effect. (According to the Proton Sponge Effect, 
the polymer’s absorption and accumulation of protons in the endosome increases the membrane 
potential and drives the diffusion of chloride into the endosome, increasing osmotic pressure until 
the endosome’s lipid bilayer ruptures and releases its contents into the cell (Akinc et al. 2005).) 
These properties allowed for potent STING-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple 
murine models and, when combined with checkpoint blockade therapy, led to 100% survival in a 
Table 2. The Immunological Effects of Materials. A broad categorization of the immunomodulatory effects of common 
materials used in nanotechnology. It should be noted that many of these observed immune responses depend on a range 
of material-based and application-based factors, and the magnitude of the immune response varies greatly between some 
materials and studies. As a result, this should be used as a guide for material selection, but individual application and context 
screening should be completed for a given indication. Materials that are immunologically inert or have not been studied for 
their immunomodulatory properties are excluded. (Source: Adapted from Shields et al. (2019). Materials for Immunotherapy.

TC-1 tumor model (Figure 5D-E). This group also showed that this nanovaccine bound STING in 
a non-competitive site to traditional agonists, such as cGAMP, allowing for STING activation in 
tumor tissue derived from cGAMP-resistant patient populations (Li et al. 2021). A separate study 
by another group used a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction system to screen over 1,000 
ionizable lipid nanoparticle formulations to identify mRNA delivery vehicles that activated potent 
immune responses (Miao et al. 2019). The lipids with the best performances each contained common 
features, including a cyclic amine head group. Like Luo et al.’s polymer, these formulations enhanced 
vaccine-mediated anti-tumor efficacy via activation of the STING pathway. Nanomaterials have also 
been developed that agonize other innate immune receptors, such as TLRs (Mosquera et al. 2019). 
Additional strategies have investigated the incorporation of known immunomodulatory materials 
directly into the polymer backbone. In a recent study, Davenport Huyer et al. created a library of 
polyesters that incorporated itaconate, a power anti-inflammatory molecule that inhibits succinate 
dehydrogenase in macrophages impacting the generation of reactive oxygen species, into the 
polymer backbone and assessed their ability to recapitulate the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial 
properties of the parent molecule (Davenport Huyer et al. 2020). These itaconate polymers were 
able to rapidly resolve inflammation in comparison to silicone control polymers in an in vivo model 
of biomaterial-driven inflammation. 
Another strategy is to use the immunomodulatory therapy itself to form the nanoparticle 
material. This is commonly achieved using therapies that are themselves biological materials, such 
as DNA and antibodies. Antibodies are y-shaped immune proteins that interact with their target 
antigens through complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in their fragment antigen binding 
domains (Fabs) and with receptors on immune cells through their constant regions (Fc). Molecular 
engineering techniques can be used to develop antibodies with exquisite selectivity and affinity for 
their target antigens. The framework residues of the Fc regions can also be engineered using molecular 
techniques, beyond the differences seen between different classes of antibodies, which allow them to 
execute a wide range of effector functions. Antibodies are widely used immunotherapies due to these 
antigen-neutralizing and immunomodulatory features and can be easily manufactured using genetic 
engineering techniques. Divine et al. used computational techniques to design proteins that can 
drive the self-assembly of antibodies or Fc-fusion proteins into nanocages with controlled valency 
and geometry (Divine et al. 2021). Cages were designed from 2, 6, 12, or 30 antibodies without the 
need for chemical modification of the antibody or the incorporation of polymers. These structures 
enhanced antibody-dependent signaling in different applications. In cancer therapy, nanocages 
formed with a death-receptor targeting antibody could induce apoptosis of tumor cells, which 
mediated immunogenic cell death. In infectious disease, this strategy was able to neutralize pseudo￾virus when assembled from antibodies against the SARS-Cov2 spike protein. This strategy has 
many advantages over traditional nanoparticle antibody conjugates, such as ease of manufacturing 
due to self-assembly, controllable antibody orientations, and programmable symmetric higher 
order structures. Given the modular nature of antibodies, this strategy can be applied in multiple 
ways to enhance antibody signaling and therapeutic efficacy. In a similar manner, DNA can also be 
organized into programmable structures using DNA origami (Zhang et al. 2014). The application 
of programmable protein and DNA nanostructures is discussed further in Section 4.3, where these 
structures are used to present antigens to APCs with defined density and valencies. In a separate 
strategy, an enzymatic rolling circle amplification method was used to generate a DNA nanococoon 
from CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, which are innate immune TLR9 agonists, that encapsulated a 
checkpoint blockade antibody and triglycerol monostearate (TGMS) nanoparticles containing a 
restriction enzyme (Wang et al. 2016). This nano-immunotherapy was used to prevent post-surgical 
tumor recurrence. Post-surgical inflammation triggers a nanomaterial degradation cascade where 
inflammation-related enzymes cleave the ester linkages of the TGMS nanoparticles to release their 
encapsulate DNA-cutting restriction enzyme, which in turn degrades the nano-cocoon, enabling the 
concurrent sustained release of checkpoint blockade therapy and CpG. The sustained, local release Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 251
of combination immunotherapy significantly improved outcomes in metastatic cancer models 
following primary tumor resection. 
4.2 Targeting tissues that modify immunity
Lymphoid organs are delivery sites of interest for immunotherapy because they contain high 
concentrations of immune cells and are often the locations where immunological important processes 
are carried out such as lymphocyte and leukocyte development and activation. Nanomaterials have 
been used to enhance the delivery of immunotherapies to the lymph nodes for vaccine development 
and cancer therapy. Targeting therapeutics to the lymph nodes is an attractive strategy as it can 
be used to address lymphocyte and sentinel lymph node metastatic malignancies and latent viral 
reservoirs as well as promote vaccine responses in prophylactic and therapeutic settings for both 
immunogenic and tolerogenic applications (Schudel et al. 2020). After subcutaneous, intradermal, 
intratumoral, or intramuscular injection, lymphatic trafficking is largely mediated by two pathways: 
(1) cell-mediated transport, where APCs uptake the particles at the injection site and home to the 
lymph nodes to induce adaptive immune responses; (2) direct lymphatic drainage, where particles 
drain to the lymph nodes directly via the lymphatics (Irvine et al. 2020). Particles can also diffuse 
into the blood, limiting their exposure to the lymph nodes and potentially causing systemic adverse 
effects. 
Studies have examined the impact of size, charge, deformability, and targeting ligands on the 
delivery of nanoparticles to the lymph nodes (Schudel et al. 2019). In a seminal study, Reddy et 
al. developed antigen-conjugated poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticle vaccines to target lymph￾node resident dendritic cells and activate these cells via in situ complement activation (Reddy et al. 
2007). Importantly, the authors showed that the lymph node delivery efficiency of these nanoparticle 
vaccines was critically dependent on particle size, where 100 nm particles were less efficient than 
25 nm particles. This difference led to demonstrable differences in the generation of humoral and 
cellular immunity. As a result, many studies have targeted this smaller particle size directly or through 
stimuli-responsive alterations in size to enhance lymph node drainage. In a unique study, Song 
et al. developed a biomimetic strategy where they engineered the deformability of albumin-stabilized 
vaccine nanoemulsions (~ 330 nm) to mimic the deformability of immunocytes to enable both direct 
lymph node targeting and antigen-presenting cell-mediated transport of these particles (Song et al. 
2021). The deformability of the droplets allowed for direct lymph node migration while the size 
allowed for some of the particles to form an antigen depot at the injection site. Nanoemulsions with 
and without adjuvant co-delivery (mono-phosphoryl lipid A) significantly improved survival and 
delayed tumor growth in mice, with 100% survival seen out to Day 50 for adjuvanted nanoemulsions. 
In a different strategy, Schudel et al. developed a dynamic nanoparticle approach using 
programmable degradable linkers to enable delivery of therapy to specific lymph node structures 
and their associated lymphocyte subpopulations (Figure 6A) (Schudel et al. 2020). Delivering 
therapy to specific cells within lymph nodes is difficult to achieve due to anatomical barriers that 
regulate the passage of materials based on physiochemical properties, such as size. To overcome 
these barriers and achieve intra-lymph-node-specific delivery, the authors conjugated cargo to 
thiolated poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticles using thiol-reactive oxanorbornadiene linkers, 
where the linker half-lives are dependent on the oxanorbornadiene substituents (Figure 6B). Particle 
size was selected for efficient transport to the lymph nodes while linker half-life was selected 
depending on the targeted cells. The use of the OND linker nanoparticle system led to increased 
cell uptake of small molecule cargos in cells of the lymph node paracortex (Figure 6C), with peak 
uptake of cargo in these cells corresponding to the half-life of the OND linker (Figure 6D). This 
approach could allow for enhanced targeting of immunomodulatory small molecules to different 
areas of the lymph nodes to enhance the generation of adaptive immune responses. As you will see 252 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

DEngineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 253
in additional sections, scientists and engineers have tuned the physiochemical and surface properties 
of nanomedicines to reach a wide range of lymphoid organs. 
In a separate approach, immunity can be modulated by targeting non-lymphoid tissues that 
are known to exert immunomodulatory effects. These include the gut microbiome and disease 
microenvironment, among others. As the disease microenvironment location varies greatly with 
different types of disease and within the same families of disease, we will focus our discussion 
on targeting the body’s microbiome. The microbiome is the collection of microorganisms found 
on the surface of barrier tissues in the skin, lungs, mouth, throat, gut, and vagina. The disease 
microenvironment can also have its own associated microbiome that influences treatment efficacy 
and patient outcomes (Riquelme et al. 2019, Nejman et al. 2020). Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome
impacts the immunopathology of many diseases including cancer (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2017, 
Matson et al. 2018) and IBD (Round and Mazmanian 2009, Halfvarson et al. 2017). Most notably, 
in cancer immunotherapy, recent studies have highlighted its contribution to the poor response rates 
seen in patients treated with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2017, 
Matson et al. 2018). Nanomaterials can be used to enhance targeting of therapy to different regions 
within the colon and to directly modify metabolic and immunologic functions of the gut microbiome 
(Song et al. 2019), such as their production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that influence the 
activity of the immune system (Scheppach et al. 1995, Parada Venegas et al. 2019). 
Studies have used the innate ability of materials, such as dietary fibers, to directly modify the 
gut microbiome to enhance immunomodulatory therapy outcomes in cancer and IBD. Han et al. 
showed that the oral administration of a colon-retentive inulin gel could modify the gut microbiome 
in situ by increasing the number of anti-tumor commensal microorganism and their production of 
immunomodulatory SCFAs (Han et al. 2021). This therapy synergized with checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy and induced notable changes in the local and systemic immune response, including the 
establishment of stem-like T cells within the TME and of systemic memory T cells. This study 
provides a workflow for how materials can be screened for their microbiome-modulating activity 
and formulated into gels using materials chemistry to retain in specific locations in the gut. In a 
related work by the same group, Lee et al. described a nanomedicine created from hyaluronic acid 
and bilirubin to treat colitis that accumulated in inflamed colon tissue, regulated the response of 
pro-inflammatory macrophages, and modulated the gut microbiome to increase its diversity and 
richness (Lee et al. 2019). The authors showed that the efficacy of this therapy was in part mediated 
by its ability to modify the gut microbiome as depletion of commensal bacteria with broad-spectrum 
antibiotics partly abrogated its therapeutic efficacy. In another study, Mosquera et al. demonstrated 
that the gut microbiome can modulate the immune activity and efficacy of nanovaccines in mice 
with metabolic syndrome, which is prevalent in approximately 25% of the world’s population 
(Mosquera et al. 2019, Saklayen 2018). In this study, they showed that disease-altered TLR5 innate

immune sensing of the gut microbiota diminished germinal center responses to poly(lactic-co￾glycolic acid) nanovaccines. Interestingly, the PLGA vaccines also impacted the composition of 
the gut microbiome. To rescue the low immune response observed for nanovaccines, the authors 
developed an immunostimulatory pyridine-poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) nanogel vaccine, 
which functions through an alternative TLR, that resulted in stronger germinal center responses 
than adjuvant-supplemented PLGA vaccine. This demonstrates how material’s choice can influence 
gut microbiome composition and overcome dampened immune responses to vaccines resulting from 
disease pathology.
Phage-guided nanomedicines can also be used to both target and modulate specific bacterial 
species in the microbiome. A unique study by Zheng et al. used phage-guided delivery of abiotic￾biotic chemotherapy-loaded nanoparticles to treat colorectal cancer in a multi-faceted approach 
(Zheng et al. 2019). Bacteriophages are viruses that propagate within bacteria with high specificity, 
allowing them to target individual species of bacteria without infecting other bacteria or mammalian 
cells, making them desirable therapeutic agents for tailored microbiome modification. The authors 
isolated and selected a bacteriophage from human saliva based on its ability to target F. nucleatum, 
which is known to drive the formation of a highly chemo-resistant and immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (Yu et al. 2017). The isolated phage was functionalized with azide moieties 
to enable biorthogonal click-chemistry conjugation of DBCO-modified chemotherapy-loaded 
nanoparticles. Furthermore, the authors tailored the design of the covalently linked nanoparticles 
to have multifaceted anti-tumor activity. They screened eight different types of materials for their 
ability to support the proliferation of commensal anti-tumor microbes as a prebiotic therapy before 
selecting dextran. Irinotecan was also encapsulated within the dextran nanoparticles, enhancing 
its delivery specificity. When given orally or intravenously to mice bearing orthotopic colorectal 
tumors, the phage-targeted nanomedicine showed enhanced tumor growth control and survival as 
well as reduced chemotherapy-associated side effects. Together, this work demonstrates how phage￾guided nanomaterials can enable combination delivery of therapeutic agents to disease sites by 
targeting tumor-associated bacteria, with a unique focus on how the choice of nanoparticle material 
and carrier agents can be used to enhance anti-tumor immunity by therapeutically modifying the gut 
microbiome. Similar strategies could be used to modify the gut microbiome to enhance immunity in 
other diseases and to directly treat inflammatory disease like IBD. 
4.3 Improved immune signaling and immune interactions using 
multivalency
The ability of nanoparticles to display multiple copies of the same ligand and multiple copies of 
different ligands have allowed nanoparticles to effectively target specific cells, mimic cell-cell 
immune interactions, and bridge multiple cell types (such as immune and cancer cells) to enhance 
immune signaling and immunotherapeutic outcomes. Nanoparticle multivalency can also control 
the way that antigen is presented to the immune system for processing in nanovaccines. 
While many studies have focused on how nanoparticle multivalency can influence extracellular 
or cell surface interactions as described earlier in this chapter and below, few studies have focused 
on the ways polymer multivalency can engineer intracellular signaling. A recent proof-of-concept 
study by Li et al. demonstrated how polymer multivalency can be used to induce the assembly 
of macromolecular complexes of an intracellular signaling protein, intracellular stimulator of 
interferon genes protein (STING), through polyvalent phase condensation (Li et al. 2021). In 
signaling pathways, the assembly of membrane-less macromolecular complexes through phase 
condensation can lead to enhanced sensitivity to small changes in the microenvironment, impacting 
the regulation of signal transduction (Banani et al. 2017). The PC7A polymer used in this study was 
a pH-sensitive polymer containing seven-membered cyclic tertiary amine structures, which together 
allow for its cellular internalization and activation of STING. Luo et al. had previously synthesized Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 255
this polymer to act concurrently as a nano-vaccine delivery vehicle and immune adjuvant. Here, 
the multivalency of the PC7A polymer led to distinct spatiotemporal STING activation profiles 
in comparison to cGAMP, an endogenous cyclic dinucleotide STING agonist that can induce 
STING oligomerization upon binding. The duration of STING activation and the related cytokine 
production and the robustness of the induced innate immune response was dependent on the length 
of the polymer, whereas longer polymers with higher valency (to a certain extent) induced higher 
levels of STING activation compared to polymers of lower valency and to cGAMP. While these 
alterations in spatiotemporal signaling dynamics did not lead to significant changes in survival in 
comparison to cGAMP therapy, the ability to engineer biological processes that are regulated in part 
by polyvalent phase condensation, such as gene expression and signal transduction, using polymers 
as therapeutics holds great promise in immunotherapy.
Nanoparticle multivalency has been used to enhance cell-cell interactions through the 
development of nanomaterial-based bispecific T cell and NK cell engagers (nanoengagers), 
allowing for enhanced cytotoxic activity of adaptive and innate immune cells against tumors (Yuan 
et al. 2017, Au et al. 2020). Nanoengagers act as a bridge between immune cells and tumor cells to 
induce tumor cell cytotoxicity that is MHC-I-independent, addressing issues with loss of antigen 
or MHC expression that can result in immune escape (Galluzzi et al. 2018). Further, multivalent 
contact between the nanoengager and both cell types can enhance apparent binding affinity because 
of avidity, resulting in improved establishment of each pair of cells, which can improve cell killing. 
Different combinations of antibody or targeting moieties can be further used to generate different 
cell type pairings to enhance their interactions. Immunomodulatory agents, such as cytokines, can 
also be encapsulated within the core of the nanoengagers and released over time to enhance immune 
cell recruitment or to further stimulate the desired immune action or cell function. While promising, 
nanoparticle architectures or chemistries that provide enhanced control over the orientation and 
localization of the conjugated antibodies or targeting agents could significantly improve this 
strategy. Future studies will also have to demonstrate the superiority of this approach to molecular 
engineering and bioconjugation strategies that achieve the same function, as these approaches are 
more readily manufacturable and translatable.
In a separate application, multivalency has been used in the design of nanovaccines. Nanoparticle 
architecture and conjugation chemistry influence the ways in which the antigens are transported, 
processed and displayed following immunization, resulting in immune responses of different potency 
to nanovaccines (Eppler and Jewell 2019). Importantly, nanoparticles can deliver multiple copies of 
a given antigen simultaneously and allow for display of antigens in their native conformation, which 
can enhance the specificity and magnitude of the induced immune response. Numerous nanoparticle 
techniques have been used to study the connection between antigen display and the incited immune 
response. Tokatlian et al. found that innate immune recognition pathway receptors mediated the 
rapid complement-dependent transport of separate nanoparticles made from two different heavily 
glycosylated HIV immunogens to the follicular dendritic cell network (Tokatlian et al. 2018). This 
resulted in immunogen concentration in lymph node GCs and enhanced antibody responses. The 
same trafficking was not seen with the soluble antigens. Thus, this study demonstrates the important 
of glycosylation and multivalency on nanovaccine design. In another study, Veneziano et al. used the 
ability of DNA origami to generate precise programmable structures to study the effect of antigen 
nanovaccine design principles (Veneziano et al. 2020). Applying this platform to a clinical vaccine 
immunogen for HIV, the authors were able to elucidate design principles for both antigens (such as 
antigen copy number, affinity, and nearest-neighbor antigen spacing) and nanoparticles (stiffness, 
shape) that led to maximum B cell activity. This study illustrates a workflow for investigating the 
impact of different antigens, their combination, and nanoparticle properties on immune responses to 
determine optimal design parameters for nanovaccines. 
Beyond design principles, multivalent nanoparticles have been developed to study whether 
particles containing the receptor binding domain from four to eight animal betacoronaviruses 256 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
(mosaic particles) can broadly protect against future coronaviruses that evolve from cross-species 
transmissions in mice in comparison to a homotypic particle, soluble antigen vaccination, and natural 
infection (Cohen et al. 2021). Immunization using a boosting schedule with either nanoparticle 
formulation resulted in antibodies that could bind and neutralize heterologous coronaviruses whereas 
soluble immunization and natural infection produced weak heterologous responses, if any. These 
data demonstrate the influence of antigen multivalency on the induction of cross-reactive antibody 
responses. Further, mosaic nanoparticles showed enhanced generation of neutralizing antibodies 
against the coronavirus subgenus, sarbecovirus, which are known to cross over to humans more 
readily (Boni et al. 2020). This work demonstrates the use of nanoparticle multivalency to co-display 
multiple types of one antigen and of multiple antigens to induce protective immune responses that 
combat infectious disease evolution. 
Together, these studies demonstrate how nanoparticle and polymer multivalency can be used 
to enhance and control immune signaling and immune interactions at the subcellular, intracellular, 
and intercellular levels.
4.4 Enabling novel vaccination strategies
Vaccines were the first therapies to use immunoengineering mechanisms to enable their therapeutic 
effects. However, traditional methods of delivering vaccines using free, soluble mixtures of antigens 
and adjuvants suffer from poorly controlled spatiotemporal kinetics and cumbersome manufacturing 
(Irvine et al. 2020). Additionally, bioinformatic methods to predict the most effective cocktail of 
antigens for established disease (therapeutic vaccination) or future infections (prophylactic) can be 
costly and may not provide sufficient coverage of the disease epitopes to enable disease eradication 
(Fang et al. 2014). Given their ability to incorporate cargo with very different properties into one 
medicine, to enhance delivery to lymphoid cells and tissue, and to control the presentation of these 
immunogenic molecules to APCs, nanotechnology-based vaccines have been extensively explored 
as alternatives to traditional soluble vaccines. The foundational aspects of nanoparticle-mediated 
vaccination have been reviewed thoroughly in the literature and the reader is directed to those 
articles for additional reference (Zhao et al. 2014, Pati et al. 2018, Irvine et al. 2020). Here, we will 
cover the ways in which nanotechnology-mediated vaccines are revolutionizing this therapeutic 
approach using biomimetic and genetic engineering strategies to achieve improved outcomes and 
manufacturability. 
As highlighted by the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for the SARS-COV2 virus, lipid 
nanoparticle-based (LNP) delivery of mRNA vaccines is an effective strategy for the induction of 
therapeutic prophylactic adaptive immune responses (Polack et al. 2020, Baden et al. 2021). mRNA 
vaccines take advantage of the transient expression profile of cytosolically delivered mRNA to 
mediate controlled, prolonged exposure of antigens to immune cells within an immunostimulatory 
context (Pardi et al. 2018). Certain mRNAs can also play an immune adjuvant role in these 
vaccines in addition to serving as the antigen source. As a result, this strategy has traditionally 
been applied in the setting of costimulatory vaccines for the prevention of infectious disease or for 
the treatment of cancer responses (Pardi et al. 2018). However, it is beginning to be explored in 
autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Krienke et al. developed a novel non-inflammatory, 
tolerizing mRNA LNP vaccine delivering the self-antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 
(MOG), for the treatment of EAE (Krienke et al. 2021). In this setting, vaccination is designed to 
suppress antigen-specific immune responses, in part, by activating regulatory T cells rather than 
priming cytolytic responses by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. To counter the immunostimulatory adjuvant 
activity of mRNA, the authors used a less immunogenic form of mRNA that could not activate 
TLRs in their vaccine. Mice vaccinated with mRNA LNP vaccines encoding MOG but not those 
vaccinated with an irrelevant antigen were protected against EAE when vaccinated before disease 
onset (prophylactic) and showed delayed disease progression when vaccinated early in disease onset Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 257
(therapeutic). The induction of antigen-specific regulatory T cells and their immunosuppression 
of bystander effector T cells mediated therapeutic efficacy rather than the deletion of pre-existing 
autoreactive T cells. Further, the authors demonstrated that the vaccine did not induce antigen￾specific autoantibodies and that a cocktail of antigens could enhance therapeutic outcomes. While 
numerous questions remain, including the duration of the induced immunoregulatory effects, the 
safety and efficacy of repeat exposure to autoantigens, and the choice of antigen cocktail for a 
given disease, this study demonstrates the proof-of-concept use of mRNA vaccines in autoimmune 
diseases to expose antigen to the immune system in the absence of co-stimulatory signals for the 
generation of tolerogenic, therapeutic immune responses. Additional studies into the impact of LNP 
formulation adjuvant activity and the type of antigen encoded on the induced immune response 
could provide additional design principles for engineering both proinflammatory and tolerogenic 
mRNA vaccines. 
While mRNA vaccination has been shown to be safe and effective in some disease settings, it 
is still burdened by the need to identify the antigen or antigens required to induce effective immune 
responses. It is also limited by the amount of therapeutic cargo that can be loaded in a particle, 
reducing the number of antigens that can be included. One method to address difficulties in antigen 
prediction and the incorporation of multiple disease antigens is to use nanoparticles cloaked in cell￾membrane coatings derived from diseased or infected cells. Cell membrane coatings from diseased 
cells, such as tumor cells, can retain a wide array of surface-displayed antigens from their source cells, 
providing optimal target antigens for nanovaccines without requiring costly bioinformatics strategies 
to identify antigens or multivalent nanoparticle functionalization to deliver antigen cocktails (Fang 
et al. 2014). A seminal study by Fang et al. leveraged the rich antigenic information derived from 
diseased cell membranes to generate tumor-specific immunity using a nanovaccine compromised of 
adjuvant-loaded nanoparticles coated with cancer cell membranes (Fang et al. 2014). In this study, 
the cancer cell membrane coatings also improved drug delivery through homotypic tumor targeting. 
The same group later engineered cancer cell membrane nanoparticle coatings that expressed a co￾stimulatory marker to enable direct simulation and priming of antigen-specific T cells without the 
need for antigen-presenting cells (Jiang et al. 2020). This bypasses the need for antigen uptake and 
cross-presentation by APCs if the nanomedicine can be effectively targeted to lymphoid tissues, 
increasing the potential for therapeutic efficacy and efficiency. A similar approach where host cell 
membranes are synthetically modified to express co-inhibitory molecules could be used to engineer 
immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Cytokine 
signals could also be incorporated within the nanoparticle core to further enhance or inhibit immune 
cell priming using this strategy. One inherent drawback of this approach is that it involves external 
manipulation of a patient’s diseased tissue or cells to generate the nanoparticle coating. 
In contrast, in situ vaccination, or the ability to promote antigen-specific adaptive immune 
responses with memory through the generation of antigens from diseased tissues in the body directly 
and without external manipulation, has many advantages over traditional vaccine approaches. 
Because antigens are generated from diseased tissue within the body, this strategy reduces the 
dependency of the therapy on neoantigen prediction or on the isolation and identification of patient￾specific antigens. This makes therapy more cost effective, convenient, and efficient than alternative 
strategies. Furthermore, in situ vaccination may improve therapeutic efficacy by more effectively 
addressing tumor heterogeneity, both within a given tumor (intrapatient) and between patients 
(interpatient). However, there is potential for immune escape if disease subclones aren’t susceptible 
to or are not reached by the method that is used to generate antigens and if their epitope profile is 
not covered by other susceptible subclones. In this approach, an immunogenic cell death (ICD) 
inducing strategy is used to generate tumor antigens and release DAMPs, stimulating the uptake 
and cross-presentation of the released antigens by APCs. Often, a small molecule immune adjuvant 
is provided to further stimulate APCs and to help revert the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor 
microenvironment while checkpoint blockade therapy may be included to block immune escape 258 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
and prevent the inhibition of T cell activity. Nanoparticles are used to mediate the spatiotemporal 
kinetics of this combination therapy and to enhance antigen uptake and cross-presentation by DCs. 
Together, this nanomaterial-mediated strategy seeks to enhance anti-tumor immunity by enabling 
the coordinated and efficient execution of a multi-step immune cascade in situ. 
However, one inherent challenge in this approach is that individual steps in the immune cascade 
can require different nanomaterial designs (size, charge, etc.) to navigate their different processes 
(i.e., APC internalization vs. lymph node draining). To address this issue, Qin et al. engineered 
a novel thermo-responsive nanoparticle-based gel system by mixing alpha-cyclodextrin with 
dendrimer nanoparticles conjugated to CpG and a reductively cleavable mannopyranoside immune 
cell targeting agent (Qin et al. 2020). To mediate ICD and antigen release, they encapsulated 
immunogenic doxorubicin chemotherapy and the photosensitizing agent, indocyanine green (ICG). 
Each of these therapies served an additional purpose-ICG potentiated photothermal therapy upon 
808-nm laser irradiation, inducing tumor cell apoptosis and enhancing thermal degradation of the 
gel to release doxorubicin and CpG nanoparticles while chemotherapy was included to enhance 
cytotoxicity at the tumor core where laser irradiation efficiency is poor (Figure 7A). Furthermore, 
CpG dendrimer nanoparticles released from the gel were able to capture released antigens via 
electrostatic adsorption, drain to the lymph nodes more efficiently due to their small size and 
neutral charge, and co-deliver the adsorbed antigen and conjugated adjuvant under intracellular 
reductive conditions (Figure 7B-C). The thermal-responsive and reduction-responsive nature of 
this nanoparticle-based gel system allowed for the generation of materials with different properties 
that collectively enhanced therapeutic outcomes by maximizing the efficiency of each step in the 
immune cascade. Furthermore, combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockade resulted in 
enhanced survival in postresection models by inducing tumor-specific immune responses against 
recurrence and metastasis (Figure 7D-F). 
Additional studies have used nanoparticles to mediate genetic engineering approaches 
in vivo for the execution of novel in situ vaccination strategies. In one study, Ngamcherdtrakul et al. 
delivered CpG adjuvant in combination with silencing RNA against signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3) using mesoporous silica nanoparticles to induce in situ tumor vaccination 
(Ngamcherdtrrakul et al. 2021). In multiple tumor-associated immune cells, STAT3 mediates 
multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression; it can cause immunogenic cell death when silenced in 
cancer cells (Kortylewski et al. 2009). As a result, siRNA therapy against STAT3 is a multifaceted 
immunomodulatory approach. This nanovaccine resulted in enhanced curative survival in murine 
models of melanoma, breast, and colon cancers when combined with checkpoint blockade therapy. 
It was also shown to be well-tolerated in nonhuman primates, accelerating translation to the clinic. 
Another approach by Li et al. used an ICD-inducing lipid nanoparticle formulation to deliver self￾replicating RNA encoding the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) fused to lumican, an extracellular￾matrix binding protein which enhanced cytokine tumor retention (Li et al. 2020). IL-12 is a cytokine 
that regulates Th1 responses and promotes the expansion, survival, and activity of cytotoxic T cells 
and natural killer cells. The authors showed that an ionizable lipid formulation could induce ICD of 
cancer cells while mediating RNA delivery, which resulted in innate immune stimulation of TLR3 to 
the RNA and enhanced anti-tumor T cell responses because of IL-12 expression and retention. The 
design and use of a replicon mediated enhanced IL-12 expression in tumor tissue that necessitated 
the use of a collagen-binding protein to prevent dissemination of IL-12 into the blood to counter the 
potential for the development of systemic toxicities. Importantly, large established tumors and their 
distal untreated metastases in several immunocompetent mouse models were completely eradicated 
in mice treated with a single injection of this therapy. Other payloads could be incorporated into the 
replicons to adapt this approach to target other pathways. This approach demonstrates the significant 
potential for immunotherapeutic approaches combining synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and 
materials. Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 259 nanoparticle cells; with the vivo in the by dendritic Ex treated ferences mice nodes). (C) notherapeutic Dif lization .

5. Nanomaterial-cell immunotherapies
The large, diverse repertoire of immune cells and their associated functions are a powerful resource 
for immunotherapy in the treatment of disease. Directing the precise location, activation state, 
functions, and interactions of these cells is integral to achieving safe and efficacious immunotherapy. 
In this section, we will discuss the ways in which nanomaterials and immune cells are interfacing 
to achieve these outcomes. 
5.1 Altering immune cell trafficking and disease microenvironment 
infiltration
An important area of research is how to control immune cell migration as the location of the 
immune cells influence the processes under which they’ll go, their activity, and immunotherapeutic 
outcomes. The movement of immune cells (and other cells) is regulated in part by their integration 
of chemotactic and physical microenvironment signaling cues via their dynamic expression and 
regulation of their surface receptors. Chemotactic cues, such as chemokines, are used to create 
protein and chemical gradients between immune tissues, disease sites, and the blood to mediate 
immune cell migration. The maturation state of the immune cell determines whether it will express 
the required surface molecules to drive chemotaxis. An important chemokine-receptor pair is 
the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor, CXC receptor 3 (CXCR3). CXCL10 
expression is induced upon activation of multiple innate immune inflammatory pathways. 
CXCL10 serves many immunostimulatory roles including acting as a chemoattractant for many 
immune cell types, such as T cells and dendritic cells. The ability to recruit these cells to the 
disease microenvironment is important as recent studies have shown that the efficacy of immune 
checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy may rely on T cell responses generated outside the tumor 
microenvironment (Yost et al. 2021). Zhao et al. used erythrocyte-anchored nanoparticles entrapping 
the chemokine CXCL10 to target metastatic tumor cells in the lungs for immunotherapy delivery. 
The PLGA nanoparticle chemistry (lactic acid to glycolic acid ratio, end group type) was engineered 
to allow the particles to non-covalently attach to the cell surface and to deposit and accumulate 
in the lungs in response to physio-mechanical stresses exerted by the lung capillary endothelium 
(Zhao et al. 2020). The particles were further modified with ICAM-1 binding antibodies to promote 
particle adhesion to the lung endothelium, extending the retention time of the nanoparticles in the 
lungs from 20 minutes to over six hours in vivo. Lung deposition of the CXCL10-loaded nanoparticles 
generated a chemokine gradient between the metastases and the blood, driving enhanced immune 
cell tumor infiltration that led to in situ immunization and induced systemic immunity (from a 
metastatic site) and the formation of immune memory. Another study delivered DNA encoding 
chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and protein antigens to DCs using a mannose-targeted micelle to 
drive DC chemotaxis to the lymph nodes following antigen uptake for efficient T cell priming 
(Yang et al. 2018). This strategy overcame tumor-derived immunosuppression in the lymph nodes, 
which prevents efficient trafficking of APCs to these tissues to incite an immune response. Together, 
these studies illustrate how nanoparticle delivery of chemotactic molecules can influence immune 
cell migration to immune and pathological tissues. 
In addition to the receptors found on immune cells, the surface molecules found on the 
endothelial cells of lymphoid tissue and of the blood and lymphatic vasculatures play a key role 
in mediating immune cell migration and activation. The surface receptors of endothelial cells 
in lymphoid tissues are responsible for sensing signals from circulation and expressing surface 
molecules, like integrin receptors, that modify the ingress and egress of immune cells from these 
tissues. Recently, Krohn-Grimberghe et al. demonstrated that nanoparticles delivering small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) to bone-marrow endothelial cells to silence genes involved in regulating 
the release of hematopoietic cells and leukocytes from the bone marrow could improve healing and Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 261
outcomes after myocardial infarction (Krohn-Grimberghe et al. 2020). The authors screened in vivo 
formulations with different PEG surface coatings (density and molecular weight) and PEG lipid 
architectures to identify lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles that enhanced delivery of siRNA to the 
bone marrow niche endothelial cells. These alterations to the PEG surface chemistry potentially 
reduced nanoparticle uptake in other organs with higher systemic circulation perfusion such as the 
lungs. Using this strategy, the authors showed that they could both inhibit and stimulate immune 
cell release from the bone marrow following therapy, leading to improved outcomes in a model of 
myocardial infarction when inhibitory signaling was used. This strategy could be used to silence 
other receptors, signaling molecules, and cell-cell interaction molecules expressed by or on the 
endothelium to modulate the ability of these cells to interact with and respond to molecular and 
cellular components in the circulation. This study demonstrates how nanoparticle gene therapy can 
be targeted to cells in tissues and organs involved in the regulation of immune cell trafficking within 
the body, altering the ability of these cells to reach sites of inflammation and disease, with potential 
to treat a range of disease types. 
The interaction between surface molecules on endothelial vasculature cells and circulating 
lymphocytes also can determine the ability of lymphocytes to home to specific tissues. To induce 
gut-specific tropisms, vitamin A-derived retinoic acid, a natural product of gut-resident DCs, can 
be delivered to lymphocytes to drive the surface expression of the gut-homing C-C chemokine 
receptor 9 (CCR9) and the a4b7 integrin, which binds to an addressin expressed specifically by 
gut endothelial cells (Iwata et al. 2004). Xia et al. used retinoic acid as an adjuvant for oil-in￾polymer vaccine capsules to drive peripheral dendritic cell upregulation of CCRR9 and homing to 
gut mucosal tissues following intramuscular injection for enhanced systemic and gastrointestinal 
responses (Xia et al. 2018). The same group later enhanced the efficacy of this vaccine strategy by 
developing a polymer/lipid nanoparticle that improved dendritic cell migration to the peripheral 
lymph nodes to prime gut-specific T cells rather than their direct homing to gut tissue (Du et al. 
2019). These particles co-delivered retinoic acid, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, and antigens, where 
the inclusion of CpG in the vaccine formulation induced draining lymph node homing of DCs and 
the amplification of lymphocyte activation and homing receptor switching. This effect, which they 
termed the draining lymph node-amplifying effect, boosted systemic responses, such as IgG secretion 
and T cell activation, in peripheral tissues and invoked enhanced T cell homing and antigen-specific 
IgA levels in gut mucosal tissue in response to EV71 vaccination. This strategy could be used to 
mediate enteric therapeutic vaccination for other diseases, such as IBD and gastrointestinal cancers. 
Physical barriers found in healthy and pathologic tissues can also prevent the migration of 
immune cells into disease microenvironments. In cancer, stromal cells can upregulate their 
expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components forming a fibrotic barrier to immune cell 
(and nanoparticle) infiltration (Netti et al. 2000). To address this issue, Huang et al. developed 
pancreatic tumor-targeting calcium phosphate liposome core shell particles delivering a-mangostin 
(an antifibrotic therapy that decreases collagen deposition) and a DNA plasmid encoding LIGHT 
(a cytokine that increases T cell recruitment) (Huang et al. 2020). By concurrently reducing the 
fibrotic physical barrier preventing tumor infiltration using a-mangostin and enhancing immune cell 
recruitment by generating chemoattractants using LIGHT, this nanomedicine enabled immune cell 
infiltration and enhanced checkpoint blockade therapy. Interestingly, this therapy also induced the 
formation of intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). These structures, which consist of T 
cells, B cells, DCs, and other APCs, can locally prime and activate adaptive immune cells within the 
disease microenvironment, enhancing endogenous and therapy-induced immune responses. TLSs 
have recently emerged as a biomarker of checkpoint blockade therapy responses in many different 
solid tumors (Sautès-Fridman et al. 2019, Helmink et al. 2020); however, the mechanisms by which 
TLSs are induced and maintained are not currently known nor is it known how their associated 
immune processes and responses differ from those generated in the lymph nodes and spleen (Sharma 
et al. 2021). As a result, strategies that enhance lymphocyte recruitment and induce the formation 262 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
of TLSs are of intense interest to the development of more efficacious cancer immunotherapy 
strategies.
5.2 Cell-nanomaterial hybrids for improved immunotherapy
Natural materials have evolved to achieve biologically distinct functions that are difficult to fully 
recapitulate with synthetic materials. Bioderived and biomimetic materials seek to leverage this 
specificity to create new capabilities for nanomedicines. One recent biomimetic strategy has been 
to use cell membranes to cloak synthetic nanoparticles with surface coatings that recapitulate the 
complex interfaces found naturally and that reduce exposure of the synthetic particle to the immune 
system (Hu et al. 2015). These cell coatings have been derived from erythrocytes, immune cells, 
tumor cells, and platelets, among others. The generated core-shell particles can be superior to cell￾membrane derived vesicles alone due to their improved in vivo stability (Zhang et al. 2019b). Cell 
membrane coatings initially emerged as a strategy to enhance nanoparticle drug delivery by reducing 
immune cell recognition and clearance of circulating particles. In 2011, Hu et al. first demonstrated 
the use of a top-down approach to generate erythrocyte-coated polymeric nanoparticles in which 
the membrane components retained their structure and functional activity. The authors used the 
erythrocyte membrane coating to disguise nanoparticles from circulating phagocytic immune cells 
to extend their plasma half-life. More recently, a pH-responsive erythrocyte membrane-coated 
nanogel was synthesized to deliver combination chemoimmunotherapy of paclitaxel and IL-2 with 
enhanced tumor accumulation and potent antineoplastic activity (Song et al. 2017). Paclitaxel was 
encapsulated within the nanogel and promoted the ICD of tumor cells. IL-2 is an FDA-approved 
cytokine therapy that supports the survival and proliferation of cytotoxic immune effector cells. 
Here, the membrane coating also acted as the delivery material for IL-2 as the membrane allowed 
for increased adsorption of the protein on the surface of the particles (nanosponge activity) and 
provided glycoproteins that could directly bind to IL-2. Membrane-coatings have also been derived 
from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and natural killer cells to enhance nanoparticle tumor 
penetration and tumor-cell homing by improving nanoparticle immune compatibility in the tumor 
microenvironment (Deng et al. 2018, Chen et al. 2021, Zhang et al. 2021). A recent study showed 
that this property enabled improved photodynamic immunotherapeutic activity of TAM membrane￾coated particles loaded with a photosensitizer (Chen et al. 2021). Furthermore, the TAM membrane 
coating depleted colony stimulating factor 1, an immunosuppressive molecule secreted by tumor 
cells to reduce macrophage activation, enhancing the polarization of macrophages to a more 
inflammatory state. The ability of cell membrane-coatings to sequester tumor-secreted or pathogen￾secreted immunomodulatory factors can be used to modulate pathologic cell-cell communications 
impacting host immunity across many disease states. 
Cell membrane coatings can also be used to enhance interactions between nanoparticles and 
specific cell types as these coatings retain a variety of cell-cell interaction molecules, such as 
adhesion ligands, and other functional proteins that allow them to strongly interact with and target 
specific cell types. Parodi et al. coated nanoporous silicon particles with leukocyte membranes to 
avoid immune cell clearance in circulation and to enhance preferential binding to and transport of 
nanoparticles across inflamed endothelium into tumors (Parodi et al. 2012). Platelet membrane￾coated nanoparticles were developed to mimic the ability of platelets to selectively adhere to 
damaged vasculature and certain pathogens (Hu et al. 2015). In addition to reducing particle uptake 
by phagocytic cells, the platelet membrane coating prevented nanoparticle-mediated complement 
activation and achieved better therapeutic efficacy compared to noncoated nanoparticles and 
erythrocyte-coated nanoparticles in mouse models of coronary restenosis and systemic bacterial 
infection. The ability to tailor nanoparticle-immune complement interactions can be exploited to 
enhance or reduce innate immune activation. Recently, platelet membrane-cloaked nanoparticles 
containing the innate immune TLR agonist, resiquimod (R848), were delivered intratumorally to Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 263
enhance solid tumor immunotherapy (Bahmani et al. 2021). Like platelets, host cells can also have 
adhesive interactions with pathogens and microbes. Angsantikul et al. cloaked PLGA nanoparticles 
encapsulating clarithromycin in gastric epithelial cell membranes to specifically target Helicobacter 
pylori (a bacteria that can cause chronic inflammation and increase the risk of developing gastric 
ulcers and cancers) to leverage the adhesive interaction between the bacterial pathogen and the 
host cells (Angsantikul et al. 2018). This resulted in improved H. pylori killing in an in vivo model 
of H. pylori infection as compared to untargeted nanoparticles, free antibiotics, and untreated 
control. The biomimetic strategy of leveraging the adhesive interactions between host cells and 
pathogenic agents to improve nanomedicine targeting through host cell membrane coatings could 
be used to treat a variety of infectious diseases and to modulate the gut microbiome to improve 
the outcomes of immunotherapy. Finally, hybrid membrane coatings derived from multiple cells 
have also been developed to take advantage of the distinct functionalities derived from the unique 
surface molecules present on different cell types. A dual membrane coating derived from platelets 
and cancer stem cells was used to enhance immunogenic cell death-inducing photothermal therapy 
in squamous cell carcinoma by using homotypic adhesion molecules derived from tumor cells and 
antiphagocytic surface molecules derived from platelets to achieve better tumor accumulation of 
iron oxide nanoparticles (Bu et al. 2019). 
Nanoparticles can also be used as cell-mimetic decoys for viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic 
immunotherapy. These decoys can be used to decrease viral load in acute infections by preventing 
viruses from interacting with host cells and facilitating their uptake by immune cells or removal from 
the body. Viral infection, for example, is highly dependent on the ability of viral capsid proteins, 
such as the spike protein, to bind to surface molecules on host cells. By cloaking nanoparticles in 
the membranes of host cells targeted by a given virus, the nanoparticles can detain viruses from 
infecting host cells. This approach was used by Wei et al. to generate CD4+ T cell mimicking 
nanoparticles that prevented viral envelope protein-mediated T cell killing and enabled host cell 
viral neutralization mechanisms for effective HIV immunotherapy (Wei et al. 2018). Difficulties 
in overcoming the genetic diversity of viruses, like HIV, could potentially be overcome using this 
approach. Another decoy approach used erythrocyte membrane-coated nanoparticles to sequester 
pathogen-derived exotoxins to prevent red blood cell lysis to treat bacterial and fungal infections 
(Hu et al. 2013a). Hu et al. showed that the nanoparticle-trapped pore-forming toxins could result 
in nanoparticle-mediated in situ vaccination (Hu et al. 2013b). This allows many advantages over 
traditional vaccine approaches, including that the toxins are displayed to the immune system in 
their natural setting and conformation. Using a non-biomimetic approach, Sigl et al. developed 
programmable self-assembling icosahedral shells from DNA that were able to trap hepatitis B virus 
particles and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) in vitro and that could neutralize infectious AAVs 
exposed to human cells (Sigl et al. 2021). Given the modularity of this approach, other binders could 
be assessed easily and targeting moieties such as antibodies and aptamers could be incorporated to 
enhance affinity and specificity through multivalency. Together, these results show how nanomaterial 
strategies can be used to interact with and neutralize pathogenic threats. 
5.3 Enabling biomimetic strategies through cell-based delivery
The use of cells as nanomaterial carriers enables a novel range of biomimetic functions that can 
enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle-based immunotherapy. Using red blood cells (RBCs) as 
carriers, Ukvide et al. mimicked the innate function of RBCs to capture circulating blood pathogens 
and present them to immune cells in the spleen by designing erythrocyte-based nanoparticles for 
the delivery of adjuvant-free nanovaccines (Ukidve et al. 2020). Spleen delivery was engineered, 
in part, by increasing the antigen-conjugated nanoparticle loading on the surface of the RBCs to 
induce erythrocyte stiffening and deformability. These changes in the cell membrane increased the 
nanoparticle resistance to being dislodged by shearing from the lung capillaries and prompted their 264 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
increased capture in the spleen, potentially due to the accelerated clearance of RBCs. This biomimetic 
approach showed utility as a prophylactic vaccine for tumor prevention that could be extended to 
other disease types. Platelets also have several targeting and biological mechanisms that make them 
useful as drug delivery carriers such as their specific adherence to damaged vascular endothelium 
and their ability to secrete vesicles after activation (Wang et al. 2017). Lv et al. leveraged these 
functions when they used platelets as a drug delivery vector for photothermal block copolymer 
nanoparticles and the innate immune adjuvant R837 (Lv et al. 2021). Damaged tumor-associated 
endothelium attracted therapy-bearing platelets to initially aggregate at the tumor site. Nanoparticle￾enhanced photothermal treatment of the lesion further induced vessel damage driving a positive 
feedback cascade to further enhance nanoparticle-bearing platelet accumulation at the target site 
(Figures 8A-B). The hyperthermia treatment also induced immunogenic cell death, which synergized 
with the R837 therapy. Furthermore, activated platelets released nanosized vesicles capable of 
penetrating deep into the tumor to mediate photothermal nanoparticle and immunostimulant 
delivery (Figure 8C). This multi-faceted strategy was safe and efficacious in multiple models of 
murine cancer (Figure 8D). Wang et al. also used the postoperative wound homing and activation￾stimulated particle secretion abilities of platelets to enhance delivery of surface-conjugated aPD-1 
(Wang et al. 2017). This strategy prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice and prevented 
postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.
5.4 Nanomaterial backpacks for enhanced cellular immunotherapy
In addition to enhancing drug delivery, the linking of nanomaterials to adoptive cell or engineered 
cell therapies can result in effective combination immunotherapy. The nanocarriers and their 
conjugation chemistry are engineered such that therapy is released at a controlled rate to stimulate 
the cell in a pseudo-autocrine fashion or in response to environmental or external stimuli at the 
target site such that cell activity is induced or enhanced at a specific location or to modify the local 
microenvironment (Irvine and Dane 2020). Directly linking the nanomedicines to the cell therapies 
allows the biodistribution of the molecular payload to mirror that of the cellular therapy, allowing 
for improved synergy and lower doses in comparison to free drug combination therapy. This 
significantly reduces the potential for off-target toxicity of potent immunomodulatory drugs, like 
IL-15, that are lethal when administered freely (Berger et al. 2009). This is an alternative strategy 
to genetically engineering the cell to express the therapeutic payload of interest. In comparison to 
genetic engineering, the use of nanoparticle strategies to facilitate combination therapy between 
cellular therapy and molecular therapy (cytokines, bispecific T cell engagers, etc.) allows for control 
over the dose and release rate of therapy. One limitation of this strategy is that it involves ex vivo
manipulation of immune cells, whereas in vivo genetic engineering strategies using nanomaterials 
(discussed later in this chapter) are being developed that could allow for more facile manufacturing 
processes, while achieving similar efficacy. However, such in vivo engineering strategies remain in 
earlier clinical development and are limited in the amount of genetic cargo that can be loaded. 
Two challenges with cellular immunotherapy are the poor expansion of adoptive or 
engineered cells in vivo and their inability to maintain activity in the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (Gong et al. 2021). Cellular backpacks have been used to co-deliver cytokines to 
stimulate adoptive cell proliferation and small molecule immune and metabolic adjuvants to support 
T cell activity in immunosuppressive disease microenvironments. In a seminal paper, Tang et al. 
created a carrier-free, redox-responsive nanogel by crosslinking IL-15 super agonist complexes 
using disulfide bonds and anchored this nanogel to the CD45 surface receptor of T cells (Tang et al. 
2018). The redox-responsive disulfide bonds allowed for release of the cytokine payload following 
an increase in the reduction potential of the cell membrane because of TCR engagement by antigen￾MHC complexes in the tumor, coupling drug release to tissue-specific signaling. Conjugation of the 
nanocarriers to the CD45 surface receptor allowed these materials to traffic to the immune synapse Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 265 munotherapy nanoparticle- outcomes. unotherapeutic imm for improved vasculature immune response in the tumor draining lymph nodes IHC analysis for model of breast , 7(13).) . representative of photoim the generation cell maturation; demonstrating therapy NP-platelets in a primary and a metastatic .

during T cell activation, demonstrating the importance of anchor molecule selection. When injected 
intravenously into mice bearing melanoma tumors, the nanomaterial backpack therapy led to a 
significant increase in adoptive T cell expansion in comparison to free IL-15SA and significantly 
reduced the toxicity associated with systemic delivery of supporting cytokine therapy. A similar 
strategy used cellular backpacks for the pseudo-autocrine delivery of interferon gamma to adoptively 
transferred macrophages, which allowed these cells to maintain their proinflammatory phenotype 
deep within the immunosuppressive milieu of the tumor when the backpacked cells were injected 
intratumorally (Shields et al. 2020). The therapy also repolarized endogenous tumor-associated 
macrophages to a proinflammatory state via a bystander effect, removing a significant source of 
microenvironment immunosuppression. This led to a heightened anti-tumor response characterized 
by smaller tumor burden with reduced metastases. To combat the metabolic dysfunction of T cells 
in the hostile, immunosuppressive TME, Zhang and coworkers used avasimibe-loaded liposomal 
backpacks to maintain engineered T cell activation and function in the metabolically restricted tumor 
microenvironments of melanoma and glioblastoma (Hao et al. 2020). Avasimibe inhibits cholesterol 
esterification increasing the concentration of cholesterol in the T cell membrane, which impacts 
immune synapse formation and signaling and enhances T cell activation, potentiating the anti-tumor 
response (Yang et al. 2016). Treatment with backpacked T cells increased the antitumor efficacy 
of therapy in glioblastoma and melanoma tumor-bearing mice, including complete eradication of 
orthotopic glioblastoma in 60% of mice treated with this therapy compared to 0% for all other 
therapies. In a separate study, liposomes encapsulating an A2a adenosine receptor antagonist were 
conjugated to the surface of engineered T cells to prevent hypofunction due to T cell inactivation by 
adenosine, an immunosuppressive molecule found abundantly in the TME due to its derivatization 
from extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by ecto-nucleases (Siriwon et al. 2018). Future 
strategies using nanoparticle cell backpacks could enable adoptive cell monitoring and tracking and 
allow for in situ modulation of engineered cells to combat disease evolution.
5.5 Engineering immune cells with enhanced functions in vivo
Numerous studies have shown that non-viral nanomaterials can enhance the intracellular delivery 
of genetic therapies to the cytosol and nucleus in vivo (Ditto et al. 2009, Oberli et al. 2016, Shae 
et al. 2019). Nanomaterial properties such as charge and polymer buffering capacity can be used 
to enhance the cytosolic delivery of cargo by rupturing the endosome (Eppler and Jewell 2019). 
A unique application that this enables is the in vivo engineering of cellular immunotherapies. In a 
proof-of-concept study, Smith et al. demonstrated the efficacy of this approach by engineering and 
expanding circulating host T cells in vivo using polymeric anti-CD3e fragment antibody-targeted 
nanoparticles that co-delivered DNA plasmids encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and a 
piggyBac transposase (Smith et al. 2017). The polymer was further functionalized with peptides that 
enhanced the nuclear import and gene transfer of the genetic cargo. Targeting of the nanoparticles 
to circulating T cells with the aCD3 Fab’2 increased accumulation of the nanoparticles in lymphoid 
organs, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and decreased accumulation in the liver. 
Further, the combination of the nanoparticle and synthetic biology design elements engineered CAR 
expression in endogenous T cells that persisted for weeks and achieved efficacy comparable to that 
of CAR T cells produced via standard ex vivo modification methods in a mouse model of leukemia. 
Further work is needed to determine whether this method can achieve sufficient expansion and 
activity of engineered T cells for application to solid tumors. Despite targeting of T cells with anti￾CD3e moieties, one challenge that remains is reducing the uptake of nanomedicines in off-target 
circulating cells (and their associated toxicities). In a follow-up work, the same group described the 
delivery of mRNA encoding CAR or T cell receptors using polymeric nanoparticles to transiently 
engineer disease-specific T cells in vivo (Parayath et al. 2020). mRNA has many advantages 
over DNA-based systems including that it is transiently expressed without the need for genomic Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 267
integration and has higher target protein expression efficiency, which together results in reduced 
risks for genotoxicity and provides greater control over therapy pharmacokinetics. In several cancer 
mouse models, including solid tumors, these nanoparticles achieved similar therapeutic outcomes 
to ex vivo engineered T cells. This study demonstrates how the choice of genetic material cargo 
can influence the duration and potential safety of in vivo engineered cells. Together, these studies 
demonstrate how nanoparticle-mediated delivery of genetic material can engineer effective T cell 
therapies in vivo. This strategy provides more timely treatment options for patients using traditional 
intravenous administration to deliver cellular therapy and is more cost effective than existing ex vivo
engineered cell manufacturing strategies, making it well positioned to transform the implementation 
of engineered cell immunotherapies clinically. 
Besides introducing antigen-specific effector moieties, nanoparticle-mediated genetic 
engineering approaches can be applied to alter the functional phenotype and activity of circulating 
cells. Cell therapies both benefit from and can be derided by their ability to integrate complex signaling 
from healthy and pathological biologic environments, as these signals can enhance or prevent their 
therapeutic activities. In cancer, tumor-associated macrophages often adopt a pro-tumorigenic, 
anti-inflammatory phenotype due to immunosuppressive signaling in the tumor microenvironment, 
causing further immunosuppression and disease progression (Matovani et al. 2002). One therapeutic 
strategy is to repolarize these cells in vivo to a phenotype that promotes anti-tumor immunity. Zhang 
et al. used mannose-targeted polymeric nanoparticles to deliver mRNA encoding transcription 
factors (IRF5 and its activating kinase IKKB) that reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophages 
to an anti-tumor phenotype in vivo without causing systemic toxicities or disrupting immune 
homeostasis (Zhang et al. 2019a). Reduced metastatic burden and increased survival were seen 
when this strategy was used to treat metastatic disseminated ovarian cancer using intraperitoneal 
delivery and disseminated pulmonary melanoma using intravenous administration. These outcomes 
resulted from increased tumor-associated macrophage polarization to an inflammatory phenotype 
and from an increase in the focal clustering of lymphocytes infiltrating or surrounding the tumors, 
suggesting that the induced macrophage polarization changes can alter lymphocyte migration and 
tumor infiltration to enhance therapeutic efficacy. In an alternative strategy, Ledo et al. used siRNA￾encapsulating nanoparticles releasing a macrophage chemoattractant, C-C chemokine ligand 2, to 
preferentially lure myeloid cells to be transfected by the particles, allowing for efficient knockdown 
of an immunosuppressive gene, C/EBPb, in these cells (Ledo et al. 2019). Beyond myeloid cells, 
Dan Peer and colleagues have demonstrated in multiple studies the use of lipid nanoparticles for 
the in vivo genetic modulation of T cells and tumor cells for therapeutic purposes (Ramishetti et al. 
2015, Kedmi et al. 2018, Veiga et al. 2018). In one study, using systemically administered anti-CD4 
antibody targeted lipid nanoparticles, this group was able to efficiently modulate T cell function 
across several lymphoid organs including the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow (Ramishetti 
et al. 2015). They showed that the efficacy of this therapy was dependent on efficient nanoparticle 
internalization soon after therapy administration. Together, these approaches highlight the ability of 
nanoparticle-based gene therapies to transfect and modify immune cells in vivo to achieve therapeutic 
outcomes. Given the complex genetic, environmental, and pathologic interactions impacting 
immune cell phenotype and function in disease, this approach offers a powerful method to engineer 
therapeutic responses directly using current and emerging genetic engineering technologies. 
6. Outlook and conclusions
The generation of efficacious immune responses requires the proper coordination of multiple steps 
across different locations in the body and at defined timescales to generate therapeutic effects. 
Building off the use of nanomaterials to deliver conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and 
antimicrobial agents, the first generation of nanomaterial immunotherapies has leveraged material￾based systems to alter immunotherapy biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of monotherapies and 268 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
combination therapies to improve safety and efficacy. This includes tailored nanoscale chemistry 
formulations and carrier-based delivery approaches that enhance delivery of therapy to specific 
organs and cells, allowing for targeted genetic and molecular modulation of these cells and tissues 
for generation of effective immune responses. It also includes the use of nanoparticle structure to 
enable combination delivery of immunomodulatory therapies with intrinsically different properties 
and the use of polymer chemistry to control the spatiotemporal kinetics of therapy delivery. Other 
approaches seek to simplify the formulation components of nanomaterial immunotherapies by using 
immunomodulatory polymers or by programming self-assembling materials from immunomodulatory 
therapies like antibodies to enhance the translatability and reduce the manufacturing complexity of 
nanoscale immunotherapies.
However, the inherent outcomes of immunotherapy are more complex than conventional 
therapies as immunotherapy seeks to engineer a long-lasting, living response by reprogramming 
immune cells and other microenvironment components and generating memory, while conventional 
approaches have focused on the diseased cell or pathogen alone, aiming to induce targeted diseased 
cell or microbial pathogen death, itself a difficult task. As a result, effective immunotherapy requires 
controlled modulation of multiple steps in the initial signaling process as well as the ability to respond 
to different dynamic regulatory mechanisms enacted by immune and other host cells and to counter 
different evolutionary immune escape mechanisms enacted by diseased cells in response to therapy. 
This will require the design of more dynamic and precise nanomaterial delivery systems. Further, 
to leverage the specificity of the adaptive immune response, the provided or generated antigens and 
the resultant immune cell repertoire need to provide sufficient coverage of disease clonal or variant 
epitopes (genetic heterogeneity) and their evolution such that disease is eradicated or controlled by 
the induced response and that this response is durable to prevent disease recurrence. For example, 
in in situ vaccination approaches, are the elicited antigens sufficiently immunogenic and shared and 
displayed by the population of cancer cells that were not susceptible to immunogenic cell death? 
Will the efficacy and breadth of bystander activation be sufficient to control or eliminate diseased 
cells not sharing these antigens? While these are questions of disease immunobiology, their answers 
govern the required drug delivery profiles of therapy, such as the targeted cell uptake profile and 
spatiotemporal kinetics of therapy. Finally, heightened control over the site of nanotherapeutic action 
at the subcellular to organ scale is required of the next generation of nanomaterial immunotherapies 
to reduce toxicity and improve efficacy. Further study into the impact of route of administration, 
administration timing, and repeat dosing of antigens and immunomodulatory molecules on the 
nature, extent, breadth, and durability of the invoked immune response will also complement efforts 
centered on altering nanomaterial biodistribution. Together, these illustrate the on-going challenges 
associated with engineering controlled, durable, and safe immunomodulation using nanomaterial 
therapies to eradicate or control disease. 
To meet these challenges, the next generation of nanomaterial immunotherapies has begun 
to explore the design of dynamically responsive materials to overcome biological barriers and 
the design of combination approaches that integrate biological entities (cell membrane coatings, 
biological carrier-based delivery, etc.) and/or synthetic biology engineering with nanomaterials as 
illustrated in the preceding sections. To further address issues in overcoming biological barriers, a 
deeper understanding of nanomaterial-biological interactions is required, as these will determine 
how material-based strategies can be designed to leverage these interactions to enable novel 
applications or to avoid these interactions to increase the efficiency and specificity of delivery. 
Efforts to understand protein corona formation and active targeting agent interactions discussed 
earlier in this chapter underscore some of the ongoing research efforts in this area. Further insight 
into the immunobiology of disease, including disease-specific molecular and cellular compositions, 
the spatial arrangements of these components in the disease microenvironment, the dynamics of 
these populations across time and therapy, and the intricate signaling networks between these 
components and with other systemic immunomodulators (like the gut microbiome), enabled by Engineering Immunity to Disease Using Nanotechnology 269
advances in single cell omics and multiplexed bioimaging technologies will provide more precise 
resolution of potential targets and strategies for nanomaterial immunotherapies to engineer in a 
given disease state and patient population. These technologies can also be used to enhance our 
understanding of the complex immunobiological responses invoked by nanomaterial-biological 
interactions. Nanomaterials, in turn, can be further developed as imaging agents and diagnostic 
tools to complement the function of these omics and imaging technologies and to allow for in vivo
monitoring of immune responses to therapy across time and anatomical locations. Advances in 
these areas will enhance our ability to engineer biology (including immunology) with molecular 
and cellular precision, which can be used to impart supraphysiological functions or to better control 
endogenous agents, improving our ability to combat disease evolution and immunotherapeutic 
outcomes. As a result, the ability of nanomaterials to precisely deliver genetic immunoengineering 
therapies or to control and support the function of engineered biological therapies is of critical 
importance. The continued interplay between materials and synthetic biology therapies will directly 
enable the therapeutic application of these technologies in patients across a broader spectrum of 
diseases.
In summary, the tunable properties of nanomaterials have been leveraged to increase the 
efficacy, safety, and durability of immunotherapies by altering their delivery profile across time and 
space and by enabling novel mechanisms of action that can synergize with molecular and cellular 
immunotherapies. The future development of nanomaterial immunotherapies relies on our ability to 
understand and engineer nanomaterial-biological interactions throughout the nanomaterial’s time in 
the body and within the context of disease pathology and immunobiology. This will require continued 
synergy between the fields of materials engineering, synthetic biology, basic science, and clinical 
medicine to elucidate fundamental principles and innovative applications that drive the efficacy and 
safety of these nanomaterial immunotherapies. Ultimately, this research will provide new diagnostic 
and therapeutic options to patients across disease types, delivering on nanotechnology’s promise 
to engineer precision delivery for precision medicine in immunotherapy applications and beyond.

Technology

1. Introduction to tissue engineering and organs-on-a-chip
With more than a century of being researched and applied, cell culture has been one of the main 
milestones within biomedical science, after providing a plethora of insights about fundamental 
cell and tissue biology. Besides, cell culture has offered a surfeit of in vitro models for various 
pharmacological and toxicological studies, becoming, along with animal models, a standard within 
pharmaceutical preclinical research. However, as the development of larger numbers of conventional 
drugs, biopharmaceuticals, and (more recently) nanopharmaceuticals are facing stricter regulations 
and clinical studies, the transition from preclinical models to humans started presenting enormous 
difficulties (Van Norman 2019, Hingorani et al. 2019). Due to the limitations of two-dimensional 
(2D) cultures mimicking precise phenotypes of human diseases, a paradigm shift in the use of 
test models is required (Langhans 2018). Accordingly, tissue engineering has offered several 
tridimensional and dynamical culture models capable of providing more valuable insights than 
their bidimensional counterparts. Among these models, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) stand as highly 
propitious in vitro models, due to their ability to mimic the cellular microenvironment and interorgan 
interactions while keeping control of inlets, outlets, and monitoring through various biosensors 
(Zhang et al. 2018). In this chapter, a detailed explanation of the main components of an OOC will 
be outlined, in addition to a few potential applications in basic and clinical research. Furthermore, 
some biological key considerations will be offered for a successful chip design, in addition to the 
abundance of potentially useful materials and fabrication technologies. Finally, there will be a more 
detailed analysis of particular biomimetic models and a discussion about the main challenges these 
will face in their adoption in industry and the clinic. 
2. Overview of organ-on-a-chip technology
An organ-on-a-chip is a tissue engineering technology that emulates the structural and/or functional 
microenvironmental characteristics of a tissue, organ, or inter-organ system that employs on-chip 280 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
microfluidic and microfabrication technologies. In contrast with conventional bidimensional or 
tridimensional cell cultures, OOCs are ad hoc engineered systems that consider a diversity of physical 
(spatial localization and confinement, shear stress, scaffold stiffness, etc.), chemical (nutrients, 
hormones, and growth factors), and biological (use of different cells in co-culture) features all at 
once, achieving a closer degree of fidelity of an in vivo model (Zhang et al. 2018, Sosa-Hernández 
et al. 2018). Furthermore, OOCs open the possibility of generating “more human” alternatives than 
traditional in vivo models like mice, offering greater flexibility regarding the cell phenotype and the 
anatomical and physiological ratios of organ sizes and flows (Aziz et al. 2017, Van Den Berg et al. 
2019). Representatively, OOC technology can be illustrated by four constituents:
Structural and connective tissue components
The structural and connective tissue component (or “stroma”) mimics the interface composed of 
epithelium, connective tissue, blood vessels, and other elements that do not play a direct functional 
role in the system (Sontheimer-Phelps et al. 2019). This constituent is relevant to mimic because 
it represents both an interface and a barrier for nutrients, hormones, drugs, and toxins (Figure 1). 
Compared to 2D culture, where all cells have contact with external molecules homogeneously and 
indiscriminately, stromal interfaces and barriers play a vital role in pharmacokinetics and cytotoxic 
profiles due to the heterogeneous distribution and diffusion (Miao et al. 2015, Hua et al. 2017). The 
correct modeling of these components might play an important duty in developing strategies to 
pass through nearly impenetrable barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier and the fibrotic stroma of 
pancreatic cancer (Thomas and Radhakrishnan 2019, Zakharova et al. 2020). 
Functional tissue component
Contrary to the structural and connective components of the culture, the functional component (or 
“parenchyma”) is made up of cells that emulate an intrinsic physiological activity of the mimicked 
organ. Invariably of its nature, these cells are usually very dependent on three-dimensionality, cell 
density, heterotypic and homotypic interactions, and mechanical, electrical, or biochemical stimuli 
Figure 1. Traditional organ-on-a-chip design for interface modeling. (A) The system is composed of two different substrates 
with two main microfluidic channels, with their respective inlets and outlets. Every substrate will have a channel representing 
a biological phase, denoted with either a blue or red color in the figure. (B) Each channel will perfuse the necessary 
components for the culture of a specific tissue of that phase, which will be separated by a thin, porous membrane. The 
phases will also be surrounded by vacuum chambers that might simulate mechanical stress or stretching. (C) The obtained 
system mimics the biological interface in a dynamical and three-dimensional microenvironment, allowing the study of the 
interaction between phases and the transfer of various components, such as hormones, nutrients, and drugs. Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 281
that will allow the best imitation of specific phenotypes (Huh et al. 2011, Bhatia and Ingber 2014, 
Kaarj and Yoon 2019). The more biologically faithful the OOC, the more predictive power the model 
will have in experimentation. For this component of the OOC, synergy with other technologies such 
as organoids is particularly useful (Takebe et al. 2017).
Microfluidic and micromachined components
Arguably, the insertion of microfluidics into tissue engineering has been one of the main 
achievements in the field overall. Without microfluidics, OOC technology would probably never 
have proliferated. In this field, volumes are handled within the micro/nanoscale (generally bounded 
in the 10–9 to 10–6 L range) due to their strict laminar flow regime, practically devoid of turbulence 
(Sosa-Hernández et al. 2018). This phenomenon is easily understood when analyzing the intrinsic 
low Reynolds Number—a dimensionless numerical ratio between inertial forces (responsible for 
vortices and eddy currents) to viscous forces (which force the flow to stay smooth), with the latter 
being the predominant force (Rehm et al. 2008). Laminar flows are scarce on the macroscale and 
present peculiar characteristics such as lack of mixing between parallel flows and the presence of 
surface tension and interfacial charges. These phenomena can be wisely used for the generation of 
concentration gradients, the creation of discrete emulsions and droplets, and other several events that 
would be extremely difficult to replicate on a macro scale (Wang et al. 2017, Ji et al. 2018, Rosser 
et al. 2019). For the flow control within the chip, micropumps and microvalves are classically used. 
Besides, the presence of surface charges on the microchannel walls also opens the possibility of 
employing electroosmotic flows, extending the flexibility of flow control (Kaarj and Yoon 2019). 
Notwithstanding the advantages of microfluidics, chip design is not a trivial task, and it should 
always take a careful approach when designing the inlets, outlets and internal microchannels and 
compartments that will satisfy the requirements of the system, such as the input of nutrients and 
growth factors, the output of waste, and internal channels for inter-organic interaction. Moreover, 
other components for mechanical and/or electrical stimulation may be inserted into the chip design, 
to assist cell differentiation and correct functioning of the parenchymal culture (Kaarj and Yoon 
2019). 
Sensing and monitoring components
Ultimately, without the capacity of monitoring and quantifying relevant data and experimental 
parameters, organs-on-a-chip would only remain as elegant (and quite expensive) proofs of concept. 
The insertion of biosensors allows the quantification and real-time monitoring of important culture 
parameters, such as the amount of oxygen (both dissolved and gaseous), pH, temperature, glucose 
and lactate concentrations, cytokines levels, mechanical and electrical activity, and other countless 
biomarkers (Shaegh et al. 2016, Ferrari et al. 2020). Besides cell metabolism and standard cell 
culture parameters, other output signals related to tissue integrity can be studied. An important 
example of the latter is the measurement of the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which 
is related to the integrity and permeability of the tissue endothelium (Odijk et al. 2015)
3. Applications for organs-on-a-chip
The high-throughput nature of organs-on-a-chip makes them attractive systems for various 
biomedical areas, ranging from basic research to potential medical applications. For an organ￾on-a-chip to be relevant, the tissue interface, the parenchyma, the microchannel system, and the 
sensors must be optimal for the intended purpose. For instance, a chip that may perfectly emulate 
the physiology of an organ might not be the best model for drug testing if it lacks important stromal 
interfaces for pharmacokinetic profiles. Before starting any design, the application must be well 
outlined. 282 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Biological modeling and biomimetics
Due to the difficulty of studying deeply and in real-time the plethora of physiological mechanisms 
in humans, a considerable part of our understanding of some biochemical and molecular processes 
might be markedly limited due to our dependence on animal and traditional cell culture models. On 
the other hand, some physiological mechanisms are massively complex to study in vivo. Therefore, 
the use of OOCs has had recent contributions in elucidating important knowledge about these 
processes. A particular example to highlight is the work of Shik Mun et al., who modeled a pancreas￾on-a-chip model to study the relationship between the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator protein and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. For this model, the researchers isolated and 
cultured pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and pancreatic islets from patients with pancreatitis, and 
studied the interaction between both cells, finding a considerable decrease in insulin production 
(Shik Mun et al. 2019). In parallel, Trapecar et al. developed a multiple interconnected human micro￾physiological system (MPS) capable of mimicking the complex gut-liver-immune axis for the study 
of the interaction between organs in complex pathogenesis. In this biomimetic system, an ulcerative 
colitis (UC) gut model was connected to a healthy liver model, with circulating T cells between the 
systems. Thusly, this ex vivo model was utilized to elucidate the inflammatory regulation processes 
between T cells and short-chain fatty acids derived from the microbiome (Trapecar et al. 2020). 
Drug discovery and screening
Although the new generations of drugs have become more advanced, the number of new 
pharmaceuticals available on the market has not grown proportionally. For instance, nanomedicine 
has presented a variety of nanosystems capable of improving the solubility, adsorption, cellular 
uptake, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tissue selectivity of certain drugs, while also decreasing 
their toxicity. Nonetheless, only a discreet number of them have reached clinical use. In 2017, the 
FDA had only approved 50 nanodrugs for medical use in the US (Ventola 2017). Adverse drug 
events are another clinical threat, since several negative medical outcomes cannot be predicted 
in traditional preclinical models. Therefore, the need for advanced in vitro models that will better 
represent the pharmacological effects opens a crucial opportunity for organs-on-a-chip. Due to the 
dense three-dimensional nature of some of these templates, OOCs offer a meaningful opportunity 
to assess the efficacy of pharmacological strategies to cross diverse biological barriers, such as 
the stromal barriers of tumors (Tanaka and Kano 2018, Sontheimer-Phelps et al. 2019). Added to 
this, the ability of OOCs to control gradients of nutrients, growth factors, and hormones allows the 
biomodelling of intricate, spatiotemporal-varying processes such as hormonal cycles. An illustrative 
example is the work of Xiao and coworkers, who presented a “menstrual-cycle-on-a-chip” capable 
of mimicking the whole hormonal profile. Being a system capable of evaluating an exclusive 
female phenotype at specific timepoints, it offers a suitability that would be practically impossible 
to replicate in traditional cultures (Xiao et al. 2017). 
Toxicological screening
Organs-on-a-chip also offers a unique opportunity in the development of various toxicological tests. 
In contrast to pharmacological tests, toxicological tests are not feasible to escalate to clinical trials, 
making the findings of advanced in vitro models much more valuable (Pridgeon et al. 2018). A 
clear example of these applications is in the evaluation of air pollutants. In this regard, the team 
of Xu et al. proposed a 3D lung model to evaluate the effect of particulate matter smaller than 
2.5 micrometers. In their system proposal, they cultured endothelial and epithelial cells in a chip 
design analogous to the alveolar-blood barrier, of which they were able to assess the inflammatory 
response, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytotoxicity, and changes in tissue Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 283
permeability (Xu et al. 2020). Another example is presented by Bovard et al., who designed a model 
for assessing acute and chronic aerosol exposure. Their bi-organic lung/liver was composed of 
hepatic spheroids and human bronchial epithelial cells cultured with the air-liquid interface method. 
To test this system, aflatoxin B1 was supplied to observe the role of liver cells in reducing the 
cytotoxicity of the in vitro model (Bovard et al. 2018). 
Regenerative medicine
The evolution of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering has gone hand in hand from the 
beginning. Attain this objective, OOC technology presents an invaluable opportunity to emulate 
and study processes such as neuron recovery, tissue regeneration, and cellular differentiation, 
besides being a potentially ideal element for quality assurance in regenerative medicine trials 
(Harink et al. 2013, Haring et al. 2017, Pasqualini et al. 2017). As an example, Agrawal, Aung, 
and Varghese published their progress in skeletal muscle in vitro modeling, proposing a system 
capable of emulating a muscle injury model. Apart from being a useful proof-of-concept, relevant 
mechanical data such as the elastic modulus, strain profile, and muscle passive tension could be 
computed. After characterizing the model, they tested it with a cardiotoxin to evaluate structural 
and mechanical changes. Among these changes, some important events were observed such as 
cytoskeleton disruption and a decrease in passive tension (Agrawal et al. 2017). Finally, it should 
not be ignored that OOCs may have a primary role in tissue transplantation. Due to their ability to 
differentiate cells to desired phenotypes, it might be possible in the future a synergistic combination 
of OOCs with bioreactor technology to generate customizable tissue, avoiding the use of risky 
allografts, and offering a more advanced version of current in vitro autografts. 
4. Biological and physical features of an organ-on-a-chip device
Organs-on-a-chip emerges from the interdisciplinary approach between areas such as medicine, 
biotechnology, materials science, microfluidics, and micromachining. Therefore, the success of any 
model will require a comprehensive and strenuous approach. The OOC can simulate the physiological 
environment of a certain organ function such as regulation of concentration gradients, shear force, 
cell patterning, tissue-boundaries, and tissue-organ interactions. To do so, it is necessary to deeply 
understand the organ in its two major states: homeostasis and pathology (Beckwitt et al. 2018). The 
responses of the body to external and internal stimulus is highly complex, since they depend on 
the interplay of components from lower levels of biological organization including cells, proteins, 
and genes. Thus, the study of physiological events by using only in vivo models is difficult and 
considerably inefficient. For decades, traditional two-dimensional cell culture systems represented 
an accurate method for cell biology research, bringing light to cell metabolism knowledge. 
Nevertheless, 2D systems are not suitable to study physiological responses of tissues/organs, intra￾organ interactions, and microenvironmental factors, requiring replication and verification on in vivo 
models. On the other hand, species differences between animal models and humans represent a 
pivotal key feature that determines the lack of reproducibility in human experiments. The latter 
could be attributed to the inadequate understanding of the human tissue environment and, ergo, 
the inaccurate predictions of the overall effects. OOC technology avoids these obstacles by giving 
an accurate physiological platform that resembles more accurately the human systems (Md Ali 
et al. 2018). As a rule of thumb, the more reliable a model will be, the more predictive power it 
will possess. However, the practicality must also be considered, based on clear objectives of the 
biomimetic system. Making a more detailed system may yield greater fidelity (although not in all 
cases), but at the same time, it also may present substantial complexity in the design, assembly, 
maintenance, and scaling to an industrial level.284 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
5. Biological features
Biological scaling
Among some of the basic biological parameters to consider is the correct biological scaling of 
the organ or inter-organic system. Despite the lack of scientific consensus on how scaling should 
be realized for microengineered tissues, there are a series of proposals to respect anatomical and 
physiological relationships such as the classical allometric scaling, and the organ mass-residence 
time approach (Moraes et al. 2013, Wikswo et al. 2013). It must also be taken into consideration that, 
while respecting the mass and volume/area ratios, considerable changes in cell metabolism between 
in vitro and in vivo models may distort these relationships, forcing the researcher to perform a series 
of empirical tests (Moraes et al. 2013). Also, maintaining the tissue-to-liquid ratio and the flow rates 
as analogous to physiological conditions as possible is highly desirable (Maschmeyer et al. 2015).
Fidelity of cell type
One more decision to consider when mimicking is the selection of the cells to be cultured. The use 
of primary cells, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), 
or immortalized cell lines can have several advantages and disadvantages. Some of these are 
summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1. Advantages and disadvantages of different cell types in OCC design.
Type of cultured cell Advantages Disadvantages
Mature Primary culture - Best representation of the native 
cell phenotype, physiology, and/or 
pathophysiology
- Ability to make customizable in vitro 
models
- Difficulty in extracting them from the 
patient in several cases
- Low availability of cells
- Low or no replication in some cell types
- Limited life span
- Loss of the desired phenotype or 
dedifferentiation after a short time of being 
cultured
Adult Stem Cells - Conservation of genotype and 
mutations
- Ability to make customizable in vitro 
models
- Low frequency
Induced Pluripotent 
Stem Cells (iPSCs)
- Conservation of genotype and 
mutations
- Ability to make customizable in vitro 
models
- Low reprogramming efficiency
- Risk of tumorigenesis and genetic 
abnormalities
Immortalized cell lines - Ease of growing
- Unlimited life span 
- Severe variations in genotype and 
phenotype 
Cell patterning
Besides the cell type alone, the interactions between different cells, their spatial distribution, and 
organization also dictate the correct function of the whole system. For this purpose, microfluidics 
enables the devising of in vitro chip models with the correct cell distribution. In this regard, 
different strategies can be used such as modification of surfaces, arrangement, and 3D printing. An 
appreciable method based on three-dimensional printing was developed by Li et al., who yielded 
a method to achieve directed topological modifications by using heterotypic cell patterning seeded 
on glass chips. By using this method, it is possible to study epithelial-mesenchymal interactions Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 285
(Li et al. 2015). This method is useful to trace cutaneous epithelial-mesenchymal interaction and 
other types of cell patterning.
6. Physical features
Fluid shear force 
The dynamics of cell culture are determined by the microfluidic flows, facilitating nutrient 
distribution and waste products disposal. In the OOC, this dynamic environment represents more 
accurately the in vivo features than that one established on a static culture. Besides, organ polarity 
also can be achieved by fluid shear stress. Moreover, OOC can elicit the activation of different 
surface molecules that are of primary importance for signaling cascades through physical pressure 
on the physiological function of endothelial cells (Wojciak-Stothard and Ridley 2003). 
Concentration gradient 
A stable biomolecule gradient results if the laminar flow is controlled spatially and temporally. 
Many important biological processes that rely on the concentration gradient of certain molecules, 
such as angiogenesis, invasion, and migration. Microfluidics can be used to modify the flow speed 
and channel shape and size by using microvalves and micropumps to resemble three-dimensional 
(3D) molecular concentration gradient (Figeys and Pinto 2000, Haeberle and Zengerle 2007).
Dynamic mechanical stress
In the human body, the lungs, the cardiovascular system, and the bones are subjected to pressure 
fluctuations. Thus, the skeletal muscle, blood vessels, bones and cartilage are in constant mechanic 
stress. Microfluidics allows the use of fenestrated membranes to create cycles of differential 
mechanical stress rates. The mechanical stress is a critical condition during distinct physiological 
processes (Chin et al. 2007).
7. Materials in tissue engineering and organ-on-a-chip
The selection of the materials for the OOC modeling represents another critical point. There is no 
single kit of materials for all cases. Consequently, their selection must be selected based on the 
requirements of the scaffolds, the microfluidic systems, the nature of the chemicals to be infused, the 
nature of stress to be applied to the cells, and the type of needed sensors, among other circumstantial 
needs. Throughout this chapter, the groups of materials with the highest degree of adoption will be 
reviewed and described according to their respective advantages, drawbacks, and circumstantial 
applications where they can offer the best utility. 
Materials for cellular arrangement and scaffolding
The construction of our cellular scaffold is one of the main success factors in organ-on-a-chip 
design. As another useful rule of the thumb in tissue engineering, the more similar the cellular 
scaffold is to the native extracellular matrix (ECM), the closer it will be to obtain the desired cellular 
phenotype. Different cell populations will require distinct microenvironmental conditions, so it is 
highly desirable to consider parameters such as the ideal stiffness, porosity, or the presence of ECM￾analogous motifs when selecting our materials. 286 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Ceramics
Ceramic materials have a considerable history within tissue engineering due to their stiffness, 
biological inertness, resorb ability, and biocompatibility (Baino et al. 2015). However, precisely 
due to their high stiffness and low elasticity, the use of these materials rarely reaches other uses than 
those related to bones and teeth. Materials such as hydroxyapatite, zirconium, alumina, calcium 
phosphates, and glass-based ceramics are among the most common examples in tissue engineering. 
Therefore, the presence of these within bone, dental and musculoskeletal chip models is appreciable 
in the literature, gaining in recent years considerable interest in its use for stem cell culture. One 
of the most recent and interesting cases to highlight the latter is the paper of Sieber et al., who 
developed a bone marrow system ideal for the culture of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
(HSPCs). As a cellular scaffold, the researchers used a ceramic structure composed of zirconium 
oxide coated with hydroxyapatite. This cultured scaffold was installed inside a microfluidic system 
and cultured for several weeks, yielding a fibronectin network and the expression of stem cell 
factor and other bone marrow-related genes. A Colony Forming Unit -Granulocyte, Erythrocyte, 
Monocyte, Megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) was later built to evaluate the differentiation ability 
of the cultured HSPCs, finding diverse colony-forming-unit populations related to the progenies 
of these cells (Sieber et al. 2018). Another approach with potential uses for organs-on-a-chip is 
presented by Díaz Lantada and collaborators, who manufactured an interesting monolithic chip 
made of alumina and produced by lithographic methods. This multiwell and multichannel chip 
showed a certain level of suitability for the culture of HSPCs, even though their pluripotency and 
other relevant characteristics were analyzed with subsequent tests. Overall, it seems that the use of 
ceramic materials will keep a special place for bone and dental models, offering not only the right 
stiffness, porosity, and compatibility to support musculoskeletal tissue, but also in maintaining the 
pluripotential of hematopoietic stem cells (Díaz Lantada et al. 2017).
Natural polymers
Nature has an enormous number of polymers that sustain life as it is known. Even the extracellular 
matrix itself offers an important clue about the composition that can be employed for scaffolding. 
Describing all the natural polymers would require a lengthy description that falls outside the purposes 
of this chapter. Still, a few polymers can be highlighted in this category such as collagen, fibronectin, 
alginate, gelatin, agar, hyaluronic acid, cellulose, agarose, and chitosan, whose uses have been 
appreciable in the development of various engineered systems. One of the advantages among some 
of these polymers, such as the case of collagen, gelatin, and fibronectin, is the presence of arginine￾glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs. RGD motifs are the minimal essential cell adhesion peptide 
sequence and are strongly associated with increased cell adhesion and integrin affinity (D’Souza 
et al. 1991, Takahashi et al. 2007, Taubenberger et al. 2010). Also, these polymers generally present 
good biocompatibility and do not usually release harmful residues after degradation. However, it 
is also necessary to emphasize the drawbacks that natural polymers have overall, as are their poor 
mechanical properties and difficulty in remaining structurally stable under physiological conditions 
(Kondiah et al. 2020). Also, a few of them have poor processability in some manufacturing 
technologies such as electrospinning. Even though many of these polymers tend to have limited 
properties without some type of chemical modification, mixing them in different ratios can lead 
to the generation of various “bio inks” that can be utilized in 3D bioprinting technologies (Liu 
et al. 2018). In summary, natural polymers generally offer a compatible material for cell scaffolding, 
with a high degree of cell adhesion. Even so, some drawbacks can be compensated through the 
mixture with other materials, or through chemical modifications to create a series of semi-synthetic 
derivatives. Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 287
Artificial polymers
The use of artificial polymers is traceable to the beginnings of animal cell culture, where polystyrene 
use has stood for decades. Although their degree of adoption in OOC technology is lower than their 
natural counterparts, there are areas of opportunity when these materials meet noticeable properties 
for the culture model. In addition to the latter, the polymer must meet some basic requirements for 
its biomedical use, such as good biocompatibility and biodegradability. For applications strictly 
related to the design of cell scaffolding and tissue engineering, some synthetic polymers such 
as poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic-co￾glycolic acid (PLGA), polyurethane (PU) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) have offered a variety of 
approaches that could translate into more robust applications in organ-on-a-chip technology. Among 
some of the advantages of artificial polymers are good mechanical strength, chemical inertness, ease 
of manipulating their geometries, controllable degradation rates, and tunable chemical structures 
(Guo and Ma 2014). However, most artificial polymers present serious problems such as poor cell 
adhesion, while some release acidic products when degraded (Stratton et al. 2016). Still, the use 
of synthetic polymers may hold promise possibilities in a handful of cases. One of them is their 
use within composites in conjunction with natural polymers and other substances to make more 
advanced scaffolds. A classic example is the synthesis of hydrogels composed of PEG and fibrinogen 
for 3D cellular scaffolding (Almany and Seliktar 2005). Another of the most attractive uses of 
synthetic polymers is the synthesis of ultrafine, microporous membranes that are generally much 
more complicated to construct and maintain using natural polymers. This is exemplified by the team 
of Pensabene et al., who built an ultrathin semipermeable membrane composed of poly (L-lactic 
acid) for biomimicry of the cell basement membrane. Using laser machining, a micropore pattern 
with constant diameters of 2 µm was obtained in the membrane and subsequently characterized 
with scanning electron microscopy (Pensabene et al. 2016). In brief, the adoption of these materials 
in biomimetic systems offers considerable opportunities, such as composite synthesis that will 
maximize their mechanical properties, and the construction of ultrathin structures that require higher 
levels of stiffness or more attractive Young’s moduli than their natural counterparts can offer.
Semi-synthetic polymers 
Through some chemical modifications, some natural polymers can be manipulated to improve some 
of their properties to the needs of the model. Among these materials, gelatin methacryolyl (GelMA) 
is arguably the most relevant semi-synthetic material for tissue engineering, due to its tunable 
mechanical properties, its considerable biocompatibility, and ease of extrusion. To prepare GelMA, 
natural gelatin is reacted with methacrylic anhydride, which will start substituting the amine groups 
of the amino acid residues by methacryoyl groups. The total percentage of converted amine groups 
to methacryoyl groups (known as the degree of substitution) can be chemically controlled, allowing 
the tunability of a few physical and chemical properties (Yue et al. 2015). Due to the gelatin 
within its composition, GelMA presents RGD motifs that also confer strong cell adhesion. Another 
advantage of this hydrogel is its flexibility to be adapted into various fabrication methods, such as 
photo-pattering, micromolding, and 3D bioprinting (Occhetta et al. 2013, Pepelanova et al. 2018, 
Ding et al. 2019). Even so, GelMA, like any other hydrogel, also has considerable disadvantages, 
such as poor resolution in contrast to stiffer materials. Besides, to crosslink the material to form the 
hydrogel, the composition requires a photoinitiator and UV radiation exposure. The latter, if repeated 
continuously, can affect cell viability and the preservation of the desired phenotype. Consequently, 
the search for similar hydrogels that can avoid UV curing is a valuable goal (Hölzl et al. 2016). 
Other semi-synthetic products such as chitosan derivatives have gained some relevance within tissue 
engineering and drug delivery (Kim et al. 2008). However, their participation in the generation of 288 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
OOC systems seems to be limited. Ultimately, GelMA and other semi-synthetic polymers offer 
enormous flexibility when developing cell scaffolds, positioning themselves as promising materials 
for biomimetic models. GelMA can be used with different degrees of substitution and in conjunction 
with various other components to create an invaluable amount of bioinks. However, its drawbacks 
must be considered when designing in vitro models, to avoid UV overexposure and non-printability 
ranges. 
Nanomaterials and nanocomposites
The recent adoption of nanomaterials to biomedical applications has opened one of the most exciting 
opportunities in the search for new materials for tissue engineering. Some of these nanostructures 
possess exceptional mechanical properties, while others resemble the extracellular matrix in terms 
of its structural conformation. On the other hand, some nanomaterials can tune their properties 
through surface functionalization, making several of them quite adaptable for different uses. Among 
all nano-scaled options, nanometric versions of polymers and ceramics have begun to be explored in 
the development of various scaffolds, in addition to those of metallic and carbon-based composition. 
On one side, one of the most practical approaches to date is the creation of new nanocomposites, 
where materials such as nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) crystals, nano-TiO2, and nano calcium 
phosphate have been implemented for advanced versions of cellular scaffolds (Fan et al. 2016, 
Singh et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2020). Further, some other unconventional nanostructures have been 
used to create cell culture scaffolds with some added properties. For example, multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been used in nanocomposites in conjunction with gelatin, chitosan, and 
GelMA, improving not only some mechanical properties but also some electrical properties like 
electrical conductivity. The latter has gained considerable relevance in cardiac tissue engineering 
since some culture systems enriched with MWCNTs have shown improvement in cardiac cell growth, 
differentiation, and regeneration (Gorain et al. 2018). Alternatively, enormous interest has been 
generated around the use of nanofibers, due to their similarity to the diameters and matrix porosities 
of the ECM. Additionally, the high surface area/volume ratio of nanofibers is advantageous for 
cell attachment. For the synthesis of these nanofibers, electrospinning is an easy and favorable 
technique capable of using some natural and synthetic polymers, with an appreciable number of 
reported applications in the literature (Mehta and Pawar 2018). Overall, although no nanomaterial 
will work as a “jack-of-all-trades”, nanotechnology offers a huge range of structures with different 
properties, geometries, and dimensionalities that can complement the ideal architecture for optimal 
cell culture. The rational and systematic selection of all scaffolding materials, as well as the 
necessary manufacturing methods, are important keys in obtaining a cellular phenotype sufficiently 
satisfactory to the needs of the in vitro model. 
8. Materials for chip design
Chip design is the heart of operations, so selecting a suitable material is just as important as 
scaffolding design. However, chip design is different from scaffolding since the required materials 
should be adapted for microfluidic applications. Among some desirable characteristics are the 
ease of generating microfluidic channels, good channel resolution, optical transparency for optical 
biosensors and microscopes, thermostability, gas permeability, and lack of absorption of the infused 
chemicals. Just as in cellular scaffolding, it is highly recommended that the manufacturing methods 
will be considered as well, as they may have an impact on industrial scalability. If good planning 
is done regarding the selection of materials and manufacturing methods, one-step organ-on-a-chip 
fabrication is possible (Lee and Cho 2016). Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 289
Glass and silicon chips
The use of glass and silicon dates back to the creation of the first microfluidic systems, and although 
their use has become more discreet as newer materials were inserted, there are still circumstances 
in which these materials may still be relevant. Glass maintains some attractive properties for 
microfluidic applications, such as chemical inertness, good optical transparency, good channel 
resolution, hydrophilicity, thermal conductivity and high resistant to small molecules’ absorption. 
For this reason, some recent OOC proposals have been made with glass-based substrates. For 
example, the team of Hirama and collaborators prepared an OOC device composed entirely of 
glass to overcome some of the intrinsic limitations that elastomer-based chips have, such as the 
absorption of hydrophobic molecules and background fluorescence (Hirama et al. 2019). However, 
one of the main disadvantages of glass in microfluidics is its high cost, which not only hinders 
its transition to the industry but also its use in prototyping. On the other hand, silicone has also 
been a considerably forgotten material for microfluidics, given its high costs due to the expensive 
maintenance of the clean rooms needed to work it correctly. Another drawback is its optical opacity, 
making the use of fluorescence infeasible. Even so, silicon has allowed a whole revolution in the 
field of microfabrication, being the main substrate for the construction of important technologies 
such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which have contributed to the development of a 
technology related to organs-on-a-chip: the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology (Azizipour et al. 2020). 
The insertion of silicon-based semiconductor systems, MEMS, and LOCs into organ-on-a-chip 
platforms presents a very attractive opportunity for the development of more advanced platforms, 
which is why some scientists in recent years have experimented with silicon for the creation of 
OOCs with some embedded microsystems. Exemplifying it, da Ponte et al. proposed a silicon OOC, 
in which a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMS) was integrated into the chip for the 
construction of an in situ, real-time temperature sensor (da Ponte et al. 2021). Even though both 
glass and silicone are expensive materials for microfluidics, they still have relevance in developing 
OOC technology for creating advanced proof-of-concepts. Furthermore, given the success of the 
semiconductor industry, it might be possible to extrapolate silicon chips to commercialization if the 
market niche requires them in high quantities. 
Elastomers
With the adoption of elastomers, and especially, with the adoption of polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS), microfluidics reached a new milestone towards low-cost device manufacturing. PDMS has 
positioned itself as the most important standard in microfluidics, standing out from other materials 
due to its optical transparency, flexibility, simplicity and low cost of operation, gas permeability, and 
cross-linkability with a myriad of materials and other PDMS structures (Torino et al. 2018). Besides, 
it is possible to make membranes with micrometric porosities that can be easily inserted into the 
chips through crosslinking (Quirós-Solano et al. 2018). Arguably, the history of organs-on-a-chip 
would not have progressed to current standards without PDMS, due to the enormous dependence 
that microfluidics has had on the latter. However, PDMS is not a perfect material, and it also has a 
few drawbacks that limit its almost universal use. For example, PDMS tends to absorb hydrophobic 
molecules, which greatly limits the number of substances that can flow through their channels, 
including some biomolecules and some drugs of hydrophobic nature. Being also a polymer that 
allows gas permeability, PDMS microchips can also suffer from water evaporation, compromising 
some culture systems where the flow input is not constant (Toepke and Beebe 2006). Finally, the 
geometry of the microchannels can be compromised if the system is under high pneumatic pressure 
(Raj et al. 2018). Due to these substantial drawbacks, there have been considerable efforts trying to 
find materials “beyond PDMS” (Carlborg et al. 2011), although none have been presented to date 290 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
with the same or greater quantity of desirable properties. Besides PDMS, some other elastomers 
have been involved in the development of microfluidic chips. For instance, tetrafluoroethylene￾propylene (FEPM) has been proposed recently for organ-on-a-chip design, as an alternative capable 
of flowing hydrophobic drugs that PDMS would typically absorb (Sano et al. 2019). 
Thermoplastic polymers
Thermoplastics are highly malleable materials at the right temperatures and their escalation to the 
industry is immensely easy. These polymers usually have very low costs, both in production and 
as raw materials, and several of them have good optical transparency, mechanical stability, and 
ease for microchannel machining (Gencturk et al. 2017). Because of all this, some thermoplastics 
have been tested in microfluidic systems and organs-on-a-chip as alternatives to glass, silicon, and 
PDMS. Polymers like polyetheretherketone (PEEK) have been explored for OOC design, as is the 
case with the mentioned work of Bovard et al., where this polymer was tested for the development 
of a lung/liver chip for toxicological screening (Bovard et al. 2018). PEEK is an inert polymer, with 
considerable biocompatibility, and it is a non-absorbent of small molecules, in contrast to PDMS. 
However, PEEK is a particularly expensive thermoplastic in high volumes, as seen in the prosthetics 
industry (Haleem and Javaid 2019). Another detail to consider is that this and other thermoplastics 
require a different type of equipment and methods to operate them efficiently since the nature of its 
malleability does not make them compatible with most techniques and equipment of the previously 
mentioned materials. Therefore, its use could be further explored for prototyping and creation of 
proofs of concepts, and perhaps its addition to the industry could be carefully considered if its 
properties justify their selection and do not hinder the production chain. 
Hydrogels
Although their use has not been as popular as PDMS, hydrogels in microfluidic applications have 
been gaining attention in recent years. As previously reviewed, hydrogels are usually biocompatible 
materials, with a practical resemblance to the extracellular matrix, and with some tunable 
mechanical properties in several cases. Moreover, hydrogels are materials that can absorb water and 
swell without being solubilized and can change from swell to shrunk state if the correct stimuli are 
performed. With these properties, different microfluidic and biomimetic systems based on hydrogels 
have been presented in the literature as very particular alternatives to conventional microfluidic 
materials. As a recent case to highlight, the model of Nie et al. proposed a completely hydrogel￾based alternative for the engineering of vascularized systems, utilizing a simple manufacturing 
method. In this work, two hydrogel bulks with microgrooves and composed of alginate, gelatin, 
and/or GelMA were constructed by a layer-by-layer process and subsequently crosslinked to form 
a bulk with microchannels inside it. This vessel-on-a-chip was tested with human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVEC), which were cultivated inside the channels. As a proof-of-concept, this 
system showed beneficial properties for cells, which presented adequate spreading morphology 
along the substrate and a high survival rate after the LIVE/DEAD assay (Nie et al. 2018). However, 
given the poor mechanical properties of hydrogels overall, the assembly of much more complex 
structures remains a challenge in OOC design. 
9. Sensor selection
Many of the organs-on-a-chip reported in the literature rely heavily on cell viability, proliferation, and 
cytotoxicity assays, making them impractical to carry out several comprehensive and quantitative 
analyses that do not compromise the operating system. Therefore, the insertion of sensors that monitor 
real-time the culture parameters and metabolic activities is highly desirable. It must be considered 
that, during manufacturing, some sensors will have to be built together with the rest of the OOC Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 291
chip, so the selection of materials and manufacturing processes should preferably be abreast with the 
rest of the segments. Similarly, the correct selection of the materials, the physicochemical principles 
of the sensors, and optimal designing will have an important role in their analytical parameters. 
Among all the types of sensors used in the literature, electrochemical and optical sensors are the 
most widely used for organ-on-a-chip applications (Ferrari et al. 2020), representing a practical 
classification for this chapter. 
Electrochemical sensors
Electrochemical sensors are attractive due to their ease of being miniaturized and their high 
sensitivity. Consequently, they have been applied in OOC technology for monitoring parameters 
such as dissolved oxygen, pH, substrate, and metabolite levels, and TEER measurement for tissue 
integrity and permeability. For oxygen measurement, different electrochemical sensors have been 
proposed, although the work of Moya et al. can be highlighted due to the ease and practicality 
with which they embedded them in situ. In their work, the team microfabricated a set of three 
amperometric oxygen sensors on an ultrathin, porous membrane of a liver-on-a-chip model for 
local monitoring of oxygen gradients. For this, they printed a photoresist SU-8 primer layer on the 
porous membrane, and later a set of gold and silver electrodes through inkjet printing technology, 
without having any negative effect on diffusion (Moya et al. 2018). Moreover, electrochemical 
sensors mainly stand out in the detection of metabolites and substrates, due to their ease of being 
extrapolated to enzyme-based sensors. A relevant case of the latter is shown by Patrick Misun et al., 
who proposed the use of enzyme-based biosensors based on platinum electrodes functionalized with 
glucose or lactate oxidase enzymes. These biosensors were successful in detecting and recording in 
real-time the levels of these metabolites on a 3D spheroid hanging-drop culture system, achieving 
limits of detection below 10 µM (Misun et al. 2016). One more example to highlight is the work 
of Khalid et al., who installed in a lung-on-a-chip system a set of impedimetric sensors for pH and 
TEER monitoring in real-time. Using these sensors, the team was able to perform cytotoxicity tests 
using doxorubicin and docetaxel while monitoring and recording the outputs. The results showed 
a gradual pH decrease due to the acidification of the media, while the frequency values of TEER 
impedance were used to compute a cell index, which was used to assess cell viability in the chip. 
A decrease in the cell index was found in all tested models, finding a correlation with the results 
obtained by a LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay (Khalid et al. 2020). 
Optical sensors
Optical sensors are another family of sensors with multiple applications within tissue engineering. 
Like electrochemical sensors, there are notable approaches for glucose and lactate detection and 
monitoring, along with other detection parameters such as pH. A compelling work that uses several 
external optical sensors was introduced by Shaegh and coworkers, who proposed a platform with 
optical sensors for monitoring multiple parameters of an infused culture media. With this technology, 
it was possible to monitor pH and oxygen through low-cost devices, which offer an efficient and 
user-friendly system to assess microfluidic-scale bioreactors (Shaegh et al. 2016). Differently, 
Bavli et al. designed a platform to study the mitochondrial dysfunction of a liver-on-a-chip, using 
both electrochemical sensors for glucose and lactate monitoring, as optical sensors for real-time 
monitoring of oxygen, showing the potential of combining both types of sensors given some of 
their intrinsic advantages (Bavli et al. 2016). Although there is no rule of thumb about what sensor 
should be installed, since different electrochemical and optical sensors will have their respective 
advantages and disadvantages, the technology can be chosen based on how familiar the researcher 
is with it. Even so, the design and fabrication of the sensor should always be considered to maximize 
their use within the OOC. Therefore, priority should be given to those devices that can be easily 292 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
inserted or embedded during chip manufacturing, measure the desired signals locally, and present 
the desired analytical parameters. 
10. Fabrication methods for tissue engineering and 
organs-on-a-chip
Fabrication methods must be evaluated in parallel with the selected materials since different 
substances can only be handled by certain methods and equipment. Consequently, after selecting the 
correct range of materials for the chip, design planning should be done to simplify manufacturing 
as much as possible. Thus, complicated, and illogical workflows that will potentially affect our 
models should be avoided, such as the abuse of UV and heat curing steps. Regardless of the used 
materials, it is strongly recommended that the fabrication and manufacturing methods would also 
consider industrial scaling since the commercial viability of the chip can remarkably depend on the 
latter. The simpler and more direct the manufacturing chain is established, the more likely the chip 
will meet commercialization. 
Lithographic methods
Lithography, especially within the context of microfabrication, can be generalized as a series of 
methods that transfer a geometric pattern to our desired structure. Among these methods, we can 
pigeonhole two particularly important for OOCs: photolithography and soft lithography.
Photolithography
Photolithography is a classic technique within the microfabrication field and is still a standard in 
some niches such as semiconductor and DNA microarrays industries. This top-down approach uses 
a photomask, which will transfer a specific pattern to a substrate through the selective passage of 
light. This light pattern will be imprinted in a material called photoresist, which will be dispersed as 
a layer on the substrate. Depending on the photoresist, the imprinted pattern on it will be vulnerable 
or resistant to certain etching processes, allowing the addition of a successive layer uniquely on the 
removed sections. This process, which has been adapted primarily for silicon wafers, is useful for 
pattering microchannels and for constructing other microcomponents such as MEMs and embedded 
sensors. There are discrete but interesting examples reporting its use for organ-on-a-chip technology 
(Huh et al. 2013, Kimura et al. 2018). Nevertheless, despite being a standard technology in some 
industries, photolithography has serious drawbacks. The need for expensive clean rooms, equipment, 
and a potentially large quantity of photomasks makes its use unfeasible if mass production is not 
met. In other cases, any potential application must be substituted, or as a minimum, should be as 
limited or outsourced as possible.
Soft lithography 
In contrast to photolithography, soft lithography usually prescinds from etching and deposition 
processes, which generally involve highly aggressive chemicals. Instead, soft lithography uses 
elastomer seals and molds that will transmit a pattern to the desired structure. In contrast to 
conventional photolithography, soft lithography allows greater flexibility in material’s selection 
(including some biocompatible), can allow the creation of curved arrangements, and does not 
require clean rooms as soon as the patterned master is obtained. Due to the popularity of PDMS 
chips in microfluidics, soft lithography is arguably the most widely used technique to produce 
organs-on-a-chip (Wang et al. 2015). However, it also has a few drawbacks. With soft lithography, 
it is not possible to yield the same level of alignment and uniformity that can be obtained with 
photolithography, so it cannot be used as a total substitute for creating the whole myriad of micro and Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 293
Figure 2. Most used production technologies for the construction of scaffolds and microfluidic systems in tissue engineering 
and organs-on-a-chip. (A) Lithographic methods: I. The photolithographic process uses a photomask and UV light to insert 
a pattern on a substrate (usually a Silicon Wafer) on a substrate covered with a photoresist, which after an etching process, 
will leave the desired pattern. II. Soft lithography uses a master mold with the desired pattern in conjunction with an 
elastomer (e.g., PDMS). After going through a curing process, the elastomer will acquire the desired pattern. (B) Laser-based 
technologies irradiate a laser pulse that removes a solid fraction of the substrate surface for the generation of the desired 
pattern. (C) In electrospinning, the system will be subjected to high voltages, charging the material electrostatically and 
promoting a stretched geometry known as the Taylor cone. Under suitable experimental conditions, the drop will be executed 
in a constant flow, forming a nanofiber that will be deposited in a collector. (D) I. Bioprinting inkjet technology makes use 
of heaters or piezoelectric actuators for the formation of bioink droplets. II. Extrusion bioprinting uses pneumatic pressure 
through compressed air, mechanical pressure through a piston, or a rotary screw to release a continuous filament of the 
bioink. III. Laser-induced forward transfer bioprinting makes use of a laser beam that interacts with an absorbing layer on 
a substrate, producing heat and promoting the deposition of the bioink on the substrate. IV. Stereolithography uses a light￾sensitive bioink and exposure to either a laser pattering or a light projection with a distinctive pattern. 294 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
nanocomponents. Also, the generation of any master generally requires other lithographic methods, 
such as photolithography or electron-beam lithography. Although this is not a direct disadvantage, 
it must always be considered whenever new masters with new patterns are needed (Sahin et al. 
2018). Outside these few disadvantages, soft lithography is a firm and reliable technology for the 
chip design in OOC technology, and one that should be strongly considered when selecting the 
manufacturing methods. 
Laser-based methods
The combination of laser beam technology with computer numerical control (CNC) machines has 
offered a steadfast technology able to generate micrometric patterns and structures for a surfeit of 
applications. In principle, laser-based techniques are contactless processes that allow the creation of 
patterns through laser ablation and cutting, which can be used on a huge variety of materials if they 
do not produce harmful gases or dust. Fortunately, various materials can be patterned using laser 
ablation and cutting, positioning this type of method as attractive alternatives in chip design. Among 
the literature, some papers have already used laser methods for organ-on-a-chip design, highlighting 
its potential in research and prototyping (Kojic et al. 2019, Sun et al. 2020, Bakhchova et al. 2020). 
However, there are some major disadvantages to consider from an engineering perspective. These 
methods are also highly energy-dependent, making their use expensive due to their large power 
consumption on an industrial scale. Furthermore, the pattering speed and etching rate can vary 
between materials, achieving exceedingly slow and impractical production times in some cases. 
However, laser-based methods can be useful prototyping tools for OOC design, and its extrapolation 
to the industry might be achievable in specific cases.
Electrospinning
The electrospinning technique has become one of the most preferred to produce nanofiber-based 
structures, making its use appealing for tissue engineering. The electrospinning principle relies 
on the charge and ejection of a polymer solution in the form of solid and thin fibers, with which 
structural matrices with high surface-to-volume ratios can be structured. Due to their similarity with 
the extracellular matrix, this technique has been extensively explored to create different scaffolds, 
with some of these coupled to a few organs-on-a-chip (Yang et al. 2018, Kim et al. 2019). However, 
electrospinning also has a few disadvantages, such as the complex control of structural pores if there 
is a lack of experience on the technique. Due to the latter, some of the obtained matrices usually 
present poor cellular infiltration and migration (Dahlin et al. 2011). Besides, the process requires 
the use of solvents whose residues can affect the tissue culture. Still, electrospinning is a simple and 
generally inexpensive process with good potential for creating cellular scaffolds, if there is a strong 
knowledge of the technique to yield adequate fiber diameters and porosities. 
3D Bioprinting methods
The adoption of 3 D printing to the biomedical field is an appreciable milestone, and the introduction 
of bioprinting, which allowed the insertion of cells and components within the same “bioinks”, is a 
milestone on its own. 3D printing is a bottom-up technique based on the superposition of successive 
layers ideal for prototyping, but with high compatibility with industrial scalability. Further, it is also 
ideal for creating personalized and customizable devices, and it has become an increasingly recurrent 
technique in the design of OOCs. From 3D bioprinting, an appreciable number of techniques have 
emerged, with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 295
Inkjet-based 3D Bioprinting
As one of the pioneering technologies in bioprinting, inkjet printing has evolved rapidly in a series 
of subtypes with the same purpose: the ejection of droplets to form the desired pattern. For example, 
in Drop-on-Demand bioprinting, droplets are injected by the action of a heater or piezoelectric 
actuator, while in Electrohydrodynamic Printing, droplets emerge from the application of high 
voltages (Gudapati et al. 2016). Inkjet 3D printing is compatible with other non-biological materials, 
which is ideal for developing other components such as sensors, and it also maintains considerable 
advantages such as high-speed printing, low cost, and digital-level control (Murphy and Atala 
2014). Although inkjet technology has some downsides to consider, such as inhomogeneity in the 
size and directionality of the droplets and inconsistency with cell encapsulation, this technology has 
considerable success in OOC design, especially in the design of thin structures such as vascularized 
models (Bishop et al. 2017). 
Extrusion-based 3D bioprinting
This technology is based on the extrusion of a bioink through the pneumatic or mechanical pressure 
using pressurized air, pistons, or screws. Extrusion bioprinting is widely used due to its ideality to 
yield high cell densities, fine control over the bioink deposition, and appreciable structural integrity 
(Bishop et al. 2017). Nonetheless, this technology generally maintains lower resolutions than 
other printing technologies, and without optimal imprinting conditions for cells, part of the cell 
population can enter apoptosis (Leberfinger et al. 2017, Cidonio et al. 2019). Further, the deposition 
speed can decrease as more bioinks in separate syringes are added, slowing down the process and 
compromising the final structure in a few cases. To overcome the latter, the team of Liu et al. 
developed a fast, multi-material extrusion system, where bioinks are continuously extruded through 
a single printhead (Liu et al. 2017). 
Laser-induced forward transfer bioprinting 
Laser-assisted technologies are another valuable alternative within the bioprinting field. Concretely, 
laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) technology uses a pulsed laser beam that will be directed 
to a transparent substrate known as the donor slide (also known as ribbon), which will be coated 
in the bottom with an energy-absorbing layer (to favor the expansion of cavitation bubbles), and 
a bioink layer (with the necessary component of polymers, hydrogels, and cells). The expansive 
action of these bubbles will eject droplets from the bioink layer, allowing micropatterning with 
a high level of precision. In addition to the last-mentioned, laser-assisted bioprinting has other 
appealing advantages such as the possibility of working with high viscosity bioinks, which would 
generally be difficult to work with other technologies, along with high printing resolutions that 
reach the micrometer scale (Serra et al. 2010). Nonetheless, this technology is usually expensive, 
the manufacturing process is slow, and the generated heat may affect cell viability. With all these 
considerations, laser-based bioprinting is shown as an attractive technology for the design of highly 
complex microstructures, positioning itself as a first-choice tool in cases where other bioprinting 
technologies have limitations. On the other hand, it would be favorable to avoid its use in the 
construction of bulky structures, for which it would be better to complement with more appropriate 
manufacturing technologies. 
Stereolithography bioprinting
Like other lithographic methods, stereolithography uses specific light wavelengths in certain patterns 
to generate highly detailed structures. In this technology, the light will harden a resin or hydrogel 296 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
through a photopolymerization reaction. This radiation will first solidify the material at the height 
of the printing plate and will continue to solidify the desired structure, layer by layer, as the plate 
moves through the Z-axis. This technology has many advantages, making it a promising technology 
for tissue engineering. In the first instance, stereolithography is not limited by the viscosity of the 
bioink as other nozzle-based approaches, it does not produce mechanical stress to the cells of the 
composition, and it also presents a high printing resolution (Kačarević et al. 2018). Nonetheless, 
just as LIFT bioprinting, the necessary optical equipment is expensive. Moreover, stereolithography 
bioprinting is limited to light-curing resins, which not only partially conditions the flexibility of the 
ink composition but can also cause genetic damage to cells due to the wavelengths of the beams. 
Notwithstanding, some recent approaches have been presented to solve this last problem, through the 
adoption of light-curing processes that require wavelengths closer to the visible spectrum (Hoffmann 
et al. 2017, Sakai et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2018). It should be noted that the presented bioprinting 
techniques, as well as several of the other manufacturing methodologies, are not mutually exclusive 
for tissue engineering and organ-on-a-chip design, opening the opportunity to implement several 
methodologies in the same manufacturing chain. Finally, several of these methodologies can be 
coupled in the same system, maximizing the benefits, and offsetting the intrinsic drawbacks of
each one. 
11. Bioengineered systems for organs-on-a-chip technology 
An extremely extensive variety of biomimetic systems can be found reported in the literature, 
ranging from simple vascularized systems to multi-organic and body-on-a-chip proofs-of-concept. 
However, the detailed understanding of the anatomy and physiology of each tissue and organ is 
pivotal for the generation of more reliable systems with greater predictive capacity. In this section, 
some of the most common systems will be presented. 
Cardiac
The heart is a potent biological pump that oversees blood delivering and recycling from and towards 
all extra-cardiac organs. Thus, the importance of managing heart injuries and diseases is imperative 
for the development of regenerative medicine. There are some difficulties in cardiac system 
engineering, such as the limited proliferation rate of the cardiomyocytes, and other factors that allow 
their native alignment. Therefore, cardiomyocytes need to be co-cultured with several cellular and 
molecular factors to successfully resemble the anatomical cardiac design (Van Berlo and Molkentin 
2014). Also, the synchronic beating capacity of cardiomyocytes is lost rapidly inside in vitro cultures 
due to the isolation processes, lack of matrix compatibility, or mismatching matrix properties. On 
the other hand, drug-induced cardiotoxicity is another pillar of cardiac research. More than 15% of 
drug recalls are induced by cardiotoxicity, and another important percentage has been retracted from 
the market primarily due to inconsistent in vitro assays’ results that imprecisely predict drug 
cytotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular therapeutic drug effects are largely studied on 
immortalized two-dimensional cultures and animal models. Nonetheless, both systems are inefficient 
to correctly predict the human response (Thomas et al. 2018). The advantages of tissue engineering 
have led to the generation of human hearts in vitro which, in combination with microfluidic 
technologies, granted the creation of heart-on-a-chip devices. The use of this technology permits the 
researcher to probe drug-induced global effects on the cardiac tissue (Zhang et al. 2015). But before 
understanding hearts-on-a-chip by themselves, it is important to understand the anatomy and 
physiology of the heart. Cardiac tissue has a mesodermal origin. The myocardium is conformed by 
cardiomyocytes and this tissue represents the pumping engine of the vascular system. The 
myocardium cells are disposed of in a parallel fashion, and are joined together by Fascia adherens 
unions and gap junctions that build up the myocardial fiber that allows muscle contraction. Early in Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 297
the development, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, pacemaker cells, and Purkinje cells are 
formed. In the left side of the myocardium, Purkinje cells spawn, conduct the electrical stimuli, and 
pass it to the right branch of the myocardium. Cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts (60% of cardiac 
mass) are located under the extracellular matrix of the heart wall. The endocardium cells line the 
blood vessels and cardiac valves. The epicardium cells form the pericardium parietal wall, which is 
in the coronary vasculature. Natural crest cells oversee cardiac tissue oxygenation, which also 
contributes to the outflow of the tract septum. Ultimately, macrophages are in charge of the cardiac 
immune response (Olson 2006). Besides, in cell-to-cell communication, the heart is subjected to 
endocrine and paracrine signaling, elicited by cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix 
molecules that comprise the cardiac microenvironment. Cellular intercommunication with 
extracellular and signaling molecules set up heart development and maintenance in a coordinated 
and complex microenvironment. With all these previous considerations, tissues can be engineered. 
Heart tissue engineering has developed two particular approaches to construct these systems: one 
that involves the use of biological substitutes, and a scaffold-free system. The latter is developed as 
cell-sheet engineering, where cells are first obtained by primary isolation, are seeded on temperature￾sensitive polymers, and right after cells would be attached, the confluent layer of cells is released by 
decreasing culture temperature and decreasing cell-substrate affinity. This multiple-layer structure 
is capable of resembling thick myocardium-like tissues (Hwang et al. 2009). The other approach 
relies on spheroid formation. In this system, embryonic stem cells are seeded onto anti-adherent 
wells made of PDMS or PEG. Embryonic stem cells will acquire their phenotype as cardiomyocytes, 
osteoblasts, or neurons, depending on well cellular density and size. Cardiogenesis can be confirmed 
by sarcomeric a-actinin and cardiomyocytes genes expression (Hwang et al. 2009). Moreover, 
natural and human-made polymers are used to build artificial matrices for this purpose. Natural 
polymers like elastin, hyaluronic acid, alginate, fibrin, gelatin, and collagen are preferred since they 
express specific ligands that improve cell adhesion. Nevertheless, great variability may exist 
between batches, and the polymer mechanical properties may not support the tissues. Therefore, 
biomaterial densification techniques and the use of hybrid systems may be utilized to increase 
mechanical support. For example, compression of collagen gels has been used successfully as 
acellular patches for cardiac function improvement. Also, the use of hybrid systems, such as semi￾interpenetrating networks of photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid (MeHa) and collagen, increase 
significantly the mechanical features when compared with collagen or MeHa alone (Nichol et al. 
2010). In contrast, artificial polymers could be simply modified for specific purposes. For example, 
the polyglycolic acid (PGA) turn-over rate, which is measured by the conversion of hydroxypropanoic 
acid to alpha-Hydroxyacetic acid, is completed in approximately 1 year, allowing the scaffold to 
gradually disappear as tissue develops, leaving a polymer-free functional tissue (Prabhakaran et al. 
2011). Recently, the development of muscular thin films (MTFs) by the team of Parker et al. was 
another significant advancement for pharmacological and electrophysical studies. Furthermore, a 
microfabricated hybrid tissue system was built with cardiomyocytes and elastomeric thin films to 
measure fiber contraction, cytoskeletal organization, and the influence of diastole and systole MTF 
maximum stress levels on cellular alignment. Later, this device was modified for drug screening and 
to address genetic, structural, and functional features of myocardium injury. Finally, the device was 
improved with a clear cover that allows the identification of MTF deformations (Agarwal et al. 
2013). Oppositely, Zhang et al. designed an OOC system for pharmaceutical research. The 
microfluidic 3D system resembles heart functions such as mechanical contractions, molecular 
signaling, electrophysical responses, and activation after drug stimulation. Sidorov et al. were able 
to arrange sarcomeres on an aligned distribution as seen in the heart tissue. Furthermore, cardiac 
tissue differentiation was completed by using a sustained pulse. This experiment shed light to the 
contraction as a determinant feature to design a successful model with mature cardiomyocytes 
(Mathur et al. 2015). Another engineered 3D cardiac tissue construct (ECTC) was developed by 
Sidorov et al., by using a six-well plate seeded with rat neonatal ventricular cells on a matrix of 298 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
fibrinogen and thrombin. For cardiac tissue design, different cell types are needed. Thus, they 
co-cultured cardiomyocytes, vessel-specific cells, and ECM molecules on a device perfused with a 
culture medium. Synchronic beats were registered as soon as 5 days of culture and fiber formation 
was detectable within 13–15 days (Schroer et al. 2017). The measure of contractions was achieved 
with an optical microscope coupled to a cantilever probe fixed on the condenser, allowing an optic 
measure of probe shifting and possible ECTC twisting. The ECTC is anchored on a motorized stage. 
The contraction was then stimulated by applying a controlled lateral force. The action potential was 
measured by using a KCl electrode. Moreover, voltage stimulation was achieved by conduction 
through titanium wires (Sidorov et al. 2017). Sidorov’s research team achieved cardiomyocyte 
differentiation into a beating cardiac muscle that displayed normal organization cytology. Also, the 
amplitude of the action potential (AP) was 80–90 mV, and the resting potential was 60–75 mV at a 
pacing rate of 2000 ms. The results of this experiment were later validated by the Wikswo laboratory 
by using horizontal force to determine ECTC contractility. Sidorov’s team then used the heart-on￾chip device to address drug response when β-adrenergic stimulation was applied. The heart rate is 
highly controlled by adrenergic neurotransmitters. Thus, the addition of isoproterenol was able to 
increase the force and contraction rate, through the activation of adrenergic receptors. Nevertheless, 
isoproterenol diminishes the duration of contraction when added to cardiomyocytes in vivo. 
However, it is necessary to translate this research to studies that would focus on human cardiac 
diseases. Another human 3D microtissue model was built by Marsano et al. by using induced 
pluripotent stem cells (Vunjak-Novakovic et al. 2010). The device demonstrated a higher 
cardiomyocyte maturation rate when subjected to cyclic mechanical stimulation. Even more, both 
the spontaneous and synchronous beating, as well as the cardiomyocyte’s stimuli response to the 
beta-adrenergic-agonist, isoprenaline, were detected. Nevertheless, this device requires further 
improvement to accurately mimic the complexity of cardiac muscle anatomy (Zhuang et al. 2000). 
Finally, this device is suitable to develop pharmacologic and research protocols, if contraction and 
action potentials are registered by using a transversal force throughout the device coupled to a 
cantilever probe, capable of measuring ECTC responses. Thus, if wires are connected directly to the 
PDMS mold, the cultured cells can be tracked constantly. The addition of this detection system is 
cheap when compared with other devices. The development of a device that mimics the anatomy 
and structure of the human heart represents the first step in the generation of a multi-organ 
microdevice (Zhang et al. 2015).
Hepatic
The liver is the organ where metabolic and drug biotransformation processes take place. Thus, this 
organ is more susceptible to display metabolic disorders and drug-induced toxicity. Anatomically, 
the liver is divided into two lobules that represent the functional surface of the organ. Lobules 
are organized in sinusoids that are formed of specialized fenestrated endothelial cells (McCuskey 
et al. 2003) (Figure 3.A). Hepatocytes are the most abundant cells in the liver (80%) and are 
arranged in plates attached by thigh junctions that form the bile canaliculi, small tubular apical 
spaces between adjacent hepatocytes. These cells express high levels of detoxification enzymes 
such as cytochrome CYP450, acute-phase response proteins, and plasmatic proteins. These proteins 
coordinate nanoparticle clearance and xenobiotic removal through conjugation with molecules 
such as glycine sulfate, glucuronate, or glutathione, which ultimately diminish their toxicity and 
make them soluble and easily removable. Hepatocytes are also determinants for glucose and lipid 
metabolism. The space of Disse forms a reticular basement layer made of collagen I, IV, fibronectin, 
and laminin located between the hepatocytes and the endothelial cells. Hepatocytes around the 
sinusoid display abundant microvilli protrusions to the Disse, which allows direct contact with the 
blood surrounding the sinusoid. The remaining 20% of the liver mass is formed of non-parenchymal 
cells (NPC) such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; Kupffer cells, which lead the response to liver Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 299
injury; hepatic stellate cells, that oversee the extracellular matrix remodeling after cellular loss; and 
pit cells. Sinusoid zonation is given by the vascular disposition that spreads throughout the liver, 
which varies from the periportal to the perivenous area. The most relevant modifications are the 
extracellular matrix (ECM) framework throughout the sinusoid, cytology, genetic expression, and 
metabolism. Furthermore, fenestration is different in the periportal region (larger) in contrast to 
the proximities of the central vein that is marked for oxygen delivery, although recent studies have 
demonstrated that this zonation could be determined by Wnt signaling driven by endothelial cells. 
As a consequence of the loss of liver, architecture leads to loss of tissue function (Kaplowitz 2006). 
The average blood flow that runs throughout the sinusoid has an average rate of 144 µm/s per 1.9s 
of mean residence time. The hepatocytes that are closer to the sinusoid receive ~ 2 nmol/mL; the 
oxygen delivery rate given throughout the sinusoid is 72 nmol/(min × 106
 cells). The oxygen supply 
of the liver comes from two sources: the hepatic artery, and the hepatic portal vein circulation. 
Since the oxygen pressures across the sinusoid decrease, the responses to metabolic and/or toxic 
stimuli are differential depending on the zone. Blood supply alterations could lead to inadequate 
cell response and the release of hepatocyte factors potency, which is a function of the blood-to￾cell volume ratio (20.5 mL blood/ mL tissue) for healthy adult livers. If the hepatocyte volume is 
3.4 pL11, then it is calculated that 14 million hepatocytes are supplied by only 1 mL of blood. This 
feature of liver blood supply is determinant for the design of in vivo and ex vivo liver culture systems 
(Nahmias et al. 2006). In culture, hepatocytes displayed zonation; hence, it is pivotal to maintain 
this arrangement when a liver is emulated on a chip (Beckwitt et al. 2018, Moradi et al. 2020). Liver 
Chip design can be performed by standard computer-aided design (CAD) software (AutoCAD, 
Corel Draw, etc.) where the creation of gradients represents a pivotal feature on microfluidic system 
development. Thus, for laminar flows, it is necessary to keep Reynolds numbers low to maintain 
layer integration. Also, shear stress must be fine-tuned to exert cell response upon mechanical 
cues that will maintain the microenvironment homeostasis. Microfluidics allows fluid control that 
mimics the physiological environment. In the case of the liver, the manipulation of fluids allows 
metabolic zonation. Liver research on drug-induced injury and pharmacokinetics is conducted in 
small animals. Hence, species differences (such as genetics and metabolism) limit the lab bench-to￾clinic translation. Even more, a modification on the European cosmetic regulation (EC 1223/2009) 
prohibited the use of products that contain compounds previously tested on animals, accelerating the 
necessity of a human in vitro model of the liver function system development (Blais et al. 2017). In 
Figure 3. (A) Oxygen gradient throughout the hepatic sinusoid. The figure shows the complexity of oxygen delivery for 
pericentral cells. Stimuli and drugs that are delivered by the portal vein are distributed in the same manner (B) Different types 
of bioreactor perfusion strategies. I. Media culture is diffused only on one side of the cell culture. II. Media culture is diffused 
through the cell culture. III. The media culture is diffused through a channel that mimics tissue vasculature. The figure was 
designed using BioRender. 300 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
tissue engineering, there are different approaches to maintain liver tissue organized and functional. 
Reperfusion of the rat liver is widely used since the organ maintains the heterotypic cell-to-cell 
interactions and 3D functional conformation. Nevertheless, isolated livers exhibit a short functional 
lifespan. Thus, researchers developed precision-cut liver slices (0.2 mm) that displayed increased 
viability (~ 72 h) when cultured under a highly oxygenated environment. The use of microfluidic 
devices for the culture of precision-cut slices was successful in detecting unstable drug metabolites 
via high-performance liquid chromatography, due to increased tissue survival to a few days in 
culture (Schumacher et al. 2007, Harrill et al. 2009). On the other hand, Kane et al. maintained the 
viability of hepatocytes in culture by seeding rat liver cells and 3T3-J2 fibroblasts on a system based 
on fenestrated pores, yielding a 2D Micro-Patterned co-culture. Rat hepatocytes showed optimal 
albumin synthesis, normal physiology, and active metabolism (Ren et al. 2012). 
Finally, the recent development of 3D bioprinters represents an excellent alternative to 
achieve liver-like architecture from scratch. The Organovo company uses bioprinting to develop 
a co-culture of human hepatocytes and stellate cells on a 24-well plate format with a lifespan of 
approximately 35 days in vitro, but with a deficient production of albumin that is associated with 
low functional activity (Nguyen et al. 2016). Also, the bioprinting of human-induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs)-derived hepatocytes, adipose-derived cells, and endothelial cells on a hydrogel 
base of Ma and colleagues resembles the hexagonal architecture of the liver, and it was maintained 
up to 8 days in culture, showing low albumin production values of 2–8 mg (day × 106
 cells) 
(Ma et al. 2016). Co-culture of NPC in the engineering of 3D liver tissue models increases hepatocyte 
activity compared to culture alone (Khetani et al. 2015, Beckwitt et al. 2018). Thus, organ-on-a￾chip technology made the Liver Chip system a successful model in terms of cellular phenotype 
preservation and function. There are three types of bioreactors for liver systems: a flat-plate system, 
a packed-bed design, and a hollow fiber design. The latter is a complex system, in which cells 
are arranged as lining fibers that deliver oxygen and nutrients, mimicking perfused vasculature 
(Figure 3B). Cell selection is of primordial importance to develop accurate engineered liver systems. 
Both NPCs and hepatocytes must be present to set out the pharmacodynamics, drug biotransformation, 
and liver disease genesis and progression due to thigh intercommunication between hepatic cells. 
Fresh human isolated hepatocytes are very difficult to obtain, thus there are many commercially 
available cells such as cells isolated from humanized Fah–/– NOD/SCID mice, or the primary human 
hepatocytes isolated from FRG® (Fah–/–/Rag2–/–/ II2rg–/–) mice (Azuma et al. 2007). Surprisingly, 
these cells have no advantage in terms of lifespan in culture when compared to cells isolated from 
standard isolation protocols. Consequently, the best alternative to obtain freshly isolated cells is 
cryopreserved hepatocytes that are readily available for purchase. The downside of the use of 
cryopreserved cells is that function can vary drastically based on the freezing process. Furthermore, 
the HepG2/C3A cancer cell line shows functional resemblance and rapid culture expansion. 
Nonetheless, these cancer cells rely on glycolytic metabolism and are dedifferentiated. Another 
HepG2/C3-like cell line is the HepaRG cell line, which was obtained from a hepatic tumor from a 
patient with hepatitis C. HepaRG grows rapidly in culture and can differentiate into hepatocytes and 
cholangiocytes after 28 days of 1.7% DMSO treatment. Hepatocytes derived from HepaRG present 
similar levels of function and less variability. Recently, HepatoCells were developed by Corning 
and display the same functional activity as HepaRG (Anthérieu et al. 2010). Also, for spheroid 
formation, a 96-well plate that streamlines hanging drop aggregation was created by InSphero 
(Schlieren, Switzerland). This system produces hepatocytes spheroids (250-mm diameter) that 
exhibit very low variability (10%). Liver organoids are very similar to heterotypic 3D spheroids. Ho 
et al. demonstrated that, by creating a radial electrical field by using electrophoresis, circular cellular 
arrangements would be designed on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips. A novel application for 
this microfluidic chip is the use of immunosensors since these would trace hepatotoxicity biomarkers, 
and monitor drug effect on skin sensitization by metabolite production quantification and antigen￾presenting cells (APCs) activation. This model consisted of three components: cell chambers, flow Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 301
channels, and endothelial barriers constructed by using lithography technology. Culture media, 
nutrients, and drugs were delivered by, and endothelial connected to, the cellular compartment. The 
main function of the endothelial barrier was to avoid direct flow but assuring the transfer of oxygen 
and nutrients through diffusion. HepG2 cells were also cultured by Baudoin et al., in a microfluidic 
bioreactor system to investigate HepG2 cell behavior. Microfluidic systems can host different cell 
types to achieve cellular behavior research, by providing an environment that resembles the tissue 
architecture more accurately. Interactions between HepG2 and MCF-7 cells, and their respective 
metabolisms, were studied by Zhang et al. Taken together, the reviewed system represents half of 
a century of research on bioartificial livers. However, it is still unclear if the collected data from 
liver-on-a-chip devices is confident enough, or how it should be utilized on physiologically-based 
pharmacokinetic modeling for safety assessments (Ahmed et al. 2017). 
Renal
The kidney contains a myriad of cell types that build up a 3D structure embedded in a complex 
extracellular matrix and vasculature. Renal xenobiotic excretion is performed by both glomeruli 
filtration and dynamic secretion/reabsorption by the tubular apparatus. Recently, there is a major 
effort to understand the physiology and intracellular metabolism of the proximal tube—the most 
important region within the nephron where filtration takes place. Influx takes place at the basolateral 
and apical membrane of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). Efflux is carried out at the 
apical membrane through the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and multidrug and toxin 
extrusion transporters 1 that, besides efflux, also play an important role in kidney detoxification 
(Wilmer et al. 2016). Drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI) is a major outcome of pharmacotherapy, 
and a comprehensive study of the molecular mechanisms of nephrotoxicity can improve drug 
development. Nevertheless, current models are not suitable to study the biological functions of the 
kidney. The development of cell systems by using improved culturing technologies will eventually 
result in bioengineered 3D devices, which will allow the assessment of nephrotoxicity events. 
To achieve this, it is imperative to identify DIKI biomarkers that could be traced after the testing 
of kidney-on-a-chip devices to understand in vivo response (Arany and Safirstein 2003). Many 
proposed kidney-on-a-chip systems use animal cells such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 
cells, and the porcine LLC-PK1 cell line, since ciPTEC engineered cells require a better molecular 
characterization to be used for the creation of these devices. Also, there are some other considerations 
when using PTEC cells to be considered. These cells are under continuous luminal fluid shear stress 
(FSS) and a trans-epithelial osmotic gradient in vivo. FSS cannot be measured in vivo since the urinary 
flow is decreased along the tubule due to tubular reabsorption. The approximate FSS in humans 
varies between 0.7 dyne/cm2
 and 1.2 dyne/cm2
 under physiological conditions but can increase to 
1.6 dyne/cm2
 during pathology. Modifications on the FSS can disturb signal transduction, iron 
reabsorption, receptor-mediated endocytosis, cytoskeleton organization, cell-to-cell communication, 
as well as gene and protein expression (Adler et al. 2016). For example, an antineoplastic drug, 
Ifosfamide, diminished inflammatory responses, integrin pathway disturbance, and modulation 
of several cancer therapeutic targets under a microfluidic device but these phenomena were not 
detected on static conditions. Tubule curvature is another physiological condition to consider 
when assessing the tubule cell performance in vitro. MDKC cells cultured on curved hollow fibers 
increased transporter activities and highly expressed metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, 3D kidney 
systems attached to an extracellular matrix displayed more sensitivity to develop DIKI, which allows 
long-term toxicity monitoring. Taken together, these studies confirm a critical intercommunication 
between the 3D cellular components and the homeostatic and pathological responses. Nowadays, most 
kidney-on-a-chip are developed by using renal cells seeded on an extracellular matrix or membranes 
next to nutrient delivery microchannels, waste clearance, and constant flow. Microfluidic devices 
are seeded with renal cells and cultured on 2D extracellular matrix-coated membranes, sandwiched 302 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
between PDMS-microchannels, or etched on a glass substrate. Furthermore, 3D tubular systems 
were improved with hollow fibers that resemble the tubular structure formed in hydrogels. These 
systems are now used on FSS studies, and usually consist of a monolayer of human PTECs that show 
active reabsorption seeded inside a fibrin-coated, polyethersulfone (PES)-polyvinyl pyrrolidone 
(PVP) hollow structure implanted in a PDMS-glass chamber. Increased detection/expression of the 
detoxification protein HO-1 following drug administration was compared with data obtained from 
rat models. Even more, microfluidic systems allow researchers to co-culture multiple cell types, 
making accessible the investigation of crosslinked signaling, along with cell-to-cell interactions 
such as immune system cell recruitment and inflammation, which are pivotal features for the study 
of kidney health and injury (Wilmer et al. 2016). Moreover, outstanding molecular techniques such 
as transcriptor activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered regularity interspaced short 
palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) (CRISPR) have been used for the creation of gene 
mutations observed in renal diseases. The future perspective for kidney-on-a-chip devices relies 
on the inclusion of more cell types that can mimic several of the proximal tube functions, such as 
secretion and solute passages. The final goal of this technology is to recreate a model for human 
kidney disease and thus, identify prevention and effective therapeutics. Lastly, it is important to 
highlight that the use of microfluidic culture opens a great opportunity to study the interaction of 
structure and function of the proximal tubule, and apply it to the nephrotoxicity research (Adler 
et al. 2016). 
Neural
The brain is an extremely complex organ, which receives and processes information that is 
transformed into human body responses. Communication between neurons in the brain is via 
unidirectional synapses between the terminal axon of one neuron with the dendrites of another 
one. Neurons also communicate with other cells such as oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, and 
astrocytes. Brain function is accomplished by electrical and chemical signals, but when this 
neuronal communication is disrupted, neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease or 
Alzheimer’s could arise. Neurodegenerative diseases have been a focus of research for decades, 
although the underlying mechanisms of disease onset and progression are still largely unknown. 
The main limitation of these studies is the lack of in vitro model systems that can resemble complex 
tissue structures, intercellular interactions, and responses to stimuli (Bang et al. 2019). The advances 
of brain-on-a-chip technology have not been able to fully engineer the full structure and function 
of the brain, but specific parts of the brain tissue. Traditional culture of neurons on glass substrates 
or Petri dishes has evolved to Whiteside’s soft lithography, where the culture is micro-organized in 
channels. Modification to this method was introduced by using the multistep lithography, where 
soma and axon were compartmentalized, allowing the research to focus on axon’s responses to drug 
treatment, axon regeneration processes, and the reconstruction of the interconnection of several 
neurons (Mofazzal Jahromi et al. 2019). Myelination is the formation of the myelin sheath around 
a nerve fiber and is fundamental for the action potential propagation by electrically separating the 
axon from the environment. Demyelination is the loss of this shield of myelin due to autoimmune 
responses, brain injury, or neurogenerative diseases. Brain-on-a-chip technology could resemble this 
process and allow its study more accurately. Indeed, nowadays there are brain-on-a-chip systems 
that have been shown to be effective for the study of myelinization, although with some limitations 
such as 2D cell adhesion and stiffness of biomaterials (Cummings et al. 2018). On the other hand, 
the brain-blood barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable structure that functions to protect 
the brain from infections, neurotoxicants, and hydrophilic molecules. Thus, there is an imperative 
restriction for large molecules that could be used to treat disease, which has led to failure in drug 
screening stages. To solve this problem, a microfluidic model based on a porous membrane laid 
between two microchannels was developed (Figure 4). Cultured cells can communicate through the Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 303
membrane pores and secreted cytokines. This model allows to mimic the BBB structure. Furthermore, 
the addition of a neural cell-laden hydrogel can establish a 3D cell culture. The transendothelial 
electrical resistance of the BBB can also be measured by the insertion of an electrode in each 
channel. Nevertheless, cell-to-cell interactions are restricted between different cell types since this 
communication depends on long-range cytokine secretion. Furthermore, physical interaction can 
be achieved by increasing pore density, thus increasing intercellular interaction (Bang et al. 2019). 
Besides the brain-on-a-chip developed system, a cord-on-a-chip has also been created by Sances 
et al., where induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ventral spinal neurons were co-cultured 
with brain endothelial cells in the porous-membrane-based device. The culture expressed SST at the 
same levels as a fetus. These results highlight the importance of endothelial cell–neuron interaction 
and a 3D culture environment. The technology of brain-on-a-chip can be divided into different 
platforms, with 3D high-content systems being arguably the most promising in vitro models. These 
systems resemble the whole brain environment, such as the interconnected multichip systems that 
can respond to external and internal stimuli. These high-throughput systems can allow massive 
screening (Zakharova et al. 2020). It is important to highlight the need for additional features for 
brain-on-a-chip development such as cell sources, cell-to-cell interactions, and cell-extracellular 
matrix interactions. These devices are necessary to implement personalized analysis of individual 
conditions and for the prediction of the treatment outcome (Mofazzal Jahromi et al. 2019). 
12. Challenges and forecast of organs-on-a-chip
So far, organ-on-a-chip technologies have enjoyed great interest, allowing the creation of various 
biomimetic systems for virtually any relevant organ or tissue. Even so, its insertion in industry and 
society has not been as disruptive as other techs such as 3D printing itself, machine learning, blockchain, 
or even e-health technology. Organs-on-a-chip, together with a large part of biomedical and clinical 
trends, must go through slow but necessary filters that must ensure that their implementation will 
be the safest, most regulated, and the most beneficial. However, compared to other trends, OOCs 
have a particular limitation. Due to the enormous dependence that preclinical research has on two￾dimensional cell cultures and animal models, the transition to biomimetic models will be (and must

be) laborious and time-consuming, since such rigorous changes in the backbone of pharmaceutical 
research must be accomplished with the utmost caution. Because of this, Zhang et al. concluded 
in their work that this technology would be “more evolutionary than revolutionary” (Zhang et al. 
2018). Even if partial or total adoption of OOC technology is achieved, other valuable challenges 
are coming from the personalized medicine model, such as the personalization, customization, and 
democratization of these devices. 
Adoption
Even with the number of deficiencies that modern preclinical models present, current chip models 
are not necessarily finer substitutes. A more complex model does not mean it will be better at 
meeting the current needs of biomedical research. Therefore, it is necessary to specify important 
goals and milestones on the path to technological adoption. For this purpose, the work of Allwardt 
et al. presents a linear roadmap, touching the most important challenges and requirements to achieve 
the adoption of organs-on-a-chip (Allwardt et al. 2020). However, despite its utility displaying the 
value proposition of this transition, these emerging technologies almost always are developed in 
parallel. Accordingly, the homologation and consensus on organ-on-a-chip design perhaps should 
not lie in the overall process, but concrete challenges. Consequently, this work presents two of the 
most important breakthroughs to achieve the desirable transition: validation and industrialization. 
Validation 
Preclinical research models, even with their downsides, are ideal for conducting strict and standardized 
studies. In consequence, one of the first challenges to consider for validation is the transition from 
proofs-of-concept to robust and homogeneous models, capable of achieving reproducibility and 
high fidelity. This, by itself, is composed of various challenges. The first might start by defining the 
design, materials, and manufacturing standards. Within this, collaborative and serious discussions 
should begin on the correct anatomical and physiological scaling, the fidelity of the cultured cells, 
the type of materials to be used, and any other factor that requires homologation to yield analytically 
coherent and trustworthy testing models. Another valuable detail is the adaption of organs-on-a￾chip to the standard analytical assessing systems, such as automated microplate reader systems. For 
this, a series of researchers have begun to adapt their chip models to this type of equipment (Phan 
et al. 2017, Gaio et al. 2018). Potentially the biggest and most apparent problem is the difficulty 
and intricacy of comparing OCCs against other preclinical models, since procedures for evaluating 
toxicity, metabolic activity, or response to drugs are divergent. With all these considerations, the 
validation and conversion of OOCs into gold standards may depend on the consensus of different 
parties, such as biomedical and clinical researchers, scientific societies, the private pharmaceutical 
industry, and government and regulatory organisms. 
Industrialization and commercialization
The adoption success of these models will not only depend on their suitability as testing models, 
but also their industrial scaling, their market size, and their economic feasibility overall. Due to this, 
special emphasis has been placed in this work on material and manufacturing process selection. The 
price and amount of the materials, as well as the ease and simplicity of the production process, should 
be considered by the researcher if commercialization is desirable. Moreover, being a relatively new 
and disruptive technology, the global market size of organs-on-a-chip is quite small when compared 
to other technologies, hovering between $5 and $43 million dollars in recent years. However, the 
estimated compound annual growth rates are huge, hovering between 30% and 63.2%, thus making 
the market projection very attractive in the next few years. This can partially be interpreted as the 
interest that the academy, the pharmaceutical industry, and the new OOC start-ups have in this Basics of Organ-On-A-Chip Technology 305
technology. Hence, despite the considerable challenges to achieve industrialization, economic 
behavior seems to open valuable opportunities to skyrocket this tech. 
Customization 
Customization is one of the main pillars of the personalized medicine model, and one that can be 
extrapolated to tissue engineering and OCCs. The ability to make biomimetic models for “each one” 
would be distant, but also a very desirable step to follow. Pharmacological profiles can vary from 
person to person depending on their gender, age, race, ethnicity, genetic polymorphisms, unique 
mutations, and overall lifestyle, approaching various biomedical trends closer to the needs of the 
individual. For example, fields like pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics have already offered 
several commercial platforms for the development of personalized therapies and diets. However, 
due to the very flexibility of the technology, engineering an ad hoc organ-on-a-chip for a specific 
individual is not only possible, but it would potentially be the richest and most reliable source of 
information for pharmacological and toxicological assessment (Van Den Berg et al. 2019).
Democratization
Along with customization, the democratization of OOC technology is a distant, but worthy 
flagship challenge. Organs-on-a-chip are expensive systems to produce, so increasing their 
accessibility to both the scientific community and the general population could lead to some of 
the most significant innovations within biomedical sciences. On one side, the popularization of 
these models among scientists could greatly enhance the quality of experimental outputs, as well 
as providing an encouraging opportunity to replace animal models almost entirely. The latter, seen 
from both a bioethical and scientific perspective, is immensely beneficial. For this, scalability and 
industrialization must be as efficient as the current cell culture industry is for researchers, institutes, 
and companies. Another important approach to consider comes from the democratization of 
information, where the proliferation of databases and research networks could benefit the production 
of home-run testing models. However, the most prodigious goal lies in the democratization of 
this technology for the general population. The creation of chips that are not only for “each one”, 
but for “each and everyone” might stand as the most ambitious objective in the future of OOCs. 
Under ideal circumstances, custom chips could be designed for most of the population. That level 
of accessibility would not only allow every person to evaluate the efficacy and safety of their 
medications with reliable and high-throughput screening models, but it could change the paradigm 
of how pharmacological screening will be assessed in the future. 
13. Conclusions
Organ-on-a-chip technology is one of the most disruptive and promising technologies within the 
biomedical field, by being introduced as the future alternative to 2D cultures and animal testing 
models. Upon this development, a very appreciable series of biomimetic models have been made with 
a plethora of integrated materials, techniques, and components. However, this parallel development 
has not yet been sufficiently uniform, leaving several milestones to reach within the roadmap to 
clinical adoption, industrialization, and democratization. Therefore, for the optimal and successful 
designing of future chips, various considerations, ranging from the biological and medical fields to 
physics and engineering backgrounds, will have to be considered if partial or complete acceptance 
and insertion of the tech is desirable. Given this interdisciplinarity, much emphasis has been placed 
in this chapter on approaching organ-on-a-chip design from a comprehensive perspective, since 
much of the success might not only depend on technical details but compendious considerations. 
Ultimately, this compendious approach may open a valuable opportunity for consensus and one 306 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
more step in the transition from proofs-of-concept to more ideal and more robust devices, which 
simultaneously are expected to be more ethical, more accessible, and more equitable.

1. Introduction 
Since the beginning of the industrial age, chemical productions have required the use of catalysts 
to implement most processes. Among the huge number of possibilities, heterogeneous catalysts 
supported onto carbonaceous materials have always stood as the most competitive ones. Catalysts 
such as Lindlar’s (Lindlar 1952) marked the history of industrial chemistry reaching new heights of 
performances.
The use of nanostructured carbonaceous species represented a step forward for carbon supported 
catalysts and nanostructured carbonaceous materials encompass a great number of heterogeneous 
compounds. They can be broadly classified in two main families. The first is composed of carbon 
allotropes such as fullerene (Omacrsawa 2012), graphene (Zhu 2017) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 
(Endo et al. 2013). The morphology of these materials can be tuned leading to the formation of 
carbon quantum dots (Hola et al. 2014), nanohorns (Pagona et al. 2009), nanofibers (Ko and Wan 
2014), nanoribbons (James and Tour 2012), nanocages (Wu et al. 2019) and other morphologies 
(Coville et al. 2011). All of these materials have sizes in the range of nanometers and a well-defined 
morphology.
The second group is represented by the fully engineered carbonaceous materials realized by 
designing hybrid and hierarchical shapes never seen before. These materials are rationally nano‐
architectured by using pre-assembled or bioinspired scaffolds. This approach introduces a new level 
of control in the nano- and microscale assembly of the materials.
All these materials combined with nano- and microparticles represent the new frontier for 
heterogeneous catalysis. In this chapter, we overview graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 
other nanostructured carbons as catalysts for the realization of heterogeneous catalysts. After a brief

materials’ introduction about materials, we discuss the main catalytic procedures where nanocarbon 
supported catalysts are used, enlightening the advantages and peculiarities of each catalyst herein 
reported.
2. Nanocarbon materials: Structures and modifications
2.1 Nano and nanostructured carbon 
2.1.1 Graphene and related materials
Ideal Graphene is a material composed of an infinite single plane of pure graphitic carbon. Graphene 
elementary cell structure contains atoms bonded by three in-plane σ bonds with the p orbital system 
perpendicular to the sp2
 plane. As a consequence, graphene displays a full delocalization of π bonds 
on its all structure, allowing the electrons to freely move in the graphene plane (Mintmire et al. 
1992, Yan et al. 2009, Dresselhaus et al. 2010). The electron mobility in the graphene plane is the 
reason for its high electrical conductivity (Rhee 2020).
The properties of graphene are leveraged by its difficult handability and scarce availability 
(Lee et al. 2016). Additionally, a great part of scientific literature uses the term graphene to define 
few layered materials and even nanographite (Narita et al. 2015, Sun et al. 2020). To overcome 
the troubles related to the use of real graphene, several materials have been proposed. The first 
material is graphene oxide (GO). GO is highly oxidized graphene carrying a great amount of oxygen 
residues (Brisebois and Siaj 2020). The main functionalities of GO basal lattice are epoxy and 
hydroxyl residues while carboxylic ones are more represented on its edges. Contrary to graphene, 
GO structure is closely related to the productive way adopted for its study. 
Production of GO saw the light over one and half century ago with the pioneering studies of 
Brodie in 1859. He investigated the oxidation of graphite trying to define the atomic weight of 
carbon (Brodie 1859) by using a mixture of nitric acid and potassium chlorate and the process 
time can go upto days. After this long oxidative process, he produced light-yellow powder made 
by tiny shining flakes. He named the material graphitic acid but nowadays it is known worldwide 
under the name of GO. Half a century later, Staudenmaier described a new reaction for the 
production of “graphitic acids” by using an acidic solution of KClO3
 (Staudenmaier 1898). Another 
route to GO was described by Hummers and Offeman in the middle of the 20th century (William 
et al. 1958). Authors treated graphite with a sulphuric acid solution containing both sodium nitrate 
and potassium permanganate. Afterwards, Hummers’ method became the most used process to 
produce graphite oxide even if all three above-mentioned protocols are still used to produce GO 
with different features. On this very same topic, Poh and co-workers (Poh et al. 2012) reported an 
exhaustive research characterizing reduced GO (rGO) produced from GO. Authors enlighten the 
relevancy of the concentration and types of oxygen-containing residues of GO used as precursor for 
the preparation of rGO due to the different production pathways adopted. 
Due to the different synthetic routes, GO composition and non-stoichiometric structure are 
closely dependent on the product steps (Araújo et al. 2017). As a consequence, several studies 
have described different spatial arrangement for GO, namely the Ruess, Szabo, Hofmann, 
Nakajima-Matsuo, Lerf-Klinowski and Scholz-Boehm models (Szabó et al. 2006), as reported in 
Figure 1(b)–(g). 
Scientists generally agreed the Lerf-Klinowski model is the most representative one and it 
matches quite well the real structure of GO as proved by numerous experimental data (Lerf 
et al. 1997). Based on this model, defective regions (i.e., cracks, holes, wrinkles and impurities) are 
induced by the oxidative procedure used for the production.
Scientists’ interest have been caught not only by GO but also by the previously mentioned 
rGO. rGO is a rising star in the research world of graphene (Thakur and Karak 2015). Actually, it Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 315
is produced through a reduction process of GO by using several reductive agents (Guex et al. 2017, 
Liu et al. 2011). Through reductive process, the oxygen-based groups of GO are removed forming 
rGO with a C/O ratio ranging from 12.5 wt.% to 0.4 wt.% (Lee et al. 2019). Both GO and rGO are 
characterized by high surface area and a good chemical and thermal stability representing a bright 
new generation of nanosized carbon support for plenty of catalysis applications.
2.1.2 Carbon nanotubes
Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are a tube-shaped allotropic form of carbon, with a diameter in the 
nanometers range and shape similar to those sketched in Figure 2.
CNTs have different structures as they differ in length, thickness, the type of helicity and 
number of layers. The number of layers defines them as single wall CNT (SWCNT), double wall 
CNT (DWCNT) and multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) while the terms for their helicity are armchair, 
zig-zag and chiral. CNTs have a high aspect ratio up to 106 (Li et al. 2007) and exhibit unusual 
mechanical properties such as high toughness and elastic moduli (Treacy et al. 1996). Furthermore,

Figure 2. Example of “zig-zag” (a) single wall CNT (SWCNT) and (b) multiwalled CNT (MWCNT).316 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
CNTs show very attractive electrical properties as their behaviour ranges from semiconducting to 
metallic (Lekawa‐Raus et al. 2014, Bandaru 2007). Several procedures have been developed to 
produce CNTs on a large scale such as arc discharge (Arora and Sharma 2014), laser ablation (Scott 
et al. 2001), chemical vapor deposition (Kumar and Ando 2010) and flame synthesis approach 
(Hamzah et al. 2017).
2.1.3 Other carbonaceous materials
Other than allotropic carbon, several carbonaceous materials have gained a lot of interest for 
catalytic application.
Among them, carbon black (CB) has led the field for decades with many applications (Yang 
et al. 2011). CB particles represent the most common carbon support in industry due to its large 
availability, low cost and robustness. Nonetheless, other carbon materials have gained a great interest 
such bioderived activated carbons (ACs) and templated carbon structures. ACs are very interesting 
due to their sustainable production and large surface area together with residual functionalities such 
hydroxylic groups. While ACs totally or partially retained the structure of the biomass used for their 
production, template carbons shapes can be tailored creating completely new architectures. This 
process based on the creation of a removable support for the carbon growth opens the way for a 
vast realm of morphologies such as graphene sponges (Zhao et al. 2012) and mesoporous carbons 
(Kyotani et al. 1997).
2.2 Tailored nanocarbon properties: Functionalization and decoration
Pure carbonaceous structures rarely show a remarkable catalytic activity mainly because of the 
functionalities on the carbon surface or of deposited structures such as inorganic species. In the 
next subsections, we report the main features of organic and inorganic tailoring processes and their 
effects on the catalytic activity of nanocarbonaceous materials. 
2.2.1 Organic surface functionalization
Organic functionalization of carbon surface is a well-established practice and could lead to the 
introduction of plenty of different functionalities, which are summarized in Figure 3.
Introduction of functionalities deeply affects the catalytic performances of graphene as 
described by Sun and co-workers (Sun et al. 2012) with a decrease of activity due to the defects of 
carbonaceous structure. However, other studies have proved that the introduction of defects into 
the sp2
 plane could enhance certain reactivities (Lai et al. 2011). A newcomer to the field is hence 
faced with mixed opinions on the topic and contradictory results. It is quite hard to find a straight 
line through the immense literature on graphene and related materials but it is possible to say that 
promotion and depletion of catalytic activity is related to both functionalities and catalytic reaction. 
Accordingly, Lemes and co-workers (Lemes et al. 2019) described the nitrogen doped graphene 
enhanced activity during the oxygen reduction process and Zhang reported the same results by 
considering sulphur doped materials (Zhang et al. 2014).
Considering CNTs instead of graphene simplifies the discussion. Functional groups introduced 
on the CNTs surface magnify their catalytic activity. Cao and co-workers (Cao et al. 2018) reported 
the role of carboxylic function on the surface of MWCTNs for the active promotion of phenol 
oxidation. Similarly, Qui et al. (Qui et al. 2011) have shown that all oxygen containing groups 
participate in the oxidative processes.
On ACs and TCSs, residual groups are abundant and their effect is remarkable. Szymański et al. 
(Szymański et al. 2004) clearly show this phenomenon during the reduction of NOx to NH3
. 
Introduction of functionalities is not the only procedure to enhance the catalytic activity of 
nanostructured carbons. A simpler approach is based on the increment of surface area by using Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 317
chemical or physical activation. These processes are not used for graphene and CNTs but they are 
very performing for bioderived carbon and represent the common production route for AC. AC 
can be obtained through treatment of carbon by using steam or CO2 as described by many authors 
(Molina-Sabio et al. 1996, Bouchelta et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2004). Steam activation is classified 
as a physical activation process: it removes the tar and increases the pore size. CO2
 activation is 
based on the reaction:
CO2(g) + C(S) 2 CO(g) (1)
This reaction (Equation 1) removes part of the carbon matrix with an increment of both porosity 
and surface area and positively affects the catalytic performances as reported for instance by Diaz 
et al. (Díaz et al. 2007). Similar results can be achieved by using KOH (Lin et al. 2013) or HNO3 
(Liu et al. 2011).
2.2.2 Inorganic surface tailoring
Carbon materials are often used as support for inorganic nanostructures in catalytic applications. 
There are three main routes for tailoring the carbon surface with nanoparticles as summarized in 
Figure 4: chemical reduction of metal precursors, metal vapour deposition (MVD) and carbothermal 
processes.
Figure 3. Summary of different functionalities introduced onto carbonaceous structures.318 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Chemical reduction of metal precursors is a simple approach based on the use of a reduction 
agent such as NaBH4
 or H2
. The process leads to an inhomogeneous particle size distribution in 
absence of any additives such as polymers (Chen and Xing 2005).
MVD is based on the simultaneous condensation at very low temperature of a metal vapor with 
a vapor of a weakly stabilizing organic solvent. After co-deposition, the frozen matrix is allowed 
to melt, generating solvent-stabilized metal microclusters MVD with a good control on particle 
size and distribution as described by Oberhauser et al. (Oberhauser et al. 2015). MVD drawback 
is represented by the unanchored nanostructures that only interact with the carbonaceous matrix 
though weak forces.
Carbothermal processes represent a good compromise between the high performances of MVD 
and the facile synthesis through chemical reduction. Carbothermal routes induce the reduction of a 
metal salt using the carbon support as a reducing agent in an inert atmosphere at high temperature. 
This method leads to well anchored particles but damages the carbonaceous structure and its use is 
discouraged in combination with precious carbon nanostructures such as graphene or CNTs related 
materials. On the contrary, the other two approaches could be used without concern with any kind 
of nanostructured carbon. The further advantage of carbothermal reduction is the drastic increment 
of carbon support surface area.
3. Nanostructured and nanosized carbon materials: Catalytic 
applications
3.1 Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds
The research for new recyclable hydrogenation catalysts promoted the synthesis of a great deal of 
heterogeneous catalysts (Nishimura 2001). In this context, metal supported onto carbon structures 
find plenty of applications due to the unique combination of tunability and robustness.
Selective hydrogenation of carbon–carbon unsaturated bonds is a widely studied topic. The 
most investigated systems are based on the use of platinum or palladium atoms due to their activity 
on hydrogenation reactions. A key study on the topic was reported by Efremenko and Sheintuch 
(Efremenko and Sheintuch 1998). Authors performed a quantum mechanical analysis of the 
interactions between carbon materials and palladium clusters providing a deep insight into Pd/C 
bonding, functional-group effects, and cluster growth on carbon surfaces. Efremenko and Sheintuch 
(Efremenko and Sheintuch 1998) showed that the surface carbon formed much stronger bonds to the 
basal graphite plane. Furthermore, data collected by studying ACs proved an increment of palladium 
clusters activity due to a delocalized donor–acceptor interaction with the support π system orbital 
system.
About the conversion of phenylacetylene to styrene, the effect of modification of graphitic 
structure to enhance catalytic properties of nanoparticles supported onto carbonaceous materials 
Figure 4. Approaches to nanoparticle tailoring of carbon surfaces.Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 319
was investigated by Xia et al. (Xia et al. 2019). Authors produced a nitrogen doped graphene tailored 
with nanoparticles of platinum and tested it in the process of semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. 
Through DFT calculations, authors proved that the remarkable activity of the catalyst was due to the 
confinement effect of doped graphene on styrene. This effect promotes the styrene desorption from 
nanoparticles surface avoiding its over reduction to benzyl ethanol. 
A similar effect was observed by Wang et al. (Wang et al. 2017a) by using a bimetallic Pt-Au 
nanostructured system supported onto CNT. Authors claimed that the enhanced selectivity obtained 
by the catalyst was due to a hindered surface dynamic of the nanoscale bimetallic phases and the 
preference for desorption of partial hydrogenation products. 
The high selectivity reached by using metal nanoparticles supported on CNTs was compared 
with all traditional catalysts by Teschner et al. (Teschner et al. 2006). Authors clearly proved carbon￾based nanomaterials outperformed the other carbon supported catalyst in selectivity and turn over 
frequency.
The other class of hydrogenation reactions is the selective reduction of carbon–carbon 
unsaturated bonds when carbonyl functions are also present. Among them, the selective reduction of 
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is relevant in the manufacture of fine chemical intermediates. 
The selective reduction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl species still remains a hot topic even if it has 
been widely investigated. Chemoselective reduction of cinnamaldehyde represents a perfect case of 
study for the comparison of different nanocarbon based catalysts.
Truong-Huu et al. (Truong-Huu et al. 2012) supported palladium nanoparticles onto a few 
layers of graphene. They reported a high selectivity for carbon–carbon double bond hydrogenation 
due to the very accessible surface together with fast intermediate products’ desorption. Peres et al. 
(Peres et al. 2019) modified a similar graphene structure by tailoring the surface with platinum 
concave nanocubes stabilized by alkyl amines. The presence of the aminic stabilizer improved the 
stability of the nanoparticles and at high concentration promoted the chemoselectivity for carbon 
oxygen unsaturation reduction. The effect of amine was also studied by Dongil and co-workers 
(Dongil et al. 2011) by grafting ruthenium phosphine complexes on GO and graphite in the presence 
of amine groups, showing variations in activity and selectivity after the amine-functionalization.
An iridium-based catalyst was described by Li et al. (Li et al. 2019a). Authors supported the 
iridium cluster onto graphene aerogel made by converting GO into rGO. Also, in this case carbonyl 
functionality was reduced with a high chemoselectivity over carbon–carbon unsaturated bond. This 
was due to the weak interaction occurring between cinnamaldehyde and iridium supported materials 
as reported by Wang and co-workers (Wang et al. 2019). 
CNTs have been also studied for similar catalytic reactions. Ma et al. (Ma et al. 2017) studied 
the confinement effect of CNTs surface and how this phenomenon affects the product distribution 
by using a ruthenium catalyst. Authors reported a high selectivity for hydrocinnamaldehyde when 
ruthenium nanostructures were dispersed on the outer walls of CNTs and a high selectivity for 
hydrocinnamyl alcohol when the particles were confined within CNTs’ inner cavity facilitating 
hydrogenation. Results proved the interactions between the confined nanoparticles are responsible 
for a crucial role of modulating the product distribution.
This was also reported by several studies showing a high hydrocinnamaldehyde selectivity 
by using nanoparticles dispersed onto the surface of CNTS (Tessonnier et al. 2005, Vu et al. 2006, 
Zhu et al. 2019).
Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were also used for the same reactions as reported by Jung co-workers 
(Jung et al. 2009). In this study, authors compared several carbon supported catalysts with CNF 
such as those supported on ACs and CNTs showing a strong influence of carbon nanomaterials’ 
textures on the catalytic performances. Carbon black (CB) was also used as described by Szumełda 
et al. (Szumełda et al. 2014) by tailoring it with palladium/gold particles by using microemulsion 
technique showing a tunable selectivity based on gold percentage.320 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
3.2 Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis 
Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is the conversion process of a carbon monoxide and hydrogen 
mixture into (a) saturated or (b) unsaturated liquid hydrocarbons as sketched in the following 
scheme: 
(a) nCO + (2n+1) H2 Cn
H2n+2 + nH2
O
(b) nCO + 2nH2 Cn
H2n + nH2
O (2)
FTS is a pillar of industrial gas-to-liquid technology used for the production of an oil substitute 
starting from reforming of typically coal, natural gas, or biomass. Cobalt-containing catalysts are 
very active during FTS by using a H2
:CO ratio of around 2. Nonetheless, H2
/CO produced from 
cheap feedstocks such as low quality coal or biomass are characterized by lower ratios and in these 
cases cobalt-iron doped catalysts could be more effective. Supports of these metals are an essential 
part of the FTS conversion and carbon ones are commonly used due to the tunable pore sizes and 
high surface area.
In 2015, Karimi co-workers (Karimi et al. 2015) firstly described the use of graphene tailored 
with 15 wt.% of cobalt as an efficient catalyst for FTS. Their catalyst was able to work for up to 
480h with a decrease of only 22% of the initial conversion efficiency. Karimi’s research group 
moved a step forward in improving the stability of cobalt catalysts using graphene nanosheets 
improving the conversion in the same condition after 480 h of working time to 92% (Karimi 
et al. 2015). Luo and co-workers (Luo et al. 2020a) studied the effect of oxidation of the graphene 
support before the cobalt deposition. Pretreatment improved the catalyst activity as a consequence 
of the increment of defect sites, improvement of support-metal interaction and cobalt dispersion. 
Taghavi et al. (Taghavi et al. 2017) evaluated the roles of nitrogen-based residual groups on the 
surface of graphene on the selectivity, activity and stability of cobalt-containing catalyst during FTS 
with a gain of 4% of conversion compared with non-functionalized one. A more detailed insight 
on the effect of nitrogen groups on FTS was reported by Chernyak et al. (Chernyak et al. 2019). 
Authors studied GO and nitrogen doped graphene nanoflakes as supports for cobalt-containing 
FTS catalysts. Authors observed a decrease of activity with the localization of nitrogen sites on the 
nitrogen group’s particle edges.
Wang and co-workers (Wang et al. 2019) developed a three-dimensional nitrogen doped 
graphene aerogel with an increased activity compared to classical graphene catalyst.
Zhao et al. (Zhao et al. 2013), using supported nanoparticles of iron oxide on pyrolytic GO, 
found a close relationship between carbon supports and iron poisoning during FTS.
CNTs have also been studied as in the research by Chernyak et al. (Chernyak et al. 2020). 
Authors decorated CNTs with up to 30 wt.% of cobalt nanoparticles showing that the catalyst 
sintering increased its stability, depleting the formation of wax.
A cheaper nanostructured carbon support was used by Asalieva et al. (Asalieva et al. 2020). In 
their work, exfoliated graphite was combined with cobalt pellets showing a favourable influence of 
the graphitic additive with a catalyst productivity of 455 Kg/h. 
The use of carbon spheres was described by Dlamini et al. (Dlamini et al. 2020) through 
carbonization of melamine derivatives showing good performances by using just a 10 wt.% of 
cobalt. Also, hollow carbon spheres could be used with very close results by carbonization of 
poly(styrene) precursors (Phaahlamohlaka et al. 2020).
Another profitable route for FTS is represented by the combination of AC supported catalysts 
with inorganic additives such as zeolite (Karre et al. 2013), silica (Pei et al. 2015), zirconia (Wang 
et al. 2004, 2008) or KMnO4 (Tian et al. 2017).Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 321
3.3 Hydrodesulfurization 
Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a well established procedure for the treatment of high sulphur content 
oils with the removal of organic sulphur as H2
S under high pressure of hydrogen (Startsev 1995). 
This process is mediated by inorganic catalyst used as oxide such as CoO, NiO, MoQ and W03
or as sulfides (Vasudevan and Fierro 1996). The crucial point for the catalyst’s preparation is the 
dispersion of such species in a very effective way. Nanostructured carbons have good performances 
during the synthesis of HDS catalysts. Wang and co-workers (Wang et al. 2015a) prepared a Ni-Mo 
catalyst supported on rGO/mesoporous TiO2 and tested it for dibenzothiophene HDS. This study 
on a model compound showed the incorporation of the acidic catalyst on the rGO, thus promoting 
H2
S formation. Hajjar et al. (Hajjar et al. 2017) treated naphtha by using a Co-Mo/graphene material 
produced through spray pyrolysis technique. Again, the catalyst acidity was a key feature with a 
total acidity of 5 mmol/g. The catalyst showed a desulfurization activity close to 100% that is quite 
remarkable considering the high sulphur content of the feedstock of up to 2.8 wt.%. Similarly, 
Saleh and Al-Hammadi (Saleh and Al-Hammadi 2021) use a Ni-Mo catalyst supported onto 
graphene to enhance the activity of Ni-MO species increasing the desulfurization from 84% to 99%. 
Also, Co-Mo catalysts were developed and used such as the one described by Xu and co-workers 
(Xu et al. 2019) and zeolite/graphene hybrids as the one described by Ali et al. (Ali and Saleh 2020).
CNTs have been used by Yang et al. (Yang et al. 2019) to support palladium based materials 
for the treatment of dibenzothiophenes solutions. Authors claimed an activity three times higher 
than the commercial NiMoS supported onto alumina Al2
O3
 catalyst and significantly higher than 
the other traditional metal silicide catalysts. Liu et al. (Liu et al. 2018) used a NiMoS supported 
onto CNTs, thus proving the better catalytic activity of these well-known species when deposited 
onto CNTs’ surface. Co-Mo based catalysts were studied in combination with CNTs monolithic 
structures, proving the positive effect of these “nanoscale reactors” (Soghrati et al. 2012, 2014) that 
can compete with more traditional zeolite based catalysts.
Far from the frontiers on nanostructured carbon materials, CB has played a major role as support 
for HDS catalyst as overviewed by Gheek in 2007 paper “Carbon black composites—supports of 
HDS catalysts” (Gheek et al. 2007). Similarly, Wang and co-workers (Wang et al. 2017b) supported 
a Ni-Mo species on carbon through carbothermal procedures showing good performances on the 
HDS of model compounds. In this case, the catalyst calcination temperature is a crucial feature for 
an effective material’s production as reported by Abubakar et al. (Abubakar et al. 2019). Authors 
explored a range of calcination temperatures up to 400ºC showing that the catalyst produced at 
300ºC represents the best combination of physiochemical properties and catalytic activity. Similar 
considerations were reported by Farag et al. (Farag et al. 1999) that added a further step by 
comparing carbon support with alumina. Authors found that all the preparation parameters affected 
the nanostructured carbon supports and they must be tuned according to the different catalysts aimed.
Further studies showed a good enhancement of catalytic performances of carbon-inorganic 
hybrid support as in the case of carbon mixed with alumina (Nikulshin et al. 2014) or aluminosilicates 
(Aridi and Al-Daous 2009).
3.4 Hydroformylation
Hydroformylation is a catalytic procedure for the conversion of alkene into carbonyl compounds as 
sketched as follows:
R
+ CO + H2 R
O
H (3)
Traditionally, hydroformylation was performed by using phosphine or amine rhodium, 
ruthenium and cobalt complexes (Van Leeuwen and Claver 2002).322 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Cobalt was supported onto carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by Qiu et al. (Qiu et al. 2006) by 
simple reduction of a cobalt precursor. Cobalt nanoparticles supported onto CNFs showed a high 
homogeneous dispersion with spherical shape and an average diameter around 14 nm. This catalyst 
displayed a remarkable activity and regioselectivity for 1‐octene hydroformylation with conversion 
of up to 70%.
Zhang and co-workers (Zhang et al. 1999) described the tailoring of CNTs surface with phosphine 
rhodium species used for the hydroformylation of 1-propene. Authors compared the CNTs supported 
catalyst with the same rhodium complexes supported onto AC and silica. Authors claimed a superior 
activity of CNTs based catalysts and a very high regioselectivity to t-butylaldehyde formation. The 
reason was due to the nanosized CNTs tubular together with their hydrophobic surface made by six 
membered aromatic rings.
Similar results were described by Tan and co-workers (Tan et al. 2017) using rGO as support 
during the terminal olefins hydroformylation in the presence of phosphine-based ligand and 
rhodium. rGO is a very promising support for this process as shown by Tan et al. (Tan et al. 2016) 
due to its ability to outperform even CNTs supported rhodium catalysts.
3.5 Cross coupling reactions 
A cross-coupling reaction is a process where two species are combined together with the formation 
of a new carbon-heteroatom or carbon–carbon bond promoted by a metal catalyst (Miyaura and 
Buchwald 2002). In the next subsections, we will describe the carbon–carbon bond formation 
through mechanisms as the one summarized in Figure 5. 
The formation of new carbon bonds through cross-coupling represents a key tool for synthetic 
chemistry and the development of new efficient catalysts is an open challenge. Heterogeneous 
catalysts are far less performing than homogeneous one (Pagliaro et al. 2012) but their high stability 
along multiple catalytic processes counterbalance the inferior activity. Nanocarbons are widely used 
in cross-coupling processes due to the versatility of surface tailoring that lead to well-exposed and 
anchored metal particles able to catalyse a wide range of reactions as reported by Cornelio and co￾workers (Cornelio et al. 2013). In the following subsections, we are reporting the main achievements 
related to the use of heterogeneous catalysts applied in the cross-coupling reactions.
Figure 5. Schematic pathway of cross-coupling reaction for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 323
3.5.1 Suzuki-miyaura reactions
Suzuki-Miyaura reaction is a cross-coupling reaction where the coupling species are a boronic 
acid derivative and an organohalide catalysed by a Pd(0) specie as summarized in Figure 6. 
A wide diffusion of this synthetic approach has led to the development of various palladium 
supported onto carbon used for the synthesis of several biaryl and heterocyclic compounds 
(Maluenda and Navarro 2015, Beletskaya et al. 2019). It could be used for various non-aryl organic 
moieties coupling such as alkenes, alkynes, or alkanes. The very first example of reaction of Suzuki 
mediate by a palladium supported onto carbon was described by Marck et al. (Marck et al. 1994) 
without additional phosphine ligands in aqueous solvent. 
In aqueous media, Diler al. (Diler et al. 2020) achieved good results by using mono dispersed 
palladium nanoparticles supported onto GO. Similarly, Hemmati et al. (Hemmati et al. 2019) 
supported palladium nanoparticles on metformin modified producing high recyclable catalysts.
The introduction of nitrogen atoms and functionalities on graphene supports has been proved 
as a very powerful way to improve the catalyst activity as described by many authors (Ibrahim 
et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2020a, Movahed et al. 2014, Rana et al. 2015, Zarnegaryan et al. 2019) 
due to the enhancement of basicity of the catalyst itself. Other authors explored more exotic ways 
to produce catalysts such as the biosynthesis (Salehi et al. 2019) or the production of graphene 
nanocages (Wang et al. 2014). Tran et al. (Tran et al. 2018) wisely introduced benzene-1,4-diboronic 
acid as an intercalating agent in a GO supported palladium catalyst for improving activity and 
durability. Huang et al. (Huang et al. 2018) used a mixture of 3-D structured amine ionic liquid 
functionalized graphene aerogel to produce tough and easily recoverable, highly recyclable, and 
stable catalysts.
Another attractive approach is represented by the production of magnetically recoverable 
catalyst by the addition of Fe3
O4
 nanoparticle to more standard catalysts such as palladium onto 
graphene materials (Elazab et al. 2015, Feng et al. 2014, Hoseini et al. 2015, Niakan et al. 2020, 
Rafiee et al. 2019).
Furthermore, other metals’ activity was explored as doping agent as in the case of Ni2
O3 
(Nie et al. 2014) or as self-active one as for gold nanoparticles (Candu et al. 2017, Mondal et al. 
2015, Thomas et al. 2017) or copper complexes (Ansari and Bhat 2019, Anuma et al. 2019, Kumar 
et al. 2019).
Figure 6. Reaction pathway of Suzuki-Miyaura reaction.324 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Palladium supported on CNTs was also deeply used in Suzuki couplings (Corma et al. 2005). 
There are plenty of reports about the use of palladium supported by MWCNTs (Navidi et al. 2013, 
Sullivan et al. 2009) and SWCNTs (Veisi et al. 2014, Yang et al. 2015).
Also, CNTs surface tailoring with thiols (Lee et al. 2017, Veisi et al. 2019) or amine (Ghorbani￾Vaghei et al. 2015) groups has become a well-established practice to tune the solubility and enhance 
the activity of those catalysts as well as the decoration with magnetic nanoparticles.
3.5.2 Heck reactions
The Heck reaction is one of the most powerful and diffused approaches to couple alkenes with 
organic moieties containing a halide, a triflate, or a diazonium functionality as shown in the Figure 7. 
The first example of palladium supported on to carbon applied in a Heck reaction was the 
pioneering study by Julia and co-workers (Julia et al. 1973) in 1973. Authors performed a reaction 
between styrene and aromatic halides with yields that reached 62%. Köhler et al. (Köhler et al. 2002) 
reported a detailed investigation on all parameters that affect the Heck mechanism, showing the 
simultaneous effect of the palladium dispersion, oxidation and the conditions of catalyst preparation 
(impregnation method or pretreatment conditions).
GO was used by Wang and co-workers (Wang et al. 2015b) for palladium nanoparticles’ 
synthesis by reduction of a palladium salt precursor showing good catalytic activity, with neglectable 
metal leaching and high recyclability. Also, palladium complexes could be anchored to graphene 
for the Heck reaction between styrene or n-butyl acrylate with plenty of substituted aryl bromides 
as reported by Fernández-García et al. (Fernández-García et al. 2016). Several authors enhanced the 
activity of Heck’s catalysts by a further modification of GO such as polymer grafting (Kozur et al. 
2019). Also, for Heck’s catalyst, the combination with ferrites represents a good tool to increment 
the recyclability as proved by the study of Elazab et al. (Elazab et al. 2015). Authors used ferrite 
Figure 7. Reaction pathway of Heck reaction.Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 325
particles of around 16 nm for tailoring a palladium supported onto GO catalysts showing remarkable 
catalytic activity and recoverability. Similar results were obtained by using a magnetic catalyst in a 
eutectic solvent by Niakan et al. (Niakan et al. 2021).
A relevant study was reported by Janowska and co-workers (Janowska et al. 2011) that 
supported palladium nanoparticles on vertically aligned MWCNTs for Heck reactions induced 
by microwaves heating. The microwave irradiation combined with high loss factor of MWCTNs 
boosted the reaction kinetics without compromising recyclability and activity. Interestingly, Sun et al. 
(Sun et al. 2013) proved that defective CNTs allowed CNTs-palladium interaction, avoiding the 
increment of palladium particle size. Another factor that enhances the CNTs based catalysts activity 
during the Heck reaction is the presence of nitrogen sites. Cao et al. (Cao et al. 2020) proved 
nitrogen doped CNTs are a better support for loading active palladium particles. Also, grafting of 
peptides (Afshari et al. 2020), poly(amidoamines) (Nabid et al. 2011), poly (lactic acid) (Neelgund 
and Oki 2011) or cyclodextrin nanosponges (Sadjadi et al. 2018) could be better ways to improve 
the usability of the CNT catalysts without compromising their activity.
Another interesting approach was reported by Zhu and co-workers (Zhu et al. 2009) based on 
the use of palladium catalyst supported onto carbon nanofibers. Authors claimed a high activity and 
stability and a low leaching in multi-cycles with a palladium loading of up to 5 wt.%. 
3.5.3 Sonogashira reactions
Sonogashira reaction is a cross-coupling reaction based on the use of palladium catalyst and a copper 
co-catalyst to form a carbon–carbon bond between an aryl or vinyl halide and a terminal alkyne as 
summarized in Figure 8.
De la Rosa described the palladium supported on charcoal as catalyst for Sonogashira reaction 
in 1990 using several aryl bromide with excellent results (De La Rosa et al. 1990). Later in 2003, 
Novák et al. (Novák et al. 2003) reported the very same study but with the addition of phosphine 
ligands to improve the conversion.
Lee et al. (Lee et al. 2013) reported a comprehensive study on the palladium nanoparticles 
supported onto GO as effective catalysts for Sonogashira reactions. The catalyst was prepared 
by reduction of GO impregnated with Pd(OAc)2
 at 100ºC under hydrogen atmosphere producing 
palladium nanoparticles of 2 nm of diameter supported onto rGO. These materials showed a good 
activity related to the efficient dispersion of nanoparticles on rGO matrix. Feng and co-workers 
Figure 8. Reaction pathway of Sonogashira reaction.326 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
(Feng et al. 2014) introduced a bimetallic catalyst on graphene by adding cobalt to a more traditional 
palladium based catalyst. Authors claimed an improvement of catalytic activity for a Pd/Co ratio 
close to 1. Naimi and Kiani (Naeimi and Kiani 2019) proved the ability of cheap metals such 
as nickel to catalyse the Sonogashira reaction. Rohani et al. (Rohani et al. 2019) described an 
efficient cobalt-aluminium catalyst supported onto graphene tailored with amine groups proving 
the beneficial effect of nitrogen and sulphur doping. In the case of Sonogashira reactions, it is 
also possible to combine traditional palladium catalyst supported onto nanostructured carbon with 
ferrites to improve the recyclability (Niakan et al. 2021).
3.6 Immobilized enzyme on to nanostructured carbon supports
Immobilized enzymes are one of the cutting-edge frontiers of catalysis due to the ultra-high 
efficiency and selectivity of these materials.
Recently, graphene and graphene-like nanomaterials have been largely used as supporting 
matrices for the enzymatic arrays immobilization targeting bio-catalytic applications (Adeel 
et al. 2018). The combination of mechanical and electrochemical properties with the functional 
surface residues’ tunability has genereted a great interest (Zhang et al. 2010). Xue and co-workers 
(Xue et al. 2012) immobilized monomeric hemin on graphene. These bio catalysts showed a 
catalytic activity of up to 10 times better than that of the hemin immobilized into a hydrogel and of 
up to 100 times better than enzyme. Huang et al. (Huang et al. 2011) immobilized haemoglobin onto 
Go for catalysing a peroxidatic reaction in organic solvent benzene-1,2,3-triol. Gong et al. (Gong 
et al. 2017) further extended the combination of graphene derivatives with enzymes by developing 
a real nanoscale bioreactor using immobilizing naringinase on graphene. These nano-architectured 
reactors were able to work in flow condition for the production of isoquercitrin.
Similarly, Xie et al. (Xie et al. 2020) produced a micro reactor system immobilizing a lipase 
on 4-(1-Pyrenyl)butanoic acid functionalized monolithic nickel-CNTs foam improving enzyme 
efficiency and long-term catalyst stability. Choi and co-workers (Choi et al. 2015) used the same 
approach to develop an enzyme modified electrode based on CNTs/Nafion composites for biofuel 
cell purposes.
3.7 Nanocarbon supported catalysts for electrochemical oxidation 
Nanostructured carbon materials are not the best choice as support for wet oxidation due to the 
reactivity of the carbon matrix but they achieved unreachable results during the electrooxidation 
process. This was mainly due to the high conductivity of carbon supports that actively play a major 
role during electrochemical reactions.
In the field of electrochemical oxidation process, there are two main sub-field represented 
by environmental remediation through organic pollutants degradation and energy storage through 
fuel cells technologies. In the next subsections, we are summarizing both of them with the most 
remarkable achievements reported in the scientific literature.
3.7.1 Electrochemical oxidation: Environmental remediation through organic 
pollutants degradation
Electrochemical oxidation of organic pollutants is a degradative process occurring to organic matter 
in watery media. This process is due to the in situ electro-generated oxygen radicals, as shown in 
Figure 9, acting as strong oxidant agents for organic substrates.
During the electrooxidation process, metallic active sites are converted into hydroxylic radical 
species. These last ones are highly unstable and very reactive leading to degradation of organic Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 327
matters into carbon dioxide with the formation of metal oxides. Metal oxide can further react with 
organic matter promoting its partial oxidation.
The more relevant drawback of electrooxidation is the great energy demand (Anglada et al. 
2009), but it is compensated by the wide range of applications including sanification of wastewater 
from chemical (Canizares et al. 2006, Han et al. 2008, Cho et al. 2008, El-Ashtoukhy et al. 2009, 
Rajkumar and Palanivelu 2004), use in textile (Vlyssides et al. 2000, Chennah et al. 2019) and food 
(Werkneh et al. 2019, Piya-Areetham et al. 2006) industry, together with the treatment of urban 
wastewater streams (Rodrigo et al. 2010). 
Actually, electrooxidation is performed using expensive metal doped electrodes containing 
platinum, palladium, iridium or rhodium (Comninellis et al. 2008). This is due to the electrochemical 
potential required for oxygen evolution (around 1.7 V) together with the great stability (i.e., resistance 
to corrosion, formation of passivation layers) and the high electrical conductivity required. 
Graphene is a perfect case of study for this aim and it has been widely tested. Zhang and 
co-workers (Zhang et al. 2018) produced a platinum tailored graphene electrode to remove 
acetaminophene. Similarly, Song et al. (Song et al. 2017) degraded chlorophenol by doped graphene 
with palladium while Duan et al. (Duan et al. 2017) used lead oxide.
CNTs were used by Jian et al. (Jiang et al. 2014) combined with iron and titanium to degrade 
nitrophenol with high efficiency. Similar bimetallic doped CNTs electrodes were used by Ferreira 
et al. (Ferreira et al. 2015) for the degradation of aniline and by Duan and co-workers (Duan et al. 
2020) for degradation of emerging pharmaceutical pollutants.
On large scale applications, ACs have plenty of use in purification of wastewater through 
the electrooxidation process as reported by many authors (Duan et al. 2015, Martínez-Huitle and 
Panizza 2018, Garcia et al. 2017).
3.7.2 Electrochemical oxidation: Energy storage 
A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell able to produce electrical energy by oxidation of a fuel by an 
oxidizing agent such as oxygen or air into electricity through a pair of redox reactions. Initially fuel 
cells required hydrogen as fuel and this represented a huge limitation to their spread. During the past 
Figure 9. Schematic reaction pathway occurring during electrooxidation of organic (R) pollutants.328 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
decades, plenty of different feedstocks were implemented ranging from alcohols (i.e., methanol, 
ethanol, glycols) to formic acid trying to circumvent the necessity for hydrogen. The use of these 
unconventional alimentations has pushed for the production of highly efficient anodic materials.
Methanol direct fuel cells have gained a great attention due to the possibility of methanol 
production from renewable feedstock. Anyhow, its use required the development of well-architectured 
anodes. Graphene was efficiently used to create anodic materials by supporting bimetallic catalysts 
based on silver/palladium (Ghiabi et al. 2018), ruthenium/palladium (Awasthi and Singh 2013), 
gold/palladium (Luo et al. 2020b) and platinum/palladium nanostructures (Arukula et al. 2019, 
Li et al. 2014b, 2014).
Liu and co-workers (Liu et al. 2015b) proved that palladium itself could be used to decorate 
graphene aerogels and applied them in direct methanol fuel cells. A further improvement can be 
achieved by doping the graphene with nitrogen atoms. As enlightened by Fang et al. (Fang et al. 
2020) for rGO and by Ren et al. (Ren et al. 2020) for neat graphene, nitrogen doping prevents 
metals clusters agglomeration avoiding the deterioration of their electrocatalytic performances. 
Additionally, Zhu et al. (Zhu et al. 2017) proved that cheaper metals such as nickel could work as 
replacement of palladium with comparable performances.
Ethanol fuel cells are also based on the palladium catalysts as reported by Kabir et al. 
(Kabir et al. 2016). Authors assembled a 3-D graphene structure loaded with 30 wt.% of palladium 
reaching a peak current density of 1568 Ag that outperformed commercial palladium and 
platinum clusters supported onto AC. Hydrogenated graphene was used by Xiao and co-workers 
(Xiao et al. 2019) in alkaline media and outperformed the analogue graphene material. Similar to 
methanol direct fuel cells, nitrogen doping enhances the performances as enlightened by Wang 
and co-workers (Wang et al. 2020). Multimetallic catalysts containing palladium and silver 
(Douk et al. 2019), gold (Karuppasamy et al. 2018), platinum/nickel (Ma et al. 2015), cobalt 
(Rostami et al. 2015), iron (Wei et al. 2018) and lead (Wu et al. 2015) could also work quite well. 
Surprisingly, nickel nanoparticles supported onto graphene showed a total operation time of up 
104 days (Wu et al. 2021) that was quite higher than previously reported research.
Similar to methanol and ethanol direct fuel cells, formic acid direct fuels cells can be implemented 
by using nanostructured palladium supported graphene (Chen et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2014) and 
graphene mixed with cheaper carbon support such as carbon black (Lv et al. 2017). Formic acid 
fuel cells were implemented by using CNTs anodes decorated with cobalt/silver/palladium clusters 
(Er et al. 2020), antimony (Qu et al. 2014a) or indium tin oxide nanoparticles (Qu et al. 2014b).
Ethylene glycol can also feed fuel cells as reported by Kannan and co-workers (Kannan et al. 
2015). Authors decorated graphene with palladium nanoparticles and manganese oxides reaching an 
anodic peak current density of 3.8 mA/cm2
. Li et al. (Li et al. 2019a) doped graphene with nitrogen 
and tailored it with palladium/silver nanoparticles reaching a current density of 4208.7mA/mg.
4. Conclusions and future perspectives
As reported in this chapter, nanostructured carbons have played a crucial role in the production of 
heterogeneous catalysts for all industrially relevant processes.
The features of nano and nanostructured species are a cutting-edge resource for the realization 
of new high performance materials that can open the way to innovative and game-changing 
approaches. Nonetheless, carbon black and AC are a cheaper solution and they are generally 
preferred for industrial applications. A relevant exception is represented by the electrooxidation 
process where the performances of graphene and CNTs cannot be reached otherwise.
Balancing performances and affordability of catalysts still remain the starting point of all 
decisional processes and carbon-based species are struggling against zeolites and silica supported 
catalysts. We firmly believe the high tunability of nanocarbons represents the real advantage together Overview of Nanostructured Carbon-based Catalysts: Recent Advances and Perspectives 329
with their electrical properties. Those two factors are the reasons for nanocarbon competitiveness 
leading to their bright future.

Graphene on Sapphire

1. Introduction
Graphene is a 2D material extracted foremost in 2004 from a mass of crystalline graphite by 
mechanical exfoliation by two scientists working at the University of Manchester, Geim and 
Novoselov (Novoselov et al. 2004). Graphene is the 1st man-made 2D material and is well known 
for its limitless property. The story of the discovery of graphene is very interesting. Every Friday 
after dinner, the group of Geim and Novoselov used to work on different projects. One Friday night 
they were exfoliating graphite with the help of scotch tape, sticking the flakes on a cleaned silicon 
dioxide (SiO2
), and looking at the microscope. Sometimes, to achieve a result, your luck should favor 
you and you need to be lucky. Fortunately, they used 300 nm SiO2
/Si to place the exfoliated flakes. 
Due to this thickness, the contrast of graphene is very visible at the microscope and it is easy to 
distinguish the thickness of graphene (Novoselov et al. 2004). The increased attention on Graphene 
by the community is ascribed to its peculiar features: loftier physical-mechanical properties, 
both in strength and flexibility, elevated electron mobility, thermal conductivity and surface area, 
impermeability to gases (even the He atom), and transparency (Banszerus et al. 2015, Bao and Loh 
2012, Castro Neto et al. 2009, Lee et al. 2008a). This interest has given rise to new production 
methods, including chemical-based approaches and large-scale techniques, whose choice depends 
on the required properties and applications (Bonaccorso et al. 2012).
2. Graphene growth
Since its first isolation in 2004, a great effort has been made by the scientific community to 
produce graphene with different methods, whose choice depends on the applications, ranging from 
micromechanical exfoliation, to chemical-based approaches, to annealing of silicon carbide (SiC)

at high temperature and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metals (Cu, Ni, Pt, and Au), silicon 
or sapphire (Figure 1).
Micromechanical exfoliation involves the use of repeated peeling of graphite flakes using sticky 
tape (Figure 1(a)) (Novoselov et al. 2004). The weak interplanar interactions allow for the isolation 
of monolayer graphene, transferred to another substrate by simply pressing the tape onto it. This 
exfoliated graphene presents perfect crystallinity and low density of defects and is usually preferred 
for fundamental studies. However, the limited size of the exfoliated flakes makes them unsuited for 
large-scale production and applications. 
In liquid-phase exfoliated (LPE) graphene, the exfoliation process is scaled up. The graphite 
is dispersed in a solvent, exfoliated using ultrasound and ultracentrifugation to remove the un￾exfoliated flakes (Figure 1(b)) (Bonaccorso et al. 2012). The principle of LPE can also be used not 
only to exfoliate pristine graphite but also for the exfoliation of graphite interpolated compounds 
and graphite oxide (GO). The GO can be reduced using thermal or chemical treatments. However, 
these graphene-like structures have both sp2
 and sp3
 hybridized carbon atoms, resulting in degraded 
quality and purity, modified electronic structure and physical properties, and are usually preferred 
in the production of conducting films and composites (Park and Ruoff 2009).
The two main fabrication methods for large-scale (up to 8-inch) production of high-grade 
monolayer graphene are the CVD technique on transition metals like copper (Cu) (Figure 1(d)) 
(Li et al. 2009, Miseikis et al. 2015, Yu et al. 2008) and thermal decomposition of SiC (Figure 1(c)) 
(First et al. 2010, Starke et al. 2012). Cu is usually preferred to grow single-layer graphene. Thanks 
to the reduced solubleness of carbon in copper, graphene growth is self-limited and ceases as soon as 
a homogeneous graphene layer covers the copper surface (Li et al. 2009). One of the shortcomings 
of this technique is that graphene needs to be transferred, since most applications require graphene

on an insulating substrate. This limitation can be overcome by using graphene grown via thermal 
decomposition of SiC (Emtsev et al. 2009) or CVD growth on silicon or sapphire (Mishra et al. 
2019, Song et al. 2012, Su et al. 2011). The CVD approach is a surface-catalyzed method that 
exploits transition metals to synthesize both single-crystal and polycrystalline graphene, which are 
subsequently transferred to arbitrary substrates. Nickel is usually preferred to synthesize multilayer 
graphene. Due to the significant carbon solubility, carbon diffuses into the nickel and segregates 
forming a non-homogeneous multilayer graphene film (Yu et al. 2008), differently from copper 
where the low carbon solubility makes the growth process self-limiting, resulting in a homogeneous 
single-layer film (Deng et al. 2019, Li et al. 2009, Miseikis et al. 2015). The CVD technique is one 
of the most used scalable approaches to grow graphene. Indeed, controlling the H2
 and CH4
 gas 
mixture and the growth parameters, one can control both the nucleation density and graphene crystal 
dimension. Moreover, just a short time ago it has been shown that graphene crystal location can be 
controlled by using chromium-based nucleation seeds to create a pattern on the copper substrates 
(Miseikis et al. 2017a) or polymers (Song et al. 2016), facilitating the use of CVD graphene in 
wafer-chip manufacturing. However, a downside of the CVD approach is the transfer of graphene 
from metals to insulating substrates, which may induce contaminations, unintentional doping, and 
mechanical stress to the graphene film, that negatively affects its physical integrity and electrical 
performance (Bonaccorso et al. 2012, Lupina et al. 2015). The classic transfer method from copper 
involves the spinning of a polymer on graphene/copper foil, to help the manipulation of the thin 
graphene membrane after the chemical etching of the metal substrate (Miseikis et al. 2017b). 
Generally, copper is etched using a copper etchant solution like iron chloride (FeCl3
), ammonium 
persulphate (APS), or other commercial copper etchants. APS is usually preferred to have clean 
and polymer-free graphene surfaces (De Fazio et al. 2019). Figure 2 exhibits a schematic of the 
transfer process of graphene from copper (G/Cu) on the desired substrate. A layer of polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA) is spin-coated on the G/Cu foil. The Cu foil is then etched using a copper 
etchant solution, leaving the floating PMMA/G. The membrane is rinsed many times in deionized 
(DI) water to reduce the amount of contaminants of the etchant. The PMMA/G layer is then placed 
onto the target substrate and let dry. Subsequently, the substrate is kept in acetone for more than 
2 hrs to remove the PMMA, rinsed for few minutes in isopropanol (IPA), and dried with nitrogen.
A cleaner transfer can be obtained using bubbling transfer (Gao et al. 2012) or semi-dry 
transfer (Miseikis et al. 2017b), but these methods have limitations when a continuous graphene

film is needed since they can prompt the formation of holes in graphene. In addition, the level of the 
metallic contaminants in transferred graphene is typically not satisfactory for industrial-scale back￾end-of-line (BEOL) integration (Lupina et al. 2015). 
To overcome the limitation of CVD graphene on metals, hard work has been done to develop a 
transfer-free synthesis of graphene directly on insulating supports. The use of epitaxial graphene on 
SiC is one the most known method (Berger et al. 2004, Emtsev et al. 2008). However, the enormous 
cost of both the SiC wafer and the growth process have encouraged the research community to find 
alternative ways to obtain metal-free graphene on insulating substrates that can be integrated with 
mature device-processing technology, such as graphene growth on sapphire (Fanton et al. 2011, Mishra 
et al. 2019). 
3. Graphene characterization
Graphene is typically characterized with standard surface techniques like atomic force microscopy 
(AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as Raman spectroscopy, to understand its 
fundamental properties. AFM and SEM are usually used to investigate the large-scale topography, 
while Raman spectroscopy enables researchers to assess graphene crystallinity and its electronic 
behavior in a non-invasive way.
Atomic force microscopy
AFM is a scanning probe technique used for morphological characterization, force measurement, and 
sample manipulation with atomic resolution. The standard operation is to scan a flexible cantilever 
integrated with a needle-pointed tip over the sample. A laser beam is centered on the cantilever and 
is reflected onto a photodetector. During the scanning, the synergy between the cantilever and the 
sample forces the cantilever to bend, and a photodiode detects the laser beam deflection. Typically, 
the AFM is operated in three modes that diverge from each other by the prick and sample synergy 
forces: non-contact mode (attractive force), contact mode (repulsive force), and tapping mode (the 
cantilever oscillates around its resonant frequency lightly tapping at the surface). AFM is usually 
employed to analyze topographic features of the surface with a nanometric resolution. In addition 
to topography, the sample’s material properties and frictional forces can be detected by phase signal 
and lateral force signal analysis, respectively. Lateral force microscopy has been used for spatially 
mapping the frictional properties of partially graphitized SiC(0001), providing high frictional 
contrast between the buffer layer and monolayer graphene (Kellar et al. 2010). Moreover, AFM 
phase sensitivity to material changes allows one to distinguish the numbers of graphene layers from 
the contrast change (Kruskopf et al. 2015, Tamayo and García 2002).
Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic method typically utilized to measure vibrational states related 
to interaction and symmetry in the molecules, by measuring the inelastic scattering of light. Each 
band in a Raman spectrum derives from a molecular or lattice vibration, giving information about the 
material’s molecular structure, crystallinity, and residual stress. Raman spectroscopy is prevalently 
used to assess graphene thickness, strain, and doping (Ferrari et al. 2006). The characteristic 
graphene Raman spectrum has two main peaks or bands associated with phonon vibrational 
modes: the graphitic G band (~ 1580 cm–1), originated from a first-order Raman scattering, and the 
2D band (~ 2700 cm–1), associated with a double resonance electron-phonon inelastic scattering 
process. When the process involves a phonon and a defect, there is also the D band (~ 1350 cm–1) 
(Ferrari 2007, Malard et al. 2009). Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 343
The position and profile of the 2D band and the ratio between I(2D) over I(G) give an indication 
of the graphene thickness. In particular, a sharp and symmetric 2D band, fitted with a single 
Lorentzian curve with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) lower than 30 cm–1 is characteristic 
of monolayer graphene (ML). In bilayer and trilayer graphene, the 2D band is wider and the fitting 
requires multiple Lorentzian curves. Moreover, the 2D band energy increases significantly with 
increasing layer number (Lee et al. 2008b). In monolayer graphene, the 2D peak is two times more 
intense than the G band. Furthermore, the G to 2D band intensity ratio increases with the number 
of graphene layers (Das et al. 2008a, Hao et al. 2010), even if considering the ratio alone is not 
sufficient because it depends also on graphene doping (Das et al. 2008b).
A shift in the G and 2D bands can also be associated with doping, strain, or their combination 
(Das et al. 2008b, Lee et al. 2012, Neumann et al. 2015). The energy of the 2D band increases with 
p-type doping and decreases with n-type doping, with respect to the case of pure undoped or neutral 
graphene. The G-band of graphene shifts towards higher wavenumbers for both n and p-type doping 
(Casiraghi et al. 2007, Das et al. 2008a). 
In graphene on SiC, the G and D bands are difficult to identify due to the surrounding Raman 
bands from the SiC substrate between 1000 and 2000 cm–1. On the contrary, the 2D band is well 
visible around ~ 2700–2750 cm–1 since it is isolated from the SiC peaks. The substrate contribution 
is usually removed by subtracting a SiC reference spectrum, making both the G and D bands visible 
(Röhrl et al. 2008), as depicted in Figure 3. 
When compared to micro mechanically cleaved graphene, the 2D band FWHM of graphene 
on SiC is typically broader and both G and 2D Raman bands are strongly blue-shifted (G band of 
~ 10 cm–1, 2D band ~ 39 cm–1), due to the compressive strain triggered by the different thermal 
expansion coefficient of SiC substrate and graphene (Lee et al. 2008b, Wang et al. 2008). Differently 
from the 2D band, the G peak position and width are not influenced by the graphene thickness 
(Lee et al. 2008b). 
Scanning electron microscopy
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is an instrument that exercises a focused high-energy 
electron beam to probe a target surface. The interaction between the beam and the sample generates 
Figure 3. Raman spectra of SiC (bottom), graphene on SiC (middle), and graphene on SiC after background subtraction 
(top). (Original).344 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
electrons (e.g., either excited from the atoms of the sample or backscattered) that are used to analyze 
the chemical composition and morphology of wide areas with a resolution of tens of nanometers. 
Indeed, secondary electrons and backscattered electrons, generated respectively by inelastic and 
elastic scattering interactions with the incident electron beam, are typically detected. In our case, to 
see the graphene on SiC and sapphire, we used the Inlens signal, 5eV, and 97 pA of current. 
4. Epitaxial growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC)
Epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC is achieved by thermal decomposition of SiC wafers at elevated 
temperature (1300–1800ºC) in ultra-high vacuum or under high pressure of Argon (800 sccm). This 
treatment leads to silicon (Si atoms) sublimation from the surface and the rearrangement of carbon 
atoms behind forming the graphene layers (First et al. 2010). Graphene can thus be grown directly 
on a commercially available semiconducting (SC) or semi-insulating (SI) substrate, obviating the 
need to transfer it to another substrate. Among its crystalline forms, the most used ones are the cubic 
3C, the hexagonal 4H, and 6H polytypes. In the polytype name, the letter C or H indicates the cubic 
or hexagonal symmetry, while the numbers 3, 4, or 6 represent how many SiC bilayers are present 
within one stacking unit. The most used polytypes are the 4H- and 6H-SiC because they have an 
ideal crystallographic symmetry to grow graphene (Figure 4). By cutting a hexagonal SiC crystal 
along a plane perpendicular to the c-axis, two surfaces are formed, one terminated by Si atoms, 
known as (0001) or the Si-face, and the other terminated with C atoms, known as SiC(0001–
) or the 
C-face (Figure 4(c)). Graphene can be synthesized both on the Si-face and the C-face surfaces of the 
SiC crystal showing different graphitization behavior (First et al. 2010).
Indeed, thermal decomposition of SiC crystal is not a self-restrictive process that generates 
a reduced graphene thickness uniformity. Especially on the C-terminated surface where there is 
a poor thickness control in the growth process, rotationally disordered multilayer graphene films 
are produced (Emtsev et al. 2009). Prior to growth, both polarity surfaces are hydrogen etched 
(H-etched) to form wide, highly uniform, atomically flat terraces (Ramachandran et al. 1998).

three different SiC polytypes: cubic 3C-SiC, with an ABC stacking sequence, hexagonal 4H-SiC, with ABCB stacking, and 
hexagonal 6H-SiC, with ABC ACB stacking. One bilayer of Si and C has a ‘c’ dimension of 0.252 nm, which means that 
4H-SiC has a unit cell of 1 nm and 6H-SiC of 1.5 nm. Adapted from (Forti 2014).Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 345
5. Hydrogen etching
The crystalline quality of graphene grown on SiC is strongly dependent on the quality of the SiC 
surface. As-received optically polished wafers have many residual polishing scratches (Figure 5(a)). 
The crystalline defects can be eliminated by etching the SiC in hydrogen. The process consists 
of annealing the substrate under a flow of molecular hydrogen and can be performed at both 
atmospheric and low pressure (Bianco et al. 2015a, Convertino et al. 2016, Frewin et al. 2009). 
The high temperature causes silicon atom sublimation, exposing the underlying carbon atoms that 
react with the hydrogen atoms forming hydrocarbons that leave the surface. The process continues 
until several hundred nanometers of SiC are removed, obtaining large atomically flat surfaces, thus 
improving the surface morphology (Ramachandran et al. 1998). Due to the unintentional miscut 
of the surface even for on-axis substrates, the etching process produces regular step structures 
(i.e., reveals the atomic steps of the SiC surface with unit-cell height), as shown in Figure 5(b). 
These atomically planar surfaces are used to synthesize high crystalline graphene (Starke et al. 
2012).

damage and deep scratches. (b) Hydrogen etched Si-face surface with atomically flat micrometric terraces separated by

6. Graphene obtained via thermal decomposition of SiC
As mentioned above, graphene grows differently on the two basal planes of the SiC polytypes with 
the hexagonal crystal structure (First et al. 2010). The graphitization process on the Si-face produces 346 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
a boundary between the initial graphene layer (monolayer graphene on SiC) and the underlying SiC. 
This interface layer is named the zero layer or buffer layer, and 30% of its C atoms are covalently 
bound to the Si atoms of the top SiC layer, with a periodicity of (6√3–
 x 6√3–
)R30º. Graphene on 
the Si-face grows via step-edge nucleation, due to increased Si desorption at the terrace step edges 
(Hupalo et al. 2009). Following Si sublimation, the buffer layer is released from SiC as new graphene 
and another buffer layer is formed. Thus, each graphene layer maintains the 30º rotation relative to 
the substrate imprinted by the buffer layer (Emtsev et al. 2008). Moreover, its influence on the 
above graphene layers strongly affects their electronic properties, reducing graphene mobility and 
inducing an intrinsic electron doping (n ≈ 1013 cm–2) (Emtsev et al. 2009). 
While on SiC(0001) it is possible to grow homogeneous mono and few-layer graphene, on 
the SiC(0001–
) monolayer growth of epitaxial graphene is difficult to achieve, since the thermal 
decomposition takes place quite fast and in an uncontrolled way (First et al. 2010). Moreover, 
since there is no interface layer, the obtained graphene layers are electronically decoupled and do 
not have an azimuthal orientation (i.e., turbostratic graphene) so that each layer is isolated, much 
less sensitive to SiC surface defects. For these reasons, on C-face graphene carrier mobilities are 
typically higher than on Si-face (Strupinski et al. 2011). 
Graphene on the C-face of SiC
Knowing the difficulties to control the graphene layers that are formed on the C-face via conventional 
thermal decomposition growth, numerous strategies have been used to improve the control over 
the growth rate to reduce the silicon sublimation rate (Camara et al. 2009, Strupinski et al. 2011). 
Recently, a tailored CVD approach has been developed to improve the graphene surface morphology 
and the layer thickness uniformity (Convertino et al. 2016). The structural, chemical and electronic 
properties of C-face graphene obtained by using this CVD approach have been also compared with 
the conventional thermal decomposition growth.
Multilayer graphene was synthesized on an H-etched C-face SiC wafer via both thermal 
decomposition and CVD in a resistively-heated cold-wall reactor (HT-BM Aixtron reactor) 
(Convertino et al. 2016). Thermal decomposition was obtained by heating the samples in argon at 
1350ºC and 780 mbar for 15 minutes (Candini et al. 2015, 2017, Emtsev et al. 2008, Haghighian 
et al. 2018, Meng et al. 2016). CVD growth was obtained using methane (CH4
) as a carbon precursor. 
The wafer was heated at about 1350ºC within a mixture of 50% of argon and 50% hydrogen held at 
780 mbar, to improve the consistency of the layer thickness and reduce the defects, while flowing 
the carbon precursor (3 sccm of CH4
) for 5 minutes.
AFM analysis of the obtained graphene revealed a relative inhomogeneous surface morphology 
similar to previous investigations (de Heer et al. 2011, Prakash et al. 2010). As shown in 
Figure 6(a), ridges of few nanometers were observed. Such features are characteristic of C-face 
graphene and are ascribed to the distinct expansion coefficients of graphene and SiC and to weaker 
graphene-substrate coupling (de Heer et al. 2011). Moreover, the surface-displayed step bunching of 
tens of nanometers as shown in a typical AFM image in panel (a). Adjacent micrometric domains of 
different heights were also made evident by the distinct contrast in the SEM images (panel (b)) and 
were found to be similar to those in previous works (Johansson et al. 2011, Razado-Colambo et al. 
2015). These results confirm that the growth process on C-face is quick and difficult to control. 
Indeed, the low surface energy of the C-face, and the absence of an enclosure (Razado-Colambo 
et al. 2015), probably contributed to produce this canyon-like morphology.
Different from the thermal decomposition graphene, in the CVD-grown samples, the nanometric 
height of the steps was well-preserved, as reported in Figure 6(c). Locally, one could observe 
domain inclusions with an augmented roughness (even though still within the nanometric range) 
(darker areas in SEM micrograph in Figure 6(d)). These inclusions probably arise by an incomplete Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 347
growth causing the development of submicrometric single-crystal domains, and might potentially 
be improved by increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen during growth. 
The measure of the attenuation of a characteristic SiC Raman peak (~ 1516 cm–1) was utilized 
to evaluate graphene thickness. This peak is an overtone of the L point optical phonon and presents 
a reduced intensity after graphene growth (Shivaraman et al. 2009). This method was employed 
to map graphene thickness over the thermal decomposition sample and CVD sample. As expected 
from the morphological analysis, despite the good crystallinity and the lack of the disorder-induced 
D band, in these samples the thickness varies between a few and about twenty layers. For the CVD￾grown samples, the attenuation of the SiC Raman signal reveals a more homogeneous thickness 
distribution, between 3 and 7 layers (Convertino et al. 2016). 
The CVD method can be adapted to grow multilayer graphene (up to 90) with good crystallinity, 
which was exploited to investigate the absorption in the THz range (Bianco et al. 2015b, Zanotto et 
al. 2017) and to realize innovative graphene mode-locked THz lasers (Bianco et al. 2015b).
Graphene on the Si-face of SiC
The thermal decomposition growth on the Si-face of SiC could be obtained by heating Si-face SiC 
in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) or under Ar atmospheric pressure (First et al. 2010, Hibino et al. 2008, 
Starke et al. 2012). Different from UHV-grown graphene that was notoriously obtained in small

domains of few hundreds of nanometers, Ar-grown graphene presented much larger domain sizes of 
several tens of microns, thanks to more controlled silicon sublimation (Emtsev et al. 2009).
By changing the temperature and time, it is possible to obtain mono, bi, and few-layer graphene 
in a controlled way. The buffer layer is usually grown at lower temperatures, ranging from 1200ºC 
to 1250ºC and a pressure of 780 mbar for 5–10 min. Monolayer graphene is obtained by raising the 
temperature to 1300–1330ºC (Bianco et al. 2015a, Chen et al. 2016, Convertino et al. 2018, Mashoff 
et al. 2015). 
Figure 7 shows a representative epitaxial graphene sample. The graphene substrate was 
characterized by AFM (Figure 7(a,b)) and SEM (Figure 7(c)) that showed the characteristic atomic 
terraces and steps of the graphitized SiC surface with graphene with different thicknesses inside 
the terraces. Raman spectroscopy was then used to assess the distribution of the number of layers. 
The AFM micrograph correlates with the spatial distribution of the FWHM of the 2D Raman band 
(Figure 7(d, top)), and the ratio of 2D and G band intensities (Figure 7(d, bottom)), revealing the 
monolayer character of the graphene on the terraces. Bilayer inclusions were typically located at the 
terrace edges (Bianco et al. 2015a, Coletti et al. 2010).Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 349
Hydrogen intercalation
Epitaxial graphene on Si-face suffers from the strong interaction with the buffer layer that induces 
n-doping of graphene (Starke et al. 2012). The intrinsic negative charge can be compensated via 
transfer doping, by molecular functionalization of graphene surface with electronegative molecules 
(Coletti et al. 2010). As an alternative, the undesired effect of the interface layer can be repressed 
by removing the covalent bonds using hydrogen intercalation, to obtain floating graphene layers 
on SiC (Riedl et al. 2009). The technique of hydrogen intercalation produces quasi-free standing 
epitaxial graphene by annealing a buffer layer under molecular hydrogen to break the covalent 
bonds between carbon and silicon atoms and saturate the Si atoms. Thus, the buffer layer 
(Figure 8(a)) is released from SiC and turns into quasi-free standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) 
(Figure 8(c)), while monolayer graphene (Figure 8(b)) turns into a decoupled bilayer (Figure 8(d)) 
(Riedl et al. 2009). 
The process is typically carried out by exposing the grown buffer layer samples to molecular 
hydrogen at 780 mbar and temperature ranging from 600ºC to 1000ºC, typically for 10 minutes 
(Convertino et al. 2018, Kang et al. 2016).

7. Wafer-scale synthesis of graphene on sapphire 
Direct growth of graphene on insulator
Lots of hard work has been made to synthesize graphene directly on SiO2
/Si (Su et al. 2011) and 
glass substrate (Chen et al. 2019), but usually, graphene was nano-crystalline. Ismach et al. has 
grown graphene on a thin copper film (100–450 nm) pre-deposited on different insulators, like 350 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
quartz, SiO2
, and fused silica (Ismach et al. 2010). However, at high temperatures, the copper 
melts, and the surface is not archetyped for continuous graphene, desirable in CMOS application. 
Shin et al. synthesized graphene unswervingly on an insulator by vertical dispersal of carbon 
precursors through the interface between the two grains of copper, to the substrate in contact with 
the catalyst copper film (Shin et al. 2018). However, this method requires wet etching for copper 
removal. 
For the enlargement of graphene device technology, the direct growth of graphene on an 
insulator with a metal-catalyst-free method is still desirable. Wafer-scale metal-catalyst-free growth 
of graphene has been obtained at low temperatures (< 1000ºC) (Song et al. 2012). However, graphene 
quality was reduced, compared to the one synthesized using a metal catalyst. Fanton et al. showed 
good quality graphene on sapphire, growth with a catalyst-free approach, with mobility at room 
temperature around 3000 cm2
/Vs (Fanton et al. 2011). However, a significant disadvantage of this 
method is the high synthesis temperature above 1500ºC that is not compatible with the conventional 
device processes. Hwang et al. showed van der Waals epitaxy synthesis of graphene directly on 
the sapphire substrate, with good quality and mobility around 2000 cm2
/V.s. However, the growth 
temperature was still high (above 1600ºC) (Hwang et al. 2013). Recently, Kim et al. were able to 
grow millimeter-sized graphene by a novel capping technique using an overlaid Cu thin film, in 
direct contact with the substrate (Kim et al. 2018). 
Zhang et al. proposed a three-step technique to grow graphene of the copper-assisted sapphire 
substrate (Zhang et al. 2018). Copper and a carbon precursor were co-deposited on sapphire by 
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD); subsequently, the substrates were annealed to 
grow graphene from the carbon precursor. 
However, there is still a lot of space for improvement in the direct growth of graphene on 
sapphire using a metal-free, low temperature, and single-step approach. Therefore, it is important to 
investigate in more detail the growth mechanism and surface preparation and reconstruction of the 
sapphire substrate during the process. 
Recently, the growth of high-quality monolayer graphene via CVD on the c-plane of an H-etched 
Al2
O3
 (0001) substrate with a catalyst-free method in a commercial CVD reactor (HT-BM, Aixtron) 
has been demonstrated (Mishra et al. 2019). The growth temperature of 1200ºC was much lower 
compared to what was used in previous works (Hwang et al. 2013). 
In this part, we will discuss the reconstruction of the sapphire substrate to grow homogenous 
and high-quality graphene. The structural and chemical properties of graphene were assessed 
by Raman spectroscopy, AFM, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and scanning-tunneling 
microscopy (STM). The graphene on the sapphire growth process was successfully scaled up from 
batch scale to wafer-scale (up to 8-inch wafer), keeping the same quality and uniformity. The carrier 
mobility measured at room temperature was above 2200 cm2
/V.s. In addition, if needed, an entire 
graphene wafer can be easily transferred from sapphire to the desired substrate by a polymer￾assisted technique. The direct and metal-free CVD approach is certainly interesting thanks to its 
implementation in a commercial reactor, that can be easily scaled-up, leading to applications in

A single c-axis, single-crystal HEMCOR, and double-side polished sapphire (0001) substrate was 
used for graphene synthesis (Alfa Aesar, batch: 45020, LOT: U20E038). Before growth, sapphire 
was cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone, isopropanol, and de-ionized (DI) water. Subsequently, 
the substrate was treated with piranha solution (1:3, H2
O2
:H2
SO4
) for 15 min, cleaned in DI water, 
and finally dried with nitrogen. After the cleaning, sapphire was hydrogen etched in Aixtron high￾temperature black magic (HT-BM) cold wall CVD system for 5 min at 1180ºC in H2 (Figure 9) Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 351
(Mishra et al. 2019). Then, the substrate was annealed for 10 min at 1200ºC in Ar (1000 sccm). After 
the annealing procedure, graphene was grown in a flow of Ar, H2
, and CH4
. CH4
 was introduced 
as a carbon precursor in a mixture of Ar and H2
 (1000 sccm of Ar and 100 sccm of H2
) for 30 min, 
with a ratio of CH4
:H2 of 1:20 (Mishra et al. 2019). After the growth, the system was cooled in Ar. 
Graphene was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, AFM, LEED, and STM.
H-etching of the sapphire substrate 
As-received sapphire substrate has polishing scratches and contaminations, similar to SiC wafers 
(see Figure 5) (Mishra et al. 2016). Therefore, a hydrogen etching step was performed to remove 
the polishing scratches and produce nanometric terraces to grow graphene (Mishra et al. 2016). 
The hydrogen etching step required a temperature of 1180–1200ºC for 5 min in H2
 at 450 mbar. 
The etching step forms nice terraces and reconstruct the sapphire substrate. Terraces are typically 
2–4 nm high with an RMS value of 0.5–0.7 nm (Figure 10) (Mishra et al. 2019).

is made of graphite and can hold a substrate of a maximum of 1 cm2

Graphene characterization
Raman spectroscopy
Graphene on sapphire was characterized with a Renishaw inVia system, using a 532 nm laser and a 100 
X objective, with a spot size of ~ 1 µm (5% power) and an exposure time of 1s. The G and 2D bands 
were at 1586 cm–1 and 2689 cm–1, respectively (see Figure 11(a)) (Das et al. 2008b). The sharp 2D 
band had an FWHM of around 36 cm–1 and the I(2D)/I(G) was higher than 2 (Figure 11(b) and 11(c)), 
which indicate the presence of monolayer graphene. Moreover, the I(D)/I(G) around 0.25 indicates 
low defects (Neumann et al. 2015) (Figure 11(d)).

and D bands. Histogram of (b) 2D FWHM, (c) I(2D)/I(G) and (d) I(D)/I(G) obtained from 30 × 30 µm2

Atomic force microscopy
The topography of graphene on sapphire was analyzed by Bruker AFM. Raw data were analyzed by 
Gwyddion software. Figure 12 shows the topography of a sapphire substrate after graphene growth. 
The white lines are ridges caused by the distinct thermal expansion coefficients of graphene and 
sapphire and are 1–2 nm high (Song et al. 2012). Intense bright spots are defects formed during the 
growth at high temperatures.
Scanning electron Microscopy 
Zeiss merlin SEM was performed on graphene on sapphire to investigate its morphology. Low 
current (76 pA) and voltage (2 kV) were used to perform the imaging (Figure 13). The dark areas 
confirmed the presence of a continuous graphene film. The white thin connections are the wrinkle 
(same observed with AFM, see Figure 12) caused by the different thermal expansion coefficients Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 353
of graphene and sapphire (Garcia et al. 2012). Agglomerated white lines are defects present during 
the growth. In addition, the dark connected lines are the grain boundaries of the sapphire substrate. 
Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM)
To understand better the growth mechanism and the structural properties at the graphene/sapphire 
interface, LEED and STM analyses were performed. LEED was conducted on as received and hydrogen 
etched sapphire substrates, respectively. The as-received surface was very difficult to measure, 
due to its insulting nature, and no LEED pattern was collected. In contrast, we were able to see a 
(√31 × √31) R9º reconstruction on hydrogen etched sapphire, even at 60 eV which is a quite low voltage 
for insulating substrate (Figure 14(a,b)). This can be explained by the Al-rich surface induced by the 
H-etching treatment. Despite a reasonably long history of disagreement and discussions regarding 
its definite atomic structure (Barth and Reichling 2001, Gautier et al. 1991, Jarvis and Carter 2001, 
Lauritsen et al. 2009, Renaud et al. 1994), in 2009 Lauritsen et al. were able to convince the scientific 
community that Al-rich (111) layer is formed on the Al-terminated c-plane of the substrate (Lauritsen 
et al. 2009). At present, it is known that heating the sapphire substrate of Al2

temperature well above 1200ºC in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) (Barth and Reichling 2001, Gautier 
et al. 1991, Lauritsen et al. 2009, Renaud et al. 1994) causes a loss of surface oxygen which leads 
to surface reconstruction. Our process can encourage the (√31 × √31)R9º reconstruction at lower 
temperatures and higher pressures than those previously published (Barth and Reichling 2001, 
Gautier et al. 1991, Lauritsen et al. 2009, Renaud et al. 1994), due to the H2
-etching, i.e., oxygen 
is replaced by hydrogen. Figure 14(a) shows the LEED pattern of graphene on H2
-etched sapphire 
and, as reported in Figure 14(b), diffraction spots measured at different locations show two rotating 
areas of the (√31 × √31)R9º reconstruction (i.e., (√31 × √31)R ± 9º). Figure 14(c) reports an atomic￾scale resolved STM image of graphene over the H-etched (√31 × √31)R ± 9º reconstruction. The 
multifaceted arrangement of the underlying reassembled sapphire layer is visible as an intervallic 
arrangement of unevenly rhombus-shaped domains. In the bottommost insert of the panel (c), the 
dark line designates the spacing between the utmost to be (27 ± 1) Å, consistent with the insignificant 
length of the re-establishment of 26.5 Å. Pane (d) displays a 2-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform 
(2D FFT) filtered part of the image in panel (c) along with the basic vector of graphene (dark) and the 
reconstruction (white). The reciprocated orientation between graphene and sapphire reconstruction 
is 21º confirming that graphene aligns along the R30 direction with respect to the Al2
O3
 (0001) 
(1 × 1), as also evident from the LEED pattern in panel (a). The fundamental archetypal of the 
Al-rich reconstruction on sapphire is complicated by the changing of the lattice arrangement between 
the Al atoms in the interior of the unit cell and relies on the joint organization of the Al-rich atoms 
with respect to the substrate archive (Lauritsen et al. 2009). Despite the actual resolution of the STM 
scans preventing us from reaching a decision on the atomic prearrangement between graphene and 
the Al-rich atoms at the boundary, we were able to see that the graphene framework imitates well 
the intervallic corrugation forced by the (√31 × √31)R ± 9º. Al-rich reconstructed surface act as a 
metal catalyst and at elevated temperature, carbon decomposes easily and forms graphene. During 
growth, the Al-rich surface acts like strong Lewis acids that disassociate the methane molecules, and 
thus activate the graphene growth. 
Mobility measurements at room temperature
The room temperature transport parameters (density, mobility) of the graphene film were extracted 
through magneto-transport measurements in the magnetic field range –0.37 T to 0.37 T (Mishra 
et al. 2019). To this end, several Hall bar and Van der Pauw geometry were fabricated out of each 
chip by first depositing Cr/Au electrodes at randomly chosen areas of the chip and by defining their 
shape through an aligned dry etching process, as shown in Figure 15(a) for a representative Hall 
bar device (Mishra et al. 2019). The light area in the optical image is the etch mask region used

insert in panel (a), revealing the Al2

et al. 2019).Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 355
to remove the graphene with oxygen plasma to avoid short circuits. Moreover, the bright area is 
contacts evaporated with Au/Cr layer. 
Electron beam lithography (EBL) was used to make hall bars. Since sapphire is an insulating 
substrate, a conductive film, easily soluble in water, was spun over the PMMA layer. A constant 
current passed between source and drain and the resistance was measured. Figure 15(b) shows the 
graph of the resistance vs applied magnetic field and carrier density measured between different 
combinations inside the channel (Figure 15(b)). The connections were checked by using the 2-probe 
resistance method. The resistance was measured by passing a perpetual current, and the voltage was 
measured between all the possible combinations (Figure 16). Figure 16 shows different hall bars 
prepared in one sample and named A0, A1, and B0. Graphene is p-doped, with hole densities and 
mobilities in the range 1.5 – 6.5 × 1012 cm–2 and 1000–2500 cm2
/vs, respectively (Figure 15(b)). 
As a general trend, we find that lower carrier densities correspond to higher hole mobility. Finally, 
we speculate that the electrical performance of our chips is most probably limited by the grain￾boundary-induced disorder. In this scenario, the higher carrier mobility of graphene of H-etched 
substrates is conceivably linked to the larger, observed graphene grain size (1 µm) (Mishra et al. 
2019).

in magnetic field ± 0.37 T. Resistance measured between S-D, TL-TR, BL-BR, and TL-BL, whereas mobility is measured

Transfer of graphene grown on sapphire wafers 
To broaden the applicative range, graphene can be transferred from sapphire to a target substrate 
using the poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) lamination approach (Shivayogimath et al. 2019). For this 
purpose, Gr/sapphire was kept overnight in water, then the substrate was spun with polyvinyl 
alcohol (PVA) polymer and baked at 110ºC for 1 min (Mishra et al. 2019, Shivayogimath et al. 
2019). PVA film was used due to its high solubility in water. The weak bonding between graphene 
and sapphire (van der Waals) makes it easy to peel the graphene from the substrate with PVA film 
on top. The peeled film was placed onto the desired substrate (290 nm SiO2
/Si substrate) and heated 
for few minutes at 110ºC for better adhesion. To remove the PVA film, the sample was kept for a 
couple of hours in DI H2
O. Figure 17 shows an optical image of graphene transferred from sapphire 
and the Raman spectra before and after the graphene transfer, revealing no changes in the peaks 
position and graphene quality.

/Si (290 nm) using the PVA-assisted transfer method. (b) Raman spectra before 
and after graphene transfer.
Scalable approach
It is always a dream of every project to transfer the technology from the lab to the industry for large￾scale applications. Graphene grown in our lab got the attention of the CEO of AIXTRON Company, 
Prof. Ken Teo. AIXTRON Company is the worldwide manufacturer of CVD and MOCVD reactors. 
Tying up with AIXTRON led to the scaling up of this project, and following the optimization of the 
parameters we were able to grow from 2-inch up to 8-inch wafers in an MOCVD reactor (Mishra 
et al. 2019). In addition, AIXTRON manufactured a production scale reactor (CCS 2D MOCVD) 
for the wafer-scale growth of graphene and other 2D materials. The system is easy to use, well￾controlled in temperature, and flexible for 2D materials growth. In the CCS 2D MOCVD reactor 
(Figure 18), the susceptor is made of graphite and can be easily swapped as needed. In this reactor, 
we can easily grow 19 wafers of 2-inch, 5 wafers of 4-inch, 1 wafer of 6-inch, or 1 wafer of 8-inch, 
as can be seen from Fig. 18. Synthesis of Graphene onto Semi-insulating Substrates 357

1. Introduction
Hydrogen was discovered by scientist Henry Cavendish FRS (10th Oct 1731–24th Oct 1810) in 
1766 which he termed “flammable air”. Hydrogen is a Greek word meaning “maker of water”. 
The name Hydrogen was put forward by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783 after reproducing Cavendish’s 
experiment and realizing that it produces water on combustion. Hydrogen is the smallest known 
element having atomic number 1 and is found as three different isotopes viz. hydrogen, deuterium 
and tritium having mass number 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
A hydrogen molecule is diatomic and the atoms are bonded together by a covalent bond. The 
most abundant isotope of hydrogen atom nucleus contains one proton and one electron. The protons 
have a magnetic moment and the proton’s spin associated with it is 1/2. Therefore, the molecular 
hydrogen exists as two isomers. The molecule which has its two proton spins aligned parallel form 
a triplet state, designated as ortho-hydrogen, while the other which has its two proton spins aligned 
antiparallel form a singlet state, designated as para-hydrogen. The ratio of ortho-hydrogen and para￾hydrogen at thermal equilibrium is found to be 75 to 25. These states are identical (physically 
and chemically), but differ nominally in their specific heats and spectrograph. Interestingly, when 
hydrogen is cooled, it eventually becomes pure para-hydrogen (McCarty et al. 1981).
Hydrogen is an odourless, colourless, tasteless gas, which does not react at ambient temperature. 
At normal pressure, volume occupied by 1 g of hydrogen gas is about 11 liters. The melting point 
and boiling point of hydrogen are 14 K and 20.4 K, respectively. It is highly inflammable (at 6.2% 
concentration in air) and is sparingly soluble in water (1.93 ml of hydrogen dissolves in 100 ml of 
water at 0ºC).
Extensive research attention is being rendered towards the utilization and exploitation of 
sustainable energy sources including hydrogen energy due to excessive demand of various fossil 
fuels and destruction of environment. The researchers have been putting their efforts for designing 
and developing advanced devices for energy conversion and storage. The ever-increasing energy 
requirements has created the situation to explore various resources of sustainable energy. For 
instance, in 2018, the total electricity consumption worldwide was found to be 22315 Terawatt-hour

(TWh), which is 4.0% higher than it was in 2017. Thus, due to increase in demand, more efficient 
and reliable components are being developed to meet the growing demands. 
Due to the inherent properties of hydrogen, this gas is considered as the future fuel. This 
hydrogen energy is easily convertible into other forms like mechanical energy, and electrical energy 
with a fair amount of efficiency. In addition, greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and such other 
pollutants are not emitted in this process. Francis Bacon (1959) had developed a 5-kW fuel cell 
system and demonstrated a mixture of hydrogen and air to be a viable energy source. Water, one 
of the most important source of hydrogen, faces no the danger of getting depleted as in case of 
fossil fuels. These alternative sources should not use different fossil fuels and should be carbon 
neutral, that is, non-polluting. Hydrogen has become an interesting alternative fuel in recent times 
due to continuous increase in global energy requirement and concern for the environmental safety. 
The main roadblock towards hydrogen being used as a commercial fuel is its on-board storage in 
adequate quantity. High storage capacity of hydrogen is required when it acts as an energy carrier 
in case of high-energy density rechargeable batteries or in fuel cells. Thus, in the present scenario of 
energy requirements, hydrogen seems to be the key for clean, green, reliable and sustainable energy 
source.
2. Advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen gas as a future fuel
Abundance of hydrogen is what makes it a future fuel as it can be easily generated by different 
techniques from water (Winter and Nitsch 1988).
The energy considerations show that hydrogen is most efficient when compared with other 
available fuels. One kilogram of hydrogen contains energy equivalent to 2.1 kilogram of natural gas 
or equivalent to 2.8 kilogram of gasoline. Hydrogen energy can be converted into different forms 
of energy like mechanical energy, electrical energy among others with 50–60% high efficiencies. 
Hydrogen can be used in a fuel cell (Schlapbach and Zuettel 2001, Ogden et al. 2002).
Hydrogen gas behaves as a truly sustainable and clean fuel in an internal combustion engine 
very much like other alternative fuels.
It is imperative to consider hydrogen to be a green fuel. It is perfectly non-polluting, as the 
exhaust formed on combustion is water, whereas gasoline and oils are hazardous and highly toxic 
to plants and animals. Also, hydrogen diffuses easily in air and in case of accidental spillage, it 
evaporates rapidly. Oil and gasoline spillage calls for elaborate clean-up efforts. The measures have 
been found to be inadequate as this spilled oil and gasoline penetrates into the immediate ecosystem 
causing long term and more often irreparable damage (Phillips et al. 1972). 
Notwithstanding the high inflammability, the ability of hydrogen gas to disperse easily into the 
surrounding, in case of an accidental leakage, makes it a safer fuel. On the other hand, propane and 
gasoline have relatively high densities due to which the dispersal rate become slow, thus increasing 
the chances of explosion. Only 1% concentration of gasoline is sufficient in atmosphere to cause 
explosion while concentration of hydrogen should be about 4% to cause the same effect (Kalyanam 
et al. 1987). Thus, hydrogen is an excellent candidate for clean energy source, unlike fossil fuels.
There are definitely a few disadvantages of hydrogen to be a clean energy and significant work 
needs to be carried out to make this a viable source. The hydrogen cylinders are too heavy to be 
fitted in a vehicle. The most worrisome is that the flame of hydrogen runs back into the cylinder to 
cause an explosion. 
The volume occupied by one kilogram of hydrogen gas at NTP conditions is about 10 m3
. Hence, 
to drive a hydrogen-powered car up to 600 km, it needs at least 4 kg of hydrogen. This volume needs 
to be stored in a small space for any practical utility. Moreover, the hydrogen cylinders should be Nanostructures for Hydrogen Storage 363
so designed to be safe, compact, lasting, light in weight, and economical and in addition, should not 
contain any toxic pollutant (Das et al. 2002).
The relative energy content of hydrogen (liquid), CNG and gasoline in kWh/liter unit are 
2.36, 5.8 and 8.76, respectively. Therefore, in comparison to gasoline or natural gas, storing 
hydrogen in liquid form is not economical. These facts are relevant to determine the size of a 
hydrogen cylinder and that of a gasoline tank in addition to the explosion hazard associated 
with the hydrogen. Other properties of hydrogen gas are that it is very light in comparison to air 
(about 14 times), and has high flammability and low flash point. Hydrogen has 20.4 K as boiling 
point and 14 K as melting point (Greenwood et al. 1997). Another hurdle is that the kinetic molecular 
diameter of hydrogen is 0.289 nm, which is much lesser than 0.335–0.350 nm, the interlayer distance 
found in graphite like materials (Bacon 1951).
Hence, the necessity to find a suitable system for storing significant amount of the hydrogen gas 
in a container of small size becomes more pertinent. 
3. Various methods of hydrogen storage
3.1 Gaseous hydrogen
Different techniques of hydrogen storage in gaseous forms are discussed here:
3.1.1 Metal hydrides 
Metal hydrides (MHs) composed from different alloys functions by adsorption of hydrogen gas and 
then desorption later on under different possibilities of ambient temperature, elevated temperature 
or when the external pressure is reduced. Magnesium hydride shows up to 7.6 wt% reversible 
hydrogen storage capacity for on board applications. MHs absorb a relatively small amount of gas. 
The advantage of MHs is that hydrogen can be safely delivered at a constant pressure. The purity 
of hydrogen gas is responsible for the life of a MH container in which it is stored. Accordingly, 
as the MH container is used repeatedly, impurities get adsorbed by the MHs, possibly acting as 
poisons. This reduces the hydrogen storing capacity as well as the lifetime of the MH container 
gets compromised as the adsorbed impurities do not get desorbed. The kinetics as well as the 
reversibility being very slow limits the use of MHs as hydrogen storage facility. Also, the systems 
are heavy and expensive for regular usage. Balde et al. (2008), in their work on hydrogen storage 
by sodium aluminum hydride (NaAlH4
), proved that if MHs used are of nano size particles, then it 
reduces desorption temperature of hydrogen and also its activation energy. In addition, the reloading 
pressure is also lowered by use of smaller particle size.
Sodium borohydride (NaBH4
) is another favourable option as hydrogen storage material, as its 
adsorption capacity is 10.8 wt%. In spite of various efforts made by researchers, the Department 
of Energy, USA, denied permission to NaBH4
 to be used in automotives (Demirci et al. 2009). 
Jain et al. (2010) made efforts towards decreasing the desorption temperature and simultaneously 
increase the kinetics, and thereby cycle life of Mg based hydrides. The kinetics has been improved 
by the addition of suitable catalysts into the system and by introducing defects and surface 
modifications by ball milling. Severa et al. (2010) found specific conditions to store more than 
11 wt% hydrogen, reversibly. This was achieved by converting magnesium diboride to magnesium 
borohydride by direct hydrogenation process. Zhang et al. (2012) carried out direct synthesis of 
Mg-B-H compounds and studied its storage characteristics. A remarkable feat of 6.7 wt% reversible 
hydrogen adsorption capacity was achieved at 303 K by employing thermodynamic destabilization, 
thereby decreasing the kinetic barriers, which had never been achieved earlier (Zhang et al. 2021).364 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
3.2 Compressed hydrogen gas in high pressure tank
Hydrogen is usually stored in tanks by compression. The storage capacity of a compressed gas tank 
may be increased gravimetrically and volumetrically by two different methods. The first method 
involves cryogenic compressed tanks, which is based on Charles’s Law. At constant pressure, the 
volumetric capacity of a gas tank increases with the decrease in the tank temperature. The energy 
requirement to achieve this is very large, the volume occupied by the gas is also very large which 
reduces the energy density. The hydrogen storage tanks can be manufactured to withstand very high 
pressure to the tune of 6,000 Kgm–2 but the molecular diameter of hydrogen molecules being very 
small, these get diffused through the matrix of the metallic container at 200 Kgm–2 and above. This 
process makes the metal brittle. Accordingly, the cylinder to be mounted in the vehicle has to be a 
thick-walled cylinder. Hence, the disadvantage will be that the actual weight of the hydrogen gas will 
be much less compared to the weight of the hydrogen cylinder. Hence, the vehicle will carry more 
weight, which makes the system uneconomical. Compressed gas cylinder may be suitable where 
the container is kept stationary like a household cooking gas cylinder. Considering the shortage of 
conventional electrical power and the problems which are being faced with the load shedding of 
electrical power and having to use diesel generators, compressed hydrogen gas cylinders instead of 
diesel could be the answer.
3.3 Glass micro-sphere
Hollow glass micro-microspheres (HGMs) have diameter range of 25–500 μm while the thickness 
of the walls ranges between 1–8 μm. In HGMs, the hydrogen gas is stored by the diffusion of 
the molecules in the porous wall of the HGMs. Hydrogen gas is filled in these HGMs at definite 
pressure and at a temperature range of 473–673 K. These glass spheres are cooled to almost room 
temperature so that the hydrogen gas remains trapped inside these spheres (Morgan and Sissine 
1995). Dalai et al. (2015) has reported hydrogen storage of 3.26 wt% in HGMs at 473 K and at 
a pressure of 1MPa. Some researchers have reported 2.2 wt% in HGMs at 673K and 34.5 MPa 
(Shelby et al. 2009). These spheres show hydrogen storage capacity of about 5–6 wt% at pressure 
of 20–49 MPa (Eklund et al. 1983). The hydrogen gas from these spheres is released by heating 
or crushing them. Reuse of these spheres is uneconomical due to crushing so it is not a favourable 
option.
4. In chemicals
Different chemicals viz. methanol (CH3
OH), ammonia (NH3
), and methyl cyclohexane (CH3
C6
H11) 
(Strickland et al. 1984) containing hydrogen can also be considered for this purpose. These 
chemicals exist as liquid at NTP condition, the infrastructure used for transportation and storage of 
gasoline can also be used for these chemicals (Padro et al. 1999). Another possible candidate for 
hydrogen storage is aluminum hydride (AlH3
), having hydrogen density 10 wt% (Sandrock et al. 
2005, Graetz 2009, Graetz et al. 2011). The advantage of this method over compressed hydrogen gas 
cylinders is that in this system leak-proof systems are not required. The hydrogen storage capacity 
of such chemicals is relatively high viz. methanol 8.9 wt%, ammonia 15.1 wt%, etc. In addition, 
the containers of such chemicals should be made of composites or plastics at least, in some cases to 
decrease the dead-weight of the container.
The major drawback of this method is that it is non-reversible, that is, regeneration of the 
compounds by hydrogen is not possible. It requires the production of the compounds in a centralized 
unit and recycling of the reaction products. Another disadvantage of this method is with compounds 
like ammonia that produces environmentally toxic waste products such as nitrogen oxides. Besides, 
it additionally produces carbon monoxide gas that is further unfavourable (Strickland et al. 1984). Nanostructures for Hydrogen Storage 365
Various other compounds like lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, and hydrazine have been 
seriously investigated for their hydrogen storage capacities. 
4.1 Metal organic framework (MOF)
MOFs display unique features, viz. relatively large pore volumes associated with surface area, 
variable pore size, tailored metal selection, ligand functionalization and framework–adsorbate 
interaction. Such materials can easily replace adsorbents like activated carbon as these materials 
too exhibit comparable hydrogen adsorption at significantly low temperature; unfortunately, the 
affinity for hydrogen decreases as the temperature rises to room temperature. While metal hydrides 
have higher hydrogen adsorption property, the desorption kinetics and thermodynamics are not 
favourable (Collins et al. 2007).
The molecules of hydrogen and the walls of the MOFs suffer weak interaction between them; 
hence, the void space present in the cages of MOFs is not completely utilized. This unutilized void 
space can be optimally used by introduction of mesoporous or microporous particles like carbon 
nanomaterials into these void spaces and suitably alter the pore size, and thereby the pore volume for 
greater hydrogen adsorption (Prasanth et al. 2011). Hydrogen adsorption by such type of materials 
increased at cryogenic temperatures and also at room temperature.
In recent years, researcher groups have figured out various strategies for optimizing interaction 
of hydrogen with these materials utilizing the dangling bonds or unsaturated centers for binding of 
hydrogen. 
Monte Carlo simulations show that large hydrogen storage by MOFs is due to the physical 
characteristics, which are responsible for the strong interactions between hydrogen molecules and 
the MOF. These interactions between molecules of hydrogen and MOF are mainly due to Van der 
Waal’s forces, charge-quadrupole and induction.
Physisorption of hydrogen mainly takes place due to the polarization effects and charged 
framework having narrow pores further increases the effects. The presence of these features in MOF 
makes it an excellent candidate for hydrogen storage (Belof et al. 2007).
Li et al. (2010) developed a system in which ammonia borane (AB) was captivated in a MOF 
and was labeled as JUC-32-Y. This captivation assisted by metallic catalysis enhanced the kinetics 
of release of hydrogen gas, thus preventing ammonia formation. The AB captured in the MOF 
JUC-32-Y released the captivated hydrogen gas even at 50ºC. It can release 8.2 wt% of hydrogen in 
3 min at 95ºC and 10.2 wt% of hydrogen within 10 min at 85ºC. Wang et al. (2020) synthesized a 
microporous aluminum-based MOF labeled as BUT-22 for hydrogen storage at 296 K and 8 MPa. 
The capacity of hydrogen storage of BUT-22 was reported to be 12 wt% at 10 MPa and 77 K.
It can be thus concluded that MOFs are good materials to be used for hydrogen storage. 
5. In Carbon
Activated carbon (AC) and various other allotropes of carbon like fullerenes, graphene, CNTs, 
nano fibers having large SSA are considered to be good sorbates and adsorption takes place by 
physisorption. Naturally, this characteristic of carbon materials has been correlated with hydrogen 
storage since long. AC having SSA 3000 m2
g–1 has been synthesized (Chahine et al. 1994). Dillon 
et al. (1999a) studied various adsorption capacities of such materials while Baughman et al. 
(2002) suggested that in addition to hydrogen storage, these materials can be used in fuel cell and 
automobiles. There is also the need to understand the geometric and electronic features required for 
activation of hydrogen molecules on these surfaces.
Theoretical calculations supported by experimental works have indicated the adsorption of 
hydrogen by carbon nanomaterials to be reversible and significant. The possibilities of achieving 
target set by the Department of Energy, USA seems unlikely as these materials have low bulk density. 366 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
In spite of the existence of certain doubts, researchers have claimed varying degrees of possibilities 
of carbon allotropes being used for hydrogen storage at ambient temperature and possible use in 
automobiles and other modes of transportation. 
Contributions made by some of the researchers on hydrogen storage using various CNMs are 
as follows:
ACs being highly porous materials and large SSA (more than 3000 m2
g–1) are favourable 
features for being good materials for hydrogen storage and for ‘Hydrogen Economy’. The concept 
of AC being an energy material has been acknowledged widely (Sevilla and Mokaya 2014). Earlier 
researchers, Chahine et al. (1994) demystified the relationship between the capacity of hydrogen 
storage of AC and micro pore volume. They reported 2 wt% of hydrogen adsorptions at –196ºC and 
Rzepka (1998) obtained 1.3 wt% of hydrogen adsorption using similar materials, while Strobel et al. 
(1999) obtained a hydrogen adsorption of 1.5 wt% by using a microbalance in isothermal gravimetric 
method, pressures of 125 bars and at 238ºC. Darkrim et al. (2002) proved that adsorption hydrogen 
depends on micro pore volume and micro pore size distribution. Zhan et al. (2002) calculated the 
adsorption of hydrogen on ACs to be 23.76 wt%. According to them, the hydrogen adsorption 
potential becomes 0kJ.mol–1 when the hydrogen adsorption reaches about 800 bars; hence, no more 
hydrogen molecules could be adsorbed into the micro pores. At such high pressure, the porous nature 
of the adsorbent is likely to be destroyed and part of the hydrogen adsorbed may get desorbed. Shindo 
et al. (2003) prepared mechanically milled activated carbon; they suggested that the mechanism 
of adsorption by ACs was because of adsorption of molecules of hydrogen into the pores in the 
carbon as hydrogen molecules and assisted by the dangling bonds formed due to ball-milling. In 
2004, Challet et al. found an increase in chemisorption of hydrogen gas with Li and K doped micro 
porous activated carbons, though the isotherms of these doped AC did not exhibit any alteration 
in sorption ratio compared to the as obtained AC at 77 K. Kojima and Suzuki (2004) obtained 
similar results, but the hydrogen adsorbed by the K-doped AC was desorbed at temperature range 
of about 440–1370 K, implying chemisorption. Various researchers have reported that hydrogen 
uptake by such carbons was proportional to the SSA and pore volume. Metal decorated Activated 
carbon fibres (ACF) have better hydrogen adsorption properties, as observed by Takagi et al. (2004). 
Lee et al. (2007) further substantiated this finding and reported that such fibres are more efficient than 
as obtained fibres, possibly due to chemisorption. ACF were oxidized by ammonium persulphate and 
another aliquot was reduced by hydrogen, and their hydrogen adsorption capacities were investigated 
over a range of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen adsorption capacity was increased by reduction 
and decreased by oxidation. Shang Li in 2005 reported the electrochemical hydrogen adsorption on 
AC–Copper electrode; the discharge capacity was 510 mAh/g after 384 cycles, such high capacities 
have not been observed in CNT–Cu electrodes. According to Strobel et al. (2006) 6 wt% of hydrogen 
adsorption would be possible if the SSA of the samples exceeds 4000 m2
g–1. Potassium doped AC 
synthesized from coconut shells exhibited hydrogen adsorption of 0.85 wt% under pressure of 
10 MPa and 298 K (Hangkyo et al. 2007). AC obtained from anthracite, a type of coal, by activating 
with potassium hydroxide had SSA of 3183 m2
g–1 and hydrogen adsorption reported was 3.2 wt% 
at 200 bars and ambient temperature (Jorda-Beneyto et al. 2007). The theoretical calculations made 
by Zhan for hydrogen adsorption was reported to be up to 23wt% but this high capacity is never 
reached by anyone. Jorda-Beneyto reached up to 3.2 wt% hydrogen adsorption with a SSA of 
3183 m2
g–1. Zielinski et al. in 2007 studied hydrogen storage in AC decorated with nickel particles. 
They studied the impact of some of the factors which influence the hydrogen storage viz. factors 
like metal salt used as precursor, extent of metal present, and also the different methods of synthesis 
were analyzed. The investigation summarized that the adsorption of hydrogen on carbon was due to 
chemisorption by spill-over of hydrogen molecule. The molecules dissociate on the decorated metal 
particles and then migrate on to the carbon surface. A number of researchers used this technique 
to increase the extent of hydrogen adsorption with varying degree of success. Wang et al. (2009) 
demonstrated that potassium hydroxide activation could create remarkable porosity to the carbon Nanostructures for Hydrogen Storage 367
material. Accordingly, the SSA of the material was increased to remarkable extent (3190 m2
g–1) and 
hydrogen adsorption reported was 7.08 wt% at 77 K and pressure of 2 MPa. 
Nitrogen containing ACs, activated by potassium hydroxide with high SSA of 500–2400 m2
g–1
and pore volume range 0.26–1.16 cm3
g–1, have shown 2.94 wt% of hydrogen storage at 77 K 
and at 0.1 MPa. The hydrogen uptake was found to be linearly dependent on ultra-pore volume 
0.5–0.7 nm, but non linearly with SSA and pore volume (Sethia and Sayari 2016). Carbon synthesized 
from rice straw on activation with potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate has shown large 
surface area of 2000–2100 m2
/g, and 0.65 wt% and 0.55 wt% of hydrogen adsorption capacity, 
respectively, at ambient temperature and at a pressure of 100 bars (Schaefer et al. 2017).
Plerdsranoy et al. (2019) has shown that transition metal halide provides catalytic effect for 
dehydrogenation process, improved thermal conductivity of ACs, increased hydrogen permeability 
and in addition, prevention of particle agglomeration during cycling. 
Thus, it can be concluded that porous ACs containing substantial number of active sites, very 
high SSA, and large pore volume is necessary for high gravimetric hydrogen storage. Though 
theoretical analysis indicates SSA as a relevant factor for hydrogen storage, many researchers have 
found it to be less important than micropore volume. (Jimenez et al. 2010)
6. Carbon nano materials 
6.1 Graphitic nano-fibres—Graphitic nanofibres exhibit high hydrogen adsorption capacity and it 
is more than 20 L at STP conditions for each gram of carbon fibres at 120 KPa and 25ºC (Chambers 
et al. 1996, 1998). A near similar observation was made in case of Vapour Grown Carbon nanofibres 
(VGCNF). These fibres adsorb more than 10 wt% of hydrogen and the process is fairly spontaneous 
(Fan et al. 1999). Browning et al. (2002) prepared graphite carbon fibres from the decomposition 
of ethylene using various alloys of Fe-Ni-Cu and investigated their use in hydrogen storage. 
Mao et al. (2000) has reported maximum hydrogen adsorption of 9.99 wt%. They too reported 
that carbon nanofibres (CNF) can rapidly release hydrogen at room temp. Poirier et al. (2001) 
found that CNFs adsorb hydrogen to about 0.7 wt% at 10.5 MPa at room temperature. Nickel￾copper alloy when used as catalyst in different ratios altered the morphology as well as SSA of the 
fibres. Hwang et al. (2002) found hydrogen adsorption of 1.4 wt% at 120 KPa and 25ºC with CNFs 
prepared by pyrolysis of methane gas in presence of Ni-MgO as catalyst at 1200ºC in nitrogen 
atmosphere. Awasthi et al. (2002) tried to ball-mill graphite to obtain graphitic carbon but this did 
not help positively in hydrogen adsorption. Hanada et al. (2003) detected up to 5.1 wt% hydrogen 
adsorption by CNFs at a temperature of 303–873 K by a TGA on CNFs doped with potassium 
nitrate. Yoon et al. (2004) warned that activation of CNFs under severe conditions can destroy its 
morphology. According to Blackman et al. (2006), activation of CNFs using potassium hydroxide 
was a better choice than carbon dioxide as the SSA was about 1000 m2
g–1. This was much higher 
than when activated by carbon dioxide. An interesting finding was that the increase in SSA offered 
no proportional rise in hydrogen adsorption. Young et al. (2007) modified ACFs by doping with 
Ni and fluorination to increase the SSA and pore volume. It was found that due to fluorination, 
the hydrogen adsorption increased though the pore volume was found to decrease, while due to 
doping with nickel, pore volume remained unchanged but hydrogen adsorption was significantly 
enhanced as the result of catalytic activation of nickel. Im et al. (2008) concluded that in activated 
CNFs prepared from polyacrylonitrile and activated by potassium hydroxide and zinc chloride, if 
the diameter of the pores were in the range of 0.6–0.7 nm, then hydrogen adsorption was found to be 
more effective. Pillared Graphene—a three-dimensional carbon nanostructure having tunable pore 
sizes by design and high SSA—was used by Dimitrakaki et al. (2008) for hydrogen adsorption via 
grand canonical Monte Carlo and ab initio calculations. When this carbon material was decorated 
with lithium nanoparticles, its hydrogen storage was raised to 41 g hydrogen per liter at ambient 
conditions. Diaz et al. (2010) modified different CNF based materials and studied their hydrogen 368 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
storage capacity at ambient pressure. They found that for impregnation of metals like palladium, 
its aqueous precursors were more effective than organic precursors and functionalized CNF were 
found have about 100% more hydrogen adsorption than as obtained CNF. According to Wu et al.
(2010), the important factors in increasing the hydrogen adsorption in turbostatic CNFs was due to 
the defects formed on the carbon materials and other graphitic substances.
Lee et al. (2010) synthesized calcium particles decorated Zigzag Graphene Nano-Ribbon 
(ZGNR) which could adsorb hydrogen up to 5 wt%. Du et al. (2010) observed that lithium particles 
decorated porous graphene to be better materials for hydrogen adsorption than non-porous graphene, 
with hydrogen adsorption of 12 wt%. When aluminum particles decorated on both the sides of 
graphene layers were used for hydrogen storage, it adsorbed 13.79 wt% and adsorption energy was 
found to be –0.193 eV per hydrogen molecule, according to density-functional calculations (Ao and 
Peeters 2010). A simulated process was used to study chemisorption of hydrogen using corrugated 
graphene sheets and discharge by mechanical deformations. The corrugation was found to be out￾of-plane up to ± 0.2 Å yielding fast adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. These systems offer 
hydrogen storage up to 8 wt% (Tozzini and Pellegrini 2011). 
Bimetallic decorated CNFs containing Nickel and Ceria were tested for hydrogen adsorption 
capacity by George et al. (2021) and 1.858 wt% hydrogen adsorption was reported at the charge￾discharge density of 500 mA/g.
The graphitic carbon fibres were expected to show high hydrogen storage capacity but very 
high degree of variation is observed. It was proved that the process of synthesis of CNFs was 
responsible for its hydrogen adsorption capacity.
6.2 Single Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (SWCNTs)—Dillon et al. (1997) investigated the hydrogen
storage capacity using Temperature—Programmed Desorption (TPD) measurements. Their finding 
was that desorption of hydrogen was at ~ 133 K for both the samples. However, a second peak was 
observed at 290 K when heated in vacuum, which indicates second type of hydrogen adsorption, 
possibly in the interior part of SWCNTs. The desorption process at high temperature was absent in 
ACs. Dillon et al. (1999b) achieved hydrogen storage adsorption ~ 3.5–4.5 wt% at room temperature 
and at pressure of about 0.6 bars by introducing cutting method to synthesize short SWCNTs in high 
concentration with open ends. Later on, Liu et al. (1999) observed 8 wt% of hydrogen adsorptions 
on crystalline ropes of SWCNTs at 80 K and 40 bars. Ye et al. (1999) broadened the diameter of 
SWCNTs by rupturing the crystalline rope by sonication and achieved the hydrogen adsorption to 
8.25 wt% at 80 K and 7 MPa. Ding et al. (2001) increased the specific surface area by splitting the 
ropes into individual tubes. Wang et al. (2002) found hydrogen adsorption of 8 wt% for CNTs.
Chen et al. (2001) proposed that there must be sites at which adsorption of hydrogen is favoured 
in SWCNTs. Accordingly, SWCNTs with open ends occupy hydrogen in two manners: endohedral 
adsorption and exohedral adsorption. They synthesized CNTs of 50–100 nm diameters capable of 
storing hydrogen upto 5–7 wt% later improvised to 13 wt% by pretreatments. Another suggestion 
made by Ding et al. (2001) was that by thermal treatment catalyst tips were removed, which helped 
in increasing the hydrogen adsorption. 
Surprisingly, when Dai et al. (2002) synthesized macroscopic ropes of SWCNTs with a 
diameter of 1.72 nm, they used a semi-continuous arc discharge method and reported 503 mAhg–1 
of discharge capacity, equivalent to 1.84 wt% hydrogen adsorption. Lawrence and Xu (2004) 
studied the monolayer saturation plateau on purified SWCNTs at ambient temperature and reported 
0.9 wt% of hydrogen adsorption. This indicates that the results may not be reproducible. Schimmel 
et al. (2004) suggested the reason that due to bundling of SWCNT and opened-SWCNT, they 
possess a low SSA. Efremenko and Sheintuch (2005) predicted low adsorption (~ 1 wt%) at 10 MPa 
in Langmuir isotherms. Few others like Nobuyuki et al. (2002), Shen et al. (2004) and Shaijumon 
et al. (2005) have synthesized SWCNTs by various methods; unfortunately, these samples adsorbed Nanostructures for Hydrogen Storage 369
not more than 3 wt% of hydrogen. Takagi et al. (2006, 2007) found that activation by nitric acid 
enhances the adsorption of hydrogen by changing bundle structure by binding out functional group 
introduced during acid treatment. Lee et al. (2006) has reported that Ni decorated SWCNTs are 
capable of releasing nearly 10 wt% hydrogen at room temperature. Nikitin et al. (2008) studied 
chemisorption of hydrogen in SWCNTs using atomic hydrogen for hydrogenation. Their study 
showed specific carbon nanotubes form reversible C−H bonds, due to which the adsorption increases 
to beyond 7 wt%. 
Rashidi et al. (2010) prepared SWCNT by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) at 900ºC over 
cobalt-molybdenum nanoparticles and reported maximum adsorption of 0.8 wt%. They concluded 
that there was no desired adsorption due to insufficient binding between carbon materials and 
hydrogen. Zhou and Williams (2011) made similar observations for platinum decorated CNTs.
SWCNT bundles and aligned CNTs are expected to show very high hydrogen adsorption capacity 
because of the availability of two side surfaces of the CNTs. At the same time, large variations in the 
results are obtained, i.e., 8% in case of SWCNT bundles and 13% in case of aligned CNTs.
Vellingiri et al. (2019) synthesized composite of SWCNT-LiBH4
 by facile ultra-sonication 
assisted impregnation and then oxidation at 573 K. During adsorption/desorption study, highest 
hydrogen adsorption was 4 wt% under pressure 5 bar at 373 K. 
The above-mentioned results indicate that various methods of synthesis and treatments are 
responsible in controlling the hydrogen storage. Therefore, standardization of the method of 
synthesis of SWCNTs is a necessity.
6.3 Multi-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (MWCNTs)—Hou et al.’s (2002) findings suggested 
that MWCNTs may have more hydrogen storage capacity than SWCNTs due to its opened tips, 
simple chemical state and large pore volume. Hydrogen storage capacity was 6.3 wt%. Accordingly, 
Liu et al. (2003) synthesized MWCNTs with open ends and reported 0.69 wt% adsorption. 
The adsorption of hydrogen, 3.7 wt%, and desorption of 3.6 wt% at 69 bar was reported by Lueking 
et al. (2003) on MWCNT/NiMgO system. According to Huang et al. (2003), annealing of CNT in 
nitrogen at 500ºC and soaking in a 1.0 M potassium nitrate solution increases hydrogen adsorption, 
but hydrogen adsorption capacity achieved was only 3.2 wt% at a moderate pressure of 120 bars. 
Peng-Xiang et al. (2003) observed that the adsorption capacity was proportional to the diameter of 
the nano tube and there was no complete desorption at standard conditions. Additionally, structural 
morphology reveals that the surface modification and porous structures enhance the hydrogen 
uptake capacity. Zheng et al. (2005) investigated hydrogen storage on MWCNTs volumetrically and 
calculated the intermolecular interaction energy, and found no evidence of adsorption. Shaijumon 
et al. (2005) synthesized MWCNTs from acetylene and achieved 3.2 wt% hydrogen storage at 60 
bars and 125 K temperature. Naab et al. (2006) was highly disappointed to find that SWCNT, 
MWCNTs and carbon nanofibres show < 1 wt% adsorption. Chen et al. (2007) used potassium 
hydroxide to modify MWCNTs and annealed those at high temperatures. They observed that 
capacity of KOH treated and untreated CNTs to store hydrogen was 4.47 and 0.71 wt%, respectively. 
Interestingly, Rakhi et al. (2008) also synthesized MWCNT acetylene as precursor, Dy-Ni alloy as 
the catalyst and found the adsorption capacity to be 3.5 wt% at 143 K and 7.5 MPa. Park et al. (2010) 
enhanced the adsorption property of MWCNT by microwave treatment. The treatment makes the 
surface microporous. Park and Lee (2010) reported that platinum particles decorated on MWCNT 
showed better hydrogen storage capacity compared to the as obtained MWCNTs. In a similar work, 
Reyhani et al. (2011) observed that decoration of MWCNT by transition metal particles enhances 
its hydrogen storage capacity. Palladium (Pd) seems to be a better metal as it dissociates hydrogen 
faster. Aghababaei et al. (2020) carried out surface activation of MWCNTs by potassium hydroxide 
and studied the effect. Li and Co metal nanoparticles were decorated on the nanotubes. At 278 K, 
the Li-decorated MWCNT adsorbed 1.33 wt% of hydrogen while Co-decorated MWCNTs adsorbed 
1.06 wt% at the same temperature.370 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
Thus, the hydrogen storage by SWCNTs was detected as less than MWCNTs as hydrogen 
atom can occupy the empty space between the layers of carbon and be enhanced by transition metal 
decoration and other chemical treatments.
6.4 Metal Doped Carbon Nano Tubes—Chen et al. (1999) reported 20 wt% gravimetric storage 
of hydrogen with Li-doped CNTs while undoped CNTs showed virtually negligible amount (0.4 
wt%). For the process, doping was done by reaction with Li containing compound such as nitrates 
and carbonates. Froudakis (2001) used QM/MM model to study adsorption of molecular hydrogen 
on CNTs doped with alkali-metal and suggested that such nanotubes exhibit greater adsorption 
of hydrogen in comparison to as obtained SWCNTs due to charge-induced dipole interaction. 
Hydrogen adsorption capacities were investigated in different materials like doped porous carbons, 
AC (1600 m2
g–1) and SWCNTs by Challet et al. (2004) and observed increase in adsorption at 
ambient condition but not at 77 K. Kojima and Suzuki (2004) found that due to high SSA, K-doped 
AC adsorbs more hydrogen than K-doped graphite.
Hu et al. (2005) reported 4.21 wt% and 3.95 wt % adsorption of hydrogen for Li and K doped 
SWCNTs. Giraudet and Zhu (2011) found that doping of carbon by nickel nanoparticles increases 
hydrogen storage at room temperature as well as at elevated temperatures.
Thus, it can be commented that CNTs doped with metal particles show greater adsorption of 
hydrogen than primal CNTs and doping by lithium metal is a better option than other alkali metals. In 
these findings, surface area also plays an important role. Other than alkali metals, doping of carbon 
by nickel improves adsorption of hydrogen even at ambient temperature. Dou et al. (2019) has 
reported that 3.35 wt% reversible hydrogen storage capacity of Mg-Ni-Cu/CNTs can be achieved 
at 583 K and 3.0 atm pressure. In this experiment, isothermal hydrogen adsorption and desorption 
of doped-CNTs were studied and the findings were analyzed by shrinking core model method. 
Magnesium metal doped reduced graphene oxide efficiently promoted hydrogen adsorption and 
desorption processes up to 6.5 wt% (Cho et al. 2017). Huang et al. (2017) prepared carbon wrapped 
transition metal (Ni/C, Co/C) nano-particles and used as catalyst in magnesium hydride system. 
Magnesium hydride doped with Ni/C shows 6.1 wt% of hydrogen adsorption and release at 523 K. 
Also, magnesium hydride Ni/C is able to store hydrogen gas at 373 K within 30s.
7. In pyrolyzed plant/animal materials
In 1989, Laine et al. prepared ACs from coconut shells catalyzed by potassium. They studied the 
different factors affecting these syntheses. Sharon et al. (2008) synthesized the carbon materials with 
different conditions of temperature, atmosphere, activation, etc. These materials were prepared from 
plants-based precursors, and for them hydrogen adsorption was substantially below 6.4 wt%. Suzuki 
et al. (2007) used rice bran as precursor for hydrogen storage and synthesized activated mesoporous 
carbon having SSA of 652-m2 g−1 and 0.137 cm3 g−1 as the pore volume. Balathanigaimani et al. 
(2009) performed study on corn grain-carbon monoliths (CG-CMs) at about 1 bar pressure and 77 K 
and also at 50 bars and 298 K. The findings showed that the CG-CMs and carbon monoliths have 
similar hydrogen adsorption capacities. Takahata et al. (2009) reported 0.6 wt% hydrogen storage 
by carbon activated by potassium hydroxide synthesized from waste coffee beans having very high 
SSA of 2070 m2
g–1 with pore size 0.6 to 1.1 nm. Akasaka et al. (2011) performed an identical study 
on AC from waste coffee beans. Takahata et al. (2009) found that, the morphology of the pores and 
the adsorption capacity of the carbon material to be proportional. It is also proportional to the SSA. 
Senoz and wool (2011) carried out an innovative work on pyrolyzed chicken feather fibre (PCFF) 
which showed very poor hydrogen adsorption capacity. The biomass of Posidonia Oceanica and 
Wood Chips were pyrolyzed at 600ºC in an inert atmosphere, which showed hydrogen uptake up to 
5 wt% (Pedicini et al. 2020). Im et al. (2010) studied the pyrolysis of mesoporous carbon nanofibres Nanostructures for Hydrogen Storage 371
(MCNFs). The MCNF pyrolyzed at 1200ºC, at 77 K and 1 bar pressure shows hydrogen uptake of 
0.73 wt%. This work was based on dependence of SSA of MCNFs, carbonization temperature and 
hydrogen storage capacity.
Though different carbon materials have been synthesized from plant and animal-based 
precursors since a long time, the idea to use such materials to study hydrogen adsorption cropped up 
only in 2007, courtesy Sharon et al. These materials have high SSA, but still the extent of hydrogen 
adsorption is not up to the mark. Thus, the study of hydrogen adsorption by these remains a challenge 
and open to further investigation and research.
8. Theoretical models
Based on the observations of various workers, two theoretical models of types of CNM for adsorption 
of hydrogen can be proposed:
1. Surface adsorption of hydrogen by the dangling bonds of CNTs.
2. Storage of hydrogen in the lumen of CNT as well as between the walls of MWCNTs.
8.1 Surface adsorption of hydrogen by CNT
The earliest attempt of storing hydrogen in ACs and CNTs was performed by molecular simulation 
of hydrogen storage in both ACs and CNTs (Rzepka et al. 1998, Wang and Johnson 1999). Their 
findings, however, did not support either CNT or activated carbon suitable for hydrogen storage, 
though they presented MO calculations, which showed superiority of CNT over activated carbon as 
far as hydrogen storage is concerned. Later, various workers performed experimental observations 
using CNT. Storage of hydrogen atom takes place in the nanotube by rupturing the carbon-carbon 
bond but maintaining the stability of the walls of nanotubes (Lee et al. 2001). Simultaneously, 
Froudakis et al. (2001) suggested that due to insertion of the atoms of hydrogen to the walls of tube, 
the binding of hydrogen atoms will occur in a zigzag manner, which leads to alteration of the shape 
of the tube resulting in 15% increase in the tube volume.
Dodziuk et al. (2002) presented calculations on hydrogen adsorption by CNTs and suggested 
that large quantities of hydrogen adsorption by CNTs cannot be achieved through physisorption. 
Li et al. (2003) proposed that due to slow kinetics, theoretically there is an upper limit for chemisorption 
of 7.7 wt%, but in practice this could be difficult to achieve. Moreover, during desorption, due to 
attachment of dangling bonds on the surface of CNT, the CNT loses its metallic nature and strong 
C–H covalent bonding slows down the kinetics of hydrogen recombination. There was a trivial 
Raman shift seen in the Q branch; thus, this could help in clear corroboration that the mechanism 
of interaction with the adsorbing material is simply physisorption while there is no charge transfer 
involved in the reaction. Energy barrier was found of 2.7 eV for hydrogen dissociation on the surface 
of tube. However, once there is occurrence of chemisorption, the hydrogenated tube is metastable 
only against ripping (Chen et al. 2005).
8.2 Uptake of hydrogen in lumen or internal spaces
Cracknell (2002) suggested that due to space limitation, hydrogen molecules, which were absorbed 
in the interstitial spaces, were not able to form stable clusters. The enthalpy of adsorption, which 
supports stable cluster formation in the internal spaces, is < 303 K (Murata et al. 2002).
It must be mentioned here that uptake of hydrogen is greater in the optimal graphitic nanofibres 
with slit-like pores than predicted in case of the internal space of a CNT. Moreover, the hydrogen 
that enters into the tube is difficult to release because the lumen diameter is very small and it would 
require very high energy to come out. Therefore, when release of hydrogen was recorded, it was 372 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
suggested that hydrogen atoms must have been bound to the tube walls instead of being part of 
interior.
From the discussion, it can be concluded that hydrogen, which is adsorbed on tube surface, can 
escape easily but those, which enter the tube (endohedral), cannot do so easily. The covalent bond 
formed between carbon and hydrogen as well as the orientation of the tubes restricts the removal 
by increasing the desorption energy. The studies performed so far reveal three features that need 
elaborated study and understanding prior to contemplating CNMs as hydrogen storage devices. 
These features are:
Rather slow uptake of hydrogen by CNM
Less desorption of adsorbed hydrogen
Possibility of promoting adsorption of hydrogen by using transition metals
9. Hydrogen storage measurement
Hydrogen storage capacity of different materials is determined by three methods, i.e., by
Gravimetric,
Volumetric
Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD).
For the present work, volumetric method has been used, as this facility was available. Hence, 
here the volumetric method is being discussed briefly using Sievert’s apparatus. 
In case of volumetric method, the sample is kept in a sample holder having definite volume. It 
is degassed and then subjected to hydrogen gas at known pressure, so adsorption of hydrogen gas 
causes reduction in pressure; this difference between pressure values is used for calculation of the 
volume of adsorbed hydrogen.
Different scientists (Sandrock et al. 1981, Chambers et al. 1998, Sivakumar et al. 1999, 
Zacharia et al. 2005, Reddy and Ramaprabhu 2008, Sharon et al. 2007, 2008, 2011) made use of 
Sievert’s apparatus for investigating hydrogen uptake on CNMs at different pressures. Calculation 
of adsorption capacity is done by using ideal gas law, i.e., PV = nRT. Van der Waal’s correction 
factors ‘a’ and ‘b’ have been applied considering non-ideal behavior of hydrogen molecules 
(a—for the inter molecular force, b—for molecular size) for improving precision of the result. 
Accordingly, the modified form of equation used for the calculation of the extent of hydrogen 
adsorbed due to the reduction in the pressure and the Sievert’s apparatus is

This chapter is a depiction and overview of variety of promising possibilities for storage of 
hydrogen in diverse conditions (physical) and in combination with various forms of carbon along 
with different kinds of materials. It is corroborated that specific properties possessed by a creditable 
hydrogen storage material be listed as high capacity to store hydrogen per unit mass and volume 
to ascertain the quantity of energy available, lower enthalpy of formation to reduce the energy 
required for release of hydrogen as well as lower heat of dissipation for hydride formation which 
is exothermic process, reversibility, moderate dissociation pressure, low dissociation temperature, 
negligible energy loss for the charging and discharging of hydrogen, optimum kinetics, significantly 
long cycle life, maintaining high degree of safety and low recycling cost.Nanostructures for Hydrogen Storage 373
Metal hydrides are also good alternative for hydrogen storage but are heavy and their shorter 
lifetime is a major constraint. High-pressure tank storage of compressed hydrogen is uneconomical, 
mainly due to energy considerations. Hydrogen storage in glass microspheres or in an array of glass 
microtubules is also promising but highly uneconomical. Different chemicals have been explored 
to store hydrogen but the processes are found to be irreversible. Substances like metal organic 
framework systems have shown promising results as hydrogen storage materials but their practical 
viability is a distant possibility. 
After so much of efforts, even now there is no best hydrogen storage material and still there 
is a long way to go. Authors have considered different parameters like the morphology of CNMs, 
SSA, pore size, pore volume, doping and the activation of CNMs by nano metals. The reported 
hydrogen storage capacity values have a very wide range. Hence, hydrogen adsorption by CNMs is 
a wide open issue, which needs to be solved by keeping in mind various factors controlling uptake 
of hydrogen and obviously the solution for which world is eagerly waiting should be able to give 
required and reproducible results.

1. Introduction
1.1 Introduction to water splitting
Hydrogen is one of the clean source of energy with the gravimetric energy density ca. 120 MJ Kg, 
which is more than 2.5 times than gasoline (44 MJ kg). Its clean production does not lead to the CO2 
emission or greenhouse gases, which makes it one of the ideal eco-friendly energy source that can 
replace the non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuels (Wang et al. 2020). Oxygen is another 
important gas which is needed for various energy devices (Song et al. 2017, Nørskov et al. 2004);
it is also needed in the medical facilities like in the Covid-19 situation in the year 2020 and 2021 
where many deaths occurred due to a shortage of oxygen supply (Bikkina et al. 2021).
Water is abundant and easily available on most parts of the Earth. Chemically, it is made up of 
2 molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen forming H2
O molecule. Thus, it can act as the 
source to supply hydrogen and oxygen if the elements are separated or bond is broken in the H2
O 
molecule (H2
O H2
 + O2
). The process of breaking the water molecule is water splitting. In other 
words, water splitting is the chemical reaction where water molecule is broken down into hydrogen 
and oxygen with some additional energy like chemical, with solar light, electric, thermal, nuclear, 
and so on. The photochemical process is the slowest method among all of the methods. Steam 
forming mostly generates hazardous gases like CO, CO2
, and oxides of sulfur. Conditions to operate 
most of these methods require elevated temperature and pressure. The instability of catalysts in 
the photoelectrochemical cells limits prolonging the application of such catalysts in water splitting 
(Anantharaj and Noda 2020). Water splitting by utilization of combined energies of the electric and 
chemical energy is referred to as Electrochemical Water Splitting (EWS).Electrochemical Water Splitting 379
Benefits of EWS: EWS is a clean source of hydrogen and oxygen production. Thus, it is one of the 
highest energy generation sources to produce pure hydrogen without any greenhouse gases, which 
makes it a sustainable, pollution-free, eco-friendly method. It is easy for setup and can be used from 
small scale to large level generation of hydrogen and oxygen (Yan et al. 2016). EWS can be used as 
and when required or as on on-demand energy source. It is possible to make commercial units with 
a low cost of investment. It is an energy source which can be used in stationary as well as mobile 
devices.
1.2 Electrochemical fundamentals of water splitting
Electrolyte: Use of pure water for electrolysis is constrained due to its high resistance of 18 MΩcm 
whereas tap water and seawater have a low resistance of ca. 5 and 20 Ωcm, respectively. However, 
contamination of redox active elements restricts their applicability in the EWS. Therefore, highly 
acidic and highly alkaline solutions are used for the EWS. Water splitting obeys Nernstian behavior, 
i.e., reaction strongly depends on the pH of electrolyte whereas unit increase in pH has the cathodic 
redox potential shift of 0.059V.
Electrode/Electrocatalysts: The ideal catalyst for the EWS can be selected based on the 
thermodynamic and kinetic catalytic activity, stability under operation and during stationary state, 
and high selectivity towards hydrogen and oxygen adsorption. It is accepted as a standard to relate 
the overpotential requisite to achieve 10 mA cm–2 current density with respect to geometric area 
at standard temperature and pressure (O2
: 1 atm), which is ca. 10 % effectual water splitting by 
the solar radiations of 1 sun. Thus, the figure describing overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm–2 is 
the figure of merit in the EWS (McCrory et al. 2013). However, there are many aspects which can 
alter the real electrocatalytic results like catalyst design, porosity, spillover, hydrophobicity, and 
hydrophilicity; thus, some researchers demand the overpotential normalized with electrochemical 
active surface area (i.e., ECSA) (Anantharaj and Noda 2020). To determine the rate of reaction on 
the specific electrocatalyst, kinetics is determined using Tafel slop, exchange current density, and 
turnover frequency (Anantharaj and Noda 2020).
Amorphous and crystalline nature of the catalysts has a high impact on the EWS. Anantharaj 
and Noda 2020 reviewed an influence of the crystallinity of the electrocatalysts towards the EWS 
and concluded that the amorphous nature of the electrocatalysts increases the electrocatalytic active 
surface area (ESCA) due to the irregular crystal structure which further helps in the diffusion of 
reactant, intermediate products and mass transport of gases evolved by electrolysis enhances the 
surface-confined reaction. Furthermore, the flexibility of electrodes with the amorphous catalysts 
is more than the crystalline electrocatalysts which also provides room for the catalyst to alter 
the crystal structure during electrolysis (Anantharaj and Noda 2020). Low cost electrocatalysts 
replacing the high cost state-of-the-art electrocatalysts have been experimentally proved as an 
efficient electrocatalysts such as transition metal (oxy)hydroxides, layer double hydroxides (LDH), 
chalcogenides, phosphides, nitrides, borides, carbides, and multimetallic alloys. 
Set up of EWS: In general, for the half-cell reaction, 3-electrode cell is used as represented in 
Figure 1 and for the overall water splitting, 2-electrode cell is fabricated (Figure 1A). As usual, there 
are electrodes, working electrode on which electrocatalyst is deposited for the testing, counter or 
auxiliary electrode which provides the surface for the counter reaction and it is selected in such a 
way that the reaction should not be limited by the slow reaction that occurs at the counter electrode. 
The third electrode is the reference electrode (RE); it is preferable that the RE is in the same solvent 
as used in the electrolyte (Figure 1B). For all the experiments and comparisons, same electrode 
surface area, the spacing in-between the electrodes, quantity, and concentration of electrolyte 
should be kept constant for accuracy and reproducibility. Generally, acidic electrolyte, for example, 380 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
0.5 M H2
SO4
, is used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of the high concentration of 
hydrogen ions while an alkaline solution is used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the 
high concentration of hydroxyl ions promoting easy adsorption on the electrocatalysts (Ramaswamy 
and Mukerjee 2012). However, for half-cell reactions, it can be selected while for commercial use 
one electrolyte should be used for both reactions. Thus, it is challenging to perform HER in alkaline 
and OER in acidic conditions (Gu et al. 2020a, Mahmood et al. 2018).
1.3 State-of the-art catalysts Pt (HER) and Ru, Ir (OER)
The catalyst for water splitting is selected based on the ΔG (free energy to adsorb hydrogen, 
hydroxyl, or oxygen on the catalyst surface). The ΔG close to zero with high current density is 
the criteria to select the superior electrocatalyst. There are volcano plots plotted according to the 
potential or current densities versus ΔG (Cook et al. 2010, Man et al. 2011, Trasatti 1972). Based on 
these, Pt is referred to as a state-of-the-art catalyst for the HER, while Ir and Ru are for the OER. 
The important criteria for the selection of catalyst is to adsorb the hydrogen, hydroxyl, or oxygen 
and to detach the H2
 and O2
 evolved or any byproduct attached to the surface of the catalyst. Thus, 
in addition to element, its morphology, size, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, porosity, and surface area 
are important parameters influencing the EWS. High cost of the state-of-the-art catalysts demands 
exploring alternative cheap and stable catalysts.
1.4 Applications of EWS
Water splitting is a simple electrochemical process that has had many applications in recent years 
since through electrolysis, it is possible to decompose different compounds; the only condition is 
that these melted or dissolved compounds release ions. Electrolysis is often used in electroplating 
metals such as copper, gold, tin, silver and chromium to avoid or reduce corrosion or to enhance 
beauty of the materials. EWS opts as a tool for the immobilization of biomolecules on the electrodes 
by changing the surface pH in the vicinity of electrodes, for example, ascorbate oxidase immobilized 
on the gold electrode by hydrogen evolution (Patil et al. 2012). Many devices have been improved 
based on this simple electrochemical technique like metal-air batteries and hydrogen fuel cells 
(Schmidt et al. 2003).
Metal-air batteries: The storage of hydrogen obtained by EWS has enormous potential for portable 
devices for electric vehicles and extensive energy-storage networks. Among the batteries, the metal￾air battery has promising future due to its high theoretical energy density 40.1 MJ/kg, equivalent to 
Figure 1. A: two-electrode system and B: three-electrode system.Electrochemical Water Splitting 381
gasoline (40.6 MJ/kg) (Tahir et al. 2017). In the non-aqueous metal-air batteries, oxygen evolution 
mechanism and process is different than the aqueous one. EWS is applicable in the aqueous metal￾air barriers in the cathode where OER is carried out by electrocatalysts, for example, zinc-air, 
lithium-air, aluminium-air batteries, and so on (Liu et al. 2020).
Fuel cells: The fuel cell is an energy device based on the electrochemical reactions whose concept is 
similar to that of a battery and it can be considered as the reverse process of EWS where hydrogen 
and oxygen are used and water is produced through overall reaction 2H2
 + O2
 → 2H2
O. It consists 
of the production of electricity through the use of chemicals, which are usually hydrogen (oxidized 
at anode through 2H2
 → 4H+
 + 4e–
) and oxygen (reduced at cathode as 4H+
 + 4e–
 + O2
 → 2H2
O), 
where hydrogen acts as a fuel element and oxygen is obtained directly from the air. Thus, EWS can 
be used as the clean energy source for this purpose (Ströbel et al. 2002). 
CO2
 reduction: During CO2
 reduction in the aqueous electrolyte, one of the major challenges is HER 
interference, particularly altering the local pH near the vicinity of the electrocatalyst surface, thus 
indirectly proving its importance to avoid or minimize HER during the CO2
 reduction. Therefore, 
it is important to reveal the fundamentals of the HER on the selective electrocatalysts (Ooka et al. 
2017).
2. Electrochemical water splitting mechanism
The theoretical standard potential of EWS is 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 25ºC 
and 1 atm irrespective of the reaction media. Overall, EWS is the resultant of two half-cell processes, 
which are HER and OER. Thus, OER should occur at the anode (1.23 V/RHE), while HER at the 
cathode (0.0 V/RHE). As a matter of fact, for breaking the intrinsic activation barriers like the 
contact and the solution resistances, a higher potential is required for the practical or experimental 
water splitting than the thermodynamic potentials. Such an additional potential required for water 
splitting after deducting thermodynamic standard potential is described as an overpotential (ɳ). 
Thus, minimizing overpotential required for water splitting is the key aspect, which can be achieved 
by selecting proper catalyst or catalysts and optimize electrolyzer design. The sluggish nature of 
OER due to multiple steps and intermediates formation increases the overpotential from 1.23 to 
usually 1.5 and more anodic. 
Water splitting mechanism is different in different electrolytes; however, the overall total 
reaction remains the same 2 H2
O 2H2
 + O2
.

2.1 HER mechanism 
HER mechanism in acidic medium (Yang et al. 2016, Tavares et al. 2001)
The first process in the HER is Volmer process where a proton from hydronium cation (H3
O+
) is 
attracted towards the electron rich electrocatalysts, resulting into an adsorbed hydrogen intermediate 
(H*) on the electrocatalysts.
These adsorbed hydrogen intermediates (H*) can couple with the hydronium ions to form 
hydrogen by Heyrovsky reaction or by coupling of two adjacent hydrogen intermediates (H*) 
through Tafel reaction.
HER mechanism in neutral/alkaline medium (Darband et al. 2019, Anantharaj 
et al. 2016a)
In the neutral or alkaline medium, a proton from the water molecule (H2
O) is attracted towards 
negatively charged electrocatalysts and forms the adsorbed layer of hydrogen intermediate (H*). 
Thus, the only difference in the Volmer reactions between the acidic and alkaline or neutral medium 
is the source of protons, which is adsorbed on the electrocatalysts and initiates the reaction.
H2
O + e– ⇄ Hadsorbed + OH–
 (Volmer adsorption process)
Hadsorbed + H2
O + electron ⇄ H2(g) + OH–
 (Heyrovsky process)
2 Hadsorbed ⇄ H2(g) (Tafel process)
The hydrogen production follows two pathways like in acidic medium by Heyrovsky reaction 
by an attraction between hydrogen intermediate (H*) and water molecule or by Tafel reactions 
where hydrogen is produced by the combination of two adjacent hydrogen intermediates. The 
possible pathways of the reaction can be interpreted experimentally using Tafel slopes. For the 
accurate interpretation of Tafel slopes, it is important to plot IR corrected plots as well as precise 
temperature and applied potential during the experiments. The Tafel slopes 118 mV dec–1, 39 mV 
dec–1, and 29 mV dec–1 corresponds to the Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel reactions (Li et al. 2016). 
Therefore, the rate-determining step can be found out using the Tafel slopes. For example, the rate 
determining step in the HER at the Pt (100) plane electrode is Heyrovsky while at the Pt (110) plane 
electrode, it is Tafel reaction (Schmidt et al. 2003).
In the HER, the first process is adsorbed intermediate modified electrocatalysts formed by the 
proton adsorption (from the acidic electrolyte) and H2
O (in neutral or alkaline electrolyte) from the 
electrolyte solution (Hadsorbed). The adsorbed proton or water molecule can produce hydrogen by two 
pathways: Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction or Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanism (Patil et al. 2019). 
2.2 OER mechanism
Numerous studies reveal that OER mechanism is not clear and occur on the anode with sluggish and 
complex proposed mechanisms than HER with multistep 4 electron transfer. OER occurs at a slower 
rate in comparison to HER. Like HER, instead of H+
 ions, OH–
 first forms the adsorbed layer on the 
electrocatalyst followed by the series of reactions as shown in the Equations (5–13).

where E is the electrode or electrocatalyst surface and cat¤ is the catalytically active site. The above￾mentioned mechanisms are general mechanisms while they may vary based on the electrocatalysts 
used. Also, during the measurements or applied potentials, resistances may increase due to cathodic 
and anodic reactions, gas bubble formation, or intermediate products. Electrocatalyst properties 
may also transform during catalysis. All these variations may change the required potentials for the 
reaction and the mechanism may also alter periodically.
3. Calculations and data interpretation 
3.1 Onset potential 
It is the redox potential required to initiate the HER or OER. From the CV or LSV, initial potential 
deviating from the non-Faradaic current (decrease in the case of HER while increase in the case of 
OER) excluding the redox peaks of catalysts (if electrocatalyst is oxidize and reduce in the selected 
potential window). Measurement of onset potential is a tricky method and there are various opinions 
about the correct method for estimating the onset potential. One method is to draw two tangents—
one parallel to capacitance and another with the inclined or declined current of OER and HER; 
the junction of these two lines is considered as the onset potential. Another method is considering 
the potential necessary to obtain the specific current density, for example, 0.5 mV above the non￾Faradaic current. An alternate method is considering the potential at which the current inclines 
or declines due to OER and HER. For the HER, since it is the cathodic reaction, the higher the 
anodic shift of the onset potential as a result of electrocatalytic activity, the better the electrocatalytic 
efficiency towards HER. On the contrary, OER is an anodic reaction higher the cathodic shift of 
onset potential better the electrocatalytic activity towards OER.
3.2 Tafel slope
The relation between the Tafel slope and charge transfer coefficient (α) is Tafel slope = 1/α. The 
Tafel slope mainly helps to interpret the rate of limiting reactions. Tafel slope proposes the additional 
required overpotential to upsurge the current density by 10-folds.384 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
The Tafel slope can be estimated from the LSV, chronoamperometry, and impedance 
spectroscopy. Commonly, Tafel slope is obtained using the LSV data (iR-compensated overpotential 
and non-Faradaic capacitance correction) based on the slope obtained by plotting the log (j) versus ɳ. 
ɳ = a + (2.3RT/αnF) log (j)
where, number of electrons require to complete the reactions is n, i.e., 4 for the OER and 2 for the 
HER while others are the constants with their usual standard meaning. Due to the inverse correlation 
between Tafel slope and α, the smaller the Tafel slope, higher the charge transferability or faster 
the kinetics. To obtain a precise slope with the least experimental inaccuracy, slow scan rate like 
1 mV s–1 is preferred.
Due to the limitation of obtaining the steady-state current in LSV, the chronoamperometric 
analysis is preferred for Tafel slope estimation. In the chronoamperometry, after few seconds of 
initiation of reaction, steady-state current is obtained. Thus, current versus time plots at small potential 
intervals like 5 mV s–1 measured at the IrTiO2
 shows linear region even at the lower overpotential 
region as compared to the Tafel slope obtained from CV (Fabbri et al. 2014). Therefore, for accuracy 
in Tafel slope, correction with the capacitance is an important step (although it is tricky and needs to 
be done very carefully to avoid misinterpretation of data) while estimating from the LSV. Another 
well accepted method of Tafel slope calculation is from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
(EIS). For using EIS, the Nyquist plots at a small interval of overpotentials are measured and Tafel 
slope is estimated from the log (Rct) vs. ɳ. Rct is the charge transfer resistance. As the solution 
resistance Rs (the real axis resistance value at the high-frequency intercept) is exempted and only 
depends on the electrocatalytic resistance, it is considered as one of the accurate methods of Tafel 
slope calculations (Anantharaj et al. 2016a, b).
The ideal catalyst must show a low Tafel slope for the efficient reaction kinetics.
3.3 Exchange current density
Exchange current density generally denoted by i
0
 or j
0
 is a key parameter which emphasizes the rate 
of reaction at the zero/equilibrium potential (Patil et al. 2019). 
The Buttler-Volmer equation at higher overpotential (η > 0.05 V) can be rewritten as
ɳ = a + (2.3RT/αnF) log (j) = (–2.3RT/αnF) log (j
0
) + (2.3RT/αnF) log (j)
Due to sluggish OER reaction, i
0
 or j
0 is frequently utilized to determine the HER catalysis 
(Anantharaj et al. 2016a). Higher the i
0
 or j
0
, better the electrocatalytic activity.
3.4 Stability of electrocatalysts
Stability of the electrocatalysts towards HER and OER are mainly investigated by the continuous 
CV at higher scan rate, i.e., 50 or 100 mV s–1 (generally, till present date, 1000 cycles are considered 
as a stable catalyst). Another method of evaluation of electrocatalytic stability is measuring the 
change in the current when applied potential is fixed (chronoamperometry) or by measuring the 
change in the potential when applied current is constant (chronopotentiomentry), preferably at 
10 mA cm–1 from few minutes till some hours (generally, till present date, 12 hours are considered 
as a stable catalyst) (Anantharaj et al. 2016a). It is always better to analyze the catalyst by LSV to 
understand the shift in the onset potential, ɳ10, and Tafel slope after the stability testing, whether by 
continuous CV, chronoamperometry or chronopotentiometry.Electrochemical Water Splitting 385
3.5 Turn over frequency (TOF)
The hydrogen or oxygen molecules evolved per surface electrocatalyst atom is measured by turn 
over frequency. In other words, TOF can be referred to the rate of electron delivered per surface 
electrocatalyst atom per second. 
TOF = INA/(AFnГ) (Anantharaj and Kundu 2019)
TOF = I/(4 × F × m) (Lu and Zhao 2015)
where I denotes the measured current in Amperes, NA and A are the Avogadro constant and 
geometrical surface area, F is Faraday constant, Г is the number of atoms determined from the 
concentration of catalysts either on the surface or in total atoms, and m is the number of active moles 
of electrocatalysts. The concentration of atoms can be estimated from the average particle diameter 
of electrocatalyst (Anantharaj et al. 2016c), using another elemental characterization like ICP-MS 
(Khalily et al. 2019), based on the charge determined from the redox activity of electrocatalyst (Patil 
et al. 2019). During the estimation of m, mostly it is assumed that all the electrocatalyst molecules 
are active towards the HER and OER. Some studies assume that the electrocatalyst is forming a 
monolayer or forms a flat smooth surface (Anantharaj et al. 2016a,b). Due to these assumptions, 
chances of error cannot be ruled out because it is well known that not all the electrocatalyst area is 
active and to obtain and retain flat surface during electrocatalysis is challenging.
3.6 Faradaic efficiency 
One method for Faradaic efficiency is through rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) relevant mostly 
in the OER (Guo et al. 2014). In general, RRDE is performed with the glassy carbon as a disk 
and Pt as the ring. After cleaning and polishing, prior to catalytic measurements, the empirical 
collection efficiency of RRDE (Nempirical) is determined using the conventional ferrous/ferric redox 
response with respect to selected rotational speed and slow scan rate (~ 50 mV s–1) by the ratio of 
I
limiting,ring/Ilimiting,disk. The catalyst material is deposited only on the disk. The measurements should 
be performed by sweeping the potential of the disc while keeping the ring potential at the constant 
potential at which ORR catalyzes on the ring (Anantharaj et al. 2016a). Thus, the Faradaic efficiency 
is estimated by 
FE = (I
r
 × nd
)/(I
d
 × nr
 × Nempirical)
where Id
, I
r
, nd
, and nr
 are disc current, ring current, number of electrons transferred at disc and ring, 
respectively. While measuring FE using RRDE, side reactions or another catalytic reaction may 
interfere, so one has to be attentive to avoid misinterpretation of the data and FE. An alternative 
method is by measuring the hydrogen and oxygen evolved by conventional water gas displacement 
method, gas chromatography, spectroscopic techniques for OER, and by the data interpretation 
based on the ideal gas equation. 
3.7 Mass and specific activities 
The mass activity is referred to an experimental current divided by the weight of the electrocatalysts 
measured in amperes per gram. It is an important property especially for making lightweight batteries 
or portable device energy sources. The specific activity of the catalyst is estimated by the current 
normalized with the real surface area of the electrocatalyst measured either electrochemically 
or through BET. However, the surface area measured by BET may not be completely active in 
electrocatalysis; thus, it is always preferable that specific activity is measured based on ECSA. 386 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
ECSA is estimated by the non-Faradaic capacitance, impedance spectroscopy, and from the charge 
measured from the redox peaks. In the case of Pt, and Pd, hydrogen adsorption-desorption, CO 
adsorption, etc., can also be useful for ECSA calculations. For estimating the figure of merit, ɳ10, 
geometric area is used and conventionally accepted for the catalytic efficiency measurements; 
however, for the real fundamental catalytic efficiency should be revealed based on the specific 
capacity.
4. Electrochemical water splitting summary until 2020
Several proposals have emerged in recent years through which various combinations of 
electrocatalysts have been evaluated in a half cell under equilibrium conditions (1 atm and 25ºC) 
to demonstrate that electron transfer in the OER and HER can occur at the surfaces with different 
chemical and morphological compositions. The noble metals like Pt, Pd, Au have been extensively 
studied and proved to be efficient electrocatalysts, the attempts to replace or reduce these high cost 
catalysts with the various combinations of transition metals and organic compounds is the topic of 
interest in the recent era. Even noble metal-based catalysts decorated on organic membranes have 
been tested as electrolyte within electrolyzers (Cruz et al. 2011a, Ornelas et al. 2009). 
Although bifunctional electrocatalysts have been reported, the ideal way is to evaluate materials 
for both processes separately due to differences in the reaction potentials and the conditions of the 
reactions themselves. It is important to recognize that although water oxidation can occur in both 
basic and acidic media, basic electrolytes are mostly used for their different advantages such as easy 
handling, anti-corrosion of materials, and high efficiency in oxidation processes.
4.1 Transition metals
Abundant availability, strong activity, economically cheap, and substantial electrocatalytic activities 
of transition metals make them an alternative to replace the noble EWS electrocatalysts. They are 
explored preliminary towards HER in acidic and alkaline media. Some transition metals are superior 
to the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for EWS. Transition metals are in the forms of chalcogenides, 
phosphides, nitrides, carbides, and oxides. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are the utmost 
researched 2-dimentional material towards HER. Active edges, easy separation of 2D layers which 
increase surface area, the probability of altering the band gap of material, and easy to incorporate 
heteroatoms make it suitable for the EWS electrocatalysts. Co3
S4
 due to octahedron planes and 
adoptive spin states improve its OER catalysis, which increases as the number of nanosheets 
decreases. Atomic nanosheet of the Co3
S4
 is more active than the bulk (Liu et al. 2015). Transition 
metal selenides like NiSe2
, CoSe2
, or a combination of different transition metals and selenides 
show excellent HER catalysis due to very small intrinsic resistivity, the possibility of engineering 
by adjusting the stoichiometry of transition metals in the lattice (Huang et al. 2018a). Transition 
metal carbides (TMCs) reform the structure during the EWS (Peng et al. 2020). TMCs can be easily 
oxidized to form heterostructures such as CoSex
S2–x@Co(OH)2
 (Han et al. 2016). Transition metal 
phosphides (TMPs) are widely studied material in the full pH range including the neutral pH. Weak 
delocalization between transition metal and P facilitates H2
O adsorption and their decomposition. In 
addition, results by addition of two or more transition metals in the single-metal phosphides boost 
the electrocatalytic activities of TMPs (Shi and Zhang 2016, Li et al. 2018, Huang et al. 2018a). 
Transition metal nitrides, which are metallic in nature, encourage electrocatalysis towards EWS 
(Paquin et al. 2015). Transition metal oxides are poor in conductivity; however, the enormous oxygen 
vacancies generated by electrocatalytic reduction promotes the adsorption/desorption process in the 
HER (Luo et al. 2019). Therefore, transition metal oxides have a high rate of hydrogen production 
in acidic and neutral solutions (Peng et al. 2020). Electrocatalysts from the first line transition metal 
oxides and hydroxides show outstanding OER activity. Electrochemical Water Splitting 387
4.2 Transition metal complexes/Alloys/Heteroatoms for Pt-free HER
Fe exhibits relatively better HER catalysis with the overpotential around 260 mV at 10 mA cm –2. 
Also, its different alloys proved to be better catalyst than Fe, like using Co in the alloy has increased 
real surface area and decreased the overpotential (Cabello et al. 2017). Alloys with three and four 
metals have been reported with Fe varying its stoichiometric relationship Fe82B18, Fe80Si10B10, 
Fe60Co20Si10B10 alloys and investigated their catalytic activity in order to increase its stability 
and electrocatalysis towards HER in alkaline solution (Müller et al. 2014, Ďurovič et al. 2019). 
Alternative to iron, Co and its alloys are other materials used to replace Pt because of excellent 
electrical conductivity and durable catalysis (Subramania et al. 2007). Co-Mo and Co-Ni-Mo 
showed comparable results to the Fe (Laszczyńska and Szczygieł 2020). Hollow nanoparticles 
(Co-HNP) with catalytic activity at neutral pH (pH 7) keeping an overpotential of 85 mV at 10 mA 
cm–2 and 330 mV for 20 h at 150 mA cm–2 have been reported (Liu et al. 2016a). Another material 
and its respective alloys most used is Ni in medium alkaline, which depends on its morphology 
and surface area, supporting 217 mV, 180 mV, 275 mV at 10 mA cm–2 (Abbas et al. 2017, Hu et al. 
2019b). 
In addition to Ni in different structural configurations, it has been reported supported in reduced 
graphene oxide (rGO) obtaining an overpotential of 97 mV at 10 mA cm–2 with a durability time of 
30 days in alkaline conditions del Ni-foam (Gutic et al. 2019). While Ni alloys have been diverse 
to modify their catalytic properties, stability, and surface, NiAlMo powder on nickel sheet presents 
a low overpotential of 82 mV at 200 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec–1 (Razmjooei et al. 
2020). An interesting compound has been reported with different steps in its synthesis of MoNi4
/
MoO2
@Ni where it reports a low overpotential and a high stability time of 10 h (Zhang et al. 2017). 
The report on the synthesis of Ni-P-La was interesting due to its long stability up to 2000 h (Madram 
et al. 2020).
Other types of materials have been used combining a transition metal and a non-metal in order 
to replace noble metals to reduce costs, maintain catalytic activity and apply at a higher pH range. 
An example is the sulfides such as MoS2
 that presents catalytic activity at the edges of 2-D sheets in 
the acid medium for HER overpotential of 10 mA cm–2 around 180 mV (Lukowski et al. 2013). The 
compounds MoS2
 doped with heteroatom Co,O to form Co,O–MoS2
 resulted in a lower overpotential 
of 113 mV but under alkaline conditions (Cao et al. 2019). Meanwhile, the derivate of NiS, NiS2
, 
N2
S3
 have certain activity in the HER in alkaline and acidic conditions, and the performances are 
lower compared to molecules that do not contain precious metals or derivatives of Pt (Jiang et al. 
2016). On the other hand, with the addition of CoS2
 to the Ni crystal lattice, it gives it catalytic 
properties at a neutral pH with comparable results with respect to an alkaline and acid medium 
(Zheng et al. 2015). 
4.3 Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
MOFs are made by the metal nodes and organic linkers with the fabulous features of highly 
porous nature, which ultimately increases the surface area, makes it flexible, easy for structural 
modifications and so on. The micro and nano morphologies of MOFs have served as templates and 
also as precursors to manufacture numerous materials for OER. These types of materials are widely 
used in water oxidation, mainly due to the abundant triphasic surface regions that they have for 
the reaction to occur since their composition and structure ensure rapid transport of electrons and 
masses. MOFs are one of the alternatives against noble metals since they have four main benefits: 
(i) the alternate replication of organic molecules and metallic cores as active electrocatalytic sites 
improves the stability of metal active site; (ii) the crystalline structure of MOFs; (iii) an intrinsic 
porosity enhances exposure towards the metallic active site, which makes it more accessible and 388 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

feasible for the electrocatalysis; (iv) the adjustability of MOFs due to their easy structural tuning and 
hybridization with supplementary metals can boost its electrocatalysis towards EWS (Maleki 2016).
Variants of MOFs have been made, the most important being those that encompass the 
Fe group in their structure such as FeMOFs-SO3 spindle-like (Feng et al. 2020) and FeCo2
-MOF (Gu 
et al. 2020b) that showed Tafel slopes ca. 36.2 mV dec–1. The most widely used variants of these 
materials have been thin films with defined nanostructures such as Fe/NiBTC@NF thin layer (Wang 
et al. 2016), reported NiCo-UMOFNs ultra-thin nanosheets (Zhao et al. 2016) and NiFe-MOF-74 
Rhombic crystals (Xing et al. 2018) with low operating overpotentials. Other alternatives like FeNi￾MOF nanoflowers (Luoa19).
Several materials for electrocatalysis activity towards the HER have been studied, finding their 
strong influence on the Me-H junction that is expressed by the “volcano” plot, which can be searched 
as volcano-type reliance among the i
0
 or j
0
 and metal-hydrogen bond energy. Speaking of catalysts 
with electrocatalytic properties for HER, platinum has conventionally been used, but due to its high 
price it is not very profitable in industrial applications. One of the alternatives has been the use of 
Pt in addition to the other metals (Pt-M) such as Fe, Co, Ru, Cu, Au to reduce the mass of Pt with 
important results. MoPt2
 has presented an overpotential at 100 mA cm–2 of 210 mV (Stojić et al. 
2006) and with the addition of (Na-molybdate and tris(ethylenediamine)Co(III) chloride) which is 
reduced to 196 mV (Marčeta Kaninski et al. 2007). Pt-Ni combination also proved to be enhancing 
electrocatalytic activity (Zhang et al. 2019).
In the same way, supports with metals C, Mo or Ni have been used to increase their electroactive 
area. For example, the Pt with C (around 20 wt % more used) the overpotential is ca. 46 mV at 
10 mA cm–2 under alkaline medium (Zhang et al. 2019), with the Tafel slope change with electrolyte 
concentration of 180, 94 and 30 mV dec–1 for 0.01, 0.1 and 1 M KOH, respectively (Wang 
et al. 2019). Also, Pt deposited on the Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide has been reported overpotential 
of 101 mV at the 10 mA cm–2 (Anantharaj et al. 2017). N-Mo2
C has also been used as a support 
(Qiu et al. 2019) and the NiRu which has considerably improved accelerate water disassociation and 
the immobilization of Pt (Li et al. 2020). 390 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications

1. Introduction
Historically, nanotechnology has been adopted in various industrial fields such as microbiology, 
medicine, engineering, computer science, chemistry, and materials (Ho and Kjeang 2011, Gurrola 
et al. 2016, Francesko et al. 2018), which contributes to the improvement of the quality of life 
and greater welfare. Some of these industries are associated to the construction sector, for which 
it is important to focus on the demands of nanotechnology and nanomaterials that can stimulate 
the sector’s overall productivity. The developments and implementation of nanotechnology are 
promising in terms of improving traditional materials, making the construction industry benefit by 
opening a new vision of the materials needed to generate more sophisticated, innovative, modern 
and environmental-friendly constructions (Papadaki et al. 2018, Vishwakarma 2020). The growth of 
nanotechnology can be related to the development of nanomaterials with a wide variety of particles 
that can be used to generate both functional and structural properties in cement-based composites, 
such as cementitious structures with the ability to self-heal, improved mechanical properties, that 
are lighter, reduce heat transfer, and have high solar reflectance, with antibacterial and self-cleaning 
surfaces, with greater energy and environmental efficiency. Nanocoatings can also provide fire 
protection due to their insulating capabilities and protection against the phenomenon of corrosion 
of steel structures, either in structures exposed to the environment or as reinforcement of concrete 
(Askarian et al. 2019). In general, nanotechnology provides unique features for construction and 
building through a variety of applications (Spitzmiller et al. 2013, Huseien et al. 2019, Ardalan 
et al. 2020).

Besides, it is well known that the current development in the field of nanotechnology, and 
therefore in the increase in the use of nanomaterials, would not be viable without characterization 
through different analysis and identification techniques of materials, given that it is imperative 
to understand the relationship between the initial composition, which can be controlled, with the 
resulting structure and properties of a material designed at the nanoscale that can present a higher 
and unique performance. In terms of synthesis, the properties of these materials depend not only on 
the properties of the starting materials, but also on their morphology and interfacial characteristics, 
so their determination is very important.
2. Nanomaterials and applications in cementitious materials
One of the typical current barriers in cement and concrete research is the improvement of strength and 
durability properties; therefore, a key point required is the extension of the lifespan by modifying the 
traditional materials used in construction and building, and generating new mixtures that integrate 
other cementitious binder components with a low CO2
 footprint, such as geopolymers (Duxson et al.
2007, Juenger et al. 2011). The cement-based binder is the main active component of concrete used 
in most constructions and buildings, in addition to water and fine and coarse aggregates (Ardalan 
et al. 2020, Hatem Nawar 2021). Portland cement is a hydraulic binder made from ground ‘clinker’, 
which is obtained by firing to sintering, along with small amounts of calcium sulfate, and can also 
contain silicon-based or/and aluminous pozzolanic materials that in contact with water chemically 
react with calcium hydroxide (Ardalan et al. 2017, Askarian et al. 2019, Motahari et al. 2019). 
In this regard, and in order to save energy, as well as to reduce the carbon emissions generated 
in the cement manufacturing process, industrial by-products called supplementary cementitious 
materials (SCM) have been used, incorporating them either as additions or as partial substitution of 
cement, improving their rheological, mechanical and durability properties through their hydraulic 
or pozzolanic activity in the same way (Siddique and Khan 2011). 
Between the cement and the aggregates used to produce cement-based composites, such as 
mortars and concretes, there is an Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), which is the area most prone 
to the generation of cracks and/or voids filled with air on a nanometric scale that can significantly 
affect the mechanical properties of the composite (Qudoos et al. 2018). There is a fairly wide field 
for the improvement of cementitious composites, such as mortars and concretes, by incorporating 
nanomaterials within the cementitious matrix (Reches 2018). In this sense, nanoparticles improve 
the microstructural properties of concrete, since they intervene in the formation of hydration 
products and/or fill the existing voids, achieving a more closed packing to the aggregates’ surface 
in the ITZ (Scrivener et al. 2004, Nazari and Riahi 2011). The hydration process between the 
aggregates and the cementitious paste is improved, helping to dissipate the growth of cracks and/
or to enhance the sealing effect, improving toughness and resistance to bending (Wang et al. 2020). 
Some nanoparticles also help accelerate cement hydration and can inhibit the growth of Ca(OH)2
crystals, generating more quantity (Arefi and Rezaei-Zarchi 2012). 
The aggregates’ characteristics, in terms of shape, texture and gradation, notably influence the 
properties of fresh concrete such as workability, cohesiveness, segregation, among others; they can 
directly affect the strength of concrete as well as its durability in the hardened state (Alexander and 
Mindess 2005). It has been reported that the shape of the aggregates does not affect the strength of 
concrete in the hardened state, but significantly influences workability (León and Ramírez 2010). 
For its part, the texture has a significant influence on the ITZ—a rough surface produces higher 
microhardness values in the area closest to the aggregate surface and decreases as it distances 
(Qudoos et al. 2018). In turn, porosity tends to decrease near the aggregates’ surface as the surface 
roughness increases and, in addition, concretes made with coarse aggregates with rough surfaces 
present an improvement in mechanical properties as well as compressive and tensile strength, elastic 
modulus and Poisson’s ratio (Hong et al. 2014). It has also been reported that aggregates produced 398 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
with stratified sediments may vary in their characteristics, due to the conditions under which they 
consolidate (Chan Yam et al. 2003). 
Several studies have focused on the mechanical response of concrete and durability, to the 
addition of different nanostructured materials (nanotubes, nanofibers, nanoparticles) and SCM, 
for which, various reinforcement mechanisms have been proposed focusing on the ITZ and its 
characterization by different methods. With the addition of nanoparticles such as silicon dioxide 
(SiO2
) and titanium dioxide (TiO2
), it has been confirmed that the hydration products of the 
cementitious paste and the durability of concrete are improved, which is attributed to different 
mechanisms such as nucleation sites and/or fill effect (Meng et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2018). 
Ren et al. evaluated the influence of the addition of SiO2
 and TiO2
 nanoparticles, in different 
percentages, on the compressive strength of concretes in the curing stages of 3, 7, 21 and 28 days 
of curing. They determined that the optimum percentage of addition was 3% by weight of cement 
and that both type of nanoparticles improved the compressive strength at 28 days of curing. The 
TiO2
 nanoparticles do not contribute to the formation of the C-S-H gel; however, they can fill the 
pores in the C-S-H gel and also help to control the growth of C-H crystals at the interface between 
the aggregate and the cementing paste. For their part, the SiO2
 nanoparticles react with the C-H to 
form C-S-H; both contribute to the obtention of denser concrete and better mechanical properties 
(Ren et al. 2018).
On the contrary, Meng et al. assessed the influence of 5 and 10% of TiO2
 nanoparticles on the 
flexural and compression strength of cement-based mortars at 1, 3, 7 and 28 days. They reported that 
the mechanical properties of mortars added with TiO2
 nanoparticles increased at early stages and 
decreased at 28 days; they indicated that this was due to a variation in the orientation of the crystal 
C-H by nucleation effect, and not by an increase in its amount. However, by adding slag powders 
to the same mixtures, these consume the C-H during the hydration process, helping to improve 
compressive strength at late stages (Meng et al. 2012).
Wang et al. evaluated the influence of the addition of different nanostructured materials or nano￾fillers, such as nano-SiO2
, nano-TiO2
, nano-ZrO2
, both non-functionalized and functionalized multi￾walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), carbon nanotubes covered with nickel, multilayer graphenes 
(MLGs) and boron nano-nitride, on the bond strength and microstructural development between the 
cementitious paste and the aggregates. They determined that all the added nanomaterials helped in the 
improvement of the ITZ hydration and compaction products. Nanostructured materials, for example 
0D nanoparticles, can form structures called core-shell and inhibit the growth of cracks (pinning 
effect), and 1D and 2D can bridge the hydration products generated in the ITZ and in the bulk of the 
cementitious matrix, thus avoiding the appearance and development of cracks (Wang et al. 2020). 
Only if the bonding in the matrix is controlled, substantial mechanical reinforcement can occur 
at the various scales of the material (Stynoski et al. 2015). The nano-core effect was proposed by 
Han et al., which integrates the core effect with the nano effect and it is closely linked to the intrinsic 
properties of nano-fillers, and to the composition and processing of cementitious composites 
(Han et al. 2017b). On the other hand, the influence of nanoparticles on the mechanical response 
of Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC) has also been assessed, which is an ultra-high-performance 
concrete. It has been reported that bending, compression and splitting strength were increased after 
28 days of curing in RPC with the addition of ZrO2
 nanoparticles. The addition of this kind of 
nanoparticles did not interfere in the hydration process; however, it inhibited the growth space of 
C-H crystals by restricting their size and also reduced the crystal orientation, obtaining a denser 
microstructure than that of conventional RPC (Han et al. 2017a). Likewise, Wang et al. reported that 
the addition of TiO2
, SiO2
 and ZrO2
 nanoparticles improved the properties of wear resistance and 
resistance to chloride ion penetration, thus improving the microstructure of RPC (Wang et al. 2018).
As for mortars and concretes made with limestone aggregates, their initial and final properties 
both in fresh and hardened state may differ when compared to composites made with natural sand 
of siliceous origin. The demand for water is increased due to the higher degree of absorption, so Nanomaterials Applied in the Construction Industry 399
in practice an overdose of cement could be needed to achieve the desired strengths. The effect 
of the addition of ZrO2
 nanoparticles has also been evaluated in cementitious composites made 
with limestone aggregates and it has been reported that the reinforcement in mortars added with 
this kind of nanoparticles was attributed to the nucleation sites generated by the nanoparticles and 
the inhibition of the growth of C-H crystals in addition to the filler effect, with obtaining of a 
better microstructural development and a denser mortar, which was reflected in the increase in 
compressive strength, when compared to conventional mortar, proposing that the onset of failure of 
the composite occurred inside the limestone aggregate and not at the interface ITZ (Trejo-Arroyo 
et al. 2019).
Materials with photocatalytic properties have also been evaluated for cementitious composites 
that seek to develop a self-cleaning and/or inhibitory function of microorganisms such as fungi and 
bacteria generated mainly by the high humidity in the air, which are more prone in tropical climates 
and mostly grow in large exposed areas of cementing nature, specifically for the case of TiO2
and ZrO2
.
3. Nanomaterials used as coatings
In the last decade, the use of photocatalysts in concrete technology has been researched and 
developed with the integration of semiconductors in construction materials, with great promising 
benefits for good environmental quality, and applications have been expanding for self-cleaning 
facades, roads and pavements, conservation of stone-based architectural heritage, etc. However, 
there are still barriers, or a certain degree of skepticism, probably regarding its cost-benefit related 
to the efficiency of the photocatalyst. Photocatalysis is associated to NOX abatement, to mitigate the 
impact of airborne particles and nitrogen oxides that deteriorate air quality in urban environments 
and, as already mentioned, it provides self-cleaning, antimicrobial and water purifying capabilities 
(Chen and Poon 2009, Zhong and Haghighat 2015, Ganguly et al. 2018). The most researched and 
commercialized photocatalysts is TiO2
.
Research focused on the use of antimicrobial and antifungal materials in the form of surface 
coatings with stable and inhibitory capabilities is of great importance. In the literature, there is a 
large amount of information about the mechanisms of photocalytic activity and the self-cleaning 
effect, as well as research works focused on improving the photoactive effect in the visible light 
range by means of theoretical approaches, experimental methods, modeling of electronic structures, 
starting from the use of non-metals, mono-doped transition metals and co-doping, among others 
(Yan et al. 2013, Etacheri et al. 2015). In the same way, just as materials with improved photocatalytic 
properties have been developed, the implications on their durability properties must also be widely 
evaluated, as a function of the exposure time to the environment and under real working conditions.
Implementation of TiO2
 is a relatively new technology; its effect has been evaluated in 
cementitious composites when applied by different techniques, either in the form of coatings or 
directly integrated into the matrix in bulk. Mainly, the self-cleaning property is evaluated through 
the degradation of organic colorants such as Rhodamine B (Rh-B), methyl orange, methylene 
blue, among others, and the decontaminating effect in the air through the degradation of NOX, as 
mentioned above (Ramirez et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2015, Cerro-Prada et al. 2016). The use of TiO2
 as 
part of coatings for mortars or cement has been tested in different studies; these coatings are usually 
prepared in solutions based on water, alcohol or resins, starting with simple applications such as 
spray or brush, up to a little more specialized applications such as immersion, vacuum saturation 
or others (Folli et al. 2012, Guo et al. 2015, Atta-ur-Rehman et al. 2019). In the tests, the coatings 
have demonstrated photocalytic effectiveness in terms of self-cleaning and for air decontamination, 
they have a high degree of efficiency. Nevertheless, this is overshadowed by the low resistance 
offered by the coatings when exposed to wear and tear due to environmental exposure, for which the 400 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
photocalytic effectiveness is affected over time (Guo et al. 2015, 2016, Gherardi et al. 2016, Cerro￾Prada et al. 2018, Luo et al. 2020).
In 2009, Ruot et al. reported in their research the influence of the addition of TiO2
 in 
cementitious pastes (white cement) and mortars. The samples were cured and stored for 4 years 
at 23ºC and relative humidity of 55 ± 5%; they were tested for density, porosity, X-ray diffraction 
and degradation of a Rh-B solution (0.05 gL–1). In the results, it was stated that both the pastes and 
mortars with the addition of TiO2
 showed photocalytic abilities, which increased as the percentage 
of addition rose and, also, the porosity increased in the mortars when compared to that of the pastes 
(Ruot et al. 2009). In 2010, Ramirez et al., developed a study with TiO2
 classified into two groups: 
group 1—decorative cement, concrete slab, green plaster with limestone sand and white cement 
mortar with limestone sand; group 2—cellular cement and a cement slab with three finishes. Both 
groups were covered by immersion in different solutions. Both groups were exposed to a 3-phase 
attrition test; the first phase without abrasive process on the surface, the second phase under medium 
wear conditions, and the third phase under high wear conditions. The samples from the first group 
retained the highest amount of TiO2
 and presented good results in decontamination; however, the 
material that showed the greatest photocalytic effectiveness was cellular cement (Ramirez et al.
2010). Also, effectiveness of TiO2
 has been reported as a function of size, evaluating the effect of 
TiO2
 on a micrometric and nanometric scale on the anatase phase in cement mortar samples(Folli 
et al. 2012). The aesthetic durability was determined by the degradation of Rh-B dye in a solution 
and NOX decontamination tests were carried out. The results showed a greater photocalytic effect 
with TiO2
 at the nanometric scale that rised with the increase of the addition, which resulted in an 
effective strategy to achieve self-cleaning and air-decontaminating facades.
Yang et al., in their research, evaluated the photocatalytic activity of TiO2
 supported in siliceous 
aggregates as a substrate and mounted on a concrete surface, against the conventional method used, 
which is dispersion in a layer of surface mortar, depending on photon efficiency. They reported 
a considerable rise in the photocatalytic activity in these composites supported with TiO2
 when 
compared to the conventional method; however, they only presented a model to illustrate the impact 
in the air near the surface of the composites, but they did not predict the impact on air quality 
(Yang et al. 2018). 
Treatment of TiO2
 based on acids such as HNO3
 and H2
SO3
 is a method proposed by Paolini 
et al. to develop pigments for building materials with improved optical properties (Paolini et al.
2016). It has been pointed out in the literature that a pretreatment of TiO2
 nanoparticles, with 
different acids before being added to the selected construction material, can considerably improve 
their reflectance as well as maintain the photocatalytic activity for a longer time, that is, the energy 
and environmental efficiency of these self-cleaning materials can be improved (Paolini et al. 2018). 
The use of steel elements in the construction industry has been of great relevance, especially 
due to the great advantages that this material offers, such as high resistance, ductility and uniformity, 
which makes it suitable for building countless structures of different sizes and shapes (Brockenbrough 
and Merritt 2006, Aghayere and Vigil 2020). Despite these advantages, steel elements present 
problems in aggressive environments since they are prone to being affected by corrosion as well as 
being thermodynamically unstable. 
On the other hand, due to the great impact that corrosion has on the economy of industrialized 
countries, protection against corrosion has become a topic of primary relevance in the modern metal 
industry (Chang et al. 2012). Currently, it is possible to use several methods to control corrosion; 
however, in the construction industry the use of coatings made by electrodeposition and polymeric 
coatings stand out, due to easiness of application, especially when it comes to protecting large 
structures. Nonetheless, most of these, specifically the polymeric ones, tend to have low resistance 
to the penetration of corrosive solutions, which considerably reduces the protective action of the 
coating.Nanomaterials Applied in the Construction Industry 401
3.1 Electrodeposition 
One of the techniques for the production of coatings is electrodeposition, since it presents a useful 
and versatile option. The properties of the coatings obtained by this technique, such as hardness, 
resistance to wear and electrical resistivity, largely depend on particle size of the nanomaterial used 
for their manufacture. The materials most used for this technique are Zn, ZrO2
 and Ni. From this, 
it has been verified that when comparing coatings with Zn and ZrO2
, the latter acquires greater 
hardness and improvements in their anticorrosive properties (Vathsala and Venkatesha 2011). In 
this type of coatings, combinations of the most used materials with others, such as Zn with carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs) and Ni with CNTs, have also been made, for which electrochemical studies have 
shown that the union of these materials has improved resistance to corrosion of the compounds 
because, with the use of these nanomaterials, grain size is much smaller, which in turn covers the 
micro-holes of the surface in the metals, generating homogenization and making coatings strong and 
resistant to corrosion cracking (Praveen et al. 2007, Saji and Thomas 2007, Praveen and Venkatesha 
2009).
3.2 Organic Polymeric Coatings
Organic coatings can be defined as a relatively stable dispersion of one or more finely divided 
pigments in a well-tested solution that, when applied and dried, results in a film that forms a flexible 
and adherent barrier that protects against corrosion (Pons Frias 1984). The main components of this 
type of coatings are shown in Figure 1.
Despite the fact that these coatings form a protective barrier, most of them are usually porous 
to oxygen, water and chlorides, which favor the initiation of the corrosion process. In recent years, 
several options have been investigated that can help solve this problem and nanomaterials have been 
used to try to specifically improve chemical and mechanical properties. The use of nanoparticles 
Figure 1. Main components of an organic coating.402 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
in coatings has been able to effectively reduce the impact of corrosive environments due to the 
different properties they can improve, such as surface hardness, adhesion, drying time, barrier and 
tribological properties, to mention a few (Farag 2020). In addition to the above mentioned, coatings 
with nanomaterials allow adaptability on various surfaces, as well as reduction in maintenance 
costs. Specifically, for this type of coatings, the difference between the particle sizes is an important 
element to take into account, since it has been proven that smaller particle sizes translate into greater 
resistance to corrosion, due to reduction in the coating’s porosity, thus decreasing the passage of 
external agents (Aglan et al. 2007).
Among the nanomaterials that have been studied, there are epoxy coatings added with particles 
of SiO2
, Zn, Fe2
O3
, clays, TiO2
, silica, zirconium, graphene, CNTs, to name a few, whose use has 
considerably improved different properties of the coatings and, specifically, resistance to corrosion 
(Li et al. 2016). Of all the above, carbon nanomaterials stand out significantly. Specifically, 
CNTs are of particular interest due to the structural, mechanical, electrical and thermal properties 
to be incorporated in polymeric matrices (Osorio et al. 2008), because they can withstand high 
temperatures, abrasive conditions and corrosive environments (Harb et al. 2016). In coatings, it 
has been shown that the use of CNTs provides mechanical properties such as resistance, rigidity, 
strengthening of the adhesion and cohesion properties of the film, as well as the improvement of 
conductivity (Esposito et al. 2014); likewise, their ability to spread over large surfaces has made them 
an excellent material for use in functional coatings (De Volder et al. 2013). Coatings with presence of 
CNTs that have undergone impedance measurements have been shown to have a significant increase 
in their resistance to charge transfer(Aglan et al. 2007), which translates into an increase in corrosion 
resistance. Other options that have also been studied are the mixture of different nanomaterials; an 
example of this is the mixture of MWCNTs and Zn, which has been shown to delay reactions, 
reducing the passage of H2
O, O2
 and other pollutants towards the metal. This phenomenon can be 
attributed to the anticorrosive properties of Zn, which shows two protection mechanisms, cathodic 
protection and barrier protection that is reinforced by the inclusion of MWCNTs, Figure 2, since the 
use of these provides a physical barrier to the corrosive medium preventing pores from being active 
sites for metal dissolution (Praveen et al. 2007).
Figure 2. Schematic representation of coatings (a) coating barrier protection, film damage, (b) coating with nanomaterials, 
cathodic protection mechanism.
4. Nanomaterials characterization
Concrete is a reliable, durable, and strong building material, so it has not undergone many changes 
over the years. Nevertheless, with the properties exhibited by concrete components at the nanoscale 
and the interest in improving the properties of this material, nowadays, the incorporation of 
nanomaterials into the construction industry is a reality. In the case of CNTs, these are incorporated 
into concrete mixes to inhibit crack propagation and improve their mechanical and thermal response. 
On the other hand, the development of small sensors at the micro or nanometric scale, based on a Nanomaterials Applied in the Construction Industry 403
combination of CNT and polycarbonate that can be integrated into concrete structural elements, has 
also been reported, since when subjected to some gradient of stress, temperature, humidity, etc., they 
may register a transitory change in electrical conductivity as an indicator of some initial damage 
to the structure. Additionally, Fe2
O3
 nanoparticles can also be used as a means of reinforcement 
in concrete, generating a greater degree of packing in the construction elements (Lee et al. 2010). 
Thus, a number of nanomaterials have been used in the construction industry, so that today one of 
the most important challenges in the area of nanotechnology applied to construction is to understand 
the relationship between the initial composition, with the resulting structure and properties of a 
nanoscale engineered material that has unique performance. In this sense, the characterization of 
nanoparticles is important, since it is possible to obtain parameters that include surface area and 
porosity, shape and size, particle distribution, solubility, wettability, among others (Schmid 2011). 
The following can be used as characterization techniques.
4.1 SEM-EDS
In general, electron microscopy is one of the most effective tools for the characterization and 
investigation of nanostructures. Specifically, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has versatility 
in its various imaging modes, excellent spatial resolution, relative ease of imaging, and accessibility 
of associated spectroscopic and diffraction techniques. This technique is used to analyze the 
morphological, chemical and structural characteristics of materials at the micro and nanoscale due 
to its high resolution and integrated techniques. It is also equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray 
Spectroscopy (EDS) that is capable of identifying the elements of the periodic table. Chemical 
composition EDS can analyze concrete in its mineral phase, while SEM provides element analysis 
for morphology. The microstructure of cement is complex and, in many respects, it has not been 
quantitatively characterized. The main hydration product, hydrated calcium silicates (C-H-S), has a 
complex porous structure (Gallucci et al. 2013). SEM technique can be used to analyze cementitious 
composites such as mortar and concretes; it is generally necessary that the surfaces of the samples 
be totally parallel, on some occasions can be mirror polished, which depends on the analysis that is 
required. Different authors have used this technique to determine the penetration of chloride ions 
within concrete (Neville et al. 1995). By means of this technique, the characteristics of concrete can 
be evaluated. For example, microstructural development can be analyzed as a function of curing 
time; identify the formation of hydration products; analyze the ITZ between the surfaces of the 
aggregates and the cementitious matrix; pore formation, their distribution, porosity and reaction 
kinetics of different pozzolanic materials and the deterioration mechanism of the concrete (Villain 
and Thiery 2005, Tang et al. 2011, Islam et al. 2016). By analyzing backscattered electron images 
(BSE) of polished sections of concrete, it is possible to measure the ‘average’ microstructure in the 
ITZ (Scrivener et al. 2004).
4.2 TEM
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a tool used in various fields, including materials 
science and engineering. All types of materials can be analyzed at the nanoscale, in some cases at 
the atomic scale (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, HRTEM), which allows to 
directly determine the chemical, crystalline and electronic structure of a single nanocrystal. This 
technique, as in SEM, makes use of the interactions of the electron beam with the specimen. For the 
incident electrons to penetrate the sample, this must be very thin, around 5 to 10 nm. The thickness 
required for the analysis of the sample is a function of its density and elemental composition, 
as well as the desired resolution. In addition to being used for imaging, in a magnification range of 
103
 to 106
, TEM can also be used for the acquisition of electron diffraction patterns (Donald et al.
2000). With an electron beam finely focused on a selected area, information on the phases and/or 404 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
crystals in a concrete sample can be generated, as well as the finely fibrous morphology, typical of 
C-S-H, which is the main hydration product of cement Portland (Gallucci et al. 2013). 
4.3 AFM
An alternative and very useful technique for the analysis of cementitious composites is Atomic 
Force Microscopy (AFM). This technique allows the exploration of cementitious samples under 
ambient conditions, without being subjected to controlled atmospheres such as high vacuum as 
in SEM and TEM. Modifying the surface microstructure generated by high vacuum dehydration 
is avoided and the natural state of the hydrated cement can be analyzed (Papadakis et al. 1999). 
AFM is an exceptional technique not only because it generates high-resolution microstructure 
topography, but also because it combines the advantages of three-dimensional digital morphological 
information at room atmosphere, no vacuum requirements, real-time imaging during reaction, being 
able to observe, for example, the early stage of hydration of the hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) 
(Yang et al. 2003). To generate the magnified image, this technique uses a mechanical probe instead 
of using electron beams as in SEM or TEM (Mitchell et al. 1996). Using this technique, it is possible 
to study the hydration of cement in its natural environment in real time.
4.4 UV-Visible and microindentation
UV-VS is used for the detection of functional groups and qualitative and quantitative analysis. It uses 
electromagnetic radiation, the source of light is generally a Xenon lamp, since it provides a strong 
illumination, from the ultraviolet UV region, to near infrared NIR. When the wavelength emitted 
in that region corresponds to an energy level in which an electron is promoted to a higher orbital 
level, the energy is absorbed. The equipment determines the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed 
at a certain wavelength, and this wavelength is recorded as the one with the highest absorbance 
of ultraviolet light. This technique has been used to evaluate the reflectance of TiO2
 powders pre￾treated with different acids, as well as to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of paints containing 
pre-treated TiO2
 powders and to assess the degradation of Rh-B dye, which is representative of 
organic contaminants (Paolini et al. 2018).
For their part, microindentation and nanoindentation tests have been used to study the nano 
and micromechanical properties of cementitious composites, as well as the gradients in the main 
concrete phases, which are the bulk matrix and the ITZ. Wang et al. used the microhardness test as 
well as the backscattered electronic microscopy (BSEM) technique to study the mechanisms that 
influence the curing temperature of steam-cured concretes, which are used during the manufacture of 
precast components for high-speed railways; the hydrated cement paste as well as the ITZ between 
the cement paste and the aggregates were studied (Wang et al. 2019).
4.5 XRD
One of the most accurate and highly reproducible methods to identify the phases of nanomaterials 
within cement, concrete and cement pastes is the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique (Santillán 
et al. 2016). Amorphous phases in a material do not present narrow and intense reflections (peaks) 
as in the crystalline phases; on the other hand, they appear as bulge-like in a very wide range of 
the distance in 2theta on the diffractogram (L’Hôpital et al. 2016). When an X-ray beam falls on a 
crystal, it causes the atoms that make it up to scatter the incident wave in such a way that each one 
of them produces an interference phenomenon, where, for certain directions, the incidence will be 
destructive and, for others, it will be constructive, thus suggesting the phenomenon of diffraction. 
An X-ray diffractogram presents the intensity data as a function of the diffraction angle (2θ), obtaining 
a series of peaks (Kitano et al. 1987). The most important data obtained from a diffractogram are: Nanomaterials Applied in the Construction Industry 405
(a) Peak position expressed in θ, 2θ and distance values; (b) Peak intensity, the intensities can be 
taken as peak heights or, for work with more precise areas, as the calculation of average crystal 
sizes; (c) Peak profile. Although it is used less than the previous ones, the shape of the peaks also 
provides useful information about the analyzed sample.
XRD is important in the study of cementitious materials and/or cement-based composites 
such as concrete. Since this technique is capable of determining the composition of the phases 
in the development of the hydration process, as well as to define the crystallite size, the degree 
of crystallinity, and the orientation of the crystals, the phase changes as a function of time or 
temperature of cured. It also makes it possible to identify unknown materials or minerals, and the 
intensity of the peaks is compared to the standard JCPDS database. 
4.6 TGA-DSC
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)-Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA): this technique 
records all the thermal transitions of a material (enthalpy and melting temperature, etc.), 
simultaneously with the record of the weight change and the speed at which it occurs in the sample 
as a function of temperature and/or time. TGA of cement pastes, mortars and concretes allows to 
quantify the different compounds due to the decomposition that occurs in the temperature curves. The 
decomposition of pastes, mortars or concrete is divided into four processes: the first one associated 
with evaporable water in a temperature range of 20ºC to 110ºC; the second process, where water is 
lost from the hydrated calcium silicate gel (C-S-H) and from the minor phases of aluminates and 
sulfoaluminates from 120ºC to 400ºC; the third transformation corresponds to calcium hydroxide 
(Ca (OH)2
) between 410ºC–530ºC; finally, the decomposition process, between 550ºC and 950ºC, 
corresponding to the calcium carbonate (CaCO3
) present in the cementitious material and to that 
formed during carbonation, releasing CO2
 in the form of gas (Traversa et al. 2013). Differential 
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) techniques are based on the energy differences required to keep the 
sample and the reference at an identical temperature. The BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) method 
measures the specific surface area of the materials as well as the shape, volume and pore size 
distribution. This is important in engineering elements formed by cementitious composites as most 
present porous microstructures.
5. Electrochemical techniques as a tool for materials 
characterization in the construction industry
By means of electrochemical techniques, for example Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy 
(EIS), it is possible to characterize coatings or monitor corrosion phenomena, for example steel 
in reinforced concrete, since the microstructure of the material directly influences the transport 
properties. The pore network within the concrete structure serves as the ionic flow path, which is 
directly related to its conductivity. On the other hand, for the evaluation of the corrosion phenomenon 
and the determination of reaction rates, it is possible to use electrochemical techniques which, 
besides, can be used both in the field and in the laboratory. In comparison to the methods of weight 
loss and visual observation that are the most common to evaluate this process, electrochemistry 
offers advantages since the kinetics of corrosion can be quantitatively studied.
To perform electrochemical studies, it is necessary to use an electrochemical cell, which is a 
system composed of three electrodes and an electrolyte solution, which is described below: 
● Reference electrode: It is characterized by having a constant and known potential value; 
therefore, it allows to know at what potential the reduction or oxidation process studied occurs.
● Working electrode: The reaction of interest occurs in this electrode, that is, the reaction that is 
going to be the object of study.406 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
● Counter electrode: Electrode that is used only to make an electrical connection to the electrolyte, 
in order to be able to apply a current to the working electrode. Since the process that occurs 
on this electrode is not important, an inert material (noble metal or graphite) is usually used to 
avoid its dissolution. It is also known as an auxiliary electrode.
● Electrolytic solution: Solution that contains free ions, conductive of electric current.
Figure 3 represents the basic design of an electrochemical cell, as well as the equipment needed 
to obtain and process the information obtained in each electrochemical characterization technique.
In electrochemical techniques, an electrical signal is introduced into the system under study and 
information is obtained from it by analyzing the electrical response generated by this signal; with 
the same equipment, it is possible to perform different techniques and measurements, among which 
Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR), Tafel Analysis and EIS stand out.
LPR is a quick way to measure uniform corrosion rate. The technique uses small ranges of 
potential (relative to corrosion potential) applied to metal samples. Linear polarization measurements 
start at approximately –20 mV relative to corrosion potential (Ecorr) and end at + 20 mV relative to 
Ecorr, so the test is non-destructive. Graphically, the current values are represented as a function of 
the applied potential, but they can also be presented as polarization curves (Ecorr as a function of 
log i), Figure 4a, since in this way the values of the Tafel slopes can be obtained, which are used 
to calculate the corrosion current density (i
corr), Figure 4b. The i
corr value is related to the resistance 
to polarization and high results of this indicate that the corrosion rate of a material is high, and the 
values of i
corr are calculated by means of the Equation 1.1 developed in 1957 by Stern and Geary.
i
corr = 
βa
 βc
2.303 Rp
 (βa + βc
) (1)
where, i
corr is the corrosion current density in A/cm2
, Rp
 is the corrosion resistance in ohm*cm2
, 
βa y βc are the Tafel slopes in V/decade or in mV/decade of current density.
The materials that are susceptible to be evaluated by this method must be placed in conductive 
electrolytes and be free of resistive films, since it is an inclusive technique that globalizes all resistive 
contributions and does not manage to discriminate them. When dealing with highly resistive systems, 
the use of EIS is recommended.
As already mentioned, EIS is an electrochemical method used in corrosion studies. Specifically 
for coatings, it is possible to study both the deterioration and the stability of these due to the action 
of an electrolyte and the increase in the corrosion rate of the substrate, either due to the damage 
of the coating or due to the attack of the electrolyte (Olaya-Flores and Torres-Luque 2012). The 
most widely used technique is the application of a small signal of potential E to an electrode and its 
response in current (i) at different frequencies is measured. However, under certain circumstances, it 
is possible to apply a small current signal and measure the response of the system’s potential. Thus, 
the electronic equipment processes the measurements of potential—time and current—displaying 
the outcomes in a series of impedance values corresponding to each studied frequency. This 
relationship of impedance and frequency values is called the ‘impedance spectrum’. Impedance 
spectra are usually analyzed using electrical circuits, made up of resistors (R), capacitances (C), 
inductances (L), etc., components representing some physical phenomenon of the corrosive process 
of the studied material, providing valuable information about these and their variation in relation to 
the immersion time.
There are two ways to graphically represent the impedance results obtained from an EIS test: 
(1) Nyquist diagram: where the imaginary part multiplied by –1 (–Z’’) is represented, compared to 
the real part (Z’). It is the most widely used representation system and the information obtained 
from it is based on the form that spectra take. Nanomaterials Applied in the Construction Industry 407

equipment.
Figure 4. (a) Ecorr polarization curve as a function of log i, (b) Representation of the calculation of the Tafel slopes, obtention 
of i
corr and Ecorr.
(2) Bode diagrams: where the logarithm of the impedance modulus (log│Z│/ohm) and the phase 
angle are represented as a function of the logarithm of the frequency. The information obtained 
from this type of representation is aimed mainly at performance as a function of frequency.408 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
As shown in Figure 5, Nyquist diagrams are the most used, since by means of them it is possible 
to quickly identify different parameters. For example, from the cuts with the real axis, it is possible 
to obtain the electrical resistance of the working electrolyte (Rs), and the resistance to charge 
transfer (Rtc), which is related to the resistance of the film that the coating offers; finally, from 
the value of the frequency at the maximum point, it is possible to calculate the capacitance of the 
electrochemical double layer (Cp) that is associated to the insulation property that a coating may 
have (Zoski 2007, Frankel 2016). 
6. Conclusions
Despite the undoubted contribution of the construction industry, both throughout history and to this 
day, to the configuration of the World, this industry remains among the main concerns regarding its 
impact on climate change and sustainability. Therefore, one of the most important challenges in this 
industry is the search for environmental-friendly materials, especially when it is taken into account 
that two of the most widely used materials, not only in construction activities but when compared 
with any other type of activity, are cement and steel, which are also major contributors to global 
warming.
In response to the above mentioned, the addition of nanomaterials to essential construction 
materials has shown to improve their fundamental properties, such as strength and durability, which 
allows the use of less materials, a longer useful life and fewer maintenance needs. The application 
of nanomaterials in construction materials has proved to improve mechanical properties, energy 
efficiency, heat transfer, self-cleaning features and corrosion, among others.
The research avenues for the use of nanomaterials in this field continue to offer great 
opportunities for advancement, not only in terms of fundamental technical aspects, but also in 
terms of applicability under real working conditions and of economic-environmental cost benefit 
assessment when compared against other constructive alternatives.

1. Introduction: Life is Tissue
The world around us is a space fraught with dangers: no one is exempt from suffering unexpected 
accidents and therefore physical trauma. Roughly, 1.3 million people die every year on the highways 
worldwide and 50 million people suffer nonfatal injuries because of motor vehicle accidents (Salam 
2017). In addition, everyday life is plagued by other dangers such as acute and chronic diseases like 
metabolic syndrome, kidney failure, or acute myocardial infarction (Perrone-Filardi et al. 2015, 
Raikou and Gavriil 2018). The consequences of these coronary and metabolic diseases could lead 
to the loss of a limb or the latest epidemic, heart failure, currently affecting 5 million Americans 
(Wang et al. 2014). The need for organ transplants in patients is increasing alarmingly across the 
world, while the previous demand for transplants has never been satisfied (Nguan 2012). Also, 
the loss of limbs in accidents due to high-energy trauma or vascular metabolic disorders leads to 
a decrease in the quality of life of patients, increasing co-morbidity. In the United States, around 
135,000 amputations are performed each year (not counting war casualties) (James and Laurencin 
2015). It is expected that 3.6 million people in the same country will be living with limb loss by 
2050 (Ziegler-Graham et al. 2008). 
Because of the growing demand and suffering in this type of patient, cybernetics, nanomedicine, 
and robotics have come to the rescue in an interesting fusion with synthetic biology, artificial 
intelligence (Delgado and Porcar 2013) and bionics-microsurgery to improve the classic prostheses 
that current medicine offers (Aman et al. 2019). Under this new paradigm, the patient who has lost a 
limb can have an intelligent prosthesis with nano-sensors, able to detect even touch (Touch BionicsTM) 
(Schweitzer et al. 2018), which allows the patient in her or his new “every-day-cyborg-status” 
(Quigley and Ayihongbe 2018) to live without any physical disability, enabling integration back into 
regular life (Aman et al. 2019).

2. Nano-bionics and nano-cybernetics
Nano-electronic devices are currently used in the aeronautical and aerospace industry (Zhang 
et al. 2017b) as well as in biomedical applications (nano-bioelectronics) (Dai et al. 2018). These 
nanomaterials have improved and increased optoelectronic properties compared to micrometric 
scale materials (Jeevanandam et al. 2018). Thus, electromagnetic devices such as microchips have 
potential for optimization as well. In addition, the classic results of electronic transport and heat 
transfer such as Fourier’s law or Stefan-Boltzmann’s law change at the nanoscale, representing 
unique properties, which could enhance medical devices and are suitable for several applications 
(Salata 2004). Therefore, nanoelectronics has found great applications in bionics (Wallace et al. 
2012), which is the science that studies the creation and development of technological procedures 
that help the natural functions of living beings (Vincent et al. 2006). As an example, bionic 
engineering helps improve the impaired functions of biological systems through the creation of 
prostheses (Sensky 1980, Williams and Walter 2015), artificial organs such as synthetic exo-bionic 
cardiac valve replacements (Ashrafian et al. 2010), brain-computer interfaces (BCI) (Shih et al. 
2012), and artificial retinas (Bloch et al. 2019), etc.
It is logical that nano-electronic devices are part of the scrutiny of cybernetics, which is the 
science that studies system theories of communication and autonomous control in living beings 
and machines (Vasil’ev 2013). Nanocircuits are currently being integrated into bionics and into 
the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology, creating outstanding promise not 
only in the field of microsurgery and smart biomimetic prostheses for those patients who have 
lost a limb (Williams and Walter 2015) but also in biomedical devices to study metabolic diseases 
(Yun et al. 2009). Nano-cybernetics will be necessary to understand the dynamic processes that 
occur at nanoscale. 
Electronic devices have been continuously reducing in size as Moore’s law predicted. The 
latest developments in technology such as valleytronic devices (Peng et al. 2017) and quantum 
computers (Solenov et al. 2018) are playing an important role in miniaturization. Consequently, 
the latest advances could increase the feasibility of electrode-cellular interface technologies, which 
are currently able to transfer information across nanostructured materials to create interactions 
with living systems such as cells or tissue (Wallace et al. 2012). These human-machine interface 
technologies can initially be built in 2D and then integrated into a 3D printed scaffold (Kong et al. 
2019). Applications include not only integrated 3D biomimetic prostheses compatible with human 
tissue without undesired effects such as scar tissue or inflammation, but also smart organ-on-a-chip 
systems for real time theragnostic information (Esch et al. 2015) and superior neural interfaces 
(Kumar et al. 2017).
Biomechanics incorporates nano-bionics and nano-cybernetics modeling to predict patients’ 
experiences in real scenarios; this so-called 4D modeling can predict how nanomaterials and 
nanodevices for in vitro tissue engineering (Devillard et al. 2018) will behave under hard conditions 
such as heat, rain, pressure, and daily life impact through months and years. The nano-electronic 
device applications that can benefit from this modeling are biosensors, bio-actuators, tissue 
engineering and bio-robotics (Ashammakhi et al. 2018a). It is expected that a smart prosthesis using 
these technologies can readapt and readjust itself, giving the patient intuitive proportional control 
and sensing by using artificial intelligence-tacit learning systems and computer machine learning 
(Oyama et al. 2016) to deal with unexpected weather changes or other unpredictable scenarios. 
3. Brain-computer interface (BCI) implants
BCI research has demonstrated to be particularly important for the next generation of advanced 
prostheses where subjects will have neuro-prosthetic myoelectrical control through the thought 
processes (Lee et al. 2009). A BCI is a computer system able to analyze, record and interpret The Era of Human-Machine Hybrid: Medical Advances in Biomimetic Devices 415
brain signals, such as the voltage produced by the ion-gated channels in the neuronal postsynaptic 
membrane, and decodify those signals by detecting movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) 
and relaying them to an output device which acts as a bridge between cell tissue (neurons) and 
electronic devices (robotic arms, hardware, etc.) (Jeong et al. 2015). Early studies in monkeys 
revealed in the 1960s the promises of BCIs to move objects through decodified brain cortical 
signaling (Fetz 1969). By 2006, a disabled patient with C3-C4 cervical injury had received a BCI 
micro-implant inserted into the primary motor cortex. As a result, the BCI system allowed the 
patient to have prosthetic hand neural control (Hochberg et al. 2006). Moreover, BCI has been used 
to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal cord injury (Shih et al. 2012).
Current BCIs have been created as an effort to solve the challenges regarding the necessary 
precision to fuse living cell tissue (microglia, astrocytes or cardio-myocytes) (Dai et al. 2018) with 
a nano-electronic chip-interface (Dai et al. 2016). Unfortunately, stimulation and sensing can cause 
inflammation by immune system activation; therefore, innocuous nano-materials are being explored 
with enhanced biomimetic electronic properties better able to avoid immunological response (Tian 
et al. 2012). Thus, the nano brain-implant histocompatibility is now more suitable for the brain’s 
architecture (Kim et al. 2018).
4. Advanced smart prosthesis (ASP)
Some of the applications of BCI technology are: 1. Neurofeedback rehabilitation, 2. The treatment 
of neuromuscular disorders, and 3. The rehabilitation of quadriplegia and tetraplegia (Huggins 
et al. 2017). BCIs are essential components of advanced smart prostheses (ASP) (Muller-Putz and 
Pfurtscheller 2008). Unlike conventional prostheses, an ASP must be integrated with a sophisticated 
electronic-BCI supported by Artificial Intelligence to decode the brain activity (Bouton et al. 2016). 
Thus, an ASP is an adaptable dynamic device, which allows patient’s environmental temporal￾space control (Gao et al. 2003). In this context, the patient’s intention signals (the thoughts) are the 
equivalent of a software. These thoughts (neuron activity) must have a strong correlation with the 
intention of the user; that is why electroencephalogram (EEG) devices are used to discard noise 
such as electromyographic signals or residual signaling. Subsequently, a BCI transforms the useful 
intentioned electrical activity such as the thoughts of a tetraplegic patient to restore hand-grasp 
function to an output command able to execute the order (Pfurtscheller et al. 2003). Therefore, 
translated algorithms allow the user to manipulate hardware such as a wheelchair (Galan et al. 
2008), or smart prosthesis (Muller-Putz et al. 2005) such as a bionic arm or leg; See Figure 1.
However, BCIs must be implanted in the patient through surgery to create a successful bond 
with the ASP, and there is always an electronic materials immune system rejection risk (Murphy 
et al. 2015). Since nano-electronic devices have greater surface capacity for ion exchange or 
electrical signal detection (Timko et al. 2010) and are also more histo-compatible, they could be the 
key to solve current microelectronic device problems such as inflammation and infection (Kwong 
et al. 2011, Rezaei et al. 2019). There are numerous reviews where nano-electronic devices have 
been successfully inserted into cortical neurons without dramatic activation of the immune system 
response (Timko et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2007). Nevertheless, current work is aimed towards ASPs 
operating by using non-invasive methods (Gao et al. 2003) such as external electrodes and nano￾sensors, conferring to the self-transcending human-machine hybrids dependence and autonomy.
5. Organ-on-a-chip transplant
The greatest ever scientific breakthrough in the field of therapeutics of different pathologies is 
the development of Organ-on-a-chip that biomimetically simulates human organs outside 
the body. Organ-on-a-chip is a novel technology that simulates the physiological conditions 
(pH, temperature, cationic proteins, function, homeostasis, metabolism), mechanics and biochemistry 416 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
of a specific organ (heart, kidney, pancreas) on a chip (Rothbauer et al. 2019). This kind of chip has 
many applications in the area of medical investigation; some examples of these applications are the 
comprehension of tissues metabolism, fabrication of different kinds of tissue models to completely 
replace animal models, the study of drug effects in terms of toxicity as well as cure, and organ 
transplantation research (Sosa-Hernandez et al. 2018). The donation of organs has increased over 
time, but there are still not enough for all the people who need it. 
Ashammakhi et al. (Ashammakhi et al. 2018b) introduced artificially developed organ￾supporting devices and machineries that are integrated with an array of organ-on-a-chip platforms. 
Such machineries will be useful in supporting organs externally for increased efficiency of the 
organs so that they become functional and are ready for transplantation for better outcomes. 
Figure 1. Mechanism of the ASP. (A) Neuron electrical activity is measured by using (B) EEG channel multiplexed 
recordings. The signals (brain waves) are codified by a BCI to algorithms, so then (C) the patient’s thoughts can be translated 
to commands of intention to operate hardware such as bionic devices and advanced smart biomimetic prostheses.

Scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as NSF-funded Synthetic 
Biology Engineering Research Center (Synberc), innovated a technique to program human stem 
cells towards the development of a desired tissue using an organ-on-a-chip platform. This will be 
a new technique introduced for transplant patients. The tissues grown from the patient’s own stem 
cells will reduce the risk of their immune systems, while there will also be no need to wait for donors 
for a long time (Beckwitt et al. 2018). 
Mayo Clinic researchers are engineering the liver-on-a-chip; toxic substances trigger liver 
fibrosis and hepatic insufficiency. What is intended is to use systems where various types of cells 
can be cultured within microfluidic compartments. These microfluidic devices allow to recreate 
real and dynamic mycourse that simulate the signaling interactions between the different groups 
of cells that are studied (Zhou et al. 2015). Currently, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) 
are allowing scientist to create highly specialized organs (organ-on-a-chip) by understanding the 
dynamic cell environment (Sun et al. 2019). The applications for this technology are ideal for the 
study and evaluation of drug medication (Osaki et al. 2018), pharmacokinetics (PK), median lethal 
dose, etc. (Pasqualini et al. 2017).
The chips can simulate the cellular microenvironment (Esch et al. 2015) (including chemical 
mediators, metabolites, biological molecules, etc.) (Sackmann et al. 2014) in order to replicate 
organ function. Interestingly, these chips can connect to each other building the so-called 
multi-organ-on-a-chip system (for example lung organ-on-a-chip connected to heart organ-on-a￾chip) so then, “in vitro” models (unreal compared to an “in vivo” system) would be obsolete, 
allowing scientists to dismiss animal models for metabolic studies. 
Current work has been done integrating carbon electrodes to offer an accurate controllable 
physiological mechanical condition to create cardiac patches for both replacement of cardiac tissues 
and the creation of heart-on-a-chip (Xiao et al. 2014) for research purposes. Other organ-on-a-chip 
models available are: vessel-on-a-chip, liver-on-a-chip, kidney-on-a-chip and a novel microfluidic 
device fabricated by Shamloo and coworkers called neuron-on-a-chip (An et al. 2015). Chief 
organ-on-a-chip advantages are: (1) They emulate the real conditions of the organism (presence of 
macrophages, nutrients, hormones, myeloperoxidases, hydrolases and drug permeability). (2) They 
dispense of the necessity to sacrifice animals, which do not correctly simulate human organisms. 
The main disadvantage is that, like biomimetic limbs, they are still quite expensive.
Recently, Dr. Anthony Atala and his team from Harvard University carried out a successful 
transplant of a bladder cultivated from the patient’s cells. All of these advances in regenerative 
medicine and cell tissue 3D bioprinting can save the lives of patients who cannot wait for an organ 
donation, a serious problem in contemporary health care systems (Atala 2016, Pincock 2011). 
Despite MEMS (Whitesides 2006), biomimetic tissue structures made by 3-D printing 
(Yi et al. 2017) and organ-on-a-chip being still in their infancy, it is expected that in the future, 
medical scientists and researchers will base their experimental models on these devices or, perhaps 
physicians may begin transplanting bionic human organs at hospitals soon. 
6. Transhumanism
Transhumanism is a contemporary quasi‐medical ideology (McNamee and Edwards 2006), a 
cultural, sociopolitical, and intellectual trend that supports not only the use of current technology 
to improve the beauty, lifespan, and resistance to disease in human beings, but also cutting-edge 
technologies, such as nanotechnology, genetics (Bostrom 2003), artificial organs, robotics (Zeilig 
et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2017a), cybernetics, quantum computing, synthetic biology and neurological 
chips that allow linking human brains to computers (BCI) (Daly and Huggins 2015), to radically 
modify both the human body and mind (McNamee and Edwards 2006). 
Numerous papers describe this progressive technological trend, and The Journal of Medicine 
and Philosophy has nurtured the debate between bio-conservatives and transhumanists concerning 418 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
ethics in genetic engineering, memory and thought transfection. The manuscript entitled “Human 
Mind Control of Rat Cyborg’s Continuous Locomotion with Wireless Brain-to-Brain Interface” 
discusses thought to thought transfection ideas (Zhang et al. 2019).
A social problem often associated with the emergence of transhumanism is its inevitable effect 
on social equality—the rich will have access to these technologies, but the poor will most likely 
be excluded. Contemporary plastic surgery is an example of this same situation: people who can 
afford a surgical procedure to look more beautiful or healthy can increase their chances to obtain 
a job. Another modern example is the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms, which can act as 
biological markers to predict an individual’s risk of developing human eye disorders (Shastry 2009), 
susceptibility to environmental factors such as toxins, and response to medications and drugs, all of 
which provide the user who can afford the treatment with advantages against illness compared to 
those who cannot pay. In a transhumanist future, rich people could secure an artificial heart (Cook 
et al. 2015), an artificial lung (Wrenn et al. 2018), and exoskeletons (Cerasa et al. 2018) for physical 
therapy or to replace lost limbs, whereas the poor would die long before being able to afford the 
technology.
We are already living the benefits and consequences of transhumanism. Failing to acknowledge 
this fact would be equivalent to denying the opportunity of using a robotic prosthesis or a pacemaker 
to a patient who needs it.
7. Cyborgs among us
Unlike a robot, which is entirely machine, a cyborg is a human hybrid who has machine devices 
integrated into her or his biological body (Lapum et al. 2012). There is a collection of ten essays 
written between 1978 and 1989 exploring the cyborg ideology based on concept, definition, 
classification, ethics, morality and philosophy. One of these essays is a controversial manuscript 
published by Haraway in 1985 (Haddow et al. 2015) which considers these ideas in a construct 
entitled The Cyborg Manifesto. The manifesto describes a world with a realistic cyber-society, and 
found a deep resonance with those who, by that time, were already living with devices surgically 
implanted for medical therapy. Currently, devices such as exoskeletons are being used to rehabilitate 
people (Fukaya et al. 2017), even in extreme cases such as spinal cord injury (Kandilakis and Sasso￾Lance 2019), while other electronic devices such as brain implants, electronic pacemakers, bionic 
limbs, organ-on-a-chip, drug implant systems and artificial retina are not only a reality but also, 
usually the only resource to keep alive or restore those patients with a status known as “Everyday 
Cyborg” (Haddow et al. 2015). 
Nevertheless, even when there are serious technical and ethical aspects to be solved, BCIs 
(Ngan et al. 2019), actuators and bionic devices are still promising extraordinary applications in 
healthcare (Kogel et al. 2019). A few years ago, the Hugh M. Herr team tested and compared a 
passive prosthesis versus a bionic ankle prosthesis to provide enhanced joint position and torque 
control in a patient who suffers from a traumatic transtibial amputation (Rouse et al. 2015). The 
results were outstanding: kinetics and kinematics were enhanced in comparison with passive 
prosthesis and the patient was able to dance rumba by using an advanced bionic ankle prosthesis. 
However, biomimetic prostheses must still be customized for a given task that requires fine 
movements, torque or a certain impedance. Depending on the part of the body, the physical forces 
need to be calculated and then engineered into the prosthesis motor-actuators (Pasquina et al. 2015). In 
2018, researchers successfully developed a novel biomimetic robotic elbow joint using calculations 
performed through Monte Carlo software; new applications due to this achievement range from a 
humanoid arm to rehabilitation (Cui et al. 2018). In a different study, researchers developed a myo￾electrically robotic prosthesis for a patient who had suffered a transradial amputation (Stillfried et al. 
2018). On this occasion, the team successfully designed a customized robotic limb able to play the 
drums since the patient is a musician. Finally, Elon Musk NeuralinkTM brain interface technologiesThe Era of Human-Machine Hybrid: Medical Advances in Biomimetic Devices 419
are under exhaustive-ongoing clinical trials, not only for the restoration of sensory and motor 
function in patients but also for human brain integration with artificial intelligence software (Musk 
and Neuralink 2019).
8. Artificial intelligence at the service of an emerging 
transhuman society
AI applications range from marketing to healthcare, but our interest in this document focuses on AI 
for medical applications such as drug development (Fujiwara et al. 2018) and biomimetic devices 
(Winkler 2017). The same as with autonomous cars, a biomimetic device which works with AI 
should be able to make the user feel as comfortable as possible. A very common syndrome after 
losing a limb is the so-called phantom limb syndrome (Chahine and Kanazi 2007), where patients 
experience sensations in a limb that does not exist anymore. An ideal machine learning AI-ASP, 
integrated into the patient’s neurological network, would modulate the BCI signals so the patient 
would feel a prosthesis as familiar as if the bionic limb were a natural limb (Valeriani et al. 2019).
A trans-human society also demands novel methods to fight pandemics such as SARS-CoV-2 
COVID-19, and other viral diseases such as hepatitis C and Dengue virus. Since viruses have the 
capacity to be so mutable and modify their DNA or RNA, it is difficult to develop antivirals to 
keep pace with their constant structure modifications. An AI machine learning software can select 
novel molecules that could be found in antineoplastic drugs by searching at digital drug library. 
Consequently, AI identifies chemical structure activity through design and process algorithms to 
develop novel antivirals (Stebbing et al. 2020). In addition, scientists are using AI to target protein￾receptor bonds by developing powerful and novel synthetic antibiotics (Zoffmann et al. 2019).
9. New technocracy paradigms: Risks and perspectives
Adaptation processes between human-machine EEG-ASP-BCI have successfully advanced in the 
last years (Tariq et al. 2018). However, there are some concerns regarding security. For example, the 
integration of other devices such as phones, cameras, weapons, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc., could make 
a prosthesis vulnerable to hacking (Landhuis 2016); criminals could take control of the bionic arm 
and execute a crime. The idea exists in nature, the Dicrocoelium dendriticum fungus species hacks 
ants’ (Formica fusca) navigational skills (Libersat et al. 2018). Protecting robotic limbs or bionic 
devices from hackers will be an additional challenge for cyberpolice, since brain-hacking leads to 
the manipulation of neural information (Lenca 2016). A new technocracy will have to accept or 
not the risk, benefits and consequences of a new every-day-cyborg-status (Quigley and Ayihongbe 
2018). Self-transcending human-machine hybrids could be endowed with enhanced military-grade 
enhancements such as strength or superior hand-eye coordination; thus, they could displace non￾cyborg humans from employ possibilities, just like what is happening nowadays with robots in 
factories. 
Current times have indicated that future human evolution will be by “human direction” instead 
of natural direction. Quantum computing-artificial intelligence working together with the BCI 
neuralinkTM can modify the human brain, enabling it to connect to the internet and other machines 
(“Human-robotic interfaces to shape the future of prosthetics,” 2019). Therefore, cyborg-transhuman 
rights will also be required for a user’s privacy policy as well as ontological (Lapum et al. 2012) 
and moral support (Quigley and Ayihongbe 2018). The creation of new laws will be necessary, and 
a global service support for technological maintenance as well. 
The future could sound ominous, but the possibilities are infinite: from a future without 
disabilities to the next generation of an amazing degree-provided human-machines much better 420 Nanochemistry: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications
adapted to explore and colonize extraterrestrial space. Maybe we could say a modern babel tower 
is in progress.
