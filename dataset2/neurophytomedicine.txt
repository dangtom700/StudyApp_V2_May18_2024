NeuroPhytomedicine
Neurological disorders categorized as neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and 
neurotraumatic impose a substantial health burden and cause a frail impact on life 
attributes. The use of synthetic drugs can have undesirable side effects, making neu￾rotherapeutics challenging. Research on neuroprotection aiming for the utilization of 
safer natural compounds; phytochemicals specifically – is a cutting-edge approach. 
NeuroPhytomedicine intends to present readers with a wide-ranging and state-of￾the-art appearance at the beneficial properties of phytochemicals on various neuro￾logical ailments.
It additionally contains sections explaining:
• Applications of phyto-nanotechnology in neurological ailments,
• Phytoconstituents related deep learning and machine learning-based solu￾tions for neurological disorders,
• Epigenetic relevance pertaining to modulation by phytochemicals.
The goal of NeuroPhytomedicine is to give readers a thorough and up-to-date look at 
how phytochemicals affect the brain and neurological illnesses in a way that is help￾ful for research scholars, academicians, scientists, neuroscientists, physicians, and 
researchers from the pharmaceutical industry.NeuroPhytomedicine

Preface
Neurological disorders categorized as neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and neu￾rotraumatic impose a substantial health burden and cause a frail impact on the life 
attributes. Neuronal cell damage occurring from oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
other molecular etiologies contributes to various chronic and acute neurological ail￾ments. The tactics involved in neurotherapeutics are complex and challenging and 
bear a shortcoming of side effects of synthetic chemicals. Research on neuropro￾tection aiming utilization of safer natural compounds, phytochemicals specifically, 
is a cutting-edge approach. Phytochemicals are known to exhibit various biologi￾cal activities in humans and are naturally found in plants, herbs, vegetables, and 
edible fruits. Alkaloids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, phytosterols, saponins, terpenes, 
polyphenols, etc., are the phytochemicals known to have neuroprotective efficacy. 
The molecular mechanisms behind the curative effects of phytoconstituents rely 
largely on subsiding oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and signal transduction 
related with protein folding. However, the particular molecular mechanisms con￾nected with advantageous effects of phytochemicals still continue as a matter of 
quest.“NeuroPhytomedicine” intends to present readers with a wide-ranging and 
state-of-the-art appearance at the beneficial properties of phytochemicals on the 
neurodegenerative (Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.), neuropsychiatric (anxiety, seizures, cognitive 
deficit, palsies, addictions, depression, etc.), and neurotraumatic (traumatic brain 
injury, cerebral ischemia, etc.) ailments. A recent advancement in the discovery of 
phytochemicals as neuro-protectives, their mechanism of action, study on semisyn￾thetic derivatives, and their conventional and nanotechnology-based formulations 
has been presented. This comprehension will be helpful to neuroscientists, physi￾cians, ethnopharmacologists, and researchers in understanding the neuroprotection 
by natural plant-derived compounds.xix

Phytochemicals
Recent Trends Pertaining 
to Beneficial Effects on 
Neurological Disorders
Sonam Pandey
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The prevalence in chronic degenerative diseases in the past few decades has 
prompted a stronger emphasis on the environmental variables that contribute to 
their origin and progression. A neuronal cell disorder known as neurodegenera￾tive disease (ND) is characterised by protein accumulation, oxidative stress (OS), 
hereditary predispositions, and viral infections. Loss of neurons can cause memory 
loss, motor impairments, and problems with the central and peripheral nervous sys￾tems’ ability to function. Neuronal degeneration has an effect on a patient’s social 
network, family, and quality of life. The most common NDs are Alzheimer’s dis￾ease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Paramanick et al, 2022). AD accounts for 
roughly 60%–70% of the approximately 50 million people worldwide who suffer 
from dementia, which is a major cause of neurological damage and dependency 
among the elderly. More than ten million people worldwide suffer from PD, and the 
prevalence rises with age. Other NDs include multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington’s 
disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and stroke-induced secondary 
neurodegeneration (SND). Neurological diseases are the largest cause of disability￾adjusted life years and the second major cause of mortality worldwide. The names of 
the diseases labelled in honour of distinguished physicians, subtyping according to 
pathological and clinical findings, overlapping histopathological classification, and 
numerous molecular discoveries all obscure a basic understanding of the diseases 
and may obstruct carefully targeted research into the pathogenesis and new drug 
discovery for NDs (Masaru et al, 2020).
The past decade has also seen an increase in interest in herbal medications, which 
include phytochemical components that may have long-term health-promoting 
or therapeutic effects. In addition, many medicinal plants have specific medici￾nal effects and can be utilised temporarily or permanently to treat a variety of 
health issues. Phytochemicals abundant in vegetables and fruits are considered to 
minimise the risk of a wide range of serious medical conditions, including car￾diovascular disease, cancer, and neurological disorders (Lobo et al, 2010; Selvam, 
2008). Numerous medications have been developed to date for the prevention and 
12 NeuroPhytomedicine
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), but the quest still persists (Raj 
et al, 2020).
Hence, there is a significant demand for new therapies and medications for treat￾ing and preventing these disorders. Currently, scientists are focusing on using bioac￾tive substances derived from natural sources to target the pathophysiology of disease. 
The major NDs are covered in detail in this chapter, along with potential therapeutic 
targets, therapeutic plants, and bioactive substances that can be used to treat NDs.
This chapter was accomplished by utilising an electronic search of existing lit￾erature, with PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Research Gate, and Scopus, 
as the major sources for relevant review papers, books and randomised clinical 
trials published in the recent 5 years on the use of ethnomedicinal plants to treat 
various neurological diseases. Reference lists from the most recent reviews were 
used, as well as additional primary literature sources and references provided by 
relevant articles.
1.2 GLOBAL BURDEN OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
In the world, neurological disorders are the primary cause of disability and the sec￾ond greatest cause of mortality. The absolute number of deaths and persons with 
disabilities caused by neurological disorders has increased significantly over the 
past 30 years, notably in low- and middle-income nations, and further increases are 
projected globally as a result of population expansion and ageing. The burden of 
neurological disorders-related mortality and disability is rapidly being recognised 
as a global public health concern, and this burden is expected to rise over the next 
few decades. Despite declines in infectious neurological illnesses, the absolute num￾ber of deaths has climbed by 39% over the past 30 years, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), the sum of years of life lost and years lived with impairment 
have increased by 15%. The burden is greater in low- and middle-income coun￾tries (LMICs). Therefore, estimates of the burden of neurological disorders and the 
factors influencing variations in that burden across various populations and nations 
are required on a regular basis by funders and policymakers. Such estimates would 
allow for resource allocation and cost-efficient planning for healthcare, as well as 
evaluations of the effects of effective policy actions. Additionally, understanding 
how sociodemographic shifts (for instance, at the national level) affect neurological 
illnesses and general population health is necessary to set priorities for research and 
the development of healthcare services, as well as to guide policy (Feigin et al, 2019).
Traditionally, epidemiological examinations of neurological disorders have been 
limited to specific disorders (e.g., stroke and dementia) or geographical areas (e.g., 
district, city, and region), database settings (e.g., official reports, mortality or hos￾pitalisation statistics) or demographics (e.g., specific ethnicities or age groups). 
Comparisons between studies are complicated by differences in study designs, 
methodology, diagnostic criteria, and case ascertainment completeness. The Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2 seeks to address 
these issues in the most systematic, comprehensive, and consistent manner possi￾ble. Metrics of the worldwide, regional income (e.g., LMICs or HICs), and national 
(and in some cases subnational) burden of neurological illnesses are available for Phytochemicals 3
195 nations, organised by age, gender, and time (Roth et al, 2018). The GBD global, 
regional, and national estimates of the burden of neurological disorders, risk factors, 
and trends should be used by funding organisations and policymakers to establish 
priority areas for healthcare and research as well as to advance prevention, manage￾ment, service, and workforce development (Dorsey et al, 2018).
According to the GBD findings, neurology services should be a top priority for 
healthcare systems, and epidemiological monitoring (observational and experimen￾tal) studies, the evaluation of preventive and disease-modifying interventions, and 
translational studies should be top priorities for research funding organisations. 
Future GBD estimates and other epidemiological studies will be crucial for pro￾viding regular updates and evaluation of the burden of neurological disorders at 
different levels, which will be crucial for determining the appropriate allocation 
of resources, improving existing policies, and developing new ones (Valery et al, 
2019, 2020).
As stated in the December 2017 UN General Assembly report, progress in low￾ering the burden of NCDs, including neurological illnesses, is insufficient to reach 
the UN Sustainable Development Goals targets by 2030 (Feigin et al, 2019). Global, 
national, and regional neurological and disease-specific organisations, such as the 
World Federation of Neurology, the World Stroke Organization, and Alzheimer’s 
International, must work together with the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
gain the momentum needed to confront this expanding problem (Carroll, 2017). At 
all ages and levels of human activity, brain health is one of humanity’s most valu￾able resources.
1.3 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF NDs
A set of pathologies known as NDDs, including AD, PD, and HD, are characterised 
by various etiologies with specific pathophysiological and morphological aspects. 
Multifactorial conditions such as OS and production of free radicals, protein mis￾folding with impaired protein aggregation and degradation, exposure to pesticides 
and metal toxicity, altered bioenergetics, and mitochondrial dysfunction can all 
contribute to the development of these disorders (Küpeli et al, 2021). A common 
pathognomonic finding of the brain regions reflecting damage and dysfunction of the 
related motor, autonomic, and/or cognitive nervous systems is neurodegeneration, 
which is the structural and/or functional loss of neurons in the central nervous sys￾tem (CNS) (Gerez and Riek, 2020). The post-mortem brain specimens’ neurodegen￾erative lesions and the results of structural and functional imaging tests are highly 
correlated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography 
(PET) may be used to identify afflicted domains and diagnose disorders using the 
regional patterns of brain shrinkage (Shimizu et al, 2018).
There has been huge progress in identifying the primary factors that trigger neu￾ronal damage in several NDDs, including AD, PD, MS, ALS, and HD, over the past 
few years. Preventing neuronal damage and death will offer a significant clinical 
advantage (Solanki et al, 2015).
NDs’ molecular approaches highlight intriguing elements of their pathogenesis. 
The basic causes of neurodegeneration appear to be aberrant protein processing, 4 NeuroPhytomedicine
genetic diseases, misfolding and aggregation of different proteins, activating cel￾lular apoptosis, triggering mitochondrial failure, free radical production, and OS 
(Rekatsina et al, 2020). A summary of the pathophysiology of NDs and the role of 
neuroprotectors are shown in Figure 1.1.
NDDs are currently incurable and are rapidly increasing mortality and morbidity 
rates in industrialised nations, with a similar situation projected in poorer countries. 
In the twenty-first century, the major health issues are neuropsychiatric and neuro￾logical disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, AD, PD, HD, ALS, 
cerebrovascular impairment, seizure disorders, and head injuries, as well as other 
systemic disorders such as cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and 
many others (Hussain et al, 2018).
A brief overview of NDs and their development is helpful in comprehending the 
therapeutic approaches and will be discussed.
1.3.1 Alzheimer’s Disease
AD is one of the most prominent NDDs, characterised by the progressive degra￾dation of memory, learning, and other cognitive skills, as well as the production 
of disoriented plaques and neurofibrillary masses, which result in severe neuronal 
death. The most prominent component of senile plaques, amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), is 
FIGURE 1.1 Mechanism involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and 
neuroprotectors.Phytochemicals 5
primarily implicated in the development of AD (Schmitt et al, 2014). AD has been 
associated to neurofibrillary tangles of intracellular tau and extracellular deposits 
of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain. Plaque formations have been associated to 
OS, which may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. This disease is also 
considered as a short-term memory loss (Rekatsina et al, 2020).
1.3.2 Parkinson’s Disease
PD is an irreversible, progressive neurological disease that affects around 1% of 
adults over the age of 50 years. It is commonly linked to dementia. The patient loses 
50%–70% of all dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra as PD advances. With 
the loss of dopaminergic fibres in the brain, the patient has progressively increasing 
motor symptoms, which are a hallmark of PD. Growing research has linked PD 
pathogenesis to both OS and immunological alterations. As reactive oxygen species 
and other free radicals collect, they overwhelm dopaminergic neurons and cause 
them to degenerate, establishing the foundation for PD pathogenesis.
A number of potential contributors to PD have been identified in the disease pro￾cess, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, α-synuclein, and dopamine. 
It appears that their interactions, rather than their individual actions, contribute to 
progressive neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation may be necessary in the patho￾genesis of PD because it damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. This, 
in turn, causes the brain’s glial cells (mostly microglia and astrocytes) to release 
a variety of soluble substances that may be pro-inflammatory and/or neurotoxic 
(Rekatsina et al, 2020).
1.3.3 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
ALS is characterised by the irreversible degeneration of motor neurons in the cere￾bral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord (National Institute of Neurological Disorders 
and Stroke, 2017). The majority of people diagnosed with this syndrome die within 
3–4 years of onset of symptoms (D’Amico et al, 2013). The world-renowned 
physicist Stephen Hawking is an exception, having lived for more than 50 years 
after being diagnosed with ALS. ALS, as the name implies, is characterised by 
muscular atrophy (amyotrophic) and spinal cord scarring (lateral sclerosis). ALS 
patients experience increasing paralysis, dysphagia, and respiratory insufficiency 
(Malaspina et al, 2015). ALS is considered to be caused by one or more of the 
150 mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) antioxidant system (Hooten 
et al, 2015), which induce motor neuron damage and death as well as mitochon￾drial malfunction (Li et al, 2011). The SOD1 mutation causes protein misfolding 
(D’Amico et al, 2013).
1.3.4 Huntington’s Disease
HD is the most frequent hereditary cause of chorea and is also known as 
Huntington’s chorea, chorea major or simply HD. This incurable neurodegenerative 6 NeuroPhytomedicine
condition was named after George Huntington, an American physician who 
precisely described it in 1872. Prevalence per country can be as high as seven 
individuals per 100,000 (in populations of Western European ancestry) and can 
be much higher in specialised areas. Physical symptoms can appear at any age; 
however, the average age of onset is 35–44 years old. When beginning occurs 
before the age of 20, the disorder is characterised as juvenile HD (also known 
as akinetic-rigid HD or Westphal variant HD), which advances faster and has 
slightly different symptoms.
The disease’s mechanism is unknown, but a variety of factors have been iden￾tified. A Huntingtin gene mutation results in the creation of the mutant protein 
huntingtin, which causes cell and macroscopical alterations in the brain. There 
is no cure for HD; however, there are therapies available to alleviate some of its 
symptoms. Chora, or jerky, erratic, and uncontrollable movements are the most 
common initial physical signs. As the condition worsens, rigidity and dystonia 
become more noticeable, eventually becoming the major physical symptoms 
(Sandhya et al, 2010).
1.3.5 Multiple Sclerosis
MS is a CNS autoimmune disease that causes severe disability and healthcare costs. 
MS is a chronic neurological disease marked by inflammation and demyelination. 
The destruction of the nerves’ myelin sheaths, as well as axonal damage and glial 
scarring, causes the disease’s characteristic symptoms of muscular spasms, neu￾ropathic pain, paralysis, and visual neuritis. An inflammatory state is promoted 
throughout this process, mostly by myelin antigen-specific TH cells. Monocytes are 
recruited as lesions appear, producing reactive oxygen species. Demyelination and 
neurodegeneration may result in the presence of oxidised lipids in myelin mem￾branes, apoptotic oligodendrocytes, and neuronal axons, according to observations 
of white matter and cerebral cortex lesions (Rekatsina et al, 2020).
1.4 MEDICAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR 
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
In terms of basic principles, treatment options for neurological disorders are iden￾tical to non-comorbid patients, with the exception that pharmaceutical interac￾tions require particular vigilance (Antony, 2001). There are several therapeutic 
methods available, including pharmaceutical treatments, cognitive behavioural 
therapy, somatic interventions, and electroconvulsive therapy (Gorman, 1996). 
Some of the therapies indicated aim to improve both anxiety and depression at 
the same time, while others are unique to the individual disease. Anxiolytic drugs 
such as benzodiazepines are normally started for a short amount of time to ease 
anxiety, but they are only used as a last resort due to their unfavourable influence 
on cognitive disorders in AD and balance problems in PD (El-Guebaly et al, 
2010). Oral antidepressant therapy may have several limitations, such as drug 
interactions, limited tolerance owing to side effects, and low efficacy (Santarsieri 
and Schwartz, 2015).Phytochemicals 7
1.5 NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL PLANTS
Despite significant improvements in the causal mechanisms that trigger certain 
NDDs, no therapies that benefit patients with these diseases are often available. 
Because most NDs appear late and remain asymptomatic for the majority of 
their progression, medications beginning in advanced stages of the disease are 
of limited benefit to patients. If therapy begins early in the disease’s course, it 
may be feasible to significantly slow or stop disease progression. By lowering or 
even removing the original stressor, such therapies have the potential to restore 
neuronal function. Phytoconstituents are key molecules in the creation of a new 
generation of therapeutically effective treatment medicines for NDDs. Herbal sup￾plements have been linked to a lower risk of NDs when consumed on a regular 
basis (Solanki et al, 2015).
There are several prominent traditional Indian plants that can be used to treat 
neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Ayurvedic Rasayana medi￾cations are abundant in anti-oxidants and immunomodulatory active ingredients. 
Since the majority of diseases are triggered by a disruption in the delicate balance 
of oxidants and antioxidants, the ability to scavenge free radicals or activate cellular 
oxidant defences can be considered as their primary mechanism of action. Many 
plants, including Ashwagandha, Brahmi, Mandukaparni, Shankapushpi, Vacha, 
Jatamansi, and Jyotshmati, belong to the category of Rasayana plants. These herbs 
are categorised as brain tonics or rejuvenators since they are specifically formulated 
for brain tissues (Farooqui and Farooqui, 2017).
Some ayurvedic herbs like Guduchi, Yashtimadhuk, Padma (Nelumbo nucifera), 
Vacha, Convolvulus pluricaulis, Shankhpushpi, Pancha‑Tikta‑Ghruta Gugguli, 
Amalaki, Musta Arjun, Amalaki, Ashwagandha, Galo Satva, Kutaj, and others are 
excellent herbs for slowing down the brain cell degeneration caused by Alzheimer’s. 
They enhance the brain’s ability to function, and therefore, provide stability when 
used consistently.
1.5.1 Crocus sativus
Crocus sativus L (C. sativus), widely known as saffron, is a member of the Crocoideae
superfamily and is farmed in various countries including Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, 
and Spain (Abdullaev, 1993). Saffron contains more than 150 different substances, 
including carbohydrates, polypeptides, lipids, water, minerals, and vitamins. 
Crocins, a family of red-coloured and water-soluble carotenoids that are all glyco￾sides of crocetin, are the major physiologically active constituents of saffron. Saffron 
also contains four major bioactive components: Crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and 
safranal (Bathaie and Mousavi, 2010).
C. sativus is used to treat cognitive disorders in Iranian, as a traditional medicine. 
C. sativus components have recently been used to treat various neurological disor￾ders and to relax smooth muscle (Hosseinzadeh et al, 2007; Khazdair et al, 2015; 
Mokhtari-Zaer et al, 2015). Saffron extract has been shown to have anticonvulsant 
and anti-Alzheimer effects in both human and animal models (Khazdair et al, 2015). 
The efficacy of C. sativus in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in clinical 8 NeuroPhytomedicine
trial research, as well as its influence on brain neurotransmitter concentrations and 
interaction with the opioid system, was discussed (Khazdair et al, 2015). C. sativus
and its major component, crocin, have strong antioxidant properties via lowering 
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (Karimi et al, 2010; Tamaddonfard et al, 2013).
1.5.2 Nigella sativa
The annual herb Nigella sativa L., also known as N. sativa, is a member of the 
Ranunculaceae family and is commonly grown in the Mediterranean region as well 
as in Western Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Oil, protein, glucose, and 
fibre are all chemical components of N. sativa seeds. Linoleic acid, oleic acid, pal￾mitic acid, arachidic acid, eicosadienoic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, and myris￾tic acid are the chemical components of N. sativa’s fixed oil (El-Tahir and Bakeet, 
2006). N. sativa enhanced scopolamine e-induced learning and memory deficits in 
rats while also decreasing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and OS in the brain 
(Hosseini et al, 2015). In the other clinical trial, 40 healthy volunteers were ran￾domly assigned to either N. sativa (500 mg) or placebo (500 mg) capsules twice a day 
for 9 weeks. In comparison to the placebo group, N. sativa improved memory, atten￾tion, and cognition (Sayeed et al, 2013). After 4 weeks, N. sativa (500 mg) reduced 
anxiety, stabilised mood, and modulated cognition in a human model (Sayeed et al, 
2014). The neuroprotective effects of N. sativa and thymoquinone (TQ) (its main 
components) on a variety of nervous system illnesses such as AD, epilepsy, and neu￾rotoxicity have been studied (Khazdair, 2015).
1.5.3 Bacopa Monniera (Brahmi)
Since ancient times, Brahmi (Bacopa monniera; family: Scrophularaceae) has been 
particularly known as a brain tonic for reviving intellect, an anti-stress remedy for 
anxiety, and a way to improve cognitive abilities. According to prior research, this 
medicinal herb can be used to treat neurological and mental diseases since it oper￾ates as a nervine and a mental tonic (Thakur et al, 2018).
1.5.4 Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha)
A member of the Solanaceae family, ashwagandha is a shrub by the botanical name 
of Withania somnifera. It is classified as an adaptogen – a non-toxic stimulant that 
normalises physiological processes in response to prolonged stress by activating the 
immunological and endocrine systems. By extending its neurite outgrowth, ashwa￾gandha may help in the repair of broken neural circuits (Thakur et al, 2018).
1.5.5 Centella asiatica (Mandookaparni)
Centella asiatica, a plant in the family Apiaceae, is known as gotu kola or man￾dookaparni (Umbelliferae). It has been used to enhance focus, improve memory, 
and increase alertness. It is a psychotropic medicinal herb that is employed in 
the treatment of stress and anxiety. It has been used to boost the nervous system, Phytochemicals 9
revive youth, and improve memory. It has been applied to memory improvement 
(Thakur et al, 2018).
1.5.6 Santalum album (Chandan)
Chandan (Santalum album) is a member of the Santalaceae family. This plant has 
the potential to enhance memory and cognitive function (as described in Siddha). 
Licorice has a considerable memory-enhancing activity and promotes learning and 
memory in scopolamine-induced dementia (Thakur et al, 2018).
1.5.7 Curcuma Longa (Haldi)
Curcuma longa (Haldi) is utilised to treat the majority of chronic disorders, includ￾ing neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, autoimmune, and neoplastic 
diseases. Curcumin is an herbal medicine with therapeutic potential in AD. The 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crossed by curcumin, which also prevents the develop￾ment of A plaques, the elimination of Aβ fibrils that have already formed, and inhib￾its the extension of those fibrils. Curcumin therapy has a higher therapeutic impact 
on AD and can restore the distorted neuritic morphology that is observed close to 
plaques (Thakur et al, 2018).
Curcumin’s therapeutic potential for NDs has piqued the curiosity of many research￾ers in recent years (Fu et al, 2015). According to Kulkarni, curcumin water-soluble 
extract can increase dopamine, norepinephrine, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine levels in the 
CNS (Kulkarni et al, 2012). Curcumin derived from Curcuma longa has been shown 
in cell culture and animal models to prevent PD, reactive oxygen species production, 
apoptosis, platelet aggregation, cytokine production, cyclooxygenase enzyme activity, 
brain oxidative damage, and cognitive impairments (Yang et al, 2005, 2014).
1.5.8 Ferula Assafoetida (Asafoetida)
Asafoetida (F. assafoetida L.) is a plant in the Apiaceae family that grows from 
the exudates of the plant’s living beneath rhizome or tap roots. In Iran, F. assa‑
foetida, also known as gum-resin, is known as “Anghouzeh,” “Khorakoma,” and 
“Anguzakoma.” In India and Nepal, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a 
spice in many dishes (Iranshahy and Iranshahi, 2011).
According to scientific data, F. asafoetida resin could be able to inhibit the mono￾amine oxidase B (MAO-B) enzyme and be used to treat NDs including Parkinson’s 
and Alzheimer’s (Zarmouh et al, 2016). Meanwhile, AChE inhibition by F. asafoe‑
tida has been demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo on the neurological system of 
the snail. According to researchers, the ability of F. asafoetida to improve memory 
may be due to its ability to suppress AChE in rat brain tissue (Kumar et al, 2009).
1.5.9 Thymus vulgaris (Thyme)
Thymus vulgaris (T. vulgaris) is a plant in the Lamiaceae family that is strongly aro￾matic. This plant has roughly 38 species and is found in subtropical areas. T. vulgaris10 NeuroPhytomedicine
is mostly composed of phenols, thymol (40%) and carvacrol (15%). During the 
winter, it has lower levels of phenol. The essential oil also contains thymol methyl 
ether (2%), cineol, cymen, pinene, borneol, and esters (Azaz et al, 2004). The neu￾roprotective and ameliorative benefits of thymol, a bioactive monoterpene derived 
from T. vulgaris, on amyloid β or scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in 
rats have recently been reported (Deng et al, 2015). Researchers believe that thy￾mol’s neuroprotective benefits are due to its potential effect on gamma-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA)-mediated regulation of synaptic transmission (Marin et al, 2011). 
Meanwhile, scientists discovered that 1-Methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene isolated from 
Thymus vulgaris might influence cholinergic function by increasing synaptic acetyl￾choline (Ach) and nicotinic Ach receptor activity (Sammi et al, 2016).
1.5.10 Coriandrum sativum (Coriander)
Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is a parsley family annual herb (Apiaceae). 
In Persian, this plant is known as Geshniz. Coriandrum sativum (C. sativum) is a 
Mediterranean native that is widely grown all across the world (Lawrence, 1993; 
Small, 1997). C. sativum was frequently used as a digestive agent in folk medicine. 
C. sativum seed extract has antibacterial and antirheumatoid properties and has been 
used in lotions and shampoos (Yusuf et al, 1994). The plant’s seeds and leaves have 
been shown to have antioxidant, diuretic, cholesterol-lowering, anxiolytic, sedative￾hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties. Furthermore, as the major component of 
coriander, linalool has a variety of neuropharmacological actions, including anti￾anxiety, sedative, anticonvulsant, and anti-disease Alzheimer’s activity (Hosseini 
et al, 2021).
1.5.11 Shankhpushpi
Shankhpushpi is broadly categorised as a “Medhya Rasayana” in Ayurveda, which 
means a medication that rejuvenates, preserves, and enhances intellect and memory. 
Four botanicals, Canscora decussata Schult. (CD) (Gentianaceae), Clitorea ternatea 
Linn. (CT) (Leguminosae), Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy. (CP) (Convulvulaceae),
and Evolvulus alsinoides Linn. (EA) (Convulvulaceae), are referred Shankhpushpi 
by Indian practitioners. The findings support the traditional usage of Shankhpushpi 
for its neuropharmacological activity and have significant implications for its appli￾cation in the prevention and treatment of memory and CNS dysfunctions (Sethiya 
et al, 2019).
1.5.12 Angelica Archangelica L. (Umbelliferae)
Angelica archangelica L., also known as Dudhachoraa (Laghu Coraka), contains 
several compounds that show similar activity to AD medications. These compounds 
do not produce the same adverse effects as medicines do, such as nausea, stomach 
ache, insomnia, and so on. Angelica archangelica contains phytochemicals that can 
enhance blood flow to the brain. According to one study, the chloromethane subfrac￾tion of a methanol extract inhibits AChE in vitro (Singhal et al, 2012).Phytochemicals 11
1.5.13 Melissa officinalis L. (Lamiaceae)
M. officinalis extract can improve memory in both healthy and scopolamine-induced 
rats. These effects of M. officinalis extract could be linked to the AChE-inhibitory 
activity identified in this investigation or to the previous research findings of nico￾tinic receptor activity, while other mechanisms of action could also be implicated. 
This extract’s memory-enhancing effect via the cholinergic system, as well as its 
high antioxidant activity, make it a potential for AD treatment (Soodi et al, 2014).
1.5.14 Commiphora Whighitti (Burseraceae)
Commiphora whighitti (Guggulu), a plant resin, includes guggulsterone, the main 
ingredient of guggulipid. The guggulipid has been shown to be a possible cogni￾tive enhancer for memory improvement in scopolamineinduced memory deficits 
(Lannert and Hoyer, 1998). Commiphora whighitti affects on learning and memory 
impairment as well as decreased choline acetylcholine esterase levels in the hippo￾campus. However, C. whighitti has the greatest impact on memory functioning and 
the risk of dementia (Rubio et al, 2011).
1.5.15 Glycyrrhiza glabra (Fabaceae)
AD is described by neuronal death and the formation of extracellular senile plaques, 
the main component of which is Aβ. In this study, we looked at the effects of a 
licorice water extract (Yashtimadhuka) on Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. 
The findings show that licorice water extract protects against apoptotic neuronal cell 
death caused by Aβ fragments. Licorice root extract has been found to treat or even 
prevent brain cell loss in disorders such as Alzheimer’s and its related symptoms 
(Bilge and Ilkay, 2005).
1.6 NANODRUG DELIVERY OF NATURAL COMPOUNDS
Over the past few decades, there has been a lot of interest in the nanotechnology 
approach to disease treatment. One of the most significant advantages of nanodrug 
delivery is that it increases bioavailability, hence increasing the therapeutic index of 
the drug by directly targeting specific cells or tissues. This helps to lessen the drug’s 
overall negative effects (Shi et al, 2010).
The nanoparticles contain the small drug molecules and carry them to the desired 
site. Although there are many benefits to treating NDs, the therapeutic approach only 
provides short-term relief since it is difficult to transfer drugs to the brain. Utilising 
nanoparticles for NDs is one of the most recent developments in the field of nano￾technology (De Jong and Borm, 2008). The size range of the nanoparticles makes it 
possible for them to pass across a variety of biological barriers in the body, including 
the BBB, which is a particularly difficult problem to solve (De Jong and Borm, 2008; 
Shilo et al, 2015; Sriraman et al, 2014).
Several studies are being done to create natural compound nanoformu￾lations, but it is yet unknown if the compound’s action is the same when it is 12 NeuroPhytomedicine
nanoencapsulated or not. For many decades, the medical benefits of curcumin, 
an old ayurvedic drug made from the turmeric herb, have been well documented. 
Due to curcumin’s poor bioavailability and low water solubility, which are some 
of its drawbacks, curcumin nanoparticles are employed to address these prob￾lems. Wet-milling approach, in which the curcumin was sprayed into boiling 
water while being stirred and sonicated, is one typical way for creating curcumin 
nanoparticles. Additionally, research suggests that when compared to raw cur￾cumin, nanocurcumin showed better solubility, antibacterial, and antifungal 
activity (Basniwal et al, 2011). Nanocurcumin particles can also be made using 
different techniques. The emulsion-diffusion evaporation approach used by 
Duan et al (2010) and Shaikh et al (2009) to manufacture nanoparticles resulted 
in stable, spherical nanoparticles. When the nanoparticles are taken orally, the 
bioavailability of the chemical increases dramatically (ninefold) (Shaikh et al, 
2009). Nanoprecipitation is a different strategy that has been employed to encase 
curcumin in polymer (poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)–poly(ethylene glycol)) 
(Anand et al, 2010; Yallapu et al, 2010).
Many literature reviews have been put forward to improve the bioavailability 
of resveratrol, much as curcumin. According to studies, resveratrol becomes more 
soluble and easier to transport across the plasma membrane as its size approaches 
the nanoscale (Ansari et al, 2011). Resveratrol has a number of drawbacks, includ￾ing limited bioavailability, low solubility, and quick metabolism. These disad￾vantages are eliminated by the nanotechnique. Resveratrol nanoparticles are 
frequently prepared using a high-shear homogenisation procedure that first creates 
microparticles and then uses an ultrasonic method to create nanoparticles (Neves 
et al, 2013). When resveratrol is loaded onto lipid core nanoparticles, the tissue 
concentration in the brain, liver, and kidney improves. Resveratrol’s anti-glioma 
activity has been documented when it is included in biodegradable nanoparticles 
(Shao et al, 2009).
According to Khan et al (2013), withaferin-A, an active component of Withania 
somnifera, tends to have a more anxiolytic effect when it is nanoencapsulated. 
Ginseng extract powder was processed at different speeds and energies during 
high-energy ball milling to create nanoscaled ginseng (Wen et al, 2009). When 
compared to raw Ginseng powder extract, the antioxidant capacity and capac￾ity for cellular development were determined to be surprisingly high (Lee et al, 
2013). Shinji et al (2011) investigated the effects of Ginkgo nanoparticles on brain 
cells. Combinatorial dry (gas phase grinding) and wet methods were used to cre￾ate Ginkgo biloba nanoparticles (liquid phase grinding). The Ach release from 
the cortical synapse of the brain’s cerebral hemispheres is increased by nano￾sized ginkgo (Shinji et al, 2011). Additionally, studies have indicated that natu￾ral herbs such as Bacopa monnieri, Ashwagandha, Mucuna pruriens Linn, and 
Panax ginseng root leaf extract may be used to create gold and silver nanopar￾ticles (Arulkumar and Sabesan, 2012; Khan et al, 2013; Lee et al, 2013; Babu 
et al, 2013).
Polymeric nano-micelles are cutting-edge delivery colloid systems that can be 
used to nanoencapsulate phenolics that are amphiphilic and poorly water soluble. Phytochemicals 13
They are composed of a hydrophilic shell and a hydrophobic core in a copolymer 
diblock structure. Two factors work together to generate micelles. The interaction 
between molecules causes their connection, and the repulsion between molecules 
prevents micelles from expanding indefinitely to reach a separate macroscopic 
phase. In order to generate stable polymeric micelles, amphiphilic block copolymers 
minimise free energy; generally speaking, change in entropy is thought to be the 
most crucial component (Ratheesh et al, 2017).
1.7 MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF HERBS 
AND THEIR CLINICAL USES
Various medicinal plants showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that 
could potentially have therapeutic benefits in treating a range of nervous system 
disorders. The findings of the research also suggest that interactions between the 
cholinergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems are primarily responsible for 
the therapeutic benefits of plants on NDs including Alzheimer’s and PD. The plant’s 
interaction with the GABA and opioid system may have analgesic and anticonvul￾sant properties (Khazdair et al, 2018). Different mechanisms of medical properties 
of medicinal herbs are summarised in Figure 1.2.
FIGURE 1.2 Medical properties of medicinal herbs with different mechanisms. GSH, 
glutathione; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CAT, catalase; NO, nitric oxide; MDA, malondi￾aldehyde; PLA2: phospholipase A2; PGE2: prostaglandin-E2; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; COX-1,

1.8 FUTURE DIRECTION
Both brain deterioration and neuropharmacological disorders involve the process of neu￾rodegeneration. Cognitive impairment is a significant public health issue in the twenty-first 
century, and a number of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions, including 
Parkinsonism, AD, depression, schizophrenia, cerebrovascular impairment, head inju￾ries, dementia, and seizure disorders, can be profoundly functionally incapacitating.
Phytochemicals protect neurons by interacting with many pathogenic factors 
associated with NDs. Dietary habits have been shown in epidemiological research 
to increase health and longevity, as well as to protect cognitive and motor function, 
as well as prevent depressive disorders. Food-derived chemicals have been consid￾ered as a treatment method for age-related neurodegeneration. Food-derived chemi￾cal bioavailability is reduced by fast metabolism, insufficient permeability across 
the BBB and decreased bioavailability and stability in the brain (Pandareesh et al, 
2015). Lipophilic flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenes can cross the BBB into the 
brain, where they have high bioavailability and affinity for brain receptors. Among 
these phytochemicals and their derivatives, the development of novel neuroprotec￾tive substances is envisaged (Gomes et al, 2009). Several delivery strategies have 
been suggested to improve bioavailability and pharmacological formulation, includ￾ing nanoparticles, liposomes, complexes with phospholipids and amphiphilic poly￾mers, as well as conjugation with amino acids and glycosides (Gomes et al, 2009).
Diet and food-derived compounds should have diverse impacts on individuals with 
diverse genetic backgrounds, metabolic profiles, ages, and environmental exposure. 
These evidences indicate that the findings of an epidemiological study should be care￾fully analysed. To identify the potent bioactive compounds and estimate the effective 
concentration in the targeted brain areas, very sensitive analytical approaches for 
pharmacokinetic studies are necessary. Additionally, a quantitative assessment of 
the therapeutic advantages and consequences on disease development has yet to be 
established, and more sensitive in vivo quantitative measures of the survival or death 
and function of individual neurons are still necessary (Naoi et al, 2019).
Recent research has demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of phytochemicals 
in a number of animal models of neurological disorders. The need for phytothera￾peutic drugs is growing, but before plant-derived extracts and isolated molecules 
responsible for the action are widely accepted and used, scientific validation is 
required. Therefore, “phytochemicals” might assure a new source of therapeutic 
neurodegenerative medications.
The most debilitating difficulty in the world is ND diseases, and due to the dete￾rioration of lifestyle and stress, additional ND patients are predicted in the future. 
Based on the fact that existing ways effectively deliver drugs to these patients’ parts 
of the brain.
1.9 CONCLUSION
Numerous NDs have mysterious origins. Neurodegeneration is a process that occurs 
in response of both neuropharmacological diseases and brain aging. Cognitive 
dysfunction is a serious public health issue in the twenty-first century, and various Phytochemicals 15
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders have been linked to it. AD, depres￾sion, schizophrenia, cerebrovascular impairment, head injury, dementia, seizure disor￾ders, and Parkinsonism are all examples of extremely functionally disabling illnesses.
Since many decades ago, the use of herbal medicines has attracted consider￾able interest due to their medicinal potential. Phytochemicals have recently been 
shown to have neuroprotective properties in several animal models of neurological 
disorders. While there is a growing demand for phytotherapeutic drugs, scientific 
validation is required before plant-derived extracts and isolated molecules respon￾sible for the action achieve widespread recognition and application. As a conclusion, 
“phytochemicals” could provide a new supply of helpful neurodegenerative medica￾tions. Most of the phytochemicals studied had decreased activity when compared 
to traditional criteria. Due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anticholin￾esterase properties, phytochemicals will likely be used in the future as a promising 
treatment for NDDs. The cellular and subcellular characteristics of NDs including 
AD, PD, Huntington’s, and others are similar, as are the majority of the molecular 
signalling pathways that might result in apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation.
In general, using herbal medicine offers hopeful alternatives for the present treat￾ments for NDs. The poor pharmacokinetic qualities of herbal medicine/natural sub￾stances, however, severely limit their potential. The herbal remedy has been included 
in a number of drug delivery formulations to get around these restrictions. In recent 
years, nanoencapsulation has become a promising new field for medication delivery. 
These nanoformulations can target drugs to certain cells, lowering toxicity and dose 
requirements. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that using natural substances in 
the nanosize range as a therapeutic agent has the same effect as using them directly.

2.1 INTRODUCTION
An onerous problem for medical treatment, society, and the economy is the rise 
in people with neurodegenerative illnesses in our ageing society. The term “neuro￾protection” refers to the methods and supporting mechanisms that can protect the 
central nervous system (CNS) from the neuronal damage brought on by a variety 
of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease 
(PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), anxiety, cerebrovascular disease, seizures, and oth￾ers (Winner et al, 2011). These illnesses have similar symptomological characteristics 
throughout the course of the disease. Elevated oxidative/nitrosative stress, mito￾chondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding/aggregation, synapse loss, and reduced 
neuronal survival are a few of the physiological signs. Neurodegenerative disorders 
advance significantly as a result of a combination of genetic and environmental fac￾tors (Figure 2.1). A significant quantity of energy is required to protect immunologi￾cal and neuronal cells from the accumulating oxygen and nitrogen species that stress 
the environment when they are exposed to hazardous proteins (Finkel, 2011).
By the year 2040, it is predicted that neurodegenerative illnesses will rank as the 
second leading cause of mortality among seniors (Ansari et al, 2010). Phytochemical 
substances are one of the methods for neuroprotection and are an important treat￾ment for avoiding neurodegenerative disorders. Numerous types of synthetic and 
natural neuroprotective agents have been described; nonetheless, it is thought that 
synthetic neuroprotective agents may cause adverse effects such as dry mouth, 
fatigue, drowsiness, lethargy, anxiety or restlessness, balance issues, etc. In recent 
years, both nationally and internationally, research centres and enterprises have 
become much more conscious of herbal-based medicinal goods. Consequently, there 
has been a lot of attention given to possible phytochemicals that might modify neu￾ronal activity and provide protection against neurodegeneration (Kumar et al, 2012).
Numerous bioactive phytochemicals and other organic substances may enhance 
the therapy of neurodegenerative illnesses, according to a variety of research (Martel 
et al, 2019). Numerous plants include phytochemicals such as alkaloids, steroids, 
terpenoids, saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, and polyphenolic substances that have 
important characteristics like anti-inflammatory potential, DNA repair capacity, 
222 NeuroPhytomedicine
autophagy, and antioxidant activities (Franco et al, 2019). As a result, this chapter 
examines neurodegenerative illnesses, an overview of phytochemicals, their poten￾tial for providing neuroprotection, as well as how they work.
2.2 NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
The central and peripheral nervous systems are both affected by neurodegenerative 
diseases (ND), which are progressive abnormalities of the CNS. Neurodegeneration 
may result from the gradual and cumulative loss of brain cells. Although several 
variables are known to directly contribute to the beginning of neurodegeneration, 
the key causative element is the production of free radicals by reactive oxygen and 
nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). Numerous neurodegenerative illnesses are known 
to advance more rapidly in cases where neuroinflammatory processes are present. 
These illnesses’ pathogenic characteristics include loss of neurons and protein mis￾folding and aggregation, which cause a variety of signs and symptoms (Figure 2.1). 
Over 600 neurological illnesses have been documented globally, according to stud￾ies from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (Meck et al, 
1998). In this chapter, a few of them are briefly explored.
2.2.1 Anxiety
Cognitive, physical, emotional, and behavioural components are all present in the 
psychological and physiological state of anxiety. It may worsen to the point that it 
FIGURE 2.1 Factors leading to conformational changes of protein in the progression of 
neurodegenerative disorders.Neuroprotective Potentials of Phytochemicals 23
interferes with basic daily activities and makes a person fearful of what would nor￾mally happen in their life.
There are seven clinical illnesses known as anxiety disorders, including (1) gener￾alized anxiety disorder (GAD): A person with this disorder has chronic dread, anxi￾ety, and excessive stress over trivial concerns. (2) Panic disorder: A person has short 
episodes of great fear and dread that are often accompanied by disorientation, dizzi￾ness, trembling, shivering, nausea, and breathing difficulties. (3) Phobias: A condition 
in which a particular stimulus or circumstance causes dread and worry. Agoraphobia 
is the fear of being in a location or circumstance from which it would be difficult or 
humiliating to leave or from which aid may not be accessible. (4) Social anxiety dis￾order (SAD): This condition is characterized by an extreme dread of adverse public 
scrutiny, public humiliation, or public disgrace. (5) Obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD): The main characteristics are recurring obsessions and compulsions. (6) Post￾traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This condition develops as a consequence of a 
traumatic event, such as a serious accident, child abuse, a war scenario, a natural 
catastrophe, a rape, hostage situations, etc. (7) Anxiety related to separation: It is the 
sensation of unwarranted or excessive worry brought on by being away from a per￾son or location. The neuropeptides galanin, neuropeptide Y, arginine vasopressin, 
and tachykinin, as well as the monoamines dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin, 
as well as neurosteroids and cytokines, have been reported to have a modulating 
function in anxiety states (Pathak et al, 2011).
2.2.2 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a broad term for a collection of 
neuropsychiatric symptom clusters that first appear in infancy and often last into 
adulthood. People who exhibit a variety of symptoms, such as difficulty focusing, 
restlessness, mood swings, temperament issues, difficulties finishing work, disor￾ganization, and an inability to handle stress, are increasingly being diagnosed with 
ADHD (Brue and Oakland, 2002).
2.2.3 Depression
Depression is a state of low mood and widespread sadness. One of the most prevalent 
mental diseases, depression may present in a variety of ways, from mild melancholy to 
complete anguish and despair. Both biological and environmental variables influence 
mood swings and the incidence of depression symptoms. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) estimates that 450 million people worldwide suffer from a mental or behavioural 
problem, and that number is expected to rise sharply (Drevets et al, 1999).
According to a WHO report, depression is among the top ten global causes of 
disease and death. There are a number of structural changes that occur in neurons 
during depressive states, including reduced frontal cortex and hippocampal volume, 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis malfunction, and abnormalities in 5-hydroxy 
tryptamine (5-HT) and its receptors. It is generally known that the monoaminergic 
neurotransmitter 5-HT is dysregulated in illnesses like schizophrenia and anxiety, 
which are neurological disorders (Drevets et al, 1999).24 NeuroPhytomedicine
2.2.4 Dementia
The most prevalent kind of human brain degenerative illness and significant motor 
impairment, PD affects movement. The most ubiquitous element contributing to the 
recognisable symptoms of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substan￾tia nigra (Calne, 2000). Tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia, and impairment of balance 
are its four primary symptoms. Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and nerve cell 
loss in some of its ventral tier are the typical pathological signs. In addition to the 
neuropathologic symptoms, a persistent deficiency in cholinergic neurotransmission 
may contribute to PD neurochemically. Deficit, learning, and memory loss are the 
hallmarks of AD, a neurodegenerative condition that is also marked by cognitive 
problems such as sadness, agitation, and psychosis (Calne, 2000).
2.2.5 Epilepsy
The most prevalent neurological condition, epilepsy, affects about 50 million people 
globally (Scheuer and Pedley, 1990). It is distinguished by the sporadic occurrence 
of recurrent epileptic seizures, or the repetitive involuntary contraction of striated 
muscle. The grey matter of brain experiences excessive and accelerated firing of 
cerebral neurons during seizures.
2.2.6 Excitotoxicity
Some poisons, such as domoic acid (an amnesic shellfish poison produced by marine 
algae), kainic acid, etc., are intoxicated in part by excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity is 
the degenerative process through which excessive glutamate stimulation kills and 
damages nerve cells. Excitotoxicity may also manifest in a variety of clinical situa￾tions, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord 
injury, and other neurological illnesses (Doble, 1999). The majority of typical brain 
processes, such as cognition, memory, and learning, are also affected. Excitotoxicity 
may result from excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, which causes 
an influx of Ca2+, noise and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase activation, and 
excessive NO production (Albin and Greenamyre, 1992).
2.2.7 Schizophrenia
It is among the most significant types of mental disorders. In this situation, the patient 
is unaware of what is occurring right now. There are two categories of this illness’ 
symptoms: (1) Adverse effects include aberrant behaviour, hallucinations, delusions, 
and thinking abnormalities. (2) Adverse effects include social isolation and a flattening 
of emotional reactions. In this condition, the brain’s levels of neurotransmitters includ￾ing dopamine, 5-HT, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine are elevated (Kumar, 2006).
2.3 OVERVIEW OF PHYTOCHEMICALS
Due to the many phytochemicals found in fruits and vegetables, there is an urgent 
need for regular ingestion (Somani et al, 2015). The presence of these different bio￾active compounds from plant parts has been investigated in several studies (Ogidi Neuroprotective Potentials of Phytochemicals 25
et al, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2021d, 2022; Ogidi and Julius, 
2021), and they have been demonstrated to protect against oxidative stress and neu￾roinflammation, two main characteristics of NDs (Enenebeaku et al, 2022; Kim 
et al, 2010). Curcumin, quercetin, diallyl trisulfide, and epigallocatechin-3-galate 
(EGCG) are examples of common phytochemicals that stimulate the immune sys￾tem, reduce platelet aggregation, and control hormone metabolism (Farooqui, 2012; 
Ogidi, 2022).
Researchers have hypothesized that increasing the Mediterranean diet’s intake 
of olive oil leads to a considerable improvement in health status, as seen by a large 
drop in overall mortality (13%) in PD and AD patients (Sofi et al, 2008). The condi￾tion of NDs can be improved by using phytochemicals as nutraceuticals; however, 
the underlying mechanism is yet unclear. Another research said that phytochemi￾cals enhance the condition by scavenging free radicals and acting as anti-oxidants 
(Nokolova, 2011).
Although the cellular targets of phytochemicals are unknown, it is anticipated 
that these substances may activate stress response pathways that the cells would 
employ as a defence mechanism in addition to influencing gene expression and 
enzyme metabolism (Martin et al, 2004). Another theory is that phytochemicals par￾ticipate in a downward signal transduction cascade as a ligand, attaching to specific 
receptors on cell membranes or nuclei and then exerting their antioxidant function 
(Si and Liu, 2007).
2.4 NEUROPROTECTIVE POTENTIAL OF PHYTOCHEMICALS
The public and scientific communities are very curious in the potential of phyto￾constituents for neuroprotection and the prevention of NDs. Several phytochemi￾cals have been found to have neuroprotective properties in animal and cell culture 
models of neurological disorders. The chalcone (saffron or yellow B) may protect 
cultured neurons from ischemic brain injury, while piceatannol may protect them 
against A-induced death. Phytochemicals in plants have been proven to protect the 
nervous system against disease, both in animal models of neurodegenerative disor￾ders and in epidemiological studies of human populations (Liu, 2003). The fact that 
many of the active compounds have antioxidant activity has been the main focus 
of research on the health benefits of phytochemicals. Various phytochemicals’ neu￾roprotective properties are linked to decreased oxidative stress. Reducing oxida￾tive stress and protecting cultured hippocampal neurons from NO-mediated cell 
death, for instance, were achieved by resveratrol, quercetin, and catechins (Joseph 
et al, 2005). The following is a discussion of some of the crucial phytochemicals in 
neuroprotection:
2.4.1 Phenols and Polyphenols
Since the 1990s, phenolic chemicals found in food have gained a lot of attention 
due to mounting evidence of their positive impact on human health. Apple, grape, 
and citrus fruit juice polyphenols have been found to have a higher neuroprotec￾tive effect than antioxidant vitamins in in vitro, in vivo, and clinical investigations. 26 NeuroPhytomedicine
Green tea’s catechins and epicatechins have been shown to be able to protect neurons 
from a variety of oxidative and metabolic insults, including preventing 6-hydroxy￾dopamine from damaging dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of Parkinson’s 
disease, shielding retinal neurons from ischemia-reperfusion injury, and reducing 
mutant huntingtin misfolding and neurotoxicity in a Huntington’s disease model 
(Ehrnhoefer et al, 2006).
By activating protein kinase C (PKC) and transcription factors that promote the 
production of cell-survival genes, catechins, a kind of polyphenol, have neuropro￾tective properties (Mandel et al, 2005). It has been proposed that catechins may 
protect neurons against Alzheimer’s disease processes and reduce the development 
of the illness. Numerous signalling pathways may be activated by catechins and 
their metabolites to exert cell-survival and anti-inflammatory effects. These activi￾ties include changing the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and enhanc￾ing antioxidant defences (Sutherland et al, 2006).
EGCG, the most prevalent polyphenol in tea leaves, has captured the attention 
of everyone in recent years owing to its ability to slow down neuronal ageing. Tea 
intake is negatively linked with the prevalence of NDs (Pervin et al, 2018). In several 
research projects using AD models, EGCG was given. In one of these research, AD 
models were given the medication D-gal, and the amount of amyloid plaques was 
significantly decreased (Chan et al, 2016; Walker et al, 2015; Wobst et al, 2015).
Another study team hypothesized that EGCG administration reduced beta- and 
gamma-secretases by inhibiting ERK and NFkappaB, hence avoiding the death of 
neuronal cells (Liu et al, 2014a, 2014b). Another research found that EGCG adminis￾tration decreased amyloid plaques by cleaving APP via -secretase (Smith et al, 2010). 
According to one research, persons who drank three or more cups of tea per day had 
a lower chance of acquiring PD. Additionally, it was shown that raising glutathione 
strengthens the free radical scavenging mechanism, which in turn stimulates CREB 
and Bcl-2 and results in beneficial effects (Choi et al, 2002). Tyrosine hydroxylase 
(TH)-positive cells suffer significant loss in PD, and one research found that taking 
EGCG and tea at the same time may stop the loss of these cells in the substantia 
nigra (Koh et al, 2003).
2.4.2 Flavonoids
Recent years have seen an uptick in interest in flavonoids due to the hypothesis that 
they may control neuronal activity and halt the progression of age-related neurode￾generation. There is promising evidence that extracts from flavonoid-rich plants or 
foods may improve memory and learning in a range of mammalian species, including 
humans, by shielding vulnerable neurons from damage, boosting existing neuronal 
function, or stimulating neuronal regeneration. Some flavonoids, such the citrus fla￾vanone tangeretin, have showed promise as neuroprotective agents against the under￾lying pathology of Parkinson’s disease. These flavonoids have been found to retain 
nigro-striatal integrity and functioning following lesioning with 6-hydroxydopamine 
(Youdim et al, 2004).
To reach the brain, flavonoids must first pass across the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB), which controls the entry of xenobiotics (Ehrnhoefer et al, 2006). Several Neuroprotective Potentials of Phytochemicals 27
dietary anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin-3-glucoside, as well 
as flavanones such hesperetin and naringenin, and their in vivo metabolites, have 
been shown to cross the BBB in relevant in vitro and in situ models (Youdim et al, 
2004). Anthocyanins could be able to pass the monolayer in in vitro BBB models 
(Youdim et al, 2002).
The anti-oxidant and free radical scavenging activities of flavonoids are the sub￾ject of much research, and quercetin’s anti-proliferative capabilities are the subject of 
extensive research on quercetin (Lesjak et al, 2018). Hydrogen peroxide drastically 
reduced the viability of phenochromocytoma cells (PC12); however, when PC12 were 
re-incubated with quercetin, quercetin protected the cells against H2O2-induced 
toxicity even if its effects were dose-dependent (Heo and Lee, 2004). Quercetin’s 
neuroprotective properties were seen at concentrations as low as 10 M and as high as 
30 M. Quercetin is said to be able to pass the BBB and stop cytotoxicity brought on 
by H2O2 as well (Heo and Lee, 2004).
2.4.3 Alkaloids
A large class of naturally occurring substances called alkaloids typically comprise 
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. Alkaloids may have an impact on the CNS, 
which includes the brain and spinal cord’s nerve cells, which regulate several direct 
bodily processes and behaviour. They may also have an impact on the autonomic 
nervous system, which controls respiration, heartbeat, circulation, and internal 
organ function.
Indole alkaloids contain the indole carbon-nitrogen ring, which is also present 
in the psychedelic substances lysergic acid diethylamide and the fungal alkaloids 
ergine and psilocybin (LSD). These alkaloids may conflict with or complement sero￾tonin’s activity in the brain (Pearson, 2001). The principal mechanism of action of 
ergot alkaloids was formerly believed to be their notable effects on blood flow. The 
spinal cord and CNS are impacted by tropane alkaloids found in Datura, including 
atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine. Vinpocetine is a very effective vasodilator 
that is an alkaloid derived from Vinca minor (Halliwell, 2007).
Specifically, vinpocetine has been demonstrated to increase cerebral blood flow 
and metabolism, including glucose absorption, which may mitigate the negative 
consequences of hypoxia and ischaemia (Halliwell, 2007). The daffodil (Narcissus 
tazetta), snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis), and snowflake (Galanthus nivalis) all con￾tain the tertiary alkaloid galantamine. It is a member of the phenanthrene chemical 
class (Leucojum aestivum). The medication may also activate nicotinic receptors to 
improve cognition and memory. It is a member of the pharmacological family known 
as cholinesterase inhibitors (Halliwell, 2007).
2.4.4 Terpenoids
Since more than a century ago, several essential oils produced from plants, including 
wormwood, have been recognized to have convulsant effects. Valepotriates and ses￾quiterpenes are the two pharmacologically active components found in the rhizome 
of valerian (Valerian officinalis) (valerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid). The 28 NeuroPhytomedicine
active substances have been shown to have sedating effects on mice. However, it has 
been shown that valerian crude extract inhibits GABA absorption and has GABA 
(B) receptor binding capabilities in rat synaptosomes (Ortiz et al, 1999). A sesquiter￾pene alkaloid known as huperzine A, which was isolated from the Chinese medici￾nal plant Huperzia serrata, has a variety of neuroprotective properties. Huperzine A 
increased spatial working memory and helped with learning and memory problems. 
Triterpenoid, brahminoside, and monoterpenes in Centella asiatica L. are chemical 
compounds that are helpful in reviving and enhancing nervous system performance 
(Nalini et al, 1992).
2.4.5 Fatty Acids
It has been shown that both in animals and people, consuming monounsaturated 
fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may reduce cognitive decline. 
As an example, walnuts contain the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (8:1) as 
well as the n26 and n23 PUFAs linoleic acid (LA) and a-linolenic acid (ALA), which 
have received the most attention in research (Crews et al, 2005).
Numerous studies have shown that eating a diet low in n23 fatty acids will have 
an adverse effect on cognitive performance (McCann and Ames, 2005). In order 
for neurons to connect with other cells, they need to have normal anchor receptors, 
ion channels, and the ability to release and reabsorb unmetabolized neurotransmit￾ters. These requirements are all dependent on the structure of the cell. The neuro￾nal membrane’s fatty acid content affects these characteristics (Yehuda et al, 2002). 
There is evidence that the fatty acid composition of neuronal membranes declines 
with age, despite the fact that essential fatty acids have been found to increase mem￾brane fluidity and PUFA content. In addition to affecting the biophysical features 
of membranes, PUFAs in the form of phospholipids in neuronal membranes may 
directly participate in signalling cascades to improve neuronal function, synaptic 
plasticity, and neuroprotection (Yehuda et al, 2002).
2.4.6 Berberine
According to several research using models of ND, berberine gives neuroprotection 
through controlling the levels of neurotrophin (Ji and Shen, 2011; Durairajan et al, 
2012). The ability of berberine to halt the activity of different enzymes implicated 
in the development of AD has also been mentioned (Hsu et al, 2013). Neurotoxicity 
was generated in a number of in vitro investigations using glutamate, H2O2, and a 
cobalt chloride-driven decreased oxygen environment. It was shown in these in vitro 
investigations that berberine may protect neuronal cells against neurotoxicity (Cui 
et al, 2009; Pires et al, 2014). Additionally, it has been shown that berberine is effec￾tive in treating cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia. It functions as a scavenger of ROS 
produced as a result of the hypoxic circumstances in this situation, which inhibits 
numerous agents that promote apoptosis and confers neuroprotection (Zhang et al, 
2012). However, according to Kwon et al, berberine has severe side effects, includ￾ing a reduction in DA neurons brought on by the cytotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine 
(Kwon et al, 2010).Neuroprotective Potentials of Phytochemicals 29
By scavenging free radicals, berberine activates the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway and 
has neuroprotective benefits. Additionally, it has been shown that berberine has anti￾apoptotic effects by upregulating Bcl-2 and downregulating caspase 1 and 3 and Bax 
expression (Asai et al, 2007). According to one research by Hsu et al, berberine treat￾ment protects hydrogen peroxide-induced neurotoxicity by upregulating Bad expres￾sion while downregulating p53, caspase, and cyclin D1 expression (Hsu et al, 2012). It 
has been shown that berberine enhances cell survival and lessens oxidative stress when 
supplied at nanomolar concentrations by downregulating a number of factors such 
cytochrome C, Bax, and caspase. It has been discovered that administering berberine 
may prevent ischemic stroke by obstructing potassium currents (Maleki et al, 2018).
Another clinical investigation found that giving berberine to animals with NDs 
decreased their levels of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and choline acetyltrans￾ferase (Asai et al, 2007). However, several studies have also shown that berberine 
may cause the substantia nigra to lose dopaminergic neurons when it is administered 
for prolonged periods of time (Kim et al, 2014a; Shin et al, 2013). Berberine may 
prevent ischemic stroke by removing radical species, or in other words, lowering 
oxidative stress, according to some research (Kim et al, 2014b). In a rat model of AD, 
injection of berberin improves cholinergic enzyme activity, increases brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor levels, and reduces the production of inflammatory markers 
(Durairajan et al, 2012).
2.4.7 Limonoids
In the kingdom of plants, limonoids are rare, highly oxygenated molecules. Due to 
its high limonoids content, Melia toosendan, a member of the Meliaceae family, is 
bitter. Its extract stimulates neuronal development in a manner similar to that of 
NGF, which does so via activating ERK and protein kinase A (PKA) (Roy and Saraf, 
2006). The seeds of Trichilia welwitschii were used to isolate the three limonoid 
chemicals (dregeanin DM4, rohituka 3, and trichilia lactone D5) that were the sub￾ject of this study (Tsamo et al, 2013).
In one research, it was shown that limonoids increase NGF levels in a PC12 rat 
cell line, promoting neuronal differentiation and proliferation (Roy and Saraf, 2006). 
Similar to NGF, limonoid chemicals found in Melia toosendan extract enhance neu￾rite development (Zhang et al, 2013). The PKA and ERK pathways, which are essen￾tial in neuronal development, are hampered when the PC12 rat cell line is exposed 
to PKA inhibitors, according to another finding of this research (Yu et al, 2004). 
Limonoids stimulate ERKs and PKA, which help to enhance neuronal development 
(Roy and Saraf, 2006). Compared to NGF, the extract from Melia toosendan was 
more effective in fostering growth. However, it was discovered in that research that 
the plant’s extract did not activate Ras or Raf1, but rather required the activation of 
PKA and MEK (Yu et al, 2004).
2.4.8 Sulforaphane
Cruciferous plants including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower are rich in 
the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. The neuroprotective effects of sulforaphane have 30 NeuroPhytomedicine
been shown in animal models of both acute and chronic neurodegenerative disor￾ders. Sulforaphane treatment in a mouse stroke model decreased brain damage and 
cerebral oedema while preserving the retinal pigment (Zhao et al, 2006). Cultured 
neurons have shown that sulforaphane protects dopaminergic neurons against mito￾chondrial toxins and oxidative stress (Han et al, 2007).
2.4.9 Hypericin and Pseudohypericin
Hypericin and pseudohypericin, two naphthodianthrones, are the main constituents 
of Hypericum perforatum. Strong evidence supports the idea that hypericin and 
pseudohypericin have a role in the antidepressant effect. One way several antide￾pressants work to raise levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, or 
dopamine is by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (Schulz et al, 1998). Serotonin, dopa￾mine, and norepinephrine synaptic re-uptake seem to be blocked by this substance 
(Chatterjee et al, 1998). Synaptic concentration of neurotransmitters is increased 
by blocking their reuptake. This is an additional way that synthetic antidepressants 
could work (Chatterjee et al, 1998).
2.4.10 Curcumin
One of the significant components of turmeric, which has a prominent position 
among Indian spices, is curcumin. Curcumin is used to treat diabetes, biliary dis￾eases, cough, and hepatic illnesses since it contains a variety of therapeutic charac￾teristics (El-Bahr, 2015; Nam et al, 2014; Soleimani et al, 2018). Curcumin has been 
linked to a number of pathways, one of which being its capacity to attach to amyloid 
plaques by inhibiting NF-, hence lowering AD development (Nam et al, 2014).
There have been several reports of curcumin’s positive effects on the neurological 
system. Curcumin therapy reduced behavioural impairments and protected neurons 
from ischemic cell death in an animal model of stroke (Xu et al, 2007). There is 
mounting evidence from cell culture and animal models that dietary curcumin may 
be useful in the prevention or treatment of age-related NDs including Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, and stroke. Curcumin has also been demonstrated to prevent chronic 
stress-induced impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis and increase the produc￾tion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in an animal model of depression 
(Xu et al, 2007).
Additionally, it has been shown that curcumin promotes neuronal regeneration 
in a PD model by enhancing BDNF levels through activating Trk/PI3K signalling 
pathways (Yang et al, 2014). It is believed that curcumin works by lowering TNF￾and caspase levels while concurrently increasing BDNF levels (Liu et al, 2014a, 
2014b; Nam et al, 2014). Curcumin nanoparticles have also been developed in recent 
research to treat cognitive impairment by restoring BDNF levels via Akt/GSK-3 
signalling pathways (Hoppe et al, 2013). Because it works on multiple molecular 
elements of these disorders, curcumin presents a potential safe and affordable pre￾ventative strategy for ND.
Curcumin also decreased the development of amyloid plaque in cell cultures 
and in vivo, according to recent studies (Wang et al, 2018). Curcumin has been Neuroprotective Potentials of Phytochemicals 31
demonstrated to alter A levels and inhibit the formation of the amyloid precur￾sor protein (APP) in mice neurons, according to a research by Zhang et al (2010). 
Curcumin prevents A plaques by inhibiting NF-B, which is the mechanism through 
which it works. Curcumin is not only effective against AD, but it may also prevent 
PD by causing the protein-synuclein to become unstable (Liu et al, 2014a, 2014b).
2.4.11 Resveratrol
Red grapes contain the phytophenol resveratrol, which has antioxidant proper￾ties. It is referred to as a “miracle” molecule because it has anti-inflammatory 
and antioxidant effects on ND (Anastacio et al, 2014). Treatment with resvera￾trol restored a variety of cognitive impairments generated in rat models by lower￾ing hippocampal TNF- and IL-1 and increasing BDNF (Anastacio et al, 2014). 
Recent research has also revealed that resveratrol may protect neurons in the brain 
and spinal cord from ischemia damage after being administered peripherally. 
Resveratrol protected spinal cord neurons from ischemia in a rat stroke model 
and reduced brain ischemia damage (Huang et al, 2001). Neurons in culture may 
be protected against NO’s role in mediating oxidative stress-related death by the 
antioxidant resveratrol. Dopaminergic neurons in midbrain slice cultures, a model 
for PD, also benefited from resveratrol’s protection against oxidative and meta￾bolic stressors (Huang et al, 2001). Protecting cells against the damage caused by 
mutant huntingtin, resveratrol was tested in worm and cell culture models (Parker 
et al, 2005). In AD models, resveratrol inhibited amyloid -peptide’s ability to dam￾age neuronal cells and promoted the clearance of amyloid-peptide from cultured 
cells (Marambaud et al, 2005).
2.4.12 Allium and Allicin
Allium and allicin, two organosulfur compounds found in garlic and onions, have 
been shown to have neuroprotective effects. The antioxidant capabilities and acti￾vation of stress-response pathways by aryl-sulfide compounds may elevate the 
expression of neuroprotective proteins including mitochondrial uncoupling proteins 
(Oi et al, 1999). Furthermore, allicin activates transient receptor potential (TRP) 
ion channels in the plasma membrane of neurons. There are many other phyto￾chemicals that may trigger adaptive cellular stress responses by opening TRP chan￾nels in neurons; examples include isothiocyanates, garlic alliums, and cannabinoids 
(Oi et al, 1999).
2.5 MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PHYTOCHEMICALS 
WITH RESPECT TO NEUROPROTECTION
Phytochemicals activate cellular stress-response pathways, which in turn causes an 
increase in the expression of neuroprotective gene products. Emerging evidence sug￾gests that neurotrophic factors’ neuroprotective effects are mediated, at least in part, 
by their ability to dampen down cell death and apoptosis pathways (Haddad, 2002). 
There are around 50 neurotransmitters in the brain, which come from a wide variety 32 NeuroPhytomedicine
of chemical classes. Researchers have paid a lot of attention to acetylcholine since 
its deficit has been related to AD and other degenerative cognitive diseases, such as 
senile dementia. Phytochemicals may activate the transcription factor NF-kB via 
elevating production of antioxidant enzymes and Bcl-2. Certain phytochemicals may 
activate many signalling pathways by attaching to ligands that bind to various recep￾tors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), growth factor receptors (GFR), 
and insulin receptors (IR). Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), PKC, and mitogen￾activated protein kinases (MAPK) are some of the kinases activated by these recep￾tors (PI3K). Flavonoids alter synaptic plasticity by stimulating the ERE-CREB and 
P13 kinase-mTOR signalling pathways.
Numerous phytochemicals have been demonstrated to activate one or more path￾ways preceding nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and these include ter￾penes, diallyl sulphides, curcuminoids, and cytokines (NRF2). Ellison increases 
transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in the plasma membrane of neurons, 
which in turn activates neuroprotective kinase cascades via mitogen-activated pro￾tein kinases (MAPK), cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB), and brain￾derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Key neurotrophic factor BDNF may initiate 
the MAPK/ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways by binding to its tyrosine kinase TrkB 
receptor, activating the downstream molecules that might promote neurogenesis and 
cell survival (Cheng et al, 1999).
Allyl-sulfide sulphides may elevate mitochondrial uncoupling protein levels and 
promote stress-related pathways (Oi et al, 1999). Examples of flavanones that have 
been demonstrated to prevent oxidant-induced neuronal apoptosis include hesper￾etin and its metabolite, 5-nitrohesperetin. They do this by activating/phosphorylating 
signalling proteins crucial to the pro-survival pathways. Specific Ca2+ channels are 
activated by capsaicin (vanilloid receptors). Numerous phytochemicals, including 
flavonoids, terpenes, and related compounds, have been shown to have an impact 
on how GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, interacts with 
its ionotropic receptors. Fruits, vegetables, different drinks, and herbal preparations 
like ginseng and ginkgo biloba contain these GABA modulators (Cheng et al, 1999).
2.6 CONCLUSION
Due to a stressful lifestyle, several neurodegenerative illnesses are primarily emerg￾ing in the modern period. Serious negative effects will result from the continued 
use of synthetic medications in the treatment of certain illnesses. In recent years, 
scientists have concentrated their efforts on studying phytochemicals as a poten￾tial treatment for neurological illnesses. Alkaloids, terpenoids, phenols/polyphenols, 
flavonoids, and other phytochemicals protect neurons by focusing on the many 
pathogenic causes of NDs. Similar actions of phytochemicals have been reported in 
earlier studies, including (1) lowering oxidative stress-induced free radicals via an 
antioxidant effect, (2) enhancing immunological cells’ phagocytic abilities to help 
clear A/senile plaques in AD and Lewy bodies in PD, (3) raising neurotransmitter 
concentrations close to neurons by inhibiting neurotransmitter cleaving enzymes, 
and (4) adjusting to the current stress conditions. Additionally, a crucial quality for 
a potential neuroprotective drug is its capacity to pass across the BBB and reach the Neuroprotective Potentials of Phytochemicals 33
desired CNS locations. Finally, while it is yet unknown if polyphenols or other phy￾tochemicals have receptors or transporters in brain regions, substances with numer￾ous targets seem to be a viable class of therapies for the treatment of neurodisorders.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Change in dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle that has emerged along with the 
dawn of modern civilization has made humans weak and vulnerable to a plethora of 
diseases. Recently, many scientific studies have highlighted the extraordinary poten￾tial of a high phytochemical-containing diet to prevent numerous diseases such as 
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, 
etc. This has inspired a surge of enthusiasm in researchers to work on the develop￾ment of natural health products, nutraceuticals, functional foods, and the exploration 
of novel biomolecules for drug designing (Sharma and Kaushik, 2021). The venture 
begins with the collection and accurate identification of plants followed by drying, 
grinding, extraction, fractionation, purification, identification, and quantification of 
biomolecules. Plants are a desirable medicinal source due to their tremendous thera￾peutic potential, natural origin, relatively inexpensive, and ease of access. Herbal 
supplements can be an overly promising alternative in instances of drug intolerance 
and a high likelihood of detrimental consequences. Fundamentally, phytochemicals 
are byproducts of the plant’s secondary metabolism and are devoid of essential nutri￾ents. Their synthesis is aimed to preserve plants from insect and disease infestations 
along with extreme environmental challenges including ultraviolet (UV) exposure, 
drought, salinity, and other abiotic stresses. The production of both primary and sec￾ondary metabolites varies significantly since the former are byproducts of catabolic 
and anabolic circuits while the latter are produced by specialized cells (Yasmeen 
et al, 2018).
3Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 39
Extraction from plants involves the isolation of secondary metabolites such as 
glycosides, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, terpenes, and steroids. This can be actu￾alized via a wide array of standard extraction procedures available such as Soxhlet 
extraction, maceration, percolation, infusion, decoction, digestion, ultrasound￾assisted extraction, and microwave-assisted extraction. Further separation and puri￾fication can be done through paper chromatography (PC), thin-layer chromatography 
(TLC), gas chromatography (GC), and high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). The selection of a suitable extraction procedure is governed by the nature 
of plant material, type, pH of solvent, availability of instruments, and expected use 
of the product (Kumar and Khanum, 2012).
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have become a momentous health concern in 
the 20th century as they are lethal enough to cause death with no effective treat￾ment available. NDs are most rampant in the old age population. Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and dementia are some of the most widespread NDs. 
The progression of NDs is influenced by several environmental as well as genetic fac￾tors (Sarker and Oba, 2019). Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and accumulation 
of conglomerated proteins are some of the common pathological factors of all NDs. 
Neurotrophins are mandatory for the survival and maintenance of neurons in CNS and 
peripheral nervous system. Several researchers have figured out that a sharp decline neu￾rotrophin concentration is associated with NDs. Therefore, neurotrophins have become 
a crucial target for phytochemicals. Henceforth, the administration of neurotrophins is 
a promising strategy for a cure against NDs. However, delivery across the blood-brain 
barrier is the major challenge in the way of CNS disorders treatment (Ma et al, 2018).
The probability of effective treatment is greatly enhanced by early diagnosis. 
Numerous medicines such as axona, rotigotine, levopoda, memantine, etc., are being 
used for the treatment of NDs. However, the current treatment strategies are incapable 
of curing the cause and progression of the disease; instead, they only confer symptom￾atic relief. Albeit drugs to manage symptoms of NDs are present, there are no preventive 
medicines available. This situation calls for a dire need to explore novel neuroprotectant 
phytochemicals and therapeutic strategies to tackle these lethal diseases. This chapter 
summarizes the conventional and latest techniques that have been developed for the 
extraction, purification, and characterization of phytochemicals (Ma et al, 2018).
3.2 PRELIMINARY PREPARATION OF PLANT MATERIAL
Pre-preparation of plant material which comprises drying, and grinding is crucial as 
it ensures enhanced preservation of secondary metabolites in the final extract.
3.3 EXTRACTION
Extraction involves the segregation of therapeutic components based on their solubil￾ity in various solvents and can be actualized from any part of plants such as leaves, 
flowers, bark, stem, roots, and fruits. Activity analysis of each extract is performed 
and the one with the most promising activity is subjected to further purification. 
The quality of extract is influenced by several parameters such as part of plant and 40 NeuroPhytomedicine
type of solvent used. The interaction of solvent with plant metabolite is important 
for efficient interaction. This can be actualized by reducing the particle size, thus 
providing a large surface area for the contact. Therefore, powdered form is preferable 
over grinded form. Appropriate selection of solvent employed is important and must 
be evaluated for properties such as low boiling point, minimum toxicity, preserva￾tive action, and high solubility (Palai and Shekhawat, 2022). The major factors that 
govern the choice of solvent are the nature of metabolites, the nature of the solvent, 
potential health risks from extracts, etc. (Figure 3.1).
3.3.1 Maceration
In this method, coarsely powdered plant material, such as leaves, stems, or roots, is 
soaked in a suitable solvent in a stoppered container and stored at room temperature 
for three days with frequent stirring. Over time phytochemicals are dissolved by 
the solvent which can be isolated by filtration of solution or pressing. The after￾ward dried extract is obtained by subjecting solvent to evaporation in a water bath or 
oven. Mechanical procedures are not appropriate for the production of metabolites 
because they invariably disrupt numerous cells, and the endogenous enzymes that 
are released as a result harm the flavor, color, and ascorbic acid. Heat must be applied 
with the associated risk of damage to restrict the activity of these enzymes. This 
method is a preferred choice for thermo-labile substances (Altemimi et al, 2017).
3.3.2 Infusion
Infusions are prepared using the same protocol as that of maceration; however, the 
time taken by the process is desirable and much less. Finely grounded plant material 
FIGURE 3.1 List of conventional and advanced methods of extraction.Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 41
is placed in a glass container followed by pouring hot or cold extraction solvent and 
is kept in this state for a few minutes. Infusions are often susceptible to bacterial and 
fungal colonization therefore must be administered within 12 hours of the formula￾tion. This method is used for the extraction of high-solubility secondary metabolites. 
Solvent-to-sample ratio is often maintained as 16:1 or 4:1.
3.3.3 Percolation
In this method plant material moisturized with chosen extraction solvent is poured 
into a firmly covered container which is then allowed to stand for at least 4 hours 
after which it is topped off from the percolator. A thin layer is allowed to form 
on the mass by adding supplementary solvent, and the mixture is kept so for fur￾ther 24 hours in the closed percolator. Subsequently, the outlet of the percolator is 
opened, permitting the gradual outward flow of filed liquid. As per requirement, the 
additional solvent is augmented further to the point that percolates becomes almost 
three-quarters volume of the total finished product. The mixture is then added to 
the percolator. Clarification of mixed liquid is carried out via filtration. This method 
is frequently used for the separation of phytochemicals in the production of fluid 
extracts and medicines.
3.3.4 Digestion
This process involves the utilization of heat. The powdered plant material is mixed 
with extraction solvent in a container. The mixture is kept in an oven or water bath 
at 50°C. Heat is then applied throughout the process to enhance the solubility of sec￾ondary metabolites and reduce the viscosity of the extraction solvent. This method is 
suitable for readily soluble plant material.
3.3.5 Decoction
The process involves the usage of a specific volume of water and continuous heat. 
Well-dried, grinded, and powdered material is transferred into a glass container. 
Subsequently, water is poured and stirred. A constant supply of heat is ensured 
throughout the process to accelerate extraction. The whole process takes approxi￾mately 15 minutes. The concentration of solvent and the crude drug is maintained in 
the ratio of 4:1 or 16:1. Preferentially, it is used for the acquisition of heat-stable and 
water-soluble plant material (Sheikh et al, 2017).
3.3.6 Cold Extraction
In this method, dried plant powder is measured using a weighing balance, added 
into a glass flask alongside selected solvent, and stored at room temperature for 
seven days with constant shaking every 24 hours. Subsequently, filtration of the 
extract is carried out under vacuum via Whatman filter paper. The obtained extract 
is then dried completely using a rotary evaporator. The procured dried extract is 
then stored in firmly capped glass vials. The weight of the final extract is observed 42 NeuroPhytomedicine
by determining the difference between the weight of the extract before and after 
drying. The same procedure is applied thrice for maximum extraction (Kovačević
et al, 2018).
3.3.7 Soxhlet Extraction
This technique, also named hot continuous extraction, involves the plant samples 
enclosed in a porous bag, also called a “thimble,” composed of strong filter papers. 
It is then placed in the thimble chamber of the Soxhlet apparatus. The extraction 
solvent placed in the bottom flask is subjected to heating resulting in the emission 
of solvent vapors in the thimble chamber. Here they interact with plant samples 
and trickle down backward after condensation in the condensation chamber. The 
quality of this method is influenced by the speed of agitation, Temperature, and 
proportion of solvent sample employed. The main advantage of using this process 
is that it requires low concentrations of solvents. However, the emission of harm￾ful gases and their subsequent exposure imposes serious health threats (Palai and 
Shekhawat, 2022).
3.3.8 Microwave-assisted Extraction
The interaction between polar molecules (of sample and solvent), microwave radia￾tion, and the resultant transfer of heat via conduction form the basis of this method. 
Electromagnetic induction causes the rotation of polar molecules which results in 
the rupturing of the Hydrogen bond. Consequently, dissolved ions and penetration 
of solvents in samples are enhanced. However, the transfer of energy in non-polar 
solvents occurs via dielectric absorption which results in poor heating (Guntur et al, 
2018; Palai and Shekhawat, 2022).
The microwave-assisted extraction process is extremely advantageous in the way 
that it utilizes less volume of solvent and less time. However, it is quite limited in 
its application as it gives the best results with small-sized molecules such as isofla￾vin, gallic acid, and quercetin because of their stability against thermal degradation. 
Other large-sized molecules such as anthocyanin and tannins are not appropriate for 
it because of their susceptibility to degradation.
3.3.9 Ultrasound-assisted Extraction
Also known as sonication extraction employs ultrasound waves ranging from 20 to 
2000 kHz. Interaction between sample, solvent, and cell wall permeability is signifi￾cantly enhanced by Acoustic activation via intense ultrasound waves. The cell wall 
of plant cells is disrupted as it is exposed to ultrasound waves, causing the release of 
bioactive metabolites from the sample and subsequent entry of solvent into the plant 
cell. This method is quite advantageous because of its applicability at both large and 
small scale, cost-effective technology, less extraction time, and minimum solvent 
requirement. However, ultrasound waves higher than 20 kHz lead to free radical 
formation, thus causing the deterioration of active phytochemical constituents (Palai 
and Shekhawat, 2022; Tsao and Deng, 2004).Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 43
3.3.10 Accelerated Solvent Extraction
In this method, the plant sample is packed in an inert material like sand in the extrac￾tion cell which prevents aggregation of the sample and blockage of system tubes. The 
diffusion of organic solvents into the sample is accelerated by providing high tem￾perature and pressure. The extraction cell is filled swiftly under high pressure thus 
forcing liquid into the solid matrix. This method is preferable for phytochemical 
extraction because it uses a minimal amount of solvent, the temperature and pressure 
of each layer of the sample can be controlled, and extraction can be done within a 
period of less than an hour (Sarker and Oba, 2019).
3.3.11 Supercritical Fluid Extraction
Supercritical fluids are substances that manifest properties of liquid as well as solid 
at their critical point. Conditions of temperature and pressure at which liquid and 
vapor of a substance coexist are known as the critical point. In general, a supercriti￾cal fluid acts as a gas but also has the attributes of a liquid. A cylinder containing 
plant material is filled with supercritical fluid with the aid of a pump and the liquid￾containing extract is gathered in a separation chamber. Heat-sensitive compounds are 
often extracted and preserved using supercritical fluids. A major advantage of this 
method lies in the adjustability of solvent density. This implies that the properties of 
supercritical fluid could be altered by a change in temperature and pressure. They can 
also be tailored to facilitate selective extraction by changing the solvents such as etha￾nol or methanol. The demand for high-pressure and expensive equipment and high 
energy costs render this method ineffective for long-term usage (Yasmeen et al, 2018).
3.3.12 Deep Eutectic Solvents
Two or more chemicals are often bonded together via hydrogen bonds to give rise to 
a solvent with a melting point lower than that of its constituent parts. These solvents 
known as ionic liquid equivalents are custom-made with such properties that enable 
them to tackle limitations imposed by conventional ionic solvents such as toxic￾ity, high charge density, and higher melting points. The majority of these solvents 
commonly contain betaine derivatives or choline chloride which can associate with 
a versatile group of hydrogen donors such as carbohydrates, alcohols, sugars, and 
organic acids. These solvents have gained a lot of attention in recent years because of 
the myriad of benefits they offer such as biodegradability, convenient solvent prepa￾ration, cheap starting material, minimal toxicity, and adaptability. They are deemed 
as a greener substitute for toxic organic solvents utilized in conventional extraction 
methods and can also be tailored for the extraction of metabolites from plants as well 
as in food and pharmaceutical industries (Jakovljević et al, 2020; Ma et al, 2018).
3.3.13 Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE)
PLE is used for the extraction of phytochemicals using common solvents at controlled 
temperatures and pressure. A major advantage of PLE over conventional methods is 44 NeuroPhytomedicine
that solvents under high pressure are capable of staying in liquid form even when 
the temperature exceeds their boiling point thus allowing operation at high tem￾peratures. It has a quick extraction span and is often employed for the extraction of 
substances such as fatty acids and lipids from vegetable oil. It is also used for the 
extraction of small components which are prone to destruction at high temperatures 
such as phenols, sterols, anthocyanins, carotenoids, phospholipids, glycerides, and 
tocopherols. PLE is an advanced level technology and is beneficial in many aspects 
as it is quick, uses a low quantity of solvents, and provides higher yield. The rate of 
solvent diffusion and analyte solubility is enhanced alongside a decrease in surface 
tension and solvent viscosity. The automaticity of PLE makes quality control conve￾nient. Furthermore, extraction parameters could be altered and tailored according to 
the target component (Kovačević et al, 2018).
3.3.14 Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) Extraction
PEF is deemed a very promising method for the disruption of wet biomass as it 
does not require long and energy-intensive drying with concomitant loss of thermo￾labile chemicals. The principal goal of this technique is to disrupt cells thus enhanc￾ing membrane permeability and facilitating the higher mass transfer of liquid. It 
shortens operation time, enhances extraction yield, and results in a purer extract. 
PEF significantly enhances the extraction of water-soluble chemicals. The extraction 
efficacy is enhanced by energy input, electric field intensity, and pulse polarity. The 
rate of diffusion of phytochemicals is significantly enhanced at room temperature by 
electroporation of the plasma membrane.
A decrease in heat-sensitive chemical ruin and an upsurge in extraction yield as 
well as a reduction in energy expenses have an environmentally friendly impact. It 
is often used for the extraction of proteins, vitamins, carotenoids, proteins, inulin, 
oats, sucrose, etc. This method is preferred over conventional methods because of 
its environmental friendliness and also because it enables the selective release of 
metabolites without debris production by allowing penetration of solvent within the 
cell (Kovačević et al, 2018; Poojar et al, 2017).
3.4 FRACTIONATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNIQUES
Techniques and technologies for the isolation and purification of bioactive molecules 
have drastically improved and evolved. The aim of a researcher in quest of a novel 
biomolecule is to find a simple, precise, and fast method of extraction to screen out 
plant material for activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antidiabetic, 
anticancerous, etc. In vitro methods are preferred over in vivo assays because experi￾ments with animals are time taking, expensive, and vulnerable to ethical contro￾versies. The process of separation of a mixture of phytochemicals into numerous 
fractions is known as fractionation. Acquired fractions are periodically segregated 
further into several proportions till the isolation of pure compound. The addition of 
solvents must be done in the order of ascending polarities. Techniques for fraction￾ation are typically categorized into physical and chemical methods (Beulah et al, 
2022; Yasmeen et al, 2018) (Figure 3.2).Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 45
Chemical Method:
It is based upon the kind of functional group of compounds in the mixture. 
Purification of compounds can be achieved by chemical reactions using 
suitable reagents.
Physical Methods:
Physical methods used for the segregation of compounds are chromato￾graphic techniques, sublimation, separation funnel method, fractional dis￾tillation, fractional crystallization, and fractional liberation.
3.4.1 Separation Funnel Technique
This process begins with the selection of four different solvents such as chloroform, 
acetone, n-hexane, and n-butanol. Complete dissolution of the crude extract is done 
with 250 ml water. Subsequently, it is transferred to a separating funnel, stirred, and left 
to settle. Afterward, 250 ml of the least polar solvent (n-hexane) is added and stirred. 
The material is allowed to settle and the aqueous layer is removed by opening the bot￾tom of the separating funnel. The rest of the material is poured into another container to 
acquire the n-hexane fraction. The same process is repeated periodically with n-hexane 
until no substantial quantity of extract appears to dissolve in it. A similar process is 
repeated with remaining solvents to get acetone, n-butanol, and chloroform fractions. 
The portion left after fractionation is termed a residual aqueous fraction (RAF) as the 
water was used to dissolve crude extract for the very first time (Beulah et al, 2022).
3.4.2 Fractional Distillation
Fractional distillation is mostly used for the isolation of hydrocarbons like euca￾lyptol, crude oil, and citral. The difference in the boiling point of components of 
FIGURE 3.2 List of techniques used for the purification of phytochemicals.46 NeuroPhytomedicine
a mixture is manipulated to carry out their purification. This involves heating the 
mixture of liquid. The vapors formed move upward in a glass tube known as the 
fractionation column. Fractional distillation is preferred over simple distillation 
because glass beads present in the fractionation column provide a site for vapors 
to condense, re-evaporate and re-condense, allowing the distillation of compounds 
multiple times. The vapors will eventually reach the condenser where they liquefy 
and are gathered in a collection vessel (Velmurugan et al, 2018).
3.4.3 Fractional Crystallization
Fractional crystallization brings about the purification of compounds based on dif￾ferences in solubility. Fractionation is done via differences in their crystallization 
properties. If a mixture is allowed to crystallize by decreasing the temperature of the 
solution, the major portion of resulting precipitates will contain substances with low 
solubility. The value of solubility products will govern the proportion of components. 
For compounds with very similar solubility products, a cascade operation will be 
required to achieve complete separation. A large number of compounds exist in the 
form of crystals in plants. Their separation is actualized by the formation of crystals 
that occur during the process of concentration of a given extract via refrigeration or 
heating (Beulah et al, 2022).
3.4.4 Fractional Liberation
This method is used for the isolation of compounds that can form precipitates in the 
mixture. Precipitate formation usually occurs upon a change of compound in salt. 
For instance, when a mixture of alkaloid salts in an aqueous solution is allowed to 
react with an alkali, it will progressively release bases in ascending order of alkalin￾ity. The same principle is applied to the separation of organic acids that could dis￾solve in water-immiscible solvents. Separation of acids from the mixture is done via 
the addition of mineral acids. This technique is usually employed for the separation 
of cinnamon alkaloids (Gil-Martín et al, 2022).
3.4.5 Sublimation
The change of a substance directly from a solid to a gaseous state without passing 
through the central liquid phase is known as sublimation. Material such as volatile 
oils and camphor can convert directly into gas upon heating. A deposition is the 
reverse process of sublimation that involves a transition directly from the gas phase to 
the solid phase (Kovačević et al, 2018).
3.4.6 Chromatographic Techniques
Chromatography involves the isolation of compounds from a mixture based on their 
shape, size, and charge. It involves the use of two phases. One employs the use of 
solvent of extraction also known as the mobile phase and the other one is the station￾ary phase that contains substances like Sephadex blended with calcium sulfate as Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 47
a binder and silica gel. Sephadex is used for the purification of proteins and amino 
acids. Silica gel is utilized for the purification of sugars, fatty acids, lipids, alka￾loids, amino acids, and proteins. Aluminum is applied for the separation of phenols, 
steroids, alkaloids, lipids, and fatty acids. Celite for the separation of steroids and 
organic cations and cellulose powder for phenols, alkaloids, steroids, amino acids, 
and food dyes. Numerous mechanisms are utilized for the separation of compounds 
using chromatographic techniques such as ion exchange, adsorption, partition, affin￾ity, and size exclusion. Given below is a detailed description of each of these mecha￾nisms (Yasmeen et al, 2018).
3.4.6.1 Adsorption Chromatography
In this technique interaction between the compounds targeted for separation is 
manipulated. The stationary phase pulls compounds via non-covalent Van der Waal 
forces and hydrophobic interactions. The weakly bonded compounds will be eluted 
by the mobile phase at first and so on (Lavenburg et al, 2021).
3.4.6.2 Partition Chromatography
Partition chromatography involves the separation of compounds by adding two or 
more immiscible solvents into the mixture. Each of the constituents of the mixture 
will separate by dissolving in the solvent of relatable polarity. Afterward, individual 
compounds are obtained by separating the immiscible solvent via a separating fun￾nel (Guntur et al, 2018).
3.4.6.3 Affinity Chromatography (AC)
Separation of biomolecules from a mixture using AC is done based on macromo￾lecular binding between compounds. The stationary phase comprises a ligand and 
is placed in a separating column. Compounds with no affinity toward the stationary 
phase will be washed down by the mobile phase. Likewise, compounds with high 
affinity for the stationary phase will be attracted toward it and thus separated (Alara 
et al, 2018).
3.4.6.4 Ion Exchange Chromatography
Ion exchange chromatography is preferred for the separation of polar compounds 
based on the kind of charge they possess. As the principle goes; “Like attracts like.” 
Similar to other types of column-based liquid chromatography techniques, ion￾exchange chromatography, which is specifically intended for the separation of dif￾ferently charged or ionizable chemicals, consists of mobile and stationary phases. 
The combination to be resolved is placed into an aqueous buffer system in the 
mobile phase. The stationary phase is typically a chemically derivate of an inert 
organic matrix with ionizable functional groups (fixed ions) that can displace an 
opposing charged ion. Counter ions are ions that are in equilibrium between the 
stationary and mobile phases, giving birth to the two alternative formats of anion 
and cation exchange. Protons (H+), hydroxide groups (OH−), single-charged mono￾atomic ions (Na+, K+, Cl−), double-charged monoatomic ions (Ca2+, Mg2+), poly￾atomic inorganic ions (SO42−, PO43−), as well as organic bases (NR2H+) and acids, 
are examples of exchangeable matrix counter ions (COO−). On a column made of 48 NeuroPhytomedicine
cation-exchange resin, cations are separated from the anion. According to variations 
in their net surface charge, separation is based on the binding of analytes to posi￾tively or negatively charged groups that are immobilized on a stationary phase and 
that are in equilibrium with free counter ions in the mobile phase.
3.4.6.5 Size Exclusion Cchromatography
The chromatographic technique known as size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), 
also referred to as molecular sieve chromatography (MSC), separates molecules 
in solution based on their size and, in some situations, molecular weight. Proteins 
and commercial polymers are typical examples of big molecules or macromolecular 
complexes to which it is typically applied. The method is typically referred to as 
gel-filtration chromatography when an aqueous solution is used to move the sam￾ple through the column, as opposed to the name gel permeation chromatography, 
which is used when an organic solvent is employed as a mobile phase. Fine, porous 
beads that are frequently made of dextran, agarose, or polyacrylamide polymers are 
crammed into the chromatography column. The separation of compounds on the 
base of their size is actualized by using a mesh of different diameters. Separation is 
done in ascending order, that is, smaller size molecules are separated at first followed 
by the separation of medium and larger ones (Altemimi et al, 2017). The advan￾tages of this procedure include maintaining the biological activity of the particles 
to separate while providing effective separation of large molecules from small mol￾ecules with a small volume of eluate and the ability to use different solutions without 
interfering with the filtration process. The method is typically used in conjunction 
with others that further categorize molecules according to traits like charge, acidity, 
basicity, and affinity for particular chemicals. Since solutes don’t interact with the 
stationary phase, there is also no sample loss.
3.4.7 Types of Chromatography
3.4.7.1 Paper Chromatography (PC)
PC operates based on the mechanism of adsorption chromatography. The apparatus 
constitutes a stationary phase that comprises a filter paper synthesized from cel￾lulose and a glass chamber. The filter paper is hooked to the top and suspended in 
the glass chamber. The mixture is spotted at the bottom of the filter paper. This is 
followed by the addition of solvent in the container which will act as a mobile phase. 
The solvent will begin to travel upward; separation will occur during the upward 
movement of the solvent via capillary action. Soluble compounds will dissolve in 
the solvent and attach to filter paper according to their solubility. The speed of sepa￾ration is governed by the type of filter paper used. Traveling of mobile phase and 
separation is faster with thick filter paper while it becomes quite slow with porous 
filter paper. Identification of the isolated compound is done by determining the 
retardation factor, which is calculated by taking the ratio of the distance traversed 
by the compound to the distance traversed by the solvent. The main benefit of this 
technique lies in its cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and sensitivity to a quite small 
quantity of substances. Because of the fragility of filter paper which makes it prone 
to destruction by chemicals, long operation time, and difficulty in identification Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 49
and quantification, this technique is not used as frequently as before (Kumar and 
Khanum, 2012).
3.4.7.2 Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)
This purification technique also operates based on an adsorption mechanism. 
Separation is done on the base of the interaction between the stationary phase and 
compounds in the mixture. It is employed for the isolation of low-molecular-weight 
compounds. The stationary phase comprises a slurry made by mixing 100 g of silica 
gel with distilled water. However, Sephadex is also used in certain cases. The slurry 
is transferred to a glass plate with a dimension of 20 cm × 20 cm. It is then allowed 
to solidify at 105°C for 1 hour. This is followed by an injection of 10 ml of extract at 
the bottom of the plate. The plate is then transferred to a solvent separation chamber 
and kept for 30 minutes. The compounds in the mixture will travel upward at differ￾ent rates depending on their solubility. Identification of each segregated compound 
will be done by calculation of the retardation factor. The isolated compounds are 
scrapped using a spatula and re-extracted using numerous solvents. The benefits of 
using TLC include less operation time, stability to acids as solvents, and production 
of clear spots (Ghotekar et al, 2020).
3.4.7.3 Column Chromatography (CC)
CC is based upon several mechanisms such as molecular sieve, ion exchange, and 
adsorption chromatography. The column is composed of a long glass tube with an 
average length of 5 cm–1 m and a diameter of 5–50 mm. The bottom is lined with a 
filter made of tap and glass wool. Furthermore, Sephadex, cellulose, alumina, and 
silica gel act as stationary phases, and the mobile phase constitutes a solvent. A total 
of 30 g of silica gel is packed into a translucent glass column such that no air bubbles 
are formed. Afterward, the extract is poured into the column from the top. Solvents 
were added to increase polarity, starting from n-hexane to chloroform, ethyl acetate, 
n-butanol, and methanol. Fractions of each of these solvents were gathered at differ￾ent periods and then characterized (Tsao and Deng, 2004).
3.4.7.4 Gas Chromatography (GC)
As the name suggests, the mobile phase in GC is a carrier gas that is used to carry 
out the separation. Ideally, the carrier gas does not interact with the sample or harm 
the instrument’s parts while it moves the sample molecules through the GC system. 
A syringe or transfer from an auto-sampler that can also extract the chemical compo￾nents from solid or liquid sample matrices is used to first deliver the sample into the 
GC. A septum that allows for the injection of the sample mixture without losing the 
mobile phase is used to introduce the sample into the GC inlet. GC involves the use of 
two immiscible solvents: The mobile phase in gaseous form and the stationary phase 
comprising a liquid absorbed on the surface of an inert solvent. Compounds will dis￾solve in their respective phases according to their solubilities. The analytical column, 
a long (10–150 m), thin (0.1–0.53 mm internal diameter), fused silica or metal tube 
connected to the intake, holds the stationary phase coated on the interior walls. It is 
also connected to the inlet. The column oven in which the analytical column is kept 
is heated throughout the analysis to elute the less volatile components. The detector, 50 NeuroPhytomedicine
which responds to the chemical components eluting from the column by producing a 
signal, is put into the column outlet. To create a chromatogram, the acquisition soft￾ware on a computer records the signal. This procedure is often used for the purifica￾tion of plant material contaminated with volatile pesticides and is often employed in 
quality control testing. Regardless of sensitivity and high resolution, the use of GC is 
limited because the majority of plant compounds have low volatility. Moreover, it is 
difficult to apply for large-scale purification (Guntur et al, 2018).
3.4.7.5 HPLC
High-pressure pumps are used in HPLC, a type of column chromatography, to 
move a sample mixture or analyte through a column with chromatographic packing 
material (stationary phase). A helium or nitrogen-moving carrier gas stream carries 
the sample. Compounds that are present in any sample that may dissolve in a liquid 
at trace amounts as low as parts per trillion can be separated and identified using 
HPLC. Because of its adaptability, HPLC is utilized in a wide range of scientific, 
industrial, and medicinal fields, including forensics, the environment, and pharma￾ceuticals. This technique operates on the principle of adsorption and is appropriate 
for the separation of organic as well as inorganic compounds. The mobile phase 
employs the use of a solvent whereas the stationary phase is solid. Separation is 
actualized via interaction between particles of solid phase and mixture. The process 
commences with the application of a mixture at the bottom of HPLC, followed by the 
addition of solvent. The tap is then opened, allowing downward movement of solvent 
which is pushed via a pressure pump, thus mixing it with the mixture. Finally, the 
mixture travels to the diode detector, waste is removed, compounds are separated, 
and the refined content is transferred to further processing units (Jakovljević et al, 
2020). The interaction between the stationary phase, the molecules being examined, 
and the solvent or solvents utilized will affect sample retention time. Due to the 
different polarity of the analytes, the sample interacts between the two phases as it 
moves through the column at a different rate. Analytes that interact with the station￾ary phase less frequently or more frequently with the mobile phase will leave the 
column more quickly.
3.5 IDENTIFICATION OF PHYTOCHEMICALS
Techniques used for the identification of phytochemicals are based upon the detec￾tion of carbon and hydrogen configuration, identification of functional groups, and 
multiple bonds and rings present. These spectroscopic techniques provide sufficient 
information for quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of phytochemicals. These 
techniques are founded upon the principle that an organic molecule upon interaction 
with electromagnetic radiation absorbs waves of precise frequency according to its 
structure as a result of which a spectrum is formed. These spectrums are peculiar for 
functional groups, based on which the complete structure is laid out. Usually, spectra 
are formed in three or four regions, UV, infrared (IR), visible, radio frequency, and 
the electron beam employed. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), IR, 
UV, and mass spectroscopy (MS) are some of the most commonly used spectro￾scopic techniques (Eswaraiah et al, 2020) (Figure 3.3).Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 51
3.5.1 UV–Visible Spectroscopy
In the UV and the adjacent, adjoining visible region of the electromagnetic spec￾trum, absorption spectroscopy or reflectance spectroscopy is referred to as UV spec￾troscopy or UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV–Vis or UV/Vis). This methodology 
is frequently employed in a variety of practical and theoretical applications since it 
is reasonably affordable and simple to execute. The sample must only be a chromo￾phore and absorb in the UV-visible range. Fluorescence spectroscopy is enhanced 
by absorption spectroscopy. Aside from the measurement wavelength, variables of 
importance include absorbance (A), transmittance (%T), and reflectance (%R), as 
well as how they change over time. Identification of compounds both in the mixture 
and pure form can be done via UV-visible spectroscopy. It is preferably used for 
quantitative analysis as aromatic molecules are powerful chromophores in the UV 
range. Identification of numerous phytochemicals is carried out using this method 
via maximum absorption (λmax) values of their respective features, for instance, 
phenolic acids (360 nm), anthocyanins (520 nm), flavones (320 nm), and phenolic 
extract (280 nm). However, this technique is less discriminatory and gives informa￾tion about overall phenolic content. Observation by the mean of UV-visible spec￾troscopy takes very little time and is very cost-effective as well (Guntur et al, 2018). 
An HPLC detector is a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. When an analyte is present, a 
response that is thought to be proportional to concentration occurs. Similar to the use 
of calibration curves, the instrument’s reaction to the analyte in the unknown should 
be compared with the response to a standard for correct results. The term “response 
factor” refers to the response (for example, peak height) for a specific concentration. 
To identify the functional groups contained within a specific molecule, it is useful to 
link the wavelengths of absorption peaks with the different types of bonds present 
in that molecule. The Woodward–Fieser rules, for instance, are a set of empirical 
FIGURE 3.3 List of techniques used for the identification of phytochemicals.52 NeuroPhytomedicine
observations used to predict λmax, the wavelength of the most intense UV/Vis absorp￾tion, for conjugated organic compounds such as dienes and ketones. However, the 
spectrum by itself does not serve as a precise diagnostic for any particular sample. 
The absorption spectrum can be affected by the kind of solvent, the pH of the solu￾tion, temperature, high electrolyte concentrations, and the presence of interfering 
compounds. The spectrum will also be affected by experimental changes like the 
spectrophotometer’s effective bandwidth (slit width). To identify the compounds 
present, these variables must be regulated or taken into account when using UV/Vis 
spectroscopy for examination (Guntur et al, 2018).
3.5.2 Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
IR spectroscopy, also known as vibrational spectroscopy, aims to identify a number 
of bonds and the functional group present in a given compound. This helps in the 
elucidation of the physical and chemical properties of the compounds. The organic 
compound is allowed to pass through IR radiations where it is absorbed at a particu￾lar frequency. It detects the changes in vibration produced upon elongation and bend￾ing of the molecules upon interaction with the IR range of electromagnetic radiation. 
Various chemical bonds and functional groups have a characteristic vibrational 
frequency governed by the values of force constant (bond strength) and decreased 
mass. Therefore, analysis of the frequency absorption band on the IR spectrum of the 
respective functional group can be manipulated to determine the structure of a bio￾active compound. Identification of solid samples is done by milling with potassium 
bromide and compressing it into a thin pellet whereas that of liquid samples is done 
using sodium chloride plates. An even high-resolution of constituent chemicals and 
elucidation of molecular structure can be performed using Fourier transform infra￾red spectroscopy (FTIR) (Guntur et al, 2018).
3.5.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)
Identification using NMR is done by elucidating physical properties such as the 
arrangement of atoms and molecules in a compound, the total count and array of 
carbon atoms, and the identification of isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, and protons. 
Magnetic properties of certain nuclei, for instance, 19F, 1H, 13C, and 31P can be 
determined using NMR. Interaction of magnetically active nuclei with the radio 
frequency range of electromagnetic radiations generates a signal with a frequency 
similar to the one that will be produced upon application of an external magnetic 
field resonance will be produced upon equivalence of oscillation frequency with 
intrinsic frequency. Its measurement is commonly done in terms of chemical shift, 
governed by the chemical environment, magnetic properties of nuclei, and power of 
the applied magnetic field (Tsao and Deng, 2004). NMR is a tool used by biochem￾ists to identify complicated compounds such as proteins. NMR spectroscopy offers 
comprehensive details about the structure, dynamics, reaction state, and chemical 
environment of molecules in addition to molecular identification. Proton and car￾bon-13 NMR spectroscopy are the two most popular types of NMR, but they can 
be used with any sample that has nuclei with spin. For minuscule compounds, NMR Novel Extraction and Characterization Methods 53
spectra are distinctive, sharp, analytically manageable, and frequently very predict￾able. Different functional groups can be easily distinguished from one another and 
signals can still be distinguished between identical functional groups with differ￾ent adjacent substituents. NMR has essentially taken the place of conventional wet 
chemistry tests for identification like color reagents or usual chromatography. The 
requirement of a relatively significant dose of a purified drug, ranging from 2 to 
50 mg, notwithstanding the possibility of recovery through a workup, is a draw￾back. The sample should ideally be dissolved in a solvent because solids cannot be 
analyzed by NMR without spinning equipment, which may result in less accurately 
resolved spectra. NMR produces only an averaged spectrum because its timeframe 
is relatively long, making it unsuitable for viewing rapid processes. Although sig￾nificant levels of contaminants do appear on an NMR spectrum, better methods for 
identifying impurities already exist because NMR is intrinsically not very sensitive, 
though sensitivity increases at higher frequencies (Tsao and Deng, 2004).
3.5.4 Mass Spectroscopy (MS)
MS is used for the detection of compounds based on their molecular weight and 
chemical structure. Substances like oligonucleotides and peptides are usually identi￾fied. It involves the conversion of organic molecules into highly energized charged 
species by bombarding them either with lasers or electrons. The electron ionization 
energy of 70 eV was first used to detect the signal. Moreover, the percentage peak 
of sample spectra is detected and recorded. A mass spectrum is a graph of the mass/
charge ratio of ions against the relative abundance of fragmented ions. The relative 
molecular mass of detached ions along with the site of detachment can be deter￾mined which can be further utilized for the prediction of the molecular formula of 
bioactive compound. Henceforth, MS provides sufficient information required for 
structure determination. MS coupled with electrospray ionization (for producing 
charged species from macromolecules) has been proven to be a very efficient tool for 
the structural elucidation of phenolic compounds. MS provides plenty of information 
about organic molecules and is a preferred procedure for the identification of medici￾nal plant constituents, especially when coupled with HPLC (Beulah et al, 2022).

The Neuroprotective 
Effect of Alkaloids and 
Synthetic Derivatives

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Natural products are an essential element in the development of human civilisa￾tion. Mankind uses a variety of plant parts, extracts and phytoconstituents for 
the treatment of numerous diseases and ailments. Various traditional medicinal 
systems, treaties and folklores have emphasised the importance of phytomedicines. 
Phytomedicines are plants and their originated products with some healing and 
therapeutic properties (Petrovska, 2012). The plants are a rich source of a variety of 
secondary metabolites produced for signalling, defence and other functions. 
Alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, tannins and saponins are abundantly found in flora 
across the globe, especially in flowering plants. Alkaloids are one of the significant 
classes which have numerous uses along with medicinal benefits. These are small 
molecular nitrogenous natural products with basic nature. The compounds bear het￾erocyclic rings along with a carbon skeleton with at least one nitrogen. These are 
classified as true, pseudo and proto alkaloids and other classifications based on their 
phytochemical and therapeutic use (Kurek, 2019). The various nitrogenous rings, viz. 
pyrrolidine, tropane, pyrrolizidine, piperidine, quinolizidine, indolizidine, pyridine, 
isoquinoline, thiazole, quinoline, indole, imidazole, purines and others, constitute 
various alkaloidal skeleton. An estimate suggests that about 25% of higher plants 
contain alkaloids and several thousand types have been identified to date (Dewick 
Paul, 2009). Alkaloids are present in almost every plant part, including bark, leaf, 
root, stem and flowers. Various plant families, viz. Ranunculaceae, Solanaceae, 
Papaveraceae and Amaryllidaceae, are predominantly rich in alkaloids (Cushnie 
et al, 2014). The alkaloids show a broad spectrum of biological activities, including 
hypoglycaemic, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, cardioprotective, anti-cancer, anti￾bacterial, antiasthma, vasodilatory, antifibrosis, anti-tussive actions, etc. (Adamski 
et al, 2020). The alkaloids, such as codeine caffeine (central nervous system [CNS] 
stimulant), (anti-tussive), morphine (painkillers), quinine (antimalarial), sanguina￾rine (antibacterial), galantamine and physostigmine (anti-Alzheimer agents), vin￾blastine and vincristine (anti-cancer) are used in modern medicine.
Alkaloids are one of the critical components of treatments for various CNS 
diseases and disorders, viz. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), schizophrenia, depression 
456 NeuroPhytomedicine
and others. Alteration and imbalance in neurotransmitters lead to the path for the 
pathogenesis of various neurological disorders (Ressler and Nemeroff, 2000). The 
alkaloids bear chemical structures like indole, tyrosine, imidazole and phenyl ethyl 
amine, which resemble the substrate precursor for neurotransmitters such as dopa￾mine, serotonin, adrenaline and acetylcholine (ACh). Hence, they have a greater 
CNS effect compared to other secondary plant metabolites (Debnath et al, 2018). 
Vast preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted on alkaloids for their neu￾roprotective effects. Some important plant extracts rich in alkaloids are listed in 
Table 4.1.
Neurodegeneration is a detrimental phenomenon involving neuronal dam￾age and ultimately death. The progression involves various physical, toxic, envi￾ronmental and infection-related causes. Excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
toxin buildup, abnormal protein aggregation, impaired voltage-sensitive sodium and

calcium channel, impaired gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibi￾tion lysosomal dysfunction, membrane damage, DNA damage, hampered axonal 
transport and oxidative stress are some of the factors leading to neurodegeneration 
(Vajda, 2002b). Neuroprotection results in the rescue, recovery or regeneration of the 
nervous system, its cells and its function (Vajda, 2002a). The neuroprotective mech￾anism involved the prevention of aggregation of misfolded proteins, improper mito￾chondrial functioning, modulation of the functioning of various ion channels and 
reducing Ca2+, glutamate and other toxin-mediated excitotoxicity. The prevention of 
apoptosis mediated via caspases inhibition, amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide disaggregation, 
Bcl-2 family modulation, p53 gene inhibition and heat-shock proteins activation also 
renders neuroprotection (Papaliagkas et al, 2007).
The current chapter aims to describe the numerous neuroprotective actions of 
alkaloids and their synthetic derivatives by various pathways, including antioxidant, 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), kinase, receptor inhibition, modulation 
of synthesis and metabolism of the neurotransmitter, enzymatic inhibition and anti￾inflammatory activity.
4.2 NEUROPROTECTIVE ALKALOIDS
4.2.1 Atropine
Atropine (1) is a tropane alkaloid obtained from plants of the Solanaceae fam￾ily and possesses a neuroprotective effect (Kohnen-Johannsen and Kayser, 2019). 
Atropine sulphate, when used in combination with ketamine, displayed an antiepi￾leptic effect along with neuroprotection in the status epilepticus model induced by 
soman gas in rats. The administration of atropine sulphate (10 mg/kg i.p.) reduced 
neutrophil granulocyte infiltration and glial activation in mice, resulting in the 
elimination of neuroinflammation (Dhote et al, 2012). Toluene disrupts cerebral 
cortex and striatal cholinergic neurotransmission leading to cognitive impair￾ments in Sprague-Dawley rats. Atropine (2 mg/kg i.p.) improved the antioxidant 
defence of the brain by elevation of glutathione (GSH) levels and reduced malo￾ndialdehyde (MDA) levels leading to improved memory and cognitive functions in 
toluene-induced neurodegeneration (Abdel-Salam et al, 2020). Interestingly, some 
contrasting results were also reported, viz. atropine administered at the doses of 10 
and 100 mg/kg in mice and rats for seven days, respectively, resulting in recogni￾tion memory deficit evaluated by Y-maze and novel object recognition test. Further, 
the histopathological findings confirmed neural cell death by the presence of large 
nuclear fragmentation in the frontal cortex and distortion of the granular layer that 
led to neurodegeneration. The findings raised the question of using atropine as a 
neuroprotective in clinical studies (Enye et al, 2017; Olawepo et al, 2017). Similarly, 
scopolamine (2), another tropane alkaloid clinically used as an anticholinergic 
medication for postoperative nausea and vomiting, worsens the psychotic symp￾toms and reduces gastric motility. Recently, scopolamine attracted more attention 
due to its neurodegenerative effect and close monitoring is suggested while dealing 
with scopolamine (Riad and Hithe, 2021). The chemical structures of the neuropro￾tective alkaloids are presented in Figure 4.1.58 NeuroPhytomedicine
4.2.2 Berberine
Berberine (3) is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in several plants, with its highest con￾centration reported in Coptidis rhizoma. The oral administration of berberine at a dose 
of 200 mg/kg easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with its bioavailability after 
12 h of administration in the brain. Such findings promoted the exploration of the neu￾roprotective potential of berberine (Tan et al, 2013). Besides the antioxidant activity, 
berberine is profoundly used to treat several neurodegenerative diseases. Berberine has 
FIGURE 4.1 Structure of neuroprotective alkaloids.The Neuroprotective Effect of Alkaloids and Synthetic Derivatives 59
displayed anti-ageing activity in Drosophila melanogaster, which is mediated via the 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and oxidative stress modulation (Xu 
et al, 2017). The treatment of berberine (25 and 100 mg/kg) in a transgenic TgCRND8 
mice model of AD reduced glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β expression and Aβ
plaque formation. The neuroprotective effect in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells was 
exerted by suppressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau hyperphosphorylation 
mediated through Akt/GSK-3β signalling (Durairajan et al, 2012).
The administration of mercury, aluminium, cadmium and fluoride for 90 days 
in rats in varying doses (20–50 mg/kg) releases free radicals and pro-inflammatory 
mediators that induce neurotoxicity and cell death through Aβ and tau hyper￾phosphorylation. Berberine neutralised the free radicals activity resulting in a reduc￾tion of oxidative stress, which further mediated the anti-inflammatory response and 
anticholinergic activity against heavy metals-induced neurotoxicity (Abdel Moneim, 
2015; Hussien et al, 2018). Zhou et al explained the role of berberine in neuropro￾tection through in vitro and in vivo stroke models. In the middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke, berberine immensely reduced infarct volume. 
An increased release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) is a prominent feature of mitochon￾drial dysfunction. In oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced cellular injury in 
PC12 cells, berberine (1–4 μM) significantly improved cell survival and prevented 
apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial Cyt c release rendering neuroprotection (Zhou 
et al, 2008). Berberine also provides neuroprotective action via modulation of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in diabetic neuropa￾thy by decreasing mRNA expression of neuritin, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 
in streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats (Zhou et al, 2016). The 
mechanism of actions of major alkaloids is presented in Figure 4.2.
FIGURE 4.2 Neuroprotective mechanism of various alkaloids.60 NeuroPhytomedicine
4.2.3 Boldine
Boldine (4) is an aporphine alkaloid obtained from the plant Peumus boldus Molina
belonging to the family Monimiaceae. The research on boldine was started in 1950 
due to its high abundance in Chilean boldo trees. The majority of studies reported 
that boldine is a strong antioxidant and responsible for its neuroprotective actions 
(de Lima et al, 2017; Konrath et al, 2008; Yi et al, 2017). Boldine has a cytoprotec￾tive action and is widely screened against numerous animal models of cancer and 
infectious diseases. It attenuates synaptic failure and mitochondrial dysfunctions in 
the cellular model of primary hippocampal neurons and HT22 cells. In this study, 
intracellular Ca+2 levels were restored to normal levels on treatment with boldine in 
the presence of Aβ oligomers. Boldine also decreased Aβ aggregation, restored mito￾chondrial membrane potential by maintaining mitochondrial Ca+2 levels and reduced 
lipid peroxidation, which improved neuronal viability (Toledo et al, 2021). Boldine 
has been extensively studied for the modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative 
stress for neuroprotective actions. In the MCAO-induced stroke model and pentyl￾enetetrazol-induced epilepsy model of rats and mice, respectively, boldine improved 
the behavioural parameters via nuclear factor kappa B (NFκβ) inhibition, reduction 
in the MDA levels and elevating antioxidant enzyme levels, thus proven to be effec￾tive in stroke and epilepsy through its neuroprotective action (de Lima et al, 2017).
4.2.4 Caffeine
Caffeine (5) is the most widely used constituent by humans in their day-to-day life, 
obtained from Coffea arabica belonging to the family Rubiaceae. Its products have 
gained popularity globally due to central stimulatory actions. Higher doses of caf￾feine cause inhibition of GABA and affect the mood of animals and humans in a 
dose-dependent manner. The regular normal dose of caffeine for humans is limited 
to 750 mg/kg. The intravenous administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) attenuated cere￾bral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats by modulation of oxidative stress and 
inflammatory mediators viz tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, 
IL-6 and IL-8 secretion and reduced the injury (Sun et al, 2013). Caffeine at a dose of 
10 mg/kg p.o. restored the striatal dopamine levels in 6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA)-
induced lesioned rats and protected the neurons (Machado-Filho et al, 2014). In 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine (MPTP)-subjected C57 BALB/c mice, 
the striatal dopaminergic neurons were protected by caffeine (30 mg/kg p.o) which 
diminished the MPTP activity in the brain of mice (Bagga et al, 2016).
4.2.5 Galantamine
Galantamine (6) is a tetracyclic alkaloid obtained from Galanthus nivalis belong￾ing to the family Amaryllidaceae. Galantamine has gained popularity in research 
for its BBB permeability and availability in the brain due to its low polarity index. 
Galantamine was the first compound from plants to treat cognitive deficits, dementia 
and AD. It was found that galantamine is a strong neuroprotective agent and has 
a therapeutic effect on multiple neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease The Neuroprotective Effect of Alkaloids and Synthetic Derivatives 61
(PD), AD, stroke, epilepsy and Huntington’s disease. Elevated kynurenine in the hip￾pocampus showed psychotic, depressive episodes and cognitive decline. The intra￾prefrontal cortex (PFC) infusion of galantamine, alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (α7nAChRs) positive modulator, improved the cognitive deficit in kyn￾urenine-induced cognitive deficit in rats (Alexander et al, 2012). N-methyl-D￾aspartate (NMDA)-induced neurotoxicity is one of the plausible causes of AD. 
Galantamine (5 μM) and also in combination with memantine protects rat cortical 
neurons. The study showed that the synergistic effect of combinatorial therapy is 
much more effective in AD as compared to memantine and prevents neurodegen￾eration and neurotoxicity (Lopes et al, 2013). Besides the combination therapy for 
AD, galantamine was also explored in the form of chitosan-loaded nanoparticles 
for AD through its antioxidant activity. The rat brain homogenate suggested that 
intranasal galantamine nanoparticles were found to be effective in AD and were 
nontoxic for 30 days of administration, which makes it a safe therapy (Kandil et al, 
2021). Kainic acid, a strong neurotoxin, is well known for neuronal degeneration 
in the CA3 and CA4 regions of the rat brain. Kainic acid majorly affects the ento￾rhinal area of the brain which results in cognitive loss and AD. Galantamine was 
tested against the intrahippocampal kainic acid (0.4 μg/2 μl)-induced mitochondrial 
dysfunction and cholinesterase overactivity leading to a cognitive deficit in Wistar 
rats. Galantamine (2.5 mg/kg p.o) potentiates the protective effects of rofecoxib and 
caffeic acid. Mechanistically, galantamine balanced the oxidative stress reflected in 
increased antioxidant status and reduced inflammatory mediators along with inhibi￾tory activity on NFκβ (Kumar et al, 2011).
4.2.6 Harmine
Harmine (7) is a β-carboline alkaloid obtained from Peganum harmala, Zygophyllaceae. 
Harmine and its derivatives gained popularity worldwide due to their broad spectrum 
of pharmacological activities. Several in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies were per￾formed for the exploration of its activities and elucidation of the mechanism. The array 
of multifactorial activities of harmine strongly prevents neurodegeneration. It attenu￾ates ethanol-induced neurodegeneration and sodium nitrite-induced memory deterio￾ration. The protective mechanism was due to the modulation of acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE) activity and oxidative stress, which directly inhibits the deterioration of mito￾chondrial functions (Biradar et al, 2013). Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity affects 
neuronal events are a well-known cause of neurodegeneration. Glutamate transporters 
1 (GLT-1) have been documented previously for their role in stroke, AD and cere￾bral ischemia. Harmine was tested on a four-vessel occlusion model of global cerebral 
ischemia (GCI) characterised by excessive glutamate release from neurons. Harmine 
(30 mg/kg i.p.) attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity by elevation of GLT-1 expression 
leading to reduce glutamate accumulation in the synaptic cleft. The increased GLT-1 
mRNA expression by harmine would be a possible mechanism of neuroprotection in 
cerebral ischemia (Sun et al, 2014). Harmine was evaluated in the learning and mem￾ory deficit induced by the traumatic brain injury (TBI) model. TBI significantly causes 
glutamate excitotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine elevations. Harmine (30 mg/kg 
i.p.) effectively protects memory functions in rats. It also reduced the inflammatory 62 NeuroPhytomedicine
mediators stimulated by astrocytes in the hippocampus and improved GLT-1 expres￾sion. The study suggested that harmine attenuates inflammation which may syner￾gistically reduce extracellular glutamate and generate cognition-enhancer effects 
(Zhong et al, 2015). Moreover, harmine attenuated rotenone-induced parkinsonism 
in rats mediated by behavioural and antioxidant effects and was found to improve 
striatal dopamine levels (El Madani et al, 2016). It is well established that BDNF 
and tyrosine-protein kinase (trkB) signalling role in cognitive functions. STZ induces 
diabetes and also produces cognitive deficits in rats via activation of the NLR family 
pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and might be responsible for numerous neuro￾logical disorders. Harmine ameliorates the learning memory and cognitive effects 
via inhibition of NLRP3. Notably, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition can upregulate 
BDNF expression by suppressing IL-1β, resulting in neuroprotective effects (Liu et al, 
2020). Further, the in vitro evaluation of harmine on PC12 neuronal cells also showed 
neuroprotection. Harmine-mediated regulated α-synuclein homeostasis through posi￾tive modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in PC12 neuronal cells (Cai et al, 
2019). Clinical studies using proteomics also supported that harmine promotes vesicle 
formation, axonal transport and neurotrophin signalling pathway for neuroprotection 
(Karmirian et al, 2021).
4.2.7 Huperzine
Huperzine (8) is a constituent of H. serrata (Thunb.) Trevis. (Lycopodiaceae). In 
China, Huperzia serrata has been used for centuries to treat a variety of diseases. 
Previously conducted studies on the brain pharmacokinetics of huperzine found that 
high BBB permeability, multi-target therapeutics actions and good cerebral concen￾tration make it a potential lead for brain illnesses (Chen et al, 2019). Huperzine 
showed a protective role on SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo study indicated that the huper￾zine treatment increased antioxidant activity and restored the cognitive functions 
impaired by scopolamine (Dang et al, 2023). It has been reported that eight weeks 
of treatment of huperzine in patients with AD alleviates cognitive symptoms. The 
neuroprotective effects of huperzine result from the inhibition of AChE, increased 
BDNF expression, NMDA antagonism and reactive oxidative species (ROS) neu￾tralisation, leading to neuronal survival (Gul et al, 2019). Huperzine provided pro￾tection for NSC34, neuroblastoma spinal motor cells, against cell death induced by 
staurosporine, thapsigargin and H2O2. The results significantly improved by 17.15%, 
35.0% and 10.38% when the cultures were pre-treated with huperzine (10 µM) for 
2 h (Hemendinger et al, 2008). Glutamate intoxication insults reduce cell viability, 
increase caspase-3 activity, a marker for apoptosis, and reduce neurotrophin expres￾sion reflected by reduced BDNF levels. Huperzine alleviated glutamate intoxication 
in mouse HT22 cells and reduced oxidative stress, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
and improved cell viability. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signal￾ling pathway is involved in neuroprotective action of huperzine. Huperzine reversed 
glutamate toxicity by activating BDNF/TrkB that further activates the PI3K/Akt sig￾nalling pathway, subsequently contributing to neuronal survival (Mao et al, 2016). 
Huperzine mediates neuroprotective effect by an anti-inflammatory mechanism in 
the MCAO rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Huperzine (0.1 mg/kg) The Neuroprotective Effect of Alkaloids and Synthetic Derivatives 63
improved cognitive functions and reduced infarction size. It inhibited the activity of 
NFκβ and AChE and decreased the overexpression of proinflammatory mediators. 
The increased synaptic ACh concentration rendered cholinergic anti-inflammatory 
effect (Wang et al, 2008).
4.2.8 Koumine
Koumine (9) is an indole alkaloid with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. 
It has shown an anti-allodynic effect in rats against STZ-induced neuropathy with 
increased sensory nerve conduction velocity and reduced damage to axonal myelin 
structure. Koumine was effective at a dose of 7 mg/kg with repetitive administration 
(Ling et al, 2014). In another study, strychnine mediated blocked of mRNA expression 
of 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (3α-HSOR) was increased by Koumine in pri￾mary spinal neuronal culture. The radioligand binding study indicated that the alka￾loid occupied the strychnine binding site at the glycine receptor and probably acted as 
an orthosteric agonist. It activated the 3α-HSOR/allopregnanolone pathway produc￾ing an anti-allodynic effect (Shoaib et al, 2019). Another independent study also con￾firmed the induction of 3α-HSOR by koumine in a neuropathic pain model (Qiu et al, 
2015). In chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathy, koumine reduced the 
astroglia activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. It also induced autophagy 
which was evident by the LC3-II/I ratio reduction and reduced P62 expression that 
inhibited apoptosis. The increased expression of Bcl-xl with decreased Bax expres￾sion and caspase-3 cleavage was also observed. Further, koumine decreased the 
astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 
enhanced autophagy in primary astrocyte culture (Jin et al, 2018). Koumine also 
reduced the M1 microglial polarisation and Notch-recombination signal-binding 
protein Jκ signalling in diabetic neuropathic pain induced by STZ in rats (Jin et al, 
2021). In the postoperative pain model, koumine displayed reduced allodynia and 
thermal hyperalgesia. It reduced the expression of cytokines and inhibition of astro￾cytes and microglial activation, resulting in neuroprotection (Xiong et al, 2017).
4.2.9 Lobeline
Lobeline (10), a pyridine alkaloid, has displayed a broad spectrum of activity. 
Lobeline displayed neuroprotective activity in the pilocarpine-induced seizure in 
mice. It resulted in reduced DNA damage and cleavage induced by pilocarpine in 
the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The free radical level was also found to be 
reduced along with an increased catalase (CAT) activity rendering additional neu￾roprotection (da Costa e Silva et al, 2018). In MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, lobeline 
has displayed a reduced motor deficit in mice. The tyrosine hydroxylase immuno￾histochemistry of substantia nigra and striatum showed reduced immunoreactivity 
indicating the neuroprotective mechanism of lobeline (Li et al, 2014). Similarly, the 
neuroprotective effect of lobeline was also established in methamphetamine-induced 
toxicity in the striatal region of the rat. It reversed a decreased level of synaptosomal, 
membrane-associated and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 with an increase in 
dopamine level (Eyerman and Yamamoto, 2005).64 NeuroPhytomedicine
4.2.10 17 Oxo Sparteine
17 Oxo Sparteine (11) has shown a neuroprotective effect in PC12 cells and hip￾pocampal neurons against toxicity caused by soluble Aβ oligomers. However, the 
neuroprotection was completely reversed by α-bungarotoxin. The alkaloid increased 
the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients and Akt phosphorylation. It indi￾cated that the neuroprotection was mediated by the activation of nAChR (Gavilan 
et al, 2019).
4.2.11 Papaverine
Papaverine (12), a poppy alkaloid, is obtained from opium and has anti-spasmodic 
properties. However, in MPTP/LPS-induced neurodegeneration in mice, papav￾erine led to reduced inflammasome activation, thereby suppressing mature IL-1β
expression. Additionally, it inhibited NF-κβ and enhanced the activity of the cAMP￾response element binding protein (CREB), providing neuroprotection (Leem et al, 
2021). The in vitro study on BV2 microglial cells challenged with LPS showed the 
induction of proinflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase 
(iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)). The treatment with papaverine resulted in 
the suppression of Il1rn, Socs3, Nos2 and Ptgs2 genes and reduced expression of 
IL-1β and TNF-α (Dang et al, 2016). In another study, the level of proinflamma￾tory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) was reduced after treatment with papaverine in 
LPS-challenged BV2 microglial cells. It also enhanced cAMP level and CREB phos￾phorylation. Further, a similar neuroprotective effect of papaverine was observed in 
the LPS-induced neuroinflammation and MPTP-induced PD model in mice leading 
to reduced dopaminergic neuronal cell death (Lee et al, 2019). In another indepen￾dent study on MPTP-induced PD model in rats, papaverine ameliorated microglia/
astrocyte activation in the striatum and substantia nigra. Further, α-synuclein expres￾sion and aggregation were also reduced, rendering neuroprotection (Leem et al, 
2020). In the TBI model, papaverine reduced the receptor for advanced glycation 
end products (RAGE) positive glial cells and the number of NF-κB positive neurons 
and glia. It also increased NeuN-positive cells and reduced neuroinflammation and 
apoptosis (Saglam et al, 2021). Interestingly, papaverine afforded neuroprotection in 
sepsis-induced critical illness neuropathy. It significantly attenuated levels of lactic 
acid, MDA TNF-α, C-reactive protein, IL-6 and HMGB1, along with improved neu￾ronal conduction observed in the electrophysiological study (Solmaz et al, 2022). In 
quinolinic acid-induced excitotoxicity, papaverine increased cAMP and NAD+ levels 
in cortical neuronal cells. It restored mitochondrial membrane potential and upregu￾lated the expression of BDNF, CREB and synaptic proteins. It also decreased ROS 
and caspase 3/7 levels rendering neuroprotection (Bhat et al, 2021).
4.2.12 Piperine
Piperine (13) is a piperidine alkaloid obtained from black pepper and other species 
of the Piperaceae family. It is popular for its neuroprotective effects due to its high 
permeability and low toxicity. In the MPTP-induced PD model, piperine displayed The Neuroprotective Effect of Alkaloids and Synthetic Derivatives 65
a neuroprotective effect without any decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells 
in the substantia nigra. Additionally, piperine reduced activated microglia, IL-1β
expression and oxidative stress. The balance of Bcl-2/Bax also indicated the anti￾apoptotic property (Yang et al, 2015). In another study, the pretreatment with piper￾ine exerted a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced toxicity and apoptosis 
in hippocampal neurons (Fu et al, 2010). The striatal lesions were also decreased on 
the treatment with piperine, along with reduced levels of TNF-α and iNOS in the 
6-OHDA-induced PD model of Wistar rats (Correia et al, 2015). Piperine showed 
neuroprotection against permanent MCAO injury in rats. It causes inhibition of Bax 
with upregulated Bcl-2 expression. The apoptotic proteins, Caspase-3, Caspase-9 
and Cyt-c, were downregulated upon treatment (Hua et al, 2019). In the transient 
MCAO model, piperine suppressed mitochondrial dysfunctioning and prevented Cyt 
c release and caspase-3 activation (Kaushik et al, 2021). Piperine also reduced demy￾elination and immune cell infiltration as well as astrocyte and microglia activation in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. It also reduced IL-1β, TNF-α
and iNOS and enhanced HO-1, IL-10, Nrf2 and MBP expression. The anti-apoptotic 
effect of piperine was established through reduced caspase-3 expression along with 
increased BDNF and NeuN-expressing cells (Nasrnezhad et al, 2021). In the kainic 
acid-induced excitotoxicity model, piperine reduced the level of matrix metallopro￾teinase (MMP) 9, an enzyme responsible for nerve growth factor (NGF) degrada￾tion. The treatment also increased the expression of pro-NGF processing enzyme 
MMP-7 along with NGF and NGF-activated receptor TrkA in the rat hippocampus. 
This indicated that piperine has a neuroprotective effect (Hsieh et al, 2022). Piperine 
also mitigated corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity, decreased ROS and reversed 
the reduced expression of BDNF mRNA in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) 
cells (Mao et al, 2012).
4.2.13 Protopine
Protopine (14) is an opium poppy alkaloid with benzylisoquinoline ring in the struc￾ture. Protopine prevented cell death of PC12 cells from H2O2 with an increase in 
the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT and glutathione peroxidase (GP). It 
reversed the raised intracellular Ca+2 concentration and altered mitochondrial mem￾brane potential along with the anti-apoptotic effect produced by the downregulation 
of caspase-3 expression (Xiao et al, 2008). Protopine also decreased the infarction 
area and serum LDH level in the MCAO model in rats. The neuroprotective activity 
was indicated by increased serum SOD activity and decreased Ca+2 level and termi￾nal dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the affected neuronal cells 
(Xiao et al, 2007).
4.2.14 Skimmianine
Skimmianine (15) is a furoquinoline alkaloid usually present in plants of the 
Rutaceae family. In LPS-activated BV-2 microglia, the treatment of skimmianine 
increased the phosphorylation of NF-κβ/p65 and Iκβα proteins and interfered with 
NF-κβ binding. Further, the increased MAO-2 expression was observed in HT-22 66 NeuroPhytomedicine
cells activated by microglia-conditioned media due to skimmianine treatment indi￾cating its neuroprotective potential (Ogunrinade et al, 2023).
4.2.15 Solasodine
Solasodine (16) is an anti-oxidant glycoalkaloid present in Solanum species. In I/R￾injury rat model, solasodine showed a marked decrease in neuronal damage with a 
significant increase in SOD, CAT, GSH and total thiols (Sharma et al, 2014). It also 
reduced glutamate-induced excitotoxicity of PC12 cells. However, the alkaloid did 
not prevent cell death due to glucose deprivation and mitochondrial damage (García￾Pupo et al, 2016).
4.2.16 Tomatine and Tomatidine
Tomatine (17) and tomatidine (18) are the steroidal alkaloids present in tomatoes. 
Tomatidine has shown neuroprotective activity by alleviating injury oxygen-glucose 
deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R) in mice cortical neurons and N2a cells. 
It induced autophagy by increasing the number of lysosomes rather than through 
autophagosome formation. The proteolytic activity and levels of Cathepsin B and 
D were raised in the cells. It also increased the expression and nuclear translocation 
of transcription factor EB (TFEB) (Ahsan et al, 2020). In another study, tomatine 
and tomatidine reduced glutamate-induced toxicity on SH-SY5Y cells and rendered 
neuroprotection. The mitochondrial membrane potential also remained unaltered in 
AGS, Caco-2 and SH-SY5Y cells after the treatment. Further, the ROS levels were 
decreased in SH-SY5Y cells (Taveira et al, 2014). Tomatine has shown a neuropro￾tective effect against H2O2 insult on SH-SY5Y cells. It raised anti-oxidant enzyme 
levels and BNDF expression in the cells along with the downregulation of Bax and 
activity of caspase-3 and 9 (Huang et al, 2014).
4.2.17 Trigonelline
Trigonelline (19) is a pyridine alkaloid obtained from fenugreek seed, coffee, gar￾den peas, etc. Trigonelline has a neuroprotective effect against ischemia induced by 
MCAO in rats. It has shown a reduction in the elevated nitrite and MDA levels reliev￾ing oxidative stress. It inhibited reduced GSH-mediated myeloperoxidase expres￾sion in the cortex of the brain (Pravalika et al, 2019). In the 6-OHDA-induced PD 
model, trigonelline prevented neuronal death and apoptosis in substantia nigra pars 
compacta and restored MDA level (Mirzaie et al, 2016). In the chronic d-galactose 
model, trigonelline displayed a marked reduction in advanced glycation end product 
(AGEs) levels and oxidative stress along with a significant reduction in AChE levels 
leading to neuroprotection (Chowdhury et al, 2018). In OGD/R-induced hippocam￾pal neurons, trigonelline treatment suppressed caspase-3 activity and bax expression 
along with the induction of bcl-2 expression. It induced PI3K/Akt signalling leading 
to neuroprotection in hippocampal neuronal injury (Qiu et al, 2020). Trigonelline 
also reversed the LPS-induced behavioural and memory deficits and restored lev￾els of anti-oxidant enzymes and AChE in the hippocampus and cortex. The levels The Neuroprotective Effect of Alkaloids and Synthetic Derivatives 67
of TNF-α and IL-6 were alleviated along with the upregulation of BDNF, indicat￾ing the promising neuroprotective property (Chowdhury et al, 2018). Similar results 
were found in another study where trigonelline ameliorated LPS-induced hippocam￾pal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and reduced expression of NF-κβ, toll￾like receptor 4 (TLR4), and TNF-α (Khalili et al, 2018). Trigonelline was also found 
to be effective against diabetic neuropathy with the restoration of the impaired motor 
and sensory nerve conduction and downregulation of glucagon-like peptide 1 protein 
and phosphorylated p38 MAPK protein in plasma and sciatic nerve, respectively 
(Zhou and Zhou, 2012). In Aβ1–40-induced toxicity in rats, trigonelline has shown 
improved mitochondrial membrane potential and lowered hippocampal MDA, pro￾tein carbonyl and LDH levels. It also significantly ameliorated hippocampal levels 
of TNF-α, IL-6, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100b and Cox2 (Fahanik￾Babaei et al, 2019).
4.2.18 Vincamine
Vincamine (20) is an indole-containing monoterpenoid alkaloid present in Vinca 
minor. Vincamine has displayed neuroprotection against Aβ25–35 induced toxicity 
and reduced apoptosis in PC12 cells. It activates PI3K/Akt pathway and upregu￾lates SOD (Han et al, 2017). In another study, vincamine resulted in 50% clear￾ance of brain iron content, reducing oxidative stress (Fayed, 2010). Vindeburnol, 
a vincamine derivative, reduced the astrocyte activation and demyelination in the 
cerebellum of C57BL/6 mice treated immunised with myelin oligodendrocyte gly￾coprotein (MOG35-55). Locus coeruleus also appeared to have lower astrocyte acti￾vation along with attenuated tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuronal hypertrophy 
(Polak et al, 2012).
The neuroprotective mode of action of other alkaloids is presented in Table 4.2.
4.3 SYNTHETIC AND SEMI-SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVES 
OF NEUROPROTECTIVE ALKALOIDS
The synthetic and semi-synthetic derivatives of alkaloids along with the neuropro￾tective mechanism, are presented in Table 4.3.
4.4 FUTURE PROSPECTS
Alkaloids are indeed an interesting class of plant secondary metabolites synthesised 
from amino acids with a wide spectrum of medicinal properties. Being widely dis￾tributed in the plant kingdom, they are well used in traditional medicine in the form 
of extracts. The advancement in modern technology has been helpful in the isolation 
of these alkaloids in their pure form. The alkaloids have shown various CNS activi￾ties with neuroprotection as one of the crucial properties. Neurodegeneration is an 
unavoidable phenomenon related to ageing, which involves dysfunctional cellular 
machinery leading the cell death. The plausible cause would be membrane damage, 
DNA damage, dysfunctional mitochondria and hampered cellular pathways such as 
axonal transport and protein degradation machinery. Neuroprotection is important 68 NeuroPhytomedicine TABLE 4.2 Alkaloids along with Their Neuroprotective Mechanism.

for the prolonged survival of neuronal cells, especially in the case of neurodegenera￾tive diseases. Alkaloids displayed neuroprotection through various routes and mech￾anisms, viz. minimising DNA and cellular damage by neutralising ROS, preventing 
the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, activating anti-apoptotic pathways and 
decreasing the expression of inflammatory markers. The bioavailability and BBB 
permeability of the alkaloids are still a major concern. The semi-synthetic and syn￾thetic derivatives with suitable physicochemical properties for bioavailability could 
be a plausible avenue for the development of new lead molecules. However, there 
is still a need for the development of such derivatives, with a few available to date.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Neuropsychiatric disorders are highly prevalent and significantly have increased 
the global disease burden. They are cumulatively complex diseases with a poorly 
described mechanism, and research into them is progressing slowly. Approximately 
970.1 million individuals worldwide suffer from mental problems, a number that 
has significantly increased since the global pandemic in 2020. Stress, major depres￾sive disorder (MDD), anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), 
insomnia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are some of the most common 
neuropsychiatric disorders (Figure 5.1). Drawing a distinction between “disorder” 
and “normality” of a person’s wellness is a crucial part of classifying and identifying 
mental diseases (Sotille et al, 2022). Recently phytomedicines have gained immense 
demand as a prophylactic as well as therapeutic use for numerous neuropsychiatric 
disorders. Herbs are becoming more and more popular all over the world due to their 
effectiveness in treating sickness due to their multitarget mechanisms and the draw￾backs of pharmaceutical treatments in terms of side effects and expense. Current 
chapter will discuss the various phytoconstituents studied clinically and preclini￾cally for neuropsychiatric disorders and emphasis is also given to understand their 
mechanism of actions.
5.2 PHYTOCONSTITUENTS FOR STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS
Stress is a divisive condition caused by stressors, putting at risk the homeostasis nec￾essary for survival and well-being. The stress system is a complex array of molecu￾lar, cellular and neuroendocrine components. According to physiological theory, the 
sympathetic-adrenomedullary axis (SAM axis) and adrenergic system are imme￾diately activated in the body’s response to stress, followed by the hypothalamus￾pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), which are the main players in stress (Figure 5.2).

It affects the cognitive, reward and fear systems in the brain, and centrally it pro￾duces structural and functional alterations that result in neuropsychiatric diseases 
such as anxiety, depression and sleeplessness (Musazzi et al, 2018; Patriquin and 
Mathew, 2017; Yang et al, 2015). The cytokine pathway, the neurotransmitter path￾way (dopamine, serotonin) and the neuroendocrine pathway (cortisol) are the three 
primary mechanisms implicated in stress. The body releases arginine, vasopressin, 
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides, 
neuropeptide Y, activating locus coeruleus (LC) and autonomic norepinephrine cen￾tres in the brainstem known as allostasis for survival and adaptation to the changing 
internal and external environment. The thyroid hormone axis, growth, reproduc￾tive, gastrointestinal, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and immunologic systems are all 
affected at the periphery. Many neuropathological and emotional disorders, includ￾ing depression, SZ, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment, may 
be caused by long-term chronic stress. By enhancing sleep, food and exercise, as 
well as integrating meditation and some herbs into our food, medicine or diet can 
reduce stress.
The families of plants, Solanaceae, Araliaceae, Lamiaceae, Crassulaceae, 
Asteraceae and Scrophulariaceae are the most frequently utilised as anti-stress 
remedies around the world. The most popular herbs for stress management include 
Withania somnifera (WS), Rosmarinus officinalis, Panax ginseng, Rhodiola 
rosea L., Matricaria recutita L., Bacopa monnieri, Convolvulus pluricaulis, 
Eleutherococcus senticosus, Schisandra chinensis and Centella asiatica L. WS,

also known as ashwagandha, reduces stress symptoms primarily via modulating 
the HPA axis, SAM axis, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and serotoner￾gic pathways, as well as other stress-related pathways. The active phytochemical, 
withaferin-A, withanolide acts mainly through the suppression of cortisol and cor￾ticosterone which get elevated during stress-induced HPA axis dysregulation. A 
recent clinical trial involving 60 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 75 with 
below 20 value on the perceived stress scale (PSS) was studied for adaptogenic and 
anxiolytic effects of ashwagandha root extract (Salve et al, 2019). PSS is a 14-item 
instrument to measure stress. For eight weeks, they received either ashwagandha 
FIGURE 5.2 Diagrammatic representation of stress pathway, representing HPA axis dys￾regulation. Stress activates a complex network of major endocrine hormones known as the 
HPA axis. Hypothalamus secretes CRH into the bloodstream and increases the activity of 
the sympathetic nervous system, signalling the pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic 
hormone. ACTH released into the bloodstream travels down to the adrenal cortex, resulting 
in adrenal glands to secrete glucocorticoids like cortisol. Cortisol has receptors in almost all 
cell types and helps our body cope with the immediate stress by negative feedback mecha￾nism that impact back on the function of the hypothalamus and pituitary. In case of extreme 
persistent stress, it overloads the HPA axis and it continues to release hormones on acceler￾ated basis leading to desensitisation and stop recognising signals to stop producing corti￾sol. It results in non-functioning of negative feedback loop leading to various metabolical, 
neuropsychological and inflammatory disorders. Introduction of herbal phytoconstituents 
results in blockage of stress response by modulation of the HPA axis through corticotrophin￾releasing hormone and cortisol. Abbreviations: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,

oxygen species (ROS).86 NeuroPhytomedicine
extract 125 mg, ashwagandha extract 300 mg or identical placebo twice daily for 
eight weeks as a capsule. A significant improvement in the PSS scale was observed 
in 58 volunteers (who completed the trial) with a marked drop in blood cortisol lev￾els as well as improved sleep pattern. Another clinical study focused on treating an 
obese adult population with 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract (>5% withanolides) 
twice a day for 10 weeks. This has led to decreased levels of cortisol in the blood, 
body weight and basic metabolic index, as well as decreased body fat. A preclinical 
study in rats showed decreased corticosterone levels in the hippocampus in the stress 
model (Baitharu et al, 2013). The other mechanism by which WS alleviates stress 
is by immune stimulation and anti-inflammatory effects. This leads to an increase 
in the number of peripheral T cells (CD3, CD4 and CD8 populations), interleukin-2 
(IL-2), interferon gamma (INF-γ) and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 
which are downregulated in stress. Preclinical studies using WS extracts and with￾anolides-rich extracts (2.7%) on stress induced in rats by cold restraint stress and 
forced swimming-induced stress, showed antistress activity with increased white 
blood cell counts, neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils (Anju, 2011; Puri and 
Purohit, 2016). Panax ginseng, another antistress plant of the family Araliaceae, 
contains active phytoconstituents that reduce stress including ginsenoside Rb1 and 
Rg3. Stress results in decreased brain brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) lev￾els altering heat shock protein – 70 in the hippocampus. BDNF is synthesised in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and plays its functions by binding on the tropomyosin recep￾tor kinase B receptor further activating the signal transduction cascade to promote 
neuroplasticity, neuronal survival and differentiation (Lee and Kim, 2010).
Clinical study of Korean red ginseng (KRG) in two high-stress occupations, that 
is, nurses and firefighters aged 20–60 years were included in the study (Baek et al, 
2019). The stress levels of these volunteers and cognition were assessed using the 
Beck Depression Inventory and the Stress Response Inventory. Chronic stress in 
volunteers had raised levels of cortisol and catecholamine, adrenaline and reduced 
triglycerides. Treatment with KRG for 2 g/day of KRG (LAX-101) or placebo for 
6 weeks showed reduced levels of cortisol and epinephrine and normalised triglycer￾ides. This is assumed to be the possible mechanism for central nervous system (CNS) 
stabilisation. Further, KRG was found to contain Rb1, 6.44 mg/g; Rb2, 2.25 mg/g; 
Rc, 2.68 mg/g; Rd, 0.50 mg/g; Re, 2.08 mg/g; Rf, 0.89 mg/g; Rg1, 3.21 mg/g; Rg2, 
0.29 mg/g; Rg3, 0.18 mg/g. Treatment with Rb1 also increases the levels of ther￾mal shock protein 70 and BDNF that have neuroprotective and anti-stress properties 
(Kim et al, 2013). A pre-clinical study consisting of total ginseng panax saponins 
(TSPG) was studied on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced stress in 
rats. They were treated with TSPG (50 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day) during the entire 
modelling period. TSPG was found to improve depressive behaviour and to exhibit 
neuroprotection. TSPG inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as P38 and 
Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein phosphorylation in the hippocampus, indicat￾ing significant antidepressant and antistress activity. Camellia sinensis L. commonly 
called green tea from the Theaceae family. The active phytoconstituent, L-theanine 
is thenon-proteinogenic amino acid, passes freely through the blood-brain barrier, 
acts by reduction of presynaptic glutamate release, increased inhibitory neurotrans￾mitter GABA, and enhanced glycine and dopamine release (Kakuda et al, 2008; Molecular Mechanism of Action of Phytoconstituents 87
Shen et al, 2019; Yamada et al, 2007). Clinical study on fifth-year college students 
(n = 20) of the school of pharmaceutical sciences, practising outside the university 
at the hospital or a drug store, for 11 weeks, where they were administered theanine 
(200 mg, twice a day, after breakfast and lunch). These were assessed for anxiety 
using a state anxiety inventory test. At the end of the study, treatment with théanine 
supplementation was found to be beneficial in suppressing psychosocial stress. It was 
assumed that theanine improved the HPA axis (Unno et al, 2013).
5.3 PHYTOCONSTITUENTS USED FOR ANXIETY
People who experience anxiety have difficulty with their sleep habits, their ability to 
focus and their ability to interact with others. Anxiety disorders like panic disorder 
are characterised by recurrent, unprovoked panic attacks that leave sufferers feeling 
extremely anxious, approaching doom, dizzy and short of breath (Markowitz et al, 
1989). Agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia and phobias 
of animals, heights, elevators, blood or injections are examples of other anxiety dis￾orders (Ballenger, 2007; Craske et al, 1989; Magee et al, 1996; Schweizer, 1995). Due 
to the varied character of anxiety disorders, concomitant conditions including stress, 
diabetes, depression or hereditary factors could contribute to their aetiology (Amray 
et al, 2019). Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), GABA, noradrenaline (NE), 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), CRH, neuropeptide-Y and cholecystokinin 
(CCK), main excitatory amino acid, glutamate, N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA), 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionate (AMPA) and kainic acid are 
a few neurotransmitters involved in the development of anxiety. Serotonergic dys￾function leads to an aberrant 5-HT release and/or reuptake regulation or abnormal 
5-HT signal response. A key stress-response mechanism that causes anxiety is the 
LC noradrenergic system that releases epinephrine during stress and works in tan￾dem with the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system. CRF neurons are found in 
the paraventricular nucleus, where they mediate the HPA axis’s activity in response 
to stress, which raises plasma cortisol levels and increases CRF. The serotonergic 
and noradrenergic systems are interconnected and together play a prime role in the 
regulation of mood and anxiety (Bremner et al, 2010). The inhibitory neurotrans￾mitter, GABA influences the level of dopamine, 5-HT and NMDA. Thus, NMDA 
antagonists and non-NMDA type receptors can reduce excitatory glutamate recep￾tor activity and possess anxiolytic effects (LeDoux, 1994)). Alternately, increasing 
GABA neurotransmission can reduce the output of the excitatory system. Thus, for 
effective control of the behavioural and physiological responses related to anxiety, 
a balance between NE, 5-HT, glutamate receptor-mediated excitement and GABA 
receptor-mediated inhibition should exist. Selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) 
and 5-HT-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the first-line treatments for anxiety.
An alarming amount of people are becoming overly dependent on synthetic phar￾maceuticals to treat or relieve anxiety disorders, yet there are still many people who 
prefer herbal remedies. Important phytochemicals acting on the CNS are being iden￾tified, including saponins, alkaloids, polyphenols, triterpenes, essential oils, fatty 
acids and flavonoids. The phytoconstituents from families of herbs – Solanaceae, 
Piperaceae, Hypericaceae, Plantaginaceae, Passifloraceae, Araliaceae, Lamiaceae, 88 NeuroPhytomedicine
Caprifoliaceae, Turneraceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Lamiaceae, Asteraceae and Apiaceae 
are commonly used as anti-anxiety remedies. According to the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) and the National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA), 
Withania somnifera L., Piper methysticum, Hypericum perforatum L., Bacopa 
monnieri L., Passiflora incarnata L. and Panax ginseng are safe herbal remedies. 
Ocimum sanctum L. also known as Tulsi contains eugenol (70%) as a major constitu￾ent. Clinical study carried out in patients suffering from generalised anxiety disorder 
were selected and given the ethanolic extract of Ocimum sanctum L. supplement 
(500 mg capsule, twice daily) for 60 days. On completion of the study, reduced stress, 
attenuated anxiety and negated depression attributing to the regulation of hypo￾thalamohypophyseal-adrenocortical axis were noted (Bhattacharyya et al, 2008). 
OciBest, an extract of Ocimum sanctum L, having ociglycoside-I (hydroxychavicol 
glucoside/4-allyl-1-O-β-D-glucopyronosyl-2-hydroxybenzene; >0.1%w/w), rosma￾rinic acid (>0.2%w/w) and triterpene acids (>2.5%w/w) was tested in 158 patients 
in a randomised, double-blind trial which exhibited antistress effects (Saxena et al, 
2012). Eugenol treatment in rats exposed to restrain for 4 hours attenuated ulcer 
index and reduced cortisol without affecting NE and amelioration of HPA axis 
(Garabadu et al, 2011). The most commonly active phytoconstituents present in 
Melissa officinalis L. (Lamiaceae) also known as lemon herb are rosmarinic acid, 
ursolic acid and oleanolic acid is native to Europe and Asia and is responsible for its 
antianxiety effect. Clinical investigation in patients with anxiety and sleep disorder, 
supplemented with dried powder of aerial part of Melissa officinalis L. (3 g) for 
56 days showed improvement in anxiety score (Haybar et al, 2018). The author sug￾gested its antianxiety effects attributed to its serotonergic activity, reduced cortisol 
level and its  GABA transaminase inhibitory effect. The preclinical study in rats 
has proven that Melissa officinalis L. act by inhibiting GABA transaminase and 
shows promising anxiolytic effect (Bathala et al, 2012). Hypericum perforatum L. 
(Saint John’s Wort (SJW)) containing active phytoconstituents hypericin and hyper￾forin is majorly used in anxiety disorder. Hypericin inhibits monoamine oxidase-A 
(MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) enzymes and regulates dopamine 
levels. Hyperforin elevates the extracellular levels of 5-HT, dopamine, NE, GABA 
and L-glutamate. Passiflora incarnata L. (Passion flower) contain active phytocon￾stituents such as orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, isovitexin and chrysin shows antianxi￾ety effect by its action on benzodiazepine and GABA receptors (Table 5.1).
5.4 PHYTOCONSTITUENTS USED FOR DEPRESSION
Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by anxiety, aggression, 
dementia and emotional imbalance. According to the World Health Organization, 
depression is considered the most prevalent among all neuropsychiatric disorders. 
Worldwide 322 million people are suffering from depression (Vasha et al, 2023). 
Lack of diagnosis makes depression a more severe form, resulting in loneliness 
and suicidal tendencies. Various studies have reported complications and comor￾bidities associated with depression such as cardiovascular changes, constipation, 
colitis, erectile dysfunctions and thyroid problems. In severe cases, it may lead to 
MDD, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes. Various synthetic drugs such as tricyclic Molecular Mechanism of Action of Phytoconstituents 89

antidepressants, SSRI, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and newer drugs like brex￾anolone and esketamine which are quick-acting have become the choice for therapy. 
However, they are associated with many side effects such as cardiovascular disorder 
and suicidal ideations. Other complications include constipation and urine reten￾tion, causing discomfort to the patients and decreased responsiveness to the therapy 
(Aswar et al, 2017; Ghoneim and O’Hara, 2016).
Various in vitro and in vivo studies were reported for the antidepressant use of 
plant extracts such as Boophone disticha L., Leonotis leonurus L. and Mentha lon￾gifolia L., Bacopa monieri L., Dittrichia viscosa L. (Alkahtani et al, 2022; Arrieta￾Báez et al, 2022; Badaoui et al, 2022; Murlanova et al, 2022). The researchers have 
studied several phytoconstituents in context with their molecular mechanism with 
the aid of animal behaviour, computational molecular docking, molecular dynamics, 
enzymatic studies, network pharmacology, patch clamp technique, electrophysiol￾ogy and radioligand binding assays, some of them are discussed below.
5.4.1 Monoamine Oxidase A Inhibitors (MAOI-A)
Monoamine oxidase is widely distributed in the periphery as well as the CNS and 
is involved in the metabolism of various monoamines. It is present in two isoforms, 
namely MAO-A and MAO-B. 5-HT, norepinephrine and dopamine have specific 
selectivity with MAO-A, which is the key enzyme for their metabolism (Myburg 
et al, 2022). Numerous preclinical and clinical studies suggested increased expres￾sions of MAO in chronic stress-induced rats and depressed patients (Domschke et al, 
2008; Stefanovic et al, 2016). It was found that under the stress conditions activa￾tion of kruppel-like factor 11 upregulates the MAO-A activity, which further rapidly 
breaks down the monoamines such as 5-HT and dopamine resulting in MDD (Harris 
et al, 2015). A number of phytoconstituents have been evaluated and reported as 
MAO-A inhibitors which attenuate depression-like behaviour in rats. Plants like 
SJW, with active constituent hypericin which is an MAO-A inhibitor, have been 
used from ancient times to treat MDD (Assadi et al, 2011; Suzuki et al, 1984). Many 
polyherbal formulations contain phytoconstituents such as harmine (Peganum har￾mala L.), punarnavine (Boerhaavia diffusa L.) (Dhingra and Valecha, 2014) hyper￾forin and adhyforin (Hypericum perforatum L.) act via modulation of MAO activity 
(Jensen et al, 2001). Curcuma longa L. contain active phytoconstituents curcumin 
A and curcumin B. In vitro study of the MAO-A activity showed that curcumin A 
possess inhibitory effect on it with a docking score of −9.78 kcal/mol by in silico
molecular simulation method (Aswar et al, 2020; Nazemi et al, 2019). Further in 
silico and in vivo evaluation by isolation of ethanolic extract of Piper longum L. a 
piperine alkaloid and its derivative antiepilepsirine showed antidepressant effect. 
Piperine competitively inhibits MAO-A with Ki 19.0 ± 0.9 μM. The antidepressant 
activity was further confirmed by reduced immobility in tail suspension and force 
swim tests (Li et al, 2007). Another preclinical study in CUMS model in mice where 
administration of water extract of Gastrodia elata Blume (0.5 mg/kg) and palmatine 
(0.5 mg/kg) has shown to reduce the MAO-A and increased 5-HT in the hippocam￾pus. It was supported by behavioural study, sucrose preference test and open field test 
(Dhingra and Bhankher, 2014).Molecular Mechanism of Action of Phytoconstituents 97
5.4.2 HPA Axis and Anti-Neuroinflammatory Phytoconstituents
The activation of inflammatory cascade induces overexpression of CRH and elevates 
cortisol levels in hypothalamus altering the behavioural function such as mood, cog￾nition and locomotor activity resulting in neuroinflammation and associated depres￾sion (Baune, 2017; Yang et al, 2014). In addition, the glucocorticoid receptors (GCs) 
present in the hippocampus play a major role in cognition, mood and emotion. In 
a preclinical study on zebrafish, a reserpine-induced stress model was used where 
ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica L. ameliorated depression-like behaviour. 
Active constituents, asiatic acid and madecassic acid modulated HPA axis activity 
leading to reduced cortisol release thereby restoring the monoamines in zebrafish 
brains (Zakaria et al, 2023). Resveratrol shows myriad of beneficial effects such as 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and HPA axis modulation and has been extensively 
studied for its antidepressant effect. In vivo study conducted by Ge et al (2013) in 
CUMS induced depression in rats, when administered with 15 mg/kg resveratrol 
elucidated antidepressant activity. The mRNA expression of corticotropin-releasing 
hormone (CRH) in the hippocampus remained unaltered, but peripheral regula￾tion of HPA axis caused reduced serum cortisol levels. Improvement in behavioural 
models such as increased sucrose preference, reduced immobility in Forced Swim 
Test and reduction of lipid peroxidation supports its antidepressant effect (Ge et al, 
2013). Another phytoconstituent salidroside present in Rhodiola rosea was studied 
in olfactory bulbectomy-induced rats. Administration of salidroside (20, 40 mg/kg 
p.o) for 2 weeks remarkably reduced the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 
and IL-1 beta (IL-1β) levels and markedly increased the GC expression in the hip￾pocampus. Salidroside showed its antidepressant effect by reduction of CRH in 
the hypothalamus and serum cortisol levels (Yang et al, 2014). Phytoconstituents are 
multifunctional in nature which not only target a single disease but also attenuate 
the comorbidities associated with it. Depression associated with diabetes worsens 
the diabetic symptoms and blood glucose. The activation of inflammatory mediators 
leads to HPA axis activation and oxidative stress, thus making diabetes depression a 
vicious cycle (Patil and Aswar, 2021). A potent flavonoid quercetin is richly present 
in apples, broccoli and ginkgo biloba. In a preclinical study on diabetic depressed 
rats when administered (100 mg/kg i.p.), balanced the HPA axis and reduced blood 
glucose levels (Demir et al, 2016). The important and key regulator for neuroin￾flammation associated with depression is nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer 
of activated B cells (NF-κB) which regulates TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1 and IL-10 levels. 
Due to its direct correlation with depression, various polyphenols were studied 
for its inhibitory activity. The polyphenols are ferulic acid, chrysin and hesperi￾din (Borges Filho et al, 2016; Zheng et al, 2019). It was found that stress activates 
the glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) which further stimulates inflamma￾tory cascade by increasing NF-κB activity leading to the activation of nucleotide￾binding domain, leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 
inflammasome (NLRP-3). They also stimulate caspase 1 activity which helps in 
the formation of immature to mature form of IL-1β in the hippocampus. Baicalin 
a polyphenol obtained from the Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, phosphorylate the 
GSK3β and further activate NF-κB. Baicalin attenuates depressive symptoms by 98 NeuroPhytomedicine
inhibition of GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway which makes baicalin as a strong 
anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective phytoconstituent (Zeng et al, 2018).
5.4.3 Inhibition of Kynurenine Pathway
Pathogenesis of depression and MDD mainly involves tryptophan metabolism and kyn￾urenine pathway (indole 2,3 amine dioxygenase (IDO)/tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase 
(TDO)). Tryptophan is a precursor protein for the 5-HT synthesis, and under normal 
physiological conditions, the tryptophan hydroxylase converts the tryptophan into 
5-HT. TDO and IDO are the enzymes involved in the metabolism of tryptophan in 
the kynurenine pathway. Due to stress, the immune activation stimulates the IDO and 
TDO activity which further rapidly converts tryptophan into kynurenine resulting 
in the formation of the neurotoxin called quinolinic acid. Such events alter the 5-HT 
synthesis and induce its deficiency in the brain leading to mood alteration and depres￾sive symptoms (Qin et al, 2018). Glycyrrhizic acid (Glycyrrhiza glabra) inhibits high￾mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) danger-associated protein-mediated quinolinic acid 
formation and reduces kynurenine formation and improves the 5-HT balance in the 
rat hippocampus (Wang et al, 2018). Another active phytoconstituent cajaninstilbene 
acid is isolated from pigeon pea leaves. Cajaninstilbene acid when administered to 
mice at doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg showed antidepressant effect in mice via trypto￾phan metabolism attributed to its action by mTOR. It regulates 5-HT formation and 
has been proved to play an important role in cognition, synaptic plasticity and neural 
protein synthesis (Zhang et al, 2020).
A number of hypotheses have been developed and explored on target-oriented 
therapy for depression but very few succeeded in proper management of major 
depressive episodes. The neurotrophic hypothesis proposes the involvement of 
BDNF in depression. Zhaoxiang Ren performed a study to determine the action of 
dihydromyricetin (Ampelopsis grossedentata) lipopolysaccharide-induced MDD. 
As results suggested that the dihydromyricetin acts via GSK3B which further phos￾phorylates and improves the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activ￾ity to regulate the transcription of BDNF in hippocampal tissue and cultured cells of 
the hippocampus (Ren et al, 2018). Crocus sativus L. commonly known as saffron 
also regulates the expression of BDNF when administered for 21 days at a dose of 
160 mg/kg i.p (Ghasemi et al, 2015). The phytoconstituents such as piperine, tetran￾drine, eugenol, baicalin, chrysin, naringenin, curcumin, oleanolic acid, ginsenoside 
Rg1 and genipin were found to increase the expression of BDNF (Bahramsoltani 
et al, 2015).
5.5 PHYTOCONSTITUENTS USED FOR PSYCHOSIS
The clinically evident characteristics of the major five domains, such as delusions, 
hallucinations, disorganised speech, abnormal catatonic behaviour and decreased 
emotional expressiveness, make up psychosis (Reus et al, 2016). Other symptoms 
include a lack of comprehension and poor social skills (Turner et al, 2018). It is 
divided into dementia praecox and manic depression (BD and SZ). Trauma, sensory 
and sleep deprivation, drugs including cannabis, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), Molecular Mechanism of Action of Phytoconstituents 99
amphetamines and very occasionally MDD are other factors that might cause psy￾chosis (Griswold et al, 2021; Turner et al, 2018). Rapid sedation, antipsychotic medi￾cines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can all be used to treat psychosis. A 
severe mental illness called SZ is linked to abnormal neural circuitry. It contributes 
to the global prevalence of 26 million populations (Koyanagi et al, 2022). According 
to researchers, the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of SZ is primarily due to 
multiple origins connected to metabolic, genetic and environmental factors, as well 
as auto-immune and abnormalities in neurotransmission in the brain (Dhindsa and 
Goldstein, 2016; Rodrigues-Amorim et al, 2018). Additionally, SZ is linked to a vari￾ety of brain disorders that cause an excess of presynaptic dopamine (DA) production 
in the striatum (Grace and Gomes, 2019; McCutcheon et al, 2019). The pathophysi￾ology of SZ is significantly influenced by neurotrophins, including BDNF, nerve 
growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) (Shoval 
and Weizman, 2005). Around 1%–3% of people have BD, formerly known as manic￾depressive psychosis. It is a recurring, severe and life-threatening mental illness 
(Belmaker, 2004). It is the primary cause of disability, cognitive impairment and 
functional impairment, along with rising suicide rates. Unbalance in monoaminergic 
neurotransmitter systems, such as the serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic, 
is a hallmark of BD, a heritable psychiatric illness. Neurotrophic molecules BDNF, 
which are essential for brain plasticity and are evidently decreased in BD (Grande 
et al, 2010; Machado-Vieira et al, 2014). Antidepressant therapy, electroconvulsive 
therapy, lithium supplementation, psychosocial psychotherapy and CBT are used to 
manage BD.
Psychosis is a mental illness that has an impact on a patient’s overall well-being 
in terms of his thoughts, perception, cognition, emotion, etc. It is stigmatised or 
believed to be the result of God’s curse, witchcraft or taboo in various regions, 
such as South Africa and Asia. The disease involves a strong conviction that it can 
only be cured by conventional techniques, such as using local plants and follow￾ing antiquated rituals. The Leguminosae family, which also includes the Fabaceae, 
Apocynaceae, Liliaceae, Amaranthaceae, Rubiaceae and Lamiaceae, is home to 
the majority of the anti-psychotic herbs used around the world. The different active 
components from these plants, their reported scientific research in animal mod￾els and their mechanisms of action are all taken into consideration in this chapter. 
Additionally, an attempt will be made to examine their experience in clinical trials 
and their prospects.
Several plants, including Piper retrofractum, Thevetia peruviana L., Euphorbia 
neriifolia L., Vitex negundo, Cannabis sativa and Brassica juncea, have been linked 
to the treatment of psychotic episodes, according to a study conducted in Bangladesh. 
At the University of Cologne in Germany, 20 individuals with SZ received cannabidiol 
(CBD), a substance derived from the Cannabis sativa plant. It has been discovered 
that CBD lessens anxiety brought on by psychosis. The traditional Indian medical 
system, Ayurveda, is extensively utilised to treat psychosis since it is a powerful and 
efficient system of therapy. Acorus calamus, found in Brahmyadiyoga, is utilised as 
an anti-psychotic ayurvedic drug. Since ancient times, Chinese herbal medicine has 
been a cornerstone in the treatment of psychoses. Between 300 and 100 BC, “The 
Canon of Internal Medicine” was compiled. In the past, it has been discovered that 100 NeuroPhytomedicine
extracts from Datura metal, Parasiticus on Coriaria and its host Coriaria can stop 
psychotic episodes. A Japanese herbal medicine called Yokukansan (TJ-54) is well￾known for having ferulic acid, glycyrrhizin and Saikosaponin A-rich components. 
Using the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), clinical global impression scale￾severity (CGI-S) and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), the medica￾tion was examined clinically in an open-label trial. As a result of TJ-54’s ability to 
modify 5HT2A receptor activation as well as its anti-glutaminergic capability, the 
results demonstrated a considerable improvement with TJ-54 monotherapy (Miyaoka 
et al, 2013).
The catalepsy caused by haloperidol and the stereotypy caused by amphetamine 
can both be reduced by methanolic preparations of Vitex negundo L. roots. DA-induced 
contractions of the vas deferens can also be suppressed. Its anti-dopaminergic action 
was demonstrated by this research. The neuroprotective compounds found in Vitex 
negundo are called vitegnoside, negundoside, agunside, flavones, luteolin and cas￾ticin. However, further in-depth research is needed to determine the phytochemi￾cal that gives Vitex negundo its anti-psychotic properties. The dopamine theory of 
psychosis is currently out of date because recent research has shown that psychosis 
involves more than only the D2 receptor. Targets for innovative medication include 
the function of 5-HT (1 and 2A) receptors and glutamate receptors with D2 antago￾nism. Similarly, the plants/phytochemicals used by traditional healers are known 
to act with myriad effects on different receptors, neurotransmitters and channels as 
well. Cannabis sativa contains an alkaloid known as the cannabinoid. According to 
research, it is the first clinical experiment to examine potential antipsychotic effects 
of CBD. Nineteen patients received 800 mg of CBD as monotherapy for 4 weeks, 
and the impact on the PANSS and BPRS was examined. The effects of CBD were 
found to be equivalent to amisulpride, the standard treatment; moreover, CBD was 
devoid of any extrapyramidal side effects as observed with amisulpride. Many more 
clinical trials were conducted in later years and suggested the antipsychotic effect of 
CBD at a dose ranging from 800 to 1000 mg for 4 weeks. CBD is known to act via 
5HT1A receptor and GPR55 (novel cannabinoid receptor) activation. The GPR55 is 
present abundantly in CNS, its activation improves psychotic symptoms and cogni￾tive impairments, as well as neuroinflammation (Dyck et al, 2021). Caryophyllene, 
obtained from the same plant, is also demonstrated to prevent positive and negative 
symptoms in patients at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg by acting cannabinoid 
receptor type 2 receptors (Anavi-Goffer et al, 2016). Stephalidine (SPD) is another 
important constituent of Chinese herbal medicine Stephania intermedia. SPD is 
found to exhibit a D2 antagonism effect while having D1 agonistic activity. It stimu￾lated apomorphine (specific D1) induced rotations while inhibiting amphetamine 
(specific D2) induced rotations in the 6-OHDA model. Dual actions of (-)-stepholidine 
on dopamine receptor subtypes after substantia nigra lesion. Moreover, it inhibited 
prepulse inhibition and increased the hindlimb retraction time indicating its D2 
antagonistic effect thereby exhibiting an antipsychotic effect with low potency to 
induce EPS (Ellenbroek et al, 2006). Baicalin is a polyphenol present in plants such 
as Scutellaria baicalensis, found to alleviate the negative symptoms associated with 
SZ when given as an adjunct to olanzapine. The study was carried out on 45 patients, 
and the treatment was given for 24 weeks. The treatment attenuated PANSS scores Molecular Mechanism of Action of Phytoconstituents 101
and showed marked improvements in cognitive skills, including attention/vigilance 
(AV), working memory (WM) and brief visuospatial memory test (BVMT). Other 
phytoconstituents such as stigmasterol (a phytosterol), tutin (sesquiterpene), glycine, 
an amino acid and kavapyrone from kava are also found to be effective in the treat￾ment of psychoses. The detailed information of other phytoconstituents reported 
antipsychotic activity is presented in (Table 5.1).
5.6 PHYTOCONSTITUENTS USED FOR OCD
In neurology practice, OCD is a persistent and incapacitating mental illness. It is 
diagnosed almost as frequently as asthma and diabetes mellitus, making it the fourth 
most prevalent mental disorder. Despite the several pharmacological classes that are 
available for the treatment of OCD, achieving full remission is still difficult (Stein, 
2002). Over the past ten years, research on herbal medicines has increased. OCD is 
characterised by recurrent, ego-diatomic ritualistic thoughts (compulsions) coupled 
with presumably intentional acts (compulsions). It frequently co-occurs with sig￾nificant depression, and it is regarded as an anxiety condition that is resistant to 
benzodiazepines. It has a 1%–3% lifetime prevalence rate. The only medications 
that consistently work in treating OCD patients are strong SSRIs. Pharmacotherapy 
for OCD has been studied extensively, but research into efficient herbal remedies 
for OCD has only recently begun. Plants that are used to treat depression and anxi￾ety may be a potential therapeutic approach for OCD. Evidence suggests that the 
ayurvedic medicine of India known as shankhpushpi, which contains Bacopa monn￾ieri L. Cyanoglucoside from Colocasia esculenta and Convolvulus pluricaulis, may 
be effective in treating OCD. 5-HT is believed to play a part in controlling anxiety. 
It is suggested that OCD patients may have 5-HT receptors that are relatively under￾stimulated, and patients with OCD benefit from taking SSRI. It follows that an etha￾nolic extract of Bacopa monnieri may have a similar effect to an SSRI or some other 
facilitative impact on serotonergic neurotransmission (Ayati et al, 2020).
A number of therapeutic properties, including anxiolytic, neuroprotective, anti￾oxidant, analgesic, immunomodulatory, antibacterial, antidiabetic and cardioprotec￾tive effects, have been linked to this herb in ancient literature. Numerous bioactive 
phytoconstituents, including the alkaloid (convolamine), flavonoid (kaempferol) and 
phenolics (scopoletin, β-sitosterol and ceryl alcohol), have been linked to the neu￾roprotective capabilities of these herbs. The neuro-pharmacological profile such as 
neuroprotective, nootropic and neuro-modulatory effects of Convolulus prostratus
has been highlighted by numerous research teams. The literature shows mainly 
extracts used for the treatment of OCD in pre-clinical as well as clinical setup. The 
various extracts reported are methanolic extract of Benincasa hispida (doses: 200, 
400, 600 mg/kg) tested on male Swiss albino mice which have influence on 5-HT 
reuptake and also shows the presence of tryptophan in the extract which is an impor￾tant precursor of 5-HT in the serotonergic neurons and may be enhancing the bio￾synthesis of 5-HT to facilitate the anti-compulsive effect (Girdhar et al, 2010), CBD 
(15, 30, 60 mg/kg; tested on male mice) shows facilitation of CB1 receptor-mediated 
neurotransmission, suggesting the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the 
pathophysiology of OCD (Casarotto et al, 2010). Curcumin demonstrated increased 102 NeuroPhytomedicine
5-HT levels and decreased dopamine in treated rats. Quinpirole-induced OCD was 
tested using an open field consisting of four objects of different shape and colour. 
The vehicle-treated rat demonstrated obsession towards two objects, the effects of 
curcumin (10 mg/kg) were comparable to that of paroxetineperoxatine (block the 
5-HT reuptake transporter; SERT) and thus increase the concentration of (synap￾tic 5-HT). Curcumin also reduced the level of dopamine in quinpirole-treated rats. 
The study demonstrated anti-OCD effect of curcumin due to increased 5-HT, 5-HT1 
receptors and reduction of dopamine (Chimakurthy and Murthy, 2010). The plant 
Crocus sativus L. (saffron) is grown in several nations, including Iran, India, Italy, 
Spain and Greece. The well-known spice saffron is obtained from the red stigmas 
of the flowers. Crocins, picrocrocin and safranal are the major components of saf￾fron. The peculiar water-soluble carotenoids are called as crocins, which are gluco￾syl esters of crocetin. In folk medicine, the stigmas of Crocus sativus L. are used 
as an anticatarrhal, eupeptic, expectorant and emmenagogue, among other things 
(Girdhar et al, 2010). Crocin is tested in OCD at dose of 30 and 50 mg/kg, i.p., which 
were administered to rats followed by treatment with 1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine 
hydrochloride (mCPP). 1,3-Chlorophenyl pyprizine hydrochloride induced excessive 
cell grooming is a model of OCD; it is a non-selective 5-HT receptor agonist with 
more affinity towards 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 2B receptor that results in excessive cell 
grooming. Crocin significantly reduced the duration of grooming, no. of groom￾ing, indicating anti-OCD effect due to its effect on the 5-HT2 receptor (Georgiadou 
et al, 2012). Further, crocin was studied in clinical trials on 50 patients with OCD 
aged 18–60 years who received crocin (15 mg) and were evaluated using the Yale￾Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS). The efficacy of saffron and its active 
constituents on different mental disorders might be due to its effect on monoamine 
neurotransporters, including 5-HT, dopamine and norepinephrine as well as 5-HT 
receptors (Shafiee et al, 2018).
Bottle gourd is the popular name for Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standley (LS), 
also known as Lagenaria leucantha Rusby belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. 
LS fruits have been utilised for centuries for their cardioprotective, cardiotonic, 
general tonic, aphrodisiac and diuretic qualities. It is also used to treat pectoral 
cough, asthma and other bronchial problems, as well as discomfort, ulcers and fever. 
Modern phytochemical screening techniques have revealed the presence of flavone 
C-glycosides, fucosterol, campesterol and triterpenoid cucurbitacins B, D, G and 
H in it. The methanolic crude extract of LS (25 and 50 mg/kg i.p.) demonstrated 
reduced marble burring behaviours indicating anti-OCD effects. OCD is frequently 
characterised by compulsive behaviour. LS may decrease serotonergic neurotrans￾mission similarly to an SSRI or in some other way, making more 5-HT readily avail￾able to other nerve cells (Prajapati et al, 2011). Originally from Europe, North Africa 
and Asia, St. John’s wort is a flowering plant in the Hypericaceae family. Chemically, 
hypericum extracts contain a variety of biologically active and complex substances, 
such as naphthodianthrones (rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercitrin and pseu￾dorutin), phloroglucinol derivatives (hyperforin, adhyperforin), flavonoids (rutin, 
hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercitrin and quercetin). Hyperforin (3%) and hypericin 
(0.3%–0.5%) concentrations are typically used to standardise it. Twelve individu￾als with OCD were treated for at least a year in an open-label trial by Taylor and Molecular Mechanism of Action of Phytoconstituents 103
Kobak, with a fixed dose of 450 mg of 0.3% hypericin twice daily (extended-release 
formulation) for a period of 12 weeks. The Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale 
(YBOCS) score was found to decrease, indicating a considerable improvement in 
OCD (Taylor and Kobak, 2000).
5.7 PHYTOCONSTITUENTS FOR INSOMNIA
The common sleep problem known as insomnia is characterised by issues with fall￾ing asleep, remaining asleep and waking up early in the morning. It is among the 
most widespread sleep disorders in the world and significantly lowers one’s qual￾ity of life. One of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders, it is estimated that 
10%–15% of the general population and 30%–60% of the elderly are affected by 
it. A number of major health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
obesity, mental disorders and cognitive dysfunction are all made more likely by per￾sistent insomnia. The physiology of sleep involves neurotransmitters such as orexins 
A and B, adenosine, glycine, ACh, 5-HT and melatonin. NA, histamine, DA, glu￾tamate and GABA are among those that have a substantial impact on the process. 
Both pharmaceutical and natural approaches can be used to treat insomnia. Because 
of the possibility for tolerance and dependence toward conventional drugs as well 
as their numerous side effects, the surveys favour complementary and alternative 
treatment (Siegel, 2004). There have been investigations on 16 medicinal plants 
used as a single herb and 13 polyherbal blends. The herbs Valeriana officinalis L., 
Matricaria chamomilla L., Viola odorata L. and Passiflora incarnata L. are the 
most popular and effective for treating insomnia. The active phytoconstituents for 
treatment of insomnia are valeneomerins A-D, mauritine-A, mucronine-D, nummu￾larine-D, sativanine-A and sativanine-B, frangulanine, nummularine-B mucronine, 
apigenin, luteolin, rutin, herniarin, umbelliferone, trans-caffeic, protocatechuic, 
gentisic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, trans- and cis-coumaric acids 
quercetin, kaempferol, vitexin, iso-vitexin. They act mainly through modulation of 
the GABAergic system (Sarris et al, 2019).
5.8 CONCLUSION
Based on the literature, herbs are regularly consumed worldwide for various neu￾ropsychiatric disorders. These herbs majorly belong to the family Solanaceae, 
Linaceace, Plantaginaceae, Epipacea, Convolvuaceae, Ariariliacae, Hyperiaceae, 
Passifloracea, Pipreciacae and Zingiberacae. The phytoconstituents present in herbs 
act through diverse mechanisms such as some act by increasing neurotransmitters, 
for example, theanine, curcumin, resveratrol, ursolic acid, etc. While others act on 
receptors such as cannabinoid, quercetin, cyanoglucoside, etc., certain phytocon￾stituents are reported as anti-inflammatory and HPA axis modulators, for example, 
withanoloids, rosmarinic acid, ursolic acid, salidroside, baicalin profoundly reduces 
cortisol and ameliorate HPA axis. Taking into account the side effects associated 
with pharmaceutical drugs used in neuropsychological disorders, these phytocon￾stituents can act as alternative and complementary drugs and provide hope for the 
discovery of new drugs.104 NeuroPhytomedicine

6.1 NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER MECHANISM
Neurological disorders are termed as the dysfunction condition that affects the brain, 
spinal cord, and the nerves that run all over the human body. The determined cause 
of neurological disorder differs but involves genetic disorders, infections, congenital 
abnormalities, lifestyle, and some other causes including malnutrition, brain injury, spi￾nal cord injury, or nerve injury. Certain neurological disorders manifest before birth and 
are considered congenital. Some other disorders are caused by additional conditions 
like tumor, degeneration, trauma, infections, and other structural defects. The primary 
cause of neurological disabilities is due to the damage occurring in the nervous system.
There are many commonly known neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s dis￾ease (AD), autism, Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), meningitis, mus￾cular dystrophy, tumors, neuromuscular disorders, AD, learning disabilities, cerebral 
palsy, acute spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ataxia Bell’s palsy, 
brain tumors, cerebral aneurysm, epilepsy and seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, head￾ache, head injury, hydrocephalus lumbar disk disease (herniated disk), and encephalitis.
Genetic disorders arise when a harmful change to the gene called mutation takes 
place. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, the building block of genes, contains the 
instructions for cells functioning and the characteristics of every individual. Each 
biological parent contributes half to the children’s genes, and children may also 
inherit a gene mutation from one or both of the biological parents. Mutations, in the 
DNA, can cause genetic changes which could make children more likely to have a 
genetic and neurological disorder.
Genetic diseases include:
Chromosomal: The chromosomal structures that hold the genes and DNA 
within each cell are affected by this type. People with these conditions lack 
chromosome material or have duplicated chromosomes.
6The Role of Epigenetic Modifications by Phytoconstituents 115
Multifactorial complex: A combination of gene mutations and other factors is 
the cause of these disorders. They include smoking or drinking, chemical 
exposure, certain medications, and diet.
Monogenic (single gene): A single gene mutation responsible for certain disorders.
There are more than 600 neurological diseases identified according to the United 
States National Library of Medicine. A variety of symptoms can be caused by struc￾tural, biochemical, or electrical abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord, or other 
nerves including loss of feeling or tingling, weakness or loss of muscle strength, loss 
of sight or double vision, memory loss, impaired mental ability, lack of coordination, 
rigidity of the muscles, tremors and seizures, back pain that radiates to the feet, toes, 
or other parts of the body, muscle wasting and slurred speech.
6.1.1 Autism
A group of developmental disabilities characterized by stereotyped behaviors, lim￾ited interest, and abnormal social interaction and communication is termed to be 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Won et al. 2013). Kanner was the first to describe 
autism based on the observation of 11 children who appeared with “severe loneliness 
from the very beginning of life, not responding to anything that comes to them from 
the outside world” as the earliest case. He suggested that childhood schizophrenia 
could be caused by the behavioral concoction of autism, obsession, stereotypy, and 
echolalia (Kanner 1943). Autism was termed “infantile autism” in 1980, “autism 
disease” in 1987, and, more recently, “autism” or the umbrella term “ASD” from 
Kanner’s diagnosis of “childhood or early-onset schizophrenia.” It is commonly 
recognized that ASD is a condition with significant hereditary components on the 
basis of several research studies that have been conducted to elucidate the patho￾genic mechanisms underlying ASD. The concordance rates for autism in monozy￾gotic twins can outstretch up to 90%, and in dizygotic twins, it can reach up to 10% 
(Abrahams and Geschwind 2008).
6.1.2 SCD
The autosomal recessive disease, with a multisystem condition that causes progres￾sive organ failure, painful ischemic vaso-occlusion episodes, and persistent hemo￾lytic anemia. With millions of people suffering globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) 
is considered to be the most prevalent monogenetic disease. The term “sickle cell 
disease” refers to a group of ailments brought on by the inheritance of hemoglobin S 
(HbS) (Houwing et al. 2019). The sixth codon of the β-globin gene conversion was 
influencing the essential amino acid of valine production instead of glutamic acid 
causing SC (Meher et al. 2019). An aggregate of hemoglobin molecules and unsatu￾rated oxygen molecules coupled to form a specific linkage drives the formulation of a 
long chain consisting of hemoglobin molecules. Abnormal production of hemoglobin 
has turned the physical behavior of erythrocytes that intimate the actual pathologic 
indications of SCD. Repeated alignment leads to the cause of birefringent toxoids 
(Harris 1950). In the 1950 signs of SCA, including differences in heart and kidney, 116 NeuroPhytomedicine
as well as pulmonary involvement and stress. Generally, sickled cells are rigid and 
fixed and have long tapering on both ends. Capillary blockades are generated by 
these sickle cells. Sickle cell anemia also influences cardiac, disease, thrombosis, and 
infarctions. Interestingly, an SCD patient has cardiac hypertrophy without any form 
of endocardial abnormalities or myocardial damage (Zimmerman and Barnett 1944).
6.1.3 Parkinson’s Disease
The most obvious progress has been made in understanding the proximate causes, which 
stated that PD is a neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopami￾nergic neurons in the midbrain’s substantia nigra. Rather than the normal synthesis and 
pumping movement of neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in regulating the brain regions, 
up to 70% of these dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra will be killed during the 
development of PD (Zeng et al. 2018). It is a neurodegenerative disorder that gets worse 
over time and mostly affects old age people, in comparison with younger age. It is con￾sidered to be the second most neurodegenerative disease (Sherer et al. 2012).
6.1.4 Alzheimer’s Disease
Progressive mental deterioration that can occur in middle or old age as a result of 
generalized brain degeneration. It is the most common cause of early senility and 
so it is also termed as senile dementia. The disease often results in the following 
behaviors – impaired memory, thinking, and confusion. The locus coeruleus, the 
brain stem nuclei (such as the raphe nucleus), reticular formation, amygdala, substan￾tia nigra, striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and claustrum, as well as some areas of 
the cerebral cortex, are the cell types that are impacted by AD (Kocahan and Doğan 
2017). Depending on the expression of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neu￾ropeptides, different neuronal types are influenced in different regions. The degen￾erative process causes loss of neurons and brain shrinkage (Duyckaerts et al. 2009).
6.1.5 Multiple Sclerosis
The demyelinating inflammatory condition of the central nervous system (CNS), 
known as MS, is an autoimmune disease. The main pathology of MS is immune 
destruction of myelin basic protein (MBP) throughout the nervous system, especially 
brain and spinal cord (Lutton et al. 2004). Myelinated CNS tracts are the targets in 
people with MS, but the immune trigger is unknown. Breakdown of myelin sheath, 
blood-brain barrier, axonal damage, gliosis, and sclerotic plaque formation occurs 
in the region of inflammation as a result of abnormal fibrosis and hardening of the 
neuronal myelin sheath (World Health Organization 2006).
6.2 EPIGENETIC MECHANISM OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
Regions of a genome, gene products, and cellular pathways that are linked to the 
genetic disease can be regulated by epigenetic processes. The entire genome, which 
includes the loci implicated in the pathogenesis of any neurological disease with a The Role of Epigenetic Modifications by Phytoconstituents 117
hereditary component, is modulated by epigenetic mechanisms. DNA methylation, 
histone modifications, nucleosome and higher-order chromatin remodeling, ncRNAs, 
and RNA editing are some of the main epigenetic mechanisms. Neurodevelopmental 
problems are also linked to epigenetic mutations in various ways. For instance, syn￾dromic and non-syndromic forms of intellectual and developmental disability are 
brought on by mutations in a number of genes encoding proteins that both directly 
and indirectly control chromatin structure (Qureshi and Mehler 2013).
The MECP2 gene, which codes for a multifunctional protein belonging to the 
methyl-CpG-binding domain family, is one of the most important examples for Rett 
syndrome, an autistic spectrum illness, is primarily brought on by MECP2 muta￾tions, which include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and major deletion variants. 
Newborn encephalopathy, intellectual syndromic and developmental disabilities, and 
Angelman-like syndrome are also associated with MECP2 mutations (Van Bokhoven 
2011). Lysine methylation is known to be dysregulated in medulloblastoma and other 
cancers. Lysine methylation is also involved in controlling cell identity, DNA repair, 
cell cycle, stress responses, and transcription (Robinson et al. 2012). The emergence, 
progression, and risk of neurological disease can be altered by genetic variation in the 
genes encoding the epigenetic factors. For instance, brain volume measures on neu￾roimaging, indicators of illness severity, are linked with single-nucleotide polymor￾phisms (SNPs) in 3HDAC gene loci – rs2522129 (SIRT4), rs2675231 (HDAC11), and 
rs2389963 (HDAC9) (Inkster et al. 2013). Another notable example is the International 
Stroke Genetics Consortium’s huge genome-wide association research, which showed 
that an SNP in an intron of the HDAC9 gene on chromosome 7p21.1 (rs11984041) is 
linked to risk of large vessel ischemic stroke (Bellenguez et al. 2012). In the major￾ity of population-based studies, the extended haplotypes of HLA-DRB1*15 (HLA￾DRB11501-DRB50101-DQA10102-DQB10602) have been replicated and demonstrated 
to increase the risk of MS (Lincoln et al. 2005). Nearly 17 autosomal dominant and 
recessive gene mutations have been identified for the cause of variants in familial 
PD. Parkin, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), phosphatase and ten￾sin homolog inducible kinase 1 (PINK1), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and 
glucocerebrosidase (GBA) are some examples of mutation inducing genes (Houlden 
and Singleton 2012). The epigenetic mechanism of muscular dystrophy includes DNA 
methylation, histone modification, and regulatory non-coding RNA expression play a 
promising role in muscular regeneration. The Regenerative capacity is directly linked 
to the presence of satellite cells (Souza et al. 2015). Muscular dystrophy progression 
occurs due to the failure of satellite cells to divide asymmetrically and to maintain 
damage repair cycle. The lack of Dystrophin decreases the serine-threonine protein 
kinase 2 (MARK2) which leads to the abnormal mitotic division.
6.3 PHYTOCHEMICALS FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER
Neurological disorders include neurotraumatic disorders as well as neurodegenerative 
illnesses like AD, PD, Huntington’s disease (HD), MS, and lot more. Neurodegenerative 
diseases occur due to genetic and environmental factors. These neurodegenera￾tive disorders frequently exhibit neuroinflammation, deposition of certain aggregated 
proteins, and oxidative stress as pathogenic characteristics. Symptoms identified and 118 NeuroPhytomedicine
diagnosed at the early stages of disorders can be useful for the proper treatment and 
prevention to further progression and high risk of neurodegenerative illness.
6.3.1 Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate
The epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) polyphenol is the most prevalent one to be 
found in tea leaves. The chemical mechanism through which EGCG prevents the 
uptake of DA and exerts neuroprotection is what prevents neuronal cell death. Tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells are severely lost in PD, and one study found that tak￾ing EGCG and tea at the same time may stop the loss of these cells in the substantia 
nigra. By interfering with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that 
prevents the metabolism of DA, it performs this effect. Moreover, EGCG is believed 
to control the proteolytic cleavage of α-Synuclein, turning it into a less toxic form. 
Synuclein aggregates are observed in ND. In protein kinase C (PKC) intracellular 
signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells, EGCG demonstrates neuroprotection, and it 
is shown that PKC inhibitors participate in the method of neuroprotection by EGCG 
(Koh et al. 2003). The activity of EGCG is concentration-dependent and suppresses 
the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) by phosphorylating PKC. While 
EGCG at high doses tends to have anti-proliferative effects and inhibit angiogenesis, 
EGCG at low concentrations protects neurons. It inhibits oxidation at low doses, but at 
larger quantities, it has pro-oxidant characteristics (Castellano-González et al. 2016).
6.3.2 Berberine
Berberine has the ability to cease the activity of different enzymes which is impli￾cated in the development of AD. It has also been demonstrated that the ability of ber￾berine to protect the neuronal cells from neurotoxicity. Also, it has been discovered 
that berberine is effective in treating cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia. It functions 
as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced as a result of the hypoxic 
conditions, which in turn suppresses numerous agents that promote apoptosis and 
provide neuroprotection (Hsu et al. 2013). By scavenging free radicals, berberine 
activates the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway and has neuroprotective benefits. Moreover, 
it has been noted that berberine has anti-apoptotic effects via upregulating Bcl-2, 
downregulating caspase 1 and 3, and caspase 3 expression. When given for pro￾longed periods of time, berberine is to blame for the degeneration of dopaminergic 
neurons in the substantia nigra. Berberine may prevent ischemic stroke by scaveng￾ing radical species, or, to put it another way, by lowering oxidative stress (Asai et al. 
2007). Because it can solubilize β-amyloid plaques in mouse models, berberine is 
regarded to have a promising function as a treatment for AD. By reducing NeuN, 
laminin, MMP-9, and gelatinase activity, berberine is expected to lessen the effects 
of an ischemic stroke (Hong et al. 2012).
6.3.3 Curcumin
Curcumin, considered to be one of the key components of turmeric, which has a 
prominent position among Indian spices, is curcumin. Due to its therapeutic benefits, The Role of Epigenetic Modifications by Phytoconstituents 119
curcumin is used to treat conditions like diabetes, biliary diseases, coughing, and 
hepatic illnesses. Curcumin has been linked to a number of mechanisms, one of which 
is the ability to attach to amyloid plaques by inhibiting NF-, thus lowering the patho￾genesis of AD (Nam et al. 2014). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that curcumin 
promotes neuronal regeneration by enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) levels in a PD model through activating Trk/PI3K signaling pathways (Hoppe 
et al. 2013). Inflammation makes the situation worse in ND cases, and curcumin tends 
to lower IL-6 and TNF-α expression. It has been discovered that AD impairs the 
operation of brain macrophages, preventing them from phagocytosing properly.
Phytochemicals such as polyphenols, curcumin, and sulforaphane are known to 
exert a positive impact on the muscular function at the molecular level. Curcumin 
is a phytochemical component of spice turmeric, which exerts anti-inflammatory 
effects by inducing the activation of heat shock proteins (Dunsmore et al. 2001), 
oxygen free radical formation (Chattopadhyay et al. 2006), inhibiting the p38 kinase 
activity (Jin and Li 2007) and preventing the production and release of cytokines 
(Jobin et al. 1999). The effects of curcumin in preventing muscular dystrophy occur 
significantly by inhibiting the activity of NF-KB which is responsible for the loss of 
muscle mass (Penner et al. 2001).
6.3.4 Resveratrol
Resveratrol is a phenolic substance found in tea, wine, peanuts, and grapes. Further 
research revealed that resveratrol raises IL-10 levels, which restrict TNF-α and NF-κB 
levels to promote anti-inflammatory properties. After resveratrol injection, extracel￾lular signal-regulated kinase/1/2 (ERK1/2)/CREB signaling pathways were activated, 
which helps neurons survive by boosting the levels of BDNF and GDNF release 
(Anastacio et al. 2014). In the course of ND, glial cells release inflammatory cytokines 
as well as a number of neurotoxic chemicals, including nitric oxide and superoxide. 
Resveratrol provides neuroprotection by preventing glial cell activation (Ma et al. 
2014). It has been discovered that resveratrol plays a part in plaque destabilization and 
plaque prevention. In rotenone-induced PD cell models, resveratrol has neuroprotec￾tive benefits by activating the AMPK-SIRT1-autophagy pathway (Wu et al. 2011).
6.3.5 Apigenin
Apigenin is one of the phytochemical components obtained from Matricaria recu￾tita L. Apigenin is a CNS active molecule and interacts with other neurotransmission 
systems by acting as a partial agonist of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) recep￾tors. This indicates that apigenin exerts an anti-epileptic mechanism by binding with 
benzodiazepine receptors and by exhibiting reduced GABA-activated chloride cur￾rents (Avallone et al. 2000).
6.3.6 Limonoids
Limonoids are rare and highly oxygenated molecules found in plants. Due to its high 
limonoid content, Melia toosendan, a member of the Meliaceae family, contains 120 NeuroPhytomedicine
limonoids in abundance and the plant extract stimulates neuronal development 
which is similar to that of NGF (nerve growth factor), which does so by activating 
ERK and protein kinase A (PKA). It has been discovered that limonoids increase 
NGF levels in a PC12 rat cell line, promoting neuronal differentiation and prolifera￾tion (Roy and Saraf 2006). Limonoids activate ERKs and PKA to enhance neuronal 
differentiation. PKA is activated by an increase in cAMP, although limonoids can 
also activate PKA without an increase in cAMP (Yoon et al. 2015).
6.4 EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS OF THE PHYTOCHEMICAL
Nowadays, epigenetics is understood to be the study of gene function modifications 
that are heritable during mitosis and/or meiosis but do not involve a change in DNA 
sequence. Dietary phytochemicals play a significant role in the regulation of normal 
physiological processes. Natural substances called phytochemicals have been dem￾onstrated to have protection against oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The 
immune system is stimulated by phytochemicals, platelet aggregation is reduced, 
and hormone metabolism is controlled (Farooqui 2012). These phytochemicals acti￾vate stress response pathways, where the cells will encounter a defense mechanism, 
in addition to regulation of gene expression and enzyme metabolism for normal 
functioning of the body. phytochemicals participate in a downward signal transduc￾tion cascade and serve as a ligand, binding to specific receptors on cell membranes 
or nuclei thereby producing antioxidative activity (Si and Liu 2007).
The use of naturally occurring some of the dietary phytochemicals on a daily 
basis such as polyphenols, genistein, curcumin, sulforaphane, phenyl isothiocyanate, 
lycopene, resveratrol, quercetin, indole-3-carbinol, ellagitannin, and organosulfur 
compounds are used to treat several disorders including cancer. The phytochemicals 
overlap the number of mechanisms of action including the induction of detoxifica￾tion of enzymes, antioxidant effects, alteration of hormonal metabolism, etc (Wang 
et al. 2012). The dynamic nature of DNA methylation, active mechanisms for DNA 
demethylation, diverse activities of 5-methylcytosine and its oxidized derivatives, 
the incorporation of histone variations into chromatin, nucleosome occupancy, and 
dynamics are all included in the current understanding of epigenetics. These epi￾genetic alterations appear to control crucial gene networks controlling physiological 
processes linked to the health benefits of certain diets, offering a justifiable and 
straightforward method to prevent or perhaps treat these disorders. The effectiveness 
of food and exercise in treating cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
obesity, and rheumatoid arthritis and in some other neurological disorders like ADs 
(Müller et al. 2001).
Histones can undergo a wide range of changes to their amino acid residues. 
Acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation are 
some examples of histone post-translational changes. Nucleosomes are the basic 
building blocks of chromatin found in cell nuclei (Sassone-Corsi 2013). Each 
nucleosome is made up of two copies of each of the four core histones and 147 
DNA base pairs tightly wound around an octamer of histone proteins (H2A, H2B, 
H3, and H4). The DNA between the nucleosomal core particles is where the linker 
histone H1 interacts, and its job is to stabilize higher-order chromatin structures. The Role of Epigenetic Modifications by Phytoconstituents 121
Moreover, each histone protein has an N-terminal tail with numerous possible 
modification sites and a core globular domain (Wang et al. 2013). Lysine, arginine, 
serine, and threonine amino acids are the main residues that serve as the substrates 
for these changes (Rothbart and Strahl 2014). According to the position of the 
change, these modifications have been linked to the activation or repression of gene 
transcription, strongly indicating the presence of a histone code. According to this 
theory, particular histone modifications cause proteins connected to the chromatin 
to interact, resulting in a distinct regulatory response for gene expression (Strahl 
and Allis 2000).
Histone methylation is carried and there have been studies linking specific pro￾cesses to various types of changes occurring in the genes. For instance, chromatin 
aperture has been linked to H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79. Yet, several distinct roles 
have also been linked to the methylation of these residues. On the other hand, 
promoter regions have been linked to H3K4 trimethylation. H3K36 dimethylation 
has been linked to the transcription’s elongation of the RNA POL II (Lin et al. 
2007). Histone acetylation might be explained by the chemistry of the modifica￾tion, which involves adding an acetyl group (COCH3) to an amino-terminal resi￾due and lowering the positive charge of histones as a result. This interaction with 
DNA causes a small reduction in the compaction of chromatin (Shahbazian and 
Grunstein 2007).
The covalent joining of cytosine methyl groups, which are primarily found in 
the context of dinucleotide 50-CpG-3, results in DNA methylation (Klose and Bird 
2006). When DNA duplicates, a process keeps these patterns from changing because 
DNA methylation creates patterns that are set throughout embryonic development. 
A group of proteins known as DNA methyltransferases carry out the DNA meth￾ylation mechanism (DNMTs). These proteins are divided into two groups: One for 
de novo methylation and the other for methylation maintenance. Depending on the 
DNA substrate, both enzymes have different properties. For instance, DNA methyl 
transferase 1 maintains DNA methylation (DNMT1). During DNA replication, these 
proteins add methyl groups to already-existing methyl patterns on a new strand of 
DNA (Fraga et al. 2005).

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Herbal medicines and other natural therapies have been used to treat illness for cen￾turies. Chemicals such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, polyphenols, and alkaloids are 
found in herbs. Citric acid, vitamin C, and other phytonutrients found in plants func￾tion synergistically to treat a given disease or illness (Akhtar et al, 2013). Herbal 
therapeutic compounds need to have their active principle modified in a scientific 
way so that they may be used for continuous and targeted release. With this method, 
patients are more likely to take their medication as directed, and more frequent dos￾ing is not required. Nanotechnology has been shown in numerous studies to solve 
the bioavailability and toxicity problems that plague conventional dosing methods 
(Mitchell et al, 2021). From $5.2 billion in 2021, the global nanotechnology sector is 
expected to grow to $23.6 billion by 2026, a compound annual growth rate of 35.5%. 
The report comes from Business Wire (2021) and originates in Dublin.
Research into phytonanoformulations has the potential to increase the availability 
of novel products with fewer side effects than conventional and synthetic herbal for￾mulations. Many different methods of administering herbal medicines were tested to 
see if they could effectively preserve the physicochemical and biological properties 
of natural substances, despite their wide variety of molecular structures. In order to 
further expand a rigorous assessment of plant-derived pharmaceuticals in terms of 
safety and quality, the World Health Organization (WHO) has supplied the neces￾sary technical assistance.
About 65% of Indians are curious about trying out traditional medicines. Herbal 
remedies are gaining popularity even in the sophisticated world. Traditional medicines 
are always in high demand in developed countries. Just behind China is India as a 
major supplier of herbs. The Indian Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha 
and Homeopathy (AYUSH) system has a $5 billion domestic market and 8,000 herbal 
remedies. More than $500 million in annual revenue is made from the practice of 
Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. By 2023, the market for pharmaceuticals derived from 
plants is expected to generate revenues of $111.1 billion worldwide. In India, as in many 
7126 NeuroPhytomedicine
Western countries, the phytopharmaceutical industry is only getting off the ground. 
Opportunities for phytonanoformulations are promising in light of the potential for 
future growth in demand for phytopharmaceuticals as a result of advancements in 
nanotechnology and the benefits of nanoformulations over conventional commodities.
Pharmaceutical companies will be able to advance their study of phytonano￾pharmaceuticals with the use of innovative drug delivery systems (Business World, 
2021). Nanoparticles in the 1–100 nm range are synthesized for use in a wide variety 
of nanotherapeutics and diagnostic agents through the integration of scientific and 
technological skills. These are some of the ways in which nanoparticles excel over 
more conventional methods: (Pandit et al, 2022). Enhanced solubility increases bio￾availability, which in turn increases targeted drug distribution by prolonging drug 
retention in the body. Maintaining a happy medium between a medicine’s thera￾peutic efficacy and its side effects requires a service provider with extraordinary 
capability and dependability.
Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are characterized by various abnormalities in 
the structure and function of neurons and other nervous system cells. These chronic, 
deteriorating injuries can lead to mental and physical decline over time. Other forms 
of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s dis￾ease (PD) and PD-related disorders, Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) are some of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDs). Predominant risk factors for NDs are thought to include genetic predisposition, 
advancing age, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, chemicals, some viruses, and exposure 
to certain environmental contaminants (Hodjat et al, 2017; Przedborski et al, 2003). 
People are living longer than ever before, yet with that improvement in longevity 
comes an increase in degenerative brain diseases. According to a study by the WHO, 
the prevalence of death caused by dementia and other age-related NDs more than 
doubled between 2000 and 2016. The WHO (2006) predicts that in the near future, 
the healthcare system will face enormous emotional, social, and financial strain due 
to the prevalence of mental and emotional health difficulties. Existing treatments for 
NDs are not without serious side effects; new, safer approaches are needed (Durães 
et al, 2018). Natural substances cannot reach the brain and nervous system because 
of the blood-brain barrier’s (BBB’s) poor diffusion properties (Dwivedi et al, 2019). 
As a result, nanotechnology, and more especially phyto-nanomedicine or pharma￾ceutical nanotechnology, enables superior drug delivery systems for the treatment 
of NDs (Figure 7.1) by enhancing molecular monitoring, control, construction, and 
diagnostics (Maravajhala et al, 2012; Ochekpe et al, 2009). One method that shows 
promise for getting over these restrictions and increasing bioavailability is the use of 
nanoformulations of natural substrates (Ratheesh et al, 2017). The current methods 
of treating neurodegenerative diseases with pharmaceuticals are compared in this 
chapter with the potential future applications of phytomedicine and nanotechnology.
7.2 NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE
The slow and steady loss of neuronal cells is a hallmark of neurodegenerative dis￾eases. When things deteriorate here, neurons always die. This causes problems with 
walking (ataxia) or cognitive function (dementia), and balance due to a disruption in Applications of Phyto-Nanotechnology in Neurological Disorders 127
neuromuscular control (Emard et al, 1995; Higuma et al, 2017). In recent years, gait 
analysis has received a lot of attention from medical researchers. Research on gait 
issues has mostly concentrated on neurodegenerative diseases like ALS, PD, MS, 
AD, HD, and others that cause dementia. Figure 7.2 shows the different types of 
neurodegenerative diseases and their neurons.
The condition is the most common kind of dementia. Common early stage symp￾toms of AD include difficulty remembering recent events and general disorientation. 
Cognitive abilities like language and visual-spatial awareness also change over 
time. The aforementioned degradation is caused by deficits in cognition and gait 
FIGURE 7.1 Nanoparticles mediated drug delivery of phytochemicals for neurodegenera￾tive disorders.
FIGURE 7.2 Neurodegenerative diseases and the types of neurons affected (Bhattacharya 
et al, 2022).128 NeuroPhytomedicine
(Valkanova et al, 2018; Valkanova and Ebmeier, 2017). Stuttering speech, apraxia, 
and hyperkinesia are all symptoms of AD, along with unsteady walking and torso 
motion. Gait abnormalities are common in the early stages of AD and include a 
higher stride-to-stride variability, decreased cadence (longer stride time/gait cycle), 
shorter stride length, and slower gait. After AD, it is the second most prevalent form 
of neurodegeneration. Bradykinesia is a sign of PD, the most prevalent hypokinetic 
movement condition. In the latter stages of the condition, tremors, body rigidity 
(hypertonia), loss of postural reflexes, flexed posture, and freezing are characteristic 
symptoms. Patients with PD often demonstrate several gait abnormalities, including 
stride shortening, slowness, increased axial rigidity, diminished rhythmicity, and 
increased festination (Vallabhajosula et al, 2013).
MS is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes slow degen￾eration in young people. Symptoms include lethargy, weak muscles, trouble moving 
the arms or legs, clumsiness, and an overall unbalanced feeling. Gait is commonly 
significantly affected by motor weakness, spasticity, ataxia, and sensory impairment 
in the early stages of neurological diseases (Kelleher et al, 2010). The degeneration 
of motor neurons (motoneurons) in the CNS is a hallmark of ALS. Loss of walk￾ing ability is one of the first symptoms of advanced ALS. Instability in the timing 
between steps and changes in the fluctuation dynamics are two common symptoms 
of ALS (Hausdorff et al, 2000).
The dysfunctional neural process that causes HD’s dementia, tremors, and depres￾sion. Patients’ clumsiness and unsteadiness deteriorate as the disease progresses. 
HD patients walked more slowly, took shorter steps and strides, stayed still for a 
longer stance phase, and swung their arms less often (Pyo et al, 2017). In Table 7.1, 
a summary of relationships among gait characteristics and the above-listed diseases 
is given.
7.3 TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES: 
THE ROLE OF PHYTO-NANOMEDICINE
The rapid global expansion of neurodegenerative disorders (ND) during the past few 
years can be attributed to the rising global population of adults aged 60 and up. The 
main cause for concern is not the increasing number of cases, but the absence of via￾ble therapies. Evidence suggests that NDs were first identified in the early 20th cen￾tury, although this information has only recently been made public. Sadly, there are 
currently no effective therapies for these illnesses. At times, diseases can be halted 
or their progression slowed by using integrative medicine. Researchers believe that 
as the state of modern science and integrative medicine improves, the prevalence of 
scientific approaches to ND treatment will increase (Cavalu et al, 2020; Velmurugan 
et al, 2018).
Multiple synthetic pharmaceuticals have demonstrated positive results in clini￾cal trials for the treatment of chronic diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and 
autism. Many synthetic medications are unfit for therapeutic use because of their 
numerous negative side effects. Scientists are gradually shifting away from the use 
of these synthetic medications due to their negative side effects and toward the 
use of phytochemicals, which have fewer side effects. Phytochemicals have the Applications of Phyto-Nanotechnology in Neurological Disorders 129
potential to be employed as medications because of their antioxidant, anti-amyloid, 
anti-inflammatory, and anticholinesterase capabilities (Hajialyani et al, 2019; Xu 
et al, 2018).
The existence of BBB is the most significant factor limiting ND therapeutic 
options. As a result of a lot of hard work, numerous nano methods have been used to 
resolve this issue (Bhaskar et al, 2010). Many drug delivery carriers have taken an 
interest in polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) due to their large drug-carrying capac￾ity, long half-life in circulation, and resistance to drug degradation. This provides 
ligands with a wide variety of surface-handling strategies for BBB crossing (Roney 
et al, 2005). There is speculation that NP-based drug delivery systems facilitate drug 
entry across the BBB and enhance medication uptake in the brain. Nanoparticles, 
when used in medicine, are touted for their biodegradability and reduced toxicity 
to the body’s peripheral organs (Caruso et al, 2011). It is possible for both non-toxic 
and toxic nanomaterials to cross the BBB and reach the cells below. The BBB can be 
traversed by nanomaterials via paracellular pathways. In contrast, the essential struc￾ture of the BBB is preserved and the BBB is unaffected by drug administration when 
non-invasive approaches are used (Xie et al, 2019). Nanocarriers allow medications 
to be delivered to the brain without the need for injection (Poovaiah et al, 2018). The

ideal nanocarriers may be manufactured without altering the drug’s characteristics, 
as is currently believed.
Nanomaterials can alter autophagy, inflammatory events (i.e., overexpression 
and/or suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines), the BBB, and 
neuronal tissue regeneration, and they can even prevent neural apoptosis (Kim et al, 
2017; Re et al, 2012; Zheng et al, 2016). Because of their strong affinity for A, nano￾structures mitigate the disease’s negative effects on Alzheimer’s patients. However, 
nano-based techniques enhance dopamine transport and release in the brains of per￾sons with PD (Re et al, 2012).
Important advantages, such as enhanced biodegradability and biocompatibility, 
enhanced drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effectiveness, and decreased drug￾related adverse effects, may result from treating NDs with NPs (Ratheesh et al, 2017). 
Evidence suggests that the BBB can be crossed by the herbal compound ginsenoside￾NPs, which then protects nerve cells (Aalinkeel et al, 2018). The cytotoxic effects 
of A42 on human neuroblastoma SH-SYYY cells were attenuated in vitro by poly 
lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-functionalized quaternary ammonium compounds 
(PLGA@QC)-NPs, which were also found to be cytotoxic-free. AD rats treated with 
PLGA@QC)-NPs showed enhanced performance on the Morris Water Maze and the 
New Object Recognition tests (Sun et al, 2019). Choline-loaded NPs, lectin-laden 
NPs conjugated with Solanum tuberosum lectin, and bacoside (a loaded PLGA-NP) 
have all been shown to be effective therapy for AD (Li et al, 2011; Zhang et al, 2019).
Herbal extracts fortified with NPs provided many advantages to NDs, including 
improved biocompatibility and biodegradability of pharmaceuticals, enhanced ther￾apeutic efficacy, elimination of pharmacokinetic constraints, decreased side effects, 
controlled release, and precise localization of medication effects. Therapy efficacy 
could be increased with the use of a variety of nanoparticle materials that reduce 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), have powerful antioxidant properties, and prevent A 
from sticking together. Despite the fact that nanocarriers can cross the BBB more 
easily and are therefore useful weapons for delivering targeted chemicals to the 
brain, a number of challenges remain. When blood channels are manipulated, clots 
develop, or blood cells are destroyed, platelets can clump together and cause prob￾lems (Niu et al, 2019; Ramanathan et al, 2018). It’s potentially harmful if NPs aren’t 
distributed uniformly throughout the brain. The work of NPs like cerium oxide, iron, 
silica, and gold in the body is obscured by their inorganic components.
Neurotoxicity can result from a buildup of these substances in the brain due to 
their ability to alter mitochondrial activity, neuronal inflammation, autophagy, and 
apoptosis (Niu et al, 2019). Current treatments for ND appear to be inadequate, thus 
scientists are looking toward plant-based therapeutics based on nanotechnology. 
Nano theragnostic is one technique for the treatment of ND that is gaining popularity 
among scientists worldwide. It’s been found that nanoparticles can be useful in both 
medical diagnosis and treatment. Because it is so direct, Tripathy et al (2018) say, 
this treatment has a lot of weight in the medical field. It is also possible to modify the 
method for individual patients and account for variations in disease severity, which 
expands the method’s potential application (Bar-Zeev et al, 2017). Using light that 
can be adjusted to activate nanoparticles, chemical engineers have developed a new 
nanotheranostic device, greatly expanding the scope of the science (Bhattacharya Applications of Phyto-Nanotechnology in Neurological Disorders 131
et al, 2022). In Figure 7.3, a schematic illustration of nanotechnology-based therapy 
for CNS disorders.
7.4 RECENT TRENDS OF PHYTO-NEURO MEDICINE
Green chemistry and nanotechnology have recently made impressive strides, and 
these developments have the potential to greatly improve the theragnostic capac￾ities of the biological sciences (Khalil et al, 2017; Ovais et al, 2018). While this 
offers great therapeutic promise, it has not yet been applied to the development of 
therapies for NDs like PD and AD. The use of chemically synthesized substances, 
while convenient, has a number of drawbacks, including their toxicity and high cost 
(Gaude et al, 2017; Khalil et al, 2017; Ovais et al, 2017). Some of the molecules used 
in the chemical synthesis of NPs have been shown to stick to the NP surface, which 
makes them inappropriate for use in biological systems, as reported in a single study. 
As a result, there has been a shift in focus to the manufacture of materials via envi￾ronmentally friendly chemistry and processes (Emmanuel et al, 2017). Medicinal 
plants or pure phytochemicals with therapeutic qualities have traditionally been used 
in the green chemistry-based technique because they offer chelation and stability to 
nanoparticles (Ovais et al, 2017, 2018).
Biogenic gold nanoparticles derived from Terminalia arjuna have recently been 
shown to shield neurons, as demonstrated by research from the labs of Suganthy 
et al (2018). The study’s findings demonstrated that biogenic gold nanoparticles are 
not only beneficial to the neurological system but also harmless to live organisms. 
FIGURE 7.3 Schematic representation of nanotechnology-based therapy for CNS disorders.132 NeuroPhytomedicine
Low quantities of these particles inhibited acetylcholine esterase activity, slowed 
a fibrillation, and reduced the stability of mature fibrils. Trehalose improved the 
ability of the gold NPs to prevent protein aggregation and disrupt mature fibrils. 
One possible application of this is in photothermal therapy (Tripathy et al, 2018). 
For gold nanoparticles to be more effective at protecting neurons, it is desirable to 
combine them with anti-amyloidogenic drugs. A second strategy employs Bacopa 
monnieri-derived biogenic platinum nanoparticles as a neuroprotective agent. The 
use of phytochemicals to improve the performance of NPs has yielded significant 
benefits. Recently, polyphenols were added to selenium nanoparticles by coating 
them with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol found in tea. Neurons are 
protected by EGCG, and the action of amyloid-forming proteins such as amyloid 
beta, transthyretin, α-synuclein, and huntingtin is slowed. The protein Tet-1, which is 
highly attracted to neurons, was then added to these particles. The same approach has 
been taken with curcumin and its derivatives, leading to promising therapy for AD. 
Curcumin or other natural substances that assist in curing AD can be delivered by the 
use of benzothiazolinone, which has a high affinity for amyloid (Reddy et al, 2018).
To target this quality in animal models, Yusuf et al (2021) created PLGA NPs 
loaded with thymoquinone (TQ), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Male 
albino mice were treated with streptozotocin (SZT), and subsequently, they were 
given TQ-loaded PLGA NPs coated with polysorbate 80, which simulates AD 
oxidative stress by inhibiting superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (P-80-TQN). 
These nanoparticles, with an average particle size of 226 nm and a zeta potential 
of 45.6 mV, were prepared through the single-emulsion solvent evaporation process. 
Initial TQ release occurred in 2 hours, followed by a prolonged, gradual release 
(stabilized dipole-dipole interactions taking place between TQ and PLGA compo￾nents). P-80-TQ NPs were able to cross the BBB because they were aided in enter￾ing cells via LDL receptors (mediated by the polysorbate coating). These systems 
significantly altered SOD activity at the site between seven and twenty-eight days 
after their arrival (increase). Simultaneously, people were given the “Despair test” to 
assess how being in the company of animals influenced their mental health.
The spirocyclic alkaloid rhynchophylline (RIN), which is found in the Uncaria 
genus, has multiple pharmacological effects, including the preservation of nerve 
cells. RIN inhibits solubility and excessive stimulation of hippocampal neurons, 
which occurs in AD. The first study on how to make and test an injectable RIN treat￾ment for AD that targets the brain was presented by Xu et al (2020). To improve the 
therapeutic efficacy and selectivity of RIN, methoxy polyethylene glycol NPs coated 
with Tween 80 were prepared via nanoprecipitation. T80-coated RIN-loaded PLGA 
NPs are safe to use because they do not cause hemolysis. Using bEnd.3 cells to estab￾lish an in vitro BBB model, researchers looked into how these nanosystems crossed 
the BBB and found that they transported more efficiently than either free RIN or 
RIN-coated NPs. Treatment of the brain with T80 has been shown to be beneficial 
in healthy C57BL/6 mice. T80 RIN NPs increased the number of viable PC12 cells 
that had been injured by A25-35. These studies showed that enclosing RIN in PLGA 
nanoparticles did not compromise its neuroprotective properties.
In comparison to currently available treatments for neurodegenerative disor￾ders, phyto-nanomedicines have a brighter future. Nanomedicine derived from Applications of Phyto-Nanotechnology in Neurological Disorders 133
phytochemicals has the potential to cure neurodegenerative illnesses in the future 
due to its many beneficial qualities. More study is required to understand the entire 
scope of neuroprotective benefits of these substances, how they function, and 
whether or not combination therapy could be more effective as a neuroprotectant 
(Stone et al, 2020).
Phyto-nanomedicines provide unquestionable optimism for the future develop￾ment of anti-ND therapies due to their lower risk of adverse effects and enhanced 
effectiveness against their targets. There are, however, some restrictions to bear in 
mind. Kumar et al (2020) discovered there was a limitation to the effectiveness of 
nano theragnostic in treating NDs. They discovered that because each person’s brain, 
appearance, and genome are unique, there is no single approach that can be applied 
to treat a given problem across the board. Also, researcher demonstrated that the NPs 
were being absorbed too quickly, proving that this technique was ineffective. Incorrect 
injection technique may result in NPs being distributed inadvertently to different tis￾sues or organs, rather than the intended target. It is also well-known that there is no 
reliable means to monitor the progress of the treatment. This makes it challenging 
for the healthcare providers to assess the efficacy of their treatment. The treatment 
and approach are not only ineffective but also prohibitively costly. Nanoformulations, 
as depicted in Figure 7.4, are utilized to boost the efficacy of natural compounds. 
Table 7.2 summarizes the phyto-nanoformulations used in neurological disorders.
7.4.1 Protein-Based Nanoparticles
Biopolymer-based nanoparticles, especially protein nanoparticles, are extensively 
used as medical and functional instruments due to their non-toxicity and ease of bio￾degradation (Jacob et al, 2018). Proteins have numerous applications in both biology 
and industry, making them ideal building blocks for a diverse range of nanoparticles. 
Cells can take in protein nanoparticles because of their small size. Biodegradability, 
stability, and the ability to modify the surface of protein nanoparticles are just a few 
of the benefits they offer as a drug delivery system. Their particle size is simple to 
control, and they pose no toxicity issues, such as immunogenicity. The stability, effi￾cacy, and half-life of the medicine could be enhanced by preventing its breakdown by 
enzymes and elimination by the kidneys. Due to their lack of immunogenicity, many 
treatments for cancer can benefit from the usage of protein nanoparticles, tumor 
treatments, and vaccines. Protein nanoparticles can be slowly liberated from their 
biodegradable polymer capsules. When designing nanoparticles, controlling their size 
and surface area is crucial for achieving desirable pharmacological activity through 
the controlled release of active chemicals to target sites.
The protein content of silk is extremely high; in fact, fibroin can make up as 
much as 85% of the protein content (Numata and Kaplan, 2010). Na2CO3 is used 
for “degumming,” or removing the sericin layer, from silk. Indeed, this is one of 
the most common ways to obtain fibroin (Chopra et al, 2021). Fibrin nanoparticles 
are widely used because they are stable, biodegradable, immune-reaction free, non￾toxic to living tissue, and versatile. The zeta potential of fibroin nanoparticles is 
negative. When a positively charged polymer such as poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) or 
chitosan is added to the surface, crosslinking results. Many variables influence fibrin 134 NeuroPhytomedicine
nanoparticles’s release profile, formation stability, particle size distribution, and drug 
encapsulation. Factors include the fibroin’s molecular weight (MW), its crystallinity, 
the nature of the drug to be encapsulated, and the conditions of the manufacturing 
facility. Scientists have worked hard to devise methods of dispersing and utilizing 
fibroin nanoparticles in the administration of medicines because of the problems 
they can solve for low-molecular-weight drugs. Improved medication solubility, 
stability, and reduced drug breakdown and toxicity have all been shown in small￾molecule pharmaceuticals encapsulated in fibroin nanoparticles. This improves their 
receptivity to medicinal treatment.

The 585 amino acids found in HSA’s (human somatostatin) structure are respon￾sible for its 66 kDa MW (Langer et al, 2003). Blood is where HSA concentrations are 
highest. All three of the primary HSA subunits (A, B, and C) may be detected in the 
whole protein. The HSA’s major binding sites are located in subunits IIA and IIIA and 
are referred to as Sudlow’s sites I and II. (Jahanban-Esfahlan et al, 2016). HSA’s ability 
to carry other substances increases their solubility in blood means that even hydropho￾bic molecules may be transported with relative ease. The HSA can direct the delivery 
of specific substances to specific organs and tissues. For up to 10 hours, the tempera￾ture can be kept at 60°C, and the pH can change from 4 to 9. Because they are organic 
solvents, they are also quite stable (Kratz, 2008). The fact that they are entirely natural 
means that they pose no threat to human health and do not weaken the immune system 
in any way. It’s easy to use and dissolves quickly. These features account for the wide￾spread use of HSAs and bovine in studies of drug delivery and protein interactions. 
Due to HSA’s strong affinity for these compounds, a matrix of HSA nanoparticles may 
be able to effectively incorporate a wide variety of medications.
7.4.2 Polymeric Nanoparticles
PNPs are biodegradable and biocompatible polymer carriers that encase a medi￾cation within a colloidal particle between 1 and 1000 nm in size (Chopra et al, 
2021; Langer et al, 2003). Polyacrylate, polylactide, and polylactide polyglycolide 
copolymers are three of the most widely used polymers. There has been a lot of 
research done on lactide glycolide copolymer. Chitosan, alginate, and albumin are 
just a few examples of the many different types of natural polymers that can be 
used. Researchers have been studying curcumin (also known as “Indian solid gold”) 
for years to establish whether or not it is useful against cancer and other ailments. 
Animal studies have shown that curcumin can reduce the accumulation of amyloid 
beta and tau phosphorylation.
In addition, it promotes the growth of neural stem cells and new neurons in the 
hippocampus (Li et al, 2019). Curcumin’s nanoparticle form is thought to improve 
its targeting of the neurons that are damaged in AD due to the compound’s poor 
water solubility (AD). Curcumin nanoparticles coated in a PLGA that specifically 
target Tet-1 were tested for their ability to reduce amyloid and increase antioxidant 
activity in patients with AD (Mathew et al, 2012). Nanoparticles were created with 
a zeta potential of 230–220 mV and an average size of 150–200 nm by evaporating 
the solvent. These nanoparticles can produce light and are totally soluble in water. 
Cell viability assays have shown that these nanoparticles are safe for human cells to 
be exposed to. In vitro uptake fluorescence measurements showed that GI-1 glioma 
cells absorbed nanoparticles targeted with Tet-1 peptide at a much higher rate than 
they did non-targeted nanoparticles.
7.4.3 Liposomes-Based Drug Delivery Systems
Methods for carrying liposomes across the BBB remain in their infancy. Cell inter￾nalization is induced by absorption via electrostatic interactions due to negative 
charges on the BBB and cationic liposomal drug delivery methods (Joshi et al, 2015). Applications of Phyto-Nanotechnology in Neurological Disorders 137
The BBB can be crossed by equipping liposomes with glucose and GSH as nutri￾tion. Because receptor-mediated transcytosis can link specific ligands to a diverse 
set of BBB receptors, it has therapeutic potential. Nanoliposomes covalently con￾jugated with curcumin and the human immunodeficiency virus Trans-Activator of 
Transcription (TAT) peptide enhance peptide binding and BBB bridging (Noble et al, 
2014; Sancini et al, 2013). As for how TAT is taken up, endocytosis and micropi￾nocytosis were proposed to be the most common ways. Thiolmaleimide is used to 
covalently attach TAT to nanoliposomes. According to high-performance liquid 
chromatography–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS, the range of TAT-CurcNL sizes is 
between 196.5 and 3.2 nm. Absorption of nanoliposomes by human brain capillary 
endothelial cells (hCMEC and D3) was shown to rise by a factor of three after TAT 
functionalization was demonstrated by MS, confocal microscopy, and a radioactivity 
assay utilizing [3H]-sphingomyelin (Erdoğar et al, 2018).
Furthermore, Mourtas employed the thin-film hydration method to create mul￾tifunctional nanoliposomes loaded with curcumin-lipid derivatives. The commer￾cially available functionalized lipid DSPE-PEG2000SH may be traced back to 
the first reaction of DSPE-PEG2000 and 4-methoxytrityl-thiol, which resulted in 
DSPEPEG2000-S-Mmt. The DSPE-PEG2000-S-Mmt synthesis was carried out 
with the aid of DIPEA (diisopropylethylamine), which facilitated a rapid reaction 
with no byproducts (Mourtas et al, 2014). For its production, a polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) spacer was inserted between curcumin and lipids. DSPEPEG2000-SH was 
reacted with curcumin to form the DPSPEPEG2000-CURC derivative when its thiol 
protection was removed. Successful incorporation of nanoliposome membranes into 
this unique synthetic material was achieved. It has been shown that the addition of 
DIPEA to the second phenol-protons of the curcumin moiety allows for the accurate 
identification of A deposits in the postmortem tissues of AD patients. Ginkgo biloba, 
one of the most popular herbal supplements, has roots in ancient Chinese medi￾cine. The enzymes SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase 
all see an increase in activity when exposed to antioxidants in the CNS. Improved 
memory and learning abilities have been linked to Ginkgo biloba’s ability to boost 
antioxidant activity in the brain’s hippocampus (Naik et al, 2006). The niosome is 
a surfactant-based non-ionic bilayer vesicle. While liposomes can only carry hydro￾philic medications, niosomes can carry both hydrophilic and hydrophobic pharma￾ceuticals (McCall and Sirianni, 2013; Uchegbu and Vyas, 1998). Drugs used to treat 
conditions of the CNS may be able to cross the BBB within niosomes. There is a 
difference in niosome size between freeze-dried powder (661 nm) and spray-dried 
powder (680 nm). The zeta potential of spray-dried niosomes was greater than that of 
freeze-dried niosomes. Because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between parti￾cles, spray-dried noisome powders with a high zeta potential are more stable (Huang 
and Zhang, 2018; Jin et al, 2013).
7.4.4 Green Synthesized Nanoparticles
An alternative to nanotechnology that is less harmful to the environment is green 
chemistry or green technology. Several studies have shown that metal nanoparti￾cles are superior to microbes for creating nanoparticles for use in herbal extracts. 138 NeuroPhytomedicine
The organic molecules may decompose into biodegradable materials because of 
the presence of polyphenols. This ayurvedic herb, known as shankhapushpi, has 
been shown to have hypotensive, immunomodulatory, and anticonvulsant effects. 
It has been shown that iron oxide nanoparticles benefit from the antioxidant activ￾ity of the ayurvedic medication Convolvulus pluricaulis. Researchers are currently 
trying to piece together the molecular process behind these microscopic particles 
(Poka et al, 2017). In traditional Chinese medicine, the Pulicaria undulata plant 
is used as an insect repellant, an anti-inflammatory, and an anti-epileptic. AgNPs 
from Pulicaria undulata interact better with proteins as their concentration in the 
brain rises, limiting fibril formation by decreasing protein conformation and self￾association (Dehvari and Ghahghaei, 2018).
7.4.5 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and Nanofibers
Several inorganic nano-drug delivery methods have emerged as therapeutic agents 
for a variety of illnesses, including NDs. These include CNTs, calcium phosphate 
nanoparticles, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, layered double hydrox￾ides, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Availability at target sites, retention 
effect, stability, and drug accumulation can all be improved using inorganic nano￾carbon systems, which can also withstand prolonged systemic circulation. Also, 
these nanostructures can control the rate at which drugs are released, as well as help 
with drug monitoring and imaging. Furthermore, CNTs are an excellent choice for 
nanopharmacology because of their adaptability to many stimuli (including chemi￾cals, temperature, pressure, pH, and electric and magnetic fields) (Naz et al, 2019). 
The utilization of carbon-based nanostructures such as CNTs is one of the most 
important neurotech methods. CNTs, or carbon nanotubes, are a type of carbon allo￾trope having a spherical nanostructure. Research on CNTs to improve their electrical 
stimulation is widespread. PD is just one of several mental and neurological condi￾tions that can be helped by deep brain stimulation. There can be issues with the 
use of these stimulating electrodes if the immune system has an adverse reaction to 
their presence. Producing nanofibers poses less of a threat to the environment than 
doing so with CNTs. Unexpectedly, nanofibers are being used in the creation and 
production of brain prostheses. It’s possible that electrospun nanofibers will out￾perform other nano techniques in a number of settings (Ganesan et al, 2015; Modi 
et al, 2009). CNTs can be utilized as scaffolds on their own or in conjunction with 
other biodegradable biomaterials to aid in neuro-engineering applications such as 
regeneration, neuroprotection, interface, stimulation, and neuronal differentiation. 
This is due to their electrical properties, structural characteristics, and appropriate 
biological effects on cell growth (Xiang et al, 2020).
7.5 CURRENT PROS AND FUTURE SCOPE
The BBB presents a significant challenge for medications designed to treat illnesses 
of the CNS. Drug delivery systems with a phyto-nano emphasis have seen a lot 
of progress in recent years. BBB is a major obstacle to the delivery of therapeutic 
medications to damaged brain tissue since it is part of the body’s intrinsic defense Applications of Phyto-Nanotechnology in Neurological Disorders 139
mechanism. In order to develop efficient, innovative targeted-drug delivery systems, 
a thorough understanding of the functions of various brain cell types in the etiology 
of neuro-disorders is required. Although many nanoformulations have demonstrated 
encouraging results in preclinical and clinical studies, translating them from the 
lab to the bedside has proven challenging due to worries about toxicity and other 
side effects, as well as issues like aggregation and rapid clearance caused by their 
nano-size. Nanoformulations with a well-defined mechanism of action and pharma￾cokinetics that are intended for delivery to the brain should undergo extensive toxi￾cological testing, both in combination with and independently of pharmaceuticals.
7.6 CONCLUSIONS
Nanotechnology-based medicine has proven to be important in medical science, 
resulting in novel therapy options for neurological diseases such as cancer. However, 
there are some potential difficulties, such as a lack of advanced equipment for accu￾rate and scalable nanomaterial production, the difficulty of evaluating its efficacy 
and safety, and other material limits that must be addressed first. The following 
elements should make future nanoparticle manufacturing easier: (1) High efficacy 
and low cost; (2) toxicity-free, biocompatibility, and no impact on the pathological 
system, including thrombosis and inflammation; (3) the ability to penetrate multiple 
biological barriers and adequate targeting; (4) blood stability and resistance to RES 
clearance; and (5) loaded molecules with potential therapeutic efficacy on disease. 
To summarize, treating neurological problems and cancer is a difficult task. As a 
result, there is a need for multifunctional therapeutics, which might be reduced by 
using nanomaterials.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
The paradigm shift in climate patterns due to the rapidly increasing rate of environ￾mental degradation causes an increase in the chronicity of diseases. It also enhances 
the frequency of serious health issues like cancer and other severe genetic problems. 
Conventional allopathic medicine focuses solely on treating the diseases’ underly￾ing causes. However, the byproducts formed by the chemical reactions between the 
chemicals present in the medicines and the body chemicals cause serious side effects 
in the human body, which in turn cause the initiation of other health issues in the 
body. Furthermore, allopathic medicines only react with the chemicals that cause 
diseases, whereas traditional phytomedicines cause significant changes in current 
lifestyle and food habits. The primary and secondary metabolites present in differ￾ent plant species act as the major components of phytomedicines. The prevalence 
of neurological diseases is increasing in human society due to an increase in social, 
political, and economic stresses in our daily lives. The modern lifestyle based on 
rapid urbanization and nuclearization of family structures results in the prevalence 
of serious neurological health issues. Because of the disruption to our daily lives and 
economic activities, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a seri￾ous impact on our mental health. Under this circumstance, the study of neurophyto￾medicines gains importance in the field of medical science.
The advancement of science and technology facilitates the development of neu￾ropharmacology. The efficiency and interactivity of neurophytomedicines can be 
improved by using modern technologies such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, 
genetic engineering, and so on. The production rate of bioactive components in 
plants can be improved through advanced biotechnological studies. Because of the 
progress made in molecular biotechnology, proteins and nucleic acids can be stud￾ied in vitro, where they perform more effectively than in vivo, or inside the human 
body. Immune stimulators produced from plants, such as tomatine, polysaccharides, 
saponine, etc., have been shown to be more effective in the treatment of neurological 
8146 NeuroPhytomedicine
illnesses. Recombinant DNA technology, tissue culture, transgenesis, etc., are all 
examples of cutting-edge in situ and in vitro biotechnological processes that allow 
for the modification of plant metabolism, which in turn results in the production of 
secondary metabolites with enhanced in vivo activity in the human body. An effi￾cient immune response can be induced against acute neurological illnesses through 
the synthetic synthesis of plant-based consumable vaccines using cutting-edge nano￾biotechnology and genetic engineering. The advancement of neurophytomedicines 
leads to the achievement of sustainability in the treatment of neurological diseases 
and plays an important role in the achievement of sustainable development goals 
and good health and well-being. Aside from that, the growing demand for medicinal 
plants encourages plant cultivation, resulting in growth in the agricultural sector. 
The application of nanotechnology and biotechnology improves the productivity rate 
of medicinal plants, leading to the sustainable growth of the sector and an increase 
in the income of the marginal farmers attached to the cultivation process. Moreover, 
a significant portion of the tribal population of the Indian subcontinent is attached to 
the plantation and cultivation of a large section of rare plants having potential thera￾peutic characteristics. The promotion of these plants in the medical sector boosts the 
growth and development of these populations.
8.2 APPLICATION OF PHYTOMEDICINE IN HUMAN 
MEDICAL CARE
As per the report of the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and 
Statistics, Government of India, the trade of herbal medicines has been increasing 
since the last few years, indicating the increasing importance of herbal medicines 
replacing conventional allopathic medicines (Figure 8.1). India is also an important 
FIGURE 8.1 A line graph plotting the amount of the trade of herbal medicine in India in 
different years. Significant increase in the trade is observed from 2020 to 2022.Application of Neurophytomedicine 147
exporter of herbal medicines due to its rich reserves of medicinal plants. Allopathic 
medicines act based on the repair of the main cause of the disease, ignoring the 
impacts on other physiological mechanisms in the human body.
The secondary metabolites that plant species produce have immense potential to 
heal health-related issues in animals. Phytomedicines are manufactured from the sec￾ondary metabolites extracted from plants, which facilitate the overall maintenance of 
balance in the human body, whereas allopathic medicines are focused on the remedia￾tion of the cause of diseases only. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of 
plant secondary metabolites aid in the treatment of chronic health issues such as neu￾rological and other health issues. Secondary metabolites of various types, such as 
terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, and so on, effectively intervene in the human body 
mechanism and aid in maintaining the balance between the energy of movement, 
digestion, lubrication, and structure. The byproducts formed through the interaction 
between chemicals present in allopathic medicines and the human body create addi￾tional health issues, whereas the primary and secondary metabolites present in plant 
species modify the physiological mechanisms of the body. Secondary metabolites 
are now the primary ingredients in the production of various modern pharmaceutical 
products. These pharmaceutical products based on secondary metabolites are more 
effective in treating modern health issues. Climate change causes a slew of new, some￾times incurable, and undiagnosable diseases. Basically, the major use of phytomedi￾cine is for health promotion and therapy for chronic, as opposed to life-threatening, 
conditions. However, phytomedical remedies are safe to use for cancer and new infec￾tious diseases. Phytomedicines are regarded as Reese resources of biochemical, bio￾medical, and bioactive ingredients that can be used in drug development, regardless of 
whether the drugs are pharmacopoeial, non-pharmacopoeial, or synthetic. Numerous 
medicinal plants play an important role in the development of human health and sus￾tainability around the globe. As we know, the products from botanicals or plants 
are used to treat diseases or to maintain human health. Consider that phytomedicine 
takes a longer time to work compared to synthetic or chemical pharmaceutical drugs. 
Quality control and management play an important role in the collection of herbal 
medicine from various resources. Adult Russian, substitution, and lack of skilled 
personnel are the main reasons for the unavailability of genuine herbal drugs. With 
the use of advanced quality control techniques and suitable standards maintenance, 
there is a need to supervise the quality of medicinal herbal products.
The active ingredients present in plant products induce the immune system of the 
human body by accelerating the activity of lymphocytes, enhancing phagocytosis, 
and increasing the rate of interferon production. The presence of a large number of 
vitamins in plant extracts corrects the human body’s vitamin deficiency. The wide 
range of phytosterols, saponins, flavonoids, triterpenes, and carotenoids present in 
the plant species exhibit potential anti-carcinogenic activities, facilitating the use of 
herbal products in the treatment of cancer. Nowadays, the chemotherapeutic agents 
prepared from the plant extracts exhibit more efficiency in killing the tumor cells 
than the conventional chemical-based agents without exhibiting any severe side 
effects. [1] The inclusion of herbal products in the daily diet improves the immu￾nity of the human body, leading to the prevention of diseases, including infections 
caused by highly contagious viruses like COVID-19. [2] Plant species also play an 148 NeuroPhytomedicine
important role in the sustainable treatment of gynecological issues like the manage￾ment of premenstrual tension, menopause symptoms, and period pains. The daily 
consumption of plant products maintains the metabolic, emotional, and nutrient 
balance of the human body, lowering the risks of increasing blood pressure and 
diabetes and also maintaining the amount of cholesterol, triglycerides, and other 
components in the human body, mitigating the risks of severe chronic health issues. 
To treat illnesses of the nervous system, scientists have developed a wide range of 
nanomedicine approaches. Due to the fact that the human nervous system is so deli￾cate, neurophytomedicines pose less of a risk to the patient. Polymeric nanoparticles, 
dendrimers, micelles, liposomes, etc., are examples of nanosized drug carriers used 
to deliver bioactive phytochemicals to their intended sites of action.
The extraction of bioactive components from plant species is an ancient practice in 
preparing medicinal products. The integration of advanced technology in the extrac￾tion processes and analysis of the biomolecules present diversify the application of 
phytomedicines in the health care industry with greater efficiency. The emergence 
of super infectious viruses leads us to innovate new kinds of therapeutic viruses. 
The development of phytomedicines becomes a new hope in this regard due to their 
capability of improving overall body function instead of treating a particular disease. 
[3] The functional groups present in different types of secondary metabolites present 
in plant species effectively react with the proteins and affect the receptor, enzymatic, 
and transcription mechanisms of the body. Moreover, secondary metabolites are also 
capable of reacting with the purine and pyrimidine bases of DNA, resulting in a sig￾nificant alteration of the genomic sequence. In this way, herbal medicines remediate 
genetic diseases. The biotechnological modification of herbal drugs with mutagens 
plays a significant role in the treatment of cancer-related diseases (Figure 8.2). [4]
8.3 THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES 
THROUGH NEUROPHYTOMEDICINE
The disruption in the mechanism of the transformation of signals from the senses 
to the central nervous system and from the central nervous system to body mus￾cles causes the prevalence of neurodevelopmental diseases. The phytoconstituents 
present in the plant extracts form stable chemical bonds with the receptors and sig￾nals to facilitate the steady flow of signals from the nervous system to different parts 
of the human body. The interaction between the bioactive constituent and different 
biomolecules responsible for neurological activities becomes the key to understand￾ing the bioactivity of phytoconstituents in the treatment of different neurological dis￾eases. Phytochemicals facilitate the maintenance of overall chemical balance in the 
brain instead of the target-based approach of allopathic medicines. Flavonoids, phe￾nols, alkaloids, fatty acids, terpenes, saponins, etc., are some important secondary 
metabolites used for the treatment of several neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, 
and cognitive disorders. [5] Phytochemicals control the function of receptors for the 
major inhibitory neurotransmitters. Several bioactive constituents, like polyphenols, 
activate specific transcription factors that facilitate the synthesis of RNAs. These 
RNAs activate specific signal transduction pathways by the translation of favorable 
protein molecules, which results in the resistance of neurons to various stress factors, Application of Neurophytomedicine 149
leading to the prevention of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. [6] 
The neuroprotective activities of phytochemicals make the phytomedicines more 
effective toward the overall improvement of the nervous system, mitigating the risk 
of neurological diseases (Table 8.1) (Figure 8.3).
The aromatic amino acid pathway and the mevalonic acid pathway are the two 
main metabolic mechanisms that transform the polysaccharides created by photo￾synthesis in plants into bioactive components. These bioactive substances don’t con￾tribute significantly to the process of plant growth because they are byproducts of 
the metabolic process. However, these bioactive substances help the plant bodies 
defend themselves from diseases and herbivorous predators. Additionally, a number 
of bioactive elements help plants recover from nitrogenous wastes and survive in 
climatically stressful situations like drought and flooding. [7] Typically, bioactive 
substances fall into one of the groups indicated in Table 8.1.
With the exception of amides and amino acids, alkaloids are heterocyclic nitrogen￾containing chemicals that are generated from plant extracts. It has alkaline prop￾erties and is mostly produced from amino acids. Decarboxylation of amino acids 
FIGURE 8.2 Phytomedicine and health care system.150 NeuroPhytomedicine
yields amines, which interact with amine oxides to produce aldehydes, which are 
used to make alkaloids. Aldehydes and amine groups condense in a Mannich-type 
reaction to produce the distinctive heterocyclic rings of alkaloids. It demonstrates a 
wide spectrum of phytochemical properties, such as anti-malarial, anti-asthmatic, 
anti-cancer, cholinomimetic, analgesic, antibacterial, anti-hyperglycemic, vasodila￾tory, and anti-arrhythmic activity, among others. [8, 9]

The polyphenolic substances known as flavonoids are what give flowers their 
color and scent. Due to the highly conjugated heterocyclic structures present, it func￾tions as a pigment. Due to their anti-oxidative, anti-mutagenic, anti-carcinogenic, 
and anti-inflammatory properties, they are frequently used as therapeutic medi￾cines. They can also control how human cells’ enzymatic functions are carried 
out. Cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, and other major disorders are all 
treated with flavonoids’ anti-oxidant abilities. The low cardiovascular mortality 
rate of flavonoids, which has been demonstrated in recent studies on their chemi￾cal characteristics, makes a wide range of applications for them as a preventative 
measure for cardiac disorders possible. Flavonoids are essential for the growth and 
development of plants because their colorful compounds make pollination easier. 
[10, 11]
Anthocyanins are water-soluble plant pigments that are primarily responsible for 
giving fruits and vegetables their colors. These are oxygen-containing heterocyclic 
FIGURE 8.3 Phytochemicals and treatment of neurological diseases.152 NeuroPhytomedicine
compounds. The colors of the plants’ vegetables and fruits were caused by the 
oxygen atoms’ resonance effect under different pH and temperature conditions. A 
wide range of pharmacological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti￾inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-obesity actions, are also exhibited by these 
pigments. The colored ingredients reduce the risk of the onset of chronic diseases 
and oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals, such as reactive oxygen and reactive 
nitrogen species. Anthocyanins decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular illnesses 
by enhancing blood lipid profiles and biomarkers, inhibiting the growth of malig￾nant cells by downregulating cyclooxygenase enzyme activity, and inducing apop￾tosis through oxidative stress reduction and lipid peroxidation. By preventing the 
activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, it also slows the growth 
of malignancies. [12, 13]
Glycosides of triterpenes and steroids are the source of saponins, which are pro￾duced by the mevalonic acid pathway. The term “saponin” is also used to describe 
steroidal glycosides. The structural diversity of saponins’ chemical properties, which 
depends on their amphipathicity, causes the bioactivity of various compounds to 
vary. Different saponin components that are isolated from plants are being employed 
to create a variety of medicinal medicines. Saponins have anti-inflammatory, anti￾fungal, anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic phytochemical 
effects. The penetration of plasma membranes and the creation of complexes with 
sterols are evidence of saponins’ bioactivity. [14, 15]
8.4 APPLICATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN 
NEUROPHYTOMEDICINE
Nanophytomedicine is an emerging branch of medical science that deals with the 
application of nanotechnology in herbal medicine, also known as phytotherapy or 
phytopharmacology. Nanotechnology plays an important role in the effective tar￾geted and non-targeted delivery of drug molecules in medical science. The nano￾adsorbants lead to the effective adsorption of drug molecules, which exhibit more 
therapeutic activities due to an increase in bioavailability. The lower in vivo effi￾cacy of phytomedicines is due to their poor permeability, low systematic availability, 
instability, extensive first-pass metabolism, and low aqueous solubility. The interac￾tion of herbal drugs with nanoparticles increases their bioavailability in the human 
body and increases the possibility of drug molecules being delivered to the target. 
Nanoparticles are widely used as carriers of drug molecules for their increased 
chemical activity and ability to cross the tissue barrier. Specially engineered nano￾materials are prepared that are able to carry drug molecules, proteins, plasmids, 
antibodies, oligonucleotides, fluorophores, ligands, polymers, radioisotopes, tissue￾engineered products, etc., to the human body and affect desired cells. Some nanoma￾terials, such as dendrimers, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, 
carbon nanotubes, mesoporous silicon, quantum dots, nanocrystals, nanospheres, 
phytosomes, etc., participate in drug delivery mechanisms. The aqueous solubility 
and permeability of the blood-brain barrier of the phytomedicines can be improved 
by reducing the size of the drug molecules to the nanoscale. The flavonoids and lig￾nins present in the Cuscuta chinensis plant exhibit improved bioavailability and Application of Neurophytomedicine 153
adsorption capability in the human body after being reduced to nanosize by the 
nanosuspension method. The rate of diffusion of the suspended nanomedicines 
is higher than that of phytomedicines into the gastrointestinal medium. The drug 
delivery mechanism of herbal drugs can be increased by increasing their solubility, 
enhancing their stability, reducing their toxicity, improving their macrophage distri￾bution mechanism, and enhancing their pharmacological activities. Nanotechnology 
ensures the targeted delivery of phytomedicines in a cell- or tissue-specific way 
through the development of effective drug carriers. The increase in solubility and 
permeability of the phytomedicines leads to the transcytosis of neurophytomedi￾cine across tight endothelial and epithelial cells. Nanotechnology also facilitates the 
therapeutic modality of combination therapy by enabling the co-delivery of two or 
more phytomedicines in the human body. The integration of phytomedicines with 
the nanopolymers increases the systemic drug concentration, leading to an improve￾ment in anticancer efficacy. [16]
Nanobioremediation is the application of nanotechnology to prevent environmen￾tal degradation, where the nanoparticles, having more chemical reactivity due to 
having more surface area per unit mass, react with the pollutants to form less harm￾ful products or adsorb the pollutants to make them immobile, preventing the pol￾lutants from contaminating the environment. Nanomaterials developed in different 
forms like nanotubes, nanowires, films, quantum dots, colloids, etc. are placed in 
the contaminated groundwater and soil in the form of fertilizers, pesticides, fun￾gicides, composts, etc. that also intensify the activity of plants in the uptake of the 
toxicants  from the soil and groundwater, facilitating the process of purification. 
Nanoparticles prevent the contamination of toxicants in soil, groundwater, and sur￾face water by reducing or oxidizing the contaminants, immobilizing the contami￾nants by combining with them, forming a wall between polluted and pure water to 
prevent the spread of pollutants, etc. [17] Nanomaterials are instructed to be more 
economical, efficient, and eco-friendly than the prevailing materials in each resource 
conservation and protection setting. [18]
The pharmacokinetic mechanism of phytomedicines can be studied by the inte￾gration of nanosensors with the phytomedicines. Smart pills are being developed by 
incorporating nano-based electronic devices into pharmaceutical pills that perform 
advanced imaging, sensing, and drug delivery. It enables medical practitioners to 
track the delivery pathway of drugs in the human body and study the mechanism 
of drug activity. “Atmo Gas Capsule” is an advanced smart pill that examines the 
activity of gaseous substances in the human body. Smart sensor capsules are pre￾pared with advanced nanotechnology that is used along with the vaccines to monitor 
the activity of the vaccines in the human body. It is also able to be consumed orally 
instead of by injection. This is a groundbreaking innovation in the field of research 
in medical science. Nanopatch vaccines use nanoparticles to deposit the vaccines 
on immune cells present in the skin and lower the risk of infection. It is an easier 
vaccination process and eliminates the need for vaccine refrigeration. [19]
Nanoflares are specially engineered nanomaterials in the field of cancer treat￾ment. It effectively detects the presence of cancer cells in the bloodstream. It is able 
to bind with the genetic target in cancer cells and generate light when the target 
genetic sequence is found.154 NeuroPhytomedicine
When nanobots, advanced robots created with nanotechnology and robotics, are 
inserted into the human body, they act as miniature surgeons. It effectively repairs 
the intracellular structures, resulting in the healing of particular diseases within 
the human body. The DNA-based nanobots are also prepared for the eradication of 
genetic diseases by modifying the target genome sequence. Nanomaterials also act 
as effective carriers of genetic material in the body (Figure 8.4). [20]
8.5 APPLICATION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BETTER 
USE OF NEUROPHYTOMEDICINE
Biopharmaceutical technology focuses on the synthesis of pharmaceutical prod￾ucts from biological resources instead of synthetic chemicals, which increases the 
efficiency of medicinal products by reducing the side effects. Biotechnology plays 
FIGURE 8.4 Neurophytomedicine and nanotechnology.Application of Neurophytomedicine 155
an important role in the treatment of acute diseases like cancer and other genetic 
diseases through targeted and non-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal 
therapy, targeted drug delivery, gene therapy, the manufacture of vaccines, etc. The 
plant extract can become a potential component of chemotherapy that reduces the 
possibility of effects on healthy cells during the time of chemotherapy. Bio-based 
nanomaterials like cantilevers (a biosensor-based nanomechanical system) and den￾drimers (a nanopolymeric dendritic structure that carries drug molecules in the core) 
are potential carriers of drug molecules that ensure the targeted delivery of drugs 
with higher efficiency. Nowadays, vaccines are developed based on advanced bio￾technology like genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc., which 
is likely to reduce the possibility of genetic diseases in the near future. Moreover, 
gene therapy is proven to be more effective in healing the carcinogenic effects in the 
human body. The advancement of biopolymer technology is one of the latest addi￾tions to the pharmaceutical industry. Biotechnology has recently improved to the 
point where advanced genetic engineering can help agriculture expand sustainably 
and environmentally. Through modern recombinant DNA technology and transgen￾esis, the phenotypic traits of crops can be adjusted, resulting in the cultivation of 
advanced, healthy herbal crops. Plant genome modification can also be used to grow 
pest-resistant crops. The contaminants can be successfully remediated from the soil 
and water by the application of nanoparticles with fertilizers, which leads to the 
improvement of soil health followed by the boosting of agricultural productivity. The 
development of key medicinal crops through the 4th generation technology revolu￾tion will make it easier to achieve sustainable growth in the medical sciences as well 
as the agricultural sector (Figure 8.5).
Neurohormesis characteristics of several phytochemicals facilitate the prep￾aration of optimum doses for the effective treatment of several neurodegenera￾tive diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s diseases, epilepsy, etc. The hormesis 
effects of the apparently toxic phytochemicals increase the immune response and 
mitigate the risk of neurological diseases. Several phytochemicals, such as res￾veratrol, catechin, sulforaphane, hypericin, allicin, and others, induce adaptive 
stress response signaling pathways, resulting in improved resistance to injury and 
disease. The hormesis characteristics of the phytochemicals increase the hemody￾namic characteristics of the body, leading to the effective management of mental 
and physical stresses caused by aging. The neuron cells are more susceptible to 
damage with age due to the rapid rate of DNA damage. Neurohormesis enables the 
repair of damaged DNA, resulting in a decrease in the rate of cell death through 
radical scavenging and increased antioxidant activities of the phytochemicals. 
Mitohormesis is the process of exhibiting hormesis activities by interacting with 
the mitochondria, which play a central role in bioenergy production and nutri￾ent metabolism. Berberine, an alkaloid extracted from Coptidis rhizoma and 
Hydrastis canadensis, directly interacts with mitochondria through the electron 
transport chain and reduces the oxidative stresses generated in the neuronal cells. 
The consumption of epicatechin, an important bioactive component belonging 
to the flavonol group, leads to the improvement of the cognitive function of the 
human brain by modifying neuronal spine concentration, hippocampal angiogen￾esis, and memory function. [21]156 NeuroPhytomedicine
8.6 FUTURE PROSPECTIVE OF PHYTOMEDICINE 
IN DISEASE CONTROL
The ongoing environmental issues related to climate change lead to serious health 
problems in humans. The conventional allopathic medication process becomes 
incapable of dealing with these ongoing challenges as it is unable to cure the 
root causes of the diseases. Under this scenario, traditional medicinal practices 
like Ayurveda are gaining importance. The importance of phytomedicine is 
increasing day by day in order to achieve sustainability in the health care sector. 
Under these circumstances, the advancement of phytomedicine with the help of 
modern technology becomes a necessary step in order to improve the health of 
humans. The application of modern technologies like nanotechnology, biotech￾nology, and genetic engineering improves the quality and efficiency of phyto￾medicines. The genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic study of medicinal plants 
leads to the  advancement of phytomedicines. Biotechnology will increase the 
FIGURE 8.5 Neurophytomedicine and biotechnology.Application of Neurophytomedicine 157
productivity and efficiency of medicinal plants, resulting in advancements in both 
the health and agricultural sectors. The application of nanotechnology enables 
sustainable and eco-friendly growth of medicinal plants by increasing productiv￾ity through the application of nanofertilizers and nanoremediators. The in vivo 
efficacy of neurophytomedicines will be increased by the application of nanocarri￾ers that will lead to effective targeted and non-targeted drug delivery. The produc￾tion of bioactive secondary metabolites will be increased in the plant body by the 
application of specially engineered genes through nanocarriers. The phytokinetic 
study of neurophytomedicines can be improved by using nanosensors, which will 
allow for a more detailed in vivo study of neurophytomedicine mechanism. The 
neuroinformatic study reveals the detailed biological mechanisms of the nervous 
system, whereas the bioinformatic study of the plant extracts leads us to study 
the bioactive mechanisms of phytoconstituents. It results in the development of 
more effective neurophytomedicines for the sustainable treatment of neurological 
diseases (Figure 8.6).
FIGURE 8.6 Future prospective of neurophytomedicine.158 NeuroPhytomedicine
The detailed study of neuroinformatics facilitates the preparation of databases 
for the biological functions of the nervous system. The neuroinformatic study of all 
sensory, motor, and interneurons activities must be improved in order to develop 
effective phytotherapeutic techniques for the treatment of nervous system dysfunc￾tions as well as psychological disorders.
Moreover, the phytochemicals have the potential to act as potential biomarkers by 
effectively interacting with the DNA, proteins, and other biomolecules. It will help to 
study the pharmacokinetic mechanism of the medicinal products within the nervous 
system, leading to the development of research in the fields of neurology, pharmacol￾ogy, and herbal medicine.
Modern biotechnological innovations enable the development of new herbal 
plants that produce more medicinal secondary metabolites. It will facilitate the 
development of the field of herbal medicine and also improve the pharmacokinetic 
efficiency of the phytochemicals in the nervous system.
The development of nanophytomedicine improves the in vivo efficacy of phyto￾medicines by improving phytochemical bioavailability and delivery mechanisms in 
the body.
The promotion of neurophytomedicine also facilitates the development of tribal 
populations, as a large proportion of herbal plants belonging to tribal areas have 
potential therapeutic properties. It also increases the availability of herbal drugs. 
Furthermore, many tribes have unique knowledge about the use of phytomedicines 
that can be incorporated into formal medical sciences for the benefit of both sides of 
society. The use of nanotechnology and biotechnology increases the in vivo effi￾cacy of neurophytomedicines by increasing the solubility and bioavailability fac￾tors of herbal products. The phytochemicals have already shown efficiency in the 
treatment of serious pandemics like COVID-19. The mental stress and trauma gen￾erated due to the change in social behavior resulting from the recent outbreak of 
COVID-19 viruses can be effectively mitigated by the use of phytomedicines. The 
health policy should focus on increasing the acceptability of neurophytomedicines 
by replacing traditional allopathic medicines for the effective treatment of sensi￾tive nervous system diseases as well as behavioral disorders. Neurophytomedicines 
require additional in vitro and in vivo research before they can be used effectively. 
The promotion of traditional Ayurvedic plant products in the treatment of chronic 
diseases enhances the scope of rural employment and income for small and marginal 
farmers associated with it.
8.7 CONCLUSION
The allopathic approaches to medicinal treatment based on the remediation of a 
target disease are becoming an outdated idea in today’s scenario as the prevalence 
of chronic diseases is increasing due to the changing nature of the environment. 
The improvement of overall body function and the boosting of the immune sys￾tem become the basis of modern medicinal treatment, just like in ancient times. 
Phytomedicines are gaining importance in the effective treatment of chronic dis￾eases due to their potential to improve the efficiency of removing the root cause 
of disease by keeping the balance among the physiological, mental, and emotional Application of Neurophytomedicine 159
health of human beings. The nervous system is one of the most important and sensi￾tive physiological systems, as it controls other body functions. The risk of allopathic 
neurological disease dosage increases due to the risk of side effects causing major 
damage to healthy neurons. On the other hand, herbal medicines focus on the repair 
of the overall nervous system, reducing the risk of side effects. The advancement of 
modern technologies like nanotechnology and biotechnology improves the efficiency 
of phytomedicines. The rapid development of the field of bioinformatics leads to the 
emergence of neuroinformatics, which enables the detailed study of the mechanisms 
of the nervous system. In this way, the field of herbal medicine is developing through 
the application of advanced techniques. The adoption of ayurvedic medicine instead 
of conventional allopathic medicines promotes the healthy growth of the human 
population under the current challenges of global warming and climate change. The 
increasing use of phytomedicines also facilitates the egalitarian economic develop￾ment of society by expanding the scope of the primary sector. The improvement of 
tribal populations is also another component of the promotion of Ayurveda. The 
emergence of neurophytomedicine plays a significant role in the achievement of sus￾tainable development in the health sector. It also promotes economic growth and the 
development of the economy.

Role of 
Phytopharmaceuticals as 
Adjuncts in Treatment of 
Glioblastoma Multiforme
Ameya Kothekar, Rajesh Pradhan, 
and Rajeev Taliyan
9.1 INTRODUCTION
Glioma is an aggressive type of solid tumour associated with the central nervous sys￾tem (CNS) which develops from the glial cells or supporting cells. According to the 
latest, World Health Organization (WHO) classification gliomas are further divided 
into classes/grades I, II, III, and IV. This classification is done based on pathological 
examination of the malignancy degree of the tumour utilizing molecular informa￾tion (Louis et al, 2016). This classification is important in the clinical scenario as 
it helps in determining the type and mode of treatment. Grade I tumours are slow￾growing neoplasms that can be treated surgically. Grade II tumours are tissue inva￾sive and have a high chance of recurrence despite their low capacity for proliferation. 
Grade IV gliomas are the most treacherous and it is the final stage where the tumour 
becomes malignant with a significant risk of death (Louis et al, 2014).
Glioblastoma/glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), with a WHO grade 4, is the most 
advanced malignant brain cancer. It is the second most common brain tumour after 
meningioma. Intracranial radiation, ionic radiation, and rare genetic disorders like 
type 1 and 2 neurofibromatosis are the major factors responsible for GBMs (Salvati 
et al, 2003). However, other factors like environmental stresses, smoking, drink￾ing, and organochlorides from pesticides have shown no conclusive proof to cause 
GBM. Poor prognosis and a median patient survival time of 12–15 months after 
diagnosis are the major concerns in GBM (Wen and Kesari, 2008). In total, 95% of 
the tumours arise in the supratentorial region and less than 5% originate in the cere￾bral hemispheres and brainstem (Nakada et al, 2011). Though the occurrence of this 
cancer is lower than other cancers like colon, lung, and breast cancer, the average 
years of life lost is about 20 years, thus representing a significant problem in oncol￾ogy. Moreover, the prognosis of GBM has hardly changed since the early 1970s. 
Even after decades of study, glioblastoma is still one of the most dangerous and 
feared cancers. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms must be well studied which 
can help in better managing and designing effective therapeutic regimens with 
significant results. The first line of treatment is still surgery by chemotherapy and

radiation. Despite its moderate effect and debatable efficacy, chemotherapy has been 
a routine therapeutic option for glioblastoma. The role of chemotherapy is impor￾tant in treating glioblastoma. GBM is renowned for the development of chemoresis￾tance. This is a key impediment during the development of an effective therapeutic 
regime. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, is the first line of drug 
for GBM. Methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase (MGMT), a TMZ metabolite, 
induces intrinsic resistance to TMZ and is the reason for complications associ￾ated with TMZ. After, many studies aimed to explore more effective and efficient 
chemotherapeutic targets, bioactive has emerged as excellent adjuncts to traditional 
chemotherapy. Plants have a vast array of phytochemicals with the capacity to target 
invasive brain tumours and alter oncogenic pathways to aid in causing apoptosis. 
These phytopharmaceuticals also inhibit the activity of various oncogenic proteins 
that are overexpressed in cancer and are responsible for invasion, metastasis, chemo￾therapy resistance, and angiogenesis.
In this chapter, the scope of the bioactive as anti-cancer agents against GBM has 
been discussed. This chapter also includes their mechanism of action, associated 
limitations, and regulatory considerations.
9.2 PATHOGENESIS OF GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME
Understanding the pathophysiology is essential for creating prospective chemothera￾peutic drugs as well as for discovering disease biomarkers (refer Figure 9.1). Based on 
the presence or absence of lesions, GBM can be divided into two categories: Primary 
and secondary. Primary GBM arises without any pre-existing tumours or neoplasia 
(Agnihotri et al, 2013). Secondary tumours develop from precursor lesions like astro￾cytoma or from other lower-grade gliomas within 5–10 years of diagnosis (Cloughesy 
FIGURE 9.1 Schematic drawing depicting characteristics of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 163
et al, 2014). Based on the transcriptional characteristics, previously there were four 
classes of glioblastoma classical, neural, pro-neural, and mesenchymal. However, 
comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the GBM tumour transcriptome points 
towards the existence of three distinct forms of GBM, that is, classical, pro-neural, 
and mesenchymal. Tumour-specific biomarkers play an important role in the identifi￾cation of therapeutic targets. MGMT, IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) 1, and IDH2 are 
some of the most common biomarkers of glioblastoma (Marumoto and Saya, 2012). A 
representative diagram for the pathogenesis of GBM has been depicted in Figure 9.1.
9.2.1 Unique Histopathology of Glioblastoma Multiforme
GBM is characterized by small cells with polymorphism, anaplasia, and significant 
anisokaryosis. These cells are polygonal or spindle-shaped containing acidophilic 
cytoplasm and indistinct cellular borders. Their nuclei are oval or elongated, with 
coarsely clumped hyperchromatic chromatin and numerous discrete nucleoli in 
the  centre or peri-centre. Conventional histologic characteristics of glioblastoma 
include cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, a high mitotic index, and pseudo￾palisading cells. These pseudopalisading cells are exclusive to malignant glioma and 
serve as a protective barrier. Therefore, these cells are used as prognostic markers 
for advanced glioma. In glioblastoma, dense migratory zones of cells surround the 
necrotic tissue and are termed pseudopalisades or “false palisades.” Necrotic foci 
are among the most distinctive characteristics of GBM and have two distinct forms. 
One type is within the tumour’s central region and is a result of insufficient blood 
supply. The other form consists of tiny, irregularly shaped necrotic foci surrounded 
by radially oriented pseudopalisading zones. Due to vascular collapse and necrosis, 
the pseudopalisading cells co-localize to fulfil their oxygen demand. This vicious 
cycle is the primary malignant pathway in cases of glioma. The presence of hypoxia 
also causes the activation of perivascular glioma cells. This leads to the generation of 
pro-angiogenic molecules that drive the formation of a new vasculature that increases 
and hastens the progression of GBM. Excessive vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) expression also causes endothelial cell over-proliferation, resulting in leaky 
and damaged blood vasculature. This inhibits the delivery of oxygen, medicines, and 
immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.
9.2.2 Oncogenic Pathways
Many critical cellular functions, such as growth, differentiation, metabolism, and 
survival, are regulated by signal transduction pathways. In human cancer, many 
of these signalling pathways are disrupted. The biology and clinical behaviour of 
GBM have tremendously benefited from research into these signalling pathways 
(Figure 9.2). A more comprehensive understanding of signal transduction will aid in 
the development of innovative therapies for this deadly disease.
In patients with GBM, the expression of 12 genes were found to be strongly 
associated with the characteristic mortality rate. These 12 genes are E2F2 (cell 
cycle signalling pathway), CTBP2 (Notch signalling), MAFF (Nrf2 signalling), 
SLC2A3 (Nrf2 signalling), ECSIT (PI3K signalling), HSP90B1 (PI3K signalling), 164 NeuroPhytomedicine
TNFRSF1A (PI3K signalling), PAK1 (RTK signalling), ID4 (TGF- signalling), 
DDB2 (p53 signalling), MDM2 (Han et al, 2022; Sanchez-Vega et al, 2018). Also, 
various growth factor receptors corresponding to different oncogenic signalling 
molecules like EGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR are overexpressed in cases of GBM 
(Nakada et al, 2007). Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) is a type 
of receptor tyrosine kinase that is needed for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) during developmental stages. c-Met shows abnormal expression in malig￾nant gliomas like GBM which can be attributed to its aggressive malignancy. These 
growth factor receptors are involved in RTK type of paracrine/autocrine signalling. 
Some other RTKs unique to GBM are tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and 
EGF-like domains 1 (TIE1), discoidin domain receptor (DDR1), epoxide hydrolase 
(EPH1), and Axl. These play an important role in glioma invasion by suppressing the 
immune system. Recently, researcher identified ring-like contrasts which surround 
the tumours in MRI images and concluded that these contrasts indicate angiogenic 
changes during the progression of GBM. Along with VEGF and VEGFR, fibronec￾tin, tenascin-C, and vitronectin along with cathepsin B and matrix metalloprotein￾ases (MMPs) are the key angiogenesis factors in glioblastoma. These prevent ECM 
degradation via the regulation of collagenase expression. Aberrant activation and 
overexpression tumour suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), 
sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), Rho kinases, and GPCRs of RTK/PI3K/Akt 
cascade (refer Figure 9.1) are prominent in cases of GBM (Sanchez-Vega et al, 2018). 
Integrins like β1 and β5 are linked with invasion and migration. RAC of the Rho 
GTPase family is involved in lamellipodial formation which is important in tumour 
migration. Identifying the mechanisms that contribute to the increase of oncogenic 
signalling and other pathways during glioma growth is critical. Such researches lead 
to the discovery of new prospective targets, better therapeutic regimen selection, and 
personalized medication.

9.3 THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO GBM
Every year cancer claims millions of lives globally. Due to this, innovative and novel 
cancer therapeutic approaches are underway. Diagnostic technologies play an impor￾tant role in the development of therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Surgery, 
radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are the most common treatment options whereas 
hormonal therapy and immunotherapy are some of the recent options. GBM is a type 
of brain cancer that is the cause of many hindrances during the development of a 
therapeutic approach. Some of them are:
• Intracranial malignancy.
• The danger of irreparable damage to the brain during surgery.
• The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents drugs from entering the brain.
•  ATP-binding cassettes efflux drugs from the BBB.
• Resistance of tumour cells to chemicals.
• Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases inhibit complement-mediated tumour 
repression.
Thus, the majority of the treatment options are focused on symptomatic relief 
(palliative treatment) and improving the patient’s life expectancy. While designing 
any treatment option for cancer, certain factors should be taken into consideration. 
These are tumour location, potential symptoms, potential benefits, and associated 
limitations.
9.3.1 Surgery
Surgery is one of the oldest yet the go-to options during the initial stages of can￾cer. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy follow surgery if only surgery is not 
an option. The surgery is carried out to remove the tumour and some of the sur￾rounding tissue to prevent metastasis. But it is hardly effective when the tumour 
has undergone aggressive metastasis. There are three stages to surgery. The first 
is the diagnosis in which a biopsy is used to diagnose the type of cancer. The 
second is staging where the size, metastasis rate, and other parameters are evalu￾ated. The last step is the surgical removal of the tumour by debulking or pal￾liative surgery. Maximal safe resection is the most effective and safe surgical 
procedure in which the glioma is excised while ensuring maximum preservation 
of the surrounding neurological tissues. This can also be achieved by the use of 
5-aminolevulinic which defines the tumour region for safe resection. But before 
this, some preoperative procedures like MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and navi￾gated transcranial magnetic stimulation need to be conducted to effectively map 
the surgical procedure.
9.3.2 Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy is typically administered following surgery. Comparative studies 
have shown that combining surgery and radiation therapy is more beneficial than 166 NeuroPhytomedicine
either procedure alone. If surgery is not an option due to the location of the tumour, 
radiation can be considered the sole therapeutic option.
• TMZ is used in conjunction with radiotherapy to improve the tumour’s sen￾sitivity to radiation.
• The current standard of therapy includes over six to weeks with three￾dimensional conformal beam or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) 
(2 Gy per day for a total dose of 60 Gy) with concomitant TMZ chemo￾therapy at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 
7 days per week followed by a maintenance dose.
• Proton therapy which uses charged particles (protons), is used to treat deep￾brain gliomas.
9.3.3 Chemotherapy
Due to high mortality and limited therapeutic options for GBM, innovative and novel 
cancer therapeutic approaches are underway. While developing the treatment regime, 
particularly for GBM, many factors need to be considered. These are as follows:
• BBB permeability.
• ATP-binding cassettes (e.g., P-gp) which efflux drugs from the BBB.
• Resistance of tumour cells to chemicals.
• Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases inhibit complement-mediated tumour 
repression.
Chemotherapy, one of the most widely explored treatment options in cancer, has 
unfortunately not shown much of a positive effect on GBM. Figure 9.3 illustrates 
the mechanism of action of TMZ (a prodrug), an alkylating and antineoplastic 
medication that is taken orally. It has a bioavailability score of 0.55. It is also used 
during the treatment of recurrent or progressive GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma. 
About 50% of the patients treated with TMZ do not respond positively due to overex￾pression of its metabolite MGMT and lowered rate of DNA repair due to overexpres￾sion of Mdm2, a p53 antagonist (Jiapaer et al, 2018).
The activity of the gene MGMT is a major reason for the less efficacy of TMZ 
treatment. MGMT encodes a protein that repairs the alkylated DNA (repair at the 
alkylated O6 position of guanine) in turn promoting tumour growth.
About 50% of the patients treated with TMZ do not respond positively due to 
overexpression of its metabolite MGMT and lowered rate of DNA repair due to over￾expression of Mdm2, a p53 antagonist (Jiapaer et al, 2018). One of the most impor￾tant hindrances in TMZ therapy is the activity of the gene MGMT. MGMT encodes 
a protein that repairs the alkylated DNA (repair at the alkylated O6 position of gua￾nine) in turn promoting tumour growth.
Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is used to suppress angiogenesis 
(targets VEGF) but has not shown much efficacy in GBM. Similarly, cilengitide, the 
αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrin inhibitor is a pentapeptide that has passed multiple clinical 
studies in GBM but has not been further explored as an anticancer medicine because Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 167
FIGURE 9.3 Mechanism action of TMZ against GBM.168 NeuroPhytomedicine
its combination with TMZ failed to enhance treatment outcomes in a phase III trial 
(Nabors et al, 2015). Figure 9.4 illustrates molecules targeting peripheral tumour 
targets like tyrosine kinase receptors, PI3K, and mTOR. But these drugs have rela￾tively high toxicity and adverse effects as the targets are required extensively in nor￾mal cellular function. Furthermore, with the rising lifespan of the world population 
and the higher prevalence of GBM in senior patients, elderly patients have become 
one of the reasons for poor prognostic factors in GBM. The physical health of senior 
patients, as well as whether medication damage to the ageing brain is irreversible, 
are considerations that must be considered during the drug development and opti￾mization process.
9.3.4 Shortcomings of Chemotherapy
In chemotherapy, the type and the concentration of the drug decide the side effects of 
that drug. These can be acute as well as chronic. Some of these side effects include:
1. Immunosuppression: Depression of the immune system accompanied by 
myelosuppression and neutropenia.
2. Hair loss: One of the most common side effects. Continuous and high doses 
of drugs like doxorubicin and paclitaxel can lead to alopecia totalis (com￾plete loss of facial and skull hair).
3. Teratogenicity: Physical abnormalities in the foetus during pregnancy (gen￾erally first trimester) are called teratogenicity. For example, arsenic and 
thalidomide (promyelocytic leukaemia).
4. Organ toxicity: Most common are cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and 
nephrotoxicity due to anti-cancer drugs like doxorubicin and epirubicin. 
Myelotoxicity is a side effect of 5-fluorouracil.
FIGURE 9.4 Different bioactive small molecule compounds targeting peripheral molecular 
targets.Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 169
5. Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment: Characterized by fatigue and an 
overall decrease in concentration and other neurocognitive issues.
Some of the major limitations of chemotherapy in cancer are as follows:
1. Shows limited application in stage 4 cancers.
2. Permeation through the BBB: Only small and lipophilic molecules like 
TMZ can cross the BBB and the cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of trans￾porter pumps like p-glycoprotein expels drugs from the BBB into the sur￾rounding capillaries. P-glycoprotein, also known as ATP-binding cassette 
sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), expels xenobiotics from the intestinal 
cells to the lumen, from hepatocytes in the bile ducts, and reabsorbs the 
drugs from the convoluted tubules in the peritubular capillaries.
3. DNA repair enzymes: These enzymes help in the repair of DNA damage. 
But, alkylating agents like TMZ also induce DNA damage to induce apop￾tosis. But the DNA repair enzymes also tend to repair this damage thus 
inhibiting apoptosis.
4. Gene over-amplification: The anti-cancer drug fails to prevent multiple 
expressions of the amplified genes. This reduces the drug’s efficacy over 
time.
These limitations have led to the development of various other techniques which 
can help in increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Nanomedicine deals with the 
development of biocompatible systems which can help in targeted drug delivery. 
Use of extracellular vesicles like exosomes which act as biologically compatible and 
low immunogenic nanocarriers for small and low molecular weight drugs. The use 
of phytopharmaceuticals either coupled or independent has also shown promising 
effects, for example, curcumin, due to its chemoprotective and cytotoxic effects, has 
been used as an adjuvant in many drug combinations. But these all techniques are 
under study and research as much is yet to be elucidated to fully adopt these systems 
as anti-cancer strategies
9.4 BIOACTIVE PHYTOPHARMACEUTICAL AS ADJUNCTS 
TO CHEMOTHERAPY
A phytopharmaceutical drug is a purified and standardized fraction of an extract of 
a medicinal plant or part of it that has a minimum of four bioactive or phytochemi￾cal compounds that have been tested for their quality and quantity. This fraction can 
be used internally or externally in humans or animals to diagnose, treat, mitigate, 
or prevent any disease or disorder, but parenteral administration is not included. 
So, it becomes imperative to discuss the bioactives or phytochemicals used in these 
phytopharmaceuticals. While dealing with cancer, it is important to note that it 
involves many signalling cascades and protein interactions at the cellular as well as 
the genetic level. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to develop targeted therapy. 
But here is where the bioactives have an upper hand. One of the most important 
properties of natural products is a multi-targeted effect and less toxicity. Several 170 NeuroPhytomedicine
bioactive chemicals derived from medicinal plants have also been found to inhibit 
angiogenesis and delay metastasis. According to reports, bioactive substances affect 
carcinogenesis-related intracellular signalling too. Moreover, the effective doses of 
most phytopharmaceuticals do not exert any toxicities or side effects making them 
ideal anticancer agents.
9.4.1 Resveratrol
Resveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenolic phytochemical. 
“French Paradox” was where the role of resveratrol (refer Figure 9.5) present in red 
wine was first considered to be cardioprotective. Multiple clinical trials have evaluated 
and confirmed its anti-oxidant, analgesic, cardioprotective, and chemo-preventive
properties (Kiskova et al, 2020; Liu et al, 2015; Riba et al, 2017). Its diversified func￾tions are attributed to its glycosylation and half-life which results in its high perme￾ability through the GIT. Resveratrol readily binds to the human serum albumin and 
various lipoproteins, a step necessary for its transport and cellular absorption. After 
absorption, it accumulates in tissues that are its target sites namely colorectal tissues, 
breast, and cardiac tissues (Berman et al, 2017). In the brain tissues, it acts as an 
antineoplastic agent by suppressing oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and inflammation.
In 2002, Wang et al proved that resveratrol crosses the BBB via the tight junc￾tions and mainly acts on the NF-κB in the neuronal cells. By inhibiting NF-κB, it 
significantly reduces the formation of MGMT protein and reduces TMZ degrada￾tion (Frémont, 2000). Tumour cells use autophagy to avoid apoptosis-mediated cell 
death by getting rid of toxic molecules in the neoplasm. Resveratrol has been shown 
to increase TMZ efficacy by reducing autophagy and inducing ROS and ERK￾mediated apoptosis. One of the most important events in apoptosis is mitochondria 
dysfunction. Figure 9.6 shows various modes of action via which resveratrol induces 
FIGURE 9.5 Structure of resveratrol.Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 171
apoptosis in cancer cells. Resveratrol treatment results in a loss in membrane poten￾tial of cancer cell mitochondria that subsequently leads to the rapid release of cyto￾chrome C from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm (Ginkel et al, 2007). This 
induces apoptosis mediated by caspases 3 and 9 (Maria et al, 2009). Inhibition of 
mTOR signalling, downregulation of Bcl2, and activation of p53-mediated apopto￾sis are some mechanisms by which resveratrol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction 
enhances TMZ activity (Goffart et al, 2013). uPAR (urokinase plasminogen activa￾tor receptor), a cell membrane lipid anchored protein, when associated with uPA, 
induces MMP-9 formation. MMP-9 is often associated with tissue remodelling, 
tumour cell adhesion, migration, and invasion which accounts for its overexpres￾sion in GBM. Resveratrol induces ECM degradation by NF-κB activation and uPA 
downregulation thus validating its anti-invasive properties (Ryu et al, 2015). When 
NF-κB gets inhibited, a cascade inhibition of Bcl-2, VEGF, and MMP-9 occurs. 
This downregulation can be traced back to resveratrol-mediated inhibition of TNF-α
which otherwise through NF- κB activation activates uPA and subsequent malignant 
glioma-promoting factors (Filippi-Chiela et al, 2013). Resveratrol also demonstrates 
p53-independent G2-M arrest thus inducing senescence in the cancer cell. It also acts 
on Wnt signalling and the JAK-STAT pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation 
of STAT-1 and STAT-3. In the later stages of cancer, that is, malignancy, it can also 
function as a cytotoxic agent due to inhibition of angiogenesis and by halting tumour 
invasion and metastasis.
Rapid metabolism and poor bioavailability when administered orally are the 
major hindrances in the development of resveratrol as a pharmaceutical formulation 
(Walle et al, 2004). At lower concentrations, it shows anti-oxidant behaviour, but at 
prolonged exposure to a high concentration of resveratrol, proteolytic cleavage and 
DNA damage are observed (Schilder et al, 2009). It also exhibits pro-oxidant effects 
like increased lipid peroxidation and inhibition of P450 cytochromes (Gadacha et al, 
2009). It can also interact with other drugs and either attenuate them or form toxic 
FIGURE 9.6 Mechanism of resveratrol in controlling oncogenic signalling.172 NeuroPhytomedicine
forms. Thus, one of the most important factors to consider while preparing a dose of 
resveratrol is its concentration. Also, much work needs to be done regarding improv￾ing the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol.
9.4.2 Quercetin
Quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxy-flavone) is a polyphenolic flavonoid and is pres￾ent in many foods like apples, cherries, onions, (refer Figure 9.7) citrus fruits, and 
many herbs. It exhibits lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation, capillary permeabil￾ity as well as anti-neoplastic and anti-bacterial activities. Quercetin glucoside, the 
naturally occurring form of quercetin, gets absorbed in ranges only from 3% to 17%. 
So, limited absorption, high metabolism, and excretion are the reasons for querce￾tin’s low bioavailability (Scholz and Williamson, 2007).
Hsp27, a heat shock protein is overexpressed in cancer and reduces the efficacy 
of the TMZ regime. Hsp27 is also associated with increased chemoresistance and 
suppression of apoptosis-mediated death of neoplastic cells (Acunzo et al, 2012). 
Phosphorylation of Hsp by many protein kinases and MAPKs activates quercetin has 
been reported to prevent the phosphorylation of Hsp27 which inhibited the SPARC￾induced glioma cell invasion (Sang et al, 2014). Quercetin elevates the intracellular 
levels of ROS and Ca2+ leading to the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane 
potential and subsequent release of cytochrome C. This induces apoptosis mediated 
by caspases 3 and 9 which support the TMZ regime (Kiekow et al, 2016). Release 
of the caspase proteins can also be attributed to another activity of quercetin, that is, 
a change in mitochondrial membrane protection which also leads to an increase in 
p53 as well as c-Jun kinases. It has also been reported that pre-exposure to quercetin 
increased the anti-proliferative activity of TMZ. Thus, the quercetin-TMZ treatment 
regime has been shown to increase the overall efficacy of the treatment of GBM.
Quercetin also arrests the cell cycle, inhibits cell proliferation, and induces apop￾tosis (refer Figure 9.8). Apart from its function as an adjunct in TMZ therapy, it has 
various other anti-cancer mechanisms. Yamashita and Kawanishi (2000), reported 
the DNA topoisomerase inhibitory activity of quercetin. It is also reported to block 
the NF-κB, Ras-MAPK-ERK, and PI3K-AKT signalling cascade thus inhibiting 
cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Santos et al, 2015). Quercetin is involved 
FIGURE 9.7 Structure of quercetin.Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 173
in the deregulation of angiogenic factors like VEGF through inhibition of the 
VEGFR2-regulated AKT/mTOR cascade. It also causes inhibition of MMP-2 and 
MMP-9 which helps in lowering matrix degradation and tumour cell metastasis. It 
also arrests the cell cycle by inhibiting CDK4 and cyclin D along with p53 activation.
But, low bioavailability, rapid degradation, and systemic elimination are some 
associated limitations. To overcome the problem of quercetin’s low bioavailabil￾ity, quercetin-derived nanoparticles are administered intravenously thus ensuring 
maximal concentration of quercetin reaching the BBB (Liu et al, 2022). Some other 
advantages of the nanoparticle mode of delivery are intrinsic tumour vessel target￾ing, high drug loading, and disruption of pro-angiogenic and angiogenic factors as 
well as the existing vasculature (Tee et al, 2019; Vafadar et al, 2020). This suggests 
a vessel-targeting approach as a result of improving the delivery of this bioactive 
polyphenol.
9.4.3 Curcumin
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), is a natural sesquiterpene present abundantly in the 
rhizome Curcuma longa, that is, (refer Figure 9.9) turmeric. Curcumin has anti￾inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, and astringent activities due to 
which turmeric has been in use for centuries as a therapeutic agent. Rather than 
using turmeric as a powder, curcumin is isolated and used as an anti-cancer drug due 
to its ROS scavenging, anti-proliferative, and anti-invasive activity reported in breast 
cancer, lung metastases, and brain tumours (Bachmeier et al, 2010). It shows such 
diversified functions due to the presence of three reactive functional groups, namely 
two phenolic moieties and a 1,3-diketone moiety (Priyadarsini, 2013).
DNA alkylation and ROS generation are the two main mechanisms by which TMZ 
induces apoptosis in cancer cells. But the cancer cells remodel the electron transport 
system and enhance the activity of cytochrome c and complex I and II which leads 
FIGURE 9.8 Anti-cancer activity of quercetin in GBM.174 NeuroPhytomedicine
to a decrease in oxidative stress which reduces the efficacy of TMZ (Oliva et al, 
2011). But in many in-vivo experiments, when resveratrol was used synergistically 
with TMZ, it showed increased production of ROS and increased TMZ efficacy 
(Yin et al, 2014). Another hindrance in TMZ treatment is the overexpression of Akt 
(protein kinase B) which leads to Cdc25C/Cdc2 inactivation and decreased G2 arrest 
(Hirose et al, n.d.). Figure 9.10 explains the role of curcumin in inhibiting oncogenic 
signalling molecules. Curcumin inhibits PI3K, thus inhibiting Akt formation which 
makes cancer cells more prone to TMZ-mediated DNA and subsequent apoptosis 
(Maiti et al, 2019). Curcumin targets multiple pathways like MAPK, JAK-STAT, 
Wnt, and PI3K/Akt explains its anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and pro-apoptotic 
activity. Curcumin inhibits the overexpression of PTEN which inhibits the PI3K/Akt 
FIGURE 9.10 Role of curcumin in inhibiting oncogenic signalling in GBM.
FIGURE 9.9 Structure of curcumin.Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 175
pathway leading inhibition of Akt and mTOR (Maiti et al, 2019). This leads to the 
downregulation of Bcl2 causing apoptotic cell death. Curcumin is also reported to 
reduce cancer cell proliferation and survival via inhibition of NF-κB as it is associ￾ated with overexpression of EGFR and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (Dhandapani et al, 
2007). Thus, inhibition of NF-κB potentiates the anti-tumour effects in drugs like 
paclitaxel (Fratantonio et al, 2019). By inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway, curcumin 
inhibits tumour cell migration and invasion (Mao et al, 2012). It is also involved in 
the activation of caspase 3 and 9 mediated apoptotic cascades (Hande et al, 2013).
Water solubility and physicochemical stability limit the bioavailability of cur￾cumin. It has also been determined that curcumin can cross the BBB. Various deliv￾ery systems like nanoparticles and liposomes are being experimented upon for more 
efficient delivery of curcumin. Another problem associated with TMZ/curcumin 
regime is that it induces autophagy. The use of resveratrol helps reduce autophagy 
and increases the efficacy of TMZ (Ryskalin et al, 2020). At higher concentrations, 
curcumin exhibits cytotoxicity leading to the death of the cell. So, monitoring the 
levels of curcumin is also of utmost importance.
9.4.4 Boswellic Acids
Boswell acids 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), is extracted from the 
resin of Boswellia serrata and some other species of the Boswellia genus. Many 
boswellic acid derivates are currently in use. Boswellic acid is a very potent anti￾inflammatory molecule that binds to COX-2 and (refer Figure 9.11) inhibits pros￾taglandin synthesis. It also possesses analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory 
activities. In cancer, it is used as a cytotoxic and antitumour drug. It is also used for 
the treatment of tumour-associated oedema (Li et al, 2020). As discussed earlier, 
autophagy is one of the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade apoptosis.
Figure 9.12 discusses the various mechanisms by which AKBA inhibits autoph￾agy by increasing mTOR and decreasing p53 and ERK expression and regulating the 
ERK/mTOR and P53/mTOR cascades leading to apoptosis. AKBA also reduces the 
abnormal accumulation of glucose in cancerous cells (Warburg effect) thus inhibit￾ing the growth of tumour cells. It is also involved in the inhibition of p21 which 
leads to subsequent inhibition of Cdk1 which stops cell cycle progression. Cdk1 
inhibition is also involved in sensitizing the cell to DNA damage thus initiating 
the signal for apoptosis (Schneider and Weller, 2016). Other mechanisms by which 
AKBA induces apoptosis are through BAD and Akt inhibition which doesn’t allow 
Bcl2-BAX complex formation thereby inducing caspase 3 and 8 mediated apoptosis 
(Ravanan et al, 2011). Another mechanism is by blockage of p65, a nuclear protein 
that normally inhibits apoptosis (Janssen et al, 2000). Inhibition of topoisomerases 
I and II is another activity by which uncontrolled DNA replication is ceased by 
boswellic acid which also induces the signal for apoptosis (Ali et al, 2015). AKBA 
also induces p21 expression which recognizes DNA damage caused by TMZ and 
induces apoptosis independent of Bcl2 -BAX. NF-κB and Akt play an important role 
in downregulating TMZ-induced chemoresistance. Boswellic acid downregulates 
NF-κB and Akt (from Figure 9.12) thereby increasing the sensitivity of the cells to 
TMZ (Roy et al, 2017).176 NeuroPhytomedicine
One of the primary areas of concern is the bioavailability of AKBA which needs 
to be improved. According to the findings of Ritschel (1980), after oral administra￾tion, a stable plasma concentration of AKBA is achieved in thirty hours. This can be 
attributed to the high lipophilicity of boswellic acids (Krüger et al, 2008). Liposomes, 
emulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, micelles, and 
lactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles are all examples of nanoparticle delivery meth￾ods that can be used as targeted delivery options (Aqil et al, 2013; Roy et al, 2019).
9.4.5 Epigallocatechin Gallate
Catechins are phenolic compounds belonging to the flavan-3-ols family of flavonoids. 
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid, is the 
major catechin present in green tea, pomegranates, vinegar, berries, and peaches. 
It has shown anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antiproliferative 
effects. Paired with its anti-oxidant activities, EGCG’s metal chelation activity helps 
in preventing neurodegenerative diseases. It has also exhibited anti-tumorigenic 
activity and is used in combination with TMZ as a chemotherapeutic agent.
FIGURE 9.11 Structures of boswellic acid derivatives.Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 177
FIGURE 9.12 Mechanism of boswellic acids in inducing apoptosis in tumour cells.
FIGURE 9.13 Structure of epigallocatechin gallate.178 NeuroPhytomedicine
In cancer such as gliomas, BBB permeation is an important factor that determines 
a drug’s efficacy. EGCG is known to increase BBB permeation of TMZ by inhibiting 
P-gp expression (Zhang et al, 2015). EGCG inhibits PI3K and/or mTOR kinases and 
downregulates p-Akt, Bcl-2 promoting the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein 
Bax which induces apoptosis (Aller et al, 2011). Figure 9.14 depicts the mechanism 
by which EGCG induces apoptosis by inhibiting NADPH-reducing enzymes. This 
results in a reduction of the ROS scavenging capacity of the cell leading to cell death 
via phosphorylation of p38 and JNK (refer Figure 9.14) (Zhang et al, 2015).
EGCG also inhibits the signalling of PDGFR as well as that of various metal￾loproteinases, cytokines, and chemokines which inhibits cancer cell invasion of tis￾sues. In cancerous cells, high telomerase levels maintain telomere length. It was 
showed that the addition of EGCG significantly reduced the expression of telomerase 
mRNA in glioma cells. EGCG inhibits the phosphorylation of PDGFR in glioma 
cells by blocking PDFG from binding to its receptor which reduces cell proliferation 
(Weber et al, 2004). MMP-2 is a major protease involved in the invasive behaviour 
of cells. Inhibition of MMP-2 activation by EGCG leads to reduced invasiveness 
FIGURE 9.14 Effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on GBM metastasis.Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 179
of glioma cells (Mook et al, 2004). The stability and bioavailability of EGCG are 
important points of discussion. This is because it is prone to degradation in the body 
fluids via epimerization and auto-oxidation (Krupkova et al, 2016) Conditions like 
low temperature and pH of 2–5.5 maintain the stability of EGCG. However, due to a 
change in pH when it is administered orally, the oral bioavailability of EGCG is low. 
The bioavailability of EGCG is enhanced when administered along with piperine, 
that is, co-treatment. Studies based on other strategies like the use of pro-drugs, 
encapsulation, and chitosan-based nanocarriers have also demonstrated improve￾ment in EGCG’s pharmacokinetics.
9.5 EMERGING NANOTECHNOLOGY DELIVERY APPROACH 
FOR BIOACTIVE PHYTOPHARMACEUTICAL: A POTENTIAL 
THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY TO GBM
Till date, delivery of bioactive phytopharmaceuticals to brain is a challenging task for 
scientists. There are numerous barriers such as BBB, poor pharmacokinetic profile, 
highly hydrophilic compound, less selective that hinder the effective management of 
GBM. In case of GBM, due to the presence of BBB in brain, the phytopharmaceuti￾cals are unable to reach to tumour site and are restricted to specific targets to bind to 
the GBM stem cells. Due to this issue, the conventional approaches fail to attend 
the therapeutic efficacy against various diseases. Despite having a wide spectrum of 
anticancer actions, bioactives like quercetin have poor water solubility, low bioavail￾ability, prone to oxidative degradation, and severe biotransformation, which makes 
it difficult to use in vivo. Nano formulations have exhibited significant advances 
in the delivery of such non-polar molecules. These include high encapsulation effi￾ciency, longer circulation time, tumour-specific biodistribution, controlled release, 
and increased therapeutic efficacy. As a result, various modified nanoparticles have 
been developed which are considered as major breakthroughs in quercetin delivery 
for anticancer therapy. Liposomes, polymeric micelles, PLGA nanoparticles, metal￾organic frameworks, inorganic nanoparticles, biomacromolecule-based nanoparti￾cles, and other nanoparticles have been produced since then to deliver quercetin and 
boost its antitumour action (Zang et al, 2021). Curcumin’s efficiency is hampered by 
its limited absorption, despite its potential anticancer actions. Several study groups 
have detected very low plasma and extra-intestinal levels of curcumin. Hence, to 
maximize its solubility and absorption, it is integrated into formulations such as 
solid dispersion, nanoparticles, micelles, conjugates, and liposomes. The efficacy 
of nanoformulations for GBM was demonstrated by one study group which used 
curcumin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-1,2-distearoyl-glycerol-3-phospho￾ethanolamine-N-[methoxy (polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium salt (PLGA￾DSPE-PEG) hybrid nanoparticles in rats. It reported a significantly lower size of the 
tumour after five days of injection when compared with the nontreated control group 
(Orunoğlu et al, 2017). Another study found that curcumin-laden targeted liposomes 
crossed the BBB twice as much as non-targeted liposomes loaded with curcumin 
(Gabay et al, 2021). Some of the obstacles to effective GBM treatment are not depen￾dent on the type of tested therapy. Indeed, they are due to: (i) A lack of preclinical 180 NeuroPhytomedicine
models that are close enough to human GBM, (ii) the difficulty in conducting clini￾cal trials on a large enough number of patients to achieve statistical significance of 
the clinical data, (iii) the design of clinical trials that plan to treat GBM patients at 
a too advanced stage of the disease, and (iv) the detection of GBM disease at a too 
late stage.
9.6 REGULATORY ASPECT OF PHYTOPHARMACEUTICALS
People from numerous countries have a long history of utilizing plants and their 
components in traditional medicine and healing rituals. Among them are India, 
Africa, Native American nations, Mediterranean nations, China, and Greece. But 
only a few medicinal herbs have been clinically tested for their potential as a med￾ical treatment, despite the widespread popularity of herbal medicines (Tagde et al, 
2021). In the majority of nations, herbal medications are poorly regulated and are 
frequently neither registered nor regulated by the health authorities. The Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that botanical and other dietary sup￾plements cause over 50,000 adverse events in the United States. On October 24, 
2013, the Indian government published a proposed amendment to the Drugs and 
Cosmetics Act and Rules. Rule 2 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 states 
that a “Phytopharmaceutical Drug” is any fraction that has been purified and 
standardized and has a minimum of four bioactive or phytochemical ingredients. 
The newly added Appendix I B to Schedule Y outlines the information that must 
be given with a request to conduct a clinical study, import, or manufacture a 
phytopharmaceutical drug in the nation. The regulatory requirements for a new 
medicine’s safety and pharmacological information, human research, and confir￾matory clinical trials are included in the NDA for the phytopharmaceutical drug. 
These are:
1. The plant utilized for extraction and fractionation must be properly authen￾ticated, sourced and identified.
2. Extraction procedure followed by fractionation and purification.
3. Information on the manufacturing method for phytopharmaceutical drugs.
4. Data on stability.
Moreover, the applicant is required to send an adequate quantity of phytopharma￾ceutical, and phytopharmaceutical formulations/products along with adequate quan￾tities of all the identified bioactive/phytochemical compounds to the laboratories 
when demanded by the CDSCO for testing.
9.7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTIVES
In recent years, GBM is the common life-threatening tumour associated with the 
CNS. Primarily, the elderly population are mostly affected due to this disease as it is 
extremely fatal and still poorly treated. There are many intrinsic problems and side 
effects exhibited with these existing therapy, and surgical maximal safe resection 
is the primary most effective and safe option. Besides, issues like poor solubility, Role of Phytopharmaceuticals 181
low stability, limited bioavailability, chemo-resistance, and toxicity have led to 
hindrances in developing a chemotherapeutic regime for GBM patients. Bioactive 
molecules obtained from natural sources like seeds, vegetables, fruits, etc., have 
numerous therapeutic potentials such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antican￾cer properties that may help cancer survivors feel better throughout chemotherapy 
or other existing approaches to treatment. However, their isolation and purification 
were the most crucial challenges for the clinical translation against various dis￾eases. Therefore, much of the energy and resources must be used in efficient isola￾tion which is costly due to limited reserves of these bioactive. Thus, the researcher 
acquired their attention towards the plant tissue culture for maximizing the produc￾tion of these bioactive. Another important aspect is elucidating the direct target and 
mechanism of action of any natural product. Chemo proteomics can be used for 
determining the activity-based protein profiling of lead molecules by making them 
react with the pre-determined biological targets. In silico techniques like protein 
docking, target prediction, and ligand screening are important tools of bioinformat￾ics that help in a systemic analysis though the results are not 100% accurate. For the 
increasing quality of life of GBM patients, nanocarrier-based formulations can be 
explored for increasing the biodistribution and bioavailability which can help clear 
malignant glioma cells with minimal side effects. Applications of nanoparticles in 
tumours are still being studied for reproducibility, stability, and scale production. 
Optimizing nanomedicine’s physical properties (size, zeta potential, surface chem￾istry, and shape) and compositions (ligand modification and combination with other 
therapeutic agents) to improve tumor-specific accumulation and antitumour activi￾ties while minimizing side effects remains a challenge.

Eugenol as 
Neuro-Phytomedicine
Recent Trends Pertaining 
to the Treatment of 
Neurological Disorders
Bhagawati Saxena
10.1 INTRODUCTION
Neurological disorders are medically described as conditions that impact the brain, 
spinal cord, and body’s nerves. The most frequent neurological conditions include 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), brain and spinal cord injury, 
epilepsy, migraines, multiple sclerosis, stroke, etc. Recently, there has been an 
upsurge in the frequency of neurological disorders. Treatment of various neurologi￾cal illnesses presents a myriad of challenges, one of which is the delivery of drugs to 
the brain (Bhavsar et al, 2022). According to reports, phytochemicals derived from 
medicinal plants have therapeutic and pharmacological effects that were neuropro￾tective, making them possible treatments for neurological illnesses. The blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), which encircles and protects the brain, hinders a significant number 
of drugs from entering the brain. Eugenol is a widely used researched molecule. 
Eugenol appears to pass through the BBB and act in situ when consumed orally 
due to its hydrophobic characteristic. Eugenol demonstrates a variety of biological 
effects while having a rather simplistic chemical composition. It is renowned for its 
anti-microbial (Marchese et al, 2017), antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties 
(Barboza et al, 2018). According to earlier experimental findings, eugenol has been 
proven to be protective against the neurotoxicity caused by chlorpyrifos (Singh and 
Panwar, 2014), aluminium (Mesole et al, 2020; Said and Rabo, 2017), acrylamide 
(Prasad and Muralidhara 2013), 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (Kabuto et al, 2007; 
Kabuto and Yamanushi, 2011) and scopolamine (Garabadu and Sharma, 2019). 
Eugenol can be utilised to treat several neurological or neurodegenerative problems 
due to its chemical properties such as hydrophobicity as well as a wide range of 
pharmacological features, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory activities, etc. 
Eugenol continues to be of great interest to researchers because of its multidirectional 
impact, which makes it a practical component in therapies with therapeutic potential 
against many brain disorders. The present level of knowledge on the neuroprotective 
properties and uses of eugenol and its derivatives in neurological disorders such as 
10188 NeuroPhytomedicine
depression, AD, Parkinson’s diseases, stress and stress-related disorders, stroke, and 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) are emphasised in this chapter in the following sections.
10.2 EUGENOL AND ITS PROPERTIES
Eugenol (C10H12O2) is chemically 4-allyl-2-methoxy phenol. It is an aromatic pheno￾lic compound. It is frequently used as a scent in fragrances and soaps. Eugenol has an 
oily viscosity, a clear to light yellow colour, and a pungent scent. Inorganic solvents 
are the best solubilisers of eugenol, while it is sparingly soluble in water. Eugenol 
is unstable chemically and vulnerable to oxidation and other chemical reactions. It is 
quickly absorbed by several organs when taken orally and metabolised by the liver. 
Common sources of it are plants from the Lauraceae, Lamiaceae, Myristicaceae, 
and Myrtaceae families’ natural essential oils. It is reported to occur in a variety 
of concentrations depending on the species (Table 10.1). However, eugenol is the 
primary ingredient in the clove oil extract, that is, 70%–90% (Eugenia caryophyl￾lata, Syzygium aromaticum). Cloves, in addition to being a common spice used to 
flavour foods and drinks, can also be applied locally to alleviate toothaches. It is 
also taken orally, however less frequently to treat digestive and respiratory issues. 
Cinnamon, nutmeg, and other aromatic spices also contain eugenol, albeit in smaller 
amounts (Charan Raja, 2015; Khalil et al, 2017). Since eugenol is a key component 
of the three spices like clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., it is commonly regarded as 
safe and employed as a natural food flavouring and preservative by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) (Burt, 2004; National Toxicology Program, 1983). 
Eugenol’s antimicrobial (Hu et al, 2018; Marchese et al, 2017) properties have led 
to its usage as a pesticide. Eugenol has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against

dental analgesic. It is used as an analgesic and an antimicrobial in a variety of root 
canal filling products (Diaz and Sembrano, 1985; Pramod et al, 2016).
10.3 NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS AND MECHANISMS OF 
EUGENOL IN VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
10.3.1 Depression
The exceedingly high frequency of depression in the community qualifies it as one of 
the most significant neurological illnesses. Moreover, depression frequently coexists 
with neurodegenerative illnesses such as PD and AD (Chung et al, 2003; Lyketsos 
and Lee, 2004). Depression is a mood condition that affects many people and fre￾quently results in major psychosocial issues including suicide (Wong and Licinio, 
2001). The “monoamine theory” has been the most significant of the pathogenic 
explanations for depression. Monoamine levels (serotonin, dopamine (DA), and 
noradrenaline) in post-synaptic areas are markedly diminished in individuals with 
depression for a plethora of reasons. Symptoms associated with depression should 
improve if these monoamines are restored. The current line of medications for the 
treatment of depression includes inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO), serotonin 
noradrenaline receptor inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin receptor inhibi￾tors (SSRIs). However, chronic and recurrent depression is still prevalent despite 
the introduction of these medicines (Gelenberg et al, 2003). This raises the need 
of developing a new therapy for depression. The anti-depressive effects of eugenol 
on rats were assessed in the earlier study. Results show that oral administration of 
eugenol to animals reduced the depression comparable to imipramine administra￾tion (Irie et al, 2004).
In patients suffering from depression, the hippocampus area is relatively smaller 
(Bremner et al, 2000; Brosch et al, 2022). This decrease in the hippocampal region 
is recovered as the patients receive antidepressant therapy and their clinical con￾dition improves (Malberg et al, 2000). One of the neuronal growth factors in the 
brain that is crucial for the process of neurogenesis is called brain-derived neuro￾trophic factor (BDNF). Previous animal research shows that BDNF supplementation 
can alleviate depression associated with BDNF deficiency (Shirayama et al, 2002). 
Additionally, recent research showed that the neurogenic benefits of antidepressants 
were eliminated when this neurogenesis was disrupted by X-ray irradiation in the 
brain (Santarelli et al, 2003). Thus, it is determined that regenerated neurons are 
responsible for an antidepressant’s therapeutic benefit (Malberg et al, 2000). The 
elevation of BDNF expression in the hippocampus promotes the antidepressant￾induced regeneration of neurons (Björkholm and Monteggia, 2016; Shirayama et al, 
2002). It was discovered that eugenol elevated BDNF expression in the hippocampus 
as with imipramine (Irie et al, 2004). Eugenol also promotes hippocampus neuro￾genesis, which is seen with other antidepressants (Akbar et al, 2021; Irie, 2006).
In contrast to treatment with imipramine, eugenol enhances the expression of 
the metallothionein-III (MT-III) gene in the hippocampus (Irie et al, 2004). MT-III 
is a member of the MT family that is particular to the brain and shields cells and 190 NeuroPhytomedicine
organs from numerous harmful events. It is thought that MT-III functions in the 
brain to promote neurogenesis and neuroprotection (Irie and Keung, 2001; Tanji 
et al, 2003). These results imply that eugenol’s ability to induce neurogenesis may 
be mediated through MT-III expression. Certain study shows that eugenol and its 
analogues inhibit MAO, preferentially MAO-A (Tao et al, 2005); however, another 
study reported that eugenol neither inhibits MAO-A nor inhibits MAO-B (Kong 
et al, 2004). This difference in observation may be owing to various experimental 
circumstances.
10.3.2 Alzheimer’s Disease
AD is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to the atrophy of cholinergic 
neurons mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus region. The most prevalent 
type of dementia is AD. The prevalence of AD is rising globally as the proportion of 
elderly people increases worldwide (Citron, 2002). The majority of AD cases occur 
sporadically, that is, without genetic origins, however, some familial cases of AD 
have been well-described, that is, genetic anomalies in the genes (PS1, PS2, APP, 
etc.) (Selkoe and Schenk, 2003). Pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial. The two hall￾marks of AD’s pathogenesis include interneuronal accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) 
plaques and intra-neuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Studies 
have demonstrated that Aβ plaques result in the death of neuronal cells through sev￾eral mechanisms (Choi et al, 2019; Gschwind and Huber, 1995; Orellana et al, 2011). 
Aβ plaque and NFT exert their neurotoxicity through a range of mechanisms. First, 
the reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as a consequence of Aβ plaque 
deposition. Generated ROS results in direct damage to cell membranes and DNA 
to cause atrophy of neurons (Behl et al, 1994; Cheignon et al, 2018; Wang et al, 
2010). Second, NFT and Aβ plaque have been linked to promoting excitotoxicity by 
allowing an excessive influx of calcium ions via NMDA receptor into the neuronal 
cells (Pallo et al, 2016). Insoluble deposits of Aβ plaques between neurons result 
in the activation of microglia, an innate immune cell within the brain. Activated 
microglia have two distinct tasks in the pathogenesis of AD. Through phagocytic 
action, it initially provides neuroprotective effects by eliminating Aβ deposits, but 
with time, it releases cytotoxic chemicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines, caus￾ing gradual neurodegeneration (Mandrekar-Colucci and Landreth, 2010). Although 
microglia express all toll-like receptor (TLR) subtypes, TLR2 and TLR4 are par￾ticularly abundant (Fiebich et al, 2018). TLR4 is crucial in the identification of the 
Aβ plaques by microglia, which is believed to be a part of inflammatory reactions 
in AD pathogenesis (Papageorgiou et al, 2016). In AD, TLR4 is crucial for the ini￾tiation of neuroinflammation which in turn results in neurodegeneration (Chavali 
et al, 2020; Saxena and Chavali, 2019; Walter et al, 2007).
Memantine, an NMDA inhibitor of the glutamate receptor, three different cho￾linesterase blockers (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine), and most recently 
Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody, were the only medications that the US-FDA 
approved for treating AD patients (Chauhan et al, 2022; Long and Holtzman, 2019; 
Yang and Sun, 2021). Thus, excitotoxicity via glutamate acting on NMDA, as well as 
cholinesterase, is found promising target for the new molecule.Eugenol as Neuro-Phytomedicine 191
Eugenol is well known for its antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory activity. 
Eugenol can directly neutralise hydroxyl free radicals and lessen oxidative stress 
(Taira et al, 1992). Additionally, it was revealed that eugenol’s free radicals scaveng￾ing activity (antioxidative effect) is linked to its capacity as a metal transition (Ito 
et al, 2005). It is suggested that eugenol prevents lipid peroxidation caused by lipoxy￾genase (Naidu, 1995). Additionally, earlier reports show that eugenol has inhibi￾tory activity on calcium ion channels (Chung et al, 2008; Seo et al, 2013). Eugenol 
prevents excitotoxicity induced by NMDA in cultured neuronal cells by inhibiting 
Ca2+ absorption (Wie et al, 1997). It has also been proven that NMDA receptors 
mediate the neurotoxic effects of Aβ deposits (Parks et al, 2001). Hence, it stands to 
reason that eugenol might counteract the harmful action of Aβ, which is mediated 
through the NMDA receptor. TLR4 is a key player in the innate immune responses in 
neurodegenerative diseases like AD, PD, etc. We docked eugenol against the human 
myeloid differentiation factor-2 (hMD2) co-receptor of TLR4 to better comprehend 
the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect. Eugenol has a −6.897 kcal/
mol binding affinity towards the hMD2 active site (Vora et al, 2022). Eugenol dra￾matically decreased the gene expression of TLR4 indicators, according to a prior 
study (Choudhury et al, 2014). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the natural agonist of 
TLR4, and eugenol inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators generated 
by LPS in human macrophages (Lee et al, 2007). Thus, eugenol’s antagonistic action 
at TLR4 might be partially responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects. Further 
research is necessary to corroborate this conclusion. Thus, eugenol is supposed to be 
effective against AD by simultaneously acting on multiple pathways.
Eugenol inhibits the aggregation of amyloid protein (Dubey et al, 2017). Eugenol 
administration prevented the loss in memory and learning performance against insu￾lin and Aβ-induced AD rat models (Taheri et al, 2019). In vitro study shows that 
eugenol has antioxidant activities as well as inhibits MAO, butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and activities dose-dependently (Adefegha 
et al, 2021). Eugenol was also found to alleviate the impairment in the learning￾memory ability and augmented oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rats with AD 
(Liu et al, 2013). The report shows that eugenol enhanced learning and memory in 
the mouse by augmenting neurogenesis as well as dendritic complexity of neurons 
in the dentate gyrus (DG) and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) basal regions of the mouse 
brain (Akbar et al, 2021). Additionally, eugenol reduced the memory loss brought 
on by scopolamine. Eugenol also lessened the effects of scopolamine on the rat’s 
hippocampus cholinergic and mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate neurotoxic￾ity (Garabadu and Sharma, 2019). Aluminium administration results in dementia, 
hastening Aβ plaque formation and accumulation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative 
stress in the rat’s brain (Chavali et al, 2020; Saxena and Chavali, 2019). It was dis￾covered that eugenol protected against aluminium-induced neurotoxicity (Said and 
Rabo, 2017; Mesole et al, 2020). Thus, these pieces of literature show that eugenol 
is found effective for treating AD via acting through multiple pathways which are 
shown in Figure 10.1.
Eugenol analogue, that is, acetoxy eugenol acetate has shown neuroprotective 
activity against cognitive impairment in mice caused by Aβ (Jayasingh Chellammal 
et al, 2019). Eugenol-rich grass leaf sweet flag rhizome shields PC-12 cells against 192 NeuroPhytomedicine
FIGURE 10.1 Neuroprotective mechanisms of eugenol in Alzheimer’s disease. Proteolysis 
of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane glycoprotein occurs by two pathways, 
that is, non-amyloidogenic pathway and amyloidogenic pathway. In the non-amyloidogenic 
pathway, APP is first cleaved by alpha-secretase and then by gamma-secretase and thus 
leads to the generation of soluble fragments sAPPα. On the other hand, in the amyloido￾genic pathway, neurotoxic Aβ formed through cleavage of APP by beta-secretase followed 
by gamma-secretase and formed sAPPβ and then Aβ oligomers. Deposition of Aβ plaque 
leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins and ultimately leads to the formation of NFTs. 
Formation and deposition of Aβ plaque and NFTs results in ROS generation, excessive influx 
of calcium ion by activation of NMDA receptors, and activation of neuroinflammatory recep￾tors like toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which further play role in neurotoxicity and cause neu￾ronal death of cholinergic nerve fibres. In scopolamine-induced amnesia, there is an increase 
in AchE activity which decreases the level of acetylcholine. Neurodegeneration or decreased 
activity of cholinergic system leads to memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease. 
Eugenol inhibits the formation of ROS, NMDA receptor as well as TLR4. It also blocks the 
influx of calcium ions and thus inhibits excitotoxicity. It also inhibits AchE activity and thus 
increases the concentration of Ach within the synapse. Thus, eugenol exerts its neuroprotec￾tion against Alzheimer’s disease by acting on multiple pathways.Eugenol as Neuro-Phytomedicine 193
the Aβ peptide’s harmful effects (Liang et al, 2015). Moreover, eugenol containing 
Syzygium aromaticum was found to be protective against Aβ25-35-induced neuro￾toxicity in neuronal cells (Shekhar et al, 2018). Certain analogues of eugenol, that 
is, asaronic acid, o-eugenol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylamine, ethyl 4-hydroxy￾3-methyoxycinnamate, ethyl homovanillate, and 2-methoxy5-nitrophenol greatly 
shielded PC-12 cells from the harmful effect of Aβ 1–40 (2.5 mM) (Irie, 2006).
10.3.3 Parkinson’s Disease
After AD, PD is the second most typical neurodegenerative condition. PD is caused 
by the depletion of DA in the nigrostriatal pathway due to the gradual degeneration 
of neurons (dopaminergic) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Bergman 
and Deuschl, 2002). Characteristic features of PD include impairment of the motor 
and nonmotor (limbic and cognitive) functions. DA deficiency in the SNpc results 
in motor symptoms that include resting tremors, stiff joints, akinesia/bradykinesia, 
etc (Jankovic, 2008)). The majority of the time, nevertheless, there are no apparent 
genetic backgrounds; however, rarely, PD develops as a hereditary condition brought 
on by a gene defect (Bergman and Deuschl, 2002). Treatment for PD has advanced 
significantly. Many prospective treatments for PD are developing as a consequence 
of advancements in experimental medicines (Ellis and Fell, 2017). The most efficient 
drug for treating the signs and symptoms of PD is currently levodopa, but it is also 
linked to serious side effects such as the “wearing off” effect including dyskinesias 
and other motor problems (Bargiotas and Konitsiotis, 2013). Alternative treatments 
for PD include DA agonists, nondopaminergic therapy, and catechol-o-methyl￾transferase inhibitors. These treatments can be taken in conjunction with levodopa 
or alone (Jankovic and Aguilar, 2008).
6-OHDA and 1-methly-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) are widely 
used classic toxins that induce PD in animals (Schober, 2004). Eugenol was proven 
to be effective in the 6-OHDA-induced rat model of PD (Moreira Vasconcelos et al, 
2020). Further research suggests that eugenol inhibits 6-OHDA-induced DA deple￾tion in the striatum both directly by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and indirectly 
through the activation of glutathione (GSH) and L-ascorbate-producing systems. 
Additionally, additional GSH by conjugating with the p-quinone created during 
6-OHDA auto-oxidation could prevent cell death (Kabuto et al, 2007). According to 
a report, eugenol pre-treatment inhibits 6-OHDA-induced DA reduction by halting 
lipid peroxidation. On the contrary, eugenol post-treatment enhanced the DA decline 
caused by 6-OHDA. According to the study, eugenol pre-treatment reduces lipid 
peroxidation, which in turn prevents 6-OHDA’s ability to cause DA depletion in the 
striatum. Eugenol post-treatment, however, further enhanced the DA decline. Thus, 
depending on when it was administered concerning when the model PD started, 
eugenol showed negative consequences (Kabuto and Yamanushi, 2011).
The synthetic neurotoxin MPTP has shown to cause PD-like symptoms in mice, 
including dyskinesia (Mustapha and Taib, 2021; Schober, 2004). MPTP, that is, less 
toxic is converted to MPP+ (highly toxic) in the mitochondria of the brain by MAO, 
particularly MAO-B. MPP+ inhibits the function of mitochondrial complex I, which 
causes the production of ROS (Mustapha and Taib, 2021). These facts suggest that 194 NeuroPhytomedicine
MAO-B inhibitors are currently used in therapeutic settings. In the MPTP-induced 
PD mouse model, our research demonstrates that pre-treatment with eugenol has 
positive effects on behavioural and pathological development. The protective effect 
of eugenol against the MPTP-induced PD model is because of its antioxidant effect. 
However, post-treatment with eugenol further deteriorates the MPTP-induced altera￾tion in behaviour and pathological progression (Vora et al, 2022).
10.3.4 Stress and Stress-Related Disorders
The level of stress that people sense nowadays appears to have significantly increased. 
Stress leads to numerous other conditions or disorders, including anxiety, depres￾sion, cognitive impairment, diabetes, immunosuppression, irritable bowel syndrome, 
ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcer, hypertension, and male impotence. Stress is described 
as the body’s non-specific reaction to demands placed on it, which are typically 
unpleasant (Selye, 1936). The body responds to stress through the process of adaption 
(also known as allostasis) by maintaining physiological processes within a predeter￾mined range. However, excessive stress or ineffective allostasis control results in an 
allostatic load, which can cause diseases and must thus be managed (McEwen, 2000). 
The sympathoadrenal system (SAS), brain monoaminergic systems (BMS), and hypo￾thalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) all have a role in the physiological and psychologi￾cal reactions to stress. In response to stress, the ulcer index, plasma corticosterone, 
and norepinephrine (NE) levels were elevated. Increased plasma corticosterone and 
NE are a marker of the stimulated HPA axis and the SAS, respectively. The earlier 
report shows that eugenol exerts an anti-stress effect against restraint-induced stress 
(Sen et al, 1992). Another study shows that the seven-day pre-treatment with eugenol 
showed a selective impact on the HPA axis and thus, reduced the ulcer scoring and 
increased corticosterone level in plasma induced by stress but did not influence the 
stress-induced altered levels of NE in plasma (Garabadu et al, 2011). Additionally, 
eugenol restored the stress-related alterations in 5-HT levels in the various region of 
the brain while NE levels were reversed in the various region of the brain except for 
the hippocampus. Results further demonstrated that eugenol has strong anti-stress 
activity in the four-hour restraint stress paradigm and that the impact is a conse￾quence of HPA and BMS regulation. Eugenol-rich bark of Cassia zelynicum (cin￾namon) (Saxena and Saxena, 2012) and buds of eugenia caryophyllus (clove) (Singh 
et al, 2009) were also found to be effective as an anti-stress agent.
People today experience inescapable chronic stress due to the difficult and 
extremely demanding life rhythm. Numerous major health issues, such as anxi￾ety, depression, gastrointestinal dysfunctions consequently irritable bowel syn￾drome, dysregulations of the neuroendocrine system, etc., are linked to chronic 
stress. Studies also show that eugenol is also effective against stress-induced disor￾ders. Study shows that eugenol reduces anxiety brought on by stress in rodents by 
inhibiting the expression of glyoxalase 1 (Siyal et al, 2021) and downregulation of 
neurokinin-1 receptors (Siyal et al, 2020). The manifestation of emotional behaviours, 
such as pathologic anxiety disorders, is critically influenced by the central amygdala 
(CeA). CeA-specific infusion or intraperitoneal injection of methyl eugenol, a deriva￾tive of eugenol decreased anxiety-like behaviours in mice. This is most likely a result Eugenol as Neuro-Phytomedicine 195
of the methylleugenol’s ability to activate A-type GABA receptors (GABAARs). 
Stimulation of GABAARs increases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhib￾itory influence in the CeA, which lowers anxiety (Liu et al, 2019). Eugenol also 
showed a protective effect against gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by constraint 
stress. The results of this investigation suggest that eugenol may be used to treat 
irritable bowel syndrome (Garabadu et al, 2015). Chronic stress-related hormonal 
variations or irregularities and associated psychological and physical effects, includ￾ing reproductive dysfunction, are more common in women. Stress activates the HPA 
axis, elevating blood cortisol levels, which attenuates the release of anti-Mullerian 
and oestradiol hormones from the ovary while augmenting anterior pituitary syn￾thesis of luteinising and follicle-stimulating hormones. Stress also results in insulin 
resistance, oxidative stress and consequently molecular damage in the ovaries. These 
alterations cumulatively result in fertility issues (Bethea et al, 2008). Another study 
shows the preventive effects of eugenol against stress-induced infertility in female 
rats (Helmy et al, 2022). It’s interesting to note that the injection of eugenol dramati￾cally reduced all of these negative consequences by modifying animal behaviour, 
ovarian damage, corticosterone upsurge hormonal abnormalities and thus, ulti￾mately reproductive disturbances.
10.3.5 Eugenol for the Treatment of Stroke
Stroke is one of the most dangerous illnesses endangering people’s health and life. A 
stroke occurs when the blood flow to a certain area of the brain is interrupted. This 
may result in permanent brain damage, chronic disability, or even death. Ischemic 
stroke and haemorrhagic stroke are the two forms of stroke. Ischemic stroke hap￾pens when blood arteries get blocked, cutting off the brain’s blood supply whereas 
eruption of the blood vessels, results in haemorrhagic stroke, resulting in an influx 
of blood into the brain cavity. Up to 60%–80% of all strokes are ischemic, making 
them more prevalent (Chugh, 2019). Stroke is the most frequent long-term disability, 
the second-leading cause of death, and dementia in those over sixty (Chamorro et al, 
2016). The financial burden of stroke is rising globally due to an ageing population 
(Feigin et al, 2016; Forouzanfar et al, 2015). Recombinant tissue plasminogen activa￾tor (rt-PA) is the only thrombolytic FDA-approved to date for the treatment of stroke 
(Lekoubou et al, 2017). rt-PA may not be used as widely as it might due to its short 
therapy windows and adverse effects. Research has indicated that eugenol may pro￾tect against brain ischemia damage (Ahmad et al, 2018; Won et al, 1998). Autophagy 
is a phenomenon which is induced as a result of ischemic stroke, its significance 
for stroke is yet debatable. Numerous studies indicate that autophagy triggered in 
response to ischemia acts as a double-edged sword that can have both advantageous 
and detrimental effects on brain neurons (Shi et al, 2021; Wang et al, 2018). However, 
certain studies show that autophagy prevents neuronal damage caused by cerebral 
ischemia followed by reperfusion. The molecules having the capacity to induce 
autophagy are found to prevent cerebral ischemia (Wang et al, 2018; Yao et al, 2019). 
The study by Sun and the team shows that by enhancing autophagy, eugenol reduces 
the effects of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (Sun et al, 2020). Moreover, it has 
been shown that the analogous of eugenol, that is, methyleugenol can reduce brain 196 NeuroPhytomedicine
ischemia damage by preventing oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and conse￾quently apoptotic neuronal death (Choi et al, 2010).
10.3.6 Traumatic Brain Injury
TBI can be described as the disruption of the brain’s physiological and regular activ￾ities as a result of an external mechanical impact (Khellaf et al, 2019). TBI is one of 
the leading causes of disability and death, globally (Najem et al, 2018). Pathogenesis 
of TBI consists of two phases: primary injury and subsequent secondary injury. A 
direct mechanical impact to the head causes primary injuries such as cortical con￾tusions, axonal shearing hematomas at epidural or subdural regions and microvas￾cular injuries (Najem et al, 2018). An initial blow results in a delayed, long-lasting 
secondary injury that lasts for hours to months to years. Mechanisms involved in 
secondary injuries include excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflam￾mation, oxidative stress, axon deterioration, and consequently neuronal death (Ng 
and Lee, 2019). TBI also causes cerebral oedema as a result of the obstruction of 
the outflow. This in turn results in rise in a intracranial pressure (ICP), which ulti￾mately leads to herniation, a primary cause of death. To prevent the swollen brain 
from being compressed, a section of the cranium is removed in the decompressive 
craniectomy (DC) (Bor-Seng-Shu et al, 2013). However, literature reported that DC 
lowers mortality, but it also leads to brain damage (Cole et al, 2011; Lad et al, 2019) 
and turns fatalities into survivors with significant disabilities (Honeybul, 2017). Our 
results show that pre-treatment with eugenol in rats ameliorated TBI-induced func￾tional disabilities (motor coordination, locomotor activity, and short-term memory). 
Additionally, eugenol pre-treatment reduced trauma-induced enhanced neuronal 
cell death, lipid peroxidation, oedema, and impaired BBB integrity (Barot and 
Saxena, 2021).
10.4 CONCLUSION
Numerous spices and therapeutic plants contain eugenol. It is frequently used as a 
food flavouring and preservation as well as a dental analgesic. Eugenol, a very simple 
chemical, has been established to have a wide array of neuroprotective properties. 
Recent research indicates that eugenol may potentially have neurogenerative proper￾ties. Eugenol has a variety of effects that cannot be attributed to just one or two of 
its functions. The potential therapeutic effects of eugenol are likely the result of at 
least many multiple processes. Eugenol can now be used to treat various neurological 
illnesses and diseases, including AD, depression, PD, and other conditions. Future 
developments in more potent analogues might be promised.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Recent decades have witnessed tremendous breakthroughs and research advance￾ments in the medical field that are changing the way numerous chronic diseases are 
being treated. With an increasing amount of therapeutics being developed in the cur￾rent pharmaceutical marketplace, several instances of drug toxicity, poor tolerability, 
curability, and high healthcare costs are increasing. Dementia-related neurodegen￾erative disorders (NDD) and neurotoxicity notably cause chronic disorder states 
worldwide (Hajat and Stein, 2018; Shin, 2022). Dementia-related NDD ranks as the 
seventh leading mortality cause, affecting nearly 55.2 million individuals worldwide 
(Ponjoan et al, 2019).
The primary constituents of natural products, terpenes, flavonoids, and 
carotenoids (CT), are often extracted from several plants, including Aloe bar￾badensis (Asphodelaceae), Berberis vulgaris (Berberidaceae), Curcuma longa
(Zingiberaceae), and Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae), and are often distinguished 
for their structural similarity (Veeresham, 2012). Throughout the decades of phy￾tochemical research, plant-derived extracts have undergone extensive preclinical 
experimentation to determine their pharmacological impact, bioactive phytochemi￾cals, medicinal values, and therapeutic targets (Dzobo, 2022). The principal plant 
components, polyphenols (anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolic acid, stilbenes, lig￾nans), vitamins (C, E), CT (carotenes, xanthophylls) exhibit a broad range of biologi￾cal effects such as robust antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-platelet, anti-fibrotic, and 
anti-inflammatory bioactivities (Manach et al, 2004).
Since the emergence of elevated drug adversity, poor tolerability, and clinical 
drug trial failure of conventional drug therapies have affected patients worldwide, 
the clinical application of plant-derived compounds, therapeutics, and experimen￾tal drugs for multiple disease associations to signaling pathways, and correlation 
11206 NeuroPhytomedicine
with other conditions, has been surging (Cragg and Newman, 2013). More recently, 
several research institutions have been displaying interest in plant extracts due to 
advancements in natural product screening techniques, including liquid chroma￾tography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS), LC/ultraviolet spectroscopy, LC/nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatograpy–MS/
MS, high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry, and photo-diode arrays, 
providing ample structural configurations, elucidation for lead compound identifica￾tion (Hostettmann et al, 2001)
Drug discovery strategies include phenotypic- and target-based computer-aided 
drug design approaches, with the target-based strategy involving target identification 
related to disease state. While these investigations drive potent chemical optimiza￾tion of lead compounds, clinical trials may have limitations (Swinney, 2013; Zheng 
et al, 2013). According to a recent study, invalidated illness targets result in many 
unsuccessful medication candidates in Phase II and III clinical trials. Computational 
technologies such as machine learning (ML) tools have been widely used to improve 
the hit rate in drug development molecules (Jaén-Oltra et al, 2000; Marrero-Ponce 
et al, 2005).
Singh and colleagues established a Bayesian classification model based on 
structural fingerprints and physicochemical property descriptors. They applied 
it to virtually screen an independent data set of 200k molecules, exhibiting that 
the model can screen top hits of PubChem Bioassay actives with up to 76% accu￾racy. Computational approaches such as deep learning and ML have been highly 
employed in improving drug discovery hit rates for many synthetic and naturally 
derived drugs (Singh et al, 2012). Ekins and colleagues developed Bayesian mod￾els to predict compound activity toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis, then com￾putationally screened 82,403 molecules and chose 550 for in vitro testing, yielding 
124  actives against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, there has been little 
study on categorization predictions for phenotypic screening of neuroprotective 
drugs so far (Ekins et al, 2014).
The objective of this book chapter is to provide an overview of multiple natural 
products and their diverse phytochemical constituent profile against neurotoxicity, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation. In addition, recent tactics of ML and deep learn￾ing in natural product screening against neuroprotection have also been emphasized.
11.2 PHYTOCHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF NATURAL 
PLANT PRODUCTS
The majority of the bioactive components found in different parts (leaves, seeds, 
flowers, roots, and stems) of natural plants are reported to be flavonoids, terpenes, 
polyphenols, and CT, at varying concentrations. Phytochemical compounds display 
multiple therapeutic mechanisms, including kinase-mediated aberrant signal trans￾duction and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory stimulation. Flavonoids are classi￾fied as secondary metabolites of polyphenolic nature, found mainly in plants, with 
dietary consumption values. They have a generalized 15-carbon skeletal structure 
consisting of a heterocyclic pyrane ring connecting (with an embedded O group) 
two benzene rings, C6-C3-C6. Presently, nearly 6000 types of flavonoids have been Deciphering the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Tactics 207
identified from several plant species, including proanthocyanins, flavones, biofla￾vonoids, flavonol glycosides, and acylated flavonol glycosides (Ullah et al, 2020). 
Alteration in the structural skeleton affects and defines the structural basis for its 
related derivatives. They exert several beneficial effects in the prevention of cancer, 
cardiovascular disorders, NDD, and diabetes (Safe et al, 2021). CT are a sub-class 
of terpenoids, tetraterpenoids, producing organic pigments for plants, algae, and 
certain fungi. They are further divided into two categories, carotenes (containing 
hydrocarbons with no O-atoms) and xanthophylls (containing O-atom). They are 
composed of four terpene units with ten carbon atoms each, providing a total of 
40 carbon atoms, with their absorbance wavelengths ranging from 400 to 550 nM. 
Data from several epidemiological studies suggest that carotenoid consumption in 
humans and animal models appears to be protective against breast, prostate, head, 
and neck cancer and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Tan and Norhaizan, 2019). Terpenes 
are unsaturated hydrocarbon-containing natural products produced by plants and 
contain nearly 30,000 compounds. They are further classified by the number of car￾bon present, such as monoterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, and are regarded 
as beneficial phytocompounds for their anti-apoptotic, anti-platelet, anti-microbial, 
and anti-inflammatory activities (Ninkuu et al, 2021).
11.3 ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE – A CRITICAL PROSPECT 
OF NEUROTOXICITY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurological condition that gradually deteriorates 
cognition and perception prior to progressing to advanced dementia. The underly￾ing pathogenic cause of AD is considered to be neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and 
amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils. The clinical effectiveness of natural plants for treating neu￾ral conditions can be achieved by the evaluation of these two pathological protein 
aggregates in the brain tissue. Numerous studies suggest that bioactive plants and 
plant extracts such as curcumin, Ginkgo biloba, and resveratrol are known to pos￾sess potent anti-AD activities for their varied constitution of bioactive phytochemicals 
(Shareena and Kumar, 2022). EGB 761-treated P301S TG mice depicted declining 
levels of p-tau, enhanced learning retention, spatial memory, mitigated p38, glycogen 
synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK-3β) signaling, rescued cyclic AMP-response element 
binding protein phosphorylation, and synaptophysin loss in cultured cortical neurons 
(Qin et al, 2018). Further, dietary EGb-treated-TF/CRND8 AD mice were shown to 
mitigate AD pathology via downregulating Aβ aggregate formation and modulation 
of β-secretase enzyme activity while reducing Aβ-induced proinflammatory cyto￾kine release, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, pre￾venting Aβ-mediated aberrant microglial activation (Colciaghi et al, 2004). In human 
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines, curcumin suppresses Aβ-mediated tau and GSK￾3β phosphorylation at Ser396, Thr231, and Ser9 residues and ameliorates HDAC6 
overexpression and Aβ toxicity. However, the neuroprotective impact of curcumin 
on Aβ-mediated GSK-3β dephosphorylation is not directly associated with oxidative 
stress. It abolishes Aβ-induced downregulation of Ak strain transforming (AKT) and 
PDPK1 phosphorylation at Thr308, Ser473, and Ser241, respectively, suggesting that 
the second response, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), consists of 208 NeuroPhytomedicine
curcumin-protective signaling. Likewise, insulin receptor (IR)/phosphatidylinositol￾3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, as a regulatory response signal of PIP3, does not involve 
Aβ-mediated AKT deactivation (Thr308, Ser473 dephosphorylation). In addition, Aβ
expression leads to increased levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a 
negative PIP3 regulator, which is suppressed by curcumin treatment, implying that 
curcumin is effectively Aβ-mediated tau phosphorylation engaging PTEN/AKT/
GSK-3β pathway (Huang et al, 2014). In another study, curcumin, in combination 
with resveratrol, downregulates ROS generation, ameliorates oxidative stress, pre￾vents tau hyperphosphorylation at T181 and T205 residue sites, and exhibits neu￾roprotective actions on SH-SY5Y cells from Aβ oligomer damage (Yu et al, 2022). 
In P301L/rTg4510 mice, cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) treatment improves memory 
capabilities, spatial learning, and cognitive impairment, represses synapse, and neuro￾nal loss, mitigates brain atrophy, enhances synaptic proteins, preserves cytoskeleton, 
prevents tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation in rTg4510 mice’s cerebral tissues. 
Mechanistically, CIG enhances the PP2A activity, upregulates PP2Ac methylation at 
Leu309, reduces PP2Ac phosphorylation at Tyr307, and promotes protein expressions 
of PTPA, PTP1B, and LCMT-1 in the brain (Various plant products and their extract’s 
potent anti-AD activity is represented in Figure 11.1) (Ma et al, 2019). Novel osmotin 
FIGURE 11.1 The schematic diagram displays the therapeutic effect of natural plant prod￾ucts, such as curcumin, resveratrol, and osmotin, on the pathogenic AD species: Tau and aβ
protein species, preventing NFT hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, aβ-oligomer toxicity, 
synaptic dysfunctions, neuronal death, interneuronal aβ and Tau species migration, oxidative 
stress, cytokine release, in addition to suppressing activated microglia and astrocytes.Deciphering the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Tactics 209
extract significantly inhibits Aβ1-42-mediated synaptic deficits, memory impairment, 
BACE-1 expression, synaptotoxicity, and Aβ protein aggregates and accumulation. 
Moreover, osmotin-treated Aβ1-42-mice attenuates Aβ1-42-mediated tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation at Ser413 via regulation of aberrant p-GSK-3β (Ser9), p-PI3K, 
p-AKT (Ser473) phosphorylation, prevents neuronal apoptosis via p53-induced 
caspase-associated apoptotic pathway and neurodegeneration along with alleviating 
cellular neurotoxicity (Ali et al, 2015).
11.4 COGNITION
A common characteristic of many pathological conditions is cognitive decline 
or impairment. Memory, learning, thinking, and information processing are pri￾marily affected by the physiological changes that result in the body. For their 
abilities to improve cognition, many plant extracts have been used extensively in 
conditions like dementia, AD, and PD related to memory loss as the body ages 
(Eckert, 2010). Angelica gigas (AG), in combination with Bombyx mori silk￾worm (SW), notably protects hippocampal neuronal cells from H202-mediated 
cell death in HT22 mouse cell lines. It recovers Scopolamine-induced cognitive 
impairment and spatial learning. In specific, it upregulates mRNA and protein 
levels of phosphorylated p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 
and reduces Bax/Bcl2 apoptotic index expression (Guo et al, 2021). Gypenoside 
LXXV, derived from Gynostemma pentaphyllum, substantially alleviated cog￾nitive deficits in db/db mice and enhanced lipid metabolism and glucose toler￾ance. It drastically improved glucose uptake by the brain and markedly elevated 
p-AKT/total AKT, GLUT4, and PPARγ expressions with a negative impact 
on p-IRS-1/total IRS-1 levels (Meng et al, 2022). Dihydromyricetin (DHM) 
decreased protein carbonyl, lipid peroxidation levels, augmented catalase, and 
superoxide dismutase in the brain tissue in Pb-mediated mice. It mitigated 
Pb-mediated cell apoptosis, with an evident reduction in cleaved caspase-3, Bax. 
DHM facilitated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, pre￾vented activation of TLR4, p38, MyD88, and GSK-3, inhibited inflammatory 
cytokines (iNOS, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2), Aβ levels, and NF-κB nuclear trans￾location, indicating that DHM could enhance cognitive functional profile via 
prevention of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (Meng et al, 2022). 
Salidroside, obtained from Rhodiola rosea, prevents cognitive impairment due 
to hypoperfusion, and cerebral hypoxia, which was attributed to alteration of 
PI3K, NF-κB, HIFα, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs) signaling pathways. It enhances lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS)-mediated learning impairment, memory deficit, and neuroinflammation 
via modulating the SIRT-1dependent nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 
(NRF-2)/HO-1/NF-κB pathway. Salidroside improves cognitive profile in ortho￾pedic surgery-mediated cognitive impairment mice, decreasing the expressions 
of M1 marker genes (CCL5, CD16, CXCL1, CXCL10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α), ele￾vating M2 marker genes (Arg1, TGF-β, YM1, IL-4, and IL-10) and activating 
AMPK kinase/PPARγ pathway (Pan et al, 2022).210 NeuroPhytomedicine
11.5 BIOACTIVITIES OF NATURALLY DERIVED 
PHYTOCONSTITUENTS
11.5.1 Polyphenols
Numerous polyphenolic compounds are a class of natural products that can exhibit 
potent anti-tumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties through modula￾tion of ROS levels, ER stress, Ca+2 levels, and autophagy. B16-F10 cells, on treatment 
with P2Et, (Caesalpinia spinosa extract), mediated ER stress and apoptosis in mela￾noma cells. P2Et extract mediated ER stress signaling via (PKR)-like endoplasmic 
reticulum kinase (PERK) kinase phosphorylation, which can modulate Ca+2 levels 
and promote anti-tumor responses. It induced expression of ICD-associated DAMPs 
(ATP, Ecto-CRT, and HMGB1) release in a PERK-dependent manner (Prieto et al, 
2019). Dietary supplementation of green tea-derived EGCG rescues synaptic devel￾opment and dendritic defect in CDKL5-KO mice neurons. It restored the spine and 
brain maturation density, along with attenuating defective spine maturation and 
PSD95+ puncta cell population (Trovò et al, 2020). EGCG-treated BAEC cells 
resulted in increased NO production and phosphorylation of AKT, eNOS, and Fyn, 
depicting that ECGC has potent endothelial-dependent vasodilatory effects mediated 
by ROS and Fyn-dependent intracellular pathways, which lead to PI3K/AKT, eNOS 
activation. Mulberry polyphenol extracts (MPE) substantially suppressed phosphor￾ylated ERK, RAS, and Β-galactosidase levels and enhanced NO and iNOS synthase 
levels. NO increased the activation of AMPK and reduced HMG-CoA reductase 
activity via its phosphorylation. It promoted the association of cyclins to their CDK 
kinases and hyperphosphorylated RB. MPE prevented K-Ras-mediated A7r5 vascu￾lar smooth muscle cell senescence via enhancing AMPK and iNOS-dependent path￾ways, suggesting its powerful role in mitigating age-induced atherosclerosis (Chen 
et al, 2022). In p53/wild-type HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, Artemisia annua
L. polyphenols (pKAL) induced late apoptosis, morphological changes in cancer 
cells, associated with elevated acidic vesicles, loss of Golgi integrity, reduced DNA 
content via upregulation and downregulation of γ-H2AX/p53/p21/Bak cleavage/
phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)/p62/MAPK1/LC3B-I axis and AKT/β￾catenin/cyclophilin A/GM130, respectively, implying that p-KAL plays an essential 
survival role in HCT116 cell lines, via p-JNK/p62 signaling and by inhibiting ROS￾independent p53-dependent cell death signaling (Jung et al, 2021). Annurca apple
polyphenols selectively prevent malondialdehyde (MDA)-MB-231 cell proliferation 
and viability. APE promoted G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, correlated with p-cdc25C 
and p27 upregulation, along with p21 decrement. It also reduced the expression of 
several oncoproteins, including β-catenin, NF-κB, and c-myc, and suppressed AKT 
activation. Moreover, it lowered Dusp-1 levels, enhanced ROS production, and JNK￾c-Jun phosphorylation, portraying the underlying pathways of APE-mediated cell 
death in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines (Martino et al, 2019).
11.5.2 Saponin
Hederoside C (HedC), a pentacyclic triterpene saponin isolated from P. Koreana, 
demonstrated potent anti-cancer properties toward MG63, and U20S osteosarcoma Deciphering the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Tactics 211
cell lines wherein HedC prevented proliferative activity of both U20S and MG63 
cell lines, and induced apoptosis (downregulation of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end 
labeling–positive cells, cleaved caspase-9 and -3), in time- and dose-dependent man￾ner. HedC-treated cells exhibited elevated p21, p53, Bax, and lowered Bcl-2, whereas 
HedC-induced apoptosis was followed by reduced STAT3, MAPKs (JNK, ERK1/2, 
and p38) phosphorylation. In in vivo xenograft mouse model, HedC showed an anti￾metastatic effect via suppression of neoplastic migration and invasion, ameliorated 
and enhanced expressions of p-STAT3, PCNA, and p53, cleaved caspase-3, respec￾tively, asserting that HedC has anti-metastatic, anti-tumor potentials (Park et al, 
2021). Ginsenoside Ro (GRo) (Panax ginseng’s oleanolic saponin) notably attenuates 
LPS-mediated lung injury and proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-1β, 
TNF-α. In addition, it inhibits the binding of LPS488 (fluorescence-labeled LPS) to 
membranes of RAW264.7 macrophages, suppresses MAPK, NF-κB phosphoryla￾tion, p65 nuclear translocation, dose-dependently. Moreover, docking and molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulation analysis suggest that GRo is effectively docked into LPS 
binding regions of MD2/TLR4 complex with stable binding conformation, implying 
that GRo serves as a therapeutic anti-inflammatory agent (Xu et al, 2022). Findings 
display that cycloastragenol-treated mice brains were evaluated for their effects 
against Aβ-mediated neurogenic dysfunctions, mitochondrial apoptosis, and oxida￾tive stress. Treatment with cycloastragenol effectively inhibited expressions of MAP 
kinases such as p-p38, p-JNK, and ERK1/2, reduced inflammatory markers (Iba-1, 
IL-1β, TNF-α, and GFAP), mitigated activated microglia and astrocytes. It improved 
Aβ-mediated cognitive impairment, regulated anti-apoptotic effects, upregulating 
and downregulating Bcl-2, Bax, Bim, and Casp-3, respectively, and promoted neu￾ronal nuclei (NeuN), p-CREB expressions in the frontal cortex and hippocampal 
regions of mice’s brains, confirming its neuronal survival effect (Ikram et al, 2021).
11.5.3 Carotenoids (CT)
CTs are a class of tetraterpenoids, constituting conjugated polyene chains with eight 
units of C5 isoprenoids. CTs are found in several sources, such as photosynthetic and 
non-photosynthetic plants, animals, and aquatic sources. With the presence of varied 
functional groups, number of conjugated double bonds, and cumulative polarities, CT 
exerts potent ROS scavenging, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti￾drug resistance, and anti-cancer properties (Kabir et al, 2022). Carotenoid, identified 
from Spondias mombin, exhibits potent anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative activi￾ties in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene breast cancer models in female Wistar rats. 
Carotenoid isolate treatment remarkably downregulates the expressions of MMP-2, 
HIF-1, VEGF, VEGFR, and EGFR in mammary tumors while upregulating mRNA 
levels of CHD-1. The binding of astaxanthin produced the DFG-out conformation, 
7,7′,8,8′-tetrahydro-β, -β-carotene, and β-carotene-15,15′-epoxide to the ATP binding 
domain, with interaction energies of −8.2, −10.3, and −10.5 kcal/mol, respectively 
(Metibemu et al, 2021). Synergistic dosing of doxorubicin, in tandem with dietary 
carotenoid fucoxanthin (FUC), drastically enhances DOX’s cytotoxicity profile and 
limits the dose of DOX (FR) in DOX-resistant cancer cell lines, including HepG-2/212 NeuroPhytomedicine
ADR (HCC), MCF-7/ADR (BC) and SKOV-3/ADR (ovarian cancer) by 6.28, 8.42, 
and 4.56-fold, respectively, FUC elevates DOX accumulation in resistant cells, in con￾trast to verapamil, FUC, and DOX together, increase Rho123 build-up, p53 caspases 
(CASP8, CASP3) activity, decrease the expressions of ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2 
along with PXR, GST, and CUP3A4 in resistant cancer cells, respectively (Eid et al, 
2020). A low DOX dose with carotenoid substantially promoted anti-proliferation and 
cytotoxicity in treated MCF-7 and MDA-MV-231 cell lines, compared with high-dose 
DOX treatment alone. It caused G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, promoted selective 
ROS-induced apoptosis, prevented mitochondrial dysfunctions, and downregulated 
protein expressions of p21, p27, p53, Bcl-2, Bax, and cyclin D1, thereby improving 
cancer therapy. In MDA-MB-231 cell lines, β-carotenes were reported to display sig￾nificant antitumoral actions by suppressing cell proliferation, migration, and inva￾sion ability. β-carotene promotes apoptosis by interfering with S-phase cell arrest and 
upregulates 3H-deoxy-D-glucose uptake, while it does not affect either 3H-folic acid 
or 3H-glutamine uptake and oxidative stress. Β-carotene’s anti-proliferative effect 
involves JNK intracellular signaling and did not impact cell viability, cell cycle, pro￾liferation, and migration capabilities of MCF12-A non-tumoral cell lines, asserting 
that β-carotene exhibits cancer cell-selective actions (Antunes et al, 2022).
11.5.4 Flavonoids
Flavonoids are a group of polyphenolic secondary bioactive metabolites that are 
found in plants and are commonly consumed as dietary supplements due to their 
immense therapeutic benefits. A citrus flavonoid, diosmetin displays a range of 
therapeutic impacts for its antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. 
In DNCB-mediated atopic dermatitis (AD) mouse models, diosmetin remarkably 
lowers epidermis thickness, dermatitis score, and mast cell population compared 
with untreated groups. It mitigates the macrophage infiltration into AD lesions, 
with the observed reduction in IL-4, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Further, diosmetin ham￾pers nitric oxide production, downregulates iNOS expression, suppresses MAPKs 
(JNK, p38, ERK1/2), and JAK/STAT3 signaling phosphorylation and activation, 
respectively, in raw 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line (Lee et al, 2020). Oral dos￾ing of fisetin (FIS) in HFD-fed mice ameliorates HFD-induced cardiac dysregula￾tions and metabolic disorders by reducing insulin levels, insulin resistance, body 
weight, and fasting blood glucose. FIS supplementation substantially prevents the 
pathology of dyslipidemia in both mouse cardiomyocytes and the heart, triggered by 
metabolic stress. Moreover, FIS treatment represses HFD-mediated inflammatory 
responses in cardiac tissues via lowered Tnfr-1/Tnfr-2 signaling and downstream 
target expressions. It promotes a robust reduction in fibrosis-associated genes, attrib￾uting to attenuation of fibrosis by inactivating TGF-β1/Smads/ERK1/2 signaling (Hu 
et al, 2020). Dietary flavonoid galangin prevents metastatic features such as TPA￾mediated HepG2 cell migration and invasion via inhibiting TPA-mediated PKC-δ, 
PKC-α, phospho-IkBα, c-Jun, C-Fos, and NF-κB, thus showcasing its applications 
in anti-metastatic clinical therapy. Myricetin portrays potent anti-cancer, antioxi￾dant, and anti-inflammatory activities, serving as a potential therapeutic agent. In 
U-86 MG cell lines, myricetin treatment depicts anti-glioblastoma, anti-proliferative Deciphering the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Tactics 213
effects, hampering cellular migration and invasion, and PTEN status independently. 
The cytotoxic actions of myricetin are cell-sensitive, wherein it shows minimal 
cytotoxicity to normal astrocytes, in contrast to the GBM cell line. Additionally, 
it suppresses the synthesis of focal adhesions, membrane ruffles, lamellipodia, and 
vasculogenic mimicry and blocks the ROCK2 phosphorylation, cortactin, paxillin, 
JNK, and PI3K/AKT signaling. Myricetin binds to various kinases and scaffold pro￾teins such as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), c-Jun, JNK, vinculin, 
VE-cadherin, and PI3K catalytical isoforms (p110α-γ) (Zhao et al, 2018).
11.6 MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING 
TACTICS IN NATURAL PRODUCT DRUG 
DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT
11.6.1 Machine Learning Approaches
ML involves algorithms analyzing curated data to make decisions and build effi￾cient models for different functions. So far, several ML tools and development kits 
have been utilized, including TensorFlow, Random Forest, Waikato Environment 
for Knowledge Analysis, Scikit-Learn, and Support vector machine. The benefits of 
using ML tools in a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) study include 
an accurate prediction of the influence of a compound’s chemical structure on its 
bioactivity and the modeling of drug toxicity and metabolism (Stitou et al, 2019). 
Therefore, ML is considered an essential resource for discovering new drugs (Dara 
et al, 2022).
Yang et al reported developing a neuroprotective ML model for identify￾ing potent neuroprotective compounds in Xiaxuming decoction (XXMD) against 
H202-mediated and Hypoxia-induced brain cell damage. The TCM prescription 
Xiaoxuming decoction (XXMD) (made up of 12 herbs) has been a beneficial remedy 
for the therapy of stroke in clinical settings, as documented in the Tang Dynasty’s 
Beiji Qianjin Yaofang. They constructed stacked naïve Bayesian models based on 
molecular fingerprint descriptors and four distinct single classifiers (AB, CT, kNN, 
and RF). The finalized models were used for the virtual screening of neuroprotective 
agents in XXMD and further selected for cell-based assay. Among the compounds, 
two compounds substantially inhibited Na2S2O4-induced and H2O2-mediated neuro￾toxicity (Yang et al, 2019). Baicalein was discovered to be a potent neuroprotective 
drug in this work, with effects on hypoxia and oxidative stress phenotypes. Baicalein 
has gained significant focus for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as a 
bioactive phenolic flavonoid molecule. The validation of baicalein against two dam￾age phenotypes suggests that it might be used as a promising neuroprotective agent 
(Dinda et al, 2017).
Another study by Fang J and colleagues reported 28 compounds exhibiting neu￾roprotective properties against H2O2-mediated and monosodium glutamate-induced 
neurotoxicity by ML approaches. The results suggested that techniques that inte￾grated single classifiers into combined Bayesian models could be a viable approach 
to predicting neuroprotective compounds. On monosodium glutamate-induced and 
H2O2-induced PC12 cells, three selected molecules (J14572, J27152, and J27114) 214 NeuroPhytomedicine
demonstrate a favorable dose-response relation and cell viability. Cell survival for 
model groups affected by 40 mM monosodium glutamate or 300 mM H2O2 was 
significantly lower than in the control group (P 0.01) (Fang et al, 2016).
11.6.2 Deep Learning Approaches
Deep learning is a sub-field of ML that utilizes artificial neural cells to process data 
in decision-making. It also applies to the drug discovery process besides computa￾tional fields such as pattern recognition. It is highly implemented in QSAR stud￾ies; virtual screening; absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity
properties; and lead optimization. Earlier deep learning implementations propose 
a wide range of disease detection and prediction screening models, including a 
Densely connected convolutional neural network (CNN)-based automated COVID 
screening model, drug-target interaction CNN models, and CNN RF models to ana￾lyze drug functions from chemical structure (Chakravarti and Alla, 2019; Kumari 
and Subbarao, 2021). This novel approach has led to the discovery of several impact￾ful techniques that could be effectively utilized in phytochemical drug screening 
and their therapeutic and pharmacological targets in several chronic states, such as 
neuroprotection, neurotoxicity, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Hence, 
several studies surrounding such have been described, showing a vast diversity of 
models throughout its development phases (Shanmuganathan, 2016).
The algorithm for all the naturally derived drugs and compounds functions in 
three steps: (A) Collection of natural compounds and drug information from the 
public database. (B). Producing molecular interaction and chemical features from 
collected data by text mining, network analysis, and chemical property analysis. (C) 
Training the deep learning models on the elements of approved drugs and predicting 
the medicinal properties based on the trained model. Deep learning can increase 
prediction performance when the input characteristics are extensive and diversi￾fied by extracting high-level interpretation using low-level features. The mentioned 
approach has four consecutive levels: Input, partially linked hidden layers, fully 
coupled hidden layers, and output. The models are developed to forecast the likely 
effects list utilizing the input attributes. Theoretical knowledge, molecular interac￾tion, and chemical property data are generated for each drug or natural component 
and used as inputs to the model. Hidden layers extended their outputs by detecting 
nonlinear connections between low- and high-level data to provide a higher-level 
representation than the last layer (Yoo et al, 2020).
Rodríguez FR and colleagues developed a computational strategy involving deep 
learning, structural bioinformatics, and signaling pathway manual reconstruction to 
predict eight novel nicotine analogs’ neuroprotective activity based on the PI3KAKT 
pathway in the context of PD therapeutics. The model predicted the potential neu￾roprotective efficacy of seven novel nicotine analogs based on the binomial Bcl-2 
response regulated by PI3K/AKT activation (Rojas-Rodríguez et al, 2020).
Further studies by Wang H and co-workers identified sclareol as a naturally

isoform-specific assessment of Cav-antagonistic activities. Integrated in silico vir￾tual screening and deep learning models enabled the discovery of (6)-Gingerol and 
sclareol as novel Cav1.3 antagonists. In silico analysis of 198 candidate molecules 
produced 14 hits as the most promising Cav1.3 inhibitors.
Moreover, structure clustering analysis enabled a selection of five phytoconstitu￾ents as potential structures. In addition, parallel artificial intelligence–based valida￾tion showcased similar results, with a receiver operating characteristic curve–area 
under curve value of 97.78%. Experimentations on the five compounds with CaB-A 
assay confirmed that sclareol and (6)-gingerol portrayed robust inhibition on Cav1.3. 
Both molecules showed a more substantial antagonistic effect on Cav1.3-induced 
reporter gene expression than the Cav1.3-dependent CaB system. Sclareol-treated 
PD mouse models observed minimal loss in DA neurons, exhibited in vivo neu￾roprotective effects toward 6-ODHA-mediated neurodegeneration, prevented over￾synchronization and locomotion deficits of striatal neurons (the contrast between 
ML and deep learning approaches are described in Figure 11.2) (Wang et al, 2022).
11.7 CONCLUSION
The emergence of expanding disease conditions and the shortage of disease￾modulating or disease-alleviating therapies pose alarming challenges to research 
institutions. Although diagnosing and treating the symptomatic events of chronic

and deep learning techniques, utilized in drug discovery and development, virtual screening, 
and SAR study of phytochemicals and natural products.216 NeuroPhytomedicine
diseases aids in the prevention of advancing the disease state, the genetic predis￾position and the onset of the disorder should be mitigated beforehand. Thus, the 
advancements in molecular research technology have enhanced the identification of 
potent bioactive compounds and their underlying biochemical mechanism of action 
on target conditions. Along with it, several thousands of natural target molecules 
are being screened for varied in silico analysis, hoping to find feasible inhibitor 
molecules to discover potent drug candidates that involve phytochemical-based sig￾naling pathways. Their optimization becomes an essential discovery tool in chronic 
disease management. Natural products serve as a potential source of the poten￾tial drug candidate in the drug discovery pipeline, as well as their nutritional and 
cosmetic value. Most clinical drug trials and research studies conclude that the 
increased potencies, efficacies, and lowered toxicity of natural products have been 
asserted and found to produce synergistic positive effects in the treatment and man￾agement of a spectrum of diseases, such as AD. However, maintaining a consistent 
rate of drug discovery and development is crucial to guaranteeing a good medi￾cation profile and improved healthcare. As a result, several discovery tools have 
included ML and deep learning methodologies to assure lower error margins, exact 
calculations, and a viable solution to existing difficulties. This book chapter review 
summarized a critical approach to studying natural products, their derivative prop￾erties, and biochemical factors in chronic diseases, including AD. In addition, It 
highlighted the recent trends in ML and deep learning techniques providing a basis 
to synthesize further lead compounds.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
Phytochemicals are produced in the biosynthetic laboratory of plants. These natu￾rally occurring substances have the potential to be bioactive. The Greek word for 
plant is the source of the prefix “Phyto.” The term “secondary metabolites” is fre￾quently used to describe these compounds. Terpenes, polysaccharides, glycosides, 
terpenoids, coumarins, gums, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, and phenols are some 
of the different types of substances that fall under this category. Phytochemicals 
in plants give host plants a natural defence mechanism in addition to giving them 
flavour, colour, and scent (Okwu, 2004). Contrary to minerals and vitamins, phy￾tochemicals are essential for preventing age-related chronic diseases but are only 
minimally necessary for preserving cell viability.
The loss of the structure and functionality of the neural system results in the syn￾drome known as neurodegeneration. The risk factors for the disease, such as oxida￾tive stress, hypertension, abnormal antioxidant enzymes, cytoskeletal abnormalities, 
advanced age, genetic defects, autoimmunity, mineral deficiencies, metabolic toxic￾ity, and other vascular disorders, are revealed by numerous experimental and epide￾miological studies. Numerous substances have been investigated for the treatment 
of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), but because of their adverse effects, they only 
provide symptomatic relief. By altering the receptor activity of particular inhibitory 
neurotransmitters, phytochemicals play a critical part in preserving the chemical 
equilibrium of the brain (Yadav, 2021).
The majority of NDs progress over time. Because most brain illnesses result in a 
steady decline in health, early detection and therapy are essential to managing such 
anomalies. It is critical to have fresh and current knowledge of the cellular targets 
connected to neurological illnesses.

12.2 MOLECULAR MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFICIAL 
EFFECTS OF PHYTOCHEMICALS
By interacting with the molecular and cellular structure of the brain involved in 
memory formation, phytochemicals may inhibit and even partially reverse the age￾related loss in memory function. These interactions include the capacity to modulate 
growth factors in different brain regions, which in turn can up-regulate signalling 
pathways important for regulating and sustaining synaptic plasticity (Spencer et al, 
2009). The molecular processes by which phytochemicals prevent neurodegenera￾tive, neuropsychiatric, and neurotraumatic illnesses brought on by oxidative stress 
are correlated with their capacity to inhibit the harmful generation of both reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (Calabrese et al, 2010a, 2010b; 
Son et al, 2008; Tosetti et al, 2009) (Figure 12.1).
Phytochemicals function at the molecular level by activating the protein kinase B 
(PKB/Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signalling pathways, 
which then activate the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein 
(CREB). This increases the expression of several neurotrophins crucial for mediat￾ing memory formation (Spencer, 2010). Resveratrol, among other phytochemicals, 
FIGURE 12.1 Neurohormetic responses linked to signal transduction pathways mediated

receptor (NTFR); phospholipase C (PLC); diacyl-glycerol (DAG); protein kinase C (PKC); 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K); inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP 3); phospholi￾pase A 2 (PLA 2); nuclear factor-кB (nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB)); inhibitory subunit of
NF-кB (IкB); protein kinase B (Akt); PRK-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK); phos￾phatidylcholine (PtdCho); reactive oxygen species (ROS); nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 
2)-like 2 (Nrf2); Kelch-like erythroid Cap ‘n’ Collar homologue-associated protein 1 (Keap1); 
silent information regulator two protein1 (SIRT1); forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription fac￾tor; brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); cAMP response element binding protein 
(CERB); and sirtuins (SIRT 1).Future Trends and Directives for Research 223
modifies the activity of a wide range of other proteins, including the Forkhead box O 
(FOXO) family. Members of the FOXO family have been demonstrated to regulate 
cellular function in processes like cell survival through the control of apoptotic cell 
death, cell cycle progression, and cell longevity (Kops et al, 2002). The phosphati￾dylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT signalling pathway targets FOXO proteins, which 
are phosphorylated by PKB (Tang et al, 1999).
12.3 PHYTOCHEMICALS IN THE REGULATION 
OF BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITIES
12.3.1 Modulation of Enzyme Activities
At the protein level, inhibition of metabolic enzymes can be broadly categorized 
as competitive, non-competitive, or mechanism-based. Phytochemicals are suscep￾tible to the body’s detoxification processes, which include phase I-mediated oxida￾tion, phase II-mediated conjugation, and phase III-mediated transport because they 
are viewed as xenobiotics or foreign chemicals. The phytochemicals may function 
throughout these processes as competitive or non-competitive inhibitors of enzyme 
interaction with co-ingested substrates, such as pharmaceuticals and carcinogens. 
The interaction between phytochemicals and metabolic enzymes may also lead to 
the creation of reactive intermediates, a few of which might cause the enzyme to 
become inactive. This kind of inhibition is known as “mechanism-based.” Phenolic 
and sulphur-containing compounds are the most frequently mentioned examples of 
herbal components that hinder metabolic enzyme function (Mandlekar et al, 2006).
Numerous mechanisms of action that may prevent cancer have been linked to 
phytochemicals found in vegetables and fruits, including antioxidant activity or free 
radical scavenging, control of oncogene, tumour suppressor, or gene expression, 
induction of apoptosis, and modification of metabolic enzyme activity (Liu, 2004).
12.3.2 Stimulation of Adaptive Responses
Diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower risk of developing 
a number of severe diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. It is becom￾ing increasingly clear that many of the beneficial phytochemicals found in vege￾tables and fruits evolved as toxins that, at subtoxic doses, initiate adaptive cellular 
stress-response pathways in a wide range of cells, including neurons. This is true 
even though some beneficial phytochemicals may only act as antioxidants. The cell￾survival signalling kinases, the transcription factors CREB and nuclear factor 
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and the sirtuin family of histone deacetylases are 
examples of such “preconditioning” or “neurohormesis” pathways. By promoting the 
production of neurotrophic factors, protein chaperones, antioxidant enzymes, and 
other proteins that aid cells in withstanding stress, neurohormetic phytochemicals 
including resveratrol, sulforaphanes, and curcumin help shield neurons against dam￾age and disease (Mattson and Cheng, 2006).
Allium phytochemicals, which give garlic and onions their distinctive flavour and 
aroma, are found in large amounts in these meals. Animals exposed to the allium 224 NeuroPhytomedicine
compounds display strong anti-cancer effects through the stimulation, meant to 
defend organisms against poisons, which are phase-2 enzymes (Tsai et al, 2005).
12.3.3 DNA Methylation
Recent research has emphasized the interaction between the epigenome and can￾cer metabolism. For epigenetic mechanisms such as histone and DNA methylation, 
histone acetylation, or histone phosphorylation, metabolites like acetyl-CoA, ade￾nosine monophosphate (AMP), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), are necessary 
(Donohoe and Bultman, 2012). Therefore, the enzymes and metabolic pathways that 
provide these essential substances are essential for the upkeep and modification of 
the epigenome. In a methionine-deficient diet, there is a reduction in SAM levels, 
decreasing DNA and histone methylation and drastically affecting gene expression, 
all of which contribute to neurodegenerative disorders (Parasramka et al, 2012). 
Because betaine, methionine, choline, and folate metabolism are intertwined, defi￾ciencies in any one of these nutrients can lead to abnormalities in metabolism and 
function. Global DNA methylation patterns can be quickly impacted by a diet lack￾ing in methyl donor contributions (Niculescu and Zeisel, 2002).
12.3.4 Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects
Similar to other antioxidant compounds, polyphenolic phytochemicals (PPs) work 
in vitro by neutralizing dangerous free radicals such as lipid peroxides and chelat￾ing divalent metal ions to lower their oxidative potential (Haslam, 1998). PPs have 
powerful antioxidant activity in the plant tissue from which they originate as well 
as in any food in which they are included, notably at relatively high concentrations 
along with the presence of other antioxidants such as tocopherols and ascorbic acid. 
They are considered to prevent oxidative deterioration of food’s lipid component. 
However, according to recent research, the in vivo situation is presumably consider￾ably different.
The complexity of the absorption, digestion, interactions, and metabolism of phy￾tochemicals and foods undermines the comprehension and utilization of these anti￾inflammatory phytochemicals to reduce chronic inflammation and hence prevent 
chronic diseases, even though several phytochemicals in each category exhibit anti￾inflammatory effects (Borges et al, 2018) For instance, factors such as age, cultiva￾tion method, geographical distribution, species, harvesting season, part of the plant, 
and preservation method have a substantial impact on the phytochemical composi￾tion and quantity of plants (Lim et al, 2005).
Even at low dietary dosages in animals and humans, a variety of whole foods and 
phytochemicals appear to successfully prevent or reduce the indications of meta￾bolic syndrome (Amiot et al, 2016; Babu et al, 2012; Si and Liu, 2008). For instance, 
theobromine, a phytochemical found in cocoa, synergistically improved the anti￾hypertensive effect of (-)-epicatechin, one of the important phytochemicals in cocoa, 
by raising the level of (-)-epicatechin in humans’ bloodstream. This study indicates 
that consuming whole cocoa (extract) is preferable to consuming pure (-)-epicatechin 
alone for lowering blood pressure.Future Trends and Directives for Research 225
12.3.5 Induction of Tumour Suppressor Genes
Bioactive phytochemicals, which are readily available and have fewer adverse effects, 
have been studied for their potential function in epigenetic gene regulation for the 
treatment and prevention of cancer. The manipulation of chromatin modification and 
DNA methylation by various bioactive phytochemicals in cancer may have affected the 
expression of important tumour suppressors, tumour promoters, and oncogene genes. 
These bioactive phytochemicals demonstrated promising results against various can￾cers whether used alone or in conjunction with other phytochemicals. The main focus 
of cancer prevention and treatment is the activation of tumour suppressor genes and the 
downregulation of oncogenes using dietary phytochemicals. All of the important epi￾genetic mechanisms, including histone changes, miRNAs and DNA methylation have 
shown potential for alteration by dietary phytochemicals. These epigenetic changes 
result in changes in the functioning of cellular regulatory and metabolic pathways, 
which cause altered cells to lose their carcinogenicity (Stefanska et al, 2012)
Due to their established anti-cancer activities in several studies, natural phyto￾chemicals have generated significant attention both as chemotherapeutic adjuvants 
and chemo-preventive agents. Resveratrol (3,4,5 trihydroxystilbene, RSV) is a poly￾phenol prevalent in red grapes and peanuts and has been demonstrated to influence 
gene methylation patterns, as well as survival, apoptosis, and cell cycle (Lee et al, 
2013, 2014; Stefanska et al, 2012; Venkatalakshmi et al, 2016), thus looking at a 
reduction of monogenic disorders in the future.
12.3.6 Stimulation of the Immune System
Innate and acquired immune system components work well together to produce 
immunological responses. The immune system has drawn a lot of attention over 
the past three decades as a possible target of toxicity after exposure to medications, 
chemicals, or environmental toxins. Phytochemicals in plants give host plants a 
natural defence mechanism in addition to giving them flavour, colour, and scent 
(Venkatalakshmi et al, 2016).
A study was conducted on polysaccharides obtained from Helicteres angustifo￾lia L (HACP). When given to BALB/c mice carrying the 4T1 breast tumour, the 
polysaccharide made from HACP also showed strong immunomodulatory action. 
The weight of the tumour and the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 
interleukin (IL)-1 were significantly reduced after 15 days of therapy with HACP 
at doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg. In the HACP-treated group, there was also a 
reduction in lung metastasis. As a result, HACP significantly contributes to tumour 
suppression by moderating aberrant immune system activities (Vickers, 2017).
12.3.7 Antibacterial and Antiviral Effect
Numerous studies have demonstrated that multiple modes of action, including bacte￾rial membrane damage, suppression of virulence factors, reduction of the activity 
of toxins and enzymes, and bacterial biofilm formation, are how phytochemicals 
exercise their antibacterial activity (Barbieri et al, 2017). It takes roughly 10 years to 226 NeuroPhytomedicine
bring a new antibiotic to market, and discovering new antibiotics is time-consuming 
and expensive. As a result, finding new synthetic chemical compounds with bacte￾riophage and antibiotic capabilities has become increasingly important alongside the 
search for antibacterial agents derived from natural materials, such as phytochemi￾cals (Mandal et al, 2014).
Numerous active phytochemicals have been shown to have therapeutic uses 
against various viruses with varying genetic makeups and biological functions. 
These substances’ antiviral mechanisms can be explained in terms of their anti￾oxidant properties, scavenging abilities, ability to prevent DNA and RNA synthesis, 
ability to prevent viral entry or reproduction, etc. By combining in vitro and in vivo 
studies in various biological tests, a large number of candidate substances, such as 
phytochemicals and their synthetic derivatives, have been discovered (Naithani et al, 
2008) Aside from testing naturally occurring chemicals, various groups have cre￾ated novel analogues with potential antiviral action. When compared to the parent 
molecule, the primary goals of the structural alteration are to increase bioavailability 
and decrease toxicity. In order to survive, viruses must have access to host cells. For 
each virus, a distinct invasion tactic might be used. It could be used to prevent both 
DNA and RNA replication of viruses because medicinal plants contain an infinite 
range of chemical components.
12.4 PHYTOCHEMICALS AND NEUROHORMETICS
Hormesis is the process through which a substance that is poisonous at greater con￾centrations has a positive effect on the organism or cell when it is exposed at low 
doses. The definition of hormesis, which is frequently used in the field of toxicology, 
is “an adaptive response characterized by biphasic dosage responses with usually 
identical quantitative properties with regard to amplitude and range of the stimula￾tory response that is either directly caused or the outcome of compensatory bio￾logical processes following an initial disruption in homeostasis” (Calabrese et al, 
2011). According to the definition of neurohormesis, the adaptive process through 
which neurons (and consequently nervous systems and organisms) react to a moder￾ate amount of stress by improving their resistance to more severe stress that may 
otherwise be fatal or cause dysfunction or disease (Mattson and Cheng, 2006).
12.4.1 Phytochemicals Protecting Neuroinflammation
in Neurodegenerative Diseases
Numerous research has supported the biological benefits of Cantella asiatica (CA) 
and its phytochemicals, which have broad ethnopharmacological applications. These 
results indicate that CA imparts anti-inflammatory and pleiotropic neuroprotec￾tive advantages via its mitoprotective and antioxidative properties, which may be 
exploited for the treatment of ageing and NDs (Wong et al, 2021).
In placebo-controlled cross-over research with young college students, daily sup￾plementation with 60 g of walnuts for 8 weeks significantly enhanced inferential 
verbal reasoning. The fact that there were no changes between the control and diet 
groups in terms of memory, mood, or nonverbal thinking may be due to the study Future Trends and Directives for Research 227
being done on healthy, cognitively sound young adults. Walnuts might also aid in 
the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by regulating cognitive functions in the 
brain (Poulose et al, 2014).
12.4.2 Neuroprotective Mechanisms
The term “neuroprotection” refers to the methods and supporting systems that can pro￾tect the central nervous system (CNS) from the neuronal damage brought on by a vari￾ety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease 
(PD), cerebrovascular impairment, anxiety, seizures, AD, and others. Phytochemicals 
may be a useful tool in preventing neurodegenerative illnesses when it comes to 
neuroprotective techniques. There are numerous types of documented natural and 
manmade neuroprotective compounds. In recent years, both nationally and interna￾tionally, research institutions and enterprises have become much more conscious of 
herbal-based medicinal goods. Therefore, there has been a lot of attention paid to pos￾sible phytochemicals that can alter neuronal activity and prevent neurodegeneration. 
Herbal medicine, also known as phytotherapy, is an alternative and complementary 
therapy that makes use of plant parts for therapeutic purposes. It might be challenging 
to pinpoint which component of a herb is biologically active for a particular discus￾sion because herbal products typically contain a range of bioactive phytochemicals. 
Researchers from all around the world are looking for bioactive phytochemicals from 
plants that are employed in traditional medical systems like the Indian Ayurvedic 
medical system, the Korean medical system, the Mediterranean medical system, the 
Chinese medicinal system, etc., as neuroprotective agents (Kumar et al, 2015).
Due to the lack of clinically relevant medications, a sizable portion of the elderly 
population at risk for NDs such as AD and PD requires nutritional intervention to 
improve health. To do this, numerous phytochemicals’ anti-inflammatory mecha￾nisms, including those of resveratrol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), propolis, 
ginsenosides, and curcumin have been thoroughly investigated (Wang et al, 2018).
12.4.3 Neurohormetic Phytochemicals Regulating Immune Function
Phytochemicals which are primarily found in plants, fruits, and vegetables can reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular illnesses, malignancies, inflammatory, immunological dis￾eases, and neurological disorders. Plants can resist pests and pathogenic agents owing 
to their wide range of biological activities, which include antibacterial, antifungal, 
antioxidant, and anti-proliferative actions. But, when consumed by humans in rela￾tively tiny concentrations, phytochemicals are not poisonous but do mildly arouse 
cellular stress responses (Calabrese et al, 2010a, 2010b). Sulforaphane, curcumin, res￾veratrol, catechins, allicin, and hypericin are some of the most prominent endocrine 
phytochemicals that can activate the adaptive stress response signalling pathways, 
boosting cellular resistance to injury and illness (Mattson and Cheng, 2006).
Resveratrol is one of the compounds that is most explored as an immunomodu￾lator. Through extensive research, it has been concluded that resveratrol shows a 
hormetic biphasic dose-response relationship (Calabrese et al, 2012). Both low and 
high doses of resveratrol have been shown to drastically affect the cytotoxic activity 228 NeuroPhytomedicine
of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), protecting microg￾lial cells and lowering the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. These results dem￾onstrated the ability of resveratrol to either upregulate or inhibit immune response 
depending on concentration making it a potent and consumable neurohormetic phy￾tochemical drug (Falchetti et al, 2001).
Another interesting phytochemical compound is curcumin which is a well￾known primary ingredient in turmeric having immunomodulatory properties. It 
has the ability to control the activation of dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils, T 
lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes. Additionally, curcumin can lower the expression 
of pro-inflammatory cells and, at low dosages, boost antibody responses. It showed 
positive effects on a variety of diseases, including arthritis, asthma, AD, atheroscle￾rosis, diabetes, and cancer because of its capacity to modify the immune system 
(Gao et al, 2004; Jagetia and Aggarwal, 2007) (Table 12.1).
12.4.4 Hormesis-induced Memory Performance
The ageing of the global population poses significant social and health challenges. 
Age-related neurodegenerative disorders are becoming more prevalent. None of the 
neurodegenerative disorders are currently curable due to their progressive nature, and 
the available treatments can only help with symptom relief and slow down the pro￾gression (Sahebnasagh et al, 2022). In regard to this, many people view herbal medi￾cines and supplements as valuable health resources with a variety of uses (Eghbali 
et al, 2021; Hammad et al, 2019).
A plant-derived flavanol, epicatechin was studied for increasing memory perfor￾mance in mammals. The results revealed that it boosted C57BL/6 female mice’s 
cognitive response. Mice had enhanced memory, hippocampus angiogenesis, and 
neuronal spine concentration after 7 weeks of exercise and epicatechin (3 mg/kg) 
(Praag et al, 2007). Additionally, microarray observations showed that consuming 
epicatechin increased the expression of genes related to angiogenesis while decreas￾ing the expression of genes linked to inflammatory response and apoptosis.
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (10mg/kg), an important polyphenol 
extracted from green tea, had positive effects in restoring the cognitive deficit in rats

when administered a small dosage of 10 mg/kg by the modulation of S100B secre￾tion, acetylcholinesterase, and antioxidant activity (Biasibetti et al, 2013).
Resveratrol, a natural substance found in large quantities in grapes, was injected 
to help 7–8-month-old mice establish long-term memory by reducing the expression 
of miR-124 and miR-134 and controlling the concentrations of CREB, resveratrol 
had this positive effect (Zhao et al, 2013).
12.4.5 Hormetic Studies
12.4.5.1 Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
PD is a neurodegenerative condition marked by tremors, slow movement, and stiff￾ness that impairs the ability of the muscles to move. It is defined as the death of dopa￾minergic nerve cells. Rats with PD have shown that resveratrol is a helpful chemical 
for easing their symptoms.
A study on PD-affected nerves overwhelmingly points out the possibility of res￾veratrol having a neuroprotective effect caused by 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) 
a neurotoxin serving as a PD animal model which may be associated with a dimin￾ished inflammatory response.
As a result, the current study offers a mechanistic justification for the use of res￾veratrol in PD treatment. Additionally, cyclooxygenase-2 and TNF-α mRNA and 
protein overexpression caused by 6-OHDA in the substantia nigra were inhibited by 
resveratrol. More research is needed to determine whether resveratrol can be used to 
cure PD (Jin et al, 2008).
Through the inactivation of BAX Bcl-2 associated X, MDM2 proto-oncogene 
(Mdm2), and reduction of B-cell lymphoma 2 and Bcl-w expression, epigallocat￾echin 3-gallate (0.1–10 M) displayed neuroprotective actions in a mouse model of 
PD (Levites et al, 2002).
Most plants contain a flavonoid named luteolin, which has hormetic and neuroprotec￾tive properties against rotenone-induced damage in BV2 cells and also protects microg￾lia against rotenone. Low amounts of luteolin enhanced cell survival and decreased 
IL-1 and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mRNA levels (Elmazoglu et al, 2020) (Table 12.2).

12.4.5.2 Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is often perceived to be a mental illness connected to psychosis. 
Schizophrenic patients frequently experience delusions and hallucinations that seem 
disconnected from reality along with difficulties focusing on regular activities. 
Treatment is typically lifelong and frequently entails a mix of phytochemical drugs, 
psychotherapy, and specialized medical services.
People with schizophrenia had higher levels of endocannabinoid anandamide in 
their blood and cerebrospinal fluids (Davies and Bhattacharyya, 2019). The terpe￾noid class of compounds known as cannabinoids is useful for treating schizophrenic 
patients. For example, at lower doses, tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid, reduced 
the symptoms of schizophrenia by acting on endocannabinoid receptors (Schwarcz 
et al, 2009).
A bioflavonoid called quercetin is used to reduce the signs and symptoms of 
schizophrenia because of its capacity to neutralize free radicals (Mert et al, 2019).
Studies on the anti-schizophrenic properties of xanthones, such as α-mangostin 
and magniferin, have also been conducted (Lum et al, 2021)
Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics are given by α-mangostin. 
In rat models of schizophrenia, it was proven to be effective and to inhibit 
5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors and PDEs (phosphodiesterase).
Magniferin increased cognitive function by protecting mitochondrial processes, 
reducing dopamine, and acting as an anti-inflammatory agent (Table 12.3).
12.4.5.3 Huntington’s Disease (HD)
The clinical symptoms of Huntington’s disease (HD), a genetic neurological condition 
of the CNS, include escalating choreiform movements, personality abnormalities, 
deteriorating mental health, and early mortality.
HD has no known cure. However, some of the issues it causes, such as those 
brought on by depression, mood swings, and involuntary muscle contractions, can be 
lessened with the usage of some combinational drugs and support to assist in making 
daily duties easier.
Korean red ginseng was given at doses of 50, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day, and these 
dosages had therapeutic effects on the reduction of Huntington’s symptoms. The NF-B 
and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways were inhibited, whose mutations are 
responsible for exacerbating the disease’s symptoms. Additionally, this phytochemi￾cal reduced TNF-α mRNA expression and microglial activation (Jang et al, 2013).

Oral administration of fisetin and resveratrol (10μM) was useful for the treat￾ment of HD. They are readily available, small chemicals that can pass the blood￾brain barrier and stimulate ERK signalling thus protecting brain activity (Maher 
et al, 2011).
Small doses of protopanaxtriol injection dramatically improved behaviour, 
decreased the generation of free radicals, enhanced Nrf2 translocation into the 
nucleus, and boosted NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 and heme oxygenase-1 
expression in the striatum (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) (Gao et al, 2015) (Table 12.4).
12.4.5.4 Alzheimer’s Disease
AD is a dreadful disease more prevalent in the United States. It is characterized by 
dementia and atrophy (shrinkage of the brain) followed by the death of brain cells. 
This progressive neurodegenerative disorder destroys mental functions and memory.
The excessive protein buildup in and around brain cells is what causes AD. 
Amyloid is one of the proteins involved. Amyloid-β peptide is a key component 
of the neuropathology of AD, and oxidative stress may be the cause of amyloid-β’s 
neurotoxicity and deposits of it create plaques around brain cells (Flier et al, 2002).
Animal models of AD showed better learning and memory function when given 
ginsenoside extract from Panax ginseng. Gintonin when administered orally for 
three weeks in small doses reduced memory impairment and cholinergic dysfunc￾tions brought on by scopolamine and amyloid through reductions in choline acet￾yltransferase, acetylcholine concentration, and initiation of acetylcholine esterase 
activity (Kim et al, 2015).
According to findings, oral administration of sulforaphane in small doses at 
levels between 10 and 50 mg/kg caused animal models to exhibit anti-AD-like 
action. The primary component of green vegetables, sulforaphane, reduced levels 
of tau, amyloid-β, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and oxidative stress in ani￾mal and cell models to ameliorate cognitive impairment in various doses but the 
reduction in symptoms is dose-dependent. Because higher doses of sulforaphane 
cause sedation, disturbance in motor coordination, and reduced muscle strength 
(Kim, 2021) (Table 12.5).

12.4.5.5 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Autism is a chronic developmental disorder that affects a person’s capacity to inter￾act and communicate. The neurological system is impacted by ASD, which also 
has an impact on the sufferer’s general cognitive, social, emotional, and physical 
health. Symptoms can range significantly in scope and severity. The most common 
symptoms include difficulty in social interaction, communication problems, obses￾sive interests, and repetitive behaviours.
There is no known cause or effective therapy for autism to date. Therapy aims to 
enhance the child’s functioning by minimizing the symptoms of ASD and fostering 
growth and learning.
When used as a neurotherapeutic, phytochemicals can help to reduce the oxida￾tive stress that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD. Preclinical investigations 
on sulforaphane, hydroxytyrosol, and curcumin have produced promising outcomes.
It has been determined that autism causes a reduction in several functions. 
Sulforaphane and hydroxytyrosol are two substances that have been found to have 
metabolic effects on cellular stress responses which in turn activates Heat shock 
proteins (HSPs) and other mechanisms which are upregulated by sulforaphane￾enhancing cortical connections (Calabresec et al, 2016). Also, by inducing the Nrf2 
and HSF1-dependent genes, the substance also exhibits protective effects against a 
number of NDs (Singh et al, 2014; Zhang et al, 2011).
For example, a placebo-controlled, clinical demonstration revealed that Sulforaphane 
when administered orally every day for 18 weeks showed improved anti-autism symp￾toms. The aberrant Behaviour Checklist, The Social Responsiveness Scale, and the 
Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I) were three reliable behavioural 
assessments that were used to conclude the results. The study revealed that verbal com￾munication, aberrant behaviour, and social interaction were all improved, and these scores 
reverted to baseline levels after sulforaphane was stopped (Singh et al, 2014) (Table 12.6).

12.4.6 Drug Reaction to Neurological Medications
A neurohormetic biphasic dose-responses relationship is present in several medica￾tions. In other words, their positive benefits become more prominent at some low 
dose levels and become less significant at higher doses. Some of the medications 
with hermetic properties are anti-tumour drugs and anti-seizure drugs. In numerous 
animal models, these medications have additionally demonstrated a U-shape dose￾response association.
Levodopa, a drug that is used to treat PD has been observed to exhibit a hormetic 
reaction by relieving motor symptoms (Quattrone et al, 1995). This is due to the fact 
that while levodopa has toxic effects at greater dosages, it has prolonged therapeutic 
efficacy several days after treatment at low cumulative doses (Zappia et al, 2000). 
This drug has the ability to affect many cognitive processes through mesocortical 
dopaminergic pathways (Miller and Cohen, 2001).
Another example is the U-shaped response association of the drug named 
Physostigmine, a natural component of Calabar bean used to treat AD. In AD, some 
of the nerve cells that use acetylcholine are lost so to prevent the normal hydrolysis 
of acetylcholine, Physostigmine is administered. Following this, a number of medi￾cations, including huperzine, tacrine, and arecoline were examined for this anti￾acetylcholinesterase hypothesis. In numerous animal models, these medications have 
additionally demonstrated a U-shape dose-response association (Calabrese, 2008).
Furthermore, the most recent medication to be licensed called memantine which 
is an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist similarly works through an inverted U-shaped 
dose-response relationship that resembles hormetic (Calabrese, 2008).
12.5 ISSUES CONCERNING THE USE OF 
PHYTOCHEMICALS IN HUMAN HEALTH
Consuming plants for their goodness and health benefits, such as cancer prevention 
or treatment, or for therapeutic purposes has been a prevalent practice since the 
dawn of civilization. Fruits, vegetables, and many other plants contain phytochemi￾cals, which are not necessary nutrients like vitamins or minerals but are frequently 
ingested or utilized as herbal medicines or dietary supplements due to their claimed 
therapeutic benefits.

In fact, some studies have indicated that phytochemicals like resveratrol and epi￾gallocatechin gallate are useful for the treatment of cancer. Numerous dietary epi￾demiology data and animal studies for a wide range of dietary components point to 
potential protection against a number of malignancies, but these results have not yet 
been confirmed in randomized human clinical trials. In actuality, the majority of 
food intervention scientific trials have had relatively underwhelming results regard￾ing phytochemicals consumed in the diet.
12.5.1 Phytochemicals and Biphasic Dose Responses
At lower doses, supplemental administration of phytochemicals helps to improve 
deficits in spatial learning and memory. While these compounds have hormetic 
effects in AD and PD at low levels, neurotoxicity has been linked to greater quanti￾ties. Both low and high phytochemical doses have been proven to have therapeutic 
effects in HD, though low doses are more efficient than higher levels.
Low dosages of plant extracts or metabolites derived from plants have a consider￾able impact on diseases associated with ageing through mitohormesis, whereas high 
amounts accelerate mitochondrial respiration in the brain.
With these variations in the data, we can conclude that more clinical research, 
particularly in In vivo models is required to fill the knowledge gap regarding phyto￾chemicals’ hormesis activity in NDs.
12.6 CONCLUSION
By interacting with the molecular and cellular structure of the brain involved in 
memory formation, phytochemicals may be able to reverse the decline in brain 
function caused by age-related neurodegeneration. Inhibition of metabolic enzymes 
can be broadly categorized as competitive, non-competitive, or mechanism-based. 
Phytochemicals are susceptible to the body’s detoxification processes because they 
are viewed as foreign chemicals. Phenolic and sulphur-containing compounds are 
the most frequently mentioned examples of herbal components that hinder metabolic 
enzyme function. By interacting with the molecular and cellular structure of the 
brain involved in memory formation, phytochemicals may inhibit and even partially 
reverse the age-related loss in memory function. Numerous mechanisms of action 
that may prevent cancer have been linked to phytochemicals found in vegetables 
and fruits.
Numerous applications can be found with using herbal medicinal products and 
dietary supplements. It is advantageous to comprehend the underlying mechanism of 
action by using the hormesis phenomena in medicinal plants. Theoretically, hormetic 
models can account for a variety of effects in herbs, such as inhibition at greater 
dosages and stimulation at lower ones, which support their potential for regulating 
and treating disease. With recent advancements in medicine procuring drugs with a 
singular mechanism of action and/or inability to enter neurons, all pharmacological 
therapies for neurodegenerative illnesses appear to fail. Therefore, neurohormesis 
can be viewed as a potentially ground-breaking method of treating neurodegenera￾tive disorders. Neurodegenerative and other neurological illnesses may benefit from Future Trends and Directives for Research 235
neurohormesis, the adaptive component of the hormetic dose response in neurons 
(Sahebnasagh et al, 2022).
12.7 FUTURE DISCUSSIONS
There is still a disconnect between pharmacogenetics and pharmacological 
approaches to the treatment and cure of NDs, despite the common agreement in the 
field of pharmacology that it is preferable to delay or stop the progression of NDs. 
The systems, organs, and cells that are experiencing oxidative stress in ND states 
frequently experience imbalanced ionic gradients and are vulnerable to protein 
interference both inside and outside of the signalling pathways. The cells, organs, 
and systems are susceptible to damage in this environment. In vitro neuron cell mod￾els convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of dietary phytochemicals with NGF 
potentiation effects, although numerous problems must be solved before clinical tri￾als. To demonstrate the impact of dietary phytochemicals in preclinical in vivo mod￾els, additional research should be done.
Future studies should clarify whether the effects of phytochemical mixtures on 
the susceptibility of organs to ischemia are additive or synergistic. Future therapeu￾tic approaches may also combine pharmaceuticals and phytochemicals to increase 
drug efficacy and/or lessen drug adverse effects (Chen et al, 2008). Even more so 
than before, socioeconomic factors influence the rate at which new medications are 
developed. This is related to growing interest in the repurposing and repositioning of 
outdated medications or other substances frequently used in conventional medicine. 
Therefore, it is anticipated that interest in medications based on phytochemicals will 
increase in the near future for disorders linked to oxidative stress and inflammation 
(Forni et al, 2019).
