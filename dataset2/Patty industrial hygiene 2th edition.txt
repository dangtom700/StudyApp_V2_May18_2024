viiiPREFACE
Industrial hygiene is an applied science and a profession.
Like other applied sciences such as medicine and engi￾neering, it is founded on basic sciences such as biology,
chemistry, mathematics, and physics. In a sense it is a
hybrid profession because within its ranks are members of
other professions – chemists, engineers, biologists, physi￾cists, physicians, nurses, and lawyers. In their professional
practice all are dedicated in one way or another to the
purposes of industrial hygiene: the anticipation, recognition,
evaluation, and control of work-related health hazards. The
contributors to these volumes come from these professions.
Although the term “industrial hygiene” used to describe
our profession is probably of twentieth century origin, we
must go further back in history for the origin of its words.
The word “industry,” which has a dictionary meaning,
“systematic labor for some useful purpose or the creation of
something of value,” has its English origin in the fifteenth
century. For “hygiene,” we must look even earlier. Hygieia,
a daughter of Asclepius who is god of medicine in Greek
mythology, was responsible for the preservation of health
and prevention of disease. Thus, Hygieia, when she was
dealing with people who were engaged in systematic labor
for some useful purpose, was practicing our profession,
industrial hygiene.
Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology was originated by
Frank A. Patty with publication of the first single volume in
1948. In 1958, an updated and expanded second edition was
published with his guidance. A second volume, Toxicology,
was published in 1963. Frank Patty was a pioneer in indus￾trial hygiene; he was a teacher, practitioner, and manager.
In 1946, he served as the eighth president of the Amer￾ican Industrial Hygiene Association. To cap his professional
career, he served as director of the Division of Industrial
Hygiene for the General Motors Corporation.
At the request of Frank Patty, George and Florence
Clayton took over editorship of the ever-expanding Indus￾trial Hygiene and Toxicology series for the Third Edition
of Volume I, General Principles, published in 1978, and
Volume II, Toxicology, published in 1981–1982. The First
Edition of Volume III, Theory and Rationale of Industrial
Hygiene Practice, edited by Lewis and Lester Cralley, was
published in 1979, with its second edition published in 1984.
The ten-book, Fourth Edition of Patty’s Industrial Hygiene
and Toxicology, edited by George and Florence Clayton, was
published in 1991–1994, and the Third Edition of Volume
III, Theory and Rationale of Industrial Hygiene Practice,
edited by Robert Harris, Lewis Cralley, and Lester Cralley,
was published in 1994. With the agreement and support of
George and Florence Clayton, and Lewis and Lester Cralley,
Robert Harris edited the fifth edition of Patty’s Industrial
Hygiene. Vernon Rose and I edited the sixth edition of
Patty’s Industrial Hygiene with the permission of Robert
Harris.
It is now my privilege and honor to follow them and
Frank A. Patty as the editor of the seventh edition of the
Industrial Hygiene volumes of Patty’s Industrial Hygiene
and Toxicology. Each of the four volumes and the chapters
in the seventh edition are a “stand alone.” Volume 1 covers
Chemical Hazard Recognition, Volume 2 addresses Evalua￾tion and Control of Chemical Hazards, Volume 3 considers
aspects of Physical and Biological Agents, and Volume 4
considers Management and Specialty Areas of Practice. In
addition, Volume 4 contains a complete index covering all
four volumes.
Industrial hygiene has been dealt with very broadly in
the past editions of Patty’s Industrial Hygiene and Toxi￾cology. Chapters have been offered on sampling and anal￾ysis, exposure measurement and interpretation, absorption
and elimination of toxic materials, instrument calibration,
ixPREFACE
industrial noise, ionizing and nonionizing radiation, heat
and cold stress, pressure, lighting, control of exposures,
ergonomics, hazardous wastes, and other vital areas of prac￾tice. These traditional areas continue to be covered in this
edition. Consistent with the past history of Patty’s, new
areas of industrial hygiene concerns and practices have been
addressed: robotics, sensors, social media, nanomaterials,
infectious diseases, dermal effects of chemical exposures,
mathematical modeling, control banding, product steward￾ship, construction health and safety issues, cannabis, new
energy production, health care work settings, emergency and
disaster response, sustainability, and fire safety.
Although industrial hygiene has been practiced in
one guise or another for centuries, the most systematic
approaches and the most esoteric accomplishments have
been made in the past 50 or 60 years – generally in the years
since Frank Patty published his first book. This accelerated
progress is due primarily to increased public awareness of
occupational health and safety issues and need for envi￾ronmental control as is evidenced by Occupational Safety
and Health, Clean Air, and Clean Water legislation at both
federal and state levels.
Industrial hygienists know that variability is the key to
the measurement and interpretation of workers’ exposures.
If exposures did not vary, exposure assessment could be
limited to a single measurement, the results of which could
be acted upon, and the matter filed away as something of no
further concern. We know, however, that exposures change,
and change is characteristic of the science and practice of
our profession as well. We must be alert to recognize new
hazards, we must continue to evaluate new and changing
stresses, and we must evaluate performance of exposure
controls and from time to time upgrade them. These volumes
represent the theory and practice of industrial hygiene as they
are understood by their chapter authors at the time of their
writing. But, as observed by the Greek philosopher Hera￾cleitus about 2500 years ago, “There is nothing permanent
except change.” Improvements and changes in theory and
practice of industrial hygiene take place continuously and are
generally reported in the professional literature. Industrial
hygienists, the practitioners, the teachers, and the managers
must stay abreast of the professional literature. Further￾more, when an industrial hygienist develops new knowledge,
he/she has what almost amounts to an ethical obligation to
share it with others in the profession.
One cannot ponder the rapid changes and advancements
made in recent decades in science and technology, and in
our own profession as well, without wondering at what
the next two or three decades will bring. Developments in
computer technology, information processing, and exchange
and communications have greatly influenced workplaces and
the general conduct of commerce and business in the past one
or two decades. It has also changed the way we now prac￾tice the purposes of industrial hygiene. These changes have
accelerated. The possibility for continuously monitoring and
computer storage of exposures of individual workers is a
reality. World population continues to increase geometrically
and is expected to be about eight billion in the year 2025;
with improvements in preventive health care, there will be
an increasingly older population. Genetic engineering and
highly effective pesticides are already improving yields of
agricultural commodities; if all goes well in this area, feeding
the expanding human population may not be a limiting
factor. Globalization of manufacturing and commerce has
reduced manufacturing employment in the United States and
in Europe, and expanded opportunities for populations in
some developing nations. The United States and other devel￾oped nations are on their way to becoming world centers of
information and innovation.
How will all of this affect the future practice of industrial
hygiene? In the Preface to the fourth edition of Patty’s,
George and Florence Clayton suggested that the future of
industrial hygiene is limited only by the narrowness of vision
of its practitioners.
I have relied extensively on the well-written Preface by
Robert Harris, Editor of the fifth edition of Patty’s Industrial
Hygiene. In it I saw a sweeping, but still succinct, review
not only of Patty’s publications but also of the practice of
industrial hygiene itself. His writing is as timely in 2021 as
it was 20 years ago.
Occupational and environmental hygiene professionals
must be aware of the changes likely to take place, and to
develop strategies to assure the profession’s full participa￾tion in protecting the health and safety of workers and the
environment of both today and tomorrow. Our participation,
locally, nationally, and globally, will continue to be greatly
needed in the coming years.

CHEMICAL EXPOSURE EVALUATIONBIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
Nancy B. Hopf, Ph.D. and Silvia Fustinoni, Ph.D.
1 INTRODUCTION
Occupational health experts began to monitor workers’
chemical exposures by measuring the internal dose of a
chemical of interest, which gave a more reliable estimate
of total exposures such as lead concentrations in urine
(1–3). Other human biomonitoring methods sought to
measure a chemical’s biotransformations in the body, its
metabolites. For instance, urinary sulfate was determined
in benzene-exposed workers (4). Periodically monitoring
industry workers who were exposed to especially benzene
was recommended, and the aim was to remove workers
from the site before symptoms of acute poisoning (such as
anemia) appeared.
Quantifying the parent chemical compound or its metabo￾lites – or biomarkers of exposure – in urine and blood is still
a widely used biomonitoring approach. The metabolites can,
in some instances, be a better measure of toxic exposure
than the presence of the compound itself (e.g. quantifying
urinary 2,5-hexandione, the toxic metabolite, to determine
hexane exposure). Human biomonitoring uses techniques
of analytical chemistry to detect the presence of specific
chemicals in human bodily fluids and tissues. This kind
of biomonitoring relies on the sensitivity of the chemical
assays and instruments, which since the 1960s have become
able to measure ever-smaller amounts of specific substances
(2). For example, these techniques can detect one drop of
ink in one of the largest tanker trucks used to haul gaso￾line, which is about one part per billion. Improvements in
laboratory technology are driving the popularity of human

biomonitoring, as specialists can now detect extremely
low levels of multiple markers using a relatively small
sample. High precision analytical instruments are used to
specifically quantify chemicals or their metabolized residues
such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, gas,
and liquid chromatography coupled with single or triple
quadrupole mass spectrometry, even in the presence of
isotopically labeled analogs as internal standards to further
improve assay’s performance.
Biomarkers that measure bodily alteration such as
changes in blood composition to assess a specific disease
are known as biomarkers of effect. For instance, changes
in blood cell composition profiles were used in order to
protect hospital workers in radium units from radioactive
exposures in the 1920s. Blood cell changes were known
to precede radiation-induced diseases such as aplastic
anemia. Back then, the British X-ray and Radium Protection
Committee recommended that radium units in hospitals
adopt in-house blood monitoring programs to reduce the
occurrence of aplastic anemia among exposed workers. This
biomonitoring approach was later abandoned for a far easier
radiation exposure-monitoring program where workers wear
dosimeters attached to their clothing. Radiation-induced
damage in individuals was later measured using genetic
testing or the determination of condensed chromosomes – or
karyotyping – by way of microscopy. Extensive data on chro￾mosomal aberrations (CAs) in response to ionizing radiation
have been provided from studies in survivors of the atomic
bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki (5). This chromosome
3PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
aberration method was later used to monitor uranium miners
and workers in the nuclear industry exposed to radiation (6).
Although a biomarker of effect may be related to expo￾sure to a specific chemical, it is more closely related to
the occurrence of an adverse health effect (7). Damage to
genetic material (chromosomes or DNA) or other molec￾ular alterations (e.g. adducts) that are chemically induced by
exposure are used to survey workers at risk. For instance,
occupational exposure to the sterilizing agent ethylene oxide
can be monitored with a detectable chemical modification
of the hemoglobin molecules in their blood namely the N-
(2-hydroxyethyl)valine (HEV) hemoglobin adduct. Another
example is lead’s ability to induce anemia by inhibition of
heme synthesis. Lead inhibits delta-Aminolevulinate dehy￾dratase (ALAD), the second enzyme in the heme biosyn￾thesis pathway. ALAD is a zinc metalloenzyme, and its inhi￾bition by lead substitution for zinc is one of the most sensitive
indicators of blood-lead accumulation, a measure of recent
lead exposure (8). Cytogenetic alterations in cultured periph￾eral blood lymphocytes, such as CAs and sister chromatid
exchanges (SCEs), are used as biomarkers of effects to assess
risk from exposures to carcinogens (9). Micronuclei (MN)
present in cultured human cells are a measure of genotoxic
exposure, and this biomarker of effect is predictive for cancer
(10, 11). It is important to note that determining the actual
biological damage might potentially be more informative
than a simple exposure level but also note that individuals
will vary in their susceptibility to such damage.
Biomarkers of exposure generally give a picture of a
worker’s current exposure while biomarkers of effect reflect
chronic exposures. For instance, lead concentration in blood
is a measure of current exposure while lead in bone is a reflec￾tion of cumulative exposures (12). Exposure biomarkers fluc￾tuate with an individual’s exposure. Exposure biomarkers
reflect both absorption and the compound’s apparent elimi￾nation half-life in the body. It is, therefore, pertinent to collect
the blood or urine sample at maximum exposure to avoid
underestimating the body burden. This is not the case for
biomarkers of effect where the sampling time is generally
not critical. Exceptions to this general overview exist such as
carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin.
Exposure biomarkers are used to integrate skin exposure,
as measurements of airborne contaminants in the workplace
fail to register other routes than inhalation exposure. Skin
patches have been used to monitor potential skin exposure
but this method does not take into account skin absorp￾tion. A biomarker of exposure can assess the bioavailability
of the chemical and consequently, the body burden can be
determined. Biomonitoring is also used to assess the effi￾ciency of personal protective equipment (PPE). For example,
workers wearing PPE to protect themselves from agents that
are readily absorbed through the skin might become exposed
because of a nonvisible tear in a glove. This breach in protec￾tion can only be monitored through biomarkers of exposure.
Human biological monitoring is a powerful tool for
assessing human systemic exposure to hazardous substances
by inhalation, ingestion, and absorption through the skin.
Regular monitoring helps to reassure workers their exposure
continues to be well controlled (13). Irreversible biochemical
and functional changes are consequently not recommended
as biomarkers for exposure monitoring because abnormal
values already indicate a health injury that is supposed to be
prevented by the monitoring.
At work, reducing exposure to toxic chemicals and their
health effects can be implemented with biological moni￾toring programs and by comparing results to biological limit
values (BLVs). The initiative in promulgating BLVs for
biomarkers started in the 1970s. In the US, this movement
was initiated by the organization for professional indus￾trial hygienists; the American Conference for Governmental
Industrial Hygiene (ACGIH), and in Europe, by the German
Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of
Chemical Compounds in the workplace (MAK commission)
of the German Research Association (DFG or Deutsche
Forschung Gemeinschaft). Since then, both ACGIH and
DFG have published their yearly list of BLVs where BLVs
are updated and/or new ones added. EU and its Scien￾tific Committee on Occupational Limit values (SCOEL)
continued this initiative. In addition, several countries have
their own commissions and set country-specific biological
exposure limit values such as France, Finland, and Japan.
Expansion of biomonitoring beyond occupational health
to the population at large started in the mid-1920s with
the health hazards of tetraethyl lead (gasoline additive).
Studies showed that blood lead levels measured in healthy
babies were above the industry standard, and individuals
living in urban areas had higher blood lead concentra￾tions than residents of rural areas (14). This knowledge
eventually led environmental protection agency (EPA) to
ban tetraethyl lead in automotive fuel. Biological moni￾toring strategies for population-based studies differ from
occupational studies. The exposure source is generally
known in the occupational but not in the general popula￾tion setting. Exposures are during work hours while the
exposure time is often unknown for nonoccupationally
exposed individuals. Work exposures are generally greater
during fixed times while the general population might
be exposed to low concentrations over longer periods. This
chapter will only include occupational biological monitoring
strategies.
This chapter will discuss biomarkers suitable for moni￾toring of occupational exposures, sampling strategy, how
policy makers assess and manage the risk of exposure to
chemicals at the workplace. This chapter will also touch
upon the ethical issues associated with biomonitoring such
as disclosure of data to whom, and with what kind of medical
consultation. In addition, different approaches for setting
biological monitoring limits will be described.
4BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
2 OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE
ASSESSMENT
The ultimate objective of an occupational exposure assess￾ment is to evaluate the health risk for workers and to
implement control measures if the risk is considered unac￾ceptable. Exposure assessment to airborne pollutants is
usually performed by measuring the concentration of the
studied contaminant preferably in the persons’ breathing
zone (personal air sampling) but sometimes area air samples
are collected.
Sampling strategies depend on the purpose such as
compliance (mandated sampling, comparing to existing
occupational exposure limits [OELs]) or extensive expo￾sure assessment (characterize the exposure intensity and
frequency variability, control measure efficiency) of more or
less all workers. Occupational hygiene sampling strategies
include sampling workers with the potential for highest
exposures, random sampling of a homogenous exposure
groups, or selection of workers for periodic exposure moni￾toring programs. In the occupational environment, strategies
for air sampling have been well defined and described in
textbooks (15, 16), publications, and standards.
Occupational hygiene assesses workplace exposure by
measuring the contaminants in the air or on the surfaces
(including skin), and whenever possible, biological moni￾toring.
2.1 Exposure Monitoring
2.1.1 Air Sampling
The air sampling strategy includes the compounds of interest
(what to sample), their OELs, their associated health effects
if workers have excessive exposure to the agents, and where
and when the compounds are used in the process. Conse￾quently, the key operations and activities are identified.
Workers that have the greatest potential for exposure to
the agents are targeted and personal air sampling for the
identified compounds are collected. Alternatively, stationary
samples are used to identify the sources of potential expo￾sures.
Concerns associated with collecting air samples are to
take a representative sample of the study population for
exposure measurements, account for all possible routes of
exposure, select the appropriate sampling methods, and char￾acterize correct exposure times. It is important to understand
the basic relationship between factors influencing exposures,
and the exposure distribution (often lognormal distribution).
This will help understand exposure variability, especially,
between- and within-worker variability, exposure correlation
in time and space (e.g. time series and spatial analysis), and
the methods inherent uncertainties.
Occupational hygienists have to select the appropriate air
sampling method for the compounds of interest. Sampling
for all agents is impractical. Different media might be
required for each agent. It is not convenient for a worker to
wear several sampling pumps at the same time. Moreover, it
could be that sampling and analytical methods do not exist
for the compound of interest. Furthermore, the substance of
interest might not be airborne. All these factors need to be
considered in the field-sampling plan.
2.1.2 Surface Sampling
Skin exposure is a topic that has been increasingly discussed
this last decade since this route of entry is quite relevant for
many chemicals. The exposure assessment for the skin route
of entry is more challenging than with airborne contami￾nants. In addition, as air concentrations become lower the
relative importance of skin exposure increases.
Skin exposures to chemicals have been evaluated using
different methods (17–20). Surface sampling methods
include wipe sampling, patch test, hand washing, and the
tape stripping method.
Wipe tests consist of wiping a determined surface area
with a material (fabrics, filters, etc.). The results are reported
as mass of contaminant (in mg or μg) per square centimeter of
the treated/body surface. For example, the amount of nicotine
contaminating tobacco harvesters’ hands at the end of shift
were determined with wipe sampling (21).
Patch tests are similar to the surface sampling except they
are attached to worker’s skin (22). Patches are sampling
mediums (fabrics, filters, etc.) placed on different parts of
the worker’s body where contact with the concerned pollu￾tant is expected. For example, chromic acid skin exposures
were measured using patches attached to the hands inside
the PPE among electroplaters (23) or polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured using patches applied
to different parts of the body in asphalt workers (24).
Hand washing is a technique applied to assess contami￾nation on hands. It consists of pouring a certain amount of
solvent (water or other suitable medium) on the contami￾nated hands while the worker is rubbing them. The hand
wash is collected in a basin underneath. This technique was
applied to assess exposure to pesticides in vineyard agri￾cultural workers after re-entry operations (maintenance and
cleaning) (25).
The tape stripping method aims to determine the amount
of a compound absorbed via skin by quantifying the
amount of the compound in the outer layer of the skin
(stratum corneum). The upper layers of the stratum corneum
(nonliving keratinized layers) are removed by adhesive tapes
successively. The total amount of compound absorbed is
calculated by adding the compound amount extracted from
the cells attached to the adhesive strips sampled from each
layer of epidermis. The tape stripping method has been
5PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
used to assess skin exposures among chimney sweepers to
PAHs (26), among workers employed in the corticosteroid
manufacturing industry to budesonide (27), and among
jet-fuel exposed workers to naphthalene (28).
No standard exists for occupational skin exposures.
Therefore, it is the company or the organization that deter￾mines its own reference values for the surface wipes (skin or
other surfaces), whole-body clothing, patch, hand wash, or
tape stripping methods used. The company needs to decide if
the surface is considered “clean” or “contaminated” (29–31).
There is no recommended strategy to derive reference values
for these sampling methods.
2.1.3 Advantages and Limitations of Environmental
Monitoring
Air sampling has several advantages over biomonitoring.
There are many more established OELs for airborne contam￾inants than biomonitoring limit values. Air monitoring can
measure peak exposures and very short exposure periods
using direct-reading instruments. Peak exposure measure￾ments are not possible with biological monitoring due to
pharmacokinetics and technical considerations.
From a legal point of view, the air quality at the work￾place is a matter of the employer’s responsibility who has
to provide a safe occupational environment for the workers.
Air sampling is not considered personal while a biolog￾ical sample is, even if it is related to the air quality at the
workplace. This is because the measured exposure quan￾tity is influenced by personal characteristics and worker’s
behavior. This includes the way the worker operates and
protects himself or herself. Biomonitoring might, therefore,
be regulated differently than air monitoring depending on the
specific country’s legislation.
The main limitation of the air sampling is that it only
allows the assessment of exposure through inhalation and
ignores other routes of entry. This may seriously affect the
risk assessment as this is often based on the total dose
reaching the target organs. Air monitoring does not take
into account the individual respiratory flow rates such as
heavy lifting that directly influence the uptake of an airborne
compound. Another limitation may be the sampling method:
for reactive compounds, adsorption on a solid phase is
often impossible and the impractical impingers (or bubblers)
remain the only solution (32). Personal air measurements
have in general more measurement error than biological
measures (33). Although it is probably more feasible and
cost-effective to minimize the bias in exposure-response
associations by collecting additional airborne measurements
than biological measurements.
Air measurements and biological monitoring are two
methods of exposure assessment that are complementary.
The choice of using air measurements or biomonitoring
depends on the sampling purpose. In occupational hygiene
practice, it is useful to start with optimizing working condi￾tions using air sampling before biomonitoring. Another
complimentary use of these methods is once biomonitoring
programs are in place but the occupational hygienist running
the program discovers that workers have elevated biomarker
values than expected, then the occupational hygienist uses air
monitoring to find the sources. Therefore, biomonitoring has
an added value to air measurements where exposure is well
managed and the occupational hygienist can use biomon￾itoring as the ultimate “stress test” to see if everything is
placed or check for expected or unexpected contributions
from skin absorption, effectiveness of PPE, and exposures
after incidents/spills.
2.2 Biological Monitoring Approach
2.2.1 From Exposure to Disease
The value of biological monitoring is that it takes into
account all routes of chemical exposure, along with personal
characteristics. Biological monitoring of exposure can be
used to target intervention and consequently, prevent the
progression from exposure to disease because it is in an early
step in the continuum of external exposure to health surveil￾lance and disease (Figure 1).
As proposed by Lauwerys and Bernard in 1985 (37),
biological monitoring of exposure to an industrial chem￾ical may be defined as the evaluation of the internal dose
(internal exposure) by a biological method with the view
of assessing the associated health risk. Depending on the
biological parameter selected and on the time of sampling,
internal dose may mean the amount of chemical recently
absorbed, the amount stored in one or several compartments
of the organism, or, under ideal conditions, the amount bound
to the sites of action. The internal dose estimation has usually
relied on two categories of tests: those based on the deter￾mination of the chemical and/or its metabolites in various
biological media (e.g. blood, urine, and alveolar air) and
those based on the quantification of a no adverse biological
effect, the intensity of which is related to the internal dose.
The scope of biomarkers has been greatly expanded
during the past decades. This is primarily because of the
great advances made in both analytical chemistry and molec￾ular biology techniques. The increased biomarker knowl￾edge has also played a significant role, particularly in the
area of cancer biomarkers and their potential for predicting
health risk in individuals and populations (38–44). For prac￾tical applications, biomarkers are generally classified into
three categories: biomarkers of exposure, biomarkers of early
biological effects, and biomarkers of susceptibility (45–48).
2.2.2 Biomarkers of Exposure
Historically, biomarkers of exposure indicators are the first
ones described and still represent the majority of biological

parameters validated and used in the assessment of occupa￾tional exposure. Generally, biomarkers of exposure give an
indication of the compound circulating in the body and/or
the amount excreted. Consequently, this is an evaluation
of intake or uptake as well as an indication of the body
burden. The compound can be the chemical itself (parent
compound), some biotransformation products (e.g. metabo￾lites), or some reaction products with macromolecules
measured in accessible biological fluids. These exposure
biomarkers may reflect the internal dose in various ways.
They can be expressed as the quantity of a product:
• Recently absorbed (solvents in the blood, in exhaled air,
etc.)
• Absorbed over a few months (metals in the blood or in
hair)
• Stored in organs and tissues (dichlorodiphenyl￾trichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) in particular)
• Present on the active site (carboxyhemoglobin,
adducts).
2.2.2.1 Biomarkers of Internal Dose Biological
monitoring of occupational exposure to chemicals started
in the early 1950s with survey programs for exposure to
metals (lead and mercury principally) measuring these
metals in blood or in urine. Biomonitoring to organic
compounds (organic solvents) came later and was mainly
the quantification of urinary metabolites of the solvents.
The validation of these biomarkers of internal dose
was the quantitative relationship between biological and
air monitoring to a particular chemical. These biological
indicators were often validated using controlled experiments
with volunteers in an exposure chamber by varying the
magnitude of exposure seeking to obtain an external–internal
relationship for the chemical of interest. Toxicokinetics of the
chemicals is often explored in these controlled human exper￾iments. The better the correlation between internal amount
and external amount, the more powerful the biomarker. This
approach is still used (49, 50). Validations are also performed
by simultaneously assessing biomarkers and personal
airborne exposure among occupationally exposed subjects.
For example, the correlation between personal air expo￾sures to styrene and styrene-(7,8)-oxide and several urinary
biomarkers were investigated among workers. Urinary
biomarkers included styrene, mandelic acid, phenylglyoxylic
acid, phenylglycine, 4-vinylphenol, the mercapturic acids
(S,R)-N-acetyl-S-(1-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine, and
(R,R)- and (S,R)-N-acetyl-S-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-
L-cysteine, and styrene-(7,8)-oxide hemoglobin and
albumin adducts). The adopted multiple sampling design
allowed for a reduced within subject variability, and very
good correlations were obtained between several urinary
biomarkers and measured personal styrene air exposures
(51, 52).
Biological monitoring helps to better understand the influ￾ence of specific exposure determinants such as wearing
protective equipment, occurrence of dermal permeation,
and influence of exposure to mixtures. If these factors
7PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
are not considered important in the occupational hygiene
strategy then air monitoring is sufficient. Biological moni￾toring may be unnecessary in these cases because it may
add variability to the alternative of air monitoring (53). Most
of the biomarkers and BLVs recommended for risk assess￾ment of exposure to toxic chemicals in the workplace are
biomarkers of internal dose (32, 54).
2.2.2.2 Biomarkers of Biologically Effective Dose
Biomarkers of biologically effective dose include the biolog￾ical indicators of an interaction between the compounds itself
or more often one active metabolite and a critical molecular
target, mainly proteins and/or DNA.
A large body of evidence demonstrates that DNA adducts
are useful markers of carcinogenic exposures. DNA adducts
are the results of carcinogen intake, metabolic activation,
and delivery to the target macromolecule in target tissues
(55). In the past, the 32P-postlabeling technique was used
to screen for DNA damage induced by genotoxic agents
(56). More robust, specific, and quantitative methods are
still being sought to identify and quantify DNA adducts.
Specifically, triple quadrupole and ion trap mass spectrom￾etry (57) have shown promise in quantifying DNA adducts,
and perhaps high-resolution and accurate-mass spectrometry
instruments will play a role in assessing global DNA damage
(58). However, the application of this approach in risk assess￾ment is limited to research studies due to the lack of standard￾ized methods and the costly and time-consuming assays.
Among protein adducts, hemoglobin and albumin adducts
are estimated to be especially useful for the exposure assess￾ment (reviewed in (59, 60)). In comparison with DNA, they
are formed in larger amounts, chemically stable, and not
prone to repair mechanisms such as DNA adducts. Because
of the long hemoglobin (120 days) and albumin (27 days)
lifespan, these aduts cumulate in the human body, making
them a very sensitive parameter adapted for the estimation of
internal exposure as well as biochemical effects. Their limi￾tations are that they are only surrogates of DNA adducts and
their capability to represent the concentration of the reactive
intermediate able to react with the target macromolecule is
mostly unknown.
Protein adducts were applied to investigate exposure to
several electrophilic or electrophilic generating chemicals,
such as benzene and styrene/styrene-(7,8)-oxide (61–63).
Recently, an adductomic approach taking advantages of
high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied to investigate
serum albumin adducts of benzene (64).
Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) is one of the most common
biomarkers of target dose. Indeed, carbon monoxide binds
rapidly to hemoglobin (Hb) leading to the decrease
of the blood capacity to carry oxygen, causing tissue
hypoxia. Besides carboxyhemoglobin, limit values for
hemoglobin adducts and/or their derivatives, are proposed,
mostly by the MAK commission, for several chemicals,
some of which are classified as carcinogenic to humans,
including acrylamide, acrylonitrile, 4-aminobiphenyl,
aniline, benzidine, 4,4′
-diaminodiphenyl-methane, dimethyl
sulfate, 1,2-epoxypropane, ethylene, ethylene oxide,
methemoglobin-forming substances, 2-naphthylamine,
and nitrobenzene (54). Furthermore, the determination of
S-methylcysteine albumin is proposed for the assessment of
exposure to methyl bromide.
Oxygen-free radicals, reactive metabolites, and peroxides
defined as reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce direct
cell injury called oxidative stress that can be the mechanism
in the pathogenesis of many diseases. ROS can react with
biological macromolecules and produce lipid peroxidation,
enzyme inactivation, and DNA damage (reviewed in (65).
8-iso-Prostaglandin F2α (8-isoprostane) is produced
by free-radical lipid peroxidation of arachidonic acid and
represents an in vivo specific marker of oxidative stress.
Lipid peroxides are unstable indicators of oxidative stress
in cells that form more complex and reactive compounds,
such as malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-trans-hexenal, and
4-hydroxy-trans-nonenal. These can form covalent adducts
with biomolecules including DNA and proteins, and thus,
are regarded as genotoxic and cytotoxic.
3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine are stable products
of peroxynitrite and hypochlorous acid, respectively, with
tyrosine residues of proteins, which may lead to functional
relationship with the neutrophilic inflammation.
Oxidative damage to DNA and RNA may be measured
using 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′
-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)
and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-guanosine. These oxidative prod￾ucts provide an extensive and growing array of potential
biomarkers, although our understanding of their status in
cells and tissues, including plasma and urine, remains to be
elucidated.
Biomarkers of oxidative stress are increasingly studied
with special emphasis on pulmonary diseases resulting
from occupational or environmental exposures to asbestos,
coal, PAH, welding fumes, nanocomposites, including
nanoparticles (66–70). Particularly, 8-OHdG in blood and
urine samples was used to assess oxidative stress to DNA
following occupational exposure to different chemicals (38,
66, 68, 71). So far, no biomarker of oxidative stress is used
for risk assessment.
Biomarkers of epigenetic modifications were recently
investigated, mostly in association with occupational and
environmental exposures to carcinogens (reviewed in (72)).
Epigenetic alterations represent nongenotoxic mechanisms
of carcinogenesis, which can alter gene activity without
change to the DNA sequence. There are several major types
of epigenetic alterations, among which DNA methylation,
histones/chromatin structure, and expression of noncoding
RNAs. It has been demonstrated that chemically induced
epigenetic alterations occur early during exposure and
may also have significance as biomarkers of carcinogen
8BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
exposure. Benzene, aflatoxins, benzo[a]pyrene, and coke
oven emissions are among the more investigated chemicals
(reviewed in (73)).
2.2.3 Biomarkers of Effects
Biomarkers of effects are measurable biochemical, physi￾ological, or other alterations within an organism that can
be recognized as associated with an established or potential
health impairment or disease (74).
One of the biomarkers of effect that has received a signif￾icant amount of discussion in recent years is the beryl￾lium blood lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT). This is a
biomarker indicating that the immune system is hyperactive
toward Be-antibodies. BeLPT test can identify subjects who
have become sensitized and, potentially, with further expo￾sure, may develop disease (75–77).
2.2.3.1 Markers of Biochemical Changes The initial
changes in enzymes and other biological substances or
responses affected by the substance are called early effects.
Biomarkers of effect are often not specific for a certain
substance. If many compounds are used in a workplace, some
biomarkers of effect can be applied to understand if a risk
exists by looking for effects that may be a result of the
mixed exposure. If one or more markers is positive, addi￾tional biomarkers of exposure or environmental monitoring
can be used to determine the substance responsible for the
effect (78). Some examples of the biomarkers of effect will
be cited or described under the specific chemical described,
but to illustrate this category of indicators, a few examples,
that are the best validated and used, are given below.
1. The inhibition of some enzymes in the hemoglobin
synthesis pathway caused by lead results in elevated
concentrations of free protoporphyrin in blood and
an inhibition of D-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase
activity in blood and/or an increased excretion of D￾aminolaevulinic acid in urine.
2. The leakage into the urine of certain proteins, such as
𝛽2-microglobulin, D-microglobulin, retinol-binding
protein, and albumin, caused by a number of metals
and solvents; in addition, inhibition of the activity
of certain enzymes in the urine (e.g. N-acetyl-D￾glycosaminidase) may occur.
3. The inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase
that may occur following exposure to a number of
organophosphate and carbamate insecticides (e.g.
parathion).
2.2.3.2 Markers of Physiological Changes The
initial biochemical changes may lead to physiological
changes. One such example is the occurrence of nega￾tive changes in higher cognitive function (e.g. learning and
memory) occurring in workers exposed to metals or solvents.
Another example is heat stress and the physiologic responses
include increases in heart rate, core body temperature, skin
temperature, and sweat production.
2.2.3.3 Markers of Cytotoxicity Cytogenetic analysis
provides a valuable technique for evaluation of damage to
chromosomes based on direct observation and classification
of chromosomes in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Among
different possibilities, CAs, MN frequencies, SCEs, and
comet assays are the most frequently used.
CAs are changes in normal chromosome number or struc￾ture that can occur following chemical exposure. Structural
CAs in peripheral blood lymphocytes, as assessed by the
CA assay, have been used for over 40 years in occupational
and environmental settings as a biomarker of early effects
from exposures to genotoxic carcinogens. A high frequency
of structural CAs in lymphocytes is predictive of increased
cancer risk. CA has been investigated in association with
several occupational exposures such as ionizing radiation
(79) and benzene (80).
Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency represents
the interchange of DNA replication products at apparently
homologous chromosomal loci. These exchanges presum￾ably involve DNA breakage and reunion. Although the mech￾anism of SCE formation is not completely elucidated, DNA
damage and DNA repair defects play an important role in
the formation of SCE (38). SCE has been widely applied as
a sensitive DNA damage indicator to evaluate the potential
risk associated with exposure to many compounds such as
pesticides (78, 81, 82), styrene (83), toluene (84, 85), arsenic
(86), PAH (87), and cytostatic drugs (88).
MNs originate from chromosome fragments or whole
chromosomes that are not included in the main daughter
nuclei during nuclear division. MN induction reflects clas￾togenic and aneugenic damage and is a predictive biomarker
of cancer risk. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN)
assay is the most extensively used method for measuring
MN in human lymphocytes. CBMN assay allows scoring,
not only MN frequency but also other genome damages, e.g.
nuclear bridge and nuclear buds, cell proliferation, and cell
death. The key advantages of the CBMN assay lie in its
ability to detect both clastogenic and aneugenic events and
to identify cells which divided once in culture. Evaluation of
the mechanistic origin of individual MN by centromere and
kinetochore identification contributes to the high sensitivity
of the method. A number of findings support the hypoth￾esis of a predictive association between the frequency of
MN in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes and cancer devel￾opment (reviewed in (89)). Showing the increase in the
number of papers published on this focus, this test seems very
promising especially in the survey of population exposed
to pesticides (90–94), metals (95, 96), formaldehyde (97),
asbestos (98) and low doses of ionizing radiation (99).
9PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
(See special review issue in Mutation Research Volume 770,
Part A, Pages 1–216 (October–December 2016)). MN in
lymphocytes could potentially be a biomarker for nanoma￾terial exposures in the future (100).
Blood is an invasive sampling matrix consequently,
methods have been developed to determine MNs in exfo￾liated buccal cells (101). This minimally invasive Buccal
micronucleus cytome (BMCyt) assay is especially useful to
understand DNA damage from inhaled genotoxic agents.
The popularity of the BMCyt is shown in the increasing
number of publications especially among workers exposed to
wood dust (102, 103), formaldehyde (104–106), metals (107,
108), and crystalline silica (109–112). A review of occupa￾tional exposure and MN frequency in buccal cells concluded
that using this tool for monitoring workers exposed to geno￾toxic agents is useful; however, data regarding exposure
(genotoxic agent amount) – response (MN frequencies) is
still lacking as exposures were in general poorly measured
in these studies (113, 114).
Recent advances in fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) and microarray technologies are modifying the nature
of cytogenetics, allowing chromosome and gene identifi￾cation on metaphase as well as in interphase. Automated
scoring by flow cytometry and/or image analysis greatly
enhanced their applicability.
The measurement of DNA strand breaks by the comet
assay in human lymphocytes has become more and more
investigated (38). The comet assay or SCGE (single cell gel
electrophoresis assay) is a sensitive method of studying DNA
damage and repair (115). Usually, lymphocytes are prepared
from venous blood. A cell suspension is then embedded
in agarose on a microscope slide and lysed to liberate the
DNA. During the electrophoresis under alkaline conditions,
the DNA fragments migrate to the anode side. The slides are
stained with a DNA binding dye. Cells with increased DNA
damage display increased migration of DNA fragments from
the nucleus toward the anode, which resembles the shape of
a comet. A suggestion for a standard protocol of the alkaline
comet assay has been published recently in view to improve
the predictive value of this assay to assess individual risk of
disease (116, 117).
2.2.4 Biomarkers of Individual Susceptibility
Biomarkers of susceptibility are parameters that describe
how variability of genetic and constitutional factors may
modulate the individual risk developing an adverse effect in
association with exposure to a toxicant. Often, susceptibility
results from differing rates of enzyme involved in the acti￾vation of chemicals (Phase-I enzymes) or mainly in detoxi￾fication of chemicals by conjugating them with glutathione,
glucuronide or sulfate to produce hydrophilic forms that are
readily excreted (Phase-II enzymes). Genetic differences in
the regulation, expression, and activity of metabolic genes
might be crucial factors in defining individual susceptibility,
as well as in determining the toxic potential of chemicals.
From the point of view of occupational medicine (74), these
genetic polymorphisms may affect the toxicity of industrial
and workplace chemicals and have a considerable influence
on biological monitoring strategies and on human risk assess￾ment (118–124) as illustrated in the following examples:
1. People with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi￾ciency have more fragile red cells than those with
average human levels. They are thus more likely than
the average person to develop anemia following expo￾sure to oxidative insults (ROS) (125).
2. People with decreased concentrations of α-1-
antitrypsin are more at risk than others of developing
emphysema. This protease inhibitor protects the
connective tissue of the lung from damage by the
proteases that increase in activity when the lung
becomes inflamed after exposure to toxicants such as
dusts, cigarette smoke, and isocyanates (126, 127).
Thus, low α-1-antitrypsin in blood is a biomarker of
susceptibility to substances that may damage the lungs
(128).
3. Two distinct N-acetyl transferase (NAT) enzymes,
NAT1 and NAT2, play important roles in the bioac￾tivation and detoxification of certain aromatic and
heterocyclic amines. Genes encoding NAT1 and
NAT2 are highly polymorphic among human popu￾lations, and these polymorphisms result in rapid or
slow acetylator phenotypes. Several studies have
suggested that variant alleles leading to slow acety￾lation by the NAT2 enzyme or rapid acetylation by
the NAT1 enzyme constitute possible risk factors for
bladder cancer (129–131). Adding to the complexity
is that some aromatic amines are affected such
as 4-aminobiphenyl, while others are not such as
benzidine.
4. The glutathione S-transferase theta 1 gene (GSTT1)
is a particularly attractive candidate for lung cancer
susceptibility because of its involvement in the
metabolism of PAHs found in tobacco smoke and of
other chemicals, pesticides, and industrial solvents
(132).
5. The polymorphism in the cytochrome P-450 isozymes
might be crucial factors in defining the susceptibility,
as well as in determining the toxicity of industrial
products such as major solvents and monomers for
plastics (133, 134).
Population frequencies of many polymorphic genes of
pharmacogenetic interest depend on racial or ethnic charac￾teristics (135). With current biological techniques and rapid
development of molecular biology approaches, identification
10BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
of genetic polymorphism and screening of workers is not
difficult. The most critical challenge; however, is to estab￾lish the ethical conditions to identify susceptible cases in the
respect of the individual and with the objective of prevention
and protection (see Section 3.4.3).
3 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING
STRATEGY
3.1 Toxicokinetics
Biological monitoring of occupational exposure is a func￾tion of time, exposure, and individuals. The first aspect is
illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the behavior of two
different biomarkers under various exposure scenarios, that
is, constant exposure (Figure 2a), constant occupational
exposure (Figure 2b), and varying occupational exposure
(Figure 2c). It is evident that biological levels change over
time, and that half-life (5 and 50 hours) is a major determi￾nant. In fact, toxicokinetic plays a key role in the relation￾ships between exposure level, time, and biological levels.
It is, therefore, important to have some knowledge in this
context in order to use biomarkers of exposure. The same
is also true for biomarkers of effects, although their kinetics
is much less understood compared to chemicals and their
metabolites.
3.1.1 Rate Constant and Half-Life
At low exposure concentrations, the absorption, distribution,
and elimination of xenobiotics can be considered as linear.
In these conditions, elimination can be characterized by an
overall first-order rate constant K, that is, in fact, the sum of ki
constants corresponding to individual elimination processes
(renal, biliary, metabolic). Rate constants are proportionality
coefficients between excretion rate (𝛿C/𝛿t) and concentration
(C) of chemical in the compartment. In a one-compartment
system:
𝛿C
𝛿t = KC
It is often easier to formalize elimination rate in terms
of the half-life t1/2. This is the time the chemical takes to
reduce the concentration in the compartment by half (or in

other words by a factor of 2). It can be calculated from K by:
t1∕2 = ln 2
K
K can be determined by observation of the decrease in
biomarker concentrations over time for one-compartment
behavior. This is an important parameter of a biomarker when
planning a biological monitoring program. It is notably a key
determinant of sampling time.
An apparent first-order rate constant (and its corre￾sponding half-life) for multi-compartment systems can
usually be defined at a given post-exposure time range. It
is used to obtain experimentally the sampling time for the
biomarker. This rate constant is, of course, somewhat depen￾dent on the exposure regimen among others, but its order of
magnitude is useful to discuss for the sampling strategy.
Table 1 gives examples of half-lives observed for
biological indicators of some occupational toxicants and the
consequent sampling time.

12BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
3.1.2 Clearance and Volume of Distribution
Clearance (Cl) is the measurement of the volume of plasma
from which a substance is completely removed per unit time
(e.g. ml min−1) or the flow rate of blood totally cleared of a
chemical compound. This can be in a given organ or group of
organs, or in the organism as a whole. The total body clear￾ance will be equal to the renal clearance + hepatic clearance
+ lung clearance. Clearance is a function of the kidney’s
ability to filter the specific compound; glomerular filtration,
secretion from the peritubular capillaries to the nephron, and
reabsorption from the nephron back to blood. The clearance
is often simply considered as the renal excretion. Associ￾ated with the volume of distribution (Vd) of the chemical
it permits to calculate the elimination rate constant k or the
fraction of a chemical compound that is removed per unit
time.
k = Cl
Vd
3.1.3 Saturable Kinetics
Toxicokinetics of chemicals of occupational interest can be
considered linear in concentration ranges encountered in
the workplace in most cases. In some situations, saturation
in the kinetics can occur because of limited availability of
necessary biological sites. Typically, this involves metabolic
enzymes, protein binding, renal tubular secretion, or biliary
secretion. These saturation processes can be exacerbated
in some cases because of simultaneous exposure to other
chemicals, medications, or drugs.
The kinetics of these capacity-limited systems is often
described by the Michaelis–Menten equation
−𝜕C
𝜕t = Vm
C
Km + C
where (−𝛿C/𝛿t) is the rate of elimination of a chemical, C is
the chemical concentration, Vm is the maximum rate of the
process, and Km is the Michaelis–Menten constant.
In biological monitoring of exposure, an example
of product for which saturation can occur is
dimethylacetamide (DMAC) that is metabolized to
S-(acetamidomethyl)mercapturic acid (AMMA) and
monomethylacetamide (MMAC) through a saturable process
(136) (Figure 3).
3.1.4 Modeling ADME (Absorption, Distribution,
Metabolism, and Excretion)
Mathematical models have been developed to quantitatively
describe the kinetic behavior of a biomarker (138). The
simplest model is a one-compartment model and requires

exposures lower than 5 ppm. MMAC excretion levels off at higher
exposures and is no longer suitable for exposure monitoring. The

only a limited number of parameters. The model complexity
increases with the number of required compartments added
(two compartments, multi-compartments). The kinetic
model describes the flow into and out of a central compart￾ment. Adding physiological and metabolic parameters
to the kinetic model will give a physiologically based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model (139).
The simple one-compartment model describes how the
chemical concentration varies over time (𝛿C/𝛿t). The chem￾ical concentration depends on absorption given the initial
chemical concentration Cexpo (rate constant ka) and elim￾ination (rate constant ke) of the adsorbed chemical given
the chemical concentration C at that time. Both processes;
absorption and elimination, are considered first-order, and
can be expressed mathematically as
𝜕C
𝜕t = kaCexpo − keC
In a two-compartment model, additional compart￾ments are added such as a peripheral compartment or
storage compartment. The chemical concentration Cp in
these compartments needs to be added, which depends on
the transfer rate constants into (kcp) and out of (kpc) the

compartments. These transfer rates describe the exchange

𝜕t = kcpC − kpcCp
The two-compartment model equation is
𝜕C
𝜕t = kaCexpo − keC − kcpC + kpcCp
Figure 4 presents an example of a two-compartment
model. The parent compound is absorbed into the central
compartment, where it is excreted or distributed into a
peripheral compartment. Here, it either flows back to the
central compartment or is excreted. The parent chemical can
flow from the central compartment and undergo metabolism.
Metabolic transformations are separate compartments
with their own rates. The metabolites can be produced in
parallel or sequentially before they are excreted. Phys￾iological and metabolic rates are model constants. This
model can be considered as a simplified PBPK model.
PBPK models can be used to understand the influence indi￾vidual biological variability has on the exposure biomarkers
(140–143).
Numerous validated PBPK models exist for certain
chemicals (144–148). PBPK models have been used in risk
assessment to extrapolate from animal to man, and between
specific exposure scenarios. The mathematical expressions
become quite elaborate as compartments are added. PBPK
software can be used to build PBPK models. The PBPK
software often has available kinetic data from the scien￾tific literature integrated into the model structure such as
physiological (air and blood flows, tissue volumes), physico￾chemical (tissue affinity, membrane transport mechanisms),
and metabolic (clearance, Michaelis–Menten constants)
data. PBPK models can be used to describe individual
biological variability as mentioned already, but also to
simulate different exposure scenarios (time, concentration,
physical workload) (49, 50, 140, 149–153). There is a
renewed surge of interest in the application of PBPK models
by the regulatory agencies, especially in setting health-based
tolerable intake or OELs.
3.2 Sources of Biomonitoring Variability
As shown in Figure 2, biological levels vary over time for
a given worker, normally called intra-worker variability.
This is, of course, also the case when considering different
workers or so-called inter-worker variability. Consequently,
an important characteristic of repeated biomarker measure￾ments is variability. This variability can have several origins:
analytical variability, biological variability (both inter￾and intra-worker), and environmental variability (also
inter- and intra-worker) (154). Analytical variability is
usually managed and reduced by appropriate quality control
programs and will not be addressed here.
3.2.1 Biological Variability
Absorption variability depends on the route of entry. Respi￾ratory adsorption is mainly affected by the solubility of the
chemical in the blood and interaction with the surface of the
respiratory airways. Pulmonary ventilation will also play a
role especially during heavy work. For example, solubility in
blood varies from person to person and within a single indi￾vidual, according to food intake and diet. These factors can
thus modify the chemical concentrations in blood and breath.
Skin absorption depends on the exposed area, the condition
of the skin, and the humidity and temperature of the work￾place. Gastrointestinal absorption depends on the stomach
content.
Distribution of the chemicals in the body is primarily
dependent on body size and composition. For example,
lipid-soluble chemicals are distributed differently in slim
and obese people. The extent of binding to macromolecules
determines the amount of free chemical available for distri￾bution and elimination. Binding varies between workers
according to differences in protein concentrations. It can
be altered in the presence of other chemicals or drugs
competing for the same binding sites. Protein binding is
usually capacity limited, therefore, in this case the behavior
of biomarkers can show nonlinearities. Cadmium binding to
metalloprotein in kidneys is an example of such a saturation
(155, 156).
Metabolism is probably the most important source of
biological variability. Genetic factors are known to play
an important role in the metabolism of several chemicals.
14BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
Environmental factors also alter the ability to metabo￾lize chemicals, both within an individual and between
individuals. Metabolizing enzymes can be induced by
smoking, medication, and absorption of other chem￾icals present in the environment or diet. Induction is
usually a result of continuous or repetitive low expo￾sure.
Simultaneous absorption of chemicals in relatively high
doses, as in alcohol consumption, drug intake, or simulta￾neous occupational exposure to other chemicals can slow
down the metabolism by inhibition (usually competitive) of
the enzymatic systems. The rate of metabolism also depends
on the rate at which the chemical is brought to the enzymatic
system. Consequently, blood flow and protein binding can
in some cases, induce a significant variability between and
within individuals.
For chemicals and metabolites excreted via the lungs, the
same parameters as for absorption play a role: pulmonary
ventilation and cardiac output. Pulmonary ventilation will
increase excretion with exhaled breath. Cardiac output can
reduce the internal dose by bringing the chemical to the lung
for lung excretion.
Renal excretion is the net result of three mechanisms:
glomerular filtration, tubular secretion, and tubular reab￾sorption. Protein binding slows down excretion of chemi￾cals and their metabolites excreted by glomerular filtration
alone. For some chemicals (Cd, Cr), saturation of binding
sites in the kidneys can greatly enhance urinary excretion.
Tubular reabsorption of weak electrolytes is conditioned
by urine pH, which changes their availability for reabsorp￾tion. The rate of fluid filtration is also of great importance
since it changes the final concentration of the biomarker in
urine. The effect of diuresis is partly reduced by relating
the biomarker concentration, to urinary creatinine concen￾tration or specific gravity. Finally, fecal excretion is only
important for large molecular weight chemicals. This excre￾tion pathway will not influence most biomarkers of exposure
significantly.
These sources of variability will influence biological
monitoring and make their interpretation challenging in
certain cases. It must, however, be stressed that the objective
is not to reduce variability but to explain it in a toxicological
context (149, 157, 34).
3.2.2 Environmental Variability
Occupational exposures are known to vary, not only between
workers but also for a given worker from day to day. Expo￾sures vary within a work shift, depending on work processes
and worker activities. Lognormal distributions are usually
considered to describe these fluctuations. The effect this
exposure variability has on the biological levels for a given
worker depends on the kinetic behavior of the chemical in
the body (33, 158, 159).
3.3 Consequences of Variability on the
Strategy
Biological monitoring is affected by biological variability
in factors such as physical workload, skin absorption, a
chemical’s partition coefficient, and individual anatomical,
physiological, and biochemical differences determining the
chemical’s pharmacokinetics (160, 161). Biologically based
mathematical modeling techniques can help in quantita￾tively accounting for and explaining the underlying biolog￾ical variability of a biomarker. Consequently, these variabil￾ities must be considered in the strategy for the biological
monitoring program. For instance, the within worker vari￾ability is considered much smaller than between workers’
variability and is simply neglected in calculations.
The most important implication of half-life for biolog￾ical monitoring is in the selection of the sampling time.
Many biomarkers of exposure have absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination kinetics following a multi￾compartment behavior. Route of absorption will affect
sampling time as skin absorption is often slower compared
to uptake via the lungs from inhalation. Elimination might
be later for workers with skin exposures. Sampling times
for metabolites is usually later than if the parent compound
is the biomarker because of the extra metabolism step.
Elimination by exhaling the substance is very rapid while
urinary elimination is slower. Sampling time should repre￾sent day or long-term average exposures. Biomarkers with
a biological limit value has a specified sampling time while
other biomarkers do not necessarily have a set sampling
time.
For example, methyl chloroform or 1,1,1-trichloroethane
[CAS no 71-55-6] is used as a solvent, a degreasing agent,
and an intermediate in industry. Three biomarkers of expo￾sure in urine or breath are available for determining expo￾sures to methyl chloroform. These exposure biomarkers are
described below and shown in Figure 5:
1. Methyl chloroform is excreted almost entirely
unchanged through the lungs and the elimination
process appears to be triphasic with half-lives 1, 5,
and 32 hours. The mixed exhaled air concentration
after exposure closely follows the venous blood
concentrations. Methyl chloroform concentrations
measured in exhaled air prior to shift are indicators
of integrated exposures on the previous days. It is
recommended to sample exhaled breath prior to last
shift of workweek.
2. Trichloroethanol (TCOH) is produced by oxidation
from a small fraction of methyl chloroform. Urinary
excretion of TCOH accounts for 2–5% of total methyl
chloroform uptake. TCAA concentrations in urine are
indicators of integrated exposures on the monitoring

day and previous days. It is recommended to sample at
the end of the workweek.
3. Trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) is produced by oxida￾tion of TCOH. Urinary excretion of TCAA accounts
for 1–2% of total methyl chloroform uptake. TCOH
concentrations in blood and urine are indicators of
recent exposure. It is recommended to sample at the
end of the workweek.
Both TCOH and TCAA represent only a small fraction of
the uptake and are highly variable, therefore, methyl chloro￾form in exhaled breath is the best indicator of exposure. It is
recommended to sample prior to last shift of the workweek.
This time is chosen in order to be in a time where the half￾life is large enough to make the biomarker representative of
chronic exposure time (Figure 6).
The variability observed in biological monitoring results
for a given worker is the combination of biological vari￾ability (intra) and environmental variability (day-to-day). At
a given sampling time, biological monitoring results would
indicate a large variability if repeated sampling was collected
for the same worker (33, 163). This is apparent in Figure 2.
Biomarkers with short half-lives closely follow the environ￾mental concentration and therefore have a larger variability.
On the contrary, biomarkers with a long biological half-life
fluctuate very little. Biomarkers with a short half-life tend to
indicate recent exposures while biomarkers with long half￾life integrate exposures over an extended time period.
The number of samples needed to make inferences about
a worker population depends on the half-life, the biological
variability, and the environmental variability. Air monitoring
is largely affected by day-to-day variability in exposure and
the estimation of the long-term average exposure with confi￾dence often requires a large number of samples (164). Using
biomarkers with a long half-life in biological monitoring can
average these day-to-day fluctuations; however, biological
variability induces fluctuations independently of exposure
changes. In a simple model, Droz and Wu (165) illustrated
the number of samples required to test whether the expo￾sure is below a given value (for example a biological limit
value). Comparative results for sampling sizes necessary for
air and biological monitoring are shown in Figure 6. The
air monitoring values are shown as a horizontal dotted line,
which are independent of the biological half-life. Four sets
of exposure variables were considered for the input in the
model. The number of biological samples required increased
with increasing levels of biological variations or the coef￾ficient of variability (CV). An average value with a CV of
0.3, and two extreme values of 0.1 and 0.9 representing an
estimated 95% range for the individual variability are shown
in Figure 6. The longer the half-life and the smaller the
individual variability, the more reliable is the estimate for
long-term average exposure. This model is only applicable to
stationary exposures meaning when exposures do not change
over time. The model illustrates that biological half-life and
biological variability impacts the number of samples neces￾sary to obtain a robust value for average exposures. There
is a clear advantage of biological monitoring over air moni￾toring for chemicals with long half-lives. When biological
variability is suspected of being linked to health effects,
then the above discussion should also include toxicological
considerations. There could, therefore, be cases where the
indicator with the most residual variability might be a better
choice.

3.4 Reference Values for Biological
Determinants
Already in the nineteenth century, the presence of solvents
and their metabolites, as well as the presence of metals, was
observed in the urine and blood of individuals exposed to
certain industrial pollutants. However, it was not until 1980
that biological monitoring was recognized as a powerful
tool for occupational hygiene, and that reference values for
biological monitoring of occupational exposure were estab￾lished and used to protect workers’ health.
3.4.1 History and Concepts of Reference Values
Following is a brief history of biological monitoring and
reference values of biomarkers for occupational exposure
to industrial chemicals in the United States, Europe, partic￾ularly Germany, France, Finland, and Japan. These coun￾tries were selected because of the crucial differences in their
concepts of reference values. Although the concept of refer￾ence values varies from country to country, the values are in
the same order of magnitude.
Biomonitoring values are often derived within the legal
framework of the country. The derivation of these values is, in
general, based on the correlation between the air concentra￾tion and the biomarker concentration. High correlation signi￾fies that inhalation is the primary route of entry, while low
correlation indicates other routes of exposure. Biomonitoring
where correlation coefficients were high, have little added
value to air sampling, while moderate to low correlations
with air sampling results signify other routes of entry. This
especially where biomonitoring is interesting as it takes into
account bioavailability and bioactivation and reflects internal
dose.
3.4.1.1 The United States The initiative in promul￾gating reference values for biomarkers was taken by the
professional organization ACGIH. The need for BLVs for
industrial exposure was first published by ACGIH in its
Threshold Limit Value (TLV) booklet in 1973 (ACGIH
1973), but no action was taken to recommend any refer￾ence value until 1982, when ACGIH established the Biolog￾ical Exposure Indices Committee (BEIC). That Committee
recommended the first biological exposure indices (BEIs) for
six pollutants, which were published in the 1984–1985 TLV/
BEI Booklet (ACGIH 1985), and the BEI list has since then
been updated and new biomarkers added to it regularly. The
2018 TLV/BEI Booklet (ACGIH 2018) has a BEI recom￾mendation for biomarkers for 51 industrial pollutants (see
Table 2). ACGIH also publishes a series of documentations
that explain the basis for each BEI. The documentations are
updated from time to time and new BEIs are added, updated
BEIs are delated or modified (usually lowered) as new infor￾mation is available.

36BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
BEIs are intended to be guidelines for the evaluation
of potential health hazards in the practice of occupational
hygiene. BEIs do not indicate a sharp distinction between
hazardous and nonhazardous exposures. They are meant
to be used for group evaluation rather than for evaluation
of individuals, unless the individual is monitored regularly.
They are the biological levels of biomarkers that would most
likely be reached during occupational inhalation exposure to
the TLV, that is, mean values that most likely result from
inhalation exposures of eight hours a day five days a week,
where it is sure that inhalation is the only route of entry.
The BEI and TLV Committees work together to make
BEIs and TLVs compatible. The toxicokinetics provides a
powerful tool to achieve this goal (137, 166, 167). This
means that, assuming only inhalation exposure, the BEI and
its corresponding TLV provide the same protection against
systemic adverse effects. Biological monitoring provides
earlier warning than air monitoring if skin exposures are
likely. Repetitive measurements surpassing the BEI should
be taken seriously even if the TLV is not exceeded. The same
holds true if ingestion occurs in case of exposure to contam￾inants in the solid or liquid phase (dust, mist) (168, 169). In
both cases, biological monitoring represents a better way to
assess the occupational exposure.
Irreversible biochemical and functional changes are
not recommended by ACGIH as biomarkers, because the
abnormal values associated with such changes indicate a
health injury that should be prevented before they occur.
About the time the first reference values were recom￾mended by ACGIH, the governmental agency National Insti￾tute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) began
promoting biological monitoring and published their recom￾mendations in 1986. NIOSH’s objectives are implementa￾tion of biological monitoring in risk assessment, environ￾mental control, and the validation of biological monitoring
in epidemiological studies.
NIOSH has drafted a new chapter entitled “Application
of Biological Monitoring Methods for Chemical Exposures
in Occupational Health” for publication in the NIOSH
Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) (https://www.cdc
.gov/niosh/docket/review/docket301/pdfs/Revised-DART￾NMAM-Biomonitoring-watermark-9-27-17.pdf). NMAM
was first published in 1974. Currently, in its Fifth Edition,
the NMAM contains over 60 methods and 11 chapters
that can be utilized by the occupational safety and health
community to measure worker exposures.
3.4.1.2 European Union Biological monitoring of
occupational exposure has been practiced in Europe since
World War II in a number of European countries, most
actively in Czechoslovakia, Finland, Italy, Poland, and
Sweden. International meetings have been over the years
organized to share views and experiences on biological
monitoring. The European Community Commission (ECC)
began promoting biological monitoring of environmental
and occupational exposures in 1983 with its initial publi￾cation of a series of documentations on the toxicity and
biological monitoring of seven industrial pollutants (https://
core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16513926.pdf). The series, origi￾nally entitled “Human Biological Monitoring of Industrial
Chemicals Series,” was renamed in 1984 to “Biological
Indicators For Assessment of Human Exposure to Industrial
Chemicals”. In 1999, it included six volumes containing
information on biological monitoring of 40 pollutants
(170–175). At that time, the ECC did not recommend any
reference values but provided scientific bases on which each
country could determine its own reference values (176). In
1995, the Scientific Committee on occupational exposure
limits (SCOEL) of the EU was established by the European
Commission. SCOEL was composed of experts delegated
by member countries, and many of them belong to their
National Committees. This favored the construction of a
coherent and harmonized approach for setting BLVs. The
methodology to develop propositions and recommendations
of health-based OELs and BLVs has been published and
is periodically revised (177) (online documents from the
European Commission https://circabc.europa.eu/faces/jsp/
extension/wai/navigation/container.jsp accessed 31 October
2018). The methodology is approved by the member states
and the employers and employees organizations. The
SCOEL advised the European Commission on OELs and
presented their recommendations with the critical studies
on which the recommendation was based (178). The EU
Directorate-General (DG) for Employment, Social Affairs,
and Equal Opportunities establishes OELs. EU Member
States are obliged to implement national standards for all
substances for which an OEL has been established. The
proposed OELs and BLVs are based on the best avail￾able scientific evidence of potential health effects for the
considered pollutant. The recommended BLVs may be
health-based or biological guidance values (BGVs).
BLVs are reference values used for evaluating poten￾tial health risks in the practice of occupational health. Due
to biological variability, an individual’s measurement may
exceed the BLV without incurring an increased health risk.
If, however, the biological levels persistently exceed the BLV,
or if the majority of measurements obtained from a group of
workers at the same workplace exceed the BLV, the cause of
the excessive values must be investigated and proper action
taken to reduce the exposure. Exposures equal to the BLV
generally do not affect the health adversely, when attained
regularly under workplace conditions, except in cases of
hypersensitivity. BLVs are the corresponding concentration
of a biomarker likely observed in specimens collected from
a worker exposed to the chemical in question at the OEL
and exclusively by inhalation. BLVs were also developed for
OELs that serve as protection against nonsystemic effects
37PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
(e.g. irritation or respiratory disorders) or for substances with
other routes of absorption, in particular the skin.
BGVs are established where insufficient toxicological
data exist and cannot support a health-based BLV. BGVs
represent the upper concentration of the substance or a
metabolite of the substance in any appropriate biological
medium corresponding to a certain percentile (generally 90
or 95 percentile) in a defined reference population. The BGV
may be equivalent to the detection limit of the biomoni￾toring method if background levels cannot be determined.
The rational for the BGVs are specified in the SCOEL docu￾ments. A value exceeding the BGV might help in identifying
the need for an expert exposure evaluation of the working
conditions.
In 2014 (179), the European Commission published
the list of BLVs and BGVs, with 22 chemicals, including
5 metals or metal-containing substances (from
cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel), 16 organic chem￾ical or mixture, and hydrogen fluoride, fluoride and its
inorganic salts (http://ec.europa.eu/social/keyDocuments
.jsp?type=0&policyArea=82&subCategory=153&
country=0&year=0&advSearchKey=recommendation&
mode=advancedSubmit&langId=en accessed 31 October
2018).
3.4.1.2.1 Germany The Commission for the Investiga￾tion of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the
Work Area is known as the MAK Commission (issued
from the German Research Association DFG). This commis￾sion provides scientific advice to the DFG Senate, federal
and state governments, parliaments and public authorities
on health protection issues in connection with exposure to
hazardous substances, particularly in the workplace.
In 1979, the MAK commission established a working
group on derivation of threshold values in biological
materials. The Commission published the first biolog￾ical tolerance value (BAT) in 1981 (75) and has since
updated and added new or corrected values each year.
Since 2012, the evaluations have also been available
online. Biological values include biological tolerance values
(Biologische Arbeitsstoff-Toleranzwerte or BAT), BGV
(Biologische Leit-Werte or BLW), biological reference
values for workplace substances (BAR), and exposure
equivalents for carcinogenic substances (Exposition￾säquivalente für krebserzeugende Arbeitsstoffe or EKA)
(available at: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10
.1002/9783527812127).
In Germany, biomonitoring is part of a preventive occu￾pational health care. The Commission establishes BATs and
BLWs to enable a health risk evaluation for an individual
originating from exposures to substances at work. BAT
values are intended to protect employees from impairment
of health at work. They provide a basis for deciding whether
a workers internal dose may be harmful or not.
The BAT value describes the occupational-medical and
toxicological derived concentration for a substance, its
metabolites, adducts, or an effect parameter in the corre￾sponding biological material at which worker’s health is not
adversely affected when the individual is repeatedly exposed
during long periods. BAT values are based on a relationship
between external and internal exposure or between the
internal exposure and the resulting effect of the substance.
The BAT value is considered exceeded when the average
concentration of the biomarker is greater than the BAT value
in several individual examinations. Exceed BAT values
prompts an occupational-medical and toxicological data
evaluation for the worker. Adverse effects on health cannot
necessarily be deduced from one single observation above
the BAT value. This is not valid for acute toxicity, which is
not be permitted at any time.
BLWs are derived for carcinogenic substances and for
substances without sufficient data.
Chemical substances known or suspected to cause cancer
in man are not given BAT values because it is not possible
to specify safe levels for such substances in biological mate￾rials. These substances are, therefore, analyzed for the detec￾tion and quantification of an individual’s exposure. For this
purpose, the relationships between the concentration of the
carcinogen in the workplace air and of the substance or its
metabolites in biological material are investigated, and the
exposure equivalents for carcinogenic substances or EKA are
derived.
BARs are biological reference values, i.e. describe the
background level of a substance present at the same time in
a reference population of working age who are not occupa￾tionally exposed to this substance. The BARs are based on
the 95th percentile disregarding effects on health.
The full list of DFG biological values (2017), including
EKA, has been reported in Table 2.
The MAK Commission established a working group for
analytical chemistry. This working group develops, verifies,
and publishes analytical methods for the identification of
hazardous substances at the workplace, their metabolites,
or characteristic parameters of intermediary metabolism in
human biological material. The analytical methods devel￾oped and validated by the working group are published,
at regular intervals. Since 1985 over 200 analytically reli￾able and verified methods have been published in English as
Analyses of Hazardous Substances in Biological Materials;
and from 2005, under the title “The MAK Collection Part
IV Biomonitoring Methods”. Since 2012, the methods have
also been available online (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/book/10.1002/3527600418).
3.4.1.2.2 France In France, the Ministry of Labor
determines the list of substances to be evaluated. The
BLVs or Indicateurs Biologiques d’Exposition (IBEs) are
issued by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and
38BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES). A working group
made up of selected scientific members to develop IBEs send
their recommendations to the committee developing OELs.
The OEL committee has to approve the IBE documents
produced. Once adopted, the IBE document is sent for a
two-month public consultations and comments addressed
before final publication by ANSES. The IBE is the concen￾tration of a biomarker that should not to be exceeded in
workers. The IBE work group conducts a thorough literature
search to identify all potential biomarkers and examine their
relationships with health effects and air concentrations of
the parent compound. The best biomarker is then selected.
If a relationship between a biomarker and a critical effect
exists, an IBE based on health effects is developed. If no
such relationship exists, a search for a possible relationship
between a biomarker and exposure to the parent compound
is conducted. If found, then an IBE based on exposure
can be developed. If a relationship between a biomarker
and exposure does not exist, then no IBE is developed.
Instead, a pragmatic IBE is developed, which serves to
limit exposure to substances in the workplace. It does
not mean, however, that no health effects are associated
with exposure to the chemical. The IBE workgroup also
develops biological reference values (BRVs). The BRV is
the 95th percentile concentration of a biomarker observed in
a nonoccupationally exposed adult population.
3.4.1.2.3 Finland The Finish Ministry of Social Affairs
and Health’s Decree on Concentrations Known to be
Harmful (1214/2016: http://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/
handle/10024/79109) have issued a list of 16 indicative and
one binding (B-Pb) BLVs for chemical agents. Additionally,
the Finnish Institute for Occupational Health (FIOH) recom￾mends reference values and biological action limit values
for additional chemicals. Reference values and biological
action limit values recommended by FIOH are published
online (www.ttl.fi/biomonitorointi, under Analyysit ja
näytteenotto-ohjeet).
3.4.1.3 Japan In 1986, Japan established a Society
for Research of Biological Monitoring to develop reli￾able analytical methods, establish reference values, and
implement and promote biological monitoring. Since
1993, the Japanese Society for Occupational Health has
promoted OELs for mercury, later adding lead, hexane,
and 4,4′
-methylenebis-(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA). In
1989, the Ministry of Labor began promoting biological
monitoring and accepted reference values recommended
by the Society for Occupational Health as guidelines for
monitoring exposures to lead and eight solvents. In 2017,
Japan Society for Occupational Health updated the OELs
and published their 2017–2018 list of OELs (180, 181).
Twenty-one chemicals have occupational limits based on
biological monitoring (OEL-B) and include four metals
and metal-containing compounds (cobalt, indium, lead, and
mercury) and 17 organic chemicals, mostly solvents. In
setting OEL-B, considerations are given to the exposure￾effect and/or exposure-response relationships between
biological monitoring values and health effects, or to the
relationship between biological monitoring values and the
corresponding airborne concentrations. It is recognized
that air concentrations of chemical substances in the work￾place will not closely be associated with OEL-B due to
various factors, such as intra- and inter-individual variation
in metabolism, social and personal habits, and working
conditions. Consequently, measured values could exceed
OEL-Bs even though exposure to the chemical substance is
below the established OEL, and vice versa. Both OEL and
OEL-B must be respected in the workplace. OEL-Bs apply
when samples are collected at the appropriate sampling time
and when workers are exposed to a single substance. For
exposure to a mixture of substances, interactions in terms of
absorption, metabolism, accumulation, excretion, and health
effects must be considered.
According to Japan’s Industrial Safety and Health Law,
the employers are responsible for the occupational health
of their workplace employees, and a physician (serving
the workplace on a full-time or part-time basis) selects
the biological monitoring program following the legal stip￾ulation. In 2017, the Ministry of Health issued a list of
32 industrial chemicals for which the occupational health
regulation in Japan stipulates the application of biological
monitoring (Handbook of Industrial Safety and Health Law,
2017). The list contains 14 metals and metal-containing
compounds (from arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, anti￾mony, indium, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and vana￾dium), 17 organic chemicals, and hydrogen fluoride. The
physician can consult the Industrial Health Organization
(IHO) when making a judgment regarding biological moni￾toring programs. More than 120 such IHOs are scattered all
over Japan and form the National Federation of Industrial
Health Organizations. At each IHO, at least one occupa￾tional health physician is present to answer related questions,
often in reference to the OEL-B list issued by the Japan
Society for Occupational Health, and perform chemical anal￾ysis. If a particular IHO cannot perform chemical analysis
by themselves, leading IHOs and independent chemical anal￾ysis laboratories (some 90 in total) can accept the request for
analysis on a commercial basis. Japan has a well-developed
quality control program for the analysis of biomarkers in
biological specimens and for the implementation of biolog￾ical monitoring on a regular basis (181).
3.4.1.4 Other Countries A comprehensive survey of
all the existing committees or boards in charge of devel￾oping biological exposure limits has not been carried out
but it is assumed that there are a large number of such
bodies throughout the world. In Russia and other countries
39PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
of Western Europe, in China and other Asiatic countries, in
Australia and New Zealand, in South Africa, in Mexico, and
in a few countries of South America there are professional
societies related to Occupational Health and most probably,
Scientific Committees are also working on OELs and BLVs.
Communication and exchange with these countries may be
difficult due to the language problem. In many cases, the
ACGIH, the German Committee, and the SCOEL values are
used as references.
3.4.2 Quality Control
Nowadays internal and external quality controls are parts of
the total quality management of biological monitoring. A
review of external quality assessment schemes (worldwide)
has been made by Angerer (38), Jakubowski (177, 182), and
Göen (183).
3.4.3 Ethical Issues
There are several significant ethical issues related to biolog￾ical monitoring. Ethical issues should be considered at the
preparation stage of any biomonitoring study. The consul￾tations with the workers are of utmost importance as is
the ethical review, followed by the quality of the study
design, and the selection of noninvasive methods (184, 185).
Respect for individuals, confidentiality, privacy, equity, fair￾ness, discrimination, autonomy, nonmaleficence, and self￾determination belongs to these ethical issues (186).
In the United States, there is great concern with infringe￾ment of confidentiality and possible abuse of information
by employers when hiring and firing workers. Therefore,
obtaining written consent from the employee is advisable.
In Europe, the protection of the individual “private
sphere” has increased during this last decade with the devel￾opment of the communication and information technology.
In many European countries, the occupational hygienists
cannot obtain biological samples such as urine to understand
exposures because medical doctors are the only ones that
can obtain biological samples. Consequently, it is perti￾nent in many countries for the occupational hygienist to
work closely with the occupational physician to obtain the
biological samples and their results. The physician and the
occupational hygienist should interpret the biomonitoring
results together.
Workers have the right to know their own results. It
is compulsory in Europe to inform the workers about the
health and safety issues related to their individual values.
These legal requirements are used to communicate with the
workers their own biological monitoring results. In Japan,
the Ministry of labor has made it mandatory for workers to
be immediately informed of their personal results (187). In
Europe, the ethical concerns vary from country to country.
The selection of workers on the basis of biomarkers of
individual susceptibility (188–192) is not allowed, and this is
probably everywhere in the world. It is unknown, however,
how this restriction is followed in different countries. The
challenge to determine what information can and should
be unveiled to workers, especially in case of exposure to
carcinogenic or mutagenic agents should not be underes￾timated. In addition, the social consequences of human
biomonitoring should also be considered (184).
4 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING
PRACTICAL APPROACH
4.1 Common Biological Monitoring Media
The choice of a biological matrix depends on the chem￾ical of interest, its persistence, and its half-life in the matrix
(193). The most common biomonitoring media are blood,
urine, and exhaled air. Biological monitoring programs are
implemented with such measurements for screening and, if
repeated at timed intervals, for monitoring either an indi￾vidual or a group.
4.1.1 Urine
Urine is generally suitable when monitoring hydrophilic
biomarkers of low molecular weight. Urine collects in the
bladder before it is voided; hence, the concentration of
biomarkers in a urine specimen represents the average excre￾tion during the interval between voids.
Sampling urine for biological monitoring has several
advantages. This noninvasive sampling method usually gives
sufficiently large samples. Urine samples often require little
clean-up before chemical analysis. The main disadvantage is
that urine output is highly variable because an individual’s
water intake and loss (e.g. sweating, diarrhea) influences the
urine volume.
4.1.1.1 Urine composition Average daily urine output in
adults is about 1.2 l (ranging between 0.6 and 2.5 l day−1)
and corresponds to a urinary flow rate of about 50 ml h−1.
A liter of urine contains about 50 g of solid metabolic
end-products and electrolytes. The average specific gravity
(density) for urine is 1.020 (ranging between 1.001 and
1.030). Urine is slightly acidic with an average pH of 6.0
(ranging between 4.6 and 8.0). Urine samples with values
beyond the ranges of the above parameters indicate abnormal
stress on renal function and are not suitable for biological
monitoring.
4.1.1.2 Renal Clearance Kidney is the main organ that
removes waste and water from the blood to form urine. The
amount the body has cleared or eliminated is the difference of
40BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
the chemical’s concentration in arterial blood (before it has
circulated around the body) and venous blood (after it has
passed through the body’s organs). The removal efficiency
of a compound from the body is measured in liters per time
unit (l h−1 or ml min−1) and called renal clearance.
4.1.1.3 Standardization of Biomarker Measure￾ments in Urine To eliminate the effect of fluctuating
urine flow rates, the urine volume and the time between
urine voids can be recorded, and the excretion rate of the
biomarker can be calculated as amount of biomarker per
unit of time. However, collecting such samples, typically
24-hour urine samples, is impractical in field conditions
and spot urine samples are generally preferred. Spot urine
samples need to be normalized to take into account the
diuresis variations that affect the biomarker concentration.
A practical solution to normalize the urine results is to relate
the excretion of the biomarker to the excretion of solids.
Such adjustment can be either specific gravity (density) or
creatinine excretion.
Specific gravity is the concentration of solids in urine
and is indirectly related to the urine flow rate (194). Specific
gravity measurement is simple using a refractometer;
however, sedimentation occurring in the urine shortly after
voiding makes the measurements in stored urine misleading.
The creatinine excretion rate in urine is more or less
constant (about 1.0–1.6 g d−1) and is independent of diet,
hydration, and diuresis. Creatinine normalization is used to
compensate for variable diuresis for those substances whose
urinary biomarker excretion kinetics parallel that of crea￾tinine, i.e. for biomarkers excreted by glomerular filtration
(such as phenols, glucuronides, and organic acids (195)).
Normalizing with creatinine is unsuitable for biomarkers
excreted by passive diffusion (tubular diffusion) or by other
means independent of an active transport mechanism, such
as for organic solvents and gases (i.e. benzene and glycol
ethers). Creatinine concentration can also be used to discrim￾inate between valid or invalid samples. Particularly, a urine
sample is considered invalid when its creatinine concentra￾tion falls outside the range 0.3–3 g l−1, because is considered
“too diluted” or “too concentrated” (195–197).
4.1.2 Blood
Blood concentration of parent compounds is the best
indicators of internal exposure. Blood is the only spec￾imen available for measurement altered enzyme activity
(i.e. cholinesterase), or macromolecular adducts, such
as those resulting from the interaction of the pollutant
with hemoglobin (i.e. methemoglobin and carboxyhe￾moglobin). Blood may also be preferred when monitoring
for some metals and chemicals poorly metabolized such as
perchloroethylene and polychlorobiphenyls. The disadvan￾tages are that blood sampling is an invasive practice, requires
specialized personnel to draw blood, and often requires a
meticulous clean-up procedure complicating the analysis.
Blood distributes the pollutant from the site of entry
(respiratory tract, skin, gastrointestinal tract) to other tissues,
including to the excretory organs. The process reverses when
the exposure ends and blood washes the pollutant and its
metabolites from tissues and carries them to the excretory
organs. A significant concentration gradient develops when
blood passes through the absorption site or through the
excretory organs. Thus, the passage of volatile pollutants
through the lungs causes a significant concentration gradient
between arterial and mixed venous blood. During exposure,
the absorption of the pollutant increases its concentration in
arterial blood. As the blood passes through the other organs,
the pollutant concentration in blood decreases due to reten￾tion of the pollutant in the tissues. As a result, the concen￾tration of the pollutant in regional venous blood is lower
than in arterial blood. Following the exposure, the pulmonary
washout and tissue washout have the opposite effect, the
concentrations in venous blood being higher than in arte￾rial blood. This difference has to be kept in mind when
sampling for biological monitoring of volatile pollutants.
Thus, concentrations of volatile biomarkers in venous blood
collected from the vena cubitalis can differ from concentra￾tions in arterial blood collected from the finger.
Skin absorption can induce local differences in biomarker
concentration. For example, if one hand is immersed in a
solvent, the concentration in blood collected from the arm
with the immersed hand can be higher than the concentration
in blood collected from the other arm (198, 199).
4.1.2.1 Blood Composition and Sampling Biomarkers
can be quantified in whole blood, cellular elements (red
cells or lymphocytes), plasma, or serum. To obtain plasma,
a tube with anticoagulant such as citrate, oxalate, EDTA,
or heparin is used for blood sampling. The choice of anti￾coagulant depends on the biomarker and on the analyt￾ical method. Some biomarkers readily cross the cellular
membranes and can be measured in plasma as well as in
red cells. For example, solvents such as benzene, toluene,
and trichloroethylene distribute evenly in blood, but their
hydrophilic metabolites do not readily cross the cellular
membranes and there is a concentration difference between
plasma and red cells.
4.1.3 Exhaled Air
Biological monitoring based on analysis of exhaled air is
limited to gases and vapors of stable, hydrophobic chemi￾cals such as carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs). Exhaled air is not suitable for biological moni￾toring of unstable pollutants that decompose upon contact
with body fluid in the respiratory tract; nor is it suitable for
41PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
monitoring of pollutants that dissolve in the mucus covering
the walls of respiratory airways.
Inter-individual differences in the metabolic rate intro￾duce variability in the concentration of the parent compounds
in blood, and consequently, affect pulmonary excretion.
Therefore, biological monitoring in exhaled air is more
informative for poorly metabolized chemicals, such as
perchloroethylene or methyl chloroform, than for moni￾toring of extensively metabolized chemicals, such as
trichloroethylene. The main advantage of monitoring in
exhaled air is the simple analysis requiring no clean-up
procedure. VOCs also appear in exhaled air also after skin
or gastrointestinal absorption (200, 201); this weakens
the correlation between the concentration of pollutants in
ambient air and in exhaled air.
4.1.3.1 Exhaled Air Composition and Sampling
Exhaled breath is a mixture of air coming from the lungs
(alveolar air) and of air held in upper respiratory airways
(dead space) (202, 203). Because stable, poorly soluble
gases and vapors are not absorbed in the upper respiratory
tract, their concentration at the beginning of exhalation (i.e.
air from respiratory airways) resembles the concentration in
the ambient air. In the alveoli, the concentrations of volatile
pollutants equilibrate with their concentration in arterial
blood. At rest, the air from the upper respiratory tract (dead
space) accounts for about one-third of the mixed-exhaled air.
The dead space increases as the respiratory rate increases
(198).
Precautions are necessary when collecting multi￾breath mixed-exhaled air samples in large glass or plastic
containers. The sampling container has to have minimal
resistance, so that the sample is taken under normal breathing
conditions. End-exhaled air samples are representative of
alveolar air. The results from monitoring solvent exposure
by breath analysis should be corrected for hyperventilation
or hypoventilation and for dilution of alveolar air with
dead space air. A proportional adjustment of the solvent
concentration at the mean normal alveolar partial pressure of
carbon dioxide, or PCO2
, is made; alternatively, samples with
a PCO2 outside normal range may simply be disregarded
(204). Exhaled air samples collected from persons with
abnormal pulmonary function are not suitable for exposure
monitoring.
4.1.4 Other Matrices
Virtually any tissue or fluid can be used for biomarkers deter￾mination. In recent years, several nonconventional matrices
have been investigated. The most promising are exhaled
breath condensate (EBC), saliva, and hair. Although inter￾esting results have been reported, the current application of
biomarkers in nonconventional specimens in occupational
health practice requires further developments.
4.1.4.1 Exhaled Breath Condensate EBC is a matrix
where biomarkers may be identified (205–209). EBC may
be either thought of as a body fluid or as a fluid formed
by cooling exhaled air. EBC has been used to study the
pathophysiology of airway diseases and to determine airway
inflammation (208, 209). EBC is a suitable matrix for
assessing the biomarkers of oxidative stress in exposed
workers (202, 203, 210, 211). It is also suitable for quan￾tifying the levels of some pneumotoxic metals in the lung
(212, 213), in particular chromium (214), cobalt, and tung￾sten (205, 215). As related in a recent review on this topic
(202, 203), these studies suggest that metals can be measured
in EBC from occupationally exposed workers with levels
that correlate with biomarkers of lung damage, such as
aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation.
4.1.4.2 Saliva The use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid is
a relatively recent trend in the occupational health studies
(216) (reviewed in (217) and (218)). The idea of using
saliva is very attractive, as it can be used as a surrogate for
blood for some biomarkers with the advantages of being
less invasive, autonomous, safe, and simple. Standardized
saliva collection uses readily available devices. Biomarkers
of stress measured in saliva are associated with both chronic
and acute stress. Chronic stress is measured by the sali￾vary cortisol. This cortisol production is associated with the
activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and by
salivary IgA and lysozyme associated with the depression of
the immune function. Acute stress is associated with acti￾vation of the sympatho-adreno-medullary system, which is
reflected by salivary chromogranin A and α-amylase (219).
Some studies suggest saliva sampling for exposure biomon￾itoring to pesticides (220–223); some heavy metals (224)
such as arsenic (225), lead (226, 227) but only for elevated
blood lead levels (228). Nevertheless, this matrix may be
interesting and many compounds present in blood or urine
can be detected in salivary samples. Their levels in saliva are
usually much lower than in blood, which required sensitive
analytical methods (229). The nonoccupational influence on
background concentrations (230, 231) and compounds’ half￾lives in saliva need to be carefully characterized before they
can be used in routine biomonitoring of exposed populations.
4.1.4.3 Hair During past decades, hair analysis has found
even broader applications in doping controls and drug abuse
studies in forensic toxicology, clinical toxicology, and clin￾ical chemistry and in evaluating environmental exposure to
toxicants (232, 233). Hair matrix can be used to gain infor￾mation on mid- or long-term exposures; considering about
1 cm of growth for month, the length of the hair lock deter￾mines the detection window. Hair samples were successfully
applied to retrospective monitoring of exposure to heavy
metals, in particular for arsenic (234–238). More recently,
several studies using hair to assess pesticide exposures have
42BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
been published (239) (reviewed in (240)). In agriculture,
where several pesticides are typically applied on crops at
different times of the growing season, hair sampled before
(pre-exposure sample) and after the season (post-exposure
sample), can be useful for the evaluation of cumulative and
aggregate exposure (238).
4.2 Time of Sampling
4.2.1 Urine
The urinary biomarker concentration rises during exposure
and is usually the highest in specimens collected at the
end of the exposure. Following exposure, the concentrations
of biomarkers decline, with elimination half-lives typically
ranging from 3 to 15 hours. For several small organic chem￾icals, urinary metabolites are indicators of recent exposure.
Due to fast decline, the sampling time of the urine void must
be carefully chosen to not miss this exposure peak and conse￾quently, underestimate a worker’s exposure. This is why the
reference values, such as American BEIs or German BATs,
usually have sampling times for the urine voids at the end of
exposure or end of work shift or prior to the next shift. The
sampling time for biomarkers with longer half-lives may be
at the end of the workweek (i.e. 1-hydroxypyrene) or discre￾tionary (e.g. metals).
4.2.2 Blood
Blood analysis determines the momentary concentration of
the biomarker at the time of the blood collection. Thus, when
collecting and analyzing blood for biological exposure moni￾toring, timing with respect to the exposure, sampling site,
and blood specimen used for the analysis is even more crit￾ical than for urine and must be carefully chosen. For most
organic chemicals, blood biomarker concentration rapidly
rises during exposure and declines following the exposure.
For biomarkers with a short half-life, the sampling time is
critical. For low metabolized solvents, such as methyl chlo￾roform and trichloroethylene, the half-life is longer. The best
sampling time for chemicals that tend to accumulate is at the
end of the workweek. This will incorporate exposures from
previous days. The sampling time for biomarkers with long
half-lives (e.g. Pb and other metals, hemoglobin adducts) is
discretionary.
4.2.3 Exhaled Air
A pollutant’s concentration in exhaled air during expo￾sures fluctuates with the concentration of the pollutant
in ambient air. At stable homogeneous exposures, the
concentration of the pollutant in exhaled air rises and
approaches the steady-state level. Biological monitoring
during exposure is unnecessary, because measurements in
breath samples provide approximately the same information
as measurements in ambient air collected in the respiratory
zone. Immediately after exposure, the pollutant concen￾tration in exhaled air declines very rapidly and it can be
too difficult to manage sampling at this time. Conversely,
exhaled air samples collected 16 hours after exposure
to solvents (prior to the next shift) are preferable, as they
contain the pollutants released from the fat and tissue depots,
and reflect the average concentration during the previous
exposure. However, these concentrations are about 100 times
lower than the concentration during exposure and require
sensitive chemical analytical methods that can quantify
such low levels. Another issue with expired air sampling is
contamination. To prevent contamination during sampling,
the samples must be collected in an uncontaminated envi￾ronment, and the worker must be instructed, and possibly
trained, in how to exhale into the sampling container.
4.3 Criteria for Selection of a Biomarker
The selection of biomarkers, biological specimens, and the
timing of sample collection depends on the purpose of the
monitoring. For confirmation of overexposure, measurement
in samples collected during or after the exposure is suitable,
provided that the biomarker still persists in the body. Samples
collected within the period of three half-lives following expo￾sure are usually timely. For retrospective verification of past
exposure(s), biomarkers with long half-lives, such as macro￾molecular adducts, are suitable.
For routine exposure monitoring such as exposure assess￾ment and risk assessment, quantitative data for biological
markers are necessary and sampling time must adhere to the
indication given with the BLVs.
In selecting a biomarker for biological monitoring, the
following factors should be considered:
• Specificity of the biomarker
• Sensitivity and background level of the biomarker
• Availability of an analytical method
• Stability of the sample and of the biomarker during
storage and transportation
4.3.1 Specificity of the Biomarker
Specificity is very important for identification of the toxic
pollutant (241). Parent compounds are usually the most
specific indicators of exposure such as urinary benzene
(242–245), although there are exceptions. For example,
carbon monoxide in exhaled air may appear to be a specific
biomarker of carbon monoxide exposure. However, it has
been shown that the solvent methylene chloride is metabo￾lized to carbon monoxide, which is then exhaled, thus both
carbon monoxide in exhaled air and carboxyhemoglobin in
43PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
blood are not specific biomarkers; of course, this is relevant
only in the case of co-exposure to both chemicals. Another
example is the sum of mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids
in urine that are biomarkers of exposure to both styrene and
ethylbenzene. Their use is recommended when only one of
the two chemicals is polluting the workplace. Metabolites are
usually less specific biomarkers than the parent compounds.
For example, trichloroacetic acid occurs in urine following
exposure to trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and methyl
choroform.
Nonspecific biomarkers may have an advantage if the
exposure to be evaluated is co-exposure to several poorly
identified pollutants that have a common biomarker related
to the same adverse effect. For example, workers in the
rubber industry are often exposed to several unidentified
pollutants with similar metabolic mechanisms. Rubber
industry pollutants can metabolize to electrophiles, which
bind to glutathione. Consequently, total thioether concen￾trations have been suggested as a biomarker for evaluating
exposures to these co-exposures (246). Another example is
the nonspecific biomarker, acetylcholinesterase inhibition
in erythrocytes, used as a screening test among agricultural
workers exposed to mixtures of organophosphate pesticides.
Similarly, methemoglobin in blood is a suitable biomarker
for exposure to several amines and nitrocompounds that are
readily absorbed through the skin.
Metals measured in blood or urine are biomarkers
for evaluating exposures to that metal. However, some
metals may have different forms/oxidation status affecting
their toxicological properties. Therefore, when choosing a
biomarker and its acceptable biological level these differ￾ences have to be kept in mind; consequently, also the
analytical method must be carefully chosen. For example,
organic and inorganic mercury have different sources of
exposure, different toxicological properties, and different
BLVs, and need to be assessed using different analytical
methods.
4.3.2 Sensitivity and Background Levels
The biomarker must be present in the biological specimen
in a measurable amount. This depends not only on the avail￾ability of a sensitive analytical method; it also depends on
whether the biological level of the biomarker induced by
the pollutant differs from its level in the general popu￾lation. Deviation of the biological level of the biomarker
induced by permissible exposure to the pollutant must be
outside the range of its levels in the general population.
Occupational exposures are decreasing in the industrial￾ized world. Consequently, the worker population levels are
approaching the wide range of exposures observed in the
general population. The strength of biomonitoring lies in a
sound study design where a worker is followed in time after
establishing an individual baseline (which serves as his/her
own control). For industrial exposures, the work pattern
offers many opportunities to explore work exposure as a
contributing factor.
The dependence of the selection of biomarkers on the
permissible exposure in the workplace is illustrated by
benzene. The first ACGIH TLV for benzene, published in
1946, was 100 ppm. To monitor benzene exposure at that
level, sulfates and phenol in the urine were widely used as
biomarkers. Over the years, the TLV was lowered several
times, in the 1970s being 10 ppm. To monitor benzene
exposure at that level, sulfates were not suitable biomarkers,
because the levels of organic sulfates among workers occu￾pationally exposed to benzene were not different from the
levels of endogenic sulfates, and urinary phenol was used
instead. In 1990, after benzene was confirmed to be a human
carcinogen, its TLV was lowered to 0.5 ppm, making phenol
in blood and urine an unsuitable biomarker because of
its increase in specimens collected from benzene-exposed
workers was within the range of normal levels. In 1997, S￾phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA) in urine was recommended
as a suitable biomarker for monitoring of benzene exposures
permissible in the workplace (ACGIH – TLV). Likewise,
hippuric acid in urine as a biomarker for toluene exposure
has been removed from both ACGIH BEI and DFG BAT
lists, because the increase of hippuric acid excretion caused
by exposure to the new TLV/MAK of 20 ppm is in the range
of excretion of endogenic hippuric acid (0.5–1.5 g g−1 of
creatinine). Instead, urinary o-cresol and urinary toluene
have been recommended as biomarkers of exposure to
toluene (247–252).
4.3.3 Availability of Analytical Methods
The importance of selecting a suitable analytical method
should not be underestimated. The laboratory should be able
to demonstrate recent and frequent experience with the anal￾ysis of field samples in addition to participation in external
quality assurance schemes. Gas chromatography (GC) and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) interfaced
with mass spectrometry (MS) detectors are the best instru￾ments for the measurement of organic biomarkers. Collision
cell technology coupled inductively plasma mass spectrom￾etry (CCT-ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectroscopy are
usually the best choice for analysis of metals.
The sampling design includes contacting the laboratory
to know if they have the right equipment and methods
to analyze the specimen and biomarkers chosen. Nowa￾days, the assays for biological monitoring should be vali￾dated, to ensure adequate quality standards. Assay validation
should be performed following international guidelines (for
example, the Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for
the industry of the US FDA, 2018 (253)). Here there are some
questions to ask the laboratory:
44BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
• How specific is the method? And what can interfere
with the measurements?
• Is the method sufficiently sensitive?
• What is the detection limit? What is the quantification
limit?
• Is the precision of the method adequate?
• What size sample is required?
• Is the laboratory part in a quality control program?
• How much does the analysis cost?
It is preferable to choose the well-performing laboratory.
If this is not possible either because the samples are unstable
or there is no suitable place to perform sample clean-up then
a laboratory in close proximity to the sampling site should
be selected, so the samples can be quickly transported and
analyzed in a timely manner.
4.3.4 Stability of the Biomarker and Specimen
Biological samples are rarely analyzed in the field; they are
usually transported to a laboratory and analyzed a few days
later. Preservation of biological specimens, avoidance of
contamination, and stability of the samples must be assured.
To attain such assurance (assuming that the biomarker is
stable and nonreactive), the following questions must be
answered:
• Are the sample containers made from material that will
not contaminate the sample?
• Are the sample containers made from material that does
not absorb the biomarker, or does not react with the
biomarker?
• Are the containers adequately sealed to prevent loss of
a volatile biomarker?
• Should the samples be transported and stored anaero￾bically? That is, must the samples occupy the entire
volume of the container, or is air space allowed?
• What anticoagulant should be used for blood samples?
• Is the biomarker photosensitive? If it is, the samples
should be transported and stored in dark, nontransparent
containers.
• At what temperature should the samples be transported
and stored?
• Does the analytical method require the samples to be
treated immediately after collection (centrifuging of
blood or acidifying or alkalizing of urine)?
The answers to the above questions depend on the
biomarker, on the biological specimen, and on the analytical
method. Advice should be sought from the laboratory on
how to collect and transport the samples.
5 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING
FOR METALS AND INORGANIC
COMPOUNDS
Biomonitoring of metal exposure is usually performed by
measuring the total metal content in the biological media,
without the distinction of different chemical species. For
example, both ACGIH and DFG suggest monitoring lead and
its inorganic compounds by measuring lead in whole blood.
For cobalt and its compounds, biomonitoring is routinely
performed by determination of total cobalt in urine. For
several metals, such as chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), and
mercury (Hg), it has, however, become clear that different
oxidation status/metal binding/organic vs. inorganic species,
are associated with different toxicological properties (254).
The differentiation of metals in different chemical species or
oxidation status is called speciation of metals.
5.1 Some Examples
5.1.1 Chromium
Chromium (Cr) is present in the environment in two main
oxidation states: Cr(III) and Cr(VI). Cr(III) is an essential
element as it is needed for the regulation and metabolism of
glucose, sugars, and fats. Cr(III) is thus considered nontoxic,
while Cr(VI) has been recognized as a highly toxic elemental
species on the basis of experimental and epidemiological
evidence. It has been classified as a human carcinogen (255).
Occupational exposures to Cr(VI) compounds may occur in
the production of chromate pigments and dyes, stainless steel
and other chromium alloys, paints used in the aeronautic
and maritime industries as well as during electroplating and
anodizing, cutting, finishing and welding of chromium alloys
and stainless steel, and leather tanning.
The main route of absorption for Cr(VI) is inhalation.
Typical exposures are from breathing dust, fumes, and mists.
Biological monitoring of Cr(VI) and its salts is performed
by quantifying total chromium in urine. Urinary chromium
levels reflect both past and recent exposure, with daily accu￾mulation throughout the workweek for the occupationally
exposed subjects. This is not, however, an ideal approach
to Cr(VI) exposure assessment, as both Cr(VI) and Cr (III)
are eliminated in urine. Nevertheless, urine being a noninva￾sive sampling method that can be easily harvested in large
amounts, the determination of urinary chromium is a prac￾tical and widely used approach (32, 54, 256). Chromium
speciation such as Cr(VI) and Cr(III) has been determined
in EBC collected from individuals who worked directly with
chromium compounds (such as platers) (257–259).
45PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
5.1.2 Arsenic
Arsenic (As) is a metalloid and widely distributed in the
environment. Arsenic exists in different chemical forms
with different toxicological properties (260). While organic
As (mostly arsenobetaine and arsenosugars) is regarded
as nontoxic, inorganic As have acute and chronic toxicity
in humans. Inorganic As has been classified as a human
carcinogen and the target organs are the lungs, skin, and
bladder.
Occupational exposures to inorganic As (As(III) and
As(V)), occur in the manufacture and/or processing of many
As containing products, e.g. nonferrous metal foundries,
production of artistic glass, coal-fired power plants, semicon￾ductor manufacturing, the production and use of pesticides
and wood preservatives.
Environmental exposures to As occurs mainly through
diet, with seafood containing both organic and inorganic As
(261, 262). The speciation of As is necessary to separately
quantify inorganic As from organic As. Both ACGIH and
DFG recommend to quantify inorganic As and methylated
metabolites (sum of As(III), As(V), monomethylarsonic and
dimethylarsinic) in urine as biomarkers for occupational
exposure to arsenic (32, 54). Unambiguous interpretation of
biomonitoring results for risk assessment, however, neces￾sitates a controlled dietary intake with exclusion of seafood
intake the last days before urinary collection and quantifica￾tion of As biomarkers (263, 264).
5.1.3 Mercury
Mercury (Hg) can be found in the environment in both
organic and inorganic forms. Toxicity and target organs
depend on the mercury chemical state. Elemental Hg has
many applications in several industries: electrical, chem￾ical, dentistry, to name a few. Inorganic Hg compounds are
mainly used as catalysts in plastic manufacturing. Organic
Hg compounds are used in medicine, pulp and paper indus￾tries, pesticide manufacturing, and for synthesis in chem￾istry. These compounds are either restricted or not allowed in
several countries due to their severe toxicity but are still used
in artisanal and small scale gold mining where occupational
and environmental exposures to both metallic mercury and
methyl mercury occurs in many parts of the world, including
South-America, Africa and Indonesia, Philippines.
Monomethyl mercury is the main form of organic Hg.
Dietary intake is the main human route of exposures to
organic Hg especially from contaminated seafood and rice.
Both ACGIH and DFG recommend biological monitoring of
exposure to elemental mercury and its inorganic compounds
by determining mercury in urine. The reason for selecting
this specimen is that inorganic mercury is prevalent in urine.
The speciation of mercury in hair for biomonitoring exposure
to both inorganic and organic mercury has been recently
proposed. Mercury has a high affinity for hair, and this
measurement reflects cumulative exposures (265–268).
5.2 Choice of Specimen and Analytical
Method
Binding of metals to proteins can cause large differences
between the concentration of the metal in the cellular fraction
of the blood and its concentration in plasma or serum. There￾fore, urine is usually preferred for biological monitoring
of metals such as mercury, chromium, cobalt, cadmium,
and vanadium. Inorganic lead is the only metal for which
measurement in blood is preferred.
Hair may also be used but the sample preparation is
considered as a sensitive step (269). Other specimens such
as nails, teeth, and sweat are sometimes used but are not
considered routine tools and the interpretation of the results
is difficult.
Determining the metal content in biological fluids is
a destructive sample process. The metal of interest is
determined by eliminating the organic matrix followed
by analyzing the free atom in the gaseous state. Atomic
absorption spectrometry (AAS), inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are used.
The ICP allows simultaneous determination of most of
the relevant metals in occupational settings. Consequently,
multi-element biomonitoring studies are now feasible. ICP￾MS is more sensitive and allows a more accurate assessment
of lower metal concentrations compared to the other tech￾niques (270). This is particularly useful in assessing the
metal concentrations in the general population. Double
focusing sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spec￾trometry (SF-ICP-MS) is one of the most selective variants
of ICP-MS and can effectively correct for most spectral
interferences. These methods allow the determination of
the total concentration of metals, irrespectively from metal
species. When metal speciation is desired, an additional
sample preparation step is required. This step is added
to separate the metal species using, for instance, solvent
extraction or other chromatographic techniques such as
HPLC (271, 272).
5.3 Factors Interfering with Biological
Monitoring of Metals
5.3.1 Diet and Environment
The mineral composition of the diet and the source of
proteins can affect the biological level of metals. Metals
incorporated into the aquatic food chain can increase the
metal levels in the human population consuming this food.
This happened, for example, in Japan, when mercury was
46BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
discarded into Minamata Bay and was absorbed by the local
fish population. Consequently, the body burden of Hg was
found to be higher in the Japanese population, depending
on the local fish diet, than in the population of other coun￾tries. Many heavy metals accumulate in seafood, and conse￾quently, eating these increases the biological levels (273).
The mineral composition of drinking water can also affect
the biological level of metals. This is the situation in northern
Chile, where the soil is rich in arsenic. Arsenic enters the
sources of drinking water and increases the body burden of
the local occupationally unexposed population. This is also
the case for Bangladesh, where there is a severe contamina￾tion of the soil (274).
Abnormal dietary and mineral water intake of essential
metals, such as calcium, iron, zinc, and copper, can affect
the biological levels of toxic metals and interfere with the
balance between their intake and excretion. Imbalances of
these essential metals may lead to malnutrition. Populations
living in highly industrialized areas may have higher levels
of some metals in urine or in blood due to a polluted environ￾ment (275). Cadmium concentrations in the general popula￾tion in different countries are available (275–279). Precau￾tions are necessary when assessing occupational exposures
with biological monitoring in areas where the general popu￾lation are also exposed to the metal of interest. This back￾ground concentration among the local general population,
not expected to have an occupational exposure to the inves￾tigated metal, should be measured to properly attribute the
metal exposures to occupational or environmental sources.
Although, only a part of the total metal exposure can be
attributed to occupational exposures, safe biological levels
have to be respected regardless of the source of exposure.
5.3.2 Other Factors Affecting Biological Levels
of Metals
A person’s age affects the biological levels of metals. As
a person gets older, biological levels tend to accumulate
because of the presence of metals in the diet and environ￾ment (280). The binding of metals to tissue components
usually is a saturable process. After the binding sites are
saturated, the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of
the metal suddenly rise. An example is the urinary excre￾tion of cadmium, which suddenly rises after the capacity of
the binding sites in the renal cortex is saturated and renal
dysfunction begins.
The kidneys are the usual target organs of metals. Chronic
as well as acute exposure to metals such as cadmium, lead,
and mercury can cause kidney damage and alter the urinary
excretion of metals and other biomarkers.
Lifestyle factors such as smoking are also known to influ￾ence the body burden of cadmium (281, 282). Co-exposure
to more than one metal may have a complex effect on their
respective concentrations in blood and urine. Competition
for binding sites results in changes in the distribution and
excretion of any or all of the metals. Treatment with complex￾forming agents, such as EDTA, DMPS, and DMSA, or taking
of essential metal supplements, can increase urinary excre￾tion of toxic metals.
5.4 Current Reference Values for General
Population
Biological monitoring values for populations with occupa￾tional exposures are published by different agencies, and
among these are ACGIH and DFG (see Section 3.4 and
Table 2). Many metals do not have an occupational biomoni￾toring value. To interpret a worker’s biological metal concen￾tration without a biological monitoring reference value, a
comparison is often made between the measured values with
values obtained from the general population. Within a study,
this could be the control group, while some countries are
measuring general population values national health and
nutrition examination survey (NHANES) that can be used for
this purpose. Another calculated value is the Biomonitoring
Equivalents (BEs) value. BE is defined as the concentration
or range of concentrations of a chemical or its metabolite in
a biological medium (blood, urine, or other medium) that is
consistent with an existing health-based exposure guideline.
These health-based exposure guidelines are derived by inte￾grating available pharmacokinetics data with existing chem￾ical risk assessments. BEs are published in the scientific
literature (283–285).
5.5 Inorganic Gases
Biological monitoring of inorganic gases is not recom￾mended, except for carbon monoxide. This is because inor￾ganic gases are either irritants, such as chlorine and sulfur
dioxide, or their acute toxicity is critical, as with hydrogen
cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, nickel carbonyl, and arsine. Air
monitoring is preferred, because the acute adverse effect is
usually related to peak concentration in the ambient air.
The exception is carbon monoxide, for which sensitive
and relatively specific biomarkers are available (Table 2).
BEIs are recommended for carboxyhemoglobin in blood and
carbon monoxide in exhaled air. A BAT is recommended
only for carboxyhemoglobin.
5.6 Other Inorganic Pollutants
BEIs and BATs are currently available for fluorides and
carbon disulfide. No other inorganic compounds have been
considered for biological monitoring.
47PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
6 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING
OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Organic compound is a generic term to indicate substances
containing carbon. Due to carbon’s ability to form chains
with other carbon atoms, millions of organic compounds
are known. A few classes of carbon-containing compounds
such as carbonates and cyanides, along with other excep￾tions such as carbon dioxide, are considered inorganic.
Several organic compounds can be found as pollutants in
occupational settings, such as VOCs, aromatic and halo￾genated hydrocarbons, glycol ethers, PAHs, perfluorinated
compounds (PFCs), isocyanates, pesticides, and phthalates.
The chemical-physical properties of these chemicals, their
toxicological behaviors, as well as the biological monitoring
strategies adopted to assess exposure and health effect are
so diverse that only a global approach will be proposed here
without specific details for each group of chemicals.
After exposure to organic compounds, a portion
of the intake may be absorbed into the bloodstream,
distributed among the organs and tissues, metabolized, and
finally excreted. These steps of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion (ADME) determine the toxicoki￾netic process of the chemicals in the body as illustrated in
Figure 7.
In general, absorbed chemicals with short biological half￾lives (nonpersistent chemicals) are eliminated in the urine
as hydrophilic metabolites or, if they are volatile, are prin￾cipally eliminated unmodified in the exhaled air (breath).
Persistent chemicals, once absorbed and distributed, are
stored in deposition sites such as adipose tissue (for organic
chemicals) and bone and teeth (e.g. for lead). Their concen￾trations are in equilibrium with those in blood and are slowly
eliminated (193). Hydrophobic pollutants metabolize to
water-soluble compounds to facilitate the urinary excretion.

organs, such as the kidneys, skin, and bone marrow, can also
mediate the metabolism of xenobiotics. The metabolic prod￾ucts are distributed by the blood throughout the body and
are excreted via the kidneys. The metabolic intermediates
of some compounds are electrophiles that covalently bind
to glutathione (GSH) and to endogenous macromolecules.
These metabolic products have to be biodegraded before
they can be excreted. The persistence of biomarkers in
the body determines whether the measurements in samples
collected after the end of exposure are suitable for evaluating
recent exposure or retrospective exposure. For example, the
hydrophilic metabolites of most organic compounds are
excreted within two days after exposure, while metabolic
products with macromolecules persist in the body for weeks
and even months (286).
6.1 Parent Compound
Measuring unmodified VOCs or solvents in blood or urine
have been increasingly investigated with very interesting
practical proposals for biological monitoring of exposed
workers. Benzene is one example of measuring unmodified
VOC in urine (243, 245, 287–293). These biomarkers are
characterized by high levels of specificity; they may be justi￾fied for the monitoring of exposure to low levels of solvents
or to solvent mixtures, and useful for facing ever decreasing
limit values in the workplace.
Solvents are excreted via the kidneys by a diffusive
process determined by the equilibration of partial pressure in
the urine and blood. The steady state being reached rapidly,
the concentrations in blood, and consequently in urine can
be considered to be representative of the renal blood concen￾trations and ultimately of environmental levels (294). The
bladder collects and holds the urine until voided. Thus, the
concentration of a solvent in a urine sample collected at
a given time represents an integration of the instantaneous
concentration during the urine production and storage period
(252, 295).
Quantitative analyses of organic solvents in urine have
been performed using headspace with or without solid￾phase microextraction headspace-solid phase microextrac￾tion (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography coupled with
different systems of detection and quantification techniques
such as flame ionization, electron capture, or mass spectrom￾etry. The classical method requires no solvents and only a
small volume of sample. It is noninvasive and shows high
selectivity, sensitivity, repeatability, and linearity (250, 251,
296–298).
6.2 Eliminated Metabolites
Stable, hydrophilic metabolites are readily excreted in urine.
Volatile metabolites are also exhaled. Excretion by other
48BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
elimination pathways is usually insignificant. Unstable
reactive metabolites are either converted into stable metabo￾lites and excreted in urine or detoxified by conjugation
with glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, or glycine. Styrene-
(7,8)-oxide is an unstable metabolite from styrene exposure.
This metabolite is further oxidized to mandelic acid and
phenylglyoxylic acid, before urinary excretion. Conjugation
products such as phenylglucuronide and phenylsulfate are
often observed in urine from workers exposed to benzene or
phenol, and hippuric acid in urine from workers exposed to
toluene. Concentrations of stable metabolites in blood and
urine rise and decline in parallel, reflecting the exposure of
the tissues.
Chromatographic techniques are often used to quantify
metabolites. Gas chromatography (GC) in combination with
extraction (clean-up procedure) and derivatization of the
metabolite(s) of interest are often used. Liquid chromatog￾raphy (HPLC) is more common as it often avoids the deriva￾tization step. HPLC lends itself particularly to separating
highly polar and large molecular weight compounds that
have very low volatility and, thus, cannot be separated by
GC. The HPLC technique is also used in trace analysis where
a concentration procedure is necessary, and the sample is
reconstituted in a small volume of a liquid that can be directly
injected into the HPLC. HPLC with a triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry as the detector is a suitable system for
targeted analysis of biomarkers with overall good selectivity
and sensitivity.
6.3 Deactivation of Electrophilic Metabolites
Many industrially important organic chemicals entering the
body are unstable or undergo biotransformation to highly
reactive metabolic intermediates of electrophilic nature.
These electrophilic substances covalently bind either to
GSH, which are rapidly biodegraded to mercapturic acids
(N-acetylcysteine conjugates) and excreted in urine or to
macromolecules such as albumin, hemoglobin, and DNA to
form adducts (299–301).
6.3.1 Glutathione Conjugates
Glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; GSH) is an
endogenous tripeptide consisting of glutamic acid, cysteine,
and glycine. It has a high affinity to electrophiles and
competes for covalent binding with macromolecules. Conju￾gation with GSH occurs mainly in the liver, where GSH
is produced and where most of the enzymatic activation
of xenobiotics occurs. However, some less reactive elec￾trophiles can cross the cell membranes, distribute in the
blood through the body, and conjugate with GSH in remote
tissues.
The conjugation of electrophiles with the SH-group
of cysteine and glutamine cleavage is mediated by
GSH-transferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidases,
respectively. The conjugated cysteine–glycine dipeptide is
further degraded by dipeptidases, leaving cysteinyl residues
that are acetylated by N-acetyltransferase to produce
mercapturic acids. In humans, this mercapturic acid pathway
takes place during hepatobiliary cycling. The catabolism of
GSH-conjugate is relatively rapid, and the urinary excretion
of mercapturic acids is usually completed within 10 hours
after the end of exposure. Mercapturic acids are, therefore,
indicators of recent exposure. Glutathione S-transferases
(GSTs) are a supergene family and catalyze the conjuga￾tion of GSH to a variety of electrophiles including arene
oxides, unsaturated carbonyls, organic halides, and other
substrates GST (reviewed in (302)). The GST family is
divided into four main mammalian classes: alpha (A),
mu (M), pi (P), and theta (T). The classes GSTM1 and
GSTT1 have received much attention because of the high
prevalence of homozygous deletions resulting in null
genotypes and therefore a decreased ability to detoxify
carcinogenic/mutagenic compounds. This has been clearly
observed in the metabolism of styrene, where the polymor￾phism of GST weakened the correlation between airborne
styrene exposure and the urinary excretion of styrene-(7,8)-
oxide mercapturic acids (303). This polymorphism has
been supposed to increase the susceptibility to the toxic
action of these reactive electrophiles in subjects bearing
the null genotypes (304). Although, increasing numbers of
studies trying to understand the impact of polymorphism
on GSH conjugation have been published (304–309), the
importance of the polymorphism for risk assessment is not
yet understood.
6.4 Adducts with Macromolecules
Adducts of major interest for biomonitoring occupational
exposure are DNA adducts detected in peripheral blood
lymphocytes, hemoglobin adducts in peripheral red blood
cells and albumin adducts in peripheral blood plasma. The
macromolecular adducts persist in the body until the macro￾molecule is destroyed by catabolism. Because of their long
dwelling in the body, macromolecular adducts are indica￾tors of past exposure or of integrated exposure during the
last months prior to sampling. Particularly, for peripheral
blood lymphocytes, the turnover is more than 180 days; for
hemoglobin, the turnover of red blood cells is about 120 days
and for albumin about 24 days. It is assumed that adducts
have kinetics that mirror that of the tissue. DNA adducts,
besides being removed by catabolism, are also removed by
the human body’s DNA repair system. This system is an
enzymatic mechanism to detect and remove the adducted
nucleotides from the DNA. This process slows down the
accumulation of DNA adducts in the body. The repaired
DNA adducts last usually less than 24 hours. The DNA
49PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
repair products, that is the DNA base adducted with the
electrophile, are excreted in urine.
6.4.1 Adducts with DNA
DNA adducts are indicators of mutagenic and carcinogenic
potency of adsorbed pollutants (310–312). Their use in
surveying workers is questionable, however, because their
appearance signals an adverse effect that exposure moni￾toring is meant to prevent. Moreover, their level reflects not
only the exposure to the pollutant but also the individual’s
ability to activate the pollutant and to remove the DNA
products. Currently, no reference value has been proposed.
Reasons for this may be that the laboratory assays to deter￾mine DNA adducts are labor-intensive and not yet standard￾ized. Until now, DNA adducts have been used mostly in
research protocols and have few applications in the practice
of worker surveillance.
The most investigated DNA adducts are those of PAHs,
that were used with mixed results for biological monitoring
in industry where workers are exposed to mixtures of PAHs
(313–317). Given the presence of PAH in tobacco smoke,
smoking is likely to interfere with the determination DNA
adducts of these chemicals (318).
Recent advancements of sophisticated chemical analyt￾ical methods have revived the DNA adducts as a measure
of internal exposure to genotoxicants and a biomarker for
human risk assessment (319). Ultraperformance liquid chro￾matography coupled with electrospray ionization ion-trap
multistage mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-IT-MS) have
been used to quantify specific DNA adducts, not only
from fresh and frozen tissues but also from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissues. This could potentially be used
in analyzing archived pathology samples in molecular
epidemiology studies designed to assess the causal role of
exposure to hazardous chemicals with cancer risk (320).
6.4.2 Adducts with Proteins
Protein adducts as biomarkers for occupational exposure
were first investigated by Osterman-Golkar et al. in 1976
(321). Protein adducts may be considered a surrogate of
DNA adducts, as they are similarly produced by alkylation
of proteins by electrophilic chemicals, but are much more
abundant and do not undergo repair mechanisms. Most inves￾tigated proteins are hemoglobin and albumin from peripheral
blood samples. Several studies have shown that blood levels
of protein adducts reflect the degree of exposure to a specific
pollutant (61, 286, 299–301, 310, 311, 322–327).
To bind to hemoglobin, the electrophiles have to pene￾trate the erythrocyte cell membranes, which the highly
reactive electrophiles may be unable to do. Albumin, on
the other hand, is present in serum and readily available
for binding with the reactive intermediates released from
the metabolizing organs. Therefore, albumin adducts may
be more abundant and more sensitive biomarkers than
hemoglobin adducts. Furthermore, albumin is synthesized
in the liver, where the enzymes mediating the metabolism of
xenobiotics are mainly located. In spite of these advantages,
hemoglobin adducts have found much wider application
in biological monitoring than albumin adducts. The MAK
Commission suggested hemoglobin adducts as biomarkers
for monitoring of occupational exposure to several carcino￾gens (See Table 2). Hemoglobin adducts have been also used
to monitor workers after accidental exposures to genotoxic
agents (328); for example, ethylene oxide produces N-(2-
hydroxyethyl)valine hemoglobin adducts. These adducts
were formed within a day of exposure, based on observations
of workers who were monitored following an accidental
release (328).
6.5 Genetic Polymorphism in Enzyme
Activity
In order to provide a better understanding of the impact
of the metabolic polymorphisms on the individual risk to
develop adverse effect, biomarkers of susceptibility have
been incorporated into cohort studies.
There has been a proliferation of genetic information
in the last 25 years resulting in a spectrum of existing and
potential uses in the workplace. These uses have different
issues and implications that may be more clearly considered
in a framework that identifies three distinct uses (research,
practice, and regulation/litigation) for inherited genetic
factors and acquired genetic effects. While the biomarkers
have promise of more refined risk assessments, there is
possible dangers in incorporating this into routine biomon￾itoring concerning various ethical and social issues (186).
These include stigmatization, discrimination, and removing
a susceptible subject from the exposure without improving
the workplace conditions.
Genetic polymorphism of metabolic enzymes has been
found to have little impact on the metabolism of organic
compounds and to explain only a small percentage of
biomarkers variability. Based on these results, these
polymorphism are of limited practical interest for risk
assessment.
7 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING
OF EXPOSURES TO MIXTURES
Although workers are commonly exposed to mixtures of
chemicals, most of the studies in toxicology and biological
monitoring include only single substances (329–333). In
addition to workplace exposures, workers are also exposed
from environmental pollution, food, medication, cosmetics,
50BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
and chemicals used in hobbies (e.g. pesticides when
gardening, solvents in building, particles in woodworking).
Potential influences of exposure to mixtures on biological
monitoring are toxicodynamic effects, which affect the devel￾opment of toxic endpoints, and toxicokinetic interactions,
which modify the biological levels of the chemicals and
their metabolites, thus changing the relationship between
biological levels and exposure. Both of these types of effects
should be considered when using biological monitoring.
7.1 Toxicodynamic Effects
By similarity with what is done in air exposure monitoring,
four different cases can be distinguished.
No Interaction. Potential health effects are not expected
to be different from what is observed for single exposures.
Biological monitoring can be carried out as if exposure was
for a single substance, and biological monitoring limit value
can be applied.
Additivity. When the target site is the same for the
different substances in a mixture, then additivity is often
assumed. For air monitoring, a simple formula is proposed
to combine the concentration (C) for each substance (i): Ci
and the occupational exposure level values: TLVi.
C1
TLV1
+
C2
TLV2
+···+
Ci
TLVi
≤ 1
Using a similar approach, a formula for biological moni￾toring (334) has been established. It combines the concentra￾tion of the biomarker i as MCi, the background concentration
as BCi, and its reference value BEIi.
MC1 − BC1
BEI1 − BC1
+
MC2 − BC2
BEI2 − BC2
+…+
MCn − BCn
BEIn − BCn
≤ 1
This equation could be used for chemical biomarkers
having similar health effects. However, it should not be
used in the case of a metabolite common to several mixture
components as in the case for trichloroacetic acid that is a
metabolite of both trichloroethylene and methyl chloroform.
Synergism. When the likelihood of a health effect is
increased by other components of the mixture, then the above
equation does not apply and the situation should be left to
professional judgment.
Antagonism. Similarly, when the likelihood of health
effects is reduced by the presence of other component(s), no
general rule can be established. Decisions should be taken on
a case-by-case bases (professional judgment).
The most suitable biomarker is the most toxic, but this
is sometimes not feasible. Take, for example, the biomarker
for the carcinogenic mixture of PAHs. Although this is a
carcinogenic exposure yet the commonly used biomarker is
the metabolite 1-hydroxy pyrene, which is the metabolite of
pyrene, a non toxic PAH. The most toxic component of PAHs
is benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) and its urinary metabolite is 3-
hydroxy-BAP. Nevertheless, this is not normaly measured, as
it is excreted in very low quantities and laboratory methods
cannot quantify these low levels. 1OHP is the most abundant
urinary metabolite and pyrene exists in most PAH exposures
which makes it a more suitable biomarker.
7.2 Metabolic Interactions
Exposure to mixtures of chemicals can also lead to toxi￾cokinetic interactions, that is, quantitative modifications of
the ADME processes. Competition between two or more
substances for the same biotransformation enzymes might
influence the relationship between the absorbed dose and the
value of the relevant biomarker, although, this often occurs
after a particular concentration threshold (329). The extent of
the interaction between chemicals also depends on the extent
of biotransformation of each compound. This might change
an established association between the biomarker concentra￾tion in a given biological medium and the airborne concen￾tration of the parent compound, which is often the basis for a
BLV. Consequently, the BLV might not yield an appropriate
value for monitoring exposure to a mixture (329).
At low exposures in well-controlled work environments,
significant modification of lung absorption is unlikely.
Exceptions, however, do exist for instance when a direct
interaction between the contaminants in the air occur. Expo￾sure to mixtures can modify the rate of skin absorption,
and consequently, the biological levels. Elimination can
be affected by exposure to mixtures, either via saturation
of binding sites or by interaction in the biotransformation
process.
7.2.1 Metabolic Interactions Among Pollutants
Exposure to mixtures are often encountered, especially to
mixtures of organic substances. Organic substances in a
mixture can, in some cases, be metabolized by the same
enzymes and may saturate every active site. At satura￾tion, the reaction rate reaches its maximum and no further
rate increase occurs. This leads to inhibition of further
metabolism is of course dependent on the exposure concen￾trations and is usually negligible at low exposures. Such
inhibitions have been demonstrated in several cases under
experimental conditions, for example, for xylene and ethyl￾benzene, for xylene and methylethylketone, and for benzene
and toluene (334, 335). When combined exposures occur, it
is important to investigate the specific case in detail.
Enzymes can be induced, meaning the metabolic activity
of an enzyme increases either by binding to the enzyme
and activating it, or by increasing the expression of the
gene coding for the enzyme. Enzyme induction is a possible
51PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
bias in biological monitoring and can occur when expo￾sure is combined with intake of inducers such as alcoholic
beverages and medications, chlorinated insecticides, aniline,
and some ketones.
7.2.2 Competition for Binding Sites
Chemicals or their metabolites may bind to proteins. As with
enzymes, protein-binding sites are capacity limited. There￾fore, at high concentrations saturation is possible, and conse￾quently, the free protein fraction available for distribution
and elimination is reduced.
Chemicals or their metabolites might compete for the
same binding sites during exposure to mixtures, thus poten￾tially increasing the unbound fraction of the chemical or their
metabolites making either more available for distribution and
excretion. Binding interactions for several metals including
lead, cadmium, zinc, copper, and some essential metals have
been studied (334).
7.2.3 Effects of Alcohol Consumption
Interaction with ethanol in workplaces is important to
consider, as it is usually ingested in large quantities
compared to other pollutants. At high doses, ethanol induces
some enzymes, specifically the mixed ethanol oxidizing
system (MEOS) that includes cytochrome P-450. Alcohol
intake during or just after exposure will inhibit solvents’
metabolism, producing an increase in solvents’ concentra￾tions in blood and a decrease in the metabolites formation.
This has been studied for many chemicals under controlled
conditions (153, 336): alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons,
glycol ethers, ketones. Inhibition of solvent metabolism
decreases progressively when ethanol blood concentration
decreases (337).
Ethanol can increase the enzymatic biotransformation of
solvents; however, this is only expected to occur at high
solvent exposure, since in most cases metabolism is blood
flow limited.
7.2.4 Effect of Medications
Treatment with pharmacologic agents and simultaneous
occupational exposure to chemicals is a largely unex￾plored field, probably because these two aspects relate
to two different specialty areas. Many drugs of various
structures are known to induce their own metabolism or
the metabolism of chemicals. In certain cases, inhibition
of biotransformation also occur. Both of these processes
could lead to changes in biological monitoring results. Few
data from studies among workers or with controlled volun￾teers are available to discuss the importance of medication
on biomarkers. In the absence of such data, simulations
using toxicokinetic models can be used (153, 338). An
application to four different organic solvents with realistic
values has shown that biomonitoring results are sometimes
quite sensitive to medication, either through changes in Vm
(maximum rate achieved at saturating substrate concentra￾tion), Km (substrate concentration at which the reaction rate
is half of Vm) or liver blood flow. For example, hormonal
contraceptives had an effect on the urinary levels of several
biomarkers among women with an increase of more than
50% in metabolites concentrations and a decrease of up to
50% in unchanged substances concentrations, suggesting
an increase in their metabolic rate (50). It is presently not
possible to take into account quantitatively the influence of
medication on biological monitoring results, but this should
be recorded when sampling for biomarkers.
8 TRENDS AND CONCLUSIONS
During the last years, several meetings’ reports or reviews
on biomonitoring have been published with relevant infor￾mation concerning current tendencies in this topic. A few
relevant aspects are reported here to conclude this chapter.
Biomonitoring was initially developed for the assessment of
the health risks from exposure to chemicals at work, and the
approaches and concepts of biomonitoring are derived from
such occupational exposures. Nowadays, biomonitoring is
also increasingly used to assess nonoccupational exposure
from the environment for the general population (38, 337,
339). One of the major challenges is the reconsideration of
the basis of biomonitoring action limits: until today, they
have mostly been developed as point estimates of the highest
concentration likely not to induce serious health effects for
most of the workers (healthy adult population). In the modern
risk assessment practices, a no-effect level is developed for
the general population including children and sensitive indi￾viduals. The major difference between the worker health
protection and the public health protection is that the first is
based on scientific evidence (evidence-based medicine) and
the latter on the precautionary principle (prevention when a
doubt does exist before the absolute scientific evidence).
This actual emphasis on biomonitoring for assessing
the general population’s exposure to chemicals in the
outdoor and indoor environments promotes the develop￾ment of analytical techniques allowing increasingly lower
concentrations of chemicals in biological fluids or tissues
to be detected and quantified (184, 340, 341). However, if
measuring chemicals in the human body becomes relatively
easy, the interpretation and the communication of the results
of the biomonitoring studies, represent a serious challenge
(44, 340, 342–346). Recognizing this difficulty, the Inter￾national Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) and the Health and
Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) established a
Biomonitoring Technical Committee in 2002 to:
52BIOLOGICAL MONITORING OF EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
1. delineate the appropriate scientific uses of biomoni￾toring tools and/or biomonitoring data needed to char￾acterize exposure to chemicals and
2. define the criteria needed for integration of biomoni￾toring and toxicology data into a robust risk assessment
process (342, 347).
In the same perspective, European expert task force on
biomonitoring has been setup at the request of the Euro￾pean Chemicals Industry Council (CEFIC) and the European
Center for Ecology and Toxicology (ECETOC) to develop
criteria for the consistent use of biomonitoring data and
a risk-based framework and guidance on the interpretation
of biomonitoring data for exposure and risk assessment
purposes. In the report published in 2005 (348), a number
of considerations are made that enable the relevance of any
biomonitoring result to be interpreted reliably. The following
four keys are required for any biomonitoring information
used to evaluate health risks:
1. Analytical integrity including validated protocols,
quality assurance, and control, adequate sample size.
2. Toxicokinetics including the timing of the samples, the
knowledge of kinetics, and the related knowledge of
exposure parameters (route of entry).
3. Health effects including the (in)ability to relate to
effects (dose–response), and knowledge about mech￾anisms, potential confounders, and co-exposure.
4. Weight of evidence including the shape of the dose￾response curve, and the nature of related findings,
plausibility to the cause–effect relation.
The development and application of molecular genetic
methodologies and other “omic” technologies in toxicology
allowed the discovery of new biomarkers of exposure,
susceptibility, and response as have been illustrated for
benzene (e.g., see http://omics.org) (349). The OMICS
field ranges from genomics (focused on the genome) to
proteomics (focused on large sets of proteins, the proteome)
and metabolomics (focused on large sets of small molecules,
the metabolome). The field of genomics is divided into
genotyping (focused on the genome sequence), transcrip￾tomics (focused on genomic expression), and epigenomics
(focused on epigenetic regulation of genome expression).
In the future, contribution of the OMICS techniques to
occupational and environmental health will help the field
progress towards an integrated view of the interaction
between environment and human health (350).
In the specific field of occupational exposure, the
decreasing trend in exposure levels requires the research
and the development of “novel” biomarkers as presented in
previous sections. All these biomarkers require validation
including the characterization of the background level. To
this regard, the production of reference values for the general
population (with no occupational exposure) will be very
useful to assess the health risk arising from occupational
exposure (34).
One of the main goals of the field of “Occupational
Health” is to protect the workers’ health and to promote their
wellbeing. Biological monitoring is consolidating its value
and usefulness to progress in this direction for the benefit
not only of the workers and the companies but also for the
whole community.

TECHNIQUES

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Historical Development of Real-Time
Assessment of Air Contaminants and
Video Exposure Monitoring (VEM)
In 1985, three researchers from the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health conducted an exposure
assessment and control evaluation of the B.F. Goodrich Tire
Plant, in Marietta, Ohio. What made this study unique was
that it was the first time that a portable computer, a video
camera video home system (VHS), and a real-time aerosol
photometer were used, as a system, to gather second-by￾second exposure data. In this instance, the evaluation of dust
generated from a manual scooping task to make a wide range
of customized products such as insulated wire for Trident
submarines to wallpaper for hotels. This system required
synchronization of time for all three pieces of technology: the
computer to collect the second-by-second stream of airborne
particle data, the video camera to link visualization of work
tasks with the generation of airborne particles, and the data
logger for the real-time aerosol photometer (1). The system
was called video exposure monitoring (VEM).

The results presented a unique picture of exposure that
could not be seen using traditional time-weighted average
(TWA) sampling protocols for hazardous airborne agents.
Figure 1a is a video screenshot showing the relative airborne
dust levels from a drum scooping task when the drum was
full. Figure 1b is a video screenshot showing higher airborne
dust levels when the drum is half-full. The data were modeled
to show that when the job was organized into work tasks of
scooping, weighing the power, and turning away to put the
filled bag of powder in a receiving drum the exposure to dust
became a major hazard after half the drum was emptied of
powder (Figure 2). Based on this information, the drum was
cut in half, and the job streamlined to improve work flow
and productivity, resulting in approximately 90% reduction
in dust exposure and a work cycle that was reduced from
approximately 90–30 seconds (see Figure 3a and b). This
was the genesis case study in the United States that kick
started VEM.
About the same time, and unknown to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
team, another group in Europe was conducting similar
research (Rosen et al.). They called their system picture mix
(PIMEX). It took about two years for the two groups of

researchers to discover each other through their respective
publications.
Occupational VEM is one of the improvements in this
field. McGlothlin et al. recorded workers handling powdered
materials in order to identify the effects of dust exposure (1).
Rosen et al. used this technique to identify causal factors such
as working habits and workplace settings (2). This technique
provides industrial hygienists deeper insight into the causes
of worker exposure compared to conventional sampling with
pumps, sampling media, and real-time sampling. Basically,
occupational VEM includes video data in the assessment
process and aims to establish an association between expo￾sure levels and workplace events and to identify the causal
factors.
NIOSH researchers applied VEM to a number of case
studies and found utility in this method, especially in
targeting exposure sources and developing controls that
were unique based on using this technology (3).
Since that time, researchers in the United States and
Europe have had slow but steady progress in the area of expo￾sure assessment. In the 1980s and 1990s VEM and picture
mix exposure (PIMEX) showed great promise but failed to
develop to its full potential. There are a number of reasons
that this technology did not take off including: (i) it was a
research and development tool that was customized based
on needs; (ii) it was somewhat complex to operate requiring
an elaborate protocol to collect the data; (iii) lots of data
to analyze; (iv) expensive to purchase equipment, link the
system, and make it operational; (v) required development
of software to collect the data and software to analyze and
playback the data; (vi) real-time sensor companies devel￾oping their own proprietary software to capture and play
back data (no video, just real-time sensor data); (vii) industry
and government (until recently) not interested in developing
this technology as a platform for exposure assessment and
control; (viii) vision for exposure assessment and control
is limited to worker health and safety and not combined
with process engineering. VEM has been shown to protect
worker safety and health and also shows value in process
improvement, quality control, residual product recovery, and
recycling; (ix) the occupational hygiene culture is focused
on traditional sampling protocols (i.e. sampling pumps,
sampling trains, filter cassettes, and charcoal/silica get tubes)
and acting on these results rather than using VEM to augment
traditional sampling, pinpoint exposure sources, and iden￾tify cost-effective controls; (x) expensive and cumbersome
storage devices to capture and store sensor and video data.
Until recently, storing video on portable storage devices was
challenging and very expensive.
In 1999, one of the original NIOSH researchers for VEM
retired from the U.S. Public Health Service and became

a tenured professor at Purdue University to advance this
research. Purdue’s Exposure Assessment Research Labo￾ratory (P.E.A.R.L.), headed by Dr. James D. McGlothlin,
focused on industry and university case studies to advance
this technology. From 1999 to 2015, several case studies had
been conducted, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry.
The goal for each case study was to identify exposure
sources and the impact of cost-effective controls, including
best practices and engineering controls. Most important
was advancing the ease and use of VEM to provide insight
on exposure and control that could not be gained from
traditional air-sampling techniques (i.e. sampling pump,
sampling train, and sampling medium), which most often
provided average exposure data over time. Traditional
sampling cannot be replaced by VEM, as the TWA data
are compared to occupational safety and health standards.
However, VEM can point to exposure sources, and when
controls are applied, before and after traditional sampling
can be used to verify outcomes.
In many of the case studies conducted at Purdue Univer￾sity, 80% of the exposures occurred during 20% of the work
cycle. In some instances, 90% of the exposure occurred
during 10% of the work cycle. Because it was obvious what
work task or engineering control was causing exposure, it
was easy to apply controls. The outcomes were very cost￾effective.
In Europe, PIMEX has worked to advance its system and
marketed it to industry. At Purdue University, while VEM
was primarily a research and development tool, it did apply
for and was approved for two patents (Patent: 7,126,121.
Real-Time Video Radiation Exposure Monitoring System
and Patent: 7,205,891 Real-Time Wireless Video Exposure
Monitoring System).
In 2015, NIOSH’s Pittsburgh lab introduced its system
titled: enhanced video analysis of dust exposures (EVADE).
While the initial version was clunky and required some
training for users, the software was free and could be
downloaded for use. Since the first release, a newer version
(EVADE 2.0) is now available for free download and use.
To date, the NIOSH’s Pittsburgh lab’s mandate is to focus
on exposure assessment and control of mining operations.
As such, it has developed tools to evaluate particulate and
noise exposures. Additional sensors outside this area may be
adapted by the software. However, additional sensors outside
dust and noise are not tested and validated by the Pitts￾burgh lab. Unfortunately, many of the same challenges to
VEM and PIMEX noted above also plague NIOSH’s EVADE
initiative. The good news is that the government has spent
significant taxpayer money to advance this as a viable and
valuable tool to protect worker safety and health. It may be
beneficial, given NIOSH’s role, to work with sensor manu￾facturers to encourage open source code to connect to third￾party software developers. The current practice is for some
sensor manufacturers to link their own proprietary software
to the real-time sensors, limiting applications such as VEM.
Fortunately, there are many sensor manufacturers that focus
on what they do best, make high-quality sensors, and that
allow plug-and-play protocols that link to VEM-like systems.
This benefits the sensor manufacturers and the occupational
hygiene community.
While advances in real-time technology have advanced,
especially in the area of personal wearable devices, it has
not advanced in occupational and environmental safety and
health. The chapter describes the occupational exposure
characteristics that are related to work activities and presents
the strategy for occupational VEM. The current application
and development of each part of the assessment system are
discussed. New ideas for further improvement of the VEM
system are suggested.
Four short case studies are presented in this chapter to
show advances in VEM. The objective is to show how VEM
has advanced from a complex, cumbersome, and expensive
67PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
system to an easy, affordable, portable, and powerful system
that anyone can operate to conduct effective exposure and
control assessments.
2 OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE
2.1 Exposure Agents
There are three kinds of hazards that workers are potentially
exposed to in the workplace: chemical, biological, and phys￾ical. Workers may be exposed to chemical agents, such as
vapor, gas, or dust, by inhalation, dermal uptake, or ingestion.
Among these, inhalation is the predominant exposure route.
Biological factors can include viruses and bacteria. Physical
factors can be noise, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and
radiation.
2.2 Exposure Types
Worker activities can directly produce these agents and cause
personal exposure. Workers can also be exposed incidentally
to agents that exist in the background, are not generated
by workers, or are generated by nearby workers. That is,
workers may be exposed to agents that are not related to their
work. Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between workers,
tasks, and agents. Direct or indirect exposure can occur
individually or simultaneously.
2.3 Exposure Variability
For a given worker, exposure levels can vary from day to day
due to changes in the weather and within the day because
of changes in work tasks. Also, variations exist between
Tasks Agents

A
C
Workers
FIGURE 4 Workplace exposure factors. A: Task-related expo￾sures, B: incidental exposure from nearby tasks, and C: incidental
exposure from background.
workers. If the studied workers are in the same job, the
variation may be due to the difference in working habits. If
the studied workers are not in the same job, the variation may
be due to the differences in the type of work. Talking to the
workers and their supervisors is helpful in determining what
is routine in their job and what is not. When analyzing the
data, patterns of exposure will emerge more quickly with less
job variability.
2.4 Exposure Effects
Exposure to the agents previously mentioned can cause acute
or/and chronic effects on the health of workers. In occu￾pational hygiene work, average exposure levels on a daily
basis are often used and are considered to be related to
chronic effects. Peak exposure is a serious problem and can
cause acute health effects. There is concern that high short￾term exposures could also result in chronic ill health (4).
However, it is often ignored when average exposure levels are
below the relevant occupational exposure limit. It is impor￾tant to note that exposure levels three times the standard
exposure limit for an eight-hour day should be controlled.
However, when traditional sampling is done over an eight￾hour day, identifying peak exposures three times the limit
is not known. This leads to a false sense of security of no
immediate health hazard when there may be long-term harm
leading to illness, disease, and premature death. Real-time
sensors for hazardous agents can help identify excursions of
over three times the standard exposure and provide better
insight into short-term, high-exposure, and long-term health
effects.
3 DESCRIPTION OF OCCUPATIONAL
VIDEO EXPOSURE MONITORING
3.1 Why Video Exposure Monitoring?
It is important to have a profile of the worker’s exposure
instead of average exposure levels because of at least two
reasons that have been mentioned: exposure variability and
peak exposure effect on health. Direct-reading instruments
make it possible to collect a large amount of real-time
data with short intervals and to form a profile of expo￾sure concentrations for a period of work time. To interpret
the variation of exposure level, records of workers’ activ￾ities are needed. Recording worker performance on video
provides the detailed information required to analyze later
the workplace events as opposed to notes taken during moni￾toring, which typically do not include the same level of
detail (5).

3.2 Assessment Strategy
The strategy of occupational VEM is similar to that of
conventional assessment, as shown in Figure 5. However,
some additional steps are required. During exposure
monitoring, VEM requires that all equipment be synchro￾nized for accuracy and validation of later data analysis.
During data interpretation, worker activities are sorted
according to task type, tool use, or other factors, and then
each measurement is ascribed to the corresponding descrip￾tive category. The relationship between measurements
and worker activities can then be established by statistical
methods.
3.3 Monitoring and Mixed Systems
Several different kinds of VEM systems have been devel￾oped. The main difference between the systems lies in the
technique of inputting monitoring data and mixing the data
with video. A typical system that was developed and applied
by McGlothlin et al. (6) includes the following:
• A personal, direct-reading sampling instrument
(sensor) used to gather worker exposure data. Note,
some sensors can be equipped with a data logging
device to capture and store the data. Later, this data
can be uploaded to a computer and synchronized with
video taken of the worker.
• Wireless communications, either Bluetooth, or similar
technology, or the internet to achieve the wireless trans￾mission between the instrument and the computer.
• Video equipment to record worker activities.
• Computer software to capture, synchronize, and store
video and sensor(s) data.
• Playback software to show the synchronized video and
sensor data.
Recent advances in smaller, less expensive, and more
portable computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, have made it
easier to attach it to directly connect the sensors and a camera
to this unit and attach it to the worker or place in an area-for￾area monitoring. The synchronized data are then uploaded
from the Raspberry Pi storage device to a portable or desktop
computer for playback and analyses. A detailed description
is given later in one of the case studies.
Rosen et al. have used a custom-built video mixer for
merging the sampling signal with the camera’s video output
signal and used a video tape recorder for storing results
(2, 5). The overall improvement in the VEM system is
attributed to the technical improvement of each component.
This is described later.
3.4 Uses
Generally, occupational VEM techniques can be used in the
following three categories:
• Exposure assessment that includes determining compli￾ance with occupational exposure levels, investigating
task/source, and so on.
• Research on topics such as ventilation system effective￾ness assessment.
• Evaluation of best practices to determine what work
tasks may be causing high exposures and what can be
modified to control them.
• Industrial hygiene and Safety training programs.
4 SELECTED DIRECT-READING
INSTRUMENTS
VEM systems use direct-reading instruments to gather expo￾sure data. Direct-reading instruments combine sampling and
analytical functions and typically rapidly display monitoring
results. Most systems are capable of storing continuous
readings and displaying averages for determined time inter￾vals (6). Examples of direct-reading instruments include a
photoionization detector (PID) for organic vapors and a light￾scattering detector for aerosols. Instruments that detect radi￾ation are also being utilized in VEM (7). The recent book
by American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) titled
Important Instrumentation and Methods for the Detection
of Chemicals in the Field (8) provides details on various
instruments that detect chemicals in (near) real time for expo￾sure assessment and worker health protection. More impor￾tant, this book provides examples of how real-time expo￾sure assessment systems are becoming more portable and
powerful (computing power, memory, response time, and
accuracy) to identify and quantify chemicals, thus making
real-time sensors a very useful exposure assessment tool for
69PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
industrial hygienists and safety specialists, production engi￾neering, and health professionals.
4.1 Photoionization Detector
PIDs utilize the principle of photoionization as the primary
means of detection (9). Ultraviolet (UV) light is used as
a means of ionizing compounds that enter the detection
compartment. The ions produced in this process are then
collected by electrodes. The current generated is there￾fore a measure of the ionized compound concentration.
Since PIDs are based on ionization, PIDs will analyze and
produce a total concentration of everything that can be
ionized in the atmosphere and will not distinguish among
the species present. When there is only one contaminant
of interest in the atmosphere, the readings can be the true
concentrations. When more than one contaminant can be
detected by the PID, the ratio of the mixture should be
obtained and used as response coefficients for the contam￾inant of interest as long as the ratio of the mixture remains
unchanged.
4.2 Aerosol Measurement Instrument
Portable and personal instruments for direct-reading
measurements of particulate matter are based on the
principle of light scattering. The instrument continuously
senses the intensity of light scattered from the particles in the
sensing volume at a given angle relative to the incident light
beam as they pass through a sensor cell of defined volume
(10). The instrument updates and displays the aerosol mass
concentration every given time interval.
4.3 Response Delay of Direct-Reading
Instruments
VEM requires that instruments respond quickly so they
can reflect the real relationship between workplace events
and exposure levels. However, readings of some real-time
instruments do not represent the events taking place at
the same time. Instead, they lag behind that time. When
the instrument’s inlet concentration changes quicker than
the instrument’s response, the instrument will miss the
actual concentration at that time and provide a distorted
concentration picture (11). To limit the distortion, the
response time of the instrument should be shorter than the
events of interest so that the analysis result can provide
an actual association between exposure concentrations and
workplace events. When the response time is significant
and can be measured, it should be factored in during data
processing.
5 WIRELESS DATA COMMUNICATIONS
5.1 Radio Telemetry
When exposure monitoring was first introduced, the moni￾toring instrument carried by the worker was connected to a
data logger with a long cable to allow instant access to data.
This kind of connection affected and limited the activities of
the worker. The development of a radio telemetry instrument
suitable for personal exposure monitoring enabled remote
acquisition of data in the VEM system. The radio telemetry
instrument consists of data terminal equipment (DTE) and
data communications equipment (DCE). DTE is connected
to the output port of the monitoring instrument, and data
are continuously transmitted to DCE. The DCE then loads
the data into the computer. Information on exposure levels
can then be simultaneously displayed on a video monitor
in a graphic format. Kovein and Hentz (12) applied a radio
telemetry system with a modified commercial frequency
scanner to monitor personal exposure to methylene chlo￾ride in a furniture-refinishing facility. McGlothlin (13) used
SATEL-3ASd in VEM of airborne organic vapor exposures
in a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility (see Figure 6). In
this monitoring project, the worker carried only two instru￾ments: MiniRAE™ and SATEL™. Alternatively, if instant
data are not necessary and telemetry is not possible, the
response from the instrument can be data logged and then
mixed after the video has been recorded (14). An example
where the use of radio telemetry equipment is not allowed is
in hazardous areas, such as areas where flammable gas may
be present, which require electrical equipment to be intrinsi￾cally safe or otherwise protected.
5.2 Bluetooth and Wireless Internet
Communications
Bluetooth communications was invented in 1994 by Ericson,
a Swedish telecom manufacturer. As known by anyone
streaming music from their smartphones to their wireless
headphones, or from their personal training devices (Fitbit,
Garmin, etc.) to their smartphones, this communications
protocol has become commonplace in recent years. With
FIGURE 6 Radio telemetry diagram.
70VIDEO EXPOSURE MONITORING ASSESSMENT OF AIR CONTAMINANTS
applications to VEM, Bluetooth is especially valuable for
streaming health hazard sensor data to a portable computer.
Basically, Bluetooth is a wireless communication speci￾fication operating on the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band. It is the
much smaller cousin of wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) because of
its short-range communications (about 32 ft (10 m)); further￾range communications is for Class I industrial applica￾tions (about ∼330 ft (100 m)). Because Bluetooth commu￾nications is unlicensed, it can be used by anybody who
wants to transmit and receive data. Bluetooth communi￾cation kits come with a transmitter, receiver, and control
chips to modulate and demodulate digital signals. Blue￾tooth communication operates either as a short-range contin￾uous data transfer (data streaming) or in small packets
of data over longer distances. Bluetooth communications
is not perfect. For example, physical obstructions (espe￾cially metal), battery life, and other devices in the same
band frequency can hamper communications. In spite of
these limitations, advances in next-generation Bluetooth
technology, ease of operation, ubiquitous availability of
Bluetooth systems, and low cost make it go-to communica￾tions protocol for VEM.
5.3 Internet (Wi-Fi)
Internet Wireless Communications known as Wi-Fi stands
for wireless fidelity. This technology is for local area
networking with devices and is based on IEEE 802.11 stan￾dards. Real-time sensors that can detect Wi-Fi compatible
devices can connect to the internet via a wireless local area
network (WLAN) and a wireless access point (AP). When
a unique internet protocol number is identified between the
sensor and computer, communication is established. The
main advantages of Wi-Fi-enabled sensors are speed (up to
and over 24 megabits per second) and distance (anywhere
in the world). The disadvantage is if the computer cannot
connect to the Wi-Fi. This can be due to not having a
connection, radio transmission interference, and costs (from
telephone wireless internet plans), among others. In spite of
this, the coming implementation of 5G wireless communi￾cations will be a game changer for nearly everything we do
in life and work.
6 VIDEO EQUIPMENT
Consumer-quality video equipment can often be used to
record worker’s activities. The digital camcorder is prefer￾able for computer processing; otherwise, analog-to-digital
conversion will be required for analog video. Special video￾editing programs can directly control the digital camcorder
on the computer and capture video clips from the recorded
video in the camcorder. It is important to make sure that
the on-screen clock or timer is captured by the computer.
Normally, time displayed on the digital camcorder as a
subcode will not be captured when the computer and the
camcorder are directly connected. A compressor must be
connected between them to transmit the time code to the
computer at the same time as the video was recorded. The
captured video can be stored on the computer in various
formats including moving picture experts group (MPEG) and
audio video interleave (AVI), depending on the requirement
of the video-sensor mixer software. Recent advances in video
camera equipment have made it more portable, more afford￾able, and more field rugged. This includes portable sports
cameras such as the GoPro camera line (http://GoPro.com),
proprietary playback software, and the Garmin camera line
(http://Garmin.com) nonproprietary playback software. The
challenge is when the camera companies develop proprietary
software to playback the pictures and video. This becomes
a hindrance to using such cameras for VEM applications.
Some camera companies, like many health sensor compa￾nies who develop software that only communicates to their
devices, restrict access to markets where products, such as
VEM, can be used.
7 RASPBERRY Pi – DISRUPTOR
INNOVATION FOR VEM
The Raspberry Pi was created in February 2012 by the Rasp￾berry Pi Foundation (http://novadigitalmedia.com/history￾raspberry-pi). This very small (the size of a deck of playing
cards) and inexpensive computer (approximately $50) was
set up to promote and teach basic computer science in schools
and colleges in the United Kingdom (UK). The Raspberry
Pi Foundation initially released two computers: the Model A
and the Model B. Both computers had different specifications
and capabilities. Because the Raspberry Pi encouraged open
source software programming, a community of hardware and
software enthusiasts formed to purchase thousands of these
kits to develop their own projects. In this instance, VEM has
been using the Raspberry Pi since 2015 with great success
because of the many plug and play universal serial bus (USB)
connections of nonproprietary sensors and cameras. Thanks
to the increasing capacity of the micro-SD storage cards (that
also run the VEM software), embedded in the Raspberry Pi
and the increasing storage capacity of thumb storage drives,
the data recording and storage are not issues as they were in
the past.
8 MIXING SOFTWARE/INSTRUMENT
Video and monitoring data can be mixed with a special
mixing instrument or by a computer with special software.
71PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
The output can then be recorded on video media or stored
on the computer. Recent advances in the development of
this software are in two distinct packages: (i) simultaneously
recording and storing video and sensor data on a portable
computer (VEM capture) and (ii) playing the video and
sensor data back on a laptop computer (VEM playback).
Both systems are shown in the last case study presented in
this chapter.
8.1 Overlay Technique from NIOSH
As mentioned in the introduction, NIOSH researchers devel￾oped the initial VEM platform. At that time, researchers from
NIOSH developed a VEM overlay technique (15). A special
computer program was developed to generate a graphical
representation of worker exposures. A colored bar with a
black background can be generated to show the magnitude
of exposure, or curves with different colors for start-till￾current exposure trend and overall exposure trend can be
generated. Using a video overlay board in the computer, one
or two exposure data graphs can be then overlaid onto the
video that has recorded the worker’s activities. Before over￾laying, the computer’s graphical signal should be converted
to a National Television System Committee (NTSC) signal.
To synchronize the exposure data with the video, the graph￾generating program is first set up. When the time on the
video’s clock reaches the time of the first reading in the
data set, the program’s display is started. With practice, this
will synchronize the exposure data and video recording of
the work activities to within less than a second, which is
sufficient for most applications. In those days, the process
of synchronizing the video with the sensor signal was very
simple: Manually and simultaneously activating both the
video and sensor activation buttons to collect the data. The
overlaid video signal can be displayed on a video monitor
and recorded on a second video recorder.
8.2 PIMEX – The European Experience
At the same time that NIOSH began this research, Gunnar
Rosen et al. from the National Institute for Working Life
in Sweden also worked on a PIMEX system for the same
purpose (16). Video mixer AVM 2000 was used to mix
the signals from video and the direct-reading instrument
instead of using an overlay card on a computer. The mixed
signals were then transmitted to videotape recorders to be
recorded on tape. The mixed video displayed the exposure
measurement in the same way as the NIOSH technique. With
the development of computer technology, several research
groups have been improving PIMEX. Up to now, picture￾mix personal computer (PIMEX–PC) from the National
Institute for Working Life in Sweden, Finnish-picture-mix
(FINN–PIMEX) from video text tracks (VTT) in Finland,
and Exposure Video Visualization (PIMEX) from the Health
and Safety Laboratory (HSL) in England are available (5, 17,
18). Overall, as the result of processes by these systems, the
following data can be demonstrated on the screen: a video
recording of worker activities and graphs of exposure levels
and concentration values (see Figures 7–9). All these systems
also have the capability to control the progress of video. In
FIGURE 7 PIMEX–PC computer interface.

FIGURE 9 PIMEX–HSL computer interface.
73PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
PIMEX–PC, the analyst can drag the cursor on the graph of
the overall exposure levels to a point of interest, and then the
video will start from that point. PIMEX–HSL can label tasks
or activities in a hierarchy, which provides a convenient way
for the analyst to identify the high-exposure reason.
8.3 MVTA – Multimedia Video Task Analysis
(University of Wisconsin)
Multimedia video task analysis (MVTA) was originally
developed to assess ergonomic conditions and their effects
on biological reactions, such as pulse and respiration. It also
can work as combination and analysis software for VEM.
Its special motion analysis window allows the analyst to
break the whole work period into several parts representing
different events (see Figure 10). McGlothlin (13) used this
feature in VEM of airborne particulate and organic vapor
exposures in a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. In this
application, biomechanical data have been replaced by expo￾sure data.
8.4 EVADE – NIOSH Updates Its 1985 Roots
in VEM
In 2014, researchers from NIOSH’s Mining Research Divi￾sion, in Pittsburgh, PA, launched a website that promoted
its version of VEM titled The EVADE software program
(http://cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1867.html).
Basically, it used updated computer, video, and sensor
technology to do what the original NIOSH researchers,
from the Engineering Control Technology Branch (ECTB),
did in 1985. However, the launch of EVADE was welcome
news among occupational hygienists-promoted real-time
exposure assessments as a tried and proven technology
for pinpointing exposure sources and then applying cost￾effective controls. EVADE merges video files and logged
data files, which allows the user to view them to help identify
exposure sources. NIOSH has updated its original version
of EVADE to make it more functional and user-friendly.
EVADE has many challenges in advancing this initiative
including (i) the slow pace of updating the program and
verifying results; limited applications: only dust and noise
sensors have been validated so far. This makes sense as
EVADE’s main purpose for applications in the mining
industry, a congressional mandate; (ii) video and sensor data
are stitched together after the fact. This can result in errors
in demonstrating what is really happening. For example,
you can stich your vacation video of Hawaii with airborne
particulate levels during a mining operation. While this is
not the intent of NIOSH’s EVADE program, it is possible.
As such, the results from using this program could not be
admissible in a court of law. That said there are many advan￾tages from the release of EVADE including (i) validation
of this technology as a viable exposure assessment tool to
help occupational hygienists determine exposure sources
and devise more effective controls; (ii) they are working
with stake holders outside of NIOSH to improve the tool
for future applications; and (iii) it is free. While patented
technology from Purdue University rivals EVADE (US

FIGURE 11 Screenshot of NIOSH EVADE website showing video and sensor data during a mining operation.
Patent No. 7,126,121; US Patent No. 7,205,891), VEM will
move forward as a very effective instrument to prevent and
control disease, injury, and premature death in the work￾place. Figure 11 shows a screenshot of the NIOSH webpage
showing the features of EVADE on a computer screen.
8.5 Mixing Software Functions
Developing computer programs is the trend of the combina￾tion technique of video and monitoring data. Much informa￾tion can be displayed on the screen, and many options can
be chosen by analysts. Computer-aided VEM systems have
provided industrial hygienists a handy way to analyze the
data and present their findings. Generally, video and moni￾toring data mixer software should have the following basic
functions:
• A video recording of worker activities and graphical
exposure monitoring data can be displayed, synchro￾nized in separate windows.
• The contaminant name, contaminant unit, instant
concentration readings, and exposure time can be
displayed, and short-term exposure level (STEL),
TWA, and peak exposure reading can be calculated and
displayed.
• The scale of the sensor data graph can be adjusted.
• The video can be controlled using a control panel on the
interface.
• More than one sensor and video output can be shown
on the control panel interface.
9 DATA INTERPRETATION
The exposure variation and its association with work activ￾ities can be better addressed in VEM than in other conven￾tional exposure assessment processes. Two analysis methods
are being used to interpret the correlation between worker
activities and exposure levels: the ratio method and the
regression method.
9.1 Worker Activities Classification
Worker activities are one of the main factors that affect the
exposure levels of workers. Worker activities can be clas￾sified based on the task types. For example, dry cleaning
worker activities are classified as loading and unloading
the dry cleaning machines. When exposure levels fluctuate,
detailed classification of activities is recommended. Working
location, ventilation conditions, and surrounding environ￾mental conditions also play a role in exposure levels and
should be considered as factors when applicable.
9.2 Ratio Method
The ratio method is used to identify the relative importance
of the work activities to total exposure. Two variables are
used to represent this importance: relative exposure dose
di and relative exposure level erel,i (19). Exposure data are
sorted according to each work activity to which they are
ascribable. The relative exposure dose di for the work activity
75PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
i is calculated from
di =
∑ni
j=1 eij
∑k
j=1
∑ni
j=1 eij
where eij is the momentary exposure measure j associated
with work activity i, ni is the number of data associated with
work activity i, and k is the number of work activities.
Relative exposure dose does not clearly point out which
activity causes higher exposure(s). For example, a certain
activity with long duration may have high relative expo￾sure dose. But this high value of exposure dose does not
necessarily mean that the corresponding activity is serious.
Relative exposure level erel,i for a certain work activity, which
is calculated as follows, can be used to explain which activity
may cause high exposures:
erel,i = ei
e
in which
ei =
∑ni
j=1 eij
ni
and e =
∑k
j=1
∑ni
j=1 eij
N
where N is the total number of measurements.
9.3 Regression Functions
Building a multiple regression function is a way to evaluate
whether the dependent variable of exposure concentration
is a function of the explanatory variables. The explanatory
variables are usually qualitative and have a value of one or
zero to indicate whether the event has occurred. Sometimes,
quantitative explanatory variables, such as production rate,
can also be used. Statistical tests of whether the regres￾sion coefficients differ significantly from zero can be used
to explain whether the corresponding factor contributes
to the variation of exposure levels. A representative
model is
Y = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1X1 + 𝛽2X2 +···+ 𝛽nXn + 𝜀
where Y is the exposure concentration, Xi is the explana￾tory variables (i=1−n), 𝛽i is the regression coefficient
(i=0−n), and 𝜀 is the residue.
In many cases, each real-time measurement may be some
function of the preceding measurements. This phenomenon,
called autocorrelation, can cause an overstatement of the
significant effects of explanatory variables (20). Autocorre￾lation tests should be conducted, and some data that correlate
to previous data should be eliminated in this situation.
10 DISCUSSION
10.1 Monitoring Subject Selection
As mentioned earlier, there is variation in exposure levels
between workers. It is recommended that more than one
worker be monitored for a given job position, and it is recom￾mended that this monitoring be conducted simultaneously.
By comparing the data from more than one worker, subjec￾tive factors such as work habits and objective factors such as
ventilation rate can be more easily identified.
10.2 Monitoring Instrument
The occupational VEM technique has a broad applica￾tion field. Even though the most common application is to
assess chemical exposure, some researchers are beginning to
expand its application into new areas, such as to assess expo￾sure to radiation and biological agents. The main challenge of
the application of occupational video monitoring is the appli￾cability of monitoring instruments. Portability is also critical.
Instruments currently available for vapor are PIDs that are
not specific to one chemical. This limitation leads to fewer
applications in complex environments where more than one
contaminant is present. This limitation can be addressed
when there is a spike in vapor exposures as measured by the
PID, and then using an air-sampling canister, under negative
pressure, to capture the vapor and analyze using a gas chro￾matograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS).
10.3 Future of the VEM Systems
The advancement of the VEM has seen significant advance￾ments in this technology just within the past few years.
Within the next five years, VEM will likely be a common
device worn not only by workers but also by individuals who
are concerned about exposure to harmful agents in their envi￾ronment. Examples include those who are health compro￾mised, such as having asthma, and want to be alerted by
changes in airborne particle levels that may set off an asthma
attack. Another example would be for those who have aller￾gies, or sensitivity to trace chemicals, and VEM units will
alert them in real time about hazard levels.
While VEM has had slow but steady advances in this
technology over the past few decades, it has largely stayed
as a research and development tool rather than one that
is available in the marketplace. The reasons are easy to
understand: (i) VEM was relatively expensive, costing
approximately $5000–$7000 to procure equipment for
sampling. This includes a laptop computer that has adequate
random access memory (RAM), graphics display, sensors,
data transmitters, data-storage devices, and software to run
both capture and playback of the video and sensor data;
76VIDEO EXPOSURE MONITORING ASSESSMENT OF AIR CONTAMINANTS
(ii) Requires reliable and easy-to-use software that works
across several computer platforms; (iii) VEM is not plug
and play. It requires training, skill, and awareness of the
strengths and limitations; (iv) It can be bulky and hard to
transport, requiring special handling instructions if traveling
by air; (v) It is not foolproof, you do not know if you have
reliably captured the data you want until playing it back; (vi)
VEM is not the gold standard for determining compliance
to standards, traditional TWA sampling is; (vii) Instrument
manufacturers of sensors develop their own proprietary
software, making it less adaptable to use with VEM.
Until now, VEM has been beyond the easy reach of the
practicing industrial hygienist, production engineers, safety
professionals, and allied health science practitioners. In the
past few years a disrupter technology has been introduced
that may eliminate many of the challenges noted above.
This disrupter technology is the Raspberry Pi; introduced
just a few years ago, it has caught not only the attention
of hobbyists’ and hardware and software engineers but also
with occupational safety and health practitioners. The Rasp￾berry Pi computer starter kit begins at $35.00, and a camera
and cable to attach to the Raspberry Pi can be purchased for
under $20. There is an endless array of off-the-shelf sensors
(humidity, air temperature, barometric pressure, etc.) that
can be purchased in a bundle for under $15. The Raspberry
Pi computer features a micro-SD card that can be inserted
to the mother board and have it perform to specifications.
Also, the Raspberry Pi can be ordered with a touch screen
for approximately $70.00. All that is needed to complete
the package is a real-time sensor (usually $200–$500), to
evaluate hazardous airborne agents, and a $10–$20 storage
device to capture and store VEM data. The only other device
needed is a $1000 laptop computer to play back the VEM
data and video. Because the Raspberry Pi system cost several
thousand dollars less than the original system, is portable,
easy to use, reliable, and always links the video with sensor
software, it may be the go-to device for VEM in the future.
Some may be wondering why not the smartphone to perform
the same function? For example, the smartphone has a built￾in camera, a built-in computer, and software in the form of an
App, such as the noise program developed by NIOSH, that
can be downloaded for easy use. So, why not the smartphone
instead of Raspberry Pi? The answer is that the smartphone,
at this time, can only handle one sensor at a time, while the
Raspberry Pi can handle several sensors and video inputs at
the same time. Also, smartphones require development of an
App for each sensor, needs to be vetted and approved by the
smartphone management companies, and the companies take
a cut of every App downloaded by users.
Regarding software, most of the available software has
a limited capacity for capturing, storing, and playing long
videos, resulting in poor performance of data analysis. The
software should operate on several platforms (Windows,
iOS, Android, Linux, etc.) and be user-friendly and robust.
For convenience of training and storage, dynamic displays,
including video, graphs, and other information, it should be
easy to store the information on a protected server or cloud
service where the data can be encrypted and only accessed
by two-factor authentication by an authorized user. Finally,
use of artificial intelligence (AI) using algorithms from big
data can help identify common exposure sources in similar
industries and to catalog what controls are most effective.
11 FOUR CASE STUDIES
The following case studies have been selected to show signif￾icant advances in VEM technology, the variety of appli￾cations, and the utility of VEM to identify and control
hazardous exposure sources.
11.1 Airborne Particulates and Solvents
in an Industrial Facility
Frequently, in an industrial setting it is desired to know what
factors such as work practices, exposure sources, and engi￾neering controls affect the exposure of workers to airborne
particulates and/or solvents. VEM has the ability to specif￾ically define these factors when combined with the appro￾priate detector and data analysis method. This case study
examines the process of developing, assembling, and testing
a video-monitoring system by assessing the exposure of
workers as a function of work activity under different engi￾neering controls using three methods of data analysis.
11.1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this study had several objectives. The first
objective was to build a video-monitoring system that could
monitor a worker’s activities and worker’s exposure to
airborne particulates and solvents. The second objective
was to test the system in an industrial facility and specif￾ically identify exposure sources as a function of the tasks
performed by the worker. The third objective was to evaluate
the effectiveness of engineering controls. The final objective
was to compare three different data analysis techniques to
determine exposure as a function of the task performed by
the worker.
11.1.2 Materials and Methods
This study was performed in a solute-charging (addition)
room in an industrial facility. The solutes added to the
solvent, methylene chloride (MeCl2), were a sodium bicar￾bonate (NaHCO3) powder and dimethylaminothioacetamide
hydrochloride (DMATA). At the time of this study, NaHCO3
and DMATA were regulated as nuisance dusts. By the
77PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
Manway lid
Process tanks
FIGURE 12 Process tank with sealed manway.
American Conference of Governmental Hygienists (ACGIH)
eight-hour threshold limit value (TLV) and Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible expo￾sure limit (PEL) for nuisance dusts, the limit for these
substances is 5 mg m−3. MeCl2, however, is recognized as an
acute eye and skin irritant. In addition, it has been classified
by the ACGIH as a potential occupational carcinogen. The
eight-hour ACGIH TLV for MeCl2 is 50 ppm (21), while the
eight-hour OSHA PEL is 25 ppm (22, 23) with a STEL of
125 ppm.
Exposure assessment of workers consisted of six
sampling sessions for personal dust and MeCl2 exposure at
the time of addition of each of the solutes to the solvent.
Three of the sampling sessions occurred prior to using an
engineering control. During these three sessions, the parts of
a task based on exposure levels were identified that could be
the best possibilities for changing to better control exposure.
After modifying the elements of the tasks in order to reduce
personal exposure, three additional sampling sessions were
conducted to evaluate how successful the controls were in
reducing the personal exposure to workers. The main modi￾fication in control made was changing the charging adapter
on the manway (see Figure 12) to a ventilated manway
charging adapter (Figures 13 and 14).
The job performed at the facility was divided into two
tasks. The first task consisted of the addition of NaHCO3
to the processing tank, and the second task consisted of the
addition of DMATA to the processing tank. Each of these
tasks was divided into four distinct work elements. The first
task consisted of the elements bag positioning, tie clipping,
bag charging, and bag disposal. The second task consisted
of the elements drum lifting with hoist, drum charging,
drum removal with hoist, and intermediate phase (one drum
removed and another drum positioned under hoist).
These activities were recorded using two methods. One
method entailed using a video camera to document workers
activities while having the worker monitored for MeCl2 and
particulate exposure at the same time. The other method

entailed using a watch synchronized to the video camera and
the monitoring instruments and then using handwritten notes
to document the start and stop times for each element within
each task.
MeCl2 exposure to the workers, who were wearing
personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of a Dover™
full-body air suit, was monitored by a Foxboro TVA 1000B
flame ionization detector (FID). The FID sampling inlet was
attached near the worker’s breathing zone with data stored
in three-second intervals.
The Haz-Dust II real-time personal dust monitor was
used to monitor worker’s exposure to particulates. This
78VIDEO EXPOSURE MONITORING ASSESSMENT OF AIR CONTAMINANTS
monitor’s inlet was attached in the worker’s breathing zone,
and particulate data was formatted into three-second inter￾vals.
The video equipment consisted of video camera (SONY
CCD-TRV66 analog handycam), two 8-mm videocassette
recorders (videocassette recorder (VCR): SONY EV-S5000
and SONY EV-S3000), VHS VCR (Panasonic model NV
8950), and a video monitor (Panasonic CT 20104 color video
monitor).
The computer hardware and software consisted of a 500-
MHz processor PC with 128 of RAM, 13 GB hard drive,
and an analog video capture card. The software applied in
this case study included MS Excel for data analysis, VEM,
and MVTA. VEM software enabled exposure data to be
graphically represented against time so that worker’s activi￾ties could be correlated with exposure. The MVTA software
was used to examine the overlaid video simultaneously with
exposure and discrete job elements. This software allows
coding to be performed that determined which job elements
contributed the most to worker exposure. One final piece of
hardware necessary for combining the video and exposure
was the overlay board. The overlay board used in this study
was the Magni Systems MagniCoder Pro.
The experimental design of the case study was such that
three real-time exposure assessment techniques were eval￾uated. Each of these methodologies was evaluated prior to
the control intervention of the ventilated manway charger
adapter and then again evaluated postinstallation of the
control. The data analysis techniques were as follows.
Data analysis technique 1 consisted of time coding the
real-time exposure data for the tasks and elements of the
job using notes taken during the additions of NaHCO3 and
DMATA to the MeCl2 solvent. The data was then used
to determine average particulate and MeCl2 concentrations
as well as peak 15-minutes average concentrations during
each of the runs. In addition, the average particulate and
MeCl2 concentrations as well as peak 15-minutes average
concentrations were determined for each job element within
each task.
Data analysis technique 2 was a nonstatistical method
used to evaluate the concentration during each work element.
This method rather than relying on notes taken instead used
the technique of overlaying the real-time exposure data onto
the video of the worker’s activities. The analysis consisted
of observing the video with the exposure data and deter￾mining the concentration of particulate and MeCl2 during
each work element. Then the elements were ranked from
most to least contributory to exposure. In this method, the
eight-hour TWA, STEL, or quantitative concentration aver￾ages were not calculated.
Data analysis technique 3 was similar to data analysis
technique 1; however, instead of using manual time coding
of the work elements, the software program MVTA was used
to code the work tasks and elements from the video.
Following the data analysis, each of the data analysis
techniques was evaluated for their ability to perform the
following jobs:
• Quantitative calculation of exposure for each work
element.
• Ranking of work elements with regard to worker expo￾sure.
• Estimation of exposure throughout the run, the eight￾hour TWA and STEL concentrations of MeCl2, and
particulates within each task element
• Cost, setup, and analysis time necessary to use each data
analysis technique.
11.1.3 Results and Discussion
Prior to using the engineering control of the ventilated
manway (Figures 13 and 14), the results from using each
of the three data analysis techniques showed that tech￾niques 1 and 3 gave nearly identical output in particulate
and MeCl2 concentrations following coding for time for the
work elements within the tasks. Using these techniques, the
run average, the eight-hour TWA, peak STEL, and average
concentration during work elements could be calculated. The
resulting particulate levels varied between runs but were
less than the PEL. The resulting concentrations of MeCl2
had two out of three runs where the exposure was greater
than the PEL of 25 ppm. For all the runs, the peak STEL
of MeCl2 was significantly greater than the allowable STEL
for the addition of both NaHCO3 and DMATA. These tech￾niques revealed that no specific work element consistently
contributed the most to exposure in all runs. Technique 2 was
useful in showing that exposure could be viewed as work
is performed. But this technique was not able to determine
the exposure effect of each work element due to the large
number of data points collected, which made it difficult to
see graphical changes in concentration versus time. However,
the technique was useful in identifying time points within a
work element where a high concentration of MeCl2 occurred.
Since the work elements and correlation with high MeCl2
concentration were not consistent, it was difficult to deter￾mine any exposure trends during specific work elements.
Technique 2 did show as did techniques 1 and 3 that during
the NaHCO3 bag-charging element that several peak expo￾sures for MeCl2 occurred.
Following the use of the engineering control and applying
data analysis techniques 1 and 3, the particulate expo￾sure levels were found to be less than the PEL for all the
runs. The MeCl2 concentration results showed that only
one run of the three runs produced a peak STEL concen￾tration (181.0 ppm) greater than the OSHA STEL. The
work element that produced the highest average concentra￾tion throughout all the runs was the NaHCO3 bag-charging
79PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
element, which suggests that this is the work element that
is the greatest factor in contributing to MeCl2 exposure. As
in the precontrol situation, during postcontrol (use of engi￾neering control), technique 2 of data analysis was unable to
define the exposure effect of each work element. However, it
was apparent that MeCl2 concentration levels were less than
prior to the use of the control. In addition, a tendency was
noted that exposures during NaHCO3 bag-charging element
were higher than during other elements of the addition of
NaHCO3 to MeCl2 task.
Comparison of before the engineering control installed
and afterward shows that during addition of both NaHCO3
and DMATA the particulate concentration was significantly
reduced following the use of the ventilated manway adapter.
In addition, the average MeCl2 concentration was reduced
to levels below the OSHA STEL and PEL levels in both
NaHCO3 and DMATA addition procedures following the use
of the ventilated manway adapter.
Evaluation of the three techniques with each other shows
the advantages and disadvantages of each data analysis tech￾nique. Technique 1 was able to determine the exposure based
on the work element, rank the contribution of each work
element to exposure, give values for total exposure, eight￾hour TWA, and STEL at a minimal cost. However, the time
required for data analysis following each run was extensive.
In addition, the use of manpower to manually record notes
regarding worker’s activities increases the cost that may
offset the cost of equipment. Another disadvantage with tech￾nique 1 is the limitation on the speed of manually recording
the worker’s activities that could cause some element times
to be missed. Technique 2 has the advantage of giving insight
on exposure, particularly peak exposures and the correlation
to work elements of a task. However, at the time of this study,
the great numbers of data points collected made it difficult to
examine any exposure tendencies due to a work element. In
addition, due to variations between runs this technique was
difficult to use. This technique cost significantly more than
technique 1 due to the large amount of hardware and soft￾ware needed to overlay the exposure data into the video from
observations of the worker’s activities. However, the time to
perform the data analysis was less for technique 2 than for
technique 1. Technique 3 had the advantages of technique
1 of being able to calculate total exposure, eight-hour TWA,
and STEL while taking approximately the same time as tech￾nique 2 to perform the data analysis. The capital investment
of this technique is higher than technique 1 or 2 due to the
additional MVTA software in addition to the equipment used
in technique 2. However, in the long term, this cost may be
recouped due to a reduction in manpower needed to analyze
the data. That is, instead of needing an environmental, health,
and safety professional to code manually the data during the
procedure, a technician could videotape the procedure during
monitoring and then the professional could later perform the
data analysis with the MVTA.
11.1.4 Conclusions
Data analysis techniques 1, 2, and 3 allowed the determina￾tion of variations in exposure due to the element of a task
being performed. Data analysis techniques 1 and 3 were
qualitatively determined to be the most useful methods for
determining concentration as a function of work elements.
Methods were most successful for work element exposure
determination, ranking of element exposure within each task,
and determination of total exposure, eight-hour TWA, and
STEL exposure. In terms of using time most efficiently, tech￾nique 1 required the least capital investment, but the cost
savings over the long term would be negligible relative to
the other two techniques due to the high operational costs
involved. Techniques 2 and 3 require the least time for data
analysis due to the video being overlaid over the real-time
exposure data. Thus, the analysis for these techniques just
requires the time to watch the sampling session video.
The use of VEM in this industrial facility identified real￾time specific tasks that correlated with higher exposures. In
addition, VEM showed its effectiveness for control measures
to reduce the exposure of workers to these hazardous.
11.2 Gases – Nitrous Oxide Exposure in a
Dental Office Setting
Nitrous oxide gas is used as an anesthetic in dental offices
during oral surgeries such as wisdom teeth extraction.
Nitrous oxide has been used for over 100 years in dentistry
because of its ability to relieve pain while having minimal
side effects. However, due to greater exposure of an occu￾pationally exposed worker such as a dentist or dental
assistant, adverse health effects arising from exposure to
concentration as low as 50 ppm to nitrous oxide have been
documented. The effects involve the reproductive, hema￾tological, nervous, and audiovisual systems (24–26). Both
the ACGIH and NIOSH have established guidelines for
allowable levels of exposure. The ACGIH has established
a threshold limit value of 50 ppm eight-hour TWA (27).
The NIOSH-recommended exposure limit (REL), which
was established in 1992, is 25 ppm TWA during the time of
administration of nitrous oxide (28).
Due to these effects, waste gas-scavenging systems are
recommended to be used in dental offices to reduce exposure
to nitrous oxide to dental office workers. Under ideal testing
conditions, a geometric mean of 25 ppm was achieved in
the breathing zone of the dentist when using one type of
scavenging system (29). In this study, no actual patients were
involved. However, when patients are actually involved in the
examination of the scavenging systems, other factors such
as other engineering controls, work practices, and patient
behavior may affect waste anesthetic gases and may cause
the actual levels to be higher.

11.2.1 Purpose
This study, which applied the techniques of video moni￾toring, real-time exposure monitoring of nitrous oxide, and
infrared (IR) thermography to two types of scavenging gas
systems in dental offices during oral surgery, had three main
objectives. The first objective was to assess and compare the
efficacy of two different designs of waste gas-scavenging
systems used in a dental office. The second objective was
to compare the performance of the systems to the relevant
occupational exposure limits. The third objective was to
use one of the scavenger systems and evaluate the effect
of work practices in two dental offices based on experience
using the system, work practices, and nitrous oxide expo￾sure.
11.2.2 Materials and Methods
The overall design of this study involved three phases: Phase
1 consisted of using new scavenging system design, called
System 1 (Safe Sedate Dental Nasal Mask™) shown in
Figures 15 and 16, in a dental office (Office 1) performing
typical wisdom teeth extractions. This office had a dentist
(Dentist 1) who was experienced with System 1. Phase
2 was performed in Office 1 with a different waste gas￾scavenging system, called System 2 (PORTER-scavenging
System: PORTER Instrument Company, Inc., Hatfield, PA),
shown in Figure 17. Phase 3 involved System 1 in a different
office, Office 2, with a dentist (Dentist 2) inexperienced with
System 1. All phases were performed during typical wisdom
teeth extraction surgeries in which at least two wisdom
teeth were extracted. No other additional procedures were
performed at the time of the wisdom teeth extraction for any
of the patients.
Phases 1 and 2 were used to assess and compare the
efficacy of two different designs of waste gas-scavenging
systems used in a dental office. In addition, Phases 1 and

2 were used to compare the performance of the systems
to the relevant occupational exposure limits of the NIOSH
REL. Finally, Phases 1 and 3 were used to compare the
effects of work practices (MVTA used for comparison) in
office 1 versus office 2 using System 1. In other words, part
of the comparison would involve the difference in actual
work practices due to the differences in experience using
System 1.
The main equipment required for the performance of each
of these phases required for monitoring of exposure the use
of a digital video camera, a waste gas-scavenging system, an
IR camera, and a real-time ambient air analyzer for nitrous
oxide. Other required equipment were external hard drives
for data storage, a laptop computer for operation and image
storage from the IR camera, and a digital camera for photo￾graphic records of events occurring during the study. The
overall camera setup for the digital video camera and IR
camera is shown in Figure 18.

FIGURE 18 Example of camera setup.
The digital video camera used to film the activities of the
dentist and staff while performing the wisdom teeth proce￾dure was a SONY HandyCam® DCR-SR100. The video
images saved to the camera were then uploaded to a computer
where then Image-Mixer software was used to edit the video
and prepare it for synchronization to the IR thermography
images and to the data concerning nitrous oxide exposure to
the dentist and staff obtained in real time by the ambient air
analyzer.
The IR camera was used to detect IR radiation in
the 3–5 μm wavelength range. The system used was a
Flir Systems Merlin® Mid InSb mid-wavelength infrared
(MWIR) camera. Flir System’s ThermaCAM Researcher
Pro 2.8 Sr-3 software was used to view the thermographic
images. A typical image obtained from this camera is shown
in Figure 19. This camera is able to detect nitrous oxide in
the environment and convert it to an image able to be seen
by humans. The white circles show where nitrous oxide was
detected around the subject’s head as it was being admin￾istered and the surgery was proceeding. The variations in
color reflect the concentration of nitrous oxide, with higher
concentration (nearer the source) being more opaque.
The air concentration of nitrous oxide in real time was
measured by the Miran SapphIRe Ambient Air Analyzer
(Thermofisher Scientific). During each subject’s procedure,
this instrument was attached to the dentist’s shoulder of the
dominant arm when he was in the room to measure the
concentration within the dentist’s breathing; otherwise, when
the dentist left the room, the instrument’s probe was placed
on a surrogate stand as near to the typical breathing zone
for the dentist. This was to indicate the airborne exposure
to nitrous oxide for an individual remaining in the area for
the entire time of the nitrous oxide administration. The data
obtained from these procedures were then uploaded to a
computer for further data analysis.
SP01
FIGURE 19 Typical image of nitrous oxide (shown by circles)
from infrared camera.
The software used to combine the nitrous oxide air
concentration data with the digital videos and IR thermog￾raphy videos was MTVA software that was used in Case
Study 1. The combination of these three types of data allowed
the researchers to determine a relevant exposure value of
nitrous oxide for a specific time point or interval of time.
Therefore, an evaluation of the best work practices using
System 1 could be performed by comparing the work prac￾tices and occupational exposures to nitrous oxide of the
dentists in Phase 1 and Phase 3.
11.2.3 Results and Discussion
The results as shown in Table 1 and analysis of variance
(ANOVA) demonstrated that System 1 when used by an
experienced user was significantly better than System 2 at
controlling occupational exposure to nitrous oxide. System
1, which was used in Phase 3 by inexperienced user, did
not achieve the same levels as the experienced user and was
not significantly different from System 2. Neither system
achieved the NIOSH REL of 25-ppm TWA for the time of
exposure. Other studies have shown that it is possible for
System 2 to achieve levels less than 50 ppm (30, 31), but
this study did not show this. This may be due to previous
studies evaluated the system in mock surgeries not using
actual patients. Therefore, variables that are controlled in
mock surgeries, such as patient talking and breathing rates,
may be difficult to control in actual practice. The use of
VEM with real-time detection of nitrous oxide allows the
researcher to observe the effect of these variables.
While neither scavenging system demonstrated the ability
to control occupational exposure to nitrous oxide below the

when combined with consistent best work practices. This
study demonstrates that not only is control of occupational
exposure to nitrous oxide in the oral surgery environment
dependent on system design, it is also heavily influenced
by experience and motivation for proper system utilization,
work practices, patient, and surgical variables that are less
easily controlled.
The combination of IR thermography, digital videos, and
real-time ambient air monitoring of nitrous oxide concen￾tration allows the comparison of occupational exposure to
nitrous oxide between two scavenging systems for waste
gas while examining the best work practices to use while
performing wisdom teeth extractions such as ensuring that
the mask of the scavenging system is fitted properly for
either System 1 or System 2. The comparison between
the two dentists’ offices showed from the combination of
these three data analysis that the use of best practices by
the experienced dentist was significantly less than the less￾experienced dentist. The evaluation of IR thermography and
air concentration data using MTVA suggests that key work
practices and patient and surgical variables affect waste gas
emissions.
11.2.4 Conclusions
VEM using a real-time detector of nitrous oxide together
with digital videography and IR thermography allowed the
evaluation of the efficacy of two different types of waste
gas-scavenging systems. In addition, it allows the exami￾nation of the work practices of two different dentists with
different levels of experience with a specific scavenging
system. These work practices were then able to be exam￾ined in detail using VEM and MTVA to determine specific
times/intervals of time when exposure was highest and deter￾mine how the differences in work practices resulted in
different exposures for the same task. These examinations
then could lead to recommendations for improvements in
work practices, leading to lower occupational exposure to
nitrous oxide.
11.3 Radiological – University Laboratory
Using Radioactive Materials
The training of nuclear pharmacists in the handling of
radioactive materials occurs in university laboratories. In this
setting, nuclear pharmacy students learn about the regula￾tions concerning annual limits to radiation exposure, safe
work practices, and also begin to see the potential for muscu￾loskeletal disorders due to the layout of the workstation. The
annual limit to the extremities, which is of particular concern
to nuclear pharmacists due to manipulations of radioactive
materials and equipment with the hands allowed by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), is 500 mSv (32).
Nuclear pharmacists generally stay below the limits but are
still at risk for acute high exposures when accidents occur,
so there is a need to work to lower the potential daily expo￾sures. In addition, the type of workstation used causes the
risk of musculoskeletal injury to be not minimal and needs
to be examined for ways to lower the risk of musculoskeletal
injury. Therefore, radiation workers in the workplace face
two conflicting challenges: minimizing radiation exposure
and minimizing the risk of injury to the musculoskeletal
system resulting in the principles of radiation protection:
minimization of exposure time, maximization of distance
from the radiation source, and shielding techniques being
in direct conflict with minimizing musculoskeletal disor￾ders of the upper extremities and lower back. The interplay
between the principles of reducing radiation exposure and the
ergonomic stresses to the body is complex and often involves
a conflict between best ergonomic practices and the best way
to protect the worker from radiation exposure. Therefore,
implementation of efficient, ergonomically friendly, and safe
procedures has the potential to protect the nuclear pharma￾cist from musculoskeletal injury while minimizing radiation
exposure to the hand and fingers.
Traditionally, in the nuclear pharmacy, film badges and
thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) have been used to
monitor alpha, beta, neutron, and gamma radiation exposure
for individuals. These dosimeters are worn as badges on
the chest and as a ring on the finger(s). These monitoring
methods give accumulated dose, and the dosimeter and/or
badges are processed before the dose received by the worker
83PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
is known. Recently, real-time monitoring systems that
monitor the instantaneous dose rate and the total dose of
gamma radiation of the fingers obtained by an individual
have been developed (33–35). These video-monitoring
systems can simultaneously monitor radiation exposure
and body postures of the worker while performing typical
tasks of the nuclear pharmacist, thus allowing an ergonomic
assessment and assessment of radiation exposure for indi￾viduals based on anthropometric variations in individuals
and workstation design and layout. In addition, because the
video is combined with the recorded exposure data, the task
performed can be correlated with the instantaneous dose rate
and total dose, warning a worker when he/she has reached a
dangerous level of exposure.
Real-time video monitoring together with real-time detec￾tors has been previously used for the assessment of chemical
exposure and ergonomic evaluations of workers (36–40).
In addition, the feasibility of the use of real-time video
monitoring of radiation exposure has been shown by some
work performed in the United Kingdom using the early
advanced exposure gamma instrument system (AEGIS) as
well as a system developed in the United States by Wang
and McGlothlin (7, 33–35). The main disadvantages of some
of these systems are that they only detect gamma radia￾tion and rely on the worker to record his/her activities. The
AEGIS (34, 35, 41) uses up to two cameras together with
two dosimeter probes worn on a finger on each hand to
assess both exposure and worker posture. The dosimeter is
wireless and connects the video and exposure data to the
laptop computer through Bluetooth technology. One camera
focuses on the hands and one focuses on the body. The advan￾tages of the new system and software are that assessment
of radiation exposure and worker posture occurs simultane￾ously in conjunction with tasks being performed and identifi￾cation of unintended procedures or actions that may increase
exposure and risk. In addition, because the video is combined
with the recorded exposure data, the task performed can be
correlated with the instantaneous dose rate and total dose,
warning a worker when he/she has reached a dangerous level
of exposure. This preliminary study used the AEGIS video￾monitoring system and dosimeter and observed two students
of different heights.
11.3.1 Purpose
Using real-time VEM of radiation exposure and ergonomics,
the objectives in the preliminary study were as follows. The
first objective of this study was to identify specific tasks
where anthropometric variations in individuals can cause
increased radiation exposure to the extremities. A second
objective to this study was to identify worker tasks that
cause stress to the body. A third objective of this study
was to identify ways to make the workstation have a more
ergonomic design and layout.
11.3.2 Materials and Methods
The main equipment and supplies used in this project
were a small nuclear pharmacy teaching lab containing
99Mo−99mTc generator(s), laminar flow hoods, L-blocks,
syringe shields, vials containing radioactive materials, lead
containers, syringes, tongs, dose calibrators, Geiger–Muller
counters, microscopes, materials for product quality assur￾ance, a heat source, single-channel analyzers for wipe tests,
and waste containers. Some of the equipment are shown in
Figure 20.
In addition, Web cameras and the advanced extremity
gamma instrumentation system, which consists of an ED2
Personal Extremity Dosimeter and software that can capture
and synchronize video and radiation exposure measure￾ments via Bluetooth technology to a computer, are shown in
Figure 21.
The study involved recording tasks of a typical nuclear
pharmacist’s duties. The system used two Web cams to
record video on a laptop computer. One camera was used
for recording the worker’s body position, while the second
camera was used to record the AEGIS dosimeter measure￾ments and the worker’s activities being performed by the
hands. Still pictures were taken of the task of interest for radi￾ation exposure and ergonomic concerns. Both Web cameras
were started simultaneously and were synchronized to the
AEGIS dosimeter measurements. In addition, activities were
observed to see if the worker has an awkward posture with the
shoulders abducted, whether the elbow is in neutral posture,
static loading on the neck, glare/visual interferences from the
screen, and the barrier height for different physical differ￾ences between the workers.
Ergonomic evaluations consisted of measurements of the
height of the participants, the arm reach of participants,
workstation height, dimensions of L-block used for radia￾tion protection while preparing radiopharmaceuticals, and
the distance to the dose calibrator from the front of the work￾bench. In addition to these measurements, participants were
observed while in the lab and on video preparing radiophar￾maceuticals. The observations documented body positions
and activities performed.
The measurements of radiation exposure (mSv h−1) to
the hands and fingers were obtained in real time using an
ED2 dosimeter while simultaneously video recording the
tasks performed by the hands. The ED2 dosimeter has
two probes that were attached to the fingertips on each
hand. Then, the AEGIS software, which connects to the
dosimeter, permits wireless capture of radiation exposure to
the computer with/without video recording. The dosimeter
is able to measure instantaneous dose rate and cumulative
dose of exposure and sets off an alarm if above a preset
threshold level for accumulated dose and dose rate. The
actual tasks observed and recorded by the (radiation expo￾sure measurements recorded by AEGIS software at sampling

This study, by Table 2 and Figure 22, then shows that
it is possible for a nuclear pharmacist to achieve a dose
that is about 2/3 (338.85 mSv) of the annual dose limit
of 500 mSv. In the event of spills or other incidents, the
potential to be above the annual dose limit is plausible.
However, performing the same tasks at the same worksta￾tion, another taller participant received a dose that was about
45% of participant 1. In addition, by the video recording
and synchronized radiation exposure data, Figures 23 and
24 show in real time how specific work practices along
with height differences may play a role in radiation expo￾sure as the figures show specific time points when expo￾sure varies depending on the task being performed. The
ability to determine the correlation between task performed
and exposure was aided greatly by the use of the real￾time dosimeter data results which were synchronized by the
AEGIS software to the video recording. Based on these two
trials, anthropometric differences, such as height, may play a
significant role in radiation exposure. In addition, this study
identified possible ways to lessen the radiation exposure and
stress to the body by modifying the workstation.
In addition to the radiation exposure, video observations
of the students indicated that stresses to the student’s bodies
differed according to height. Table 3 shows some of the
observed ergonomic risks to students working in the nuclear
pharmacy lab. Furthermore, changes to the layout of the
workstation and tools used also were observed to have the
potential to lessen musculoskeletal stresses to the body, such
as using tongs that are angled while maintaining distance
between the source and the worker. Some further findings
and recommendations are demonstrated in Table 4.
This may indicate that not only are work practices in the
nuclear pharmacy but also workstation design and layout,
anthropometric variability in individuals, and work experi￾ence of nuclear pharmacist may all play a significant role
in radiation exposure in the nuclear pharmacy. Using the
anthropometric variations in nuclear pharmacists to modify
a workstation so that it is more user-friendly for each nuclear
pharmacist has the potential not only to reduce the radiation

of the nuclear pharmacist.
11.3.4 Conclusions
VEM appears to have a future role in nuclear pharmacy
for both reducing radiation exposure and reducing muscu￾loskeletal disorders using better work practices redesigning
the layout and design of the workstation. In this study VEM
showed that accommodations must be made for varying
population sizes to avoid musculoskeletal disorders while
still considering radiation safety in a nuclear pharmacy
workstation. Furthermore, it showed that anthropometric
variations in individuals could significantly affect the dose
received as the short participant received a total dose of
338.85 mSv (2/3 of annual limit of 500 mSv), while the tall
participant received a total dose of 153.58 mSv (45% of short
participant). These doses obtained by these student partici￾pants show the potential for annual dose 500 mSv that is the
annual limit allowed by the NRC. The AEGIS system has
the potential to be a tool for training nuclear pharmacists in
correct work practices as well as being a real-time monitor
of work practices in actual nuclear pharmacy.
11.4 Carbon Dioxide and Heart Rate
Monitoring in a Craft Beer Brewing
Company
For the past 20+years, the craft beer industry has experi￾enced rapid growth, increasing in numbers from 1000 in 1996
to over 5000 in 2016. One of the by-products from brewing
beer is carbon dioxide (CO2) from the fermentation process.
In addition, CO2 is added to beer bottles, and to fermentation
tanks, to purge the air against oxidation, thereby protecting
the taste. While the popularity of brewing beer has grown,
there has been little emphasis on occupational and safety
hazards associated with carbon dioxide exposures during the
brewing process.
11.4.1 Purpose
The purpose of this study was to use the Raspberry Pi with
VEM software to monitor CO2 exposure and heart rate while
workers were performing selected work tasks during the beer
brewing processes (42).

11.4.2 Materials and Methods
VEM capture software was copied to a micro-SD card and
plugged into the Raspberry Pi with a touch screen (Figures 25
and 26). A portable battery was connected to the Raspberry
Pi to give it power. A CO2 sensor was plugged into a USB
port on the Raspberry Pi, and a small camera was connected
to an internal slot on the Raspberry Pi. The heart rate monitor
(Garmin: Vivosmart Heart Rate Tracker wrist watch) was
connected via Bluetooth to the Raspberry Pi. A portable
thumb drive was connected to a second USB port on the
Raspberry Pi to render the video, sensor, and heart rate
data from the test run. The Raspberry Pi was put into a
backpack and put on the worker. The CO2 nondispersive
infrared (NDIR) sensor was tethered to the worker’s lapel,
the camera attached to the worker’s cap (Cap-Cam), and the
heart rate monitor was on the workers wrist (see Figures 27
and 28 for set up). A portable sports camera (Garmin-Virb X)
was connected to a chest harness and fastened to the worker
to capture high-quality wide-angle video (Figure 27). The
sports camera clock was synchronized with the Raspberry
Pi clock.
After the test run was completed, the backpack was
removed, sensors detached from the worker, and recording
stopped. The thumb media storage drive was removed
from the Raspberry Pi and connected to a laptop computer
containing VEM playback software. A screenshot of the
playback software is shown in Figure 29. One of the most
convenient features of the playback software is that parame￾ters of exposure can be set so the program can fast forward
to video and sensor data of interest. For example, if CO2
data went over 5000 ppm, then conditions can be set on the
playback software to a given time, for example 10 seconds
before and after the peak event of 5000 ppm to see what was
happening and what may have caused the high exposure.
This time-saving feature serves to show patterns of exposure
that could lead to effective interventions and controls.
11.4.3 Results and Discussion
The Raspberry Pi performed to expectations. Video, CO2,
and heart rate data were collected on the VEM capture
program and uploaded to VEM playback program. Figure 29

increases in CO2 and increase in heart rate (one of the
symptoms from CO2 exposure). Additional studies are
needed to determine the interactive effects between phys￾ical activity during work, CO2 exposure, and changes in
heart rate.
11.4.4 Conclusions
The Raspberry Pi shows promise as an inexpensive VEM tool
to capture multiple sources of data at one time. In this pilot
case study, video, CO2, and heart rate data were captured
from a representative worker performing a routine work task.
FIGURE 25 Raspberry Pi with touchscreen. Front view –

The methods used to collect the data by a worker putting
on, using, and taking off a backpack were easy and did
not influence the work process. Set up of the Raspberry
Pi data collection system and putting on the worker took
approximately one to two minutes. Taking the backpack and
sensors off the worker took less than one minute.
While this system was far more efficient than previous
data collection systems using VEM, the biggest advantage
was the reduction in the overall cost of the system, nearly
90% less expensive than previous VEM systems tested.
Additional studies are being conducted in this industry, and
in other industries, to improve the operation and function of
VEM using the Raspberry Pi.

12 SUMMARY
The evolution and utility of VEM is presented in four
different settings. Assessments of occupational exposure to
different types of hazards while performing specific tasks
have demonstrated the utility of VEM. In all four case studies
the exposure could be correlated with specific work elements
of tasks. The occurrence of high as well as low exposures
and what was being done in each instance showed the value
of combining video with sensor data. This was particularly
valuable when peak exposures occurred and could be linked
to specific work tasks. Showing these links provide means
for improving work practices and/or engineering controls.
These four case studies show the progression in the devel￾opment of real-time monitoring of exposure to different types
of occupational hazards. The first case study showed the
tedious nature of manually taking notes at the start and stop
times of job elements to quantify exposure.
In the second case study, the MTVA software was adapted
to use with chemical hazards rather than ergonomic assess￾ments of task elements. This software was used in combina￾tion with IR thermography, the real-time detector of nitrous
oxide, and digital videos for analysis of exposure. Both of the
first two case studies required the user to download the data

from the exposure detector to a computer before performing
further data analysis.
The third case study showed how an integrated system
(AEGIS) that has the software which synchronized video
and exposure monitoring can be used to track exposure to
radiation while obtaining visual information concerning the
tasks performed, and thus the exposure can be readily corre￾lated to task elements. In addition, because the detector (ED2
dosimeter) can be connected to the computer by wireless
technology, the data does not have to be downloaded to
the computer as the data goes directly to the computer and
the exposure can actually be graphically seen as it occurs.
In addition, both exposure data and video can be observed
later.
The fourth case study showed significant progress using
VEM with the Raspberry Pi. Not only was it easy to use
and playback for determining exposures, it was by far the
least expensive system developed to date. Raspberry Pi, or
something like it, may gain momentum among occupational
hygienists. This is because many of the barriers (i.e. cost,
complexity, and confusion) have been removed, and the value
of determining specific exposure sources and cost-effective
controls will be a valuable asset in protecting the health and
safety of workers.
13 FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF VEM
Future applications for VEM will see more portable,
powerful, and ubiquitous personalized systems that may
link biosensing with monitoring hazards in the environment
and at work. Storage, maintenance, and management of
VEM will be Cloud based, using 5G internet platforms,
where applications to assist workers and the environment
will be more efficient and without limits. Automation will
be a fact of life for the workplace. VEM will help industrial
hygienists and manufacturing engineers decide where and
when robots replace workers who perform routine, repeti￾tive, and hazardous operations. This will leave workers to
do higher skilled jobs robots cannot do (i.e. inspection and
quality control). Preventive maintenance by workers will be
automatic as tools will be brought to work stations by robots

workers to focus on problem solving that computers cannot
do. In addition, environmental exposures may be linked
with medical records showing changes in blood chemistry
as indicators of hazard exposure. AI, aided by big data
analytics, may be the next big enabler – helping the indi￾vidual make smart decisions to improve their lives at home
and at work. While there are many warnings about loss of
privacy, it will be humans driving this process not machines.
VEM likely will evolve from industrial and environmental
applications to a personalized health assessment tool that
simultaneously monitors our personal health and can visu￾alize and quantify dangerous levels of chemical, biological,
and physical hazards. For example, Figure 30 shows a drone
equipped with a Raspberry Pi zero connected to a carbon
dioxide sensor. The drone camera is synchronized to the
internal clock of the Raspberry Pi, allowing it to sample
the air without restrictions. Using global positioning system
(GPS) coordinates, the video, carbon dioxide levels, time of
day, and location can be recorded and used for a variety of
purposes. Self-driving automobiles seemed like a generation
away from reality but is now taking hold worldwide. For
VEM and all its potential as an exposure assessment tool for
the workplace and environment that time is now.

1 INTRODUCTION
A variety of air monitoring methods are used by industrial
hygienists and occupational health professionals to evaluate
indoor and outdoor human exposures to contaminants, eval￾uate effectiveness of controls, monitor process emissions,
locate leaks, and determine the effectiveness of ventilation
systems. Most sampling methods are either placed directly
on an individual or in fixed locations in an area. These
methods are essentially point samplers, thus the results are
spatially limited to the discrete locations of the sampling
devices. When the concentrations are integrated over time,
the results are temporally limited to the length of the sample
time. Limited spatial and temporal resolution is important
because it reduces an industrial hygienist’s ability to effec￾tively evaluate and control exposures to contaminants.
When sampling devices are placed in a worker’s breathing
zone, the results relate only to the physical location of the
specific worker or to the paths that they travel during the
sampling period. Industrial hygienists take these spatially
limited results from a subset of workers and assume they
are representative of the larger unsampled workforce. This
assumption may not always be valid; in practice, it is
difficult to select a representative subset of individuals to
sample because the concentration distributions in a room are
unknown. Before choosing a subset of workers to sample,
a larger homogenous group is usually created based upon
similarities in the tasks they perform and in the local envi￾ronments in the rooms where they work (1). The local envi￾ronment is important because contaminant flow patterns are

strong determinants of exposure; however, environmental
similarity is difficult to predict. Data on ventilation systems
and airflow patterns are usually lacking and individuals
selected for sampling may not be truly representative.
If a device is placed in a fixed location of a room to
obtain an area sample, or a direct reading instrument is
carried throughout an area to attempt to characterize flows,
the results relate only to the physical location or path of the
sampling device. Strategies for placing area samplers assume
that locations with the highest or most relevant concentra￾tions are represented and that the areas between the samplers
are of less importance. In practice, this assumption is diffi￾cult to support; however, industrial hygienists use this infor￾mation to guess the dispersion patterns of chemicals for
the regions in the room between the area samplers. The
assumptions and decisions currently made using spatially
and temporally limited air sampling may not be valid; air
concentrations are quite variable during the day due to
changing ventilation patterns, the movement of people in a
space, fluctuations in source emissions, and differences in
work practices among people.
Temporal resolution is important for understanding
and effectively controlling the generation and transport
of contaminants in air, for identifying chemical interme￾diates produced during a process, for locating leaks, and
for monitoring chemicals that are acutely toxic. Ideally,
sample results would enable us to construct a complete
spatial and temporal profile of the flow of air contaminant
concentrations for an entire day, week, or season. This would
require an enormous number of real-time measurements to

be concurrently obtained throughout an area. This is rarely
performed. While real-time instruments can be used to
provide good temporal resolution of concentration fluc￾tuations, the number of chemicals that an instrument can
accurately measure at one time is usually limited.
It can be particularly challenging to evaluate exposures
and the flow of contaminants in outdoor environments such
as animal facilities, landfills, oil refineries, and neighbor￾hoods adjacent to factories. In these situations, exposure vari￾ability will be high and will be impacted by meteorological
conditions.
In addition to the above limitations, air sampling is usually
performed infrequently, and information about daily, weekly,
or monthly variability is lost. Most industrial hygiene inves￾tigations involve short campaigns of one or two days. Thus,
insufficient data are currently being used to evaluate the
impact of industrial emissions and indoor air contaminants
on the health of workers and residents in the community.
Computed tomography (CT) also called computer
assisted tomography (CAT) is a promising method for
both the occupational and environmental field and has the
potential to provide both spatially and temporally resolved
estimates of contaminant concentrations noninvasively (does
not pump air out of a space through collection media), and in
real-time, over large areas. This technique combines the real￾time chemical detection methods of optical remote sensing
(ORS), such as an open-path Fourier transform infrared
(OP-FTIR) spectrometer, with the mapping capabilities of
CT (2–17). This environmental CT system generates near
real-time spatially and temporally resolved two-dimensional
concentration maps of chemicals at low limits of detection
(ppb–low ppm) for an entire area. Not just another nifty
tool, this technology represents a major departure from
conventional industrial hygiene air sampling methods and
could allow researchers to understand and evaluate human
exposures, source emissions, chemical dispersion indoors,
airflow patterns, and chemical transport in ways that are
unavailable using conventional methods. This technique
provides a powerful tool for visualizing air contaminant
species, concentrations, and flows in industry and outdoors
in the community (see Figure 1).
CT is best known for its use in medical X-ray absorption
imaging where it is a well-established diagnostic technique.
With traditional X-rays, a person is placed between an X￾ray machine and the photographic film. The X-ray machine
sends radiation through the body at a single angle which
results in a two-dimensional image on the film. The resulting
image appears as if you are looking through the body and the
structures of the body are superimposed making it difficult to
distinguish individual organs.
In contrast, for CT scanning, the scanner looks like a large
box with a tunnel in the center. The patient lies on a table
that slides them in and out of the tunnel (see Figure 2). What
makes CT scanning unique is that the scanner rotates around
FIGURE 1 Example of a two-dimensional concentration map of
a chemical at one height in a room. The peak heights represent the
concentrations of the chemical at specific locations in the room. The
diameters of the peaks represent dispersion of the chemical.
FIGURE 2 An example of a commercial medical CT scanner.
the patient and thousands of X-rays are sent through the body
at many angles resulting in a 360∘ image (see Figure 3). To
reconstruct a three-dimensional image, the ring of X-rays
around the body is sequentially moved to adjacent planes
of the body. In essence, adjacent wafer-thin cross-sectional
slices are obtained through a body, like slices through bread.
The resulting images reveal body structures in great detail.
The origin of the word “tomography” is from the Greek word
“tomos” meaning “slice” or “section” and “graphe” meaning
“drawing.”
The first commercial clinical X-ray CT scanner was
introduced in 1972 by EMI Ltd. under the leadership of
Hounsfield (17). In the beginning, it took several hours to

and then rotates around the body to obtain measurements at many
angles. The outer ring holds the detectors.
acquire the raw data for a single scan or “slice” and then it
took days to reconstruct a single image from this raw data.
Over the years, scan time has significantly decreased and
the technique has evolved to become one of the most essen￾tial methods of radiological diagnosis. CT systems can now
collect up to four slices of data in about 350 ms and recon￾struct images from millions of data points in less than a
second.
In medicine, tomography is usually used to find small
abnormal features, such as tumors, within the known features
of the human anatomy. Therefore, to achieve high spatial
resolution, a large number of rays must be used.
The principles behind medical CT scanning are appli￾cable to many other fields. While the overall concept is the
same, the CT systems differ in layout and design, due to the
different application types and requirements. CT for environ￾mental air sampling of chemicals involves using a remote
sensing system that can obtain a network of concentration
measurements at different angles across a space, usually
through one plane. Instead of sending rays through a body
to reconstruct organs and anomalies, rays are sent through
the air to measure contaminants. The network of measure￾ments is then processed using a tomographic reconstruction
algorithm to generate a tomographic concentration map of a
slice through the air.
Each tomographic concentration map provides a snap￾shot, which represents a short time period (minutes), of
the concentration and location of contaminant plumes in a

slice or plane through the air (see Figure 4). As measure￾ments are obtained over the day, the reconstructed concen￾tration maps can be linked together to provide a powerful
tool for visualizing the flow of air contaminants over space
and time. Thus, a video of concentration fluctuations, for
single or multiple chemicals, can be created for a room or
area. Using a CT system for industrial hygiene monitoring,
multiple locations throughout a room are quantified simulta￾neously, reducing the need to first determine the few impor￾tant hot spots to sample. For example, Figure 5 shows a
series of tomographic concentration maps of a tracer gas
released over time, in one location, in an exposure chamber
(18). If this was a workplace, and an integrated sampler
was placed in the assumed highest concentration area, the
industrial hygienist would have missed significant concen￾trations accumulating in other areas. The concentration maps
generated with this CT system provide a powerful way to
track the rapid movement of chemicals in the room. When
maps are combined with ventilation measurements, tracer
gas releases, information on process changes and workload,
meteorological data, or information on the movement and
location of workers in a room, the combined information
can be used to quantify chemical emission rates, evaluate
the effectiveness of ventilation systems, and track human
exposures. With this environmental CT system, concentra￾tions can be resolved in near real-time for an entire area
with far fewer measurements than would be necessary, to
obtain the same level of detail, using conventional point
samplers.

1.1 History of Applying Tomography
to Environmental Sampling
The use of tomographic techniques dates to 1917 with
a paper by mathematician Radon (19). He proved that a
three-dimensional object could be reconstructed uniquely
from the infinite set of all its projections (line integrals
along the particular measurement path). CT has been used
in astronomy for producing maps of microwave radiation
emitted from the sun (20, 21), imaging of nuclear fuel
pin bundles (22), optics (23, 24), and electron microscopy
for complex biomolecules (25–28). However, its greatest
achievement and progress has been in the field of medicine,
where cross-sections of the human body are reconstructed
from a large number of X-ray attenuation measurements
through the section of the body of interest (28–31).
In industrial hygiene or environmental air sampling, CT
reconstructs chemical concentrations, and plume shapes.
This could be an advantage because occupational and
environmental scientists are interested in large structures
(plumes) rather than small structures within the large
structures (tumors in the body). However, there are some
challenging differences when applying CT to air sampling:
1. Instead of using X-rays, optical rays must be used that
can safely, noninvasively, and in near real-time monitor
chemical concentrations across a space.
2. In medical CT a person can easily be placed inside a
device that houses the X-rays; however, in air sampling,
a large area, a room, or outdoor space cannot as easily
be encircled by remote sensing instruments.
3. Appropriate ORS instrumentation must be available for
indoor monitoring of chemicals across an open space.
4. People, equipment, or building structures all restrict
the number and symmetry of available line-of-sight
measurements.
5. In contrast to most organs in the body, chemical
concentrations are constantly fluctuating in both time
and space.
6. The signal-to-noise ratio of available ORS instrumen￾tation limits data acquisition speed.
7. The current cost of ORS equipment limits the number
of instruments and associated hardware that can be
used. To be feasible, the use of CT in air sampling
must use minimal hardware and still achieve acceptable
results.
8. In indoor applications, often only a very limited
number of path-integrated measurements can be
obtained. When a limited number of beams from a few
projection angles are used, artifacts such as streaking
and distortion can be encountered in the reconstructed
gas concentration map. Reconstruction errors that
arise due to insufficient data are usually called aliasing
distortions. It is important to use a reconstruction
algorithm that minimizes aliasing distortions when a
limited amount of data is available.
98COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
The first investigations applying CT to air pollution were
in 1979 and 1982, when Byer et al. (32, 33), and Wolfe
and Byer (34), described a theoretical laser-based system
for measuring air pollution on an urban scale. Artificial
concentration profiles were generated on a computer, and a
simulated CT system was evaluated which used a circularly
symmetrical set-up of laser fan beams. A circle of mirrors
was used to reflect the laser fan beams across kilometer
distances to detectors; thus, the mirrors created multiple
virtual laser sources. These studies suggested rather complex
virtual source beam set-ups (geometries) that required many
mirrors and detectors. Consequently, the optical systems
proposed in these studies would be difficult to align or main￾tain. The use of multiple detectors made the system costly,
hardware intensive, and posed calibration and equipment
maintenance difficulties. To date, these and other practical
considerations have prevented the application of CT to large￾scale (>1 km) ambient air pollution monitoring.
The first investigation of the application of CT to indus￾trial hygiene was in 1990 when Todd and Leith (8, 9)
performed a theoretical study using computer-generated
static chemical profiles and a simulated CT system. This
study showed the feasibility of applying CT to indus￾trial hygiene by successfully reconstructing concentration
profiles composed of overlapping bivariate Gaussians, using
a simulated CT system with as few as four projection angles.
An equal angle parallel projection geometry was used in
these initial studies that had optical sources and detectors
on three sides of a square room (see Figure 6). For a 40 by
40 foot room, this geometry placed one detector per foot
along the side of the room. This geometry was chosen for
its simplicity and applicability to various workplace layouts.
As shown in Figure 6, the acute angle that the light beam
makes with the room width is called the projection angle. A
projection is defined as all the parallel, equally spaced light
beams with the same projection angle. For every positive
acute angle, its negative counterpart is used. From 4 to
12 projection angles were evaluated using stationary test
data. In these initial computer simulation studies, the mean
percent errors for reconstructing the highest concentrations
of plumes decreased (from 9% to 0.3%) as the number of
projection angles increased (from 4 to 12), respectively.
In addition to the relatively low quantitative errors, the
reconstructed concentration maps were visually similar to
the original concentration maps. Although this geometry is
not practical given the current remote sensing instrumenta￾tion, these studies were important for showing that CT is
a feasible technology to apply to reconstructing chemical
concentrations. The number of projections used was orders
of magnitude fewer than required in other applications.
Considerable progress has been made in this application of
CT for measuring chemicals in indoor and outdoor air. There
have been many theoretical and experimental studies, and
a few field studies (2–15, 35–41). Progress in using CT to

and +45.
measure aerosol distributions in air has been slower (42–44).
Outdoors, this technology is being applied to measuring
emission rates of chemicals, such as ammonia, off of waste
lagoons from intensive swine facilities, emissions from
landfills, emission from volcanoes, and industrial chimneys
(5, 17, 39, 45–47).
2 DESIGNING COMPUTED
TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEMS
As applied to air monitoring for chemicals, CT is the process
of measuring a spatial concentration profile of a plane
through a room using a network of line-integrated concen￾tration data. The plane could be horizontal or vertical; the
horizontal plane would primarily be used for the industrial
hygiene application (see Figure 7). In theory, one or more
rotating ORS instruments, such as a tunable diode laser or an
OP-FTIR spectrometer can be placed in an area, along with
mirrors, detectors, and/or retroreflectors, to create a network
of remote sensing optical beams. Retroreflectors return an
optical beam directly back to its origin. As the ORS instru￾ment scans the area, it measures the integrated concentra￾tions of contaminants present in the volume of each scanned
beam path. Using a tomographic algorithm, a computer
takes all of the one-dimensional path-averaged measure￾ments and produces a two-dimensional estimate (map) of the
concentrations and locations of the chemicals in the sampled

plane (31). The tomographic map can be generated in a
matter of minutes on a personal computer. The strategy is to
obtain reconstructed concentration maps whose ray sums are
similar to the measured ray sum data. The degree of spatial
resolution (ability to differentiate between peaks) that can be
reconstructed using the maps depends upon the number and
orthogonality of the ORS beam paths for a given size area.
The number and spatial placement of beams are partially
determined by the type of ORS hardware. Constraints placed
on the geometry of the CT system can translate into insuffi￾cient measurements, a limited number and range of angles
and, ultimately, into artifacts in the reconstructed maps.
To obtain a network of open-path measurements, with the
currently available instrumentation, each ORS instrument
sequentially scans the air; thus, each open-path measurement
is taken at a different point in time.
Therefore, if geometries use a high density of rays, the
overall time required to scan an area can be very long. Given
that concentrations are in flux, this introduces inconsistencies
in the data that adversely affects reconstruction accuracy. The
degree of temporal resolution that can be obtained depends
upon the ORS instrument measurement time for each indi￾vidual beam, and the time required to completely sample an
area. To map concentration profiles in flux, accurately, the
time required to sample the entire room (due to ray density
and measurement time) must be balanced with the movement
of air contaminants. Each complete set of ray measurements
must be obtained very quickly to minimize data inconsisten￾cies and to capture short-term fluctuations in concentrations
and peak exposures. Using a given geometry, the choice of
reconstruction algorithm can impact the spatial and temporal
resolution of concentrations and the overall accuracy of the
reconstructed maps.
Some of the decisions faced when using CT in industrial
hygiene include:
1. Selecting appropriate reconstruction algorithms.
2. Designing and testing optimum remote sensing geome￾tries.
3. Generating test concentration data to evaluate the CT
system.
4. Selecting appropriate image quality measurements to
evaluate the reconstructed concentration maps.
5. Selecting appropriate remote sensing instrumentation.
The quality of the reconstructed concentration maps
determines the ability of scientists to use the maps
for exposure assessment, source monitoring, and leak
detection.
Scientists need to be able to use the reconstructed maps to
answer specific questions such as:
1. What are the quantities of chemicals leaking from an
industrial process or emitted from an industry?
2. Where are the chemicals leaking from?
3. What quantities of chemicals do people potentially
inhale?
4. What are the chemical dispersion patterns in air?
In general, when developing a measurement system using
CT, both the geometry of the ORS equipment and the
reconstruction algorithm must be tailored to the specific
application and evaluated using computer simulations and
laboratory experiments before they are deployed in the field.
Computer simulation studies are an efficient way to design
and evaluate potential ORS algorithms and geometries for a
specific industrial hygiene application. This is accomplished
by using a computer simulation program and a battery of
appropriate test concentration maps to simulate the entire CT
process from data acquisition to reconstruction of concentra￾tion maps. Test maps are high-resolution grids that represent
a room or area; each cell in the grid is assigned a concen￾tration. Test concentration data should model reality, test the
limits of the system, and include as many potential sources
of error as possible. Although static concentration maps can
be used, time-varying images provide a more rigorous eval￾uation of an algorithm or geometry. Time-varying images
are sets of multiple maps that represent spatial and temporal
100COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
changes in concentrations of single or multiple chemicals in
air. These test maps are usually computer generated because
temporally and spatially resolved field data do not usually
exist. It is important to use a variety of test concentration
profiles to evaluate how well the reconstructed maps can
perform specified tasks relevant to the application (48–50).
2.1 Test Concentration Maps
The test concentration profiles should be generated on a grid,
which represents the sample site; the resolution of the test
map grid (number of cells) should be a minimum of two to
four times the density of the resolution of the final recon￾structed map. The level of spatial detail needed for the appli￾cation determines the resolution of the final grid. Test maps
are then fed into a simulation program and synthetic open￾path data are created by back calculating the measurements
from the maps. Test maps that have been used in simulation
studies include: (i) Kriged experimental point sample data
from studies using an exposure chamber (static maps); (ii)
CT maps reconstructed from chamber studies using a proto￾type CT system (static or time-series maps), and (iii) static
and spatially and temporally varying data generated using
dispersion models (3, 4, 51, 52). Static maps can be used
for preliminary tests; however, they should include a range
of peak numbers, peak concentrations, and plume diameters.
Static maps cannot reveal the impacts of temporally changing
concentration profiles. Time-series maps can be created with
varying source generation and decay rates, diffusion coeffi￾cients, air velocities, source locations, and source intensities
for single and multiple contaminants. Figure 8 shows time￾series maps, which model the movement and decay of a
single contaminant source.
2.2 Image Quality Parameters
To evaluate CT geometries and algorithms, it is necessary
to quantitatively and qualitatively (by visual assessment)
compare the reconstructed concentration distributions with
the true (test maps) concentration distributions. Quantitative
measures that can be used in computer simulation studies
include nearness, peak exposure error, peak height error,
peak location error, and projection data distance. It is impor￾tant to use a variety of quantitative measures because they
evaluate different uses for the maps, and geometries and
algorithms may not be ranked the same by all the measures.
For example, nearness measures overall reconstruction accu￾racy and could reflect the presence or absence of artifacts.
In contrast, exposure error measures how well the highest
concentrations are reconstructed and would not necessarily
be related to how well the shape of the peaks are recon￾structed.
2.2.1 Nearness
Nearness describes the discrepancy between the true and
the reconstructed concentration map on a cell-by-cell basis
and is a global measure of the errors over all the cells in
the map (53–56). Nearness is a dimensionless number; the
smaller the nearness the better the agreement (see Eq. (1)).
Nearness should only be compared between maps with the
same number of grid cells. Nearness can only be used on
experimental data where the true concentration distribution
is known.

where, cj

“true” map, cj is the concentration of the jth grid cells in the
reconstructed map, cavg* is the mean concentration of all the
grid cells in the “true” map, and N2 is the total number of
grid cells in the map.
2.2.2 Peak Location Error
“Peak location error” was developed to reflect how accu￾rately a reconstructed map pinpoints the location of a chem￾ical leak or emission source (9). It is the root mean square
(RMS) difference in the location of the peaks in the original
and reconstructed maps (see Eq. (2)). For example, for a 40
by 40 m area, reconstructed on a 40 by 40 grid, a location
FIGURE 8 Example of time-series maps showing the movement of contaminants over time. The peak height represents the concentration
of the chemical and the area represents the spread of the plume.
101PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
error of two would be equivalent to a distance of 2 m. The
significance of this error is related to the level of accuracy
required to pinpoint the plume. For example, if one were
only interested in locating the general area of a leak, a coarse
approximation would be required.
Peak Location Error = √
(x − x∗)2 + (y − y∗)2 (2)
where, x is the x coordinate of the location of the peak in the
reconstructed map, x* is the x coordinate of the location of
the peak in the test map, y is the y coordinate of the location of
the peak in the reconstructed map, and y* is the y coordinate
of the location of the peak in the test map.
2.2.3 Peak Exposure and Peak Height Error
A measure of peak exposure error was developed to reflect
the error in estimating the average concentration of a chem￾ical inhaled by a person (2). Most occupational exposure
limits for chronic toxicants are based upon averages of
concentrations over time. Therefore, using time-series maps,
concentrations can be averaged over an extended time frame
(see Eq. (3)). In addition, the spatial movement of the worker
can be simulated and the appropriate size footprint can be
factored into the equation.

the exact location of the peak or through the path that the
worker travels, cj
* is the concentration of the jth cell in
the test map, and cj is the concentration in the jth cell in the
reconstructed map.
Peak height error uses Eq. (3); however, space would
represent a small window only around the location where the
peak is at its highest. For static maps, the time factor would
be removed.
2.2.4 Projection Data Distance
Projection data distance, Eq. (4), is a measure of how closely
the reconstructed ray sums match the original ray sums (55).
A data distance value of zero implies a perfect match.

and, M is the total number of rays.
2.2.5 Visual Assessment
Visual evaluation of the reconstructed maps is the most
useful method for evaluating CT geometries and algorithms.
Although it is time consuming and subjective, it allows the
finest distinctions to be made between geometries and algo￾rithms, and it models what the industrial hygienist will be
using in the field. Visually comparing surface plots of the
reconstructed two-dimensional maps with the original maps
is the most direct way to discern differences in peak loca￾tion, peak shape, and peak resolution, and document the
generation of artifacts. Artifacts can include unpredictable
irregularities that look like noise, patterns such as streaking,
and false concentration peaks. Artifacts and streaks can result
in underestimation or overestimation of concentrations in
the maps. By understanding artifact generation, industrial
hygienists can determine the situations where geometries and
algorithms might fail in the field and can use the information
to design more robust geometries and algorithms. False peaks
and streaking could be due to an uneven placement of rays
and sparse sampling. The video of reconstructed concen￾tration maps can be evaluated as to how well dispersion,
concentrations, and plume contours are reconstructed.
3 CT ALGORITHMS FOR THE
INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE APPLICATION
Many different tomographic reconstruction algorithms have
been proposed for CT applications: the three main types
are analytic (30, 57), back-projection (58–60), and iterative
methods (20, 28, 56, 61). Analytic techniques are used in
most commercial medical CT scanners; however, they may
not be the best algorithms to use for reconstructing chem￾ical concentrations where data is sparse and angular coverage
is limited. Iterative methods, for example, may yield better
performance in industrial hygiene applications where there
are incomplete data, nonsymmetric ray geometries, limited
angular coverage, and noise due to nonstationary chemical
profiles. Iterative methods allow flexibility in the placement
of remote sensing equipment in a room and allow constraints
to be imposed on reconstructed measurements (60, 62). Some
of the algorithms that have been used when applying CT to
reconstructing concentrations include algebraic reconstruc￾tion (4, 9) smooth basis function minimization (13, 14) and
non-iterative LTD (63) techniques.
Bayesian approaches may be particularly suited for recon￾structing chemicals in air because they allow investigators
to incorporate a priori knowledge about the source being
102COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
measured. When the data is limited and noisy, prior infor￾mation can be of as much importance as the data. Many
chemical gas concentrations and fluid flows are controlled by
turbulent diffusion and thus characterized by smooth shapes.
Including a prior information can force the solution to have
smooth shapes implicitly which makes the algorithm less
sensitive to measurement noise. These methods make a trade￾off between matching the measured data and regularizing the
solution, by prior information, resulting in smooth images.
These include smooth basis function minimization (SBFM)
(13, 14, 64), the low third derivative (LTD) (65), and the
modified low third derivative (LTDm) (63, 66, 67).
A single algorithm may not be appropriate for all air
contaminant applications. An algorithm that can accurately
pinpoint leaks might not provide the most accurate estimates
of overall environmental concentrations. An algorithm used
to reconstruct rapidly changing concentration distributions
may not be applicable for a region with near steady-state
concentrations. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and
refine an algorithm for a given application. Some of the algo￾rithms that have been used in industrial hygiene applications
will be described below.
3.1 Iterative Methods
Iterative methods can be considered as brute force methods to
solve image equations. Using iterative methods, an idealized
measurement space, such as a room, is broken into an N by N
grid of cells. Figure 9 shows a 10 by 10 grid of 100 cells. Each
cell, j, is assigned a concentration cj, which is assumed to be
uniform and nonnegative. Ray sums are line integrals (path￾integrated concentrations) of cj along various paths through
the room. The rays have a finite width and, therefore, are

approximated by strip sums. The relationship between cell
concentrations and ray sums can be expressed as Eq. (5),
pi = ∑aijcj, i = 1 … M, j = 1 … N2 (5)
where, pi is the ray sum at projection angle Θ, aij is the
weighting factor representing the contribution of jth cell to
the ith raysum, cj is the density function for the jth cell, M is
the total number of rays, and N2 is the total number of cells
in an N by N grid.
Equation (5) represents an array of M equations and N2
unknowns. For reconstructing chemical concentrations, typi￾cally a sparse geometry is used and the number of equations
is far fewer than the number of unknowns. In addition, time
constraints are placed on the sampling that generate incon￾sistent data. Therefore, iterative approaches have been used
to solve these equations rather than using matrix inversions.
3.1.1 Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques (ART)
For ART1, an initial guess is made of the values in all the
cells in the grid; based on this guess, the first path-integrated
ray concentration is calculated. The values of all the cells that
the ray passes through are then corrected so that the calcu￾lated ray sum equals the measured ray sum. The correction
procedure is shown in Eq. (6) and is repeated sequentially for
each ray. With this algorithm, the weights of all cells through
which the ray passes are assigned a value of one, and the
weights of all cells through which the ray does not pass are
assigned a value of zero. One iteration is completed when
all the ray sums have been corrected. The ART1 algorithm is
terminated after a fixed number of iterations, such as 10, or
by using a stopping criterion, such as the fractional change
in the variance of the reconstructed concentration map, from
one iteration to the next (54, 55).

The ART3 algorithm is based on the premise that a precise
solution to Eq. (5) is generally impossible because the pis are
physical measurements that contain measurement error (68).
Therefore, ART3 finds a solution to the inequalities shown
in Eq. (7) and uses the same correction scheme as in Eq. (6).
However, the equations have to be satisfied only within a
tolerance, which is estimated from prior knowledge of the
experimental conditions and errors.

where, 𝜀i is an allowed tolerance.
103PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
For ARTW, the initial guess and correction procedure is
the same as ART1; however, the weights of each cell, for a
given ray, are proportional to the average length of the ray
through the cell. The average length of a ray in a cell is
calculated by estimating the area of the cell covered by a ray
and dividing it by the width of the ray, which can be assumed
to be one-cell width wide.
SIRT (simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique)
uses Eq. (6) to determine the change in the jth cell; however,
the value of the jth cell is not changed until all of the
differences in the ray sums are calculated. At the end of each
iteration, the cell concentrations are then changed once using
an average value of all the corrections that would be made to
that cell.
SART (simultaneous algebraic reconstruction techniques)
(69–71) makes cell corrections similar to SIRT; however,
average corrections are applied to each cell after calculations
are made for all ray sums in one projection. Therefore, when
four projection angles are used, four averages are applied to
each cell in an iteration.
MART (multiplicative algebraic reconstruction tech￾niques) is similar to ARTW; however, cell corrections are
updated by a multiplicative adjustment scheme that maxi￾mizes an entropy function (72). The correction in the cell
estimate is equal to a relaxation factor raised to the power
of the ratio of the measured raysum and the back-projected
raysum. In MART, like ART, the cell estimates are corrected
one ray at a time.
3.1.2 Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization
(MLEM) Algorithm
Maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) is
a simultaneous iteration technique that corrects all the cells
at once after an entire set of ray sum data is obtained in
each iteration (73, 74) (see Eq. (8)). The correction factor
for a cell is equal to the sum of the ratios of the reprojected
values of the cells and the backprojected values of the cell. In
MLEM, the cell estimates are corrected taking into consid￾eration all the projections simultaneously. MLEM is usually
allowed to iterate longer than the ART algorithms.
Cj(n + 1) = (
cjn∕
∑tij)
∗
∑(

(8)
where, Cj(n) is the concentration in jth cell after the nth
iteration, ∑tijcjn is the reprojection of the image estimate cjn,
and ∑tijpi is the backprojection of the projection array.
The concentration distribution is estimated by using the
maximum likelihood criterion, which is given by Eq. (9),
ln L(C) = ∑{
−
∑tijcj + pi ln (∑tijcj
)
− ln(pi)
}
(9)
where, L(C) is the likelihood of generating the image C, tij
is the transfer matrix from image cell j to set of parallel
projections i, cj is the concentration at cell j, pi is the raysum
for the ith set of projections, i is the number of rays, 1 to M,
and j is the number of cell, 1 to N2.
The likelihood strictly increases at each step unless it is
at a maximum; therefore, all the cells have positive values of
concentration.
3.1.3 MLEM and Grid Translation
In the above iterative methods, the reconstruction grid has a
fixed, single basis resolution (N by M). The concentration in
each cell is assumed to be homogeneous, nonnegative, and
is updated with each iteration. One limitation of choosing a
fixed single reconstruction grid resolution is that the loca￾tion of the edges of each of the grid cells in relation to a
particular peak position and shape could adversely impact
reconstruction accuracy. For example, if a peak in the orig￾inal high-resolution map is distributed across multiple grid
cells, the highest value that is reconstructed in these cells can
severely underestimate the actual peak value. A grid transla￾tion (GT) method has been developed to be used with MLEM
to improve upon this limitation (75). In the GT method, this
problem is overcome by not just using the (single) basis grid
for reconstruction, but an additional number of translated
grids as well.
With the GT method, reconstructions are performed on a
number of different grids rather than on a fixed single grid.
The basis grid is the same as used in the single grid methods
and the additional grids are formed by translating, in both
the horizontal and vertical direction, over distances equal
to a fraction of a basis grid cell size. After the determined
number of MLEM iterations on each of the translated grids,
the resulting “interim” concentration maps of each of the
grids are combined into one final map of higher resolution.
3.1.4 MLEM: Grid Translation-Multigrid (GT-MG)
The grid translation-multigrid (GT-MG) method improves
upon the previous GT method. The GT-MG method starts
with a very coarse resolution 2 by 2 basis grid. GT is then
used to generate additional grids starting with this 2 by 2 grid.
After the determined number of translations are performed
using MLEM, a final combined higher resolution map is
obtained.
Next, the basis grid resolution is increased to 3 by 3 cells.
The initial concentration values used in the 3 by 3 grid are
calculated from the final combined map generated from the
2 by 2 basis grid. Iterations are then performed on the new
set of grids, resulting in a new final combined map. The
method proceeds by incrementally increasing the basis grid
resolution, applying the GT method and then using the final
map of the previous (lower) basis grid resolution to set the
initial concentration values in the new grids (76).
104COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
3.2 Smooth Basic Function Minimization
(SBFM)
The previous algorithms did not assume anything about the
underlying concentration profile except that it is nonnega￾tive and the concentrations are homogeneous in discrete grid
cells. SBFM does not artificially create a grid of cells and
assumes a priori information about the underlying concen￾tration profile by modeling the data with smooth basis func￾tions (bi-variate Gaussians defined in the x-y plane) (13, 14).
3.3 Non-iterative Low Third Derivative
(LTD) Method
The LTD method was developed for indoor applications and
reconstructs the concentration field by trading off matching
the measured data and regularizing the solution, by prior
information, to result in smooth images. In this approach,
the estimate is the most probable image given the measured
path integrals, prior information of the image solution and
a statistical model of the data acquisition. In the LTD
algorithms, one prior information is that the third spatial
derivative of concentration is assumed to be close to zero,
resulting in locally quadratic concentration profiles (65–67).
For example, the third-derivative (change per pixel) between
two adjacent pixels c(r, k) and c(r, k+1) is described by
Eq. (10).
𝜕3c

|r,k→r,k+1
= c(r, k + 2) − 3c(r, k + 1)
− 3c(r, k) − c(r, k − 1) = 0 (10)
In a modification of this method, called LTDm (63), an
extra constraint is placed on the reconstructed concentration
field. It states that pixels contained within beams whose
path integral is under a certain cut-off limit (e.g. under
the detection limit of the system) are forced to assign a
concentration value of zero or close to zero.
4 SIMULATION STUDIES OF
RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS
Rigorous testing should be performed when developing or
modifying algorithms because they are based on different
mathematical foundations which could make them sensi￾tive to different types of ORS geometries and concentration
profiles.
Todd (4, 9) has studied iterative algorithms using both
simulated concentration data and data obtained from proto￾type CT systems placed in an exposure chamber. In general,
MART and MLEM performed the best, followed by ARTW,
ART1, ART3 and then SIRT and SART. For the ART
algorithms, reconstructions were improved by using a more
accurate weighting scheme to allocate the concentration
corrections (ARTW). While MLEM and MART were
similar, MART performed better when the concentration
profiles had broad peaks, and MLEM performed better for
rapidly changing concentration profiles. Regardless of the
type of algorithm, most peaks were reconstructed within one
foot of their true position using both static and time-series
test maps. With these traditional iterative methods, peak
exposure errors ranged from 25% to 50% using time-series
maps and 8% to 15% using static maps.
Using the newer GT and GT-MG methods, visually,
reconstructions of the peaks were significantly improved
over single grid reconstructions, see Figure 10. In addition,
the peak exposure errors were reduced by as much as 40%
and 85% over using the traditional MLEM reconstruction
algorithm. These methods provide a significant improvement
over traditional methods for reconstructing chemical plumes
in air. In particular, this improvement is important for coarse
resolutions. Given the sparse remote sensing configurations
that must be used in industrial hygiene applications, the
ability to produce high-resolution maps with few measure￾ments is significant. This improvement is achieved without
artificially interpolating additional optical rays and without
using any assumptions about the underlying resolution or the
number of peaks in the map.
Comparison of algorithms performed in numerical simu￾lations by different researchers can be tricky because results
depend not only on the algorithm but also on the beam
set-up and the test distributions. Keeping this in mind,
studies by Cehlin (63) using LTDm show promise for recon￾structing chemical distributions in air. Using LTDm, the
agreement between tomographic reconstructions and test
maps were similar to the performance using the GT-MG
algorithm developed by Verkruysse and Todd (75, 76). The
LTDm showed excellent reconstruction quality for single￾peak profiles; for maps with three peaks or sharp gradients,
the quality was reduced.
5 ORS GEOMETRIES FOR CT IMAGING
OF CHEMICALS IN AIR
The geometry of a CT system involves the placement of
the open-path instrumentation (optical sources, detectors,
mirrors, or retroreflectors) in or around a room. In theory,
because concentrations in a room are really not discretized
into cells, an ideal geometry would be symmetrical and
would completely flood the room with an infinite number
of optical rays that span a wide range of angles. Sampling
each cell identically (number and orientation) means that the
reconstruction result is more or less independent of the loca￾tions of the gas sources and peaks. However, this is may not

FIGURE 10 (a) Original test maps with three peaks are shown in the left column. Corresponding reconstructions using the single grid

always be realistic. In practice, limitations are placed on the
geometry due to the layout of rooms or area, purpose of the
sampling, ORS instrumentation, monetary resources, and
the need to quickly measure spatially changing concentra￾tion profiles. Estimates of how many equally spaced angles
are needed for good resolution vary, and are specific to the
application (24, 77).
Symmetry is important to ensure that all areas of the
room are sampled equally; symmetrical geometries yield
better quality reconstructions than asymmetric geome￾tries. Unequal sampling can result in artifacts, streaking,
and distortions of the images. Unlike medicine, reflected
rays can be used in the application of CT to industrial
hygiene. Reflected rays can improve reconstruction accu￾racy by adding orthogonal rays to the geometry and increase
coverage. Reflected rays are created by using mirrors to
reflect rays across a space to a retroreflector that returns the
beam directly back to its point of origin. However, mirrors
are difficult to align quickly and to maintain alignment in
the field. In contrast, retroreflectors are easy to align and
maintain alignment; but, they are currently very expensive.
As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of remote
sensing instruments results in better reconstruction quality
because the angular coverage of the beams is increased, and
multiple measurements can be taken within a short period
of time. The most critical factor in designing geometries is
the independence of the optical beams; by maximizing the
angular separation between the different ray projections or
rays, independence is maximized. With only a few remote
sensing instruments, independence can be maximized by
creating parallel reflections at many angles.
The higher the density of rays in a geometry, the higher
the reconstruction resolution. However, when reconstructing
nonsteady state plumes of contaminants, a trade-off exists
between the ray density and the rate at which the rays are
obtained. When using CT for industrial hygiene sampling,
the airflow and contaminant generation conditions deter￾mines the point at which increasing the density of rays dete￾riorates reconstruction quality because of the increase in the
overall sample rate.
5.1 Simulation Studies of Geometries
To use a traditional equal angle parallel projection geom￾etry (ideal) in a room, hundreds of detectors would be placed
along a wall. With the currently available ORS instrumenta￾tion, this set-up would be very expensive. A more feasible
set-up involves the use of a scanning, fan-like beam geom￾etry. For example, an entire OP-FTIR spectrometer or a
portion of the optics is placed on a 360∘ rotating base. One or
more of these spectrometers are placed in a room, and they
sequentially scan the room shooting light at retroreflectors or
receiving light from optical sources. When there is only one
spectrometer, multiple mirrors are used to reflect light across
the room to create a network of intersecting rays.
Todd (10, 16, 78) has extensively studied many different
CT geometries designed with from one to four scanning
remote sensing instruments (see Figure 11). Some of the
geometries had optical beams with only straight lines of
sight, others also used mirrors to reflect the beams across the
room to retroflectors in order to increase spatial coverage.
When two or more scanning instruments were used, they
were placed along the walls of the rooms and scanned a range
of 0∘–180∘. When one instrument was used, it was placed
in the center of the room and it scanned a range of 360∘.
Simulations were performed using both static and time-series

test concentration maps; each time-series map represented
changes in concentrations every 15 seconds over simulated
three-hour time periods.
Geometries were designed on a 20 by 20 grid and used a
total of 120 rays. Therefore, one, two, three, and four ORS
instruments used 120, 60, 40, and 30 rays per instrument,
respectively. It was assumed that the time required to take
each ray was equivalent regardless of the geometry. There￾fore, the greater the number of instruments, the shorter the
time required to sample an entire room.
Using the time-series maps, geometries with four instru￾ments were superior and reconstructed maps that were
quantitatively more accurate, visually smoother, and had
fewer artifacts, than geometries with fewer instruments.
The geometries using a single instrument in the center of
the room with reflected rays gave very poor reconstructions
with the time-series maps that simulated a high airflow.
Large streaks were present in the reconstructions, radiating
from the grid center where the instruments and the peaks
were co-located. Peaks appeared jagged, there was streaking
along some of the ray paths, peaks were poorly located and
concentrations were significantly overestimated. One of the
single instrument geometries both simulated parallel projec￾tions with reflected rays and used additional straight rays
(see Figure 11b). Even with this geometry, reconstructions
were poor using maps that simulated high airflow in the
room. However, for low airflow simulations, this geometry
reconstructed the maps very well and equivalent to the
four-instrument geometry. The importance of using a variety
of time-series maps is illuminated by the results using a
single instrument. When the static maps were used, several
of the single instrument geometries had quantitative and
qualitative results equivalent to the three and four instru￾ment geometries. Park et al. (36) also tested similar single
instrument geometries. In their studies, they only used static
test maps generated from a bivariate normal distribution
model and from experimental chamber data. Their results
were similar to the Todd and Bhattacharyya (3) study using
static maps.
When using time series maps, differences in the recon￾struction quality can occur because of the difference in the
times required to scan an area completely. For example, if
120 rays in total are used, and if it takes 15 seconds for
each ray measurement, the four, three, two, and one instru￾ment geometry could require 7.5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes
to sample the room once, respectively. The difficulty that
the single instrument geometries had with reconstructing
the time series maps was due in part to the increased time
required to obtain a complete set of rays relative to the
spatial and temporal changes in concentrations. If the overall
sample times are made equivalent, then the geometries which
have a higher density of orthogonal rays will produce better
reconstructions. In practice, there is a limitation to the speed
that each ray measurement can be taken. The faster the
measurement of the chemicals, the lower the signal-to-noise
ratios, and higher the chemical limits of detection.
An alternative to decreasing measurement time by
reducing instrument measurement time is to use fewer
optical rays. For a four-instrument geometry, when 30,
40, or 80 rays per instrument were used to scan a room,
the smaller the number density of rays, the lower (better)
the nearness, data distance, and exposure errors (2). When
using 30 rays, exposure error improved over using 40 rays.
The reconstructed maps using 30, 40, and 80 rays were
visually very similar to each other; however, peak heights
for reconstructed maps using 30 rays were closer to the
original map than reconstructed maps using 40 or 80 rays.
These simulations indicate that coarser sampling may be
a better means of tracking changing concentration profiles
over time than using finer sampling.
In general, most of the geometries tested could locate the
highest concentration points in the peaks within a few grid
cells. As the ventilation rates increased, nearness and peak
location errors increased (worse). As the number of detectors
increased, peak location and exposure errors decreased; the
four-instrument geometry had mean location errors of two
grid cells and mean exposure errors of 12–15%. The number
of concentration plumes had a greater adverse impact on
reconstruction quality than the diameter and concentration
of the peaks. The diameter of the concentration peaks will be
a limitation when the density of rays is so sparse that the rays
miss the peaks.
5.2 Chamber Studies of Geometries
Several research groups have evaluated CT for industrial
hygiene by using pilot CT systems in exposure chambers and
comparing tomographic map concentrations with concentra￾tions obtained from point samples taken in the chamber.
Samanta and Todd (7, 37) tested a prototype CT system
that used a single Midac open-path FTIR spectrometer
(MIDAC Corporation, Irvine, CA) on a translatable table that
was placed on a track along the periphery of the chamber.
With this set-up, one instrument was used to simulate four
instruments; a single OP-FTIR spectrometer scanned the
chamber from many different angles to create a network of
open-path measurements. Two configurations were tested,
one with two instruments on each of two sides of the chamber
(136 rays) and one with one instrument on each of four sides
of the chamber (100 rays). The chamber was divided into
a grid of 120 cells, with each cell being one square foot.
The chamber was equipped with a point sampling system
that collected tracer gas samples from specific points in the
chamber directly above the beam.
Single and multiple plumes of sulfur hexafluoride were
generated vertically up from the floor of the chamber.
During the experiments, open-path measurements and

point samples were obtained over approximately 1.5 hours.
Recently, a rapid scanning system was developed which
uses two rotating monostatic Midac spectrometers and two
rotating mirrors, to obtain a total of 48 rays. The rotating
mirrors act as virtual spectrometers to create four OP-FTIR
spectrometers. However, only two instruments are operating
at a given time (see Figure 12). Using this set-up, a complete
set of open-path measurements was obtained every seven
minutes.
For the chamber experiments, the tomographic recon￾structed concentration maps were compared with the point
sample maps created by kriging the point samples. Recon￾structions were performed using MART and MLEM. In
almost all of the experiments, regardless of the geometry,
the CT system reconstructed the location of the plumes
within one foot. The geometry using 136 rays reconstructed
multiple peaks better than the geometry using 100 rays. This
may be due to the fact that the 136-ray geometry has a
greater angular range of coverage than the 100-ray geom￾etry. The rapid scanning system was successful at mapping
rapidly changing plume concentrations. Using the rapid
scanning system, the peak concentrations in the tomographic
maps were within 14%, of the concentrations in the point
sample maps (79, 80). Figure 13 shows reconstructions of
single and multiple source experiments. In these figures,
the time-averaged point sample map is compared with the
seven-minute CT reconstruction. The reconstructions agreed
closely with the point sample maps.
Yost et al. (12) performed chamber studies using a
single OP-FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Corp,
Wisconsin) mounted on a translatable table, to simulate a
parallel projection geometry with four projection angles
(36 rays). Acetone was released in the chamber and three
hours were required to complete the CT scans and obtain
the point samples. Maps were reconstructed using an ART
algorithm. While the peaks were located correctly, there was
a large discrepancy between the concentration of the peaks
reconstructed with the tomographic and point sample maps.
This may have been due to fluctuating concentrations and
airflow patterns in the chamber, and a very sparse geometry.
Additional studies by Drescher et al. (14, 15) used a rapidly
scanning system that had a single scanning OP-FTIR spec￾trometer in the center of a chamber, one retroreflector in each
of the four corners the room, and 52 flat mirrors on the walls.
This geometry had 56 optical rays with an overall sampling
time of six minutes. Using this geometry and the SBFM
algorithm, the tomographic maps were very similar to the
point sample maps and quantitatively agreed to within 50%.
More recently a single OP-FTIR spectrometer was placed
on a turntable to generate a set of rays of different lengths. In
chamber studies using a robot to simulate a person, personal
exposures were estimated using the OP-FTIR spectrometer
(81, 82).
Bingham et al. (83) designed a multi-spectral infrared CT
system incorporating quantum cascade laser modules using
a modified MLEM reconstruction algorithm. The goal is to

eventually provide an efficient, deployable system that will
provide long-term spatial information about gasses present
in air. This research provided an initial proof-of-principle
small scale laboratory test of the system using methane as the
tracer gas. In these qualitative experiments, they were able to
reconstruct plume shapes. They are now working on follow￾up fieldwork.
Grauer et al. (84) developed a CT system that uses broad￾band transmittance measurements. Broadband systems may
provide chemical reconstructions via low-cost, commercially
available OP detectors. Many of these devices are also
intrinsically safe, and could, therefore, be used at industrial
facilities without modification. However, broadband trans￾mittances are a nonlinear function of the gas burden. There￾fore, to apply CST reconstruction techniques to broadband
transmittances, new methods are required to process the
measurement data. This research tested the system in a small￾scale laboratory experiment using propane as the test gas and
a 35-beam, four-projection orthogonal measurement grid.
The CT reconstructed propane concentrations were broadly
consistent with the FID point sample measurements.
One of the problems encountered in laboratory valida￾tion studies is that a noninvasive, real-time, spatially resolved
technique is compared to invasive point samples taken at a
different height and time frame than the optical beams. In
addition, the point samples must be processed, such as by
kriging, to obtain spatial concentration maps. This can intro￾duce errors. Thus, differences in concentrations between the
methods may be due in part to technical problems associated
with differences in the sampling methods.
6 FIELD STUDIES
A small-scale CT system was used in an outdoor study to
compare tomographic results with dispersion models and to
calculate chemical emission rates (5). This pilot environ￾mental CT system used two scanning OP-FTIR spectrom￾eters and eight retroreflectors and was deployed on a 70 by
70 m field. Sulfur hexafluoride was released at known rates
from a simulated volume source and was measured at various
points in the study field with the use of a network of Tedlar®
bag point samples.
This highly underdetermined system was used to recon￾struct concentration maps in near real-time for the entire field
site. The concentration maps were compared with model
maps with respect to plume location and plume shape.
For many of the reconstructed time periods, the shapes,
110COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
locations, and directions of the plumes in the reconstructed
tomographic maps compared fairly well with the model
predictions. For almost all of the time periods, the concentra￾tions in the tomographic maps were higher than the concen￾trations in the model-generated maps. For the periods where
the maps did not agree, the wind direction was found to be
rapidly and repeatedly shifting. One of the reasons for this
could be the fact that the model used average wind condi￾tions to generate concentrations, whereas the CT system took
measurements sequentially and in real-time. The CT system
may have more accurately captured real-time variability.
The first large-scale field implementation of a CT system
was performed at an intensive swine confinement operation
to measure ammonia and other contaminants generated from
a waste lagoon (47). The CT system operated every day for
up to 24 hours a day for several weeks over three seasons.
Two monostatic OP-FTIR spectrometers were placed on
360∘ rotating platforms, on opposite sides of a six-acre swine
waste lagoon, each within 1 m of the surface of the lagoon.
This created a horizontal network of infrared rays. Twelve
metal retroreflectors were positioned around the periphery
of the lagoon, see Figure 14. The OP-FTIR spectrometers
sequentially scanned the retroreflectors, and both spectrome￾ters operated simultaneously. Total path lengths ranged from
132 to 426 m. A sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas was released
from the center of the lagoon at a known emission rate and the
network of rays simultaneously monitored ammonia, other
waste gases, and the tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride, every
two minutes. Concentration maps of the gases were gener￾ated for the entire lagoon surface. The system was operated
remotely from computers that were located in a van; the
FIGURE 14 Top image is the open-path FTIR configuration
over the swine waste lagoon. Bottom image is a map of a recon￾structed sulfur hexafluoride plume.

entire system was connected using fiber optic cables. Except
for replenishing the liquid nitrogen during the day to cool the
detectors, the spectrometers were operated without supervi￾sion. The tomographic maps revealed that the concentration
of ammonia varied widely over the surface of the lagoon, and
was not homogeneous as is the assumption when using point￾sampling devices for these types of sources. This was an ideal
application of CT. Using conventional point sampling equip￾ment only a few locations can be easily sampled on a lagoon.
In comparison, the CT system can measure a relatively large
area. Figure 15 shows CT concentration maps for ammonia
for three seasons.
Gases and aerosols released to the atmosphere by eruptive
and noneruptive volcanic activity can affect both the envi￾ronment and human health. Among the major components
of volcanic emissions, sulfur dioxide (SO2) can cause severe
damage to vegetation and is harmful to humans, especially
those who are prone to respiratory illnesses. Remote sensing
techniques combined with CT may be a viable substitute
for conventional point sampling measurements which can
111PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
be dangerous to obtain because they are taken from within
the volcanic plume where there are toxic gases. In addi￾tion, while in situ methods allow for accurate estimation of
concentrations, they are spatially limited to the vicinity of the
specific measurement points.
Measuring volcanic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates,
as a tracer for other gases, is one pathway towards forecasting
increased volcanic activity, such as seismicity or eruptions.
Field studies were performed of volcanic gas plumes at the
Campi Flegrei volcano in Italy, to measure emissions (85)
using computed tomographic as a way to predict volcanic
activity. These studies used a portable hard-target differential
absorption lidar (DIAL) system to obtain the path integrated
concentrations of CO2. The resulting tomographic maps
were found to be in satisfactory agreement with indepen￾dent measurements of CO2. Carbon dioxide fluxes retrieved
from the 2-D maps were comparable but modestly higher
than emission rates found from previous studies.
CT was used to reconstruct SO2 concentration distribu￾tions in the volcanic plume of Miyakejima, Japan, using an
airborne traverse technique (86). In this study, three compact
UV spectrometers were mounted on a helicopter. The heli￾copter flew under the volcanic plume about 10 km downwind
from the caldera of Miyakejima volcano. The instruments
were aimed at three different zenith angles, enabling simul￾taneous measurements of SO2 path integrated concentra￾tions in three different directions. The LTD algorithm was
used to reconstruct the plumes from the remote sensing
measurements. The SO2 path-integrated concentration data
obtained by the three spectrometers were interpolated and
formatted evenly at spatial intervals of 100 m. Each set of
measurements took two minutes to obtain and maps were
reconstructed that were five minutes apart. The horizontal
and vertical widths of the maps were 6 and 3 km, respec￾tively. The horizontal and vertical widths of the reconstructed
plumes were about 3 and 1–1.5 km, respectively. The recon￾structed concentration data was found to match observed
data. The shapes of the plumes reconstructed after each
traverse were quite different from each other in spite of the
short time intervals between traverses (five minutes).
Burton et al. (87) reconstructed two-dimensional cross￾sections of SO2 in the volcanic gas plume of Mt. Etna in Etna,
Sicily. The data for the projections were generated using
a network of five scanning ultraviolet spectrometers, posi￾tioned on the flanks of the volcano. The maps were recon￾structed using the SART algorithm. A month-long sample
data set collected in June 2008 was selected for testing the
tomographic reconstruction algorithms. The volcanic SO2
flux was determined from each tomographic reconstruction
by multiplying the sum of all the pixel concentrations, the
cross-sectional area of a pixel and the component of the
measured wind speed. This was compared with the SO2 flux
obtained directly from the network. The results showed a
good agreement between the tomographic maps and the raw
network data.
Communities that live next to major industries such as
refineries and petrochemical plants can be exposed to emis￾sions of hazardous air pollutants. Many of these communities
may already have compromised health problems because
they may be economically disadvantaged. Adequately moni￾toring community exposure from these emissions is impor￾tant for protecting health and can pose challenges when using
conventional air sampling methods.
The combination of remote sensing using the long￾path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS)
technique and CT was used during a 2015 Benzene and
other Toxics Exposure (BEE-TEX) field study. The goal of
BEE-TEX was to establish cost-effective, state-of-the-art,
neighborhood-scale monitoring networks in the Houston
Ship Channel and other areas of high toxic emissions around
the country (88–90). The tomography was performed in
the Manchester neighborhood beside the Ship Channel of
Houston, Texas for an entire month. Two geographically
separated sets of LED sources were used to generate over￾lapping light beams that were reflected back by an array
of mirrors encircling the community of interest toward
detectors co-located with the light sources. The multiple
overlapping light paths made it possible to generate CT
concentration maps using the ART reconstruction algorithm.
The LED light sources and DOAS detectors were
mounted on scaffolding towers across the main entrance of
a refinery. Reflectors were mounted on a scaffolding tower,
on guard rails of a Bridge, and on telescopic towers along
the southern end of Manchester between 15 and 25 m above
ground level. DOAS light paths were sampled sequentially,
with a total measurement cycle time for all light paths of
roughly 30 minutes.
The CAT scan network detected large nocturnal plumes
of toluene and xylenes most likely associated with railcar
loading and unloading operations at the petrochemical facil￾ities. The presence of such plumes during railcar opera￾tions was confirmed by a mobile laboratory equipped with
a proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometer (PTR-MS),
which measured transient peaks of toluene and benzenes of
50 and 57 ppb, respectively. Plume reconstruction and source
attribution results derived from DOAS CAT scans compared
reasonably well with corresponding results derived from
mobile PTR-MS measurements despite the low number of
light paths that were operational during the campaign.
7 BACKGROUND OPTICAL REMOTE
SENSING INSTRUMENTATION
In theory, any remote sensing instrument can be used to
perform CT in industrial hygiene as long as it can quickly
112COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
and safely measure path-integrated concentrations of chem￾icals in air along an open-path. Lasers, such as tunable
diode lasers, have high scanning rates and offer the ability
to sample the air over very long pathlengths (kilometers);
however, they are usually limited to one or a few gases and
may present an eye safety hazard (91–96). OP-FTIR spec￾trometers have primarily been used outdoors, in fenceline,
air pollution, and hazardous waste applications, where one
instrument with a long pathlength is needed (97–100). For
indoor air monitoring, OP-FTIR spectrometers have advan￾tages over lasers in that they can measure a wide range of
multiple chemicals at low limits of detection (ppb–ppm) and
they pose a low eye-safety hazard (101–111). OP-FTIR spec￾trometers, and DOAS are the main instruments that have
been used thus far for applying CT to industrial hygiene
and environmental (17, 39, 90) monitoring. For industrial
hygiene, OP-FTIR is most commonly used, so they will be
described here.
7.1 OP-FTIR Spectrometer Design
OP-FTIR spectrometers typically use a remotely placed
optical source to transmit an infrared (IR) beam across the
open air to a detector. Chemicals present in the optical path
are measured in near real time, and concentrations are inte￾grated over the entire length of the optical path, to obtain
path-averaged concentrations.
The OP-FTIR spectrometers are operated in two different
configurations: bistatic and monostatic (see Figure 16).
These configurations differ in the transfer optics and the
number of times that the IR beam passes through the air.
In the bistatic mode, the IR source is placed at the opposite

end of the optical path from the detector (can be greater
than 500 m apart), and the IR beam passes through the air
once. In the monostatic mode, the IR source and detector
are co-located at one end of the path, and the beam is sent
out to a reflector placed at the other end of the path. In the
monostatic mode, the reflector (flat mirror, corner cube,
or cat’s eye retroreflector) sends the light directly back to
the detector, and the IR light passes through the air twice.
Telescopes can be used to collimate, send and receive the
IR beam to and from the spectrometer to the retroreflector
(monostatic systems) or to receive the IR light at the detector
(bistatic systems). Telescopes may not be necessary when
short path lengths are used for indoor workplace or exposure
chamber applications.
7.2 Theory of Operation
OP-FTIR spectrometers use IR absorption to identify and
quantify hundreds of chemicals in air. IR absorption tech￾niques are based on the principle that compounds selectively
absorb energy in the IR region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. When molecules absorb incident electromagnetic
radiation at specific wavelengths, the energy can boost
electrons from their ground state to an excited state, or cause
the molecules to stretch, bend, or rotate (112, 113). With
the exception of elements, inorganic salts, and diatomic
molecules (oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine), most substances
absorb in the IR region.
In the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spec￾trum (4000 to 400 cm−1), absorption usually occurs at several
different wavelengths of IR light, which results in patterns or
bands. This pattern of energy absorption, called the absorp￾tion spectrum, creates a unique fingerprint for each molecule
and can be used to identify the chemical. Figure 17 shows
an absorption spectrum for ammonia. Small differences in
chemical structure can result in large differences in absorp￾tion spectrum. To identify a compound, the number, location,
and shape of absorption bands in a spectrum are compared
to a reference spectrum for the same chemical. A reference
spectrum is created using known concentrations of the chem￾ical of interest under controlled conditions of temperature
and pressure. The pattern of absorption is used for identi￾fication of compounds and the intensity of the spectral bands
is used for quantification.
Quantification is performed by selecting a wave number
region in the absorption spectrum of the gas that ideally
is free from interferences from other contaminants. Within
constraints, there is a linear relationship between the inten￾sity of the spectral bands and the concentration of the
compound. This relationship is based on Beer’s Law which
states that at a constant path length, the intensity of the IR
energy diminishes exponentially with the concentration of

Absorption = −log(I∕Io) (13)

where, I is the intensity of IR light when the absorbing
chemical is present, Io is the intensity of IR light without
the absorbing chemical present, a is the molecular absorption
coefficient of the chemical, C is the concentration of the
chemical and, L is the path length of the IR radiation through
the chemical.
To measure concentration, the intensity of the IR light
with and without contaminants must be obtained and
converted to an absorption spectra (see Eqs. (11)–(14)).
Background spectra (Io) are generated either using ambient
air that does not contain target contaminants or are gener￾ated synthetically. The primary challenge facing users of
open-path FTIR spectrometers is the acquisition of a clean
background spectrum (105, 114).
An interferometer is the optical device used in OP￾FTIR spectrometers to scan simultaneously and rapidly
(seconds) the entire mid-IR region. An interferometer can
achieve high spectral resolution (the ability to distinguish
between absorption bands of compounds), high specificity,
high signal-to-noise ratios, and low limits of detection (ppb)

(115, 116). One type of interferometer is the Michelson inter￾ferometer (see Figure 18) (113). An interferometer consists
of a beam splitter, a stationary mirror, and a moveable
mirror. They are orthogonal to each other. A Nernst glower,
which emits broadband electromagnetic radiation, is used to
generate IR light. The IR light travels to the beam splitter
which divides the light into two beams of equal intensity;
one half of the light is sent to the moveable mirror and one
half is sent to the fixed mirror. After hitting the mirrors, the
114COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
beams recombine at the beam splitter and exit to the detector.
When the moving mirror and the fixed mirror are at the same
distance from the beamsplitter, the IR light beams reflected
off the mirrors are in phase with each other, and all the wave￾lengths of light constructively interfere in the recombined
beam. This results in the highest intensity of light for all
possible mirror positions. When the moving mirror moves
along the optic axis, the half of the optical beam which hits
the moving mirror travels a shorter distance than the optical
beam which hits the fixed mirror. At any mirror position, the
intensity of light is governed by constructive and destruc￾tive interferences in the recombined beam. When the light
recombines it hits the detector and a signal is recorded; the
pattern of constructive and destructive interference is called
the interferogram, and depends upon the wavelengths of
light present in the beam. Using an IR broadband radiation
source, the incident IR radiation contains many wavelengths.
Therefore, at each position of the moving mirror, the signal
recorded by the detector is an integral of the intensities of all
the wavelengths of light. The interferogram is a plot of light
intensity vs. optical path difference (mirror position) and is
used in all subsequent analyses.
To create absorption spectra, first the interferogram is
converted to a single beam spectrum by using appropriate
software to perform a fast Fourier transform. Two single
beam spectra (sample and background) are then ratioed to
get a transmission spectrum (see Eq. (12)), and an absorption
spectrum is generated by taking the negative logarithm of the
transmission spectra (see Eq. (13)). Absorption (Eq. (14)),
is proportional to the concentration of the chemical and
the distance (path length) that the light travels through the
chemical. Therefore, the longer the path length that the
IR light travels through the air containing the compound
of interest before it reaches the detector, the greater the
sensitivity and the lower the limits of detection.
7.3 Quantification
Quantitative analysis can be performed using a variety of
methods including measuring peak height, measuring peak
area, spectral subtraction, partial least squares, iterative
least squares, and classical least squares (CLS). CLS is
most commonly used to match the measured spectra to a
library of calibration reference spectra for the chemicals of
interest (115–118). When the concentrations of chemicals
are measured, they are integrated over the entire length of
the optical path and are reported as the product of concen￾tration and path length (ppm–meters). The ppm–meter
concentration is then divided by the path length to obtain a
path-averaged concentration (ppm).
The resolution of an OP-FTIR spectrometer refers to
the minimum separation in wave numbers that two absorp￾tion features can have and still be distinguished from one
another. Typical OP-FTIR spectrometers used for environ￾mental CAT scanning have minimum resolutions of 0.5 and
1.0 wave numbers; the higher the resolution, the lower the
wave number. At any resolution, the OP-FTIR spectrometer
can average individual measurements (scans) over time to
decrease the SNR signal-to-noise ratio). For tomographic
imaging spectrometer measurement rates should be mini￾mized to reconstruct concentration profiles with multiple
peaks or with rapidly changing concentration profiles.
Therefore, measurements should be made at the lowest
possible wavenumber resolution that adequately resolves
spectral features of chemicals in the air because as resolu￾tion increases, scan time increases. In general, the SNR is
directly proportional to the resolution, and to the square root
of the measurement time; doubling the resolution doubles
the noise.
8 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
An innovative measurement technology for environmental
air sampling has emerged to allow visualization of the
spatial distribution of chemical concentrations over time. By
combining ORS technologies with CT, spatially and tempo￾rally resolved two-dimensional concentration maps would
be produced for a room or area. These maps could be used
to evaluate pollutant dispersion in a workplace, characterize
human exposures, support fundamental modeling research,
and locate fugitive emissions (75). There may always be limi￾tations to this method due to sparse sampling in a room or
outdoor area, and lack of symmetry in beam geometries due
to available lines of sight for the optics. This could translate
into concentration measurement errors. For example, how
can CT maps be used if the measurements are taken above
the breathing zones of workers? However, the ability to use
a tomographic system over hours, days, and weeks in one
workplace, might result in more accurate estimates of human
exposures than currently available technology using limited
numbers of point samples taken sporadically over time. Once
installed, a CT system could run continuously at low cost.
This method has great potential monitoring exposures
outdoors as well. Chemical concentrations and flux measure￾ments can be obtained over large areas or areas which
are hazardous to measure by other methods. Tomographic
networks may be a viable way to increase the spatial and
temporal coverage of air pollution monitoring networks for
both regulatory and scientific applications, especially in
industrial fenceline communities. With miniaturization of
instrumentation, they may be able to be placed on unmanned
aerial vehicles for obtaining measurements.
In order to implement and improve this technology,
several opportunities remain. These include extensive field
validation studies, development of robust reconstruction
115PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
algorithms, development of improved geometries for a
variety of workplace designs, miniaturization and increased
ruggedness of open-path instrumentation, and expansion of
the technique to three three-dimensional tomography. With
less expensive and smaller instrumentation, the number of
beam paths can be increased considerably resulting in better
reconstructions.
For three-dimensional tomography, networks of inter￾secting path integrated concentration measurements would
be obtained through the air at several heights and angles over
an area using the ORS system. CT algorithms process the
measurements as they are obtained in real-time to reconstruct
three-dimensional chemical concentration maps. These maps
are a set of concentration values on a series of cross-sectional
2D grids or sets of horizontal and diagonal rays to represent
the 3D grid. These maps would reconstruct the volume of air
contaminants not just a single slice. Ultimately, reconstructed
concentration maps need to be evaluated in user studies in the
field with industrial hygienists.
A major improvement to current reconstruction algo￾rithms is the multigrid reconstruction technique described
before as well as Bayesian methods. These methods could
be further developed to alter the size of the reconstruction of
grid cells in real-time to address peaks of different sizes and
at different positions in a room. Therefore, in areas of low
concentration, where information is not important, or there is
high uncertainty, larger cells can be used. A fine grid of cells
can be used in areas near people, sources, or high concentra￾tion gradients.
To date, researchers have worked with fixed CT geome￾tries. Another improvement is a dynamic geometry. A tech￾nique is being developed which, in real-time, pinpoints the
regions of high concentrations and adapts the density of
the rays to follow the movement of the plume. The use of
adaptive ray sampling could improve reconstructions by opti￾mizing the position of the rays. Researchers have used adap￾tive techniques in signal processing (119), image processing
(120, 121), and CT (122), to achieve improved sampling
of sharp spatial changes in objects. An adaptive sampling
technique is being developed that selectively acquires ray
measurements from the highest concentration regions in a
room at finer intervals compared to the lower concentration
regions. For example, retroreflectors could be evenly spaced
along the walls of the room. The CT system would generate
an initial tomographic map, and this map would be used to
alter the geometry in real-time to reposition the rays. Thus,
the density of rays would be increased where there is high
information content and would be reduced in places of low
concentrations. Reconstruction accuracy can improve when
only a few additional optical rays are placed through the areas
of highest concentration (8).
With improved and less expensive ORS instrumentation,
it will be possible to increase the accuracy of reconstructions
as well as move to three-dimensional tomography in indoor
air. This will greatly enhance the usefulness of this technique
for industrial hygiene. One improvement to OP-FTIR spec￾trometers is the development of multichannel systems that
use segmented open-path beams. With segmented beams,
a single fan beam would actually be comprised of many
individual beams that would simultaneously hit an array of
retroreflectors. Therefore, multiple ray sum measurements
would be obtained simultaneously rather than sequentially
when using a scanning OP-FTIR spectrometer. This could
reduce sampling times from minutes to seconds. In addition
to ORS instrumentation refinements, low-cost retroreflector
arrays need to be developed to allow flexibility in geom￾etry design. The use of segmented fan beams and low-cost
retroreflector arrays will enable three-dimensional mapping
of an area quickly.

120MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR
CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS

1 INTRODUCTION
In the past decades, physical–chemical mathematical models
have gained acceptance as an exposure estimation method
for occupational indoor air contaminants (1–3). Although
direct air sampling is preferred traditionally, there are situ￾ations in which monitoring is not feasible, that is where the
interest concerns: (i) past exposure levels generated by a
process that has been discontinued, (ii) future exposure levels
for an operation under consideration, and (iii) future expo￾sure levels during an accidental release. Mathematical
modeling, given appropriate input information, can be
used to estimate exposures in the past, present, or future.
Mathematical modeling fits well at multiple stages of the
industrial hygienists’ mission to anticipate, recognize, eval￾uate, control, and confirm exposures, including helping prior￾itize our monitoring activities (the highest predicted expo￾sures are monitored first) or deciding whether monitoring a
particular operation is warranted. In such cases, mathemat￾ical modeling can be used to estimate exposure intensity.
Because mathematical modeling is theoretical and based
on explicit assumptions, some occupational hygienists may
believe that modeled exposure estimates are too uncertain
to be reliable. However, due to the substantial variability
in air contaminant exposure that can pertain across time
and across individuals performing the same type of work,
exposure estimates made via air sampling are also uncertain.
In fact, air sampling should involve a statistical approach
such that one collects numerous air samples over time and/or

individuals, where the time periods and/or individuals are
chosen according to a random selection process that elim￾inates investigator bias. In practice, few measurements
are obtained, and the periods/subjects chosen for moni￾toring usually are often based on convenience. The latter
circumstance violates an explicit assumption underlying the
statistical analysis of air monitoring data, namely, that the
periods/subjects monitored are chosen by a random selec￾tion process. The relative accuracy of exposure estimates
made by modeling versus monitoring has been discussed
elsewhere (4). The purpose of this chapter is not to explore
the pros and cons of different exposure estimation methods,
but to present some useful physical–chemical mathematical
models.
The three elements of a physical–chemical model are
(i) the instantaneous chemical mass emission rate function;
(ii) the pattern of chemical dispersion in air; and (iii) the
location of the worker (receptor) relative to the point(s) of
contaminant emission. Depending on the dispersion pattern
assumed (item (ii)), the location of the worker (item (iii))
may not be relevant. These three items are discussed below.
2 CHEMICAL EMISSION RATE
FUNCTIONS
The instantaneous emission or generation rate is often
denoted G(t) and has the units of mass time−1. When a
constant rate is assumed, the notation G(t)= G is used.
121PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
2.1 Constant Rates
Although emission rates usually vary with time, assuming
a constant emission rate is reasonable if we want to esti￾mate an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) expo￾sure level and are not concerned with short-term expo￾sure intensity and variability. In some cases, a material
mass balance can be used to estimate a constant emission
rate. For example, if we know the solvent mass that evap￾orates during a time interval T, the “constant” emission
rate is
G (mgmin−1) =
Mass emitted (mg) into air in the interval
T (min)
(1)
A problem studied by several investigators is the vapor
emission rate from a pure liquid with a fixed surface area
and temperature, as would apply to an open surface tank
or a large pool of liquid (5–8). An algorithm developed by
Hummel et al. (6) for predicting a constant emission rate in
this scenario is

where MW is the molecular weight of the chemical
(g mol−1), Pv is the vapor pressure of evaporating
chemical (Pascal, Pa), Patm is the atmospheric pres￾sure (Pa) (1 atm =101 325 Pa), A is the surface area
of the liquid pool (m2), L is the surface length of the
liquid pool (m), U is the airspeed over the liquid pool
(m s−1), and T is the temperature of the liquid (K)
(K =273.15+∘C).
The length of the liquid pool, L, is the longest dimension
of the surface. For example, if an open tank has surface
dimensions 2 m × 1 m, then L=2 m. Air is presumed to move
in the same direction as the longest length aspect.
A third scenario involving constant emission is molecular
diffusion from an open bottle. The neck of the bottle is
a diffusion path of length 𝛿 (m) not subject to turbulent
air motion and has cross-sectional area A (m2). For a pure
chemical, the chemical concentration in the bottle headspace
(at the start of the diffusion path) is assumed to equal the
chemical’s saturation concentration in air, Csat (mg m−3).
The latter concentration is computed based on the ideal gas
law as follows:
Csat (mgm−3) =
1.605 × 104 × Pv × MW
T (3)
where Pv is the chemical’s vapor pressure (mmHg) at temper￾ature T (K), and MW is the chemical’s molecular weight
(g mol−1).
It is assumed that once molecules reach the top of
the bottle’s neck (at the end of the diffusion path), they
are immediately dispersed into room air such that the
chemical concentration at the end of the pathway is essen￾tially zero. The presumed constant emission rate from the
bottle is
G (mgmin−1) =
A × DM × Csat
𝛿 (4)
where DM (m2 min−1) is the chemical’s molecular
diffusion coefficient in air. If a published DM value
is not available, it may be estimated using the Fuller
equation (9):

the ith element in the molecule, vi is the atomic diffu￾sion volume (cm3 mol−1) of the ith element, T is the
air temperature (K), MW is the molecular weight of the
chemical (g mol−1), and Patm is the atmospheric pres￾sure (Pa).
Atomic diffusion volumes for some common elements
are as follows: carbon, 15.9; hydrogen, 2.31; oxygen, 6.11;
chlorine, 21.0; fluorine, 14.7; bromine, 21.9; iodine, 29.8;
sulfur, 22.9; nitrogen, 4.54.
2.2 A Variable Rate
There are numerous variable emission rate functions that
might be considered (10–12). This chapter presents one such
function that has a broad application, namely, the exponen￾tially decreasing emission rate:
G(t) (mgmin−1) = G0 × exp(−𝛼 × t) (6)
where G0 (mg min−1) is the initial rate at time zero, and
𝛼 is a first-order rate constant with the unit min−1. The
mass rate of emission decreases over time. This function
is often appropriate for organic solvent evaporation due to
small spills and application onto surfaces (13), and due to off￾gassing of sorbed chemicals (14). It has been used frequently
in indoor air quality modeling (15–17). The exponential
function applies when there is a finite chemical mass in the
source that is not replenished as mass is lost. If M0 (mg)
denotes the chemical mass in the source at time zero, the
initial emission rate is G0 =𝛼 × M0.
122MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
3 DISPERSION PATTERNS
AND WORKER (RECEPTOR)
LOCATION
Three patterns of contaminant dispersion in room air are
considered. Because the idea of worker (receptor) location
relative to the source is intimately involved in the first two
constructs, the issue of worker location is discussed at the
same time.
3.1 Well-Mixed Room
In a well-mixed room (WMR), the contaminant instan￾taneously and perfectly mixes throughout room air, such
that the contaminant’s airborne concentration is uniform
throughout the room. Worker (receptor) location relative to
the source is not an issue because the exposure level is
assumed the same at all locations. The room parameters
are the volume V (m3) and the supply/exhaust air rate Q
(m3 min−1). Strictly, we should consider only the nonoc￾cluded air volume, which is the total room volume minus
the volume of the solid objects in the room. Because the
occluded volume is usually a small portion (approximately
5%) of the total room volume, this fine point is often ignored.
In addition, if Q is fixed, the effect of increasing the concen￾tration due to emitting contaminant into a smaller volume
tends to be balanced by increasing the contaminant’s exhaust
removal rate from that same smaller volume.
Perfect mixing is physically unrealistic in finite time and
can lead to seriously underestimating exposure intensity for
a worker close to a point source of chemical emission. Still,
the WMR construct provides reasonable exposure estimates
in four situations given somewhat typical air movement for
mixing: (i) for room occupants at some distance from a
point source, say, at greater than 2 m; (ii) for all room occu￾pants about two minutes after emission from a point source
ceases; (iii) for all room occupants if the emissions are from
numerous dispersed point sources or from a large surface
area such as painted walls; or (iv) there is significant mixing
turbulence such as from floor fans used for comfort in the
workroom.
In the WMR construct, one approach involves using
a mixing factor m to account for imperfect air mixing.
The room supply/exhaust air rate Q is multiplied by m
to give an “effective” supply/exhaust air rate QEFF, or
QEFF = m × Q, where 0 < m ≤1. The value m =1 is perfect
mixing, whereas m <1 is imperfect mixing. Some texts
express m in terms of a safety factor K, where K=1/m. In a
ventilation application, if one requires a certain Q value, the
design airflow rate is recommended to be increased K-fold,
or QDESIGN =K × Q.
Although the mixing factor is widely used, in the authors’
view, it should not be used for three reasons. First, the
mixing factor violates the conservation of mass principle
for the chemical in room air and for the airflows in the
room (18). Second, assigning a value for m essentially
involves guessing (19). Third, estimating a value for m based
on measurements of concentration decay over time can still
lead to gross errors (20). Where it is important to account
for imperfect mixing, as in estimating worker exposure
near an emission source, the near-field (NF)/far-field (FF)
construct or a turbulent eddy diffusion construct should
be used.
3.2 Near Field/Far Field
The room is treated as containing two adjacent zones – the
NF zone surrounds the emission source and contains the
breathing zone of the worker whose exposure is to be esti￾mated, and the FF zone is the rest of the room. The respec￾tive NF and FF volumes, VNF and VFF (m3), sum to the
room volume. Air within each zone is perfectly mixed, but
there is a limited airflow between the two zones. Room
supply/exhaust air flows into and out of the FF at rate
Q (m3 min−1). The interzonal airflow rate 𝛽 (m3 min−1)
depends on the conceptual NF geometry (which involves the
worker’s distance from the source) and a random airspeed
s (m min−1) near the source. One study reported that indoor
airspeeds are log-normally distributed with a geometric mean
of 3.7 m min−1 (12 fpm) and a geometric standard deviation
(GSD) of 2 (21).
Figure 1 depicts a hemispherical NF zone centered on an
emission source on a table. The hemisphere’s radius r (m)
is set to include the breathing zone of the worker. The free
surface area, FSA (m2), of the NF is that conceptual surface
Radius
β m3 min–1 β m3 min–1
FIGURE 1 Hemispherical near-field zone centered on an emis￾sion source on a table.
123PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
through which air can flow. For a hemisphere with its base
on a solid surface, FSA =2 × 𝜋 × r2. The interzonal airflow
rate is
𝛽 (m3 min−1) = 1
2
× FSA × s (7)
The factor 1/2 is used because in a small section of the
FSA, air cannot simultaneously flow into and out of the NF
zone. Assuming equality of airflow into and out of the NF
also maintains a mass or volume balance of air in this zone.
This balance is analogous to the equality in the airflow rates
Q into and out of the larger room.
The NF/FF construct leads to predicting a higher chem￾ical concentration in the NF than in the FF, which is the
phenomenon we want to describe. However, a drawback
is that the NF/FF construct predicts a discontinuity in the
concentration across the NF boundary. If predicting a series
of concentrations at different distances from a point source
is important, a turbulent eddy diffusion construct is preferred
because it produces a continuous concentration gradient with
increasing distance from the source.
The NF/FF dispersion construct for exposure estima￾tion was first described by W.C. Hemeon about half a
century ago (22). Several investigators subsequently devel￾oped the same dispersion construct while apparently unaware
of Hemeon’s earlier work. Note that room air can be divided
into more than two conceptual zones such that we create a
multizone model. The need to consider more than two zones
depends on the scenario being modeled and the purpose of
our modeling. Several publications have demonstrated the
utility of the two-zone model (23, 24).
3.3 Turbulent Eddy Diffusion
Turbulent eddy diffusion involves the random motion of
eddies of air that carry chemical molecules (or particles)
away from the source. This dispersion mechanism is distinct
from molecular diffusion that involves the random motion
of individual molecules due to their kinetic energy. Turbu￾lent diffusion is characterized by a diffusion coefficient DT
(m2 min−1). Although DT has the same m2 min−1 unit as the
molecular diffusion coefficient DM, turbulent diffusion coef￾ficients are greater than molecular diffusion coefficients. DM
values are on the order of 0.001 m2 min−1, while DT values
are on the order of 0.1–10 m2 min−1 (1).
Applying this dispersion construct requires specifying the
worker’s location relative to the source. That location can be
expressed as a Cartesian coordinate position (x,y,z) relative
to the emission point which is taken to be at the origin (0,0,0).
However, if there is no advective airflow (the bulk movement
of air in a given direction, on average), an equal concentration
surface is predicted at a fixed distance from the emission
point, and the worker’s location can be expressed as a radial
distance r (m) from the source, where r = √x2 + y2 + z2.
Turbulent eddy diffusion is akin to a three-dimensional
random walk. Consider that time proceeds in small discrete
steps, and that a set of molecules (or particles) is at the
origin at time zero. In one time step, each molecule flips
three coins. The outcome of the first coin flip (heads or
tails) decides which direction to move on the x-axis; the
outcome of the second coin flip decides which direction
to move on the y-axis; and the outcome of the third coin
flip decides which direction to move on the z-axis. The
molecules move in a mutually independent fashion. As time
proceeds, the molecules become dispersed in a symmet￾rical three-dimensional pattern relative to the origin. Of
course, molecules do not flip coins in discrete time steps,
but the mathematical description of the three-dimensional
random walk is the same description applied to turbulent
eddy diffusion.
Now, consider that an advective airflow pattern does
exist in the vicinity of the emission source, which signi￾fies that air is moving in a certain direction and at a certain
speed, on average; in different terms, there is an average
airflow velocity (vector). For example, the average move￾ment might be left to right along the x-axis. The result is
that the molecules (particles) tend to move to the right (in
the direction of the vector), but turbulent eddy diffusion is
superimposed on this movement. With reference to the three￾dimensional random walk, there is a bias in the coin that
determines the direction of movement along the x-axis. If
heads mean “go right” and tails mean “go left,” there is a
greater probability of heads than tails. However, there is still
some chance of moving to the left on the x-axis, and there
is still completely random movement along the y-axis and z￾axis. In the lexicon of random walk theory, the contaminant
undergoes a random walk with drift.
Given turbulent eddy diffusion with advection, contami￾nant dispersion is characterized by a turbulent diffusion coef￾ficient DT and by a mean airspeed U (m min−1) in a specified
direction (usually along the room’s x-axis). Note that the
average airflow vector need not be along the room’s x-axis
and that an average airflow vector can be decomposed into
components along each of the three room axes. The worker’s
location must be expressed as a Cartesian coordinate posi￾tion (x,y,z) relative to the emission source taken to be at the
origin (0,0,0).
4 SPECIFIC MODELS
In general, any emission rate function can be combined
with any dispersion pattern in room air to produce a math￾ematical model. The models most commonly used in occu￾pational hygiene have analytical solutions, which means
there are closed-form equations by which the contami￾nant concentrations are computed. For a model without an
analytical solution, the contaminant concentration is found
124MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
using a numerical method implemented by a computer
program. Some important models with closed-form solutions
are presented below. A numerical method for models lacking
closed-form solutions is available in the literature (25). Note
that the examples used to illustrate the behavior of the models
are hypothetical, and no justification is offered for the speci￾fied input values (V, Q, G(t), etc.). Of course, in a real-world
application, the occupational hygienist must select model
input values that apply to the specific exposure scenario.
4.1 WMR with a Constant Emission Rate
Consider a room with volume V (m3) and supply/exhaust air
rate Q (m3 min−1) that contains a source emitting a chem￾ical at constant rate G (mg min−1). If there are two different
sources emitting contaminant into room air at the constant
rates G1 and G2, respectively, the overall emission rate is
G = G1 + G2. The same principle applies to three or more
sources. In some presentations of the WMR model, an in￾room source emits at rate G1, and the contaminant concen￾tration in the supply air, CIN (mg m−3), provides a second
source at rate G2 = Q ×CIN. The first-order rate of contam￾inant removal from room air via exhaust ventilation is Q/V
(min−1), which is the number of air changes per minute. Let
𝛼L (min−1) denote a possible first-order rate of elimination by
some other mechanism, where 𝛼L ≥0. For example, a chem￾ical vapor may adsorb onto room surfaces, and contaminant
particles can settle onto the floor and room surfaces due to
gravity. Let C0 (mg m−3) denote the contaminant concentra￾tion in room air at time zero, where C0 ≥0. The equation that
predicts the time-dependent airborne contaminant concentra￾tion, C(t) (mg m−3), for t≥0, is the following:
C(t) (mgm−3) = G
Q + 𝛼LV
×
[
1 − exp (
−Q + 𝛼LV

× t
)]
+ C0 × exp (

)
(8)
If the emission process continues for a long time such
that t → ∞, the contaminant concentration reaches a steady￾state value CSS given by
CSS (mgm−3) = G
Q + 𝛼LV (9)
Note that the initial concentration C0 does not affect the
steady-state concentration CSS. If we let G =0 in Eq. (8),
we obtain the classical expression for the decrease in
the contaminant concentration starting from some initial
value C0:
C(t) (mgm−3) = C0 × exp (
−Q + 𝛼LV

Contaminant concentration in mg m−3
FIGURE 2 The well-mixed room dispersion construct with
a constant contaminant emission rate followed by exponential
purging. The input values are V =200 m3, Q =20 m3 min−1, kL =0,
C0 =0, and G =1000 mg min−1 for 0≤t≤90 min. Subsequent to
t =90 min, G =0, and C0 =50 mg m−3.
This is often termed the exponential purging or decay
equation.
Example. Figure 2 depicts the C(t) time series for
a scenario in which V=200 m3 and Q =20 m3 min−1,
such that Q/V=0.1 air changes per minute (= 6 air
changes per hour (ACH)). Over the interval 0≤t≤90 min,
G =1000 mg min−1 for some contaminant, but for t>90 min,
G =0. The only loss mechanism of the contaminant from
room air is the exhaust airflow, in which case 𝛼L =0, and
C0 =0. According to Eq. (8), the expression for C(t) when
G =1000 mg min−1 is
C(t) (mgm−3) = 50 × [1 − exp(−0.1 × t)]
Figure 2 shows that by t=90 min, the concentration
has reached the predicted steady-state value of 50 mg m−3.
When emission ceases and G =0, Eq. (8) pertains with
C0 =50 mg m−3, and the concentration exponentially
decreases toward zero. According to Eq. (10), the expression
for C(t) for t>90 min is
C(t) (mgm−3) = 50 × exp(−0.1 × [t − 90])
The reason that 90 min is subtracted from t in the argu￾ment of the exponent function is to maintain the same zero
starting time for the process.
A Note About First-Order Loss Rates. A first-order loss
rate 𝛼 operates in the following manner. If [t,t+ Δt] denotes
a small time interval, the product 𝛼 × Δt is the fraction of
the quantity (say, contaminant mass) present at time t that
is lost in the interval [t,t+ Δt]. The absolute amount of
125PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
contaminant lost in the interval depends on the mass present
at the start of the interval, but the fraction of mass lost
is always 𝛼 × Δt. First-order loss rates that simultaneously
act on the same contaminant are treated as independent
and additive. For example in Eq. (8), the argument of the
exponent term contains the quotient (Q +𝛼LV) ÷ V. Dividing
by V, we obtain
Overall loss rate = Q
V
+ 𝛼L (11)
The first-order loss rate of contaminant due to airflow
out of the room, Q/V, is added to the first-order loss rate of
contaminant due to a second mechanism, 𝛼L (for example
adsorption onto a surface). Related to this additive property
is proportionality. That is, the fraction of contaminant that is
removed from room air due to one mechanism is the first￾order loss rate due to that mechanism divided by the overall
first-order loss rate. For example, if first-order loss rates due
to ventilation (Q/V) and a second mechanism (𝛼L) act on the
contaminant, then
fraction of contaminant removed by ventilation
= Q∕V
Q∕V + 𝛼L
(12)
fraction of contaminant removed by second mechanism
= 𝛼L
Q∕V + 𝛼L
(13)
In some scenarios, we are interested in the amount of
contaminant lost from room air via a particular mech￾anism/pathway. For example, consider that particles
containing inorganic lead (Pb) are emitted into the air
of a room for which Q/V=0.05 min−1 (or 3 ACH), The Pb￾containing particles have aerodynamic diameter da =5 μm.
A total of 10 mg Pb is emitted into room air. We want
to estimate the Pb mass that settles onto the floor and
other horizontal room surfaces. We proceed by estimating
a first-order loss rate due to gravitational settling from
stirred (well-mixed) room air, denoted 𝛼grav, based on the
expression (24)
𝛼grav = VTS
H (14)
where VTS is the particle terminal settling velocity (m min−1)
and H is the room height (m). An approximate expression for
a particle’s terminal settling velocity is (24)
VTS = 0.0018 d2
a
[
1 +
0.166
da
]
(15)
where da is expressed in μm. For da =5 μm,
VTS =0.0465 m min−1. Consider that the room height is
H =3 m, in which case 𝛼grav =(0.0465 m min−1) ÷ (3 m)=
0.015 min−1. The overall first-order loss rate from room
air is
Q
V
+ 𝛼grav = 0.050 + 0.015 min−1 = 0.065 min−1
The fraction of Pb mass estimated to be lost by gravita￾tional settling is
0.015 min−1
0.065 min−1 = 0.23
Thus, we estimate that 0.23 × 10 mg=2.3 mg Pb settles
onto the floor and/or horizontal room surfaces.
4.2 Well Mixed Room Constant Generation
with Backpressure
A variant of the WMR with constant generation rate can
account for the limitation of generation as the concentration
approaches saturation (11) and does not allow prediction of
concentrations above saturation. This aspect called backpres￾sure has been incorporated in modeling software discussed
later in this chapter (Section 7).

4.3 WMR with Constant Emission Rate
and Local Exhaust Ventilation Removal
and Recirculation of Air
Explicit consideration of local exhaust ventilation (LEV)
removal of the contaminant and recirculation of treated room
air has been developed (26) and described in detail for a
126MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
series of conditions, covering the contaminant generation
phase and purge phase after generation cessation. The formu￾lations include consideration of a cyclic process where the
generation rate operates for less than the full cycle. The most
detailed of the one box steady state equations developed is as
follows:
C = 𝛾G(1−𝜀L𝜀LF)
(Q+𝜀RFQR)+𝜀LFQL
CLE = C + 𝜀L𝛾G
QL
CLR = CLE(1 − 𝜀LF) CRF = C(1 − 𝜀RF)
(17)
where:
C = A “pseudo-steady state” concentration averaged
over the process cycle
CLE = concentration inside the local exhaust (mg m−3)
CLR = concentration downstream of the local exhaust
filtration unit of the LEV system (mg m−3)
CRF = recirculation concentration; concentration
downstream of the filtration unit of the general
ventilation return system (mg m−3)
G = generation rate (mg min−1)
Q = room ventilation rate (m3 min−1)
QL = local exhaust ventilation rate (m3 min−1)
QR = room recirculation system ventilation rate

t = current time (min) or task duration
tg = time of generation for each task (min)
T = task duration; sum of task durations (min)
V = room volume (m3)
𝜀L = fraction of the source emissions immediately
captured by the local exhaust
𝜀LF = local exhaust return filtration efficiency
𝜀RF = general ventilation recirculation filtration
efficiency
𝛾 = fraction of time that the source produces the
contaminant for a task or a series of tasks
The reader is referred to the appendices of the cited
publication (Hewett) for additional details and for the time￾varying concentration equations.
4.4 WMR with a Distribution of Particle
Sizes
The preceding discussion on the WMR segues to estimating
the particulate mass concentration when particles are present
as a distribution of da values, as is normally the case, and not
present in just one size. The distinction is important because
larger particles have greater VTS values and greater first-order
loss rates due to settling. For example, given H =3 m, a
particle with da =1 μm has 𝛼grav =0.0007 min−1, whereas a
particle with da =10 μm has 𝛼grav =0.06 min−1. Therefore,
a single gravitational loss rate cannot be assigned to all the
particles. The solution approach is essentially divide and
conquer. That is, we divide the particle mass distribution into
narrow da intervals (bins) of equal mass, use a representa￾tive da value for each interval, compute the particle mass
concentration for each interval, and combine these concen￾trations across the intervals to get the overall particle mass
concentration.
For simplicity, assume that the count distribution of
particle da values is log normal with a count median aero￾dynamic diameter (CMAD) and a GSD. The mass median
aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is a function of the CMAD
and GSD as follows:
MMAD = CMAD × exp[3 × (ln GSD)
2] (18)
The da value corresponding to a given percentile of the
cumulative particle mass distribution, denoted here as da,P%,
is found by the equation
da,P% = MMAD × GSDzP% (19)
where ZP% is the standard normal deviate (or z value)
corresponding to that percentile. For the tenth percentile,
Z10% = −1.282; for the twentieth percentile, Z20% = −0.842;
and so forth. Standard normal deviate values are available in
every statistics text and statistical software program.
Example. Consider a log-normal distribution of particle
da values with MMAD =4 μm and GSD =2. We divide
the distribution into, say, 10 da intervals of equal particle
mass (more intervals can easily be used). Table 1 shows
the lower and upper limits of the da values (in μm) for the
10 equal mass intervals. The first interval is bracketed by
the zero and the tenth percentiles, the second interval is
bracketed by the tenth and the twentieth percentiles, and
so forth. The upper limit of the 10th interval is equated
with the theoretical 99th percentile (for which Z99% =2.326).
The interval’s representative value is taken as the interval
midpoint. Although it would be better to derive the repre￾sentative value by a mass-weighting approach within the
interval, using the midpoint is adequate for intervals of small
width, as in this example. Table 1 shows the first-order loss
rate due to gravitational settling for each representative da
value given a room height H =3 m. Across the 10 inter￾vals, there is an 18-fold range in the representative da value
(14.9 μm ÷ 0.83 μm), but a 260-fold range in the 𝛼grav value
(0.13 min−1 ÷ 0.0005 min−1).
Next, consider that particulate contaminant conforming
to this da distribution is emitted at the constant rate
G =2000 μg min−1 into a WMR with V=200 m3 and
Q =10 m3 min−1. For each of the 10 da intervals of

Emitted particles with initial MMAD =4 μm and GSD =2 are divided into 10 bins (ranges) of
aerodynamic diameters da with equal mass. Note for these particles, CMAD =0.946 μm. For each bin,
the table lists the upper and lower da limits, a representative da value within the range, the first-order
loss rate due to settling for a particle with the representative da value, and the predicted steady-state
mass concentration in room air. The predicted steady-state aerosol mass concentration is the sum of
the concentrations for the 10 bins.
equal mass in Table 1, the emission rate by definition is
200 μg min−1. Because we know 𝛼grav for each interval,
and because Q is the same for all the intervals, we can use
Eq. (9) to compute the steady-state particle mass concen￾tration in each interval. These concentrations are listed in
the last column in Table 1. The overall steady-state particle
mass concentration is the sum of these 10 steady-state
concentrations, equal to 153 μg m−3.
There are two important limitations of this method for
estimating particulate contaminant concentrations. First,
some aerosols change their size distribution after emission
due to condensation or particle agglomeration, such that
it is difficult to specify a fixed size distribution. Second,
and perhaps more important, relatively large particles
(say, da >10 μm) do not disperse uniformly throughout
room air but tend to gravitationally settle near their point
of emission. The consequence is that using the WMR
dispersion construct leads to overestimating the airborne
concentrations of particles with high da values at receptor
locations distant from the emission source. To handle this
circumstance, the author and collaborators have developed
a modeling technique based on Markov chain probability
theory, although implementation of the technique requires
computer coding (27, 28). The basics of the technique are
outlined later in this chapter.
4.5 WMR with an Exponentially Decreasing
Emission Rate
Consider a room with volume V (m3) and supply/exhaust air
rate Q (m3 min−1) that contains a source emitting a chemical
at an exponentially decreasing rate G(t)= G0 × exp(−𝛼 × t)
in mg min−1. To simplify the calculations, the terms C0 and
𝛼L are not included, although they could be. The equation
that predicts the time-dependent airborne contaminant
concentration, C(t) in mg m−3, for t≥0, is the following:
C(t) (mgm−3) = 𝛼M0
𝛼V − Q
×
[
exp (
−Q
V
× t
)
− exp(𝛼 × t)
]
(20)
As time passes, the chemical concentration increases to a
peak value and then decreases to zero. The time at which the
peak concentration occurs, tpeak (min), is given by
tpeak (min) =
V × ln (𝛼V
Q
)
𝛼V − Q (21)
To compute the peak concentration, we use tpeak in the C(t)
equation.
Example. Figure 3 depicts the C(t) time series for
a scenario in which V=200 m3, Q =20 m3 min−1,
M0 =40 000 mg, and 𝛼 =0.15 min−1, over the interval
0≤t≤60 min. According to Eq. (20), the expression for the
time series is
C(t)(mgm−3) = 600 × [exp(−0.10 × t) − exp(−0.15 × t)]
According to Eq. (21), the peak concentration occurs at
tpeak =
200 × ln (0.15×200
20 )
0.15 × 200 − 20 = 8.1 min
Inserting this time into the C(t) equation yields a peak
value of 89 mg m−3.

4.6 NF/FF with a Constant Emission Rate
Consider a room with volume V (m3) and supply/exhaust air
rate Q (m3 min−1) that contains a point source emitting a
contaminant at constant rate G (mg min−1). The NF zone
surrounding the source has volume VNF (m3), such that
VFF =V−VNF. The airflow rate between the NF and the FF
zones is 𝛽 (m3 min−1). To simplify the calculations, the
initial contaminant concentrations in the two zones and a
second loss rate 𝛼L are not included, although they could
be. The equation that predicts the time-dependent airborne
contaminant concentration in the NF zone, CNF(t) in mg m−3,
for t≥0, is the following:
CNF(t) (mgm−3) = G

⎦
The terms 𝜆1 and 𝜆2 are ventilation removal rate
constants. The absolute value of 𝜆1 pertains to contaminant
removal from the FF zone, and the absolute value of 𝜆2
pertains to contaminant removal from the NF zone. Because
∣𝜆2∣ is usually greater than ∣𝜆1∣, removal from the NF zone
proceeds more quickly than removal from FF zone (or the
general room).
There is an analogous equation for airborne contaminant
concentration in the FF zone, denoted CFF(t). The latter
expression is not given here because the values predicted by
the CFF(t) equation are nearly identical to those predicted by
the WMR equation for the same values of G, Q, and V. The
CFF(t) equation is available in the literature (1, 20).
If the emission process continues for a long time such
that t → ∞, the contaminant concentrations in the NF and FF
zones reach steady-state values given by
CNF,SS (mgm−3) = G
Q +
G
𝛽 (23)
CFF,SS (mgm−3) = G
Q (24)
CFF,SS is the same value predicted using the WMR model
with a constant emission rate. If 𝛽 ≤ Q, then CNF,SS ≥2
CFF,SS, which signifies the NF steady-state concentra￾tion is at least twofold the FF steady-state concentration
(and twofold the steady-state value predicted by the WMR
model). This condition pertains in a room with a low airspeed
near the source, or in a large room with a large Q value. In
general, as the room size increases, Q increases but 𝛽 need be
little affected, in which event 𝛽 ≪ Q. In that circumstance,
the NF/FF model predicts a much higher contaminant
concentration near the emission source compared to the
WMR model. On the other hand, if 𝛽 ≫ Q because there is
high airspeed near the source, then CNF,SS ≥CFF,SS. In this
case, the rapid dispersion of chemical away from the source
makes the room behave as if it were well mixed.
Example. Figure 4 depicts the CNF(t) time series for
the following scenario. A room with V=200 m3 and
Q =20 m3 min−1 contains a point source emitting contami￾nant at G =1000 mg min−1. The source is on a flat surface,
and a worker is positioned near the source such that the
breathing zone is always within a radius of 1.0 m of the
source. Thus, the NF zone can be modeled as a hemisphere
with r=1.0 m, FSA =6.28 m2, and VNF =2.1 m3. The
random airspeed at the NF/FF boundary is 3.7 m min−1, such

and G =1000 mg min−1.
that 𝛽 =1/2 × (6.28 m2) × (3.7 m min−1)=11.6 m3 min−1.
According to Eq. (20), the expression for the time series is
CNF(t) (mgm−3) = 50 + 86 − 51.8 × exp(−0.10 × t)
− 84.2 × exp(−5.61 × t)]
Note that ∣𝜆1∣ =0.10 and approximately equals Q/VFF (the
air exchange rate in the FF zone), whereas ∣𝜆2∣ =5.61 and
approximately equals 𝛽/VNF (the air exchange rate in the NF
zone).
For comparison, Figure 4 also shows the time series for
the FF contaminant concentration that, again, is essentially
the same as that predicted for a WMR concentration time
series. In Figure 4, the NF concentration rapidly increases
to approximately 90 mg m−3 in the first minute and there￾after increases more slowly toward the steady-state value of
136 mg m−3 (as provided by the above equation for t → ∞).
The latter slow increase in the NF concentration mimics the
shape of the slow increase in the FF concentration. The expla￾nation of the NF concentration behavior is as follows. The
high air exchange rate in the NF zone (𝛽/VNF =5.5 min−1),
combined with direct contaminant emission into the NF
zone at G =1000 mg min−1, causes rapid buildup to the
value G/𝛽 =86 mg m−3. Thereafter, incremental increases
in the NF concentration are due to the flow of contam￾inated air from the FF zone into the NF zone, and the
contaminant concentration in the FF zone increases slowly
due to the relatively low air exchange rate in the FF zone
(Q/VFF =0.10 min−1). The steady-state FF concentration is
G/Q =50 mg m−3.
Appropriate parameter values are essential for any reliable
modeling. For the two-zone model, 𝛽 is arguably difficult
for modelers to comfortably value. Since 𝛽 is 1∕2 FSA × S, it
depends on the NF size and geometry to calculate the FSA.
Studies evaluating the utility of the two-zone model contain
information on the NF size and geometry utilized (23, 24).
Although actual estimates of S for the specific conditions
being modeled may be preferable, some reported values may
be useful. Random airspeeds appear to span a similar broad
range, although a geometric mean airspeed of 3.7 m min−1
with a GSD of 1.96 had been reported (21) for a broad
range of work area types. Recently, chamber study evaluation
and verification in five workplaces (29) giving median air
velocities of 3–30 m min−1 and another study (30) yielded
a mean airspeed of 4 m min−1 with a standard deviation of
3.0 for measurements in 12 rooms with volumes from 79 to
1137 m3 and air change rates of 3.3–8.6 per hour.
In applications of the NF/FF dispersion model, the first
author of this chapter recommends using the observed
median value of 3.7 m min−1 as the random air velocity if
the operation takes place on an open shop floor with no
strong sources of air motion near the NF zone boundary
(for example air cooling fans, drafts from supply air ducts
or open windows). A lower airspeed is appropriate if the
individual is working within an enclosed space that does not
receive mechanical ventilation. WC Hemeon (the originator
of the NF/FF dispersion construct) recommended using an
airspeed of 15 m min−1 given operation of a fan or air jet
close to the NF zone (22).
4.7 NF/FF with Local Exhaust Removal
and Recirculation of Treated Air
A version on the NF/FF model accounting for local exhaust
removal from the NF and recirculation of treated air to the FF
has been published (31). The “pseudo steady state” version
is as follows. See Eq. (17) above for the definition of terms.

Consider a room with volume V (m3) and supply/exhaust air
rate Q (m3 min−1) that contains a source emitting a chemical
at the exponentially decreasing rate G(t)= G0 × exp(−𝛼 × t)

with volume VNF (m3), such that VFF =V−VNF. The airflow

rate between the NF and the FF zones is 𝛽 (m3 min−1). To
simplify the calculations, the initial concentrations in each
zone and a second loss rate 𝛼L are not included, although
they could be included. The equation that predicts the time￾dependent airborne contaminant concentration in the NF

The contaminant concentration in the NF zone increases
to a peak value and then decreases toward zero. The time
at which the peak concentration occurs cannot be analyti￾cally determined but can be found by examining the time
series of CNF(t) values. There is an analogous equation for
airborne contaminant concentration in the FF zone, denoted
CFF(t). The latter expression is not given here because
the values predicted by the CFF(t) equation are close to
those predicted by the WMR equation with an exponentially
decreasing emission rate given the same Q and V values and
the same G(t) function. The CFF(t) equation is available in
the literature (13).
Example. Figure 5 depicts the CNF(t) time series over
the interval 0≤t≤30 min for the following scenario. A
room with V=200 m3 and Q =20 m3 min−1 contains a
point source on a flat surface, and a worker is positioned
near the source such that the breathing zone is always
within a radius of 1.0 m of the source. Thus, the NF
zone can be modeled as a hemisphere with r=1.0 m,
FSA =6.28 m2, and VNF =2.1 m3. The random airspeed
at the NF/FF boundary is 3.7 m min−1, such that 𝛽 =
1/2 × (6.28 m2) × (3.7 m min−1)=11.6 m3 min−1. At time
zero, there is M0 =40 000 mg in the source, and the evapora￾tion rate constant is 𝛼 =0.15 min−1. According to Eq. (23),
the expression for the time series is
CNF(t) (mgm−3) = 621.7 × exp(−0.10 × t) − 519.0
× exp(−5.61 × t)]
− 102.7 × exp(−0.15 × t)]
For comparison, Figure 5 also shows the time series for
the FF contaminant concentration which, again, is similar to
that predicted for a WMR concentration time series given
the same Q and V values and G(t) function, as seen in
Figure 2. In Figure 5, the NF concentration rapidly increases
to a peak value of 477 mg m−3 that occurs at 0.75 min after
emission begins and then decreases toward zero. The FF
concentration increases more slowly to a peak value of
89 mg m−3 that occurs at 8.3 min after emission begins, and
then decreases toward zero. Note that in Figure 3 for a WMR
with the same Q and V values and the same G(t) function,
the peak concentration is also 89 mg m−3, but occurs slightly
earlier at 8.1 min after emission begins. The NF/FF disper￾sion construct predicts a peak exposure concentration near
the source that is 5.4-fold greater (477 ÷ 89 mg m−3) than the
peak exposure predicted by the WMR dispersion construct.

the former TWA value is 3.8-fold greater than the latter

good descriptor of the actual contaminant concentrations that
would develop, then relying on the traditional WMR disper￾sion construct would lead to substantially underestimating
exposure intensity near the source.
4.9 Hemispherical Turbulent Eddy Diffusion
Without Advection and with a Constant
Emission Rate
Consider a room that contains a source emitting a contam￾inant at constant rate G (mg min−1). The source sits on a
flat surface such as the floor. The release position is set at
the origin (0,0,0) in a three-dimensional coordinate system.
Contaminant disperses away from the origin in a radially
symmetric pattern via turbulent eddy diffusion with coeffi￾cient DT (m2 min−1). Assume there is no advective airflow
near the source, so U =0. Let C(x,y,z,t) in mg m−3 denote
the chemical concentration at position (x,y,z) relative to the
source at the origin at time t. Because the source is on a flat
surface for which z=0, we assume that the z coordinate for
the worker’s position is greater than or equal to zero. The
equation which predicts C(x,y,z,t), for t≥0, is the following:
C(x, y,z, t) (mgm−3) = G
2𝜋DT
√x2 + y2 + z2
×
(
1 − erf
√x2 + y2 + z2

(27)
The term erf(a) in the brackets denotes the error func￾tion, which is an integral expression. In Eq. (24), a time
value close to zero corresponds to erf(a) ≈ 1 and a concen￾tration close to zero, while a large time value corresponds
to erf(a) ≈ 0 and a concentration close to the steady-state
value. Many mathematical software packages compute erf(a)
values. If software is not available, one can use the following

If contaminant emission continues such that t → ∞, the
contaminant concentration reaches a steady-state value
given by
C(x, y,z)SS (mgm−3) = G
2𝜋DT
√x2 + y2 + z2
(29)
Again, due to the radial symmetry in dispersion, the radial
distance r from the emission point can be substituted for the
quantity √x2 + y2 + z2 in Eqs. (27) and (28).
A Technical Note. Four problems with Eq. (27) are that
(i) it does not maintain a mass balance of chemical in
room air; (ii) it does not account for removal of contami￾nant from room air by exhaust ventilation and other mech￾anisms such as sorption or deposition onto surfaces; (iii) it
does not account for “reflection” of molecules from room
surfaces (other than from the surface on which the source
sits); and (iv) as the distance from the source decreases such
that r → 0, the predicted concentration tends toward infinity.
These problems can be resolved by modeling turbulent eddy
diffusion via a Markov chain method, which is outlined in a
later section of this chapter (28, 32).
Example. The solid line curve in Figure 6 depicts the
C(t) time series for the following scenario. A point source
on the floor emits contaminant at G =1000 mg min−1. The
source location is at the origin (0,0,0) in a three-dimensional
coordinate system. A worker kneels near the source and is
positioned at x=0.577 m, y=0.577 m, and z=0.577 m, such
that the breathing zone is at a radial distance of 1.0 m. The
turbulent eddy diffusion coefficient is DT =1.0 m2 min−1.
According to Eq. (24), the expression for the time series is

132MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
In Figure 6, the concentration rapidly increases to approx￾imately 150 mg m−3 in the first five minutes and thereafter
increases slowly toward the steady-state value of 159 mg m−3
(as provided by the above equation for t → ∞). For compar￾ison, the dashed line curve shows the NF zone concentra￾tion time series for a hemispherical NF with radius=1.0 m,
G =1000 mg min−1, and the other NF/FF model param￾eter values used in Figure 4 (VNF =2.1 m3, VFF =97.9 m3,
Q =20 m3 min−1, 𝛽 =11.6 m3 min−1). The overall shapes
of the two curves are similar (a rapid buildup followed by
a gradual increase), although the NF zone concentration
tends toward a lower steady-state value of 136 mg m−3. The
two curves would be more similar if DT =1.17 m2 min−1
and 𝛽 =11.6 m3 min−1 because both would reach the same
steady-state value of 136 mg m−3. The two curves would also
be more similar if DT =1.0 m2 min−1 and 𝛽 =9.17 m3 min−1,
because both would reach the same steady-state value of
159 mg m−3.
The correspondence (or apparent lack thereof) between
the hemispherical turbulent eddy diffusion and the hemi￾spherical NF/FF dispersion constructs raises the issue of
how DT and 𝛽 values (which both depend on random
airspeeds) are assigned and related.
The algebraic relationship between DT and 𝛽 has not
yet been fully determined but would seem to involve the
following concepts. At any point in a room, one expects to
find a distribution of air velocity vectors over time. Each
vector is decomposed into respective components along the
x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. In the ensemble of these vectors,
there is a mean vector along each axis – denoted by X, Y,
and Z – and a variance of the magnitude of the vectors along
each axis. For the x-axis, this variance of the magnitude of
the vectors, denoted 𝜎2
X in m2 min−2 is computed as follows:
σ2
X =
∑n
i=1 (|X| − |X|)
2
n
where n is the number of vectors in the ensemble. There is
an analogous variance for the vectors along the y-axis and z￾axis. A measure of turbulence intensity is a combination of
these variances designated as K (m min−1):
K =
√
𝜎2
X + 𝜎2
Y + 𝜎2
Z
The product of the K value (m min−1) and a length aspect
ΔL (m) produces a quantity with the unit m2 min−1 and
would seem related to the turbulent eddy diffusion coeffi￾cient DT with the same unit. If the K value (m min−1) were
also used as the random airspeed s in the NF/FF dispersion
construct, the interzonal airflow rate 𝛽 and DT would be alge￾braically related.
Some progress in determining DT, 𝛽 and their rela￾tionship has been achieved. A hypothesized relationship
between mechanical energy from ventilation flow and any
thermal stratification (33) led to a predictive equation for DT,
albeit one not widely validated. Recent controlled chamber
studies (29) also suggest a relationship between DT and
ACH, with the data covering ACH range of 0.43–2.89 and DT
roughly covarying over the range of 0.067–0.55, for values
averaged at each reported ACH. This generally agrees with
an earlier finding for such a relationship in a residential envi￾ronment (34). As previously noted, DT values estimated in
different indoor settings span a 100-fold range from 0.1 to
10 m2 min−1 (1). The DT value of 1.0 m2 min−1 used for
Figure 6 was the geometric mean of the reported range limits,
or √
0.1 × 10 and, if lacking more specific information, is a
reasonable default for environments with moderately mixed
air. In modeling, one may consider lower values for quies￾cent air environments (e.g. a nonventilated closet) and higher
for very well mixed conditions, such as when mixing fans
are present. Envision DT in meters squared per minute as the
planar area in meters squared that a molecule in a “random
walk” could cover in that time due to the random air velocity
in the space modeled.
As noted above in the two-zone model discussion, random
airspeeds appear to span a broad range, although a geometric
mean airspeed of 3.7 m min−1 with a GSD of 1.96 had been
reported (21) for a diverse range of work area types. Recent
chamber study evaluation and verification in five work￾places (29) give median air velocities of 3–30 m min−1, and
another study (30) yielded a mean airspeed of 4 m min−1 with
a standard deviation of 3.0 for measurements in 12 rooms
with volumes from 79 to 1137 m3 and air change rates of
3.3–8.6 per hour.
4.10 WMR with a Reversible Sink
When the WMR model was introduced in this chapter, a loss
rate constant 𝛼L (min−1) was used to denote contaminant
removal from air by a nonventilatory mechanism such as
adsorption onto room surfaces or sorption into construction
materials and furnishings. These surfaces and materials are
often termed “sinks.” If the flow is one-way only from room
air to the sink, Eq. (1) applies. However, if the flow is two￾way (reversible) such that the contaminant can move from
the sink back into room air, a different equation must be
used. A conceptual diagram is Figure 7. The hatched area
at the bottom of the room represents a sink, which need not
be physically located on the floor (although carpeting could
be a sink). The factor 𝛼2 is a first-order rate of transfer for
contaminant mass in room air to the sink, and the factor 𝛼3
is a first-order rate of transfer for contaminant mass in the
sink back into room air. Exhaust ventilation is converted to a
first-order loss rate from room air, 𝛼1 (min−1), by dividing Q
(m3 min−1) by the room volume Vroom (m3). The volume of
the sink is Vsink (m3).

FIGURE 7 A well-mixed room with a reversible sink (the
hatched area). The first-order loss rate of contaminant from room
air due to exhaust airflow is 𝛼1 = Q/V min−1. The first-order rate
of contaminant mass transfer from room air to the sink is 𝛼2 min−1.
The first-order rate of contaminant mass transfer from the sink to
room air is 𝛼3 min−1.
Consider that at time zero, the contaminant concentration
in room air is Croom,0, the contaminant concentration in the
sink is Csink,0, and emission into room air begins at constant
rate G (mg min−1). The equation that predicts Croom(t) in

The reversible sink also affects the decay in the room air
contaminant concentration once de novo emission ceases.
The concentration decreases less rapidly when the reversible
sink is present because contaminant is released from the sink
into room air. Consider that at some reference time zero,
the contaminant concentration in room air is Croom,0, the
contaminant concentration in the sink is Csink,0, and there
is no emission into room air other than from the sink. The
equation that predicts Croom(t) in mg m−3, for t≥0, is the
following:
Croom(t)=Ω [

and 𝜆2 and 𝜆3 are the same parameters as computed for
Eq. (27).
Example. Figure 8 depicts the Croom(t) series (the
solid line curve) over the time period 0≤t≤24 h for
the input values G =1000 mg min−1, Vroom =200 m3,
Vsink =1 m3, Q =3.33 m3 min−1, 𝛼2 and 𝛼3 =0.0017 min−1,
and Croom,0 and Csink,0 =0. For comparison, the dashed
line curve shows the concentration time series for a
WMR with G =1000 mg min−1, Vroom =200 m3, and
Q =3.33 m3 min−1, but absent the sink. The effect of
the reversible sink is to delay the buildup of the contaminant
concentration to the same steady-state value. At t=1440 min
(24 h), Croom with the reversible sink is 296 mg m−3, while
Croom without the sink is 300 mg m−3. At 24 h, the concen￾tration in the sink is 52 500 mg m−3. According to Eq. (27),
the expression for Croom(t) for 0≤t≤1440 min (24 h) is
given by
Croom(t)(mgm−3) = 300 − 267.7 × exp(−0.0015 × t) − 32.3
× exp(−0.0185 × t)]
Figure 8 also depicts the Croom(t) series (the solid line
curve) over a 16 h period subsequent to cessation of the orig￾inal emission source; that is G =0 for t>1440 min (24 h).
The input values Vroom, Vsink, Q, 𝛼2, and 𝛼3 are the same
as in the buildup scenario, but the new starting concentra￾tions are Croom,0 =296 mg m−3 and Csink,0 =52 500 mg m−3.
The latter values were attained by the end of the 24 h
buildup period when G =1000 mg min−1. For comparison,
the dashed line curve shows the concentration time series
for a WMR room with the same Vroom and Q values, and
with a starting concentration of 300 mg m−3 but absent the
sink. Again, the reversible sink decreases the rate of contam￾inant removal from room air because contaminant enters
room air from the sink. After 16 h of concentration decay (at
t=40 h referenced to the original time zero), Croom with the
reversible sink is 0.54 mg m−3, while Croom without the sink
is essentially zero. According to Eq. (28), the expression for
Croom(t) for 1440 min<t≤2400 min is given by
Croom(t) (mgm−3) = 28.6 × exp(−0.0015 × [t − 1440])
+ 267.7 × exp(−0.0185 × [t − 1440])

FIGURE 8 The well-mixed room dispersion constructs with a

input values are V =200 m3, Vsink =1 m3, Q =3.33 m3 min−1,
𝛼2 =0.0017 min−1, 𝛼3 =0.0017 min−1, Croom,0 =0, Csink,0 =0, and
G =1000 mg min−1. The solid line curve is the WMR model with a
reversible sink. The dashed line curve is the WMR model without
a sink.
The reason that the 1440 min (24 h) is subtracted from t
in the argument of the exponent function is to maintain the
same zero starting time for the process.
A reversible sink can lead to the undesirable buildup of
contaminant in room air once a room is vacated and the venti￾lation system is turned off. Upon subsequent entry, the occu￾pants can be exposed to a contaminant level that is annoying
or overtly harmful. One such scenario that was investi￾gated involved the off-gassing of methyl bromide subse￾quent to home fumigation for termites (35). At the end of
an aeration period following methyl bromide treatment, the
methyl bromide concentration decreased to a level deemed
acceptable. However, when the house was closed back up,
the methyl bromide concentration increased to unaccept￾able levels due to off-gassing from construction materials
and furnishings (the sinks) and an inadequate dilution air
exchange rate.
The reader may have noticed that the structure of the
WMR model with a reversible sink is similar to the NF/FF
model. In both constructs, the room contains two compart￾ments that can undergo an exchange of contaminant mass.
In the NF/FF model, airflow into and out of the NF zone
causes the exchange. In the reversible sink model, sorp￾tion into the sink and off-gassing from the sink mediate the
exchange. The analytical solution equation for two compart￾ments is more complicated than for one compartment, and
if there were three or more compartments in the room, the
corresponding equations would be decidedly more complex.
A relatively simple method for modeling mass exchanges
between multiple compartments is a Markov chain, which
is described in the next section.
5 THE MARKOV CHAIN METHOD
5.1 Basic Ideas
To explain the method, we consider a WMR with a reversible
sink. Designate room air as “state 1,” designate the sink
as “state 2,” and designate exhausted out of the room as
“state 3.” There are two first-order loss rates acting on a
contaminant molecule in state 1 (room air) – 𝛼1 for removal
by exhaust ventilation and 𝛼2 for removal by sorption into
the sink – so the overall rate is 𝛼1 +𝛼2. Next, consider
an incremental time step Δt equal to, say, 0.01 min. The
probability that a contaminant molecule present in room air
at time t remains in room air at time t+ Δt is given as follows:
Probability molecule remains in room air
= exp(−(𝛼1 + 𝛼2)×Δt) (32)
This probability does not depend on the actual time t,
only on the length of the time step Δt. The probability
that the molecule leaves room air in the interval Δt is the
complement:
Probability particle leaves room air
= 1 − exp(−(𝛼1 + 𝛼2)×Δt) (33)
Given that the molecule leaves room air in interval Δt, the
conditional probability that it leaves via exhaust ventilation
versus sorption into the sink is, respectively, as follows:
Conditional probability molecule leaves
via exhaust ventilation = 𝛼1
𝛼1 + 𝛼2
(34)
Conditional probability molecule leaves via sorption
= 𝛼2
𝛼1 + 𝛼2
(35)
In turn, the unconditional probability that in interval Δt
the molecule leaves room air via exhaust ventilation versus
sorption into the sink is the product of the corresponding
conditional probability and the probability that the molecule
leaves room air in the first place:
= 𝛼1
𝛼1 + 𝛼2
× [1 − exp(−(𝛼1 + 𝛼2)×Δt)] (36)
= 𝛼2
𝛼1 + 𝛼2
× [1 − exp(−(𝛼1 + 𝛼2)×Δt)] (37)
135PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
Let the quantity pij denote the probability that a molecule
in state i at the start of the interval Δt is in state j at the
end of the interval. The quantity pij is termed a “single￾step transition probability.” The probability that a molecule
present in room air at the start of the interval remains in room
air is denoted p11, equal to the right-hand side of Eq. (32).
The probability that a molecule in room air at the start of the
interval is exhausted out of the room is denoted p13, equal
to the right-hand side of Eq. (36). The probability that a
molecule in room air at the start of the interval sorbs into the
sink is denoted p12, equal to the right-hand side of Eq. (37).
These three probabilities sum to one: p11 +p12 +p13 =1.
Thus, for a molecule present in room air at the start of the
interval, we have accounted for all the places the molecule
can be at the end of the interval.
The single-step transition probabilities are based on the
properties of first-order loss rates discussed earlier in this
chapter. The overall first-order rate by which a molecule
leaves state 1 is the sum of the first-order rates associated
with the independent removal mechanisms of exhaust venti￾lation (𝛼1) and sorption into the sink (𝛼2). Given that a
molecule leaves state 1, the probability that it leaves via
exhaust ventilation is the first-order loss rate due to venti￾lation divided by the total first-order loss rate, and the proba￾bility that it leaves via sorption is the first-order loss rate due
to sorption divided by the total first-order loss rate.
Next, we consider a molecule in the sink. The probability
that a contaminant molecule present in the sink at time t still
remains in the sink at time t+ Δt is given as follows:
Probability molecule remains in sink = exp(−𝛼3 × Δt)
(38)
where 𝛼3 denotes the first-order rate at which the molecule
leaves the sink and enters room air.
In this case, there is only one removal mechanism (off￾gassing) and one first-order loss rate. The probability that the
molecule leaves the sink in the interval Δt is the complement:
Probability molecule leaves sink = 1 − exp(−𝛼3 × Δt)
(39)
The probability that a molecule present in the sink at
the start of the interval remains in the sink is denoted p22,
equal to the right-hand side of Eq. (38). The probability
that a molecule in the sink leaves the sink and enters room
air is denoted p21, equal to the right-hand side of Eq. (39).
The probability that a molecule in the sink directly moves
to the exhausted out of the room state 3 is zero, because
only molecules in room air can be exhausted, in which
case p23 =0. The sum of the three probabilities is one:
p21 +p22 +p23 =1. For a molecule present in the sink at the
start of the interval, we have accounted for all the places the
molecule can be at the end of the interval.
What if a molecule had already been exhausted out of
the room (in state 3) at the start of the interval? If we
do not permit reentry into room air via the supply airflow,
then molecules that enter state 3 never leave. For exhausted
particles, this signifies that p31 =0, p32 =0, and p33 =1.
Next, we create a matrix P with three rows and three
columns. Each row represents a state (where the row number
equals the state number), and each column represents a state
(where the column number equals the state number). The cell
entries are
P =
⎡
⎢
⎢
⎣
p11 p12 p13
p21 p22 p23
p31 p32 p33
⎤
⎥
⎥
⎦
(40)
A square matrix P in which the sum of the entries in each
row equals one is termed a Markov matrix. P is also termed a
single-step transition probability matrix because it contains
the probabilities of moving between states in one time step.
The time course of molecular movement is tracked via matrix
multiplication. After n time steps (for which t=n × Δt), the
expected proportion of molecules starting in state 1 (room
air) that are present in state 1 is the entry in the first cell and
first row of the matrix Pn, which is the matrix P multiplied by
itself n times. This proportion is denoted by P(n)
11 . In general,
P(n)
ij denotes the probability that a molecule starting in state
i is in state j after n time steps. In each row of Pn, the row
entries sum to one. For example, in our 3 × 3 Pn matrix,
P(n)
11 + P(n)
12 + P(n)
13 = 1. This condition signifies that we have
accounted for the fate of all the molecules that were present
in room air at a specified starting time (n × Δt time steps in
the past).
Consider that at the starting time, there are M1,t =0
contaminant molecules in room air and M2,t=0 contaminant
molecules in the sink. If no new contaminant molecules
are added to the system, then at t=n × Δt, the expected
contaminant molecule concentration in room air (state 1)
with volume Vroom (m3) is
Croom (t = n × Δt) (#∕m3) =
M1,t=0 × P(n)
11 + M2,t=0 × P(n)
21
Vroom (41)
The molecular number concentration (#/m3) is easily
converted to a mass concentration (mg m−3) via multiplying
the number concentration by the mass (mg) per molecule.
The easier alternative is to define M1,t=0 and M2,t=0 as the
starting contaminant mass (mg) in, respectively, room air
(state 1) and the sink (state 2). The relative simplicity of the
Markov chain method is seen by comparing Eq. (41) with
Eq. (31) for the time-dependent contaminant concentration
in room air given initial concentrations in room air (Croom,0)
and the sink (Csink,0), and no further emission (other than
from the sink). As if by magic, matrix multiplication (via a
computer code) supplies the values for P(n)
11 and P(n)
21 . If we
define M1,t=0 and M2,t=0 as starting contaminant masses,
then M1,t=0 =Croom,0 × Vroom and M2,t=0 =Csink,0 × Vsink.
136MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
Note that the NF/FF model can be implemented with a
similar 3 × 3 P matrix structure. In this case, state 1 is the FF,
state 2 is the NF, and state 3 is exhausted out of the room. The
first-order loss rates are 𝛼1 = Q/VFF, 𝛼2 =𝛽/VFF, 𝛼3 =𝛽/VNF.
Moreover, multiple compartments within the room (different
air spaces and/or different sinks) can be considered in a
relatively compact fashion; in the P matrix, each row and
column correspond to one of the compartments. For example,
with regard to the WMR with a reversible sink, some sinks
are better modeled as having two parts – a “fast sink” and a
“slow sink” – such that contaminant release from the former
is more rapid than from the latter. In this scenario, we can
define four states – room air (state 1), the fast sink (state 2)
physically contiguous with room air, the slow sink (state 3)
physically contiguous with the fast sink and exhausted out of
the room (state 4) from state 1. We can form a 4 × 4 P matrix
and proceed in the same manner as outlined earlier.
5.2 Accounting for Ongoing Emission
Equation (41) applies to a scenario in which there is starting
contaminant mass in one or more compartments, but no new
mass is emitted into the system such that G(t)=0. Incor￾porating ongoing contaminant emission is more a matter of
bookkeeping than mathematical analysis. The explanation
again uses a WMR with a reversible sink with no starting
contaminant mass in room air or the sink. Consider that in
each time step subsequent to t=0, a certain mass of contam￾inant is emitted into room air (state 1). The contaminant mass
(mg) emitted in the kth time step is denoted M1,k, and is
treated as being emitted at the beginning of the time step. At
time t=n × Δt, where k≤n and where we are at the end of the
nth time step, a number n−k+1 time steps have elapsed. For
example, if n=3 and k=1, three time steps (3−1+1) have
elapsed between the release of mass M1,1 and time t=3 × Δt.
The proportion of mass M1,1 that remains in room air (state
1) is P(3)
11 . In general, for mass M1,k released into room air
(state 1) at the start of the kth time step, the proportion that
remains in room air (state 1) at time t=n × Δt is P(n−k+1)
11 , the
entry in the first row and first column of the matrix P(n−k+1).
The total contaminant mass in room air (state 1) at
t=n × Δt is the sum of the remainders of the individual
masses released in time steps k=1,2, …,n, or
Total mass in room air at n × Δt = ∑n
k=1
M1,k × P(n−k+1)
11
(42)
By definition, P(1)
11 = p11. The contaminant concentration
in room air is this total mass divided by the room volume
Vroom:
Croom(t = n × Δt)(mgm−3) =
∑n
k=1 M1,k × P(n−k+1)
11
Vroom
(43)
Now, what if there were contaminant masses in room air
and/or the sink at time zero? The answer is that the right￾hand side of Eq. (38) concerning the fate of these initial
contaminant masses (in which case M1,t =0 and M2,t =0 are
defined as masses) is added to the right-hand side of Eq. (43).
The final question is – how do we find the M1,k values?
If we have a constant emission rate G (mg min−1), the
mass released in each time step is G ÷ (1 ÷ Δt), where
Δt is in minutes. For example, if Δt=0.01 min and G =
1000 mg min−1, then M1,k =(1000 mg min−1) ÷ (1 ÷ 0.01
min)=10 mg for all k. If the emission rate function G(t) is
variable and continuous, we need to integrate G(t) over each
time step. Where t=n × Δt, define the time (referenced to
time zero) at the start of the kth interval as tstart =(k ÷ n) × t,
and define the time (referenced to time zero) at the end of the
kth interval as tend =tstart + Δt. It follows that
M1,k =
tend

6 MODELING TURBULENT EDDY
DIFFUSION AND ADVECTION
The Markov chain method can be applied to within-room
contaminant dispersion by turbulent eddy diffusion and
advection (28, 32). A complete discussion is beyond the
scope of this chapter, but the basic elements of the method are
provided. Consider that we divide room air into cubic cells
with length aspect ΔL (m) and volume Vcell =(ΔL)
3 (m3),
where the cells are aligned along the x-axis, y-axis, and
z-axis. The air within each cell is assumed well mixed,
although room air overall need not be well mixed. We focus
on the behavior of a contaminant molecule in an interior
room cell (one not bordering a room surface). The molecule
can leave the cell due to turbulent eddy diffusion or due
to advective airflow (flow in a given direction, on average).
Assume the advective flow is left to right along the x-axis.
The interior cell has six neighbor cells that each shares a
face with the interior cell – to the left and to the right on the
x-axis, to the front and to the rear on the y-axis, and above
and below on the z-axis. In one time step, the molecule can
remain (hold) in the interior cell, or move to one of its adja￾cent neighbor cells.
The advective airflow with speed S (m min−1) is ortho￾gonal to the left-hand face of the cubic cell with area (ΔL)
2.
The first-order loss rate for advective transport from the cell,
𝛼1 (min−1), is the quotient of the volumetric airflow through
the cell and the cell volume:
𝛼1 = S × (ΔL)
2
(ΔL)3 = S
ΔL (45)
137PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
If the molecule leaves the interior cell due to advection,
it travels to the neighboring cell to the right. The turbulent
eddy diffusion coefficient DT has the unit m2 min−1. DT
reflects a rate of dispersion and can be converted to a first￾order loss rate with the unit min−1 according to the following
expression:
𝛼2 = 6DT
(ΔL)2 (46)
The rate 𝛼2 pertains to removal from the interior cell by
turbulent diffusion regardless of the direction of movement.
For movement by turbulent eddy diffusion to each individual
neighboring cell, the rate constant is 𝛼2/6. The total first￾order loss rate of the molecule from the interior cell is
𝛼1 +𝛼2. In one time step Δt, the probability that the molecule
remains in the interior cell (denote phold) is
phold = exp(−[𝛼1 + 𝛼2]×Δt) (47)
In one time step Δt, the probability that the molecule
leaves the interior cell and moves to the neighboring cell to
the right (denoted by pright) is
pright = 𝛼1 + (𝛼2∕6)
𝛼1 + 𝛼2
× [1 − phold] (48)
In one time step Δt, the probability that the molecule
leaves the interior cell and moves to any of the other neigh￾boring cells is
pleft = pfoward = pback = pup = pdown = 𝛼2∕6
𝛼1 + 𝛼2
× [1−phold]
(49)
Equations (47)–(49) provide the single-step transition
probabilities for a molecule in the interior cell, where these
probabilities sum to one. Given that pright is greater than the
other probabilities of movement, molecules tend to move
to the right (due to advective airflow) but also randomly
disperse (due to turbulent eddy diffusion). If a similar set
of single-step transition probabilities is assigned for each
room air cell, one can form a Markov matrix P that describes
molecular movement within the room, where each row and
column of P represents a room air cell. We can also account
for reflection of molecules by room surfaces, and the removal
of molecules from room air via the exhaust airflow and sorp￾tion into sinks, but those details are not covered here.
An advantage of the Markov chain method for modeling
turbulent eddy diffusion is that it limits the contaminant
concentration to a finite value, unlike analytical Eq. (27) for
hemispherical turbulent eddy diffusion when r → 0. In the
Markov chain method, contaminant molecules from a point
source are released into one (or several) receiving air cell
with a defined volume and are dispersed from this receiving
cell(s) by turbulent eddy diffusion and advective airflow. The
contaminant concentration may build up to a high value in
the receiving air cell(s), but it does not increase to an infinite
value.
6.1 Modeling Particle Settling
For particulate contaminants, the Markov chain method
can also incorporate gravitational settling. In the case of
molecules, we considered the loss of contaminant molecules
from an interior room cell due to advective airflow (with
loss rate 𝛼1) and turbulent eddy diffusion (with loss rate 𝛼2).
A third loss rate 𝛼grav operates for particles. To assign this
rate, the particle’s terminal settling velocity VTS is divided
by the height of the cell ΔL:
𝛼grav = 𝛼3 = VTS
ΔL (50)
For a particle in an interior room cell, the total first-order
loss rate is 𝛼1 +𝛼2 +𝛼3. In one time step Δt, the probability
that the particle remains in the interior cell is
phold = exp(−[𝛼1 + 𝛼2 + 𝛼3]×Δt) (51)
In one time step Δt, the probability that the molecule
leaves the interior cell and moves to the neighboring cell
below is
pbelow = 𝛼3 + (𝛼2∕6)
𝛼1 + 𝛼2 + 𝛼3
× [1 − phold] (52)
In one time step Δt, the probability that the molecule
leaves the interior cell and moves to the neighboring cell to
the right is
pright = a1 + (a2∕6)
a1 + a2 + a3
× [1 − phold] (53)
In one time step Δt, the probability that the molecule
leaves the interior cell and moves to any of the other neigh￾boring cells is
pleft = pfoward = pback = pup = a2∕6
a1 + a2 + a3
× [1 − phold]
(54)
Equations (51)–(54) provide the single-step transition
probabilities for a particle in the interior cell and sum to
one. If a similar set of single-step transition probabilities
is assigned for each room air cell, one can form a Markov
matrix P that describes particle movement within the room,
where each row and column represents a room air cell. We
can also account for the settling of particles onto the floor
and other horizontal surfaces, and the removal of particles
from room air via the exhaust airflow and deposition onto
vertical surfaces, but those details are not covered here. Note
that for large particles with 𝛼3 much greater than 𝛼1 and
𝛼2, the particles will travel downward to the floor relatively
138MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
quickly and will not disperse throughout the room. Thus, the
Markov chain method for a particulate contaminant over￾comes the limitation of the WMR construct that assumes
uniform dispersion in the room.
7 IMPLEMENTATION OF
MATHEMATICAL MODELS
IN MICROSOFT EXCEL
Occupational hygiene practitioners wishing to use the
mathematical models face the issue of implementing the
equations in suitable software and verifying the compu￾tational integrity of that setup. Symbolic mathematical
software (e.g. Mathematica, MatLab or MathCad) or general
scientific packages including open source versions such
as R or SciLab are possibilities. These generally require
investment in time to learn the software sufficiently to set
up and run the equations, and some require licensing fees.
For some of that software, already available scripts to run
a given model may be available for download, but these
can be difficult to find and edit to specific needs. Numeric
calculation packages, i.e. spreadsheets are widely avail￾able and used in occupational hygiene in numerous ways.
Use of spreadsheets to implement selected equations (25)
was described. Currently, a Microsoft Excel suite of the
mathematical models improving and expanding on the
prior work (25) plus a General Help file are available for
download on the AIHA website (36). The spreadsheet runs
in all versions of Excel for Windows PCs since Excel 2000
and in Apple computers in recent versions of Excel for Mac.
The 11 models implemented in that Visual Basic enhanced
spreadsheet called IH Mod are listed below. Most but not all
are described in this chapter.

Near and Mid – Field Gaussian Plume Models
A brief narrated and illustrated tutorial on using IH Mod
is included in a YouTube video (37). For each model, IH Mod
includes a brief help section (accessed via the green question
mark (?) icon on the top left of the model pages) which
provides the main aspects and constraints of the model,
definitions of terms, and selected references. The spreadsheet
is currently constructed to work in five languages, English,
French, German, Korean, Italian, with more to be added. The
user may select the language at the opening screen. Each
model has sections for input variables, graphs of results,
controls for printing, specification of the maximum time to
cover in the calculation, the time course for the contaminant
release for the continuous generation rate models, and a time
of interest for the user between the start and maximum time
specified. The continuous generation rate models include a
calculation of the mass emitted to time t (time of interest
specified by the user) to check that mass emitted is not greater
than the available contaminant mass. The current IH Mod
typically divides the user-specified simulation time into 100
increments for calculation and graphing. However, a higher
resolution mode of 5000 intervals is available by user choice
if needed for a specific problem.
7.1 Stochastic (Monte Carlo Simulation)
Approaches
The spreadsheet suite of models IH Mod discussed above
can be used with certain commercial or “freeware” Monte
Carlo Simulation (MCS) packages to use statistical distri￾butions of parameters and inputs and yield statistical distri￾butions of predicted concentrations. To conduct MCS in
IH Mod, the user must “unprotect” the model sheet, which
does not require a password. However, such use is some￾what cumbersome and restrictive. Thus, an update IH Mod
2.0 is available (36) and uses the capability of MS Excel
and Visual Basic to provide MCS in Excel and requires no
other software. Version 2.0 also retains the prior determin￾istic modeling option. See Figure 9 for an example of the IH
Mod 2.0 implementation of the two-zone constant generation
rate model with Monte Carlos Simulation options.
8 MODEL VALIDATION
Validation of mathematical models used for exposure assess￾ment can cover several aspects of the models. First, are the
mathematical equations for the model correctly derived and
described? Are the models’ assumptions and approxima￾tions clearly stated? Second, if the model is presented in
software, does the software accurately and reliably calculate
the underlying equations? Third, are there any checks that
entered parameter values are in appropriate value ranges
for the model’s assumptions? Fourth, do the results hold
139PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
FIGURE 9 Implemented in MS Excel, IH Mod 2.0 (36) provides Monte Carlo Simulation capability for a suite of models of utility for
indoor air exposure assessments. This example shows the Near Field and Far Field TWA results on the graph. The user can choose deterministic
(fixed parameter values) or stochastic (parameter values as uniform, triangular, normal or log-normal distributions) modes.
up against a reality check, such as against some available
measurements? This last point is often difficult to complete
because the model is being used to assess exposures some￾time in the past or predict results for a possible future
scenario, or scenario that is not available for any measure￾ments of parameters of resulting concentrations. Published
proposed approaches for model calibration (26, 31, 38)
covered variants of the well mix box and two-zone models
but are actually more generalizable with little modification
to many models. The proposal gives a structured, systematic
approach applied to both steady state and varying condition
estimates. The calibration procedure involves the estimation
of the model parameters for a specific exposure scenario.
It utilizes one to several concentration measurements at
relevant locations in the modeled space but not proximate to
the source, from within the local control exhaust system and
in the recirculated air stream. For the model described in
Section 4.1 the V (room volume), Q (room ventilation rate),
and QL (LEV rate) should be known or can be otherwise
reliably obtained. The often more difficult to determine
model variables – G (mass emission rate) and the collection
and filtration efficiencies (𝜀L, 𝜀LF, and 𝜀RF) – are esti￾mated using the calibration measurements and the algebraic
rearrangements of the steady state equations.
For the two-zone model, the concepts are similar but more
details and more parameters are unknown and need to be
measured for the calibration (31, 38).
9 ADDITIONAL MODELS
AND RESOURCES
The focus of this chapter has been on indoor air concentra￾tion models, their development and to some extent their use.
The physical–chemical models discussed earlier consider the
source, dispersal, and removal of the contaminant in the esti￾mation approaches. There are many more models for indoor
air described in the literature and available for use than can
be covered in this chapter. More evolve each year, either
in the physical–chemical family or with other approaches,
including a combination of measured exposure data and
structured scenario evaluation to search the database and
report back the potential exposures. The US Environmental
Protection Agency (US EPA) has developed models to
estimate indoor concentrations and/or exposures to contam￾inants. Additional models have been developed in Europe,
Canada, and elsewhere. A few but seemingly key models
from these groups are mentioned in the following section,
as are some additional resources related to mathematical
model use. Note that some of the models discussed in the
following section are directed at residential and consumer
exposure issues but may be relevant to other scenarios,
including primary manufacturing and downstream use
situations.
140MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
9.1 Primarily European Union Developed
Tools
Several of the following models are directed at consumer
and general populations exposures, or environmental expo￾sures. Several have notable utility though for occupational
assessments since consumer and occupational tasks may
have significant similarities after considering the differences
in frequency, duration, quantity of agent, and the environ￾mental conditions.
The Consumer Exposure model ConsExpo (39) uses a
series of standard scenarios for consumer exposure assess￾ments to a wide variety of products in a wide variety of
circumstances. It utilizes models varying in complexity,
from simple screening models to more advanced,
physical–chemical principle models.
The European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxi￾cology of Chemicals (ECETOC) Targeted Risk Assessment
(TRA) (40) model is considered a Tier 1 (screening level)
model that calculates the risk of exposure from chemicals
to workers, consumers, and the environment. It has been
identified by the European Commission’s Regulation on
Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of
Chemicals (REACH) as a preferred approach for evaluating
consumer and worker health risks.
Stoffenmanager (42, 43) is also considered a Tier 2 model
for more detailed than screening evaluation but with control
banding decisions its main objective. Stoffenmanager shares
some developmental aspects with Advanced REACH Tool
(ART; see the following discussion) and may also be affected
by internal multiplier errors.
The ART (44, 45) is considered a Tier 2 model for
more detailed than screening evaluation in the EU REACH
program. ART utilizes a structured subjective evaluation of
a scenario and comparison to available data. Its developer
used multipliers to modify two-zone model results as part
of the ART and Stoffenmanager (see the earlier discussion)
procedures. Recent research (41) suggests ART’s current
multipliers appear to be incorrect and may be producing
somewhat erroneous results. Suggestions for correction (41)
include more transparency in the model routines and possible
inclusion directly of two-zone model calculations.
9.2 Selected US EPA Models
The Multi-Chamber Chemical Exposure Model
(MCCEM) (42) provides multiple zone exposure esti￾mates as average and peak indoor air concentrations of
chemicals released from products or materials in homes
and other residences. The data libraries included cover resi￾dential settings, but the model can be used for other indoor
environments if the user provides applicable input values for
the model parameters such as room volume and ventilation.
MCCEM estimates inhalation exposures to chemicals, as
potential single day doses, or chronic doses, but does not
account for actual absorption into the body.
The Wall Paint Exposure Model (WPEM) (43) evaluates
applicator and bystander exposures during and following
paint application.
The Exposure and Fate Assessment Screening Tool
(E-FAST) (44) is considered an environmental screening￾level tool. E-FAST provides estimates of the concentrations
of chemicals released to air, surface water, landfills, and
consumer products. Estimates provided are potential inhala￾tion, dermal, and ingestion dose rates resulting from releases
of chemicals. Modeled estimates of concentrations and
doses are designed to reasonably overestimate exposures,
for use in an exposure assessment in the absence of or with
reliable monitoring data.
The Chemical Exposure Model (CEM) (45) is a soft￾ware tool that estimates inhalation, oral, and dermal expo￾sures based on the chemical, consumer product, receptor, and
environment of interest. It estimates acute and chronic expo￾sures and provides a variety of exposure metrics.
The Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation
(SHEDS) (46) models are probabilistic models that can esti￾mate exposures people face from chemicals encountered
in everyday activities. The models generate predictions of
aggregate and cumulative exposures over time to inform risk
assessments that protect human health. SHEDS can esti￾mate the range of total chemical exposures in a popula￾tion from different exposure pathways over different time
periods given a set of demographic characteristics. SHEDS
can also help identify critical exposure pathways, factors, and
uncertainties.
The Indoor Environmental Concentrations in Build￾ings with Conditioned and Unconditioned Zones model
(IECCU) (47) is (i) a general-purpose indoor exposure
model in buildings with multiple zones, multiple chemicals,
and multiple sources and sinks and (ii) a special-purpose
concentration model for simulating the effects of sources in
unconditioned zones on the indoor environmental concen￾trations in conditioned zones.
These US EPA models MCCEM and WPEM have not
yet been updated to run in Windows versions after Windows
95 and Windows XP but do run in more recent versions of
Windows after installing “Virtual Box” software to emulate
Windows 7 XP mode. Instructions (48) are available.
9.3 Additional Resources and Information
The European Exposure Factors Sourcebook (49) includes
European exposure factors for exposure analysis and risk
assessment. The ExpoFacts Sourcebook has three parts: a
database, a reference guide, and a document library. All of
these are free to use, and available through the site. Impor￾tant exposure factors are housing conditions, consumption of
141PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
food and beverages, and time use in different microenviron￾ments. The European exposure factor data have traditionally
been scattered around national and international institutes,
in scientific articles and reports. This data has now been
compiled to the extent possible into this ExpoFacts database
so that it would be accessible for all of those who need it.
The Consumer Product Information Database provides
primarily US consumer product composition infor￾mation (50) by category of uses, such as automotive,
landscaping and yard, home maintenance, hobby and craft,
personal care, and more. The website provides composi￾tion information with Chemical Abstract Service (CAS)
numbers to use in finding additional information with links
to the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB). The
Household Products Database (51) of the National Library
of Medicine links over 18 000 consumer brands to health
effects from Safety Data Sheets (formerly Material Safety
Data Sheets), provided by manufacturers and allows scien￾tists and consumers to research products based on chemical
ingredients. The database is designed to provide information
on (i) the chemical ingredients and their percentage in
specific brands, (ii) products that contain specific chemical
ingredients, (iii) the manufacturer for a specific brand,
(iv) contact information for the manufacturer, (v) the acute
and chronic effects of chemical ingredients in a specific
brand, and (vi) Other information available about the chem￾icals in the toxicology-related databases of the National
Library of Medicine.
The Exposure and Risk Screening Methods for Consumer
Product Ingredients document (52) presents methodologies
and specific consumer exposure information that can be
used for screening-level risk assessments of environmental
and repeated human exposures to High Production Volume
chemicals through the manufacturing and use of consumer
products, mainly laundry, cleaning, and personal care
products. However, the approach can be applied to other
consumer products when information on how consumers use
the products is available. These methodologies allow hazard
information to be put into context by using exposure infor￾mation to characterize risk. Screening-level risk assessments
are useful for prioritizing the need for further work.
The US EPA document, Methods for Assessing Exposure
to Chemicals. Volume 7. Methods for Assessing Consumer
Exposure to Chemical Substances (53) provides relevant
guidance outlining the factors to consider in consumer expo￾sure assessments.
The Consolidated Human Activity Database
(CHAD) (54) is a compilation of detailed data on human
behavior from 22 separate exposure and time-use studies.
The database includes more than 54 000 individual study
days of detailed human behavior, with each day broken down
into individual hours and activity types. The data include
demographic information, including age, sex, employment,
and education level, which allows researchers to examine
specific groups within the general population and how their
unique behavior patterns influence their exposures to chem￾icals. The data in CHAD can help researchers understand
the patterns of human behavior that influence their exposure
to chemicals in their environment. Product for use in human
exposure and health studies with predictive models.
The ECETOC developed the Human Exposure Assess￾ment Tools Database (heatDB) (55) as a compendium for
risk assessors to search and locate human exposure tools and
data available that is in the public domain. Available sources
of exposure data have been gathered, structured and catego￾rized into a harmonized system. Available tools for exposure
assessment were also gathered and categorized. The database
allows risk assessors to quickly review what data sources and
tools are available for given purposes and to have guidance
on their appropriate use using a tiered approach. There are
hundreds of identified sources of human exposure data and
tools in heatDB. Users can register for free, login and use the
database as required. There is a search box for searches on
all covered data fields. There is also a message board where
users can leave suggestions for improvements to the database
or identify new data sources and tools to include in future
versions.
The book Residential Exposure Assessment: a Source￾book (56) contains information and resources to assess and
manage potential exposures occurring in and around the
home, addressing such issues as US legislation relevant to
products used in and around the residence, methods for
measuring and modeling exposures across multiple pathways
and routes, and distributional data available for key residen￾tial exposure factors.
The US EPA publication, Exposure Factors Handbook:
2011 Edition (57) provided a compilation General US expo￾sure factors such as: drinking water consumption, soil inges￾tion, inhalation rates, dermal factors including skin area and
soil adherence factors, consumption of fruits and vegetables,
fish, meats, dairy products, homegrown foods, human milk
intake, human activity factors, consumer product use, and
building characteristics. Recommended values are for the
general population and for various segments of the popula￾tion who may have characteristics different from the general
population.
10 MODEL SELECTION
The emphasis of this chapter has been on indoor air
modeling of air concentrations of contaminants. For this
use, the models and tools discussed provide foundation in
the principles. There are many additional models to estimate
air concentrations of contaminants available, as briefly
discussed in Section 9. Given the diversity of the models,
how does one decide on the appropriate one to use? The
answer is one that is simple enough to use but adequate to
142MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INDOOR AIR CONTAMINANT CONCENTRATIONS
provide a relevant answer that can support an appropriate
decision. The model needs to answer the question at hand
and should be relevant to the exposure scenario and your
substance of interest. For example, many models do not work
well for particulates. Other models are specific to worker or
consumer exposures. Some models are based on established
tasks or activities that may not be relevant to the scenario
to assess. Often it makes sense to start simple and go more
complex if necessary. That is, if a very simple and probably
biased high model gives a “no problem” answer the process
may end. However, more sophistication may be required, so
a “tiered” approach advocated for occupational modeling
applies (58). Modelers may also conduct a literature search
to find if others have modeled air concentrations for similar
scenarios to the one at hand, and if so, which models were
considered and used.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sensors are devices designed to detect changes in the envi￾ronment. They are incorporated into direct-reading instru￾ments (DRIs), in which sampling and analysis of the sensor
signal are carried out. They typically provide a high temporal
resolution output (that may include multiple measurements
per second) and are increasingly available for a variety of
agents relevant to occupational exposures. The term “sensor”
has been informally used as a catch-all that includes instru￾ments spanning a wide range of costs and capabilities.
As such, “sensors” can include benchtop devices which
provide high accuracy and precision measurements costing
over $100 000, down to single or multi-gas instruments and
safety alarms costing $50 or less. More commonly the term
“sensors” refers to DRIs appropriate for initial site surveys
and personal exposure monitoring or assessment (typically
in the $500–$5000 price range). Recently, a multitude of
low-cost sensors have entered the market with applications
for a variety of physical and chemical hazards (typically
less than $1000). Both low-cost sensors and traditionally
used DRIs are generally small, lightweight, and often run
on battery power, making them ideal for occupational uses.
Although DRIs have been used in occupational exposure
assessments for decades, their cost and complexity have
presented barriers for their widespread use. Low-cost sensors
represent an opportunity for new exposure assessment strate￾gies in occupational health.
Low-cost sensors often rely on indirect sensing tech￾niques, but in many cases, sensors use the same princi￾ples of operation as more expensive equipment. Some
manufacturers have reduced costs by using less expensive

components, which can result in reduced data accuracy and
precision. Users of sensors must have a clear understanding
of the principles of operation and biases for each sensor to
evaluate if it is fit for the purpose under the desired conditions
and to ensure data are interpreted with maximum reliability.
An advantage of the increased accessibility presented by low￾cost sensors as compared to integrated sampling methods,
is that they increase the number of samples for which a
practitioner may measure on-site with immediate results.
This approach reduces some concern over physical loss of
sampling media (though loss of digital data is still possible)
and can reduce sampling costs by eliminating consumables
and analysis costs. However, most sensors require periodic
calibration of varying complexity, sometimes as often as
daily. Failure to appreciate the importance of calibration
can result in data with unacceptable accuracy, precision, or
integrity. Finally, sensors can produce a data stream with
many more points than integrated methods. This can be both
an advantage and a disadvantage. The high temporal resolu￾tion information can allow for unique exposure assessment
opportunities (see Section 5), but the large amount of data
can result in highly spatially and temporally correlated data,
which can complicate data analyses for statistical approaches
that assume independence of individual measurements and
poses important challenges for data management beyond the
typical expertise of industrial hygienists.
When evaluating sensors for use in occupational expo￾sure assessment, there can be many competing instruments
to choose from for any specific application. Determining
which is best and how data from different devices compare
can be difficult. Several performance characteristics should
145PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
be evaluated prior to purchasing a sensor. Sensitivity is the
change in the measured signal per a unit change in the agent
intensity. Resolution is the smallest change in agent inten￾sity that can be detected by the sensor. Dynamic range is
the analyte range for which the sensor’s response is linear.
Selectivity, also referred to as specificity, relates to the
ability of the sensor to respond to, and only to, the agent of
interest. A sensor’s limit of detection (LOD) is the lowest
detectable agent level at which the sensor response is statis￾tically greater than in the absence of the agent. A sensor’s
limit of quantification (LOQ) is the lowest detectible agent
level at which a sensor can quantitatively respond with a
stated accuracy and precision. Response time is the amount
of time it takes for a sensor to respond to a change in inten￾sity. Sensors can also be subject to a dead band, wherein a
sensor is unresponsive to a range of hazard levels resulting
in an output equal to zero. These metrics can vary substan￾tially for different sensors. For example, the lower the cost
of a sensor, typically the higher the LOD, which can pose a
challenge for sampling in relatively low concentration envi￾ronments (1).
This chapter explores low-cost sensors with some
comparisons to traditional sampling and commonly used
DRIs, where appropriate. This chapter will focus on three
categories of sensors: particulate matter (PM) (Section 2),
gases (Section 3), and physical agents (Section 4). The
types of sensors, their operating principles, and advantages
and disadvantages are described in the sections below and
summarized in Table 1. Throughout the chapter, specific
instruments are listed as examples, but do not constitute an
endorsement of any particular instrument or device.
2 PARTICULATE MATTER (PM)
SENSORS
PM hazards in the workplace come from a variety of sources,
such as combustion engine exhaust, silica dust, and welding
fume (2, 3). Exposure to PM has been associated with cardio￾vascular events and disease, lung cancer, and a variety of
adverse health effects, such as inflammation, oxidative stress,
decreased lung function, increased respiratory disease, and
infection (4–8). Although there are many PM metrics that
may have health relevance (e.g. particle number or surface
area), regulatory standards for PM specify the use of gravi￾metric, filter-based samples to measure PM mass concentra￾tions for compliance measurements (9). Many DRIs directly
or indirectly provide measurements of PM mass concentra￾tion. Industrial hygienists use DRIs as screening tools and
to supplement time-weighted average measurements with
higher temporal resolution information (2). In some cases,
gravimetric filter samples are taken alongside the direct￾reading measurements.
2.1 Direct Measures of PM Mass
Concentration
While most PM DRIs rely on light-scatting principles to
provide indirect measurements of PM concentration (Section
2.2), one instrument that provides direct mass measurements
is the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM).
The principle of operation of the TEOM relies on detecting
the change in frequency of a filter mounted on an oscillating
element as it loads with PM. This instrument’s response is

independent of the size, shape, composition or other particle
characteristics. Benchtop TEOMs are commonly found in
stationary ambient air quality monitoring sites, but the tech￾nology has been miniaturized in a package for portable or
personal measurements (e.g. Personal Dust Monitor, “PDM”
Thermo Scientific, Franklin, MA) (10). With a cost of over
$15 000, this instrument falls somewhere between typical
portable DRIs and high-grade, stationary benchtop instru￾ments. The PDM instrument shows very good agreement
with established filter-based personal sampling methods for
coal dust and has been approved by the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Mine Safety
and Health Administration (MSHA) for continuous and inte￾grated measurement of respirable dust in mines, including for
compliance purposes (11). Currently, there are no low-cost
sensors with a similar principle of operation.
2.2 Indirect Measures of PM Mass
Concentration
Aerosol photometers measure the amount of light scattered
by many particles in an air sample volume, and the amount of
scattered light is linearly related to the aerosol mass concen￾tration (12). A light source is placed on one side of a sensing
volume, through which air will flow, and a detector is placed
on an angle from the light source. Some of the light scattered
by particles in the sensing volume reaches the detector. The
amount of light incident on the detector is linearly related
to the mass concentration (Figure 1a). The wavelength of
light and angle of the detector are selected to minimize
the effect of particle size, shape, and refractive index (12).
Particles must be large enough to scatter enough light to
contribute to the signal, so only particles larger than approxi￾mately 0.2 μm are detected by photometers. Photometers are
factory-calibrated to a known aerosol type, often road dust,
that may have characteristics that are different than particles
encountered in workplaces. The concentrations reported by
the photometer using the factory calibration can be useful to
compare concentrations over time or between locations, but
may be substantially different than the true mass concentra￾tion because the sample PM composition may be different
than the calibration PM composition; errors up to a factor
of five are not uncommon (13). To produce more precise
estimates of mass concentration, it is common to correct
the photometer with a gravimetric correction factor. To
produce the gravimetric correction factor, the photometer is
co-located with a filter over the same duration. The ratio
of the filter-based gravimetric mass concentration to the
time-weighted average photometric-based mass concentra￾tion provides a multiplicative correction factor that can be
applied to each photometric measurement. This correction
factor assumes that the properties of the aerosol are constant
during the duration of the filter sample.
Optical particle counters (OPCs) measure light scattered
from each particle individually (Figure 1b) (14). If the
composition of the particle is known, the scattered light
intensity can be used to size the particle (12, 15). Calibra￾tions are developed by manufacturers to determine sensors’
response to particles of a known size with relevant chem￾ical compositions. Then a sampled particle is assigned to
a size bin based on these calibrations (12). Commercially
available instruments typically size particles into 5–16 size
channels and cover the range from 0.1 to 5.0 μm, though
some instruments can detect smaller and/or larger parti￾cles (12). OPCs are also limited by the maximum number
concentration that can be accurately sampled due to the
need to have a single particle in the illumination path at a
time. When particle number concentrations are very high
(actual concentration is highly instrument-specific; typically,
greater than 104 cm−3), more than one particle will be illu￾minated at a time which will lead to erroneous measures.

147PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
If the particle density and shape are known or assumed, the
measured particle size distribution can be used to estimate the
particle mass concentration. Gravimetric correction factors
(as described for photometers) may also be useful to calcu￾late mass concentration.
Particles may be hygroscopic, meaning they absorb water
vapor from the air which increases their size. Larger particles
will scatter more light resulting in increased response by
the light-scattering devices (16, 17). However, this deposited
water is not particle mass and leads to an overestimation
of the true mass concentration. As such, relative humidity
(RH) is an important factor affecting these measurements.
RH artifact corrections have been reported in the literature
for some devices (18, 19).
Industrial hygienists have used instruments which rely
on light scattering for at least three decades to provide
time-resolved measurements of aerosol mass concentra￾tion (e.g. Personal Data Rams, “pDRs” Thermo Scientific,
Franklin, MA; DustTrak TSI Inc., Shoreview MN; Portable
Aerosol Spectrometers, “PASs” Grimm Technologies Inc.,
Douglasville, GA). These portable photometers and OPCs
currently cost from $3000 to $10 000 and from $7000 to
$15 000, respectively (20).
2.2.1 Devices That Incorporate Light Scattering
and Gravimetric Elements
There are a limited number of devices that integrate both
direct-reading photometry and gravimetric capabilities.
These devices address the challenges related to the refractive
indices of aerosols and variations in size distribution by
including an in-line filter for gravimetric correction of the
direct-reading optical measurements. Two examples are
the pDR-1500 (Thermo Scientific, Franklin, MA) and the
microPEM (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC).
Both instruments are portable/wearable and can be used for
personal exposure measurements. As with many low-cost
sensors, baseline drift is a problem (21) that requires correc￾tion (22), but the gravimetric measurement provides a way
to correct the data.
2.2.2 Commodity Sensors for Commercial Customers,
Researchers, and Hobbyists
Recently, technological advances have resulted in a large
number of low-cost “commodity” sensors, some of which are
geared towards commercial customers that manufacture their
own equipment or instruments, while others were designed
for integration into heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) and air filtration systems to detect dust. Commodity
sensors have also gained popularity with researchers and
hobbyists. Inexpensive commodity sensors ($10–$500) are
produced by many manufacturers including Beijing Plan￾tower Co., Ltd. (Beijing, ROC), Alphasense Ltd. (Essex,
UK), and Shinyei Corporation of America (New York, NY).
These low-cost commodity sensors may have fans that draw
in air or may be passive, relying on room airflow to intro￾duce air into the sensor. Sensors with fan-powered airflow
may have virtual impactors that provide coarse size selec￾tivity, whereas, passive sensors cannot provide any specific
information on size-fractionated PM.
Commodity sensors must be integrated with microcon￾trollers into larger hardware assemblies, such as monitors
or networks before they can provide aerosol concentration
measurements, which can pose a substantial burden for the
casual user (23). These PM sensors generally operate on
photometric or OPC principles of light scattering, requiring
calibration to translate sensor signal to concentration by end
users. Many academic groups have undertaken efforts to
calibrate these sensors, characterize their performance, and
evaluate their suitability for providing aerosol mass concen￾tration measurements (24–26). In these evaluations, different
types of commodity sensors generally exhibited a linear
response over application-specific concentration ranges, but
responded differently to different types of aerosol, different
aerosol size distributions, and required individual calibration
curves (24–27). Similar to higher-grade instruments, low￾cost commodity PM sensors are also subject to the effects
of RH (25).
Recently, several manufacturers have developed commer￾cialized low-cost, consumer aerosol monitors (CAMs,
<$500) (28). These monitors are built with the inexpensive
commodity sensors described above and may be equipped
with features such as a fan to provide airflow, digital display,
datalogging capabilities, internet connectivity, and computer
and smartphone interfaces. Examples of sensor manufac￾turers include the Dylos Corporation (Riverside, CA), Airvis
(“Speck” Pittsburgh, PA), PurpleAir (Wilmington, DE), and
Airboxlab (“foobot” San Francisco, CA); however, new
firms and products are continually entering the market.
Laboratory and field evaluations of CAMs have shown
generally strong correlations with reference instruments.
However, variable degrees of bias among CAMs have
been observed for different types of PM sources (28–30).
Furthermore, poor performance for concentrations above
200 μg m−3 has been reported and these concentrations are
often exceeded in the workplace (28, 30). CAMs are initially
factory calibrated, but details on these calibrations are often
not provided to the users. Instead, for best performance, end￾users of these devices should make the necessary gravimetric
corrections to yield accurate PM measurements. Current
CAMs do not meet the accuracy and reliability requirements
for compliance-based industrial hygiene applications and are
typically capable only of total particle number concentration
or environmentally relevant particulate metrics including
mass concentrations of PM with diameter less than 2.5 or
10 μm (PM2.5 and PM10). One drawback of some CAMs
for industrial hygiene applications is that many have been
148SENSORS
designed for monitoring indoor air; they are not portable nor
wearable and may require Wi-Fi networking for data collec￾tion, limiting their use for personal occupational exposure
assessment.
2.3 Novel Aerosol Metrics Unrelated
to Regulatory Standards
Novel sensors are entering the market that capture poten￾tially health-relevant information through metrics other than
aerosol mass concentration. For example, ultrafine parti￾cles (UFPs) are particles with diameter less than 0.1 μm
which contribute little to the total mass concentration despite
the fact that they typically dominate the particle number
concentration (12). A major source of UFPs is combustion,
including diesel-powered vehicles (31), but they have been
measured at a variety of work environments (32). In addi￾tion, UFPs that have been engineered to have useful prop￾erties, sometimes called engineered nanoparticles, have seen
wide application in industry, medicine, and consumer goods
over the last decade. UFPs are small enough to pass through
the respiratory system, cross the blood–brain barrier, and
disperse in body tissues and organs (33). The independent
health effects of UFPs are not well established, but an expert
panel that reviewed current evidence concluded that UFPs
likely cause increased all-cause mortality, hospital admis￾sions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, aggravation
of asthma symptoms, and decreases in lung function (34–36).
UFPs pose a challenge to measure because they have
diameters smaller than the wavelengths of light used in
optical-light scattering devices, so they are not detected
by photometers or OPCs. Wearable diffusion classifiers
(e.g. DiscMini, Matter Aerosol, Switzerland; Partector,
Naneos, Switzerland; and Nano Tracer, Phillips Aerasense,
Netherlands) charge particles and draw them into an elec￾trometer that converts the signal to particle surface area,
number concentration, and mean diameter (37, 38). Diffu￾sion classifiers have been used to characterize personal
exposure to UFPs in urban microenvironments (39) and
among highway maintenance workers (40). Miniaturized
condensation particle counters (MiniCPCs) increase the size
of UFPs by condensing water vapor onto them so that they
can be measured optically by light-scattering instruments.
MiniCPCs are small enough to be worn and have been used
to assess UFP exposure in children (41) and respirator effi￾cacy (42). Wearable electrothermal piezoresistive cantilever
resonators have been piloted in workplaces to provide direct￾reading nanoparticle measurements (43), and miniaturized
silicon resonant microcantilever mass balances and minia￾turized electrostatic precipitators have been incorporated
into a pocket-sized instrument (44). Nanoparticle sensor
development is still in the early stages and the electronics
are more expensive than photometers (nanoparticle sensors
generally cost $8000 or more). However, demand from
the environmental and industrial hygiene fields is driving
research and development (2).
Black carbon particles are emitted during combustion and
may have a stronger deleterious effect on health compared
to PM generally (45). Aethalometers measure black carbon
concentration through light-absorbing characteristics, in
contrast to light scattering characteristics. Particles from
an air stream are collected on a spot of filter tape within
the aethalometer. The instrument’s light source is directed
onto the spot where carbonaceous particles absorb and
attenuate the amount of light that passes through the filter
to the detector. The increased light attenuation between two
sequential measurements is proportional to the increase in
the mass of light-absorbing material collected on the filter
(which can be converted to the concentration in air). The
filter tape advances to a “clean” spot when the density of
light-absorbing material reaches a pre-determined limit.
Pocket-sized Aethalometers (e.g. MicroAeth, AethLabs,
San Francisco, CA) that measure black carbon agree
well with full-size benchtop aethalometers (46) and have
been used in personal exposure assessment in transport
microenvironments (47).
3 GAS SENSORS
Many gases in industrial settings can adversely affect worker
health. The species, duration, and concentration of an expo￾sure will determine the severity of the health effects, which
can range from an irritating cough to premature death. For
example, acute exposures to hazardous welding gases can
result in irritation of the nasal passages, throat, and lungs,
but chronic exposures can result in cancer, emphysema,
or damage to the kidneys (48). More than 700 chemical
substances for which the American Conference of Govern￾mental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has established
industry-wide exposure limits are gases. Thus, it is not
surprising that no single instrument or even class of sensors
is able to quantify concentrations of all hazardous gases. For
many industrial hygienists, a common practice is the use of
single or multi-gas instruments, which may be comprised of
several types of sensors such as electrochemical (EC) and
metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOX) sensors. Each of these
types of sensors has specific advantages, lifetimes, limits of
detection, and calibration requirements, so it is important
to be knowledgeable about the type of sensor that is being
utilized (Figure 2).

and combustible gases when exposed to a simple elec￾trical circuit (52, 53). Since then, EC sensor technology has
been developed for both oxidizing and reducing gases. The
detection mechanism requires oxidation or reduction of the
analyte resulting in the generation of an electric current (54).
EC sensors typically contain a gas-permeable hydrophobic
barrier, an electrolyte, a sensing electrode (or working elec￾trode), a counter electrode (or auxiliary electrode), and some￾times a third reference electrode (55) (Figure 3a). After
entering the sensor through the gas-permeable hydrophobic
barrier, the sample air contacts the sensing electrode, which
is bathed in the electrolyte and it is either oxidized or
reduced, depending on the analyte (Figure 3a). When the
analyte is oxidized (e.g. CO), the counter electrode func￾tions as a cathode and the sensing electrode operates as an
anode for the purpose of completing the circuit to allow the
charge to flow. Conversely, when the analyte is reduced by
the chemical reaction of the sensor (e.g. O3), the sensing
electrode functions as the cathode, and the counter electrode
functions as the anode. The electrodes work as catalysts in
these reactions, and the electrolyte provides the electron that
is consumed.
150SENSORS
Example Oxidation∶ CO + H2O → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e−
Example Reduction∶ O3 + 2H+ + 2e− → O2 + H2O
The reference electrode is an electrode that is not exposed
to the resultant current from the reaction. Since the sensing
electrode will degrade over time, a reference electrode is
introduced to assess the sensor’s performance. There are
some EC sensors that have more electrodes, but the working
principle is consistent with a three-electrode system.
Most EC sensors are designed so that the gas concen￾tration in the sensing compartment is limited by diffusion,
which results in an output that is linearly proportional to
the ambient gas concentration (54). This is one strength
of EC sensors because a linear response allows for more
precise measurement at low concentrations and fewer cali￾bration points needed. The hydrophobic barrier also prevents
the electrolyte from leaking out of the sensor (56). The
sensor’s signal will deteriorate if the electrolyte evaporates
too quickly. In some sensors, a filter is installed in front of
the barrier to increase sensitivity and selectivity by filtering
out unwanted gases or particulates. The material of the elec￾trodes and electrolyte are key factors since sensitivity and
selectivity are strongly influenced by the type and the struc￾ture of the electrode material and the electrolyte must facil￾itate the desired reaction efficiently (57–59). The electrodes
are typically fabricated by fixing metal with large surface
area on a porous hydrophobic membrane (55).
EC sensors can be divided into three quantification
methods: amperometry, voltammetry, and coulometry (60,
61). In amperometric EC sensors, a resistor is connected
across the electrodes. A fixed potential is applied to the
sensing electrode, and when a current from the oxidation or
reduction reaction occurs, the resultant current is measured,
which is proportional to the gas concentration (60). Potentio￾metric EC sensors (i.e. voltammetry) measure the potential
difference (in volts) between the sensing electrode and the
reference electrode (62). The sensing electrode’s potential
is governed by the concentration of the analyte in the gas
phase, and the reference electrode provides a stable refer￾ence potential. Conductometric EC sensors (i.e. coulometry)
measure the conductivity change in the presence of a given
solute concentration (60, 63). Amperometric and Potentio￾metric EC sensors are the most common for gas detection
and generally have similar response times, dynamic ranges,
and sensitivities (62).
EC sensors can facilitate sensitive and selective analyses
of numerous gas-phase species at a high time resolution
(typically on the order of seconds) and at a low cost (<$100
each). In addition, EC sensors have low power requirements
to operate. In fact, the power requirement is the lowest
among all sensor types currently available for gas monitoring
(64). Their small size (e.g. Alphasense Ltd. EC sensors are
round with diameter of either 20 or 32 mm) also permits
measurements in a broad range of locations.
However, there are also two notable limitations of EC
sensors. First, their life expectancy is highly dependent on
the desired analyte and environmental conditions (54, 55, 61,
65, 66). When operated and stored in recommended condi￾tions, EC sensors generally have a lifetime of 1–3 years,
but actual lifetimes can be on the order of months when
concentrations are high or extremes in temperature or RH
are encountered. It can be difficult to predict when a sensor
will begin to lose sensitivity, so frequent calibration of EC
sensors may be needed to ensure accurate data are produced.
EC sensors frequently degrade at a faster rate when exposed
to heavily polluted conditions. For example, the lifetime of
ammonia EC sensors is directly related to its exposure to
ammonia because the electrolyte is consumed as the reac￾tion occurs, so doubling the concentration will halve the
life expectancy (67). Temperature and RH extremes can also
notably affect sensor lifetimes. The ideal storing and oper￾ating conditions for EC sensors is 20 ∘C and 60% RH. Expo￾sures to high temperatures can enhance the evaporation of the
electrolyte, thus reducing sensitivity and lifetimes. Repeated
exposures to temperatures outside of the suggested operating
temperatures have been observed to shift the baseline (i.e.
the response measured when no gas is present or present
below the LOD), which can introduce additional complica￾tions during data analyses (66). In addition, exposures to
very low temperatures can reduce sensitivity by as much as
80% and decrease response times (66). Even if EC sensors
are operated within the suggested temperature range, the
predicted value for a constant concentration may vary as
a function of temperature. For this purpose, it is useful to
expose the sensors to a known concentration over a broad
range of temperatures and humidities to evaluate the influ￾ence of these parameters on the predicted concentrations
prior to their use. These influences can often be corrected
for during post-processing if the EC sensors were co-located
with temperature sensors during the measurement period.
The most important factor governing sensor lifetime is RH
(66). When the RH increases beyond 60% RH, water can be
absorbed into the electrolyte causing dilution or leaking, and
when the ambient air is below 60% RH, the electrolyte solu￾tion will begin to evaporate, concentrating the electrolyte.
Dilution and concentration of the electrolyte solution can be
reversible if the sensor is exposed to RH levels of the opposite
extreme (66). EC sensors are minimally affected by pressure
changes (65).
The second important limitation of EC sensors is cross￾sensitivity to interfering gases, or non-targeted gases, that
will also be detected by the sensor resulting in inaccu￾rate estimates of the desired analyte. It is vital to under￾stand the effects of potential interferants on each type of
EC sensor in operation. In some reactions, the interfering
effect is positive, resulting in values that are higher than
151PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
the actual concentrations; whereas in other sensors, the
interference is negative, resulting in values that are lower
than the actual concentrations. The addition of a chemical
filter or compensator may be able to increase specificity of
the sensor. For example, CO and H2S EC sensors use similar
measurement designs, but in order to reduce the interferant
effect, most CO EC sensors include an internal activated
carbon filter to remove the H2S before it reaches the sensing
electrode (67).
3.2 Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Sensors
MOX sensors were also developed in the 1960s when it was
found that certain chemicals react rapidly with the surface
of thin semiconductor films (e.g. a transition or heavy metal
oxide film) at high temperatures (68). When a semiconductor
film is heated to a high temperature (typically between 150
and 400 ∘C), oxygen adsorbs onto the film by capturing elec￾trons in the semiconductor film (69). This reaction will either
increase the resistance, referred to as n-type MOX sensors,
or decrease the resistance of the sensor, p-type, depending on
the sensor design. When the target analyte is present, it will
react with the oxygen or metal oxide film, allowing a current
to flow freely through the sensor and producing a measurable
change in the conductivity (or resistivity) of the metal oxide.
The change in conductivity (or resistivity) is logarithmically
proportional to the analyte gas concentration. The magnitude
of the change is also dependent on the resistance of the film
and whether the analyte is an oxidizing or reducing gas.
MOX sensors are typically composed of sensing and
counter electrodes connected by a thin metal oxide film
over a heating element (Figure 3b). The metal oxide film
is mounted on sintered ceramic inside a flame arrestor, a
device that permits gas to flow through while blocking a
flame. While this method was first demonstrated with zinc
oxide (ZnO), many other metal oxides have been found to
be suitable for detecting combustible, reducing, or oxidizing
gases (70–72). Tungsten trioxide (WO3) and tin dioxide
(SnO2) are the most widely used metal oxides for gas sensing
applications (73). Since the metal oxides films have a large
surface area, the sensitivity can be as low as parts per
billion (ppb) (71). The sensitivity may be altered by changing
the temperature of the heating element. Heating the metal
oxide film above 100 ∘C reduces effects of ambient condi￾tions and improves selectivity. Doping the primary metal
oxide with a secondary metal oxide, called binary oxides,
can also enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of a sensor
(70). For example, SnO2 doped with 0.5% strontium oxide
(SrO) increased the sensor’s ability to measure nitrous oxide
(N2O) by a factor of four (70). MOX sensors may also
be referred to as heated metal oxide sensors (HMOSs) or
chemiresistors.
MOX sensors also have a high time resolution (typically
on the order of seconds to minutes), a low price point
($10–$500 per sensor), and a small footprint. Although both
EC and MOX sensors are constrained by cross-sensitivities,
the interferant may be different for each type of sensor. For
example, a MOX ozone sensor exhibits a cross-sensitivity
to volatile organic compounds (VOCs); whereas, EC ozone
sensors can be highly sensitive to NO2. These distinctions
allow users to pick which sensor is best suited for their
measurement environment. MOX sensors typically have
longer operational lifetimes of about three to five years, and
when stored in proper conditions, the time spent in storage
will not reduce the operational lifetime of the sensor. There
are also several limitations of this sensing method. MOX
sensors are sensitive to a broad range of gases, but selec￾tivity can be a major concern (63, 71). The presence of other
gases reacting with the metal oxide may increase or decrease
charge carrier concentration, making sensor readings inac￾curate. For example, VOCs have been shown to strongly
react with SnO2. VOCs are ubiquitous in the ambient air
since there are numerous anthropogenic and natural sources,
and they exhibit a broad range of properties, which make
them difficult to completely filter. This is a major limitation
since nearly all environments have some type of VOC source,
thus the impact of this interferant, as well as others, should
be considered when using MOX sensors. MOX sensors are
also particularly affected by RH since water interacts with
metal oxides and alters the conductivity of the film (49). For
example, SnO2 exhibits decreased response time and larger
responses in the presence of high RH (49). MOX sensors
may also exhibit hysteresis in humid environments (74, 75).
Signal hysteresis is a difference between two measurements
obtained at the same concentration because the sensor was in
different conditions prior to the measurements. For example,
a sensor may yield a different value for 50 ppb if the prior
concentration was 25 ppb when compared to measurements
with a prior concentration of 75 ppb (i.e. depending on if the
concentration was increasing or decreasing).
MOX sensors also need relatively frequent calibra￾tions. Two major factors influence the longevity of a MOX
sensor’s calibration. First, the heat output may increase after
protracted use, which results in baseline drift over time, and
second, the sensor may become “poisoned” by interferant
gases irreversibly bonding to the metal oxide film (74, 75).
Some research suggests that a calibration is valid for about
two to three months (75). MOX sensors may also exhibit a
non-linear response requiring more calibration points (71).
3.3 Other Gas Sensing Technologies
In addition to EC and MOX sensors, there are several
other gas sensing methodologies. A common instrument is
152SENSORS
a photoionization detector (PID), often used for measuring
VOCs. PID sensors use ultraviolet (UV) light to ionize gas
molecules, decomposing neutral molecules into positive and
negative ions. These ions are passed through two polarized
electrodes and as the ions move towards the electrodes,
an electric current is produced which is converted to a
voltage by the sensor (76). This voltage is proportional to
concentration. The lamp in a PID will typically function
for between 5000 and 10 000 operational hours (approxi￾mately 208–417 days), but the output will decline as the
lamp ages. Routine re-calibration is needed to compensate
for this effect (76). PID sensors have high temporal resolu￾tion and a wide range of prices depending on electronics and
detection limits ($500–10 000), but they can exhibit signal
drift and are not selective (50). PID sensors are not selective
because they ionize any molecule with an ionization energy
less than or equal to the lamp output, typically about 10 eV.
However, the biggest drawback may be the high detection
limits (in the parts per million range) (76, 77). High concen￾trations of methane, temperature fluctuations, strong elec￾trical fields, and high RH can also affect the accuracy of the
sensor.
Calorimetric gas sensors detect the presence and concen￾tration of combustible gases (e.g. ammonia) by measuring
heat produced from a gas on the sensor surface. Response
time of calorimetric gas sensors is in the range of millisec￾onds and the output is linear, but the major drawback is
low selectivity. The most widely utilized sensors using the
method is known as the pellistor (78–80).
Optical gas sensors determine analyte gas concentration
by leveraging the characteristic optical absorption in the UV,
visible, near-infrared, or mid-infrared regions of the elec￾tromagnetic spectrum of a given gas species. A nondisper￾sive infrared (NDIR) sensor is one of the more commonly
used optical sensors and is frequently used to measure CO2.
These sensors are compact, low-cost, exhibit long opera￾tional and storage lifetime, and have less frequent recalibra￾tion needs. However, optical sensors are not able to discrim￾inate between gas species if their absorption lines overlap,
and they are sensitive to temperature and pressure changes
(81).
4 PHYSICAL AGENTS
In addition to PM and gases, there are many other environ￾mental factors that support a safe environment in industrial
settings that may need to be monitored, such as ionizing and
nonionizing electromagnetic radiation, noise, vibration, air
flow, and temperature (2, 82). Similar to the evolution of
sensors designed for chemical exposures, the trend for these
types of sensors is toward producing small wearable sensors
that can generate real-time quantitative data.
4.1 Sound Levels and Noise Exposure
Occupational noise exposure leads to hearing impair￾ment, hypertension, annoyance, and may be associated
with biochemical effects, immune effects, and changes in
absentee rate and performance (83). Noise monitoring has
been conducted for decades, and it is the most common
type of physical agent monitoring. Noise dosimeters can
function as area or personal noise monitors (84, 85). Typi￾cally, personal noise measurement is conducted with noise
dosimeters worn by workers, and advancements have led to
dosimeters that can be fitted inside earplugs or earmuffs to
obtain an “in-ear” noise exposure (84). Modern dosimeters
are designed to provide the user with parameters such as
instantaneous sound pressure level (the local pressure devi￾ation from atmospheric pressure caused by a sound wave),
maximum, minimum, and time-weighted average, such as
an eight-hour average. A noise dosimeter is comprised of
a transducer (the microphone), an electronic amplifier, and
a calibrated attenuator for gain control (86). A transducer
measures sound pressure and transforms it into an electric
signal that is converted into the sound level. There are
several type of microphones available (i.e. condenser, piezo￾electric, electret, or dynamic) so it is important to ensure
that the instrument selected will be accurate in the expected
conditions (86). Briefly, piezoelectric microphones, often
used in sound survey meters, are stable, robust, and not
substantially influenced by ambient conditions. Condenser
microphones, often used in precision sound level meters, are
more accurate than the other types, but they are more prone
to being affected by dirt and RH. The electret is a condenser
microphone that has been modified to be less sensitive to
dirt and humidity. Some lower-cost noise sensors have been
described using this type of microphone (87). The dynamic
microphone is more mechanically resistant than the other
three, but its poor frequency response severely limits its
use. Novel smartphone technology also allows workers to
collect personal noise measurements. The “NIOSH Sound
Level Meter” mobile application is a tool that measures
sound levels in the workplace using the built-in cell phone
microphone and reports the instantaneous sound level (88).
Users should be aware that the accuracy may depend on
the quality of the built-in microphone. Alternatively, the
application also allows users to collect measurements with
an external microphone connected through the headset jack
and to calibrate it with a known source. Microphones need
to be individually calibrated before and after each measure￾ment by applying a known sound pressure level at a fixed
frequency (such as 1 KHz at 114 dB) to the microphone. The
dosimeter and calibrator should also be factory calibrated
every two years. Noise dosimetry measurements are sensi￾tive to changes in atmospheric pressure (85). Additional
information about noise and hearing conservation can be
found in Noise and Hearing Conservation.
153PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
4.2 Temperature
Excessive exposure to heat can cause a range of health
effects, from heat rash to heat exhaustion and heat stroke
(89). Temperature sensors can be used to determine whether
a working environment maintains a satisfactory tempera￾ture. This can be achieved by installing a series of ther￾mocouple sensors to identify thermal gradients within a
room. A thermocouple is a sensor made of two electrical
conductors (called thermoelements or legs) joined at one end,
called the junction or measuring end. The measuring end is
installed in the area to be characterized, while the control
end is held at ambient temperature. A thermocouple gener￾ates a voltage as a result of the thermoelectric effect, which
is used to determine the temperature. Another option is to
employ temperature-sensitive paints (TSPs) (90–93). TSPs
are paints that contain nanothermometers with thermally
sensitive molecules that fluoresce as a function of tempera￾ture. TSPs permit comprehensive assessments of temperature
in a given environment and can be used to identify temper￾atures as low as 25 ∘C up to greater than 500 ∘C. Recent
advancements have produced paints that are sensitive to both
pressure and temperature changes at resolutions of 22 mbar
and 4.3 ∘C, respectively (94). Temperature sensors have also
been used to monitor tool condition. For example, metal
cutting generates a substantial amount of heat in room, which
may increase as the tool ages. An online method for thermo￾coupled tool temperature measurements has been available
since the late 1980s, but research indicates the most effective
sensing option is with non-contact measurement techniques,
such as infrared thermal imaging (95–97). It is also possible
to monitor worker core body temperatures in real-time over
several days using new ingestible capsules (98). This sensor
consists of a receiver and an ingestible capsule whose resis￾tance is dependent on temperature. Additional information
about the effects of temperature on heat stress can be found
in Heat Stress.
4.3 Vibration
Workplace vibration is generally categorized into local vibra￾tion and whole-body vibration (WBV) (99). Local vibration,
experienced by machine operators in their hand/arms, for
example, can lead to injuries or chronic disorders, such as
hand-arm vibration syndrome (100). Vibration sensors can
be used to monitor the condition of industrial tools (96, 101).
Tool vibration can be indicative of its condition. For example,
an aged drill will vibrate more and increase exposures for tool
users. This vibration can be sensed using a miniature highly
sensitive 3-D accelerometer (101, 102). An accelerometer
acts as a damped mass on a spring. When the mass is moved
due to vibration, the displacement is converted into an elec￾trical signal that is measured to determine the acceleration.
Additional information about the effects of vibration can be
found in Hand-Arm Vibration.
In contrast, WBV is often experienced by workers that
operate trucks, trains, tractors, and heavy machinery, and is
associated with degraded comfort, interference with work
activities, motion sickness, and cardiovascular, respiratory,
endocrine, central nervous system, and musculoskeletal
(particularly low-back pain and injuries) health effects
(99, 103). The important characteristics of WBV include
vibration frequency, magnitude (displacement, velocity, or
acceleration), direction, and duration (99, 104, 105), which
have recently been measured using consumer-grade sensors
(105) and sensor networks (104) with the aim of quantifying
and controlling worker exposure.
4.4 Radiation
Non-ionizing radiation refers to any type of electromagnetic
radiation that only has enough energy to excite a molecule;
whereas ionizing radiation (i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, or
X-ray radiation) has a higher energy and can modify a
molecule (106, 107). Exposure to non-ionizing radiation
can lead to non-mutagenic biological effects, such as burns,
but exposure to ionizing radiation can cause much more
serious effects, such as radiation sickness, cancer, and
genetic damage. There are three main categories of radiation
detectors: gas-filled detectors, which are the most commonly
used, scintillators, and solid-state detectors (108). The basic
operation of a gas-filled detector is the collection of charges
created by direct ionization of a sample. Gas-filled detec￾tors are filled with a gas that characteristically does not
interact with electrons, typically a noble gas such as argon
or helium, so any produced charges are due to the presence
of radiation in the sample (108). Gas-filled detectors are
divided into three subcategories based on the method of
applied voltage: ionization chambers, proportional counters,
and Geiger–Mueller (G–M) tubes. G–M tubes, often simply
referred to as “Geiger Counters”, are one of the oldest
versions of radiation detectors and are still commonly used
because of their handheld size, low cost, and ease of use.
One drawback of this method is that the detector cannot
differentiate between radiation types. Scintillation detec￾tors use photomultiplier tubes and photodiodes to measure
the characteristic flash of light that a photon of radiation
produces when it interacts with the scintillator material
(108). Scintillation detectors are highly sensitive and can
differentiate between radioactive materials. The operational
principal of a solid-state semiconductor is similar to a simple
gas-filled detector but at a much smaller scale. A solid-state
semiconductor detector uses a semiconductor, such a silicon
or germanium crystal, to measure the effect of incident
charged particles or photons (109, 110). The absorption of
ionizing radiation generates electrons and electron-deficient

concentrations. (c) Sensors can be distributed in a sensor network, possibly using wireless data connectivity (denoted by the Wi-Fi symbol

sites, called holes, in the semiconducting material. The
movement of these electrons creates a pulse of current
that is amplified and analyzed. Solid-state semiconductor
detectors are highly sensitive devices that exhibit a response
to single photons and have been used to accurately measure
occupational radiation dose rates in real-time (109). Addi￾tional information about ionizing radiation measurements
can be found in Ionizing Radiation.
5 APPROACHES FOR SENSOR USE
Traditional industrial hygiene sampling has focused on
compliance monitoring (111, 112), that is, to evaluate if a
workplace is in compliance with regulatory occupational
exposure limits (OELs). Most regulatory OELs are specified
for time-weighted averages and, as such, most compliance
monitoring relies on time-integrated sampling that may fail
to capture short-duration, high-level exposures. Sensors
provide an opportunity to go beyond compliance monitoring
to better quantify variability in worker exposures, which
may have important implications for health risk. The time
and cost of conducting compliance monitoring have meant
that the available dataset is often limited by practicality,
resulting in few measures collected and that professional
judgment is heavily relied on to determine when, where, and
on whom samples should be collected and whether workers
are adequately protected from agents (113). Sensors may
provide a cost-effective means to dramatically increase the
amount of quantitative data available to industrial hygienists
and design sampling campaigns that best use available
resources for compliance monitoring.
A summary of possible approaches is shown graphically
in Figure 4. The top row shows data collection strategies and
the bottom row shows how that data could be used by an
industrial hygienist. Sensors can be used to: (i) provide high￾temporal resolution area and personal sampling, (ii) collect
data needed to produce hazard maps, and (iii) distribute
sensor networks that can generate hazard maps at high￾temporal resolution. For area and personal sampling, a time￾series of measurements could be examined to identify high
agent intensity tasks. For hazard map and sensors networks,
the sensor data can be paired with known measurement loca￾tions to produce contour plots of measured agents to iden￾tify areas of concern. Sensor networks can also provide the
industrial hygienist with information about how the agents
vary over time and space, which may help identify processes
leading to high intensities and higher risks for workers. These
approaches are described in more detail in the following
sections.
5.1 Short Duration Sampling and Video
Exposure Monitoring
As described above, traditional sampling approaches often
rely on cumulative measures, which may pose a challenge
to meet method limits of detection for sampling durations
155PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
substantially shorter than an eight-hour shift. As such, it may
not be feasible to evaluate the exposures during a single,
short-duration task. Sensors may be better suited to evaluate
short-duration exposures (Figure 4a). Such information may
be useful for determining when to conduct compliance moni￾toring, evaluating whether some workers generate higher
intensities while doing similar tasks, and rapidly evaluating
the efficacy of an intervention to reduce exposure.
Some researchers have also paired sensor data with a
video of the worker to help visualize tasks that create high
intensities using a method called video exposure monitoring
(114). Software has been developed that links the video and
sensor data by the time stamp to allow both the industrial
hygienist and the worker to view the tasks that resulted in
higher exposures, including one developed by NIOSH (115).
This can be an important training tool for workers to see how
changes to their work practices or techniques can result in
reductions in exposures.
5.2 Personal Exposure Assessment
DRIs have been used for personal monitoring for more
than a decade (116). Low-cost sensors are gaining attention
for personal monitoring for both occupational and environ￾mental applications (Figure 4a). Using low-cost sensors for
personal exposure assessment requires that sensors’ pack￾ages include battery power and data storage capabilities.
These devices have been designed for personal sampling
purposes for PM (117, 118), gas (119, 120), and phys￾ical agents (121). Most sensors are not considered reliable
enough for compliance monitoring but can be useful for eval￾uating exposure variability, prioritizing workers for compli￾ance monitoring, to evaluate how activities and behaviors
impact exposure, and identifying locations of high exposure.
5.3 Hazard Maps
Hazard maps, or depictions of hazard or agent intensity on a
floor plan, provide a visual, easy to understand way to show
risk (122–124). Hazard maps facilitate rapid dissemination
of hazard information between employees, management, and
regulators. The data needed to generate a hazard map can
be produced efficiently using sensors. Typically, a sensor
is moved on a pre-defined grid around a facility to collect
high spatial-resolution data on agent intensity (124, 125)
(Figure 4b). A spatial interpolation method is then used to
predict intensities at unsampled locations so that a surface
can be produced. Hazard maps can be used to identify “hot
spots” of potential exposure and are useful for determining
where interventions can be targeted to reduce exposures.
However, hazard maps can be biased because it takes a period
of time to map the facility, so the map does not truly represent
a single time (122). In the presence of variable exposures,
hazard maps can conflate spatial and temporal variability and
care should be taken when interpreting the data (126).
5.4 Low-Cost Sensor Networks
As sensor technology continues to decrease in price, it
is increasingly feasible to distribute sensors in a network
(Figure 4c) to produce hazard maps with both high temporal
and spatial resolution (127), without the need for staff to
be physically present at each location to collect the data.
Such networks could be useful for identification of the
determinants of exposure (e.g. tasks, processes, and control
measures), understand air quality to avoid fouling of prod￾ucts and machines, and assessment of systemic hazards, such
as dust explosions. Such a network could also function as a
surveillance system to notify workers and health and safety
professionals when user-defined exposure thresholds are
exceeded (128) or to trigger additional sampling (including
other agents or detailed chemical speciation) when these
levels are reached. Networks could also be used as part of the
decision-making process to determine if the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE) is advisable (129). Ultimately,
pairing sensor network estimates of agent intensity with
worker location information (possibly done with indoor posi￾tioning sensors) could be used to estimate worker exposures
for all workers on all days (130). This would represent a huge
increase in quantitative personal exposure data, reduce the
need for workers to carry sampling equipment, and further
maximize resources for compliance monitoring.
6 CONCLUSIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES
FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Despite great improvements in sensor technology, many
analytes will still require filter-, adsorption-, or absorption￾based sampling and laboratory analysis. Comparatively few
analytes can be measured with sensors compared to the wide
range of hazardous agents encountered in modern work￾places. However, the field of sensor technology is continually
growing. Sensors for new agents, and those with higher accu￾racy and lower limits of detection for existing agents, are
rapidly entering the marketplace. Sensors provide exciting
opportunities to better assess exposures for workers and iden￾tify control strategies to reduce those exposures. Further￾more, internet and mobile interfaces are currently increasing
in functionality and adoption, including capabilities for data
collection, analysis, and display. In the near future, it may
also become more common for devices to broadcast data
wirelessly so that industrial hygienists can monitor sensor
readings in near real-time. New techniques with sensor
networks can provide information for building management
of indoor conditions (131) and multi-hazard sensor networks
156SENSORS
can map multiple workplace agents with high temporal and
spatial resolution (127).
Much of the development of sensor technology has
been towards reducing cost and increasing the portability
and wearability of sensors. Among industrial hygiene
professionals, there is desire for smaller, easier-to-use moni￾tors compared to legacy equipment that may require pumps,
sampling media, suspension liquids, or large batteries (2).
Researchers with interest in both occupational and environ￾mental exposures are continuing efforts to determine the
best calibration strategies for these sensors to improve data
accuracy and precision. Efforts will likely also continue to
increase the types of measurements that can be made with
a sensor (e.g. PM speciation, additional gases, biological
hazards, and health sensors). Health sensors, for example,
are becoming more common, especially among elite athletes
and military personnel, and are capable of measuring physi￾ological processes, such as cardiac rhythm, blood chemistry,
activity levels, and lung function, in a non-invasive manner.
Although these types of sensors have not seen substantial
use in industrial hygiene, applications may exist in the future
to better link exposures with subclinical measures of health.

1 THE EMISSION INVENTORY
An emission inventory for an industrial process is a compi￾lation of information from which one can identify emission
sources and estimate the rates (quantity per unit time)
at which pollutants are released to the environment. For
purposes of this chapter, only the emissions that contami￾nate workroom air are considered; emissions to surface or
groundwater, to soil, or to other environmental receptors are
only treated as they may, in turn, result directly in emissions
to the workplace.
An emission inventory may be simple or complex. A
rudimentary inventory may consist of source location, date,
identification of process, a qualitative listing of materials
used, and an index of size (e.g. annual production rate) for
the subject enterprise. Such an inventory, along with emis￾sion factors generated by studies of similar processes, will
permit the making of an estimate of annual emissions. A
comprehensive emission inventory, on the other hand, may
contain sufficient detail to permit quantification of emis￾sions, including temporal variations, for a number of specific
materials from each point of release in a complex industrial
process.
An inventory of emissions allows for the making of esti￾mates of emission rates, the nature and intensity of exposures
to airborne contaminants, and the appropriate dilution venti￾lation flowrates. The level of detail needed and achievable
for the emission inventory depends both on the purposes for
which it is to be used and the data available.

2 ELEMENTS OF THE EMISSION
INVENTORY
The compilation of emission inventories is a well-established
specifically identifiable activity in the field of air pollution
control. Practices and procedures have been highly devel￾oped and descriptions of the technology are available (1–6).
Emission inventory has been practiced in industrial hygiene
for many years but has not been identified as a categorical
work area in this field to the extent that it has been in the
field of air pollution control. Although the types of data used
and the techniques for obtaining them vary somewhat, the
same basic elements appear in emission inventories in both
fields of work.
2.1 Identification of Agents
Anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of hazards
are the four basic steps in the practice of industrial hygiene.
An emission inventory, regardless of whether it is specif￾ically identified as such, is necessary for all four steps
and is particularly important in the first three, anticipation,
recognition, and evaluation. It is clear that if a hazard is to
be controlled, it must first be anticipated and/or recognized;
this recognition, and the identification of an emission,
is a rudimentary emission inventory. Evaluation requires
more than identification. In situations involving release of
chemical agents to the air, evaluation may include obtaining
163PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
additional information such as quantity, character, and
temporal variations of emissions, all of which are part of the
emission inventory. The design and implementation of emis￾sion control require detailed information about the emission
source that goes beyond the level of detail usually required
for an emission inventory. The identification, by means of
an emission inventory, of materials that are released from a
process or operation, however, is a fundamental step in the
recognition of those that represent a potential hazard in the
workplace or the community.
For manufacturing processes, preliminary identification
of potentially hazardous agents can often be based upon
the identification of process raw materials, intermediate
and by-product materials, and the process end products. In
commercial enterprises, the identification of materials that
are handled permits the singling out of those that may repre￾sent potential hazards. For combustion sources, informa￾tion on the composition of fuel and the type of combustion
equipment used permits qualitative identification of pollutant
components.
The evaluation phase of an industrial hygiene or commu￾nity air pollution problem requires, in addition to identifi￾cation of the agents of concern, a number of other kinds of
information that can be obtained in an emission inventory.
Among the most fundamental of these is the identification
and description of the site or location at which the contami￾nant is released to the air.
2.2 Identification of Emission Sites
The most cursory emission inventory identifies the site or
location of an emission source at a particular process, piece
of equipment, or operation. Such location information is
generally useful for indicating the need for more thorough
workplace exposure evaluation. Any emission inventory use
other than agent identification alone requires more specific
emissions location information. For example, in air pollu￾tion control, the identification of specific stacks, vents, and
other points of emission is necessary for diffusion modeling
and for most impact evaluations and emission regulatory
activities. For industrial hygiene purposes, the location of a
specific workplace, process point, and perhaps even a partic￾ular process equipment opening (e.g. a mixer charging port)
or work practice (e.g. the handling of shipping bags after
use) may be needed. Such location information is vital to the
hazard assessment process. It is necessary for identifying the
workers subject to exposure from the particular source and
for identifying alternatives from which to select the means
for control of any hazard caused by the emission. An emis￾sion inventory that identifies both the materials emitted from
a process and the specific locations at which these materials
are released can serve as the first step, and occasionally the
only step necessary, in the evaluation of a hazard and initia￾tion of a control effort.
2.3 Time Factors in Emissions
Time resolution in emission inventories may be yearly,
seasonal, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or even less than
hourly, depending on specific needs and the availability of
data. The assessment of emissions to workplaces that involve
cyclic or intermittent operations may require use of time
intervals of 15 min or less. For short time or intermittent
operations – for example, the taking of materials samples at
process sampling ports – the actual time interval of emission
and the frequency with which the operation occurs should be
recorded in the inventory.
In some cases, the interval of record for the quantity of
material released is relatively long – for example, a monthly
record of solvent use – even though actual release may
be cyclic or may occur over short intervals. In such cases,
the emission inventory record should contain a sufficiently
detailed description of the process or operation to permit
estimation of actual emission intervals and the quantities of
materials released during these intervals.
It is important that the emission inventory record includes
both the date on which the inventory was done and the
calendar interval for which it applies. When a change
in process or operation occurs that materially affects the
composition, quantity, or condition of an emission, the
emission inventory record should be updated to reflect
the change. In the absence of any substantial change, the
inventory should be revalidated at convenient intervals.
When an emission inventory record is updated or reval￾idated, the old record should be retained; a sequential
inventory file over a long period may be invaluable in future
retrospective epidemiological studies.
3 QUANTIFYING EMISSIONS
Emissions can be quantified either by direct measurement,
such as source testing, or by indirect means. Indirect means
includes techniques such as process materials balance or
the determination of an index parameter – for example, a
production rate – that can be related empirically to emissions.
3.1 Source Sampling
Source sampling is ordinarily associated with measurement
of air pollutant emissions. Under some circumstances, the
techniques can be applied to industrial hygiene investiga￾tions as well. The techniques of air pollutant source testing
have been described in detail by Paulus and Thron (3, 7)
and others. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
published stepwise procedures on source sampling for partic￾ulates (8). This chapter contains a number of data recording
164CHARACTERIZING AIR CONTAMINANT EMISSION SOURCES
forms that are useful in sampling not only for particulates but
also for other agents as well.
Source sampling ordinarily consists of withdrawing
a representative sample from a contaminant-bearing gas
stream in a duct or stack. Analysis of the sample yields
data on concentration of the contaminant in the gas stream.
Concentration data, combined with companion data on gas
flow rates in the ducts or stacks, yield values for contaminant
emission rates for gas streams released to the atmosphere.
The critical concern in source sampling is the represen￾tativeness of the sample. Both composition and flow rate of
a contaminated gas stream may vary as the processes and
operations that generate it vary. Thus, representativeness of a
source sample depends very much on the representativeness
of processes and operations at the time of sampling.
As mentioned earlier, the techniques of source sampling
were mostly developed for use in air pollution emission
measurements. They can, in some circumstances, be applied
to in-plant industrial hygiene purposes as well. When a
workplace is served by general dilution ventilation in the
exhaust mode, the techniques of source sampling can be
applied to the exhausted airstreams to determine the rate
at which contaminants are released to the workplace air.
The calculation methods described in Engineering Control
of Airborne Contaminants: History, Philosophy, and
the Development of Primary Approaches on industrial
ventilation can be used to estimate emissions when the
concentrations of contaminant in the supply and exhaust
air and the ventilation rate are known with the system at
equilibrium. The contaminant generation rate is the sum of
the generation rates calculated for all exhaust discharges.
The procedure is most applicable when general dilution
ventilation in the exhaust mode is the sole, and controlling,
ventilation regimen for the workplace, that is, when there
is no mechanical local exhaust ventilation. If local exhaust
ventilation is used in the workplace, its influence as general
dilution ventilation must be taken into account when using
this technique to estimate workplace emissions.
Source sampling techniques may also be used to quantify
emissions from individual points of release in a workplace.
The emissions may be captured using a temporary exhaust
ventilation setup, and the amount of material released may
be determined by sampling from that exhaust stream. Appli￾cation of this technique to a single source or emission point
in a space that contains several sources of the air contami￾nant requires either elimination of the influence of the other
sources or correction for them. A mechanical arrangement
can be provided to supply contaminant-free outside air to the
test source. The exhaust stream from the test source will then
contain only contaminant from that source and will be unbi￾ased by contaminant from other sources.
Alternatively, monitoring of the concentration of contam￾inant in room air that supplies the source test exhaust system
permits correction for other sources; emissions from the test
source can be determined by the difference in contaminant
concentration in supply and exhaust air of the test system.
3.2 Materials Balance
In some cases, knowledge of processes and operations
permits determination of the amount of material released
to the air of a workplace without emission measurements.
If it is known that a gas or vapor is generated by chemical
reaction or otherwise and is released to workplace air in
proportion to the use of a raw material or a production
rate, that index of generation can be used to determine the
release rate. Examples include the generation of products
of combustion by unvented open flames, as is the case with
direct fired unit heaters. Here, fuel composition and use
rate are indices of contaminant emissions. Uses of volatile
solvents in which the solvents do not become part of a
product, but evaporate completely into the workplace air,
are common in industry. Solvent use rate, in such cases, is
also an emission rate. When exhaust ventilation is applied to
some operations in a workplace and not to others, distinction
must be made between the portion of the material captured
by exhaust ventilation and the portion released in the occu￾pied workplace; only the portion that is released directly to
the workplace air is used to estimate workplace exposures.
When complete evaporation of a volatile material does
not take place, some index other than total use is needed
for quantifying emissions. In the simple case, when the
amount used and the amount remaining can be determined,
the amount released as vapor can be obtained by difference.
When this is not possible, more sophisticated means such
as exhaust air sampling must be employed. With complete
evaporation of a mixture of volatile materials, the quantity
of each component that vaporizes is merely the quantity of
that material in the mixture. Partial evaporation of a mixture,
however, does not necessarily yield vapor quantity of each
component in proportion to the quantity of that component
in the liquid mixture.
Applications of materials balance concepts for the deter￾mination of emissions require engineering analysis on a
case-by-case basis. Procedures and equations for estimating
emission rates from multiple indoor sources have been
reported (9–11).
3.3 Emission Factors
The need exists for emissions estimates for large numbers
of sources in community air pollution studies. The imprac￾ticability of source-by-source emissions tests has led to the
development of emission factors. An emission factor is a
pollutant emission rate for a particular type of emission
source expressed as a quantity of pollutant released per unit
of activity of that type source. The unit of activity chosen in
each case is one that can be determined and can be related
165PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
quantitatively to emissions; it may be by “ton of product,”
“million Btu of heat produced,” “mile of vehicle travel,” or
other such index units. Emission factors represent typical
emissions from a class of sources and ordinarily cannot
be applied with confidence to individual sources. In the
absence of other information, however, emission factors for
a particular source type can give useful insights into the
character and general levels of emissions from individual
sources of that type.
The most reliable emission factors are those based on a
combination of emission measurements, process data, and
engineering analysis for a large number of sources. Those
that do not have a theoretical basis and are derived from only
one type of data, or from data from only a few sources, should
be used with caution. In some cases, sufficient knowledge or
information is available to permit development of empirical
or analytic relationships between emission rate and some
process parameter such as material composition or stream
temperature. Such factors are generally the most reliable
of all and can even be applied to individual sources with
reasonable confidence.
Air pollutant emission factors for a large number of source
types have been tabulated and reported by the EPA’s Office
of Air and Waste Management (12). Process descriptions
and emission control practices, along with typical collec￾tion performance for various types of control, are presented
for most of the source types covered. Table 1 lists major
source types for which emission factors appear in the current
publication. In a separate document, the EPA has published
emission factors for arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, cadmium,
manganese, mercury, nickel, and vanadium for processes
involving these materials (13).
Emission factors in the EPA tabulation generally apply
to identifiable point sources in processes or operations from
which pollutants are released to the atmosphere through
vents or stacks. As such, they have limited applicability to
in-plant industrial hygiene assessments. They do, however,
identify some of the air contaminants that are generated
by these processes; the same contaminants may represent
potential in-plant exposures.
3.4 Fugitive Sources
Contaminant emissions from point sources such as tank vents
or transfer points, processes and operations, or manufac￾turing equipment that clearly involve release of a process
material – for example, release of volatile components in
cementing or painting operations – are ordinarily capable
of identification and quantification. There are other types of
fugitive emission sources not so easily accommodated and
sometimes neglected in emission inventories. Such sources,
like poorly functioning exhaust hoods, may be intermit￾tent, temporary, or unpredictable; many are unrecognized

or ignored in emission inventories. Fugitive sources and
the generation of secondary pollutants deserve attention in
IH emission inventories, however, all of them may not be
capable of quantification or prediction.
Fugitive sources that are of consequence primarily in the
field of air pollution, and for which emission factors have
been developed, include unpaved roads, aggregate handling
and storage piles, heavy construction operations, and paved
roads (12). Other sources that are consequential from the
standpoints of both air pollution and industrial hygiene
include the following:
1. LEV hoods and systems that do not completely
control the contaminant
2. Structural and industrial process fires
3. Off-gassing from recently manufactured products
4. Materials spills (accidents, equipment failure, or
malfunction)
5. Sample collection and analysis
6. Process leaks (flanges and piping, valves, packing
glands, conveyors, pumps, compressors, tanks, bins,
etc.)
7. Relief valves and control device bypasses
168CHARACTERIZING AIR CONTAMINANT EMISSION SOURCES
8. Maintenance and housekeeping activities (tank and
vessel cleaning, filter cleaning, replacing piping,
pumps, sweeping, etc.)
9. Emissions from waste streams and reemissions of
collected materials
10. Secondary reactions (nonproduct process reactions,
extraprocess reactions)
Virtually all exhaust hoods have fugitive emissions that
must be taken into account during the emission inventory
process. Sometimes, these emissions are trivial, but in other
cases, they can be significant. See, for example, the case
study in Section 5.4.
Structural fires are intermittent phenomena predictable
only in the aggregate and not as individual events; they are
considered to be emission sources primarily in the air pollu￾tion sense. An industrial hygiene consequence of urban fires,
however, is the exposure to toxic materials of firefighters and
others who may be involved in rescue or control activities. A
number of toxic atmospheric contaminants are generated by
structural fires; these tend to vary from one fire to another. Of
concern in all structural fires, however, is emission of carbon
monoxide. Burgess et al. (14) have described exposures of
emergency personnel to carbon monoxide emissions in real
fire situations; the maximum sustained air concentrations of
carbon monoxide to which these persons were exposed in
the events in which it was measured was about 2%. Mate￾rials balance using pyrolysis and oxidation processes offer
one means of estimating the quantities of pollutants that may
be generated in any particular case.
Estimates of emissions from industrial fires require
individual analysis. The quantities and characteristics of
combustion products depend on the nature of the materials
that burn or are present in the fire and on the circumstances of
combustion (e.g. whether open or confined). Again, consid￾eration of pyrolysis and oxidation phenomena may permit
estimation of the nature and quantities of air contaminants
generated by any particular event. The likelihood and conse￾quences of accidental fires is an appropriate consideration in
industrial emission inventories.
Material spills in manufacturing, transporting, and uses of
industrial materials are not infrequent occurrences. Studies
of processes and operations with specific attention to spills
can reveal the frequencies and magnitudes of spills if they
are usual occurrences (15). Such spills can then become
part of an emissions inventory. When spills are not a usual
occurrence, an emission inventory can do little more than
trigger consideration of the possibilities and consequences
of such events. Guidance for protection of workers when a
spill of a hazardous substance occurs, developed as a joint
project of the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, has been published (16).
Process leaks are sometimes of major consequence from
the standpoint of industrial hygiene. Control of process leaks,
for example, has been a major factor in achieving acceptable
working conditions in vinyl chloride monomer and polymer￾ization plants. Process leaks can be identified by inspection
or instrumental methods; timely repair may obviate quan￾tifying for an emission inventory. Should quantification be
necessary, use the techniques of source testing or materials
balance.
Predicting and quantifying emissions of particulate mate￾rial from industrial sources is generally more difficult and
more technically demanding than is assessment of emissions
of gases and vapors. Quantifying emissions of fugitive dusts
is described in Refs (17–24) and (6).
4 EMISSION ESTIMATES FROM PLANT
AND COMPANY RECORDS
AND REPORTS
In the absence of in-plant measurements of emissions, esti￾mates derived from secondary sources of information can be
used for inventory purposes. In some cases, data are available
from similar processes and plants elsewhere, and estimates
by analogy may prove to be sufficient for a given purpose.
In other cases, unique features of a process or operation
may make estimates by analogy inappropriate. An alternative
to measurement data or analogy makes use of records and
reports whose basic purposes were other than for industrial
hygiene, but whose content may be extracted, combined,
or otherwise manipulated into usable estimate of emissions
and potential exposure. Vital information may be recorded
in a variety of business documents, including engineering,
accounting, production, quality control, personnel, and
governmental records. Although these records represent a
rich source of information for emission inventory purposes,
they can serve other purposes in the practice of industrial
hygiene and occupational health research as well. Some
of these purposes are mentioned from time to time in the
following discussions of specific types of records.
4.1 Research and Development Records
Industrial research and development units often issue a
variety of reports to producing units as aids in bringing
a new product on stream, to ensure a required level of
uniformity in a given item produced by different plants, or
to make changes or improvements in operating equipment,
materials, or techniques. Valuable insight with respect to
materials and work practices employed in the past may be
gleaned from several of these records. Among such records
are the following:
169PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
• Product specification. Final product and intermediate
component data included in a product specification
often give dimensions, weight, materials of construc￾tion, processing aids, processing conditions, tools and
fabricating equipment, and special notes.
• Standard operating procedure. This record may exist
under a variety of names: standard operating proce￾dure (SOP), Standard Practice, Uniform Methods,
and (Company Name) Manual of Operations appear
among the myriad of titles. Many, however, share
fairly specific operational instructions, usually in a
step-by-step approach by processing sequence. Vital
data from this record can include the following:
– Fabrication equipment
– Authorized materials of construction
– Acceptable processing aids
– Processing conditions
– Alternate materials for cyclic operations (e.g.
summer versus winter stocks)
– Change notices affecting materials or techniques
– Instructions regarding protective equipment
• Formulations and raw materials. Detailed data
concerning the qualitative aspects of potential expo￾sures can be derived from the study of information
describing the raw materials employed in a process.
– Raw material specifications may contain composi￾tion data, restrictions on contaminants, and accep￾tance testing schedules
– A listing of authorized vendors can offer clues to
potential contaminants based on knowledge of a
vendor’s source of supply or processing methods
– Formulation records often contain information on
the composition of mixtures as well as the methods,
equipment, quantity, and conditions of processing
4.2 Analytical Laboratory Records
Quality control considerations often dictate that incoming
raw materials be monitored for selected chemical and phys￾ical properties, that supplies from prospective vendors be
subjected to acceptance testing, and that production quality
be assayed by sampling at intermediate stages of the process.
A single journal entry of analytical results may include
a wealth of intelligence applicable to an emissions inven￾tory. Analytical laboratory records may include some of the
following:
• Raw material test results. Recorded in either the
analyst’s journal or on prepared forms will be entries
such as follows:
– Analytical results vis-à-vis specifications
– Date of analysis, and perhaps date of receipt
– Quantity of the shipment
– Vendor
– Method of analysis
– Analyst
• Authorized vendors. Quality control laboratories
often maintain vendor-supplied information regarding
purchased materials. Material safety data sheets,
product specifications, production methods, and
quality control statements all offer bits of useful data.
4.3 Process and Production Records
Records generated by production units relate to such matters
as scheduling, quality control, cost control, and to a lesser
extent, training exercises. Depending on the product and
process, production-type records can be of considerable
value in generating an emissions inventory.
• Flowcharts. A detailed diagram of a process is partic￾ularly useful in identifying points and potential for the
release of air contaminants.
• Operating conditions. Time, temperature, and pressure
data are useful in assessing possible release of reaction
products, by-products, degradation products, and unre￾acted raw materials.
• Scheduling. Shift, cyclic, and seasonal variations may
influence the emissions of contaminants. Such vari￾ations can often be ascertained through production
scheduling records. Included under this heading are
records of batch versus continuous production modes.
Gantt chart records offer a particularly attractive
systematic source of scheduled activities that can be
both precise and detailed.
4.4 Plant Engineering Records
Virtually all industrial organizations include an engineering
component that is responsible for the physical plant and
supporting facilities. This responsibility has been known to
result in a plant archive that is particularly useful in emissions
inventory activity and in research that requires reconstruction
of past environmental conditions.
• Plant layout. The plant floor plan, coupled with
elevation drawings, affords a visualization of the
process, materials flow, occupied areas, and possibly
insights relating to contaminant generation and control.
Furthermore, many engineering drawings are cross￾referenced to other drawings of equipment, emissions
control features, and adjacent work areas. Useful
characteristics of plant engineering files include the
following:
170CHARACTERIZING AIR CONTAMINANT EMISSION SOURCES
– Processing equipment type, extent, and location on
layouts.
– Department floor space showing geographic bound￾aries and physical barriers.
– Engineering controls, especially industrial ventila￾tion systems, are depicted in mechanical equipment
layouts, which normally show the location, site,
type, and rating of air-moving equipment, as well
as a reference to the detailed drawings covering the
system.
– Dates of change or modification are often included
in drawings, either by direct entry or by reference to
a new set of plates.
• Equipment specifications. Files on processing equip￾ment installed by or under the supervision of plant engi￾neers often include specifications that supply clues to
potential problems such as process emissions, sound
power rating and directivity data, or emission control
features incorporated in the equipment.
• Project records. Each major project of construction,
modification, or installation normally proceeds as
an integral project with an individual(s) assigned as
coordinator. Usually, this project officer accumulates
records that include data on the following:
– Equipment specifications
– Performance checks and acceptance test results
– Prime contractor and subcontractors
• Material balance. A detailed accounting of materials,
products, and side streams, either measured or theoret￾ical, can serve as a basis for a quantitative estimate of
emissions.
4.5 Industrial Engineering Records
The practice of industrial engineering includes the analysis
of work procedures to improve either work conditions or
productivity or both. Typical industrial engineering records
contain information on work methods and standards that are
useful for compiling emission inventories and for estimating
past emissions and exposures that may have resulted from
them. Such records often include the following:
• Job descriptions.
– Description numbers, department listings, and simple
descriptive job titles can provide the link between the
tasks performed and the work history recorded in an
individual’s personnel file.
– Job location within a plant, thus, the potential
for various exposures may be ascertained from
the geographic area, processing equipment, or
department listing contained in a job description.
– The listing in a job description of tools, equipment,
and processing aids can help establish the nature of
emissions and characteristics of potential exposures
(e.g. inhalation, skin absorption).
– Task evaluations often include judgments concerning
such health-related items as work conditions,
safety requirements, hazards, skills, effort, and
responsibility.
• Time and motion studies. Task breakdowns are useful to
establish contact with materials of interest, and the frac￾tion of time spent on certain tasks coupled with cycle
time can afford an estimate of the extent of exposure.
• Process analysis. Evaluations of an entire process focus
on tasks performed by all the members of a crew
rather than those of individual workers. Particularly
useful in process analysis reports are listings of frac￾tions of a workday spent at different workstations by
members of the operating crew, including break time
and sequencing of tasks.
4.6 Accounting Records
Accounting records cover virtually all phases of an opera￾tion for both outside reporting and internal control purposes.
Major areas of interest for emission inventory purposes
include records on incoming materials, internal use of these
raw materials, and plant production factors (25).
• Purchasing. Raw materials for both production and
support operations, as well as processing equipment, are
ordinarily obtained from outside the company, resulting
in some acquisition record. Even when raw materials
are drawn from captive sources, records of resource
depletion may be available.
– Listings of materials, quantities, and supplier may be
available through the purchasing ledger, often found
in the accounts payable portion.
– Capital equipment is normally amortized by a recog￾nized accounting procedure, the evaluation of which
can be employed to determine the date of acquisition.
Alternatively, many organizations maintain a prop￾erty book that contains similar information.
• In-plant issues of materials.
– Data on raw materials consumption often can be
developed through accumulation of issues to depart￾ments, cost centers, or plants, or through collected
expense or work-in-process accounts.
– Material variance accounts may serve as surrogates
for material balance data if the latter are unavailable.
The absolute variance value between actual and stan￾dard material usages may be of marginal value, but
changes in this quantity can be important in estab￾lishing trends.
171PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
– Nonproduction supplies are often issued to main￾tenance and other support departments through a
“general store” account, with the receipt listing the
item and quantities issued.
• Inventory. Inventory control may be maintained through
stock records that list material, vendor, date, and quan￾tity received, date and quantity of issue, department to
which issued, and location and quantity on hand.
• Production. Finished goods and work-in-process
production accounts may include an identification
of the work schedule, days operated, and average
production level.
4.7 Personnel Records
Personnel records per se can provide insights into the nature
and locations of contaminant releases applicable to emis￾sion inventories. In addition, they are vital to other indus￾trial hygiene and occupational health research activities. In
any study of causal association between conditions of work
and health experience, the work experience of each indi￾vidual is an integral component. Thus, accurate and reli￾able personnel-type records are vital. Organizational units
that normally can develop, or assist in developing, useful
records include the personnel, payroll, industrial relations,
safety, and medical departments. The IH might check records
related to personnel, industrial relations, safety, medical,
insurance surveys, and union activities.
4.8 Government-Mandated Records
and Reports
During the past five decades OSHA, EPA, and state agencies
have promulgated numerous regulations intended to ensure
that employees, customers, the general public, and govern￾ment agencies would have the necessary information with
which to evaluate potential exposures resulting from chem￾ical releases to the workplace and ambient environments. The
resultant records and reports can provide valuable informa￾tion to compiling the emission inventory, and will sometimes
afford insights into potential exposure conditions. Copies of
past reports of this type are likely to be filed in the plant
or corporate office(s) that deal(s) with environmental affairs
and/or that deals with government regulatory agencies.
Some government requirements and activities that might
have insights into potential exposure conditions and emission
sources include the following:
• OSHA Hazard Communication Rules
• OSHA Access to Medical (and Exposure) Records
• OSHA Standards Governing Specific Chemicals
• The Toxic Substances Control Act
• SARA Title III Rules
• The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
• Other Governmental Records and Reports (e.g. nation￾wide statistics and industrywide data)
4.9 Record Locations
Within many corporate industrial organizations, records of
major additions or changes, as well as events affecting
the entire operating units, are likely to be available at a
central location, such as the division or corporate offices.
Examples of these types of records are overall production
levels, descriptions of uniform practices, and product speci￾fications. More specific records, or those dealing with minor
plant alterations, are ordinarily available only at the local
plant level. Historical records may be at a central plant
storage facility. At the plant level, project officers often
retain personal copies of papers related to their projects; if a
plant record has been discarded, such personal records may
provide valuable historical data.
4.10 Quality of Secondary Data and Records
Information derivable from secondary sources of data is
limited by the nature and detail of the record content.
In general, the more distant the time of interest, the less
complete will be the record, and the lower will be the
confidence in its accuracy. When data are sparse and only
plantwide data are available, estimated measures such as
gallons per cubic foot of plant building volume per month,
or pounds used per employee per day, may be the limit of
detail for emission estimates, but this may serve for plant￾to-plant contrasts. More detailed data such as quantities
of materials used in specific departments and descriptions
of controls for specific work areas permit more detailed
estimates. Material generation rates coupled with general
area ventilation rates may enable one to estimate an area
average concentration. Such data may be particularly useful
for within-plant contrasts or for plant-to-plant studies of
particular areas or processes.
Records pertaining to the detailed nature of tasks, such
as standard operating procedures or job descriptions, make
possible a ranking of jobs – thus, a ranking of increments
of time in individuals’ work histories – by potential for
exposure to any particular agent or combination of agents of
interest. In this fashion, personnel with increments of time in
their work histories having similar exposures, for example,
homogeneous exposure groups (HEGs) (26), can be grouped
for comparison of health experience with other workers who
share different common exposure profiles, that is, who have
histories of work in other HEGs.
As an example of the use of secondary information, an
illustration of the type of emissions output that has been

accomplished for retrospective research purposes through
the use of such sources of information follows.
In Figure 1, the SOP is the pivotal document that iden￾tifies both tasks and materials for a step in manufacturing.
A formulation record, or series of records, for each material
used in that particular manufacturing step identifies each
raw material constituent of each material. Examination of
the raw material specification for each constituent then
permits identification of agents (e.g. coal tar naphtha) that
may be emitted in the workplace, often with additional
compositional detail (e.g. aromatic content or benzene
content). Because formulations, constituents, and specifi￾cations change from time to time, the listing of potential
emissions thus identified must show inclusive dates on an
agent-by-agent basis.
The tasks portion of the SOP includes a job description,
which in turn has a specific job code. The job code is listed
in the personnel record of each person who has held that
particular job. Examination of the personnel records of
the plant’s current and past workers identifies complete
work history, including dates and duration of each job code
assignment for each individual who has held the specific job
of interest.
In this way, the potential for contact with a particular
chemical agent by an identified individual, including dates
and duration of the contact, can be developed, even to events
that occurred in the distant past.
4.11 Records Retention
Emissions records, or records from which emissions esti￾mates can be made, should be retained. A single specific
age at which a record no longer has value cannot be stated.
For research purposes, exposure records have value equal
to, or greater than, that of medical examination records.
Because long latent periods are associated with health effects
of some agents, early exposure records may be invaluable
in the search for causal associations. Exposure records, or
emission records, that identify contact with agents or from
which exposure estimates can be made, should be retained
long enough to be used in studies of the mortality experiences
of the worker populations to which they apply.
The need for long-term retention of environmental
records is recognized in the record-keeping provisions of the
OSHA regulation of toxic and hazardous substances (27).
Time periods for which employee exposure records must
be retained vary with the substance being regulated. For
example, records of exposures to asbestos must be retained
for at least 20 years, those for vinyl chloride must be retained
for not less than 30 years, and those for coke oven emissions
must be retained for the duration of employment plus 20
years, or for 40 years, whichever is longer. Emission data
are pertinent to these records. Such retention is appropriate
for all records of emissions of air pollutants or of chemical
agents released in places of work.
5 USE OF THE EMISSION INVENTORY
Emission inventories are fundamental to the identification,
evaluation, and control of industrial hygiene hazards associ￾ated with airborne chemical contaminants. Not all uses for
inventory information can be examined here, but a few are
presented, as well as a case study that demonstrates its use.
5.1 Regulatory Requirements
Various governmental regulatory programs in occupa￾tional safety and health, air pollution, and toxic substances
control have reporting requirements that involve emission
inventory information. Regulations regarding the nature
and content of these reports, the agents covered, and the
types of establishment with reporting obligations change
periodically. Persons responsible for industrial or commer￾cial enterprises that involve emissions to community air, or
the handling or production of agents that may be covered in
occupational health or toxic substances regulatory programs
should keep abreast of the specific requirements imposed by
state and federal regulations. Emission inventory programs
can then be so designed and operated that the emissions data
necessary to satisfy reporting requirements are obtained.
5.2 Determination of Emission Rates
Knowing the quantities of a chemical material used in a
process can lead to an estimate of the amounts emitted into
173PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
the work environment. Dilution ventilation rates, to be cost￾effective, must be based on the amount of material to be
diluted. Dilution ventilation and the determination of appro￾priate dilution ventilation rates are covered in Engineering
Control of Airborne Contaminants: History, Philosophy,
and the Development of Primary Approaches.
5.3 Workplace Exposure Estimates
Qualitative estimates of the potential for emissions and
consequent exposures of workers can be made when agents
have been identified and conditions of their use are known.
Even the most rudimentary emission inventory – the identifi￾cation of agent, process, and location of use – permits a useful
kind of exposure potential assessment. An operating program
in which the industrial hygiene department of a large research
facility systematically obtains descriptions of all uses of the
many hundreds of chemical agents available at the facility
has been described (28). The system includes a hazard rating
for each agent based on its toxicity, flammability, reactivity,
and special properties such as may be found in the agent’s
material safety data sheet. Use information does not identify
emissions per se, but retrieval of use information for a partic￾ular agent permits rapid subjective assessment of its emis￾sions potential throughout the facility. Quantitative informa￾tion on emissions, either measured, calculated, or estimated,
can be combined with data on workplace ventilation to esti￾mate workroom concentrations of an agent. Such estimates
may occasionally be of use in validating sampling data, but
are more likely to have value in such applications as assessing
growth or decay of concentrations in nonequilibrium
situations, in predicting the consequences of new processes
or changes in operations, or in estimating retrospectively the
levels of a contaminant to which particular groups of workers
may have been exposed. The latter use is of particular interest
in reconstructing emergency or accident episodes, or in
retrospective epidemiological studies of worker populations.
5.4 Case Study: Sample Calculations
Demonstrating the Use of an Emission
Inventory and Characterization
An IH has been informed about a planned mild steel welding
operation in a confined space at the plant. The IH is asked
to assist in developing a suitable emission and exposure
control plan.
Data and Information gathered by the IH included an
emission inventory, drawings of the confined space, and a full
description of the work practices to be used. These sources
of information are summarized below:
• The operation is to employ two welders (plus a helper)
in a confined underground space, as shown in Figure 2,

with appropriate safety measures in place (e.g. observer
outside, communications established).
• Primary emission and exposure controls include both
local exhaust and dilution ventilation; management
desires both to be employed. (See Engineering Control
of Airborne Contaminants: History, Philosophy, and
the Development of Primary Approaches and Ref.
(6) for more information on industrial ventilation.)
• An entry hatch, 2 ft × 2 ft, is located on top of the
confined space where air can enter and an 8 in. exhaust
duct will be located. Each welder will be provided with
a portable exhaust hood attached to the exhaust flex
ductwork.
• The operation is located near sea level and at room
air temperature, so ventilation design can assume stan￾dard conditions, STP, with d=1. (See Engineering
Control of Airborne Contaminants: History, Philos￾ophy, and the Development of Primary Approaches
and Ref. (6) for more information on design and stan￾dard conditions.)
• Dilution air can originate from a clean, pollution-free
location.
• Exhaust air volume flowrates can be chosen to provide
sufficient makeup air to the space to also serve as
sufficient dilution air for welding operation fugitive
emissions.
The emission inventory includes the following
information:
• There will be two major emission sources (two
welders).
• The surface to be welded is clean, uncoated, and
uncontaminated.
174CHARACTERIZING AIR CONTAMINANT EMISSION SOURCES
• The major air contaminants emitted during welding are
ozone and iron fume.
• Adequate control of the iron fume will also provide
control of ozone.
• An emission factor for total fume, R =0.1 g min−1 of
total iron fume per welder (during the actual arc), has
been derived from EPA’s AP 42 publication (12) for the
type of welding to be performed.
• Each welder actually welds (“strikes an arc”) about 20%
of the time (ratio of time welding=0.20).
• The efficiency of capture for the welding exhaust hoods
is at least 0.90 (90%) by prior testing. Employees have
been trained to use the hoods correctly and are experi￾enced in their use. (This means that up to 10% of fume
generated during welding must be diluted to an accept￾able exposure concentration by the general makeup air
that will replace air exhausted by the hoods. The exhaust
air volume flow rate will be selected to ensure sufficient
dilution air is provided to control fugitive emissions for
the worst-case scenario of 10% fugitive emissions.)
• Air mixing factor, Kmix =1.0 (free-standing air-mixing
fans in the space will be used to ensure complete turbu￾lent air mixing, if necessary.)
• The IH chooses an acceptable exposure concentration
of total fume, Ca =0.3 mg m−3 (TWA, BZ exposure).
Source and justification: Ca =2 × the EPA NAAQS
PM-10 standard for 24 h and/or 10% of the ACGIH
recommendation for “NEC” respirable particles.
• Dimensions of the confined space: H =14 ft, W =16 ft,
L =18 ft.
• Main exhaust duct diameter=8 in. (ductwork through
the entry hatch).
• The following calculations were performed by the IH
and forwarded to the engineering group for their use in
designing the system and for procuring equipment:
Estimation of the dilution ventilation required if 10% of
welding fume become fugitive emissions (worst case):
Qd = [R × Kmix × (1 − capture efficiency)
× (time ratio) × 2 welders]∕Ca
= [0.1 g min−1∕welder × 1000 mg g−1
× 0.10 × 0.2 × 2 welders](Kmix)∕0.3 mg m−3
= 13.3 m3 min−1 = 470 ft3 min−1
(Note∶ 1 m3 min−1 = 35.3 ft3 min−1)
• Exhaust volume flow rate at each hood:
– Exhaust volume=supply volume=470/2=235 ft3
min per exhaust hood, well within the design and
operational requirements of the proposed exhaust
hoods. (See Engineering Control of Airborne
Contaminants: History, Philosophy, and the
Development of Primary Approaches and Ref. (6)
for more information on hood design and selection
for specific processes like welding.)
• Volume of the confined space:
Volume = L × W × H = 18 × 16 × 14 = 4032 ft3
• Number of air exchanges in the confined space per hour:
N = Q × 60∕volume = 470 × 60∕4032 = 7 ac h−1
• Area of the exhaust duct:
Aduct = πD2∕4 = 0.3491 ft2
• Velocity of air in the exhaust duct:
V8in.duct = Q∕A = 470∕0.3491 = 1350 fpm
• Open area of the entrance hatch:
Ahatch open space = 2 ft × 2 ft − area of duct
= 4.0 ft2 − 0.3491 ft2 = 3.65 ft2
• Velocity of air into the confined space through the entry
hatch:
Vhatch opening = Q∕A = 470∕3.65 = 130 fpm
• All design parameters appear feasible and within
normal design criteria.

CONTAMINANTS: HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY,
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIMARY
APPROACHES
D. Jeff Burton, PE, CIH (VS) and William A. Burgess, CIH
1 INTRODUCTION
There are many approaches available for the control of air
contaminant emissions and worker exposures. These include
administrative and preventive controls (education, training,
risk assessment, work practices, worker rotation, and job
timing), personal protective controls (respirators, protective
clothing, personal hygiene, and immunization), and engi￾neering controls, the topic of this chapter and Industrial
Ventilation.
Although attention is given in this chapter to the control of
chemical airborne contaminants, many of the control princi￾ples are also applicable to biological and physical hazards.
Brief historical case studies are used to illustrate applica￾tions of engineering control techniques and approaches. The
target for control may be a hand tool, a piece of equipment,
an operation, an integrated manufacturing process such as
electroplating line, or a complete manufacturing facility in a
dedicated building such as a foundry.
One model of the three critical zones of (I) contami￾nant generation, (II) release, emission, and dispersion, and
(III) employee exposure is shown in Figure 1. Ideally, the
goal is to engineer and operate the process or operation to
eliminate air contaminant generation and emissions (e.g.
using processes that have no generation or emissions). If

it is not possible to achieve this goal and a contaminant is
emitted, the second defense is to prevent its dispersal in the
workplace (e.g. using barriers, enclosures, and local exhaust
ventilation). Finally, if these approaches are not feasible and
emissions at the operation can result in worker exposure,
control of the contaminated air is required (e.g. by dilution
of the air contaminant to some safe, acceptable exposure
concentration).
While this chapter covers the process and equipment
design and materials selection, Industrial Ventilation covers
the widely used engineering control topic industrial ventila￾tion and Characterizing Air Contaminant Emission Sources
covers techniques for characterizing emissions that cannot be
controlled at the source.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) considers engineering controls as any modifica￾tion of plant, equipment, processes, or materials to reduce
employees’ exposure to toxic materials and harmful phys￾ical agents. As noted in Table 1, industrial hygiene authors
have used a variety of terms to classify the various engi￾neering control approaches (1–4). These are usually used
in appropriate combinations. For example, to control a
welding operation, the industrial hygienist (IH) may employ
local exhaust ventilation, good work practices, and dilution
ventilation for fugitive emissions (5).

2 ENGINEERING CONTROL TYPES
The most widely used engineering control approaches
include process change, substitution, elimination, isolation,
enclosure and ventilation, both general and localized. In a
technological sense, an appropriate combination of these
approaches can usually be brought to bear on any industrial
hygiene control problem to achieve satisfactory quality of
the work environment. A thorough analysis of the control
problem must be made in order to ensure that cost-effective
choices are made from among these methods. Controls must
be compatible with the technical process, acceptable to the
workers in terms of day-to-day operation, and be accom￾plished with optimal balance of installation and operating
costs.
With the tendency for acceptable occupational exposure
limits (OEL) to become increasingly more stringent, the
duties of the IH must also include an ongoing analysis of
installed control measures. Apart from problems associated
with operation and maintenance of these provisions, the
concept of the control provision itself might become outdated
by changes in processes or regulations. The IH then must
be able to develop and suggest effective control methods
and must have the capability to continue to evaluate the
effectiveness of these methods regularly.
2.1 Substitution and Elimination
Substitution frequently offers the most cost-effective solu￾tion to an industrial hygiene problem. There is a tendency
to choose correction rather than elimination. For example,
the first inclination for some in considering a vapor exposure
problem in a degreasing operation is to provide or increase
ventilation rather than substitute a solvent that has a lower
degree of hazard associated with its use. In its broadest
sense, substitution includes replacing hazardous substances,
changing from one type of process equipment to another, or
in some cases even changing the process itself.
Some examples of substituting materials of lower toxi￾city are classics in the history of emission and exposure
control. Most IHs are familiar with the substitution of red
phosphorus for white in the manufacture of matches, for
example. Although this was done primarily in reaction to a
tax law, the result was a markedly reduced potential hazard.
The sequence of substitutions of degreasing solvents is,
however, illustrative of a problem associated with substitu￾tion. Industry moved from petroleum naphtha to carbon tetra￾chloride to chlorinated hydrocarbons to fluorinated hydro￾carbons. Each of these substitutions alleviated a problem
but resulted in new problems. When using substitution as a
control method, one hazard can be replaced by another if the
substitution is not carefully considered.
Many industrial processes provide only limited oppor￾tunities to substitute less hazardous materials. However, it
might be possible to substitute, or at least modify, process
equipment. This approach is almost always used with phys￾ical hazards, for example, substituting safety glass for regular
glass in enclosures, replacing unguarded equipment with
properly guarded machines, and replacing safety gloves or
aprons with garments made of materials more impervious to
chemicals being handled. It can be every bit as effective with
chemical exposures and chronic IH hazards.
178ENGINEERING CONTROL OF AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS
In general, a change in any process from a batch to a
continuous type of operation carries with it an inherent reduc￾tion in potential hazard. This is true primarily because the
frequency and duration of potential contact of workers with
the process materials are reduced when the overall process
approach becomes one of the continuous operations. The
substitution of processes can be applied on a fundamental
basis. For example, substitution of airless spray for conven￾tional spray equipment can reduce the exposure of a painter
to solvent vapors. Substitution of a paint-dipping operation
for the paint-spray operation can reduce the potential hazard
even further. In any of such cases, the automation of the
process can further reduce the potential hazard.
2.2 Isolation and Enclosure
The principle of isolation is frequently envisioned as
being limited to installation of a physical barrier between
a hazardous operation and the workers. Fundamentally,
however, this isolation can be provided without a physical
barrier by appropriate use of distance and time. Perhaps the
most common example of isolation as a control measure is
associated with storage and use of flammable solvents. Large
tank farms with dikes around tanks, underground storage
of some solvents, detached solvent sheds, and fireproof
solvent-storage rooms within buildings all are commonplace
in industry. Although the primary reason for the isolation of
solvents is the risk of fire and explosion, the principle is no
less valid as an engineering control of employee exposures.
Typically, application of the principle of isolation maxi￾mizes the benefits of other engineering controls such as local
exhaust ventilation. For example, the charging of mixers is
the most significant operation in many processes that use
formulated ingredients. When one of the ingredients in the
formulation is relatively high in toxicity, it is worthwhile
to isolate the mixing operation, that is, construct a separate
mixing room, thereby confining the airborne contaminants
potentially generated by the operation to a small area rather
than having them influence a larger portion of the plant.
Using isolation also makes the application of industrial
ventilation more cost-effective. (Note: Industrial Ventilation
covers the important engineering control topic of industrial
ventilation.)
2.3 Scope and Other Issues
Strategies used to implement engineering controls depend on
the plant, process, and operation. The control problem may
involve a single piece of equipment, a process, or an entire
integrated manufacturing plant. In a simple situation faced
by IHs, a shop repairing electric motors may, for example,
consider a change in solvents in a parts cleaner. The number
of persons participating in the control strategy review is
small, the decision will be made in a short time, and it will
probably rely heavily on vendor information.
A far more complex situation, as another example,
involves the scale-up of a chemical process, say, to manu￾facture a photographic dye. The research to develop the
new molecule and synthesize a small quantity for initial
tests is completed by a research chemist at a laboratory
bench. At this stage, little is known about the chemical or
its toxicity, however, since gram quantities are handled in
a well-controlled laboratory hood, the risk is negligible.
The next step involves a scale-up of the operation in a pilot
plant facility designed to manufacture kilogram quanti￾ties of the material for testing purposes. This testing will
provide limited data on the physical properties of the new
chemical, its product potential, and toxicity data. If the
results are encouraging, production scale-up is considered.
A premanufacturing notification may be submitted to the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or to other
air pollution control authorities prior to production. These
submissions, which typically require a description of air
contaminant control technology and an estimation of worker
exposure, may involve a comprehensive review of the
operation, as described in Table 2. Suppose it is decided to
manufacture the chemical at an existing plant using conven￾tional chemical processing equipment. If the IH has been
involved in the pilot plant operation, he or she is well placed
to participate in a review of the control technology necessary
for the full-scale plant. As demonstrated in Table 2, the
range of talent necessary to define the engineering controls
may be extensive and the time frame well extended.
Step-by-step review to identify the appropriate engi￾neering controls will minimize worker exposure. If appro￾priate exposures are not installed during initial construction,
then controls will be retrofitted at significant increased cost.
Early integration of controls are most easily accepted and
economically implemented.
The most complex engineering controls are encountered
in the design and construction of a large and complex produc￾tion facility. The project is complex due to the range of issues
that are encountered; however, the design process is started
with a clean design sheet and state-of-the-art controls can be
included in the design. In the example in Table 2, a large
number of specialists are included in the review team. If the
design is done in-house, the IH should be a key participant.
If the design work is contracted to a design and construction
firm, plant personnel are one-step removed from the design
process. The company will usually have a project engineer to
interface between the outside team and company engineering
group. In this case, clear communication must be established
by the IH to ensure involvement in the design review.
For the IH facing his or her first process hazard review,
the job may seem daunting. An initial step is to identify your
responsibility. Does it include merely health issues at the
workplace or are environmental and fire protection problems

180ENGINEERING CONTROL OF AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS
to be included in your review? Once your responsibility has
been defined, the issues of concern for the project should
be identified. Mature industries such as metallurgical, glass,
and ceramics have been studied and extensive information is
available on standard operations and sources of contamina￾tion. As noted in Characterizing Air Contaminant Emission
Sources, the EPA has published emission factors for many
processes that are useful in process hazard reviews. Other
sources of information on control technology for mature
industries include numerous technical reports published by
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH). Search for specific topics at: www.2a.cdc.gov/
nioshtic; www.cdc.gov/niosh/surveyreports/default.html.
If the employer or company has similar operations else￾where, obtain material and process data, industrial hygiene
survey data, and air sampling information from that plant
to assist in the review. A step-by-step review of the opera￾tions can then be undertaken. This health and safety review
should be as rigorous as the review of percent yield on
the process and produce a detailed process flow diagram
showing the locations of contaminant emissions in addi￾tion to the major physical stresses such as noise, heat, and
ergonomics. It is also important to consider ancillary systems
such as compressed air, refrigeration, cooling towers, and
water treatment. Bulk handling of chemicals and gran￾ular minerals frequently presents a major industrial hygiene
problem and should be given special attention. Finally, a
detailed description of the workers’ tasks, including required
emergency response actions, is required since work location
and movement have a major effect on contaminant control.
A comprehensive checklist for review of environmental and
occupational health and safety issues in planning major plant
construction was provided by Whitehead (6).
An element that is frequently overlooked in the design of
engineering controls is the worker. A review of a specific
operation conducted by several workers frequently will iden￾tify subtle differences in the way the task is performed. A
worker inspired by a wish to reduce lifting or reduce dust
exposures may modify the tasks to accomplish these ends.
Workers frequently have insight into details of the operation
that the design engineer will overlook. The real-time video
monitoring approach discussed in Section 3.2.1 is useful in
defining these modifications in tasks.
It is sometimes difficult to find standard engineering
controls for emerging technologies. In some cases, industrial
groups develop and publish their own engineering controls.
Such is the case, for example, with advanced composite
manufacturing, a technology that was developed in recent
years in the manufacture of aircraft. An association of
companies involved in this work has published a volume
describing the major hazards and the controls that should be
applied (7).
The best control is often developed in the field, working
with plant employees. In the 1970s, for example, a number of

cases of asbestosis in shipyard workers fabricating asbestos
insulating pads for steam propulsion plants prompted the
plant to develop an integrated workstation incorporating
a number of control features. Initial designs of the down￾draft work table were fabricated and evaluated by workers
resulting in a number of recommendations that were incor￾porated in the final table, improving its acceptance and
performance (Figure 2).
3 ENGINEERING CONTROL
STRATEGIES
As noted earlier, engineering controls attempt first to elim￾inate air contaminant generation and emission; second,
prevent dispersal in the workplace; and third, control
contaminated air concentrations in the breathing zones
of employees. This stepped strategy is impacted by the
influence of toxic materials present in the process, plant
equipment, process type, operational factors, job tasks, work
practices, plant layout, and other factors discussed below.
3.1 Control of Toxic Materials
The use of toxic materials ranges in complexity from simple
wet degreasing to the synthesis of new chemicals as noted
181PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
above. In degreasing, the exposure is associated with the use
of the cleaning agent or handling of its wastes. In synthesis
of a new chemical, exposure may occur to raw materials,
intermediates, by-products, and the new chemical and/or
waste streams. To minimize worker exposure to such chem￾icals, it is necessary to consider the following engineering
control options.
3.1.1 Eliminate the Toxic Material
This option refers to elimination without replacement. Toxic
chemicals are often used in a process to improve yield or
to improve function or appearance. After careful review,
it may be possible to eliminate the chemical. The pressure
to do so may come from potential health effects, the cost
of workplace, and environmental controls to introduce the
toxic chemical into the plant, or it may arise from pressure
from the marketplace. An example of the latter resulted
from legislation in Switzerland requiring precautionary
labeling of batteries containing mercury. The conventional
dry cell battery utilized electrodes of manganese dioxide
and zinc with an electrolyte of ammonium chloride. A
characteristic of the cell was zinc corrosion with subsequent
power loss. A mercury compound was added to inhibit this
corrosion and resulting performance degradation. At least
one manufacturer determined the performance enhancement
from mercury was not necessary and the mercury compound
was removed from the battery formulation (8). This change
eliminated exposure to mercury for several hundred workers
in this company.
3.1.2 Replace with Alternative Material: Substitution
This control approach has the greatest potential for signif￾icant reduction in worker exposure to toxic chemicals. One
famous example involved the cooperative action taken by the
U.S. Public Health Service, the State of Connecticut Depart￾ment of Public Health, industry, and labor unions in 1941
to prevent mercurialism by replacing mercuric nitrate with
nonmercury compounds in the carroting process in felt hat
manufacture.
In another example, amendments to the Safe Drinking
Water Act effectively banned the use of lead-based solder.
The acceptable alternative solders are alloys of tin in the
range of 90–95% and the balance is copper, silver, zinc, or
antimony (9). The introduction of the alternative solder mini￾mized exposure of manufacturing, construction, and main￾tenance personnel to lead. The banning of mercury in hat
manufacture was an action taken specifically for occupa￾tional health reasons; the action on lead-based solder was
prompted by environmental concerns but had a positive
impact on the health of plant workers.
3.1.2.1 Historical Toxic Chemicals Use Reduction
and Replacement Approaches It is useful for the IH
to understand and incorporate into IH engineering control
strategies the toxic materials management nomenclatures,
approaches, and programs that have developed over the past
three decades in the broader EH & S field (see Table 3).
The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, for example,
described a national U.S. policy toxic waste management
hierarchy as follows: first, source reduction as the most desir￾able approach; second, recycling and reuse; third, treatment;
and finally, disposal as the least desirable approach (11).
To initiate this strategy the EPA established the Waste
Reduction Innovative Technology Evaluation (WRITE)
program. This program funded programs in six states and
one county over a three-year period to (i) provide engi￾neering and economically feasible solutions to industry
on specific pollution prevention problems, (ii) provide
performance and cost information on these techniques, and
(iii) promote early introduction of these pollution preven￾tion programs into commerce and industry. A review of
completed WRITE programs that demonstrated the useful￾ness and importance of replacement technology is shown in
Table 4 (12). Although initiated for environmental quality
reasons, each of these changes had a positive impact on
worker health in the facilities using these chemicals.

Historically, EPA has kept and maintained extensive
statistics about toxic materials in its Toxics Release Inven￾tory (TRI) database. The TRI tracks hundreds of chemicals
found in over thousands of facilities that manufacture, use,
process, or dispose of them. Such facilities are required to
provide annual reports on release, disposal, and manage￾ment of these 650 chemicals. See https://iaspub.epa.gov/
triexplorer/tri_release.chemical to find more information.
Denmark, one of many European countries to embark on
a national toxic use reduction program, based their work on
the simple step model shown in Table 5 (G. Goldschmidt,
personal communication).
The simplicity of this approach suggested that replace￾ment technology can be done on an ad hoc basis, however,
Goldschmidt (G. Goldschmidt, personal communication)
warned that chemical replacement for occupational health
reasons is a complex task and requires a systematic review
of both the existing conditions and those prevailing after
the replacement action. A review of 162 individual replace￾ment actions by the Danish Occupational Health Services
confirmed that replacement was successful if done in a
rational manner following the step model shown in Table 5.
Among the impressive examples of this program was the
replacement with water-based systems of the solvent-based
paints in all indoor paints and most outdoor paints.
3.1.2.2 State Toxic Use Reduction Programs The
Massachusetts Toxic Use Reduction Act of 1989 was a
good example of state efforts to control toxic materials in
that it focused on toxic use reduction and excluded off-site
recycling, off-site nonproduction unit recycling, transfer, or
treatment. The five toxic use reduction techniques acceptable
under the Massachusetts act were as follows:
• In-Process Recycling or Reuse. Recycling, reuse, or
extended use of toxins by using equipment or methods
that become an integral part of the production unit of
concern, including, but not limited to, filtration and
other closed-loop methods.
• Improved Operations and Maintenance. Modification
or addition to existing equipment or methods, including,
but not limited to, such techniques as improved house￾keeping practices, system adjustments, product and
process inspections, or production unit control equip￾ment or methods.
• Changes in the Production Process. Includes both the
modernization of production equipment by replacement
or upgrade based on the same technology or the intro￾duction of a new production equipment of an entirely
new design.
• Input Design. Replacement of a chemical used in
production with a chemical of a lower toxicity.
• Product Reformulation. Redesign of the product to
produce a product that is nontoxic or less toxic on use,
release, or disposal.
Rossi et al. (10) proposed two divergent routes a manu￾facturer could take. The route for ease of implementa￾tion included first, recycling and improved operations and
maintenance, then production process changes, and finally
replacement of toxic chemicals and product reformulation.
However, for effective toxic use reduction, the first step was
to eliminate or replace the toxic chemical in the process
183PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
or reformulate the product, then initiate production process
changes, and finally, recycle and apply operations and main￾tenance control techniques.
3.1.2.3 Industry-Based Programs One company’s
program to reduce toxic materials use is instructive for the
IH and is summarized here. The company had multiple
goals to reduce the use of toxic chemicals, minimize toxic
emissions to all environmental media, encourage recycling
of chemicals, and reduce all wastes (8). In the design of this
program, the company followed many of the recommen￾dations of the Office of Technology Assessment report on
the reduction of hazardous waste. In this company program,
specific goals for toxic use and waste reduction are set for all
production managers and their annual performance reviews
included this issue.
Each chemical used in the company was assigned to one
of five environmental risk categories (ERC). (The materials
in ERC I posed the greatest risk to the environment and ERC
II–ERC IV represented progressively less risk. A fifth cate￾gory included plastic, steel, paper, and other waste identified
as rubbish, rubble, and trash.) A critical issue in the design of
the program was the decision logic for assigning categories.
A number of options were considered, including ranking
chemicals based on workplace exposure guidelines such as
threshold limit values (TLVs) or permissible exposure limits
PELs), label signal words (13), regulatory lists published by
OSHA and EPA, and the mathematical weighting of a range
of risk factors, including toxicity and chemical and physical
properties (E. Karger, personal communication).
The company chose to assign the ERCs based on a “wise
person” approach based on a battery of risk factors reflecting
the materials’ total occupational and environmental impact
from release both as an isolated incident such as a spill or
the chronic release of small amounts of the chemical to air,
water, and soil. The majority of risk factors were toxicity
based and chosen to identify significant adverse health and
environmental impact. Included in the group of risk factors
were acute and chronic toxicity based on animal studies
or structural analysis, human case history, and epidemio￾logical studies, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity,
and reproductivity effects. A limited number of physical and
chemical properties associated with the “releasability” of
the chemicals were also included in a second group of risk
factors. The third group of risk factors reflected broad envi￾ronmental impacts. The specific criteria for assignment to the
five categories are shown in Table 6.
This company had a major chemical production facility
involved in the manufacture of photographic dyes that
required frequent changes in processes. Ahearn et al. (8)
state that in the design of new processes and products, the
evaluation of toxic use and waste minimization technology
should be given equal importance to considerations of
cost and performance of a new process or product. The

engineering group developing the new processes rigorously
reviewed all materials and process alternatives to ensure that
the target reductions were met. In this company, the “end
of pipe” abatement strategy was given secondary attention
relative to optimization of process and product design for
toxic use reduction.
An important part of the program was the goal of a 10%
reduction in the use of toxic materials per unit of production
each year for the first five years following the general strategy
of elimination of use, replacement with a material of lower
risk, reduction in quantity used, and a hierarchal program
of waste handling. The goal was to eliminate, replace, or
reduce the use of categories I and II materials and ensure the
maximum reuse of categories III and IV materials.
In describing the success of the program, the authors
(8) presented an example of a process in which a change
resulted in elimination of a carcinogenic material. The orig￾inal process required an aqueous oxidation step using a
hexavalent chromium compound; the new process was based
on a catalyzed air oxidation step that did not require the
chromium compound (Figure 3). As a result of this change,
worker exposure to hexavalent chromium was eliminated and
this process change saved the company over one million
dollars. It was the conclusion of this company that the
process that used the least quantity of toxic chemicals was
usually the most economical.
As active participants in the global market, manufacturers
in the U.S. have been implementing international manage￾ment consensus standards. The most widely sought approval
continues to be that of the ISO 14000 Environmental

Management Systems Standard (14). To gain registration
under this standard, a firm is audited to ensure that the
company has an effective management system in place
so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding their
impact on the environment (and as a consequence, a positive
impact on employee health).
3.1.2.4 Outcome of Replacement Technology
Although the replacement of toxic chemicals may provide
impressive gains, the replacement of a target material must
be done with great caution. If the replacement technique
is to be used successfully, it must be carefully reviewed
to define its impact on worker health and environmental
impact, product yield, and product quality (Figure 3). It is
important that the impact be evaluated in both pilot plant
operation and field trials before making the change.
Historically, IHs have devoted more attention to solvent
replacement for metal cleaning than any other control
problem. It is useful to expand on the history of such
cleaning agents because it demonstrates the complexity of
the replacement technology approach and suggests pitfalls
that may arise in using this technique. Wolf et al. (15) review
the major decisions on general degreasing solvents during
this period as follows:
In the 1960s and 1970s in particular, chlorinated
solvents were widely substituted for flammable
solvents because they better protected workers from
flammability. As smog regulations were promulgated
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, users moved from
the photochemically reactive flammable solvents and
TCE to the other “exempt” chlorinated solvents. In the
1980s, there was increased scrutiny of the chlorinated
solvents: TCE, PERC, and METH were considered
undesirable because of their suspect carcinogenicity,
and TCE and CFC-113 were being examined for their
contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion.
Each change starting in the 1950s, progressing from
flammable solvents to chlorinated solvents to nonphoto￾chemical reactive materials to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
solvents, introduced a new set of problems. The six major
classes of solvents were used in 1999 and there was pres￾sure for replacement due to the array of human toxicity and
environmental effects. The increased use of CFCs in the
1970s and 1980s, rising to a level of 180 × 103 metric tons
per year, was based on performance and reduced chronic
toxicity. However, the impact of these chemicals on ozone
depletion resulted in the ban on manufacturing of CFC-113
and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) worldwide in 1996. The
hydrochlorofluorocarbons were considered interim candi￾dates for industrial degreasing, but are now considered for
banning in 2020 and 2040. The hydrofluorocarbons and
the other candidate solvents not containing chlorine do not
present an ozone depletion risk but may present unacceptable
toxicity concerns.
A vigorous research effort was pursued by dozens of
companies to develop alternatives to the cleaning agents
listed in Table 7. It is doubtful that a single agent will ever
be found that will have the broad application of the chlo￾rinated solvents, however, good progress has been made
in nonozone-depleting, hydrocarbon-based systems. Again,
all these efforts have indirectly put positively impacted
employee exposure, health, and well-being. As such, it is
useful for the IH to be involved in and aware of all forms
of environmental actions.
3.1.3 Dust Control
A number of techniques are used to minimize worker expo￾sure to pneumonoconiosis-producing and toxic dusts based
on changes in the physical form or state of the material. The
common techniques to reduce “dustiness” in this manner are
presented below.
3.1.3.1 Moisture Content of Material The relation￾ship between moisture content of granular materials and
worker exposure to dust is well known. The use of water as
a dust suppressant has been of great interest to the mining,
mineral processing, and foundry industries. Research by
the British Cast Iron Research Association demonstrated
that silica in air concentrations in foundries was maintained
below the then existing exposure standards when the mois￾ture content of foundry sand was kept above 30% (16). A
sand handling technique that involves direct blending of new
moist sand directly from the mixer with shakeout sand to add
moisture to cool the shakeout sand and reduce dustiness was
described by Schumacher (17). The author also demonstrated

a correlation between results of a simple laboratory dustiness
test and in-plant dust exposure.
The Bureau of Mines and the National Industrial Sand
Association investigated the use of foams, steam, and water
sprays for dust control in mineral processing plants (18).
Foam was found to be approximately 20% more effective
than water alone or water with a surfactant. Steam also
produced impressive reductions in dust concentrations of
65%, however, as is the case with foam, it is more expensive
to apply than water.
The British Occupational Hygiene Society (19) explored
various dustiness estimation methods that could be useful in
design of control systems. In chemical processing, a solid
product is often isolated in cake form that is wet with solvent
or water. Frequently this material must be dried to ensure
product quality and shelf life and to permit packing and
shipping. However, if the product is to be used “in-house,”
one should determine if the drying operation can be omitted
permitting direct handling of the wet cake thereby saving
money and reducing dustiness.
3.1.3.2 Particle Size In general, the more extensive the
grinding or comminution of a granular material, the greater
the dust hazard the material will present during transport,
handling, and processing. When possible, purchase the most
coarse form of the chemical that is suitable for the process.
There are production implications that may override consid￾erations of worker exposure. As an example, if the material
must be placed in solution, the large particle size will slow
this process.
3.1.3.3 Dust Controlled Forms In the last three
decades, the rubber, pharmaceutical, pigments, and dyestuff
industries have given attention to the dustiness of the raw
materials they produce and use. Dustiness testing has been
extended and significant product design changes have been
adopted to minimize dustiness, worker exposure, and product
acceptance. In tire manufacture at least a dozen chemicals in
granular form are added in small quantities to the batch mix.
In an effort to minimize worker exposure to dust from these
chemicals, The British Rubber Manufacturing Association

sponsored design of low dusting forms of these common
chemicals. The properties of seven dust-controlled forms
of rubber chemicals were reviewed by Hammond (20),
shown in Table 8. The author notes that the disadvantages
of the most effective approach, coating the chemical with a
polymer, included the variability in active chemical content
based on bulk weight, the reduced chemical content, and the
unsuitability of the polymer in the formulation.
3.1.3.4 Slurry Form This application has limited appli￾cation, but in those cases where it can be used, it does have
great impact on dust concentrations. In the tire industry, for
example, “masterbatch” rubber, rubber processed with all
chemicals except the vulcanizing agent, was processed from
the Banbury to the drop mill where it was “sheeted off” for
storage. Until 1960, dry talc or limestone was dusted on the
slabs of “masterbatch” material to keep it from sticking. This
operation resulted in poor housekeeping and a significant
exposure to talc. A more protective technique, adopted in the
1960s, involved dipping the stock in a slurry of talc-in-water
before racking for storage. This simple change resulted in a
significant reduction in worker exposure to talc.
3.1.4 Impurities in Production Chemicals
Even in low concentrations, impurities or unreacted chem￾icals in a raw or final product may create exposures that
warrant control.
3.1.4.1 Residual Monomer in Polymer In polymer
manufacture, there is frequently unreacted monomer in
the final product. Residual monomer had not been given
much attention until the early 1970s when angiosarcoma, a
rare liver cancer, noted in workers manufacturing the vinyl
chloride polymer was attributed to the monomer exposure.
Investigation showed that the polymer used in subsequent
fabricating operations had unreacted monomer present in
concentrations as high as 0.4% (21). This level of contam￾ination prompted concern about the monomer exposure of
workers handling the bulk polymer in plastic fabrication
operations such as injection molding. As a result of this
concern, the vinyl chloride manufacturers modified the
manufacturing process to reduce the monomer concentra￾tion to less than 1 ppm (22), thereby eliminating significant
worker exposure. Residual monomer is frequently present in
concentrations up to 1% in many of the common polymers
and may warrant control. If significant air concentrations
are noted when handling the polymer, engineering control
should be first based on the removal or reduction of the
monomer content in the polymer, with other controls
considered next if this is not possible.
3.1.4.2 Solvent Impurities Impurities may pose an
unrecognized risk, especially in solvents of high volatility.
In the manufacturing of automobile tires, for example, the
various rubber components were “laid up” on a tire-building
machine. To effect good bonding between the components,
the rubber was made tacky by applying a small amount
of solvent to the surface with a pad. For several decades,
this solvent was benzene. Worker exposure, probably in
the range of 1–10 ppm, may be responsible for the excess
leukemia seen in older tire builders. Starting in the 1950s,
the industry began to replace benzene with white gaso￾line, a safer solvent. However, in studies completed in
the 1970s by the Harvard School of Public Health Joint
Rubber Studies Group, the residual benzene content in
white gasoline was 4–7% and air sampling indicated that
1/3 of the air samples on tire builders exceeded 1 ppm
(R.L. Treitman, personal communication). As shown by
this historic example, technical-grade chemicals can have
187PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
significant impurities. The level of contamination should be
identified by the IH and if sufficiently high, worker exposure
should be evaluated. The necessity for the reduction in the
impurity level can then be determined.
3.2 Equipment and Processes
In Section 3.1, the engineering control options focused on
the choice of materials to minimize the generation and emis￾sion of airborne contaminants. An equally important step is
a review of the various alternatives in the choice of equip￾ment and processes. A number of operational insights should
be considered when choosing a facility and its equipment.
Wolfson (23) emphasized the importance of this effort and
suggested that the removal of dispersal mechanisms should
be a major objective of the design and selection of facilities
and equipment.
3.2.1 Diagnostic Air Sampling
Contaminant control cannot be achieved until the significant
operational elements of the process that generate and release
the contaminant are identified. Occasionally, this can be done
simply by a critical review of the operations but usually,
diagnostic air sampling is necessary.
The value of short-interval, task-oriented air sampling
using conventional integrated sampling with subsequent
analysis has been clearly stated by Caplan (24). In describing
this approach, illustrated in Table 9, Caplan states,
For the job analyzed in Table 9 presumably a single
sample would have shown a concentration of 0.21 mg m−3.
The task-oriented sampling, however, reveals several inter￾esting things.
Column 5 shows that tasks B and C are the major contrib￾utors to the day’s exposures and that a significant reduction in
the concentration at either of those tasks would be adequate
to bring the eight-hour exposure well below the TLV. This is
true even though task C in itself is below the TLV. In addition,
it shows that task F, well above the TLV concentration, is of
such short duration that significant improvement in that part
of the exposure would not have a large effect on the eight￾hour exposure.
The difficulty in this approach is that it is not possible to
frequently measure the air concentrations during brief indi￾vidual tasks and activities due to the low air sampling rate
and the limited sensitivity of the analytical procedures. To
reveal important generation points in the job, it is necessary
to resolve the air concentration profile in a time frame of
seconds. The advent of real-time, direct-reading air sampling
instruments for particles, gases, and vapors with response
times of less one second now permit the investigator to iden￾tify these critical contaminant elements in process events and
work practices. In recent years, this air sampling technique
has seen expanded application with coincidental videotaping
of the worker during a work cycle. In its most sophisticated
form, the time-coupled, real-time contaminant concentration
at the workers breathing zone is superimposed on the video
display permitting the viewer to analyze the data display to
identify the specific time and location of release. Control
technology can then be applied to those tasks or incidents.
The video display approach may also be used to identify
work practices that may either positively or adversely affect
worker exposure. In a talc bagging operation, for example,
one individual consistently had the lowest dust exposure
although visual inspection did not reveal any differences in
equipment or work practice. If the real-time technique were
available, the worker’s “secret” could have been identified
and applied to the other workers. When a “correct way of
doing the job” can be identified, the video concentration
format is an excellent educational tool for workers.
A series of studies by NIOSH investigators described
the application of this technique to a range of in-plant
tasks (25,26). The air sampling instrument was a real-time
monitor with a response time much shorter than the period
of the shortest worker activity or movement. The instrument
was equipped with a data logger with a clock “locked￾in” or synchronized with the video. The data logger was

by the worker’s body. Effective control of the dust exposure
was obtained with one-third of the airflow of the original
system. In addition to improved worker protection, the cost
savings of the new system resulted in a payback period of
4.5 years.
The Swedish National Institute of Occupational Health
adapted this technique to allow real-time mixing of the
concentration and video portions by radio telemetry (27).
The intermediate datalogging of exposure information
was eliminated; the direct reading instrument data signal
was converted to a radio frequency and broadcast with a
transmitter to a receiver for processing by a microcomputer.
The investigator received immediate feedback on the effects
of engineering controls and work practices. In the United
States, investigators at the NIOSH modified this system for
a series of controlled technology studies.
189PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
Such diagnostic tools may see even more expanded appli￾cations to workstation designs in the coming years because it
permits the engineer to identify the specific tasks, equipment
function, or worker movements that contribute to worker
exposure.
3.2.2 Equipment
3.2.2.1 Ancillary Equipment The stepwise review of
the dispersal potential noted above should include all equip￾ment, not only the major machinery. The importance of this
approach is highlighted when one looks at the history of the
use of simple air nozzles in the industry. For most of the
1900s, the widespread application of the air nozzle oper￾ating at line pressure (100 psi) was used to remove chips and
cutting oil from machined parts and to dry parts after cleaning
with solvent. In the 1970s, OSHA required that the operating
pressure for these nozzles for cleaning purposes be dropped
from 100 to 30 psi. This change had many positive effects,
including a reduction in noise, eye injuries, solvent mist, and
vapor exposures.
Another common piece of equipment, albeit much more
complex, is the centrifugal pump. The difficulty of equip￾ment selection is typified by the experience of a chemical
engineering team designing a modern chemical plant having
hundreds of centrifugal pumps. A major issue in such plants
is the impact of fugitive losses from rotating machinery such
as pumps on the workplace and general environment (29).
The total loss percentage from rotating machinery varies
from 8% to 24% with overall uncontrolled emissions ranging
from 31 to 3231 ton year−1 for a model chemical plant or a
large refinery (32). The authors describe two possible control
programs for pump fugitive losses – either a monitoring and
maintenance program or engineering control by installation
of dual seal pumps, sealless pumps, and a closed exhaust
hood with air cleaning.
The historic phaseout of TCA and trichlorotrifluo￾roethane solvents in vapor phase degreasers accelerated
the search for alternative solvents, as described in Ref.
(32). Initial steps to reduce emissions from this common
equipment included the use of covers, increased freeboard
height, refrigerated condenser fluids, and lower hoist speeds.
Although these changes did reduce fugitive emissions
and therefore worker exposures, the survival of this type of
equipment was also made possible through the availability of
vapor tight degreasers (33). In the past, such closed system
technology has been associated with major processing
facilities.
3.2.2.2 Major Processing Equipment The complexity
of the control technology problem becomes apparent when
one moves from choices of ancillary equipment to decisions
on major pieces of processing equipment. As an example,
a small chemical processing plant for organic synthesis is a
multifloor plant with a series of major operations staffed by
six chemical technicians. The condensed version reviewed in
this chapter (Figure 6) permits discussion of equipment alter￾natives to minimize the generation and release of air contam￾inants. The three-step process includes, first, a reaction step
to form a solid in suspension, conducted in a pressure vessel.
In this case, there is no alternative equipment. The reaction
must be conducted in a closed pressure vessel equipped with
the safety controls shown in Figure 6 to minimize the possi￾bility of a chemical accident.
The second step, the isolation of the solid reaction
product, can be done by at least three different techniques.
The environmental contaminant potential of these processes
varies considerably. However, the choice cannot be made
on this basis alone, since these techniques do have specific
production capabilities that may be the major determinant
in the choice. Finally, the reaction product is dried and
drummed for sale or use in a subsequent operation. Again,
there are several ways to accomplish the drying. The ranking
of these isolation and drying operations based on their
environmental impact is shown in Figure 6.
The responsibility for the choice of specific equipment in
the processing plant will rest with the project design group
and will be based on production capacity, ancillary services
required, maintenance history, and cost and delivery in addi￾tion to health and safety considerations. It is not expected that
the IH will have complete operational and application data
on all chemical unit operations, but the environmental and
worker health impacts must be understood and made known
to the engineering group.
3.2.3 Processes
A review of the production engineering literature shows a
range of processes that can be considered for a manufacturing
facility. The choice is usually made based on production
output and cost data. Industrial processes designed to accom￾plish a given task have one other parameter, their ability to
contaminate the workplace; this characteristic of a process
should be given equal weight to production criteria (34).
The development of technology in a given area such
as welding has historically been pushed by production
needs, not by worker health concerns. Over time, welding
technology has become more complex and sometimes
more environmentally challenging. Studies have also been
conducted to influence the process design to minimize air
contamination. This was the case with Gray and Hewitt (35)
who defined the welding operating parameters that influence
fume generation and proposed operational configurations
that minimize fume formation rate and the chemical
composition of the fume, thereby permitting improved
efficiency of controls.
An exercise that demonstrates the value of a ranking
approach for process environmental impacts is shown in the

After the reaction is complete, the new chemical is isolated by one of three techniques – nutsche filter, plate and frame filter, or centrifuge. The
resulting wet cake is then dried by one of three methods – tray drier, conical drier, or fluidized bed drier. The isolation and drying techniques
are ranked by environmental impact with the worst process noted first.
manufacture of an electronic cabinet (Figure 7). As in the
case of the chemical process shown above, the fabrication
steps are simplified for ease of discussion. The four enclo￾sure components are fabricated from lightweight aluminum
stock using sheet metal shear, brake, and punch. These oper￾ations may present a noise hazard but do not generate air
contaminants and will not be included here. The enclosure
can be assembled and painted by a number of techniques; the
processes are ranked from worst to best in terms of adverse
effect from air contamination.
Another general approach that applies to many processes
is the use of containment. This control approach was
considered by an engineering control panel sponsored by
the Environmental Protection Agency, and the following
containment ranking was proposed (36):
Standard control measures may often be categorized
for each process: a sealed and isolated system where
airborne contaminant levels are very low (ppb range for
vapors); a substantially closed system where airborne
contaminant levels are still relatively low (fraction of
ppm or low ppm range for vapors); a semi-closed
system which is typical of nondedicated equipment
used in job shop chemical processing facilities; and an
open system.
An example of a sealed and isolated system is the modern
refinery where such an approach is required both for produc￾tion reasons and health and safety. A substantially closed
system is typified by a semiconductor manufacturing facility
and a semiclosed system by the chemical processing plant
in Figure 6. In such fine chemical processing plants, it is
common for the product to be made by an elaborate chain
of separate reaction steps with a number of intermediates
formed. In many cases, the intermediate chemical must be

isolated and removed from the vessel. Each transfer of the
intermediate poses a potential for release of contaminants.
Since the reaction train may include dozens of steps and
take weeks to complete, a method that would streamline the
process and reduce the number of transfers would reduce the
exposure of the worker.
With the introduction of the pressure nutsche (a type of
vessel), it is now possible for chemical plants with relatively
simple reaction trains to convert to a closed system. This
reaction vessel permits the chemical engineer to design a
reaction sequence, including formation of the new molecule,
cleaning of the product, and drying and packaging all without
removing the chemical from the vessel at each step with its
resulting exposure to the chemical processing worker.
Even more impressive as a control technique was the
introduction of a process called cascade chemistry (37). In
this approach, the organic synthesis reactions are conducted
at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with care￾fully selected initial charging chemicals. Properly designed,
one reaction cascades into another without the addition of
new chemicals. In this system, hazards are minimized by

operating at low temperature and pressure while eliminating
the isolation and transfer steps.
Most common industrial facilities, that is, foundries, elec￾troplating, painting, welding, and machining are examples of
open systems. The contaminant released as a mist from elec￾trolytic plating operations can be trapped by a layer of plastic
chips or a persistent foam blanket on the surface of the bath.
Surfactants may be added to the electrolyte to reduce mist
escape. The plate-and-frame filter in the chemical processing
industry is difficult to handle with local exhaust ventilation.
Often a solvent wash of the cake with a highly toxic mate￾rial results in high exposure when the filter is broken and the
solvent-wet cake is removed. In some cases, after the initial
wash, the cake can be washed with isopropanol to strip out
the toxic solvent. It is then washed with water so that the
exposure when the filter is broken and the product is removed
is nil.
Other examples of process changes (developed in the EPA
WRITE program) are shown in Table 10.
3.3 Work Task Modification, Automation,
and Robotics
It is well known that simple changes in work tasks and work
practices can have significant impacts on worker exposures.
In the 1900s, workplace time and motion studies were used
to improve productivity. Later a job placement technique
(38) based on a detailed analysis of the time and effort of
the job tasks was effective in reducing on the job injuries.
More recently, the analytical tools of the ergonomic specialist
permit identifying difficult tasks contributing to occupational
injuries and illness.
As suggested in Section 3.2.1, the IH has techniques
to investigate the source of contaminants, the generation
192ENGINEERING CONTROL OF AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS
mechanism, and to make a semiquantitative assessment of
the generation rate. This approach has tremendous value
in analyzing not only the critical generation points on the
machine but also in viewing the impact of specific worker
actions and movement on air concentrations. Preliminary
studies reveal that minor changes in work position and move￾ment may offer significant reductions in exposure.
Occasionally, the specific modification in work practice is
dictated by knowledge of the mechanisms of generation and
release of the contaminant. Such is the case with the flow of
granular material at material transfer points. The generation
mechanism is the airflow induced by the falling granular
material (39). The induced airflow can be minimized by
restricting the open area of the upstream face, reducing the
free fall distance, and reducing the material flow rate.
Automation is a general technique that separates the
worker from the individual process. A good example of this
technique is the manufacture of asphalt roof shingles. In the
1970s, competition resulted in the automation of all parts of
the process from the dipping of the stock to the bundling of
the package.
Another example of a simple automation process that
reduces worker exposure is tire curing. In the early plants,
the worker lifted the tire out of a curing press at the end
of the curing cycle and placed another tire in the mold for
curing. During this period, he was directly exposed to the
emissions released from the press. By 1970, most plants had
automated this process. The worker now places the uncured
tire on a holding rack in front of the curing press line. When
the curing cycle is completed, the tire is ejected from the
press to a belt conveyor and the next tire to be cured is
transferred from the rack to the press without exposure of the
worker.
The spread of robotic techniques has permitted almost all
industrial procedures to be good candidates for automation.
The movement of the worker who buffs rubber boots can
now be captured by a robotic system as shown in Figure 8.
Another application of robotic techniques is spray painting
where the robotic system reproduces the movement of a
skilled painter. Although ventilation is still required on this
job, the worker overseeing the operation is separated from
the point of release of the paint mist and solvent.
3.4 Facility Layout and Equipment
Placement
As stated earlier, the most efficient way to do a job is the
one that is most environment-friendly. Certainly, this is true
insofar as overall plant layout is concerned (40).
In the shop fabricating the enclosure in Figure 7, the
desired flow of materials is from the incoming truck dock
or railroad siding to sheet metal fabrication and then to
assembly, finishing, inspection, and finally shipping. In a
FIGURE 8 Robotic buffing of rubber boots. Source: Repro￾duced with permission of Matti koivumaki.
facility manufacturing pharmaceuticals, the input chemi￾cals are transported to bulk storage and then to chemical
processing, packaging, inspection, and shipping. In all manu￾facturing processes from handling metal to fine chemicals, it
is important to minimize the distance the material is moved
and the number of times it is picked up and transferred. When
this rule is followed, worker exposure to air contaminants is
usually minimized.
3.4.1 Material Transport
This issue is given major attention in industry where large
quantities of raw material, intermediates, and final products
are handled. Examples are injection molding of children’s
toys, manufacture of automobile tires, and paint manufac￾ture. In some cases, material handling alone defines the plant
layout. Bulk storage is often in large silos located outside
the plant with delivery to the workstations by mechanical or
pneumatic conveyors. This was true in the manufacture of
plastic tape where tons of PVC granules were used each day
(Figure 9). This plant also required large quantities of solvent
delivered from bulk storage by piping to mix tanks and then
directly to the coating heads. The intent of this system was
to have all material handling to the individual coaters done
in closed systems.
In organic synthesis, it is common practice to have outside
bulk storage of at least a dozen solvents. The solvents
are transferred to an inside reaction vessel by piping to a
reactor manifold with necessary valving and meters. Gran￾ular materials used in small quantities are stored in adjoining
storage areas and delivered to the reactor and charged by
manual dumping, with a dumping fixture, or occasionally
with a transfer lock. When a large number of drums must
be dumped, a bulk handling system can be used with direct
delivery to the reactor vessel.

3.4.2 General Considerations
The location of the process within the facility can greatly
influence a worker’s exposure. This is true of operations such
as foundries where jobs may be easily classed as clean or
dirty and where exposures vary greatly. The conventional
iron foundry provides a good example of the importance
of plant layout. It is common practice to define the optimal
plant layout as one with airflow from the cleanest to the dirt￾iest operations with the exhaust focal point establishing this
gradient (see Figure 10a). The layout of a similar foundry
that does not follow this guideline is shown in Figure 10b. In
the latter case, the relatively clean molding line is positioned
adjacent to the shakeout, an area where the control of
airborne foundry dust and thermal degradation products is
difficult. This poor layout results in silica and other contami￾nants released by shakeout moving into the molding area and
exposing this work population. If the desired concentration
gradient cannot be achieved by ventilation or distance, then
structural walls or plastic barriers are a possibility. Although
such barriers define the space, compartmentalizing compli￾cates the design and application of local exhaust ventilation,
replacement air, HVAC, and other important services.
3.4.3 Workstations
A foundry in Finland faced problems not only of airborne
contaminants but also heat, noise, and housekeeping in
casting cleaning. The problems were resolved by redesigning
the open workspace to provide individual workstations
designed with integrated services positioned for ease of
work (Figure 11). This layout resulted in improved material
flow, better housekeeping, reduced air contamination, better
ergonomics, and improved productivity. The success of the
installation was due, in part, to close employee–employer
involvement in the design.
3.4.4 Service and Maintenance
Close attention is often given to production area layout as
noted in the above example, but rarely given to the working
environment of the maintenance group. An example of an
area where maintenance was not considered was tire-curing
presses in the plants of the 1970s. The presses were arranged
in double rows back-to-back with limited space between
rows for steam, water, and electrical services. While this
layout and density represented optimal use of space, repairs

of steam and water piping were done in an extremely tight
space and controls for the worker were difficult to set up.
The best example of a planned layout that provides proper
workspace for the trades is noted in the semiconductor
industry (Figure 12). In this layout, all transfer pumps, distri￾bution lines, and vacuum pumps are located in a service alley
separated from the fabrication bay. This design reflects prin￾cipal concern, not for the comfort of the maintenance worker,
but rather to protect the fabrication area against contamina￾tion. Notwithstanding, it does result in adequate space for the
trades to carry out their work in a safe manner (M. Horowitz,
personal communication).
An extension of this concern is the installation of a
small field service bench with necessary tools and equipment
in plant production areas where maintenance is frequently
done. This arrangement permits the maintenance person to
do many repairs at the site and not transport equipment back
to a main facility with the potential for chemical spills.
3.4.5 Segregation of Operation
It is often necessary to segregate or remove an operation
from the main production area as an engineering control
measure. In the semiconductor and fiber optics industry,
each time a new facility is designed, engineers must choose

whether to store small amounts of highly toxic gases close to
the production tool or store large quantities at a segregated
position some distance from the plant to be distributed by
double-walled piping to the production tools. This latter
segregation technique permits the plant to reduce the number
of persons at risk while providing extensive controls at the
work site. This option must be weighed against storing small
quantities of gas directly at the tool, thereby minimizing
failures in the transfer systems but requiring frequent change
of gas cylinders with the entailed risks.
3.4.6 Isolation of the Worker
The practice of isolating the worker as a control measure is
placed under this section since it should be considered in
conjunction with the layout of the major equipment. This
widely used technique was mandated by OSHA coke oven
regulations that require enclosures with clean, conditioned
air. The larry car and pusher cars had controlled environ￾ment cab enclosures; the lidsmen had enclosures designed to
remove them from the hostile coke oven environment during
available rest periods.
In other industries, this approach has been chosen
to eliminate worker exposure to air contaminants while
providing a comfortable working environment. These appli￾cations include enclosed booths on a variety of construction
equipment, front end loaders in smelters, crane cabs in
metallurgical industries, operator cabs in steel rolling mills,
and pouring stations in foundries.
3.5 Ventilation
In the introduction to this chapter, it was stated that venti￾lation is an important component of engineering controls.
(In fact, ventilation of some form is required at every
human occupancy.) If air contaminants are emitted, they
can be collected at the source – with various degrees of
success – using local exhaust ventilation; or, if dissemi￾nated, air contaminants can be diluted to some acceptable,
safe concentration with dilution ventilation. These important
engineering controls have traditionally been called industrial
ventilation. (“Industrial” as in “Industrial Hygiene.”) Indus￾trial Ventilation covers the application of these two engi￾neering control approaches.
4 STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
Engineering controls should always be built to current
standards of good engineering practice. These include
international and local building codes, OSHA, EPA, and
other government codes and regulations, ANSI (American
National Standards Institute) and ASTM standards, and
various “standard of practice” guidelines published by orga￾nizations such as NIOSH, DOT, AIHA, ACGIH, ASSE, and
others.
Similarly, professional IH activities should always be
guided by standards and guidelines of good practice. Indus￾trial hygiene and occupational health standards fall into two
basic classes: mandatory standards (e.g. OSHA regulations)
and recommended or consensus standards (e.g. ACGIH
TLV®, AIHA WEEL, ISO 14000 standard on environmental
management, ANSI/ASSE Z910 standard on dilution venti￾lation, ANSI/ASSE Z.10 standard on occupational health
and safety management systems, and ASHRAE 62 standard
on indoor air quality).
Important mandatory standards and codes (e.g. PELs)
have been developed by the federal government in accor￾dance with provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act (OSH Act) of 1970. The Mine Safety and Health Act
of 1977 also provided for codes and standards development
related to mining health and safety. Types of OSHA stan￾dards include design standards (e.g. ventilation standards
of 1910.94) and performance standards (e.g. PEL standards
of 1910.1000). Within these are the so-called vertical stan￾dards (e.g. standards that apply to only one industry, such
as 1910.261 related to the pulp and paper industry) and
horizontal standards (e.g. standards that cover one topic but
apply to all industries, such as 1910.141 related to walking
and working surfaces).
Other standards-writing organizations of interest to the
IH and that could impact engineering controls include the
ANSI, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department
of Defense and its components, the National Fire Protec￾tion Association, the National Safety Council, the American
Public Health Association, and ISO (International Standards
Organization).
Perhaps the most important standard related to industrial
ventilation is ANSI Z9.2-2018, Fundamentals Governing
the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems (41).
The American Society of Safety Engineers is the Secretariat
of the Z9 Committee. The Z9 Committee overseas the
development and publication of 14 industrial ventilation
standards (41, 42).

1 INTRODUCTION
There are many approaches available for controlling air
contaminant sources, emissions and worker exposures.
These include the various administrative, preventive, and
(generally preferred) engineering controls covered in Char￾acterizing Air Contaminant Emission Sources. Industrial
ventilation (IV) is the most widely used engineering control.
In fact, ventilation is required in every human occupancy.
“Industrial” in this case is used in the same sense it is used
in “Industrial Hygiene” (IH).
Because virtually all emission and exposure control
projects involve the use of ventilation in some fashion, every
IH receives training in the selection, operation, testing, and
troubleshooting of IV systems. This chapter provides a
review of the subject and is intended for practicing IHs.
At its most fundamental level, industrial ventilation
provides control of an environment by strategic use of
airflow. The flow of air may be used to control thermal
stresses (e.g. overheating of a workspace, high humidity),
to remove an air contaminant near its source of emis￾sion using local exhaust ventilation (LEV) (e.g. welding
exhaust hood, duct, fan, and stack), to dilute the airborne
concentration of a contaminant to acceptable exposure
levels using natural or mechanical dilution ventilation (e.g.
dilution ventilation used to control fugitive emissions during
welding), and to replace air exhausted from the workplace
(e.g. providing “makeup” air to replace that exhausted at
a welding operation). Applied either as a general or local
control, industrial ventilation also has the objectives of

preventing fires and explosions, and most important to the
industrial hygienist, preserving employee health, safety,
comfort, and productivity.
Principles and applications of LEV and dilution ventila￾tion are presented in subsequent sections of this chapter. Use
of these principles in solving exposure problems requires
a basic understanding of the fundamental relationships that
describe airflow. These are presented briefly in the following
section; more elaborate discussions and derivations of these
relationships are given in several of the references provided
at the end of this chapter (1–3).
2 FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITIONS
AND PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS
STP is the standard temperature and barometric pressure
(Re: American Conf of Governmental Industrial Hygienist
(ACGIH)) for most industrial ventilation systems:
T = 70∘F,BP = 29.92 in.Hg, dry air (US units)
T = 21∘C,BP = 760 mmHg, dry air (SI units)
Properties of air at STP: MW ≈ 29;
weight density = 0.075 ft−3 = 1.2 kgm−3
2.1 Airflow Rate
The fundamental equation describing airflow rate is referred
to as the “continuity equation” or principle of “conservation
199PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
of mass.” This relationship states that the mass rate of airflow
remains constant along the path taken by the air. For any
two points in the airstream we can express the relation￾ship as
A1V1𝜌1 = A2V2𝜌2 (1)
where A is the cross-sectional area through which the air
moves (ft2 or m2), V is the average linear velocity of air
(fpm or m s−1), and 𝜌 is the air weight density (lb ft−3 or
g m−3).
For most industrial applications, 𝜌 is relatively constant
because absolute (or barometric) pressures and temperatures
within a ventilation system vary over a narrow range (usually
less than a few percent of ambient barometric pressures and
temperatures) so the air remains essentially “incompress￾ible.” (Exceptions exist where air is heated in the system.)
Therefore, in most cases:
A1V1 = A2V2
Note that the units, ft min−1 × ft2 =ft3 min−1 =a unit of
flow rate, designated in this chapter as Q. So,
Q = VA (ft3 min−1 or m3 s
−1;
these are often written as “cfm” and “cms”) (2)
Sample Calculation. The cross-sectional area of a round
12 in. diameter duct is A=0.7854 ft2. The average velocity
of air flowing in the duct is V=2250 feet per minute (fpm).
What is the air flowrate, Q? Assume STP.
Q = V ⋅ A
= 2250 fpm ⋅ 0.7854 ft2 = 1770 scfm
Note: “scfm” suggests a flow rate at STP; a flow rate for
non-STP air is often designated as “acfm,” flow corrected for
actual conditions.
2.2 Density Correction for Air at Non-STP
To correct for nonstandard air, ventilation engineers estimate
a density correction factor, d (or df). d is derived from the
Ideal Gas equations and is used to correct air density for
temperatures and barometric pressures different from STP.
Note: the ACGIH definition of STP is used in this chapter.
In the following equation, BP is the absolute barometric
pressure.

the barometric pressure is 27.50 in.Hg. What is the density

29.92 in. = 0.886
2.3 Velocity Pressure and Velocity
Velocity pressure (VP) is pressure exerted by air in motion.
(Wind creates force and pressure; think of a hurricane.) If
SP is analogous to potential energy (Section 2.4), then VP
is analogous to kinetic energy and is directly related to air
velocity. It exists only when air is in motion, acts in the
direction of airflow, and is always positive in sign. The
relationship between the velocity of air and VP is given by
Bernoulli’s equation:
V = 4005√VP∕d (US)
V = 4.043√VP∕d (SI) (4)
where V is the velocity (fpm or m s−1), 4005 is the US units
factor, 4.043 is the SI units factor, VP is the velocity pressure
(in.w.g. or mmw.g.), w.g. is the “water gauge,” the pressure
given in height of water column on a manometer, and d is the
air density correction factor, unitless (at STP, d=1).
Sample Calculation. The average VP of an airstream in
a duct is VP=0.33 in.w.g. What is the average velocity?
(assume STP, d=1).
V = 4005(VP∕d)
1∕2 = 4005(0.33∕1)
1∕2 = 2300 fpm
2.4 Static Pressure (SP)
Static pressure (SP), created by gravity (as barometric pres￾sure or atmospheric SP) and modified by fans in a ventilation
system, produces the energy required to initiate air move￾ment and create VP at the hood, overcomes the resistance
in a system caused by friction of the air against the duct
walls, and overcomes turbulence and shock losses caused
by a change in direction or velocity of air movement. SP is
analogous to potential energy, and it exists even where there
is no air motion. It acts equally in all directions and tends
either to collapse the walls of the duct upstream from the fan
or to expand the walls of the duct on the downstream side.
SP usually is negative in sign upstream from a fan and posi￾tive downstream. It is measured as the difference between
duct and atmospheric pressures. The most common unit of

SP in the USA is “inches of water” (“in.w.g. H2O”). The
standard barometric pressure (or atmospheric SP) is about
407 in.w.g.
2.5 Total Pressure
The driving force for the airflow is a pressure difference that
is required to start and maintain flow. This pressure is called
total pressure (TP) and has two components, VP and SP; the
relationship among the three is simply
TP = SP + VP or SP = TP − VP or VP = TP − SP (5)
Normal Sign Convention: Upstream of the fan, TP and SP
are negative, VP is positive; downstream of fan, all pressures
are considered positive.
Figure 1 shows the relationships between SP, VP, and TP
at different points in a duct system. Note that the manometer
measurements are downstream of the fan.
If air flowing through a duct system undergoes an increase
in velocity, a part of the available SP is used to create
the additional VP necessary to accelerate the flowing air.
Conversely, if the velocity is reduced at some point in a duct
system, a portion of the kinetic energy or VP at that point
can be converted into potential energy or SP. SP and VP are
therefore mutually convertible. However, this conversion is
always accompanied by a loss of SP due to turbulence and
shock; the conversion is never 100% efficient.
2.6 Static Pressure (Energy) Losses
Air in motion encounters resistance at all surfaces encoun￾tered by the flowing volume of air. Consequently, some of
the SP (energy) of the air is given up in overcoming this fric￾tion and is transformed into heat. The rougher the surface
confining the flow or the higher the flow rate, the higher the
frictional losses.
Frictional loss in a duct varies directly with the length,
inversely with the diameter, and directly with the square of
the velocity of air flowing through the duct. This loss can be
estimate from charts using the Fanning friction factor, which
is an empirical function of Reynolds number, duct material,
and type of construction (4).
SP also is lost due to turbulence caused by a change in
direction or velocity within a duct. The “pressure drop” in a
duct system due to dynamic losses increases with the number
of elbows or angles and the number of velocity changes
within the system.
Acceleration and hood-entrance loss is a drop in (or loss
of) SP caused by turbulence when air is accelerated from rest
to enter a duct or opening. Turbulence losses of this type vary
with the type of opening.
The SP loss is most often estimated by its relationship
to VP:
SPloss = K ⋅ VP ⋅ d (6)
where SPloss is the loss of SP (in.w.g. or mmw.g.), K is a
unitless loss factor determined experimentally for every type
of fitting in a system, VP is the average velocity pressure
in duct (in.w.g. or mmw.g.), and d is the density correction
factor, unitless.
Sample Calculation. Suppose air is flowing in a duct
system at an average VP of VP=0.90 in.w.g. at STP. The
air moves through an elbow with a published loss factor,
K=0.28. What is the approximate loss of SP through the
elbow?
SPloss = K ⋅ VP ⋅ d = 0.28 × 0.90 in.w.g. × 1.0 = 0.25 in.w.g.
3 LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION
LEV controls an emitted air contaminant by capturing it at or
near the place where it is generated and removing it from the
workspace. The intent is to capture or contain as much of the
emitted contaminant as possible but no hood is completely
effective in practice. “Fugitive emissions” (those that escape
capture at the hood) are controlled using dilution ventilation
or some other means of control, as warranted. The makeup
air for the hood exhaust often serves this purpose when
designed to do so.
An LEV system usually includes all of the following
components: a hood or enclosure, ductwork, an air￾cleaning device (where necessary for air pollution abatement
purposes), an air-moving device (usually an exhaust fan),
and a stack to safely disperse any contaminants in the
airstream (Figure 2). In general, LEV systems consist of
more individual components than do dilution ventilation
systems, and because they also offer more operational
parameters that must be controlled within acceptable ranges,
they require more maintenance and involve higher operating
expenses as well.
When the primary purpose of ventilation is to provide
control of airborne contaminants, LEV systems are generally

superior to dilution ventilation. The advantages of the LEV
system over a dilution system for any particular application
will include many of the following:
• Capture and control of a contaminant can be very
effect, given proper design and operation of the system.
Consequently, the exposure of workers to contaminants
at the sources exhausted can be prevented. With dilu￾tion ventilation the contaminant is controlled at the
breathing zone (BZ), and at any given location in the
workplace this dilution may be highly variable and
therefore inadequate at times.
• Volumetric rates of required LEV exhaust air are less
with local ventilation; as a result, the volume of makeup
air is less. LEV control offers savings in both capital
investment and heating costs.
• The contaminant is contained in a smaller exhausted
volume of air. Therefore if air pollution control is
needed, it is less expensive because the cost of air pollu￾tion control is approximately proportional to the volume
of air handled.
• With particulate contaminants, LEV systems can be
designed to capture large, settleable particles or at least
confine them within the hood, and thus reduce the effort
needed for good housekeeping.
• Equipment and exposed surfaces in the workroom are
better protected from such deleterious effects of the
contaminant as corrosion and abrasion.
• Fans used with LEV systems usually have fairly high
pressure characteristics to overcome pressure losses
in the system. Therefore, the performance of the fan
system is not likely to be affected adversely by such
influences as wind direction or velocity or inadequate
makeup air. This is in contrast to dilution ventilation,
which can be affected greatly by seasonal factors.
3.1 Individual Components of an LEV
System
3.1.1 Hoods
A hood is a structure designed to partially enclose a
contaminant-producing operation or to guide airflow in an
efficient manner to capture and contain the contaminant. The
design and location of the hood is one of the most critical
aspects in the successful operation of a local exhaust system.
3.1.2 Ductwork
The ductwork in an exhaust system provides a path for flow
of the contaminated air exhausted from the hood to the point
of discharge. It also carries SP from the fan to the hood where
airflow is generated. The following points are important in
design and operation of the ductwork:
• All duct velocities in industrial ventilation systems must
be high enough to prevent any particles or dust in the
airstream in each duct from settling out and plugging
the duct.
• When the airstream is dust free, e.g. consisting only
of dust or particles naturally found in the air, the duct
velocity can strike an economic balance between duct￾work cost and fan, motor, and power costs. Many
users have found a duct velocity of 1500–2000 fpm is
optimal.
• Recommended duct “dust transport” velocities for
various dust conditions can be found in (1–3, 5). For
example, air in a duct contaminated with “fine powder
coal dust” should be maintained at a velocity of
4000 fpm, or more (2).
• Location and construction of the ductwork must furnish
sufficient protection against external damage, corro￾sion, and erosion to maximize the useful life of the local
exhaust system.
3.1.3 Air Cleaners
Most exhaust systems installed for contaminant control
require an air cleaner. Occasionally the collected material
has some economic reuse value. Much of the time, obtaining
an emissions permit from the local air pollution control
authority will require installing an air cleaner.
3.1.4 Fans
The fan, usually of a centrifugal type, is the heart of the LEV
system. Wherever practicable, a fan should be placed down￾stream from the air cleaner so that it will handle uncontami￾nated air. When chips and other particulate matter must pass
through the impeller, the straight blade or paddlewheel-type
202INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION
fan is best because it is least likely to clog. Fans and motors
should be mounted on substantial platforms or bases and
isolated by antivibration mounts. At the fan inlet and outlet,
the main duct should attach through a vibration isolator, that
is a sleeve or band of very flexible material, such as rubber
or fabric. The vibration isolator at the fan inlet should be
mounted on the outside of the duct.
The importance and interaction of the various components
of the exhaust system will become evident in the discus￾sion on design of a ventilation system later in this chapter.
Because of the importance of the role played by the exhaust
hood in the overall success of the ventilation system, and
because it is the component of the system that typically
permits most innovation in concept, specific discussion of
the application of the various types of hood follows below.
3.1.5 Stacks
The stack should be tall enough (usually about 10 ft above the
highest ridge of the roof line or air intakes) and far enough
away from air intakes (usually 50 ft or more) to minimize
re-entrainment of contaminated air into the building.
3.2 LEV Hood Types
The “hood” is the point at which air first enters the LEV
system. As such, the term can be used to apply to any opening
in the exhaust system regardless of its shape or physical
disposition. An open-ended section of ductwork, a canopy￾type hood situated above a hot process, and a conventional
laboratory booth-type hood all could be called hoods in the
context of this discussion.
The hood captures or contains the contaminant generated
by a process or operation and causes it to be carried through
the ductwork to a convenient discharge point. The quantity
of air required to contain or capture the air contaminants
depends on the size and shape of the hood, its position
relative to the point of generation of the contaminant, and the
nature and quantity of the air contaminant itself. It should be
emphasized that there is not necessarily a standard hood that
is correct for all applications of a particular operation because
the methods of processing are unique to each operating plant.
On the other hand, standard concepts for exhaust hoods
have been developed and recommended for many types of
operations (1–3).
Hoods can be classified conveniently into four categories,
based on the concept of contaminant capture/control: enclo￾sures, booth-type hoods, receiving hoods, and capture or
exterior hoods.
3.2.1 Enclosure Hoods
Enclosure hoods normally surround the points of emission or
generation of contaminant as much as practicable. In essence,
they surround the contaminant source to such a degree that all
contaminant-dispersal action takes place within the confines
of the hood itself. Because of this, enclosure hoods generally
require the lowest rates of exhaust ventilation, and therefore
are economical and quite efficient. They should be used
whenever possible, and they deserve primary consideration
when a moderately or highly toxic contaminant is involved.
Capture hoods can often be made closer to enclosing hoods
by the judicious use of flanges.
3.2.2 Booth-Type Hoods
The laboratory hood and spray-painting booths are special
cases of enclosure type hoods where the worker is located at
or in the hood itself. Air contamination takes place within the
enclosure, and air is exhausted from it in such a way, and at
such a rate, that an average velocity is induced across the
hood openings sufficient to overcome the tendency of the
contaminant to escape from within the hood. The five (or
more) walls of the booth reduce the exhaust air requirements,
although not to the extent of a total enclosure.
3.2.3 Capture or Exterior Hoods
Exterior hoods must capture air contaminants generated from
a point outside the hood itself. Exterior hoods therefore
differ from enclosure or receiving hoods in that their sphere
of influence must extend beyond their own dimensions in
capturing contaminants without the aid of natural forces
such as natural drafts, buoyancy, and inertia. In other words,
directional air currents must be established adjacent to the
suction opening of the hood to provide adequate capture at
the emission source. Thus, they are quite sensitive to external
sources of air disturbance and may be rendered completely
ineffective by even competing lateral movements of air. They
also require more air to control a given process and are
the more difficult of the various hoods to design. Examples
of exterior hoods include the exhaust slots on the edges of
liquid tanks, the tapered capture hood at a welding station,
and exhaust grilles in the floor or workbench below a air￾contaminated process.
3.2.4 Receiving Hoods
The term “receiving” refers to a hood in which a stream
of contaminated air from a process is exhausted by a hood
located near the source of generation of the contaminants
specifically for purposes of control. Two examples of this
type of hood are canopies situated above hot processes and
hoods attached to grinders, positioned to take advantage of
centrifugal and gravitational forces to maximize control of
the dust generated by the process. Canopy hoods, frequently
located above hot processes, are similar to exterior hoods
in that the contaminated air originates beyond the physical
203PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
boundaries of the hood. The fundamental difference between
receiving and exterior hoods is that in the former, the hood
takes advantage of the natural movement of the released
contaminant, whereas in the latter, air is induced to move
toward the exterior hood. Receiving hoods are not considered
capture hoods.
Receiving hoods are designed to be in the natural pathway
of the contaminant as it is normally released by the operation.
If space is limited, baffles or shields may be placed across the
line of throw of the particles to remove their kinetic energy.
Then the particles may be captured and carried into the hood
by lower air velocities. Additional examples of receiving
hoods include those associated with many hand-tool oper￾ations (surface grinders, metal polishers, stone cutters, and
sanding machines).
3.3 Factors Influencing the Performance
of LEV Systems
Control of air contaminants through LEV will be more effec￾tive if the following basic factors and principles are under￾stood and followed.
3.3.1 Capture/Control Velocities
Hoods perform their function in one of two ways: capture or
control. With the capture approach, air movement is created
to draw the contaminant into the hood. When the air velocity
that accomplishes this objective is created at a point outside
a nonenclosing hood, it is called capture velocity. Some
exhaust hoods essentially enclose the contaminant source
and create an air movement that prevents the contaminant
from escaping from the enclosure. The air velocity created at
the openings of such hoods is called the control velocity.
Successful design of any exhaust hood is based on correct
determination of the two quantities, control velocity and
capture velocity. The air velocity, which must be developed
by the exhaust hood at the point of emission or in the area of
desired control, is based on the magnitude and direction of
the air motion to be. Some empirical ventilation standards,
especially concerning dusty equipment such as screens and
conveyor belt crossovers, are based on parameters such as
“cubic feet per minute per foot of belt width.” These so￾called exhaust-rate standards are usually based on successful
experience, are easily applied, and usually give satisfactory
results if not extrapolated too far. In addition, they minimize
the effort and uncertainty involved in calculating the fan
action of falling material, thermal forces within hoods, and
external-air currents. However, such standards have three
major pitfalls:
• They are not of a fundamental nature; that is they do not
follow directly from basic “laws.”
• They presuppose a certain minimum quality of hood
or enclosure design, although it may not be possible or
practical to achieve the same quality of hood design in
a new installation.
• They are valid only for circumstances similar to those
that led to their development and use. It should be clear
that the nature of the process generating the contami￾nant will be an important determinant of the required
capture velocity.
3.3.2 Airflow Characteristics at a Capture Hood
The flow characteristics at a hood opening are much different
from the flow pattern at a supply or discharge opening.
Air blown from an opening maintains its directional effect
in a fashion similar to water squirting from a hose and,
in fact, is so pronounced that it is often called “throw.”
However, if the flow of air through the same opening is
changed so that the opening operates as an exhaust or intake
with the same volumetric rate of airflow, the flow becomes
almost completely nondirectional, and its range of influ￾ence is greatly reduced. As a first approximation, when air
is blown from a small opening, the velocity 30 diameters
in front of the plane of the opening is about 10% of the
velocity at the discharge. The same reduction in velocity is
achieved at a much smaller distance in the case of exhausted
openings, such that the velocity equals 10% of the face
velocity at a distance of as little as 1 diameter from the
exhaust opening (Figure 3 illustrates this point). Therefore,
local exhaust hoods should not be applied to any operation
that cannot be conducted in the immediate vicinity of the
capture hood.
Required airflows into a hood are described by a theo￾retical “area” approach (Section 3.3.3), and by empirical
approaches not covered here (see American Conference
of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and Committee on
Industrial Ventilation (1) for more information on empirical
approaches).
3.3.3 Determining Airflow Rates into Hoods Using
Q = VA
Required airflow rates into hoods have been well described
by Hemeon (3). His theoretical “area” approach to airflow
into hoods is based on the fundamental equation Q =VA.
To determine the appropriate airflow rate, Q, one needs to
determine the appropriate capture or control velocity along
some area of approach to the hood. See Figure 4 for typical
areas. For an enclosing, booth-type hood, for example the
area is a plane and the velocity is the average desired face
velocity through the plane. For an ideal round capture hood
with the emission source located in front of the hood, such
as the end of a flex duct placed over a box, there is a point
source of “suction” just inside the duct that “draws” air from

all directions equidistant from the point. The approach area
is approximately a sphere and the velocity is the average
desired capture velocity along the surface area of the sphere.
In this case,
Q = VA
where A= 4𝜋X2 and
Q = V(12.57X2)
where Q is the airflow (ft3 min−1 or m3 s−1), V is the desired
capture velocity at point X (fpm or m s−1), and X is the
centerline distance to emission source (ft or m).
Similar areas can be determined for almost all hoods, as
shown in Figure 4. When the width-to-length ratio (aspect
ratio) of an exhaust opening approaches 0.1, the opening
behaves like a slot, for example. The approach area to a free￾standing slot is like a cylinder.
Note also that if Q is known, an estimate of the capture
velocity at a free-standing slot can be made by solving for V:

3.3.4 Hood-Related Equations
Like all fittings, there is a SP loss as air flows through a hood
and into the duct. This “hood entry loss” is given by
he = SPloss = Kh ⋅ VP ⋅ d (7)
where “he =SPloss” is the loss of SP at the hood (entering
the duct from the hood) (in.w.g. or mmw.g.), Kh is a loss
factor determined experimentally for every type of hood,
VP is the average velocity pressure in duct serving hood
(in.w.g. or mmw.g.), and d is the density correction factor,
unitless.
The entry loss plus the acceleration energy required to
move the air at a given velocity (1 VP) make up the hood-SP
SPh, which is expressed algebraically as
SPh = he + VP and he = SPh − VP (8)
where he is hood-entry loss. SPh is often measured a short
distance downstream from the hood entrance using a pitot
tube. The calculation (or measurement) of SPh is often the
first step in the design (or evaluation) of a LEV system, which
will be discussed later. When using this equation, let SPh be
the absolute value (let the sign of SPh be +).
The coefficient of entry, Ce, is a measure of how efficiently
a hood is able to convert SP to VP as the air moves through
the hood into and down the duct. The coefficient of entry is
the ratio of rate of flow by the hood-SP to the theoretical flow
if the hood-SP were completely converted to VP. Ce ranges
from 0 to 1 and is unitless.
Ce =
√ VP
SPh
(9)
where Ce is the coefficient of entry, unitless, VP is the
average velocity pressure in duct serving hood (in.w.g. or
mmw.g.), and SPh is the absolute value (sign= +) of the SP
in the duct serving hood (in.w.g. or mmw.g.).
Combining several equations, the airflow rate can be
determined from the duct diameter, hood SP, and the coef￾ficient of entry:
Q = 4005ACe
√SPh∕d for US
Q = 4.043ACe
√SPh∕d for SI (10)
where Ce is the coefficient of entry, unitless; A is the cross￾sectional area of duct (ft2 or m2); Q is the air volume flow
rate (acfm or acms); SPh is the absolute value (sign= +) SP
in duct serving hood (in.w.g. or mmw.g.); and d is the density
correction factor, unitless.
Sample Calculation Using Hood Equations. Suppose
an IH measures the average VP and SP using a pitot
tube and manometer just downstream in the duct from a
welding hood.
These are data: VP=0.75 in.w.g., SP= −1.40 in.w.g.,
duct diameter=12 in., duct area=0.7854 ft2, air at STP, and
d=1.0.
In this case
SPh = 1.40in.w.g. (The absolute value of the static
pressure near the hood in the duct.)
he = SPh − VP = 1.40 − 0.75 = 0.65 in.w.g.
Ce =
√ VP
SPh
=
√0.75
1.40 = 0.73
Q = 4005ACe
√SPh∕d
= Q = 4005 × 0.7854 × 0.73√1.40∕1.0 = 2700 scfm
3.3.5 Effects of Flanging
Flanges surrounding a capture hood opening force air to flow
mostly from the zone directly in front of the hood. Thus, the
addition of a flange to a capture hood improves the efficiency
of capture and control, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.
3.3.6 Air Distribution in the Face of Enclosing Hoods
To provide adequate control of emissions in an enclosing
hood, the airflow across the face of a hood should be fairly
uniform throughout its cross section. One method to assure
uniformity is to provide slots at the back of the hood with a
low velocity plenum behind the slots, or large-area chamber
behind it, for example in large, shallow hoods, such as paint￾spray booths, laboratory hoods, and draft-shakeout hoods.
These are called compound hoods because they require two
accelerations (one at the slot, another at the duct) and two
losses (one at the slot and one at the duct entry).
As mentioned in Section 3.3.4, the hood SP, SPh, repre￾sents the energy needed to accelerate the air from ambient
velocity (often near zero) outside the hood, through the hood,
and to the duct velocity, and also to overcome the frictional
SP losses resulting from turbulence of the air upon entering
the hood and ductwork. Equations (6) and (7) described
this action.
However, for slotted, plenum, or compound hoods there
are two entry losses, one through the slot and the other into
the duct. There are two accelerations, one at the slot and one
into the duct from the plenum. For a slotted compound hood,

FIGURE 5 Velocity contours for unflanged circular opening.
Eqs. (6) and (7) can be combined to form:
SPh = Kslot ⋅ VPslot ⋅ d + Kh ⋅ VPduct ⋅ d + VPslot + VPduct
(11)
In some rare cases, the VP resulting from acceleration
through the slot is not all lost in the plenum but it is best not to
assume this. In most cases the slot VP is lost (crashing against
the back wall of the plenum). Velocities in the plenum are
usually so low that the velocity in the plenum can be ignored.
3.3.7 Enclosure of the Emission Source
Any operation to be exhausted by local ventilation should
be enclosed as much as possible. This generally provides
better control per unit volume of air exhausted. Nevertheless,
the requirements the process and of adequate access to the
process must always be considered. An enclosed process
may be costly in terms of operating efficiency or capital
expenditure, but the savings gained by exhausting smaller air
volumes may make the enclosure worthwhile.
Where materials flow into an air exhausted enclosure (like
a bin equipped with an exhaust duct that is being filled with
falling sand), one must take into account the induced airflow
into the bin by the moving materials. Design and actual
exhaust pressures and airflow rates should be adjusted, as
needed (3).
3.3.8 Capture of Contaminants
The velocity of air through all openings must be high enough
not only to contain the contaminant but also to remove
the contaminant from the hood. The importance of optimal
capture and control velocity was discussed in the preceding
sections.
3.3.9 Keeping Contaminants Out of Breathing Zone
Hoods that do not completely enclose the process should
be located as near to the point of contaminant generation
as possible. Airflow should be provided in a direction away
from the worker toward the contaminant source.
3.3.10 Providing Makeup Air
In order to keep the building from operating under negative
pressure, all air exhausted from a building or enclosure must
be replaced. This applies to local exhaust systems as well
as dilution systems. Additionally, the incoming air must be
tempered by a makeup-air system before being distributed
inside the process area. Without sufficient makeup air,
exhaust-ventilation systems cannot work as efficiently as
intended. Makeup-air requirements are discussed below.
3.3.11 Low Volume High Velocity Exhaust Systems
A unique application of the fundamentals of the LEV funda￾mentals discussed in this chapter have been applied in a
unique way in what is referred to as low volume high velocity
(LVHV) exhaust ventilation. With typical application of this
approach, small volumes of air at relatively high velocities
are used to control dust generated by portable hand tools
and machining operations. Control is achieved by exhausting
the air essentially at the point of generation by means of
close-fitting, custom-designed hoods. To maximize the flexi￾bility required by operators of the equipment, flexible, small￾diameter, lightweight plastic hoses are used, being built into
the overall design of the tool. Figure 6 illustrates a typical
application for control of dust generated by a disk sander.
The capture velocities in these situations are high; slot veloc￾ities typically are in excess of 20 000 linear fpm. However,
because of the short distances required for capture of the dust
and the small-diameter tubing (ductwork) associated with the
system, the total airflow rate is low.
Although this technique does not have widespread appli￾cability, there are situations for which it has optimized
control of dust. Successful use of LVHV exhaust venti￾lation has been made in such diverse activities as rock
drilling, conventional machining, machining of beryllium,
wood sanding, metal-surface grinding, pneumatic chip￾ping, internal-surface grinding, and chiseling. Development
of these exhaust systems has been somewhat empirical.

However, proper design of such systems requires the same
careful, deliberate consideration of ventilation principles as
more conventional-exhaust systems.
3.3.12 Duct Velocities
As discussed in Section 3.1.2, in order to prevent particles
of dust and fumes from settling and plugging ductwork, air
velocities for transporting these materials must be relatively
high. The minimum velocity, called transport or scrubbing
velocity, typically is 3500–4500 linear fpm. At these veloc￾ities, frictional loss from air moving along the surface of
the ducts becomes significant; therefore, all fittings, such
as elbows and branches, should be wide-swept and gradual,
having smooth interior surfaces.
Local exhaust systems used exclusively for clean air,
gases and vapors may have lower duct velocities (e.g.
2000 fpm) because there is likely to be nothing to settle
and plug the ducts. Lower velocities markedly reduce the
frictional and pressure losses against which the fan must
operate, thereby realizing a saving in power cost for the
same airflow.
If there is (or there is a chance of) condensation (of water
or chemical vapors) in the ductwork, or if the air carries
small liquid particles, the ductwork can to sloped to drain
any condensed and settled fluid.
If condensable vapors and solid particles are both present
in the exhaust air, the ductwork can be heated or insulated
to prevent condensation and the mixing of settled particles
and fluid to create “mud.” If these conditions exist or could
exist, always provide cleanout ports on the top for ducts and
provide for period duct cleaning.
4 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DESIGN
OF NEW LEV SYSTEMS
Specific design methods for LEV systems are presented in a
number of texts (1–3, 5–7). An important predesign phase,
known as problem characterization, is frequently given little
attention (Table 1). This is a topic that can be best addressed
by an industrial hygienist who can provide data on emissions,
air patterns, and worker movement and actions.
If the process is new, information from a similar oper￾ation with the same unit operations may be available. If
the facility is a duplicate of one in the company the indus￾trial hygienist should visit the operation with the ventilation
designer. Frequently, the designer is an outside contractor.

208INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION
In this case it is important that the problem characteriza￾tion approach be followed, and an information package be
provided the designer.
A few cautions are appropriate for the use of available
design data. The ACGIH Industrial Ventilation Manual
provides the most comprehensive selection of design criteria
for general industry (1). Each of the “VS Prints” found
in Chapter 13 (29th Edition) provides four specific design
elements: hood geometry, airflow rate, minimum duct
velocity, and entry loss. A missing element is the perfor￾mance of the hood in terms of percent containment or
capture efficiency, which varies with the application and
usage.
LEV system design approaches include manual designs,
computer-aided designs (CAD), and computational fluid
mechanics (CFD). CAD programs for LEV systems can help
provide detailed engineering design of LEV systems. CFD
is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical anal￾ysis to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows.
Computers are used to perform calculations to simulate the
interaction of air and its components with surfaces associ￾ated by boundary conditions. Unfortunately, CAD and CFD
programs dedicated specifically to LEV system design are
few and sometimes not suitable for the functions and intents
of unique tailored LEV systems. In this chapter, we explore
the manual or traditional approaches, which help the designer
and the LEV system owner to better understand what is actu￾ally occurring in the system and to better tailor the system to
the actual environmental conditions.
As noted, several different traditional approaches to the
design of the LEV system are available to the IH and engi￾neer. However, they all consist of a series of similar steps.
The following paragraphs briefly summarize the typical
sequential procedure used in the initial design of LEV
systems. The example provides a typical procedure for the
design at STP of a two-hooded duct system into a fan.
1. Prepare a sketch of the layout of the workroom and
the operations within it. This will facilitate prepa￾ration plans and specifications for the layout of the
contemplated exhaust system. Although it is helpful
if the layout is approximately to scale, subsequent
steps in the procedure, such as calculating proper duct
sizes, can be accomplished from even a very simple
drawing. For purposes of illustration, consider the
design of an LEV system serving a manual grinding
station and a welding operation within the same
general work area. The concept sketch for the ventila￾tion system to provide control of contaminants at these
operations is illustrated in Figure 7.
2. Find in the literature or design a hood for each oper￾ation. The type of hood should be selected with the
idea of performing the job with the least amount of
exhaust air. This requires some ingenuity in designing

enclosures that will not interfere with production; they
may be equipped with movable sections. There may
be a standard hood available for a particular applica￾tion, such as found in (1). For convenience, we will
use the hoods shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively,
which depict the configuration and design parameters
for these hoods (1). Figure 10 shows the proposed
layout.
3. Estimate the required control or capture velocity for
each operation and type of hood. This part of the
process involves some judgment, particularly with
hoods of nonstandard design. For this illustration,
the information presented in Figures 8 and 9 can be
used in making preliminary estimates of appropriate
velocities and volumetric-flow rates. Accordingly, an
airflow rate of 200 cfm per square foot of bench area
for the grinding table and a slot velocity of 1000
(linear) fpm for the welding bench is selected.
4. Estimate or compute the sphere of influence over
which the selected capture velocities must function.
It will be advantageous to consider the hood arrange￾ments in three dimensions. In the sample calculation,
assume that work at both the grinding table and the
welding bench will be conducted on a flat surface
2 × 4 ft and that most of the work will be conducted
within 2 in. of the table surface.
5. Determine the total volumetric airflow needed
for each hood. From the information supplied in
Figures 8 and 9, the required volumetric airflows for
the two hoods can be calculated. For this example,
a volumetric-flow rate of 200 ft3 (min ft2)
−1 of work
surface and a bench area of 8 ft2 have been assumed.
Thus, a volumetric-flow rate of 1600 ft3 min−1 will
be required for hood A, the grinding table. For the
welding bench, the required volumetric rate will be
350 ft3 min−1 per linear foot of hood times 4 ft (the
length of the hood), or a total of 1400 ft3 min−1.

6. Select the minimum transport velocities for the
contaminant-laden air being moved through the
ductwork. Velocities in the range of 2000–2500
linear fpm are commonly used for gases and vapors
(although keep in mind that no air is “dust free”). The
recommended transport velocities of Figures 8 and 9
suggest minimum values of 3500 and 2000 linear fpm
for ductwork servicing the grinding table and welding
bench hoods, respectively. This is a designer choice,
however, and transport velocities should be selected
based on the conditions at the operation. In our case,
let us assume that the transport velocity in the duct
serving the welding hood should be about 3500 fpm;
for the grinding hood, 4000 fpm.
7. Determine the nearest practical duct diameter neces￾sary to carry the required volumetric rate of air at
the proper velocity. It is usual to choose standard
sizes of ducts available from the fabricator to avoid
the unnecessary expense of special fabrication. The
actual transport velocity should be computed for
use in subsequent design steps. In the example
problem, using Eq. (2), and assuming that stan￾dard ductwork is available in full-inch diameter
increments only, the duct diameter nearest to the
calculated necessary diameters is 8 in. for both
the grinding table and the welding bench. Using
8 in. diameter ductwork for these hoods would
produce transport velocities of 4580 and 4010 linear
fpm for the grinding hood and welding hood, for
example.
8. Compute the VPs corresponding to air velocities in
each duct connected to a hood. VPs can be calculated

the example problem, these equations are also given
in Figures 8 and 9. Hood entry loss factors (Kh)
are also available in other references. In this case,
he =0.25 × 1.30 in.=0.335 in.w.g. and SPh =1.30 ×
0.335 in.=1.63 in.w.g.
10. Estimate the hood SP, SPh, for both hoods, using
information developed in steps 8 and 9, and using
Eqs. (8) and (11).
11. Estimate SP losses in elbows, branch-to-main junc￾tions, and all other fittings in the duct system using
Eq. (6). Loss factors (K) are available for a wide
range of ducts and duct fittings (1–3). For this sample
problem, refer again to Figure 10 for the relative
arrangement of equipment in the exhaust system. Note
that Branches 1 and 2 contain two 90∘ elbows, the
centerline radius of the elbow turns is twice the duct
diameter, Branch 2 merges with the main duct on a
45∘ angle of entry, and Duct section 4 contains one
90∘ elbow also with a centerline radius of 2 diameters.
12. Obtain the duct-friction losses from an appropriate
chart, table, or formula. A friction chart like the one
illustrated in Figure 11 can be used. For the various
sections of ductwork associated with the example
problem, the following friction losses can be derived
by referring to Figure 9:
Duct section 1 4.0 in.w.g. per 100 ft of duct
Duct section 2 2.9 in.w.g. per 100 ft of duct
13. Sum the accelerations and the losses for each branch
up to the junction. The total SP demand from each
hood to the junction should be about the same if
cost-effective balance is to be achieved. Increase or
decrease duct sizes to make the SP demand in both
duct runs about equal at the junction. Now estimate
the actual flow rate in each duct for the SP at the
junction for the larger (the “governing”) of the two
SP demands. For the illustration, let us assume that
the governing SP= −1.90 in.w.g.
14. Moving from the junction to the fan, add the SP losses
of all additional fittings and accessory equipment such
as air cleaners. In many cases, this information can
be obtained directly from the manufacturers. For this
example, assume that the pressure drop across the dust
collector is 2.0 in H2O.
15. Follow the same procedure for the stack or ductwork
downstream of the fan. Then add all the SP losses into
and out of the fan. Assume for this sample calculation
that SPin =5.50 in.w.g. and SPout =0.5 in.w.g. and that
the VPs in and out of the fan are equal.
16. Select a fan of proper type, size, and speed to produce
the highest operating efficiency, or lowest horsepower,
consistent with other considerations. Use the calcu￾lated total airflow in cubic feet per minute (Q; about
3000 cfm) and the total system SP required (SP; about
6.0 w.g.) for fan selection purposes. When selecting a
fan, it is necessary to be familiar with the fan laws
and system curves, that is how the SP and volumetric
airflow are related. A fan curve or system curve shows
graphically the possible combinations of volumetric

flow and SP for a given application. Because the fan
and system each can operate only at a single point on
its own curve, the combination can operate only where
these curves intersect (Figure 12). Thus, a fan must
be chosen on the basis of its characteristics and the
requirements of the system in which it will be applied.
Each fan is characterized by the volume of air flow, the
pressure at which the flow is produced, the speed of
rotation, the power required, and the efficiency. These
quantities are measured by manufacturers with stan￾dard testing methods, and the results are plotted to
furnish characteristic “fan curves” or “fan tables” (2).
During design, one must consider potential leakage
of air into the LEV system. (Leakage robs air from
the hood where emission sources must be controlled.)
Sometimes even “sealed ducts” can leak up to 5% of
the total airflow and air cleaners might leak as much
as 10–15% of the total air reaching the fan if they
are not well maintained. Check with your duct and air
cleaner suppliers for estimates of air leakage in their
equipment when selecting the fan and motor operating
specifications.
All LEV system design approaches essentially follow
these 16 steps, with simplifications or complexity added,
depending on the system (1–3, 5, 6).
4.1 Ventilation Regulations and Standards
4.1.1 OSHA Codes
Some types of ventilation, both dilution and local exhaust,
are covered by occupational safety and health regulations.
Older federal standards, e.g. those established by the Occu￾pational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), include
specific ventilation requirements for the major applications
identified in Table 2.

standards which include ventilation requirements.

In addition to the references to ventilation requirements
in these codes, many occupational health standards for
specific substances, for example benzene, ethylene oxide,
formaldehyde, and lead, incorporate language clearly
meant to include ventilation considerations. In many
OSHA health standards there is a section titled “Methods
of Compliance,” which contains a statement implying
that the employer must institute engineering controls
and work practices to reduce and maintain employee
exposure to or below the Permissible Exposure Limit
(PEL)-Time-Weighted Average (TWA), except to the extent
that such controls are not feasible. It is inconceivable
that such engineering controls would not rely heavily on
ventilation.
For the most part, the ventilation requirements incorpo￾rated into OSHA standards are based on consensus-type
standards developed by organizations such as the Amer￾ican National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National
Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Although the past
few decades have not seen much regulatory activity
regarding ventilation requirements, the number and degree
of specificity of ventilation standards may increase in the
future.
Many of the occupational health standards being devel￾oped by OSHA are couched in language that makes it
clear that engineering control of the specific contaminants
covered by the standard is the primary responsibility of the
employer. In fact, engineering controls (chiefly ventilation in
the case of airborne contaminants) should be applied to the
214INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION
extent feasible even if they are not sufficient by themselves
to reduce the airborne concentration of the contaminant
to the specified acceptable level. Thus, in addition to the
occupational health standards dealing with specific aspects
of ventilation, there are indirect references to the requirement
for installation of ventilation systems to maintain the work
environment within stated acceptable limits. Accordingly,
the need for application of sound engineering in the control
of workplace contaminants undoubtedly will continue to
increase.
4.2 ANSI Z9 Standards
Perhaps the most important standard related to industrial
ventilation is ANSI Z9.2-2018, Fundamentals Governing
the Design and Operation of Local Exhaust Systems (8). The
American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) is the Secre￾tariat of the Z9 Committee. The Z9 Committee develops,
manages and publishes 14 industrial ventilation standards
and guidelines covering open surface tanks, spray finishing,
abrasive blasting, lab ventilation, recirculation of exhaust
ventilation, confined spaces, dilution ventilation, O&M
maintenance, and others (9–11).
5 DILUTION VENTILATION
As suggested in Characterizing Air Contaminant Emis￾sion Sources, when enclosure or other forms of isolation
or substitution are not appropriate or have been used
to the practicable extent, the IH looks to LEV as the
primary-control measure. And if that is not feasible or
cost-effective, the IH will apply dilution ventilation.
It should be kept in mind that LEV systems are not
necessarily 100% efficient in capturing and controlling
contaminants released by a process. It is because of
this residual or background level of contamination that
dilution ventilation provisions are always included as a
complementary aspect of the total ventilation within a
plant.
As used in this chapter, the term dilution (or, general)
ventilation refers to the practice of supplying and exhausting
large volumes of air throughout a workspace. It is used typi￾cally in industry to achieve comfortable work conditions
(temperature and humidity control) and to dilute concentra￾tions of airborne contaminants to acceptable concentrations
throughout the workspace. When properly used, dilution
ventilation can be effective in removing large volumes of
heated air or relatively low concentrations of low toxicity
contaminants from several decentralized sources. Dilution
ventilation can be provided by either natural or mechan￾ical means; often the best overall result is obtained with
a combination of mechanical- and natural-air supply and
exhaust.
5.1 Natural Ventilation
Natural ventilation can be provided either by gravitational
forces, using thermal forces of convection primarily, or by
anemotive forces, created by differences in “wind pressure.”
These two natural forces operate together in most cases,
resulting in the natural displacement and infiltration of air
through windows, doors, walls, floors, and other openings
in an industrial building. Unfortunately, the wind currents
and thermal-convection profiles on which natural ventilation
depends are erratic and frequently unpredictable. Thus, it
is perhaps a misnomer to refer to natural ventilation as a
“control” method, because to employ this technique requires
dependence on, rather than control of, natural forces.
There are some good applications for natural ventilation.
The pressure exerted on the upwind side and concurrent
suction exerted on the downwind side of a building as a
result of wind movement can be predicted for flat terrain
fairly reliably. Thus, the wind forces exerted on an isolated
building in a relatively flat area permit the prediction of
natural ventilation forces. In the more common complex
industrial building, however, the effects of the presence of
one building on the others normally cannot be calculated;
thus, the use of wind-pressure models in the development of
general ventilation systems is not feasible.
The impact and effectiveness of natural ventilation
provided to a building depend both on the wind pressure
profiles and on the thermal effects occurring within the
structure. The warmer inside air tends to rise and leave the
building through any available openings in the upper struc￾ture; cooler air tends to infiltrate the building by the reverse
process in the lower structure. These thermal effects, which
are much more predictable than the external wind forces,
can be useful in design of a general ventilation scheme (5).
5.2 Mechanically Controlled Ventilation
A modern industrial complex characterized by a low profile
building structure (i.e. large floor space, low height) as well
as multistory buildings of masonry and glass construction
present ventilation problems that were not found among
older industrial plants. For the most part industrial facil￾ities constructed 40–50 years ago incorporated by design
many features that relied upon natural ventilation of the
workspace. By contrast, modern buildings generally avoid
natural-ventilation and mechanical ventilation must be relied
upon almost completely. Mechanical-ventilation systems
exhaust contaminated air by mechanical means (exhaust
fans) with the concomitant use of appropriate air supply to
replace the exhausted air. The best method of achieving this
in modern closed buildings is to supply air through a system
of ductwork, distributing the air into the work areas in a
manner that will provide optimal benefit to the workers for
both comfort and control of contaminants.
215PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
5.3 Dilution Ventilation for Contaminant
Control
Dilution ventilation has as its primary function the main￾tenance of concentrations of airborne contaminants at
or below acceptable exposure limits, in terms of either
potential fire and explosion or occupational health consid￾erations. If enough clean air is mixed with contaminated
air, the concentration of the contaminant can be diluted
to any reasonable level. Of course, dilution ventilation
for purposes of fire and explosion control should not
be employed in areas occupied by workers because the
concentrations of concern from an occupational health
standpoint invariably are orders of magnitude below those
of concern for explosive limits. Exposures to atmospheres
controlled to concentrations below the lower explosive
limit or even a fraction thereof could cause narcosis, severe
illness, or even death. Therefore, it is extremely impor￾tant not to confuse dilution-ventilation requirements for
health-hazard control with those for fire and explosion
prevention.
When considering whether dilution ventilation is appro￾priate for health-hazard control, it should be remembered that
dilution ventilation has four limiting factors:
• The quantity of contaminant generated must not be
excessive, or the air volume necessary for dilution
would be prohibitively large.
• Workers should be far enough away from evolution
of the contaminant or the contaminant should be of
sufficiently low concentration, so the workers will not
be exposed to excessive levels.
• The toxicity of the contaminant should be relatively
low.
• The evolution or generation of the contaminant should
be reasonable, uniform, and consistent.
In practice, dilution ventilation for control of health
hazards is used to best advantage in controlling the concen￾tration of vapors from organic solvents of relatively low
toxicity. To apply the principle of dilution successfully to
such a problem, data must be available on the rate of vapor
generation or on the rate of liquid evaporation. Usually such
data can be obtained from the plant records on material
consumption.
5.4 Estimating Dilution Ventilation Volume
Flow Rates
The concentration of a gas or vapor at any time can be
expressed by a differential-material balance that, when inte￾grated, provides a rational basis for relating ventilation to the
generation and removal rates of a contaminant under various
conditions. Starting with a fundamental material balance, and
assuming no contaminant in the air supply, the following
relationship applies:
Rate of accumulation = rate of generation − rate of removal
This basic relationship can be applied in various ways. For
a specific concentration C, and uniform generation rate G,
G(t2 − t1) = Q′
C(t2 − t1)
Q′ = G
C
Q = KG
C
where G is the rate of generation of contaminant, Q is the rate
of ventilation, K is the design distribution constant, allowing
for incomplete mixing, C is the concentration under steady￾state conditions, V is the volume of room or enclosure, and
t is the time.
Therefore, the rate of flow of uncontaminated dilution
air required to reduce the atmospheric concentration of a
hazardous material to an acceptable level can be estimated if
the generation rate can be determined. For liquid solvents the
steady-state dilution ventilation requirement can be conve￾niently expressed as
Q = 387 × ER × K × 106
MW × Ca × d (12)
where Q is the actual ventilation rate (ft3 min−1), ER is the
evaporation rate of liquid (lb min−1), MW is the molecular
weight of liquid, K is the design factor for incomplete air
mixing at some location in the workspace, Ca is the accept￾able exposure concentration, usually some fraction of the
appropriate Occupational Exposure Level (OEL) (ppm), and
d is the air density correction factor.
Sample Calculation. What air volume flow rate is required
to dilute 0.5 gallons of toluene uniformly evaporated into
the workroom air in paint shop located in Salt Lake City,
Utah, during a painting process that takes 8 h? (MW =92.1;

Note: lb=gallon × 8.33 × SG =0.5 × 8.33 × 0.866=
3.607 lb and 8 h=480 min. ER=3.607 lb (480 min)−1 =

See Ref. (2) for additional sample calculations and appli￾cations.
216INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION
5.5 Dilution Ventilation Airflow Patterns
Dilution ventilation presents some disadvantages, the most
significant one being that it can permit the occupied space
to become, in effect, a large settling chamber for dusty
contaminants, even though the exposure concentration may
be within acceptable limits as far as potential health hazard
is concerned. In some rare cases, the settling or separation
of contaminants from the air may represent condensation of
materials that were vaporized by high temperature processes
and accumulated on surfaces after condensation. The unde￾sirability of the settling of contamination onto surfaces
within the plant has been dramatically demonstrated in plants
handling highly combustible dusts in which, although the
dust concentrations at any one time were not sufficient to
constitute a hazard, accumulation over many months resulted
in explosions. It is therefore necessary to maintain an effec￾tive ongoing good-housekeeping program in conjunction
with any broad-based engineering control such as general
ventilation.
The routes by which the air will enter and leave the
workspace are important considerations in the design of
general ventilation systems for a plant. The routes are of
critical concern not only to the occupants of the building but
potentially to the neighbors and the community at large. In
general, the relative locations of air inlets and outlets should
be considered in the implementation of a dilution ventilation
system.
5.5.1 Air Inlets
Sufficient combined or total-inlet area should be planned to
accommodate the required volume of makeup air. This will
prevent excessive inlet velocities that consume power, create
drafts on workers, stir up dust, and interfere with perfor￾mance of local exhaust systems. The chosen inlet velocity is
likely to represent an engineering compromise between low
velocities, which require large inlet areas, and higher rates,
which may facilitate rapid dilution of contaminants.
When widespread hazardous operations are controlled by
dilution ventilation, inlets should be well distributed around
the building to provide uniform circulation. If contaminants
are controlled by localized dilution or by forceful diffusion
into the general room-air reservoir, inlets may be purposely
located to give nonuniform air-supply distribution.
When using natural ventilation, any thermal or convec￾tion effects within the building should be taken advantage
of in locating air inlets. For this purpose, the designer must
avoid the location of inlets (and outlets) near the neutral zone
of inside–outside pressure differentials, which is approxi￾mately midway between the floor and roof. Inlets should
also be located remote from stacks or ventilators discharging
contaminants from the same or neighboring structures.
5.5.2 Air Exhausts and Outlets
Outlets should be located as far as possible from air inlets to
prevent short-circuiting. This advice holds for both natural￾and mechanical-ventilation systems.
If widely scattered operations are controlled by dilution
ventilation, outlets should be uniformly distributed around
the building. Similarly, if contaminants are controlled by
localized dilution, air outlets may be purposely located to
short-circuit a corner of a large room, with the intent of
creating a high rate of air change there without involving the
atmosphere of the entire space. This method of localized￾space ventilation requires a higher rate of exhaust air than
supply air within the area to be controlled to prevent the
spread of contaminants throughout the room.
Outlets, like inlets, should be placed to take full advantage
of thermal effects. They should be protected against the direct
force of prevailing winds, which reduce the capacity of any
exhaust fans or destroy the anticipated airflow route planned
based on thermal effects inside the building.
Preferably, dilution air should enter the workspace
at approximate breathing zone height, pass through the
workers’ breathing zone, then through the zone of contam￾ination; afterward, if it is not exhausted, it should enter a
space of higher relative contamination. A useful concept in
the interest of air-handling economy is progressive venti￾lation. The air removed from an industrial plant frequently
may be directed in a way that will provide both local and
dilution ventilation. In fact, the air may be routed through
several areas in succession, always in the direction of
increasing air contamination, as long as the exhaust from
one area is acceptable as the supply for the next. Progressive
ventilation saves energy in the form of airborne heat and
horsepower to move the air.
5.6 Which is More Appropriate, LEV or
Dilution Ventilation as a Primary
Control?
Table 3 shows a hierarchy of desired ventilation controls.
When technically feasible and cost-effective, approaches
higher in the table should be employed. Table 4 shows venti￾lation type selection criteria traditionally used by the IH.
6 TESTING AND MONITORING
6.1 Acceptance and Start-Up Testing
It is important that new ventilation systems be inspected
and tested on completion of the installation to ensure the
system conforms to the design specifications, flow rates and
velocities have been met, and that worker exposure goals
have been achieved.

6.2 Checking Preconstruction Details
Ventilation system design should use standard fittings and
equipment for hardware such as hoods, elbows, entries,
expansions, contractions, stacks, and so on. If the hardware
elements provided for installation are standard, SP losses
will be approximately those estimated during design. If the
system is large it may be worthwhile to test for losses.
Hoods warrant special attention. The entry losses on
standard hood designs as noted in the ACGIH Ventilation
Manual are quite reliable, however, if the hood design is not
typical it may be difficult to estimate entry loss. In such a
case the best solution is to have a single hood fabricated and
tested to define the entry loss. This is especially important
when a large number of hoods are to be installed. With a
sample hood the coefficient of entry can be defined for use
in routine hood static suction measurements to calculate
airflow using Eq. (10).
An initial physical inspection of the completed system
should be conducted to determine if the system is built
according to the design plans and specifications. The size and
type of fittings should be checked and the hood construction
reviewed. The fan type and size should be as specified and
the direction of rotation, speed, and current usage should be
noted. A detailed inspection sheet should be completed.
Air cleaning equipment should be inspected to deter￾mine if it is installed according to specifications. If ancillary
equipment such as pressure sensing or velocity measuring
equipment is included in the systems, it should also be
inspected and calibrated. Be sure all local and national codes
are being complied with. For example, EPA and local air
pollution authorities sometimes require differential pressure
monitoring at baghouses and wet scrubbers to assure that
cleaning effectiveness is being maintained.
Air cleaning equipment should normally be mounted on
the suction side of the fan, especially if the equipment is
located inside a building. If this is not done air contaminants
may leak into occupied spaces.
6.3 Airflow
The general format for testing a new LEV system balanced
without blast gates is shown in Figure 13. The airflow rate
through each branch servicing a hood should be determined
using, for example a pitot tube and manometer to conduct

pitot tube that can measure TP, SP, and VP in ductwork.
Electronic manometers with microprocessor-based
instruments are available for direct reading of pressure and
velocity. When used in conjunction with a small portable
recorder, the pitot traverse can be conducted by one person.
One of two critical design velocities should be measured,
depending on the hood type. A partial enclosure such as a
paint spray hood has a design velocity or control velocity at
the plane of the hood face. Exterior hoods such as a simple
welding hood will have a capture velocity specified at a
certain working distance. The control and capture velocities
may be calculated from the airflow rate and the hood dimen￾sions. Frequently, the actual velocities must be measured to
satisfy plant or regulatory requirements. Face velocities at
partial enclosures are usually evaluated using a velometer.
These instruments have a wide range of applications but care
should be taken to observe their limitations as described in
the manufacturer’s literature.
The measurement of hood SP, SPh, is also of value in peri￾odic inspections and should be measured at the acceptance
tests. A permanent manometer should be installed to provide
a real-time monitor of SPh because it is directly related to
airflow. The measurement, made 2–4 diameters downstream
of the hood, provides a simple method of calculating airflow
using Eq. (10). The data collected in the acceptance tests
also become important baseline information for subsequent
periodic inspections described in Section 5.
6.4 Performance
The term performance, as used in here, describes the ability
of the LEV to minimize the release of air contaminants
from equipment serviced by the system. This measurement
can be done by qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative
methods.
6.4.1 Qualitative Methods
The use of smoke tracers released at the generation point, if
done properly, provides an excellent qualitative method of
checking the performance of the hood. The control boundary
can be established with this technique. In addition, it can
be an excellent teaching tool for the worker who can view
the impact of his own body and actions and that of external
disturbances such as drafts from windows, doors, and traffic
on the ventilation. Corrosive smoke cannot be used in
semiconductor facilities; both dry ice and ultrasonic streams
have been evaluated for this purpose. In Europe another
qualitative technique, light scatter with back lighting, is
widely used to identify the source and generation mode
of particle contamination. Exquisite photographs of dust
release based on this technique have been used as a design
input for ceramic industry dust control.
6.4.2 Semiquantitative
One approach is described here. The LEV system is first
assessed to determine if it meets good practice in terms
of general design and airflow rates. If those are acceptable
the system is checked qualitatively by smoke and then
semiquantitatively using a tracer gas, as shown in Figure 15.
A series of release grids are designed that model the actual
release area. An oil mist generator operating with corn oil
is used to generate a submicronsized aerosol. The generator
is positioned to release the mist deep in the hood so that
all mist is collected. The probe of a forward light scatter
photometer samples the duct stream laden with the mist
and the reading is defined as 100% containment. The grid
is then positioned at the actual work release point and a
new reading is taken in the duct. If all the mist is collected
the reading will be 100%; if only 1/2 the oil mist is collected
the reading of containment is 50%.

Case Study. In one series of studies using this technique,
M. Ellenbecker (personal communication) evaluated the
capture efficiency of a series of LEV hoods in a chemical
processing plant. The test aerosol was mineral oil with a
count median diameter of 0.3–0.4 μm. In each operation
the area source of contamination, such as a reactor charge
port or the wet surface of the cake on a plate and frame
filter, was simulated with a grid network of nozzles that
could be varied from a point source to an area source several
meters square. In this system, the contaminant release for
the grid was relatively passive and therefore one cannot
duplicate the dynamics of the source such as the “throw.”
Nor can one duplicate the generation rate or other physical
parameters such as temperature. For these reasons it must
be identified as a semiquantitative procedure and extensive
laboratory validation would be needed to upgrade the test to
a quantitative procedure.
The performance of 10 local exhaust hoods chosen for
evaluation in this well maintained chemical plant were highly
variable. Four hoods (two reactor and two weigh scale hoods)
with a capture efficiency of 100% were obviously oper￾ating satisfactorily. However, in one case the exhaust rate
was too high. The exhaust rate was reduced by a factor
of four and a capture efficiency of 100% was still main￾tained. Such excessive flow rates will result in high operating
costs to exhaust the air and bring in tempered replacement
air. Another four hoods achieving capture efficiencies of
90–100% (reactor, drum vent, centrifuge, and a weigh scale
hood) were adequate for many operations but the investi￾gator felt they might not be acceptable for highly toxic air
contaminants. A single Neutsche filter hood had a capture
efficiencies of 85%. Ellenbecker felt the design was unsat￾isfactory and the maintenance program should be reviewed
and upgraded. A single bung hole exhaust hood with a
capture efficiency below 70% was felt due to an inferior
design.
This evaluation system and others now available using
tracers such as sulfur hexafluoride are semiquantitative. They
do not attempt to closely model the specific chemical or
its generation rate. Although the tests are semiquantitative,
the procedure is simple, the equipment suitable for in-plant
tests, and the procedure can be done in 20–30 min. It can
be effectively used by a technician to explore the effects in
changes in hood geometry and placement, airflow rate, and
baffle design. It is also an excellent training aid for chemical
processors who must learn to use the exhaust system as a
valuable tool.
6.4.3 Quantitative
The capture efficiency of a LEV system is usually difficult to
establish in a plant using the process-generated contaminant.
To conduct such a test, the system must be enclosed
temporarily so that all the contaminant enters the hood to
establish the 100% capture efficiency concentration. If that
cannot be done both the fraction of the contaminant collected
by the hood and that fraction lost from the hood must be
independently determined. The fraction of the contaminant
lost to the room is especially difficult to measure.
Case Study. Conroy (14) used a quantitative approach in
the evaluation of capture efficiency on a degreaser hood. In
her work both the local and general exhaust airflow rates
were measured as was the volume of the workspace. Solvent
concentration at several locations in the general workplace
and in the duct servicing the exhaust hood were measured
periodically as was the velocity of the cross drafts in the
workspace. Using mass balance models, the rate of solvent
emission to the workspace was calculated based on the
workspace concentrations and the ventilation characteristics
of the workspace. The hood exhaust rate and the concen￾tration in the duct determined the local exhaust emission
rate. The ratio of the LEV emission rate to the total rate of
solvent emission, that is the sum of the loss to the room and
that removed by the hood is the hood capture efficiency.
In most cases quantitative measurement of hood perfor￾mance is made by air sampling on the worker. This procedure
obviously does not measure capture efficiency but rather the
ability of the LEV system to achieve a certain air concen￾tration at the breathing zone of the worker. In such a case,
the most realistic test involves the operator using the actual
chemical.
6.5 Periodic Maintenance Testing
The LEV system should be inspected periodically to ensure
that the system continues to meet performance and design
standards and complies with various regulations. The motor￾fan components are inspected to determine the condition of
the fan blades, direction of rotation, belt tension, guarding,
and lubrication. The hoods and ductwork are inspected for
corrosion damage, plugging, leaks, and any local modifica￾tion by the plant.
The importance of well-qualified personnel to design,
install, operate, and inspect LEV systems is of paramount
importance to the IH.
7 MAKEUP AIR AND RECIRCULATION
OF EXHAUST AIR
Adequate supplies of outside air are necessary to ensure
proper operation of ventilation systems. Properly designed
exhaust systems will remove toxic contaminants by
themselves; however, they should not be relied upon to
draw air into the building to replace that which is exhausted,
because this can result in excessive negative pressures within
the building, leading to undesirable effects. Mechanically
220INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION
controlled systems for supplying the air to the workspace
are preferred and in most modern industrial facilities are
necessary to achieve the overall desired ventilation. Most
outside air-supply systems currently installed in industrial
plants have been placed in operation only to replace the
exhausted air, with little or no regard to the overall positive
effects that can be achieved by the air-supply system in the
total environmental-control system.
7.1 Need for Adequate Makeup Air
Air enters a workspace in an amount equal to the volume
actually exhausted, regardless of whether mechanical provi￾sions are made for replacement of the air. Of course in some
cases, particularly when the total-exhaust volume is small,
the replacement air enters the building with no adverse
effects, even in the absence of a mechanical makeup-air
system. When the exhaust volumes are relatively large in
comparison to the size of free inlet area of the building,
however, undesirable effects will be experienced. Older
industrial buildings with large void spaces in the enclosing
walls may provide significant openings, and air leakage into
the building can be quite pronounced. Modern windowless
plants of masonry construction, however, can be essentially
airtight, with the result that the building is starved for air
if there is a significant volume of exhaust ventilation. In
a building that is relatively open, an influx of outside air
is particularly undesirable in northern climates, where the
incoming air cools the perimeter of the building, workers
exposed to the incoming air are subjected to drafts, temper￾ature gradients are produced within the building, and the
internal heating system is usually overtaxed. Although the
incoming air eventually may be tempered to acceptable
conditions by mixing with interior air, it is an ineffective
heat-transfer process, usually resulting in wasted energy.
Reasons for considering an adequate supply of makeup
air in conjunction with a total ventilation system include the
following:
1. Lack of adequate makeup air creates a negative pres￾sure within the building; this increases the SP that must
be overcome by the exhaust fans if they are to function
properly. This effect can result in a reduction of the total
volume of air exhausted from the enclosure, and it is
particularly serious with low pressure fans such as the
common wall fans and roof exhausters of the propeller
type.
2. Cross drafts created by the infiltration of uncontrolled
makeup air interfere with proper operation of exhaust
hoods and also may disperse contaminated air from
one area of the building to another; moreover, they
can seriously interfere with proper operation of process
equipment. The relatively high velocity cross drafts
through windows and doors created by the infiltration
of air can even dislodge settled material on beams and
other horizontal surfaces, resulting in resuspension of
solid contaminants in the workroom.
3. If the negative pressure created within the building is
significant enough, there may be actual backdraft on
flues and other natural draft stacks, posing a potential
health hazard from release of combustion products into
the workroom. Such backdrafting can occur in natural￾draft stacks at very low negative pressures. Secondary
problems associated with the backdraft phenomenon
include difficulty in maintaining pilot lights in burners,
erratic operation of temperature controls, and potential
corrosion damage in stacks and heat exchangers due to
condensation of water vapor from the flue gases.
4. The cold drafts resulting from infiltration of uncon￾trolled makeup air can produce worker discomfort,
leading to reduced work efficiency attributable to lower
ambient temperatures and the drafts impinging on the
workers.
5. The differential pressures created across internal parti￾tions may make doors difficult to open or close if the
amount of infiltrated makeup air is high enough. In
some extreme cases, this can pose a safety hazard when
doors are moved by the force of the pressure gradient
itself in an uncontrolled manner.
6. The conditions of cooler ambient temperatures near the
building perimeter often lead to decisions to correct the
problem by installing more heating equipment in those
areas when installation of a proper makeup-air system
would eliminate the problem. The heaters warm the
air only after it has entered the building, usually too
late to be of benefit to the workers at the perimeter.
Then the overheated air moves toward the building inte￾rior, making those areas often uncomfortably warm.
Often attempts are then made to alleviate this problem
by installing more exhaust fans to remove the excess
heat, but this further aggravates the problem of temper￾ature gradients within the building. The net result
is the unnecessary wasting of heat without solving
the problem. The fuel consumption associated with
attempts to achieve comfortable temperatures within
the building by this approach is much higher than it
would be with a properly installed system for providing
makeup air.
7.2 Principles of Supplying Air
The volume of makeup air provided to a workspace gener￾ally should equal the total volume of air removed from the
building by exhaust-ventilation systems, process venting,
and combustion processes. The determination of the actual
amount of air removed from the building usually requires
221PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
no more than a simple inventory of air-exhaust locations,
with measurements of the amount of air being exhausted and
compilation of the exhaust volumes. It frequently is desir￾able to incorporate any reasonable projections for additional
exhaust requirements in the near future, certainly if process
changes or additions or modifications to the plant are being
contemplated. Often it is desirable to install an air-supply
system of a capacity slightly larger than actually needed to
allow for future needs. In most cases the drive mechanism
on the air-supply system can be modified to supply only the
desired quantity of air.
The locations of the makeup-air units, with the consequent
distribution of air and creation of airflow patterns within
the building, often do not receive sufficient thought before
installation, and in many instances this aspect of the system
is neglected altogether. However, successful operation of the
total-ventilation system depends upon proper distribution of
makeup air. The following principles for supplying makeup
air should be incorporated into the design of an air-supply
system:
1. Locate the inlet for the fresh air away from any sources
of contamination, such as exhaust stacks or furnace
exhausts. It is advisable to filter the fresh air, in order
to protect equipment and to ensure maximum efficiency
of heat exchange in the tempering systems.
2. Incorporate a mechanically operated air mover, that is
a fan or blower, in the air-supply system to prevent the
development of negative pressure within the room or
building.
3. Design the locations of the makeup-air entries so as to
maximize utilization of the air within the workspace.
Properly located makeup-air-supply inlets can be used
to provide general dilution-ventilation first, after which
the air provides makeup for exhaust systems operated
within the building. Obviously, this concept does not
apply for specialized types of makeup air such as those
installed for spot-cooling purposes, where the air is
introduced at temperatures significantly below room
temperature, and at specific workstations. In general,
the air distribution pattern created by the combination
of makeup-air supply and process exhaust must be
engineered carefully to provide effective coverage
within the building without creating excessive drafts,
which could interfere with process operations or
compromise the comfort of workers.
4. Introduce the makeup air into the plant at a height
of approximately 8–10 ft wherever practicable. In this
way, the air is used first by the workers, maximizing
the results of general ventilation. Such an arrangement
for distribution of the incoming air also permits closer
control of the ambient workplace temperature.
5. Heat or cool the makeup air, as necessary, to approx￾imately the desired inside temperature. Accordingly,
the temperature range for incoming air typically varies
between 65 and 80 ∘F, depending on the geographic
location of the building and the climatological and
meteorological conditions characteristic of the location
and time of year.
7.3 Recirculation of Exhaust Air
Typical application of LEV includes discharge of the
contaminated air to the atmosphere, with or without benefit
of an air cleaning device. In recent years, some industries
have actively investigated exhaust systems that will clean the
air of contaminants to a degree sufficient to permit discharge
of the air directly back into the workplace. This approach is
desirable because air cleaning or pollution control devices
have been employed to substantial degrees to meet air
quality or emission standards. Additionally, the heating
and/or cooling of makeup air needed to replace exhausted
air can be an expensive item, particularly because costs of
energy are increasing and in some cases energy to operate
new installations is not readily available.
The acceptability of recirculating air systems obviously
depends to a great extent on the health hazard associated
with the contaminant being exhausted. It has been a fairly
consistent policy of official occupational health agencies not
to condone the recirculation of exhausted air if the contami￾nant could have an adverse effect on the health of workers
in the event of system failure. Even if the air cleaner is
efficient enough to sufficiently clean the air for health protec￾tion, incorrect operation, or poor maintenance of the system
could result in the return of hazardous contaminated air, for
example operations using lead. Recirculation systems should
comply with ANSI/ASSE – Z9.7 Recirculation of Air from
Industrial Process Exhaust Systems. (Use latest version.)
7.3.1 Circumstances Permitting Recirculation of Air
Recirculation of exhausted air is sometimes a feasible
method of supplementing ventilation within the workplace.
In some situations, the economic and energy-conservation
factors may be important enough to warrant the additional
capital and operating expenditures of assuring the safe provi￾sion of recirculated air. In general, recirculation of exhausted
air may be permitted under the following circumstances:
1. The ventilation system should be furnished with a
primary air-cleaner system efficient enough to provide
an exit concentration, that is concentration of contam￾inant in the air recirculated to the workroom, not
exceeding an allowable value, which may be calcu￾lated for equilibrium conditions using the following
equation:
CR = (PEL − Co)QT
2QRK (13)
222INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION
where CR is the concentration of contaminant in exit air
from the collector before mixing, QT is the total venti￾lation flow through the affected workspace (ft3 min−1),
QR is the recirculated airflow (fpm), K is a mixing
factor, usually varying between 3 and 10 (3=good
mixing conditions), PEL is the acceptable or permis￾sible exposure concentration; usually some fraction of
the OEL, CO is the concentration of contaminant in
workers’ breathing zone with local exhaust discharged
outside.
2. A secondary air cleaning system of efficiency equal to
or greater than the primary system should be installed
in series with the primary cleaner. As an alternative
to this approach, a reliable monitoring device may be
installed to furnish a representative sample of the recir￾culated air. This monitoring system must be fail-safe
with respect to failure of the power supply, environ￾mental contamination, or the obvious results of poor
maintenance.
3. A warning signal should be provided to indicate the
need for attention to the secondary air cleaning system,
or the air monitor should indicate when the concentra￾tions have exceeded predetermined allowable limits.
4. There should be a mechanism for either immediate
bypass of the recirculated air to the outdoors or
complete shutdown of the contaminant-generating
process to become operative under conditions that
activate the system’s warning device.
5. The system meets the requirements of ANSI Z9.7
(latest version), Recirculation of Air from Industrial
Process Exhaust Systems (11).
7.4 Additional Design Safeguards
for Recirculated Air
With the full expectation that interest in and development of
refined recirculated air systems will continue, the following
factors and considerations should be incorporated into anal￾ysis of the appropriateness of recirculated air systems in any
exhaust air setting.
1. Usually it is necessary to provide dilution ventilation
air in addition to that recirculated to ensure continual
dilution of the contaminants in the recirculated
airstream.
2. When it is proposed or possible that all the supplied
ventilation air be that recirculated from exhaust
systems, all possible contaminants in the airstream
should be evaluated, not just the most significant. Of
particular concern would be minor contaminants in
the airstream that might pass through the primary and
secondary air cleaning devices. For example, a fabric
filter-high efficiency particulate filter combination,
although providing essentially complete collection of
particulate contaminants, could allow the concentra￾tion of gases and vapors to build up during the course
of operation from relatively insignificant to potentially
hazardous levels.
3. Wherever practicable, the recirculating air system
should be designed to permit bypass to the outdoors
when weather conditions permit. For example, if the
system is intended to conserve heat during winter
months, it can discharge outdoors in warmer weather
if windows and doors are designed to permit sufficient
makeup air when opened.
4. Air recirculated through wet collectors may pose a
problem in that the humid air from such equipment
usually causes uncomfortably high humidity within
the workplace and possible condensation problems.
Excessive humidity may be prevented through the use
of auxiliary ventilation equipment.
5. Design data and testing programs preceding installation
of recirculating air systems should consider all oper￾ational time periods of the system because it can be
reasonably expected that the concentration of contami￾nants exiting typical collectors will vary over time.
6. As with design and layout of any air-supply system,
the ductwork from the recirculating air system should
provide adequate mixing with other air supplies to
avoid uncomfortable drafts on workers or air currents
that could adversely affect the performance of local
exhaust hoods.
7. In general, even when a monitoring device is avail￾able, the installation of a secondary air-cleaner system
is preferable because it usually lends a greater degree
of reliability to the system and requires a less sophisti￾cated maintenance program.
8. Although the primary concern for the quality of
the recirculated air centers on acceptable exposure
limits, odors or nuisance values for contaminants
should be considered as well. In fact, in some loca￾tions, adequately cleaned recirculated air, provided
by a system with appropriate safeguards, can be of
better quality than the makeup-air supply entering the
building from outside.
9. Routine testing, maintenance procedures, and records
should be developed for the circulating air system.
In addition, the workroom air should be tested periodi￾cally.

1 HISTORICAL REVIEW
The respirator is historically one of the oldest types of equip￾ment used for personal protection in the occupational setting.
It is uncertain when the use of primitive forms of respira￾tory protection began. However, Pliny the Elder recorded the
first known use of such a device early in the first century
AD. Although respirators have been used for almost 2000
years, the genesis of their technical development is the mid￾nineteenth century. During that century, respiratory tech￾nology advanced rapidly as evidenced by the
• Appearance of the first early ancestors of modern
atmosphere-supplying respirators.
• Recognition that a different type of respiratory equip￾ment was needed for protection against particulate
hazards than was needed for protection against gaseous
or vaporous hazards.
• Rapid advancement of particulate filter technology after
the discovery of Brownian motion (first observed 1827).
• Discovery of the adsorptive properties of activated char￾coal for many types of organic vapors.
Chemical warfare agents, introduced in World War I,
focused attention on the need for adequate respirators. In
the United States, the Bureau of Mines (BM) successfully
carried out this work for the Army. The BM in 1919 initiated
the first respirator certification program in the United States
and certified their first respirator, a self-contained breathing
apparatus (SCBA), in 1920 (1). Manufacturers voluntarily
submitted their devices for testing, which, if satisfactory,
could be sold as BM-certified devices. The term “certified
Patty’s Industrial Hygiene, Seventh Edition. Edited by Barbara Cohrssen.

respirator” has become a part of the language of industrial
hygiene. In 1920, the BM began to publish “Approval
Schedules” for specific types of respirators. However, it
had no statutory authority to regulate the use of respira￾tors in the United States. The use of respirators continued
unregulated until the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety
Act was enacted in 1969. As a result of this legislation,
regulations were promulgated in Title 30 of the Code of
Federal Regulations Part 11 (30 CFR Part 11) governing the
certification and use of respirators in the mining industry (2).
In 1972, the testing and certification program was assumed
by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH).
This document also established procedures and prescribed
requirements for joint approval by the BM and NIOSH.
As a result, NIOSH shared a joint certification function
with the BM, and certification labels carried the designa￾tion of both agencies. Later, the BM responsibility was
passed to the Mine Enforcement and Safety Administra￾tion (MESA) and then went to Mine Safety and Health
Administration (MSHA) (e.g. NIOSH/BM, NIOSH/MESA,
or NIOSH/MSHA approved for …).
In 1995, NIOSH promulgated new certification regula￾tions, Title 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 84 (42 CFR
84) to replace 30 CFR Part 11 (3). Except for the particulate
filter requirements, most requirements of the existing regula￾tions (30 CFR 11) were incorporated into the new regulation
(42 CFR 84) without change. This rule also gave NIOSH the
sole responsibility for certifying most respirators. Currently,
respirators are tested and certified by the National Personal
Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL). NPPTL is a
division of NIOSH. MSHA and NIOSH continue to jointly
225PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
review and approve respirators tested by NPPTL for mine
emergencies, mine rescue, and the associated service life
plans, user manuals, and other documentation.
Closely following the passage of the 1969 Federal Coal
Mine Health and Safety Act was the 1970 enactment of
the Occupational Safety and Health Act. This legislation
established the Occupational Safety and Health Admin￾istration (OSHA) and NIOSH. OSHA has the regulatory
authority to require and monitor the use of respirators in
general industry under Title 29 Code of Federal Regula￾tions Part 1910.134 (29 CFR 1910.134) and in construction
under 29 CFR 1926.103 (4, 5). OSHA promulgated a revi￾sion for 29 CFR Parts 1910.134 and 1926.103 in January
1998 (6). In addition to these respirator regulations, OSHA
has substance-specific standards with respirator use require￾ments (e.g. lead 29 CFR 1910.1025, inorganic arsenic 29
CFR 1910.1018, and benzene 29 CFR 1910.1028). In 2006,
OSHA revised 29 CFR Parts 1910.134 and 1926.103 to
include assigned protection factors (APFs) and to revise
the substance-specific standards, except for 1,3-butadiene, to
have uniform APFs (7).
There are other consensus standards and publications
that are extremely useful reference materials addressing
the use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE). Specifi￾cally, ASTM International Standard F3387-19 addresses the
various elements of respiratory protection such as respirator
use and programs (8). Two American National Standard
Institute (ANSI) standards address fit testing and medical
evaluation (9, 10). In addition, the International Standards
Organization (ISO) has developed standards on respirator
performance, selection, and use, resulting in new respirator
classifications (11).
The primary objectives of industrial hygiene are to protect
workers and to prevent contaminants from escaping into
the atmosphere. Hazard control should start at the outset of
process, equipment, and plant design stages so those poten￾tial exposure sources can be engineered out. Unfortunately,
exposure control often becomes an issue after a process is
operational, and therefore control becomes a more difficult
and costly proposition. Even then consideration should be
given to the use of effective engineering controls to eliminate
and/or reduce exposure to respiratory hazards. The preferred
priority of control steps are (i) elimination of the substance
or substitution of a less-toxic substance, (ii) encapsulation or
isolation of the process, (iii) use of local exhaust ventilation
or general ventilation, and (iv) use of RPE.
RPE should be used only when all higher priority control
steps are not technically or financially feasible. Real-world
circumstances, however, demonstrate that engineering
controls often do not reduce exposures sufficiently to elim￾inate a respiratory hazard. As a result, RPE often becomes
the only technically and economically feasible adjunct to
engineering controls to minimize and control respiratory
exposures. According to estimates reported by the US
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2001),
there are roughly 282 000 establishments with 3.3 million
workers in the private sector industry using respiratory
protection (12). Thus, RPE continues to be an important
component in many respiratory exposure control plans.
2 RESPIRATOR PERFORMANCE
The performance of RPE is typically evaluated in two
ways: in the laboratory and in the workplace. Laboratory
tests include NIOSH certification tests that evaluate indi￾vidual components (e.g. filter efficiency and exhalation valve
leakage) or performance parameters (e.g. minimum flow rate
for an air supply respirator) of the RPE. NIOSH also tests
completely assembled and worn RPE. These evaluations
have typically measured facepiece fit.
The second type of evaluation consists of workplace
studies (e.g. workplace protection factor (WPF) studies).
These types of studies evaluate performance of the complete
respirator assembly under workplace conditions.
2.1 Laboratory Tests
Laboratory tests used by NIOSH to evaluate individual
components include filter efficiency tests, chemical cartridge
service life, exhalation valve leakage, end of service life
alarms on SCBA, and performance requirements such as
breathing resistance, and minimum flow rate requirements
for supplied-air respirators (SARs) are described in detail in
42 CFR 84 (13). NIOSH also evaluates fit of the completely
assembled respirator while worn by a panel of people.
Knowing the minimum performance standards and recog￾nizing the limitations of the NIOSH certification tests are
important when selecting and using a “NIOSH-certified”
respirator.
The panels in Figure 1a and b for full and half facepieces
present the population distribution for facial sizes related to
face length and face width and lip length and face width,
respectively. These panels have been widely utilized to deter￾mine how respirators fit the general population (14). Today,
most manufacturers supply half- and full-facepiece respi￾rators in multiple sizes that cover these facial groupings.
NIOSH performed a large anthropometric study (15) and,
as shown in Figure 2, has an updated panel that may ulti￾mately be widely used and is being implemented by NIOSH
when performing certification fit testing. This panel, called
the NIOSH Bivariate Panel, is used for certification of air￾purifying respirators (APRs). The difference between these
two panels is a shift to larger faces, reflecting the larger
size of the general population. This test is to ensure that the
respirator can fit a wide variety of people although it does
not ensure it fits a specific individual. Individual fit testing

to ensure fit to the worker is discussed under the respirator
program requirements.
Respirators passing the NIOSH tests are then certified by
NIOSH as meeting specific requirements for various respi￾rator classes. These requirements establish the respirator
classification system used in the United Sates as discussed
below. A unique approval number is then issued to the
completely assembled respirator tested starting with the
prefix indicated in Table 1.
SCBAs used for firefighting undergo additional laboratory
tests described by the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) standard, 1981 (16). The NFPA standard has specific
tests that are more relevant to the firefighting environment.
These tests include flame and heat resistance, enhanced air
flow rates compared to the NIOSH requirements, and vibra￾tion among others (16). For structural firefighting, an SCBA
that is both NIOSH certified and compliant with NFPA 1981
is recommended.
Finally, completely assembled devices have been tested
in laboratory environments when worn by people to look at
overall performance. During the past 50 years, a substantial
amount of respirator research has been focused on devel￾oping quantitative methods to evaluate how well a respi￾rator fits.
In 1972, Hyatt and Richards (17), at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, described quantitative fit methods using an oil

aerosol of dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and an improved quantita￾tive fit method using polydispersed sodium chloride (NaCl).
The unique aspect of both test methods was that they used in￾facepiece sampling in conjunction with fast response detec￾tors and recorders to provide a real-time measurement of
leakage into a respirator. While wearing the respirator in
the test chamber, the test subject carried out the following
exercises: (i) normal breathing; (ii) deep breathing; (iii)
nodding head up and down; (iv) turning head side to side; (v)
bending forward and touching toes; (vi) talking; (vii) smiling
if the respirator was equipped with a half-mask facepiece or
frowning if the respirator was equipped with a full facepiece;
and (viii) normal breathing.
These studies led to the first set of “protection factors”
used to estimate the protection thought to be provided in
the workplace (18). The methods described by Hyatt were
rapidly accepted and viewed as models for quantitative fit
testing (QNFT) in the United States. As concerns developed
about how close these conditions represented the workplace,
more rigorous laboratory studies were designed and carried
out as well as increasing the interest in workplace testing.
These studies are commonly referred to as simulated work￾place protection factor (SWPF) studies. This performance
term and others have been described by the American Indus￾trial Hygiene Association Respirator Committee (19). These
studies were done to determine the overall performance of
the various types of RPE.
2.2 Workplace Testing
A limited number of workplace studies of respirator perfor￾mance were carried out in the 1970s. In the early 1980s,
NIOSH began to conduct workplace studies. The studies
measured the amount of protection provided by the respirator
by measuring the concentrations of workplace contaminants
inside and outside of the respirator when the respirator was
properly fit, correctly used, and conscientiously worn. These
studies ensured that these respirator program parameters
were present to evaluate respirator performance while elim￾inating misuse conditions. Since then, several WPF studies
have been conducted. Many of the techniques for conducting
these studies have improved, and the products on the market
place have changed. OSHA has reported on these studies
during its rulemaking to establish APFs (7, 20). OSHA relied
on carefully designed WPF and SWPF studies, since they
focus on the performance characteristics of the respirator
when used in an effective respirator program as required
by OSHA.
In both studies, air sampling outside and inside the respi￾rator is conducted simultaneously while the respirator is
worn. The ratio of the outside concentration to the inside
concentration is determined for each test subject (worker).
This ratio is called, generally, a protection factor; if measured
in a workplace, a WPF and if in a controlled laboratory envi￾ronment, an SWPF. Several WPFs and SWPFs are measured
on various people. These results are evaluated statistically.
In addition to the geometric mean, the geometric standard
deviation and the fifth percentile WPF or SWPF are often
calculated. The fifth percentile WPF or SWPF has been the
preferred statistic. The fifth percentile is the estimate for the
given set of data for that respirator under those test conditions
that one would expect 95% of the WPFs or SWPFs to exceed
that value. The fifth percentiles from all the studies were used
as the starting point for setting the APF. The number may
have been rounded for ease of use. For example, one respi￾rator type had fifth percentiles from various studies of 28, 31,
and higher. OSHA set the APF at 25.
The conclusions reached by OSHA are listed in the APF
Table I of 29 CFR 1910.134. This table is reproduced as

aThese APFs do not apply to respirators used solely for escape. For escape respirators used in association with specific substances covered by 29 CFR 1910
Subpart Z, employers must refer to the appropriate substance-specific standards in that subpart. Escape respirators for other IDLH atmospheres are specified
by 29 CFR 1910.134 (d)(2)(ii). bEmployers may select respirators assigned for use in higher workplace concentrations of a hazardous substance for use at lower concentrations of that substance,
or when required respirator use is independent of concentration.
cThe assigned protection factors in the table are only effective when the employer implements a continuing, effective respirator program as required by this
section (29 CFR 1910.134), including training, fit testing, maintenance, and use requirements. dThis APF category includes filtering facepieces and half masks with elastomeric facepieces.
eThe employer must have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these respirators demonstrates performance at a level of protection
of 1000 or greater to receive an APF of 1000. This level of performance can best be demonstrated by performing a WPF or SWPF study or equivalent testing.
In the absence of such testing, all other PAPRs and SARs with helmets/hoods are to be treated as loose-fitting facepiece respirators and receive an APF of 25.

selection. For a listing of the complete set of respirator
performance studies evaluated by OSHA, discussion of the
studies, and the process for setting each of these APFs,

publications (7, 20).
3 RESPIRATOR CLASSIFICATION
RPE is broadly classified as air-purifying and atmosphere￾supplying devices. Each class of device can be equipped
with a variety of respiratory inlet coverings. Respiratory inlet
coverings are the part of the RPE covering the mouth and
nose. These can be configured as a quarter, half, or full
facepiece; a mouthpiece; or a loose-fitting facepiece, hood or
helmet, or tight-fitting hood. The loose-fitting hood or helmet
can be configured with a shroud that may include just the
face, the upper body, or in other cases the entire body. The
loose-fitting facepiece may be configured with a helmet to
provide head protection or a hood, but in either case the back
of the head and neck is not covered and it makes a partial
seal with the face. The tight-fitting facepiece is intended to
adhere snugly to the skin of the wearer. It is available in
three varieties: quarter mask, half mask, and full-face mask.
The quarter mask covers the nose and mouth; the half mask
covers the nose, mouth, and chin; and the full-face mask
covers the entire face from chin to hairline and from ear to
ear. The facepiece is usually held in place by elastic or rubber
straps. A half-facepiece RPE is secured to the face with straps
attached on each side of the facepiece, that is, a two- or four￾point suspension. The straps may be attached to the facepiece
in various ways such as tabs, yoke, or loop straps. Full-face
masks have a head harness attached to the facepiece usually
at four, five, or six points.
A mouthpiece is held in the wearer’s mouth, and a clamp
is placed over the nostrils. The lips are pursed tightly around
the mouthpiece, and all air comes through the filtering
device or air supply attached to the mouthpiece. Respira￾tors utilizing this respiratory inlet covering are escape-only
devices.
For loose-fitting respirators, air is provided through a hose
leading into the respiratory inlet covering. Because they are
not tight fitting, it is important that enough air be provided
to maintain an outward flow of air and prevent contaminants
from entering these respiratory inlet coverings.
3.1 Positive Pressure Classification
Respirator regulations and literature frequently contain refer￾ence to “positive pressure.” The term is used to describe
modes of operation in which the pressure within a respi￾ratory inlet covering is higher (i.e. positive), relative to
ambient pressure outside the respiratory inlet covering. It is
the consensus of the RPE community that such operation
affords the highest possible level of respiratory protection.
229PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
The rationale is that if a face seal leak occurs, the positive
pressure would force air out rather than allow inward leakage
of contaminant. Over the years, pressure-demand SCBA,
SARs, continuous-flow SAR, and powered air-purifying
respirators (PAPRs) have all been considered positive pres￾sure RPE. However, it must be noted that NIOSH has no
approval criteria for positive pressure devices per se in
Part 84. In other words, “positive pressure” has never been
defined. NIOSH does, however, have approval criteria for
pressure-demand devices, which require that pressure inside
the respiratory inlet covering stay positive relative to atmo￾spheric pressure during the certification test. So, a device
certified by NIOSH, as pressure demand is in fact a “positive
pressure” device as defined by this requirement. The ques￾tion of whether a device is positive pressure becomes one
of defining a work rate and therefore an air delivery rate to
which the RPE should be engineered. For continuous-flow
SAR and PAPRs, the minimum flow rate required by NIOSH
is 115 l min−1 for tight-fitting facepieces and 170 l min−1 for
loose-fitting devices.
The laboratory evidence indicates that negative-pressure
potential is created during the time of inhalation if the
instantaneous inspiratory flow rate exceeds 170 l min−1,
the minimum flow rate required for NIOSH certifica￾tion. However, Skaggs et al. (21) testing SAR with hoods
under simulated work conditions with an air supply of
170 l min−1 measured quantitative fit factors (QNFFs) of
20 000. Numerous field and laboratory studies have indi￾cated that at minimum certification airflow rates (115 l min−1
for tight-fitting facepieces or 170 l min−1 for loose-fitting
facepieces) these devices do not always maintain positive
pressure as indicated by negative-pressure spikes.
However, the significance of these negative-pressure
spikes is not known as these respirators still achieve high
SWPFs even though the spikes occur (22). Although the
pressure-demand SCBA is still considered to provide the
best respiratory protection, it also has been found that nega￾tive facepiece pressure may occur at high work rates. Wilson
et al. (23) recommended that SARs and SCBAs be designed
to accommodate peak flows of 400 l min−1 because there are
respirator users in the work force with lung function capa￾bilities sufficient to produce instantaneous inspiratory flow
rates of this magnitude. For pressure-demand SCBAs used in
firefighting, the NFPA requires that positive pressure should
be maintained in the facepiece when tested on a breathing
machine operating at 30 respiration/min producing a minute
volume of 103 l min−1 (16). These conditions produce a
peak instantaneous demand of approximately 330 l min−1.
They feel these test parameters are sufficient to meet the
respiratory demands of approximately 98% of the fire￾fighter population. Meanwhile, air flow rates in PAPRs have
increased due to requests of users. However, the pressure
inside the respiratory inlet covering under work conditions
has not been measured. Thus, referring to RPE as positive
pressure is not useful to describe respirator performance.
Laboratory test conditions vary between standards, making
it difficult to compare. The respirator APF is a better indi￾cation of the respirator performance rather than trying to
classify the RPE as positive pressure.
3.2 Air-Purifying Respirators
APRs remove contaminants from the atmosphere and can
be used only in atmospheres containing sufficient oxygen
to sustain life (at least 19.5% by volume at sea level) and
within specified concentration limitations of the specific
device. They cannot be used in immediately dangerous to
life or health (IDLH) atmospheres. APRs incorporate an air￾purifying element that can remove aerosol, gas, or vapor
contaminants from the air. Except for filtering facepiece
respirators (FFRs), the air-purifying elements used with
respirators are usually replaceable. The useful life of an APR
is dependent on the concentration of the contaminant(s), the
breathing volume of the wearer, and the capacity of the air￾purifying medium. Air-purifying units can be divided into
two functions: aerosol (particle) removal and gas and vapor
removal.
For aerosol removal, the aerodynamic size, charge of the
aerosol particles, and the face velocity of the air entering
the filter influence the efficiency of filtration. Gas and vapor
removal requires a suitable sorbent or catalyst material. The
air-purifying element is composed of a filter, a gas or vapor
sorbent, or a combination of both. NIOSH-certified air￾purifying RPE is only designed for use during entry into or
escape from atmospheres not IDLH.
Nonpowered APRs are negative-pressure devices and
must have a tight-fitting facepiece. They rely on the negative
pressure produced within the facepiece cavity during inhala￾tion to draw ambient air through the air-purifying elements.
NIOSH certifies quarter-, half-, full-face, or mouthpiece
respirators as nonpowered APRs. Filtering facepieces are
included in the tight-fitting half-facepiece category. PAPRs
can be equipped with tight- as well as loose-fitting hoods or
helmets. The usage limitations of the air-purifying elements,
particularly gas and vapor cartridges, once determined,
should not be exceeded.
3.2.1 Particulate Respirators
Air-purifying, particulate respirators utilize filters to remove
aerosols from the air. Filters capture aerosols using a combi￾nation of filtration mechanisms. These mechanisms are
impaction, interception, and diffusion. Filters relying solely
on these mechanisms are commonly referred to as “mechan￾ical filters.” Electrostatic attraction, resulting from charge on
the fibers of the filter, is often used to enhance these filtration
mechanisms. Filters that use an engineered method to add
230RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
an electrostatic charge to fibers to enhance electrostatic
attraction are commonly referred to as “electrostatic filters.”
Regardless of the chemical composition, it is the aerody￾namic particle size of the aerosol that determines which of the
mechanisms predominates. The efficiency of aerosol removal
is related to its aerodynamic size, with approximately 0.3 μm
aerodynamic diameter aerosols considered to be the most
penetrating. This most penetrating particle size can shift by
changes in the face velocity challenging the filter. The effi￾ciency of all mechanisms is improved as the filter fiber diam￾eter is decreased and the fiber-packing density is increased.
The resistance to airflow per unit of surface area of the filter
usually increases as the filter fiber diameter decreases and
fiber-packing density increases. A filter with high collection
efficiency for small aerosols usually has a higher resistance
to airflow than a filter having lower collection efficiency for
small aerosols. The face area of the high-efficiency filter must
be larger to keep the inhalation flow resistance equal to that
of the lower efficiency filter. During use, the efficiency of
filters improves, and breathing resistance increases, as the
aerosol loads on the filter surface and begins to act like a
sieve. Electrostatic charge can be engineered into synthetic
fibers as permanent dipoles, called electrets. Electrostatic
filters, when compared to mechanical filters of similar effi￾ciency without an electrostatic charge, have lower resistance
to airflow without decreasing filter efficiency. In general, oil
aerosols are more penetrating for electrostatic filters than
particulate aerosols. It is hypothesized that the oil coats the
fiber of the electret and in effect shields its internal dipole.
However, electrets can be made that are not affected by oil.
The NIOSH filter classification is useful in determining if the
filter is oil resistant or not, and the user does not need to be
concerned with the filter’s construction.
3.2.1.1 Filter Classification NIOSH classifies
nonpowered air-purifying particulate filters into three
series: N (not resistant to oil), R (resistant to oil), and P
(oil proof). The N-series filters are restricted to use in those
workplaces free of oil aerosols. The R- and P-series filters
are intended for removal of any particles, including oil-based
liquid aerosols. The filters of each series are further classified
by efficiency against a most penetrating particle size as (i)
100 class filters that have a minimum efficiency ≥99.97%;
(ii) 99 class filters that have a minimum efficiency ≥99%;
and (iii) 95 class filters that have a minimum efficiency
≥95%. These tests incorporate an approximately 0.3 μm
mass median aerodynamic diameter particle that filtration
theory indicates should be a most penetrating particle size.
Other certification test performance parameters include
using
• An airflow rate of 85±4 l min−1 that simulates a high
work rate (42.5±2 l min−1 through each filter for paired
filters).
• DOP and NaCl particles at Boltzmann charge equilibra￾tion.
• Measurement of instantaneous penetration.
• Using filter efficiency expressed as percent penetration.
• High total filter loading (up to 200 mg for N- and R￾series filters and continued loading beyond 200 mg until
there is no further decrease in efficiency for P filters).
It should be noted that 42 CFR Part 84 requires an eval￾uation of initial breathing resistance at 85±2 l min−1. The
test conditions and aerosols for the nonpowered respirator
filters and restrictions on use are summarized in Table 3. The
filter efficiency degradation category (N, R, or P) is deter￾mined using either NaCl or DOP as the test aerosol. NaCl is
slightly degrading to filter efficiency, whereas DOP is highly
degrading. No particle size limits apply to respirators with
Part 84 filters. This is because it is assumed that the filters
have been tested against the most penetrating particle size
under a “worst-case” test.
Therefore, N-series filters may only be used for any solid
or nonoil liquid containing particulate contaminant.
R-series filters may be used for any particulate contam￾inant. If used for an oil-containing particulate, a one-shift
(or eight hours of continuous or intermittent use) use limit
applies.
P-series filters may be used for any particulate contami￾nant. Shortly after these filter requirements were published,
NIOSH laboratory studies indicated the efficiency of P-series
filters may be significantly reduced with long-term use (much
greater than 200 mg) in the presence of oil aerosols (24).
They found that the reduction in P-series filter efficiency
varied significantly from model to model and therefore could
not make a single filter change recommendation that was
appropriate for all models. NIOSH requested that each manu￾facturer of P-series filters establish service time recommen￾dations as part of their user instructions. As a result, the
respirator user must consult the manufacturer’s instructions
for the time use limitation for its P-series filters.
The service life of all filters is limited by considerations of
hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance. All filters should
be replaced whenever they are damaged, soiled, or causing
noticeably increased breathing resistance, even if this occurs
before the above time limitations are reached.
3.2.2 Gas and Vapor Respirators
There are two types of gas and vapor respirators, commonly
referred to as “chemical cartridge respirators” or “gas
masks.” The difference is that gas masks utilize an air￾purifying element, called a canister, and is larger than the
cartridge element used with chemical cartridge respirators.
Gas and vapor removal is accomplished with sorbents
that have collection efficiencies that are dependent on the

cHigh (200 mg) filter loading in the certification test is intended to address the potential for filter efficiency degradation by solid or water-based (i.e. nonoil)
aerosols in the workplace. Accordingly, there is no recommended service time limit in most workplace settings. In workplaces with high aerosol concentrations,
service life should only be extended beyond eight hours of use (continuous or intermittent) by performing an evaluation in specific workplace settings that
demonstrates that extended use will not degrade the filter efficiency below the certified efficiency level, or that the total mass loading of the filter is less than
200 mg (100 mg per filter for dual-filter respirators).
dNo specific service time limit when oil aerosols are not present. In the presence of oil aerosols, service time may be extended beyond eight hours of use
(continuous or intermittent) by demonstrating that extended use will not degrade the filter efficiency below the certified efficiency level, or that the total mass
loading of the filter is less than 200 mg (100 mg per filter for dual-filter respirators).

chemical composition and physical properties of the gas or
vapor or catalysts that chemically react with harmful agents
to form less-toxic products. Sorbents are porous and have a
large surface area per unit weight up to 1500 m2 g−1. As the
gas or vapor passes through the sorbent bed, the molecules
are adsorbed on the surface. Adsorption captures gases and
vapors when passing through a particular (sorbent) bed.
Adsorption is the adherence of gas or vapor molecules to
the sorbent surface either by physisorption (physical adsorp￾tion) or chemisorption. In physisorption, the attractive force
between the sorbent and the adsorbate molecule is small (on
the molecular level) and is due to van der Waal’s forces of
adhesion. Since only weak physical forces are involved, the
process can be reversed.
For gases and vapors that would otherwise be weakly
adsorbed, sorbents (usually activated carbon) can be impreg￾nated with chemical reagents to make them more selec￾tive. Chemisorption occurs when the sorbent surface and the
vapor bond chemically (25). Chemisorption is usually irre￾versible. If the solid material causes the vapor to change
chemically without affecting the solid, then it is a catalytic
reaction.
The sorbent most widely used is activated carbon or char￾coal. Alone, it is an excellent adsorbent of many organic
vapors. Impregnating it with specific materials increases its
retention efficiency for additional gases and vapors. Where
there is reason to suspect that a sorbent has a high heat of
reaction with a substance, use of that sorbent is not recom￾mended.
Unlike aerosol filters, cartridges and canisters with
sorbents have high removal efficiency initially and at some
point become less efficient and lose the ability to trap the
contaminant completely. The chemical cartridge or canister
must be changed before significant breakthrough occurs.
There are two ways to determine when the cartridge or
canister needs to be replaced. These are to use a cartridge
or canister with an end-of-service-life indicator (ESLI) or to
develop and follow a change schedule. However, few models
have ESLI.
OSHA has not defined acceptable protocols in the stan￾dard for establishing change schedules (6) but does provide
guidance on their website (26). It is generally recognized
that such schedules can be based on data obtained from
breakthrough studies conducted in the workplace or in the
232RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
laboratory under “worst” conditions or estimated using
various service life calculators that are available from
NIOSH (27) and respirator manufacturers. These can be
found by going to the websites of the specific manufacturer.
Gas and vapor APRs cannot be used in IDLH atmo￾spheres or in atmospheres containing less than 19.5%
oxygen by volume. Gas masks (canister respirators) may
be used for escape if the atmosphere is not oxygen defi￾cient. Gas and vapor APRs should not be allowed for either
entry into or escape from hazardous environments when
supporting evidence exists to demonstrate that unreason￾ably short service life would occur at the maximum use
concentration (MUC). Although limited in number, there are
special-purpose gas and vapor respirators, for example vinyl
chloride or formaldehyde, that are approved by NIOSH
for protection against gases and vapors when respirators
approved for a given class of contaminants (e.g. organic
vapors) cannot be used due to sorbent deficiencies.
3.2.2.1 Chemical Cartridge Respirators NIOSH￾certified gas and vapor respirators are permissible for use
against gas or vapor contaminants up to a concentration
that is the lesser of either the respirator MUC – the concen￾tration determined from multiplying the respirator’s APF
classification by the contaminant’s occupational exposure
limit (OEL) – or the IDLH concentration of the contaminant
(whichever is lower), provided an oxygen deficiency does
not exist. Cartridges can be equipped with particulate filters
to form combination gas/vapor and particulate RPE.
3.2.2.2 Gas Masks Gas masks are like chemical cartridge
respirators, but the quantity of available sorbent material
is greater. Although some of the approval test gases and
vapors for chemical cartridge respirators are the same as
those used to test gas masks, the test concentrations and the
minimum sorbent life span differ. Gas masks are typically
full facepieces attached by a breathing tube to a canister that
can be carried on the front or back of the wearer or mounted
on the chin of the facepiece. An exception is the escape gas
mask, which may have a half mask or a mouthpiece and nose
clip. NIOSH certifies gas masks for escape only from IDLH
atmospheres.
3.2.2.3 Gas and Vapor Cartridges and Canisters
The certification tests used by NIOSH do not test the
sorption efficiency for all gases and vapors found in the
workplace. The certification bench tests for gas and vapor
canisters and cartridges are in Subpart I and L, respectively,
of 42 CFR 84 (13). The challenge gas or vapor and its
concentration, test flow rate, maximum allowable pene￾tration, and minimum service life for these devices are
summarized in Table 4. The bench test requirements for
escape canisters are similar but not identical to those for
chin-style canisters listed in Table 4. The specific test criteria
for escape gas masks can be found in Subpart I of Part 84.
Unfortunately, these data are difficult to use to establish a
change schedule for use in the field.
Canisters and cartridges are evaluated by NIOSH against
a relatively few gases and/or vapors. Breakthrough infor￾mation for most chemicals must be obtained from other
sources such as the technical literature and respirator manu￾facturers. Nelson and Harder did extensive work in deter￾mining the service life for organic vapor cartridges exposed
to various organic vapors (28). They exposed commercial
organic vapor cartridges to high concentrations of organic
vapors and recorded their breakthrough times. Using the
NIOSH procedure for organic vapor cartridge testing, they
tested the cartridges against 107 organic vapors. Nineteen of
the 107 materials tested failed in less than 50 minutes, which
is the minimum time the cartridge must last under NIOSH
test conditions.
Without an ESLI, information concerning the effective￾ness of the sorbent with the contaminant should be obtained,
and a conservative time of service set. The sense of smell
can then be used as a secondary alarm but must be used
cautiously as individuals’ ability to detect a chemical varies
greatly, and olfactory fatigue can occur for some chemicals.
Other chemicals may be odorless, and others may not be
detected (smelled) until the concentration exceeds the OEL.
Examples of gases and vapors fitting these conditions include
carbon monoxide, methyl alcohol, methyl chloride, methy￾lene chloride, propane, and stibine. Odor should never be
used as a primary indicator for changing cartridges.
Once the effectiveness of the sorbent for the contaminant
has been determined, the MUC will need to be determined
before selection can be completed. While this must be done
for all respirators, there are more considerations than just the
mathematical calculation to determining the MUC for gas
and vapor respirators. These include the IDLH concentration
and eye irritation. For example, if eye irritation for a specific
chemical occurs at a lower concentration than the MUC for a
half-facepiece respirator, the half-facepiece respirator MUC
should be limited to the level causing eye irritation. For
concentrations above the eye irritation level, a full facepiece
needs to be considered.
3.2.2.4 Combination Cartridges and Canisters
Cartridges and canisters can be certified for more than one
class of gas or vapor (e.g. organic vapor and acid gas), or
they also may be used in combination with an aerosol filter
(e.g. organic vapor and particulate P95 filter). A chemical
cartridge or canister certified for more than one class of
gas or vapor may contain more than one type of sorbent
media. Combination canisters for gas masks must meet
the minimum breakthrough times at the specific challenge
concentrations and conditions noted in Table 4.
A chemical cartridge or canister combined with a partic￾ulate filter provides respiratory protection for exposure to

mixed gas/vapor and particulate contaminants. In addition
to meeting the requirements for gas and vapor certification,
these combinations must also pass the applicable particulate
filter tests.
3.2.2.5 Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide is not
sorbed but by catalytic action is oxidized into carbon
dioxide. The carbon monoxide canister is typically filled
with a mixture of manganese and copper oxides, known
as Hopcalite. This mixture catalytically converts carbon
monoxide to carbon dioxide without the presence of mois￾ture. Moisture stops the reaction. To prevent the entry of
moisture, carbon monoxide canisters have layers of drying
agents on both sides of the catalytic agent. An ESLI is
required that shows when the drying agent is saturated and
the life of the canister is ended.
3.2.3 Powered Air-Purifying Respirators
The PAPR is designed with a battery-operated (gener￾ally) blower to push or pull air through the air-purifying
element(s) and supply it to the user. The PAPR is available in
two configurations: (i) ones with tight-fitting respiratory inlet
coverings and (ii) ones with loose-fitting respiratory inlet
coverings. Tight-fitting respiratory inlet coverings include
half facepieces, full facepieces, and hoods or helmets with
neck dams that form tight seals around the neck. Loose￾fitting respiratory inlet coverings include the loose-fitting
facepiece, helmet, and hood. These helmets and hoods may
have shrouds and collars but do not have tight seals around
the neck. For particulate hazards, NIOSH certifies PAPRs
equipped with one of three filter types: HE, PAPR100-N,
and PAPR100-P filters. The HE filter, sometimes called a
high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, is tested against
DOP aerosol under the test parameters described in Part
84, Subpart K, paragraph 84.175 (3). The PAPR100 filters
are tested as described in Part 84, Subpart K, paragraph
84.180 (29). The difference between the PAPR100 filters is
that the PAPR100-N is tested with NaCl and PAPR100-P
is tested with DOP. The PAPR100-N filter is restricted to
use in atmospheres free of oil aerosols. The PAPR100-P
filter is intended for all aerosol hazards, including oil￾based aerosols. All three filter series; HE, PAPR100-N and
PAPR100-P, are at least 99.97% efficient as determined
in these tests. The differences are a result of different test
aerosols, test duration, test concentrations, number of filters
tested, and filter loading (29).
PAPRs are generally available with the same cartridges
and canisters for the gas and vapor hazards as nonpow￾ered APRs. PAPRs equipped with a tight-fitting respira￾tory inlet covering must provide a minimum of 115 l min−1
of air to the covering. Those equipped with a loose-fitting
facepiece, hood, or helmet must provide a minimum of
170 l min−1 to the loose-fitting respiratory inlet covering.
Because the PAPR is an APR, it must not be used in an
oxygen-deficient or an IDLH environment or in the presence
of atmospheric contaminants for which the filters or sorbents
are not effective.
3.3 Atmosphere-Supplying Respirators
3.3.1 Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus
SCBA provides breathing protection for various periods of
time based on the amount of breathing air or oxygen supplied
and the breathing demand of the wearer. The SCBA respi￾rator carries a supply of compressed air, compressed or liquid
oxygen (O2), or oxygen-generating chemicals. No external
connection to an air supply is necessary. SCBA are classified
as open- and closed-circuit devices. In open-circuit devices
the exhalation flow is dumped to the atmosphere. In closed￾circuit devices, the exhalation flow is kept in the respirator,
scrubbed of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) and moisture, and
reconditioned with fresh O2. SCBA are certified for (i) entry
into and escape from or (ii) escape only from IDLH atmo￾spheres including O2-deficient atmospheres. The inhalation
flow is engineered to operate in demand or pressure-demand
modes. However, demand devices are not the preferred
choice for IDLH atmospheres and are disappearing from
the marketplace. OSHA only allows pressure-demand SCBA
with more than 30 minutes to be used for entry into IDLH
atmospheres.
Pressure-demand SCBAs are often used in very high
concentrations of contaminants. At such high concentrations,
it must be recognized that certain materials, particularly
some gases and vapors, are capable of harming the body by
means other than through the respiratory tract. The possi￾bility of dermal exposure must also be considered. To avoid
that possibility, consideration must be given to selecting the
appropriate protective clothing that should be worn in addi￾tion to just selecting the proper respiratory protection. For
example, ammonia, in concentrations of approximately 3%
or higher, can cause skin burns, particularly on moist skin.
Hydrocyanic acid, a gas at slightly above room tempera￾ture, is capable of penetrating the skin and causing systemic
poisoning, although to do so, concentrations considerably
higher than those required for poisoning through the respi￾ratory tract must be present.
3.3.1.1 Open-Circuit Self-Contained Breathing
Apparatus The most widely used SCBA is an open-circuit
device consisting of a compressed air cylinder, airflow
regulator, airline, and facepiece, all of which must weigh
less than 35 lb. The duration of air supply can be certified
at different intervals from a minimum of 3 minutes to a
maximum of 75 minutes. Combination SAR and auxiliary
SCBA units are approved as SCBA and thus approved for
use in IDLH atmospheres. In the United States, SCBAs are
235PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
available in units with air cylinders pressurized to 2200 or
4500 psi. The air supply cylinders may be steel, aluminum,
fiberglass-wrapped (hoop-wound) aluminum, a composite
cylinder of an aluminum bladder inside a filament-wound
fiberglass cylinder, or carbon cylinders that consist of an
aluminum alloy inner shell and covered with a total overwrap
of carbon fiber, fiberglass, and an epoxy resin. The fiberglass
and carbon fiber-wrapped cylinders reduce the weight of the
air cylinders significantly. The airflow regulator functions
in the SCBA and the SAR in a similar manner. It opens to
admit air into the facepiece when the pressure in the face￾piece is decreased. The airflow can vary depending on the
inhalation pressure. In contrast to the SAR regulator, it may
be a two-stage pressure-reducing regulator because the air
supply cylinder is under such high pressure. In addition, the
SCBA regulator must be designed to have a manual bypass
valve for emergency use by the wearer if the regulator were
to malfunction.
The SCBA customarily used for entry into hazardous
atmospheres is rated at 30 or 60 minutes; however, escape￾only SCBA units can have rated service life of 3, 5, 10, or
15 minutes. Service life ratings given with this equipment are
nominal and should not be regarded as absolute. High work
rates combined with the stress of emergency conditions will
markedly reduce the actual use time of the air cylinder.
3.3.1.2 Closed-Circuit Self-Contained Breathing
Apparatus and Closed-Circuit Escape Respirators
(CCERs) Closed-circuit devices, available with up to a
four-hour service life, reuse and condition the exhaled
air by circulating it through a chemical to remove the
carbon dioxide. The exhaled air then flows to the breathing
bag which is the breathing air reservoir for the facepiece.
Because oxygen is consumed during cellular respiration and
the carbon dioxide that is created is removed from the air by
a scrubber, a small amount of oxygen is added back into the
system. The oxygen can be added from a cylinder of liquid
or compressed oxygen.
Oxygen may also be stored as a solid chemical compound
for use with a closed-circuit SCBA. The chemical, usually
a type of peroxide, reacts in the presence of moisture and
carbon dioxide to produce pure oxygen. Because mois￾ture and carbon dioxide are both components of exhaled
breath, circulating exhaled breath through the oxygen-rich
chemical forms a usable breathing mixture. The carbon
dioxide is removed, as it becomes part of the reaction to
release oxygen. The air then enters a breathing bag for
mixing before being drawn into the facepiece. A disad￾vantage of this unit is that once the reaction has been
started in the canister, it cannot be terminated until the
chemical reaction is complete. Oxygen-generating canis￾ters are available for up to two-hour duration. Certain
types of these units referred to as closed-circuit escape
respirators (CCERs), previously known as self-contained
self-rescuers (SCSRs), are used as emergency escape
devices for miners. The name change came about to
reflect differences in performance requirements in 42
CFR 84. Most closed-circuit SCBAs are demand-mode
devices.
3.3.2 Supplied-Air Respirators
SARs deliver breathing air from a remote storage site,
through a supply hose to the respiratory inlet covering. SARs
do not have air-purifying filters and cartridges; instead, they
depend on delivering acceptable quality breathing air to the
user from an external source. These devices must not be used
in IDLH atmospheres. They are divided into three types:
A, B, and C. Type A and B SARs are not widely used.
In fact, they are no longer manufactured and so will not
be discussed. Type C SARs, also called airline respirators,
can be equipped with half, full, and loose-fitting facepieces,
hoods, or helmets supplied by a hose with air under pressure
not to exceed 125 psi. Type C SARs operate in the demand,
pressure-demand, or continuous-flow modes. NIOSH certifi￾cation of type “CE” refers to a type C SAR that is designed
for abrasive blasting that has outer coverings to protect the
wearer from bounce back of abrasive materials.
3.3.2.1 Type C SARs The NIOSH-approved continuous￾flow SAR includes the facepiece, breathing tube,
belt-mounted air control valve, and air hose from 15 to
300 ft long. An airflow regulator is also required for demand
and pressure-demand equipment. The user is responsible
for providing the air supply, any necessary airline filters,
manifold with airflow control valve for the air hose connec￾tion, and the airline pressure gauge. The airflow, set by
a valve at the supply manifold, can be changed only by
manually adjusting the airflow control valve. Problems can
be encountered in ensuring that the minimum required flow
is delivered. Changes such as an airline that is longer than
design length, has a smaller diameter, or has been spliced
can result in a drastic reduction in the air supply with the
same setting of the pressure gauge.
The demand-mode SAR, as the name implies, supplies
air to the user on demand. When the user inhales, the respi￾rator airflow regulation valve opens and air under pressure
enters the respirator. Airflow ceases when inhalation ceases.
The demand SAR may have a half or full facepiece. In each
case, because of the negative pressure in the facepiece during
inhalation, the degree of facepiece leakage is comparable to
that of an APR with the same facepiece. Because demand￾mode SARs do not offer protection to the user that is superior
to negative-pressure APR, their selection as RPE of choice
is very limited except for conditions where only an O2 defi￾ciency exists.
The problem of leakage into negative-pressure SAR
facepieces led to the pressure-demand facepiece, which
236RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
greatly reduces but does not eliminate contaminant leakage
into the respirator facepiece. The pressure-demand SAR
is like the demand-mode SAR except for the exhalation
valve and the airflow regulator. The exhalation valve is
spring loaded or uses some other type of resistance so
that a positive pressure can be maintained inside the
respirator facepiece. During inhalation, the pressure in
the facepiece still drops, but at some point, while still
above atmospheric pressure, the airflow regulator opens
providing airflow. Normally when inhalation occurs, the
positive pressure inside the facepiece is reduced but remains
positive.
Continuous-flow SARs can be equipped with tight- and
loose-fitting respiratory inlet coverings. The loose-fitting
SARs may consist of a loose-fitting facepiece, hood, helmet,
or full suit. The tight-fitting SAR is simply a facepiece with a
continual flow of air through the mask. It requires a minimum
continuous airflow of 115 l min−1 when in use. The hood or
helmet of the SAR introduces the air supply above the head of
the user. The air flows downward and exits under the edges of
the covering. Some designs use double shrouds or have neck
cuffs. NIOSH certification regulations specify a minimum
airflow of 170 l min−1 for SARs equipped with loose-fitting
respiratory inlet coverings.
3.4 Chemical, Biological, Radioactive,
Nuclear (CBRN) Approval
Since the late 1990s the concern for exposures to chem￾ical warfare agents has grown because of terrorist activity.
This concern has resulted in numerous approval categories
for respiratory protection for chemical, biological, radiolog￾ical, and nuclear materials. Presently, CBRN respirators exist
in the SCBA, APR, PAPR, and air-purifying escape respi￾rator. These respirators have been tested for their perme￾ation resistance to chemical warfare agents. The APRs have
cartridges or canisters that have been tested against a wide
range of chemicals that represent the chemical warfare agents
and toxic industrial materials that may be used in acts of
terrorism. This is a specialized field of respiratory protec￾tion. More information can be found on these devices at the
NIOSH website (30).
3.5 Supplied-Air Suits
There are no official regulations governing the design, sale,
and use of supplied-air suits, but the Department of Energy
(DOE) has a supplied-air suit protocol for use in reviewing
suits used by DOE contractors (31). Much is unknown about
the design and use of airline suits. Airline suits should be
tested to determine their efficiency prior to use in atmo￾spheres of high toxicity.
3.6 Escape Respirators
Escape devices have a single function: to allow a person
working in a normally safe environment sufficient time to
escape from a suddenly developing respiratory hazard(s).
Escape devices can be separated into two categories: APRs
and SCBA. APRs include the escape chemical cartridge
respirator, the gas mask (canister) respirator, and the filter
self-rescuer. The escape chemical cartridge respirator
consists of a half mask or a mouthpiece respirator. The
mouthpiece respirator can be used for short periods of
time to escape from low concentrations of organic vapor
or acid gas. Escape gas mask respirators equipped with
full facepieces can also be used for escape from IDLH
conditions, but not from oxygen-deficient atmospheres. No
air-purifying device is suitable for escape from a potentially
oxygen-deficient atmosphere. An SCBA provides air to the
user for escape from oxygen-deficient environments. Escape
SCBA devices are commonly used with full facepieces,
mouthpieces, or hoods and, depending on the supply of air,
are usually rated as 3–60 minutes units. All SCBA devices
can be used in oxygen-deficient atmospheres. CCERs are
certified by NIOSH for escape from mines, but these devices
may also have application in other similar environments.
CCERs provide a source of oxygen-enriched air for up to
60 minutes.
When selecting escape apparatus, careful consideration
must be given to potential eye irritation. This consideration
is important for determining whether a gas mask or SCBA
equipped with a full facepiece should be selected rather than
a device equipped with a half mask or mouthpiece. Most of
the gas masks or escape chemical cartridge respirators can
be used in situations involving gas, vapor, or particulate. For
escape from particulate-contaminated environments, an air￾purifying element must be selected that will provide protec￾tion against the given type of particle. The information in
Table 5 should be used to select the appropriate escape appa￾ratus.
4 RESPIRATOR SELECTION AND USE
When it has been determined that employees at a specific
worksite require the use of respiratory protection, ultimate
responsibility falls on the employer to select the appro￾priate RPE. Additionally, the employer must ensure that their
employees use the device properly. Proper selection requires
not only evaluation of the hazard but also careful consider￾ation of all the site-specific conditions that may impact the
employee and their use of the device.
Often the help of a health and safety professional may be
needed to make the appropriate evaluation of the workplace.
Once the respirator has been selected, the employer must
develop a comprehensive respiratory protection program in

accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134, as a minimum.
Usually, the complexity of the program will be dictated by
the type of respirator(s) that will be used as well as the
magnitude of the hazard of the work environment.
4.1 Respiratory Hazards
In occupational settings, toxic materials generally enter the
body in three ways: (i) through the gastrointestinal tract, (ii)
through the skin, and (iii) through the respiratory tract. Typi￾cally, the respiratory tract presents the quickest and most
direct entry of contaminants into the body and the circula￾tory system. The two basic classes of respiratory hazard are
oxygen deficiency and chemical airborne contaminants that
can be in the physical form of a solid, liquid, gas, vapor, or
a combination of these. The use of respiratory protection is
growing for two respiratory hazards that are particulate in
nature: biological agents (aerosols) and engineered nanopar￾ticles.
4.1.1 Oxygen Deficiency
The normal concentration of oxygen in air at sea level
is 20.9% by volume, which is equivalent to an oxygen
partial pressure of approximately 160 mmHg. NIOSH and
OSHA define an oxygen-deficient atmosphere as any atmo￾sphere containing oxygen at a concentration below 19.5%
at sea level or approximately an oxygen partial pressure
of 148 mmHg. At oxygen concentrations below 16% at
sea level, decreased mental effectiveness, visual acuity, and
muscular coordination occur. The minimum requirement of
19.5% oxygen at sea level provides an adequate amount of
oxygen for most work assignments and includes a safety
factor. Nevertheless, when 19.5% oxygen levels are iden￾tified at sea level there should be a clear understanding as
to why these levels are below normal and efforts taken to
ensure that they will not go below 19.5%. The safety factor
is needed because oxygen-deficient atmospheres offer little
warning of the danger, and the continuous measurement of
an oxygen-deficient atmosphere is difficult. Since oxygen￾deficient atmospheres are IDLH, only the most reliable respi￾rators are recommended. The most reliable respirators are
SCBA units or SAR units equipped with auxiliary SCBA
units. Because a high protection factor is not necessary to
ensure an adequate supply of oxygen even in an atmo￾sphere containing no oxygen, any NIOSH-certified SCBA
is adequate. Air-purifying RPE or SAR without auxiliary
SCBA is not acceptable for use in oxygen-deficient atmo￾spheres. In assessing exposure conditions, it is important
to remember that oxygen deficiency can occur in confined
spaces by displacement of air by other gases and vapors or
by means of oxidation processes such as fire, rusting, and
aerobic bacteria, where oxygen is consumed.
4.1.2 Biological Agents
One of the more recent areas seeing increased respirator
usage is for biological aerosols, predominantly in health care
settings. Respiratory protective devices have been used or
are being purchased to reduce exposure to bioaerosols (such
as droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(TB), virus-containing droplets causing severe acute respira￾tory syndrome (SARS), virus-containing droplets or aerosols
causing COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) or pandemic flu, and
anthrax spores). Particle-removing respirators such as N95
filtering facepiece respirators and PAPRs have been recom￾mended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) for these agents. This area presents many challenges
including unknown safe levels of exposure for these agents
or respirator efficacy for bioaerosols. Acceptable airborne
levels have not been established for potentially infectious
238RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
aerosols. NIOSH approved or certified respirators are not
tested against bioaerosols.
Construction and general industry workers may also
be at increased risk of disease from biological aerosols.
Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, is a
recognized occupational illness; however, no permissible
exposure limits or methods for air sampling exist for the
spores that can cause the illness. It is endemic in the south￾western United States. Workers engaged in soil-disrupting
activities may be at increased risk for the disease. Das et al.
(32) studied a Valley Fever outbreak in California. They
concluded that multiple risk-based measures were needed to
control occupational coccidioidomycosis including respira￾tors in endemic areas. Use of PAPRs with an APF of 1000
was recommended in addition to other controls (32).
Sondermeyer Cooksey et al. (33) investigated a coccid￾ioidomycosis outbreak among workers constructing two
solar farms. They recommended utilization of personal and
employer-driven safety practices, including respirator use in
the context of a respiratory protection program (33).
This lack of information on exposure limits and levels
for bioaerosols makes the respirator selection process diffi￾cult. Therefore, various approaches to respirator selection
in health care and other settings may be required (34). Use
of a properly selected respirator may reduce the risk due to
exposure to these materials but cannot be expected to miti￾gate the risk completely. Respirators with high APFs should
be expected to reduce risk to a lower level than respirators
with lower APFs when used within a respirator program
and worn properly and diligently by the worker. On the
other hand, respirators with higher APFs are more complex,
burdensome to the worker, and costly. The proper balance
needs to be achieved. FFRs mentioned earlier have been
used in health care settings because of their simplicity, cost,
and efficiency and because of the ease of disposal if they
become contaminated. Reuse of a respirator, or its disposal,
must also be consistent with the operating procedures of the
infection-control program of the health care facility. It is
imperative that when respirators are used against biological
agents, including health care settings, a respiratory protec￾tion program be implemented covering the same elements as
those used in industrial settings and in accordance with 29
CFR 1910.134. In the past, there have been varied require￾ments for these types of uses, but OSHA does not distinguish
between industrial and biological use settings.
4.1.3 Engineered Nanoparticles
While filtration theory predicts that as the particle gets
smaller than the most penetrating particle size, the filter
efficiency increases, a new concern has been raised with
the introduction of engineered nanoparticles in the work￾place. The filtration theory has been shown to hold true
for particles in the 2–60 nm range (35). Rengasamy et al.
(36) investigated the filtration performance of five models
of N95 FFRs and two models of P100 FFRs against six
different monodisperse silver aerosol particles in the range
of 4–30 nm diameter. They found that consistent with single￾fiber filtration theory, N95 and P100 respirators challenged
with these particles showed a decrease in percentage pene￾tration with a decrease in particle diameter down to 4 nm.
The authors concluded that the data from this study confirms
that NIOSH-approved N95 and P100 FFRs provide filtra￾tion performance of greater than 95% and 99.97%, respec￾tively. Another study conducted on NIOSH-approved and
CE-marked (European) FFRs tested against particles below
the most penetrating particle size showed a decrease in filter
penetration levels with decreasing particle size, as expected
by single-fiber filtration theory (37). This study evaluated
two models each of NIOSH-approved N95 and P100 FFRs
and two models each of CE-marked FFP2 and FFP3 FFRs
tested against particles in the size range of 4–30 nm diam￾eter. The authors stated that these respirators provide the
expected levels of laboratory filtration performance against
nanoparticles. All N95 and P100 respirators must meet the
same minimum filtration efficiency regardless of the type of
respirator for their respective category.
4.2 Respirator Program
When RPE is required by OSHA or the employer, a respi￾rator program must be instituted. The respirator program
ensures that the RPE selected will provide adequate protec￾tion under the conditions of intended use. OSHA requires
that a respiratory protection program contain the following
basic elements:
• Procedures for selecting respirators for use in the work￾place.
• Medical evaluation of employees required to use respi￾rators.
• Fit testing procedures for tight-fitting respirators.
• Procedures for proper use of respirators in routine and
reasonably foreseeable emergency situations.
• Procedures and schedules for cleaning, disinfecting,
storing, inspection, repairing, discarding, and otherwise
maintaining respirators.
• Procedures to ensure adequate air quality, quantity, and
flow of breathing air for atmosphere-supplying respira￾tors.
• Training of employees in the respiratory hazards to
which they are potentially exposed during routine and
emergency situations.
• Training the employees in the proper use of respirators,
including putting on and removing them, any limitation
on their use, and their maintenance.
239PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
• Procedures for regularly evaluating the effectiveness of
the program.
Each of these program elements are reviewed, and back￾ground information is given and discussed in this chapter.
The reader is advised to refer to 29 CFR 1910.134 for
specific requirements as well as other pertinent sections of
this chapter.
4.2.1 Program Administration
The OSHA standard requires employers to designate
a person as program administrator and to ensure that this
person is qualified to perform the responsibilities of the posi￾tion. Appropriate training or experience or both can qualify
this individual. Qualifications need to be commensurate
with the complexity of the program and the responsi￾bility to oversee and conduct evaluations of the program’s
effectiveness.
The standard allows an employer to provide respirators
on a voluntary basis on request by employees or permit
employees to use their own respirators, when respirators are
not actually required, provided that it has been determined
that respirator use itself will not create a hazard. It stipulates,
except for the use of FFRs, that the employer must establish
and implement those elements of a written respirator protec￾tion program necessary to ensure that
• any employee using a respirator voluntarily is medically
able to use that respirator,
• it is cleaned, stored, and maintained so that its use does
not present a health hazard to the user, and
• supply information contained in 29 CFR 1910.134
Appendix D to the user.
OSHA states in the preamble of the standard that it allows
this exception for filtering facepiece because it concludes
“There are no medical limitations on the use of these respi￾rators, so employers who allow their use need only ensure
that masks are not dirty or contaminated, that their use does
not interfere with employees’ ability to work safely, and that
they provide the employees with the information contained
in Appendix D of the final rule” (6).
4.2.2 Respirator Selection
To select a respirator properly, the industrial hygienist must
base her/his recommendation on an evaluation of all respi￾ratory hazards in the workplace and an identification of all
relevant workplace and user factors for a workplace. This
requires thorough knowledge of the process, related equip￾ment, raw materials, end products, and by-products that
can possibly create an exposure hazard. When assessing the
exposure potential for a respiratory hazard(s), consideration
should be given to potential emergency conditions that could
produce unexpectedly high contaminant concentrations or
even IDLH levels. This helps assure that proper emergency
RPE and procedures are available and understood by affected
personnel.
Examples of the types and sources of information that
need to be gathered are
• Safety data sheets.
• Specific regulations or guidelines for the use of the
material.
• Determination of physical, chemical, and toxicological
properties of the contaminant(s).
• Airborne concentration.
• IDLH concentration.
• Occupational exposure limits (OELs).
• Does the material irritate the skin, nose, or eyes?
• Does the material readily pass through the skin?
• If the air contaminant is a gas or vapor, can the material
be absorbed by a gas or vapor canister?
• Any service life information available (for cartridges
and canisters)?
• Does or is there potential for an oxygen-deficient atmo￾sphere to exist?
• APF required (contaminant concentration/OEL)?
• Other personal protective equipment that must be used
by the employee.
• The work rate of the employee (i.e. light, medium, and
high).
• What activities and movements the employee must do
to perform his or her job.
• Ambient conditions such as temperature, humidity, and
air movement.
• Physical hazards present.
Workers are not exposed to a single unvarying concentra￾tion of a hazardous substance; rather individual exposures
may vary throughout a work shift and between days. The
highest anticipated concentration should therefore be used
to compute the required protection factor for each respirator
wearer.
The information obtained on general use conditions
for respirators should include a description of the actual
job task, including the duration and frequency, location,
physical demands, and industrial processes, as well as the
comfort of the respirators. Some general use conditions may
preclude the use of specific types of respirators in certain
circumstances because the individual must be medically
and psychologically suitable to wear a given respirator for a
given task, particularly if the respirator is an SCBA.
The physical demands of the work can impact respirator
selection in various ways. Some work activities may result
240RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
in worker motions and conditions where, depending on the
respirator selected, the respirator “gets in the way.” This
may include respirators increasing the heat load in hot envi￾ronments and respirators with breathing tubes or trailing
airlines. For negative-pressure, APRs, breathing resistance
of the respirator may become an issue. As breathing (work)
rate increases, so does the breathing resistance. A respirator
that is acceptable at a low work rate may not be acceptable
at a high work rate. If the respirator is dislodged or removed
for any reason, (e.g. feeling of not getting enough air) in the
contaminated area, the protection provided by the respirator
is dramatically reduced, even for short periods of time. While
the APF may be appropriate for the conditions, the resulting
effective protection factor (EPF) may not be sufficient. EPF
is determined by considering the worker exposure while
wearing the respirator as well as when it is removed (19).
Removing a half-facepiece APR (APF=10) in the contami￾nated area for as little as 5% of the time results in an EPF
of less than seven. Removal of the respirator for 20% of
the time in the contaminated area results in an EPF of 3.6.
Selecting a respirator with a higher APF will not correct the
situation. For example, a full-facepiece air-purifying respi￾rator (APF=50) has a resultant EPF of 4.6 when removed
20% of the time. The solution is selecting a respirator with
features that reduce the need to remove the respirator.
Information obtained on the service life of the
cartridge/canister under conditions of intended use should
be evaluated. These evaluations should be based on the gas
and vapor contaminants and the temperature and relative
humidity extremes (high and low) existing in the workplace.
This information can be used to set up cartridge replacement
schedules and should be used in conjunction with sensory
warning properties as a secondary indicator of break￾through. Workers should be trained to exit the contaminated
area whenever they detect the odor of the contaminants.
Obtaining complete information on all criteria needed to
select RPE may be difficult. When conflicting or inadequate
data are found, experts should be consulted before RPE
selection decisions are made.
The adequacy of the respirator selected is very depen￾dent on the validity of the exposure limit used. As a result,
the assessment of the atmosphere for oxygen content and
concentration levels of particulate and/or gaseous contam￾inants is critical. Furthermore, NIOSH, OSHA, and good
industrial hygiene practice dictate that conditions in the work
area and worker’s exposure to respiratory hazards should be
monitored to assure that they have not significantly changed.
This necessitates periodic monitoring of the air contami￾nant concentration to which the respirator wearer is exposed.
Many factors, such as changes in the operation or process,
air movement, temperature, or humidity, affect the concen￾tration of a substance in the work area atmosphere. There￾fore, the air contaminant should be sampled. Preferably,
sampling should be in the respirator wearer’s breathing zone.
Both the time-weighted average and peak concentrations of
the contaminant should be determined. However, the air￾sampling campaign must be correctly planned and executed
and the data properly analyzed for useful results to be
obtained. The information in this section presents basic, but
not all-inclusive, information useful for properly selecting
RPE. More complete and detailed information is available
from the following sources:
• OSHA General Respirator Regulations, 29 CFR
1910.134, 29 CFR 1926, and respirator regulations
specific to a specific contaminant (4, 5).
• NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic. National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH)
Publication No. 2005-100 (38).
• Standard Practices for Respiratory Protection (ASTM
F3387-19), ASTM International, West Conshohocken,
PA, 2019 (8).
With the advent of WPF studies, NIOSH encouraged eval￾uating the “actual protection being provided by the respi￾rator” by sampling from inside the respirator (39). While
this may be useful, the result is specific for that worker and
respirator combination. Another worker/respirator combina￾tion may have a very different result due to a different fit
and respirator use skills. Currently, it is OSHA’s policy to
sample as if the respirator is not being worn (i.e. outside
the respirator). Sampling from inside the respirator can be
done, but there are many variables making it difficult to
obtain meaningful samples, which include the sampling loca￾tion from within the respirator, analytical limit of quantifi￾cation for the low concentrations of the contaminants typi￾cally found inside the respirator, worker-generated contam￾inants such as sweat and moisture confounding gravimetric
determinations, off-gassing of contaminants from previous
exposures or times when not wearing a respirator, and mois￾ture affecting sampling capacity and analysis for gases and
vapors. In addition, it may require extra respirators because
the integrity of the respirator may be impacted in order to
obtain the respirator sample. The challenges of sampling
from inside of a respirator have been described in more
detail and should be consulted before attempting this type
of sampling (40–42).
Respiratory protective devices vary in design, application,
and protective capability. The user must, therefore, assess
the inhalation hazard and understand the specific use and
limitations of available equipment to assure proper selection.
The respirator selected must be certified by NIOSH. After
collecting the information specified in earlier portions of this
section it can be applied to a decision logic to help “walk￾through” the respirator selection process. Figure 3 contains
an example of a decision logic adopted, with revisions and
additions from NIOSH (38).

FIGURE 3 (Continued)
The purpose of establishing an IDLH exposure level in
RPE selection is to ensure that the worker can escape from
a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of
the RPE. The IDLH is considered a maximum level above
which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing
maximum worker protection is permitted. Any appropriate
approved respirator may be used to its MUC up to the
IDLH concentration. If the concentration exceeds the IDLH
level, then once again only the most reliable respirators must
be selected: 30 minutes or greater pressure-demand SCBA
units or pressure-demand SAR units equipped with auxiliary
SCBA units. Some specific IDLH guidelines are provided in
the literature such as the NIOSH Pocket Guide for Hazardous
Chemical Substances (43).
When eye protection is required for routine exposures
to airborne contaminants that cause any irritation to the
mucous membranes of the conjunctivae or the cornea or
cause any reflex tearing, selecting respirators that provide eye
protection as well as respiratory protection such as full face￾pieces, helmets, or hoods can reduce the number of pieces
of personal protective equipment required. Eye protection is
required for contaminants that cause minor subjective effects
as well as for those that cause any damage, including disin￾tegration and sloughing of conjunctival or corneal epithe￾lium, edema, or ulceration. For escape, some eye irritation
is permissible if the severity of irritation does not inhibit the
escape and if no irreversible scarring or ulceration of the eyes
or conjunctivae is likely.
243PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
When selecting escape apparatus, careful consideration
must be given to potential eye irritation. This consideration
is important for determining whether a gas mask or SCBA
equipped with a full facepiece should be selected rather than
a device equipped with a half mask or mouthpiece. Escape
gas masks can be used in situations involving gas, vapor,
or particulate contaminants if the atmosphere is not oxygen
deficient. The information in Table 5 should be considered
when selecting appropriate escape apparatus.
4.2.3 Medical Evaluation
The OSHA standard recognizes that using RPE may place a
physiological burden on employees. This burden is a func￾tion of the type of RPE worn, the job and workplace condi￾tions in which the RPE is used, and the physical status of
the employee. Of interest to the program administrator and
industrial hygienist is the requirement of paragraph 29 CFR
1910.134(e)(5), supplemental information for the Physician
or Other Licensed Health Care Professional (PLHCP). This
subparagraph requires that the following information must
be provided to the PLHCP before the PLHCP can make
a recommendation concerning an employee’s ability to use
RPE.
• The type and weight of the RPE to be used by the
employee.
• The duration and frequency of RPE use, including use
for rescue and escape.
• The expected physical work effort.
• Additional protective clothing and equipment to be
worn.
• Temperature and humidity extremes that may be
encountered.
The PLHCP must also be provided with a copy of the
written respiratory protection program and a copy of 29 CFR
1910.134.
The employer is required to obtain a written recommenda￾tion regarding the employee’s ability to use the RPE from the
PLHCP. The recommendation can provide only the following
information:
• Any limitations on RPE use related to the medical
condition of the employee, or relating to the workplace
conditions in which the RPE will be used, including
whether or not the employee is medically able to use
the RPE.
• The need, if any, for follow-up medical evaluations.
• A statement that the PLHCP has provided the
employee with a copy of the PLHCP’s written
recommendation.
Annual medical evaluations are not required, but at a
minimum the employer should provide additional medical
evaluations if
• an employee reports medical signs or symptoms that are
related to their ability to use RPE;
• a PLHCP, supervisor, or the respirator program admin￾istrator informs the employer that an employee needs to
be reevaluated;
• information from the respiratory protection program,
including observations made during fit testing and
program evaluation, indicates a need for employee
reevaluation; or
• a change occurs in workplace conditions (e.g. physical
work effort, protective clothing, and temperature) that
may result in a substantial increase in the physiological
burden placed on an employee.
Workers should never be assigned to any operations
requiring respiratory protection until a PLHCP has deter￾mined that they are capable physically and psychologically
to perform the work using the RPE. The OSHA respirator
standard requires that no one should be assigned to tasks
requiring use of RPE unless he/she has been found physically
able to do the work while wearing the respirator. Readers are
referred to the OSHA Standard 1910.134 (e) and the OSHA
respirator medical evaluation questionnaire in Appendix C of
the standard (4, 5).
Some users experience psychological stress such as claus￾trophobia resulting in breathing distress or other manifesta￾tions while wearing a respirator (44). Recognition of such
users should be made prior to entering life-threatening envi￾ronments. Morgan and Raven, using an anxiety profile, can
predict those who may experience problems wearing respi￾rators in high work rate environments (45). Additional guid￾ance can be found in ANSI Z88.6 (10).
4.2.4 Fit Testing
Qualitative fit testing (QLFT) or quantitative fit testing
(QNFT) of tight-fitting facepieces used with air-purifying
and atmosphere-supplying devices must be done. Fit testing
must be performed on all tight-fitting respirators initially
before use of the respirator and repeated at least once a year.
Additional fit tests may need to be conducted if the employee
reports, or the employer, PLHCP, supervisor, or program
administrator makes visual observations of or changes in the
employee’s physical condition that could affect respirator fit.
Examples of these conditions include facial scarring, dental
changes, cosmetic surgery, or an obvious change in body
weight.
The importance of fit testing, especially for negative￾pressure respirators, is often overlooked. The two major
244RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
sources of leakage for a maintained respirator are through
the face seal and the air-purifying element (e.g. the filter
or cartridge). A review of the APFs for negative-pressure,
half-facepiece respirators in Table 2 shows that the APF
is 10 in all cases, regardless of the filter efficiency level
or if it is supplied air. The APF is based on the total of
all penetration routes into the respirator: face seal, filter
or chemical cartridge, and exhalation valve leakage when
properly used. This is one indication that the major source
of leakage is the face seal. The protection factor does not
change whether the half facepiece is fitted with an airline
or with a 95-level filter. The impact of filter selection for a
negative pressure respirator has little, if any, impact on the
overall protection. Fit testing is critical.
4.2.5 Qualitative Fit Tests
The QLFT methods expose the respirator user to an atmo￾sphere with a contaminant, and the respirator is acceptable
if the wearer cannot detect the contaminant. These methods
depend on the subjective opinion and detection ability of the
user to determine whether the respirator fits. Qualitative fit
tests use simpler equipment than that required for QNFT and
depend on the subjective opinion of the user as to whether
the respirator leaks.
The OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard 1910.134
contains QLFT protocols using isoamyl acetate, saccharin,
Bitrex™ (denatonium benzoate), and irritant smoke (stannic
chloride) as test agents (4). When selecting a QLFT protocol,
consideration must be given to properly matching the QLFT
test agent to the type of RPE to be fit tested. For example, a
P95 particulate, FFR could be tested with saccharin or Bitrex
but not isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke. If the respirator
program administrator adopts QLFT, OSHA requires that
the applicable protocol, as published in Appendix A, be
followed.
4.2.6 Quantitative Fit Testing
A QNFT measures the actual leakage of a test gas, vapor, or
aerosol into the facepiece. Instrumentation is used to sample
and measure the test atmosphere and the air inside the respi￾rator facepiece. With this information, a QNFF, sometimes
just referred to as a fit factor, is calculated. The QNFF factor
is the ratio of the outside concentration to the concentra￾tion inside the respirator facepiece. The QNFT methods are
based on the direct measurement of the contaminant inside
the respirator to determine whether the respirator fits. Quanti￾tative fit tests use more complex equipment than that required
for QLFT. This instrumentation is costlier and needs highly
trained personnel to conduct the test, operate the instrument,
and probe the respirators to sample air from inside the respi￾rator.
OSHA has published three accepted QNFT methods
in Appendix A of its Respiratory Protection Standard
1910.134 (4):
• Generated aerosol QNFT protocol using nonhazardous
test aerosols (such as corn oil, polyethylene glycol 400
(PEG 400), di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate (DEHS), or NaCl)
generated in a test chamber and employing instrumen￾tation to quantify the fit of the respirator.
• Ambient aerosol CNC QNFT protocol using ambient
aerosol as the fit test agent and CNC instrumentation
(condensation nuclei counter) to quantify the fit of the
respirator.
• Controlled negative-pressure QNFT protocol using a
controlled negative pressure and instrumentation to
measure the volumetric leak rate of a facepiece to quan￾tify the fit of the respirator.
4.2.7 Minimum Fit Requirements
OSHA requires, as a minimum, a qualitative fit factor
(QLFF) or QNFF of 100 for half facepieces. This can be
achieved by performing either QLFT or QNFT. QLFT is
allowed because the methods in the OSHA standard have
been shown to provide the wearer with a QNFF of 100.
QLFT used for full-facepiece respirators only allows that
the respirator be assigned an APF of 10 because these
protocols were only validated for a QNFF of 100. Therefore,
when using a negative-pressure full-facepiece respirator for
protection in areas where an APF of greater than 10 and
up to 50, QNFT must be performed, and the wearer must
achieve a QNFF of 500.
It is important to note that negative-pressure RPE should
not be used when facial scars, deformities, or any other
conditions that interfere with the face seal exist. This restric￾tion may become evident when fit testing is conducted. Addi￾tionally, no tight-fitting RPE (including positive pressure)
should be used when facial hair interferes with the face or
neck seal. Fit testing should not be performed unless the
person conducting the fit test is comfortable that a subject’s
facial hair will not interfere with the seal, less than 1-day’s
growth.
4.2.8 Training
The standard requires the employer to provide effective
training to employees who are required to use respirators.
The training must be comprehensive, understandable, and
recur annually or more often, if necessary. It should provide
the wearer with sufficient knowledge to demonstrate an
understanding of
• why the respirator is necessary and how improper fit,
usage, or maintenance can compromise the protective
effect to the respirator;
245PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
• what the limitations and capabilities of the respirator
are;
• how to use the respirator effectively in emergency
situations including situations in which the respirator
malfunctions;
• how to inspect, put on and remove, use, and check the
seal of the respirator;
• what the procedures are for maintenance and storage of
the respirator; and
• how to recognize medical signs and symptoms that may
limit or prevent the effective use of respirators.
The proper respirator is of no value without training
for the wearer. The training experience should provide the
wearer, in addition to the training elements listed above, an
opportunity to handle the RPE, to receive donning instruc￾tions, and to undergo size selection and fit testing. Competent
persons should instruct both supervisors and workers.
Workers should be instructed to leave the contaminated
area immediately upon suspicion of respirator failure and
then to determine the problem.
4.2.9 Evaluation of Respirator Program Effectiveness
OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.134 states that respirator
program effectiveness must be inspected and evaluated regu￾larly. Periodic program monitoring is necessary to ensure that
workers are adequately protected. The program should be
evaluated at least annually, and the written operating proce￾dures should be modified to reflect the evaluation results, if
necessary. Frequent inspection of respirator use determines
whether the correct respirators are being used and worn
properly. Examination of respirators in use and in storage
indicates how well they are maintained. Wearers should be
consulted periodically about their acceptance of respirators,
including the discomfort, resistance to breathing, fatigue,
interference with vision and communication, restriction of
movement, and interference with job performance, and their
confidence in the respirator’s effectiveness. The results of
periodic inspections of respirator use, consultations with
wearers, measurements of hazard levels in work areas, and
medical evaluation of wearers should be reviewed, studied,
and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the respirator
program. Evidence of excessive exposure to hazards should
be followed up to determine why inadequate protection was
provided, and action should be taken to remedy the problem.
The results of the program evaluation should be presented in
a written report that should list plans to correct faults and the
target dates for their implementation.
4.2.10 Maintenance and Care of RPE
The RPE should be properly maintained, correctly used,
and conscientiously worn. Proper inspection, maintenance,
and repair of RPE are necessary to ensure that it stays
in good working order. The maintenance program differs
based on plant size and the complexity of the RPE used.
However, the goal is to maintain the equipment in a condi￾tion that provides the same effectiveness it had when manu￾factured. To ensure that the respirator remains serviceable,
a maintenance program must be in place the first day of
respirator use. Respirators must be kept clean, sanitary,
and in good working order. The RPE should be cleaned
and disinfected following the manufacturer’s recommended
procedures if those procedures are of equivalent effective￾ness as the cleaning and disinfecting procedures detailed
in Appendix B-2 of 1910.134 (4, 5). Respirators used by a
single wearer should be cleaned and disinfected as often as
necessary. Respirators used by different individuals must be
cleaned and disinfected between each use.
The RPE should be stored in accordance with any
applicable manufacturer instructions. Generally, respirators
should be stored in a clean, dry area and in a place where
the respirator will not be adversely affected by the ambient
environment. Specifically, they should be stored to protect
them from damage, contamination, dust, sunlight, extreme
temperatures, excessive moisture, and damaging chemi￾cals. They should also be packaged or stored to prevent
deformation of the facepiece and exhalation valve.
The RPE used in routine situations should be inspected
before each use and during cleaning. RPE maintained for
use in emergencies should be inspected monthly according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and checked for proper
function before and after each use. Escape-only RPE
should be inspected before being carried into the workplace
for possible use. The inspection results should be dated,
recorded, and maintained as a historical file. RPE that fails
inspection or is found defective should not be used. Only
personnel with adequate training to ensure the equipment is
functionally sound after the work is accomplished should do
repair or replacement of other than disposable parts. Only
parts supplied by the manufacturer for the product being
repaired should be used; otherwise, the NIOSH certification
will be voided. Also, modifications to the respirator in any
way not recommended by the manufacturer will void the
NIOSH certification. The respirator must always be used in
the NIOSH-approved configuration.
4.2.11 Breathing Air Quality
Air compressors or compressed air bottles can supply
breathing air for SARs and SCBAs. OSHA and NIOSH
require that compressed breathing air meet the Type 1 Grade
D standards of the Compressed Gas Association (46). Grade
D standards are met if the following contaminant levels are
not exceeded: 10 ppm carbon monoxide, 1000 ppm carbon
dioxide, and 5 mg m−3 condensed hydrocarbons and lack of
noticeable odor.
246RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
Generally, there are two sources of contamination for
compressed breathing air: the air intake and the air compres￾sion system. The air in the compressor system will contain
the contaminants present at the air intake. Care should be
taken to see that the air intake is not located near any point
source emissions such as truck exhaust in shipping areas. In
urban areas with serious air pollution problems it may be
difficult to provide an air intake location free from contam￾ination. An intake near a loading dock or other area with
high vehicular traffic can lead to carbon monoxide intro￾duced to the air. The most common air compressor used for
breathing air is the oil-lubricated compressor, which adds the
oil mist and hydrocarbon vapors to the compressed air. If
for some reason the compressor overheats, it is possible for
partial combustion of the oil to occur and generate carbon
monoxide.
There are filters and sorbents available to remove the oil
mist and hydrocarbon vapors from the compressed air, but
carbon monoxide removal from the compressor air is more
complex. Carbon monoxide catalytic removal units contain
Hopcalite to convert CO to CO2. Because moisture ruins
Hopcalite, drying units protect the Hopcalite. Dual drying
towers are installed on some Hopcalite units so that while one
is removing CO from the air supply, the other is being dried.
When dry, it will automatically cycle to replace the other
unit. Carbon monoxide catalysis units are not mandatory
on oil-lubricated systems, but periodic monitoring for CO
is required. In addition, the compressor must be equipped
with a high-temperature alarm to notify if the compressor
has overheated. Although not required, continuous-reading
CO monitors set to alarm at 10 ppm should be installed to
monitor the CO concentration in the breathing air. A solution
to the potential problem of carbon monoxide is to use a
non-oil-lubricated compressor. Diaphragm pumps, oilless
compressors with graphite or Teflon piston rings, and water￾lubricated compressors are available.
Pressure-demand or demand SAR does not require a
continuous flow of air and can use stored compressed air
instead of an on-site air compressor. Breathing air certified to
meet Type 1, Grade D standards can be purchased in cylin￾ders holding more than 6000 liters. For users needing small
quantities of breathing air, purchasing bottled air means no
need for a breathing air compressor or to install breathing air
monitors and filters.
4.3 Special Problems with Selecting
and Using Respirators
4.3.1 Respirators and Hair
Tight-fitting RPE should never be worn when a satisfactory
face seal cannot be obtained or maintained. Facial hair is a
very common cause of an unsatisfactory seal. It is imperative
that clean, smooth skin be in contact with the sealing edge
of the facepiece because even a mild growth of facial hair
may interfere with this seal. Floyd et al. showed that QNFFs
decreased with beard length especially beyond 0.125 in (47).
Stobbe et al. in a review (48) of facial hair and respirator
fit studies found that the face seal of negative and positive
pressure respirators was adversely affected by facial hair.
Restrictions on facial hair is an emotional subject to some,
and company policies prohibiting facial hair, not carefully
planned and carried out, have been successfully challenged
(49). A policy statement prohibiting facial hair that interferes
with wearing a respirator should be concise and include only
respirator users. It must apply equally to all required to wear
a tight-fitting respirator and be part of the respirator program.
4.3.2 Cold Temperatures
In cold temperatures, problems of facepiece flexibility, visi￾bility, and frozen valves must be considered. The facepiece
will fog in cold weather when exposed to warm exhaled
breath. Those who work in cold environments should ask
the manufacturer about respirators for cold weather. Some
full-facepiece lenses are chemically treated during manufac￾turing to reduce fogging. A nose cup, which must be used
at temperatures below 32 ∘F, is available for many facepiece
respirators to keep the warm air away from the visor (50).
Valves and regulators should be carefully checked before the
respirator is used to ensure that they are functioning satisfac￾torily.
4.3.3 Corrective Lenses
Temple bars on eyeglasses interfere with the seal of full￾facepiece respirators and are not acceptable. Eyeglass kits
are available from all manufacturers for use with full face￾pieces. If half and quarter facepieces interfere with proper
seating of eyeglasses, the respirator fit is not satisfactory, and
either another respirator or another style of eyeglass must
be selected. This is one reason why it is important to wear
required eye protection when fit testing quarter- and half￾facepiece respirators.
4.3.4 Communications
Communication through a facepiece can be difficult, and
trying to speak loudly may affect the face seal. There are
several devices available to assist the respirator wearer. Some
respirators have built-in speaking diaphragms. Although they
are protected, care must be taken that thin wire or hot sparks
do not pierce the thin diaphragm. Wireless units are available
that can be placed inside full-facepiece respirators for radio
communication. Throat and ear microphones are also avail￾able. None of these units require penetration of the facepiece
that can affect the respirator approval. Use of any electrical
device must also consider potential explosive problems if
flammable vapors are present.

1 INTRODUCTION
Chemical protective clothing (CPC) prevents hazardous
chemicals from contacting the skin. These hazardous chem￾ical can cause skin irritation, burns or sensitization or affect
internal organs. The skin is a significant “route of entry” for
hazardous chemicals. The hazardous chemicals can move
through the skin into the bloodstream leading to acute or
systemic toxic effects.
A glove or garment material may protect very well against
one chemical but perform poorly against another chem￾ical. These chemicals can selectively degrade, penetrate, or
permeate the material. This underlines the importance of
determining the risks and the resistance of protective clothing
materials for each chemical of interest.
Chemical resistance is not the only requirements in selec￾tion of the most appropriate CPC. For suits, heat stress,
mobility, and coverage are important considerations while
for gloves dexterity, cut resistance, and tactility are some
important requirements.
1.1 How to Select the Most Appropriate
Chemical Protective Clothing
This section contains several important factors to consider
when selecting the most appropriate CPC for the work to
be performed. This checklist (Table 1) is not only limited to
the selection process but also includes use, care and mainte￾nance, and disposal of CPC.
Much of the information in this chapter includes selected parts from Quick Selection

1.1.1 Permeation, Penetration, and Degradation
Permeation, penetration, and degradation are the factors to
consider when determining chemical resistance of materials
used in CPC. Chemical can degrade (damage) a material
reducing the ability to prevent chemical contact. Chemicals
can penetrate through pores or holes in the material. Or
chemical can permeate a material by diffusion on a molecular
level. While degradation and penetration generally can be
observed, permeation may not be readily noticeable since it
occurs on a molecular or microscopic level. This process is
represented by the illustration shown in Figure 1.
The time taken by the chemical to pass through the protec￾tive material until it is first detected is called the breakthrough
time. The test for permeation and breakthrough time is repre￾sented by the illustration shown in Figure 2. The rate or speed
of the movement of the chemical through the protective mate￾rial, once it has broken through, is called the permeation rate.
Tears, rips, pinholes, and other damage or manufacturing
defects can result in penetration of the chemical. Penetration
is defined as the bulk flow of chemical through physical
spaces of the barrier material. Penetration may not be always
visible to the naked eye.
The three factors, permeation, penetration, and degra￾dation determine the chemical resistance of CPC. For
many chemicals, permeation is the most important factor in
determining chemical resistance. Penetration is useful for
determining the quality of the material and manufacturing
process. However, if the material degrades in the presence of
the hazardous chemical, there is not protection. Permeation
testing can often but not always detect degradation since the

test methods are described in Section 5.
1.1.2 The Selection Process
CPC selection is a process that normally should be based
on a number of factors. Some uses of protective clothing
that involve unique situations or very serious hazards will

require a detailed analysis of the tasks to be completed and
perhaps expert assistance in making the selection. However,
the general process for selection can be simply stated as in
Table 1. In all, there are seven key questions to consider in
the selection process.
1. Can the work be done without CPC?
2. What type of exposure is most likely to occur?
252CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING
3. What are the adverse effects of contact with the chem￾ical?
4. What are the required physical properties?
5. What is the chemical resistance required?
6. What human factors are necessary?
7. What is the cost of use?
The first important question to be answered in the selec￾tion processes is whether or not CPC even needs to be used.
This includes a consideration of other options, such as the
replacement of the chemical with a less harmful one, the use
of tools or other techniques to reduce or eliminate the need
to be in proximity to the chemical(s), a redesign of the job, or
the use of robotics. Even if CPC must be used for economic,
feasibility, or other reasons, it may still be possible to reduce
the level of hazard that the situation presents through a
combination of administrative, engineering, or other control
methods along with the use of CPC.
Determining the type of exposure most likely to occur is
important in the selection of CPC. A job where the contact
is likely to be immersion in a solvent may require a different
approach from the one where contact is minimal and limited
to an accidental splash. Following are the typical categories
of contact or exposure potential:
• Immersion (continuous or intermittent)
• Spray (pressurized or nonpressurized; direction)
• Splash (continuous, intermittent, or not expected; direc￾tion)
• Surface contact (continuous or intermittent)
• Mist (continuous or intermittent)
• Vapors (gaseous contact).
In all cases, the CPC should protect the user from the
effects of contact with the chemical. For example, job tasks
with the potential for contact in the form of a pressurized
spray (from a source that is under pressure) should include
the requirement for sealing all exposed surfaces against pene￾tration including any mist or vapor penetration.
An assessment of the adverse health effects from chem￾ical contact is the most important factor in the determination
of the right CPC to use once it is decided that CPC should
be used. This should include the general toxicity and other
hazards from the chemical (e.g. fire hazard) with an emphasis
on the local effects on the skin (effects of skin contact such
as chemical burns, corrosion, staining, irritation, etc.) and the
systemic effects of chemicals that might permeate the skin
and enter the bloodstream. Obviously, the more harmful the
effects of chemical contact are, the more protection the user
needs and the more important the proper selection becomes.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and several
other agencies such as the National Institute for Occupa￾tional Safety and Health (NIOSH) have developed a selec￾tion scheme for personal protective equipment for hazardous
waste operations and emergency response by level of protec￾tion required. Their scheme consists of four levels designated
by the letters A, B, C, and D. The following list summarizes
this scheme.
Level A. Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or
positive pressure airline system (PPAS) with escape
SCBA and totally encapsulating chemical protective
garment capable of holding air and preventing inward
vapor leakage, gas-tight ensemble with gloves (double
layer), chemically resistant boots, plus other safety
equipment.
Level B. SCBA or PPAS with escape SCBA and chemical
resistant suit, gloves (double layer), chemically resis￾tant boots, plus other safety equipment. The suit may
or may not be encapsulating.
Level C. Full-face or half-mask air-purifying respirator
and chemical resistant suit, gloves (double layer),
chemically resistant boots, plus other safety equip￾ment. Encapsulating suits cannot be worn with air￾purifying respirators.
Level D. No respiratory protection and “coveralls” with
an option for gloves, boots, boot coverings, and other
related safety equipment.
These standard ensembles represent only two major
options in terms of CPC: totally encapsulating suits and
other chemically protective clothing. Encapsulating refers
to the covering of the respiratory equipment as well as the
body. Most industrial situations require a much more specific
selection of protective clothing. This is usually much easier
to accomplish since the chemicals and exposure situations
are better known.
The physical resistance and properties required must be
determined. The best chemically resistant material will be
ineffective if torn, cut, punctured, or otherwise damaged.
In addition, contamination within protective clothing can
actually be worse than normal contact since the chemical
can be held against the skin for long periods of time. Many
of the materials, which offer excellent chemical resistance,
may offer poor resistance to abrasions, cuts, and punctures.
By using gloves, for example, possible solutions to this
problem are double gloving (use of two different gloves on
the same hand), the use of gloves, which are composed of
more than one compound (e.g. dipped gloves), or the use of
multilayered gloves. Some of the physical resistance factors
to consider before evaluating chemical resistance needed are
• abrasion resistance
• cut resistance
• puncture resistance
253PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
• tear strength
• tensile strength
• flammability
• resistance to the effects of heat and cold.
Some other physical properties to consider for articles of
protective clothing are closure strength (zippers, etc.), seam
strength, bursting strength, flexibility, weight, and thermal
insulation. The exact properties desired will depend on the
hazards of the work and the requirements of the job to be
performed.
Wearing CPC is not a trivial task. The wearers must
be trained in properly putting on (donning) and removing
(doffing) the garment. This may involve a second person
to help dress and undress the wearer. Wearers should work
in teams with backup ready to extract the first team if an
emergency occurs. Wearers have to be physically fit. Heat
stress must be monitored and managed. Exposed wears must
be adequately decontaminated before doffing the garment
and the contaminated garments must be properly handled.
The chemical resistance of the protective clothing against
the hazardous material must be determined. Manufactures
and resources such as the Quick Selection Guide to Chem￾ical Protective Clothing provided guidance on the efficacy
of various materials against a range of chemicals. The stan￾dard test method measures the material’s resistance to direct
liquid or gaseous contact. For most situations, the laboratory
test represents a “worst-case” scenario. Interrupted contact or
splashes with the chemical may lengthen the breakthrough
time. On the other hand, the laboratory-generated chem￾ical permeation data may not always reflect conditions in
the workplace. Elevated temperatures, flexing, pressure, and
tears, may reduce the breakthrough time significantly.
Very little is known about the relationship between the
breakthrough of protective clothing and human toxicity when
permeation rates are extremely low. However, once the
chemical has permeated the barrier material, the risk of toxi￾city is dependent on skin penetration and the inherent toxi￾city of the chemical. For protection against most potentially
hazardous materials, usage of CPC that offers at least four
or eight hours of breakthrough resistance provides a very
conservative margin of protection. In some cases, finding a
barrier that offers breakthrough resistance of at least four
hours will not be possible. The user should use the CPC for a
shorter time, that is, up to one hour or less. In these situations,
it is best to review brand-specific permeation data to make
the choice of the most chemically resistant CPC. Manufac￾turers’ web sites are a good source of current information on
the chemical and physical resistances of their products.
For those chemicals that have not been tested, some gener￾alizations can be made about their ability to permeate various
barriers based on their chemical class. However, caution
must be exercised since the only way to be sure of the perfor￾mance of CPC is to test it against the chemical of interest.
Mixtures of chemical substances are another complicating
factor. They are commonly encountered, but little data exist
on the performance of protective materials against mixtures.
They do not always behave as might be expected in terms
of permeation behavior. Again, the best approach to this
problem is to have the mixture actually tested.
The usability of the CPC must be considered. Human
factors (ergonomics) are those factors, which affect our
ability to accomplish our jobs in an efficient and effective
manner. Ideally, CPC should make us more productive and
our work easier. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Can
the job be accomplished wearing CPC? In most cases, the
use of CPC at any level will increase errors and decrease
productivity. The CPC can even present safety hazards (e.g.
get caught in machinery) that would not exist without the use
of it.
Probably the three major human factor problems in the
use of CPC are proper sizing, heat stress, and the loss of the
senses (tactile), such as touch and feel. Sizing is important to
be able to function properly while heat stress is common to
any article of protective clothing that offers good chemical
resistance. Finally, with increases in thickness in gloves and
hence chemical resistance, there is a corresponding decrease
in dexterity, touch, and feel. The best prevention for human
factor related problems is to try several different approaches,
products, and materials to determine which combination
works best for the user.
The last factor is the cost. This is not because it is least
important (nor is it most important). The reason for listing
cost in the factors to be considered is that it is always an
important factor, but not the single most important factor.
First, the “best” selection of CPC is a result of considering
many factors such as those previously listed in this section.
The best selection may not be the most chemically resistant
material. Like generic drugs, there may be materials that
offer more than adequate resistance at a much lower cost
than some “name brand” product. Therefore, cost should be
considered and given an equal weight with the other factors
listed in this section.
Additional expertise and resource are available to
adequately evaluate all of the factors listed in this section.
Most vendors of CPC provide information on the perfor￾mance of their products against national and international
consensus tests and standards for protective clothing. Many
of these vendors also offer technical assistance in the proper
selection, use, and maintenance of their products without
charge. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
has developed minimum standards for the performance of
protective clothing used in hazardous material emergencies.
These have application for some industrial uses as well.
They are listed in Section 5.2.
Compliance with NFPA standards requires third-party
certification and independent testing. Those products
254CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING
meeting the battery of NFPA performance requirements are
labeled as meeting the applicable standard. In Europe, a
series of six levels of protection is available under European
Committee for Standardization (Comité Européen de
Normalisation) (CEN) standards.
In summary, there are several key factors to be consid￾ered when selecting CPC. They include a determination as
to whether other options are available for control of expo￾sures, determining the type of exposure and toxicity of the
chemicals to be used, determining the physical and chemical
resistances needed, determining what is required from the
protective clothing to be able to perform the job, and finally
a consideration of costs in the final selection.
1.1.3 Eleven Important Considerations for the Selection
and Use of Chemical Protective Clothing
The following are the 11 important considerations for the
selection and use of CPC.
1. All chemicals pass or permeate through protective
barriers sooner or later. Remember, permeation can
take place without any visible evidence or change in
the protective materials. Color changes or changes in
texture, as well as hardening or softening of protective
barriers after use, usually indicate degradation.
2. Even the best protective clothing products will not
perform properly if they are torn, cut, or damaged.
You should always inspect protective clothing before
and after each use. The integrity of gloves can be
checked for leaks by air inflation or by filling with
water (in the latter case they will then need to be
dried). Garments should be inspected with a strong
light to detect inspect for imperfections or breaks
in the barrier or seams. Gas-tight totally encapsu￾lated suits may require pressure testing. If the protec￾tive equipment becomes torn or damaged, it should
be replaced. Contaminated garment should not be
worn.
3. A barrier may protect against one chemical very well
but perform poorly against another or a mixture of
chemicals. Each chemical and material combination
must be considered. No single protective material is
an absolute barrier against all chemicals.
4. Recommendations are generally based on tests, which
have been performed at room temperature. Higher
temperatures usually decrease the breakthrough time
of chemicals.
5. Generally, thicker is better. Increasing the thickness of
the protective article, such as a glove, will normally
increase the time to breakthrough, but the benefits
may be offset by a decrease in tactility and dexterity.
The use of multiple layers (e.g. double gloving) can
increase thickness and provide desirable properties of
different materials.
6. Chemical resistant gloves and other CPC may all look
alike. Be sure that the material being used is the right
one for the job being done. Do not depend only on
the appearance or color of the material since most
barriers are available in many different forms and
colors.
7. Once the barrier material has absorbed a chemical, it
will continue to permeate (pass through) the material.
If the protective material has been contaminated to
the point of breakthrough, it must be decontaminated
before it may be used again or properly discarded.
Chemical resistant gloves are normally intended for
use from a period of 15 minutes up to eight hours.
They cannot be reused when handling hazardous
chemicals.
Once a material is exposed, the clock does not stop.
A barrier of greater than eight hours does not mean
one hour for each of eight days. It means eight hours
after the initial exposure.
8. Many recommendations have been made on a generic
basis; that is, the materials are shown by their common
or generic name. Most of the polymer formulations
vary by manufacturer and can vary from product lot
to product lot. Research has shown this variation in
chemical resistance can be significant for neoprene,
nitrile, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Users should
check with the manufacturers’ web sites for the test
results. Some of the manufactures may not report the
results of all chemical tests, so contact the manufac￾turer directly if there are questions.
9. Some protective clothing has a shelf-life and/or
requires special storage measures, such as the
avoidance of sunlight, ozone, or moisture. Check
with the manufacturers’ instructions for the proper
storage, maintenance, and care. Also, remember
that alterations to suits or equipment may void the
manufactures’ warranty and change the performance
of the equipment.
10. Very thin, ultra-lightweight synthetic rubber gloves
are available for medical application where users
have allergies to natural rubber medical gloves. These
disposable gloves have much shorter breakthrough
time and poorer physical properties than much thicker
gloves made of the same materials.
11. Chemicals, which are highly corrosive, can change the
barrier material properties through degradation before
stated breakthrough times. The barrier material can
become hard and brittle.

EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION

1 INTRODUCTION
Control banding (CB) is a complementary approach to
protecting worker health that arose in the mid to late 1990s
and has become more mainstream in professional practice
over the past decade. CB strategies offer simplified solu￾tions for controlling worker exposures to constituents that
are found in the workplace in the absence of firm toxico￾logical and exposure data. Learning the history of CB and
its evolution over time is essential for the understanding
of its growing role in practice. The most significant force
in the development of CB was the recognition that there
were increasing limitations of the more traditional process
for controlling worker exposures to chemicals (i.e. estab￾lishing occupational exposure limits (OELs) against which
measurements of airborne concentrations of contaminants
could be compared). This style of approach was losing
ground due to the increasing number of chemicals being
created, thus posing a threat to worker health. Associated
with this change were the legal challenges to the process
of developing standards. Also problematic was the lack of
understanding of this approach on the part of workers and
of operators of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
SMEs are smaller businesses that typically employ fewer
than 50 or 100 employees and, therefore, often lack the finan￾cial resources to conduct toxicological and epidemiological
research to establish the OELs and to collect and analyze
samples. The utility of the CB approach has been recognized
by corporations, national and international organizations,
Patty’s Industrial Hygiene, Seventh Edition. Edited by Barbara Cohrssen.

and is considered a practical approach for the prevention of
work-related risks in developing countries. Although devel￾oping countries have fewer human and financial resources to
invest in protecting worker health and have a working popu￾lation far more susceptible to public health issues, when it
comes to protecting workers from workplace exposures, they
face many of the same challenges as developed countries (1).
1.1 Brief Description of CB
CB is a qualitative (2) or semiquantitative (3) approach to
risk assessment and risk management that groups occupa￾tional risk control strategies into bands based on their level
of rigor. For example, the United Kingdom Health and Safety
Executive (UK HSE) Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health (COSHH) Essentials CB strategy includes four levels
for controlling exposures to chemicals: (i) good occupa￾tional hygiene practices, including personal protective equip￾ment (PPE), (ii) engineering controls, including local exhaust
ventilation (LEV), (iii) containment, and (iv) the need to seek
specialist advice (4). CB is the stratification of work-related
risks into “bands” that have each been assigned controls
based on the potential hazard and, in some cases, the poten￾tial for exposure. Most CB strategies focus resources on
the prevention of worker exposure to chemical substances
purchased and used in bulk form, either liquids or powders
used in larger quantities. However, CB approaches have
grown well beyond these bulk chemical origins and now
269PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
are applied into the broader occupational safety, health, and
hygiene (OSHH) realm. This new growth provides utility
for even seasoned industrial hygiene (IH) professionals as
the list now includes CB applications for nanomaterials,
ergonomics, safety, environmental, construction, as well as
a comprehensive framework for occupational risk manage￾ment (ORM). A potential hazard may be captured by risk
phrases (5) (previously known as “R-phrases” and now
known as “Hazard Statements” (6, 7) or other indicators of
toxicity or hazardous properties. Exposure potential, when
used as a component of CB toolkits, may be based on quan￾tity in use, volatility or dustiness, and frequency and duration
of exposure. Other CB strategies focus on the dynamics of
the task performed to directly assign PPE and control options
without the interim step of assessing potential exposure (thus
providing “direct advice”).
1.2 Terminology
As used in this chapter, CB is a strategy that is based on work￾place hazards, the potential for exposure, and the simplified
solutions for controlling exposures to the constituents typi￾cally encountered in the workplace. CB strategies are often
found in singular applications known as toolkits, a narrowly
defined solutions approach for the control of worker expo￾sures within a limited range of hazards, as well as in a broader
and often multidisciplinary toolbox as a more widely defined
solutions approach for the control of worker exposures across
multiple tasks. Many toolkits will fit within a toolbox. The
word “scheme” is used frequently throughout the discussion
of CB, especially in Europe, and is used without negative
connotations in this chapter.
1.3 Scope and Objectives
The scope of this chapter includes CB strategies for
addressing solutions to work-related chemical exposures,
with limited reference to other toolkits in a proposed ORM
toolbox. Chapter objectives are to
• establish the basis for CB approaches,
• describe the history and evolution of CB,
• review the validation and verification of CB strategies,
• evaluate CB and its growth internationally, and
• provide practical examples, lessons learned, and recom￾mendations for CB implementation.
CB has now become an accepted approach to manage￾ment of occupational exposures to chemicals and other
hazards; therefore, this chapter balances a strong emphasis
on peer-reviewed literature with a practical basis for applying
these strategies for both new and experienced IHs. This
approach presents a focus on the origins of CB and an
overview of validation and verification of CB models, as
well as the expansion of CB strategies internationally while
providing practical examples of CB as applied in prac￾tice. Readers who wish to learn how to conduct CB anal￾yses should consult AIHA Guideline 9-2007, Guidance for
Conducting Control Banding Analyses, prepared by the
AIHA Control Banding Working Group (8).
2 PART I: ESTABLISHING THE BASIS
FOR CONTROL BANDING
APPROACHES
2.1 Challenges to the Traditional OEL
Approach
The “traditional approach” to protecting worker health was
pioneered in the late nineteenth century, when the first OELs
were established in Germany in 1886 or 1887 (9). The first
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygien￾ists Threshold Limit Values® (ACGIH® TLV®) document
was published in 1946 (10). In the following decades, this
quantitative approach was adopted by many of the industrial￾ized nations, and as a result, contributed to the improvement
of working conditions, increased span and quality of life for
countless workers, and decreased compensation costs. The
problem of protecting worker health continues to grow with
the increasing number of hazardous chemicals in produc￾tion and a fairly static number of OELs. In 2018, nearly
90 000 chemical registration dossiers were submitted under
the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and
Restriction of Chemicals substances (REACH) regulations
(11). In the European Economic Community, only about
1000 OELs have been established for chemical substances
(12), with the HSE having OELs for ∼600 substances (13);
yet over 100 000 substances are traded in the European
Community (14). The problem is equally daunting in the
United States, where the American Chemical Society (ACS)
Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry contained
17 688 891 organic and inorganic substances (15). Further￾more, OELs are not consistent across the authoritative bodies
that set them in Europe or the United States. Of the 1341
substances that had an OEL established by at least one of 18
authoritative bodies, more than one-third of the substances
have an OEL set by only one authoritative body and less
than 2% were mentioned by all 18 authoritative bodies (16).
Because the human and financial resources to estab￾lish and implement quantitative OELS were and still are
limited, particularly in SMEs and the less-developed and
economically developing countries (EDCs), it is becoming
more apparent that the quantitative OEL approach alone will
never solve the problem of protecting workers from chemical
exposures on an international basis (16).
270CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
As a result of these challenges, individual companies,
trade associations, and government agencies have devel￾oped innovative approaches to protecting both worker health
and the environment. The chemical industries provided an
early example of qualitative/semiquantitative methods to
assess health and safety risks from catastrophic failures at
major chemical facilities (17), sometimes using decision
matrices to achieve these goals. The pharmaceutical industry
is shifting from utilization of air and wipe sampling to docu￾ment worker exposure, to the use of air and wipe sampling
to verify the efficacy of operation controls. Environmental
monitoring thus assumes the role of documenting the results
of the risk assessment cycle (18).
2.2 The UK Experience: Response
to COSHH Regulations
In the late 1980s, the UK HSE passed the COSHH regula￾tions, requiring, inter alia, employers to perform risk assess￾ments for all chemicals used in the workplace (19). Despite
much optimism that these regulations would “bring greater
emphasis on the assessment of risks to health in industry”
(20), there were many challenges to their effective imple￾mentation (21). Despite some reports of programs devel￾oped by employers to meet COSHH requirements (22), an
unpublished survey of 2000 companies showed “widespread
ignorance of the new regulations and their implications
among smaller concerns …” (23). There were frequent
reports on the deficiencies and needs of many workplaces
in complying with COSHH, for example, particularly in
health care settings (24–31). These authors stressed require￾ments to inform and train staff, evaluate risks, monitor expo￾sures, and implement control measures. Similarly, despite
the number of sensitizing agents present, relatively few hair￾dressing establishments had attempted to comply with the
1988 COSHH regulations (32). Problems in this industry
were reported with contact dermatitis in hydrotherapy pools
due to inappropriate application of the COSHH risk assess￾ment principles (33).
To better understand the problems with implementation of
COSHH, UK HSE conducted market research to characterize
industry’s perception of OELs and the degree to which deci￾sions on control measures were affected by OELs (13, 34).
A thousand randomly selected chemical users and 150 health
and safety representatives of trade unions were interviewed
by telephone about chemical use, sources of information,
risk management, and understanding of COSHH and OELs.
The majority (75%) of respondents were from small firms
(<10 employees), mirroring the makeup of British industry;
although most trade union representatives were from firms
with >100 employees. It was found that even though larger
chemical companies and OSH professionals understood the
COSHH requirements, “many small firms wanted to be told
exactly what they need, and do not need, to do.” The UK HSE
concluded that, given the widespread lack of understanding
and sphere of influence of OELs, generation of additional
lists of OELs would not be cost effective and that OELs
should be limited to widely used substances of concern (13).
These findings are most likely applicable to the United
States, as the employment composition of businesses in the
United States is similar to that in the United Kingdom.
In the United States, 98% (6.3 million establishments) of
businesses have fewer than 100 workers with more than
half (56%) of the American workforce being employed
in these SMEs (35). In the United Kingdom, of the 3.8
million businesses, 99% have less than 200 workers; 69%
are self-employed; and 20% have 1–4 employees. One-third
(34%) use chemicals, and 47% are uncertain of how to get
applicable compliance information (personal communica￾tion from Ref. (36)). In the European Union (EU) overall,
SMEs account for over 99% of all businesses and employ
more than 65% of the workforce (37).
The UK HSE was faced with the realization that there
were many substances for which OELs would never be devel￾oped and that the majority of SMEs did not understand and
did not have the resources to meet the COSHH requirements
to conduct risk assessments for chemicals used in the work￾place. In response, the HSE established a working group of
key stakeholders to develop a simple system for generic risk
assessment (34). This approach, which leads to selection of
appropriate controls, was first published as COSHH Essen￾tials: easy steps to control chemicals (38).
2.3 The Global Experience: What About
the Others?
About 90%, or approximately 2.3 billion, of the world’s
workers, do not have access to OSHH professionals and
traditional quantitative risk assessment methods to control
and reduce exposures to chemical and physical agents and
achieve prevention from acquiring work-related illnesses,
diseases, and safety-related injuries (39, 40). Although
risk factors for work-related illness and disease are well
known, simple economics frequently prevent the allocation
of adequate resources to OSHH, in both developing and
developed countries.
3 PART II: HISTORY AND EVOLUTION
OF CONTROL BANDING
3.1 The Origins of CB
CB has its roots in several qualitative and semiquantitative
risk assessment (SQRA) approaches, which began to appear
271PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
in the 1970s (17, 41, 42). An example would be a risk matrix
describing the likelihood and probable severity of event
(e.g. explosion or release of toxic material, developed for
use by a chemical company). Historically, these approaches
borrowed from each other and built upon previous efforts
(17) and that it is not always possible to trace the steps by
relying on chronological appearance in the peer-reviewed
literature. The developers and authors undoubtedly knew
one another and there was much exchange of informa￾tion and ideas among occupational health practitioners and
scientists in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries,
governmental agencies, and professional and trade associa￾tions (43). Discussion of key components and contributions
follows.
The developers of the early CB approaches recognized the
need for consistent, accurate results among different nonex￾pert (those without IH technical expertise) users. Money (17)
outlined six core principles that have been incorporated in
most CB approaches:
1. Approaches must be understandable by users and by
those affected, allowing the tools to both evaluate and
communicate risk.
2. The required information must be readily available to
the user, particularly SMEs, for example, by safety data
sheets (SDSs).
3. The output must be practical advice.
4. The tool must be “user-friendly.”
5. Users must have confidence in the tool.
6. Output must be provided in a transparent and consistent
way.
3.2 Simple Measures of Toxicity
The earliest approaches were based on toxicity of substances
encountered in the workplace, and according to the core prin￾ciples outlined above, would thus require simple, readily
available information on the toxicity of these substances. In
1991, Gardner and Oldershaw suggested the use of European
risk phrases to provide a simple measure of the toxicity of
substances (12, 44). In presenting their comparison of the
United Kingdom, American (ACGIH TLVs), and German
OELS to the designated risk phrases for volatile organic
substances (45), they concluded that the risk phrases, while
emphatically not OELs, could, when other information was
lacking, be used as Pragmatic Exposure Control Concen￾trations (PECCs) for controlling inhalation exposure. This
guidance would be useful to users who had neither adequate
toxicological data on substances, nor ability to develop or
understand such data.
3.3 Occupational Exposure Bandings
Another important component in the development of CB
approaches was the concept of controlling airborne concen￾trations to a range or band of values, rather than a single point
value. Spurred by COSHH regulations requiring employers
to control exposures to “a level to which nearly all the popula￾tion could be exposed, day after day, without adverse effects
on health,” the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry (ABPI) provided guidance on occupational expo￾sure bands (OEBs) and OELs for its members (46, 47). The
pharmaceutical industry has typically been faced with many
situations in which there are insufficient data to develop
OELs (48), such as during new-product development, for
intermediate products, and for products with limited phar￾macological and toxicological data. The level of exposure
guidance recommended (i.e. occupational exposure banding
[OEB] or OEL) would vary with the stage of product devel￾opment and toxicity testing. As an example, the process of
setting OELs might begin with consideration of an OEB at
the end of the research and development phase when short￾term toxicity and in vitro tests had been completed (see
Table 1), and continue with refinement of the OEB or devel￾opment of a health-based OEL at the transfer-to-production
stage, when long-term toxicity, pharmacological, and clin￾ical tests had been completed. Review and confirmation of
the OEL would occur at the routine manufacture phase. As
discussed below (Section 6.2.1), a comparable concept of
OEBs would later come back into use through National Insti￾tute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH for chemical
exposures.
3.4 Linking Toxicological Data with
Appropriate Levels of Control
In an early, perhaps the first, published report in which
toxicological data were linked to an appropriate level of
control, Money (49) presented a structured approach to
design and operation of a fine chemical plant, based on a
carcinogenic ranking system for aromatic amines and nitro
compounds. This was a broad approach for ensuring that

appropriate measures would be in place to control risks from
these chemicals from both routine and abnormal operations;
however, it did not provide specific solutions and controls.
Four categories of carcinogenic potential were linked with
four levels of controls, which progressed in their complexity
and stringency, each level building on the previous. After
consideration of elimination and/or substitution of carcino￾gens, the following levels would be utilized for the various
levels of carcinogenicity.
• Level 1. For all chemicals, good basic IH, with a facility
built to sound industrial standards.
• Level 2. For suspected animal carcinogens of low to
moderate potency, greater reliability and integrity than
Level 1, plus isolation of the plant by physical or proce￾dural measures, and possibly with health management
systems.
• Level 3. For suspected human carcinogens with slight
carcinogenicity to animals, or proven or suspect animal
carcinogens, at moderate and low doses, respectively, a
segregated plant with detoxification, high reliability and
containment, and regular technical audits.
• Level 4. For proven human, suspect human/highly
carcinogenic to animals, or proven or suspected animal
carcinogens, at low to very low doses, respectively,
an automated plant with bulk or semi-bulk transfers,
process control, and plant audits.

recommendations for each hazard category – were further
explored by the Chemical Industries Association (CIA)
(50) in their guidelines for safe handling of colorants
(second version), and their 1997 guidelines on OEBs (51).
These guidelines provided a simple, broad-based, integrated
approach for use by CIA members in classifying hazards,
based on OEBs that defined the upper limit of acceptable
exposure (see Tables 2 and 3).
Recognized needs included (i) reclassification of
substances if/when more data became available, (ii)
consideration of other routes of exposure, (iii) require￾ments for health surveillance and IH measurements for
substances with limited toxicological data, and (iv) testing
to provide a high degree of confidence in the predicted
OEBs (52).
Throughout the 1990s, much work was being conducted
on predicting exposures (53); however, at this juncture, no
one had yet factored the probability of exposure into the risk
assessment and risk management equation.
273PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
3.5 Hazard + Exposure → Risk → Control
Strategy
The concepts and principles that had been developing since
the 1970s were combined in the late 1990s to result in a
simple but powerful concept:
Health Hazard + Exposure Potential
→ Generic Risk Assessment → Control Strategy
The UK HSE played a pivotal role in developing a regu￾latory approach based on these concepts (51, 54, 55). While
the work of the HSE was based on that of the UK CIA (52,
56), which categorized substances into OEBs, it is apparent
from the preceding discussion that many other groups have
contributed to the development of COSHH Essentials. Based
on the membership lists of the various task forces, for
example, the CIA and the UK HSE, the authorship of many of
the chapters included in this review, and recollections of two
authors (DIN, DMZ), there was much communication within
professional circles regarding qualitative and semiquantita￾tive approaches to protecting worker health.
3.6 The COSHH Essentials Strategy
The earliest readily available, developed, and evaluated
CB model comes from the UK HSE, and is known as
COSHH Essentials. It was designed to help SMEs do the
risk assessments for chemicals and mixtures of chemicals
that employers were required to perform under the COSHH
regulations. This led to the developmental work conducted
by a working group established by the UK Health and Safety
Commission’s Advisory Committee on Toxic Substances
(34). The basic idea is that while there are thousands of
chemicals, there are only a few levels of risk management
(control bands) available to control worker exposures to
these chemicals. The user is guided through a simple risk
assessment based on the type of task, the hazard of the
chemical (which is assigned to hazard band A through E),
the volatility (3 levels) or dustiness (3 levels) of the chemical
or product, and the amount used in the task (3 levels). The
system then steps the user through a simple matrix that
immediately points to the level of risk management (or
control band) based on this information. It provides specific
guidance in the form of a Control Guidance Sheet (CGS)
for the task being conducted and the recommended control
band based on the 4-level strategy outlined above. COSHH
Essentials remains available in an electronic database format
as a simplified approach on the internet (4). A series of
articles on the “UK Scheme to Help Small Firms Control
Health Risks from Chemicals” in 1998 explored the basic
concepts (51), the toxicological considerations (55), and
IH considerations (54). The challenge facing the HSE was

to develop guidance that was practical for SMEs, used
available hazard information, was easy to use and under￾stand, and which relied upon readily available information
(see Figure 1). The HSE realized that these goals could
be achieved by using R-phrases and simple predictors of
exposure to conduct a generic risk assessment, which leads
to straightforward recommendations on risk management,
that is, control approaches (Table 4).
3.6.1 Basic Concepts
The COSHH Essentials approach, as it later came to be
known as, builds on earlier approaches (12, 49, 56–60), but
adds two other significant developments: it is specifically
developed for SMEs and it includes control advice in the
form of CGSs. This is a significant difference, as most earlier
CB approaches were intended for expert use (1). The key
components of the model include the hazard banding, expo￾sure potential, and control approaches. Hazard banding is
described more fully below (55). It is important to point out,
however, that COSHH Essentials is limited to substances
classified under the British chemical hazard information
and packaging regulations (CHIP), thereby excluding, for
example, pesticides and pharmaceuticals, which are outside
the scope of those regulations, and also process-generated
hazards such as wood dust, silica dust, and welding fumes
(tending now to be covered by specific guidance, see below).
Exposure banding is a function of physical properties leading
to likeliness for the material to become airborne (volatility of
liquids or dustiness of solids), and the quantity in use (54).
These elements are combined to determine the appropriate
control approach (see Figure 2).
A key point from Russell et al. (51) should be quoted
directly as it a common misperception that CB was devel￾oped to replace existing quantitative methods:
“However, the use of the scheme will not in itself
constitute a suitable and sufficient workplace risk
assessment as required by regulation 6 of COSHH.

Control approach 1 – General ventilation. Good standard of general ventilation
and good working practices.
Control approach 2 – Engineering control. Ranging from LEV to ventilated

Control approach 3 – Containment. Containment or enclosure, allowing for limited,

Employers should still consider other factors in their
risk assessments, such as the need for health surveil￾lance and the need to monitor exposure to ensure
adequacy of control. Similarly, they will want to
consider the suitability of the controls recommended
by the scheme for their particular work situation. The
scheme is therefore guidance to aid employers’ risk
assessment and selection of control measures, not a
replacement for it …”
Russell et al. (51) recognized that an overprotective
approach would lack credibility and would deter promotional
efforts and implementation (51). On the other hand, an under￾protective approach would not protect workers. Weighing
these factors, it was generally agreed in the model develop￾ment that a conservative approach would be the most respon￾sible.
3.6.2 Toxicological Considerations
Brooke (55) outlined three criteria for the toxicological basis
of the UK approach: (i) it had to be simple and transparent,
so that it would be understandable and consistently used
by SMEs, (ii) it had to make best use of available hazard
information, and (iii) recommended control strategies had to
vary according to degree of health hazard of a substance.
The R-phrases (currently known as Hazard Statements,
though part of this historical development) that were agreed
to throughout the EU (5) facilitated these criteria, as they
address all relevant toxicological endpoints. This idea had
been proposed previously (12) and had formed the basis of
similar strategies (48, 56, 57).
R-phrases and resulting target airborne concentrations for
111 substances were compared to the relevant health-based
OELs on national lists (the United Kingdom and German
MAK), utilizing the R-phrases leading to the most strin￾gent controls, and representing the same endpoint used for
the OEL. For 33 solids (100%), the OEL was within or
higher than the target airborne concentration range of the
hazard band. For 76 liquids (97%), the OEL was within or
higher than the target airborne concentration range. While
concluding that the R-phrases can be used effectively to allo￾cate substances to hazard bands, Brooke stressed that the
process is not intended to substitute for the health-based OEL
setting process.
Brooke understood the critical role of R-phrases in the
COSHH Essentials approach, stressing that “the success of
the scheme is crucially dependent on the accurate classifica￾tion of substances by suppliers.” The accuracy of this process
has not been evaluated; however, concerns have been raised
about the accuracy of the EU’s classification of chemical
substances (61). (Equally important to widespread imple￾mentation of CB strategies is the effort to standardize the
categorization of hazards, a primary objective of the global
harmonization initiative discussed below.)
3.6.3 IH Considerations
Money’s criteria for a successful CB approach (17) appear
to have been uppermost in the minds of the developers of the
275PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
COSHH Essentials approach, especially the requirement that
the system be understandable by users, and that the required
information be readily available.
In writing about the development of the model, Maidment
(54) stressed the importance of limiting the number of factors
in the model to control its complexity and applicability. The
simplicity of the approach to exposure assessment in partic￾ular has been the source of much criticism of COSHH Essen￾tials; however, it must be remembered that a key objective
of the approach is that it be understandable by nontechnical
users.
Five steps were undertaken to develop the control
predictive model: (i) characterize control strategies, (ii)
characterize exposure potential (physical factors of solids
and liquids, operational factors), (iii) develop the exposure
predictive model, (iv) establish the relationship between
exposure potential and hazard band, and (v) substitute
hazard band for exposure potential and invert the model to
produce the control predictive model (54).
1. Control strategies were collapsed into four main
categories: Level 1, general ventilation; Level 2,
engineering containment such as LEV; Level 3,
containment; and Level 4, special controls (reserved
for experts).
2. Characteristics of exposure potential were summarized
as those related to physical properties (dustiness of
solids and the volatility of liquids) and those related
to substance handling (quantity in use). The working
group felt that three dustiness bands (low, medium,
high) would adequately describe the properties of dusts
and maintain the simplicity of the model. The volatility
of a liquid would be captured by consulting a graph
of boiling point (low, medium, high) versus operating
temperature. Substance handling was characterized as
small, medium, or large scale.
3. The exposure prediction model was developed by
combining bands for quantity in use and physical
exposure potential, resulting in four exposure predictor
bands each for solids and liquids.
4. The working group then compared the exposure
predictor bands against the predicted concentration
bands resulting from control strategies 1–3. These
allocations were later “validated either by comparison
with measured data or by wider peer review within the
British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS) and the
British Institute of Occupational Hygienists (BIOH)”
(54).
5. The final step was to invert the exposure predictive
model to a control predictive model by replacing the
exposure range in the exposure predictive model with
the hazard band. This produces an empirical model
that can be used to predict the appropriate control
strategy (CS) to achieve adequate control based on the
hazard and the exposure bands. A series of matrices
were then produced that allowed the user to select the
recommended CS level (1–4) based simply on the R￾phrase, the dustiness/volatility of the substance, and
the volume in use. Knowing the recommended control
level, the user could then obtain specific control advice
by selecting a CGS appropriate for the task at hand and
the recommended control level.
With these three chapters (51, 54, 55), the wider OSHH
community was thus introduced to the basics of the COSHH
Essentials approach. While this strategy leans heavily on
the work of historical models and approaches, it has several
unique features, including the online version that made a
CB toolkit globally accessible for the first time. It meets
all six of Money’s (17) core principles (understandability,
availability, practicality, user-friendliness, confidence on the
part of users, and transparent, consistent output). Despite
its attributes, however, it is subject to several limitations
relative to the development of the model, development of
databases, use of the model, and its validation and veri￾fication. Oldershaw (62) has cautioned that the COSHH
Essentials approach could not be adopted uncritically by
other countries; further, the approach must be seen in the
context of personal protection, training, and health surveil￾lance as appropriate. A key point is that the approach is
not meant to replace exposure measurement, interpretation,
substance, and chemical control, as emphasized by Russell
above as well.
3.6.4 Providing Control Guidance to Users
CGSs for both common and specialized tasks form a key
component of COSHH Essentials. Over 300 CGSs have been
published (63, 64). In addition, there are over 200 addi￾tional Direct Advice Sheets (DAS) covering many indus￾tries, including microelectronic chip manufacturing, offshore
oil, printing, welding, and construction work. Each CGS
and DAS is structured according to a standard format, and
contains sections on access, design and equipment, mainte￾nance, examination and testing, cleaning and housekeeping,
PPE, training, supervision, a short list of references, a sample
schematic of an engineering control, and an employee check￾list for proper utilization of controls. The Asbestos Essen￾tials series is a good example of the applications of the CB
strategy where direct advice can be given in the form of
CGSs, based on good control practice reached by consensus
of industry experts. These CGSs require no detailed data
input. They can be downloaded by selecting task sheets on
equipment and methods and activities, such as nonlicensed
work with asbestos cement, textured coatings, insulating
board, and other asbestos-containing materials (64).
276CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
The adoption of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS)
of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals has been an
important concept for expanding the reach of CB in a
standardized format within national regulations. The GHS is
a common and coherent approach to classifying the health,
physical, and environmental hazards of chemicals, and to
communicating the hazards through labels and SDSs. GHS
includes a core set of label elements and has harmonized
hazard statements (“H-statements,” formerly R-Phrases) for
each category and class of chemicals covered. It also has a
harmonized approach to classifying mixtures of these chem￾icals. Adopted by the United Nations in 2003, the GHS is
now aligned within legislation in 50 countries (28 within the
EU), partially implemented in 15 countries (including the
United States, Canada, and Mexico), and not yet addressed in
128 countries (65). Global implementation of the GHS would
thus provide an international system upon which to base CB.
This standardization of hazard statements for expanding the
reach of CB has already been implemented by regulation in
the EU and the United States (6, 7) and US OSHA is now
aligned with the Hazard Communication Standard with the
latest edition of GHS. The International Labour Organiza￾tion (ILO) has already included the GHS hazard categories
in its International Chemical Control Toolkit (ICCT) (66).
The International Chemical Safety Cards (>1700) prepared
under the International Program for Chemical Safety (IPCS)
have been modified to follow the GHS criteria for classi￾fication and the harmonized H-statements and are updated
periodically to account for the latest scientific developments,
providing a source of information on many of the most
commonly used chemicals (67).
4 PART III: VALIDATION
AND VERIFICATION OF CB
STRATEGIES
Before CB strategies can be accepted, adapted, and imple￾mented on a wide scale, a few issues must be addressed
regarding validation and verification. (In this chapter, vali￾dation refers to the many components related to accuracy
of the model itself, and verification refers to the correct
installation, operation, and maintenance of controls.) As has
been noted frequently, underprescription of control could
lead to serious injury, even death, while overprescription
could lead to significant unnecessary expense (51, 68). There
are multiple decision points in the application of CB that
may contribute to error; each step of the CB strategy should
be validated independently of the others, including issues
related to the creation of the model, application of the model,
and failure analyses at each step of the CB process (e.g.
assignment, reporting, and understanding of R-phrases/H￾statements, etc.).
Verification would include evaluating the installa￾tion/operation/use of controls to reduce exposures in specific
workroom situations through follow-up surveys. While
it would be useful to validate all the CB strategies that
have been proposed, the early validation efforts were quite
comprehensive and primarily had only two models readily
available for researching: COSHH Essentials and the ICCT
(68). Formerly known as the ILO Toolkit, this second model
was produced in collaboration with the UK HSE and the
International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA).
Based on COSHH Essentials, the ICCT incorporates the
GHS and is thus adapted for use worldwide.
4.1 Exposure Monitoring
Although the need for exposure monitoring within the
context of COSHH Essentials has been expressed by many
authors (51, 52, 62, 68), including its developers, it is
not necessary to conduct exposure monitoring to obtain
control advice from the model. Kromhout (69) took strong
exception to the lack of exposure monitoring in generic risk
assessment tools as they “… are known to be inaccurate
and they do not take into account the various components of
variability in exposure levels . . . .” Kromhout built a strong
case, estimating the variability in an 8-h shift to be between
3- and 4000-fold, and delineating the sources of variability
as spatial, between workers, and between groups (69–71).
4.2 Validation Studies
COSHH Essentials has been the subject of validation studies
in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States.
According to Maidment (54), the core model was validated
by comparison with measured data, and by extensive peer
review of the logic and content by experts. He noted that it
was extremely difficult to find quality data for comparisons
(a problem reported by other researchers), and further, that
the information describing control strategies often seemed
to indicate that several control strategies were in use. (Jones
and Nicas (72) similarly brought up the issue about informa￾tion lacking in historical reports, limiting the usefulness for
validation studies.)
The first and most complete external validation of the
COSHH Essentials to date was conducted by Tischer et al.
(73, 74) at the German Bundesanstalt für Arbeitsschutz
und Arbeitsmedizin (BAuA – Federal Institute for Occu￾pational Safety and Health). The primary empirical basis
for their analysis was measurement data collected within
the preceding decade during several BauA field studies.
The outcome data were presented as histograms for the
percentage of data points that were lower than, within, or
higher than the predicted exposure (73). A rough calculation
indicates that 98% of the measurements were within or below
the OEL, although an evaluation by Naumann et al. (75)
277PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
has questioned these findings, indicating geometric standard
deviations in the range of 2–3. Tischer et al. were quick
to point out that a limited number of data points, repre￾senting a limited number of possible combinations of Expo￾sure Predictor Bands and Control Strategies, were available
for evaluation. In particular, their database had limited data
on exposures related to handling of milliliter or tonne quan￾tities of low or high volatility/dustiness substances (73, 74).
The only other comprehensive validation studies of
COSHH Essentials have been conducted by Jones and Nicas
(68, 72, 76) of the University of California, Berkeley. Their
evaluation of COSHH Essentials for vapor degreasing and
bag filling operations was based on the US NIOSH Health
Hazard Evaluations and Control Technology Assessments.
Under controlled errors were defined as situations in which
the airborne concentration exceeded the upper limit of the
exposure band in the presence of control technology; over
controlled errors occurred when the airborne concentration
was within or below the exposure band in the absence of
control technology when COSHH Essentials recommended
controls. They determined that under controlled errors
occurred in 78% (139/179) of vapor degreasing opera￾tions where LEV was present, and 48% (76/159) of bag
filling operations with control technologies. Over controlled
errors were observed in 61% (102/167) and 8% (3/26) of
operations, respectively.
These authors commented that they were unable to deter￾mine the capture or containment efficiency of controls, due
to limited information in the NIOSH reports. In our opinion,
this suggests a verification issue rather than a validation
issue, with verification referring to the proper installation and
operation of controls, and validation referring to the ability
of the COSHH Essentials model to predict the appropriate
level of control technology (77–79).
Many experts who have written on CB confirm its poten￾tial value as a risk assessment and management tool in the
workplace but express caution about the need for system￾atic, critical evaluation of the approach before widespread
adoption (1, 2, 17, 62, 73, 80). A thorough evaluation of the
main components of the COSHH Essentials and the ICCT
was performed by an ACGIH task force (80). This expert
group was tasked with identifying the most important issues
associated with these nearly identical toolkits and their use,
then offering recommendations for improvement of these
main components. The task force evaluated the use of R￾phrases and GHS Hazard Classes for hazard group predic￾tion, the grouping of these R-phrases into four classes of
exposure limit prediction, the exposure prediction step, and
predefined control strategies and verification of achieving
control. They found that the use of R-phrases for hazard
group prediction, although limited by an inherently rudi￾mentary summary of toxicology and unchecked variability,
tended toward an appropriate conservative control of expo￾sure, apart from Hazard Group A as a default for chemicals
with limited data. They also found that the exposure limit
prediction step, crucial to achieving a simplified approach
in these toolkits, has predictably created a less accurate and
therefore crude estimate of OELs.
Subsequently, the NIOSH developed a CB Literature
Review and Critical Analysis that captured many of these
issues; however, NIOSH focused on its potential usefulness
in the United States by informing users of its strengths and
weaknesses to stimulate dialogue (81). As an outcome, the
document addressed the promise of CB concepts and its
potential for considering GHS applications while pursuing
further validation of these strategies and opportunities to
expand CB models to address additional workplace hazards.
Collectively, these studies and expert comments presented
in this section were not seen as “project stoppers,” but
rather emphasize the need for collection of data under
controlled scenarios to validate the predictions of the soon￾to-be evolving model. This validation still must be seen as a
separate activity from the verification of proper installation
and maintenance of controls prescribed by a CB approach.
5 PART IV: CB EVALUATION AND THE
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE
5.1 The International Paradox for Simplified
Solutions to Reduce Risk
The growth of international acceptance of CB models
has gone through a unique process as it has been viewed
through the lens of the “haves” and “have nots” in countries
around the world. In the developed countries, where OSHH
resources are greatest, the acceptance of CB is predicated
on accuracy in selecting appropriate controls, efficacy in
protecting workers, and whether its models can compare to
the gold standard of traditional IH. However, in the econom￾ically developing and transitional countries where OSHH
professionals and resources are minimal to nonexistent, CB
is seen to have the potential to reduce work-related risk for
over two billion workers while providing the educational
foundation to develop and grow the IH profession where it is
most needed globally (82). Therefore, it is just as important
to learn of the history and evolution of CB concepts for those
areas in the world in need as it is to focus on the science and
quantitative methods required by those more resource rich.
There has been a longstanding need for developing an
international agenda for simplified approaches and with this
is an equally robust historical progression of research-based
programs promoting solutions worldwide. Early initiatives
to compile solutions include the noise control solutions
from the UK HSE (83), in mining from Australia (84), and
chemical substitution strategies from Denmark, the United
Kingdom, the United States, and The Netherlands (85).
278CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
This process has evolved into efforts such as the European
Solbase, with many nations teaming to develop a database of
effective controls (2).
The unfolding of global CB leadership can serve as a
model for internationalizing OSHH efforts in both developed
and developing nations. Efforts to promote international
cooperation on development of practical solutions may be
traced to a workshop on preventive measures held at the
first IOHA Scientific Conference in Belgium. This 1992
workshop was the seed for the WHO Prevention and Control
Exchange (PACE) for airborne dusts (86). WHO continued
its leadership role in this arena, with the 5th meeting of
the WHO Collaborating Centers in Occupational Health
(WHOCC) (Thailand, 2001) resulting in a unified research
agenda intended to validate and verify the effectiveness of
the CB strategies. The International Programme on Chem￾ical Safety (a joint program of ILO, WHO, and the United
Nations Environment Programme) serves as secretariat of
the International Task Group (ITG) on CB, which held
its first meeting at the first International Control Banding
Workshop (ICBW, London, 2002) (87). The ITG had a long￾standing role as a global platform for a solidified scientific
research and implementation agenda for both developed and
EDCs (88).
The CB workshops have provided excellent forums
for teaching and research presentations, open debate, and
development of research and implementation agendas. At
ICBW 2002, the ILO officially released the ICCT (known
then as the ILO Toolkit) (89) and as described above, the
ITG was launched. The second ICBW, held in Cincinnati,
OH, in March 2004, introduced US-based OSHH profes￾sionals to CB. Outcomes of this meeting included the US
National Control Banding Workshop (NCBW) Organizing
Committee, an International Implementation Strategy for
the ITG, and plans for follow-up workshops. The Practical
Applications Workshop (June 2004 in The Netherlands)
succeeded in creating and implementing CB pilot projects in
South Africa, Brazil, and India through twinning strategies
with more developed countries. The NCBW (March 2005,
Washington, DC) developed a US strategy to conduct and
critically evaluate CB research. The third ICBW was held
later in 2005 in Pilanesberg, South Africa, in conjunction
with the WHOCC Planning Meeting in Johannesburg. The
inter-relationship of key concepts was highlighted at the
AIHA symposium on Hazard Communication and Risk
Management for Global Business – GHS, REACH, and
Control Banding, (14–15 September 2006, San Jose, CA).
The joint CB workshop and WHOCC meetings benefited
both by providing an opportunity to develop the WHOCC
2006–2010 Work Plan while reviewing the effectiveness
of the 2001–2005 Work Plan. This synergism between the
ICBWs and the WHOCC can be seen in the incorporation of
themes from the ICBW sessions in the WHOCC 2006–2010
Work Plans (global trends in CB collaborations, silica, and
expansion of range of CB models beyond chemicals). A
fourth ICBW was held in 2008 in South Korea (92), and a
fifth ICBW was held in 2009 in Cape Town, South Africa.
The sixth ICBW was held in 2010 in Rome, Italy and the
seventh ICBW went back to its roots in 2015 in being held
again in London, England. The eighth ICBW was held in
Washington, D.C. in 2018. Much has blossomed from the
roots of the original practical solutions initiatives, early
global collaborations, the initial efforts of the developers
of COSHH Essentials, and the ICBWs have become a
highlight event for showcasing the latest in CB research and
innovation.
5.2 International Validation and Growth
from the COSHH Essentials
COSHH Essentials has remained an important element in
advancing the international growth of CB for both the
“haves” and the “have nots” as it is readily available on the
internet for everyone to access and apply. COSHH Essentials
is an evergreen program, in that the UK HSE has continued
to review existing models while developing new tools in
keeping with the original intent of creating a product that is
simple and useful for SMEs. Nearly 20 000 guidance sheets
are downloaded monthly, either from the COSHH Essentials
or other Web sites; however, less than one visit in six results
in a completed assessment. Many users are part of the health
and safety community, but fewer are small businesses (who
make up more than 50% of the British workforce) who do
not use the Internet to access information.
However, as COSHH Essentials was created, imple￾mented, and distributed from a developed country it has
been held to a higher level of professional scrutiny. Its
original design of providing SMEs with a simplified tool
to complement exposure assessment and personal moni￾toring requirements remains an important component of this
process. A recent validation exercise sought to confirm this
mindset by seeking to extend the original validation effort
(55) by using 850 OELs used by more than one standard￾setting organization to establish the appropriateness of the
previously assigned COSHH Essentials Exposure Range
Band (ERB) approach (91). Considering the variability of
OELs internationally, the study found that approximately
90% of inhalation exposure assessments are equally or
better controlled, thus this toolkit’s target airborne concen￾trations remain a valid strategy (91). It has been shown, in
comparison with expert judgment, that improvements can be
made on the limitations for gasses and vapors and potential
overcontrol issues as part of professional decision making by
using Bayesian decision analysis (92). COSHH Essentials
outcomes were also compared with the Chemical Hazard
Risk Management (CHARM) CB tool from South Korea
for 59 highly hazardous substances. COSHH Essentials was
279PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
found to be an appropriate CB benchmark as its assessment
outcomes were rated at risk level (RL) 3 or higher for all
substances, whereas CHARM was found by its evaluators
to have underestimated the risk in comparison for nearly all
the hazardous chemicals (94).
5.3 The Reach of REACH
Running parallel to the early emergence of the COSHH
Essentials was the introduction of the Chemical Agents
Directive by the EU in 1998 (94). As chemical risk assess￾ment regulation is wont to do, this process spurred interest in
CB strategies on the part of the wider European IH commu￾nity (17, 95) and the implementation of the EU regulations on
REACH (96) have provided an ongoing catalyst to the growth
of CB. REACH created a fundamentally new approach to
chemical control by shifting the burden of risk assessment
and management from the regulatory authorities to chemical
manufacturers, formulators, or importers. Downstream users
(employers) must follow “Risk Management Measures”
developed to control exposures in foreseeable use scenarios.
Additional activities also were part of the historical
progression of CB, serving as ongoing motivation for the
development of national models in the EU. The European
Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) exposure manage￾ment system was intended to provide a guidance tool for
SMEs, to collect workplace exposure data. This data could
then be coupled with hazard information to deliver advice
on risks and risk management (incorporating a validated
CB model) and recommend whether exposure monitoring
should be conducted (17). Faced with registering and eval￾uating tens of thousands of chemicals into the next decade,
the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology
of Chemicals (ECETOC) targeted risk assessment (TRA;
ECETOC-TRA) was developed. ECETOC-TRA is a tiered
process that utilizes banding approaches to identify chem￾icals that present a risk to workers and/or consumers (17,
97) that is also available online to registered users. Hazard
and exposure are considered together to determine the level
of detail and complexity required for risk evaluation. Tier
0 screens out chemicals not presenting an immediate risk
to humans or the environment. Tier 1 identifies uses of a
chemical that may present further risks, to be investigated in
greater depth in Tier 2. In Tier 1, margins of exposure (MoE)
are compared with generic OELs for the chemical’s hazard
category. Tier 2 assessments are conducted in accordance
with EU risk assessment principles. Another important CB
model in this process is the Advanced REACH Tool (ART),
also developed as a higher tier exposure assessment tool.
ART uses a Bayesian approach to combine available expo￾sure data with mechanistically modeled inhalation exposure
predictions (98–106).
CB models from EU countries have indeed been impacted
by REACH regulations. In addition to serving as a Tier 1
risk assessment tool, aiding manufacturers and importers
in estimating workplace exposures to their chemical prod￾ucts and suggesting appropriate control strategies, CB may
also aid manufacturers in formulating safer products. For
example, a product classified as harmful by inhalation with
high emission potential would require CS 3 (containment)
when used in ton quantities. Altering the physical form of
the product from a high-emission powder to a low-emission
granular form would reduce the CS to level 1 (general princi￾ples of IH) (105). COSHH has not been revoked or substan￾tially amended by REACH, as the latter does not repeal the
EU’s Chemicals Agents Directive, Carcinogens, and Muta￾gens Directive, or Biological Agents Directives, all of which
COSHH implements. REACH and COSHH duties relate to
one another with respect to the duty to decide how to control
exposure and the control of exposure by inhalation.
Heading into the twenty-first century significant efforts
were being made in European countries to develop a CB
model for SMEs, Germany being one (106). In addition to
the SME issues common internationally, Germany has faced
an ongoing loss of OSHH knowledge resulting from the split￾ting of formerly large chemical firms into small, independent
units. The German Occupational Safety and Health (Bunde￾sanstalt für Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitsmedizin, BauA) has
adopted and advanced the COSHH Essentials approach that
they have also made readily available as the “Easy-to￾use workplace control scheme for hazardous substances”
(EMKG) available on its website since 2005 (107). Using
readily available information from SDSs (substance-related)
and workplaces (task-related), the user of the scheme can
derive control strategies to minimize exposure via inhala￾tion or skin contact. An extensive number of generic CGSs
are offered on BauA’s webpage with the same numbering as
those from HSE. The CGSs are accepted by the competent
authorities in the federal states of Germany as a procedure to
improve compliance with the Hazardous Substances Ordi￾nance for substances without an OEL (108). In 2008 EMKG
2.0 was launched on the BauA homepage. The new version
includes all 300 substances with a legal OEL in Germany
and is now providing great value in complying with REACH
demands for Tier 1 exposure scenarios in the registration
procedure for chemical substances (109). From its begin￾ning, BauA has also worked to validate its EMKG as well
as its CGSs that are similarly derived from COSHH Essen￾tials. These studies include the use of workplace exposure
monitoring data to further validation of CB in support of
the EMKG approach (73, 74, 110, 111) and using Monte
Carlo simulations for mixed substances to reproduce deter￾minations that the protection provided from the process is
satisfactory (112). To further validate the EMKG-Expo-Tool
and its CGSs over a decade later, exposure band predic￾tions were determined in line with tasks for filling containers
with organic solvents while simultaneously performing air
monitoring evaluations at the LEV, in the work area, and on
280CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
workers. When using the appropriate LEV there was a good
agreement found between the CGS-derived exposure bands
and quantitative measurements of airborne solvent concen￾trations, providing assurance that workers are protected
when using this CB toolkit (113). This provided sufficient
confirmation that the EMKG-Expo-Tool was acceptable for
REACH Tier 1 exposure assessments.
The Netherlands was also involved in this process, devel￾oping another important CB model that has benefited from
the international growth of the COSHH Essentials. Stof￾fenmanager (Dutch for substance manager) has been avail￾able online since 2003 and was designed to have expanded
exposure assessment capability to assist SMEs. The toolkit
was originally based on a conceptual model of exposure
(114) and a quantified calibration with measured data (115).
For inhalation, Stoffenmanager combines a hazard banding
scheme like that of COSHH Essentials with an exposure
banding scheme modified (118) from a model developed by
Cherrie et al. (117, 118). The dermal exposure model is based
on the RISKOFDERM Toolkit (119, 120). Unlike COSHH
Essentials, this model factors in exposure potential using an
interactive chemical risk management approach (115). The
employer completes an exposure assessment, responding to
seven questions, including proximity of the worker to the
exposure source, to determine the chemical’s exposure class.
As originally developed, Stoffenmanager used this exposure
assessment, and R-phrases (now Hazard Statements) cate￾gorized according to COSSH Essentials, to automatically
calculate a risk score to complete an initial assessment of the
health risk. The English version of the generic model creates
wider opportunities for international use and has provided
further validation and verification of the model.
Stoffenmanager is an excellent example of a CB model
that has benefited from the collaborative efforts of the inter￾national CB workshops (e.g. the inclusion of a more detailed
exposure assessment process) (121, 122). As part of its orig￾inal validation process, the Stoffenmanager model was eval￾uated utilizing targeted field surveys for many dust (e.g.
animal feed, flour processing, textile, and construction) and
liquid (e.g. solvents for metal, car body repair, and printing)
exposures for comparison with existing exposure data (116).
This comprehensive study found relatively good correlation
of the nonexpert Stoffenmanager score with expert eval￾uation overall for inhalable dusts (rs =0.83) and liquids
(rs =0.81). The initial validation study suggests the value
of Stoffenmanager as an exposure assessment tool for SME
managers and confirms its use in REACH Tier 1 scenarios.
The employer can then calculate the efficacy of various
control measures and choose the most effective ones (121).
The model was refined based on a database of approxi￾mately 1000 measurements as an initial attempt to verify
Stoffenmanager’s applicability for REACH for Tier 1 expo￾sure assessments and reached a conservative 90th percentile
estimate that was considered to be sufficient for REACH
applications (123). To further the evaluation and validation
efforts of the Stoffenmanager model, the exposure database
MEGA from Germany, a compilation of workplace measure￾ments for preventative applications, was used (124). Specific
task group measurements were selected from MEGA and
organized by task, product, and control measures within
scenarios to evaluate two of the model’s equations for esti￾mating inhalable dust personal exposures. As with Schinkel
et al. (123), this provided good correlation with a conserva￾tive approach to show that Stoffenmanager would be a useful
Tier 1 model for REACH (124). Stoffenmanager has also
been found useful in practice based on its simplicity in a labo￾ratory risk assessment for xylene (125).
CB became interwoven within the European Chemical
Agency (ECHA) REACH guidance with a number of these
computer-based toolkits specifically mentioned as suitable
for exposure assessment for workers as part of the substance
registration process, standardizing the exposure distribution
for risk characterization at the 75th or 90th percentile to
ensure conservative results (126, 127). The ICBW 2015
became the perfect global stage to present the initial results
of research into this as part of the Evaluation of Tier 1 Expo￾sure Assessment Models under REACH (ETEAM) Project
presentation of its initial results. The ETEAM’s genesis was
an outcome of the previous six ICBWs and was initially
presented at the first EU Control Banding 2011 conference in
Dortmund, Germany (128). The ETEAM Project’s aims were
to compare and contrast the different exposure assessment
models in terms of their determinants, scope of application,
functionality, and user-friendliness. The included outcomes
on these models and their conceptual evaluation and uncer￾tainty, between-user reliability, and external validation were
also part of the goals of this comprehensive project. Over
2000 measurements as part of a dataset were built for the
evaluation of the five CB toolkits (ECETOC TRA, RISKOF￾DERM, EMKG-Expo-Tool, Metals-EASE (129), and Stof￾fenmanager) that are accepted by ECHA for REACH Tier
1 assessments. Part of the ETEAM study outcomes showed
that, for powders and volatile liquids evaluated, the ability to
predict exposure assessment outcomes at conservative levels
was found to be more balanced in the Stoffenmanager 4.5
model (130, 131). An evaluation of ECETOC TRA v3, ART
1.5, and Stoffenmanager 4.5 as part of a sensitivity anal￾ysis with the determining dominant factors of the models
to assess overall robustness found that Stoffenmanager was
a good tool for practitioners to use with difficult or uncer￾tain entry data (132). Another evaluation of conservative
outcomes that tested 90th percentile outcomes being above
quantitatively measured exposure values also had positive
outcomes for the Stoffenmanager 5.1 model (133). Stoffen￾manager is now seen as a long-standing, validated higher
tier tool for assessing and managing work-related hazardous
substance risks by ECHA for REACH (134). With this
growth in REACH applicable CB models and continuing
281PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
outcomes from the ETEAM Project, a steady stream of
research continues into their evaluation and validation. With
over 40 000 chemical substance dossiers submitted to ECHA
as of 2014, consistent reminders of the necessity of quan￾titative exposure assessment are interspersed with research
into exposure models as their necessity in the process has
become quite evident (103, 135). The ECHA REACH guid￾ance received a further ETEAM evaluation of several of these
recommended CB toolkits, taking into account the relative
simplicity of Tier 1 models as screening tools to evaluate
the necessity of providing conservative exposure predictions
(136).
Two years after ICBW 2015 nearly 4000 measurements
of primarily powder handling and volatile liquid exposures
from both Europe and the United States were used as
part of the validation of ECETOC TRA, MEASE, EMKG￾Expo-Tool, and Stoffenmanager (134). The comparison of
toolkit estimates with measurement results indicated that
these CB approaches were showing relatively appropriate
levels of REACH guidance level of conservatism at the 90th
percentile of outcome at or above quantitatively measured
outcomes, although more so for powder handling than for
work with volatile liquids. Toolkits also varied in their perfor￾mance with a reduced conservatism for certain processes,
although the higher tier Stoffenmanager was an exception
for this during powder handling. This comprehensive vali￾dation effort reflected that these tools often, but not always,
achieve the necessary conservatism and therefore may need
ongoing adjustments (134). To address the user side of this
process, the evaluation of between-user reliability was also
performed for the varying input parameters within these CB
toolkits as part of the ETEAM Project for these Tier 1 expo￾sure assessment models (137). Comprehensive methods were
utilized to ensure tool input factors and user demographics
with 146 users generating over 4000 exposure estimates.
Choice variations occurred for most input factors across the
tools, with process category codes and dustiness level esti￾mates leading to order of magnitude differences in some
estimate ranges. Therefore, the continued availability of user
support and quality control is essential to reduce consistency
issues in the REACH processes (137). Scheffers et al. (138)
sought to validate the hazard banding process outcomes of
four CB toolkits, including the commonly available COSHH
Essentials and EMKG, against data sets for 229 chemical
substances with strong GHS classifications and OELs. These
toolkits assigned 23–64% of the substances to the same band
with the remainders differing by at least one band. This eval￾uation process reflected the need to consider the necessity for
aligning hazard banding outcomes as an important validation
component for standardizing concentration ranges across
toolkits. These findings were first introduced at ICBW 2015,
where an emphasis was made for aligning the underlying
factors of these banding approaches and how the ICBWs
are playing an important role in addressing this important
goal (138, 139). This is not the only call for a standard￾ized approach to classification criteria and setting assignment
rules for all CB toolkits to develop a unified hazard banding
strategy for GHS-related compliance (140, 141).
Additional REACH-related evaluation of these toolkits
has also led to mixed results. Spinazzè et al. (142) eval￾uated the accuracy and robustness of Stoffenmanager 6.0,
ECETOC-TRA v 3.1, and ART 1.5 exposure modeling
toolkits by comparing these toolkits using organic solvent
and pesticide measured data. They found Stoffenmanager to
be the most robust model, as well as the safest overall to
use as its robustness can overcome minor exposure scenario
interpretation errors, but ART results were more accurate if
exposure scenarios are well documented (142). Stoffenman￾ager and ART were investigated for their validity via compar￾ison of the lack of agreement between measured and esti￾mated exposure as an outcome of these modeling tools (143).
Multiple inhalable exposures to volatile liquids and powders
were both estimated at the 50th percentile and measured for
a geometric mean across seven different industries to eval￾uate both tools for their precision and mean differences of
the task parameters presented. ART underestimated expo￾sures in general and Stoffenmanager was shown to under￾estimate high exposures and overestimate low exposures
overall. Stoffenmanager reflected its strength with powder
exposures showing higher agreement than for the liquids.
Conversely, ART showed higher agreement with liquids as
tasks with powders were underestimated sufficiently that it
may account for ART’s exposure underestimation in general
(143). Another evaluation of ART found it to overesti￾mate lower exposures and underestimate higher exposures
in comparison to 584 exposure measurements from a Swiss
database, although these were considered to be sufficiently
conservative at the 90th percentile across all measured expo￾sures of both powders and liquids (144). Savic et al. (146),
subsequently used a novel approach by adding ECETOC￾TRA in a comparison with Stoffenmanager and ART of
their exposure estimates in nearly 32 000 separate in silico
exposure situations generated in the Translation of Expo￾sure Models (TREXMO) translation system. TREXMO inte￾grates six CB toolkits of ART, Stoffenmanager, ECETOC￾TRA, MEASE, EMKG-Expo-Tool, and EASE to minimize
input and data requirements by assuming the necessary
parameters can be translated between models (145). The
outcome of the comparison of ECETOC-TRA, Stoffenman￾ager, and ART via TREXMO showed higher consistency in
the models for volatiles than for powders, indoors rather than
outdoor exposures, and in the near-field rather than far-field
(146). There were some issues presented on the Stoffen￾manager related model algorithms and those in TREXMO
leading to different outcomes (147). These were acknowl￾edged when compared to Stoffenmanager 6.0 and less so
with the version 5.1 included in TREXMO (148). This
interchange led to important outcomes on both the value of
282CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
TREXMO’s goal to serve as a “translator” for multiple algo￾rithms to reduce between-use variability versus the value￾added consideration of selecting the right CB model for the
task and managing the users through the process to improve
overall worker safety (145, 147, 149).
5.4 CB as a Gold Standard; The
Nanomaterial Challenge
As challenging and potentially divisive as generating
and assessing exposure scenarios can be in REACH-related
models, the simplicity afforded by CB can best be seen when
dealing with something as complex as engineered nano￾materials (ENM). ENM presents several real challenges to
IH practitioners. As products utilizing nanotechnologies
are becoming more commonplace and given the general
lack of understanding of their toxicological parameters and
therefore no OELs developed to date, there has been an
urging for caution as groups of ENM that appear promising
in, say, nanomedical applications have themselves been
found to be potentially toxic to the patient (149, 150).
The potential for worker exposures during the handling of
ENM is also very real, as evidenced by worker exposures
to polyacrylate nanoparticles in a Chinese factory (151),
silicon dioxide ENM playing a major role in the develop￾ment of cardiovascular diseases (152), and nickel ENM
powders causing sensitization (153). Recognizing the power
of people to decide which technologies succeed and which
do not, whether based on real or perceived risks (154),
the role of the IH practitioner cannot be overemphasized
in relation to society’s ability to reap the full benefits of
nanotechnologies.
Traditional IH has not provided a comprehensive and
accurate quantitative risk assessment of ENM. This realiza￾tion led to CB gaining legitimate recognition as a viable
risk assessment strategy in the eyes of occupational health
experts for challenging work-related hazards. The use of
CB strategies has become a primary route for the assess￾ment and management of potential health risk prioritiza￾tion resulting from work-related nanoparticle exposures (82,
155–158). The number of CB strategies has grown in support
of this pragmatic approach to preliminary risk manage￾ment (159). These CB strategies for ENM include CB
Nanotool, Stoffenmanager Nano 1.0, and the French Agency
for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety
(ANSES) as well as others that have not been formally
published (160–164). Regardless of the CB strategy used,
the uncertainty of the potential health risks of nanomate￾rials seems to result in a conservative hazard characteriza￾tion that results in a high level of risk determination and
consequently the need for a high level of exposure control
(159, 165). Prior to the existence of the CB Nanotool, expert
IH advice was used to select the most appropriate controls
for a given activity with ENM. Therefore, outcomes were
directly compared with existing professional expertise as a
strategy for validating the method in the absence of an OEL
gold standard. A total of 32 risk assessments with the CB
Nanotool were performed, producing control recommenda￾tions that were generally equal to or more conservative than
the existing controls implemented by expert IHs (162, 163).
Balancing conservative outcomes with end-user flexi￾bility for addressing the uncertainty of ENM scientific infor￾mation appears to be the most useful path forward. The CB
Nanotool’s approach is considered by numerous researchers
to have the potential to offer the greatest utility to ENM
producers, as well as users, on both the local and the national
scale (166–168). Flexibility for weighting unknowns is seen
as especially useful for performing risk assessment and
obtaining commensurate control outcomes associated with
what may be a temporary or highly variable application as
well as with specific changes in a given task’s processes
(166). It was found that the CB Nanotool provides a factor
for understanding uncertainty without using a worst-case
approach, even with temporary or highly variable appli￾cations (166, 170). Even within the paradigm of tradi￾tional IH methods based on quantitative exposure measure￾ments to establish controls, the uncertainty in work-related
health effects relating to ENM render the CB Nanotool
an integral component of risk management programs (155,
166, 169, 170). The CB Nanotool also has a freely avail￾able (https://controlbanding.llnl.gov) application that applies
Monte Carlo simulation to account for risk and qualitative
analysis in planning and decision-making to afford changing
input parameters to identify the best and most economical
methods to decrease RL outcomes in the design phase (171).
Acknowledgment of this utility has also been seen by the
International Standards Organization (ISO), which issued a
new technical specification standard on the use of CB for
managing inhalation risk from ENM (172). The standard
provides a description of CB for both proactive and retroac￾tive risk assessment, which is distinguished by whether or
not existing controls are used as input variables in deter￾mining the control band. The CB Nanotool is described as
an example of the proactive approach and Stoffenmanager
Nano is described as an example of the retroactive approach.
It is also suggested that the retroactive approach can be
considered a means for periodic re-evaluation of the proac￾tive approach.
Although validated against experts, acknowledged in
research for its utility and end-user effectiveness, and iden￾tified in international standards, many experts maintained
a questioning attitude about the CB Nanotool because
it lacked the IH gold standard criteria of a quantitative
validation (159, 166, 169, 173, 175). Even though ENM
lacks established OELs to aid in this process, this rightfully
holds as a constant for all CB-related successes attained
283PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
for qualitative risk management methods and quantitative
methods should continue to be evaluated for their role in
validating the qualitative outcomes (166, 169). Owing to the
lack of guidance on a single exposure assessment method￾ology, various methods were used to collect information for
the quantitative validation of the CB Nanotool (176). Zalk
et al. (176) assessed 30 activities using the CB Nanotool
2.0 and quantitative data were collected or previously
collected data were reviewed for each of those activities
using a variety of sampling methods, including real-time
detection, filter analysis, and microscopic analysis. All the
quantitative data indicated that the control recommendations
from the CB Nanotool qualitative assessment were sufficient
to prevent workers from being exposed to ENM at levels
beyond recommended exposure limits or background levels.
This quantitative validation of the CB Nanotool gives even
further credence to the use of the CB Nanotool to effectively
control worker exposures in the absence of quantitative air
monitoring results. The call for OELs for ENM began before
the release of the CB Nanotool. Over 10 years later the
IH profession still does not have OELs for ENM, but this
quantitative validation of the CB Nanotool and a decade of
successful implementation and verification serves to provide
CB its first gold standard (176).
6 PART V: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
OF CB APPLICATION FOR
THE NEW IH
Up to this point, we have focused on the history and evolution
of CB, its scientific basis, and the continually growing body
of research to evaluate, validate, and reveal its strengths and
weaknesses. For many in professional IH practice, this is the
most important aspect of the CB discussion and based on
this information they can decide whether to apply CB within
their realm of practice in the traditional IH model. A growing
number of professionals are already encountering CB in use
as part of their job scope. Questions often arise about its
appropriateness in practice. However, for those entering their
first IH job and those early in their career, CB may be a vital
component for their practice. Understanding how, where, and
when CB is best applied is essential.
An All Too Familiar Scenario
Imagine yourself, for a moment, as a newly-minted
IH. Your first steps after walking off the graduation
stage are straight into the office of Big Consulting Firm
LLC, and with a job offer in hand, you receive your
first assignment: you are to report at 0600 to a 350-
employee chemical manufacturer on the outskirts of
town that has just received a multitude of serious viola￾tion notices from OSHA. Your boss is called away
last minute to tend to Big Consulting LLC’s highest￾profile oil and gas client, so you report to your first
assignment alone. You meet with the sole full-time
health and safety person on-site and review the viola￾tions: employees exposed to fall hazards because stair￾ways were not guarded by standard railings; failure
to provide training to ensure employees understood
the purpose of energy control programs; and a variety
of citations for noncompliance with the Respiratory
Protection standard.
After reviewing the violations, you proceed into
the expansive high bay of the production building.
As you tour various lines, you note some troubling
observations: employees are consistently relying on
machine interlocks to stop equipment to allow for
quickly making adjustments down-stream, without a
lock or tag in sight. When you are led into a side
room, you notice an overwhelming amine-odor and
employees that are working over open tanks with no
local ventilation quickly grab nearby full-face air￾purifying respirators from a heap of discarded supplies
on the corner of a mezzanine and continue without
seal checks, and one employee’s mask looks much too
big for his small face. At the next line, employees use
lifting equipment to dump one-ton poly bulk bags full
of powdered pigment into hoppers for use in other
areas of the plant, and a fine haze of particulate never
quite seems to settle across the room in between the
dumping of each tote. In a small maintenance shop
separate from the production building, employees strip
paint off salvaged parts using a dichloromethane-based
paint remover, with only a semi-adjacent spray paint
booth with the door sometimes propped open acting as
exhaust ventilation.
There is a single Environment, Health, and Safety
(EHS) manager on-site that needs your help. He is
familiar with the company’s struggles with lockout￾tagout (LOTO) and fall protection, but he finds most
of his time is occupied with new employee general
safety training – employee turnover here is high – and
preparing for a weekly presentation of illness and
injury statistics. You have a total of 40 billable hours,
4 of which have already been consumed, and a $1000
sampling and analysis budget to collect any needed
samples, review the company’s written health and
safety programs, and prepare to finalize a report to the
284CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
on-site EHS manager, plant manager, and the parent
company’s corporate health and safety manager.
With the limited time and budget available,
you form a list of questions: what are the highest
priority issues at this site? What needs to be fixed
now, and what can be ignored or recommended to
fix later? Some of the chemicals you observed on
site have long-established OELs, but what about the
nanoparticles used in the dry pigments that were being
loaded? How do you prioritize sampling for complex
mixtures of chemicals in the open-top tank room?
What resources and will does the company have to
implement your recommendations if they go beyond
inexpensive purchases of new PPE, or re-writing
certain training programs? And finally, how can you
communicate your findings in clear and effective
language?
6.1 Limited Time, Resources, and OEL
Guidance
Even a long-tenured IH can identify with the struggle of the
new IH to effectively prioritize OSHH resources. The world
of IH is no longer governed by the reactionary, compliance￾focused mindset of the asbestos- and lead-centered profes￾sion of the 1980s. EHS budgets are flat or shrinking, with
management expecting increased return on investment (ROI)
for every dollar invested in health and safety (177). Increas￾ingly, firms are reducing their in-house EHS staff and seeking
outside help from consultants on an as-needed basis (178).
Any decision to hire EHS support, whether in house or on￾site, is often based on external market forces such as the cost
of worker’s compensation insurance or the introduction of
new or increasingly complex regulatory standards in a global
market (178), rather than the presence or absence of uncon￾trolled health and safety hazards. In this challenging market,
the new IH professional must be equipped with a versatile
toolbox that can provide value added to their employer by
improving workplace conditions within the framework of
shrinking resources.
6.1.1 An IH World Without OELs
What is the new IH to do when confronted with a work￾place that may expose employees to one or more of the
99.99% of chemical substances without an OEL? A newer
graphical representation of the varying degree of existing
exposure limit guidance is a “Hierarchy of Occupational
Exposure Limits” – a pyramid-shaped visual of the larger
body of occupational exposure benchmarks and guidance
values (OEVs) (Figure 3). The base of the pyramid is hazard
banding – the allocation of chemical substances to tiered,
graded-risk bands based on their hazard classifications (179).
Hazard banding techniques produce a range of acceptable
exposure levels, which are most useful when applied as
screening techniques where little or no toxicological or
epidemiological data exists. A middle-tier, moderately data￾driven approach includes reviewing OEVs that are semi￾quantitative and simple to derive but must be used with
caution, such as the “Desired No Effect Levels” (DNELs)
required in REACH legislation. The top tiers of the OEV
hierarchy include quantitative, peer-reviewed, health-based
OELs set by regulatory or authoritative bodies (i.e. PELs,
TLVs, WELs, RELs, MAKs, etc.) A new IH is best suited
to participate in the OEL selection or development process
somewhere amongst the “bottom” and “middle” tiers of the
pyramid. However, when working without OELs the newer
IH should know that even hazard banding has its complica￾tions in practice that need to be understood.
6.1.2 A World of Generalists
As the IH and business community looks beyond OELs,
a convergence is occurring among the allied disciplines
that comprise environmental health and safety. As noted
in the 2016–2018 AIHA Strategic Plan, IH competencies
are “becoming specialized, fragmented, and integrated into
generalist EHS roles.” Simultaneously, the responsibilities
of an IH have expanded to include broader environmental,
safety, and health responsibilities (180). As early as 2000,
internal surveys performed by AIHA showed that “tradi￾tional” IHs spent slightly more than half of their time on pure
IH tasks, with an almost equal amount of time taken up with
safety and environmental issues (181). Additionally, many
IHs are looking to the environmental field to move upward on
the career ladder. Considering that the EPA has a budget and
staff 10 times that of OSHA, multimillion-dollar fines, and
tough regulations, it is no wonder that up to 40% of IHs have
said they may position themselves in environmental manage￾ment in the future (181).
6.1.3 Developed and Still Developing Countries
Approaching Parity?
Health and safety initiatives in developing countries often
remain underfunded and neglected under the pressures of
social, economic, and political challenges (182). Daniel
Anna, AIHA president from 2015 to 2016, noted that as the
globalization of manufacturing continues, “old” IH issues
like controlling exposures to lead, silica, and asbestos,
become a prevalent risk that are not controlled to the extent
expected or achieved in the United States (180). Yet devel￾oped and developing countries share a surprising amount of
occupational health and safety challenges.
SMEs employ approximately half of the employees in
many developed countries (183). Yet even when an OEL

exists, enforceable rules are in place, and knowledge is
widely available, SMEs have less resources and expertise to
implement exposure controls due to a lack of technical exper￾tise and financial access to EHS resources and technology
(184). A 2018 US Small Business Administration report
found that small businesses with less than 20 employees,
which account for 89% of all firms in the United States,
pay approximately $250 more per employee to comply with
occupational safety, health, and homeland security regula￾tions than those firms with 500 employees or more (183).
Evidence exists that these small businesses in the developed
world struggle with a lack of access to resources, informa￾tion, and knowledge like their counterparts in developing
countries. In a 1998 survey of UK employers that used chem￾icals, most of which employed fewer than 10 employees, less
than 20% of the employers were aware of the existence of
legally binding OELs (13). A survey of a randomly selected
representative group of employers in Taiwan demonstrated
that 65% of employers could not answer what a SDS was,
and over 50% did not believe air monitoring was required
if a worksite had an environment that could be considered
hazardous (185). In Germany, only 1–2% of SMEs perform
air sampling to test for compliance with existing OELs (112).
Clearly, the gap between workplaces that can afford EHS
expertise, and those that cannot, is not as simple as the devel￾oped vs developing country divide.
6.2 Control Banding and the Newer IH’s
Toolbox
There is unprecedented pressure on less experienced IHs
to be more knowledgeable, useful, and versatile than ever
before – with increasingly limited time and resources. Below
we will explore CB’s acceptance by national organizations,
examples of CB tool kits, OEB, and applications in practice.
6.2.1 Occupational Exposure Banding
Hazard and CB provide a process for evaluating hazards and
risks in situations where OELs may or may not exist. Ripple
(186) stated that decoupling hazard banding from CB allows
assessment of hazards to be used in hazard communication
to promote greater understanding after a substance has been
introduced into a workplace. Hazard banding, although not a
substitute for OELs, yields insight into the relative toxicity of
substances and can be used to aid in substitution and design
of controls coupled with the knowledge of the physical state
of the substance. There are limitations to hazard banding
including unfamiliarity with R-phrases and H-statements,
GHS, lack of standardization of hazard phrases on SDSs,
degree of risk which may vary with the physical state, as
well as lack of expertise in translating the hazard phrases
by nontoxicologists. Even though the verification of these
286CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
methods needs more effort and they will not immediately
replace OELs, they can offer greater protection of workers
in situations where regulatory guidance is not available (or
may never become available).
For an early-career IH seeking a comparable banding
strategy in the United States to assist in GHS compliance for
a substance without authoritative recommendations and/or
an OEL, NIOSH’s OEB approach may be a good place to
start (187, 188). The OEB process took the CB approach to a
different place. It tightens up the toxicity assessment compo￾nent; however, it does not include the semi-quantitative expo￾sure assessment component that can be found in COSHH
Essentials or the EMKG-Expo-Tool and does not lead to
a control outcome. In the NIOSH Occupational Exposure
Band (OEB) Tier 1 process, substances are quickly and accu￾rately assessed by first sorting the substance into “bands”
C, D, and E based on toxicological potency and adverse
health effects associated with exposure using GHS hazard
codes (189, 242). Their Tier 2 approach sorts substances into
bands A–E when sufficient data are available to assign bands
with more confidence. It should be noted that the NIOSH
OEB range of bands B–E represents the lowest range of
exposure concentrations, while band A represents the highest
range, which is the opposite of the rating system used in the
COSHH Essentials ratings. The output of this process is an
occupational exposure band, which corresponds to a range
of exposure concentrations designed to be protective against
adverse health outcomes. NIOSH has validated this Tier 1
approach by comparing Tier 1 results for 600 substances
with both GHS codes and a full-shift OEL from an authori￾tative body and found that the Tier 1 banding protocol was
“successful” in that it was at least as protective as the OEL
> 80% of the time (188). By introducing the OEB approach
to the health and safety community in the United States and
openly requesting practical feedback, NIOSH identified two
primary themes that needed to be addressed:
1. OEB should not be performed for chemicals with
existing OELs.
2. The proposed NIOSH OEB document is complex.
The first item of feedback is relatively easy to address
through increasing and strengthening communication. The
second theme is a natural outcome of NIOSH experts devel￾oping a scientifically reliable and robust outcome; however,
the professional effort to perform Tier 2 evaluations will
always be more difficult and time consuming than the Tier
1 approach (189). To further aid end users, a user-friendly
interface was created as an online draft of the NIOSH OEB
e-Tool to be readily accessible for Tier 1 and Tier 2 assess￾ments and to expand the opportunity for users to apply and
trial this OEB process so that those utilizing this approach in
practice can offer further feedback to NIOSH to improve the
process and guide future related initiatives (190).
When faced with the dilemma of how to define acceptable
workplace exposures, early career IHs will need to utilize
and integrate a combination of traditional OELs; provisional,
internally developed, or proprietary OELs; OEB approaches;
and ancillary information like Skin Designations. Then, to
build on this knowledge, the early career hygienist can use
CB strategies beyond the OEB process – which is limited to
assessing health hazard information to determine acceptable
exposure ranges – and add a layer of risk exposure manage￾ment to directly link a hazard to a specified control measure.
6.2.2 Control Banding Tools – Bulk Chemicals
and Beyond
Similar to the CB tools available in the international sphere,
including CB tools developed by national authoritative
bodies and REACH-related qualitative chemical expo￾sure models, large corporations have also been internally
developing CB tools for their unique needs. Solvay, a
Belgium-based multinational chemical company, devel￾oped a Microsoft Excel-based Critical Exposure Screening
(CTES) tool to address the need for a “shop-floor” usable
tool that incorporated the use of advanced higher tier expo￾sure assessment models (191). The tool requires few inputs
by the user and is focused mostly on concentration, task
description, and duration – toxicological data including
OELs and internally developed OEBs are read automatically
from a database. The tool identifies an inhalation risk score
for both particulates and vapors, identifies skin hazards,
and gives users information on carcinogenic, mutagenic,
or reproductive toxin effects. The final result of the CTES
tool is one of three outcomes which are then banded into a
category defined by the acceptable concentrations associated
with the OELs or internal OEBs. The Green level is judged
as acceptable residual risk, whereas Grey Priority 1 and 2
levels require a more detailed exposure assessment and/or
control ranked by risk.
Smaller industries, categorized as SMEs, often lack
resources to hire IH professionals or lack the budget to
hire consulting expertise in this area. However, they still
have the desire to protect their workers and meet regula￾tory requirements. A Chemical Hazard Assessment and
Management Program (CHAMP) has been developed in
Canada by Chemscape to focus specifically on SMEs by
harnessing SDS information. As SDSs can be intimidating
in complexity for SMEs, CHAMP serves to digest and
combine SDS-related GHS hazard class, H-statements,
boiling points, and more with CB tools enabling a transfer
of IH knowledge to non-IHs (192). The CGS outcomes of
CHAMP are designed to simplify control information with
colors for RL outcomes paired with icons and images that
have been proven to have a significantly positive effect on
communication and long-term worker retention resulting
from an increase in attention, comprehension, recall, and
287PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
adherence. Risk management programs like this for SMEs
have been shown to beneficially affect changes as they are
easy to implement with the CGSs designed to be helpful
training aids for workers and are, therefore, more likely to
follow the appropriate measures (192).
On the control guidance side of the CB tool applica￾tions, there has been the development of banding strategies
for ventilation requirements in laboratories (193). Sweet and
Stuart (194) developed a Laboratory Ventilation Manage￾ment Program (LVMP) by using ANSI Z10 and ANSI Z9.5
and CB strategies to create a tool to establish institutional
target ventilation rates. The control bands were based on
laboratory spaces using air changes per hour (ACH) for occu￾pied (eight ACH and, conditionally, six ACH) and unoccu￾pied (four ACH and, conditionally, three ACH) lab spaces.
The operating conditions to be met included use of volatile
chemicals controlled by local ventilation, effectiveness of
ventilation in avoiding significant chemical vapor accumula￾tion, and effective housekeeping to avoid fugitive emissions.
This process also identified chemical use in laboratories
that required specialist review within the LVMP to deter￾mine the appropriate ACH for laboratories falling outside
these control bands (194). A comparable methodology was
also inspired by CB tools and strategies to provide OSHH
professionals with limited resources the ability to conduct
laboratory assessments using a hazard mapping method￾ology to assist OSHH management in risk ranking to make
informed decision recommendations to upper-level manage￾ment (195). Further examples include a UK-based respira￾tory selection tool (196) that has been evaluated with a broad
user base. The evaluation results demonstrate that 87% of
the outcomes were considered by the authors to be appro￾priate when users applied H-statements and 98% appropriate
when using process-generated substance scenarios (197). In
addition, the Institut de Recherche Robert-Sauvé en Santé et
en Sécurité du Travail (IRSST) has also developed a web￾based respiratory protection guide for bioaerosols that can
also be used in the healthcare, agricultural, and business
sectors (198, 199) and US OSHA has created an Advisor
Genius eTool to assist users in the selection of an appropriate
respirator based on the NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic
and the OSHA Respirator Standard (200).
In expanding CB concepts beyond management of bulk
chemicals, it is recognized that while hazards vary, two
criteria remain constant:(i) hazard, exposure, and RLs must
be derived using rigorous scientific principles and (ii) less
acceptable risks must be linked to increasingly stringent
controls, using increasingly conservative decision criteria
where knowledge is limited. While many questions about
the specifics of this process remain unanswered, the basic
premise of banding hazards, exposures, and controls holds
continued promise for applications beyond bulk chemicals
and for further refinement as screening tools for use by
OSHH experts and nonexperts. Promising applications
include industry-specific and hazard-specific tools. For
example, the UK HSE Silica Essentials series has made a
significant contribution toward the reduction of silica expo￾sures and potentially the occurrence of silicosis, which has
been on the international docket since 1935 (201). Another
novel approach was developed as a CB tool for the control of
infectious diseases on a university campus (202). This risk
assessment tool combines the likelihood of exposure and
severity of the disease to determine a graded-risk response
level outcome with response actions determined by the mode
of transmission (e.g. droplet, aerosol, surface, food/water,
or insect/vector borne). Other promising expansion-of￾range projects include ergonomics (202, 203), safety (205),
immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) situations
(206), beryllium (206), concentrated flavorings (207), damp
building environments (208), and glutaraldehyde in health
care settings (8).
A useful outcome of the CB paradigm is the develop￾ment of direct control advice that does not rely on risk
phrases, but which points the user to job-specific control
advice in professions such as dry cleaning, hairdressing,
pesticide application, and paint spraying (94, 138). Taking
this a step further, Silica Essentials directs users to control
advice sheets that are industry and task-based and do not
require the additional step of inputting exposure prediction
data (138). The WHOCC 2006–2010 Work Plan includes
efforts to implement and validate Silica Essentials in China
(quartz and concrete making), India (silica flour mills),
and South Africa (quarries). NIOSH is leading a special
focus on silica in Latin America where millions of workers
face uncontrolled exposures; this program will simplify the
advice sheets even further to build professional capacity and
increase technical knowledge in the highest risk industries.
Projects in Brazil (mining, mineral processing, ceramics,
and glass manufacturing) and Chile (mining, quarries, dental
labs, and stone crafts) should result in Spanish language
control advice that can be utilized throughout most of Latin
America, although Brazil would need them in Portuguese.
Hints of applied CB principles can also be seen in newer
occupational health and safety legislation. The adoption of
2016 Final Rule on Occupational Exposure to Crystalline
Silica in the Construction Industry (209) is incredible for
its sheer scope of influence in the United States – an esti￾mated 2.3 million workers are exposed to silica in 676 000
workplaces, with the number of lives saved per year esti￾mated by OSHA at 600. Building on the example of COSHH
Essentials CGSs, the OSHA 1926.1153 standard includes the
Table 1 Specified Exposure Control Methods, one of three
compliance options under the new standard. Table 1 provides
the many construction industry employers without the means
to access an IH with a table of task, duration, and location￾specific engineering, administrative, and PPE control guid￾ance. By following Table 1, employers will not have to estab￾lish alternative exposure control methods, including written
288CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
exposure assessments and follow-up air sampling that must
be performed each time there is a change in the produc￾tion process, control equipment, or work practices. AIHA’s
submission of comments on the final rule in 2014 supports
the use of Table 1 due to the avoidance of complicated and
possibly costly air sampling strategies required to capture the
inherent variability of exposures on a construction site, the
establishment of administrative controls including regulated
areas that will protect the co-located worker, and the dual
table format that incorporates a time-based task exposure (>
4 hours or <4 hours) that may reduce unnecessary respirator
use, among others.
6.2.3 Control Banding Tools – Moving Away from IH
CB ideas and toolkits have also been developed outside of
the IH realm. The Psychosocial Risk Management Euro￾pean Framework (PRIMA-EF) incorporates CB concepts
to integrate the hazards of chemical and physical stressors
such as solvents, noise, or stress into the realm of the
mental well-being of employees (210). This framework
acknowledges that the hazards of these stressors, in a social
and organization context, can contribute to different sorts
of harm such as the systemic stress that is manifested
from fear of exposure to harmful solvents. The need for
ergonomic toolkits is global, given that 40% of the world’s
occupational and work-related health costs are attributed
to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) (39). Toolkits for
the prevention of MSDs have an advantage over those for
chemicals in that new chemical products continue to be
created, whereas ergonomics has a finite group of well￾researched and defined risk factors and effective programs
(211, 212). Rather than presenting prescriptive guidance
such as specific joint positions, angles, postures and dura￾tions of tasks, the second edition of the ILO/International
Ergonomics Association (IEA) Ergonomics Checkpoints
(213) provided practical, pictorial advice for an even wider
range of workplace scenarios and could thus be the basis
of an ergonomics toolkit (203). A CB framework has also
been incorporated into the ILO’s Ergonomic Checkpoint
materials – publications that aim to reduce work-related
accidents and injuries by suggesting proven and inexpensive
ergonomic solutions such as better designed tools, use
of carts, materials-handling techniques, and workstation
arrangements. The original CheckPoints manual presents
132 realistic and flexible interventions that are aimed at
reducing injury in the workplace without the expense of
hiring consultants. The efforts of the ILO checkpoints
program have resulted in a series of three mobile applica￾tions, which address ergonomics (general and agriculture)
and stress prevention at work. Users can access detailed
checkpoints with illustrations, create custom checklists, and
prioritize and export notes in the workplace right from the
app. The Checkpoints program, presented as a multi-day
seminar with a hands-on component, has been tested in
developing countries and resulted in effective training at the
local level.
CB approaches for industrial safety professionals could
also play a major role in reducing the annual toll of nearly
6000 workplace deaths from acute traumatic injury in the
United States and 270 million nonfatal injuries internation￾ally (82, 214). Under the WHOCC umbrella, IOHA, part￾ners in The Netherlands, and the Canadian Industrial Acci￾dent Prevention Agency (IAPA) are incorporating simpli￾fied solutions in an Injury Prevention Management Toolkit
using a CB-like safety strategy known as Barrier Banding
(215). Like the banding of chemicals by toxicity, clas￾sifications already exist for various variables of accident
causation. Banding safety risks for selection of appropriate
barriers for injury prevention is similar to selecting appro￾priate engineering controls based on chemical hazard bands
in CB. Barriers to injury, including management factors, are
strongly related to the quality of safety management systems
and are important parameters for risk prevention (204). The
Barrier Banding model would apply safety phrases to acci￾dent scenarios or related situations and guide the user to the
type of precautions needed to prevent traumatic injuries (215,
216). Kudryavtsev et al. (217) developed a comparable risk
management system for industrial safety field practitioners
to assist in performing risk assessment of accidents based
on expert evaluation data to assist in the development of
guidelines to develop preventative barriers and their main￾tenance. The implementation of this RL assessment protocol
assists in providing the right information to management to
prioritize decisions necessary to achieve emergency preven￾tion, the ongoing assessment of safety barrier maintenance
proactively, and accident prevention measure effectiveness
overall. Another CB approach applied for industrial safety
was produced for craft making shops in higher education
to simplify the identification, evaluation, and controlling
of hazards to improve safety, tailor controls, and prioritize
specific needs based on the level of risk (218).
With health and safety now well represented among
the CB toolkit strategies, it was only natural that the
growth of banding would expand into the environmental
arena to encompass the EHS professions. In the OSHH
world, risk communication among environmental analysts
is often limited in discussions of work-related environ￾mental contaminants due in part to the depth and breadth
of applicable regulatory requirements. Coleman and Zalk
(219) developed a qualitative, risk-based CB strategy for the
assessment and control of potential environmental contam￾inants using the same 4 × 4 risk matrix approach based on
severity and probability that is also used in other OSHH￾related CB models and risk management in general. Using
this same graded approach not only provided a simplified
risk assessment and control format that is easy for environ￾mental analysts to use, but it also provides a standardized
289PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
and beneficial approach to risk communication to address
EHS professionals, management, and workers alike. The CB
model they created provides an effective means for deter￾mining standardized responses and controls for common
environmental issues based on the level of risk. The model
is designed for integration within occupational health and
safety management systems like ISO 45001 to provide
a multidisciplinary environmental and ORM approach.
Qualitative environmental CB strategies are now available
to identify controls for tasks in the United States and for
addressing other local, regional, and national regulations
for construction, research activities, facility maintenance,
and spill remediation that affect air, water, soil, and waste
disposal (219).
6.2.4 Control Banding Acceptance by National
Organizations
Recently, CB approaches have been integrated into guidance
developed by both industry groups and consensus standard
organizations outside of the realm of IH-focused organiza￾tions such as NIOSH, ANSI, and the ACS (194, 220). In
2015, a subgroup of the ANSI A10 Construction and Demo￾lition standards committee, with support from US labor
groups, published ANSI/ASSE A10.49 Control of Chem￾ical Health Hazards in Construction and Demolition Oper￾ations. Working on the knowledge that most construction
companies do not employ a full-time certified IH (CIH) and
have limited monetary resources and experienced personnel
for collecting personal air samples, the A10.49 standard
provides a CB framework that combines toxicity informa￾tion and exposure potential much in the same way as the
COSHH Essentials in the sense that operations involving low
hazard/low toxicity operations can be handled with simple
precautions prescribed by a health and safety generalist,
while higher toxicity/high exposure scenarios require a Job
Health Hazard Analysis plan (JHHAs). The A10.49 standard
suggests that the JHHAs should be authored by risk assessors
with increasing credentials based on a sliding scale of risk,
from the contractor-level up to “qualified person,” such as
a CIH.
In response to a 2014 OSHA request for information,
the North American Building Trades Union (NABTU)
submitted formal comments requesting that OSHA investi￾gate modeling future regulation on a task-based CB approach
like that in ANSI 10.49 standard to find a way forward in the
current difficult climate for updating OELs (221). Likewise,
on a recommendation from the US Chemical Safety Board,
the Hazard Identification and Evaluation Task Force of the
ACS’s Committee on Chemical Safety released chemical
hazard assessment toolkits including a CB approach that
combines fire, reactivity, chronic toxicity, and acute toxicity
hazard schemes to band substances in one of four Chemical
Safety Levels. ACS has published corresponding generic
facility-level, training, oversight, response, and PPE control
recommendations. Despite having a well-educated member￾ship base with an above-average comprehension of the
physical properties of dangerous substances, ACS chose to
create a process that was simple and straightforward enough
for all participants in laboratory work, including chemists,
laboratory techs, and facility/maintenance personnel, to
understand the basic requirements (220).
6.3 Control Banding – Multidisciplinary
EHS Applications
The variety of hazards (chemical, ergonomic, safety, and
environmental) faced by construction workers logically leads
to the incorporation of individual toolkits into a Construc￾tion Toolbox. The ICBWs have facilitated toolkit approaches
for ergonomics, silica, and safety in a manner that includes
the provision of national-level guidance and coordination
of pilot projects at a more local level. Other toolboxes are
being developed in China, and at The Center for Construc￾tion Research and Training (CPWR) (222). Toward this end,
CPWR has developed an Exposure Control Database as an
interactive tool for the construction industry that helps to
predict exposure to the workplace hazards of noise, lead,
silica, and welding fumes (223). In addition, the WikiSafe
Workplace under development for open access online for
professional feedback and improvement is an innovative
approach modeled on Wikipedia (224, 225). The ORM
Toolbox approach is an outcome of this coordination, which
has broadened the CB model to include a more comprehen￾sive exposure control basis for universal industries such as
construction. A toolbox addressing these composite expo￾sures by trade and task is now in development within Stoffen￾manager (226). An international working group that included
the United States, the United Kingdom, and The Nether￾lands has collaborated on producing a Construction Toolbox
model for task-specific approaches across the OSHH disci￾plines. The outcome of this process has led to a revolutionary
approach to simplify multidisciplinary risk communication
issues both within and between the OSHH professions as
well as with the construction trade management and workers.
Zalk et al. (227) presented a framework and protocol
design for a construction industry risk management toolbox
as the construction industry needs a comprehensive, system￾atic approach to assess and control occupational risks.
These risks span several professional OSHH disciplines,
emphasized by multiple international occupational research
agenda projects including falls, electrocution, noise, silica,
welding fumes, and MSD. Yet, the International Social
Security Association says, “whereas progress has been
made in safety and health, the construction industry is still
a high-risk sector” (228). As SMEs employ about 80% of
the world’s construction workers and CB has been effective
290CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
for this sector, it seems that this strategy would also provide
an appropriate, simplified approach for reducing multi￾disciplinary work-related risks. The Construction Toolbox
design includes international input on multidisciplinary
approaches for performing a qualitative risk assessment
on the severity and probability of a construction project
within 4 × 4 risk matrix scoring framework. The outcome
of this scoring determines a risk “band” for a given project
that is used to identify the appropriate level of training
to oversee construction work. Identifying a graded risk
banding of projects is extremely important for planning
and budgeting construction efforts. However, as this risk
banding can be performed before the project begins, the
input parameters for severity and probability can be adjusted
in planning by modifying task parameters to ensure that
the right level of oversight expertise is available in advance
and fits the projected costs. Each of the construction
project tasks is also given a graded risk Control Level
(CL1–CL4) commensurate to risk that assists in identifying
the appropriate control methods to perform the work safely.
This format harnesses multiple solutions-based national
programs and publications for controlling construction￾related risks with simplified approaches across the OSHH
professions (227).
A more comprehensive occupational risk model based on
CB is the Risk Level Based Management System (RLBMS)
that is designed to focus OSHH resources on the highest
risk procedures at a given workplace (229, 230). The model
utilizes CB with a stratification of four RLs for a variety
of commonly performed maintenance and support activities
to characterize risk consistently for research and develop￾ment related tasks. RLBMS creates an auditable tracking
of activities, the maximization of OSHH professional field
time, and standardizes a graded approach to documenta￾tion as a control outcome commensurate to a given task’s
RL. Validation of RLs and their exposure control effec￾tiveness is collected in a traditional quantitative collection
regime for regulatory auditing. However, qualitative risk
assessment methods can also be used within this valida￾tion process. Participatory approaches are used throughout
the RLBMS process. Decision making at the worker level
assists in both empowering employees to actively partici￾pate in reducing their work-related risks as well as gathering
and presenting control information for all OSHH-related
hazards that have regulatory-based expectations and required
documentation (88). Workers are involved in all phases of
building, maintaining, and improving this model, which also
serves to improve the implementation of established controls.
Linking the RLBMS model to a comprehensive OSHH
database assists in the calibration of risk-based decisions
across OSHH disciplines and produces an auditable trail
that affords the consistency necessary to perform work in a
healthy and safe environment within a regulatory framework.
The RLBMS has been recommended as a complement
to IH staff support as a multidisciplinary decision-making
framework for both its utility in the absence of OELs as
well as the strength of its participatory approaches for
harnessing the knowledge base of workers to create work￾able and implemented control expectations (16). In addition,
the environmental CB model described above (219) utilizes
the same multidisciplinary CB strategies for delineating risk
and complements the existing RLBMS. This approach offers
an opportunity to expand into a singular occupational and
environmental risk management process that also improves
risk communications within and between EHS professionals,
workers, and management.
RLBMS is also a proven method to reduce the amount
of resources needed to produce auditable documentation of
work activities in a highly regulated facility (230). Under
the RLBMS, qualitative risk assessment strategies have
succeeded in efficiently managing risk and producing satis￾factory documentation for various regulatory authorities at
a national research laboratory. Work activities are assigned
a RL based upon the probability of exposure and severity
of outcomes for each of the hazards presented. RL2 and
RL3 assessment outcomes delineate the important decision
of determining when to actively involve a member of the
EHS team in work planning due to a reasonable chance of
a regulatory derived reportable incident. Using a Bayesian
statistical model, a quantitative validation was performed
on one component of the RLBMS – “pre-analyzed tasks”
(PATs) – which are standardized assessments for routine
labor tasks with prescribed work methods and controls and
associated risk levels. As part of the RLBMS’s initiative to
shift resources away from low-risk activities and towards
high-risk activities, EHS personnel developed a database
that streamlined risk assessments called the Risk Assessment
and Control (RAC) database. It serves as a semi-automated
risk assessment platform that provides EHS professionals
with tools, including CB tools, and information to conduct
their assessments in accordance with established procedures
and standards. To perform a risk assessment, one enters
information regarding the task’s location, work operation,
and hazards. The results of RLBMS’s qualitative risk assess￾ments show that long-term efforts succeeded in redirecting
resources away from low-risk activities. It was found that
89% of the resulting RLs are 2 or lower, the RLs at which
EHS involvement is not directly needed, saving a consider￾able amount of effort from EHS personnel because, if PAT
procedures are followed, new risk assessments will not be
needed when these tasks are performed. The work envi￾ronment at a national research laboratory shares important
characteristics with the state of IH worldwide – it is tasked
with developing rigorously validated risk management
systems capable of reducing the amount of resources spent
on routine tasks and efficiently prescribing control measures
to a growing array of novel agents. Critiques of the RLBMS
291PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
and its CB-based components can inform developing CB
strategies on how to operate more effectively and accurately
(230).
6.4 Control Banding – See Workplaces
Through a Professional’s Eyes
Newer IHs and OSHH professionals around the world are
often found in situations where staff and funding resources
do not afford luxuries like precision, time, and experience.
The overarching strategies of CB also help our new IH
with the issues presented in the expansive high bay of the
production building. The banding strategies are also seen as
a “binning” of relative risk for each hazard presented, sepa￾rating into bands the level of risk presented by each of the
operations that are part of these manufacturing procedures.
When an experienced IH walks into large high bay of activity,
it is their experience and wisdom that initiates the process
of binning of risk and priority for all that they see. CB is
in its essence the translation of this professional experience
through calibrated eyes as it is filtered into more simplified
terms of figuring out which of the four containers of risk
these hazards belong to. Therefore, the mechanics of system￾atically putting banding techniques into practice begins the
rough transferring of professional wisdom into the mindset
of a newer IH. Many more experienced IHs that learn of CB
and its applications begin to appreciate this aspect of trans￾ferring knowledge and its growing value in practice. It is also
fair to say others with comparable experience find it all too
simplified, lacking the precision that comprise the scientific
standards of the profession.
Control Banding, the New IH, and The All
Too Familiar Scenario
Now our newly-minted IH has some very important
information to assist their work in the office of Big
Consulting Firm LLC. The assignment at the 350-
employee chemical manufacturer on the outskirts of
town with many serious violation notices from OSHA
may just seem a bit more manageable. In the follow￾up meeting with the sole full-time health and safety
person on-site, a newer IH should begin by addressing
the OSHA regulations behind the stairway fall hazards
with a lack of railing, discuss the observed issues
that are likely behind the company’s noncompliance
with the respiratory protection standard violations, and
review the elements of the energy control programs
that the chemical manufacturer needs to ensure are
understood and implemented as part of developing
a new training program. A lot of this may seem
straightforward, but now our new IH has a better under￾standing of how CB strategies can help prioritize these
issues, assess the risks presented, identify controls
commensurate to risk, and offer a standardized risk
communication to involve the workers in addressing
these OSHA violations.
Observations in our fictional high bay are simply
extensions of these situations and CB can indeed be
helpful putting the numerous issues in order of priority
and investment. The employee reliance on machine
interlocks can potentially expose them to high severity
injuries, although the level of probability may depend
on whether the manufacturer has a LOTO program
that simply is not being implemented consistently. If
they do have a program with spotty implementation,
it is likely an RL3 that requires working with the
employees to develop an implementation and oversite
protocol as part of a new LOTO training requirement.
If there is no program, then the increased probability
of a severe injury elevates the risk matrix outcome to
an RL4. The side room’s overwhelming amine-odor,
lack of local ventilation, and employees working over
open tanks without respirators should quickly initiate
an intervention. With the input of several employees,
SDSs and online access, our newer IH can quickly
derive the appropriate type of engineering control
to recommend to management and identify the best
respirator type and filters that are required in the
interim by using their choice of available online CB
tools described above for chemical hazards and respi￾rator selection resources. Although it appears unlikely
that they have an appropriate respiratory protection
program from appearances, it will be good to confirm
this and use the same RL outcomes and path forward
as with the LOTO issues as a solid training protocol
seems to be in order. The dumping of one-ton poly bulk
bags of powdered pigment into hoppers for use around
the plant requires a similar CB tool evaluation at this
point source as well as open exposure sources down￾stream. Determining whether there are any additional
controls being used in the dichloromethane-based paint
process will be necessary, since the spray paint booth’s
exhaust ventilation will certainly be inadequate for this
carcinogen and this OSHA chemical-specific regula￾tion is most likely not being followed.
The lone EHS manager on-site does indeed need
the new IH’s help but is also fortunate that they are
now armed with a CB toolbox in addition to our IH’s
newly-gained professional knowledge. After sorting
the highest priority OSHH issues out and presenting
them in the simplified risk communication that CB
292CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
provides, the manager will quickly understand that
limited resources and primary focus on general safety
training need to be re-assessed and new priorities
need to be set. With only $1000 for sampling and
analysis, the IH knows to begin with the regulatory
expectations of dichloromethane unless the employer
can immediately substitute for less hazardous paint
strippers if the process can be performed compa￾rably without increasing exposures. The IH knows
from overwhelming smells and limited visibility that
the other chemical substance exposures may be far
too high to be acceptable; however, the immediate
implementation of engineering and administrative
controls are more important than expending resources
on sampling and analysis. The best investment of
sampling resources will be after these controls, that
the CB tools assisted in identifying, are put into place
to verify that the controls are indeed appropriate
to reduce employee exposures to acceptable levels.
Some of the 40 billable hours should be spent first
with the on-site EHS manager to discuss how all the
manufacturer’s processes and facilities fit well into
an RLBMS and how participatory processes with the
employees can help develop the controls and trainings
necessary to protect themselves.
After a review of the company’s written health and
safety programs and the initial prioritization of these
recommendations and requirements, the final report
to the on-site EHS manager, plant manager, and the
parent company’s corporate health and safety manager
will nearly write itself. Well, perhaps not write itself,
but the inclusion of CB strategies and processes will
certainly help in identifying required engineering and
administrative control investments, OSHH priorities
for the manufacturer, and the need for additional EHS
staff to accomplish these objectives. In addition, the
simplified risk communication that CB provides also
flows from the same risk matrix used in corporate
office board rooms. CB also speaks to economic and
cost/benefit analysis outcomes and can, therefore, be
a wonderful tool in assisting the new IH to frame
the report’s recommendations in a manner that can
help secure additional resources from corporate to
reduce the severity and probability of further regu￾latory violations, worker compensation costs, and of
course the protection of employees from work-related
injuries and illnesses. The utility of CB may also help
our IH by impressing Big Consulting Firm LLC with
how much has been accomplished in the 40 hours
allotted.
7 PART VI: DISCUSSION
CB remains a subject of much enthusiastic praise as well
as objective criticism. With all the growth and regulatory
acceptance of the banding strategies, there remains a lack
of understanding that CB strategies are intended for applica￾tions in specific situations, primarily in cases of inadequate
data to assess toxicity and/or exposure, or in situations in
which IH expertise is not available, affordable, or accessible.
CB strategies are not intended to replace traditional indus￾trial approaches, specifically OELs and monitoring of air
contaminant levels, and in fact, many proponents of these
approaches have made clear statements about the need to
continue to monitor worker exposures.
Perhaps the greatest strength of CB is as a potentially
powerful tool for knowledge management. Knowledge
management is an emerging field focusing on assessing the
creation, transfer, and utilization of knowledge to address
specific challenges (231). The development of hazard control
guidance materials and the application of CB strategies
provide the means for effective OSHH knowledge manage￾ment. The global explosion in electronic communications
has shown itself to be well suited to facilitate management
and transfer of this knowledge. Realistically, many of the
several billion workers throughout the world, and even
many millions in the United States, will never benefit from
direct OSHH expertise; they may, however, benefit from the
nonexpert advice transferred via CB strategies.
An important criticism of CB that the newer IH must keep
in mind is the attitude that CB reduces IH to a one-size-fits￾all set of controls that may entirely omit process knowledge
and nuances obtained over years of practice. For example,
in their written comments to OSHA regarding Table 1 in
the 2016 OSHA Final Silica Rule, AIHA commented that
several of the tasks in the less than 4 hours/day column that
do not require any respiratory protection may be problematic
in light of IHs knowledge that silica exposure can be widely
influenced by numerous variables (e.g. weather conditions,
topography of surface required to be flush with shrouds) and
their unpredictable combinations. The confluence of these
factors, coupled with no requirement for initial or periodic air
monitoring under the Table 1 scheme, may lead to unknown
overexposures and misplaced confidence in the effectiveness
of engineering controls without verification.
In general, model validations of toolkits are well
described in the literature. On the contrary, operational
analyses are – to our knowledge – very rarely found in
peer-reviewed literature. Tool developers mostly have an
idea about implementation aspects, but this idea is based
on ad-hoc information rather than on a thorough analysis.
This means that a “plan, do, check, act, verify cycle” in the
293PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
development process and toolkit implementation is most
often incomplete: the “check and act” in operational analyses
is missing, as is “verify” to ensure recommended controls
remain functionally in place. Consequently, it is often not
known if toolkits in use lead to successful interventions at
individual workplaces. Not unraveling this puzzle might lead
to virtually safe workplaces without knowing if workers are
truly protected. Ensuring these steps are complete may be
the most important goal for the future of the IH profession.
7.1 CB and the State of the IH Profession
An apprehension often expressed by IH professionals is that
by providing a less expensive alternative to IH expertise,
CB will weaken and possibly eliminate the profession.
Managers of industries of all sizes are under tremendous
financial pressures, and the OSHH department is often
the first to be hit (232). The US system is moving in the
direction of encouraging the pure IH specialist to become
an OSHH generalist (178). Offering managers an option
like CB may be an economically wise decision that may
lead further away from IH expertise, resulting in the short
term in solutions without oversight and thus potentially
harmful consequences. In the longer term, these economic
decisions may result in less demand for IH professionals,
and eventual closure of university IH programs (as charged
in the United Kingdom, see Refs (69, 70). The population
of IH professionals in the United States is currently flat or
declining and is mirrored by flat or declining membership
in professional associations due perhaps in part to inability
of the profession to publicize its value to the greater society
at large (232). However, if widely promoted, CB strategies
may present an opportunity to strengthen the IH profession.
Several benefits may accrue when an SME manager utilizes
CB. If awareness that employees are at risk is followed by
the implementation of workplace controls, then employees
will have received the benefits of IH services in absentia
(17). In addition, CB toolkits like COSHH Essentials direct
managers to seek specialist advice at a particular level of
risk. If the manager does this, then both workers and the IH
profession will have been served.
As part of an appropriate CB strategy, it is as necessary to
acknowledge that basic IH controls can be identified through
CGSs and checklists as there is a necessity for a threshold
level of potential risk (based on toxicity and exposure) that
would indicate that professional IH advice and consultation
should be sought. In COSHH Essentials, this threshold level
is at Control Band 4, the highest of the four levels. On a
country-by-country basis, it may be appropriate to lower this
threshold, depending on several factors including workplace
conditions, availability of IH expertise and resources, the
types of industries involved, the size of the enterprise, and
the qualifications of the responsible person, for example (8)
• Level 1. Operator, manager.
• Level 2. Person competent in a specialty (by select
education and training).
• Level 3. Professional IH (e.g. CIH or ROH).
• Level 4. Expert in area (e.g. ventilation, enclosed
systems).
By raising or lowering the level of risk at which special￾ists’ advice is recommended, the designers or implementers
of a particular CB strategy could achieve an appropriate
balance between reserving professional tasks for those
persons qualified by education, training, and experience, and
“off-loading” solutions to the proven and routine categories
of CB. (Continued development of task-specific “Direct
Advice” and CGSs will further facilitate the “off-loading”
of determination of recommended controls to nonexpert
managers.) In contrast, reserving higher levels of risk and
expertise on controls to professional practitioners can take
full advantage of their understanding of the science and
the art of IH (e.g. dermal exposures, biological monitoring,
mixtures, and by-products).
Many CB strategies are intended for use by those without
technical IH or OSHH expertise, thus training in the use of
the methodology is essential. CGSs provide an excellent tool
for assisting with this as they provide a standardized checklist
approach to help identify necessary controls and can help
in implementing organizational health and safety programs.
Training programs should be evaluated with respect to the
following: target (e.g. was the training provided to those with
authority to make decisions), reception (e.g. was the training
offered sufficiently often, by a source considered trustworthy,
in an environment conducive to processing), and outcome
(e.g. was the training implemented, and was the system used
in the correct manner).
7.2 Lessons Learned from CB in Practice
Labor inspectorates are the bellwether of CB in greater
Europe. Some countries, like Belgium, have an older guard
that do not yet accept new approaches like CB. However,
wherever they are open to alternatives, CB is gaining strength
if not already strong. Eastern Europe does not yet have the
regulation, regulatory oversight, and/or labor inspectorate
infrastructure to be like the current REACH regulations in
rich EU countries. They are interested in REACH-related
models, but at this point, it is too advanced. Therefore, they
are much like other EDCs and perhaps developing countries
where they are most happy with the basics of CB making
a big difference. Generalist OHS mindset is now the future
of the profession in most of the world and the global work￾force. In EDCs, the IH profession works in the bottom two
layers of the pyramid (Figure 3), moving up into OEL-based
quantitative sampling where funding and resources afford
294CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
this luxury. This is not a limitation of CB that drives the use
of the tools, but a byproduct of the economic business model
that drives the necessity and funding levels for EHS oversight
within companies. Companies also use the same risk matrix
model with RL outcomes that has become so pervasive in
CB, although their application is in upper management board
rooms and their risk inputs for severity and probability are for
economic risk and outcome costs of work-related injury and
illness. In addition to CB applications, the OSHH professions
should also become more proficient in using this risk matrix
to develop economic arguments for increasing EHS oversight
funding levels. With now over two decades of CB in practice,
there are important lessons learned from the application of
these strategies from the informal workplace to the executive
board room that can truly benefit the IH profession:
• Risk Assessment Required in Regulation. Where regu￾lations are strong for making risk assessments manda￾tory, the opportunity for CB flourishes. However, even
where these regulations are strong, the level of enforce￾ment is a key factor for the corporate sensitivity to
OSHH-related economic risks. An equality of effort
must be prioritized to make risk assessments a regula￾tory requirement where necessary while simultaneously
ensuring that enforcement remains active and knowl￾edgeable. Many risk assessments focus on preventing
incidents and accidents to ensure workers go home safe
and do not consider chronic health issues.
• Labor Inspectorate Education. The labor inspectorate
is also a key factor, where it is necessary, even in
developed countries, for them to be trained to under￾stand the value of CB and its appropriate place in the
OSHH toolbox. Where any of these factors are weak,
the basics of CB are strongest. However, both OSHH
professionals and the labor inspectorate must be trained
to know how these CB tools work, where they fit best
in the OHS Generalists toolbox, and how CB is most
optimally applied.
• Maximizing Resources. CB is a great screening tool
for prioritizing investment of limited EHS resources
and budgets. CB is useful to recognize when an IH
is needed and when it is not; a low toxicity chemical
could be resolved with a CGS and the IH assigned to
higher-value tasks more suitable to them. CB may be
the optimum tool for addressing hazards for which there
is little or no scientific information. The cumulative
effort moving forward is to find the best place to inte￾grate CB into the training of all affected parties. OSHH
professionals need it integrated into their university
courses. Labor inspectorates need to have it included
as part of their professional workshops and conferences
to update those who oversee regulatory enforcement.
OSHH generalists need to learn of CB’s strengths and
weaknesses as well as how these tools work so they can
minimize input error. EHS managers need to learn how
CB can help maximize limited budgets for prioritization
of their staff’s time and effort.
• CB as Risk Communication. Wherever in the world
there are individuals seeking to learn about the OSHH
professions, we must integrate CB into their learning
material. CB has proven itself internationally as the
best risk communication tool for what the IH profession
does and how we make decisions for optimum controls.
Corporate board rooms do not need to learn about CB;
however, we as professionals need to learn how to
discuss economic risks and costs at that level using
the same terminology and risk communication that CB
offers us as an outcome of its standardized risk matrix
models. Corporations understand what RL3 or RL4
means; they just have to know that their EHS funding
can reduce the level of risk to afford them a better
bottom line overall.
• Healthy Workplaces Globally. Developing countries
and EDCs should strive to make their national insti￾tutes of health (NIHs) more fluent in CB. NIHs must
establish close links with local and regional universities
to integrate OSHH-related training and professional
development and OSHH knowledge sustainability.
Organizations like Workplace Health Without Borders
(WHWB) and the Occupational Hygiene Training
Association (OHTA) can assist with CB- and OSHH￾related trainings and building toward this sustainability.
However, it is essential that this process is tied to the
development of national regulations that include risk
assessment requirements, OSHH-related professions
that also include IH specifically, and then to the national
support for a labor inspectorate that is active in the field
enforcing regulations and that they also understand the
scientifically proven and reliable CB methods.
• Quality Requires Quantitative. A necessary message to
all IHs and OSHH professionals, young and old; CB
strategies will not and should not rid the workplace of
quantitative exposure assessments. Work-related expo￾sures to hazards will always be rife with variability and
the quantitative measurement and analysis will always
be an essential component of the IH profession (1, 135,
233). With CB there is indeed a new tool in the profes￾sional toolbox and we must ensure that the outcomes
of its application truly reduce work-related risks and
fulfill our obligation to protect the workers of the world
(82). However, consistently honing its utility on the
whetstone of professional experience and science is a
necessary exercise to ensure ongoing innovations like
CB are consistently improved to become an essential
tool in workplaces of the future (234).
• Unknowns Require CB. Risk perception is an impor￾tant component in the consideration and identification
295PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
of multidisciplinary OSHH and EHS risks in the work￾place, as findings show that risk perceptions associ￾ated with emerging technologies are easier to predict
at the individual level than manufacturing-related risks
(235). It has become widely acknowledged that CB can
be useful for those managing risks and in simplifying
otherwise complex risks, especially for occupational
hazards with limited information; however, in scientific
research arenas like epidemiology, it is considered a
less useful tool (236). CB has proven it can be a gold
standard for unknowns, as with nanomaterials, and can
certainly do so for other future challenges.
• Harnessing Databases and Modeling. CB has also
proven itself as valuable for both multidisciplinary
applications and as a framework for environmental
and occupational risk management programs. The
more quantitative the exposure assessment measure￾ments are that become integrated into databases, the
more strength is given to programmers to develop
models with increased confidence for risk assessment
and control. There is a tremendous effort in Asia to
develop and test these models and the future of the
profession requires more data to feed this process.
CB offers a framework to both standardize the input
of these measurements and apply outcomes of these
models across the global industries and to strengthen
risk management programs. Perhaps it can be seen as
a shared responsibility to professionals and workers
alike that we strive to learn, teach, and apply CB
internationally, while ensuring that we verify controls
consistently.
8 PART VII: SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS,
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The obvious goal of any CB strategy is to reduce the burden
of occupational injury and illness. Wider application of CB
should increase public understanding of the need to control
occupational exposures to chemicals and other hazards,
leading to an increased recognition of the need for IH exper￾tise and useful solution-based databases. CB strategies are
clearly not the solution to assessment and management of
all occupational hazards. There are undoubtedly situations
in which CB cannot provide the precision and accuracy
necessary to protect worker health; alternatively, there are
undoubtedly situations in which CB will provide a higher
level of control than is necessary. Despite these limitations,
CB strategies have the potential to be excellent screening
tools in the hands of both nonexperts and of IHs. They can
be an integral part of a tiered approach to risk assessment,
in which simpler tools are used at a screening level, to be
followed by a more complex approach as the need arises or
is indicated by the situation (237). Some experts have taken
this concept a step further, insisting that CB strategies must
be integrated into a tiered, continuous improvement approach
to exposure/risk assessment and management if they are to
achieve their full potential (238).
CB has been found to be most useful where there is
an absence of information (e.g. no OELs) or an absence
of expertise (e.g. SMEs and in EDCs) (1, 8). Many CB
toolkit approaches have benefited from the COSHH Essen￾tials and their strategies have been validated by experts to
ensure an appropriate usage for SMEs in developed coun￾tries, for example, Stoffenmanager (116, 239). With nanopar￾ticulate exposure and its many toxicological and quantita￾tive measurement uncertainties, however, it can be argued at
this time that the CB approaches such as the CB Nanotool
may in fact be superior to traditional IH methods (162, 163,
176).
The United States does have an implicit requirement
to protect workers, but it does not have the explicit legal
requirement of the United Kingdom that risk assessments be
performed for all chemicals in the workplace. The United
States, does, however, face a similar situation in that there
are literally thousands of chemicals in use, the vast majority
of which are not covered by an OEL. Similarly, there is a
lack of professional expertise; at one time it was said that
there was less than 1 AIHA member for every 12 000 workers
in the United States. With an increasingly reduced member￾ship for AIHA, that differential is continually expanding. The
need for risk assessment tools that can be utilized both by
OSHH professionals and by nonexperts will only continue
to grow as the impact of E.U. REACH regulations is realized
in the United States (112, 229, 240–242). CB strategies offer
a method to expand worker protection in the face of limited
knowledge and expertise. In considering these approaches,
the following recommendations should be kept in mind:
1. The IH profession needs to be treated as a scarce
resource. Until this noble profession grows suffi￾ciently to be available to the global workforce, there
will be a need for CB and its related qualitative risk
assessment and risk management strategies.
2. Any CB model must be utilized in the context of
a complete IH program, including training, health
surveillance, and where appropriate, exposure moni￾toring, interpretation, and control.
3. Guidance should be developed on circumstances
under which personal monitoring should be conducted
(e.g. highly toxic substances, higher-level control
strategies, required by regulations). Monitoring
should be periodically repeated to determine if
controls have deteriorated over time.
296CONTROL BANDING: BACKGROUND, EVOLUTION, AND APPLICATION
4. A national body could provide important guidance
in implementation of CB in the United States by,
for example, standardizing terminology, developing
a uniform and standardized protocol to update new
information in hazard statements, and ensuring that
adequate margins of safety are in place. This body
should also consider assigning some chemicals to
higher hazard bands to provide greater margins of
safety. Alignment of liquids and solids should be
standardized to mg m−3 metrics.
5. Additional routes of exposure, specifically dermal
absorption, must be considered along with inhalation
exposures.
6. Adoption of the GHS has contributed to ensuring
the standardization of information available on labels
and safety data sheets internationally, but it requires
additional efforts to ensure that it becomes a truly
global standard in national regulations.
7. The control level reserved for “specialists” should be
carefully evaluated, with thought given to assigning
Levels 3 and perhaps 2 to professional IHs. Specific
issues (e.g. multiple exposures, mixtures, hot
processes, spray applications, concentration cut￾off values) should also be reserved for professional
evaluation.
8. Additional information should be provided on CGSs,
for example, contact information for qualified consul￾tants or professional associations.
9. Research should continue in the validation of CB
approaches. Development of an open-access database
would facilitate validation. Slight revision of docu￾mentation collected by OSHA and NIOSH during site
visits could contribute greatly to validation efforts.
Research funds should be reserved specifically for
prospective studies.
10. Incorporation of CB strategies in OSHH manage￾ment systems would ensure that when adopted at the
company level, the assessments are subject to peri￾odic review. The Plan-Do-Check-Act-VERIFY cycle
was updated with CB in mind, ensuring the verifica￾tion of controls and reduction of work-related risk is
a required step in risk management strategies.

305OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
John Howard and Steven Smith
1 INTRODUCTION TO THE FEDERAL
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
AND HEALTH ACT
State laws addressing workplace safety and health can be
traced back to the early nineteenth century, but federal laws
addressing the prevention of job-related injuries and illnesses
were only enacted in the mid-twentieth century. In 1936, the
Congress passed the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act1 as
a part of President Roosevelt’s New Deal legislation. The
Walsh–Healey Act not only established overtime as work
in excess of eight hours per day (i.e. what we now know
as the “40-hour workweek”) but also established the first
federal government workplace safety and health standards.
From 1952 to the late 1960s, a number of other federal laws
were enacted to prevent worker injury and illness. Among
these laws were the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act
of 1952,2 the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation
Act of 1958,3 the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards
Act of 1962,4 the McNamara–O’Hara Service Contract Act
of 1965,5 and the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act
of 1969.6
It was not until latter third of the twentieth century that,
for the first time in the American history, comprehensive
federal legislation regulating workplace safety and health
was considered by Congress. On 17 December 1970, the
Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act
of 1970 (“OSH Act”),7 which became effective on 28 April
1971. The OSH Act represents the first occupational safety
and health legislation of national scope. As Congress stated
in 1970, the purpose of the OSH Act was “…to assure so far
Patty’s Industrial Hygiene, Seventh Edition. Edited by Barbara Cohrssen.

This chapter is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the United States of America.
as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe
and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human
resources…”8
The OSH Act has generated considerable administrative
and federal judicial law since its enactment nearly 50 years
ago. This chapter provides an overview of the major provi￾sions of the OSH Act as they have been administratively
enforced and interpreted judicially in the years since its
enactment.
1.1 Entities Responsible for Implementing
the OSH Act
The Secretary of the United States Department of Labor
(Secretary) is responsible for implementing the OSH Act.
When the OSH Act became effective, the Department of
Labor (DOL) administratively created Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) to carry out the respon￾sibilities of the Secretary under the OSH Act. OSHA is
headed by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational
Safety and Health. The Assistant Secretary is responsible
for, among other things, adopting and enforcing occupational
safety and health standards and regulations, assessing civil
penalties, referring cases to the U.S. Department of Justice
for possible criminal prosecution, and evaluating, approving,
and monitoring state occupational safety and health enforce￾ment plans and consultation grants.
Section 12(a) of the OSH Act establishes the Occu￾pational Safety and Health Review Commission (Review
Commission) as an independent agency to adjudicate OSHA
enforcement actions brought by the Secretary.9 The Review
307PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
Commission is composed of three members appointed by the
President for a term of six years. The Review Commission’s
chair is authorized to appoint such administrative law judges
as the chair finds necessary to assist in the work of the
Commission.
Sections 20 and 21 of the OSH Act give the Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) (now named the
United States Department of Health and Human Services
or HHS) broad authority to conduct experimental research
relating to occupational safety and health, to develop
criteria for new safety and health standards, and to conduct
educational and training programs.10 Section 22 establishes
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH) to perform the functions of the HHS Secretary
under Sections 20 and 21.11 The OSH Act specifically
directs NIOSH to develop criteria documents that describe
safe levels of exposure to toxic materials and harmful phys￾ical agents and to forward standards for such substances that
NIOSH recommends to the Secretary.12
Section 7(a) of the OSH Act establishes a National
Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health
(NACOSH), whose basic functions are to advise and make
recommendations to the Secretary and the HHS Secre￾tary on matters relating to the administration of the OSH
Act.13 NACOSH consists of 12 members who represent the
perspectives of management, labor, the occupational safety
and health professions, and the public. Eight members are
appointed by the Secretary and four members are appointed
by the HHS Secretary.
Section 27(b) of the OSH Act also established a National
Commission on State Workmen’s Compensation Laws
(National Commission). The National Commission was
directed to study and evaluate such laws to determine
whether they provide an adequate, prompt, and equitable
system of compensation for injury or death arising out of, or
in the course of, employment.14 The National Commission’s
tasks were completed in July 1972 and it was disbanded.15
1.2 Scope of OSH Act’s Coverage
The OSH Act applies to every private employer engaged
in a business affecting commerce, regardless of the number
of employees the employer employs.16 Section 19 of the
OSH Act,17 and Executive Order 12196,18 directs the head
of each federal agency to establish and maintain an effective
and comprehensive occupational safety and health program
that is consistent with the standards required of private
employers.
The OSH Act applies “with respect to employment
performed in a workplace in any of the 50 states, the District
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American
Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,
Wake Island, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands, John￾ston Island, and the Canal Zone.”19 However, the OSH
Act’s definition of “employer” does not include states,
political subdivisions of the states, or agencies of the US
government.20 Furthermore, the OSH Act does not apply
to workers who are independent contractors. Independent
contractors lack an “employment relationship” with a firm
but have a business or entrepreneurial relationship.21 The
increasing number of workers who are considered inde￾pendent contractors in the “on-demand” or “gig” economy
narrows the coverage scope of the OSH Act (2).
2 OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
AND HEALTH STANDARDS
DEVELOPMENT
The OSH Act established processes for promulgating
three types of occupational safety and health standards: (i)
consensus standards; (ii) emergency temporary standards;
and (iii) permanent standards.
2.1 Types of Standards
2.1.1 Consensus Standards
Consensus standards are standards derived from established
federal standards22 or from national consensus standards23
that were in existence when the OSH Act became effective.
Section 6(a) of the OSH Act directed the Secretary to
publish such standards in the Federal Register immediately
after the OSH Act became effective or for a period of up
to two years. These standards became effective as OSHA
standards upon publication without regard to the notice,
public comment, and hearing requirements of the U.S.
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946.24 The intent
of the interim standards provisions was to give the Secretary
a mechanism to promulgate standards with which industry
was already familiar and to provide a nationwide floor of
minimum health and safety standards.25 The Secretary’s
two-year authority to promulgate interim standards expired
on 29 April 1973. Most OSHA standards are 6(a) standards,
and are based on scientific findings from the 1960s or earlier,
and are widely viewed as obsolete.
2.1.2 Emergency Temporary Standards
Section 6(c)(1) of OSH Act authorizes the Secretary to issue
an emergency temporary standard (ETS) if the Secretary
determines that: (i) employees are exposed to grave danger
from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic
or physically harmful or from new hazards; and (ii) such
emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from
such danger.26 An ETS may be issued without regard to
the notice, public comment, and hearing requirements of the
308OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
APA. An ETS takes effect immediately upon publication in
the Federal Register. The key to the issuance of an ETS is
the necessity to protect employees from a grave danger.27
After issuing an ETS, the Secretary must commence the
procedures for promulgation of a permanent standard, which
must issue within six months of the emergency standard’s
publication.
2.1.3 Permanent Standards
Pursuant to Section 6 of the OSH Act, the Secretary is autho￾rized to adopt permanent occupational safety and health
standards to serve the objectives of the OSH Act.28 When
setting a standard for toxic materials or harmful physical
agents, Section 6(b)(5) specifically directs the Secretary to
set a standard “which most adequately assures, to the extent
feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no
employee will suffer material impairment of health or func￾tional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure
to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his
working life.”29
2.2 Requirements for Standards Adoption
The promulgation of permanent occupational safety and
health standards is accomplished by adherence to procedures
similar to informal rulemaking under the APA.30 Upon deter￾mination that a standard should be issued, the Secretary must
first publish the proposed standard in the Federal Register.
Publication is followed by a 30-day period during which
interested persons may submit written data or comments or
file written objections and requests for a public hearing on
the proposed standard. If a hearing is requested, the Secretary
must publish in the Federal Register a notice setting a time
and place for the hearing. Within 60 days after the period for
filing comments, or, if a hearing has been timely requested,
within 60 days of the hearing, the Secretary must either issue
a rule promulgating a standard or determine that no such
rule should be issued. The APA creates a right of action
by an aggrieved person to compel unlawfully withheld or
unreasonably delayed agency action.31 Delay in meeting the
statutory timelines in Section 6 has been a pervasive feature
of OSHA rulemaking.
In the case of the field sanitation standard, where rule￾making was initiated in response to a petition filed in
1972, the D.C. Circuit first held in 1977 that the statutory
deadlines in Sections 6(b)(1) through 6(b)(4) are discre￾tionary rather than mandatory, as long as the Secretary’s
exercise of discretion was honest and fair.32 In 1986, the
D.C. Circuit decided OSHA’s delay in completing work
on the field sanitation standard represented an unreasonable
delay.33 In 1993, petitioners Public Citizen Health Research
Group and the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical & Energy
Workers International Union petitioned OSHA to update
OSHA’s exposure limit for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)).
In 1997, Public Citizen petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit to compel OSHA to complete rule￾making lowering the exposure limit to Cr(VI), but the court
concluded in 1998 that there was no unreasonable delay
and dismissed the lawsuit.34 In 2002, Public Citizen again
petitioned the court and the court granted Public Citizen’s
petition and ordered OSHA to proceed expeditiously with a
Cr(VI) standard.35
2.2.1 Significant Risk
Before OSHA promulgates a permanent occupational safety
and health standard, the agency must determine that an expo￾sure to a particular hazard could lead to material impairment
of health and that exposure to the hazard poses a significant
risk of harm which the new standard will reduce or eliminate.
Although not explicitly stated in the OSH Act, the signifi￾cant risk requirement arose from the Supreme Court’s 1980
review of OSHA’s benzene standard.36 The Court said that
Congress intended for OSHA to eliminate only of signif￾icant risks of harm. In 1991, the Eleventh Circuit struck
down OSHA’s attempt to update nearly 400 exposure limits
by adopting more recent values from the American Confer￾ence of Government Industrial Hygienists.37 The court said
OSHA had to demonstrate that each exposure limit addressed
a significant risk and was feasible to implement.38
2.2.2 Economic and Technological Feasibility
In enacting the OSH Act, Congress did not intend to make
employers strictly liable for unavoidable occupational
hazards. Accordingly, the technological and economic feasi￾bility of compliance with a standard is a factor the Secretary
must consider. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in
American Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan,
39 OSHA’s
legislative history makes clear that any standard that is
not economically or technologically feasible would not be
“reasonably necessary or appropriate” as directed by Section
3(8) of the Act.40 Thus, “Congress does not appear to have
intended to protect employees by putting their employers
out of business.”41
Economic Feasibility. In analyzing economic feasi￾bility, the Secretary has tried to determine whether a
proposed standard threatens the competitive stability of an
affected industry.42 The Supreme Court has yet to decide
whether a standard that actually does threaten the long-term
profitability and competitiveness of an industry would
be “feasible.”43 In American Textile Manufacturers, the
Supreme Court has expressly decided, however, that in
promulgating a toxic material and harmful physical agent
standard under Section 6(b)(5), the Secretary is not required
to determine that the costs of the standard bear a reasonable
309PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
relationship to its benefits. Rather, Section 6(b)(5) directs the
Secretary to issue the standard that “most adequately assures
that no employee will suffer material impairment of health,”
limited only by the extent to which this is economically and
technologically feasible, or, in other words, capable of being
done.44
The Supreme Court left open the possibility, however,
that cost-benefit analysis might be required with respect to
standards promulgated under provisions other than Section
6(b)(5) of the OSH Act.45 The Court also left open the
question of whether cost-benefit balancing by the Secre￾tary might be appropriate for deciding between issuance of
several standards regulating different varieties of health and
safety hazards.46 In 1993, OSHA provided the D.C. Circuit
a Supplementary Statement of Reasons47 as a part of the
court’s consideration of the role of cost-benefit analysis for
safety standards in UAW v. OSHA.48 In the Supplementary
Statement, OSHA rejected cost-benefit analysis for safety
standard development.
Technological Feasibility. An OSHA standard must be
technologically feasible for an employer to implement. The
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
(D.C. Circuit) has made it clear that OSHA is permitted
to impose a standard that only the most technologically
advanced plants have been able to meet in only some of their
operations only some of the time,49 and to require industry to
implement an emerging technology, i.e. one that is “looming
on today’s horizon.”50 In United Steelworkers v. Marshall,
the D.C. Circuit stated:
“OSHA must prove a reasonable possibility that the
typical firm will be able to develop and install engi￾neering and work practice controls that can meet the
PEL in most of its operations. OSHA can do so by
pointing to technology that is either already in use
or has been conceived and is reasonably capable of
experimental refinement and distribution within the
standard’s deadlines… Insufficient proof of techno￾logical feasibility for a few isolated operations within
an industry, or even OSHA’s concession that respira￾tors will be necessary in a few such operations will
not undermine this general presumption in favor of
feasibility.”51
2.2.3 Rulemaking Analysis Requirements
The provisions of the OSH Act related to rulemaking proce￾dures represent only one of a large number of mandatory
requirements put in place since 1970 by the courts, by
Congress, and by the White House Office of Management
and Budget (OMB). In addition to the requirements of the
OSH Act, OSHA must follow these additional requirements
in promulgating any new occupational safety and health
standard.
2.2.3.1 National Environmental Policy Act The
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 196952
requires all federal agencies, including OSHA, to prepare
a detailed environmental impact statement in connection
with major federal actions significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment. The Secretary has identified
the promulgation, modification, or revocation of stan￾dards that will significantly affect air, water or soil quality,
plant or animal life, and the use of land or other aspects
of the human environment as always constituting such
major action requiring the preparation of an environmental
impact statement.53 However, promulgation, modification,
or revocation of any safety standard, such as machine
guarding requirements, safety lines, or warning signals
would normally qualify for categorical exclusion from
NEPA requirements. The exclusion for such standards is
because “[s]afety standards promote injury avoidance by
means of mechanical applications of work practices, the
effects of which do not impact on air, water or soil quality,
plant or animal life, the use of land or other aspects of the
human environment.”54
2.2.3.2 Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires OSHA to
conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis when it proposes a
rule that would have significant economic impact on a large
number of small businesses, organizations, or state or local
governments.55 In 1996, Congress amended the Regulatory
Flexibility Act by means of the Small Business Regula￾tory Enforcement and Fairness Act (SBREFA).56 SBREFA
requires OSHA to appoint a special panel of small business
representatives to review all proposed rules,57 allows courts
to order OSHA to comply with any rulemaking procedure
with which they fail to comply,58 and requires that the regu￾latory flexibility analysis be a part a rulemaking.59
2.2.3.3 Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork
Reduction Act (PRA) of 198060 (substantially amended in
199561) was designed to reduce the total amount of paper￾work burden the Federal Government imposes on private
businesses and citizens and to maximize the practical utility
of the information collected. For OSHA, the PRA mandates
that OSHA engage in notice and comment rulemaking
before the agency can require any entity to report informa￾tion to it, or when it requires information to be reported to
employees, for example, labeling requirements under the
Hazard Communication Standard.62 OSHA has to show that
any request for information (RFI) is not duplicative of an
existing requirement, takes account of the difficulties that
entities will have in collecting or reporting the information,
and makes provision for the use of current information
technology to reduce the paperwork burden on the entity
who has to report, for example, by providing for electronic
310OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
reporting. The Obama Administration initiated an effort to
improve implementation of the PRA.63
2.2.3.4 Executive Orders Beginning in 1981, a number
of presidential executive orders have placed additional rule￾making responsibilities on federal agencies like OSHA.
President Reagan required that all draft rules from federal
agencies be reviewed by the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).64 In September 1993, Presi￾dent Clinton issued Executive Order 12866,65 which states
that federal agencies must assess the costs and benefits
of various regulatory approaches and should choose the
approach that maximizes the net benefits to society.66 Specif￾ically, Executive Order 12866 requires OSHA to assess the
costs and benefits of all proposed and final rules that are
“economically significant.” In January 1996, OMB issued
guidelines expanding Executive Order 12866, instructing
agencies to consider alternative strategies for regulation
and advising them to determine whether regulations should
require different results for different segments of the regu￾lated population.
On 18 January 2007, President George W. Bush issued
Executive Order 1342267 to strengthen President Clinton’s
Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 13422 requires
OMB to review significant agency guidance documents, just
as it already reviews significant agency regulations. Execu￾tive Order 13422 requires agencies: (i) to give OMB advance
notice of their upcoming significant guidance documents;
and (ii) to provide OMB with a draft of the guidance docu￾ment, an explanation of the need for the guidance, and
how it would meet that need. OMB can notify the agency
when additional consultation is required.68 Unlike Executive
Order 12866, Executive Order 13422 specifies that Execu￾tive Branch Regulatory Policy Officers in each cabinet level
department be political appointees.
On 21 January 2011, President Obama issued Executive
Order 13563,69 reaffirming the principles of Executive Order
12866, and encouraging agencies to engage the public before
issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. Executive Order
13563 also required agencies to review its existing signifi￾cant regulations periodically to determine if any should be
modified or repealed in order to make an agency’s regulatory
program more effective or less burdensome.
On 30 January 2017, President Trump issued Executive
Order 13771 in an effort to reduce regulatory burdens and to
control regulatory costs.70 Executive Order 13771 requires
that any incremental costs associated with new regulations
be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with
at least two existing regulations.
2.2.3.5 Information Quality Act A two-sentence
rider included in a 2001 appropriations bill gave birth
to what has become known as the Information Quality
Act (also called the Data Quality Act).71 The Information
Quality Act directs the OMB to issue government-wide
guidelines that “provide policy and procedural guidance to
federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality,
objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including
statistical information) disseminated by federal agencies.”
Following enactment of the Information Quality Act,
OMB issued “Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the
Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information
Disseminated by Federal Agencies.”72
Even though the text of the Information Quality Act does
not explicitly provide legal rights for any third parties, the
Salt Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce asserted
that they had the right to seek judicial review. Objecting
to guidance issued by the National Institutes of Health that
reducing sodium consumption would result in lower blood
pressure, the Salt Institute and the Chamber sued the Federal
Government. After a federal district court rejected their
claim, they appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit found that the Information Quality Act “does
not grant the rights that appellants claim were invaded.”73 No
further appeal was taken.
3 EMPLOYER DUTIES UNDER THE
OSH ACT
A private employer’s primary duties under the OSH Act are
found in Section 5(a). Each covered employer is required
to: (i) furnish to each employee employment and a place of
employment that are free from recognized hazards that are
causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm
to employees; and (ii) comply with occupational safety and
health standards promulgated under the OSH Act.74
3.1 The General Duty Clause
The general duty clause of the OSH Act – the requirement
that an employer has a duty of care even when there is no
specific standard addressing the hazard in question – has
four elements. In National Realty & Construction Co. v.
OSHRC,
75 the D.C. Circuit required that OSHA prove
that the workplace condition must present a hazard to an
employee; that the condition is recognized as a hazard; that
the hazard causes, or is likely to cause, death or serious
physical injury to the employee; and that a feasible means
exists to eliminate or materially reduce the hazard.
3.1.1 Condition or Activity Must Be a “Recognized”
Hazard
The general duty clause does not apply to all hazards, but
only to the hazards that are “recognized” by the employer
or in the employer’s industry.76 In American Smelting and
311PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
Refining Company v. OSHRC,
77 the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit held that the general duty clause not
only is limited to recognized hazards of types detectable only
by the human senses but also encompasses hazards that can
be detected by instrumentation only.
3.1.2 Hazard Must Be Causing or Likely to Cause Death
or Serious Physical Injury
It is not necessary that there be actual injury or death to
trigger a violation of the general duty clause. The purpose of
the OSH Act is to prevent accidents and injuries. Thus, viola￾tion of the general duty clause arises from the existence of
a statutory hazard, not from an injury-in-fact.78 Proof that a
hazard is “causing or likely to cause death or serious physical
harm” does not require a mathematical showing of proba￾bility. Rather, if evidence is presented that a practice could
result in serious physical harm from other than a freakish or
utterly implausible circumstances, the Review Commission’s
determination of likelihood will be accorded considerable
deference by the courts.79 Even though the term “serious
violation” is defined in the OSH Act,80 the term “serious
physical harm” is defined neither in the OSH Act nor in the
Secretary’s regulations, but rather in OSHA Field Operations
Manual (FOM).81 Very few health cases have been brought
under the General Duty Clause because the OSHRC has ruled
that OSHA must show that a significant risk exists as a result
of the hazard. In Kastalon, Inc.
82, a case involving exposure
to a carcinogen, the OSHRC vacated a general duty clause
citation because OSHA had not quantified a threshold level
of hazardous exposure as required by the Supreme Court’s
“Benzene” decision.83
3.1.3 Feasible Abatement Method
Congress did not intend to make employers strictly liable for
the presence of unsafe or unhealthful conditions on the job;
therefore, the employer’s general duty must be an achievable
one. The term “free” has been interpreted by the courts,
and the Review Commission, to mean something less than
the complete absence of hazards. Instead, the courts and
the Review Commission have held that the employer has a
duty to render the workplace free only of hazards that are
preventable.84 When technology does not exist to prevent a
hazard, OSHA does not require prevention by shutting down
the employer’s operation. Rather, the Secretary must be able
to show that “demonstrably feasible” measures would have
materially reduced the hazard.
3.2 Employer Duties Arising from
Single-Substance Health Standards
Section 5(a)(2) of the OSH Act85 imposes on employers
a duty to comply with the occupational safety and health
standards promulgated by the Secretary. Specific safety or
health standards take precedence over the general duty
clause but only with respect to hazards expressly covered by
the standard in question.86 Occupational health and safety
standards87 promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to the
OSH Act are often lengthy, encompassing hundreds of pages
in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). A comprehen￾sive analysis of these standards, many of which were adopted
in 1971 as interim standards under Section 6(b),88 is beyond
the scope of this chapter.89
Previously established federal standards were used to
set workplace exposure limits for approximately 400 chem￾ical and hazardous substances. These were referred to as
threshold limit values (TLVs) and were expressed in terms of
milligrams of substance per cubic meter of air and/or parts of
vapor or gas per million parts of air. TLVs were defined as
representing conditions under which it was believed nearly
all workers could be repeatedly exposed day after day for
their working life without experiencing any adverse health
effects.90
Amid ongoing criticism that the exposure limits set in
OSHA’s original start-up standards were out-of-date scientif￾ically, OSHA proposed on 7 June 1988 to amend and expand
the permissible exposure limits (PELs) for air contaminants
covered in the 29 CFR 1910.1000 Z-Tables.91 The rule
revised PELs for many of the approximately 400 contam￾inants that were the subject of the original standard. In
addition, the air contaminants standard established PELs for
substances not previously regulated by OSHA.92
Immediately following promulgation, the revised air
contaminants standard was challenged in court by various
labor and industry groups. In 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the standard.93 The Eleventh
Circuit ruled that OSHA had failed to establish that each
proposed PEL reduced a significant risk to worker health and
that each exposure limit was technologically and econom￾ically feasible for the affected industries. OSHA decided
not to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and
returned to its original 1971 limits.94 The Eleventh Circuit’s
decision was a major blow to OSHA’s multiple-substance
rulemaking approach, the proponents of which contended
that OSHA could not feasibly undertake rulemaking for each
regulated contaminant to the depth that the court required.
OSHA has promulgated single-substance health standards
pursuant to Section 6(b). Each permanent standard adopted
under Section 6(b) can be viewed as a “complete” standard
since each provides not only a specific value for the level
of exposure to the toxic substance but also the specifications
as to monitoring, engineering controls, personal protective
equipment (PPE), recordkeeping, medical surveillance, and
training. What follows is a short summary of the major
occupational health standards and regulations promulgated
by OSHA since 1970. The reader is cautioned to consult
the exact language of any particular standard in the C.F.R.
312OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
to determine the precise compliance duties set forth in the
particular standard of interest.
3.2.1 Acrylonitrile
Acrylonitrile is used principally as a monomer in the
manufacture of synthetic polymers, especially polyacryloni￾trile that comprises acrylic fibers. Acrylonitrile is highly
flammable and toxic and undergoes explosive polymer￾ization. In September 1978, OSHA issued a permanent
standard governing workplace exposure to acrylonitrile.95
The standard sets a PEL of 2 ppm of air over an eight-hour
period. The standard also sets a ceiling limit of 10 ppm
for any 15-minute period and an action level (AL) of
1 ppm. Exposure above the AL triggers periodic monitoring
requirements, medical surveillance, protective clothing
and equipment requirements, employee information and
training, and housekeeping. Skin or eye contact with the
substance is prohibited.
3.2.2 Asbestos
In 1971, OSHA’s first asbestos standard – derived from a
national consensus standard – established an eight hour time￾weighted average (TWA) PEL of 12 fiber/cc (fibers per cubic
centimeter). In 1972, OSHA issued an ETS and limited the
eight-hour TWA of airborne concentration of asbestos to five
fibers greater than 5 μm in length per milliliter of air (the
“5-fiber standard”),96 and then provided that the PEL would
decrease to 2 fiber/cc effective from 1 July 1976.97 The D.C.
Circuit upheld OSHA’s new asbestos standard although the
court noted that some of the questions involved in OSHA
standard setting lie “on the frontiers of scientific knowledge”
and that some of OSHA’s “policy choices” are not “suscep￾tible to the same type of verification or refutation by refer￾ence to the record” as adjudicatory decision-making.98
In 1975, OSHA initiated new rulemaking proceeding and
issued a proposed revised asbestos standard, but this proposal
was never promulgated. Then, in 1983, OSHA issued another
ETS for asbestos, this time reducing the PEL to 0.5 fiber/cc.99
However, OSHA failed to convince the Fifth Circuit that
workers faced a grave danger during the six-month lifespan
of an ETS.100 In 1986, OSHA issued a revised asbestos
rule.101 The revised rule consisted of two simultaneously
issued asbestos standards, one for general industry and the
other for construction.102 The new rules covered asbestos and
nonasbestiform tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite103
and reduced the eight-hour TWA from 2 fiber/cc of air to
0.2 fiber/cc of air.
The revised standards were challenged by the Asbestos
Information Association of North America (AIA) and by the
Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of
the AFL-CIO. The unions challenged OSHA’s refusal to set
a lower eight-hour TWA of 0.1 fiber/cc of air. OSHA claimed
it promulgated the higher limit because the lower limit was
not feasible in the entire industry, and OSHA had discretion
to decide what industries should be grouped together for
regulatory purposes. The D.C. Circuit disagreed and held that
if OSHA was concerned with the administrative problems
involved in desegregating industrial sectors for purposes
of the TWA, it must make specific findings on the issue.
Therefore, the D.C. Circuit remanded to OSHA on this issue,
as well as on whether a short-term exposure limit (STEL)
should be established.104 In 1988, OSHA established an
asbestos STEL of 1 fiber/cc of air over a 30 minute sampling
period.105 OSHA decided that the eight-hour TWA issue
would require additional rulemaking, and the D.C. Circuit
approved the OSHA decision.
In August 1994, OSHA published a final rule lowering
the PEL for all three forms of asbestos – tremolite, antho￾phyllite, and actinolite – fibers to 0.1 fiber/cc of air.106
The standard also required building owners to disclose the
presence of asbestos in their buildings and enacted a new
protective scheme requiring stricter controls for operations
deemed to be more hazardous including provisions requiring
building owners to inform employers of workers who may
be exposed to materials within their facility presumed to
contain asbestos. In addition, negative-pressure enclosures
were required for workers removing “high-risk” asbestos￾containing materials. The new rule affected general industry,
the construction industry, and the shipyard industry.107
Eighteen different legal challenges to the 1994 standard,
and to revisions to the standard that were published in 1995
and 1996, were filed by various industry and labor groups,
and the cases were consolidated in the Fifth Circuit. OSHA
then set about settling these challenges with the various
parties. In January 1995, OSHA settled with the National
Brake Care Coalition, allowing the use of chemical solvent
sprays to clean asbestos-lined brake and clutch assemblies. In
March 1995, several roofing contractors and the Safe Build￾ings Alliance settled their challenges when OSHA agreed to
amend the rule to allow employers to rely on information
submitted by the roofers’ association concerning negative
exposure assessment and to allow alternative methods of
compliance for installation, removal, repair and maintenance
of certain roofing materials.
In settling with the AFL-CIO, OSHA agreed (among
other things) to make certain modifications to the training
programs prescribed for construction and shipyard workers.
OSHA also agreed to require construction and shipyard
employers to notify employees who are required to wear
respirators under the rule that they may require their
employer to provide a powered, air-purifying respirator
instead of a negative-pressure one and to require that
warnings about exposure be communicated to workers
in an effective manner.108 OSHA settled with the Amer￾ican Iron and Steel Institute by allowing (among other
items) a “competent person” simply being “available,” not
313PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
necessarily at the worksite itself, for consultation while
Class II, III, or IV work is being performed under 29 C.F.R.
§ 1926.1101. OSHA also allowed negative exposure assess￾ments may be made by a competent person based on
“professional judgment.” All the other challenges to the
final asbestos rule were withdrawn, except for one.
In July 1997, in response to a challenge by the AIA, the
Fifth Circuit vacated the construction and shipyard standards
on asbestos-containing asphalt roof coatings and sealants,
stating that the standards were not supported by substantial
evidence.109 Specifically, the court held that OSHA had not
made a critical distinction between built-up roofing, which
the court said “poses real risks of exposure,” and roofing
sealants, which the Secretary had not seriously argued posed
a significant risk of asbestos exposure. OSHA published revi￾sions to the rule to conform to the Fifth Circuit decision110
and the litigation over the asbestos standard was concluded.
3.2.3 Benzene
In 1971, OSHA adopted an eight-hour PEL for benzene
of 10 ppm based on a consensus standard adopted by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for nonma￾lignant health effects. In 1978, OSHA issued a new standard
based on accumulating epidemiologic evidence that benzene
caused leukemia, and set the PEL to the lowest feasible level
industry could achieve, that is, 1 ppm.111 The 1 ppm standard
was first invalidated by the Fifth Circuit. On appeal, the U.S.
Supreme Court affirmed, finding that OSHA had failed to
show that exposure above the 1 ppm limit presented a “signif￾icant risk of material health impairment” to workers.112 The
court said that a standard, to be “reasonably necessary and
appropriate” within the meaning of Section 3(8) of the OSH
Act, had to materially reduce a “significant” risk to workers
and that required OSHA to make a determination that risk at
the current levels would be eliminated at the level in the new
standard.113
In 1985, OSHA again proposed to reduce the PEL
from 10 to 1 ppm.114 In 1987, OSHA issued a revised
benzene standard.115 The revised standard sets the eight￾hour TWA for benzene at 1 ppm, and the STEL at 5 ppm for
a 15 minute sampling period.116 Under the revised standards,
the employer must provide a medical surveillance program
to monitor the health of employees exposed to benzene in
amounts over the AL of 0.5 ppm for more than 30 days per
year. In addition, OSHA requires a medical removal plan for
temporary and permanent removal of employees showing
adverse health effects from benzene exposure. The employer
is required to provide six months of medical removal protec￾tion benefits to a removed employee, unless the employee
has been transferred to a comparable job with benzene
exposure below the AL.117 Union and industry petitions for
judicial review of the new standard were withdrawn from
the Third and D.C. Circuit Courts of Appeal in November
1987, shortly before the effective date of the new benzene
standard.
3.2.4 Beryllium
The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was the first federal
agency to develop an exposure limit for beryllium. In 1949,
the AEC adopted an exposure limit of 2 μg m−3 for all work￾places under its jurisdiction. In 1971, OSHA adopted 425
PELs for air contaminants, including a beryllium exposure
limit of 2 μg m−3.
118 In 1975, OSHA proposed a beryllium
standard for all industries based on studies showing that
beryllium caused cancer in animals,119 but the rulemaking
was never completed.
In 1999 and 2001, the Paper Allied-Industrial, Chemical,
and Energy Workers Union, Public Citizen Health Research
Group and others petitioned OSHA to issue an ETS on
beryllium. OSHA denied the petitions for an ETS. In 2002,
OSHA published a request for information (RFI).120 The RFI
solicited information pertinent to occupational exposure to
beryllium including (i) current exposures to beryllium; (ii)
the relationship between exposure to beryllium and the devel￾opment of adverse health effects; (iii) exposure assessment
and monitoring methods; exposure control methods; and (iv)
medical surveillance.
In 2015, OSHA published a notice of proposed
rulemaking.121 In 2017, OSHA published its final rule,
Occupational Exposure to Beryllium and Beryllium
Compounds.
122 OSHA concluded that the new PEL of
0.2 μg m−3 reduced the significant risk that beryllium posed
to health to the maximum extent that is technologically
and economically feasible.123 On 21 March 2017, OSHA
published a delay of the effective data for the final beryllium
rule to 20 May 2017124 to be in conformance to the 20
January 2017 Presidential directive for agencies to consider
further delaying the effective date for regulations across all
federal agencies beyond the initial 60-day period.125
In the final rule, OSHA issued three separate stan￾dards – for general industry, for shipyards, and for
construction. Concerns were raised by the construction
and shipyard sectors about ancillary procedures such as
housekeeping and PPE that were required in the final rule
relating to abrasive blasting. OSHA proposed to revoke the
ancillary provisions applicable to construction and ship￾yards, but retain the new lower PEL of 0.2 μg m−3 and the
STEL of 2.0 μg m−3 for these sectors.126
3.2.5 1,3-Butadiene
Butadiene is a flammable and carcinogenic chemical used
in the production of synthetic rubber. In October 1985, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Toxic
Substances Control Act (TSCA),127 referred 1,3-butadiene
to OSHA for regulatory action. In 1986, OSHA issued an
314OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking128 and a proposed
standard in 1990.129 In November 1996, after a negotiated
rulemaking process130 involving OSHA, the United Steel￾workers of America, the International Chemical Workers
Union, the Institute of Synthetic Rubber Products, and the
Olefins Panel of the Chemical Manufacturers Association,
a final rule for exposure to 1,3-butadiene was published.131
The standard called for reduction in the PEL from 1000 to
1 ppm over an eight-hour period and for a STEL of 5 ppm.
If exposures reach 0.5 ppm, additional engineering controls
are to be implemented. The rule also covers medical surveil￾lance, exposure monitoring, and other issues.
3.2.6 Cadmium
Cadmium is a heavy metal that has been linked to lung
cancer and kidney disease. However, when OSHA first
adopted a 100 μg m−3 eight-hour PEL for cadmium fume,
and 200 μg m−3 for cadmium, it based those levels on noncar￾cinogenic health effects such as gastritis and anemia.132
In 1986, the International Chemical Workers Union, after
OSHA rebuffed their request for an ETS, sued to compel
OSHA to issue an ETS, but lost again.133 The plaintiffs
returned to court in 1989 because in the intervening time
OSHA had not issued a proposed standard for cadmium.
In February 1990, OSHA did finally publish a proposed
standard.134 OSHA asked the court for an extension of six
months on the 1992 date for a final standard. The court set
an August 31 deadline saying that OSHA’s procrastination
“has been too lengthy for us to temporize any longer.”135
OSHA issued its final rule for cadmium exposure on
14 September 1992.136 The rule set an eight-hour PEL of
5 μg m−3 of air – to be achieved primarily by engineering
controls – and an AL of 2.5 μg m−3. For operations in certain
industries, OSHA found that the PEL could be feasibly be
achieved through engineering and work practice controls and
established a “separate engineering control airborne limit”
(SECAL) of 50 and 15 μg m−3 depending on the industry and
operation at issue.137
After promulgation, nine different lawsuits challenging
the standard were filed by various manufacturers and
industry groups. By June 1993, OSHA had settled all
but one of these challenges by addressing what specific
measures the individual manufacturers needed to take to
comply with the standard. In the remaining challenge by
the Color Pigments Manufacturers Association (CPMA),
who represented dry color formulators, CPMA argued that
cadmium compounds used as pigments and paints should not
have been given the same PEL as other cadmium compounds
because they were less soluble. The court rejected CPMA’s
argument and held that the rulemaking record justified
including cadmium pigments into the standard.138 The court
then found that OSHA lacked evidence about current expo￾sures in the dry color formulator industry and remanded to
OSHA to restudy the technological and economic feasibility
of the final cadmium standard for dry color formulators.139
3.2.7 Cotton Dust
Exposure to cotton dust can cause byssinosis, a pneumoco￾niosis also known as “brown lung.” In 1971, OSHA adopted
an eight-hour PEL of total cotton dust of 1000 μg m−3 that
had been issued under the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts
Act. In June 1978, OSHA promulgated a new cotton dust
standard that sets different PELs for yarn manufacturing,
(200 μg m−3) slashing and weaving (750 μg m−3) and for all
other processes (500 μg m−3).140
The cotton dust standard was challenged by the textile
manufacturers on the grounds (among others) that OSHA had
not adequately assessed the risk of exposure on the health
of workers,141 but the Supreme Court rejected that argument
saying “[I]t is difficult to imagine what else the agency could
do to comply with this Court’s decision in [Benzene].”142
The standard was also challenged as violating Section 3(8) of
the OSH Act, which required that a standard be “reasonably
necessary or appropriate …”, but OSHA pointed to Section
6(b)(5) “to the extent feasible” requirement as controlling.
The Court agreed with OSHA stating that feasible means
“capable of being done.”143 The Court also rejected the
manufacturers’ contention that OSHA should have done a
cost-benefit analysis, by stating “cost-benefit analysis is not
required by the statute because feasibility analysis is.”144
In 1978, OSHA also issued a companion standard regu￾lating cotton dust in the cotton ginning industry requiring
medical surveillance, work practices and respirator use,
warning signs and training.145 The standard was vacated by
the Fifth Circuit because OSHA had not proved a significant
risk of harm from exposure.146
3.2.8 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane
In March of 1978, OSHA promulgated a permanent standard
regarding 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a pesticide
compound used extensively in the 1970s, but later found to
cause male sterility.147 The DBCP standard, which became
effective from 17 April 1978, sets a PEL of 1 ppb (part
per billion) of air over an eight-hour period. Where engi￾neering controls and work practices are not sufficient to
reduce exposure to permissible limits, respirators may be
used as a supplement in order to achieve the required protec￾tion. Protective clothing is required where eye or skin contact
may occur. The standard does not apply to the use of DBCP
as a pesticide, or when it is stored, transported, or distributed
in sealed containers.
3.2.9 Ethylene Oxide
Ethylene oxide (EtO) has been manufactured in the United
States since 1925 and is an important industrial chemical
315PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
used as an intermediate in the production of ethylene glycol
and other chemicals, and as a sterilant for foods and medical
supplies. It is a colorless, flammable gas or refrigerated liquid
with a faintly sweet odor.
In 1971, OSHA adopted a standard for ethylene oxide,
and in 1981 was petitioned to issue an ETS, but denied the
petition and was sued. OSHA issued a final rule for ethylene
oxide on 22 June 1984 and established an eight-hour TWA
of 1 ppm, but deferred setting a STEL.148 Several months
later, OSHA concluded that a STEL was not warranted
based on available health data. This decision was chal￾lenged in court, and the D.C. Circuit, while upholding
the validity of the eight-hour TWA of 1 ppm, ruled that
OSHA’s decision regarding the STEL should be remanded
for further consideration.149 OSHA hesitated and received a
reprimand from the D.C. Circuit. The court stated, “enough
is enough,” and warned OSHA that it was “treading at the
very lip of the abyss of unreasonable delay.”150 Finally,
in 1988, OSHA set an ethylene oxide STEL of 5 ppm
for a 15 minute period.151 The ethylene oxide standard
requires the use of engineering and work practice controls,
when feasible, as well as medical surveillance, protec￾tive clothing and equipment, and employee training and
warnings.152
3.2.10 Formaldehyde
Formaldehyde is a common building block for the synthesis
for more complex compounds and materials. Most formalde￾hyde is used in the production of polymers and other chem￾icals. OSHA set its original standard for formaldehyde in
1971 at an eight-hour TWA of 3 ppm, a maximum peak for
30 minutes of 10 ppm and a ceiling limit of 5 ppm for any
10-minute period.
OSHA was asked to lower the PEL for formaldehyde in
1981 but declined to issue an ETS. The United Auto Workers
sued OSHA and a federal district court found OSHA’s failure
to issue a standard to be arbitrary and capricious and ordered
OSHA to reconsider its decision.153 On appeal, the D.C.
Circuit threatened to hold OSHA in contempt if it did not
issue a standard.154 OSHA did issue an updated formalde￾hyde standard in 1987, and lowered the PEL to an eight-hour
TWA of 1 ppm, revoked the peak limit and set a STEL of
2 ppm.155
In 1992, the formaldehyde standard was significantly
revised, among other things, to lower the existing PEL from
1 to 0.75 ppm for the eight-hour TWA.156 The revisions
were prompted by a decision of the D.C. Circuit to remand
the 1987 standard for OSHA’s reconsideration of several
issues.157 The standard, as amended, added medical removal
protection (MRP) provisions for workers suffering from
specific conditions that supplement its medical surveil￾lance requirements. The revised standard also requires
specific hazard labeling and annual employee training.
The amendments became effective from various dates in
1992.
3.2.11 Hexavalent Chromium
Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a carcinogenic chem￾ical used in the plating and welding operations, dyes and
pigments, leather tanning, and wood preserving. The most
common oxidation states of chromium are +2, +3, and
+6, with +3 being the most stable. Oxidation states +1,
+4, and +5 are rare. Chromium compounds of oxida￾tion state +6 are powerful oxidants. An investigation into
hexavalent chromium release into groundwater supplies of
drinking water formed the plot of the motion picture Erin
Brockovich.
In 1993, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union
petitioned OSHA to adopt a more stringent standard for
hexavalent chromium based on the risk of cancer for exposed
workers.158 Many years went by without action by OSHA.
In 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in
response to a petition from Public Citizen Health Research
Group, ordered OSHA to promulgate a standard.159
In 2006, OSHA published a final rule for exposure to
hexavalent chromium and established a PEL of 5 μg m−3.
160
The standard also covers medical surveillance, exposure
monitoring, respirators, training, recordkeeping, and other
issues. In 2009, after several challenges were filed, a three￾judge panel of the Third Circuit (including retired U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor) upheld the
PEL of 5 μg m−3 and all other aspects of the standard,
but required OSHA to provide a fuller explanation for its
employer exposure notification requirements (which OSHA
limited to just those exposures which exceeded the PEL).161
In 2010, OSHA decided to revise its notification require￾ments to require employers to notify employees of the results
of all exposure determinations.162
3.2.12 Inorganic Arsenic
In May 1978, OSHA issued a permanent standard for
inorganic arsenic.163 The standard established an eight￾hour TWA PEL of 10 μg m−3, and also specified various
other requirements such as engineering and work practice
controls, respiratory protection, and employee monitoring
and training. The standard was challenged by industry,164
and it was remanded to OSHA by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration in light of the
Supreme Court’s decision invalidating the benzene standard
in Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute.
165
In 1983, OSHA published a final risk assessment indicating
that the 10 μg limit reduced the risk of lung cancer by about
98% from the previous TLV of 500 μg and that such a
reduction satisfies the U.S. Supreme Court’s “significant
risk” test.166 The Ninth Circuit later upheld the standard
316OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
as supported by substantial evidence of a significant health
risk.167 The standard applies to all occupational exposures to
inorganic arsenic, except employee exposures in agriculture
or industries involving pesticide application, the treatment
of wood with preservatives, or the use of wood preserved
with arsenic.
3.2.13 Lead
In 1971, OSHA adopted a national consensus standard of an
eight-hour PEL of 200 μg m−3 of lead. In 1975, OSHA issued
a proposed standard that contained an eight-hour PEL of
100 μg m−3 and provisions for monitoring, training, medical
surveillance, and MRP.168
In November 1978, OSHA issued a permanent standard
regulating occupational exposure to lead.169 The final stan￾dard set an eight-hour PEL of 50 μg m−3 of air – one-half
of what OSHA had proposed. The standard required, among
other things, the use of respirators and protective work
clothing and equipment whenever lead exposure exceeds the
PEL, compliance with vigorous rules on housekeeping and
hygiene, biological monitoring, and medical surveillance.
The standard also required a controversial MRP provision
pursuant to which certain workers must be removed from
the exposed workplace without loss of earnings, benefits, or
seniority for at least 18 months. The standard further required
employers to create safety and health training programs
for their workers exposed to lead; to keep detailed records
on environmental (workplace) monitoring, biological moni￾toring, and medical surveillance; and to make those records
available to workers, certain of their representatives, and the
government.
The lead standard was challenged by the industry and by
labor and the D.C. Circuit stayed compliance with the PEL.
The D.C. Circuit rejected most challenges and upheld the
standard (including the PEL and MRP provisions) as to 10
industries, including primary and secondary lead smelting
and battery manufacturing.170 However, with respect to 39
other industries, the court held that OSHA failed to present
substantial evidence or adequate reasons to support the
feasibility of the standard for those industries and thus
remanded to the Secretary for reconsideration of the techno￾logical and economic feasibility of the standard as to those
industries.171
OSHA subsequently amended the standard to require
employers that cannot reach the PEL to reduce exposure only
to the lowest feasible level. OSHA also found that the stan￾dard of 50 μg m−3 of air was technologically and econom￾ically feasible for all but nine of the remand industries.172
OSHA continued to gather information as to these nine
industry sectors, and on 11 July 1989, OSHA issued a state￾ment of reasons as to why the 50 μg standard was feasible
through engineering controls for eight of the remaining
nine sectors.173 For the ninth industry sector, nonferrous
foundries, OSHA found the 50 μg standard was technologi￾cally, but not economically, feasible for small foundries, and
therefore promulgated a bifurcated standard for large and
small nonferrous foundries.174
In March 1990, the D.C. Circuit upheld the standard with
respect to all but six industries,175 and finally, on 19 July
1991, the court lifted its existing stay of the standard’s engi￾neering and work practice control requirements with respect
to all of those six industries, except the brass and bronze ingot
manufacturing industry.176 In a notice published in October
1995, OSHA set the final lead standard for brass and bronze
ingot manufacturers at an eight-hour TWA of 75 μg m−3 of
air, reflecting an agreement reached between the agency and
the two trade associations that finally settled all litigation
arising out of the 1978 standard. These employers had six
years to meet the 75 μg limit.177
In May 1993, in response to the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992,178 OSHA published an interim
final rule intended to protect construction workers who
are exposed to lead on the job. The interim rule reduced
the PEL for lead in construction from an eight-hour TWA
of 200 μg m−3 of air to 50 μg, and it established a 30 μg
threshold beyond which exposed workers are to be provided
additional protections, including medical surveillance. The
interim rule is to remain in effect until OSHA promulgates a
final rule on the subject.179
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has published
a final rule setting national training, certification, and
accreditation standards for people conducting lead-based
paint inspections, risk assessments, and abatement in certain
houses and child-occupied facilities. The rule, which EPA
was required to develop under Sections 402 and 404 of the
Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, includes a model
state program by which states can seek permission from EPA
to administer their own training, certification, and abate￾ment programs. The agency omitted, however, controversial
provisions that had targeted lead-based paint activities in
commercial and public buildings.180
In 2016, OSHA announced in its Spring Regulatory
Agenda that it would start pre-rule activities to consider the
blood lead level (BLL) for medical removal.181 OSHA stated
“the lead standards for general industry and construction are
based on lead toxicity information that is over 35 years old.
OSHA lead standards allow for the return of the employee to
former job status at a BLL<40 μg dL−1. The U.S. Depart￾ment of Health and Human Services, Council of State
and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and California’s
Medical Management recommends that BLLs among all
adults be reduced to<10 μg dL−1.” OSHA planned to publish
an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking later in 2016
to seek input from the public to identify possible areas of the
lead standards for revision to improve protection of workers
in industries and occupations where preventable exposure to
lead continues to occur.
317PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
3.2.14 Methylene Chloride
Methylene chloride, or dichloromethane, is a colorless,
volatile liquid with a moderately sweet aroma. It is widely
used as a solvent, the general view being that it is one of the
less harmful of the chlorocarbons, and it is miscible with
most organic solvents.
In 1971, OSHA adopted the Walsh–Healey Act eight￾hour TWA PEL of 500 ppm, a ceiling limit of 1000 ppm and
a maximum peak above the ceiling or 2000 ppm for three
minutes in a two-hour period. In 1985, evidence began to
emerge that methylene chloride was linked to an increased
risk of cancer, heart attack, and nerve damage. The United
Auto Workers petitioned for an ETS, but OSHA denied the
petition.182 In 1992, OSHA proposed to reduce the eight￾hour TWA PEL to 25 ppm (with an AL of 12.5 ppm) and to
establish a STEL of 125 ppm averaged over 15 minutes.183
On 10 January 1997, a final OSHA standard for expo￾sure to methylene chloride was published after considerable
debate about the cancer risk posed by methylene chloride.184
The final rule was to be phased in over 3 years. Other
than the reduction of the PEL to 25 ppm, other provisions
required employers to provide training, medical surveil￾lance, and exposure monitoring. On 22 September 1998,
OSHA amended its methylene chloride standard by adding a
provision for temporary MRP benefits for employees who
are removed or transferred to another job because of a
medical determination that exposure to methylene chloride
may contribute to the worker’s existing skin, heart, liver, or
neurological disease.185
The final rule on methylene chloride was challenged by
the United Auto Workers (UAW), Eastman Kodak, and the
Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance (HSIA) and several
individual companies. All cases were consolidated in the
D.C. Circuit.186 The trade association’s suit sought review of
the standard under the Small Business Regulatory Enforce￾ment Fairness Act of 1996.187 The UAW and the HSIA
came to agreement with OSHA on the issues in dispute188
and OSHA sought public comment on their Motion for
Reconsideration.189 In response to these challenges, OSHA
revised its final rule to extend dates for certain employers to
come into compliance with engineering controls and respira￾tory protection and to provide MRP.190
OSHA also faced opposition over the standard from
the American College of Occupational and Environmental
Medicine (ACOEM). The physicians’ group sought a
reopening of the methylene chloride rulemaking, arguing
that allowing required medical surveillance to be conducted
by health care professionals other than licensed doctors was
a “radical departure” from other OSHA standards and put
employees at risk of incorrect diagnosis and treatment, but
OSHA denied ACOEM’s petition.
In 2007, OSHA announced a review of the Methylene
Chloride Standard191 in accordance with the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Section 5 of Executive
Order 12866.192 The review considers the continued need for
the rule; whether the rule overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts
with other federal, state, or local regulations; and the degree
to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors
may have changed since the rule was evaluated.
3.2.15 Methylenedianiline
In 1985, EPA prompted OSHA to examine what regula￾tory action OSHA should take to protect employees from
methylenedianiline.193 OSHA impaneled a negotiated
rulemaking advisory committee to develop a perma￾nent standard194 and the committee’s recommendations,
covering general industry and construction, were published
in 1987.195 In 1989, OSHA proposed a methylenediani￾line rule196 and adopted a final rule in 1992.197 No legal
challenges to the final rule were filed.
3.2.16 Noise
In science and engineering, noise is an undesirable compo￾nent that obscures a desired signal. For occupational health,
noise is unwanted, and potentially harmful, sound. Sound is
generally known as the vibrational transmission of mechan￾ical energy that propagates through matter as a wave that
is audibly perceived by living organisms by the sense of
hearing. For humans, hearing is limited to frequencies
between about 20 Hz (Hertz) and 20 kHz, with the upper
limit generally decreasing with age. Since the human ear
does not have a flat spectral response, sound pressure levels
are often “frequency weighted” so that the measured level
will match perceived levels more closely. The International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has defined several
weighting schemes. A-weighting attempts to match the
response of the human ear to noise and A-weighted sound
pressure levels are labeled dBA. C-weighting is used to
measure peak levels.
OSHA’s standard for occupational exposure to noise
specifies a maximum eight-hour TWA PEL of 90 dB (deci￾bels on the A-weighted scale).198 Employers are required
to use feasible engineering or administrative controls, or
a combination of both, whenever employee exposure to
noise in the workplace exceeds the PEL. PPE may be used
to supplement the engineering and administrative controls
where such controls are not able to reduce the employee
exposure to within the permissible limit.
In 1983, OSHA issued a final hearing conservation
amendment to the noise standard.199 Under the amend￾ment, the employer must establish a baseline audiometric
measurement from which it must compare subsequent
annual measurements to determine if a shift in hearing
capability has occurred for any employees whose expo￾sures equal or exceed an eight-hour TWA of 85 dBA.200
318OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
To determine if the exposure equals, or exceeds this AL,
employers are required to use personal sampling of noise
where factors, such as high worker mobility or significant
variation in sound levels, make area monitoring generally
inappropriate.201 The employer must make hearing protec￾tors available to all employees whose exposure equals or
exceeds an eight-hour TWA of 85 dBA and must ensure
that hearing protectors are worn by any employee who has
experienced a shift in hearing capability.202 The U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the amendment.203
In 1987, OSHA sought public comments as to what extent
the information collection requirements of the noise stan￾dard could be reduced without lessening the standard’s effec￾tiveness in preventing hearing loss. OSHA later announced,
however, that no such changes would be made.204 On 1
July 2002, OSHA issued a final rule revising the criteria for
recording hearing loss cases in several ways. In the final rule,
OSHA required the recording of Standard Threshold Shifts
(10 dB shifts in hearing acuity) that have resulted in a total
25 dB level of hearing above audiometric zero, averaged over
the frequencies at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz, beginning in the
year 2003.205
3.2.17 Respirable Crystalline Silica
The historical OSHA PEL for general industry is based
on a formula recommended by the American Conference
of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (“ACGIH”), first in
a “Notice of Intended Change” in 1968, and then finally
adopted in 1972.206 The historical PEL for construction and
maritime, which was derived from ACGIH’s 1962 TLV, was
based on particle counting technology, which is now consid￾ered obsolete. NIOSH reviewed silica hazards in 2002 and
recommended an exposure limit of 0.05 mg m−3 to reduce the
risk of developing silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse
health effects.207
In 2006, the ACGIH revised their TLV, adopting an expo￾sure limit of 0.025 mg m−3 for respirable crystalline silica.
Both industry and worker groups have recognized that a new
comprehensive standard for crystalline silica was needed
to provide for exposure monitoring, medical surveillance,
and worker training. The legal basis for developing such a
proposed rule is a preliminary determination that workers are
exposed to a significant risk of silicosis and other serious
disease and that rulemaking is needed to reduce the risk.
A standard for occupational exposure to crystalline silica
appeared at the top of OSHA’s Regulatory Agenda for many
years.
On 12 September 2013, OSHA published a proposed rule,
Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica,
208
and published a final rule on 25 March 2016.209 OSHA
issued two separate standards – one for general industry
and maritime, and one for construction. The final estab￾lishes a new eight-hour TWA PEL of 50 μg m−3, and an
AL of 25 μg m−3 in all industries covered by the rule.
It includes other provisions to protect employees such as
requirements for exposure assessment, detailed methods for
controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveil￾lance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. On 19
October 2017, OSHA issued guidance for enforcing 29
C.F.R. Section 1926.1153, Respirable Crystalline Silica.
210
OSHA’s Respirable Crystalline Silica final rule was
legally challenged by industry and labor. The court rejected
all five of industry’s challenges.211 The North American
Building Trades Union petitioned for review of two parts of
the final rule: (i) the requirement that medical surveillance
for construction workers be provided only if the employee
has to wear a respirator for 30 days for one employer in
a one-year period; and (ii) the absence of MRPs from the
final rule. The court ruled that OSHA has failed to explain
adequately its decision to omit MRPs from the rule and
remanded that issue for further consideration by OSHA.212
3.2.18 Vinyl Chloride
Vinyl chloride is used to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
PVC is used to make a variety of plastic products, including
pipes, wire and cable coatings, and packaging materials.
A link between vinyl chloride exposure and angiosarcoma
of the liver in rubber industry workers was published in
the early 1970s (3). On 5 April 1974, OSHA promulgated
an emergency standard for vinyl chloride and a permanent
standard on 1 October 1974 that was shown great deference
by the Second Circuit when it was challenged.213 The rule
set an eight-hour TWA PEL for vinyl chloride at 1 ppm.214
Generally, the standard requires feasible engineering
and work practice controls to reduce exposure below
the permissible level wherever possible. Specifically, the
employer is required to provide respiratory protection and
protective garments for employees.215 The employer must
provide, for each employee engaged in vinyl chloride oper￾ation, a training program “relating to the hazards of vinyl
chloride and precautions for its safe use.”216 Entrances to
regulated areas must be posted with signs warning of the
cancer-suspect nature of vinyl chloride.217 Moreover, the
employer must institute a program of medical surveillance
for each employee exposed to vinyl chloride in excess of
the AL, without regard for use of respirators.218 Finally,
the employer must maintain accurate medical records to
measure employee exposure to vinyl chloride.219
3.3 Employer Duties Arising from Generic
Health Standards
3.3.1 Bloodborne Pathogens
In 1991, OSHA promulgated a standard aimed at control￾ling occupational exposure to infectious agents that can be
319PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
transmitted through contact with blood or other potentially
infectious materials, that is, “bloodborne pathogens,” such as
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis
B virus (HBV).220 Application of the standard is triggered
by an employee’s reasonably anticipated contact with blood
or other potentially infectious materials (defined by a list of
specific body tissues and fluids). Affected employers must
develop written exposure control plans that identify exposed
employees and tailor the standard’s work practices and engi￾neering controls to the particular work environment. Central
to the standard is the mandatory use of “universal precau￾tions,” a practice by which all blood and other potentially
infectious materials are handled as if they are contami￾nated with bloodborne pathogens.221 The standard has strin￾gent requirements regarding the disposal of wastes and used
needles, the use of PPE, employee training, and labels and
warnings. Employers must offer exposed employees the
HBV vaccine free of charge, and must also provide free
post-exposure medical evaluation and testing. In addition,
extensive recordkeeping, including documented follow-up of
exposure incidents, is mandated by the standard. The stan￾dard is aimed at protecting over 5 million workers, many of
whom are outside the health care industry.
The bloodborne pathogens standard was challenged by
several health care industry groups, but the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the standard in
January 1993.222 However, the court did agree with Home
Health Services and Staffing Association, Inc. that OSHA
needed to explain better the compliance obligations of home
health care employers who do not control their worksites, and
the court remanded the rule to the agency for clarification of
its application to those employers.223
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Seventh
Circuit’s ruling, thus ending the challenge by the Amer￾ican Dental Association (ADA). The ADA had argued that
dentists and their employees generally were exposed less
to blood than other health care providers and that the stan￾dard – by its use of the term “ensure” when referring to
employer’s obligation to ensure worker compliance – was
imposing a form of strict liability. The court disagreed with
the ADA and said that the employer was required to only take
“all reasonable steps to prevent his employees from violating
the rule but if despite these measures the employee violates
the rule, the employer is off the hook.”224
3.3.2 Carcinogens
OSHA excluded the ACGIH’ list of carcinogenic chemi￾cals from its 1971 interim standards promulgation package.
After approximately 1 year of consulting with NIOSH and
receiving data and commentary from interested groups,
the Secretary promulgated ETSs on 3 May 1973 for a
list of 14 chemicals found to be carcinogenic. Permanent
standards for the 14 carcinogens225 were issued on 29
January 1974.226 In Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufac￾turers Ass’n v. Brennan,
227 the Third Circuit upheld all the
carcinogens standards except one. The standard for 4,4’-
methylene bis(2-chloraniline) (MOCA) was subsequently
revoked by OSHA.228
In January 1980, OSHA promulgated a generic
carcinogen policy for identifying, classifying, and regu￾lating workplace carcinogens.229 The policy includes a
process for screening chemicals and establishing priorities
for rulemaking. It places substances in two categories:
potential carcinogenicity and suggestive potential. Model
permanent and ETSs are included. Lists of carcinogen
candidates were to be published by OSHA periodically
pursuant to the policy, but the listing requirements have been
administratively stayed since 1983.230
3.3.3 Coke Oven Emissions
In October 1976, the Secretary issued a permanent stan￾dard regulating workers’ exposure to coke oven emissions.
The standard defines coke oven emissions as the benzene￾soluble fraction of total particulate matter present during the
destructive distillation of coal for the production of coke. It
limits exposure to 150 μg of benzene-soluble fraction of total
particulate matter per cubic meter of air averaged over an
eight-hour period.231
The standard mandates specific engineering controls and
work practices that were to be in use by 20 January 1980.
For example, the employer is required to provide protec￾tive clothing and equipment,232 hygienic changing rooms,233
and lunchrooms with a filtered air supply.234 The employer
must ensure that in the regulated area food and beverages
are not consumed, smoking is prohibited, and cosmetics
are not applied.235 The employer must provide training to
employees regarding the dangers of the regulated area.236
In addition, the employer must post precautionary signs and
labels.237 The employer must institute a medical surveillance
program for all those employed in the regulated area at least
30 days per year.238 The employer also must maintain accu￾rate medical records to measure employee exposure to coke
oven emissions.239 The steel industry challenged the validity
of the coke oven standard, but it was upheld by the Third
Circuit in American Iron and Steel Institute v. OSHA.
240
3.3.4 Hazard Communication
In an attempt to address multiple chemical hazards at
one time, OSHA issued a hazard communication standard
in November 1983.241 The standard required manufac￾turers to establish a method to communicate the hazards
of chemicals to those who worked with them, mainly
through the use of labels on containers, materials safety
data sheets (later revised to safety data sheets or SDSs),
and training programs.242 The Third Circuit generally
320OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
upheld the standard but remanded it to OSHA on several
issues, including whether the scope of the standard should
be expanded beyond the manufacturing sector.243 OSHA
reopened the record to consider the scope issue, but the
agency was reprimanded by the court for doing so and got
a 60-day deadline to answer the court’s remand order.244
On 24 August 1987, OSHA expanded the scope of the stan￾dard to encompass nonmanufacturing employment.245 The
Third Circuit denied subsequent petitions for review of the
expanded standard.246 The Hazard Communication Standard
now applies to all industries, but before the standard’s scope
was finalized, OMB took exception to the requirement that
SDSs be exchanged at multiemployer worksites based on
the authority granted to them by the PRA. OMB’s authority
to interfere in the OSHA standard was challenged in court
and the Third Circuit upheld the challenge.247 The Supreme
Court affirmed,248 but Congress nullified the Court’s holding
when it amended the PRA in 1995.249
In 1994, while litigation was occurring, OSHA published
a final rule clarifying the 1987 hazard communication stan￾dard. The clarifications and amendments include (i) certain
exemptions from labeling requirements and other provisions
in the standard; (ii) parts of the provision for a written
hazard communication program; (iii) the duties of distribu￾tors, manufacturers and importers of hazardous chemicals to
provide SDSs; and (iv) provisions regarding the content of
the SDSs.250
In 1990, OSHA promulgated a separate hazard commu￾nication standard for laboratories. This laboratory standard
superseded the hazard communication standard along with
several other health standards for research and analyt￾ical type labs if the laboratory implemented a chemical
hygiene plan that includes training, medicals, monitoring,
hazard identification, and recordkeeping.251 In 1994, OSHA
promulgated another final hazard communication rule
requiring employers who receive shipments of hazardous
materials to leave any existing placards or warning labels
on the shipments until the materials are removed from their
containers.252
In 2006, OSHA published an advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking, indicating it would update the hazard commu￾nication standard to be consistent with the internationally
recognized Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for the
Labeling of Chemicals.
253 At the same time, OSHA made
available on its Web site a GHS information topic page.254 In
2009, OSHA published a notice of proposed rulemaking255
and a notice of correction to correct misprints in the
proposal.256
In 2012, OSHA promulgated a final rule. The final rule
included: (i) revised criteria for classification of chemical
hazards; (ii) revised labeling provisions that include require￾ments for use of standardized signal words, pictograms,
hazard statements, and precautionary statements; (iii) a spec￾ified format for SDSs, and related revisions to definitions of
terms used in the Hazard Communication Standard; and (iv)
requirements for employee training on labels and SDSs.257
3.3.5 Hazardous Waste Operations
Pursuant to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthoriza￾tion Act (SARA) of 1986, OSHA issued an interim stan￾dard in 1986 on hazardous waste operations.258 In 1989,
OSHA issued a final standard on hazardous waste oper￾ations and emergency response (“HAZWOPER”).259 The
HAZWOPER standard for the construction industry (29
CFR 1926.65) is identical to 29 CFR 1910.120 for general
industry. The final standard was challenged by the AFL-CIO
on the sixtieth day following issuance, but the D.C. Circuit,
relying on Section 6(5)(b), dismissed the petition for review
based on lack of timeliness in filing.260
In 1987, Congress amended the Superfund law to
require OSHA to add provisions to the HAZWOPER
standard to establish certification of training given to emer￾gency responders.261 OSHA proposed certification rules
in 1990.262 After developing nonmandatory guidelines
to address training criteria for hazardous waste workers,
and observing the private sector accreditation procedures,
OSHA withdrew the accreditation of training programs
for hazardous waste operations from their Regulatory
Agenda on 9 December 2002.263 OSHA’s current position
is summarized on its Web site as follows:
The Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency
Response standard (HAZWOPER), 29 C.F.R. § 1910.120,
states in paragraph (e)(5) that “Trainers shall be qualified
to instruct employees about the subject matter that is being
presented in training”. In addition, 29 C.F.R. 1910.120(e)(5)
explains that the qualifications of the instructors may be
shown by academic degrees, completed training courses
and/or work experience. At this time, OSHA does not
have any specific requirements to certify an instructor. The
subjects that trainers should be able to convey to employees
at hazardous waste operations who need training are summa￾rized in paragraphs (e), (p) and (q) of the HAZWOPER
standard.264
3.3.6 Respiratory Protection
In January 1998, OSHA published a revised respiratory
protection rule.265 The revised respiratory protection stan￾dard applies to General Industry (Part 1910), Shipyards (Part
1915), Marine Terminals (Part 1917), Longshoring (Part
1918), and Construction (Part 1926). Paragraph (a)(1) estab￾lishes OSHA’s hierarchy of controls by requiring the use of
feasible engineering controls as the primary means to control
air contaminants. Respirators are required when “effective
engineering controls are not feasible, or while they are being
instituted.” Paragraph (a)(2) requires employers to provide
employees with respirators that are “applicable and suitable”
321PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
for the purpose intended “when such equipment is necessary
to protect the health of the employee.”
If respirators are necessary to protect the health of
the employer or respirators are required by the employer,
the standard requires employers to develop and imple￾ment a written respiratory protection program with
worksite-specific procedures. Such programs are to list
all circumstances in the employees’ working environment
for which respirators are necessary to protect their health and
are to contain workplace-specific procedures for respiratory
protection. OSHA estimated that about five million workers
at more than a million workplaces would be protected by
the final standard that is considered a “building block stan￾dard” because future standards that call for respirator use in
working with specific toxic substances will refer back to the
final respiratory protection rule. Importantly, the respiratory
protection standard provides that fit testing is required prior
to initial use, whenever a different respirator facepiece is
used, and at least annually thereafter. An additional fit test is
required whenever the employee reports, or the employer or
health care provider makes visual observations of, changes
in the employee’s physical condition that could affect
respirator fit (e.g. facial scarring, dental changes, cosmetic
surgery, or an obvious change in body weight).
The 1998 revised respiratory protection standard was
challenged by several industry groups and upheld in its
entirety by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit.266 In 1998, when the new respiratory protection
standard was adopted for all other industries, OSHA re￾designated the previous §1910.134 as §1910.139, Respira￾tory Protection for Mycobacterium tuberculosis(TB). OSHA
anticipated that §1910.139 would be replaced shortly by a
final rule for TB since they had published a notice of a
proposed TB standard in late 1997,267 which would have
required that respirators be used to protect health care
workers from TB exposure. When the tuberculosis infection
rates decreased significantly in the late 1990s, OSHA aban￾doned its plans for a TB rule. In 2003, OSHA published
a final rule revoking §1910.139 and terminated its TB
rulemaking.268
The effect on the healthcare industry was to place them
under a duty to comply with §1910.134, which requires
initial and annual fit testing for all respirator wearers. The
health care industry objected to the additional burden of
performing the more frequent fit tests for respirators worn
to protect against TB. In 2004, an appropriations rider
was added to OSHA’s budget preventing it from using
funds appropriated in fiscal year (FY) 2005 (beginning on 1
October 2004) to enforce the annual fit testing requirement,
when the respirators were worn solely to protect against
occupational exposure to TB. In FY 2006 and FY 2007,
the same budget language was enacted and OSHA refrained
from inspecting or citing employers for requirement to do
annual fit testing of respirators for occupational exposure
to tuberculosis. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of
2008, no appropriations rider appeared to limit OSHA’s
enforcement of the respiratory protection standard in health
care institutions.
In 2006, OSHA revised its existing Respiratory Protection
Standard to add definitions and requirements for Assigned
Protection Factors (APFs) and Maximum Use Concentra￾tions (MUCs).269 The revisions also supersede the respirator
selection provisions of existing substance-specific standards
with these new APFs (except for the respirator selection
provisions of the 1,3-Butadiene Standard). The final rule
became effective from 22 November 2006.
3.4 Employer Duties Arising from Selected
Safety Standards
3.4.1 Confined Spaces
Beginning in in 1975,270 and extending through 1979271
and 1980,272 OSHA worked on developing a standard on
confined spaces for general industry and for the construction
industry. In 1989, OSHA issued a proposed rule on confined
spaces, but for general industry only.273 In January 1993,
OSHA published a final rule on permit-required confined
spaces for general industry, requiring employers to establish
permit systems and training programs for workers.274 The
standard was designed to protect workers who enter storage
tanks and other confined spaces nearly five million times
each year from toxic atmospheres, lack of oxygen and other
hazards. The rule requires employers to identify all confined
spaces at their worksites that could pose a hazard and to
establish policies preventing unauthorized entry into them.
It also requires employers to provide trained rescue teams,
although off-site emergency response personnel can be used
to satisfy this requirement.
Following the settlement of several legal challenges
that had been consolidated in the Eleventh Circuit, OSHA
issued an amendment to the final confined spaces rule in
December 1998 that provided for greater participation by
employees in the permitting system, allowed for employees
to observe testing or monitoring of confined spaces, and clar￾ified employers’ duties in providing the rescue program.275
OSHA also promulgated a separate final confined spaces
standard for the shipyard industry, which requires shipyard
employers to designate “competent” individuals to make
initial evaluations of confined spaces, to ensure that detailed
records of atmospheric testing of confined spaces are kept,
and to label unsafe confined spaces.276 In 2007, OSHA
proposed a rule for confined spaces in the construction
industry and addressed issues that are unique to construction
such as higher employee turnover rates, changing worksites,
and the multi-employer business model that is common to
construction sites.277 In 2015, OSHA promulgated a final
rule for confined spaces in construction.278
322OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
3.4.2 Personal Protective Equipment
In 1971, OSHA adopted a national consensus standard on
PPE. In April 1994, OSHA published a final rule setting
out employers’ requirements to provide their workers with
protective equipment, including gloves, goggles, helmets
and safety shoes.279 The rule was intended to provide
improved eye, face, hand, head, and foot protection for
nearly 11.7 million employees. In October 1994, OSHA
established a policy on the issue of payment for required
PPE and stated that for all PPE standards the employer must
both provide and pay for the required PPE, except in limited
situations.280
In October 1997, the Review Commission declined to
accept OSHA’s interpretation in its memorandum as applied
to 29 C.F.R. §1910.132(a) because the Review Commission
believed the memorandum was inconsistent with OSHA’s
previous position on the issue and vacated OSHA’s cita￾tion to the employer for failing to pay for metatarsal foot
protection.281 Rather than appealing this decision, OSHA
decided to revise its final rule to make clear that it intended
for employers to pay for the required equipment.
In 1999, the OSHA published a proposal to require
employers to pay for all protective equipment, including
PPE, with explicit exceptions for certain safety shoes,
prescription safety eyewear, and logging boots.282 After an
initial notice and comment period, an informal rulemaking
hearing, a second notice and comment period on specific
issues, and a filing of a lawsuit by labor unions in 2007 to
force OSHA to issue a final rule, OSHA did finally issue its
final PPE rule Employer Payment for Personal Protective
Equipment.
283
3.5 Other Standards Not Promulgated
by OSHA or Nullified by Congress
OSHA has proposed standards in the past that have not been
promulgated or, in the case of Ergonomics, promulgated
by OSHA but subsequently nullified by Congress. OSHA
continues to develop safety and health standards. For an up￾to-date list of OSHA regulatory and deregulatory actions, the
reader is encouraged to go to the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions at www.reginfo.gov.
3.5.1 Combustible Dust
In 2006, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation
Board (CSB) completed a study of combustible dust hazards
and identified 281 combustible dust incidents between 1980
and 2005 that killed 119 workers and injured 718. The
CSB recommended that OSHA pursue rulemaking to protect
further loss of life from incidents of combustible dust. On 7
February 2008, a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar in
Port Wentworth, GA sustained a dust explosion, killing 13
people and injuring 42 others. The CSB report and the Impe￾rial Sugar Refinery explosion resulted in OSHA’s decision to
consider rulemaking to develop a combustible dust standard
for general industry.
There are a number of existing OSHA standards that
address prevention of combustible dust explosion risk such
as (i) 1910.22 Housekeeping; (ii) 1910.38 Emergency
Action Plans; (iii) 1910.94 Ventilation; (iv) 1910.107 Spray
Finishing; (v) 1910.146 Permit Required Confined Spaces;
(vi) 1910.269 Electric Power Generation; (vii) Trans￾mission and Distribution (coal handling); (viii) 1910.272
Grain Handling Facilities; and (ix) 1910.307 Hazard
Communication. Despite these standards, OSHA lacks a
comprehensive standard that addresses combustible dust
hazards. However, OSHA has published a Safety and Health
Information Bulletin on the topic284 that has implemented
a Combustible Dust National Emphasis Program (NEP)285
and has conducting stakeholder meetings.286
3.5.2 Diacetyl
Health hazard evaluations performed by the NIOSH of
workplaces using “butter flavorings” used in the microwave
popcorn industry have implicated diacetyl as a cause of
a rare, but severe, lung disease, called bronchiolitis oblit￾erans (4). Severe obstructive airway disease has been
observed not only in the microwave popcorn industry but
also in other food flavoring manufacturing plants. Diacetyl is
a chemical that is found as a natural constituent of butter as
well as a chemical added as a flavoring to impart a “buttery”
taste to foods.
On 26 July 2007, the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union (UFCW) and the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) filed a petition requesting
that OSHA issue an ETS for all employees exposed to
diacetyl. OSHA denied the petition on 25 September 2007.
However, in July 2007, OSHA announced a National Special
Emphasis Program for Microwave Processing Plants.287 In
2007, OSHA also published a Safety and Health Informa￾tion Bulletin on the topic288 and issued Hazard Communi￾cation guidance for food flavorings containing diacetyl.289
In October 2007, OSHA also held a stakeholder meeting to
consider Section 6(b) rulemaking for diacetyl and planned to
set up a panel to assess the impact of diacetyl on small busi￾ness in the face of congressional legislation to force OSHA
to issue an interim PEL within 90 days and a final PEL within
two years after enactment.290 OSHA published an advanced
notice of proposed rulemaking on 21 January 2009,291 but
withdrew an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on 17
March 2009.292
3.5.3 Ergonomics
In 1991, various labor organizations petitioned OSHA
to issue an ETS to address musculoskeletal disorders
323PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
among workers performing repetitive job tasks.293 OSHA
declined to issue and ETS but did publish an advance
notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information from
the public for a permanent standard.294 OSHA promulgated
a proposed Ergonomics Program rule on 23 November
1999,295 and a final rule on 14 November 2000.296 OSHA’s
Ergonomics Program standard rulemaking proved to be
its most controversial. A provision requiring workplace
removal protection – similar to MRP found in toxic chemical
standards – was “particularly controversial (5).”
In 2001, OSHA’s ergonomics standard became the first
standard to be “nullified” by Congress by means of a reso￾lution of disapproval under the Congressional Review of
Agency Rulemaking Act (CRA).297 The resolution of disap￾proval under the CRA was signed into law by President Bush
on 20 March 2000, and OSHA’s Ergonomics Program Stan￾dard ceased to have any legal effect.298 OSHA has issued
guidance documents to address ergonomic issues industry
by industry.299 OSHA has issued ergonomic guidelines for
meatpacking, nursing homes, retail grocery stores, poultry
processing, and shipyards.300
The question arises whether OSHA can promulgate a
new ergonomics standard considering the nullification by
Congress of its first ergonomics standard. The CRA states in
Section 801(b)(2): “A rule that does not take effect … may
not be reissued in substantially the same form, and a new rule
that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued,
unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a
law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving
the original rule.” Although this is uncharted legal territory,
OSHA could develop a rule that is not “substantially the
same form,” or OSHA could conceivably reissue its previous
standard if “specifically authorized” by the Congress.
3.5.4 Indoor Air Quality
In 1987, public interest groups petitioned OSHA to issue
an ETS to prohibit environmental tobacco smoke in indoor
workplaces,301 but OSHA denied the petitions in 1989.302
In April 1994, as part of a larger rulemaking on indoor
air quality in the workplace, OSHA proposed a rule that
would require virtually all employers to ban tobacco smoking
or to provide separately ventilated areas for smokers.303 In
the face of stiff opposition, OSHA withdrew the indoor air
quality proposed rule in 2001 citing that most states now
ban smoking thus eliminating most of the indoor air quality
concerns and that the nontobacco parts of the rule elicited
few comments.304
3.5.5 Tuberculosis and other Infectious Diseases
OSHA proposed a tuberculosis standard in October 1997
that would have covered an estimated 5.3 million health
care workers.305 The rule, as proposed, would have required
covered employers to develop written exposure control and
response plans, install engineering controls, offer employees
free TB skin tests and provide respiratory protection for
workers exposed to certain conditions. In 2003, after a rule￾making hearing, OSHA withdrew its proposal for a separate
TB standard.306 OSHA noted that the need for a tubercu￾losis standard had decreased because hospitals were adhering
to guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.307
Even though OSHA’s standard pertaining to tubercu￾losis was withdrawn, the issue of how to protect health
care workers from disease-causing bioaerosols in the work￾place has only increased since 2003. After OSHA with￾drew its tuberculosis standard, State Occupational Safety
and Health Plan states began consideration of bioaerosol
standards. On 5 August 2009, California’s first-in-the-nation
Aerosol Transmissible Diseases (ATD) Standard took legal
effect.308 The California Standard establishes a compre￾hensive approach to control of diseases identified as either
requiring “droplet precautions” or “airborne infection isola￾tion.” Among the controls required by the standard are
written infection control procedures including source control
measures such as providing surgical masks or other materials
to symptomatic persons who enter the facility. The proce￾dures should include how those patients can be placed in
separate areas, to the extent feasible, to reduce exposure to
employees.
In 2010, OSHA published a RFI on occupational expo￾sure to infectious diseases in healthcare settings.309 OSHA
intended to publish a proposed rule to address the risk to
workers exposed to infectious diseases in healthcare and
other related high-risk environments such as emergency
response, corrections, homeless shelters and laboratories.310
3.5.6 Workplace Violence Prevention
OSHA has issued a number of guidelines for employers
on the topic. OSHA’s violence prevention guidelines cover
health care and social services,311 and late-night retail
establishments.312 In addition to issuing guidelines on
workplace violence prevention, in 2016 OSHA issued a
RFI on a potential standard to prevent workplace violence
in healthcare and social assistance settings.313 The RFI
requested information on topics such as effective strategies
for reducing incidents of violence in various healthcare and
social assistance settings.
3.6 Employer Duties Arising from Specific
Regulations
3.6.1 Recordkeeping
The OSH Act requires the Secretary to adopt regulations in
two areas of recordkeeping. First, Section 8(c)(2) requires
the Secretary to issue regulations requiring employers
324OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
“maintain accurate records of, and to make periodic reports
on, work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses other than
minor injuries requiring only first aid treatment and which
do not involve medical treatment, loss of consciousness,
restriction of work or motion, or transfer to another job.”314
Section 8(c)(1) also authorizes the Secretary to promul￾gate regulations requiring employers to make, keep, and
preserve such records regarding the causes and prevention
of occupational accidents and illnesses.315 Second, Section
24(a) requires the Secretary to develop and maintain an
effective program of collection, compilation, and analysis of
occupational safety and health statistics.316 After passage of
the OSH Act, OSHA issued the required occupational injury
and illness recording and reporting regulations as 29 C.F.R.
Part 1904.317
In 1990, OSHA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
executed a memorandum of understanding that makes the
BLS responsible for conducting the nationwide statistical
compilation of occupational illnesses and injuries (Annual
Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses), while OSHA
administers the regulatory components of the recordkeeping
system. The BLS program requires employers to participate
in periodic surveys of occupational injuries and illnesses. The
survey form is OSHA Form 300S, and an employer who
receives such a form has a duty to complete and return it
promptly.318
In 2001, OSHA updated significantly its recordkeeping
regulations implementing Sections 8(c)(1) and (2).319
OSHA’s new standard requires employers to keep the
following records (or the equivalents thereof): (1) OSHA
Form 300 – a log and annual summary of all recordable
occupational injuries and illnesses and (2) OSHA Form
10 – a supplementary record for each occupational injury
or illness.320 The regulations further require that a copy of
Form 300, summarizing the year’s occupational illnesses and
injuries, be posted in each establishment in a conspicuous
place or places where notices to employees are customarily
posted. The required records must be retained in each estab￾lishment for five years following the end of the year to which
they relate.321
Small employers are exempt from many, but not all,
of OSHA’s recordkeeping requirements. For example,
employers who had no more than 10 employees at any
time during the calendar year preceding the current one are
exempt from the requirements of keeping OSHA Forms 300
and 101. Such employers, however, are not exempt from the
requirement of reporting accidents resulting in fatalities or
multiple hospitalizations. In addition, small employers may
be selected to participate in the BLS periodic surveys and,
if selected, must maintain a log and summary on Form 300
for the survey year, and must make the required reports on
survey Form 300S.322
Several studies have raised the issue that the Survey of
Occupational Injuries and Illness (SOII) conducted by the
BLS based on a sample of collected OSHA Form 300s
may not be representative of the true magnitude of nonfatal
occupational injuries and illnesses (6, 7). As pointed out by
the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) in its October
2009 report,323 the BLS does not verify the accuracy of the
data it collected for the SOII and has recognized that the
limited scope of its survey may affect how representative the
SOII’s findings are for prioritization of governmental action
on safety and health risks.
The GAO report also stated that many factors affect the
accuracy of employers’ injury and illness data including
disincentives that may discourage workers from reporting
work-related injuries and illnesses to their employers and
disincentives that may discourage employers from recording
them. Among these factors include a worker’s fear of job loss
or disciplinary action or fear of jeopardizing rewards based
on having low injury or illness. Employers may not record
injuries or illnesses because they are afraid of increasing
their workers’ compensation premiums or jeopardizing their
chances of winning contract bids for new work. In response
to the GAO Report, OSHA announced in 2009 a National
Emphasis Program to ensure that injuries and illnesses are
accurately reported.324
In 2016, OSHA revised its Recordkeeping and Reporting
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses regulation325 to add
requirements for the electronic submission of injury and
illness information employers are already required to
keep under existing OSHA regulations.326 The final rule
also amends OSHA’s recordkeeping regulation to update
requirements on how employers inform employees to report
work-related injuries and illnesses to their employer. The
final rule requires “employers to inform employees of
their right to report work-related injuries and illnesses free
from retaliation; clarifies the existing implicit requirement
that an employer’s procedure for reporting work-related
injuries and illnesses must be reasonable and not deter
or discourage employees from reporting; and incorpo￾rates the existing statutory prohibition on retaliating
against employees for reporting work-related injuries or
illnesses.”327
OSHA developed an Injury Tracking Application to aid
employer in the electronic submission of the required records
to OSHA.328 The electronic submission requirement became
effective on 1 January 2017. The new reporting requirements
will be phased in over two years. In 2017, all covered estab￾lishments must submit information from their completed
2016 Form 300A by 15 December 2017. In 2018, covered
establishments with 250 or more employees must submit
information from all completed 2017 forms (300A, 300, and
301) by 1 July 2018, and covered establishments with 20–249
employees must submit information from their completed
2017 Form 300A by 1 July 2018. Beginning in 2019 and
every year thereafter, covered establishments must submit
the information by March 2.329
325PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
3.6.2 Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illnesses
to OSHA
Previously, employers were required to report to OSHA the
death of any employee from a work-related incident or the
inpatient hospitalization of three or more employees from a
work-related incident. Employers had 48 hours to report, but
in 1994 OSHA reduced the reporting period to eight hours.330
In 1995, the fatality and multiple hospitalization reporting
rule was extended to federal agencies.331
In 2014, OSHA revised the requirements for reporting
work-related fatality, injury, and illness information and
updated the list of industries that are partially exempt from
requirements to keep records of work-related injuries and
illnesses due to relatively low occupational injury and illness
rates.332 Revised 29 C.F.R. Section 1904.39 now requires
employers to report the following events to OSHA: (i) all
work-related fatalities; (ii) all work-related hospitalizations
of one or more employees; (iii) all work-related amputations;
and (iv) all work-related losses of an eye.333 Employers can
report in three ways: (i) by telephone or in person to the
OSHA Area Office that is nearest to the site of the incident;
(ii) by telephone to the OSHA toll-free central telephone,
1-800-321-OSHA (6742); or (iii) by electronic submission
using the reporting application located on OSHA’s public
Web site at www.osha.gov.
334
3.6.3 Access to Employee Exposure and Medical
Records
Section 8(c)(3) of the OSH Act authorizes the Secretary,
in cooperation with the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, to issue regulations requiring employers to main￾tain accurate records of employee exposure to potentially
toxic materials or harmful physical agents, which are
required to be monitored or measured under Section 6.
Employees or their representatives have an opportunity to
observe such monitoring or measuring, and to have access
to the records.335 The Access to Employee Exposure and
Medical Records regulation requires employers to maintain
exposure and medical records pertaining to their employees’
exposure to toxic substances and harmful physical agents.336
The regulation requires that the medical record for each
employee shall be preserved and maintained for at least the
duration of employment plus 30 years337 with exceptions.338
In 1980, OSHA promulgated a rule providing access
to employer-generated exposure and medical records to
employees and employee representatives.339 The rule was
challenged on a number of grounds such as exceeding
OSHA’s authority, in violation of an employer’s Fourth
Amendment rights, and in violation of an employee’s right to
privacy, but upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit in 1984.340 In 1988, OSHA made minor amendments
to the standard.341
4 CHALLENGING A STANDARD AFTER
PROMULGATION
4.1 Judicial Review
Any person who may be adversely affected by an OSHA
standard may file a petition under Section 6(f) challenging its
validity in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the circuit wherein
such person resides or has the principal place of business.342
However, the OSH Act does not grant such special court
status to OSHA regulations; judicial review of OSHA regu￾lations must first occur within the jurisdiction of a federal
district court.343 A petition for judicial review of an OSHA
standard may be filed at any time prior to the sixtieth day
after the issuance of the standard. Unless otherwise ordered,
the filing of a petition does not operate as a “stay” of the
standard.
Section 6(f) of the OSH Act directs the courts to uphold
the Secretary’s determinations in promulgating standards if
those determinations are “supported by substantial evidence
in the record considered as a whole.” In practice, federal
courts have generally declined to apply a strict “substantial
evidence” standard of review. Instead, the courts have chosen
to apply two different standards depending on whether the
agency determination to be reviewed is one of “fact” or
“policy.” Courts have essentially taken the position that
only the Secretary’s findings of fact should be reviewed
pursuant to a substantial evidence standard, while the Secre￾tary’s policy determinations should be substantiated by a
detailed statement of reasons, which are subject to a test
of reasonableness.344 The courts have adopted this approach
with respect to ETSs as well as permanent standards.
4.2 Variance from Compliance with Specific
Standards
4.2.1 Permanent Variance
Section 6(d) of OSHA provides that any affected employer
may apply to the Secretary for a variance from an OSHA
standard.345 The employer must show by a preponderance of
the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods,
operations, or processes used or proposed to be used will
provide “employees with employment and places of employ￾ment that are as safe and healthful as those that would prevail
if the employer complied with the standard.”346 Affected
employees are to be given notice of each application for a
variance and an opportunity to participate in a hearing.
4.2.2 Temporary Variance
The OSH Act provides mechanisms to enable employers
to obtain variances of a more temporary nature than those
326OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
sought under Section 6(d). Section 6(b)(6)(A) provides for
“temporary” variances upon application when an employer
establishes one of two conditions. First, the employer is
unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because
of unavailability of professional or technical personnel, or
of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance
with the standard, or because necessary construction or alter￾ation of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date.
Second, the employer is taking all available steps to safe￾guard employees against the hazards covered by the standard
and has an effective program for coming into compliance
with it.347 Temporary variances are limited by the circum￾stances of need or for one year.348
4.2.3 Experimental Variance
Section 6(b)(6)(C) authorizes the Secretary to grant a vari￾ance from any standard, or part of a standard, if it is
determined by the Secretary (or upon certification by the
HHS Secretary) that such a variance is needed to allow an
employer to engage in an approved experiment. The aim
of an experimental variance is for OSHA to gain additional
knowledge about effective health and safety method that can
be adopted by OSHA for wider application.
4.2.4 National Defense Variance
Section 16 permits the Secretary, after notice and an oppor￾tunity for hearing, to provide such reasonable limitations and
rules and regulations allowing “reasonable variations, toler￾ances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of
this Act as he may find necessary and proper to avoid serious
impairment of the national defense.”349
5 ENFORCEMENT OF THE OSH ACT
The enforcement scheme set forth in the OSH Act has
been subject to various legal challenges on several fronts,
including challenges to its constitutionality. For instance,
in Atlas Roofing Company, Inc. v. OSHRC,
350 a cited
employer argued that the OSH Act was constitutionally
defective because civil penalties under the act are criminal in
nature, and call for the constitutional protections of the Sixth
Amendment and Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Second,
the employer contended that even if, the penalties are civil
in nature, the OSH Act violates the Seventh Amendment
because of the absence of a jury trial for fact-finding. Third,
the employer argued that the OSH Act denies the employer
his or her right to a Fifth Amendment “prejudgment” due
process hearing since Review Commission orders are self￾executing unless the employer affirmatively seeks review.
Finally, the employer asserted that the overall penalty struc￾ture of the OSH Act violates due process because it “chills”
the employer’s right to seek review of the citation and
penalty. In Atlas Roofing, the Fifth Circuit rejected all the
employer’s constitutional contentions. The U.S. Supreme
Court granted a petition for certiorari in that case, limited
to the Seventh Amendment issue, and subsequently upheld
the OSH Act’s provision for imposition of civil penalties
without fact finding by a jury.351
There have been other constitutional challenges to various
OSHA enforcement policies. In March 1998, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected an employer’s
contention that being fined administrative penalties even
after it was criminally prosecuted for the same offenses under
the OSH Act, violated the double jeopardy clause of the
Fifth Amendment.352 Finally, in a due process challenge, the
Review Commission has held that OSHA did not violate an
employer’s due process rights when it issued separate sets of
citations, instead of only one citation, for alleged violations
at nine different trenching sites on the same construction
project.353
5.1 Types of Inspections
OSHA conducts two general types of inspections: unpro￾grammed and programmed. Unprogrammed inspections are
conducted in response to specific evidence of a hazardous
condition at a specific worksite (9). These types of inspec￾tions can be in response to a complaint filed by an employee
or an employee representative,354 referral from media
reports, report of an imminent danger, report of a fatality or
catastrophe, or for the purpose of follow-up or monitoring.355
Programmed inspections are inspections conducted as a part
of a national or regional inspection scheduling plan. The
scheduling plan uses neutral criteria in selecting specific
establishments to inspect. Criteria such as injury or illness
incidence rates in a specific industry sector or type of estab￾lishment, previous citation history, or employee exposure
to specific toxic agents are frequently used as the basis for
programmed inspections.
5.2 Right to Inspect and Warrants
Section 8(a) of the OSH Act authorizes the Secretary to enter,
inspect, and investigate places of employment to discover
possible violations of the employer’s general and specific
duties under the OSH Act.356 Even though Section 8(a)
grants OSHA broad authority to enter and inspect work￾places, the Fourth Amendment has been held to apply to
OSHA’s inspections.
In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court held Section 8(a) uncon￾stitutional insofar as it authorized nonconsensual, warrant￾less inspections at an employer’s establishment. In Marshall
v. Barlow’s, Inc.,357 the Court held that an employer may
refuse entry to an OSHA compliance officer unless a warrant
327PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
is obtained, reasoning that employers have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their commercial property and are,
therefore, guaranteed the right, under the Fourth Amend￾ment, to be free from unreasonable official intrusions.358 The
Court explained, however, the Secretary does not need to
make a showing of probable cause in the criminal sense to
obtain an inspection warrant. Probable cause for an adminis￾trative inspection may be based either on a specific evidence
of a violation or on a showing that reasonable legislative
or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are
satisfied with respect to a particular establishment.359 By way
of illustration of the latter, the Court stated that a warrant
could properly be issued upon a showing that a particular
business was chosen for inspection pursuant to a general
enforcement plan derived from “neutral sources.”360
An inspection may proceed without a warrant, of course,
if the employer361 or an authorized third party consents to
the inspection,362 or if the conditions observed by OSHA
are in “plain, obvious view” on the employer’s premises.363
Modern technology can even be employed to obtain a “view”
of a worksite. For example, in L.R. Wilson & Sons, Inc. v.
OSHRC,
364 the Fourth Circuit held that an OSHA inspector
could videotape employer activities from across the street
from the worksite. However, the general rule is that absent
employer consent, the existence of the plain view exception,
or when OSHA cannot show there was an emergency,365 a
warrant is required.
5.2.1 Probable Cause Necessary for Warrant
Following the Barlow’s decision, federal courts have
addressed the question of what constitutes a showing of
probable cause necessary to obtain an OSHA inspection
warrant. The Supreme Court stated in Barlow’sthat probable
cause authorizing an OSHA inspection may be based on
evidence that a specific violation exists at the establishment
to be inspected. Thus, probable cause for warrant issuance
may be established by OSHA’s receipt of a written, signed
employee complaint, although circuit courts have held that
the nature of the violation complained of must be described
in the warrant application so the magistrate issuing the
warrant may make an independent determination that prob￾able cause exists. In addition, the majority of federal courts
addressing the issue have concluded that a warrant based on
specific employee complaints is overly broad if it purports
to authorize a “wall-to-wall” inspection of the entire plant.
Instead, the scope of the warrant and resulting inspection
must bear a reasonable relationship to the specific violations
that formed the basis of the complaint.366
5.2.2 Ex Parte Warrants
Ex parte warrants (without notice from OSHA or knowledge
by the employer of the warrant) are the preferred form of
compulsory process for OSHA. In 1980, OSHA amended
its regulation concerning “compulsory process.”367 OSHA
stated it may obtain an inspection warrant without prior
notice to the employer.”368
5.2.3 Challenging the Validity of a Warrant
An employer who wishes to contest a warrant has several
choices. First, the employer may refuse to obey the warrant
and may then move to quash it in district court. Second,
the employer may refuse to comply with the warrant and
litigate its validity in a civil contempt proceeding. Third, the
employer may allow the inspection to proceed and move to
suppress evidence after the warrant’s execution (10).
In Babcock & Wilcox Company v. Marshall, the Third
Circuit indicated that an employer may obtain a district court
hearing on a warrant’s validity prior to inspection by refusing
to obey the warrant (thereby risking contempt), moving to
quash the warrant, and promptly appealing if the motion
is denied.369 However, the Third Circuit held that if the
employer obeys the warrant, he must “exhaust his admin￾istrative remedies” before the Review Commission prior to
obtaining judicial review of his objections to the warrant.370
The overwhelming majority of federal appellate courts have
agreed with the Third Circuit that the doctrine of exhaus￾tion of remedies precludes an employer from challenging an
executed warrant in federal court.371 In contrast, the Seventh
Circuit has held that in certain circumstances an employer
may obtain district court review of a warrant even after an
inspection has been completed.372 The same court, however,
modified its stance on post-execution challenges when it
joined the other circuits in requiring employers who chal￾lenge completed OSHA inspections on Fourth Amendment
grounds to go to the Review Commission first before turning
to the federal courts.373
5.3 Inspection Procedures
OSHA inspections must be made at reasonable times, in
a reasonable manner, and within reasonable limits.374 In
Hamilton Fixture v. Secretary of Labor,
375 the employer chal￾lenged the reasonableness of OSHA’s conducting a wall-to￾wall inspection of a manufacturing facility during a work
slowdown prompted by labor unrest. The employer claimed
that a work slowdown was not a reasonable time to do
the inspection, because it was unable to follow its normal
safety procedures under those circumstances. The court,
however, rejected this argument and held the inspection to
be reasonable.
5.4 Imminent Danger Inspections
Section 13(a) of the OSH Act defines an imminent danger
as “any conditions or practices in any place of employment
328OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
which are such that a danger exists which could reasonably
be expected to cause death or serious physical harm imme￾diately or before the imminence of such danger can be
eliminated through the enforcement procedures otherwise
provided in this Act.”376 If a complaint of imminent danger
is received, OSHA can conduct an immediate inspection
or arrange to have employees removed from the danger. If
an inspection cannot be conducted in a timely fashion, or
employees cannot be removed, OSHA may ask for injunc￾tive relief. The Act confers jurisdiction on the U.S. district
courts, upon petition of the Secretary, to restrain hazardous
employment conditions or practices if they create an immi￾nent danger of death or serious physical harm that cannot
be eliminated through the OSH Act’s other enforcement
procedures.377
Section 13(d) also provides that an employee, who may
be injured by OSHA’s failure to protect him or her from an
imminent danger, can bring a mandamus action to compel
the Secretary to seek injunctive relief.378 A more realistic
employee response to imminent danger is self-help rather
than finding an attorney and seeking a mandamus writ (i.e.
lawsuit used to compel OSHA to act).
5.5 Types of Violations
The OSH Act authorizes the Secretary to issue citations and
propose penalties for employers who are believed to have
violated the Act or its implementing standards and regula￾tions. Section 9(a) directs the Secretary to issue citations
“with reasonable promptness” following an inspection or
investigation.379 According to Section 9(c), no citation may
be issued after the expiration of six months from the occur￾rence of any violation.380
Each citation is to be in writing and must “describe with
particularity the nature of the violation,” including a refer￾ence to the provision of the statute, standard, rule, regulation,
or order alleged to have been violated.381 Interpretations of
the “particularity” requirements have generally dealt with the
precision of the reference to the standard allegedly violated,
and the adequacy of the description of the alleged violation.
Several federal courts have held that, to meet the particu￾larity requirement, a citation must provide the employer with
“fair notice” of the violation sufficient to enable it both to
prepare its defense and to correct the cited hazard.382 The
Fifth Circuit has held that an employer may raise a cita￾tion’s lack of particularity in a later failure-to-abate violation
issued by the Secretary. The court reasoned that a citation
that is too vague to give notice of the action necessary to
correct the cited hazard also makes it impossible for the
Review Commission to determine whether the hazard has
been abated.383
Section 9(a) states that each citation must also fix a
reasonable time for the abatement of the violation.384
Section 9(b) requires employers to post each citation promi￾nently at or near each place where a violation referred to in
the citation occurred. The mechanics of how, when, where,
and how long to post the citations are set forth in regulations
issued by the Secretary.385
Within a reasonable time after a citation has been issued,
the Secretary is directed by Section 10(a) to notify the
employer by certified mail of the penalty, if any, which
will be assessed for the violation. Civil violations fall into
the following general categories: de minimus, other-than￾serious, serious, willful, and repeated. A civil penalty is
based, at least in part, on the nature of the violation.386
5.5.1 DeMinimis Violations
If noncompliance with an OSHA standard or regulation
presents no direct or immediate relationship to the safety or
health of employees, the violation is de minimis.
387
There are three situations which can result in a finding
a de minimis violation. First, an employer complies with
the clear intent of the standard but deviates from its partic￾ular requirements in a manner that has no direct or imme￾diate relationship to employee safety or health. Second, an
employer complies with a proposed standard or amendment
or a consensus standard rather than with the standard in
effect at the time of the inspection, and the employer’s action
clearly provides equal or greater employee protection or the
employer complies with a written interpretation issued by
the OSHA Regional or National Office. Third, an employer’s
workplace is technically beyond the requirements of the
applicable standard and provides equivalent or more effec￾tive employee safety or health protection.388
5.5.2 Other-than-Serious Violations
An other-than-serious type of violation is “one in which there
is a direct and immediate relationship between the violative
condition and occupational safety and health, but is not of
such relationship that a resultant injury is death or serious
physical harm.”389 The OSHA Field Operations Manual
(FOM) states that an other-than-serious type of violation
“shall be cited in situations where the most serious injury
or illness that would be likely to result from a hazardous
condition cannot reasonably be predicted to cause death
or serious physical harm to exposed employees but does
have a direct and immediate relationship to their safety and
health.”390
The original Senate version of the OSH Act treated all
violations as “serious.” As finally enacted, however, the
OSH Act incorporated a House proposal for violations
“determined not to be of a serious nature.”391 The statute
does not describe the elements of an other-than-serious
violation and provides no guidelines for determining when
a violation is not serious. The Fifth Circuit, however, has
329PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
described other-than-serious violations as violations that
do not create a substantial probability of serious phys￾ical harm.392 The Review Commission has explained
that serious, and other-than-serious violations, can be
distinguished based on the seriousness of injuries that
experience has shown are reasonably likely to result
when an accident does arise from a particular set of
circumstances.393
5.5.3 Serious Violations
Section 17(k) of the OSH Act provides that a violation is
serious if, in the event of an accident, there is a substan￾tial probability that death or serious physical harm could
result.394
The probability of an accident occurring need not be
shown to establish that a violation is serious. Rather, as the
Ninth Circuit Court ruled in California Stevedore and Ballast
v. OSHRC,
395 a serious violation exists if any accident that
could result from the violation would have a substantial prob￾ability of resulting in death or serious physical harm.396 No
actual death or physical injury is required to establish a
serious violation.397 Employer knowledge is a key element
of a serious violation. The knowledge requirement in Section
17(k) can be satisfied by a showing of actual or constructive
employer knowledge of practices or conditions that consti￾tute violations of the OSH Act. The burden is on the Secre￾tary to prove knowledge as well as the other elements of a
serious violation.
5.5.4 Willful Violations
The OSH Act contains no definition of “willful” violation.
Thus, it is not surprising that there has been some disagree￾ment on the elements of a willful violation. In Frank Irey
Jr., Inc. v. OSHRC,
398 the Third Circuit initially held that
“[w]illfulness connotes defiance or such reckless disregard
of consequences as to be equivalent to a knowing, conscious,
and deliberate flaunting of the Act. Willful means more than
merely voluntary action or omission – it involves an element
of obstinate refusal to comply.”
The majority of the circuits, as well as the Review
Commission, declined to follow the Frank Irey definition
of “willfulness.” The First and Fourth Circuits interpreted a
willful action as a “conscious, intentional, deliberate volun￾tary decision,” regardless of venial motive.399 The Review
Commission agreed that no showing of malicious intent is
necessary to establish “willfulness,”400 and defined a willful
violation as one “committed with either an intentional disre￾gard of, or plain indifference to, the Act’s requirements.”401
Most courts of appeals have adopted the Review Commis￾sion’s standard of intentional disregard or plain indifference,
or have embraced similar definitions that do not require a
showing of a bad motive.402
Thus, a conflict developed between the Third Circuit’s
view, as expressed in Frank Irey, and the majority approach.
The D.C. Circuit characterized this conflict as more apparent
than real. In Cedar Construction Co. v. OSHRC and
Marshall,
403 the court indicated that the two approaches
were likely to yield the same results in particular cases since
there is little practical difference between “obstinate refusal
to comply” and “intentional disregard” of the OSH Act. The
Third Circuit later agreed when it again addressed the “will￾fulness” question in Babcock & Wilcox Co. v. OSHRC.
404
This clarification by the Third Circuit resulted in general
agreement among the circuits that the Review Commission’s
“intentional disregard” standard is the correct one, and that
no malicious intent need be shown to establish a willful
violation.
5.5.5 Repeated Violations
The OSH Act provides no definition of a “repeated” viola￾tion. It is OSHA policy that “n employer may be cited for
a repeated violation if that employer has been cited previ￾ously for a substantially similar condition and the citation
has become a final order of the Review Commission. Gener￾ally, similar conditions can be demonstrated by showing that
in both situations the identical standard was violated. In
some circumstances, similar conditions can be demonstrated
when different standards are violated. Although there may be
different standards involved, the hazardous conditions found
could be substantially similar and therefore a repeated viola￾tion would be appropriate”.405
5.5.6 Failure-to-Abate Violations
The OSH Act does not specify fixed periods within which
violations must be remedied, but Section 9(a) does require
that each citation “fix a reasonable time for the abatement of
the violation.”406 The abatement period does not begin to run
until the date of the final order of the Review Commission
affirming the citation, as long as the review proceeding, if
any, initiated by the employer was in good faith and not
solely for delay or avoidance of penalties.407 An employer
who fails to correct a violation within the period specified
in the citation may receive an additional citation pursuant to
Section 10(b) for failure to abate.
In 1996, OSHA instituted a nationwide “Quick Fix”
abatement incentive program. Under the program, employers
could be given a 15% penalty reduction for correcting a
cited workplace hazard within 24 hours of the inspection.
The penalty reduction does not apply to violations linked
to fatal injury or illness, to serious incidents resulting in
serious injuries to employees, nor to high- or medium-gravity
serious, willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations.408 In
1997, OSHA published an Abatement Verification final rule
requiring employers to certify to OSHA that they have
330OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
corrected cited violations and to inform their employees
of the abatement actions taken.409 Prior to the final rule,
employer compliance with requests to provide verification
of abatement was voluntary, and follow-up inspections often
were necessary in order to determine whether abatement had
occurred.
5.6 Civil Penalties
On 2 November 2015, Congress passed the Federal Civil
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvement Act (2015
Inflation Adjustment Act) as part of a Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2015.410 The Inflation Adjustment Act amends the
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990.
The Inflation Adjustment Act requires the DOL to adjust its
civil money penalty levels for inflation (with an initial catch￾up adjustment) no later than January 15 of each year. The
DOL issued an interim final rule to adjust its civil monetary
penalties for inflation on 1 July 2016,411 and a final rule on
18 January 2017.412 Annual updates are expected.
Importantly, the 2015 Inflation Adjustment Act amends
the 1990 Inflation Adjustment Act by rescinding an exemp￾tion that previously disallowed inflationary adjustments for
violations of the OSH Act. As a result of the 2015 Infla￾tion Adjustment Act, OSHA’s maximum monetary civil
penalties were increased significantly for the years 2016413
and 2017. For 2017, the maximum statutory monetary civil
penalty for serious, other-than-serious, and posting require￾ments increased from $7 000 to $12 675.414 The maximum
statutory monetary civil penalty for failure-to-abate viola￾tions increased from $7 000 per day beyond the abatement
date to $12 675 per day beyond the abatement date.415 The
maximum statutory monetary civil penalty for a willful or
repeated violation increased from $70 000 to $126 749 per
violation.416
5.7 Criminal Sanctions
To secure a criminal conviction under Section 17(e) of the
OSH Act, there must be evidence to support two elements
of the offense: (i) the employer willfully violated a specific
standard, rule, order or regulation of the OSH Act; and (ii)
the violation caused the death of the employee. Willful viola￾tions that cause death to an employee are punishable upon
conviction by a fine of up to $10 000 or imprisonment for
up to six months or both.417 For a repeated willful viola￾tion that causes the death of an employee, the punishment
is increased to a fine of not more than $20 000 and 1 year in
jail (or both).418
Proof of willfulness can be shown by the employer
taking deliberate action in spite of having knowledge of
an OSHA requirement or being plainly indifferent to the
requirement.419 The second element is more easily satisfied;
all that needs to be shown is that the violation was a cause or
a contributing factor to the death of an employee.420 OSHA
will issue a civil citation even if the citation involves allega￾tions under consideration for criminal prosecution.421
The criminal penalties provided for in the OSH Act can
only be imposed by federal courts and not by the Review
Commission. For a case to be considered for criminal sanc￾tions provided by the OSH Act, OSHA must make a referral
for criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice.
How the criminal provisions of the OSH Act have been
used – or not been used – has come under criticism.422
For example, the OSH Act’s criminal provision is limited
to willful violations that result in a worker death. But, in
some of the most egregious examples of employer actions
that have proved dangerous to workers, the worker suffered
irreversible coma or another type of severe injury but did not
die. In those cases, application of the criminal provisions of
the OSH Act is inapplicable. Even when a worker death does
occur, the crime is only a Class B misdemeanor, carrying a
maximum sentence of only six months in jail.423
In addition to criminal sanctions under the OSH Act,
employers can also be subject to criminal felony penal￾ties for knowingly and willfully concealing a material fact,
making a materially false statement, or making or using any
false writing or document subject to OSHA’s jurisdiction.424
Penalties include a fine of up to $250 000 for an individual
and up to $500 000 for an organization (or two times any
resulting financial gain or loss related to the falsification).425
Employers under the jurisdiction of an occupational safety
and health state plan can also be prosecuted under that state’s
general criminal laws – homicide or manslaughter – for
work-related deaths or serious injuries.
In 2005, OSHA joined the Department of Justice (Envi￾ronmental Crimes Unit) and the EPA in a criminal liability
initiative based on the notion that firms that violate OSHA
laws may also violate environmental laws. In 2007, the
joint effort has had positive results in a case where a
company and its management officials were convicted of
violating the Clean Air and Clean Water Act and making
false statements to OSHA and obstructing OSHA’s investi￾gation of a forklift accident.426 In most of the cases brought
by the Environmental Crimes Section at the U.S. Depart￾ment of Justice, the Department has charged violations of
the endangerment provisions of environmental protection
statutes, or the general criminal provisions of Title 18 of
the United States Code, instead of the criminal provisions
of the OSH Act. Title 18 – the general criminal statute
of the United States – makes it a crime to make false
statements,427 obstruct justice,428 and commit conspiracy to
defraud the United States by impeding effective implemen￾tation of government regulatory programs.429 Under Title
18, the Department of Justice was able to charge crimes
that were charged as felonies – not misdemeanors – and
were punishable by up to 15 years in jail for knowing
331PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
endangerment and 20 years in jail for some forms of obstruc￾tion of justice.
5.8 Specific Enforcement Policies
5.8.1 Cases Subject to Violation-by-Violation Penalties
In 1986, OSHA adopted what is commonly referred to as
its “egregious penalty policy.” Cases subject to OSHA’s
violation-by-violation penalty policy are those cases where
the employer’s actions were so far outside of acceptable
standards that the willful violation was “egregious.” Besides
a violation that meets the willful serious characterization,
one of six factors must also be present to meet the “egre￾giousness” standard. The violation must have led to fatal￾ities, a worksite catastrophe, or a large number of injuries
or illnesses. The violation must have led to persistently
high rates of injuries or illnesses. The employer had an
extensive history of violations. The employer has intention￾ally disregarded its safety and health responsibilities. The
employer’s conduct, taken as a whole, amounts to clear
bad faith in the performance of his or her OSH Act duties.
Finally, the number of violations employer committed under￾mined the effectiveness of any safety and health program
the employer might have implemented.430 Since a penalty
is calculated for each instance of, or each employee subject
to, the violation, the total amount of the penalty can be
substantial.
After the Review Commission’s decision in Ho,431 which
rejected OSHA’s use of the egregious penalty policy and
disapproved the assessment of separate, per-employee penal￾ties, OSHA promulgated a final rule amending a number of
its standards “to add language clarifying that the PPE and
training requirements impose a compliance duty to each and
every employee covered by the standards and that noncom￾pliance may expose the employer to liability on a per￾employee basis.”432 In National Ass’n of Home Builders
v. OSHA,
433 the D.C. Circuit affirmed OSHA’s violation￾by-violation penalty policy. The Review Commission has
also affirmed OSHA’s authority to cite an employer on a
per-employee basis by overruling Ho in its case entitled E.
Smalis Painting Co., which involved an employer’s failure to
provide each exposed employee with medical surveillance
under OSHA’s lead standard.434
5.8.2 Multi-Employer Citation Policy
OSHA’s longstanding multi-employer citation policy
permits the agency to cite more than one employer for a
violative condition. Although the multi-employer citation
policy originated in the construction industry, the OSHRC
has ruled that with respect to the citation policy there is
no distinction between construction and nonconstruction
workplaces.435
In the construction industry, there are often many different
employers on the same worksite. Four different types of
employers can be characterized based on their relationship to
a condition that violates an OSHA standard. When a viola￾tion is observed and a particular employer’s employees are
exposed to the hazard (regardless of whether that employer
created the violative condition), OSHA may issue a citation
to that employer – the “exposing” employer. The employer
who created the condition is “creating” employer. A creating
employer may be cited by OSHA even though the creating
employer had no employees exposed to the hazard. Even
if an employer has no employees exposed to the violative
condition, nor did the employer create the hazard, he or she
may still be cited by OSHA if that employer was in a position
to control or correct the hazard – controlling or correcting
employers. A controlling or correcting employer is often the
general contractor.
OSHA’s multiemployer citation policy had its origin in
1976 when the Revision Commission stated (in a footnote)
“the general contractor is well situated to obtain abate￾ment of hazards either through its own resources or through
its supervisory capacity.”436 In a 1999 OSHA Instruction,
OSHA stated that citations should be issued not only to
exposing employers, but also to creating, controlling, and
correcting employers “whether or not their own employees
are exposed.”437
Most circuit courts have held that general contractors – as
controlling or correcting employers – may be cited by OSHA
under Section 5(a)(2) even if their own employees were not
their own.438 However, the Fifth Circuit has held that “OSHA
regulations protect only an employer’s own employees.”439
In 2017, OSHA appealed a case originating in Texas (within
the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit) of a willful citation to
a general contractor based solely on exposure to a subcon￾tractor’s employees.440 The outcome is uncertain at this
writing.
6 CONTESTATION PROCEEDINGS
6.1 Contesting Citations and Penalties
Section 10(a) of OSH Act,441 and the regulations of the
Review Commission pertaining to that section,442 provide
procedures for an employer to “contest” or challenge an
OSHA citation and its proposed civil penalties. After the
employer has been notified of the penalty proposed by the
Secretary, the employer has 15 working days to notify the
Secretary that it wishes to contest the citation or the proposed
assessment of civil penalty. A failure to notify the Secretary
within 15 days of intent to contest the citation or proposed
penalty will render the citation or penalty “a final order of
the Review Commission and not subject to review by any
court or agency.”443
332OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
OSHA regulations444 instruct employers “very notice of
intention to contest shall specify whether it is directed to
the citation or to the proposed penalty, or both.” Simi￾larly, the courts have construed the OSH Act’s enforcement
scheme as mandating a distinction between contesting a cita￾tion and contesting a proposed penalty.445 The Fifth Circuit
held446 that an employer’s letter that contested the proposed
penalty but failed to contest the citation (in fact, the letter
affirmatively admitted the violation), constituted waiver of
the employer’s right to challenge the citation on appeal.
However, the Review Commission has stated that it will
construe notices of contest that are limited to the penalty to
include a contest of the citation as well, if the cited employer
indicates later that it was his or her intent to contest the
citation.447 If an employer files a timely notice of contest
(or if within 15 working days of the issuance of a citation,
a representative of the employees files a notice challenging
the period of abatement specified in the citation), the Secre￾tary must immediately advise the Review Commission of the
intent to contest. The Review Commission then must afford
an opportunity for an administrative hearing.448
The Commission’s Rules of Procedures govern all of its
proceedings.449 Where the Commission has not promulgated
a rule, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply.450 In addi￾tion to the extensive, formal rules of practice, the rules of
the Review Commission permit any party to request simpli￾fied proceedings before an administrative law judge in cases
that do not involve alleged general duty clause violations
or alleged violations of certain enumerated standards.451
Procedures are simplified in several ways – pleadings are
limited, discovery is generally not permitted, the Federal
Rules of Evidence do not apply, and interlocutory appeals are
not permitted. The Review Commission makes available an
online publication designed for nonlawyers called the Guide
to Commission Procedures.
452
A Review Commission hearing is conducted pursuant to
the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act and is presided over
by a single administrative law judge employed by the Review
Commission. After taking testimony, the judge writes an
opinion that is subject to review by the full three-member
Commission at its discretion. An aggrieved party may peti￾tion for discretionary review before the full Review Commis￾sion and any Commission member may direct review of
a case on his or her own motion.453 If no Commissioner
member directs review, or if a timely petition for review is
not filed, the administrative law judge’s decision becomes a
final order of the Review Commission.454
Section 17(j) further empowers the Review Commission
to assess appropriate civil penalties, giving due consideration
to the size of the business of the employer being charged,
the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer,
and the history of previous violations.455 The Review
Commission has taken the position that it may exercise its
power to increase the Secretary’s proposed penalty after
considering the factors outlined above, and courts of appeals
have expressed the view that the Commission may act in
this manner.456 However, the Commission has only very
rarely acted on that authority. The Review Commission
has also held that it does not have to give “substantial
weight” to the Secretary’s proposed penalties.457 Courts
have also sanctioned the Review Commission’s right
to increase the degree of a violation from other-than￾serious to serious.458 The Review Commission has taken
the view that it can reduce the degree of a violation as
well.459
6.2 Employer’s Affirmative Defenses
A number of defenses are available to the employer when
contesting an OSHA citation and/or propose penalties.
Some defenses are “affirmative” defenses. An employer
wishing to use an affirmative defense must assert the defense
in the employer’s appeal of the citation to the Review
Commission.460 Once raised, the employer has the burden
of proving the defense.461
Affirmative defenses are varied. First, an employer can
assert that the standard cited is too vague to be legally
valid. Second, an employer can assert that the standard
cited was not properly promulgated by OSHA. Third, the
employer can assert that OSHA should have cited a more
specific standard than the one they did. Fourth, the employer
can assert that another federal agency regulates the same
condition. Fifth, the employer can charge that all means of
compliance with the standard are infeasible. Sixth, compli￾ance with the standard will create a greater hazard than
the one cited by OSHA. Seventh, the employer can asset
that the inspection was unreasonable or that the citation
represented vindictive prosecution by OSHA. Eighth, the
employer can asset that the citation lacked particularity as
required by Section 9(a). Ninth, an employer can assert
that there was an unreasonable delay in issuing the cita￾tion. Tenth, the employer can assert that the violation was
unpreventable because of employee misconduct. In asserting
any of these affirmative defenses, the employer must show
that the employer’s ability to defend against the citation was
adversely affected.
6.3 Courts of Appeals Review
The final stage of an OSHA enforcement proceeding is
review in a court of appeals (and thereafter, discretionary
review by the Supreme Court). Any person adversely
affected or aggrieved by the Review Commission’s dispo￾sition of its case may obtain review in an appropriate court
of appeals pursuant to Section 11(a) of the OSH Act.462
Section 11(b) provides that the Secretary may also obtain
review or enforcement of any final order of the Review
333PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
Commission by filing a petition for such relief in the
appropriate court of appeals. The reviewing court is bound
by Section 11(a) to apply the “substantial evidence test”
to the Commission’s findings of fact. The same section
empowers the court to direct the Review Commission to
consider additional evidence if the evidence is material and
reasonable grounds existed for a party’s failure to admit
it in the hearing before the Commission. Regarding the
penalty imposed by the Review Commission, the reviewing
court may inquire only whether the Review Commission
abused its discretion because the assessment of a penalty
is not a finding of fact but rather the exercise of a discre￾tionary grant of power.463 The Seventh Circuit has held
that interest on penalties assessed against an employer by
the Commission accrues from the date the Commission’s
order is entered, even when an employer appeals to a federal
court.464
7 RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES AND
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES UNDER
THE OSH ACT
7.1 Information Rights
7.1.1 Poster
Section 8(c)(1) of the OSH Act states that the “Secretary
shall also issue regulations requiring employers to keep
their employees informed of their protections and obliga￾tions under this Act, including provisions of applicable
standards.”465 OSHA meets these requirements by requiring
employers to post in a conspicuous place a poster furnished
by OSHA containing basic information on the OSH Act and
employee rights under the Act.466 Employers are subject
to a citation and penalty for failure to post the required
poster.467
7.1.2 Injury and Illness Log
Section 8(c)(2) requires the Secretary to prescribe regula￾tions requiring employers to maintain accurate records of
work-related fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. Under this
provision of the Act, OSHA requires most employers to
maintain a log of work-related injuries and illnesses,468 and
to post an annual summary of the log in a conspicuous
place in each workplace and to certify that the summary is
accurate.469
7.2 Right to Refuse Hazardous Work under
Section 11(c) of the OSH Act
An employee has no explicit right under the OSH Act to
refuse a work assignment because of what the employee feels
is a dangerous working condition. However, Section 11(c)(1)
of the Act prohibits discrimination against an employee
because of their exercise of rights provided by the Act.470
In 1973, the Secretary issued an administrative regulation
that interprets the Act as implying such a right under four
limited circumstances.471 First, the employee’s refusal must
be made in good faith. Second, the condition the employee
believes is a hazard is one that a reasonable person would
conclude is one that poses a real danger of death or serious
physical injury. Third, there is insufficient time to elimi￾nate the hazard by use of the OSH Act’s normal enforce￾ment means. Fourth, the employee must have asked the
employer to correct the hazard, but the employee was unable
to obtain such a correction from the employer. In Usery
v. Whirlpool Corp, the Supreme Court was faced with the
question whether an employee is protected from retaliation
by his employer if he walks off the job in an imminent
danger situation.472 In Whirlpool Corp., the Supreme Court
upheld § 1977.12(b)(2) as a valid exercise of the Secre￾tary’s authority under the OSH Act. Thus, employees are
afforded a limited right to refuse to work in imminent danger
situations.
7.3 Right to Request and Participate in a
Compliance Inspection
Section 8(f)(1) gives employees and their representatives the
right to file a complaint and request an inspection.473 OSHA
must conduct an inspection when a valid complaint is filed
with an OSHA Area Office. To be valid, the complainant
must identify themselves to OSHA. Section 8(e) of the Act
grants the right to employees and their representatives to
participate in the inspection and its opening and closing
conferences.474 The Act also provides that “a representa￾tive of the employer, and a representative authorized by his
employees, shall be given an opportunity to accompany the
Secretary or his authorized representative during the physical
inspection of any workplace …”475 The term “representa￾tive” means: (i) an authorized bargaining unit representative;
(ii) employee’s attorney; or (iii) any other person acting in
a bona fide representative capacity.476 Even though a walka￾round right is specified in the OSH Act, there is no require￾ment that the employer must compensate the employee for
his or her time.
7.4 Rights to Participate in Litigation before
the Review Commission
Two rights are granted in Section 10(c) of the OSH Act. First,
Section 10(c) grants employees the right to file a notice of
contest “alleging that the period of time fixed in the citation
for the abatement of the violation is unreasonable” and in
response,” the Commission shall afford an opportunity for a
334OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
hearing…”477 Second, Section 10(c) also provides a right to
employees to participate as parties to hearings.478 A lengthy
history of litigation has occurred over the rights granted by
Section 10(c).
7.5 Right to be Notified of Possible Imminent
Danger and Right to Seek Relief
for Imminent Dangers
Section 13(c) and (d) of the OSH Act grans employees the
right to be notified of possible imminent danger situations,
and the right to file an action to compel the Secretary to seek
relief in such situations if the Secretary has “arbitrarily and
capriciously” failed to do so.479
7.6 Right to File a Complaint against State
Program Administration
Individuals, including employees, who have a complaint
against the manner in which an OSHA-approved occupa￾tional safety and health state plan is being administered by
the state have the right to lodge a complaint with the Secre￾tary’s representative in the federal region in which the state
is located.480
7.7 Right to Access Exposure Records
Section 8(c)(3) of the OSH Act give employees the right to
observe any exposure monitoring to potentially toxic mate￾rials or harmful physical agents which are required under a
Section 6(b)(5) standard and a right of access to those expo￾sure records.481
7.8 Antidiscrimination Rights
Section 11(c) of the OSH Act makes it unlawful for any
person to discharge or in any manner discriminate against
an employee because the employee has exercised his or her
rights under the OSH Act.482 This provision is designed
to encourage employee participation in the enforcement
of OSHA standards.483 Employees who believe they have
been discriminated against in violation of Section 11(c)
must file a complaint with the Secretary within 30 days
after such violation has occurred.484 The prohibitions in
Section 11(c) are not confined to employers only as it
states that “[N]o person shall …discriminate against any
employee…”.485 In Solis v. Brighton Medical Clinic, a
federal district court held that a clinic physician could be held
personally liable for retaliatory discharge of an employee
under Section 11(c).486
The Secretary is required to investigate the complaint.
If the Secretary determines that Section 11(c) has been
violated, the Secretary is authorized to bring an action in
federal district court for an order restraining the violation and
for recovery of all appropriate relief, including rehiring or
reinstatement of the employee to his or her former position
with back pay. Section 11(c)(1) authorizes only the Secre￾tary to bring an action for violation of Section 11(c), not the
employee.487
8 VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE
PROGRAMS
8.1 On-Site Consultation Program
Since the mid-1970s, OSHA has administered a program
where employers could obtain assistance free of charge from
trained occupational safety and health personnel funded by
cooperative agreements with state agencies or universities.
In 1998, Congress and President Clinton provided express
statutory authority for OSHA’s on-site consultation program
by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Adminis￾tration Compliance Assistance Authorization Act.488 The
Act added new Section 21(d) to the OSH Act. In 2000,
OSHA revised its 1970s regulations pertaining to OSHA’s
agreements with states.489 A consultation visit parallels
what happens during an enforcement inspection, except no
penalties are assessed for violations that are identified.490
However, if an employer refuses to correct an imminent
danger or a serious hazard, the consultant is required
to inform the appropriate federal or state enforcement
authority.491 The on-site consultation program is main￾tained by states separate from their enforcement activities to
ensure the confidentiality of information obtained from the
employer.
8.1.1 Safety and Health Achievement Recognition
Program (SHARP)
OSHA regulations require every state that receives consul￾tation program funding to establish a consultation program
aimed at small, high-hazard, employers. Employers who
undergo a full on-site consultation visit, and meet other
requirements such as maintaining an injury and illness
prevention program that at a minimum addressed OSHA’s
Safety and Health Management Program Guidelines,492
may be recognized under SHARP for their exemplary safety
and health management systems. Worksites that receive
SHARP recognition are exempt from programmed inspec￾tions during the period that the SHARP certification is
valid.
335PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
8.2 OSHA’s Cooperative Programs
8.2.1 Alliance Program
Through the Alliance Program, OSHA works with groups
committed to worker safety and health to prevent workplace
fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. OSHA and the groups
work together to develop compliance assistance tools and
resources, share information with workers and employers,
and educate workers and employers about their rights and
responsibilities.493 In the Alliance Program, OSHA works
with varied partners including unions, consulates, trade or
professional organizations, faith- and community-based
organizations, businesses, and educational institutions, to
leverage resources and expertise to help ensure safe and
healthy workplaces and worker rights under the Occupa￾tional Safety and Health Act.
8.2.2 OSHA Strategic Partnership Program
Occupational Safety and Health Administration Strategic
Partnerships (OSPP) are “unique agreements designed to
encourage, assist, and recognize partner efforts to eliminate
serious hazards and enhance workplace safety and health
practices.”494 OSPPs are operated out of local OSHA Area or
Regional Offices. They focus on ways to improve safety and
health in major corporations, government agencies, at large
construction projects and private sector industries where
OSHA has jurisdiction.
8.2.3 Voluntary Protection Program
OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Programs (VPPs)495 are part￾nerships between management, labor, and OSHA at work￾places that have implemented and maintain an exemplary
comprehensive safety and health management programs.
VPP membership is OSHA’s official recognition of the
outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have
achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.496 VPP
procedures involve submission of a detailed application,
including detailed site injury and illness rates, a written
safety and health management program, commitment from
management and worker representatives, and a rigorous
on-site review by OSHA personnel and special govern￾ment employees (SGEs).497 VPP members represent nearly
all industrial classifications498 and have their own associa￾tion – the Voluntary Protection Programs Participants’ Asso￾ciation (VPPPA).499
8.2.4 OSHA Challenge Program
The OSHA Challenge Program assists employers to improve
their safety and health management programs through
mentoring, training and progress tracking. Challenge
participants do not receive exemptions from OSHA
programmed inspections.500
9 REGULATION OF OCCUPATIONAL
SAFETY AND HEALTH BY THE
STATES
One of the primary factors that induced Congress to enact
a comprehensive OSH Act was the failure of many of the
states to regulate workplace safety and health adequately.501
In passing the OSH Act, Congress hoped to ensure at least
a minimum level of protection for workers throughout the
country.
The OSH Act preempts a state’s occupational safety
or health standard with respect to a standard promulgated
by OSHA.502 However, OSHA does not totally ban the
states from developing and enforcing occupational safety and
health standards on their own. Pursuant to Section 18(b) of
the Act, a state may regain jurisdiction over development and
enforcement of occupational safety and health standards by
submitting to the federal government an effective State Occu￾pational Safety and Health Plan (“state plan”). Final approval
of a state plan can lead ultimately to exclusive authority by
a state over the matters included in its plan. The process
of regaining jurisdiction over the regulation of occupational
safety and health begins with the submission of a plan that
sets forth specific procedures for ensuring workers’ safety
and health. States can submit one of the two types of plans – a
complete plan or a developmental plan.
A “complete” plan”503 is a plan that, upon submission,
satisfies the criteria for plan approval set forth in Section
18(c) of the Act, as well as certain additional criteria outlined
by the Secretary in administrative regulations.504 Section
18(c) specifies the requirements a state must fulfill to receive
approval of its own occupational safety and health plan.505
Complete plans are given “initial” approval by the Secretary
upon submission. For at least 3 years following the “initial”
approval, the Secretary will monitor the state plan to deter￾mine whether the criteria set forth in Section 18(c) are being
applied. If this determination – as so-called Section 18(e)
determination – is favorable, the state plan will be granted
“final approval” and the state will regain exclusive jurisdic￾tion with respect to any occupational safety or health issue
covered by the state plan. Federal standards continue to apply
to hazards not covered by the state program.
A “developmental” plan506 is a plan that, upon submis￾sion, does not fully meet the criteria set forth in the statute
or in OSHA’s regulations. A developmental plan may
receive initial approval upon submission, however, if the
plan contains “satisfactory assurances” that the state will
take the necessary steps to bring its program into conformity
within three years following commencement of the plan’s
336OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
operation. If the developmental plan satisfies all the statutory
and administrative criteria within the three-year “develop￾mental period,” the Secretary will certify and will initiate
an evaluation of the actual operations of the state plan for
purposes of making a Section 18(e) determination. The
evaluation must proceed for at least one year before such a
determination can be made. Developmental plans that have
received final approval will continue to be monitored and
evaluated by the Secretary pursuant to Section 18(f) of the
Act, which authorizes the Secretary to withdraw approval if
a state fails to comply substantially with any provision of
the state’s plan.
Although a state does not regain exclusive jurisdiction
over matters contained in its plan until the plan receives final
approval, a state with initial plan approval may participate
in the administration and enforcement of the Act prior to
final approval by satisfying four criteria.507 First, the state
must have enacted enabling legislation conforming to that
specified in OSHA and the regulations. Second, the state
plan must contain standards that are found to be “at least
as effective as” the comparable federal standards, Third, the
state plan must provide for a sufficient number of qualified
personnel who will enforce the standards in accordance with
the state’s enabling legislation. Fourth, the plan’s provisions
for review of state citations and penalties (including the
appointment of the reviewing authority and the promulgation
of implementing regulations) must be in effect. If the criteria
above are met, the state plan is considered “operational.” The
federal government then enters into an operational agreement
with the state whereby the state is authorized to enforce
safety and health standards under the state plan.508
Most states that are presently operating approved and/or
certified plans have adopted standards that are substantially
similar, if not identical, to the federal standards. At least
five state plans, however, have standards that contain certain
provisions that vary from the federal standards, yet have been
approved as being “at least as effective” as the federal stan￾dards. The states are California, Hawaii, Michigan, Oregon,
and Washington. In some instances, these states have adopted
standards that are more stringent than the analogous federal
standards.
Early on, OSHA developed numerical staffing require￾ments for states, so-called staffing “benchmarks.” These
benchmarks were challenged by the AFL-CIO who
argued that the benchmarks were too low. In AFL-CIO
v. Marshall,
509 the court agreed with the AFL-CIO. The
court that, in referring to personnel and funding levels in
terms of adequacy and sufficiency, Congress intended that
states would have the resources “necessary to do the job”
and that “such interim federal benchmarks must be a part
of an articulated, coherent program calculated to achieve
a fully effective program at some point in the foreseeable
future.”510 On remand, the district court ordered OSHA in
1978 to develop a five-year schedule for each state to meet
the “fully effective” enforcement staffing levels and made
meeting the OSHA “benchmark” staffing schedule a prereq￾uisite for final state plan approval.511 Since Congress failed
to appropriate additional resources to meet the benchmark
staffing levels, the benchmarks have since lost much of their
impact.
10 REGULATION OF OCCUPATIONAL
SAFETY AND HEALTH BY OTHER
FEDERAL STATUTES
10.1 Partial Exemption from Coverage
by the OSH Act
Section 4(b)(1) of OSH Act states that “[N]othing in this
chapter shall apply to working conditions of employees with
respect to which other federal agencies, and State agen￾cies acting under Section 201 of Title 42,512 exercise statu￾tory authority to prescribe or enforce standards or regula￾tions affecting occupational safety and health.”513 Although
Section 4(b)(1) seems to be self-defining, it has generated
a significant amount of litigation. Three major interpretive
questions have been raised. First, what constitutes a suffi￾cient exercise of regulatory authority to preempt OSHA regu￾lation? Second, does the exercise of authority by another
federal agency in substantial areas of employee safety and
health exempt the entire industry from OSHA standards?
Third, must the other federal agency’s motivation in acting
have been to protect workers?
Exercise of Authority. The mere existence of statutory
authority to regulate safety or health is not sufficient to oust
OSHA’s regulatory scheme; some exercise of that authority
is necessary.514 Speculative pronouncements of proposed
regulations by a federal agency are not sufficient to warrant
preemption of OSHA standards; Section 4(b)(1) requires a
concrete exercise of statutory authority.515
Industrywide Exemption. Courts have also rejected the
notion that the exercise of statutory authority by another
federal agency creates an industry-wide exemption from
OSHA regulations. Rather, the courts have agreed that the
term “working conditions” in Section 4(b)(1) refers to some￾thing more limited than every aspect of an entire industry.
Working Conditions. Ambiguity remains, however, with
respect to the scope of the displacing effect of another
agency’s regulation of a “working conditions.” OSHA
understands the term “working conditions” to mean partic￾ular hazards, to which an employee may be exposed.516 First,
Second and Eleventh Circuits follow the OSHA “hazard”
approach. The Fourth Circuit defined “working conditions”
as “the environmental area in which an employee custom￾arily goes about his daily tasks.” In Southern Railway
Company, the Fourth circuit explained that OSHA would
337PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
be displaced when another federal agency had exercised its
statutory authority to prescribe standards affecting occu￾pational safety or health for such an area.517 In Southern
Pacific Transportation Company, the Fifth Circuit explained
that the term “working conditions” has a technical meaning
in the language of industrial relations; it encompasses both a
worker’s surroundings and the hazards incident to the work.
The court stated that the displacing effect of Section 4(b)(1)
would depend primarily on the agency’s articulation of its
regulations.518
Adequacy of the Other Agency’s Enforcement. How strin￾gent the other agency’s enforcement of their regulations is
not a consideration under Section 4(b)(1).519 Preemption
may still apply when the other agency’s regulations are not
as strong as OSHA’s regulations.520 Once the other agency’s
rule has been shown to have the effect of law, no further
inquiry into how well the agency enforces that rule will be
made.521
10.2 Selected Other Federal Agencies
Affecting Occupational Safety
and Health
10.2.1 Mine Safety and Health Administration
Occupational safety and health matters with respect to the
nation’s mining industry are regulated pursuant to the Federal
Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act).522 The
DOL established the Mine Safety and Health Administra￾tion (MSHA) to enforce the Mine Act. There are a number
of important differences between the Mine Act and the
OSH Act.
First, unlike the OSH Act which does not mandate inspec￾tion frequency, the Mine Act requires that MSHA inspect all
underground mines at least four time per year and all surface
mines at least twice a year. Further, MSHA does not require
a warrant to conduct nonconsensual mine inspections. The
purposes of these visits include determining whether an
imminent danger exists and whether there is compliance with
MSHA’s health and safety standards. Second, the Mine Act
permits MSHA to shut down coal or other mine operations
without a restraining order from a court. Section 107(a) of
the Mine Act provides that when a federal inspector finds
that an imminent danger is present in a mine, the inspector
shall order the withdrawal of all other persons from a part,
or all of that, mine until the imminent danger no longer
exists.523
Third, mine operators are required to abate a violation
immediately even if the mine operator challenges the citation
before the Mine Commission. Fourth, recordkeeping and
reporting requirements under the Mine Act are set forth
in subsections 103(c)–103(e) and 103(h). The Mine Act
contains a broad antiretaliation provision and grants other
rights to mine employees as well. For example, Section 111
of the Mine Act provides pay for miners who accompany an
MSHA inspector on an inspection. Section 107 also provides
pay when a MSHA issues a “withdrawal order,” requiring
the closure of a mine and removal of miners from the mine.
Fifth, the Mine Act, unlike the OSH Act, does not permit
state plans. A state may, however, enforce its own mine safety
and health laws if they consistent with or more stringent the
Mine Act of MSHA regulations and standards.524
Following a January 2006 explosion at the Sago Mine in
Sago, West Virginia, in which 12 trapped miners lost their
lives, the Mine Act was amended by the Mine Improvement
and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act of 2006.525
The MINER Act amended Section 316 of the Mine Act to
require mine operators to “carry out on a continuing basis
a program to improve accident preparedness and response
at each mine” and to “develop and adopt have a written
accident response plan.” The MINER Act also amended
Section 103(j) to require a mine operator to notify MSHA
“within 15 min” of the death or entrapment of any miner. The
MINER Act also increases the penalty for willfully violating
a mandatory health or safety standard, or knowingly refusing
to comply with any order issued under Sections 104 and
107, to $250 000 or imprisonment for not more than 1 year
or by both. The MINER Act also provided MSHA with the
authority to request an injunction to close a mine when the
mine operator refuses to pay a final civil penalty.
10.2.2 U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation
Board
In 1990, Congress created the Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board (CSB) to investigate the causes of any
accidental chemical release resulting in a death or substantial
property damage.526 Despite overlap between the investiga￾tion authority of OSHA and the CSB, the CSB’s reports focus
on the root causes and often recommend changes in existing
standards, or a new standard, to OSHA, EPA, NIOSH, and
other federal agencies. Findings contained in the CSB’s
Reports may be admitted as evidence in a civil action arising
from the investigated accident.527 The CSB maintains a file
of its current and completed investigation reports on its Web
site.528
10.2.3 Nuclear Regulatory Commission
OSHA has published occupational health and safety
standards regulating exposure to ionizing radiation (i.e.
alpha, beta, gamma, X-ray, and neutron) and nonion￾izing (i.e. radiofrequency and electromagnetic) radiation
for the General Industry, Shipyard Employment, and
Construction.529 However, the primary federal law regu￾lating human exposure to radiation is not the OSH Act, but
is the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.530 Under the Act, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) can promulgate
338OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
regulations about the safety of employees exposed to, or
working with, nuclear materials.”531
Any person holding a license issued under the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954 and using “licensed material” (i.e.
radioactive or radiation-emitting material) may not permit
the exposure of individuals within a “restricted area” (i.e. an
area in which radioactive materials are being used) to greater
doses of radiation than are set forth in the regulations.532
Although the primary thrust of the NRC regulations is to
control ionizing radiation within the “restricted area,” the
NRC has also published regulations on permissible levels of
radiation in unrestricted areas, in effluents discharged into
unrestricted areas, and for the disposal of radioactive mate￾rials by release into sanitary sewerage systems.533 The EPA
Administrator, exercising authority under the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, has also promulgated regulations limiting expo￾sure of the general population to ionizing radiation produced
during the operation of nuclear power plants licensed by the
NRC.534
There are additional federal agencies empowered to set
standards for ionizing radiation control within areas under
their jurisdiction. The DOL, for example, has promulgated
regulations regarding radiation exposure in underground
mines.535 The DOL has also issued radiation standards for
uranium mining conducted under the Walsh–Healey Public
Contracts Act.536 Radiation generated by devices and prod￾ucts that are not governed by the Atomic Energy Act and
licensed by the NRC is regulated by the federal Radiation
Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968.537 OSHA and the
NRC established a Memorandum of Understanding in 1989
to govern mutual activities.538
10.2.4 Consumer Product Safety Commission
The Consumer Product Safety Act of 1972 created a
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and empow￾ered it to promulgate “consumer product safety standards”
applicable to consumer products found to present an unrea￾sonable risk of injury. Under authority granted to it by
the Federal Hazardous Substances Act,539 the CPSC may
find that a substance distributed in interstate commerce
is “hazardous.” The CPSC may impose packaging and
labeling requirements to protect public health and safety
or – in the cases of hazardous substances intended for the use
of children or likely to be subject to access by children, or
substances intended for household use – prohibit distribution
altogether (“banned hazardous substance”).540 Insofar as
safety in the workplace, the effect of the Federal Hazardous
Substances Act is that hazardous substances distributed in
interstate commerce and utilized by the U.S. worker will
arrive safely packaged and accompanied by appropriate
warnings. The CPSC does not have authority to regulate
consumer product risk if such risk could be addressed by
OSHA.541
10.2.5 Environmental Protection Agency
Under Section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act, when the EPA issues
regulations that cover the same working conditions and
employee safety as OSHA standards and regulations cover,
the EPA regulations may preempt OSHA regulations, but
only as applied to EPA regulations under the Federal Insecti￾cide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Under other
EPA statutes concerning waste disposal, toxic substances,
air, and water, the relevant statute specifically provides that
actions taken by EPA have no preemptive effect under the
OSH Act.542
Under the FIFRA (also known as the Environmental Pesti￾cide Act),543 EPA has the authority to regulate the use
of pesticides and makes misuse of pesticides civilly and
criminally punishable. The D.C. Circuit has held that the
FIFRA authorizes EPA to promulgate and enforce occu￾pational health and safety standards with respect to farm
workers’ exposure to pesticides,544 and EPA has exercised
that authority.545 In EPA’s regulations concerning pesticide
use, there are standards pertaining to pesticide exposure in
the workplace.546 OSHA is thus preempted from regulating
in that area.
The Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to promulgate emission
control standards and to inspect workplaces to see that its
standards are being met.547 EPA has promulgated regulations
designed to protect workers, among others, from accidental
chemical releases. Under a final rule published by EPA in
1996, nearly 70 000 facilities that manufacture or handle
certain hazardous chemicals were required to develop risk
management plans by June 1999 to reduce the likelihood and
severity of accidental chemical releases.548 However, Section
7412(r)(7)(D) requires EPA to consult with the Secretary
before promulgating regulations pertaining to prevention of
accidental releases.
The Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know
Act,549 also known as Title III of the SARA of 1986, requires
the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations to protect workers
at hazardous waste sites and during emergency response
operations. In 1990, OSHA issued a hazardous waste oper￾ations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) standard.550
In 1994, OSHA published a nonmandatory appendix to the
HAZWOPER standard for the certification and accredita￾tion of training programs for workers handling hazardous
materials.551 The requirements of the Emergency Planning
and Community-Right-to-Know Act do not preempt OSHA
standards.552
The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA)
established a broad, nationwide program for the federal
regulation of the manufacture and distribution of toxic
substances.553 TSCA authorizes EPA to regulate the manu￾facture, processing, distribution, use, and disposal of
chemical substances and mixtures of chemical substances.
If EPA determines that a substance poses an unreasonable
339PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
risk to health or the environment, EPA may prohibit the
manufacture or sale of the chemical or may adopt rules
regulating its use. Actions taken by EPA under TSCA do not
preempt actions OSHA takes under the OSH Act.554
In 2016, the TSCA of 1976 was amended by the Frank
Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.
555
The new law received bipartisan support in both the U.S.
House of Representatives and the Senate. Amended TSCA
includes: (i) a mandatory requirement for EPA to evaluate
existing chemicals with clear and enforceable deadlines;
(ii) new risk-based safety standard; (iii) increased public
transparency for chemical information; and (iv) consistent
source of funding for EPA to carry out the responsibilities
under the new law. In addition, the word “workers” is now
included in the definition of “potentially exposed or suscep￾tible subpopulation.”556
10.2.6 Department of Transportation
The Department of Transportation (DOT) protects
employees under a number of federal laws pertaining to
aviation,557 railways,558 motor carriers,559 and pipelines.560
The DOT has issued regulations concerning employee safety
in each of these areas.
Aviation. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (as amended)
authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to
promote safety of flight of civil aircraft in air commerce,561
as well as to establish minimum safety standards for the
operation of airports that serve any scheduled or unscheduled
passenger operation of air carrier aircraft designed for more
than 30 passenger seats.562 It is generally accepted that FAA
jurisdiction extends only to flight-crew members (pilots and
flight attendants), not to ground personnel.
Railways. The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 autho￾rizes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), an agency
within the DOT, to promulgate regulations for all areas of
railroad safety, including employee safety. To date, however,
the DOT has not adopted railroad occupational safety stan￾dards for all railroad working conditions or workplaces.
OSHA retains jurisdiction over safety and health of railroad
employees with respect to those “working conditions” for
which the DOT has not adopted standards.
Motor Carriers. Motor carriers are regulated by the DOT
through the Motor Carrier Act of 1984.563 Even though
the DOT has promulgated regulations for commercial motor
vehicle worker protection with regard to step, handhold and
deck requirements,564 motor vehicle common carriers are
still subject to OSHA standards in areas where the DOT has
not specifically regulated.565
Pipelines. The Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of
1968 (NGPSA) authorizes the DOT Secretary to establish
minimum federal safety standards for pipeline facilities and
the transportation of gas in commerce. DOT’s authority
under NGPSA preempts OSHA rules. In Texas Eastern
Transmission Corp.,566 the Review Commission determined
that the DOT’s minimal federal safety standards regarding
working conditions preempted OSHA standards regarding
working conditions that were the subject of the alleged
violations. However, a contractor engaged in repairing a
pipeline would be subject to OSHA standards because
NGPSA standards apply only to persons engaged in gas
transport or operation of pipeline facilities.567
11 FUTURE OF OCCUPATIONAL
SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
After nearly 50 years, the OSH Act still enjoys broad support
among stakeholders despite continuing concerns about the
pace of standards development. The slower pace of OSHA’s
development of occupational safety and health standards, and
the obsolescence of many existing OSHA PELs heighten the
influence of international consensus standards. In the twenty￾first century, international standards may play a bigger role
in determining multinational employer actions than national
governmental laws and regulations. What impact the realities
of the twenty-first century’s global economy will have on the
OSH Act remains to be seen. What is certain is that many
of legal and policy issues arising from the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 will undoubtedly continue to
occupy the attention of stakeholders, Congress, OSHA, the
Review Commission, and the federal courts for many years
yet to come.

22 An “established federal standard” is defined in 29
U.S.C. § 652(10) as “any operative occupational safety
and health standard established by any agency of the
United States and presently in effect, or contained in
any act of Congress in force on the date of enactment
of this Act.” 29 U.S.C. 653(b)(2) of the OSH Act listed
several federal statutes from which established federal
standards were to be derived, including, but not limited
to, the Walsh–Healey Act (41 U.S.C. §§ 35–45), the
Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. §§ 351–357),
and the National Foundation on Arts and Humanities
Act (20 U.S.C. §§ 951–960).
23 A “national consensus” standard is defined in 29 U.S.C.
§ 652(9) of the OSH Act as any occupational safety
and health standard, which “(1) has been adopted and
promulgated by a nationally recognized standards
producing organization under procedures, whereby
it can be determined by the Secretary that persons
interested and affected by the scope or provisions of
the standard have reached substantial agreement on
its adoption, (2) was formulated in a manner which
afforded an opportunity for diverse views to be consid￾ered, and (3) has been designated as such a standard by
the Secretary, after consultation with other appropriate
federal agencies.” The principal sources for national
consensus standards were the American National Stan￾dards Institute (ANSI) and the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA). American Federation of Labor

25 The courts have held that OSHA does not have the
right to change advisory national consensus standards
(“should”) to mandatory standards (“shall”) upon
adoption as OSHA standards without following formal
rulemaking procedures. Absent such rulemaking, cita￾tions issued to employers pursuant to these standards
have been vacated. Usery v. Kennecott Copper Corp.,

Section 3(8) [29 U.S.C. § 652(8)] states “The term
‘occupational safety and health standard’ means a stan￾dard which requires conditions, or the adoption or
use of one or more practices, means, methods, oper￾ations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appro￾priate to provide safe or healthful employment and
places of employment” (emphasis added). For stan￾dards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical
agents, Section 6(b)(5) [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5)], imposes
the following additional requirements: “The Secretary,
in promulgating standards dealing with toxic mate￾rials or harmful physical agents under this subsection,
shall set the standard which most adequately assures,
to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best avail￾able evidence, that no employee will suffer material
impairment of health or functional capacity, even if
such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt
with by such standard for the period of his working life”

74 An employer’s general duty to provide a safe work￾place may not necessarily be discharged simply by
the employer’s compliance with specific OSHA stan￾dards. In UAW v. General Dynamics, 815 F.2d 1570,
1577, 13 OSH Cases 1201, 1206-07 (D.C. Cir.), cert.
denied, 484 U.S. 976 (1987), the court stated [I]f … an
employer knows a particular safety standard is inade￾quate to protect his workers against the specific hazard
it is intended to address, or that the conditions in his
place of employment are such that the safety standard
will not adequately deal with the hazards to which his
employees are exposed, he has a duty under section
5(a)(1) to take whatever measures may be required by
the OSH Act, over and above those mandated by the
safety standard, to safeguard his workers. In sum, if an
employer knows that a specific standard will not protect
his workers against a particular hazard, his duty under
section 5(a)(1) will not be discharged no matter how
faithfully he observes that standard.”

87 Health and safety standards promulgated by the Secre￾tary pursuant to OSH Act can be found at 29 C.F.R.
Part 1910. Federal health and safety standards for
the construction industry were initially promulgated
under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards
Act, 40 U.S.C. § 327 et seq. These standards were
incorporated by reference under the OSH Act, are
enforceable under both laws, and can be found at 29
C.F.R. Part 1926. Health and safety standards for ship
repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and longshoring
were initially promulgated pursuant to the Longshore
and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.
§ 901. These standards were incorporated by refer￾ence under the OSH Act, are enforceable under both
laws, and can be found in 29 C.F.R. Parts 1915 and
1918. Health and safety standards originally promul￾gated under the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act,
the McNamara–O’Hara Service Contract Act of 1965,
and the National Foundation on the Arts and Humani￾ties Act of 1965 can be found in 41 C.F.R. Part 50-204,
29 C.F.R. Part 1516, and 20 C.F.R. Part 505. These
were adopted and are enforceable by OSHA. Standards
promulgated under the aforementioned statutes will be
superseded if corresponding standards that are promul￾gated under the OSH Act are determined by the Secre￾tary to be more effective. See 29 U.S.C § 653.
88 For a listing of the initial package of national consensus
and established federal standards, see 36 Fed. Reg.
10,466 (1971).
89 In 1995, OSHA pledged to eliminate over 1000 of
the over 3000 pages dedicated to the agency in the
Code of Federal Regulations. Most of the standards
to be done away with were included in 29 C.F.R. §
1910, which sets job safety and health provisions for
general industry, and OSHA pledged also to revise and
simplify the 1971 consensus standards. On March 7,
1996, OSHA published a final rule characterized as a
“down payment” on OSHA’s pledge and eliminated
275 of OSHA pages in the Code of Federal Regula￾tions. See 61 Fed. Reg. 9228 (March 7, 1996).
90 TLVs had been developed principally in 1968 by the
American Conference of Governmental Industrial
Hygienists (ACGIH) and were subsequently incor￾porated into the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act.

not include the ACGIH’s carcinogen standards in his
Section 6(a) package, but instead preferred to develop
his own standards regarding carcinogens.
91 54 Fed. Reg. 2332 (January 19, 1989). OSHA defines
hundreds of air contaminants in three tables (Tables Z￾1, Z-2, and Z-3 of 29 C.F.R. 1910.1000; often called
the “Z Lists”).
92 The PELs established by OSHA can be found at
29 C.F.R. § 1910.1000, Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3.
Pursuant to a January 1989 rulemaking, OSHA made
212 PELs more protective, established 162 new PELs
for previously unregulated substances, and left other
PELs unchanged. In doing so, OSHA stated that it
relied heavily on the widely accepted 1987–1988 TLVs
published by ACGIH and the recommended exposure
limits (RELs) developed by the NIOSH. 54 Fed. Reg.
2332, 2333–35 (January 19, 1989).
93 AFL-CIO v. OSHA, 965 F.2d 962, 15 OSH Cases 1729

94 OSHA formally revoked the 1989 PELs in June 1993
with publication of a notice at 58 Fed. Reg. 35,338
(June 30, 1993). In so doing, OSHA republished the
less stringent limits that were in effect prior to 1989.

of the two-fiber standard and (2) the standard’s record￾keeping provision. However, OSHA took no action and
the standard with the lower PEL went into effect in
1976.

provisions in 29 C.F.R. Part 1910, the general industry
asbestos standard, remained unchanged.
111 43 Fed. Reg. 5918 (1978). OSHA based its reasoning
on its carcinogen policy that mandated that OSHA set a
PEL for a carcinogen at the lowest feasible level in the
absence of any evidence that a higher level was safe.

116 The 1 ppm limit is identical to that set in the 1978 stan￾dard. The 1987 standard, however, is followed by a risk
assessment analysis from which OSHA determined the
benzene level that posed a significant risk. The 1978
standard was based on a feasibility determination after
OSHA simply assumed that no level of benzene expo￾sure would be safe for humans. 43 Fed. Reg. 5918,

206 The historical OSHA PEL was derived by assessing
percent quartz in a respirable dust sample and using
345PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
the following arithmetical formula: PEL = 10 divided
by the sum 2 + percent quartz in the sample. The
measured concentration of respirable dust is then
compared against the computed PEL to determine
compliance. If the respirable quartz is pure quartz
(100%), the formula will result in a PEL of approxi￾mately 0.1 mg m−3. 207 In 1974, NIOSH originally recommended setting a
0.05 mg/m3 exposure limit. See NIOSH, Criteria for
a Recommended Standard for Occupational Expo￾sure to Crystalline Silica, DHEW (NIOSH) Pub. No.
75–120. In recommending the limit, NIOSH stated that
“[U]ntil improved sampling and analytical methods
are developed for respirable crystalline silica, NIOSH
will continue to recommend an exposure limit of
0.05 mg m−3 to reduce the risk of developing silicosis,
lung cancer, and other adverse health effects. NIOSH
also recommends minimizing the risk of illness that
remains for workers exposed at the REL by substituting
less hazardous materials for crystalline silica when
feasible, by using appropriate respiratory protection
when source controls cannot keep exposures below
the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit, and by
making medical examinations available to exposed
workers.”

Jim Stanley to Field Staff, “Employer Obligation to

employer must both provide and pay for the required
PPE, except in limited situations. The memorandum
stated that where PPE is very personal in nature and
used by the employee off the job, such as is often
the case with steel-toe safety shoes (but not metatarsal
foot protection), the issue of payment may be left to
labor–management negotiations.

Co. v. Henry, Slip Copy, 2007 WL 2908879 (N.D.
Okla.), the court expressed serious concern about
criminal laws depriving employer property owners
from their right to exclude those workers and other
individuals from carrying and transporting firearms
in their vehicles and decided that such state laws
impermissibly conflicts with the Occupational Safety
and Health Act “which requires employers to abate
hazards in their workplaces that could lead to death or
serious bodily harm and which encourages employers
to prevent gun-related workplace injuries.” See page

316 29 U.S.C. § 673(a).
317 OSHA’s recordkeeping and reporting regulations were
challenged as vague, but the Review Commission
found them to have been validly promulgated and
dismissed the vagueness challenge. General Dynamics
Corp. Elec. Boat Div., Quonset Point Facility, 16 OSH
Cases 1717 (Rev. Comm’n J. 1994).
318 29 C.F.R. §§ 1904.20–1904.21. In addition, since 1996,
OSHA has conducted an annual survey that requires
about 80,000 employers to submit injury and illness
records directly to OSHA. The regulation creating this
annual survey (29 C.F.R. § 1904.17) was invalidated
by a federal district court in American Trucking Asso￾ciations v. Secretary of Labor, 17 OSH Cases 1881,
955 F. Supp. 4 (D.C.D.C. 1997), and OSHA responded
by promulgating a final rule to preserve its authority
to collect the survey (62 Fed. Reg. 6434 (February 11,
1997)).
319 66 Fed. Reg. 5916 (January 19, 2001) (codified as 29
C.F.R. Part 1904).
320 In 29 C.F.R. § 1904.12(c), the Secretary has defined
“recordable occupational injuries or illnesses” as those
that result in: (1) fatalities, regardless of the time
between the injury and death, or the length of the
illness; (2) lost workday cases, other than fatalities, that
result in lost workdays; or (3) nonfatal cases without
lost workdays, which result in transfer to another job
or termination of employment, or require medical treat￾ment (other than first aid) or involve: loss of conscious￾ness or restriction of work or motion. This category also
includes any diagnosed occupational illnesses that are
reported to the employer but are not classified as fatali￾ties or lost workday cases. Employers should resolve
doubts about whether an injury is recordable – e.g.,
because it is unclear whether an injury required first
aid or medical treatment or whether the injury is occu￾pationally related – in favor of recording. See, e.g.,
General Motors Corp., Inland Div., 8 OSH Cases 2036
(Rev. Comm’n 1980); General Motors Corp. Ware￾housing and Distribution Division, 10 OSH Cases 1844
(Rev. Comm’n 1982).
321 29 C.F.R. § 1904.6. Effective January 1, 1991, the
responsibility for establishing recordkeeping require￾ments for occupational illnesses and injuries was trans￾ferred from the BLS in DOL to OSHA and its newly
created Office of Recordkeeping and Data Analysis.

342 29 U.S.C. § 655(f).
343 The test for determining what is a standard and what is
a regulation was first announced in a case Louisiana
Chemical Ass’n v. Bingham, 657 F.2d 777, 10 OSH
Cases 1017 (Fifth Cir. 1981) (holding that OSHA’s
Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records
rule was a regulation not a standard). The court stated
that a “standard [is] a remedial measure addressed to
a specific and already identified hazard, not a purely
administrative effort designed to uncover violations
of the Act and discover unknown dangers. In short,
standards should aim toward correction rather than
mere inquiry into possible hazards.” Id. at 782. The
Third Circuit followed this reasoning when they ruled
that OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard was a
standard not a regulation. See United Steelworkers v.
Auchter, 763 F.2d 728, 12 OSH Cases 1337 (Third Cir.
1985).
344 Fellner and Savelson (8). This approach has been
summarized as one requiring the reviewing court to
determine whether the agency (1) acted within the
scope of its authority; (2) followed the procedures
required by statute and by its own regulations; (3)
explicated the bases for its decision; and (4) adduced
substantial evidence in the record to support its deter￾mination. United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO,
v. Marshall and Bingham, 647 F.2d 1189, 1206, 8 OSH

352 S. A. Healy v. Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission, 18 OSH Cases 1193 (Seventh Cir. 1998).
The Seventh Circuit’s decision was a reversal of its
previous holding on the matter, which was vacated
by the Supreme Court. On remand from the Supreme
Court, the Seventh Circuit held that the administrative
penalty was “civil” rather than “criminal” and thus
did not constitute a separate criminal proceeding for
purposes of double jeopardy.
353 Secretary of Labor v. Andrew Catapano Enterprises,
Inc., 17 OSH Cases 1776 (Rev. Comm’n 1996). In
this case, the employer argued that all the nine trench
sites should have been treated as a single workplace
and the violations thus treated as a single case, but the
Commission ruled that it was within OSHA’s discre￾tion to prosecute the violations at each trench site as a
separate case.

355 See OSHA Field Operations Manual, Chapter 2, V.
356 29 U.S.C. § 657(a)(1) & (2).
357 436 U.S. 307, 6 OSH Cases 1571 (1978).
358 In contrast, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the
constitutionality of warrantless inspections of stone
quarries under the Federal Mine Safety and Health
Act of 1977 because mining has long been a perva￾sively regulated industry, in which a businessperson
can have no reasonable expectation of privacy against
official inspections. In Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S.
594 (1981), the Court reasoned further that the Federal
Mine Safety and Health Act inspection provisions are
more narrowly drawn and provide for less admin￾istrative discretion concerning inspections than does
OSHA, thus making such inspections reasonable under
the Fourth Amendment.

the desired frequency of searches in any of the lesser
divisions of the area …” 6 OSH Cases at 1576.

362 A general contractor can consent to OSHA’s inspection
of a construction work site at which many employers
work. J.L. Foti Constr. Co. v. Donovan, 786 F.2d 714,

962 (1998) (holding that work site videotaping not
only does not violate the OSH Act but also does
349PATTY’S INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
not violate the Fourth Amendment’s right to privacy
because the employer “left the construction site open
to observation from vantages outside its control.”). The
Seventh Circuit has also held that it is not unreason￾able for an inspection warrant to allow videotaping
of the workplace. In re Establishment Inspection of
Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., Seventh Cir., No. 93-1082,

368 The new regulation, held valid by the court in Donovan
v. Blue Ridge Pressure Castings, Inc., 543 F. Supp. 53,
10 OSH Cases 1217 (M.D. Pa. 1981), states “(d) For
purposes of this section, the term compulsory process
shall mean the institution of any appropriate action,
including ex parte application for an inspection warrant
or its equivalent. Ex parte inspection warrants shall be
the preferred form of compulsory process in all circum￾stances where compulsory process is relied upon to
seek entry to a workplace under this section.” See 29

369 610 F.2d 1128, 1135–1136, 7 OSH Cases 1880,
1884 (Third Cir. 1979). An employer’s right to a
pre-inspection hearing in federal court on a warrant’s
validity was reaffirmed by the Third Circuit in Cerro
Metal Products v. Marshall (holding an employer
could bring an action in district court, prior to inspec￾tion, seeking to enjoin OSHA from obtaining an ex
parte warrant). The Seventh Circuit has also held an
employer may raise a pre-inspection warrant challenge
in district court under limited circumstances. See
Blocksom & Co. v. Marshall, 582 F.2d 1122, 6 OSH
Cases 1865 (Seventh Cir. 1978) (employer may raise

380 The Review Commission has held that this 6-month
limitation period does not apply if the Secretary’s
inability to discover the violation was caused by the
employer’s failure to report a fatal accident as the
Secretary’s regulations require (29 C.F.R. § 1904.8).
The Review Commission reasoned that allowing an
employer to escape a citation because of its own failure
to comply with OSHA’s reporting requirements would
reward it for its own wrongdoing. Yelvington Welding
Service, 6 OSH Cases 2013 (Rev. Comm’n. 1978).
The Review Commission has held that OSHA may
issue a citation for an alleged violation even though it
may have had the opportunity during an earlier inspec￾tion to discover the same alleged violation and cite
it—the holding was based on the idea that the purpose
of Section 9(c) is simply to ensure that violations are
prosecuted while events are still relatively fresh and
that this purpose is not compromised so long as the
subsequent violative conduct is prosecuted within six
months. Secretary of Labor v. Safeway Store No. 914,
16 OSH Cases 1504 (Rev. Comm’n. 1993); Johnson
Controls, Inc., 15 OSH Cases 2132, 2135–2136 (Rev.

385 The employer must post notice of OSHA citations at
or near the place of the violation immediately upon
receipt of the notice (29 C.F.R. §§ 1903.14 & 1903.16).
If it is not possible to post the notice of citation at
the violation site, employers must post it in a “promi￾nent place where it will be readily observable by all
affected employees” (29 C.F.R. § 1903.16(a)). If the
employer settles with OSHA (to reduce the fines), a
notice of settlement must also be posted (29 C.F.R. §
2200.100(c)).
386 Penalties are prescribed by 29 U.S.C. § 666. Appli￾cable regulations on proposed penalties are found at
29 C.F.R. § 1903.15. In addition to the gravity of the
violation, the size of the business, the employer’s good
faith, and the employer’s history of previous violations
are also taken into account in determining the amount
of the proposed penalty. See 29 C.F.R. § 1903.15(b).

393 In determining whether a violation is serious or other￾than-serious, the Commission has held that a number of
other-than-serious violations may be grouped together
to form a serious violation if the cumulative effect of
the violations could result in an accident causing death
or serious injury. See H. A. S. & Associates, 4 OSH
Cases 1894, 1897–1898 (Rev. Comm’n 1976). When
the violation poses a risk of illness through cumula￾tive exposure to a toxic substance, the relevant question
is whether the Secretary can show a substantial prob￾ability of serious harm resulting from the degree and
length of actual employee exposure. Bethlehem Steel

442 The Review Commission’s Rules of Procedure can be

an area of procedure where the Commission has not
promulgated a rule, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
applies. See 19 C.F.R. § 2200.2(b).
443 Despite the requirements of OSH Act Section 10(a), the
Review Commission may (in limited circumstances)
entertain a late notice of contest pursuant to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). This rule permits a
federal court to grant relief from a final order for
a number of reasons, including a party’s mistake,
surprise or excusable neglect, the presence of newly
discovered evidence, and the fraud or misconduct of an
adverse party. Rule 60(b), which was held applicable
352OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW
to the Review Commission by the Third Circuit in J.
I. Hass Co. v. OSHRC, 648 F.2d 190, 9 OSH Cases
1712 (Third Cir. 1981), has been viewed by the Review

455 The Review Commission’s failure to adequately
consider these statutory penalty assessment factors
can result in a court of appeals remanding the case
to the Commission for more particularized findings
regarding the penalty. Astra Pharmaceutical Products,
Inc. v. OSHRC and Donovan, 681 F.2d 69, 10 OSH
Cases 1697 (First Cir. 1982).

1372 (Eighth Cir. 1973). Reduction of the Secretary’s
proposed penalty is also a matter within the Commis￾sion’s discretion. Western Waterproofing Co., Inc. v.
Marshall and OSHRC.
457 Secretary of Labor v. Hern Iron Works, Inc., 16 OSH
Cases 1619 (Rev. Comm’n 1994).
458 California Stevedore & Ballast Co. v. OSHRC, 517
F.2d 986, 3 OSH Cases 1174 (Ninth Cir. 1975).
459 See, e.g., Dixie Roofing and Metal Co., 2 OSH Cases
1566 (Rev. Comm’n 1975). See also Consolidated Rail
Corp., 10 OSH Cases 1564, 1568 (Rev. Comm’n 1982),
in which the Commission reduced the degree of a
violation from serious to other-than-serious without
specifically discussing its authority to do so. Federal
appeals courts have upheld the Commission’s authority
to downgrade nonserious violations to de minimis
status. See, e.g., Secretary of Labor v. OSHRC and Erie
Coke Corp., 16 OSH Cases 1241, 998 F.2d 134 (Third
Cir. 1993) (noting that the Commission had exercised
this authority for over 20 years and that ruling in favor
of the Secretary would create an “undesirable intercir￾cuit conflict”). The distinction between a “nonserious”
violation and a de minimis one is important because
a “non-serious” designation requires the employer to
cease the violative practice, while a de minimis desig￾nation does not.

461 29 C.F.R. § 2200.34(b)(4).
462 Petitions for review of a Commission Order must be
