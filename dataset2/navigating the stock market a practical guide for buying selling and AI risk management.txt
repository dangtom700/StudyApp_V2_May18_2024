BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR STOCK MARKET 
INVESTING
In this section, aspiring investors will discover the fundamental principles 
and essential prerequisites, laying a solid foundation for navigating the 
complexities of the stock market with confidence and strategic insight.
Understand the Difference Between Saving and Investing
Understanding the key distinction between saving and investing is essential 
for making informed financial decisions. When individuals opt to save their 
money in a traditional savings account, they typically earn a fixed rate of 
return. While this approach offers the benefit of security and the assurance 
that the funds will not be subjected to significant risk, it comes with the 
drawback of very low interest rates. Over time, the saved funds do not expe￾rience any substantial growth or appreciation. In contrast, when individuals 
choose to invest their money, the returns they receive are contingent on 
the price appreciation or depreciation of their chosen investment vehicles. 
Investing inherently carries a degree of risk, and it is crucial to grasp the 
fundamental concept that higher potential rewards are often associated 
with higher levels of risk. This recognition is particularly pertinent when 
contemplating ventures into the stock market, where the potential for sub￾stantial returns comes with the inherent volatility of the market.
It is important to note that even a seemingly modest increase in 
the rate of return, such as 1%–2%, can have a significant impact on the 
growth of an investment over time in comparison to a traditional savings 
Planning, Research, and
Screening

account. For instance, consider a $10,000 investment that yields a 2% 
higher return, for example 10% instead of 8%. Over a 30-year period, this 
seemingly small difference can translate into more than $73,000 in addi￾tional returns. This highlights the potential for investing to substantially 
outpace traditional savings in terms of wealth accumulation over the long 
term. Therefore, individuals must weigh the trade-offs between the safety 
of saving and the growth potential of investing when making financial 
decisions that align with their risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. 
Being Too Conservative Can Be Risky
Over the course of history, it has become evident that an overly con￾servative approach to investments can entail its own set of risks. Since 
1926, stocks have consistently outperformed the inflation rate, exhibit￾ing a significant advantage over fixed-income investments. This historical 
data underscores a key principle: the greater the short-term volatility an 
investment exhibits, the more potential it has to outpace the rate of infla￾tion over an extended period. While stock market investments may exhibit 
short-term fluctuations and volatility, they have demonstrated their abil￾ity to not only keep pace with inflation, but to outperform both inflation 
and fixed income securities in the long run. Consequently, considering 
the long-term implications of inflation and the uncertainty surrounding 
future financial needs, excessively conservative investment strategies may 
prove riskier than they initially appear.
In essence, an overly conservative investment approach can lead to 
the erosion of purchasing power over time, particularly in the face of infla￾tion. As the cost of living gradually rises, investments that fail to yield 
returns that outstrip inflation can inadvertently diminish the real value of 
one’s savings. In contrast, a judicious allocation of assets that includes a 
balanced exposure to stocks can serve as a hedge against inflation, ensuring 
that the growth of investments keeps pace with, and potentially exceeds, 
the rising cost of goods and services over the long term. Therefore, it is 
essential for investors to consider not only the short-term volatility but 
also the long-term potential for wealth preservation when making invest￾ment decisions, avoiding the pitfall of being excessively conservative to 
safeguard their financial future.
The Need to Believe in the Stock Market
Investing in the stock market is a decision that should be underpinned 
by a fundamental belief in its potential to generate superior returns. This 
belief forms the cornerstone of a successful investment strategy because it 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 2 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 3
is essential to have confidence in the market’s ability to deliver long-term 
financial growth, even in the face of inherent risks. Believing in the stock 
market means understanding that it can provide substantial rewards, but 
it requires a commitment to serious investment and a willingness to navi￾gate the associated uncertainties. If you harbor doubts or lack the dedica￾tion to dedicate time and effort to your investments, it may be prudent to 
steer clear of the stock market.
In such circumstances, there are alternative avenues available. You 
can consider entrusting your funds to a mutual fund or a professional 
money management company. These entities are staffed with experi￾enced professionals who can manage your investments on your behalf, 
helping you benefit from the potential of the stock market without hav￾ing to actively engage in the investment process. While it is crucial to 
believe in the stock market to invest directly, partnering with these finan￾cial institutions can offer a more hands-off approach, providing you with 
the opportunity to benefit from the market’s potential while leaving the 
intricacies of investment management to experts. Ultimately, the decision 
hinges on your level of conviction, commitment, and your personal finan￾cial goals.
Should You Invest in Stocks or Stay Away From Them?
Investing in stocks or staying away from them should be a decision tai￾lored to individual financial circumstances and objectives. Two distinct 
groups of individuals can benefit from or should consider avoiding stock 
market investments. The first group comprises those individuals who are 
in the process of building capital. For these individuals, whose savings 
tend to grow slowly, the primary objectives revolve around not only facili￾tating the growth of their savings but also protecting their capital from the 
erosive effects of inflation, which can gradually erode its value over time. 
By venturing into the stock market, they aim to harness the potential for 
higher returns that can outpace inflation, thus ensuring that their accu￾mulated wealth maintains or increases its real value over time.
Conversely, the other group of individuals who should carefully con￾sider minimizing their exposure to stocks or even staying away from them 
entirely are those who cannot afford to risk their capital, require access to 
funds in the near term, or are closer to retirement age. This group encom￾passes individuals who have already accumulated capital and are primar￾ily concerned with preserving their wealth from the corrosive impact of 
inflation, rather than aggressively pursuing substantial growth. Those in 
or nearing retirement often prioritize capital preservation and immediate 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 3 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM4 • Navigating the Stock Market
liquidity to meet their financial needs and lifestyle, making them less 
suited for the inherent volatility of the stock market. Thus, understanding 
one’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and stage of life is pivotal in deter￾mining whether to embrace stock market investments or opt for more 
conservative financial strategies.
Appreciate the Power of Compounding
Understanding and appreciating the power of compounding is a funda￾mental principle in the realm of finance that can have a profound impact 
on the accumulation of capital over time. Even a relatively small variance 
in the compound rate can lead to significant differences in the growth of 
investments. This concept becomes particularly evident when considering 
the performance of stocks. For instance, if an individual invests in a stock 
with an annual compound growth rate of 12%, that stock will double in 
value in just six years. In contrast, a stock growing at a more modest rate of 
8% will take nine years to double in value. This simple illustration under￾scores the importance of selecting investments that exhibit above-average 
growth rates for investors seeking high returns through capital gains.
It is worth noting that while growth stocks have the potential to be 
more profitable than income-generating stocks, they also come with a 
higher degree of risk and volatility. Investors aiming for substantial returns 
should weigh the potential benefits of investing in growth stocks against the 
increased level of risk associated with them. The choice between growth 
and income-generating stocks should be aligned with an individual’s risk 
tolerance, investment horizon, and financial objectives. Acknowledging 
the power of compounding and the relationship between growth rates 
and investment outcomes is crucial for making informed investment deci￾sions that can foster the long-term accumulation of capital.
Use the Rule of 72 Tool
The “rule of 72” is a valuable tool in the world of finance that provides a 
quick and easy method to estimate the time it takes for an investment to 
double in value based on its expected rate of return. This rule is particu￾larly helpful for investors to gauge the potential growth of their invest￾ments over time. The rule of 72 is applied by dividing the number 72 by 
the anticipated annual rate of return for the investment. For example, 
let’s consider an investment that is projected to grow at a 4% annual rate. 
By performing the calculation of 72 divided by 4, the result is 18, which 
signifies that it will take eighteen years for the investment to double at the 
4% rate of return. In the case of a more robust rate of return, such as 8%, 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 4 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 5
the rule of 72 demonstrates that the investment would double in a mere 
nine years (72 divided by 8).
This rule serves as a valuable tool for investors to quickly evaluate 
and compare the growth potential of different investment opportunities. 
It offers a simplified yet effective way to understand the impact of com￾pounding and the significance of various rates of return on wealth accu￾mulation. By employing the rule of 72, investors can make more informed 
decisions about their investment strategies, helping them set realistic 
financial goals and plan for the future with a clearer understanding of the 
timeframes involved in their investment objectives.
OBJECTIVE AND METHOD
In this section, investors will gain clarity on defining their investment goals 
and adopting a methodical investing approach, laying the groundwork for 
a purposeful and systematic approach to successful stock investing.
Determine Your Objectives
Setting clear investment objectives is a critical first step when contemplat￾ing stock market investments. These objectives serve as a compass, guid￾ing your investment strategy and helping you make informed decisions 
that align with your financial goals. Understanding your rate of return 
expectations and risk tolerance is vital in this process. For investors with 
conservative expectations and a low tolerance for risk, or those with a 
shorter time horizon, alternative investment vehicles that are less volatile 
may be more suitable. By defining your objectives, you can establish a 
foundation for making informed investment choices.
Once your objectives are well-defined, you can more accurately assess 
how to allocate your funds in the stock market. This includes determining 
the percentage of your portfolio that you are comfortable investing in stocks. 
The allocation decision should reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
If you seek higher returns and can bear the associated risk, you may opt for 
a larger allocation to stocks. Conversely, if you prioritize capital preservation 
or have a shorter investment horizon, a smaller allocation to stocks might be 
more prudent. Your objectives also play a crucial role in guiding your stock 
selection. By clarifying your investment goals, you can choose stocks that 
align with your objectives, whether you’re seeking income, capital growth, 
or a combination of both. Therefore, establishing your objectives is a pivotal 
part of the investment process, helping you tailor your investment strategy 
to your specific financial needs and circumstances.
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 5 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM6 • Navigating the Stock Market
Follow a Simple Investing Approach
Adopting a straightforward and uncomplicated investing approach is pru￾dent advice, especially for those who are not professional investors. While 
the financial world can be rife with complex investment strategies, theo￾ries, and jargon, it is crucial not to be overwhelmed or confused by these 
intricacies. Instead, investors should focus on identifying and adhering 
to simple yet effective rules. These rules should be well-founded, time￾tested, and have demonstrated their reliability in the market over the 
years. By choosing straightforward, proven guidelines, investors can navi￾gate the markets with greater clarity and confidence.
Without a set of well-defined rules, investing can become a haphaz￾ard and unpredictable endeavor. It is possible to achieve success occa￾sionally, but the likelihood of maintaining consistent success becomes 
considerably low. Hence, having a set of straightforward and dependable 
rules in place is pivotal for making informed and disciplined investment 
decisions. Furthermore, it is equally important to rigorously follow these 
rules once they have been established. A disciplined approach to investing 
ensures that you adhere to your pre-defined strategy and resist impulsive 
decisions that can be driven by emotions or short-term market fluctua￾tions. This steadfast commitment to your rules can help you maintain a 
consistent and rational approach to investing, ultimately contributing to 
more sound and rewarding financial outcomes.
Define Your Method and Follow It
Establishing a well-defined and methodical approach to investing is a cru￾cial prerequisite for achieving consistent success in the financial markets. 
Your chosen method should be a clear, systematic framework that outlines 
the decision-making process for both buying and selling investments. 
These rules can range from being simple to more intricate, depending 
on your individual investment approach and temperament. For instance, 
a well-defined buying rule might specify that you will only invest in com￾panies with an annual earnings growth rate exceeding 20% and a price￾earnings (P/E) ratio below 25. Similarly, a clear selling rule could mandate 
that you sell a stock if it experiences a decline of more than 10% or fails to 
meet its earnings expectations.
Once your method is in place, it is imperative to follow it consist￾ently. While you may choose to adapt or refine your method over time 
based on the insights and experience you gain, it is essential to avoid 
frequent or impulsive changes. Consistency in following your defined 
method helps you avoid knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations and 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 6 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 7
emotional decision-making, which can be detrimental to your investment 
performance. By adhering to your established rules and making adjust￾ments thoughtfully and methodically, you can maintain a structured and 
rational approach to investing, enhancing your ability to make informed 
and calculated decisions in the ever-changing world of financial markets.
Follow Your Method With Discipline
An established investment method is not a temporary or occasional guide￾line; rather, it is intended to serve as a long-term framework for your 
financial journey. It is crucial to understand that once you have defined 
and implemented a method, you must adhere to it consistently and 
with unwavering discipline. This means not altering or abandoning your 
method due to isolated poor trades or unique experiences. Emotional 
reactions to temporary setbacks or unexpected market events can lead 
to impulsive decisions that can be detrimental to your investment per￾formance. It is essential to resist the temptation to deviate from your 
method, even in the face of daily market fluctuations or news unless such 
developments genuinely impact the fundamentals and business prospects 
of the companies in your portfolio.
While strict adherence to your method is paramount, this does not 
preclude periodic review, analysis, and refinement. Regularly evaluating 
the effectiveness of your chosen method is a healthy practice. If, over time, 
it becomes evident that your method is not producing the desired results, 
you should consider adjustments or even adopting a new approach that 
has the potential for success. This is a proactive way to adapt to changing 
market conditions and refine your strategy to align better with your finan￾cial goals. In summary, a disciplined and unwavering commitment to your 
method, combined with a willingness to adapt and evolve, when neces￾sary, is essential for achieving long-term success in the world of investing.
Have a Long-Term Horizon
Embracing a long-term horizon is a fundamental principle of success￾ful investing. While trading can be a profitable strategy for some, it is 
important to distinguish between the objectives, techniques, and methods 
of traders and investors, as they are inherently different. Investors are 
focused on building wealth over the long term and should resist becom￾ing overly concerned with the day-to-day fluctuations and market gyra￾tions that traders may prioritize. Patience is a key attribute for investors, 
and it is crucial to remain committed to stocks with the potential to out￾perform the market. Having the discipline to hold onto or even add to 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 7 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM8 • Navigating the Stock Market
your investments during both declining and rising market conditions is 
essential for capitalizing on long-term opportunities.
It is vital to adopt an attitude that acknowledges the inevitability of 
some investments underperforming or encountering setbacks. Over time, 
learning from these experiences and continually striving to improve your 
investment performance is the path to outpacing the average investor. 
This process of continuous learning and adaptation allows investors to 
refine their strategies, make more informed decisions, and enhance their 
overall investment outcomes. By embracing a long-term mindset, remain￾ing patient, and learning from both successes and setbacks, investors can 
position themselves for greater success in building and preserving wealth 
over time.
STRATEGY AND APPROACH FOR STOCK MARKET 
INVESTING
This section delves into the nuanced art of crafting effective investment 
strategies, adopting proven approaches to navigate the dynamic stock 
market landscape with confidence.
Do Not Invest Without a Strategy
Having a well-defined investment strategy is an absolute imperative for 
anyone looking to enter the world of investing. The key is not necessarily 
the sophistication of the strategy, but the discipline in following one. A 
strategy provides you with a structured framework for your investments, 
helping you make informed decisions that align with your objectives and 
risk tolerance. A myriad of established investment strategies and tech￾niques, developed based on the cumulative experience of successful 
investors over many years, are available to guide you. These strategies 
encompass various approaches and objectives, catering to different finan￾cial goals and market conditions. Some of the most prominent strategic 
approaches include growth, momentum, and value investing, each with its 
own unique principles and methods.
It is important to acknowledge that not all investment strate￾gies work equally well in all investment environments, and some 
may falter due to changing market conditions. This underscores the 
significance of staying informed and adaptable in your approach. 
Markets are dynamic, and what was successful in the past may not 
yield the same results in the future. Thus, investors should periodi￾cally review and assess the effectiveness of their chosen strategy and 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 8 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 9
be prepared to make adjustments when necessary to stay aligned with 
evolving financial landscapes. The overarching principle is that a well￾considered strategy provides you with a roadmap for your investments, 
enabling you to navigate the complexities of the financial markets with 
greater confidence and purpose.
Select an Investment Strategy Before You Start Investing
Selecting your investment strategy is a pivotal step that should precede 
any actual investment. This decision should be grounded in a thorough 
understanding of your investment objectives, your expectations regarding 
returns, and the level of risk you find acceptable. Your chosen strategy 
serves as the compass that guides your investment journey and helps you 
make informed decisions that align with your financial goals. By identify￾ing and selecting a strategy that matches your individual circumstances, 
you are laying the foundation for a more purposeful and potentially suc￾cessful investment approach.
Once your strategy is in place, it is essential to implement it method￾ically and with unwavering discipline. Regardless of the specific strategy 
you choose, whether its growth, value, income, or a combination thereof, 
successful investors tend to be those who rigorously adhere to their cho￾sen strategy’s rules. By consistently following these rules, investors can 
mitigate impulsive decisions and emotional reactions to market fluctua￾tions. Investors who fail to implement their strategy with discipline often 
find themselves on the losing side in the stock market, as they may suc￾cumb to erratic and inconsistent decision-making that is disconnected 
from their defined investment strategy. 
Create Your Own Strategy for Better Alignment
Experienced investors often tailor and fine-tune established strategies 
to better align with their individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and 
personal experiences. These adjustments prove advantageous, especially 
when circumstances or objectives deviate from the standard framework of 
commonly recognized strategies. Some seasoned investors go a step fur￾ther, venturing into the creation of entirely new investment approaches 
tailored to their unique needs and preferences. Such strategies may result 
from innovative thinking or a creative synthesis of existing principles. 
It is crucial to recognize that developing new strategies carries inher￾ent risks, demanding only those with extensive experience and a high 
degree of sophistication in the field of investing to undertake significant 
experimentation.
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 9 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM10 • Navigating the Stock Market
Creating a novel investment strategy, particularly one based on 
untested or unconventional principles, requires a deep understanding of 
financial markets and a willingness to accept potentially high levels of risk. 
While such experimentation can yield valuable insights and substantial 
rewards, it also entails the potential for significant losses. For the majority 
of investors, adhering to established and proven strategies is generally a 
more prudent approach. Those with extensive knowledge and a strong 
risk appetite are best suited for engaging in the creation and testing of 
new investment approaches, while others may be better served by follow￾ing established methodologies.
Do Not Use Unproven Strategies
Utilizing unproven or experimental investment strategies should be 
approached with caution, and it is generally advisable to avoid them 
unless you are a highly experienced investor who is comfortable with the 
associated risks. Unproven strategies lack a track record of success and 
may not have been thoroughly tested in real-world market conditions. For 
less experienced investors or those who have not fully analyzed the poten￾tial risks, it is often wiser to stick with well-established and time-tested 
strategies that have demonstrated their efficacy in various market cycles.
Combining multiple established strategies, such as growth, value, and 
momentum, can indeed be complex and may present challenges due to the 
potential for conflicting signals. Each of these strategies has its own set of 
principles and objectives, and they may not always align cohesively. When 
combining them, investors should be aware of the inherent trade-offs and 
complexities involved. Unless you have a profound understanding of how 
these strategies interact and have the expertise to navigate potential con￾tradictions, it is generally safer to opt for a single, well-defined strategy 
that aligns more clearly with your investment goals and risk tolerance. In 
doing so, investors can maintain a more focused and disciplined approach, 
which is often conducive to more consistent and informed investment 
decisions.
Growth Investing Approach
The growth investing approach is one of the most widely practiced strat￾egies in the world of investing. This approach is characterized by its pri￾mary objective, which is to invest in companies that are experiencing 
rapid growth in their business operations. The rationale behind growth 
investing is that companies with above-average growth rates and strong 
earnings prospects are likely to witness substantial price appreciation in 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 10 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 11
their stock values over time. Investors who follow this approach have an 
underlying expectation that a growth stock’s earnings will continue to 
expand at a superior rate, leading to the assumption that this growth will 
be reflected in a higher stock price.
The specific level of growth sought in a growth investment can vary 
significantly according to individual investor needs and requirements. 
The minimum requirement typically involves seeking a growth rate that 
surpasses the overall market’s average. Beyond this baseline, the crite￾ria for growth investing are determined by various factors, including 
the investor’s risk profile (conservative, moderate, or high-risk) and the 
nature of the growth company in question. Established, large-cap com￾panies might provide more stable growth opportunities, whereas smaller, 
more aggressive firms may offer greater growth potential but come with 
increased risk. 
Value Investing Approach
Value investing is a widely practiced investment approach that focuses on 
identifying and investing in undervalued companies. The primary objec￾tive of value investors is to locate companies whose current market prices 
significantly undervalue their true intrinsic or liquidating value. These 
undervalued stocks are often viewed as opportunities to generate substan￾tial profits with a comparatively lower level of risk because the downside 
potential for these beaten-down stocks is perceived to be limited. Value 
investors assess the genuine worth of these companies by examining fac￾tors such as their earnings and dividend potential, as well as their asset 
values. A crucial metric that value investors frequently look at is the P/E 
ratio, preferring companies with lower P/E ratios as they are seen as more 
attractively priced. However, it is important to recognize that an excep￾tionally low P/E ratio can signal the market’s concerns about the compa￾ny’s performance and reduced earnings expectations. As a result, there 
is a risk that such undervalued stocks may stagnate, potentially tying up 
capital for an extended period. Before investing in an undervalued stock, 
it is imperative to understand the reasons behind its undervaluation and 
assess the potential for a turnaround.
Successful value investing requires a careful evaluation of the reasons 
for a stock’s undervaluation and a comprehensive assessment of the pros￾pects for the company to regain favor among investors. Value investors 
are often looking for companies that are temporarily out of favor or have 
been overlooked by the broader market, and they believe that these com￾panies have the potential to recover in the long run. A thorough analysis 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 11 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM12 • Navigating the Stock Market
of a company’s financial health, competitive positioning, and management 
quality is essential to determine whether the undervaluation is justified 
and if there is a reasonable expectation for the stock to appreciate in value 
over time. Therefore, value investing is a strategy that involves in-depth 
research and a focus on acquiring assets that are perceived to be trad￾ing below their true worth, with the expectation that their value will ulti￾mately be recognized by the market.
Momentum Investing Approach
Momentum investing is one of the three predominant approaches 
in the world of stock investing and is often characterized as “buying 
because others are buying.” In this strategy, investment decisions revolve 
around chart patterns and the momentum of stock prices and earnings. 
Momentum stocks are typically defined by their rapidly growing earnings 
and/or strong price appreciation trends. However, it is crucial to under￾stand that momentum investors have a strong proclivity to swiftly sell a 
stock at the first sign of a slowdown in either earnings growth or price 
appreciation momentum. This approach is associated with a high level of 
risk, as it can lead to substantial losses. The underlying reason for this risk 
is that, when any hint of trouble arises, momentum investors tend to exit 
en masse, which can amplify what might have been a minor decline under 
normal circumstances.
Momentum investing is characterized by its dynamic and responsive 
nature, with investors making quick and reactive decisions based on short￾term trends and signals. The primary allure of this approach is the poten￾tial for rapid and substantial gains when stocks are in favor, but it also 
carries a heightened level of risk due to the speed at which investors can 
exit positions when momentum starts to wane. As a result, momentum 
investing is often viewed as a strategy best suited for experienced and dis￾ciplined investors who are adept at closely monitoring market conditions 
and reacting swiftly to changes in momentum. For those who employ 
this approach, it is essential to have a solid understanding of the potential 
risks and to exercise caution in order to mitigate potential losses.
How to Combine Investment Strategies
Combining investment strategies can be a prudent approach to diversify 
your portfolio and potentially mitigate risk while seeking opportunities for 
growth. One way to achieve this is by allocating a specific percentage of 
your portfolio funds to different strategies. For instance, you could allo￾cate 75% of your portfolio to the growth strategy while simultaneously, 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 12 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 13
the remaining 25% of your portfolio funds could be dedicated to the value 
or momentum strategy, depending on your objectives. This combination 
allows you to harness the strengths of different strategies, balancing the 
potential for capital appreciation and the opportunities presented by 
undervalued or momentum-driven stocks.
However, it is vital to establish clear guidelines and allocate percent￾ages for each strategy at the outset. These guidelines should be informed 
by your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and the specific characteris￾tics of the strategies you are employing. This structured approach ensures 
that your portfolio is well-diversified and aligns with your individual finan￾cial goals. By adhering to these predetermined allocations, you can ben￾efit from the merits of each strategy while maintaining a disciplined and 
well-balanced investment approach. This flexibility can be particularly 
advantageous for investors who seek a multifaceted approach to portfolio 
management.
RESEARCH SOURCES AND TECHNIQUES
This section guides investors in their quest for sourcing reliable informa￾tion and employing effective research techniques, empowering them to 
make informed decisions, and conduct thorough analyses for successful 
stock market investing.
Research Using Multiple Sources
Conducting thorough and extensive research is a fundamental step in 
making informed investment decisions. It is important to recognize that 
there is a multitude of sources available to assist you in your investment 
research. Initially, it may require some time and effort to identify reliable 
sources that align with your specific investment research objectives. It is 
a crucial point to understand that no single source can provide you with 
all the information you need to make well-informed investment choices. 
To that end, diversify your research by leveraging various sources, which 
can include the Internet, newspapers, newsletters, personal contacts, bro￾kerage firms, and even direct communication with the companies you are 
considering for investment.
The Internet, in particular, has become a valuable and easily 
accessible resource for gathering information about companies, mar￾kets, and financial news. It provides a vast repository of data, research 
reports, and  insights that can be instrumental in your research pro￾cess. Newspapers and newsletters often offer in-depth analyses, expert 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 13 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM14 • Navigating the Stock Market
opinions, and financial news that can provide a well-rounded perspective 
on the investment landscape. Additionally, personal contacts and commu￾nication with brokerage firms can provide valuable insights and recom￾mendations based on their expertise and experience. Connecting directly 
with the companies you are interested in can also yield insights into their 
operations, strategies, and financial health. By diversifying your sources 
of information and conducting extensive research, you can enhance your 
ability to make well-informed investment decisions that align with your 
financial goals and risk tolerance.
Make the Internet Your Friend
Leveraging the Internet is an invaluable strategy for investors looking 
to gather comprehensive and up-to-date information. The digital realm 
offers a wealth of resources that can cater to virtually any investment 
research need. Numerous websites provide free access to a plethora of 
investment research materials. These resources encompass a wide range 
of information, such as concise business summaries and in-depth analy￾ses, up-to-the-minute stock quotes and charts, company-specific research 
reports, the latest company news, updates on competitors, earnings 
reports, stock screening and analysis tools, summary recommendations, 
investment newsletters, market summaries, details on investment confer￾ences, historical market data, and much more.
One of the key advantages of using the Internet for investment 
research is the accessibility to real-time data and a vast array of resources 
that can facilitate a more thorough understanding of the companies and 
markets you are interested in. Investors can conveniently track news, 
market trends, and company-specific information from the comfort of 
their own devices. This immediate access to a wide spectrum of financial 
information empowers investors to make more informed decisions, iden￾tify emerging opportunities, and stay attuned to market developments, all 
of which are critical for successful investment management.
Use the Investor’s Business Daily
An invaluable resource for investment research is Investor’s Business 
Daily (IBD), which is widely regarded as one of the top investment news￾papers. IBD, available online at investors.com, offers a comprehensive 
suite of tools and information to aid in research on individual stocks and 
the broader market. Beyond delivering basic daily stock prices and per￾formance data, IBD provides a wealth of additional features and insights, 
making it a valuable asset for investors. The newspaper offers daily market 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 14 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 15
analysis and charts, facilitating an in-depth understanding of market 
trends and conditions. Furthermore, IBD offers extensive research on 
individual companies with the potential to become market leaders, pro￾viding investors with critical information for stock selection.
In addition to individual stock research, IBD offers a host of other 
essential resources, including industry, group, and sector charts that help

options data are also available, aiding investors in making informed deci￾sions and managing their portfolios. IBD goes beyond the numbers by 
providing pertinent business news and analysis that can impact investment 
decisions. It is a must-read for serious investors who value comprehen￾sive, data-driven insights and wish to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of 
investing. With IBD’s comprehensive suite of tools and resources, inves￾tors can gain a more profound understanding of the market and individual 
companies, enabling them to make well-informed investment choices.
Do Not Use Unreliable Research Sources and Data
Caution is paramount when it comes to choosing research sources for 
investment decisions. While there is a wealth of information available, it 
is essential to recognize the limitations and potential pitfalls that can arise 
from unreliable or outdated data. One major concern is the accuracy of 
information and data from various sources. Inaccurate or flawed data can 
lead to misguided investment decisions, as it can create a false basis for 
analysis and conclusions. Therefore, it is crucial to scrutinize and validate 
the sources to ensure that the data you rely on is trustworthy and precise.
Another issue to watch out for is the timeliness of the information. 
Outdated data, especially regarding financial metrics like the P/E ratio 
or earnings reports, can seriously impact your investment analysis and 
decision-making. Using data that is several months old may not accurately 
represent a company’s current financial health or the market’s current 
conditions. Hence, it is essential to seek out sources that provide up-to￾date and relevant data, which is critical for making informed investment 
choices. Furthermore, in the age of the Internet, some sources may have 
hidden agendas or biases, potentially disseminating information or news 
articles with ulterior motives. It is essential to approach sources with a 
discerning eye and be cautious about the credibility and intentions behind 
the information they present. To make well-informed investment deci￾sions, select your research sources carefully, prioritize data accuracy and 
timeliness, and remain vigilant for potential biases or hidden agendas that 
could skew your understanding of the market and investment options.
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 15 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM16 • Navigating the Stock Market
Use Reliable Sources for Earnings Data
When it comes to earnings data, accuracy and timeliness are paramount, as 
this information forms the bedrock of many crucial investment decisions. 
Serious investors understand that using inaccurate or outdated earnings 
data can lead to misguided conclusions and investments. To ensure the 
reliability of your earnings data, it is imperative to turn to trusted and rep￾utable sources. Several established sources excel in providing accurate 
and up-to-date earnings data, making them invaluable to investors. Some 
of the most esteemed sources for earnings data include Thomson Reuters, 
Zacks, Standard & Poor’s, and Value Line.
These sources are renowned for their commitment to data accuracy 
and their ability to deliver earnings data in a timely manner. Investors 
can rely on them for insights into estimated and historical earnings, ena￾bling them to make well-informed investment decisions based on a solid 
foundation of financial information. By utilizing these trusted sources, 
investors can enhance their ability to assess companies and industries 
with confidence, knowing they have access to reliable earnings data that 
is instrumental in their investment research and strategy development.
Study Research Reports
Studying company research and earnings estimate reports is an essen￾tial practice for any serious investor before making investment decisions. 
These reports offer a wealth of consolidated information, presenting a 
comprehensive view of the company’s performance and prospects. A typ￾ical research report includes vital data on various aspects of the company, 
encompassing its business operations, financial health, earnings esti￾mates, insider trading activities, as well as insights on competitors and the 
industry in which the company operates. These reports are invaluable for 
investors as they provide both current and historical data, allowing for a 
thorough analysis of a company’s past performance and future potential.
The information contained within these reports serves as a critical 
resource for investors seeking to make informed investment choices. 
By delving into the details of a company’s research report, investors can 
gain a deeper understanding of its strengths and weaknesses, competitive 
positioning, and potential growth prospects. These reports often come 
from trusted sources, such as brokerage firms and financial research insti￾tutions, and are compiled by experienced analysts who provide valuable 
insights and guidance. In essence, studying research reports enhances an 
investor’s ability to make well-informed investment decisions grounded in 
a robust foundation of data and analysis.
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 16 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 17
Sources for Research Reports
Acquiring company research reports can be a straightforward process 
with a range of accessible sources. The initial point of contact for obtain￾ing these reports is often the company itself. Companies maintain access 
to a variety of research reports from multiple sources and are typically 
willing to share them with interested investors. Contacting the company’s 
investor relations department or visiting their official website is a common 
approach to requesting these reports.
Brokers are another convenient and reliable source for obtaining 
research reports. Many brokerage firms offer access to a wide array of 
research reports on companies, industries, and markets. They often 
provide these reports to their clients as part of their services, making it 
easy for investors to access valuable information to aid in their decision￾making process. In addition to these traditional sources, numerous online 
platforms offer research reports from trusted providers. These online 
resources give investors the flexibility to access research reports at their 
convenience and offer a wide selection of reports that cater to various 
industries and companies. By tapping into these diverse sources, investors 
can equip themselves with the research reports needed to make informed 
and well-rounded investment decisions.
Study the 10K Report
When conducting investment research, it is crucial to approach company 
reports with a discerning eye, as annual reports published by companies 
tend to be marketing-oriented and often emphasize the positive aspects 
of their performance. Relying solely on these reports can lead to a skewed 
perspective, and serious investors understand the importance of consider￾ing additional sources of information that provide a more balanced view. 
One such source that plays a pivotal role in this regard is the 10K report, 
a comprehensive document that all companies are mandated to submit to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 10K report offers a 
deeper and more accurate insight into the true financial health and oper￾ational standing of the issuing company. It goes beyond the glossy image 
portrayed in annual reports and delves into crucial details such as risks 
the company faces, business conditions, and other relevant information 
that is instrumental in evaluating whether the company’s stock is a sound 
investment.
By studying the 10K report, investors can access an in-depth under￾standing of the company’s operations, performance, and potential chal￾lenges. This document provides a more transparent and objective view, 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 17 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM18 • Navigating the Stock Market
highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of the company. It is an 
invaluable resource for investors who seek a comprehensive and balanced 
perspective, which is critical for making well-informed investment deci￾sions. The 10K report can help investors navigate beyond the marketing 
rhetoric and gain a clearer picture of the risks and opportunities associ￾ated with a particular company.
Reach Out to the Company
Engaging directly with the company is a proactive and valuable approach 
for obtaining investment information. Companies typically maintain inves￾tor relations departments that are dedicated to assisting shareholders and 
potential investors. When inquiring about investment research data and 
relevant information pertaining to the company, do not hesitate to reach 
out to these departments. They can provide a range of materials beyond 
the annual report, including press releases, product information, the 10K 
report, and analysts’ research reports on the company. These resources 
offer a more in-depth and up-to-date understanding of the company’s 
operations, performance, and strategic initiatives.
Most companies are receptive to shareholders’ and potential inves￾tors’ concerns and requests, and they prioritize providing accurate and 
relevant information. Establishing contact with the Investor Relations 
department is often a straightforward process, and it can yield valuable 
insights that contribute to your investment research and decision-making. 
Whether you have specific questions or require additional data to inform 
your investment choices, companies are typically willing and able to assist, 
ensuring that you have the resources needed to make well-informed 
investment decisions. This direct line of communication with the com￾pany can be an invaluable asset for investors looking to gain a more 
comprehensive view of the company’s financial health and prospects.
Listen in on Conference Calls
Listening in on company conference calls is an effective and insightful way 
for investors to gain valuable information about the company and its busi￾ness prospects. These calls are typically scheduled following the release 
of a company’s quarterly earnings results and provide a platform for exec￾utives to elaborate on the key points and implications of the reported per￾formance. During these calls, company executives delve into the details 
of their recently announced results, offering a comprehensive perspective 
on the factors influencing their financial performance, strategic initiatives, 
and future outlook. Conference calls can offer an opportunity for investors 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 18 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 19
to gain direct insights from the company’s leadership, making them a vital 
resource for those looking to make informed investment decisions.
To participate in or listen to these conference calls, investors can 
access schedules through various Internet platforms. This accessibility 
enables investors to stay up to date with the latest developments and 
assessments presented by the company’s management, further enriching 
their understanding of the company’s operations and future prospects. By 
tuning into these calls, investors can access valuable firsthand information 
that complements their investment research, allowing for a more com￾prehensive assessment of the company and its potential as an investment.
What to Focus on During Conference Calls
Conference calls provide a treasure trove of essential information that 
investors can leverage for making well-informed decisions. During these 
calls, company officials typically outline the key highlights of the recently 
completed quarter, offering a detailed examination of their financial per￾formance. This includes a breakdown of the results; including revenue, 
earnings, and other crucial financial metrics. Additionally, these calls 
often feature the presentation of strategic insights and discussions about 
the implications of financial statements.
Perhaps one of the most valuable aspects of conference calls is the 
forward-looking guidance provided by company executives. This guid￾ance offers investors insight into the company’s future prospects and strat￾egies, helping them gauge the potential for growth or challenges in the 
coming quarters. Furthermore, these calls often feature questions from 
participants, including analysts, which can offer valuable insights that may 
not be readily available elsewhere. Listening to the conference calls, espe￾cially for the companies within your portfolio and particularly your largest 
holdings, is a prudent practice. It equips you with a deeper understanding 
of the company’s performance and future outlook, allowing you to make 
investment decisions based on a comprehensive view of the company’s 
operations and prospects.
Attend Shareholders’ Meetings
Attending a company’s shareholders’ meeting is a valuable opportunity for 
investors to gain firsthand insights and information about the company’s 
operations and prospects. These meetings often feature formal company 
presentations that provide a detailed overview of the company’s perfor￾mance, highlighting successes, challenges, current conditions, and future 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 19 2/6/2024 12:15:26 PM20 • Navigating the Stock Market
business prospects. This information, presented by company executives, 
offers investors a direct and comprehensive understanding of the com￾pany’s strategies and outlook, serving as a critical resource for informed 
investment decisions.
One of the most beneficial aspects of shareholders’ meetings is the 
interactive nature of these gatherings. The question-and-answer sessions 
that follow the presentations provide a platform for investors to seek clar￾ification on specific issues, request additional information, or gain insights 
into aspects of the company’s performance that may not be readily availa￾ble elsewhere. Informal exchanges with the company’s officers and other 
shareholders also provide opportunities for productive discussions and 
networking. These interactions can enhance an investor’s understanding 
of the company and offer insights into its operations and strategies from 
multiple perspectives. By attending shareholders’ meetings, investors can 
fortify their knowledge and develop a deeper appreciation of the company.
SCREENING
In this section, investors will discover the art of systematically filtering and 
evaluating stocks based on specific criteria, honing their skills to identify 
promising opportunities, and build a resilient portfolio.
Use a Proven Method for Picking Winners
In the dynamic and often unpredictable realm of the stock market, 
employing a proven method for picking winners is a prudent approach, 
particularly for investors who may not have the extensive experience of 
seasoned professionals. The stock market is not an arena for experimen￾tation unless you are a highly experienced investor who has witnessed 
the market’s multifaceted nature over many years and economic cycles. 
Until reaching that level of expertise, utilizing established methods such 
as the CANSLIM method, developed by the renowned investor William 
O’Neil, is a wise strategy. CANSLIM represents seven key characteristics 
that underpin the method, each serving as a fundamental pillar for stock 
selection. This approach is rooted in sound fundamentals and combines 
both fundamental and technical analysis to identify promising investment 
opportunities.
The CANSLIM method relies on a set of variables to pick winners, 
including crucial factors like current quarterly earnings per share, annual 
earnings per share growth, and price performance. By integrating these 
essential metrics, investors can assess a company’s financial health, growth 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 20 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 21
prospects, and stock price momentum, enabling them to make well￾informed investment choices. Employing a proven method like CANSLIM 
offers a structured and systematic approach to identifying winning stocks 
in a market characterized by volatility and complexity. It provides a robust 
framework that enhances the investor’s ability to make sound investment 
decisions in line with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Search for Growth Companies
When seeking profitable stock investments, a primary focus should be 
on identifying fast-growing growth companies. These companies can 
be found across a spectrum of industries and sectors within the econ￾omy. However, it is important to note that a significant concentration of 
fast-growing companies lies within the technology sector. The tech indus￾try is renowned for its innovation and disruptive potential, making it a 
fertile ground for discovering companies with rapid growth trajectories. 
Beyond technology, other sectors also offer notable opportunities, with 
financial services and the health-care sector, particularly biotechnology, 
standing out as potential growth hotspots. These sectors are poised for 
substantial expansion over the coming decades, primarily due to the antic￾ipated high demand driven by the aging of the baby boomer generation.
By focusing your search on growth companies within these indus￾tries, you can position yourself to benefit from their potential for robust 
and sustained expansion. These companies are often characterized by 
innovation, strong revenue and earnings growth, and the capacity to tap 
into emerging trends and markets. Investing in such companies can offer 
the prospect of significant capital appreciation, making them a valuable 
component of a diversified investment portfolio.
Recognize and Pick Winning Indicators
When it comes to stock market analysis, selecting and using the right 
indicators is a crucial aspect of the screening and selection process. 
While there are countless indicators available for investors to consider, 
it is essential to exercise selectivity and focus on a few key indicators that 
are practical, powerful, and compatible with your chosen investment 
approach, whether its growth, momentum, or value. These indicators 
serve as tools for gauging a company’s financial health, performance, and 
potential, and they play a significant role in your investment strategy.
While the indicators employed by the various investment approaches 
may differ, there are some common indicators that have relevance across 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 21 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PM22 • Navigating the Stock Market
the board. These universal indicators serve as valuable tools in assess￾ing potential investment opportunities and can help investors make 
well-informed decisions regardless of their chosen investment strategy. 
By recognizing and picking these winning indicators, investors can equip 
themselves with a comprehensive set of tools to evaluate and select stocks 
that align with their investment objectives and risk tolerance.
Indicator Values to Use
It is crucial to recognize that the values assigned to indicators can vary 
significantly among different investment approaches, and these values 
are often tailored to match the specific strategy’s objectives and risk tol￾erance. Take, for example, the earnings growth indicator. A momentum 
investor, who seeks stocks with rapid price appreciation, may set a high 
bar, requiring a minimum of 40% earnings growth as a screening crite￾rion. This investor places a premium on companies exhibiting explosive 
growth potential. In contrast, a growth investor may opt for a slightly 
lower threshold, being content with a 25% earnings growth rate, as they 
still prioritize strong growth but may not require the same level of explo￾sive earnings expansion.
Conversely, a very conservative value investor, who prioritizes safety 
and stability, may set a more modest benchmark of 10% for earnings 
growth. This approach emphasizes companies with consistent and relia￾ble financial performance, even if the growth rate is more modest. These 
variations in indicator values underscore the significance of aligning the 
selection criteria with the chosen investment approach, ensuring that 
the chosen indicators reflect the specific goals and risk tolerance of the 
investor. By customizing indicator values in accordance with the invest￾ment approach, investors can effectively screen for stocks that match their 
unique investment objectives.
Use Indicators That Highlight Different Perspectives
Effective stock analysis requires a diversified set of indicators that pro￾vide insights from various angles, encompassing monetary, psychologi￾cal, and valuation perspectives. This multifaceted approach adds depth 
and dimension to the assessment of potential investments, as different 
indicators shed light on distinct aspects of a company’s performance and 
potential. By combining these varied perspectives, investors gain a more 
comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and risks associated 
with a particular stock. It is essential to recognize that the selection of 
indicators is an art rather than a science. Investors refine their indicator 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 22 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 23
choices over time through experience, learning from both successes and 
mistakes. The process of identifying the ideal combination of indicators to 
align with one’s investment objectives and goals is a dynamic and evolving 
one.
Incorporating a range of indicators can help investors capture the 
nuances and subtleties of the stock market. For instance, monetary indi￾cators can provide insights into a company’s financial health, while psy￾chological indicators offer information on market sentiment and investor 
behavior. Valuation indicators, however, focus on the intrinsic worth of a 
company’s stock. By thoughtfully integrating these different perspectives, 
investors can develop a well-rounded analysis that takes into account the 
multifaceted nature of the stock market, ultimately enhancing their ability 
to make sound investment decisions.
Earnings Indicators Favored for Screening and Selecting Stocks
Earnings indicators play a central role in stock screening and selection, 
and they are essential components of the assessment process for various 
investment approaches, including growth, momentum, and value strate￾gies. Here are some of the key earnings indicators commonly used across 
these approaches:
 Earnings per Share (EPS)—Quarterly and Annual: EPS reflects a 
company’s profitability on a per-share basis. Analyzing both quarterly 
and annual EPS allows investors to assess the consistency and growth 
of earnings over time, providing valuable insights into a company’s 
financial performance.
 Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate: This indicator gauges 
a company’s expected future earnings growth over an extended hori￾zon. It assists investors in identifying stocks with the potential for sus￾tained growth, a critical consideration for growth-focused investors.
 Earnings Estimate Revisions: Examining changes in earnings esti￾mates by analysts can provide valuable information about market 
sentiment and expectations regarding a company’s future earnings. 
Positive revisions may signal bullish sentiment, while negative revi￾sions can raise concerns about the company’s prospects.
 Earnings per Share Rank: EPS ranking allows investors to compare a 
company’s earnings performance against its industry peers. This indi￾cator can help identify companies with strong earnings relative to their 
competitors, a valuable insight for both growth and value investors.
 Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio and Relative P/E Ratio: The P/E ratio 
is a fundamental valuation metric that compares a company’s stock 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 23 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PM24 • Navigating the Stock Market
price to its earnings. Both the P/E ratio and the relative P/E ratio 
(comparing a stock’s P/E to its sector or industry) offer insights into 
a company’s valuation, which is essential for value investors assessing 
the attractiveness of a stock’s price relative to its earnings.
 P/E-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio: The PEG ratio is a hybrid indicator 
that combines the P/E ratio with expected earnings growth. It helps 
investors evaluate whether a stock’s price is justified by its growth 
prospects, making it particularly useful for growth-focused investors.
These earnings indicators are pivotal tools for investors, allowing 
them to evaluate companies from multiple angles and align their invest￾ment decisions with their chosen strategy. Whether it is assessing growth 
potential, market sentiment, or valuation, these indicators are valuable for 
making well-informed stock selections that support an investor’s financial 
goals and risk tolerance.
Additional Indicators Used for Screening and Selecting Stocks
In addition to the core earnings indicators, investors often rely on a range 
of supplementary indicators to comprehensively assess stocks. The choice 
of these additional indicators depends on an investor’s specific investment 
approach and objectives. Here are some additional indicators commonly 
used for screening and selecting stocks:
 Revenues (Sales) Growth: Monitoring a company’s revenue growth 
is crucial for understanding its top-line performance. This indicator 
helps investors evaluate the company’s ability to increase its sales over 
time, providing insights into its overall financial health and growth 
potential.
 Relative Strength (RS) Rank: RS rank measures a stock’s relative per￾formance compared to its peers or the broader market. It is a critical 
indicator for momentum investors, enabling them to identify stocks 
showing strong price momentum and potentially outperforming their 
competitors.
 Moving Averages: Moving averages are technical indicators that pro￾vide insights into a stock’s price trends and momentum. They are 
commonly used for identifying potential entry and exit points, espe￾cially for technical and momentum-oriented investors.
 Accumulation and Distribution: This indicator assesses the flow of 
money into and out of a stock. It helps investors understand market 
sentiment, particularly when it comes to accumulation (buying pres￾sure) and distribution (selling pressure).
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 24 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 25
 Daily Trading Volume: Trading volume reflects the number of shares 
traded in a stock on a daily basis. It offers insights into a stock’s liquid￾ity and can help investors gauge the level of market interest in a par￾ticular stock.
 Float: The float represents the number of a company’s shares availa￾ble for trading in the open market. It can impact a stock’s price vol￾atility and liquidity, making it a relevant consideration for investors 
focused on trading dynamics.
 Institutional Ownership: This indicator tracks the percentage of 
a company’s shares held by institutional investors, such as mutual 
funds, pension funds, and hedge funds. High institutional ownership 
can signal confidence in a stock’s potential, and some investors con￾sider it a positive factor.
 Insider Buying: Monitoring insider buying activity can provide 
insights into the sentiments of a company’s management and execu￾tives. It can be a valuable indicator for gauging the company’s pros￾pects and overall health.
 Stock Price: The stock price itself serves as a fundamental indicator. 
Investors may consider a stock’s current price level in relation to its 
historical prices or its price relative to its peers or the broader market.
 Market Capitalization: Market capitalization, or market cap, meas￾ures a company’s total value in the stock market. It is an important 
consideration for investors assessing a stock’s size and scalability.
 Return on Equity (ROE): ROE assesses a company’s profitability 
by measuring its ability to generate earnings relative to shareholder 
equity. It is a key financial indicator, particularly for value and funda￾mental investors.
 Debt/Equity Ratio: The debt/equity ratio evaluates a company’s 
leverage and financial stability by comparing its debt to its equity. 
Investors concerned about a company’s financial health consider this 
indicator when making investment decisions.
 Cash Flow Growth Rate: Evaluating a company’s cash flow growth 
rate provides insights into its ability to generate cash and manage its 
finances effectively. It is a valuable indicator for assessing financial 
strength and sustainability.
These additional indicators offer investors a comprehensive toolkit 
for evaluating stocks based on their unique investment objectives and 
strategies. Whether it is assessing price momentum, liquidity, financial 
health, or market sentiment, the choice of these indicators enables inves￾tors to make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and 
risk tolerance.

Combining Indicators From Different Investment Approaches is 
Risky
Combining indicators from different investment approaches can indeed 
be a double-edged sword, offering the potential for comprehensive 
insights but also introducing the risk of conflicting signals. The diverse 
array of available indicators, when combined thoughtlessly, can yield dis￾cordant and confusing messages for investors. To mitigate this risk, it is 
advisable to adopt a simple yet focused approach that aligns with your 
chosen investment strategy. By selecting only a few key indicators that 
are compatible with your approach, you can maintain clarity in your deci￾sion-making process.
For instance, an investor adhering to a specific strategy, such as growth 
investing, should opt for indicators that are in harmony with the principles 
of growth. This includes using indicators that emphasize earnings growth, 
revenue expansion, and momentum. Conversely, it is generally unwise 
to combine indicators from distinct investment approaches, particularly 
if they have the potential to generate conflicting signals. For example, a 
value investor, who prioritizes undervalued stocks with strong fundamen￾tals, should avoid incorporating indicators favored by momentum inves￾tors, like RS rank, which might emphasize price momentum over intrinsic 
value. This deliberate and strategy-aligned approach reduces the chances 
of receiving mixed signals and ensures that investors adhere to a consist￾ent and clear investment path.
Never Use a Single Indicator
Relying on a single indicator for investment decisions is a precarious prac￾tice, as it neglects the multifaceted nature of stock analysis. Stocks and the 
broader market are influenced by a multitude of factors, and thus, a com￾prehensive evaluation requires the consideration of a well-balanced set 
of indicators. Depending solely on one indicator can lead to suboptimal 
decision-making, as it may fail to account for the intricate interplay of var￾iables impacting a stock’s performance. To make sound investment deci￾sions, it is essential to employ a diverse mix of indicators that collectively 
provide a more holistic perspective. However, it is equally important to 
strike a balance in indicator selection.
Overloading on a large number of indicators can lead to informa￾tion overload and confusion. Investors should aim for a manageable and 
focused set of indicators, prioritizing those they believe to be most sig￾nificant in line with their investment objectives. By selecting a limited 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 26 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PMPlanning, Research, and Screening • 27
but well-chosen set of indicators, investors can better discern meaningful 
signals and maintain a clear and efficient decision-making process. 
Furthermore, the indicators should be harmonious with the chosen 
investment approach, avoiding combinations that might generate conflict￾ing or incongruous signals.
Limit the Number of Indicators to Track
In the complex world of the stock market, a multitude of indicators, var￾iables, and forces are constantly in play, making it a dynamic and often 
unpredictable environment. These indicators can exert varying degrees 
of influence, depending on the prevailing market conditions, economic 
climate, and specific investment goals. The significance of any given indi￾cator is not fixed and can fluctuate with changing circumstances, such 
as economic downturns, bull markets, bear markets, or earnings seasons. 
Additionally, the relative importance of different indicators can differ sig￾nificantly among investors, based on their individual investment philoso￾phies, experiences, and objectives.
Given this intricate landscape, it is crucial for investors to recognize 
that they do not need to track an overwhelming number of indicators to 
make informed decisions. Instead, they should focus on identifying and 
monitoring a select few that align with their investment approach and 
objectives. By honing in on a manageable set of indicators that hold par￾ticular relevance to their chosen strategy, investors can reduce complexity, 
increase efficiency, and maintain a clear and purposeful investment pro￾cess. This selective approach empowers investors to better navigate the 
multifaceted world of the stock market while emphasizing the indicators 
most relevant to their financial goals.
Use Online Screening Tools
Leveraging online screening tools is a smart and efficient way for inves￾tors to sift through vast stock databases and identify potential investment 
opportunities. These user-friendly tools, often accessible through pop￾ular financial websites, empower investors to customize their screening 
criteria by selecting specific indicators and their corresponding values. 
With easy-to-use menus and screens, investors can iteratively refine their 
searches, gradually narrowing down their criteria to pinpoint stocks that 
align with their investment objectives.
Prominent financial websites and apps offer comprehensive screen￾ing tools that cater to a range of investment strategies and goals. These 
NSM_CH01_3pp.indd 27 2/6/2024 12:15:27 PM28 • Navigating the Stock Market
platforms enable investors to efficiently filter through stocks, applying 
indicators and values tailored to their unique preferences. By harness￾ing the power of these screening tools, investors can streamline their 
stock selection process, saving time and effort while uncovering potential 
investment candidates that align with their criteria.

WHERE TO INVEST
This section guides investors in their quest to identify companies with the 
potential to become winners, so that their resources are invested effec￾tively in the stock market.
Invest in What You Know the Best
Investing in areas you are most familiar with is a shrewd strategy that can 
provide you with a competitive advantage and increase your chances of 
making successful investments. The principle behind this approach is that 
your in-depth knowledge and firsthand experience in a particular com￾pany, industry, or sector can give you valuable insights and an edge in 
identifying investment opportunities before they gain widespread atten￾tion. Early identification of promising stories, often before they become 
mainstream news or attract media attention, can be a significant advan￾tage in the world of investing.
In many instances, the best investment opportunities may be found 
right in your own backyard, within the companies or industries you have 
personal or professional connections with. This level of familiarity allows 
you to have a deeper understanding of the company’s fundamentals and 
business prospects, offering you an informational advantage over Wall 
Street analysts who may not possess the same level of insight. By keeping 
a keen eye on these potential investments and leveraging your unique 
knowledge, you can seize opportunities at an early stage and potentially 
benefit from the growth and success of these ventures.

Buy Into a Theme
Focusing on themes rather than fleeting fads is a prudent approach to 
investment that can lead to more sustainable and profitable outcomes. 
While fads may attract temporary attention and speculative interest, they 
often lack the enduring qualities needed to provide long-term returns. 
Instead, investors should aim to identify and invest in themes or trends 
that have the potential to persist over an extended period. These themes 
capitalize on the transformative power of changing lifestyles, technolog￾ical innovations, and evolving consumer preferences, aligning with the 
ongoing growth of the economy.
Recognizing and investing in a theme at its nascent stage is a chal￾lenging task, but it offers the potential for substantial rewards. Identifying 
and understanding these long-term trends can lead to the discovery of 
stock market leaders that stand to benefit from the sustained growth and 
evolution associated with the theme. While many investors may strug￾gle to identify such themes early on, those who succeed in doing so can 
position themselves to capture significant gains as the theme unfolds and 
takes root in the market.
What Are The Current Themes
One prominent and clearly observable theme in contemporary invest￾ing is the growing influence of artificial Intelligence (AI) across various 
sectors of our economy and daily lives. As AI continues to advance, it is 
poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future. Companies involved in 
AI development, software, machine learning, and data analytics are likely 
to thrive in this technological revolution. From autonomous vehicles to 
health-care diagnostics and financial risk assessments, AI is expected to 
permeate almost every aspect of our society. Investors can anticipate sub￾stantial growth and innovation within the AI sector, making it a promising 
area for long-term investment.
Another notable trend is the demographic shift, particularly with 
the aging baby-boomer generation. As this population segment ages, 
there will be a heightened demand for services in the health care and 
financial sectors. Health-care companies offering medical treatments, 
elderly care, and pharmaceuticals, as well as financial institutions provid￾ing retirement planning, wealth management, and insurance services, 
are expected to witness increasing demand for their offerings. Investors 
with a long-term horizon may consider these areas as opportunities for 
investment, given the foreseeable growth potential over the next couple 
of decades.

Buy Leading Companies in an Industry or Niche
Investing in leading companies within a particular industry or niche area 
is a sound strategy that can enhance the quality of your investment port￾folio. Instead of purchasing stocks from mediocre or average companies 
solely based on their lower stock prices compared to industry leaders, it 
is advisable to prioritize quality and performance. High-quality, premier 
companies that consistently outperform their peers should be the primary 
focus for investors. Selecting the top two or three companies in an indus￾try ensures that you are investing in companies with proven track records 
of success and market dominance.
While the top companies in an industry are often the preferred 
choices, there can be opportunities for investment in smaller compa￾nies that control a niche market or offer unique and innovative prod￾ucts or services. However, investing in such smaller companies should 
be approached cautiously. Thorough risk assessment and evaluation of 
the  potential rewards are essential before considering an investment 
in these niche players. The key is to strike a balance between industry 
leaders and smaller, specialized companies to build a well-diversified and 
risk-managed investment portfolio.
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 31 1/23/2024 5:02:23 PM32 • Navigating the Stock Market
Invest in a Company—Not the Market
Investing in a specific company rather than the stock market as a whole 
is a fundamental principle of sound investment strategy. Although the 
overall performance of the stock market can influence the short-term 
price movements of your stocks, the long-term success or failure of your 
investments hinges primarily on the performance and profitability of the 
individual companies in which you invest. A company’s business success 
is not intrinsically tied to the overall performance of the stock market, 
emphasizing the importance of conducting in-depth research and analysis 
on the specific company you are considering for investment.
Understanding the business, financials, and fundamentals of a com￾pany is critical when evaluating it as a potential investment. Even in a 
thriving stock market, a weak company is likely to face challenges and may 
not experience significant success. Therefore, your investment decisions 
should be driven by the company’s intrinsic qualities, growth prospects, 
and profitability rather than being solely influenced by broader market 
trends. This approach helps you make informed investment choices that 
are more closely aligned with the company’s individual merits and future 
potential.
Invest in Small Companies
Investing in small companies can be an attractive strategy due to the 
potential for larger price movements compared to their larger counter￾parts. Smaller companies often experience more significant price fluctua￾tions, which can result in substantial gains for investors. This heightened 
volatility can be attributed to the fact that small companies typically have 
smaller market capitalizations and, as a result, can undergo more dramatic 
shifts in response to various market events.
Furthermore, small companies have greater growth potential as 
they operate from a smaller base compared to larger, more established 
corporations. Smaller companies are often in a position to expand their 
sales and market presence more rapidly, allowing investors to bene￾fit from their growth. They can explore new markets and opportunities 
with greater ease, whereas larger companies often face the challenge of 
operating in saturated markets where expansion may be more limited. 
Investing in small companies can provide investors with the opportunity 
to tap into emerging growth stories and witness significant price appre￾ciation. However, it is essential to be aware that this approach can also 
involve higher levels of risk and volatility, so thorough research and risk 
management are crucial when considering such investments.
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 32 1/23/2024 5:02:23 PMBuying • 33
Favor Small-Cap Companies
Investors who favor small-cap companies often do so with the expectation 
of experiencing more significant price movements compared to their large￾cap counterparts. Smaller companies, or small caps, tend to be more nim￾ble and agile in responding to market conditions and opportunities. Due to 
their smaller market capitalization, small-cap stocks can make substantial 
price moves, driven by rapid growth, innovative products or services, or 
breakthroughs in their industries. These stocks often have fewer outstand￾ing shares available for trading, contributing to greater price volatility as 
each trade has a more significant impact on the stock’s price.
Additionally, small-cap stocks are often overlooked by institutional 
investors and analysts, making them less well-researched and less widely 
followed. This relative obscurity can present an opportunity for inves￾tors, as when these companies begin to attract attention from institu￾tional investors and analysts, demand for their shares can increase rapidly, 
potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. Favoring small-cap 
companies can provide investors with the potential for significant returns, 
but it is important to note that these investments come with higher risk 
and may exhibit greater volatility compared to their larger counterparts. 
Therefore, thorough research, due diligence, and risk management are 
essential when considering investments in small-cap stocks.
Favor Stocks With Market Cap Below $1 Billion 
Favoring stocks with a market capitalization below $1 billion is a strategy 
often associated with investing in small-cap companies. Smaller market 
capitalizations indicate that a company is considered a small-cap stock, 
which typically implies it is relatively less well-established or less known 
in the financial markets. Smaller companies may still be in a phase of 
rapid growth and have significant potential for future expansion, mak￾ing them attractive investment opportunities. These companies may be 
focused on niche markets, innovative products, or emerging trends, and 
investors often seek them out for the potential to realize substantial price 
appreciation.
Investors who favor stocks with market caps below $1 billion are often 
looking for opportunities to capitalize on underrecognized or underap￾preciated companies that have room for significant growth. It is important 
to note that while small-cap stocks offer potential for higher returns, they 
also come with higher risk and greater price volatility. As a result, due 
diligence, diversification, and risk management are essential when consid￾ering investments in small-cap stocks, and investors should be prepared 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 33 1/23/2024 5:02:23 PM34 • Navigating the Stock Market
for the potential for more significant price fluctuations in exchange for the 
possibility of substantial gains.
Do Not Be Misled By Large Price Moves
When evaluating stocks, it is crucial not to be misled by large dollar price 
movements. The absolute dollar value of price moves can be deceptive, as 
it doesn’t necessarily reflect the significance of the change in percentage 
terms. High-priced and larger companies may experience more substan￾tial dollar price fluctuations compared to smaller, lower-priced stocks, but 
these moves may represent a relatively lower percentage change in the 
stock’s value. Understanding the percentage change is essential because 
it provides a clearer indication of the stock’s performance and the impact 
on your investment.
For example, if a $100 stock increases by $10, it represents a 10% 
price movement. In contrast, a $20 stock that increases by the same $10 
represents a 50% price movement. Therefore, investors should not solely 
focus on the dollar amount of a stock’s price movement but instead con￾sider the percentage change to gauge its significance. This perspective is 
critical for making informed investment decisions, especially when com￾paring stocks with varying prices and market capitalizations.
Laggards Can Occasionally Become Winners 
Occasionally, overlooked and underestimated companies have the poten￾tial to emerge as winning investments. These companies might be over￾looked by Wall Street, leading to a lack of attention from investors, and 
this neglect can create opportunities for astute investors. However, it is 
important to be patient, as it may take some time for these hidden gems 
to gain recognition and for their stories to become known to a wider 
audience. Typically, these are not companies facing financial difficulties; 
instead, they often boast a robust track record of profitability spanning 
several years.
One common characteristic of these companies is their consistent and 
strong earnings growth, yet their stock prices may not reflect their finan￾cial performance, resulting in low P/E ratios. When the market finally 
recognizes the growth potential of such profitable companies, especially 
among growth stocks, there is potential for substantial profit as the P/E 
ratios expand. This growth in P/E ratios indicates growing investor confi￾dence and interest in these companies, which can lead to significant gains 
for those who identified the opportunity early on.

WHEN TO BUY
In this section, investors will learn the intricacies of identifying buying 
opportunities, which will enable them to avoid investing in stocks that will 
turn out to be poor investments.
Buy Low, Sell High
“Buy low, sell high” is a fundamental principle in investing, and it encap￾sulates the core concept of seeking to purchase assets at undervalued 
or discounted prices and then selling them at a profit when their value 
appreciates. The challenge for investors is determining what constitutes a 
“low” or undervalued price and what is a “high” or overvalued price for a 
particular stock. To apply this principle effectively, investors must develop 
an understanding of valuation methods, which can help them assess both 
the buying and selling points for a stock.
Valuation involves analyzing various financial metrics and indicators, 
such as P/E ratios, earnings growth rates, and other fundamental factors 
to estimate a stock’s intrinsic value. By comparing a stock’s market price to 
its intrinsic value, investors can make informed decisions about whether 
a stock is currently trading at a low or high price relative to its potential 
worth. This helps investors identify buying opportunities when a stock 
appears undervalued and selling opportunities when it becomes over￾valued, aligning with the timeless wisdom of “buy low, sell high.” While 
there is no one-size-fits-all approach to valuation, understanding these 
principles can provide a solid foundation for investors seeking to make 
well-informed and profitable decisions in the stock market.
Remain Invested at All Times
Remaining invested in the stock market at all times is a prudent strategy 
for most investors because attempting to time the market consistently can 
be challenging. Market timing involves predicting when to enter and exit 
the market to maximize gains or minimize losses, and it often leads to 
suboptimal outcomes due to its inherent uncertainty. Investors who try 
to time the market may miss out on significant market rallies or lock in 
losses during downturns. Instead, a more effective approach is to ride the 
market’s natural fluctuations and maintain a diversified portfolio that can 
withstand various market conditions.
During market declines or bear markets, it is crucial not to panic 
and sell all your holdings. Lightening up on your stock positions or 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 35 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PM36 • Navigating the Stock Market
rebalancing your portfolio by selling some overvalued assets can be a 
more reasonable response. Continuously investing a fixed amount of 
money, regardless of market conditions, can help you take advantage of 
opportunities when the market is down, as you will be buying stocks at 
lower prices. Conversely, in bullish markets when signs indicate strong 
performance, you may choose to be fully invested. Timing the market 
based on a rational assessment of market conditions, rather than emo￾tions or speculation, is a more strategic way to navigate the ever-chang￾ing landscape of the stock market.
Buy on Weakness—Sell on Strength
The principle of buying on weakness and selling on strength is a strategy 
that acknowledges the importance of timing in the stock market. When a 
stock experiences weakness, it may present an opportunity for value-ori￾ented investors to buy at a lower price, provided that the company’s fun￾damentals remain strong. This strategy aligns with the idea of purchasing 
stocks with a margin of safety, where investors aim to acquire shares at 
a discount to their intrinsic value. The key to success here is thorough 
research to confirm the company’s financial health and prospects before 
capitalizing on the weakness.
Selling on strength, however, is more applicable to traders or those 
with a specific exit strategy in place. While long-term investors often fol￾low the approach of letting their profits run, traders may opt to sell when 
a stock exhibits strong momentum or reaches a predefined target price. 
This can help traders lock in gains and manage risk more effectively. 
For long-term investors, it is generally advisable to remain invested in 
fundamentally sound companies and only consider selling if there is a 
significant change in the company’s fundamentals or if you have specific 
financial goals that require liquidating some of your positions.
Buy High, Sell Higher
The strategy of “buy high, sell higher” is a characteristic approach of 
momentum investing. Momentum investors focus on a stock’s recent 
price and earnings momentum, rather than traditional fundamental anal￾ysis or valuations. They are driven by the belief that stocks with strong 
recent performance will continue to exhibit that momentum and climb 
even higher. This strategy can be seen as a way to capitalize on market 
trends and is characterized by a focus on short- to medium-term price 
movements.
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 36 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PMBuying • 37
However, it is important to note that momentum investing comes 
with inherent risks, and it may not be suitable for all investors. It requires 
a keen understanding of technical analysis, as momentum investors rely 
heavily on charts and patterns to identify entry and exit points. For those 
not well-versed in these techniques, the strategy can be particularly risky, 
as it may be challenging to identify when a stock has lost its momentum, 
leading to potential losses. It is crucial for investors to be aware of their 
own risk tolerance and investment goals before considering a momen￾tum-based approach to stock investing.
Buy Stocks Six Months After a Recession Starts
Investing in stocks approximately six months after a recession has begun 
is a strategic move to maximize potential profits. It is based on the idea 
that stock markets are forward-looking, and they often begin to anticipate 
the economic recovery before it becomes evident to the broader public. 
During the early stages of the economic rebound, the stock market typi￾cally experiences its most significant gains as investors regain confidence 
and optimism starts to outweigh pessimism.
By entering the market during this period, you position yourself to 
capture the substantial upswing in stock prices that often occurs as the 
recession comes to an end. However, it is important to remember that 
economic cycles and market dynamics can vary, so it is not a foolproof 
strategy. Economic conditions, monetary policy, and other factors can 
influence the timing and trajectory of market recoveries. As such, it is 
essential for investors to conduct thorough research, understand their risk 
tolerance, and consider their individual financial goals when applying this 
strategy or any investment approach.
Dollar Cost Average to Avoid Mistiming
Dollar cost averaging is a prudent investment strategy for ordinary inves￾tors who seek to avoid the pitfalls of market timing. It helps mitigate the 
risk of buying at the peak of market exuberance or selling in a panic when 
prices are depressed. By investing a fixed amount of money at regular 
intervals, regardless of market conditions, investors acquire more shares 
when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. This approach, 
over time, can result in a lower average cost per share, enhancing the 
potential for long-term gains.
Dollar cost averaging aligns with the concept of disciplined invest￾ing, as it encourages investors to focus on their long-term financial goals 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 37 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PM38 • Navigating the Stock Market
rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations. It is especially 
beneficial for those who lack the expertise, resources, or time to engage 
in intricate market timing strategies. By consistently investing over time, 
investors can accumulate shares in a diversified portfolio, potentially 
benefiting from the natural upward trajectory of the stock market in the 
long run.
Average Up—Not Down
Averaging up, as opposed to averaging down, is a strategy that focuses on 
building on success rather than trying to rescue a declining investment. 
It involves adding more shares to a winning position as the stock’s price 
appreciates. This approach can be psychologically challenging for some 
investors because it requires them to buy a stock at a higher price than 
their initial entry point. However, it is essential to remember that stocks 
that are already performing well often continue to do so, provided that the 
underlying fundamentals and growth prospects remain strong.
Before averaging up, investors should conduct a thorough analysis to 
ensure that the stock is not overvalued and that the reasons for their initial 
investment thesis remain valid. By adhering to a disciplined approach, 
investors can capitalize on their successful picks and potentially increase 
their profits as their stocks continue their upward trajectory.
SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS
In this section, investors will learn about the role of seasonal factors in 
the stock market, which will enable them to take advantage of the positive 
factors, while avoiding their adverse impact.
Take Advantage of Seasonal Factors
Seasonal factors can play a significant role in stock market performance, 
and investors who pay attention to these patterns can enhance their invest￾ment strategies. These factors can impact various industries and sectors 
differently, and understanding them can provide a tactical advantage. For 
example, the retail sector often experiences strong performance during 
the holiday season, while the energy sector may benefit from increased 
demand for heating during the winter months.
Incorporating seasonal factors into your investment strategy can 
involve timing your stock purchases to coincide with the start of favora￾ble seasonal periods for specific industries or sectors. You can also adjust 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 38 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PMBuying • 39
your portfolio allocation based on these factors to capitalize on antici￾pated market movements. By paying attention to these seasonal patterns, 
investors can make more informed decisions and potentially achieve bet￾ter results in their stock market investments.
Take Advantage of the January Effect
The January effect is a well-documented market phenomenon character￾ized by a historical tendency for stocks, especially smaller ones, to per￾form well in the first month of the year. One of the key drivers of the 
January effect is the influx of new funds into the stock market during this 
time, including contributions to retirement accounts, year-end bonuses, 
and investment reallocations. This increased demand for stocks can create 
a positive bias in the market, particularly benefiting smaller-cap stocks 
that tend to outperform their larger counterparts during January.
Investors can take advantage of the January effect by carefully ana￾lyzing the market’s overall trend and bias before making investment deci￾sions. While January typically exhibits an upward bias, it is crucial to assess 
the broader economic and market conditions to avoid getting caught in a 
market that may be on the verge of a downturn. By being aware of this 
historical pattern and conducting thorough research, investors can poten￾tially leverage the January effect to enhance their investment strategies 
and potentially achieve more favorable outcomes.
Beware of September
September has gained a reputation as a historically challenging month for 
stock performance, primarily attributed to factors like the pre-announce￾ments of disappointing earnings results and concerns about companies 
falling short of their yearly targets. As the month progresses, investor 
sentiment can become more pessimistic, and this negativity can cast a 
shadow over the broader market. Even well-performing companies that 
meet their expectations may experience downward pressure on their 
stock prices due to the prevailing negative sentiment.
In light of these historical patterns, many investors opt to reduce 
their overall exposure to stocks before the arrival of September. By taking 
a more cautious approach during this month, investors aim to mitigate the 
potential adverse impacts of unfavorable market conditions. While past 
performance does not guarantee future results, the awareness of histori￾cal trends can inform investment strategies and help investors make more 
informed decisions.
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 39 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PM40 • Navigating the Stock Market
Take Advantage of Window Dressing 
“Window dressing” is a practice often employed by mutual fund managers 
at the end of each quarter. During this time, fund managers sell off the 
underperforming stocks in their portfolio. The primary motivation behind 
this practice is to present a more favorable picture of the fund’s holdings 
in their quarterly reports to investors. By eliminating the poor-performing 
stocks from the list, the fund can avoid showcasing these underperform￾ers. When multiple mutual funds engage in this practice and simultane￾ously divest from particular stocks, it increases selling pressure on those 
stocks, contributing to the phenomenon known as “window dressing.”
Investors can potentially take advantage of this situation when they 
recognize that a stock’s underperformance is primarily due to window 
dressing rather than deteriorating fundamentals. If a stock has faced chal￾lenging times but is now on an upward trajectory in terms of its underly￾ing financial health, and it experiences a decline due to window dressing, 
investors may have an opportunity to purchase the stock at a more attrac￾tive, discounted price. By understanding the dynamics of window dress￾ing, investors can navigate the market more effectively and identify 
potential opportunities for profitable investments.
WHAT TO DO BEFORE YOU BUY
This section identifies the pre-purchase steps that should be taken before 
investing, ensuring a comprehensive approach that empowers informed 
decision-making and strategic planning.
Select the Broker
The choice of a broker depends on your investment approach and level of 
expertise. If you are a self-reliant investor who prefers to make your own 
investment decisions, a discount broker is suitable for your needs. These 
brokers offer the essential service of executing your trades at a lower cost 
compared to full-service brokers, but they do not provide personalized 
advice or guidance on investment decisions. Discount brokers are ideal 
for experienced investors who have a clear investment strategy and do not 
require additional support.
If you are seeking guidance and advice in your investment decisions, a 
full-service broker is a better choice. Full-service brokers provide a range 
of services, including investment advice, research, and personalized rec￾ommendations. They can help you navigate the complexities of the stock

market and make informed investment choices. For traders, having access 
to a full-service broker with an efficient online trading platform is essen￾tial, as it can offer tools and resources to facilitate your trading activities, 
minimize risks, and optimize your investment strategies. Therefore, the 
decision regarding which broker to use should align with your investment 
goals and preferred level of involvement in the decision-making process.
Who Are the Leading Brokers
Brokers play a crucial role in facilitating stock trading and investment. 
They act as intermediaries between investors and the stock market, exe￾cuting buy and sell orders on behalf of clients. The brokerage industry 
encompasses a wide range of firms, providing investors with a variety of 
choices to suit their specific needs. Full-service brokers like Merrill Lynch, 
Morgan Stanley, UBS Wealth Management, J.P. Morgan Securities, and 
Goldman Sachs offer comprehensive services that include personalized 
investment advice, research, and financial planning. They are often a pre￾ferred choice for investors seeking guidance and a higher level of service.
Alternatively, discount brokers, such as Charles Schwab, e-Trade, 
Fidelity Investments, and Interactive Brokers cater to investors who pre￾fer a do-it-yourself approach. These brokers typically offer lower fees and 
commissions for executing trades but do not provide personalized invest￾ment advice. Investors can choose the type of broker that aligns with their 
investment goals, expertise, and level of involvement in their investment 
decisions. The brokerage industry’s diversity allows investors to select the 
most suitable option based on their preferences and financial objectives.
Get Information Before, Not After, Buying a Stock
Obtaining information before making an investment decision is a funda￾mental principle in the world of stock market investing. Rushing into buy￾ing a stock without conducting proper research can expose investors to 
unnecessary risks. This diligence involves studying the company’s financial 
health, its competitive landscape, and the broader economic environment 
in which it operates. By delving into these aspects, investors can better 
understand the company’s potential and the risks associated with its stock.
One common pitfall is being lured by a stock that appears attractive 
due to a sudden price drop. Such a scenario can indeed present opportuni￾ties, but it also necessitates a comprehensive investigation before making 
a move. Rushed decisions based solely on short-term market fluctuations 
can lead to suboptimal investment outcomes, so prudent investors should 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 41 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PM42 • Navigating the Stock Market
ensure they have the necessary information and insight to make well-in￾formed choices.
Analyze Fundamentals Before Investing
Analyzing a stock’s fundamentals before making an investment decision 
is a key practice in successful stock market investing. Whether a stock 
has declined significantly over an extended period or experienced a sud￾den drop in price, it is crucial to resist the impulse to buy immediately. 
Instead, take the time to investigate the reasons behind the decline. It is 
important to discern whether the worst is already reflected in the stock’s 
price or if there may be further declines on the horizon. Conducting a 
thorough analysis of the company’s fundamentals using fundamental anal￾ysis techniques is essential before arriving at any investment decision.
The same principle applies when a stock is on a fast upward trajec￾tory. Investors should exercise caution and not jump on the bandwagon 
without conducting a comprehensive fundamental analysis of the com￾pany. The goal is to understand the underlying reasons for the stock’s 
rapid ascent and assess whether it is justified by the company’s financial 
health and outlook. When evaluating a stock that has remained relatively 
stagnant for some time, it is essential to determine the reasons for its 
lack of movement. This assessment can help investors determine whether 
there are underlying issues or potential catalysts that may impact the 
stock’s future performance.
Determine Risk Associated With a Stock
When considering an investment in stocks, it is crucial to understand 
the risk associated with the specific type of stock you are interested in. 
Different stocks exhibit varying levels of risk and reward. For instance, 
stocks in the food industry are known for their relative stability and tend 
to experience minimal intraday fluctuations and moderate price changes 
over time. Contrastingly, technology stocks are renowned for their high 
volatility and significant price swings. These stocks carry inherent risk as 
their success is closely tied to rapidly evolving technology that can quickly 
become outdated once a superior alternative emerges. Therefore, it is 
essential to evaluate the potential risk and reward of a stock before mak￾ing an investment decision.
Assessing the risk associated with a stock involves examining various 
factors, including the industry it belongs to, the competitive landscape, 
the company’s financial health, and its exposure to market and economic 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 42 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PMBuying • 43
conditions. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of these elements, 
investors can make informed decisions about the level of risk they are 
willing to take on and the potential rewards they can expect from a par￾ticular stock.
Analyze Business Conditions and Prospects
Before making any investment in a stock, it is imperative to conduct a 
thorough analysis of the company’s business conditions and prospects. 
This analysis should encompass a broad spectrum of factors that can 
influence the company’s performance. You should begin by assessing the 
immediate business environment in which the company operates, con￾sidering elements such as market dynamics, regulatory changes, and eco￾nomic conditions. Evaluating the current and future business conditions 
is essential, as it provides insights into the company’s ability to thrive in 
its industry. Additionally, examining the expected market growth rate and 
potential for saturation is critical, as it can determine the company’s future 
growth prospects and overall health.
A comprehensive analysis should also delve into the competitive land￾scape, as understanding the company’s position relative to its competitors 
is vital. Product offerings, pricing strategies, and market share should be 
considered. By evaluating these factors, investors can gauge the compa￾ny’s competitive advantage or potential weaknesses. Furthermore, it is 
crucial to consider the outlook for the company’s products and services, as 
this can impact its long-term sustainability and growth potential. To make 
well-informed investment decisions, it is equally important to extend the 
analysis to the broader industry and sector in which the stock operates, as 
these external factors can significantly influence its performance. By thor￾oughly assessing business conditions and prospects, investors can better 
position themselves for success. 
Check the Market Health
Once you have identified a promising investment opportunity, it is essen￾tial to assess the overall health of the stock market since it can signifi￾cantly impact the performance of individual stocks. While attempting to 
perfectly time the market is not advisable, it is prudent to consider the 
broader market conditions before making an investment. If you perceive 
that the market is approaching a top, is in a declining phase, or has entered 
a bear market, it may be wise to delay your purchase. During such peri￾ods, market instability and uncertainty can negatively affect stock prices. 
NSM_CH02_2pp.indd 43 1/23/2024 5:02:24 PM44 • Navigating the Stock Market
Waiting for the market to stabilize and potentially identifying a bottom 
could help you make a more informed investment decision and reduce 
your risk exposure.
The state of the market also affects the risk level associated with 
your investment. In a bull market, where stock prices are generally ris￾ing, investments may carry less risk. However, in a bear market or dur￾ing a market decline, stocks become riskier investments. By assessing the 
market’s health and conditions, you can better align your investment strat￾egy with the overall market trend, potentially making more informed and 
risk-adjusted investment decisions.
Analyze Economic Conditions and Cycle
Analyzing economic conditions and the broader economic cycle is crucial 
in making informed investment decisions. Economic conditions have a 
significant influence on the performance and earnings potential of com￾panies. Different stocks respond differently to changes in the economic 
cycle. Defensive stocks tend to perform well in a slowing economy or 
during a recession as they are relatively immune to economic downturns. 
These stocks often belong to sectors such as utilities, health care, or con￾sumer staples, where demand for products or services remains consistent 
even in challenging economic times. Conversely, cyclical stocks are highly 
sensitive to the economic cycle. They are often associated with industries 
like manufacturing or construction and are likely to experience significant 
impacts during economic downturns.
Understanding the economic cycle allows investors to adjust their 
investment strategies accordingly. For example, during a recession, 
growth stocks may be favored because they can sustain their earnings 
growth even as the broader economy slows down. However, as the econ￾omy starts to recover, cyclical stocks become more attractive. By analyzing 
economic conditions and their impact on different sectors, investors can 
make well-informed decisions that align with the current economic envi￾ronment and the expected trajectory of the economic cycle.

FAST AND CONSISTENT GROWTH
This section delves into the art of identifying stocks with dynamic and 
steady growth patterns, providing investors with valuable insights for bol￾stering their portfolios with resilient and high-performing assets.
What Are Growth Stock Characteristics?
A growth stock is a company that exhibits a growth rate significantly higher 
than the market average. What makes a growth stock attractive to inves￾tors is its potential for rapid expansion and profitability. Growth stocks 
tend to outperform during periods of economic slowdown or recession 
because they are less dependent on the overall economic cycle. When the 
broader economy is sluggish, growth companies can maintain or even 
increase their earnings, making them appealing investments.
Investors looking for growth stocks should focus on small compa￾nies that have the potential for substantial growth, especially in sectors 
or industries experiencing rapid expansion. The key is to identify com￾panies with growth rates that surpass not only the market average but 
also their own industry, sector, and benchmarks like the S&P 500, which 
tracks the 500 largest companies in the United States. This emphasis 
on outperforming peers and benchmarks is what distinguishes growth 
stocks and makes them an attractive choice for those seeking above￾average returns.

High Growth Rate Should Be Sustainable
A strong growth stock should have a solid track record of high growth in 
both revenues and earnings. This growth should consistently outpace the 
market average, ideally exceeding 20%. However, it is not merely the cur￾rent growth rate that matters; a promising growth stock should demon￾strate the potential to accelerate from, for example, 10%–15% growth to 
25%–30% or more. What sets a growth stock apart is the ability to sustain 
this high growth rate for more than just a few quarters. This sustainability 
is a key factor in evaluating a growth company.
Furthermore, a sustainable growth stock is often found in an industry 
that is experiencing growth itself. Being part of an expanding sector allows 
the company to maintain or even increase its growth rate in the years to 
come. Investing in companies poised to capitalize on the growth of their 
industry can provide investors with an opportunity to benefit from not just 
current growth but future prospects as well.
Stock Should Have Small Capitalization
The market capitalization of a stock, which is calculated by multiplying 
the stock price by the number of outstanding shares, is a key determinant 
of how stocks are classified. One common classification designates a stock 
with a market capitalization of less than $1 billion as a small-cap stock. 
However, to identify the most promising investment opportunities in the 
growth stock arena, you should focus on small-cap stocks that have strong 
growth potential. These stocks are often found in the market cap range 
of $500 million to $1 billion, where the company’s size and the growth 
prospects can be well balanced.
When searching for growth stocks, you can also consider those with 
a market capitalization in the $1–$2 billion range, as they may still offer 
substantial growth opportunities while having a bit more financial stability 
than smaller, riskier small-cap stocks. Stocks with a market capitalization 
below $500 million are typically considered more speculative and should 
be approached with caution, as their shorter track record makes it chal￾lenging to effectively evaluate their growth potential and stability.
Growth Must Be Accompanied By Profits
Growth is indeed essential, but it must be sustainable and accompanied 
by profits to create long-term value for investors. Many companies have 
experienced rapid revenue growth without generating corresponding 
profits, which often leads to disappointment for investors. The dot-com 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 46 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 47
bubble is a prime example of companies that exhibited explosive revenue 
growth but failed to translate that into profits, ultimately leading to inves￾tor losses. A company should not just focus on growth for growth’s sake; it 
should aim to achieve a balance between growth and profitability.
A sustainable and robust growth strategy is one in which a company 
can expand its top line (revenues) while also demonstrating a healthy bot￾tom line (profits). Sustainable profits indicate that a company can rein￾vest in its operations, research, and development, which are essential for 
future growth. When analyzing a company’s profitability, it is important 
to ensure that these profits are not achieved through temporary means 
like cost-cutting, restructuring, or asset sales, as such methods are not 
sustainable and may not bode well for the company’s long-term prospects. 
Instead, true profitability growth should stem from the company’s core 
operations and business model.
Revenue Should Be Increasing at a Healthy Pace
Healthy revenue growth is a fundamental indicator of a company’s strength 
and potential. When a company’s revenues increase, it means it can sell 
more of its products or services, which is a sign of strong demand and 
effective business operations. Revenue growth is crucial for long-term 
earnings growth because, without it, the potential for increasing profits is 
limited. Consistent and sustained revenue growth is a key factor in driving 
earnings growth over time.
Investors should keep a close eye on a company’s revenue growth 
and view it as a warning sign if this growth begins to stagnate or decline. 
Declining sales can signal issues such as market saturation, competition, 
or a decrease in demand for the company’s products or services. In such 
cases, the company may struggle to maintain or improve its profitabil￾ity, making it less attractive to investors. Consequently, when evaluating a 
potential investment, assessing the trend and sustainability of a company’s 
revenue growth is a critical analysis component.
Learn How to Analyze Revenue
Analyzing a company’s revenue can be approached in various ways to gain 
a more comprehensive understanding of its performance and prospects. 
One crucial metric to track, in addition to annual sales, is the “quarterly 
sales percent change,” which measures the percentage change in a com￾pany’s quarterly sales compared to the same quarter of the previous year. 
This metric provides insights into the company’s recent performance and 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 47 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM48 • Navigating the Stock Market
its ability to maintain growth over time. Additionally, examining seasonal 
patterns and any variations in sales categories can help identify strong and 
weak areas within the company’s revenue streams. This can be especially 
valuable in understanding the dynamics of the business and potential 
growth drivers.
When analyzing revenue, it is essential to be cautious when a company 
exhibits extremely high growth rates, such as 50%–100%, as such rates 
may be unsustainable and could indicate that the company is in a spec￾ulative or risky phase. Furthermore, closely monitoring the sales growth 
of a company’s flagship product(s) is crucial. If these products start to 
experience declining sales, it can serve as an early warning sign of poten￾tial problems within the company. A decline in sales for key products may 
indicate increased competition, shifting customer preferences, or poten￾tial difficulties in maintaining market share. This makes it an important 
indicator to assess when evaluating the overall health and potential future 
success of the company.
Growth Rate Should Be Greater Than the P/E Ratio
When considering an investment in a growth stock, it is essential to verify 
that the stock’s P/E ratio is lower than its earnings growth rate. This com￾parison helps investors assess whether the stock is trading at a reasonable 
valuation relative to its growth prospects. For example, if a growth stock 
has an annual earnings growth rate of 30%, its P/E ratio should ideally be 
less than 30. Some investors are more lenient and allow for a P/E ratio up 
to 125% of the growth rate, but when the P/E ratio exceeds the growth 
rate, it typically indicates that the stock may be overvalued. This is an 
important consideration for value-oriented and growth investors, as it 
helps in determining whether the stock’s current price is justified based 
on its expected earnings growth.
It is worth noting that small companies in a high-growth phase can 
sometimes have significantly higher P/E ratios than the general guideline 
suggests. This is because investors may be willing to pay a premium for 
the potential rapid expansion and growth opportunities associated with 
smaller firms. In such cases, the assessment should also consider the 
company’s overall growth prospects and the specific industry or sector 
dynamics influencing its valuation. While this guideline provides a helpful 
reference, investors should conduct a comprehensive analysis of a growth 
stock, taking into account various factors, to make informed investment 
decisions.

PROFITABILITY
This section helps uncover the vital metrics and financial indicators 
essential for identifying stocks with sustainable profitability, empowering 
investors to make informed decisions.
The Company Must Be Profitable
Earnings are a fundamental driver of stock prices over the long term. 
For this reason, it is crucial to invest in companies with a track record of 
profitability and those that are currently generating profits. Companies 
in their early development stages, particularly those accumulating losses, 
should be approached with caution. When evaluating small companies, 
it is advisable to focus on those with a consistent positive earnings trend 
over a period of three to five years, unless there is a justifiable reason for 
an occasional off year. A single year of underperformance can be over￾looked if the company demonstrates a rapid recovery and strong growth 
prospects.
Profitability is a vital indicator of a company’s financial health and 
ability to deliver long-term value to investors. Sustained profitability 
reflects the effectiveness of the company’s operations and its capacity to 
generate returns for shareholders. Investing in profitable companies with 
a solid earnings track record provides investors with greater confidence in 
the stock’s stability and growth potential. However, it is also important to 
conduct a thorough analysis of the reasons behind any isolated earnings 
declines to ensure that they are not indicative of broader issues within the 
company.
Earnings Growth Rate Should Be High
When seeking investment opportunities, it is crucial to identify stocks 
with a strong potential for future profitability. To accomplish this, con￾centrate on the projected earnings growth for the next three to five years. 
An exceptional growth company will have a long-term, 3–5 year projected 
earnings growth rate exceeding 25%. A higher growth rate is generally 
considered more favorable for investment, as long as it is expected to 
be sustainable. These long-term projected earnings growth rates can be 
obtained from sources like Zacks, Thomson Reuters, Standard & Poor’s, 
and other reliable online platforms.
A high earnings growth rate is a key indicator of a company’s ability 
to expand its profitability over time. It reflects the company’s capacity to 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 49 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM50 • Navigating the Stock Market
generate higher earnings and deliver value to its shareholders, making it 
an attractive investment option. However, it is important to ensure that 
this growth rate is sustainable and supported by sound fundamentals, 
business prospects, and market conditions to avoid investing in compa￾nies with overly optimistic projections that may not materialize. Thorough 
research and analysis are essential to verify the accuracy and feasibility of 
these growth expectations.
Annual and Quarterly Earnings Should Be Increasing
When evaluating potential investments, it is essential to scrutinize a 
company’s earnings, which are reported both on an annual and quarterly 
basis. A crucial aspect to consider is the consistent growth of these earn￾ings. Wall Street generally favors companies that consistently outper￾form earnings expectations and deliver consistent growth. Conversely, 
companies that fail to demonstrate consistent earnings growth or report 
disappointing earnings often face severe consequences in the financial 
markets. As an investor, it is prudent to prioritize companies that exhibit 
rapid increases in both their annual and quarterly earnings, with growth 
rates ideally exceeding 20%. To make informed investment decisions, it is 
vital to develop the ability to analyze earnings data, such as year-over-year 
increases, and understand their implications for the stock’s performance.
By closely monitoring earnings trends, you can gain valuable insights 
into a company’s financial health and prospects. Consistently increasing 
annual and quarterly earnings are indicative of a well-managed and finan￾cially sound organization. Such companies are better equipped to cre￾ate shareholder value, attract investor confidence, and potentially yield 
favorable returns for their shareholders. When considering stocks with 
consistent earnings growth, focus on their ability to maintain and poten￾tially exceed these growth rates over time, thereby indicating a long-term 
commitment to profitability and financial stability.
Earnings Should Be Accelerating
Earnings acceleration is a key indicator of a stock’s potential to succeed. 
Companies that consistently demonstrate increasing acceleration in both 
quarterly and annual earnings, such as transitioning from a growth rate 
of 20% to 25% and then 30%, tend to exhibit characteristics associated 
with winning stocks. These companies often outperform earnings esti￾mates, which are released by a multitude of Wall Street analysts. Such 
outperformance typically results in positive assessments and upgrades 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 50 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 51
from these analysts, frequently contributing to an upward movement in 
the stock’s price.
For investors, focusing on stocks with accelerating earnings is a 
strategic approach that can yield substantial rewards. Companies that 
consistently show this pattern may signal a robust business model and 
strategic planning, leading to increased market valuation and the potential 
for higher returns for investors who seize the opportunity. Consequently, 
recognizing and investing in stocks with accelerating earnings can be a 
fundamental component of building a successful and profitable invest￾ment portfolio.
Earnings Estimates Are Being Raised
Earnings estimates play a significant role in evaluating a company’s poten￾tial stock performance. While it is crucial for a company to meet its earn￾ings estimates, it is equally vital to pay attention to the direction in which 
these estimates are moving. When analysts consistently raise their esti￾mated earnings for a particular company, it is considered a positive sig￾nal. This upward revision indicates growing confidence in the company’s 
prospects, which can have a positive impact on its stock performance. 
Conversely, if earnings estimates are being consistently lowered, it is 
viewed as a negative sign, often reflecting concerns about the company’s 
ability to meet its financial targets.
Investors are generally advised to focus on stocks for which earnings 
estimates are trending upward. These are the stocks most likely to expe￾rience strong appreciation because the positive sentiment and increas￾ing expectations from analysts suggest a bright future for the company. 
Conversely, it is recommended to be cautious with stocks that are expe￾riencing downward revisions in earnings estimates, as they may indicate 
underlying issues or uncertainties about the company’s financial health 
and growth prospects. By paying attention to the direction of earnings 
estimates, investors can make informed decisions and position themselves 
for potentially more favorable returns.
EPS Rank Is High
The earnings per share rank is a valuable tool for investors to gauge 
a  company’s earnings performance and growth trajectory. It provides a 
score, ranging from 1 to 99, based on a company’s EPS growth over the 
past five years and the consistency of that growth. A higher EPS rank is 
indicative of better performance. Essentially, this metric measures how 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 51 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM52 • Navigating the Stock Market
a stock’s earnings momentum compares to that of all other stocks in the 
market. Therefore, companies with higher EPS ranks are considered 
leaders within their industry. For example, a company with an EPS rank 
of 90 indicates that its earnings have outperformed 90% of other compa￾nies, making it a leader in terms of earnings growth.
Investors are encouraged to favor companies with a high EPS rank, 
particularly those with an EPS rank of 80 or higher. Such companies typ￾ically demonstrate strong earnings momentum and have a track record of 
delivering consistent growth. High EPS ranks are often associated with 
fewer earnings disappointments, making these stocks attractive options 
for investors seeking reliable and potentially more lucrative opportunities 
in the market. Analyzing a company’s EPS rank can be a valuable compo￾nent of stock selection, helping investors identify businesses with robust 
earnings growth and a higher likelihood of positive stock performance.
EPS Rank Is Rising
While it is crucial to consider a stock’s current EPS rank when making 
investment decisions, it is equally important to look for stocks whose EPS 
rank is on an upward trajectory. Stocks with rising EPS rank are often pre￾ferred by momentum investors who follow trends. Investing in a stock with 
a relatively modest EPS rank, say around 60 or 70, that eventually climbs 
to an EPS rank of 90 or higher can lead to significant gains. However, this 
strategy requires a solid foundation of fundamental analysis to ensure that 
there are valid reasons for anticipating an increase in the company’s earn￾ings in the future. It is essential that earnings are on an upward trajectory 
since this is the key driver behind an increasing EPS rank.
For investors who seek stocks with strong growth potential and the 
prospect of a rising EPS rank, it is imperative to monitor a company’s 
financial health, business conditions, and other factors that can influ￾ence earnings growth. The ability to predict and anticipate a rise in 
earnings is critical in capitalizing on stocks with improving EPS rank, 
making fundamental analysis an indispensable component of your 
investment strategy.
Margins Are High and Rising
High and rising profit margins are significant indicators of a successful 
growth company. These companies often excel by introducing new prod￾ucts with increasingly shorter product cycles, resulting in higher profit 
margins. For these companies, the ability to charge a premium for their 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 52 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 53
innovative products is a key factor contributing to rapid earnings growth. 
Leading-edge businesses tend to maintain high profit margins, which 
sets them apart from commodity businesses that typically operate with 
lower margins. When evaluating stocks through fundamental analysis, it is 
essential to favor companies that are experiencing rising profit margins, as 
this trend signifies an upswing in profitability that is likely to be reflected 
in the company’s stock performance.
Rising profit margins not only signal growing profitability, but also 
indicate that the company may have a competitive advantage in its indus￾try. This advantage can result from cost efficiency, superior product dif￾ferentiation, or pricing power that enables the company to maintain those 
high margins. As such, it is crucial to track and consider the margin trends 
of companies in your investment analysis to make informed decisions and 
identify stocks with strong growth potential.
MOMENTUM
This section explores the dynamic world of momentum investing, providing 
investors with insights into identifying stocks with strong upward trends, 
and strategic entry points for maximizing returns.
RS Rank Is High
The relative strength rank is a valuable measure that assesses a stock’s 
price performance over the past year, with more emphasis on the last 
quarter’s performance and compares it to all other stocks in the market. 
It serves as a crucial tool for identifying strong-performing stocks, espe￾cially among market leaders. Therefore, in your stock selection process, 
it is wise to favor stocks with an RS rank of 80 or higher, as this indicates 
strong price momentum. These stocks are often sought after by momen￾tum investors who prefer to invest in companies with a proven track 
record of outperforming their peers.
Conversely, if a stock’s RS rank starts to decline, it should raise a 
flag of concern, and investors should consider taking appropriate action. 
A decreasing RS rank suggests a loss of relative price strength and could 
be indicative of the stock’s weakening performance compared to the 
broader market or its industry peers. Monitoring the RS rank of stocks 
within your portfolio is a key practice, allowing you to identify poten￾tial changes in their price momentum and make informed investment 
decisions accordingly.
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 53 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM54 • Navigating the Stock Market
Stock Is Hitting New Price Highs
Hitting a new 52-week price high is an important indicator for investors, 
especially momentum and growth investors. When a stock achieves this 
milestone, it signifies that the stock is in an uptrend, and there is typically 
less resistance from sellers. Resistance often arises when current share￾holders, who purchased the stock at a higher price, reach their breakeven 
point and decide to sell. For momentum investors, in particular, stocks 
hitting new price highs are highly attractive. These stocks tend to be 
favored because they often exhibit strong price momentum, which can 
lead to further gains.
Growth stock investors also appreciate stocks reaching new price 
highs, but they do so with a focus on the underlying fundamentals and 
valuations. It is important to ensure that the stock’s current price is sup￾ported by its financial performance and future growth prospects. In cases 
where the fundamentals align with the new price highs, it presents a com￾pelling investment opportunity, as such stocks have the potential for con￾tinued growth and positive returns.
Accumulation Is Taking Place
The accumulation/distribution rating is a valuable indicator when consid￾ering a stock for investment. It reflects the level of institutional interest 
in the stock and is typically reported on a scale from A to E. A rating of 
A or B indicates that institutions, such as mutual funds and other large 
investors, are actively accumulating the stock. This is a positive sign for 
investors as it suggests that well-informed market participants with signif￾icant resources are showing confidence in the stock’s potential.
Institutional buying is a critical driver in pushing stock prices higher. 
When institutions are accumulating stock, it often leads to increased 
demand, which can result in price appreciation. Conversely, ratings of D 
or E signal that institutions are selling the stock, which can put downward 
pressure on its price. Therefore, when evaluating a stock for investment, 
the accumulation/distribution rating should be taken into account as it pro￾vides valuable insights into institutional sentiment and can be a contributing 
factor in your investment decision-making process. This rating is frequently 
reported in financial publications like the Investor’s Business Daily.
Stock Is in an Uptrend
For investors who follow technical analysis and employ momentum-based 
strategies, the 200-day moving average is a valuable tool for identifying 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 54 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 55
stocks in an uptrend. When a stock’s price consistently trades above its 
200-day moving average, it is seen as an indication that the stock is on an 
upward trajectory. This moving average helps chartists and momentum 
investors identify the prevailing direction of the stock’s price movement. 
An uptrend can signal that the stock is experiencing positive momentum 
and is likely to continue rising in the near term.
However, for investors who primarily rely on fundamental analysis 
to make investment decisions, the 200-day moving average might not 
hold the same level of significance. They typically use it as an additional 
tool for timing their entry into a stock. After conducting thorough funda￾mental analysis and identifying a stock as a good investment candidate, 
the 200-day moving average can then be used as a technical indicator to 
help pinpoint an optimal entry point. This combination of fundamental 
and technical analysis can provide investors with a more comprehensive 
approach to stock selection and timing their investments.
LEADERSHIP
This section delves into the crucial aspect of evaluating corporate leader￾ship, uncovering the traits and indicators that distinguish companies with 
effective and visionary leaders, guiding strategic investment decisions for 
long-term success in the stock market.
Stock Is a Leader
Investing in leading companies, also known as market leaders or sector 
leaders, can be a strategic approach for investors. These companies often 
have a competitive edge in their respective industries, with strong market 
positions and robust financial performance. Being leaders, they are more 
likely to benefit from economic growth and market upturns. When times 
are good, these companies often outperform their peers and tend to be 
the first to experience gains. This is why, in times of economic expansion 
and the start of a new bull market, investors should focus on identifying and 
investing in leading companies within the sectors they are interested in.
However, it is important to recognize that leadership in the stock 
market can shift over time. A company that was a star performer in the 
previous bull market may not necessarily continue as a leader in the next 
one. Therefore, investors should stay vigilant and continuously monitor 
the market dynamics to identify emerging leaders and not just cling to the 
past high flyers. This is crucial because a former high-flying stock, even 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 55 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM56 • Navigating the Stock Market
after a significant price decline, might still be overvalued, and its best days 
of growth may already be behind it. By being selective and staying attuned 
to changes in market leadership, investors can adapt their strategies to 
stay ahead in the dynamic world of stock investing.
Stock Is a Leader Emerging From a Correction
Picking emerging leaders as they recover from a correction can be a 
rewarding strategy for investors. Corrections in the stock market can be 
challenging, and they often hit growth stocks particularly hard. During 
a typical bull market correction, growth stocks might decline by 1 1/2 
to 2 times the market average. However, some stocks show resilience 
by either not correcting as much or even rising during this period. 
These are the stocks that often emerge as new leaders when the market 
rebounds.
To identify these emerging leaders, investors should look for sev￾eral key indicators. New price highs, a high RS rank, and improving fun￾damentals are signs that a stock is on the path to becoming a potential 
leader. Stocks that maintain a high RS rank during a market correction 
stand out because the RS of leading stocks usually undergoes a sharp 
drop during these periods. When the market rebounds, these stocks have 
a higher likelihood of experiencing significant price appreciation, mak￾ing them attractive candidates for investment. By focusing on emerging 
leaders coming out of a correction, investors can position themselves to 
capture strong growth potential and participate in the next phase of the 
market’s upturn.
Company Has Superior Leadership
The leadership of a company plays a pivotal role in its growth and success. 
A capable and effective management team is a key factor in identifying a 
successful growth company. These leaders are responsible for shaping the 
company’s strategy, execution, and adaptability to challenges and oppor￾tunities. Management teams with a strong track record are more likely 
to make informed decisions, set the right course for the company, and 
successfully execute their plans.
In contrast, companies with weak or incompetent leadership, even 
if they possess great products or services, are at a significant disadvan￾tage. In such cases, a lack of strategic vision and ineffective execution 
can hinder the company’s ability to adapt to changes in the market or 
effectively address unexpected challenges. Therefore, when evaluating 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 56 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 57
potential growth stocks, it is essential to consider the quality and track 
record of the management team as a critical factor in the company’s 
growth prospects.
Stock Market Leader Need Not Be a Household Name
It is important to recognize that stock market leaders often emerge from 
relatively young and fast-growing companies that may not be well-known 
household names. In many cases, these young and dynamic growth stocks 
are not the subjects of widespread public recognition. In fact, the best 
growth opportunities often come from companies that have yet to gain sig￾nificant attention from the mainstream market or media. When a company 
starts to receive extensive media coverage and becomes widely known, it 
may already be approaching its peak potential in terms of price apprecia￾tion. This is because once a company becomes too popular, there are fewer 
new buyers entering the market to drive its stock price even higher.
Furthermore, smaller companies, particularly those in the early 
stages of their growth, are often not on the radar of institutional investors 
or Wall Street analysts. These under-the-radar companies are less likely 
to be influenced by institutional trading, and when they eventually attract 
the attention of these larger players, it can lead to substantial price appre￾ciation in a relatively short timeframe. Therefore, identifying and invest￾ing in lesser-known small growth stocks can offer significant potential for 
capital appreciation.
Use Industry Groups to Identify Leadership
Industry groups can provide valuable insights for identifying poten￾tial stock leaders and winners. When evaluating stocks, pay attention to 
the industry groups that are in an uptrend and showing strength. In a 
well-performing industry group, you will often find many stocks achieving 
new price highs, which is a clear indicator of current leadership within 
that sector. This trend suggests that these groups are poised to maintain 
their positions in the market for the near future.
To maximize industry group performance rankings, concentrate on 
sectors where an increasing number of stocks are making new highs. This 
indicates sustained growth and leadership within the sector. Additionally, 
within these top-performing industry groups, consider stocks that have 
a high EPS rank, preferably above 90. Such stocks are more likely to be 
potential leaders, exhibiting strong growth and earning capabilities. By 
focusing on these industry groups and stocks with robust EPS ranks, you 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 57 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM58 • Navigating the Stock Market
can enhance your chances of identifying and investing in market leaders 
well-positioned for future success.
Sources to Scan for Industry Group Leadership
To identify industry group leadership and potential market winners, inves￾tors can rely on various sources that provide data on sectors, groups, and 
industries. One of the most comprehensive resources for this information 
is the Investor’s Business Daily, which tracks 197 industry groups. IBD’s 
data allows investors to pinpoint the top-performing industry groups and 
identify those with the highest percentage of stocks achieving new highs. 
It is also a valuable tool for checking the performance of different mar￾ket sector indexes, offering valuable insights for investment decisions. 
Other organizations that track industry groups include Standard & Poor’s, 
Bloomberg, FactSet, and Zack’s Investment Research.
These sources offer investors the essential data they need to make 
informed investment decisions based on industry group performance. By 
regularly monitoring industry rankings and analyzing the data provided by 
these sources, investors can stay up to date with current industry leaders 
and position themselves for potential market success.
OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
This section explores a diverse range of essential traits beyond the con￾ventional metrics, providing a nuanced understanding of unique factors 
that contribute to identifying winning stocks, and fostering a well-rounded 
investment strategy.
High Demand for Products
A successful growth company’s rise to prominence is often driven by sev￾eral key factors. First and foremost, such a company will establish itself as 
a market leader with innovative products that align with broader market 
trends and themes. Its offerings will meet a significant demand, setting it 
apart from competitors and positioning it as a frontrunner in the industry. 
The company’s products or services will typically have a competitive edge 
with unique advantages, allowing it to control a niche area within the 
market. This competitive advantage is further reinforced by high barriers 
to entry, making it difficult for new players to compete effectively.
Furthermore, a successful growth company will maintain a strong 
product cycle, consistently introducing new and improved offerings to 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 58 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 59
meet evolving customer demands. A significant portion of its revenues 
will be reinvested in research and development (R&D), ensuring its abil￾ity to innovate and remain competitive. The company may also introduce 
groundbreaking products or services that disrupt the industry and gener￾ate significant customer interest. These characteristics contribute to its 
leadership in the market and its potential to become a winning stock.
Strategic Market Position
A successful growth company secures a strategic market position that ena￾bles it to maintain high prices for its products or services. This is typically 
achieved through a combination of factors. The company will have estab￾lished a strong market presence, often based on a combination of propri￾etary technologies, intellectual property, or other competitive advantages. 
Also, its offerings are positioned as premium or unique within the indus￾try, allowing it to command higher prices.
A growth company’s marketing strength, achieved through effec￾tive advertising, branding, and strategic alliances, facilitates outreach to a 
diverse customer base. Diversification mitigates risks associated with rely￾ing on a single customer, enhancing stability. Barriers to entry, like complex 
technologies and regulatory requirements, protect market position and 
contribute to growth potential. These factors collectively fortify the compa￾ny’s strategic position, enhancing its attractiveness as an investment.
Institutional Ownership Is High
Institutional ownership is a factor to consider when evaluating a potential 
investment in a stock. Institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, 
and hedge funds are considered influential market participants due to 
their substantial financial resources and professional expertise. High insti￾tutional ownership is a positive indicator because it reflects the confidence 
these professional investors have in the company’s growth prospects. 
Institutional investors typically conduct thorough research and analysis 
before making substantial investments, and this can provide additional 
validation for your own investment thesis.
When selecting stocks, balancing institutional ownership is crucial. 
Stocks with excessive institutional ownership, often above 50%, may lack 
significant growth potential as available capital from institutions is satu￾rated. It is advisable to target stocks with moderate ownership (25%–50%) 
showing increasing institutional interest. This balance allows for poten￾tial additional institutional capital, driving value higher, while preserving 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 59 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PM60 • Navigating the Stock Market
opportunities for individual investors. Avoiding stocks with excessive insti￾tutional presence is prudent, as they may have already reached their peak 
potential for institutional-driven price appreciation.
Insiders Should Have a High Stake
High insider ownership is a favorable indicator when evaluating a stock 
for potential investment. When company executives, directors, and other 
insiders hold a significant stake in the company through stock ownership, 
it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. This alignment can be 
beneficial for individual investors because it means that the company’s 
leadership has a personal financial stake in the stock’s performance. If the 
stock price rises, insiders will benefit directly from the financial gains, cre￾ating an incentive for them to make decisions that promote shareholder 
value. Conversely, if the stock price falls, insiders will also experience a 
decline in their own net worth, motivating them to take actions that help 
support the stock’s value.
Furthermore, high insider ownership can result in a reduction in the 
number of shares available for trading in the open market, which can lead 
to increased scarcity and, potentially, increased demand. The concept of 
“skin in the game” is highly regarded because it suggests that insiders are 
more likely to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
when their own wealth is directly tied to the company’s stock price. As 
such, individual investors often view companies with a higher percentage 
of outstanding stock held by insiders as more trustworthy and reliable, 
particularly when it comes to making strategic decisions that impact the 
company’s financial health and long-term growth prospects.
Insider Buying Is Taking Place
Insider buying, which occurs when company executives, directors, and 
other insiders purchase shares of their own company’s stock on the open 
market, is a strong indicator of their confidence in the company’s future 
prospects. It suggests that those who are most familiar with the inner 
workings of the business have a positive outlook and believe that the com￾pany’s performance is likely to improve or remain strong. When insiders 
buy shares, it can be a signal to individual investors that the company’s 
financial health and growth prospects are sound.
The reason insider buying is considered a valuable indicator is that 
it reflects a personal financial commitment on the part of the company’s 
leadership. When insiders invest their own money in the company’s stock, 
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 60 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMPicking Winning Characteristics • 61
they have a vested interest in its performance. If the stock price rises, they 
stand to benefit directly from the financial gains. Conversely, if the stock 
price falls, they will also experience a decrease in their own net worth, 
providing them with a strong incentive to take actions that promote the 
stock’s value. For individual investors, this can be seen as a positive sign 
that the company’s management believes in its ability to deliver value to 
shareholders and that its business prospects are on an upward trajectory.
Stock With a Small Float Should Be Avoided
The size of a stock’s float, which represents the number of shares available 
for trading on the open market, can have a significant impact on its price 
dynamics. For investors, it is important to consider the float when evalu￾ating a stock because it can influence the supply and demand balance, and 
ultimately, how easily the stock’s price can be moved in either direction. A 
stock with a reasonable float typically strikes a balance that allows for rel￾atively stable price movements, reflecting the law of supply and demand.
If a stock has a relatively high number of outstanding shares, it means 
there is a greater supply available in the market. Consequently, it can be 
more challenging for buyers to drive the stock price significantly higher, 
as it requires a substantial increase in demand to overcome the available 
supply. On the other hand, a stock with a very small float can be more 
susceptible to sharp price swings, as relatively small trading volumes can 
have a more pronounced impact on the stock’s price. When evaluating a 
stock, it is essential to consider the float size in the context of your invest￾ment goals and risk tolerance. Stocks with larger floats tend to be less vol￾atile, making them suitable for conservative investors, while stocks with 
smaller floats can offer more substantial price movements but come with 
increased risk and potential for significant volatility.
NSM_CH03_2pp.indd 61 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMNSM_CH03_2pp.indd 62 1/23/2024 5:10:15 PMCHAPTER
THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY
In this section, investors will learn how to evaluate a company from dif￾ferent perspectives, such as its business, product cycle, and management 
before investing in it.
Perform Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis is a critical step in the stock selection process, and 
it forms the foundation of informed investment decisions. This thorough 
examination of a company and its operating environment involves the 
assessment of various factors and indicators that collectively determine 
the company’s health, growth potential, and suitability for investment. 
These factors can include the company’s financial statements, earnings, 
revenue growth, market position, competitive advantages, and overall 
performance.
In a comprehensive fundamental analysis, you delve into the com￾pany’s financial health, looking at income statements, balance sheets, 
and cash flow statements to assess its ability to generate profits and cash 
flows. Evaluating a company’s competitive advantages, industry dynam￾ics, and long-term prospects is also crucial, as these factors can signifi￾cantly impact its growth potential. Additionally, you may explore technical 
and sentiment indicators to gain insight into market trends and investor 
sentiment. A sound understanding of these elements allows you to make 
informed investment choices, aligning your portfolio with your financial 
Company, Industry, and
Sector Analysis

NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 63 1/23/2024 5:13:02 PM64 • Navigating the Stock Market
goals and risk tolerance. Whether you are a value investor focused on 
undervalued stocks or a growth investor seeking companies with strong 
growth prospects, fundamental analysis provides the necessary insights to 
make informed investment decisions.
Study the Company’s Business
Studying a company’s business is a fundamental step in the process of 
evaluating its investment potential. This in-depth examination requires 
assessing the core aspects of the company’s operations, including its 
products and services. The sustainability and quality of these offerings 
are crucial considerations, ensuring they aren’t just fleeting fads but have 
long-term value. Analyzing the product cycle and upgrades can provide 
insight into the company’s ability to adapt to changing market demands 
and stay competitive. A company’s market share, leadership position, and 
control of a niche are also important factors to gauge its industry domi￾nance and growth potential.
Moreover, it is essential to scrutinize the competitive landscape and 
identify any unique advantages or differentiators that set the company 
apart from its rivals. By thoroughly evaluating the company’s business, 
you can gain a deeper understanding of its financial prospects, its position 
within the industry, and its potential for future growth. This knowledge 
is pivotal in determining whether the stock price is likely to appreciate in 
sync with the company’s business expansion, making it a valuable compo￾nent of the stock selection process.
Evaluate the Company’s Products
Evaluating a company’s products is a pivotal aspect of fundamental analy￾sis when considering potential investments. Innovation plays a significant 
role in a company’s profitability, as businesses that continually introduce 
innovative and cutting-edge products tend to enjoy a competitive edge. 
Investors should favor such companies because innovation often translates 
to higher profit margins and growth opportunities. Innovative companies 
are more likely to be rewarded with superior stock price appreciation, 
making them attractive investment candidates.
Furthermore, diversification within a company’s product line can 
reduce risk. A company with a broad range of products is better posi￾tioned to weather industry fluctuations and market challenges. In con￾trast, companies with a single product or a product line lacking diversity 
are exposed to more significant risk. If their primary product faces issues 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 64 1/23/2024 5:13:02 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 65
or fails, these companies can become highly vulnerable. It is advisable to 
limit exposure to such companies in your investment portfolio to mitigate 
the potential impact of such vulnerabilities on your overall returns.
Study the Product Cycle
Analyzing a company’s product cycle is integral to fundamental analysis, 
offering insights into potential revenue growth and profitability. A robust 
product cycle, marked by timely releases meeting market demand, sig￾nals optimism for investors, and often results in increasing revenues and 
profits, positively impacting the stock price. Thoroughly investigating the 
company’s product release schedule is vital to understanding fluctuations 
in the revenue stream, aiding investors in informed decisions on buying 
or selling. Additionally, monitoring this schedule helps identify potential 
delays, advising caution and potential avoidance of the stock to mitigate 
risks.
Understanding a company’s product cycle is a dynamic aspect of fun￾damental analysis, involving tracking the timing and impact of product 
releases. Staying informed about the company’s product development and 
launch schedule enables investors to align their investment strategies with 
expected growth and financial performance, facilitating informed deci￾sions on entering or exiting positions in the stock.
Evaluate Management Strengths and Weaknesses
Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of a company’s management 
team is a crucial aspect of fundamental analysis. Effective management 
is often a deciding factor in a company’s long-term success or failure. The 
competence, experience, and strategic vision of a company’s leadership 
team can significantly impact its ability to not only survive but also thrive 
in a competitive business environment. The importance of sound man￾agement should not be underestimated, as it plays a pivotal role in guiding 
a company to success.
As part of the analysis process, it is important to scrutinize the past 
track records and achievements of key executives and management per￾sonnel within the company. Their prior experiences and successes in 
other organizations can provide valuable insights into their leadership 
abilities and effectiveness. For instance, if the CEO or other key execu￾tives have demonstrated exceptional performance in their previous roles, 
it can instill confidence in investors that the company is in capable hands. 
These past achievements can serve as an indicator of the potential for 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 65 1/23/2024 5:13:02 PM66 • Navigating the Stock Market
strong leadership, which is a fundamental driver of a company’s future 
performance and, consequently, its stock price.
Evaluate Management Characteristics
The evaluation of management characteristics is essential for determining 
the potential success of a company. Management’s integrity and ethical 
standards are foundational aspects, as it is vital for leadership to operate 
with transparency, honesty, and ethical behavior. A management team that 
adheres to high standards of integrity will build trust within the company 
and among shareholders, fostering a more positive relationship between 
the company and its investors. This trust, in turn, is critical for maintaining 
investor confidence and encouraging long-term commitment to the stock.
A company’s management should also exhibit strategic vision and the 
ability to develop and execute effective business plans. Strategic thinking 
is necessary to navigate competitive markets and identify growth oppor￾tunities. The capability to execute plans and willingness to invest in the 
company’s future are important indicators of management’s dedication to 
long-term success. Furthermore, management should be responsive and 
adaptable to changes in the market and economic conditions. Strong com￾munication and marketing skills are also crucial for conveying the compa￾ny’s vision to both the investment community and customers. By assessing 
these characteristics, investors can gain insight into how management is 
perceived by the investment community and how well they are equipped 
to lead the company to success.
STUDY ENVIRONMENT, COMPETITION, AND 
OWNERSHIP
In this section, investors will gain insights into the multifaceted factors 
shaping a company’s performance, including the environment in which it 
operates, competitive landscape, and ownership.
Determine Market Growth Expectations and Expansion Plans 
It is crucial to assess the market growth expectations and expansion plans 
of the company in which you have invested. First, examine the markets 
where the company operates, including both domestic and international 
markets. Understanding the geographical reach of the company provides 
insights into its exposure to different economic conditions, regulatory 
environments, and customer bases. Companies that have a diversified 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 66 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 67
geographic presence may be better equipped to weather economic fluc￾tuations and capture opportunities in high-growth areas.
Expansion plans are crucial in assessing a company’s potential for 
future growth. Investigate whether the company has a clear strategy and 
plans to enter new markets or extend its presence in existing ones. The 
company’s ability to execute these expansion plans and its understanding 
of the competitive landscape in target markets are vital factors in assessing 
future growth prospects. Evaluating market saturation and competition 
will help you gauge the pace at which the company’s sales and profits might 
expand, providing insights into the potential direction of the stock price.
Determine the Company’s Market Control Status
It is essential to evaluate the company’s market control status relative to its 
competition. This assessment involves understanding whether the company 
operates in a niche market, holds a monopoly, or maintains a significant 
market share within its industry. Each of these scenarios has unique impli￾cations for the company’s profitability and, by extension, its stock price.
In the case of a niche market, you should examine the company’s 
ability to maintain control of that niche and the strength of the barri￾ers to entry. Niche areas can be highly profitable, as they often face less 
direct competition. Companies that effectively protect their niche posi￾tions can enjoy sustained profitability, which can positively impact their 
stock prices. If the company operates as a monopoly, it may also thrive, 
but it must navigate potential challenges, such as regulatory burdens and 
constraints on growth. These regulatory factors could affect the compa￾ny’s future prospects and stock performance. Evaluating the company’s 
market control status is an important aspect of fundamental analysis that 
can guide your investment decisions.
Analyze Existing Competitors as Well as Potential Competition
When evaluating a company for investment, it is essential to assess both 
its existing competitors and potential competition in the market. A com￾prehensive understanding of the competitive landscape can provide 
valuable insights that influence your investment decision. For instance, 
your analysis may uncover a strong competitor that is on the verge of 
introducing a groundbreaking product, making it an attractive investment 
option. In this scenario, the company you are evaluating could face sig￾nificant challenges and increased competition, potentially affecting its 
future performance. Consequently, you might opt to avoid investing in 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 67 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PM68 • Navigating the Stock Market
this company and, instead, consider the competitor that appears to have 
superior growth prospects and investment potential.
This thorough examination of competitors helps you make more 
informed investment decisions, ensuring that you select companies with 
a competitive advantage and the ability to thrive in their respective mar￾kets. It is an important aspect of fundamental analysis that allows you 
to identify companies with strong growth prospects and avoid potential 
pitfalls associated with intense competition.
Check If Insiders Have Been Buying
When evaluating a potential investment, it is crucial to examine insider 
trading activity, particularly instances of insider buying. This information 
can be obtained from an SEC filing, company website, as well as financial 
news websites. While insider selling can occur for various reasons and 
may not always be indicative of the company’s future prospects, insider 
buying is often viewed as a highly positive signal. Insider buying typically 
reflects the belief of company insiders (who possess intimate knowledge of 
the company’s operations) that the stock’s price is poised to increase. The 
greater the number of insider buyers and the more significant their pur￾chases, the stronger the signal of confidence in the company’s prospects.
Insider buying is a notable aspect of fundamental analysis because 
it suggests that those closely connected to the company have a positive 
outlook on its future performance. This can serve as a valuable indicator 
for investors, indicating potential upward momentum in the stock’s price 
and contributing to the investment decision-making process.
Check If Institutions Have Invested in the Stock
When analyzing a stock, it is essential to assess the level of institutional 
ownership, as it can provide valuable insights into the stock’s potential for 
price appreciation. Institutional ownership refers to the percentage of a 
company’s outstanding shares held by institutions such as mutual funds, 
pension funds, and other large investment entities. This metric is  sig￾nificant because institutions possess substantial buying power and can 
significantly influence the demand for a stock.
If the level of institutional ownership falls within the range of 10% 
to 20%, it suggests that institutions have started to accumulate the stock. 
While this indicates some institutional interest, it also implies that there is 
ample room for further institutional buying. Ideally, investors often prefer 
to see a higher level of institutional ownership, typically falling within the 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 68 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 69
25%–50% range. This level implies a more significant presence of institu￾tional investors in the stock, indicating that the stock may have caught the 
attention of the investment community. However, if the institutional own￾ership exceeds this range, it may signify that the stock has already been 
widely “discovered,” and there might be limited potential for additional 
institutional buying to drive the stock’s price significantly higher.
CONFIRM COMPANY’S FINANCIAL HEALTH
In this section, investors will learn how to analyze a company’s health from 
different perspectives, using key metrics and indicators, which are crucial 
for assessing the robustness and sustainability of its financial standing.
Company Must Have Financial Strength
Investing in a company with robust financial strength and a solid balance 
sheet is essential for minimizing risks and ensuring the company’s abil￾ity to withstand economic challenges and market volatility. A financially 
sound company has the necessary resources to overcome setbacks and 
adapt to changing business environments. Moreover, it can seize oppor￾tunities for expansion without overreliance on debt financing, which can 
lead to increased financial risk.
When evaluating a company’s financial strength, it is crucial to con￾sider various financial ratios and metrics. Favor companies with low levels 
of debt and a debt-to-equity ratio that is below the industry average. Low 
debt levels provide a cushion against financial instability and reduce the 
risk of insolvency during economic downturns. Additionally, having suffi￾cient cash reserves and access to lines of credit gives the company the flex￾ibility to execute its growth strategies and navigate unforeseen challenges. 
High return on equity, typically exceeding 15%, is a strong indicator of 
a company’s efficiency and ability to generate profits from shareholders’ 
equity. Healthy profit margins and a cash flow growth rate exceeding the 
earnings growth rate further demonstrate the company’s financial resil￾ience and potential for sustainable growth.
Analyze Financial Statements
When conducting fundamental analysis, it is crucial to analyze the three 
primary financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, and 
statement of cash flows. Each of these statements offers a distinct per￾spective on the company’s financial health and performance, contributing 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 69 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PM70 • Navigating the Stock Market
essential insights to your evaluation. The balance sheet provides a snap￾shot of the company’s financial position at a specific point in time. It reveals 
the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity. Analyzing the 
balance sheet helps assess the company’s liquidity, solvency, and overall 
financial stability. It can reveal the company’s ability to meet short-term 
and long-term obligations and its asset base; including cash, accounts 
receivable, and fixed assets.
The income statement, however, details the company’s revenues, 
expenses, and profitability over a specific period, such as a quarter or 
year. It provides a comprehensive view of the company’s performance, 
showcasing its ability to generate profits and manage costs. Lastly, the 
statement of cash flows traces the inflows and outflows of cash within the 
company, separating them into operating, investing, and financing activi￾ties. This statement is valuable for understanding the company’s cash gen￾eration, capital investments, and sources of funding. By analyzing these 
financial statements, investors can assess a company’s financial health and 
make informed investment decisions.
Determine Financial Performance Trends
When evaluating a company’s financial performance, it is essential to 
assess both its present situation and the trajectory it follows. A company’s 
current financial numbers can appear promising, but their significance 
becomes clearer when considered alongside historical trends. By analyz￾ing the financial data over several years, you can identify whether the 
company’s performance is improving, stable, or deteriorating. It is impor￾tant to not only recognize the trend but also understand the underlying 
factors driving that trend. For instance, if a company’s profits are consist￾ently increasing, you will want to determine whether this growth results 
from effective strategies or temporary circumstances.
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the company’s financial 
health, it is essential to compare its performance with both competitors 
and industry standards. This comparative analysis provides context for 
assessing the company’s relative strengths and weaknesses. By bench￾marking against peers and industry norms, you can identify where the 
company excels and where it may need improvement, contributing to a 
more comprehensive evaluation of its financial performance.
Important Items to Review in Financial Statements
In any thorough financial analysis, several key items within the financial 
statements demand close scrutiny. Starting with the balance sheet, it is 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 70 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 71
crucial to assess the company’s financial strength and stability, with a focus 
on its assets, liabilities, and equity. A strong balance sheet typically exhib￾its ample assets compared to liabilities, indicating a healthy financial posi￾tion. Additionally, a rising trend in revenues reflects the company’s ability 
to generate income consistently, which is essential for sustaining profita￾bility. The net income and EPS figures are vital indicators of a company’s 
profitability and can signal its ability to provide returns to investors.
Cash flow is another critical factor to evaluate, as it reflects the com￾pany’s ability to generate cash from its core operations. A positive cash 
flow demonstrates that the company can effectively manage its finances 
and potentially invest in future growth. Examining profit margins, such as 
gross and operating margins, is essential as well, as they reveal the com￾pany’s efficiency in generating profits. An uptrend in these margins indi￾cates an ability to control costs and maximize profitability. Lastly, R&D 
expenditure can offer insights into a company’s innovation and long-term 
growth potential. A company that consistently invests in R&D may be 
better positioned to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain 
its competitive edge. Conversely, reviewing items like outstanding shares, 
receivables, and inventory levels can help identify any concerning trends, 
while monitoring debt levels for stability or reduction is important to 
ensure manageable financial obligations.
Cash Flow Should Be Healthy
Healthy cash flow is essential for a growth company to sustain and expand 
its operations. It provides the financial flexibility required for investing in 
growth initiatives and navigating through economic downturns. The more 
cash a company generates from its core operations, the better it can man￾age its finances and respond to opportunities and challenges effectively. 
In contrast, poor cash flow can have adverse consequences, potentially 
forcing the company to resort to borrowing or issuing more stock. Both of 
these actions can negatively impact earnings and the earnings per share, 
which, in turn, can affect the stock price.
Analyzing cash flow per share, which is calculated as the cash pro￾vided by operations divided by the total number of outstanding common 
shares, offers valuable insights into the company’s cash flow performance 
on a per-share basis. It is a useful metric for assessing the efficiency of a 
company in generating cash relative to the number of shares available to 
investors. Moreover, if the company’s cash flow growth rate significantly 
surpasses its earnings growth rate, it is generally regarded as a positive 
sign. It indicates that the company is converting a larger portion of its 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 71 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PM72 • Navigating the Stock Market
earnings into cash, which can be used for reinvestment, debt reduction, 
or returning value to shareholders, potentially strengthening its overall 
financial health and outlook.
Debt-to-Equity Ratio Should Be Low
A low debt-to-equity ratio is a favorable sign for a company and its inves￾tors as it signifies that the company relies less on debt financing and has 
a more conservative financial structure. The lower the debt/equity ratio, 
the lower the financial risk associated with the company, making it a safer 
investment. High levels of debt can pose risks, especially during economic 
downturns or periods of financial stress, which could hinder a company’s 
ability to meet its financial obligations and can lead to distress or bank￾ruptcy. Therefore, investors often prefer companies with a low debt/
equity ratio.
When evaluating a company’s debt/equity ratio, it is not only impor￾tant to look at the current ratio but also to examine its trend over time. 
A decreasing debt/equity ratio over the past two to three years or in recent 
quarters is generally seen as a positive sign. It suggests that the company 
is actively managing its debt and working toward a more favorable finan￾cial structure. Furthermore, comparing the company’s debt/equity ratio 
to others in its industry is a valuable benchmark. It should ideally be in 
line with, or even lower than, the industry average, as this reflects prudent 
financial management and reduces financial risk, making the company a 
more attractive investment.
ROE Should Be High
Return on equity is a key financial metric that measures a company’s abil￾ity to generate profits from its shareholders’ equity. A high ROE indicates 
that the company is effectively utilizing the capital invested by sharehold￾ers to generate earnings. For investors, a high ROE is a favorable sign 
as it signifies the company’s efficiency and its potential to provide strong 
returns. When analyzing stock market winners, you will often find a posi￾tive correlation between high ROE and stock market success. Companies 
that consistently deliver a high ROE tend to attract investors and see their 
stock price rise.
A high ROE is a reflection of a company’s ability to manage its assets 
and liabilities effectively, generate profits, and grow its shareholders’ 
equity. It suggests that the company is efficient in producing returns on 
its investments, which is attractive to shareholders. Investors often look 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 72 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 73
for companies with a high ROE as it demonstrates financial health and 
management’s ability to deliver strong returns to its owners. However, it 
is important to consider the industry and sector norms while evaluating 
ROE, as certain industries may naturally have higher or lower ROE based 
on their characteristics.
Return on Sales and Margins Should Be High
Return on sales and profit margins are essential indicators of a company’s 
efficiency and profitability. Return on sales, often referred to as operating 
margin or profit margin, measures the percentage of sales revenue that 
a company converts into profits. A higher return on sales implies that a 
company is managing its operations efficiently, turning a greater portion 
of its revenue into profits. High return on sales is a positive sign for inves￾tors as it indicates strong financial performance.
Profit margins, which include gross margin, operating margin, and 
net profit margin, provide insight into a company’s ability to manage costs 
and generate profits at different stages of its operations. A high profit mar￾gin suggests that the company can maintain healthy profitability levels, 
even in the face of competitive pressures or economic challenges. When 
analyzing potential investments, comparing profit margins across compa￾nies within the same industry can be a useful way to gauge a company’s 
competitive position and profitability relative to its peers. Investors often 
favor companies with high return on sales and profit margins, as these 
metrics reflect a strong ability to convert sales into profits, fueling busi￾ness growth and potential stock price appreciation.
ANALYZE THE INDUSTRY GROUP AND SECTOR
This section discusses how industry groups and sectors should be ana￾lyzed and monitored, as they can significantly impact the performance of 
their constituent companies.
Determine Stock’s Industry Group/Sector
To make informed investment decisions, it is crucial to identify the indus￾try group and sector to which a stock belongs. Stock market analysts 
have categorized companies into various sectors and industry groups to 
facilitate the monitoring, comparison, and analysis of stocks with similar 
characteristics. These groupings help investors understand the broader 
economic environment in which a stock operates, as stocks within the 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 73 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PM74 • Navigating the Stock Market
same group often move in tandem or share similar trends. By determining 
the industry group and sector of your stock, you can gain valuable insights 
into the broader dynamics that may influence its performance.
If your stock belongs to an underperforming industry group, it is less 
likely to outperform the broader market. Conversely, if your stock is part 
of a sector or industry group experiencing strong growth and positive 
trends, it may have better prospects for appreciation. Evaluating a stock 
within the context of its industry and sector can provide essential context 
for your investment analysis and decision-making.
Study the Associated Industry Group and Sector
Studying the associated industry group and sector is essential because it 
provides crucial insights into the broader market dynamics influencing 
a specific stock’s performance. While it is important to thoroughly eval￾uate a company individually, understanding the larger context is equally 
significant. Each company is part of a sector and industry group, and the 
members of these groups often move in tandem over time. For instance, 
if the technology sector is experiencing a positive trend, most technology 
companies will benefit from this tailwind. Conversely, when a sector or 
industry group faces challenges or a downturn, stocks within that group 
may experience downward pressure. Assessing the health and perfor￾mance of the sector and industry group to which a company belongs can 
help you make more informed investment decisions.
By examining the broader context, you can better gauge the poten￾tial for your stock’s future performance. If the sector and industry group 
are flourishing, it can be a favorable sign for the stock’s prospects. 
Conversely, if the broader industry is facing headwinds, it may impact 
the stock’s performance negatively. This holistic approach to analysis 
ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing 
your investment.
Analyze Sector and Industry Group Health and Trend
Analyzing the health and trend of the sector and industry group is a fun￾damental step in assessing the potential for your investment. The success 
or failure of a company is often closely tied to the prospects of its industry 
or sector. If the industry is facing stagnation, intense competition, or obso￾lescence, it can significantly limit the growth potential of your investment. 
Therefore, it is essential to choose stocks that belong to industry groups 
with promising growth prospects and a positive trend.
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 74 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 75
The broader industry context can have a significant impact on your 
stock’s performance. Stocks in sectors and industry groups that are flour￾ishing and in an uptrend are more likely to outperform the market. 
Conversely, stocks in sectors or groups facing challenges may struggle to 
deliver strong returns. By taking into account the health and trend of the 
industry, you can make more informed investment decisions and increase 
your chances of achieving favorable returns.
Analyze Industry-Specific Indicators
Industry-specific indicators provide valuable insights into the performance 
and health of a particular sector or industry. These indicators are tailored 
to the unique characteristics and dynamics of a specific industry, mak￾ing them highly relevant for assessing the prospects of companies within 
that sector. For example, same-store sales figures in the retail industry are 
essential indicators because they directly reflect the consumer demand 
and overall health of the retail sector. Similarly, the semiconductor indus￾try’s book-to-bill ratio is a crucial metric that reveals the industry’s overall 
health and its potential for growth. Understanding these industry-specific 
indicators and their implications is vital for making well-informed invest￾ment decisions.
By using these tailored indicators, investors can gain a deeper under￾standing of the specific factors driving a particular industry and better 
anticipate trends and shifts within that sector. This information allows 
investors to align their investment strategies with the unique dynamics of 
the industry, increasing their ability to make successful investment deci￾sions and navigate the complexities of different sectors more effectively.
VERIFY TECHNICAL AND TRADING INDICATORS 
ARE POSITIVE
In this section, investors are introduced to key technical and trading indi￾cators, which are essential for understanding how they can impact the 
performance of individual stocks as well as the stock market.
Confirm Buy Decision by Using the Moving Average Line
Fundamental analysis provides a solid foundation for making investment 
decisions, focusing on a company’s financial health and business pros￾pects. However, for investors who incorporate technical analysis into their 
strategies, it is important to confirm buy decisions using additional tools 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 75 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PM76 • Navigating the Stock Market
like moving average analysis. This confirmation helps ensure that both the 
fundamental and technical aspects align before making an investment.
One widely used technique in this context is checking whether the 
stock is trading above its 200-day moving average line. This moving 
average serves as a valuable buy signal, indicating that the stock is in an 
uptrend. In cases where the stock is trading below this moving average, 
investors may wait for the stock to cross above the line and confirm a 
change in direction before considering a purchase. By combining fun￾damental and technical analysis and using the 200-day moving average 
as a confirming indicator, investors can make more well-rounded and 
informed investment decisions, enhancing their chances of success in the 
stock market.
Check the Stock Price Relative to Its 50-Day Moving Average
Another valuable technical analysis tool that can provide insights for 
investors is the comparison of a stock’s current price to its 50-day moving 
average. When a stock’s current price is trading above its 50-day moving 
average, it is considered a favorable sign. This situation suggests that the 
stock is on an upward short-term trend, and the majority of investors who 
purchased the stock in the past fifty days are currently in a profitable posi￾tion, reflecting a positive sentiment. In contrast, when the stock price is 
trading below the 50-day moving average, it signifies a more negative sen￾timent among recent investors. These investors are typically underwater 
with their positions, which can lead to a bearish sentiment. Short-term 
traders often use this indicator to assess the current momentum and sen￾timent surrounding a stock.
By analyzing the stock’s relationship with its 50-day moving aver￾age, investors can gain insights into the short-term market sentiment and 
momentum. This information can be helpful in decision-making, espe￾cially for those who engage in shorter-term trading strategies and want to 
align their positions with the prevailing market sentiment.
Confirm That the Stock Is Being Accumulated
Confirming that a stock is under accumulation rather than distribution 
is a critical aspect of technical analysis, especially for those looking to 
invest based on the actions of institutional investors. The accumulation/
distribution indicator serves as a valuable tool to make this determina￾tion. If the stock has an A or B rating on this scale, it is a clear indica￾tion that professionals and institutional investors, such as mutual funds 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 76 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCompany, Industry, and Sector Analysis • 77
and pensions funds, are actively accumulating the stock. Their buying 
actions can drive the stock’s price higher, making it an attractive invest￾ment opportunity.
Conversely, if the accumulation rating is D or E, indicating distribu￾tion, it implies that institutional investors are offloading the stock. This 
trend could exert downward pressure on the stock price. A neutral rating 
of C indicates a balanced situation, with no clear accumulation or distribu￾tion bias. Monitoring this indicator can provide valuable insights into how 
institutional investors are positioning themselves with the stock, helping 
investors make informed decisions and potentially align their strategies 
with the professionals’ actions in the market.
Confirm That the Stock Has Liquidity
Liquidity is a critical factor to consider when investing in stocks. Investors 
want to have the ability to buy or sell their positions with ease, particularly 
in a fast-moving and sometimes unpredictable market. Inadequate liquid￾ity can pose significant challenges when trading a stock. A thinly traded 
stock with low daily trading volume may become especially problematic 
during times of market volatility or in the event of a broader market sell￾off. In such situations, selling even a modest number of shares could be 
challenging, and the sale might only occur at significantly lower prices, 
resulting in substantial losses.
Additionally, during extreme market conditions or crashes, thinly 
traded stocks may not find buyers at all, leaving investors with illiquid 
positions that are difficult to exit. To mitigate these risks, investors should 
avoid stocks with insufficient liquidity, typically defined by a daily trading 
volume of less than 200,000 shares. Ensuring that a stock has a reasonable 
level of liquidity can provide a level of confidence that investors will have 
the flexibility to buy or sell shares as needed, even under adverse market 
conditions.
Evaluate Trading Risks
When evaluating a stock for investment, it is crucial to assess the trad￾ing risks associated with it. The level of institutional ownership can be 
a significant factor. If a large portion of the outstanding stock is held by 
large institutions, particularly in the case of a small company, it can limit 
the stock’s upside price appreciation potential. High institutional owner￾ship makes the stock more vulnerable to price swings if one or two insti￾tutions decide to sell their holdings. Such concentrated selling can lead 
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 77 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PM78 • Navigating the Stock Market
to significant price drops, posing a risk to investors. It is important to 
exercise caution and thoroughly consider the implications of high institu￾tional ownership before investing in such a stock, especially if there isn’t a 
compelling reason to do so.
Alternatively, if the institutional ownership of a stock falls within the 
range of 25%–50%, it can be viewed as a positive sign. This indicates a 
healthy level of institutional interest without the concentrated ownership 
that could lead to rapid price fluctuations. Furthermore, investors should 
closely examine the stock’s float and daily trading volume. Inadequate 
liquidity can result in difficulties when buying or selling shares, particu￾larly during periods of market volatility, making it essential to assess these 
risks before making an investment decision.
NSM_CH04_2pp.indd 78 1/23/2024 5:13:03 PMCHAPTER
WHY SELLING IS A COMMON PROBLEM
This section discusses the various challenges investors often face when 
deciding to sell a stock, unraveling insights to overcome common hurdles 
and optimize selling decisions for a successful investment journey.
Selling Strategy Is Lacking
An essential aspect of successful stock market investing is the implementa￾tion of a well-defined selling strategy. While many investors are proficient 
at selecting and buying stocks, they often neglect the crucial component 
of knowing when and how to sell. A robust selling strategy is as vital as a 
buying strategy, and investors should understand both aspects to thrive in 
the stock market. Without a clear selling strategy, selling decisions may be 
guided by irrational emotions, hunches, or reactions to external events, 
which can lead to poor outcomes. 
Investors need to develop and adhere to their selling strategy to maintain 
a disciplined approach to managing their investments. This strategy should 
be based on predefined criteria that help determine when to sell a stock. 
Whether it involves setting specific price targets, using technical indicators, 
or reacting to fundamental changes in the company, having a well-thought￾out selling plan can protect and optimize investment portfolios, preventing 
investors from making impulsive decisions that may lead to losses.
Inability to Acknowledge Mistakes
Acknowledging and addressing mistakes is a fundamental aspect of wise 
investing. Even the most skilled and experienced investors can make 
Selling
5
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 79 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PM80 • Navigating the Stock Market
errors, and the critical difference lies in how they handle these mistakes. 
It is not the act of making a mistake that poses the most significant chal￾lenge but rather the inability to admit when one has picked a losing invest￾ment. Successful investing entails promptly recognizing and taking action 
to mitigate the impact of errors on one’s portfolio. The refusal to accept a 
mistake and trying to rationalize it as a sound, long-term investment can 
lead to compounding losses, hindering overall portfolio performance.
A prudent approach involves establishing clear criteria for exiting a 
losing investment and adhering to these parameters. Whether it is a pre￾defined stop–loss level, specific fundamental changes in the company, or 
a technical indicator signaling a downturn, investors must have a plan in 
place to cut their losses. Accepting mistakes as part of the investment 
process and proactively addressing them can help investors protect their 
capital and preserve their long-term financial goals.
Loss Definition Is Vague
Defining what constitutes a loss is a crucial aspect of an effective selling strat￾egy. There are multiple interpretations of a loss, such as when unrealized 
profits turn into a loss or when there is an actual loss based on the purchase 
price. Investors should establish a clear and consistent method for defining 
losses, and this method should be outlined in their selling rules. To prevent 
ambiguity and emotional decision-making, these rules should be rigorously 
enforced. For instance, a common approach could be selling if a stock 
experiences a 20% pullback from its peak or if the purchase-price-based 
loss exceeds 8%. Regardless of the chosen basis for defining a loss, it is 
imperative not to procrastinate when it becomes evident that a stock has 
become a losing investment with dim prospects for price appreciation.
By setting unambiguous criteria and adhering to them, investors can 
make objective decisions about when to sell a stock, reducing the risk 
of emotional attachment and subjective judgments. A well-defined strat￾egy for recognizing and addressing losses ensures that investments are 
managed in a disciplined and rational manner, which can lead to better 
portfolio outcomes over the long term.
Not Knowing When to Exit
It is essential for investors to recognize that no stock should be consid￾ered a permanent fixture in their portfolio. Every stock, whether it is 
performing well or poorly, should have a defined exit strategy. Knowing 
when to sell a stock is a vital component of an investment strategy, driven 
by factors like profit-taking, risk management, or the need for portfolio 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 80 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PMSelling • 81
diversification. A fundamental rule in this regard is the practice of cut￾ting losses, as this should be a cornerstone of the overall plan for wealth 
growth in the stock market. By adhering to loss-cutting rules, investors 
protect their capital and maintain a disciplined approach, aiming to mini￾mize the impact of inevitable setbacks.
It is important to understand that, even in the presence of numer￾ous small losses, a few substantial winning investments can significantly 
outweigh those losses, providing a net positive result. This principle rein￾forces the significance of a sound selling strategy that incorporates risk 
management measures, helping investors remain consistent and avoid 
making emotional decisions when it comes to selling stocks.
PLAN AND BE READY TO SELL
This section discusses how to plan and be prepared to sell a stock, so that 
selling is done by choice and is not a forced decision.
Avoid Forced Selling
Investors should be vigilant to avoid being pushed into a position where 
they are compelled to sell a stock hastily. The choice to sell should remain 
firmly within the control of the investor and not driven by external or 
reactionary factors. A well-defined strategy with established selling rules 
is essential in mitigating the chances of forced selling. Such a strategic 
approach helps in making consistent decisions rather than being subject 
to emotional or impulsive actions.
Investors should also be cautious not to allow external circumstances, 
such as immediate financial needs, to dictate their selling decisions. 
Allowing such external pressures to influence selling choices can lead to 
financial losses. Therefore, individuals should only invest in the stock mar￾ket with funds they can afford to allocate for a more extended investment 
horizon. When financial needs or liquidity requirements are imminent, 
alternative financial instruments should be utilized instead of relying on 
stock market investments to meet those demands. This distinction helps 
to ensure that an investor’s stock portfolio remains driven by their invest￾ment goals and strategy, rather than external urgencies.
Select a Selling Strategy
Having a well-defined selling strategy is paramount in managing a stock 
portfolio effectively. This strategy should encompass a comprehensive 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 81 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PM82 • Navigating the Stock Market
plan for various scenarios that may arise over time, covering aspects such 
as cutting losses, taking profits (both short-term and long-term), and the 
disposition of long-term winning stocks. The absence of a specific strategy 
can leave investors ill-prepared to respond effectively to market fluctu￾ations and stock-specific developments. In contrast, a carefully crafted 
strategy equips investors with the necessary tools to make informed 
buy/sell decisions, whether it involves adding to existing positions or sell￾ing during unexpected price declines.
Moreover, a robust selling strategy helps investors maintain discipline 
and avoid emotional or hasty decisions. It acts as a compass, guiding them 
through turbulent market conditions and protecting them from the risks 
associated with sudden market swings. By adhering to a pre-established 
strategy, investors can navigate the stock market with greater confidence 
and stay focused on their long-term financial goals.
Establish and Adhere to a Price Target
Setting and adhering to price targets is a crucial aspect of any success￾ful stock investment strategy. These price targets serve as guidelines for 
managing a stock position effectively and are instrumental in determining 
when to buy, sell, or hold. By establishing clear price targets for potential 
loss-selling, short-term profit-taking, and long-term profit-taking, inves￾tors can enhance their decision-making process and proactively protect 
their investments.
The use of limit “sell orders” is a practical means of implementing 
these price targets. These orders are executed only if the stock reaches a 
specified price, allowing investors to automate the selling process when 
predefined conditions are met. This not only helps maintain discipline but 
also mitigates the impact of emotional decision-making. Regularly eval￾uating a stock’s performance in light of these price targets ensures that 
investors remain focused on the stock’s fundamentals and overall market 
conditions. In times of bull markets, being open to raising the target price 
can be particularly advantageous, provided the underlying reasons for the 
stock’s rise remain strong. However, in bear markets, investors should 
exercise caution and avoid hastily adjusting their price targets.
List Specific Reasons for Buying a Stock
Maintaining a record of specific reasons for buying a stock and setting 
performance expectations is a prudent practice that can help investors 
stay disciplined and methodical in their investment approach. These 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 82 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PMSelling • 83
records serve as a reminder of the investment thesis and criteria used 
when purchasing the stock. Regularly reviewing this list and comparing it 
to the current state of the stock is a crucial step in managing one’s port￾folio effectively. If the initial reasons for buying the stock are no longer 
valid, investors should be prepared to make objective decisions and, if 
necessary, sell the stock. For example, if the stock was initially chosen due 
to its projected 25% earnings growth, but the company’s earnings growth 
falls below that target, this disciplined approach would dictate selling the 
stock. This strategy ensures that investment decisions are based on realis￾tic assessments rather than unwarranted optimism or emotions.
By establishing these clear criteria and enforcing them unemotionally, 
investors can protect their portfolios and make informed decisions. This 
practice helps avoid “hope-based” investing and emphasizes the impor￾tance of staying true to a well-defined investment strategy. It encourages 
investors to adhere to the principles and rationale that guided them when 
buying the stock, ensuring that their investments are aligned with their 
original objectives.
Manage Your Losers
Managing losing stocks is an integral part of investment strategy. Investors 
need to develop effective ways to address such situations. When faced 
with a losing stock, the first step is to conduct a comprehensive analysis 
of the reasons behind the stock’s decline or lack of price appreciation. 
Understanding the root causes helps in making an informed decision 
regarding whether to sell, hold, or possibly buy more of the stock. This 
process should be objective and based on facts rather than emotions. 
If the losses are too substantial and selling the stock is unlikely to gen￾erate significant proceeds or reallocate resources efficiently, it may not 
be advantageous to sell. In such cases, a decision to continue holding the 
stock can be considered.
If the fundamentals of the company remain strong and the decline 
appears temporary, dollar-cost averaging is a strategy to contemplate. It 
involves purchasing additional shares of the stock at a lower price, thereby 
lowering the average cost of the investment and potentially improving 
the overall position as the stock’s price recovers. This approach should be 
undertaken with a clear understanding of the company’s prospects and 
should be a part of a well-defined investment strategy. The key is to take 
an objective, disciplined approach when dealing with losing stocks and 
ensure that every decision is driven by a thorough analysis of the situation 
rather than emotional reactions.
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 83 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PM84 • Navigating the Stock Market
Recognize When Avoiding Selling Is Not a Mistake
While selling is a critical aspect of investment strategy, there are scenarios where 
avoiding or delaying selling can be a prudent decision. One such instance is 
when widespread pessimism surrounds a stock. Sometimes, market sentiment 
can become overly negative, which may lead to undervaluation of fundamen￾tally strong companies. If an investor recognizes the pessimism as unwarranted 
and the stock’s core fundamentals remain intact, holding the position or even 
accumulating more shares could be beneficial in the long term.
Another situation arises when a stock has appreciated significantly 
and appears “overvalued.” Overvaluation can be misleading, especially 
if the company’s earnings growth prospects and market conditions jus￾tify the high valuation. In such cases, it might be wise to reevaluate the 
stock’s intrinsic value and hold onto it if it remains fundamentally strong. 
Similarly, if a stock reaches its price target, but the company’s funda￾mentals continue to improve and support a higher valuation, it may be 
worthwhile to adjust the price target and maintain the position. High 
P/E ratios may signal overvaluation, but if the stock is a proven winner 
and market conditions are favorable, holding the position might lead to 
further gains. Other scenarios, such as institutional selling or temporary 
price declines that don’t undermine the initial reasons for buying, can 
also justify avoiding hasty selling decisions and taking a more measured 
approach to managing the position. Ultimately, these situations require a 
thorough assessment of the stock’s fundamentals and market dynamics to 
determine the best course of action.
PRIMARY REASONS FOR SELLING
This section provides strategic clarity pertaining to the key factors driving 
the decision to sell stocks, empowering investors with a nuanced under￾standing to make informed and profitable decisions pertaining to their 
stock portfolios.
Fundamentals Are Deteriorating
When a stock’s fundamentals start to deteriorate, it is essential to prior￾itize this as the primary reason for selling. Fundamental analysis should 
guide your investment decisions, and if you observe any signs that can 
materially affect a company’s future earnings or growth, such as a signif￾icant slowdown in earnings or revenue growth, taking immediate action 
is crucial. Selling a stock that exhibits signs of weakening fundamentals 
helps to protect your portfolio from potential losses.
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 84 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PMSelling • 85
In some cases, the stock price might experience a decline, but it is 
essential to differentiate between market-driven factors like overall mar￾ket weakness, a correction, or normal fluctuations and fundamental issues 
within the company. If the stock’s decline can be directly attributed to 
fundamental reasons, it is advisable to sell the stock promptly. However, 
it is important not to rush into selling when the stock price dips due to 
broader market conditions or when it follows a substantial upward move, 
as these situations may not necessarily indicate fundamental problems 
with the company. Careful assessment and discernment between mar￾ket-driven fluctuations and genuine fundamental issues are vital when 
determining the appropriate course of action for your investment.
Interest Rate Trend Changes
Changes in the interest rate trend can have significant implications for 
the stock market and your investment strategy. Monitoring interest rates 
is essential because they can influence the overall market sentiment. If 
you observe a shift in the interest rate trend, particularly if it is moving 
upward, it is considered a negative sign for the stock market. In response 
to rising interest rates, it is advisable to reduce your exposure to stocks or 
consider reallocating your investments to favor companies that are less 
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
Specifically, keeping an eye on key interest rate indicators like the fed￾eral funds rate and the discount rate is crucial. When the Federal Reserve 
initiates an interest rate hike cycle by increasing these rates, it generally 
has a negative impact on the stock market. A widely accepted principle on 
Wall Street is that stock markets tend to decline after the Federal Reserve 
raises interest rates three times. Furthermore, if the short-term interest 
rates exceed long-term interest rates, it should be regarded as a signif￾icant warning sign, signaling potential economic challenges and poten￾tially negative consequences for stocks. Staying informed and prepared 
to adjust your investment strategy in response to interest rate trends is 
essential for safeguarding your portfolio.
Financials Are Deteriorating
Assessing a company’s financial health is a crucial part of your investment 
strategy. A company that is not financially sound faces a precarious future. 
Financial constraints can severely limit its ability to expand, make stra￾tegic decisions, or react to market changes effectively. In such circum￾stances, the company may be compelled to take on additional debt, which 
can lead to even more financial difficulties and pose risks to shareholders. 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 85 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PM86 • Navigating the Stock Market
Therefore, if you observe that a company’s financials are deteriorating 
or its business prospects are waning, it is prudent to consider selling the 
stock.
Deteriorating financials can manifest in various ways, such as declin￾ing revenues, shrinking profit margins, increasing debt levels, or decreas￾ing cash reserves. Paying close attention to these key financial indicators is 
essential in your decision-making process, as it can help you avoid poten￾tial losses and make informed choices when it comes to managing your 
stock portfolio.
Earnings Growth Is Disappointing
Earnings growth is a fundamental driver of stock performance, and when 
a company consistently falls short of expectations in this regard, it should 
be taken as a strong warning signal. If you notice that a company’s earnings 
have declined for two consecutive quarters or that the rate of quarterly 
earnings growth has slowed significantly, it is essential to investigate the 
underlying reasons. These can range from internal management issues 
to external market conditions or competitive pressures. Understanding 
the root causes of disappointing earnings is crucial before making a sell 
decision.
While disappointing earnings can trigger concerns, it’s equally impor￾tant to differentiate between one-time events and ongoing issues. If a 
thorough investigation reveals that the company’s failure to meet earn￾ings expectations is due to a specific, nonrecurring event, and there is 
a reasonable expectation that future growth will align with forecasts, it 
may be premature to sell the stock. However, if there are structural issues 
that indicate a continued struggle to meet earnings targets, a sell deci￾sion could be warranted. Staying vigilant and informed about a company’s 
earnings performance is essential for making sound investment decisions.
Loss Exceeds a Predetermined Percentage
One of the most common and disciplined reasons for selling a stock is 
when the loss on that stock exceeds a predetermined percentage, typically 
a maximum allowable loss set by the investor, often around 10%. This 
rule helps to enforce discipline and ensures that emotions, which can lead 
to significant losses or delayed selling, are not allowed to influence the 
decision-making process. Even though there might be various reasons to 
justify holding onto the stock, adhering to these rules is critical to main￾tain a structured and rational approach to investing. While there might 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 86 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PMSelling • 87
be instances when you decide to make exceptions to this rule, it is advis￾able to closely monitor the stock and place a lower mental stop, never to 
be violated, a few percentage points below the original predetermined 
number if this rule is relaxed.
In addition to the emotional aspects, setting a predetermined max￾imum loss also serves as a risk management tool to protect your capi￾tal. It ensures that you do not expose your portfolio to excessive risk and 
prevents any single stock’s loss from significantly impacting your overall 
investment performance. Consistency in applying this rule can help you 
maintain discipline and mitigate the negative effects of large losses in your 
portfolio.
Price Action Is Negative
A declining stock price should not be a sole reason to rush into selling. 
In fact, it is common for stocks to experience normal pullbacks or fluc￾tuations, and these should be approached with caution and further eval￾uation. When a stock declines, it is important to thoroughly assess the 
situation to ascertain whether the decline is due to fundamental issues 
or external market conditions. Fundamental weakness, deteriorating 
business prospects, or unexpected events should be closely examined as 
potential causes for the decline.
However, if the stock’s price continues to fall and enters a clear 
downtrend, particularly if this extends beyond the maximum allowable 
loss set by the investor, it may be prudent to consider selling the stock. A 
sustained decline without any meaningful rallies can serve as a warning 
sign, suggesting that the stock’s prospects may not be favorable. Investors 
should keep a close eye on the stock’s price action and have predefined 
rules for selling in place to make rational and unemotional decisions when 
confronted with a stock in a prolonged downward trend. This approach 
can help to prevent the negative impact of significant losses and protect 
the overall performance of the investment portfolio.
Profit Taking
Profit taking is a common practice among both traders and long-term 
investors. For traders, it often involves capitalizing on short-term price 
increases, where they sell a stock after a quick uptick in price to secure 
a profit. However, even long-term investors engage in profit-taking, but 
their approach typically revolves around realizing capital gains after a 
stock has experienced substantial appreciation. In such cases, investors 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 87 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PM88 • Navigating the Stock Market
decide to sell stocks that have shown a significant increase in value over 
an extended holding period. Additionally, modest profit-taking is common 
among investors who have held their stocks for different time frames and 
decide to sell to capture moderate capital gains.
The decision to engage in profit taking can be influenced by various 
factors, including individual financial goals, market conditions, and the 
stock’s performance. Whether it is realizing quick gains from trading activi￾ties or securing profits from long-term investments, profit-taking strategies 
can play a crucial role in managing an investment portfolio effectively.
Stock Buying Reasons No Longer Exist
Disciplined investors follow a structured approach by keeping a record of the 
specific reasons for buying a particular stock. This meticulous practice allows 
them to periodically reassess the stock’s investment thesis in light of the cur￾rent market conditions. If it is evident that the primary reasons behind their 
initial investment decision no longer hold, they make the rational choice to 
sell the stock. For example, if an investor initially purchased a stock with 
the expectation of a 30% earnings growth rate, but that rate subsequently 
decreases to 20%, serious consideration should be given to selling the stock.
To maintain an analytical and unemotional approach to decision-mak￾ing, it is important to maintain a record of the factors that influenced the 
purchase of each stock at the time of acquisition. This disciplined approach 
helps investors avoid clinging to stocks based on outdated or irrelevant 
rationales and ensures that investment decisions remain grounded in real￾ity. As market conditions evolve and stock performance fluctuates, the 
ability to adapt and respond based on the latest data is critical for main￾taining a successful investment portfolio.
Market Is Giving a Strong Sell Signal
Recognizing market signals and the overall health of the stock market is 
crucial for investors to make informed decisions about their stock holdings. 
When the broader market starts to show signs of weakness, it is common 
for most stocks, including previous winners, to be negatively affected. In 
response to this, investors often opt to reduce their exposure to stocks as 
a precautionary measure. Several key sell signals can be observed in the 
market, which indicate that a market top or a looming bear market may 
be on the horizon. These include a notable change in the market’s direc￾tion accompanied by heavy trading volume and the underperformance or 
weakening of market leaders on rising trading volume.
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 88 2/6/2024 6:38:43 PMSelling • 89
Another strong sell signal occurs when the market experiences dis￾tribution for several days within a two-week period, suggesting that pro￾fessional investors are selling off their holdings, which should prompt 
investors to consider reducing their equity exposure. Furthermore, if 
leading stocks in the market begin to falter and many of the declining 
stocks maintain high relative strength, typically with RS ranks above 80, 
it is a negative signal for the overall market and may serve as a warning 
for investors to take a cautious approach. In such instances, selling stocks 
or lightening up on positions can help investors safeguard their portfolios 
from potential market downturns.
SECONDARY REASONS FOR SELLING
This section dissects additional factors influencing stock divestment, pro￾viding investors with a comprehensive toolkit to navigate the intricacies of 
decision-making for optimal portfolio management.
Better Prospect Is Identified
One common reason for switching stocks is the identification of a better 
investment opportunity. The primary goal of investing is to identify stocks 
that have the potential to appreciate in value over time. When an investor 
identifies a stock that offers significantly better price appreciation pros￾pects compared to their current holdings, it makes sense to switch to this 
new opportunity. By switching to a stock with superior potential for price 
growth, investors can optimize their portfolio’s returns and capture the 
benefits of a more promising investment.
Another rationale for switching stocks is to manage and reduce the 
level of risk in one’s portfolio. There are situations where investors may 
need to adjust their portfolio to achieve a lower level of risk exposure. 
In such cases, investors can choose to switch to a comparable stock that 
carries less risk. This strategic shift allows them to reallocate their invest￾ments and bring their overall portfolio risk within acceptable limits. 
Reducing risk exposure is an essential component of managing a diversi￾fied portfolio and ensuring a balanced risk-return profile.
Stock Is a Laggard
Investors often have specific expectations and investment goals when 
they allocate their capital to a particular stock. These expectations may 
be based on a variety of factors, including the stock’s financial health, 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 89 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PM90 • Navigating the Stock Market
earnings prospects, and market conditions. It is important to provide a 
stock with a reasonable amount of time, typically six to eighteen months, 
to perform and meet these expectations. During this period, investors 
assess whether the stock is achieving the anticipated results.
However, if the stock turns out to be a laggard and fails to meet the 
expected performance within the given time frame, it may be time to con￾sider selling the stock. A laggard is a stock that underperforms, even in the 
presence of favorable factors such as strong earnings and positive news. It is 
a reminder of a fundamental principle known to seasoned investors: A good 
company does not necessarily translate into a good stock. In such cases, selling 
the stock allows investors to reallocate their capital to more promising oppor￾tunities and ensure that their investments align with their financial goals.
Sector Leaders Crumble
When stocks within a specific industry group or sector experience a col￾lective decline, it is often an indicator of broader market trends. The 
performance of stocks within the same industry group or sector tends to 
be correlated, and their movements are influenced by similar macroeco￾nomic factors. Therefore, if the sector leaders begin to falter and show 
signs of weakness without a substantial recovery or a clear trigger, it can 
be an early warning signal that other stocks within the sector may be neg￾atively affected in the near future. Investors should closely monitor the 
situation to assess the reasons behind the sector’s underperformance.
The severity of the decline and the cause should be carefully eval￾uated to determine the appropriate course of action. This may involve 
reassessing selling options, particularly if the downturn is significant or if 
it is driven by factors that could have lasting repercussions. By closely fol￾lowing the market and sector leaders, investors can make informed deci￾sions to protect their investments and adjust their portfolios accordingly.
Company Is Relying on Laurels and Historical Performance
In the stock market, historical performance is important to some extent, 
as it can provide insights into a company’s track record and management’s 
ability to deliver results. However, investors should remember that past 
success does not guarantee future performance. The stock market places 
a significant emphasis on a company’s future prospects and its ability to 
adapt and evolve. If a company becomes complacent and relies too heav￾ily on its historical achievements, it may find itself struggling to meet the 
demands and challenges of a rapidly changing business environment.
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 90 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PMSelling • 91
Companies that rest on their laurels, cut back on R&D, and fail to 
innovate can quickly lose their competitive edge. To make informed 
investment decisions, focus on businesses that are forward-thinking, con￾tinuously investing in R&D, and positioning themselves for future growth. 
It is essential to consider a company’s future potential and its capacity to 
adapt to evolving market conditions rather than dwelling solely on its past 
accomplishments.
Institutions Are Dumping
Institutional activity in the stock market carries substantial weight and 
can significantly influence the direction of individual stocks and market 
indexes. When institutions begin to offload their positions, it often signals 
that professional money managers with extensive resources and research 
capabilities see fundamental weaknesses or anticipate adverse market 
conditions. As an individual investor, observing institutional selling pat￾terns can serve as a strong sell signal, especially if you witness consistent 
distribution days within a relatively short timeframe. A distribution day 
occurs when a stock or market index experiences a price decline accompa￾nied by unusually high trading volume. Multiple distribution days within 
a condensed period suggest that large institutional players are unloading 
shares, which may lead to further price declines.
By keeping a close watch on such institutional behavior, you can make 
informed selling decisions to protect your investments. While not all sell￾offs are driven by deteriorating fundamentals, a sudden and persistent 
surge in institutional selling should be regarded as a red flag, prompting 
you to reconsider your position and possibly take action to mitigate losses 
or reallocate your investment capital elsewhere.
Company Overpaid for an Acquisition
Mergers and acquisitions can be a strategic move for a company to 
expand its business and market share, and Wall Street often responds 
positively to such announcements. However, the success of an acqui￾sition largely depends on the price paid and the impact on the acquir￾ing company’s financial health. When a company pays too much for an 
acquisition, it can lead to a slew of financial and operational challenges. 
The excessive acquisition cost can weigh on the company’s financial 
statements, affecting its earnings, cash flow, and debt levels. Investors 
typically react negatively to these developments, and it can have lasting 
consequences for the stock.
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 91 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PM92 • Navigating the Stock Market
In such cases, even if the stock’s price doesn’t plummet dramatically, 
it often experiences limited price depreciation in the aftermath of the 
costly acquisition. As investors become wary of the company’s financial 
situation and management decisions, they may decide to divest their hold￾ings, putting downward pressure on the stock. Therefore, as an investor, it 
is essential to monitor the impact of acquisitions on a company’s financials 
and its stock’s performance and consider selling if you believe that the 
acquisition was poorly executed or too expensive.
Portfolio Needs to Be Pruned
Portfolio pruning is a crucial aspect of managing your investments effec￾tively. As stocks appreciate in value, their weighting in your portfolio can 
grow beyond your desired allocation. This shift can result in an unbalanced 
and riskier portfolio. To maintain the desired risk-reward profile, investors 
periodically need to prune their portfolios by selling some shares of stocks 
that have appreciated significantly. This action not only helps you adhere to 
your portfolio allocation targets but also allows you to lock in profits.
Additionally, the periodic evaluation and pruning of your portfolio 
are essential to enhance its overall performance. Removing underper￾forming or stagnant stocks from your holdings can free up capital to invest 
in more promising opportunities. This proactive approach can help boost 
the overall returns of your portfolio in the long run. When considering 
which stocks to prune, it is advisable to start with the losers, selling those 
positions that have not performed well or have declined in value. You 
can also sell stocks with modest profits or those that no longer meet your 
investment expectations to make room for more promising investments. 
By continuously evaluating and pruning your portfolio, you can keep it 
well-aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
Tax Reasons
Tax considerations are often a significant factor in investment decisions, 
particularly at year-end. Selling underperforming or losing stocks can help 
offset the capital gains generated by selling winning stocks, thus reducing 
the overall tax liability. This strategy allows investors to maintain a more 
tax-efficient investment portfolio by taking advantage of capital losses to 
mitigate the tax consequences of capital gains. Investors typically execute 
this tax-loss harvesting strategy towards the end of the year when they 
have a clearer understanding of their tax situation.
When deciding to sell a winning stock for tax reasons at the end of 
the year, it can be beneficial to defer the actual sale until the beginning 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 92 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PMSelling • 93
of the new year. This deferral allows investors to delay the tax liability 
associated with capital gains, taking advantage of the time value of money. 
By deferring the tax payment, investors can potentially earn returns on 
the funds they would otherwise have used to settle their tax bill, which 
can enhance the overall performance of their investment portfolio. It is 
essential to work closely with a tax advisor or accountant to ensure that 
your investment decisions align with your tax and financial planning goals.
TECHNICAL REASONS FOR SELLING
This section discusses how technical indicators can be used to identify 
stocks that need to be sold, fostering a proactive and informed approach 
to stock investing.
Moving Average Uptrend Turns Into a Downtrend
The moving average trend analysis is a valuable tool for investors, as it 
provides insights into the stock’s long-term and short-term performance. 
A stock trading above its 200-day moving average is seen as being in a 
bullish long-term uptrend, signaling potential investment opportunities. 
Conversely, when a stock falls below its 200-day moving average, it signi￾fies a reversal in the long-term trend, indicating a bearish phase. However, 
it is crucial not to act immediately on this bearish signal because stock 
prices can be subject to fluctuations, and a move below the moving aver￾age may not necessarily lead to a sustained downtrend. Investors should 
wait for confirmation and assess the stock’s price movement to make an 
informed decision.
The 50-day moving average is another useful indicator for traders and 
provides insights into the stock’s short-term trend. If a stock falls below its 
50-day moving average, it is considered bearish, signaling potential short￾term selling pressure. Just like with the 200-day moving average, investors 
should exercise caution when considering this signal and look for further 
price confirmation before making any sell decisions. These moving aver￾age trends should be incorporated into a comprehensive analysis of a 
stock’s fundamentals and technicals to ensure well-informed investment 
choices.
Volume Indicator Is Negative
Analyzing trading volume is a crucial aspect of evaluating a stock or mar￾ket average’s price action. The relationship between price and volume 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 93 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PM94 • Navigating the Stock Market
can provide valuable insights into the strength or weakness of a particular 
move. When a stock experiences a notable price decline, and this drop 
occurs on heavy or abnormal volume, it is often considered a bearish sig￾nal. High-volume sell-offs indicate that significant selling pressure is in 
play, which can potentially lead to further price declines. Investors should 
closely monitor such price drops and evaluate their positions in light of 
this negative volume indicator.
However, when a stock achieves a new price high but does so with 
low trading volume, it is viewed with skepticism. This suggests that the 
strength behind the price advance is limited, as it lacks substantial investor 
participation. Furthermore, situations involving churning, where there is 
heavy trading activity without significant price appreciation, should raise 
caution. Such scenarios may indicate that traders are actively moving 
shares back and forth without causing substantial price movement, signa￾ling an uncertain and potentially unsustainable market trend.
Distribution Is Recognized
Recognizing distribution, particularly when large institutions are offload￾ing stocks, is a crucial aspect of smart investment decision-making. The 
actions of institutional investors, often referred to as the “smart money,” 
can significantly impact stock prices and market trends. One effective 
method to identify distribution is by examining the accumulation/dis￾tribution rating, provided by many financial analysis tools. If this rating 
drops to D or E, it typically indicates a phase of distribution, implying 
that institutions are selling their holdings. This is a clear sell signal for 
investors who need to be attentive to these rating changes.
In addition to the accumulation/distribution rating, shifts in the num￾ber of down days versus up days in price changes can also serve as a distri￾bution indicator. When a stock starts to decline, an increase in the number 
of down days can be a warning sign, suggesting that institutions may be 
disposing of their holdings. Furthermore, if the price drop is more signif￾icant than a typical correction (e.g., 10%–12% from a peak), it may indi￾cate substantial selling pressure from institutions. Investors should closely 
monitor these distribution signs as they can provide valuable insights into 
market dynamics and help in making timely selling decisions.
Price Performance Is Negative
Price performance is a crucial aspect of stock analysis, and it can offer val￾uable insights into the stock’s overall health and potential sell signals. One 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 94 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PMSelling • 95
such signal is the breach of the stock’s support level. The support level 
represents a price point at which the stock typically finds buying interest 
and reverses its downward movement. If the stock’s support level fails, it’s 
often an indication of increased selling pressure and can be interpreted as 
a sell signal. Investors should pay attention to this development, especially 
in a rising market, as it may suggest a weakening position for the stock.
Another important indicator is the relative strength rank. If the RS 
rank falls below 70, particularly during a period of market strength, it can 
be considered a sell signal. A declining RS rank indicates that the stock 
is underperforming compared to the broader market or its peers. This 
underperformance can signify reduced investor interest and potential 
price weakness. Additionally, assessing the group strength, or the perfor￾mance of the stock’s industry or sector, is crucial. If the stock appears to 
be moving independently and the group’s strength is weak, it is a negative 
sign. Stocks tend to perform better when they are supported by a robust 
group, so a stock’s ability to sustain gains may be compromised if it lacks 
group participation. These price performance indicators serve as impor￾tant guides for investors in making well-informed sell decisions.
Stock Is Overextended
The overextension of a stock’s price can be a cause for concern, particu￾larly for those who utilize technical analysis in their trading strategies. 
In an ideal scenario, a stock should experience a gradual and sustainable 
increase in price. When a stock rises too rapidly or to a level significantly 
above its moving average lines, it becomes vulnerable to a potential pull￾back or correction. This overextension increases the probability of a price 
decline, which is why technical analysts often recommend considering 
a sell decision when a stock is overextended, typically when its approxi￾mately 70%–100% above its 200-day moving average line. This guideline 
serves as a warning sign that the stock may be due for a correction, and 
selling in this situation can help protect gains or mitigate potential losses.
Additionally, technical analysts look at the stock’s relationship with 
its short-term moving averages, such as the 50-day moving average. If a 
stock closes significantly above its 50-day moving average or surges above 
its upper channel line, it can trigger a sell evaluation. These situations 
often signal that the stock’s price has become stretched and may be due 
for a pullback or a period of consolidation. While these indicators may 
not always lead to immediate declines, they serve as cautionary signals 
to investors to reevaluate their positions and consider selling if the stock 
appears overextended.

SELL SIGNALS FOR SMALL COMPANIES WITH FEW 
OR NICHE PRODUCTS
This section navigates the unique challenges of smaller enterprises, uncov￾ering specific indicators and signals that prompt strategic selling decisions 
for optimal risk management in the dynamic stock market landscape.
Earnings Growth Rate Decreases Significantly
Companies with small growth profiles are often associated with high inves￾tor expectations. These firms typically command high P/E ratios because 
investors anticipate rapid earnings and revenue growth. The more signif￾icant the expected growth, the higher the P/E ratio investors are willing 
to afford the stock. When a company’s earnings growth rate decreases 
significantly, it can create a misalignment between the high P/E ratio and 
the reduced growth prospects, making the stock appear overvalued. To 
restore a balance between the stock’s valuation and its growth outlook, its 
price may need to decline. Consequently, a substantial decrease in earn￾ings growth rate serves as a potent sell signal for such companies.
A notable drop in earnings growth signifies that the company may not 
be living up to the previously set high expectations. This situation often 
leads to a reevaluation of the stock’s price, with investors potentially decid￾ing to sell. It is important to remember that stock prices are influenced by 
earnings performance. Therefore, when growth prospects diminish, inves￾tors tend to reassess their holdings, which can result in selling pressure as 
they seek to align stock prices with the new, lower growth expectations.
Business Conditions Change
The business environment in which a small, niche products company 
operates can be particularly sensitive to changes. The entry of a new, well￾funded competitor into the market can significantly disrupt the business 
landscape and erode market share, leading to potential losses for the com￾pany. As a result, any change that carries the potential to impact the compa￾ny’s operations and future business prospects should be carefully assessed.
Rapidly losing market share over a short period or for two consecutive 
years should be regarded as a strong sell signal for a small growth company. 
This loss of market share not only threatens the company’s competitive 
position but can also negatively affect its financial performance. Investors 
should be vigilant and responsive to these developments, as maintaining a 
proactive approach is crucial when monitoring the health and prospects of 
smaller companies with niche products in dynamic markets.
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 96 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PMSelling • 97
Financial Position Deteriorates
The financial health and stability of a company are crucial factors that 
underpin its long-term success. For small companies, in particular, main￾taining a strong financial position is of paramount importance due to their 
limited resources and leverage compared to more established, larger 
enterprises. Small growth companies often rely on growing cash flows to 
fuel their expansion and development. When their financial position dete￾riorates and they struggle to generate the expected cash flow, it can have 
significant implications for their future growth and operations.
In such situations, small companies may need to explore alternative 
sources of financing, which often means taking on more debt. This not 
only introduces additional financial risk but can also have a detrimental 
impact on existing shareholders. For investors in small growth companies, 
it is essential to closely monitor the financial stability and performance 
of these businesses, as financial deterioration can be a potent sell signal, 
indicating potential trouble ahead.
Critical Product Is Delayed
Small companies often have a more concentrated product portfolio, with 
their success heavily reliant on just a few critical offerings. When one 
of these critical products faces delays or garners negative press after its 
introduction, it can create significant challenges for the company. In such 
situations, it is essential for investors to assess the reasons for the delay 
and how it affects the company’s competitive position. If the analysis 
reveals that the delay or negative publicity is undermining the company’s 
prospects, it is a clear sell signal.
Furthermore, the introduction of a formidable competing product 
that has the potential to substantially impact the company’s market share 
and competitiveness is also a compelling reason to consider selling. Small 
companies may be more vulnerable to competition due to their limited 
resources and smaller market presence, making it crucial for investors 
to closely monitor their competitive landscape and be prepared to take 
action when a major competitive threat arises.
Litigation Poses a Significant Risk
Serious litigation can pose a substantial risk for any company, regardless 
of its size. When a small company becomes entangled in significant legal 
disputes, it not only drains financial resources but also diverts manage￾ment’s attention away from critical business operations. The potential 
NSM_CH05_3pp.indd 97 2/6/2024 6:38:44 PM98 • Navigating the Stock Market
for an adverse judgment in such litigation can be particularly devastating 
for smaller companies, as it can lead to severe financial losses and even 
threaten the company’s existence. For instance, the loss of a major patent 
lawsuit could prevent a small company from selling its flagship or only 
product, seriously impairing its ability to compete in the market.
As an investor, it is prudent to establish a rule to avoid companies 
that are exposed to litigation with the potential to severely impact their 
business operations or competitive position. Conduct thorough due dili￾gence and evaluate how ongoing or pending legal matters may affect the 
company’s financial health and future prospects. In cases where litigation 
risk is high and could lead to catastrophic consequences, selling the stock 
may be the most prudent course of action to protect your investment.
Company Starts Wasting Money
When a company’s management begins making decisions that appear irra￾tional and resources are being squandered on nonproductive assets and 
expenses, it is a clear warning sign that the company may be heading in 
the wrong direction. If these questionable actions appear to be part of a 
pattern rather than isolated incidents, it becomes imperative to seriously 
consider selling the stock. Management’s actions, such as pursuing ques￾tionable acquisitions, venturing into high-risk markets, awarding excep￾tionally high perks and compensations to corporate executives, and other 
nonstrategic financial moves, should be viewed as strong indicators that 
the company is making poor choices that could negatively affect its finan￾cial health and future performance.
As an investor, it is crucial to closely monitor the company’s financial 
decisions and evaluate whether these actions align with its long-term 
strategy and profitability goals. If management’s choices consistently 
appear detrimental to the company’s overall health and value, selling 
the stock may be a prudent move to protect your investment from 
potential harm.

FACTORS CAUSING STOCK PRICES TO RISE OR FALL
This section delves into the intricate dynamics that influence stock price 
movements, providing investors with insight into the myriad factors that 
shape the volatile ebb and flow of stock prices.
Key Performance Drivers
The primary performance drivers in the stock market are closely tied to 
the broader economic landscape. Corporate profits are a fundamental 
component, as they reflect a company’s ability to generate earnings for 
shareholders. When corporate profits are on the rise, it typically signals 
a healthy economic environment, and investors become more optimistic 
about the future, leading to stock market gains. Conversely, any factors 
that threaten corporate profitability, such as increased costs or decreased 
demand, can trigger market declines.
The overall state of the economy is another critical factor influencing 
stock market performance. A growing and stable economy tends to boost 
investor confidence and drive stock prices higher, as it implies increased 
consumer spending, business expansion, and job growth. Contrastingly, 
economic downturns or recessions can lead to investor caution and 
market declines. Additionally, inflation and interest rates play a signifi￾cant role in stock market movements. High inflation and rising interest 
rates can erode the purchasing power of both companies and consumers, 
impacting corporate profits and reducing investor enthusiasm, leading

to market declines. Conversely, low inflation and low-interest rates often 
create a favorable environment for stocks, as they encourage borrowing, 
spending, and investment. Therefore, investors closely monitor economic 
indicators, inflation data, and central bank policies to gauge their potential 
impact on the stock market.
Demand for Stock Increases
Stock prices go up when the forces of supply and demand create a favora￾ble environment for buyers. Investors, driven by various factors, contrib￾ute to fluctuations in stock prices. When demand for a stock increase, 
typically due to positive developments, investor sentiment, or strong per￾formance, its price rises. Conversely, when more investors want to sell 
a stock than buy it, the price tends to decline. This supply-and-demand 
dynamic is at the core of stock price movements.
Several key factors can drive an increase in demand for a stock. First 
and foremost, increased profitability or strong earnings performance 
often attracts investors. When a company reports robust earnings results 
or demonstrates a consistent track record of profitability, it creates 
a positive outlook, encouraging more buyers to enter the market and 
drive up the stock price. Additionally, expectations of future earnings 
growth can also spur demand, as investors anticipate higher profitability 
in the coming quarters or years. Moreover, a general positive trend in 
the broader stock market, reflected in indexes like the S&P 500 or Dow 
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), can contribute to increased demand for 
individual stocks, leading to higher prices as well. These factors collec￾tively influence investor behavior and contribute to the upward move￾ment of stock prices.
Key Factors That Attract Buyers
First and foremost, an actual increase in a company’s profitability, as 
reflected in its earnings, is a significant catalyst for driving demand and 
pushing the stock price higher. Strong earnings reports signal financial 
health and success, attracting both individual and institutional investors 
who seek to benefit from the company’s positive performance. Such earn￾ings growth indicates the company’s ability to generate profits, which 
often leads to higher valuations.
Anticipation of future earnings growth is another critical factor 
drawing buyers to a stock. When investors expect that a company will 
report higher earnings in the future, they are more inclined to purchase 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 100 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 101
its shares. These expectations can be based on various factors, including 
the company’s strategic initiatives, market opportunities, and economic 
trends. A company with a compelling growth story is likely to attract a 
strong investor interest, contributing to stock price appreciation. 
Additionally, a general upward trend in the stock market or a particu￾lar industry group can also boost demand for individual stocks. Investors 
often seek opportunities in sectors or industries that are performing well, 
leading to increased demand for stocks within those categories. A ris￾ing tide in the broader market or a specific industry often lifts individ￾ual stocks, resulting in price increases and attracting buyers who want to 
capitalize on the positive trend. These primary factors combine to create 
favorable conditions for stock price appreciation and act as strong mag￾nets for potential investors.
Additional Factors That Influence Stock Performance
External and internal factors play pivotal roles in shaping a company’s 
stock performance. External factors encompass environmental condi￾tions beyond the company’s immediate control, such as the broader 
economic landscape and prevailing interest rates. These external fac￾tors can significantly impact a company’s operations, business outlook, 
and profitability. Economic conditions, for instance, can influence con￾sumer spending, which, in turn, affects a company’s sales and revenue. 
Likewise, interest rates can influence a company’s borrowing costs and 
access to capital, which can directly affect its profitability. These exter￾nal factors serve as a backdrop against which a company’s performance 
is evaluated, and they can have far-reaching consequences for its stock 
performance.
Moreover, internal factors are directly related to the company’s 
core business operations. These factors have a more direct influence on 
a company’s performance, including its operations, business prospects, 
profitability, and even its long-term viability. Internal factors may include 
aspects like the company’s management team, product quality, opera￾tional efficiency, and its ability to innovate and adapt to changing market 
conditions. A well-managed company with a strong product or service 
offering, efficient operations, and a robust competitive strategy is more 
likely to thrive and experience positive stock performance. Internal fac￾tors, in this context, represent the aspects of the company over which it 
has a greater degree of control and responsibility. Successful management 
of both external and internal factors is essential for a company to achieve 
and sustain strong stock performance over time.

Why Stocks Are Volatile in the Short-Term
The short-term volatility of stocks can be traced back to a complex inter￾play of multiple factors. Economic and business conditions are often at 
the forefront of investors’ concerns, as they seek to gauge how these fac￾tors will impact a company’s performance. Economic indicators, such as 
gross domestic product (GDP) growth, employment figures, and inflation 
rates, can spark market reactions as they provide insights into the broader 
economic environment. Additionally, a company’s specific business con￾ditions, including its quarterly earnings reports and guidance, can trigger 
substantial short-term stock price swings.
Market behavior and internal momentum are also major contributors 
to stock volatility. Market trends, investor sentiment, and trading patterns 
play a role in shaping stock price movements. Market participants may react 
to trends like sector rotation, which involves shifting investments among dif￾ferent sectors based on market conditions and expectations. Furthermore, 
news items, whether directly related to a company or not, can trigger signif￾icant stock price fluctuations. Information, whether accurate or speculative, 
often drives market reactions as investors attempt to quickly digest and react 
to the latest developments. The dynamic nature of these factors, combined 
with the constant flow of information in today’s interconnected world, leads 
to the short-term volatility that characterizes stock markets.
What Moves Stock Prices in the Short-Term
In the short-term, stock prices are primarily influenced by investor expec￾tations and perceptions rather than just fundamental factors. These expec￾tations can be highly sensitive to various day-to-day factors, including 
news events, economic data, and market sentiment. Positive news, such as 
strong earnings reports or favorable economic indicators, can attract buy￾ers and drive stock prices higher as investors become optimistic about a 
company’s future profitability and growth prospects. Conversely, negative 
news or disappointing results can lead to selling pressure, causing stock 
prices to decline as investors react to the new information with caution or 
pessimism. As a result, stocks can exhibit significant volatility over short 
time frames, which can span from a few hours to several months.
Investor sentiment also plays a crucial role in determining short-term 
stock price movements. Sentiment is influenced by a variety of psycho￾logical and emotional factors, including fear, greed, and market psychol￾ogy. Traders and investors often respond to changes in sentiment, and 
their collective actions can lead to rapid price changes. Short-term mar￾ket participants, such as day traders and swing traders, frequently rely 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 102 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 103
on technical analysis and momentum indicators to capture profits in this 
environment. Overall, the short-term dynamics of stock prices are heavily 
influenced by the ever-changing expectations, perceptions, and emotions 
of market participants, making them susceptible to rapid fluctuations and 
market sentiment shifts.
What Moves Stock Prices in the Long Term
In the long term, stock prices are primarily driven by sound fundamental 
factors that reflect the underlying financial health and performance of a 
company. These fundamental factors serve as the foundation for valuing 
individual stocks and the broader market. Some of the key factors that 
determine the long-term price trajectory of a stock include its earnings 
and dividends growth, financial condition, competitive positioning within 
its industry, and returns compared to alternative investment options like 
bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs). The growth and consistency of a 
company’s earnings and dividends over time play a critical role in assess￾ing its intrinsic value and its attractiveness to long-term investors.
While stock prices can experience significant short-term volatility 
driven by factors such as investor sentiment, news events, and market psy￾chology, the influence of fundamental factors becomes more pronounced 
over longer time horizons. Investors often evaluate stocks based on their 
earnings potential, cash flow, balance sheet strength, and competitive 
advantages in the industry. These factors are more likely to exert their full 
impact on stock prices as investors take a longer-term perspective and con￾sider the company’s ability to generate sustainable profits and deliver value 
to shareholders over time. As a result, in the long term, stocks tend to be 
more influenced by their intrinsic worth and financial performance, making 
fundamental analysis a vital tool for assessing their investment potential.
Investor Perceptions Impact Stock Prices
Investor perceptions are highly dynamic and can have a substantial 
impact on stock prices, often leading to short-term fluctuations and even 
prolonged trends in either direction. These perceptions are influenced by 
a multitude of variables, from economic indicators and company news to 
market sentiment and global events. Because of the complexity and sheer 
number of factors involved, it can be challenging to maintain objectivity 
and systematically evaluate stocks. This complexity is compounded by the 
ever-changing values of these variables, making it inevitable that investor 
perceptions will shift in response to various developments, both compa￾ny-specific and market-wide.
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 103 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AM104 • Navigating the Stock Market
When investors’ views change, stock prices may respond accordingly, 
either increasing, decreasing, or staying steady. If you, as an investor, iden￾tify that the prevailing perceptions of a company are negative and unlikely 
to change in the foreseeable future, it is important to consider whether 
holding onto the stock is the best course of action. Making such an eval￾uation and being proactive about managing your portfolio in response to 
changing perceptions is crucial for investors looking to maximize their 
returns and minimize risks in the stock market.
ADDITIONAL FACTORS INFLUENCING 
STOCK PRICES
This section describes additional factors, which be significant in some cases, 
that impact the price performance of stocks, either positively or negatively.
Traders
The Internet has revolutionized the way information is disseminated and 
accessed, particularly in the world of stock trading. With news and data 
readily available at the click of a button, traders can react swiftly to any 
developments in the market or specific companies. When negative news 
is released or a stock’s price falls below key technical indicators like mov￾ing averages, it triggers a near instantaneous response from traders. The 
result is often a rapid influx of sell orders as numerous traders aim to 
offload their shares simultaneously. This surge in selling activity creates 
significant downward pressure on the stock’s price, contributing to sharp 
declines.
Conversely, positive news and developments can propel a stock 
higher, as traders react just as promptly to capitalize on the opportunities 
presented. When a favorable announcement is made, such as a strong 
earnings report or a major partnership agreement, it can trigger a flurry of 
buy orders, leading to a rapid increase in the stock’s price. These dynam￾ics highlight the significant role that traders play in shaping short-term 
stock price movements, where market sentiment can change rapidly in 
response to the latest news and data.
Analyst Recommendations
Analyst recommendations provide valuable insights into the perceived 
prospects of specific stocks. When analysts issue a “buy” recommendation, 
it signifies their belief that the stock has the potential for significant price 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 104 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 105
appreciation, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Conversely, 
a “sell” recommendation suggests that the stock is expected to underper￾form, and investors should consider divesting their holdings. The “hold” 
rating advises maintaining the current position, which implies that, while 
there may not be an urgent need to sell the stock, it may not present a 
compelling opportunity for additional buying.
Understanding these ratings is crucial for investors to make informed 
decisions. However, investors should not rely solely on these recommen￾dations and should conduct their own research to make well-informed 
investment choices. It is also important to consider the credibility and 
track record of the analysts and the underlying factors influencing their 
recommendations.
Impact of Analyst Recommendations
Analyst recommendations hold significant sway over investor sentiment 
and can have a substantial impact on stock prices. When an analyst 
upgrades a stock, it typically leads to increased buying activity as investors 
perceive the stock as having improved growth potential. This increased 
demand can drive the stock price higher. Conversely, a downgrade recom￾mendation can result in a sell-off as it signals that the company’s prospects 
may have deteriorated, prompting investors to reduce or divest their hold￾ings. The extent of this impact is influenced by various factors, including 
the nature of the recommendation change, the market’s prior expectations 
for the stock, and the element of surprise. A highly unexpected upgrade 
or downgrade may elicit a more pronounced market response.
Monitoring the accuracy of specific analysts in predicting a stock’s 
performance and earnings estimates is a valuable practice. If you find that 
a particular analyst consistently provides reliable insights, their recom￾mendations may carry more weight in your decision-making process. It is 
important to stay informed about the recommendations of these trusted 
analysts and consider their assessments in conjunction with your own 
research to make well-informed investment choices. This strategy can 
help you navigate the stock market with greater confidence and poten￾tially achieve more successful outcomes.
Share Buyback Announcements
Share buyback announcements by a company can have a significant pos￾itive impact on its stock price. When a company announces its intention 
to repurchase its own shares, it sends a strong signal to the market that it 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 105 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AM106 • Navigating the Stock Market
believes its stock is undervalued. This act of confidence often reassures 
investors and can lead to increased buying activity, causing the stock price 
to rise. The reduction in the total number of outstanding shares also effec￾tively increases EPS, since earnings are divided by a smaller share count. 
Higher EPS is typically well received by investors as it reflects improved 
profitability on a per-share basis and can further contribute to the stock’s 
upward momentum.
The effect of share buybacks is amplified by the fundamental prin￾ciple of supply and demand. With fewer shares available for trading, the 
supply of the stock is reduced, making it relatively scarcer. In response, 
investors may compete to acquire the remaining shares, driving up the 
stock price. Consequently, share buyback announcements are often seen 
as a positive corporate action that can enhance shareholder value and 
reinforce investor confidence in the company.
Manipulation and Hype
The stock market, despite being heavily regulated, can still be vulnera￾ble to manipulation and hype. Various tactics are employed to artificially 
inflate or deflate stock prices. For example, companies may issue mislead￾ing statements with the aim of temporarily boosting their stock prices. 
Additionally, short sellers may spread rumors to create negative senti￾ment and drive down stock prices, ultimately profiting from the decline. 
Unscrupulous analysts might release biased recommendations for personal 
gain, and false news releases can be distributed to mislead investors. While 
these manipulative practices can have short-term effects on stock prices, it 
is important to understand that, in the long run, a company’s profitability 
and fundamentals remain the most crucial factors for sustainable value.
As an investor, it is essential to remain vigilant and focus on the 
underlying fundamentals of a company. While market manipulation and 
hype can lead to temporary fluctuations, a company’s true value is deter￾mined by its financial health, earnings, and long-term growth prospects. 
By staying informed and discerning between genuine news and mislead￾ing information, you can make more informed investment decisions and 
avoid being swayed by short-term market dynamics.
Stock Splits
Stock splits are often misunderstood by some investors who believe that 
a stock split will lead to extraordinary profits. The misconception is that 
after a stock split, which essentially increases the number of shares while 
reducing the stock price per share, the stock will eventually rebound to 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 106 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 107
its previous price level, resulting in substantial gains. This belief leads to a 
spike in the stock price upon the announcement of a stock split. However, 
extensive research and studies have consistently shown that stock splits 
have no lasting impact on a stock’s long-term price performance. While 
short-term fluctuations may occur before and after a split, the ultimate 
destination for the stock price is determined by the company’s underly￾ing fundamentals. Investors should exercise caution when they observe 
a company engaging in excessive stock splits, as this can indicate overly 
optimistic sentiment and may not align with the company’s true value.
In reality, stock splits are essentially cosmetic changes that do not 
affect a company’s financial health, earnings, or intrinsic value. The num￾ber of shares an investor holds increases, but the overall ownership stake 
remains the same. It is the company’s fundamentals and performance in 
the market that should guide investment decisions rather than the occur￾rence of a stock split.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are often perceived as positive events 
in the stock market. When a company is acquired, its shares are typi￾cally withdrawn from the stock market, reducing the overall supply of that 
stock. If demand remains constant, the decrease in supply can lead to a 
positive impact. In many cases, the stock price of the acquired company 
rises, often receiving a premium over its trading price when the acquisi￾tion is announced. This increase in the stock price is seen as a benefit to 
the shareholders of the company being acquired.
Conversely, the stock price of the acquiring company may experience 
a drop upon the announcement of the acquisition. This drop is often asso￾ciated with concerns that the acquiring company may have overpaid for 
the acquisition, which can be viewed negatively by investors. The extent 
of the drop in the acquiring company’s stock price can vary depending on 
the specific terms of the deal and how well it is received by the market. 
It is important to note that M&A transactions are complex and involve 
many factors that can affect stock prices, making it essential for inves￾tors to carefully evaluate the potential impact on both the acquiring and 
acquired companies.
EXTERNAL FACTORS INFLUENCING STOCK PRICES
There are many external factors that can impact the business as well as the 
stock price of a company, which are described in this section.
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 107 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AM108 • Navigating the Stock Market
Inflation
Inflation has a significant impact on the stock market. Investors often 
choose between various investment options, such as stocks, bonds, and 
money market funds. When inflation remains low, stocks are generally 
favored because they have the potential to offer higher returns compared 
to other assets. However, when inflation starts to rise and the Federal 
Reserve (aka “The Fed”) responds by raising interest rates to combat 
inflation, it can negatively affect stocks. The reasoning behind this is that 
rising inflation reduces the real value of future earnings for companies, 
making it more challenging for stocks to provide adequate returns when 
adjusted for inflation. In essence, inflation dilutes the value of future 
earnings, which leads to a decrease in stock prices and causes concern 
among investors and financial markets.
As a result, Wall Street views inflation as a potential threat, since it can 
erode the purchasing power of earnings and create uncertainty in the stock 
market. When inflation is on the rise, investors may shift their preferences 
toward assets that provide better protection against inflation, such as Treasury 
Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or commodities. Understanding the 
dynamics of inflation and its effects on stock prices is crucial for investors to 
make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy and its associated conditions play a pivotal role in influ￾encing the overall trend of the stock market. Key factors, such as the pre￾vailing interest rate trends, the state of inflation or deflation, and decisions 
made by the Federal Reserve, are central drivers that define the domi￾nant direction of the stock market. Once an upward or downward trend 
has been established, it often persists for an extended period, typically 
ranging from one to three years. For investors, it is essential to closely 
monitor changes in monetary policy and attempt to identify any shifts 
in these trends. If such changes suggest a bullish or bearish pattern for 
the market, investors should reassess their investment strategies to ensure 
they are aligned with the anticipated market conditions.
The Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, wields 
significant influence over the economy and financial markets through 
its monetary policy decisions. The Fed can impact the stock market by 
adjusting interest rates, conducting open market operations, and signal￾ing its stance on economic conditions and inflation. Investors, therefore, 
need to be vigilant in following the Federal Reserve’s actions and state￾ments, as they can provide crucial insights into the future trajectory of 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 108 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 109
the stock market and help them make informed decisions regarding their 
portfolios.
Factors Causing Interest Rates to Rise and Fall
Interest rates, which are crucial determinants of economic and financial 
market conditions, can be classified into two primary categories: short￾term and long-term rates. Typically, stronger economic growth exerts 
upward pressure on short-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board 
has a significant role in regulating short-term interest rates, often using 
monetary policy tools to manage economic conditions and control these 
rates. Long-term interest rates, however, are influenced by various fac￾tors, including the outlook for inflation and the interest rate differentials 
between the United States and other foreign countries. Over the long 
term, the levels of government spending and deficit financing, in addition 
to fluctuations in the inflation rate, serve as key determinants of the extent 
to which long-term interest rates either rise or fall.
Understanding the dynamics of interest rates, both short-term and 
long-term, is vital for investors and market participants. These rates have a 
profound impact on a wide range of financial instruments, including bonds, 
mortgages, and lending practices, which in turn can influence invest￾ment strategies and portfolio management decisions. Therefore, staying 
informed about the factors that drive interest rate movements is essential 
for making sound investment choices in various economic environments.
Relationship Between the Stock and Bond Markets
The relationship between the stock and bond markets is a complex and 
interdependent one. Bonds are essentially long-term, fixed-interest secu￾rities that, like stocks, can experience price fluctuations. In general, when 
inflation and interest rates rise, bonds tend to be negatively affected as 
they erode the effective yield of fixed-rate bonds. As a result, factors that 
contribute to higher interest rates and inflation are typically detrimental 
to bonds. Therefore, if bond prices rise, leading to a lower yield (since 
bond prices and yields move inversely), it is often interpreted as an indi￾cation that the economy may be heading for a period of weakness, which 
could result in lower interest rates.
This relationship has implications for both stock and bond investors. 
When bonds become less attractive due to lower yields, some investors 
may shift their focus toward stocks, expecting better returns. Conversely, 
when bonds are considered more appealing due to higher yields, investors 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 109 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AM110 • Navigating the Stock Market
may be more inclined to allocate their funds to bonds, potentially diverting 
funds away from the stock market. This dynamic interaction between the 
stock and bond markets highlights the importance of monitoring inter￾est rates, inflation, and economic conditions when making investment 
decisions involving these two asset classes.
METHODS FOR VALUING STOCKS
Buying an overvalued stock will reduce the ultimate profitability of an 
investment. Therefore, investors must understand the methods used to 
value stocks, which are described in this section.
How Stock Prices Are Determined
The determination of stock prices is a fundamental process in the stock 
market, and it involves the interaction of various factors and market par￾ticipants. A stock represents a trading commodity, and the price is ulti￾mately determined through the continuous matching of willing buyers 
and sellers. Both buyers and sellers aim to determine a price that they 
find favorable for their respective transactions, and the market facilitates 
this process.
Valuing stocks is a complex endeavor, as it requires investors to assess 
the relationship between price and intrinsic value. The challenge stems 
from the fact that the actual intrinsic value of a stock is difficult to quan￾tify accurately. Furthermore, investors must consider the various invest￾ment options available to them, making the valuation process even more 
intricate. Ultimately, the stock market’s dynamic nature results from the 
ongoing evaluation of stocks by market participants who collectively set 
the prices based on their perceptions and expectations, as well as external 
influences like economic conditions, corporate performance, and market 
sentiment.
Commonly Used Valuation Methods
The most commonly used valuation methods in stock analysis offer inves￾tors a range of techniques to assess a stock’s worth. Among these meth￾ods, four stand out as frequently employed by investors to evaluate stocks. 
These techniques primarily focus on comparing the stock’s value to the 
broader investment landscape, assessing its relative value compared to 
other investments, projecting its expected performance, and calculat￾ing its intrinsic value. The selection of a specific valuation method often 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 110 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 111
depends on the investor’s approach and preferences. For instance, value 
investors tend to favor the intrinsic value approach as a central compo￾nent of their investment strategy, while other investors may prioritize dif￾ferent methods based on their investment objectives and risk tolerance.
By comparing these various methods, investors can develop a com￾prehensive view of a stock’s potential and risks. These valuation techniques 
provide investors with tools to make informed decisions and effectively 
navigate the dynamic and complex world of the stock market.
Valuing Through Comparison With Investment Alternatives
Valuing stocks by comparing them to other investment alternatives involves 
a critical assessment of the stock’s potential in relation to various invest￾ment options. This method aims to determine the most attractive vehicle 
for deploying funds. Investors consider both nonstock investments, such 
as bonds and CDs, as well as different sectors or industry groups within 
the stock market. This holistic analysis incorporates two key factors that 
significantly influence the valuation process: interest rates and inflation. 
These elements play a pivotal role in shaping the relative appeal of stocks 
compared to other financial instruments, such as bonds. For instance, 
when interest rates increase, investors tend to favor bonds over stocks due 
to the more predictable and secure nature of fixed-income securities.
By weighing these factors, investors can make informed decisions 
regarding their capital allocation and select investments that best align 
with their risk tolerance and financial goals. The comparative approach 
helps investors assess the relative merits of various investment options 
and adapt their strategies in response to changing market conditions.
Valuing By Comparing Relative Value
Valuing stocks by comparing their relative value involves assessing a stock’s 
worth in relation to its competitors, which are vying for the same pool of 
investment capital. This method employs various criteria for comparison, 
such as earnings, dividends, growth rates, or other relevant investment 
parameters chosen by the investor. Additionally, stocks are compared to 
widely recognized stock market benchmarks, such as market indexes or 
averages, including the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Investors can also gauge 
a stock’s relative value by comparing it to specific industry groups or sec￾tors within the broader market.
This method allows investors to evaluate a stock’s performance 
and prospects within the context of its industry and the overall stock 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 111 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AM112 • Navigating the Stock Market
market. By comparing a stock’s metrics to those of its peers and bench￾mark indexes, investors can gain valuable insights into whether the stock 
appears overvalued or undervalued. This comparative analysis assists 
investors in making well-informed investment decisions that consider the 
competitive landscape and the potential for outperformance relative to 
other investment options.
Valuing By Comparing Performance Expectation
Valuing stocks by comparing their performance expectations involves 
evaluating a stock’s anticipated performance over the next six to twelve 
months in relation to the expected performance of other stock alternatives 
and the broader stock market. The primary goal is to pinpoint the stock 
that is poised to deliver the most favorable performance during the des￾ignated investment horizon, surpassing selected stock market indexes and 
averages, as well as competing stock alternatives. This method is rooted in 
the investor’s unique investment expectations and risk tolerance, allowing 
for a tailored assessment of stocks in terms of their growth potential.
Investors using this method focus on the near-to-intermediate term, 
making it suitable for those looking for relatively short investment hori￾zons. By comparing a stock’s projected performance against that of alter￾native investments and the market as a whole, investors aim to select 
stocks with the best growth prospects, as they anticipate these stocks will 
outperform their peers and deliver superior returns over the specified 
time frame. It allows investors to strategically position their investments 
based on their short- to medium-term goals and market outlook.
Valuing By Intrinsic Value Determination
Valuing stocks through intrinsic value determination involves establishing 
a stock’s true worth in isolation, without regard for how other stocks are 
valued in the market. The primary objective is to ascertain the market 
value of the company, which represents the value that shareholders would 
receive if the company were to be liquidated. In this approach, the focus 
is entirely on analyzing the company’s financial health, examining factors 
such as its assets, liabilities, book value, earnings, dividends, and other 
fundamental indicators to determine its fair market value.
Investors employing this method seek to identify stocks that are trad￾ing at a substantial discount to their intrinsic or real value. By conducting 
a thorough analysis of the company’s financials and underlying funda￾mentals, they aim to pinpoint stocks that are potentially undervalued, 
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 112 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMStock Prices and Valuation • 113
presenting opportunities for capital appreciation over the long term. This 
method is particularly favored by value investors who believe that markets 
can misprice stocks, and by identifying such discrepancies, investors can 
capitalize on the potential for future price corrections. It provides a more 
intrinsic and fundamental approach to stock valuation, often focusing on 
the balance between risk and reward in a more long-term investment 
horizon.
NSM_CH06_2pp.indd 113 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMNSM_CH06_2pp.indd 114 1/25/2024 10:55:07 AMCHAPTER
GENERAL
This section discusses profitability and price performance, both of which 
are important for investors, who need to understand their various aspects 
to ensure that their investments provide acceptable returns.
Importance of Earnings
Earnings play a pivotal role in determining the attractiveness of a stock 
as an investment. The consistency and growth of a company’s earnings 
are crucial factors that directly influence its stock price. For investors, 
the ability of a company to generate profits is a fundamental indicator 
of its financial health and strength. Companies with a track record of 
increasing profits are often seen as more desirable investments because 
they demonstrate their ability to adapt and thrive in a competitive market 
environment.
Historically, stocks that have experienced robust and consistent 
earnings growth have been associated with better investment outcomes. 
Whether its established industry leaders or emerging growth companies, 
a pattern of increasing earnings is typically viewed positively by investors. 
Such companies are seen as having the potential to provide better returns 
and capital appreciation, which often attracts investors seeking value and 
growth. On the contrary, companies that consistently fail to deliver profits 
are usually met with skepticism and can face reduced investor interest and 
declining stock prices. It is essential for investors to favor companies with 
a strong earnings track record and, ideally, focus on those achieving annual

earnings growth rates of 20% or more, as this typically indicates robust 
financial performance and the potential for future stock price appreciation.
How Earnings Are Reported
Quarterly earnings reports are a key event in the world of stock invest￾ing. Companies are required to report their earnings, along with financial 
highlights, every three months. These reports provide a comprehensive 
overview of a company’s financial performance during the specified quar￾ter and are eagerly awaited by investors. The timing of these reports can 
vary from one company to another, but many follow a calendar-based 
schedule. Typically, companies report their quarterly earnings in April 
(for the first quarter), July (for the second quarter), October (for the third 
quarter), and January (for the fourth quarter and full year). Investors 
closely monitor these quarterly earnings announcements because they 
have the potential to significantly impact a company’s stock price.
Earnings reports are typically released through various channels, 
including the company’s official website, official press releases, financial 
news websites, and major newspapers. These reports contain vital informa￾tion, such as revenue, earnings per share, net income, and other financial 
metrics that investors and analysts use to evaluate the financial health and 
performance of a company. The contents of these reports, along with man￾agement’s commentary and guidance for the future, can have a profound 
effect on investor sentiment and influence trading decisions. Consequently, 
investors often pay close attention to these reports as they seek to make 
informed investment choices and respond to market opportunities.
Learn How to Interpret Earnings
To make informed investment decisions, it is crucial to learn how to inter￾pret reported earnings since they are a primary driver of stock prices. 
Start by analyzing both quarterly and annual earnings reports. Pay atten￾tion to the percentage increase in earnings year over year, which provides 
insights into a company’s growth trajectory. When examining a specific 
quarter, compare it to the same quarter from the previous year to identify 
seasonality or any significant changes in performance. For instance, com￾pare the third quarter of 2023 with the third quarter of 2022, as this allows 
for a more relevant year-over-year comparison.
It is also essential to evaluate the current quarterly earnings increase, 
expressed as a percentage, compared to the same quarter a year ago. 
Look for a consistent, upward trend in earnings per share over at least 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 116 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 117
two to three quarters. Analyzing the quarterly trend is important, as it can 
reveal changes and potential issues that might be masked when looking at 
consolidated yearly figures. Additionally, consider comparing the compa￾ny’s earnings to those of other stocks within the same industry and group 
to assess its relative performance and position in the market. Favoring 
companies with the highest percentage increase in EPS can be a valua￾ble strategy when selecting stocks. By following these practices, you can 
gain a deeper understanding of how a company’s earnings performance 
impacts its stock price and make more informed investment decisions.
Analyze Earnings In-Depth
Earnings announcements should not be taken at face value; a thorough 
and critical analysis is essential to understand the true financial health of a 
company. It is important to look beyond the surface-level figures reported 
by company officials. For instance, even if the reported earnings are labe￾led as “record earnings,” they may not present a positive picture when 
compared to the previous year in percentage terms. It is crucial to exam￾ine whether the company’s earnings growth is genuinely increasing or if it 
is actually on the decline despite higher revenues.
Pay close attention to financial anomalies such as “write-offs” and 
restructuring charges, as they can distort the earnings figure and misrep￾resent the true profitability of the company. Additionally, track the com￾pany’s earnings trajectory over time to identify any signs of acceleration or 
deceleration. A strong trend of earnings acceleration is often a good indi￾cator of potential gains, while deceleration can signal potential losses. By 
scrutinizing earnings reports and digging deeper into the financial data, 
you can gain a more accurate understanding of a company’s performance 
and make more informed investment decisions.
Earnings Can Be Related to the Economic Cycle
Earnings and the economic cycle are intimately connected, significantly 
impacting the performance of the stock market. The overall strength and 
trajectory of the economy play a pivotal role in shaping the level of prof￾its that companies can expect to generate. In times of robust economic 
growth, corporate profits tend to surge, leading to higher stock prices. 
Conversely, during periods of recession, profits may plummet or result in 
losses, triggering declines in stock prices. This interplay between earnings 
and the economic cycle provides investors with a useful tool for forecasting 
earnings trends. Historically, the stock market has demonstrated an ability 
to serve as a leading indicator of the state of the economy, often predicting 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 117 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM118 • Navigating the Stock Market
economic shifts six to twelve months in advance. By monitoring stock mar￾ket performance, investors can gain valuable insights into the potential 
direction of corporate earnings and the broader economic landscape.
Understanding the relationship between earnings and the economic 
cycle is crucial for informed investment decisions. Investors who grasp 
the correlation between these factors can more effectively navigate the 
stock market’s ebbs and flows, strategically positioning their portfolios 
based on the current economic environment. Whether it’s recognizing 
opportunities during economic upswings or adopting defensive strategies 
in anticipation of a downturn, a deep understanding of earnings and the 
economic cycle empowers investors to make more informed choices in an 
ever-changing market.
Why Dividends Have Lost Their Importance
In recent years, the significance of dividends has diminished compared to 
the past. Several factors contribute to this shift in emphasis. Many compa￾nies have opted to redirect the funds traditionally allocated for dividends 
toward alternative strategies aimed at increasing earnings. This includes 
initiatives such as reinvesting in the business, funding R&D, expanding 
operations, or pursuing mergers and acquisitions. These measures are 
designed to enhance the company’s growth prospects and, subsequently, 
its earnings per share. In addition to corporate preferences, investors 
have also altered their investment priorities, increasingly favoring com￾panies that offer the potential for capital appreciation over those provid￾ing substantial dividend payouts. As a result, many investors have shifted 
their focus away from dividends and toward stocks with strong growth 
potential.
This change in perspective underscores the evolving investment land￾scape, where the value of a stock is increasingly associated with its growth 
prospects and earnings performance rather than just its dividend yield. 
Companies and investors alike have adapted to these shifting dynamics, 
emphasizing strategies and stocks that align with these evolving prefer￾ences. Consequently, dividends, while still important, have lost some of 
their historical significance in comparison to other factors that drive stock 
market performance.
What Return on Equity Indicates
Return on equity (ROE) is a fundamental financial metric that measures 
the profitability and efficiency of a company in generating returns for its 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 118 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 119
shareholders. ROE is calculated by taking the company’s net income and 
dividing it by the shareholders’ equity and is typically represented as a 
percentage. It provides insight into how effectively a company utilizes its 
shareholders’ investments to generate profits. The higher the ROE, the 
more efficient the company is in generating returns on the equity invest￾ment of its shareholders.
A high ROE is often indicative of a company’s ability to grow its share￾holders’ wealth at an accelerated rate, as it signifies that the company can 
generate substantial profits relative to its equity base. Generally, an ROE 
of 15% or higher is considered desirable as it indicates that the company is 
efficiently using its equity to generate substantial returns. Conversely, an 
ROE below 10% may be viewed as inadequate, suggesting that the com￾pany is not effectively utilizing its shareholders’ capital to generate profits. 
In summary, ROE is a crucial metric for assessing a company’s financial 
performance and its ability to provide a solid return on the investments 
made by its shareholders.
ROE Can Be Related to a Stock’s Price Performance
Return on equity is closely related to a stock’s price performance as it 
reflects a company’s ability to generate profits and increase its retained 
earnings, which, in turn, impacts the stock’s valuation and price. A higher 
ROE is often associated with a more significant increase in a company’s 
book value, which can drive stock prices higher. Companies that consist￾ently maintain high ROE levels tend to experience substantial stock price 
appreciation over time.
For instance, numerous companies recognized for their impressive 
ROE figures have witnessed significant stock price growth. In the case 
of some, with ROE levels as high as 30%–40%, these companies have 
seen their stock prices appreciate multiple times over the years. Investors 
often favor stocks of companies with strong ROE, as it indicates efficient 
utilization of shareholder equity and the potential for robust financial per￾formance, which, in turn, can lead to substantial price appreciation in the 
stock market.
HOW TO ANALYZE EARNINGS
This section discusses various aspects of a company’s earnings, which 
are the fundamental bedrock upon which stocks depend for their price 
appreciation.
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 119 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM120 • Navigating the Stock Market
What the Quarterly EPS Indicates
The quarterly EPS is a crucial indicator of a company’s current profitability, 
reflecting recent earnings’ magnitude and trend, forming the foundation for 
stock valuation. When analyzing it, investors should focus on earnings con￾sistency and growth, ideally exhibiting a steady upward trend. A substantial 
percentage increase in the current quarterly EPS compared to the previous 
year’s comparable quarter, typically approximately 20%–30% or more, is 
favorable. More powerful is an acceleration in earnings growth, where a 
company’s earnings show an increasing rate, for example, from 15% to 20% 
and further to 30%, signifying robust growth potential for the stock price.
Consistently increasing and accelerating earnings growth makes com￾panies more attractive to investors. Higher growth rates indicate a company’s 
ability to generate more profits, leading to stronger stock price appreciation. 
These trends are closely associated with a stock’s potential for significant 
price gains, a key focus for investors when evaluating performance.
Analyzing Quarterly EPS
When analyzing quarterly EPS, it is crucial to dig deeper and scrutinize 
the reported figures carefully to ensure they are not distorted for any rea￾son. A significant aspect to consider is the context in which these earnings 
are reported. For instance, if a company had a loss in the previous year or 
reported very low earnings, the current year’s earnings may appear signif￾icantly better, potentially misleading investors. It is essential to compare 
the earnings to historical data and industry benchmarks to gain a more 
accurate understanding of a company’s performance.
Another factor that can distort earnings is the presence of extraordinary 
charges or unusual events, such as write-offs or one-time gains. These irreg￾ularities can have a substantial impact on the quarterly EPS, and investors 
need to assess whether these events are likely to recur or are exceptional 
circumstances. Additionally, changes in the number of outstanding shares, 
whether due to stock buybacks or dilution from employee stock options, can 
also affect EPS figures. Therefore, investors should delve into the financial 
statements and disclosures to uncover the underlying factors affecting the 
reported earnings and make more informed investment decisions.
Use Annual EPS to Determine Profitability Consistency
Analyzing a company’s annual EPS over a five-year period is a valuable 
strategy to evaluate its consistency and sustainability in delivering healthy 
earnings. A general guideline is to look for an increasing trend in annual 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 120 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 121
EPS over this time frame. This consistency demonstrates that the com￾pany has been able to grow its earnings steadily, which is a positive sign 
for investors. However, it is important to be flexible in your assessment 
and allow for occasional fluctuations in earnings. If there was a decline in 
earnings in one year but the company quickly rebounded and resumed an 
upward earnings trajectory in the subsequent year, it may not necessarily 
be a cause for concern. The key is to focus on the overall trend and ensure 
that the company’s long-term earnings performance remains strong.
By analyzing annual EPS, investors can gain insights into a company’s 
financial health and performance over an extended period. A consistently ris￾ing EPS indicates that the company has the potential for long-term growth 
and may be a sound investment. However, it is essential to combine this anal￾ysis with other factors, such as the industry’s economic conditions and the 
company’s competitive position, to make a well-rounded investment decision.
Current Quarterly EPS Growth Rate Should Be Rising
When analyzing a company’s earnings, it is essential to examine both the 
quarterly and annual EPS figures. While the raw EPS numbers per share 
provide valuable information, it’s often more meaningful to focus on the 
percentage change in the quarterly EPS compared to the previous year’s 
corresponding quarter. The growth rate in the current quarterly EPS 
should be noticeably higher, by a substantial percentage, than the same 
quarter in the previous year. This increase indicates accelerating earnings 
growth, which is a strong positive signal for investors. A company that 
exhibits a consistent pattern of rising growth rates, such as progressing 
from 20% to 25% to 30%, should be particularly favored, as it suggests 
strong and sustained performance.
In addition to the quarterly EPS growth, investors should also con￾sider the company’s annual EPS performance. A history of increasing 
annual EPS over several years is a vital indicator of a company’s ability 
to deliver consistent and healthy earnings growth. This upward trajectory 
not only demonstrates the company’s financial stability but also instills 
confidence in its capacity to adapt to changing market conditions and gen￾erate sustained profits. By analyzing both the quarterly and annual EPS 
figures, investors can gain a comprehensive view of a company’s earnings 
performance and make more informed investment decisions.
Projected EPS Should Be in an Uptrend
When evaluating a company’s earnings, it is crucial to not only focus 
on the historical figures but also consider the future outlook. Projected 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 121 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM122 • Navigating the Stock Market
quarterly and annual EPS should display a clear upward trend, indicating 
that the company is expected to maintain or enhance its profitability in 
the coming periods. To assess this, investors should pay attention to the 
consensus annual earnings estimate provided by analysts, which forecasts 
the company’s earnings for the following fiscal year. An increasing trend 
in these earnings estimates is a positive sign, as it reflects growing confi￾dence in the company’s financial performance. Additionally, examining 
quarterly earnings estimates is equally important, as they should also be 
on an upward trajectory. Companies with such positive earnings expecta￾tions, consistently rising and accelerating, are typically more attractive to 
investors as they demonstrate a strong outlook for profitability.
Earnings are a fundamental factor that directly influences a company’s 
stock price, and their consistent growth is a clear indicator of a company’s 
financial health. Consequently, favoring companies with a history of rising 
earnings and optimistic future earnings estimates can be a valuable strategy 
for investors seeking profitable and rewarding investment opportunities.
Use Projected Annual Earnings to Estimate Future Price 
Performance
The P/E ratio is a widely utilized valuation metric to assess whether a stock 
is overvalued or undervalued. Typically, a high P/E ratio indicates that a 
company is overvalued, while a low P/E ratio suggests that a stock is under￾valued. In P/E ratio calculations, E represents earnings, and two types of 
earnings numbers can be employed: trailing earnings and projected earn￾ings. Usually, P/E ratios available to investors are based on trailing earn￾ings, reflecting past performance. However, for a more forward-looking 
approach, it is advisable to use projected earnings, as this number carries 
greater relevance when estimating a stock’s future price performance.
Projecting earnings provides investors with a clearer insight into the 
potential future valuation of a stock. By considering projected earnings in 
P/E calculations, investors can better anticipate how a company’s earn￾ings are expected to evolve in the coming periods, enabling them to make 
more informed investment decisions. This approach aligns more closely 
with assessing a stock’s future potential, as opposed to relying solely on 
historical data provided by trailing earnings.
Projected Long-Term Earnings Growth Rate Must Be High
The projected long-term earnings growth rate is a vital indicator used 
to assess the expected earnings growth a company will achieve over the 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 122 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 123
next five years. This metric plays a crucial role in separating companies 
with sustained, robust growth potential from those with slow growth or 
transient success. A high long-term earnings growth rate is indicative of a 
company’s ability to maintain a strong growth trajectory over an extended 
period, making it an attractive prospect for investors. This metric can also 
help filter out companies with hyperbolic growth rates that are unsustain￾able in the long term, as their growth may fizzle out after a year or two.
When considering investments, it is advisable to favor growth stocks 
with a historical earnings growth rate exceeding 20% and a forecasted 
3–5 year growth rate of 20 to 30%. These stocks typically have a solid track 
record of consistent and robust earnings expansion, making them poten￾tially lucrative opportunities. Conversely, it is prudent to be cautious of 
companies with historical annual earnings growth rates below 15%, unless 
there are specific, exceptional circumstances that warrant a closer look. 
Such companies may not offer the same level of growth potential as those 
with more impressive historical and projected growth rates.
Obtain Projected Earnings Growth Rates From Reliable Sources
Obtaining accurate and reliable projected earnings growth rates is crucial 
for making informed investment decisions. These growth rates are a key 
determinant of a company’s future performance, and professional inves￾tors, with a long-term perspective, place significant importance on the 
company’s projected 3–5 year growth rate when assessing its potential. 
Therefore, it is paramount to ensure that the data you use for your invest￾ment analysis is as accurate as possible.
Selecting a reputable and trustworthy source for earnings forecasts is 
of utmost importance. The reliability of the data can significantly impact 
the quality of your investment decisions. Relying on inaccurate forecasts 
can lead to misguided judgments when evaluating a company for poten￾tial acquisition or sale. Thoroughly vet your data sources and consider 
using a combination of reputable financial analysts’ estimates and con￾sensus forecasts to obtain a comprehensive view of a company’s expected 
growth rate. By drawing on trusted sources, you can better position your￾self to make well-informed investment choices based on accurate growth 
rate projections.
Favor Companies With Consistent Earnings Growth
Favoring companies with a history of consistent earnings growth is a 
prudent strategy for investors seeking long-term opportunities. When a 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 123 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM124 • Navigating the Stock Market
company consistently exhibits strong earnings growth over several years, it 
demonstrates its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and gener￾ate sustained profits. This consistency instills confidence in investors that 
the company can continue to perform well in the future. A compounded 
annual earnings growth rate of 20% or higher over a 3- to 5-year period 
is indicative of a company’s ability to maintain a high-growth trajectory, 
making it an attractive prospect for investors.
However, it is essential to remain vigilant, even with companies that 
have shown consistent growth. If a company’s earnings growth rate begins 
to decelerate significantly, such as dropping from 30% to 20%, it may be a 
signal to reevaluate the investment. Slower earnings growth can indicate 
that the company is facing challenges or that its competitive advantage is 
eroding, which could affect its stock price. As an investor, staying attuned 
to these changes and adjusting your investment decisions accordingly is 
crucial to making informed choices in the stock market.
EARNINGS ESTIMATES AND REVISIONS
This section delves into various aspects of earnings estimates, which are 
available to investors from various sources and, periodically, revised as the 
investing environment changes.
Why Earnings Estimates Are Revised 
The revision of earnings estimates is a common and essential practice in 
the dynamic world of stock market analysis. Investors and analysts con￾tinuously assess a company’s future earnings expectations because these 
forecasts are deeply ingrained in the pricing of the company’s stock by 
Wall Street. These expectations are based on the most recent information 
available about the company and its surrounding environment. However, 
this environment is highly susceptible to change, and these changes 
can be either favorable or detrimental to the company’s profitability. 
Consequently, when any event unfolds that has the potential to impact a 
company’s earnings, investors and analysts swiftly adapt by revising their 
earnings forecasts for that particular company.
When analysts revise their earnings forecasts, these updated expecta￾tions are quickly reflected in the stock’s price. If the revision is an upward 
adjustment, indicating improved earnings prospects, the stock price typi￾cally experiences an increase. Conversely, if the revision is downward, sig￾naling deteriorating earnings expectations, the stock price often declines. 
In essence, these revisions serve as valuable signals to investors about the 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 124 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 125
expected performance of a company, influencing their buying and selling 
decisions and contributing to the stock’s price movement.
Drill Down and Check Range of Earnings Estimates
When assessing earnings estimates, it is crucial to go beyond the con￾sensus earnings estimate, which represents the average of the estimates 
provided by all reporting analysts, and delve deeper into the range of esti￾mates. The consensus estimate offers a general overview, but it is essential 
to understand the degree of dispersion among the estimates. For instance, 
while the consensus may be $1 per share, individual estimates could vary, 
ranging from $0.90 per share to $1.05 per share. This dispersion reflects 
the diversity of opinions among analysts regarding the company’s earnings 
potential.
After the company reports its actual earnings, it is beneficial to ascer￾tain which analyst’s estimate proved to be the most accurate. This infor￾mation can guide your future evaluation of analysts’ estimates, as the 
analyst with the closest forecast to the actual results may provide more 
reliable insights for your investment decisions. By considering the full 
range of estimates and pinpointing analysts with a track record of accurate 
forecasting, you can enhance the precision of your investment strategy 
and make more informed decisions.
Earnings Estimates Should Be Based on at Least Four Estimates
It is essential to ensure that earnings estimates are based on a substantial 
number of reporting analysts to minimize the risk of distortion in the con￾sensus estimate. Typically, earnings estimates reported by sources (like 
Reuters, Bloomberg, MarketWatch, FactSet, and Zacks) rely on data pro￾vided by numerous analysts. To enhance the reliability of these estimates, 
it is advisable to look for consensus estimates derived from a minimum of 
four reporting analysts. This threshold provides a more robust consensus 
figure and reduces the vulnerability to significant distortions caused by a 
single outlier or erroneous estimate.
The level of confidence in earnings forecasts generally increases with 
a higher number of analysts covering a company. This is because a larger 
analyst pool can withstand the impact of an individual analyst’s inaccu￾rate estimate more effectively. Consequently, having a larger sample size 
of estimates contributes to a more accurate and dependable consensus 
estimate, making it a valuable resource for investors seeking to make well￾informed decisions based on earnings projections.
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 125 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM126 • Navigating the Stock Market
Earnings Estimate Revisions Should Be Positive
Earnings estimate revisions play a pivotal role in the analysis of stock 
performance. These revisions are reflective of the dynamic nature of a 
company’s business environment. Typically, earnings estimates are revised 
by analysts in response to various factors, including the actual earnings 
reports, changes in company guidance, shifts in competitive landscapes, 
or other significant developments. An essential aspect to consider is that 
upward revisions in earnings estimates are generally perceived as posi￾tive signals for a stock. Such positive revisions often drive the stock price 
higher, reflecting the analysts’ growing optimism about the company’s 
future earnings potential.
Conversely, when earnings estimates are revised downward, it can 
have a dampening effect on the stock price. Investors often respond neg￾atively to such revisions, as they indicate potentially weaker performance 
expectations for the company. Therefore, it is prudent for investors to 
favor stocks whose earnings estimates are experiencing upward revisions, 
as this suggests a more optimistic outlook and better growth prospects 
for the company. Additionally, understanding the historical tendencies of 
analysts to underestimate earnings during rising trends and overestimate 
them during falling trends can provide valuable insights into stock perfor￾mance and assist investors in making informed decisions.
EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) RANK
This section discusses various aspects of the earnings per share rank which 
many investors, especially momentum investors, analyze when evaluating 
a stock.
What EPS Rank Indicates
The EPS rank indicator serves as a valuable tool for investors seeking to 
assess a company’s profitability and its relative position within the broader 
stock market landscape. It essentially quantifies how a company’s profit 
growth compares to all other companies traded in the stock market. It 
specifically focuses on the company’s earnings growth over the past five 
years, with particular emphasis on the last two quarters. This measure 
employs a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 99, where a higher rank indi￾cates superior profit growth in relation to other companies.
A high EPS rank, typically closer to 99, signifies that the company 
has demonstrated robust and consistent earnings growth over time, with 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 126 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 127
a strong recent performance. Investors may view this as a positive signal, 
indicating that the company’s financial health and profitability are on an 
upward trajectory. Conversely, a lower EPS rank, nearing the 1 end of 
the scale, may indicate that the company’s earnings growth has been less 
impressive compared to its peers. Investors may interpret this as a sign 
that the company is facing challenges or experiencing a decline in prof￾itability, potentially warranting a cautious approach to investing in such 
a stock.
EPS Rank Is Related to a Stock’s Performance
Selecting stocks with high EPS rank is a prudent strategy for investors 
looking to capitalize on profitable companies. High EPS rank stocks are 
often associated with strong earnings growth and a consistent track record 
of financial success. Consequently, these stocks are more likely to exhibit 
favorable price performance, which tends to attract positive attention 
from Wall Street. Investors are generally drawn to companies that can 
demonstrate superior earnings, and as a result, high EPS rank stocks are 
often seen as leaders and winners in the market. This is because they have 
both earnings and price momentum working in their favor, making them 
attractive investments.
The performance of stocks with high EPS rank is also influenced 
by broader market trends. In an upward-trending market, these stocks 
tend to shine, outperforming their counterparts with lower EPS ranks. 
Conversely, during a market downturn, high EPS rank stocks typically 
experience smaller declines compared to stocks with lower EPS ranks. 
This resilience in bearish conditions further solidifies their appeal to 
investors who seek stability and growth potential in their investment port￾folios. As such, high EPS rank stocks are considered valuable assets that 
can contribute to a well-rounded investment strategy.
Sources Providing the EPS Rank
Investor’s Business Daily is a valuable resource for investors seeking EPS 
rank information. It consistently offers EPS rank data for individual stocks 
in its daily stock tables, allowing investors to readily access this crucial 
metric. Additionally, in the stock tables featuring significant movers, IBD
provides EPS ranks, aiding investors in quickly identifying stocks with 
outstanding earnings performance. To make informed investment deci￾sions, it is advisable to prioritize stocks with an EPS rank of at least 80, 
signifying that their earnings performance surpasses that of over 80% of 
companies in the stock market. For those seeking the cream of the crop 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 127 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM128 • Navigating the Stock Market
in terms of performance, stocks in the 90–99% range are the ones to focus 
on, as they represent the highest echelon of earnings success.
Investors can gain valuable insights by consistently reviewing EPS 
ranks in the Investor’s Business Daily, as well as other reputable sources 
such as Zacks, Reuters, Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Yahoo Finance. 
These sources offer comprehensive data on EPS ranks, aiding investors 
in pinpointing stocks with robust earnings growth histories and consistent 
outperformance. Focusing on stocks with elevated EPS ranks enhances 
the likelihood of selecting companies poised for superior price perfor￾mance in the stock market.
EPS Rank Limitations
While the EPS rank is invaluable for assessing a company’s historical earn￾ings performance, investors must recognize its limitations. Notably, the 
EPS rank relies on past earnings data, offering no insight into a compa￾ny’s future performance or potential for earnings growth beyond histori￾cal trends. Therefore, caution is essential, as investing in high EPS rank 
stocks involves risk due to their typically high valuations and heightened 
market expectations. To mitigate these risks, investors should adopt a 
comprehensive approach, combining fundamental analysis with a focus 
on the stock’s future potential, rather than relying solely on the EPS rank.
To manage the risks associated with high EPS rank stocks, investors 
should base their decisions on sound fundamental analysis, considering 
both historical performance and future growth prospects. Ongoing vig￾ilance is crucial after acquiring such stocks, allowing investors to proac￾tively respond to changes in the company’s outlook and market conditions. 
This approach ensures effective management of investments and the abil￾ity to navigate potential challenges related to stocks with high EPS ranks.
RELATIVE STRENGTH (RS) RANK
This section discusses various aspects of the relative strength rank which 
many investors, especially momentum investors, analyze when evaluating 
a stock.
What RS Rank Indicates
The RS rank serves as a valuable metric for investors seeking to evaluate 
a stock’s price performance compared to its peers in the stock market. 
It focuses on the stock’s price changes over the past year, with a greater 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 128 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 129
emphasis placed on the most recent three-month period in the ranking 
calculations. The resulting RS rank is expressed on a scale from 1 to 99, 
with higher values indicating stronger price performance. This ranking 
system allows investors to identify stocks that have demonstrated superior 
relative strength in the market, showcasing their ability to outperform 
their peers during the given time frame.
Investors often rely on the RS rank as a key indicator of a stock’s price 
momentum and market leadership. Stocks with higher RS ranks are con￾sidered to be more attractive, as they have consistently displayed better 
price performance compared to other stocks in the market. Therefore, 
the RS rank is a valuable tool for investors seeking to identify stocks with 
strong price momentum and a competitive edge over their industry peers.
Favor Stocks With High RS Rank
Investors often prefer stocks with high RS ranks as they signal robust price 
performance and market leadership, serving as a valuable tool to gauge a 
stock’s potential to outperform most of its peers in terms of price momen￾tum. The RS rank provides insights into a stock’s relative strength, aiding 
investors in identifying opportunities for potential market outperformance.
Investors commonly favor stocks with RS ranks exceeding 90, as these 
stocks exhibit robust price momentum and are frequently associated with 
strong market performance. However, it is essential to consider other fac￾tors in addition to the RS rank, as some stocks may display impressive 
price performance but lack sound fundamentals, making them suscepti￾ble to sharp declines. Therefore, while a high RS rank can be a valuable 
indicator for stock selection, a comprehensive analysis that includes other 
relevant factors is advisable to make well-informed investment decisions.
Using RS Rank With Other Criteria
Combining the RS rank with other criteria, such as the EPS rank, offers 
a comprehensive assessment of a stock’s potential. When both ranks sur￾pass 80, it suggests robust performance on two key fronts: fundamental 
strength and price momentum. This blend of strong fundamental and val￾uation metrics, along with a history of robust price performance, indicates 
a stock with excellent growth potential.
Using the RS rank in conjunction with the EPS rank provides a bal￾anced view of a stock’s health. A high RS rank signifies strong price perfor￾mance, while a high EPS rank reflects solid earnings growth. Considering 
both indicators helps identify stocks with consistent growth and market 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 129 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM130 • Navigating the Stock Market
leadership, often seen as attractive investment opportunities. However, a 
comprehensive analysis, including other relevant factors, is crucial for a 
well-informed investment strategy.
RS Rank Can Be Used to Find Winners
Using the RS rank to identify winning stocks is a strategy commonly 
employed by momentum investors. These investors believe that stocks 
with high RS ranks, indicating past outperformance, are likely to continue 
their strong price appreciation in the near future due to their existing 
momentum and upward trends. As a result, they focus on finding winning 
stocks among those with RS ranks greater than 80, effectively filtering out 
underperforming or stagnant stocks. This approach is a departure from 
value investing, which centers on buying stocks when their prices are con￾sidered undervalued or depressed.
Momentum investors understand that the market often rewards 
strength and that stocks with strong recent performance tend to attract 
further investor interest. They leverage RS rank to identify stocks that 
have demonstrated this trend and aim to ride the momentum to capital￾ize on potential future gains. However, it is essential to remember that 
momentum investing can be riskier, and investors should conduct thor￾ough research to ensure they are comfortable with the stocks they choose 
based on RS rank, especially given that past performance is not always 
indicative of future results.
Sources Providing the RS Rank
Investor’s Business Daily stands out as an invaluable resource for inves￾tors, offering the RS rank for individual stocks in its daily stock tables. 
This proprietary RS rating provides a snapshot of a stock’s relative 
strength compared to all other stocks in the IBD database. Investors can 
leverage this information to identify stocks with strong price performance 
and market leadership, aiding in their decision-making process. Beyond 
IBD, investors can explore a range of reputable sources to access RS rank 
data. Prominent financial websites like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and 
Reuters routinely provide RS-related metrics, enhancing the accessibility 
of this critical information. Moreover, brokerage platforms and charting 
tools, including TradingView and Thinkorswim, offer investors the means 
to assess relative strength.
Additionally, online stock screeners play a pivotal role in delivering 
RS rank insights. These screeners, available on financial news websites, 
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 130 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMProfitability and Price Performance • 131
brokerage platforms, and independent stock analysis platforms, empower 
investors to filter and identify stocks based on their relative strength char￾acteristics. Whether checking daily stock tables, exploring financial news 
websites, or utilizing advanced charting tools, investors have a wealth of 
options to analyze RS ranks and integrate this valuable metric into their 
stock evaluation strategies.
Risk With High RS Rank Stocks
While a high RS rank can be an attractive indicator of a stock’s strong 
price performance, investors should exercise caution and conduct com￾prehensive due diligence. One key risk of owning a high RS rank stock is 
that it may have already experienced substantial price appreciation, and 
its best days in terms of growth may be behind it. Investors should not 
solely rely on RS rank and must consider other factors, such as the com￾pany’s fundamentals and earnings projections, to ensure they are mak￾ing a well-informed investment decision. High RS rank should ideally be 
accompanied by strong earnings growth and other positive fundamental 
factors to increase the likelihood of a successful investment.
Investors should be aware that superior historical performance, as 
indicated by a high RS rank, does not guarantee future success. The future 
performance of a stock depends on various factors, including future earn￾ings, market conditions, and economic trends. Therefore, RS rank should 
be used as a screening indicator, and a more in-depth analysis of a stock’s 
fundamental health and prospects is necessary to make a well-rounded 
investment decision. By considering a combination of both price momen￾tum and strong fundamentals, investors can better position themselves for 
success while managing potential risks.
Monitor Your Stock’s RS Rank
For momentum-oriented investors, tracking the RS rank is a crucial part 
of their strategy, and any decline in this indicator can serve as an early 
warning sign. A decreasing RS rank while a stock is moving sideways or 
even rising could indicate that the stock is not keeping up with the broader 
market’s performance. This can be a signal that the stock might be enter￾ing a period of underperformance or a potential decline. However, if a 
stock maintains its RS rank and performs relatively well during a market 
decline when the RS of leading stocks is dropping, it suggests that the 
stock has resilience and the potential to become a winner. In such cases, 
when the market rebounds, these stocks may have a higher probability of 
outperforming.
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 131 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PM132 • Navigating the Stock Market
Furthermore, when a stock’s price starts to decline, which typically 
precedes a drop in the RS rank, it can serve as an early warning sign of a 
more significant decline in the future. Investors should closely investigate 
and monitor such stocks that exhibit price declines, especially those that 
persist over several months. This vigilant monitoring can help investors 
make timely decisions to protect their investments and potentially identify 
opportunities for portfolio adjustments.
Use Relative Strength (RS) Line for Comparison
The RS line is a valuable tool for investors to gauge a stock’s price trend 
and compare its performance against broader market indexes like the 
S&P 500 or NASDAQ. When analyzing a stock’s uptrend, the RS line can 
be used in conjunction with the moving average line to confirm the stock’s 
overall performance. Once a trend line is established, it typically continues 
for some time, making it advisable to favor stocks with a higher-trending 
RS line. In cases where a stock experiences a correction, but the RS line 
remains unaffected and does not decline, this is generally considered a 
bullish sign. Contrastingly, if the rising RS line trend is broken, it is viewed 
as a bearish signal, potentially indicating a shift in the stock’s performance 
relative to the broader market.
Investors often use the RS line as an additional data point in their 
technical analysis toolkit to make more informed decisions about stock 
investments. By tracking the RS line alongside other relevant indicators, 
they can gain insights into a stock’s relative strength or weakness, helping 
them identify opportunities and assess the overall market environment 
more effectively.
NSM_CH07_3pp.indd 132 2/6/2024 1:55:09 PMCHAPTER
UNDERSTANDING THE P/E RATIO INDICATOR
The significance of the P/E ratio is discussed in this section, where insights 
are provided to gauge the valuation of individual stocks, sectors, as well as 
the overall market.
Learn Valuation Techniques
Learning valuation techniques is a crucial skill for anyone participating 
in the stock market, whether as a buyer or a seller. When you understand 
how to determine the value of stocks, you can make more informed deci￾sions, ensuring that you don’t overpay when acquiring a stock. Overpaying 
can hinder your ability to achieve your profit objectives, so having a solid 
grasp of valuation techniques is essential for successful investing.
Moreover, knowing how to value stocks enables you to assess when 
it is the right time to sell a stock in your portfolio. You can identify over￾valued stocks and make more strategic decisions about when to divest. 
This knowledge is invaluable in avoiding common mistakes, such as pre￾maturely selling winning stocks, which could lead to missed opportunities 
for further gains. By mastering the indicators used for stock valuation, you 
can make more precise and profitable investment choices.
How P/E Ratio Is Calculated
The price-to-earnings ratio is a fundamental valuation tool, which 
provides valuable insights into a stock’s relative affordability and is a cru￾cial indicator for many investors. To calculate the P/E ratio, you simply 
divide the current stock price, denoted in dollars ($), by the earnings per 
Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio
8
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 133 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AM134 • Navigating the Stock Market
share, which is represented as $/share. For example, if a stock is currently 
trading at $50 and it has earned $2 per share, the P/E ratio would be cal￾culated as 25 (50/2). In this context, the P/E ratio is essentially a measure 
of how much an investor is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings gen￾erated by the company.
Investors typically aim for a lower P/E ratio, as it implies that they 
are paying less for each dollar of earnings. The exact range of what consti￾tutes an acceptable P/E ratio may vary depending on the investor’s strat￾egy, risk tolerance, and the industry or sector in which the stock operates. 
Some investors may prefer stocks with lower P/E ratios, signifying poten￾tial value investments, while others may be willing to pay a premium for 
stocks with higher P/E ratios if they believe in their growth prospects.
Importance of the P/E Indicator
The P/E ratio is an essential indicator for investors, particularly for value 
investors who seek to find undervalued stocks in the market. It serves as 
one of the foundational metrics for evaluating a stock’s relative worth by 
establishing a relationship between the stock’s price and its EPS. This 
makes the P/E ratio a critical tool for assessing whether a stock is trading 
at an attractive or unattractive valuation and for comparing it to other 
stocks in the market. By leveraging the P/E ratio, investors can identify 
stocks that are reasonably priced, potentially enabling them to avoid 
overpaying. In doing so, they increase the prospects of achieving above￾average returns as they invest in stocks with stronger potential for future 
price appreciation.
Nonetheless, it is crucial for investors to recognize the limitations of the 
P/E ratio and exercise caution when using it to select, value, or time their 
stock investments. The P/E ratio, while valuable, is just one piece of the 
puzzle in stock valuation. It does not provide a comprehensive view of a 
company’s financial health, nor does it factor in the company’s growth 
potential or the broader market conditions. Therefore, it should be used 
in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to form 
a well-rounded evaluation of a stock’s investment potential.
P/E Ratios for Individual Stocks, Overall Market, and Sectors
The P/E ratio is a pivotal metric for assessing the valuation of individual 
stocks, which is a fundamental analysis cornerstone. Investors must dis￾cern whether the reported P/E ratio is based on trailing earnings or pro￾jected earnings, as this distinction provides essential context for evaluating 
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 134 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMPrice/Earnings (P/E) Ratio • 135
the stock’s current valuation. Employing the P/E ratio as a key indicator, 
investors can gauge whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued, poten￾tially identifying buying opportunities or warranting caution. The analysis 
of individual stock P/E ratios empowers investors with valuable insights, 
facilitating informed decision-making and comparisons among different 
stocks within their portfolio.
In addition to scrutinizing individual stock P/E ratios, investors 
frequently compute the P/E ratio for broader market indexes, like the 
DJIA or the S&P 500, to gauge overall market valuation. The DJIA’s P/E 
ratio, calculated by dividing its current value by the combined earnings 
of its thirty constituent companies, offers insight into the entire index’s 
valuation relative to collective earnings. Similarly, investors assess P/E 
ratios for sectors by summing individual components’ values. This anal￾ysis of market indexes and sectors enables investors to discern overall 
market conditions, identifying potential overvaluation or undervaluation. 
A high P/E ratio suggests a bullish sentiment and possible overvalua￾tion, while a low ratio indicates a more conservative outlook, signaling 
potential undervaluation and buying opportunities. Combining these 
broader market P/E ratios with individual stock ratios empowers inves￾tors to make informed decisions and navigate the dynamic landscape of 
the stock market.
Trailing P/E Ratio Is Backward Looking
The trailing P/E ratio is based on a stock’s most recently reported earnings, 
which means it offers a retrospective look at a company’s valuation in relation 
to its historical earnings. This historical perspective is valuable for assessing 
how a company has performed in the past and understanding its current 
valuation relative to its earnings. It is important to note that the trailing P/E 
ratio primarily reflects past performance and does not inherently provide 
insights into a company’s future growth potential or expected earnings.
For a more comprehensive view of a stock’s investment poten￾tial, investors should consider a forward-looking perspective as well. 
Combining trailing P/E ratios with forward-looking indicators, such as 
projected earnings growth rates, can help paint a more complete pic￾ture. This dual approach allows investors to evaluate a company’s past 
performance while considering its future growth prospects, ultimately 
making more informed investment decisions. In summary, while trailing 
P/E ratios are valuable for historical context, they should be used along￾side other metrics and analysis for a more holistic assessment of a stock’s 
investment attractiveness.
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 135 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AM136 • Navigating the Stock Market
Use Projected P/E Ratio to Determine Future Prospects
To gauge a stock’s future prospects more accurately, investors often turn to 
the projected P/E ratio, which is calculated by dividing the current stock 
price by estimated future earnings per share. This valuation metric is con￾sidered more valuable for assessing a stock’s potential performance than 
the trailing P/E ratio because it better aligns with the stock’s anticipated 
future earnings. Long-term investors, who tend to have a forward-looking 
approach, frequently rely on projected earnings to guide their valuations 
and predict future price appreciation. The use of the P/E ratio based on 
projected earnings is common in many analyses.
Utilizing the projected P/E ratio for stock valuation can help investors 
make more informed decisions and anticipate potential price movements. 
Nevertheless, it’s vital to remember that projections are based on esti￾mates and can be subject to change, so a well-rounded assessment should 
also consider other fundamental and market-related factors when evalu￾ating a stock’s future prospects.
Relative P/E Indicates Historical Range
The relative P/E ratio, which is a stock’s current P/E ratio compared to its 
historical range over a period of months or years, plays a crucial role in 
stock valuation. Value investors, in particular, find this indicator valuable 
in assessing a stock’s valuation. When a stock trades near the lower end 
of its historical P/E range, it is often seen as fairly valued or even under￾valued, making it a potential buy candidate. Conversely, when the P/E 
ratio reaches the upper end of its historical range, it signals that the stock 
might be overvalued. It is important to note that buying or selling deci￾sions should not be based solely on this indicator, as other fundamental 
factors should be considered in conjunction with the relative P/E.
Using the relative P/E provides investors with valuable insights into a 
stock’s valuation compared to its historical performance. But it is crucial to 
avoid making investment decisions based solely on the historical range of 
the P/E ratio. Careful fundamental analysis and consideration of current 
market conditions are essential to make well-informed investment choices.
UNDERSTANDING P/E RATIO VARIATIONS
There are many factors at play in the investment world which impact 
earnings and prices. Therefore, when they change, which can happen 
quite frequently, they lead to variations in the P/E ratio. These factors are 
discussed in this section.
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 136 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMPrice/Earnings (P/E) Ratio • 137
Factors Causing the P/E Ratio to Fluctuate
The P/E ratio is a dynamic valuation tool that reflects the interaction of 
two key variables: a stock’s price and its earnings. These variables contrib￾ute to the numerator and denominator of the P/E ratio, respectively. The 
stock price undergoes frequent fluctuations, often on a daily basis, leading 
to corresponding changes in the numerator. Consequently, the P/E ratio 
can change rapidly, reflecting the dynamic nature of the stock market.
The second variable, earnings, forms the denominator of the P/E 
ratio. Earnings are reported on a quarterly basis, and these periodic 
updates affect the P/E ratio, either increasing or decreasing depending on 
the earnings performance. As a long-term investor, it is crucial to focus on 
the broader picture and not be swayed by daily fluctuations. Over the long 
term, a stock’s price tends to align with its earnings and overall financial 
health. By maintaining a long-term perspective, you can better navigate 
the daily noise and fluctuations in the P/E ratio, allowing you to make 
more informed investment decisions.
Factors Causing the P/E Ratio to Expand
A significant driver of P/E ratio expansion is the positive perception by 
investors that a stock’s future earnings will grow. When investors anticipate 
such growth, it generates heightened interest and attracts new capital into 
the stock. As a result, the stock price rises, causing the P/E ratio to expand 
as the numerator (stock price) increases. This increase reflects the market’s 
optimism about the company’s potential for higher earnings in the future.
Another factor contributing to P/E ratio expansion is an improvement 
in the return on equity. A higher ROE captures the attention of inves￾tors seeking superior returns on their investments, making them willing 
to pay a premium for stocks with a stronger ROE. This elevated interest 
from investors further drives the expansion of the P/E ratio. Additionally, 
an increase in institutional ownership can also push the P/E ratio higher. 
As more institutional investors acquire shares of the stock, it indicates 
their confidence in the company’s growth potential, leading to an upward 
movement in the P/E ratio as institutional ownership increases.
P/E Ratios Vary in a Wide Range Across Industries
P/E ratios exhibit significant variability across different industries and 
sectors, reflecting varying expectations related to industry growth, earn￾ings projections, and risk factors. Optimism about a company’s or indus￾try’s future earnings potential plays a pivotal role in determining its P/E 
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 137 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AM138 • Navigating the Stock Market
ratio. In industries or sectors with strong growth prospects, P/E ratios 
tend to be higher as investors are willing to pay a premium for a piece 
of that growth. A stock’s P/E ratio depends on its industry and individual 
growth rate. Higher growth rates are often linked to increased risk and, 
consequently, a higher P/E ratio, as investors are willing to pay more for 
companies showing superior growth prospects.
It is essential to assess and compare your stock’s P/E ratio against 
industry benchmarks to better understand its valuation within the context 
of its sector. Analyzing P/E ratios within an industry context can help inves￾tors identify stocks that are trading above or below the sector’s average. 
This comparison can be useful for discerning relative valuations and poten￾tial investment opportunities. A P/E ratio that significantly deviates from 
industry norms might signal either an overvalued or undervalued stock, 
depending on whether it is trading at a premium or discount to its peers 
within the same sector. While comparing P/E ratios, investors should also 
consider other relevant factors, such as the company’s growth prospects, 
competitive positioning, and its capacity to generate consistent earnings.
Avoid Extreme P/E Ratios
Investors are generally advised to steer clear of stocks with extreme P/E 
ratio values, as both very low P/E (below 5) and very high P/E (over 35) 
can be problematic. Extremely low P/E ratios may suggest that the com￾pany is facing significant challenges, experiencing declining earnings, or 
is in financial distress. Such stocks may be perceived as having a higher 
level of risk, and investors should be cautious when considering invest￾ments with very low P/E ratios. Contrastingly, extremely high P/E ratios 
often require justifications in the form of exceptional revenue and earn￾ings growth rates. High-growth stocks might have P/E ratios within the 
range of 20–40 without being considered overvalued. Nevertheless, it is 
crucial for investors to be aware of the inherent risks associated with high 
P/E ratio stocks, particularly when they are unable to meet market expec￾tations. These stocks can be highly volatile and may experience substantial 
price declines if they fail to deliver on their anticipated growth.
Investors should exercise caution when dealing with extreme P/E 
ratios, as they may signal the need for thorough due diligence. It is essen￾tial to carefully assess the underlying reasons for the stock’s P/E ratio, 
including whether it aligns with the company’s earnings, growth prospects, 
and overall financial health. While high-growth stocks with high P/E ratios 
can be rewarding, they also come with heightened risks. Therefore, a bal￾anced approach that considers both potential returns and associated risks 
is advisable when investing in stocks with extreme P/E ratios.
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 138 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMPrice/Earnings (P/E) Ratio • 139
Economic Cycle Impacts the P/E Ratio
The economic cycle exerts a significant influence on the P/E ratio, reflect￾ing the relationship between a company’s earnings and the broader eco￾nomic environment. In periods of slow economic growth, companies, 
especially large corporations, may struggle to increase their earnings, 
making it challenging for them to achieve substantial P/E multiples. 
During these times, investors tend to favor companies that are still capa￾ble of delivering above-average earnings, which results in these com￾panies receiving higher P/E ratios as investors value their potential for 
growth. In contrast, economic recessions often result in sharp declines 
in earnings, leading to a significant increase in P/E ratios. As earnings 
decline, stock prices also decrease until P/E ratios align with the lower 
earnings. This alignment is considered a more reasonable valuation level, 
especially during challenging economic periods.
Conversely, when the economy emerges from a recession, stock 
prices tend to rebound rapidly, outpacing the growth in earnings. This 
leads to an increase in P/E ratios, as the stock market anticipates brighter 
earnings prospects. As companies begin to report higher earnings, P/E 
ratios may eventually decrease to more sustainable levels. Understanding 
the cyclical nature of the P/E ratio and its relationship with economic con￾ditions is crucial for investors, as it can help them make more informed 
decisions about when to buy or sell stocks based on the prevailing eco￾nomic environment.
Inflation and Interest Rates Impact the P/E Ratio
Inflation and interest rates play a vital role in shaping the P/E ratio and 
are closely monitored by investors. The relationship between these fac￾tors and the P/E ratio is interconnected. During periods of high inflation, 
interest rates tend to rise to counter the impact of rising prices on the 
economy. As interest rates increase, the P/E ratios often decline. This 
is because higher interest rates lead to higher borrowing costs for busi￾nesses, which can reduce their profitability and potentially hinder earn￾ings growth. As a result, investors may be less willing to pay a premium for 
stocks, causing P/E ratios to contract.
Conversely, in environments characterized by low and controlled infla￾tion, market valuations typically soar, leading to higher P/E ratios. When 
inflation is subdued, interest rates tend to remain low, which reduces bor￾rowing costs for companies, supports profitability, and encourages inves￾tors to pay more for stocks. These conditions can result in elevated P/E 
ratios as investors express optimism about the future earnings prospects 
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 139 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AM140 • Navigating the Stock Market
of companies. Therefore, the interplay between inflation, interest rates, 
and the P/E ratio is a critical factor for investors to consider when assess￾ing stock market valuations.
USING THE P/E INDICATOR
This section discusses the importance of P/E for various investment 
approaches and, also, various ways in which it can be used, such as using 
it as a comparison tool or for checking valuations. 
P/E Ratio Usage Is Determined by Investment Approach
The utilization of the P/E ratio as a valuation indicator varies depending 
on the investment approach. Investors should understand that the P/E 
ratio is just one piece of the puzzle and must be considered in the context 
of their overall strategy. For momentum investors who prioritize price 
performance over valuation, the P/E ratio may hold little relevance, as 
they focus on trends and market sentiment. Value investors, however, rely 
on the P/E ratio as a screening tool to identify potentially undervalued 
stocks that have low P/E ratios.
Growth investors incorporate the P/E ratio into their analysis, but 
their primary concern is the company’s future earnings growth rate. They 
may be more lenient with higher P/E ratios if a company has a strong 
growth outlook. Generally, they consider a stock to be overvalued only 
if its P/E ratio exceeds its projected earnings growth rate. In summary, 
the P/E ratio is a versatile tool, and its application should align with the 
specific investment strategy and objectives of the investor. It is important 
to use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and funda￾mental analysis to make informed investment decisions.
Use P/E Ratio as a Comparison Tool
The P/E ratio is most effective when used as a comparison tool rather than 
being treated as a standalone number. When evaluating a stock, it is essen￾tial to compare its P/E ratio to those of similar companies within the same 
industry. P/E ratios can vary significantly across industries due to differ￾ences in growth expectations, earnings potential, and risk profiles. By com￾paring a stock’s P/E ratio to industry peers, you can gain valuable insights into 
whether it is overvalued, undervalued, or in line with market expectations.
Additionally, comparing the current P/E ratio to its historical P/E ratio 
is a crucial step in assessing a stock’s valuation. Understanding whether 
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 140 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMPrice/Earnings (P/E) Ratio • 141
the P/E ratio is at the high or low end of its historical range can provide 
context and help identify potential investment opportunities or red flags. 
It is essential to note that comparing a stock’s P/E ratio to the market’s 
collective P/E ratio, as represented by indexes like the DJIA or S&P 500, 
can lead to misleading conclusions since individual stocks and industries 
often have unique dynamics that differ from the broader market trends.
Favor Stocks at the Low End of Their Historical P/E Range
The relative P/E ratio is a valuable tool for investors seeking to make 
informed decisions about stocks based on their historical valuation. This 
indicator compares the current P/E ratio of a stock to its own historical 
P/E range. When analyzing the relative P/E ratio, it is important to con￾sider a stock’s historical trading range, as it can vary over time due to 
changes in earnings and stock prices. For example, if a stock has histor￾ically traded with a P/E ratio ranging from 20 to 45, a relative P/E ratio 
of 100 would indicate that it is currently trading at the upper end of its 
historical valuation range.
Investors, particularly value and growth investors, tend to favor stocks 
with a relative P/E ratio at the lower end of their historical range. This 
preference arises from the belief that buying a stock with a relatively low 
P/E compared to its historical norm offers reduced downside risk, as it 
implies a more reasonable valuation. It is important to note that momen￾tum investors, who focus on short-term price trends, do not typically con￾sider the relative P/E ratio when making investment decisions.
What a Consistently High P/E Ratio Means
A consistently high P/E ratio for a stock can be an indicator of investors’ 
strong expectations for continued rapid earnings growth. In many cases, 
stocks with P/E ratios that remain higher than what is considered nor￾mal for an extended period, quarter after quarter, are seen as potential 
winners and leaders in their respective sectors. Investors’ confidence in 
the growth prospects of these companies typically leads to elevated P/E 
ratios. It is common for these leaders to have P/E ratios above the mar￾ket’s average P/E ratio at the beginning of a significant upward move. This 
is because investors are willing to pay a premium for companies that they 
anticipate will experience strong earnings growth.
These stocks may not meet the criteria for value investors who 
adhere to stringent P/E screening standards. Value investors typically 
seek stocks with lower P/E ratios, and they may be hesitant to invest in 
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 141 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AM142 • Navigating the Stock Market
companies with P/E ratios that are significantly higher than the market’s 
average. They often focus on stocks that are perceived as undervalued 
and trading at lower multiples relative to their earnings. Consequently, 
the suitability of stocks with consistently high P/E ratios depends on 
the investor’s specific strategy and preferences.
Use P/E-to-Projected Growth Rate Indicator to Check Valuation
The P/E-to-projected growth rate (P/E-to-PGR) indicator is a valuable 
tool for evaluating the valuation of growth stocks. To calculate this indica￾tor, you divide the stock’s current P/E ratio by its expected annual earnings 
growth rate. For example, if a stock has a P/E ratio of 30 and is projected 
to have an annual earnings growth rate of 40%, the P/E-to-projected 
growth ratio would be 0.75 (30/40). Ideally, the ratio should be below 1.0, 
suggesting an appealing investment. When the ratio is less than 0.75, it 
suggests that the stock is particularly appealing from a valuation perspec￾tive. Conversely, if the ratio exceeds 1.25, it implies that the stock may be 
overvalued and associated with higher risk.
This indicator is helpful in assessing whether a growth stock’s cur￾rent valuation aligns with its expected future earnings growth. An attrac￾tive P/E-to-PGR ratio suggests that investors are not paying an excessive 
premium for future growth potential, making the stock more appealing. 
Conversely, a high P/E-to-PGR ratio may indicate that the stock’s price 
already reflects aggressive growth expectations, potentially posing greater 
downside risk if those expectations are not met. 
P/E RATIO RISKS
The P/E ratio is a useful tool that needs to be used carefully, as there are 
some risks associated with its use, which are discussed in this section.
Be Aware of Distortions
It is essential to be aware of potential distortions in the P/E ratio, par￾ticularly when dealing with projected P/E ratios. Inaccurate or overly 
optimistic projected earnings can lead to misleading valuations. These 
projections are inherently uncertain, making it crucial to approach them 
with caution when relying on the P/E-to-PGR indicator. Additionally, 
unusual accounting events, such as reported losses or one-time charges, 
can distort earnings figures, affecting the accuracy of the P/E ratio. When 
assessing a stock’s value, it is essential to consider the context of such 
events and their impact on earnings.
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 142 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMPrice/Earnings (P/E) Ratio • 143
Another important consideration is the P/E ratio for young companies 
experiencing rapid earnings growth. While a high P/E ratio may suggest 
overvaluation, it is crucial to assess whether this growth is sustainable or 
a result of short-term factors. In such cases, it is wise to look beyond the 
P/E ratio and conduct a thorough analysis of the company’s fundamentals 
and growth prospects to avoid making decisions based solely on poten￾tially misleading valuations. By recognizing the limitations of the P/E indi￾cator and employing it alongside other fundamental and valuation tools, 
investors can make more informed and well-rounded investment choices.
High P/E Stocks Can Be Risky
Investing in high P/E stocks can be inherently risky, as these stocks are often 
priced for perfection. The market expects these companies to continue 
delivering exceptional growth and profitability, and any deviation from this 
can lead to sharp and sometimes brutal corrections in the stock price. The 
magnitude of the price decline tends to be more significant for stocks with 
higher P/E ratios, reflecting the heightened investor expectations and the 
disappointment that can ensue when those expectations are not met.
While high P/E stocks can offer substantial returns when everything 
goes as anticipated, investors should be aware of the potential downside 
and be prepared for increased volatility and risk. Due diligence and care￾ful analysis of a high P/E stock’s fundamentals, growth prospects, and the 
sustainability of its earnings are essential to make informed investment 
decisions and mitigate the risks associated with such investments.
Low P/E Stocks Can Be Risky
Low P/E stocks can be deceptive, and investors should exercise caution 
when interpreting their valuations. A low P/E ratio may indeed signal an 
undervalued stock, but it can also be an indicator of underlying issues 
or negative market sentiment surrounding the company. In some cases, 
a low P/E ratio might be justified due to concerns about the company’s 
earnings potential, financial stability, or competitive pressures, making it 
a value trap rather than an attractive investment opportunity.
When considering low P/E stocks, it is crucial to conduct thorough 
due diligence and understand the reasons behind the low valuation. 
Investors should evaluate the company’s fundamentals, assess its poten￾tial for earnings growth or decline, and consider whether the low P/E 
is justified or if it represents an opportunity for value investing. Simply 
buying a stock with the lowest P/E ratio within its industry or sector can 
be risky without a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving 
that low valuation.
NSM_CH08_2pp.indd 143 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMNSM_CH08_2pp.indd 144 1/25/2024 11:32:49 AMCHAPTER
GENERAL
Individual stocks operate in the stock market, not in an isolated environ￾ment. This section discusses market behavior and analyzes it from differ￾ent perspectives.
Learn How to Interpret Market Behavior
Understanding the dynamics of the market is an essential skill for inves￾tors. The market’s condition and trends, whether it is in a bull or bear 
phase, have a direct and significant impact on the performance of most 
stocks. As such, investors cannot afford to ignore the prevailing market 
sentiment and direction. To make informed investment decisions, it is 
crucial to interpret market behavior accurately.
Recognizing the difference between bull and bear markets, as well 
as understanding how to navigate each scenario, is fundamental for inves￾tors. In a bull market, investors aim to maximize their exposure to stocks, 
while in a bear market, they often reduce their stock holdings to mitigate 
potential losses. Being able to adapt your investment strategy and tac￾tics in response to the market’s health is crucial for long-term success as 
an investor. Additionally, recognizing and preparing for different market 
conditions, such as choppy or volatile markets, allows investors to make 
more informed choices regarding their portfolios.
The Stock Market Has a Discounting Mechanism
The stock market operates as a forward-looking discounting mecha￾nism. It evaluates and processes information with a focus on its poten￾tial impact on individual stocks and the market as a whole, often looking 
Market Behavior

ahead 6–9 months. This forward-looking approach allows the market to 
anticipate future events and adjust stock prices accordingly. For instance, 
when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduc￾tion in the federal funds interest rate, even though its actual economic 
stimulus effects may take several months to materialize, the stock market 
reacts positively immediately. This rapid reaction reflects Wall Street’s 
emphasis on pricing in future prospects and expected impacts well ahead 
of time.
Similarly, the stock market’s behavior regarding individual companies 
is forward focused. If a company announces record earnings but also sig￾nals an anticipated slowdown in future growth, investors react promptly 
by selling off the stock. This is because, on Wall Street, historical perfor￾mance is given less importance compared to future earnings expectations. 
Therefore, when analyzing a stock, it becomes essential to gauge how 
much of its future earnings are already factored into its current price, as 
this can significantly influence investment decisions.
Learn How to Determine Market Trend
Understanding market trends is essential for investors because the overall 
market behavior significantly impacts individual stocks. Approximately 
75% of the time in the long term, the market typically trends in a bull￾ish direction. During bullish periods, the overall positive sentiment sets 
a favorable tone for most stocks. Investors tend to be more optimistic, 
leading to higher stock prices and increased trading volumes. This posi￾tive sentiment can fuel an upward momentum that benefits the majority 
of stocks. It is important to remember that while most stocks may rise 
during a bullish market, not all stocks perform equally, and careful stock 
selection is still necessary to maximize potential returns.
Conversely, when the market is in a bearish trend or experiencing a 
decline, it tends to drag most stocks down with it. In bear markets, inves￾tors often become more risk-averse, leading to declining stock prices, 
lower trading volumes, and a generally pessimistic sentiment. Even 
though some individual stocks may display temporary resilience or out￾performance during a bear market, the broader negative sentiment can 
create challenges for stock valuations and price appreciation. Therefore, 
investors need to recognize the prevailing market trends and make 
well-informed investment decisions that align with the market’s overall 
direction. This may involve adjusting their investment strategies, portfolio 
allocation, or risk management approaches to navigate the ever-changing 
market conditions.

Learn How to Identify Market Tops and Bottoms
Identifying market tops and bottoms is a crucial skill for investors who aim 
to maximize their returns and manage their risk effectively. Market tops 
usually occur when the stock market becomes significantly overvalued, 
often due to excessive speculation and optimism. During these periods, 
there are fewer buyers left, and stock prices may have risen to unsustain￾able levels. Recognizing a market top can be beneficial for investors, as it 
provides an opportunity to assess their portfolios and consider reducing 
their exposure to stocks. This proactive approach may help them avoid 
significant losses when the market inevitably experiences a correction or 
bear market.
Significantly, market bottoms are characterized by an oversold con￾dition where there are few sellers left, causing the market to stabilize. 
Identifying a market bottom can provide investors with a chance to accu￾mulate undervalued stocks at attractive prices, as stocks are expected to 
rebound from these low levels. Successful timing of market bottoms can 
lead to substantial gains when the market begins to recover. It is important 
to note that accurately pinpointing market tops and bottoms is challeng￾ing and often requires experience, market analysis, and an understanding 
of market sentiment. It is essential for investors to use a combination of 
technical and fundamental analysis, as well as risk management strategies, 
to make well-informed decisions during these critical market junctures.
Use Market Declines as Buying Opportunities
Bear markets and corrections can indeed be challenging and unsettling 
for investors, but they also offer significant potential for long-term gains 
for those who are prepared and proactive. While market declines can 
lead to short-term losses, they present excellent buying opportunities for 
investors with a longer-term perspective. History has shown that the most 
substantial profits, in terms of percentage gains, are often realized when 
the market begins to rebound from a bear market or a correction. These 
rebounds can be powerful, and investors who are well-prepared and posi￾tioned to take advantage of them can benefit greatly from the subsequent 
recovery.
To make the most of these opportunities, it is crucial to have a 
well-thought-out investment strategy that includes plans for capital allo￾cation and risk management. During bear markets and corrections, hav￾ing a portion of your portfolio in cash or liquid assets can provide you with 
the flexibility to purchase undervalued assets when market sentiment is 
at its most pessimistic. Being able to buy stocks at attractive prices when 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 147 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AM148 • Navigating the Stock Market
others are selling can lead to substantial gains when the market eventually 
recovers. Additionally, it is essential to remain patient and maintain a 
long-term perspective, as bear markets and corrections can be followed 
by periods of strong market growth and upward trends.
Be Aware of Limitations in Forecasting Market Levels Accurately
Forecasting the future state of the economy and the stock market is a 
challenging task, and it is fraught with uncertainties. Economic forecasts 
are influenced by various complex factors, making it difficult to predict 
with precision. Economic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, con￾sumer sentiment, and geopolitical events can all have a significant impact 
on economic growth and stock market performance. Even seasoned pro￾fessionals may face challenges in making accurate predictions, given the 
dynamic and interconnected nature of these factors.
It is important for investors to be aware of the limitations in fore￾casting economic and market levels accurately. Instead of relying solely 
on economic forecasts, it is advisable to focus on creating a diversified 
and resilient investment portfolio that can weather different market con￾ditions. Diversification can help mitigate risk, as it involves spreading 
investments across various asset classes and sectors, reducing the impact 
of adverse market movements. Additionally, maintaining a long-term per￾spective and regularly reviewing and adjusting your investment strategy 
can help you navigate the uncertainties of economic forecasting and adapt 
to changing market conditions.
BULL AND BEAR MARKET CHARACTERISTICS
The stock market is characterized by two stock price trends, rising and 
declining. The characteristics of these trends, better known as bull and 
bear markets, are described in this section.
What Is a Bull Market?
A bull market is a prolonged period in which the stock market experi￾ences an overall uptrend, characterized by rising stock prices and a posi￾tive investor sentiment. It is a period of optimism and economic growth, 
where investors have confidence in the future and are willing to buy and 
hold stocks. Typically, a bull market lasts for an extended period, often sev￾eral years, during which stock prices steadily climb higher. This upward 
trend is not without minor setbacks or pullbacks, but the overall trajectory 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 148 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AMMarket Behavior • 149
is positive, and these pullbacks are seen as temporary corrections rather 
than signs of a market reversal.
The duration of a bull market can vary, but it is generally character￾ized as such when the market experiences a price increase of over 20%. 
Investors actively participate in a bull market, and it is often associated 
with strong economic fundamentals, increasing corporate earnings, and a 
positive outlook for various sectors of the economy. During a bull market, 
investors are more inclined to take on risk, and there is a general belief 
that stock prices will continue to rise, which can create a self-fulfilling 
prophecy as demand for stocks drives their prices higher. This positive 
sentiment encourages investment and stimulates economic growth.
What Is a Bear Market?
A bear market is a period of declining stock prices, characterized by pes￾simism, economic uncertainty, and general negative sentiment among 
investors. It follows a period of bullishness and signifies a significant and 
sustained downturn in the stock market. While the downward movement 
is not always a continuous decline and may include short-term rallies 
or upward movements, the overall trend is one of falling stock prices. A 
bear market is typically characterized by a decrease of approximately 20% 
or more in the value of a broad market index, such as the S&P 500. These 
periods can last for several months to over a year, and investors may expe￾rience significant losses during this time.
During a bear market, economic conditions are often challenging, and 
investors become more risk averse. Factors such as economic recessions, 
geopolitical instability, high inflation, rising interest rates, or corporate 
earnings declines can contribute to the onset of a bear market. Investor 
sentiment turns negative, and there is a general lack of confidence in the 
future direction of the market. As a result, investors may sell stocks and 
move their investments to safer assets, like bonds or cash, to protect their 
portfolios from further losses. Bear markets can be a challenging time for 
investors, and it is important to have a strategy in place to navigate these 
periods and minimize potential losses.
How a Bull Market Starts
Bull markets typically begin when extreme fear and pessimism dominate 
the market landscape after a significant decline. At the bottom of the mar￾ket cycle, when investors are most fearful and uncertainty abounds, the 
stage is set for a potential bull market. As the market starts to recover and 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 149 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AM150 • Navigating the Stock Market
climb, fear gradually diminishes. Investors begin to cautiously reenter the 
market, often driven by bargain-hunting and the belief that prices have hit 
attractive levels. As the recovery continues and gains momentum, caution 
transitions into optimism.
The bull market gains further traction as investors gain confidence 
and become increasingly euphoric, believing that the upward trend will 
persist indefinitely. During this phase, speculative behavior becomes 
more pronounced, and investors may disregard or forget the challenges 
of the preceding bear market. As a result, stock prices rise more rapidly 
as demand surges, and the optimism reinforces itself. This cycle of sen￾timent changes from extreme fear to optimism and, eventually, euphoria 
characterizes the beginning and early stages of a bull market. While it can 
be a rewarding period for investors, it is essential to exercise caution and 
maintain a disciplined approach to avoid the pitfalls of excessive specula￾tion and overconfidence.
How a Bear Market Start
Bear markets typically begin when investors exhibit extreme confidence 
and euphoria, often driven by an extended period of market success. 
During the late stages of a bull market, investors become increasingly 
complacent and dismissive of risk. This exuberance leads to excessive val￾uations and speculative behavior, creating a market top. As the market 
reaches this zenith, the optimism becomes unsustainable, and the first 
signs of trouble emerge. When a catalyst triggers a downturn or economic 
concerns intensify, the optimistic sentiment begins to unravel.
As the market starts its descent, investor emotions reverse, transi￾tioning from confidence to caution and, ultimately, fear. The declines are 
often marked by significant selloffs and increasing volatility. During this 
period, investors grapple with uncertainty and mounting losses, leading to 
widespread pessimism. The bottom of the bear market is characterized by 
extreme fear and a belief that the market will continue its descent indefi￾nitely. At this point, the bear market is exhausted, and the groundwork is 
laid for the eventual start of a new bull market. Recognizing these emo￾tional shifts is crucial for investors to navigate market cycles effectively 
and make informed decisions.
Why Many Bull Markets Start During Recessions
Bull markets often find their roots in the midst of a recession because 
economic conditions and investor sentiment are at their most pessimis￾tic. During a recession, corporate profits decline, unemployment rates 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 150 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AMMarket Behavior • 151
rise, and consumers tighten their spending. As a result, the stock market 
reflects these low expectations, causing prices to drop. To counter this 
economic downturn and promote recovery, central banks, like the Federal 
Reserve, employ monetary policy tools, primarily lowering interest rates. 
By lowering interest rates, borrowing becomes more affordable for busi￾nesses and consumers, encouraging spending, investment, and economic 
growth. This policy creates a favorable environment for corporations to 
improve their profitability, as lower borrowing costs can enhance their 
earnings.
As the economy stabilizes and corporate profits begin to show signs 
of improvement, investor sentiment gradually shifts from pessimism to 
optimism. The perceived potential for higher profits encourages renewed 
interest in the stock market, leading to increased buying activity and sub￾sequent price gains. This combination of positive sentiment and improved 
economic conditions contributes to the development of a new bull mar￾ket. Bull markets often start during recessions as they represent a turning 
point, where negative expectations give way to a more positive outlook, 
sparking the recovery and eventual growth of the market.
Why Bear Markets Are Feared
Bear markets are dreaded by investors for two main reasons. First, they 
can cause substantial losses, potentially erasing years of accumulated prof￾its quickly. This loss of wealth can significantly impact investors’ financial 
security and retirement plans, emphasizing the importance of understand￾ing bear market characteristics and warning signs for portfolio protection.
Second, bear markets pose psychological challenges for investors 
due to prolonged periods of declining stock prices, economic uncertainty, 
and negative sentiment. This can trigger emotions like anxiety, fear, and 
frustration, making it difficult for investors to stay disciplined. During 
bull markets, overconfidence may lead investors to ignore warning signs, 
leaving them overly exposed to stocks even when a bear market looms. 
Recognizing signs of an impending bear market and taking defensive 
actions, such as reducing stock exposure and increasing allocations to less 
volatile assets, can help investors navigate turbulent times and safeguard 
their portfolios.
How to Recognize Bullish Signs
Recognizing bullish signs in the stock market is crucial for investors seek￾ing favorable investment opportunities. Key indicators and characteristics 
can aid investors in identifying periods of bullish sentiment and potential 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 151 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AM152 • Navigating the Stock Market
market upswings. A lower trending inflation and interest rate environment 
is often viewed as bullish, fostering a favorable investment climate with 
reduced borrowing costs and increased interest in equities. Additionally, 
moderate and sustainable economic growth is a positive indicator, signal￾ing enhanced corporate profits and market stability, instilling confidence 
among investors.
Fiscal responsibility in government management is another positive 
sign contributing to economic stability and investor confidence. Extreme 
investor pessimism serves as a contrarian indicator, suggesting that market 
sentiment has reached maximum negativity, potentially creating buying 
opportunities. High cash holdings in mutual funds indicate the capacity 
for increased stock investments, boosting market demand. A decrease in 
initial public offerings (IPOs) may signify increased confidence in the cur￾rent economic environment, as companies focus on expanding existing 
businesses rather than going public. Finally, market highs without wide￾spread bullishness suggest room for further gains as optimism grows over 
time. Recognizing these bullish signs helps investors make informed deci￾sions and potentially benefit from favorable market conditions.
Bullish Technical Indicators
In addition to fundamental indicators, technical analysis plays a vital role 
in recognizing bullish signs in the stock market. Intensive selling on heavy 
volume can indicate a potential market bottom, as it suggests that extreme 
pessimism and fear have gripped the market, and a reversal may be immi￾nent. Successive lows on decreasing volume can be seen as a sign that the 
downward momentum is weakening, which can pave the way for a market 
recovery. Market rallies accompanied by price increases on increasingly 
heavy volume during successive rally days are a strong indicator of bullish 
sentiment, as they suggest that investors are becoming more confident 
and are actively participating in the upward move.
Other technical indicators can provide further confirmation of bullish 
signs. When there are a small number of stocks on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE) making new lows, it is a positive sign, indicating that 
a limited number of companies are experiencing significant declines, 
while the majority remain stable or are showing strength. The NYSE 
advance/decline indicator trending upward can also be a sign of growing 
market strength, as it reflects the number of advancing stocks outweigh￾ing decliners. Additionally, indications of institutional accumulation, as 
shown by the accumulation/distribution indicator, can reinforce bullish 
signals, as it suggests that large, professional investors are actively buying 
stocks. Overall, these technical indicators offer investors valuable tools for 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 152 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AMMarket Behavior • 153
recognizing bullish market conditions and making informed investment 
decisions.
How to Recognize Bearish Signs
Recognizing bearish signs is vital for investors in preparing for potential 
market downturns. One common bearish indicator involves similarities to 
historically weak periods, particularly after a sharp market run-up, signa￾ling a potential correction or bear market. Rising interest rates are often 
considered bearish, as they can increase borrowing costs and impact cor￾porate profits. An impending recession can also forewarn challenges for 
the market. When reported earnings fall below expectations, and stocks 
no longer respond positively to robust earnings reports, it may indicate 
waning market enthusiasm. High valuations with elevated P/E ratios are 
another bearish sign, suggesting potential overpricing of stocks. Excessive 
bullishness, widespread speculation, and rising margin interest levels can 
all signify an overheated market due for a correction.
Shifts in market sentiment become evident if small-cap stocks falter 
and investors turn their focus to conservative, blue-chip stocks. Changes 
in market leadership, such as breakdowns or distribution among cur￾rent bull market leaders or a shift to defensive or speculative stocks, 
can strongly indicate potential market trouble. Recognizing these bear￾ish signs is essential for investors to take protective measures and make 
well-informed decisions about their investments.
Bearish Technical Signs
To effectively recognize bearish signs in the stock market, technical indi￾cators offer valuable insights. One such bearish indicator is the compari￾son of trading volume between the NASDAQ and the NYSE. When the 
NASDAQ experiences increased trading volume compared to the NYSE, 
it can indicate that the speculative or high-growth stocks on the NASDAQ 
are facing selling pressure, which is a negative signal for the overall mar￾ket. The advance/decline (A/D) line trending lower is another significant 
bearish sign, suggesting that more stocks are declining than advancing, 
reflecting a weakening market breadth.
Moreover, a surge in the number of stocks hitting new lows compared 
to new highs is a clear bearish indicator. When more than forty stocks hit 
new lows, it can signal widespread weakness in the market. A churning 
market, characterized by heavy trading volume but a lack of significant 
upward progress, can also be a bearish sign, as it indicates that despite 
high activity, the market is struggling to make substantial gains. Heavy 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 153 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AM154 • Navigating the Stock Market
trading volume on days when the market declines, contrasted with light 
volume on up days, is another concerning bearish indicator. This suggests 
that investors may be more active when the market is falling, potentially 
reflecting a shift in sentiment. Rallies on light volume that ultimately fail 
to sustain themselves can further confirm bearish sentiment in the mar￾ket. Collectively, these technical indicators offer investors insights into 
potential bearish market conditions and help inform their investment 
decisions.
CORRECTIONS
Individual stocks as well as the overall stock market periodically undergo 
a short-term price decline, known as a correction. This section discusses 
various correction aspects, including how to recognize them as well as 
how to benefit from them.
What Is a Correction?
A correction occurs when the price of an individual stock or the stock mar￾ket experiences an interruption in its upward trajectory, typically taking 
place within the context of a bull market. These interruptions are charac￾terized by declines exceeding 5% in magnitude, and they can extend up 
to 10%. While it is common to observe multiple corrections ranging from 
5% to 10% during the course of a bull market’s lifespan, some corrections 
may even reach as high as 15%. Despite the decline, the distinguishing 
feature of a correction is that it is followed by a reversal in market direc￾tion, with the stock or market resuming its upward trend.
During a correction, investors often witness a short-term pullback, 
which can trigger a sense of uncertainty and volatility in the market. 
Corrections serve as a means of recalibrating stock or market valuations 
and providing opportunities for both investors and traders. While cor￾rections can be seen as temporary setbacks within the broader context 
of a bull market, their significance lies in the fact that they help prevent 
markets from overheating, ensure a healthy balance between supply and 
demand, and set the stage for renewed upward movement following the 
correction’s conclusion.
Corrections: Cause and Effect
Corrections can be initiated by a variety of factors, and each of these 
triggers can have a distinct impact on the market. Rising interest rates, 
for instance, can lead to a correction as they make other fixed-income 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 154 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AMMarket Behavior • 155
investments more attractive compared to equities, prompting investors 
to reallocate their capital. High market valuations can cause a correction 
because overvalued stocks can result in profit-taking, leading to price 
declines. Stock group rotations can occur when investors move their 
investments from one sector to another, which can affect the prices of 
stocks in the respective sectors. Additionally, external factors and news 
events can trigger corrections, as they often bring uncertainty and volatil￾ity into the market, causing investors to reassess their positions.
Despite the initial unease that a correction may bring, it is crucial to 
understand that these market phenomena play a vital role in maintaining 
a balanced and sustainable market environment. They serve as a mecha￾nism to temper excessive speculation and bring stock prices in line with 
their true valuation, making it an essential part of the market’s long-term 
health. Corrections offer opportunities for investors to reassess their port￾folios, enter the market at more favorable prices, and enhance the overall 
stability and resilience of the financial markets.
Rolling Correction Phenomenon
The rolling correction phenomenon can be quite complex to navigate for 
investors, as it often involves a dynamic reshuffling of strengths and weak￾nesses across different sectors and groups. While the overall market may 
appear stable, hidden beneath the surface, some sectors may be facing 
significant headwinds and corrections, while others thrive. This phenom￾enon underscores the importance of conducting a thorough analysis of 
individual groups and sectors, as it may reveal valuable insights into where 
opportunities and risks lie.
Recognizing sector rotation is a crucial aspect of investment strategy, 
as it allows investors to adapt to changing market conditions and allocate 
their capital wisely. When one sector experiences a correction, it can pro￾vide opportunities for investors to rebalance their portfolios by shifting 
their investments to areas that show stronger performance and resilience, 
thereby capitalizing on the market’s ever-evolving dynamics.
Learn How to Recognize Rolling Corrections
Recognizing rolling corrections and sector rotations is paramount for 
investors to make informed decisions in an ever-changing market land￾scape. These phenomena may not always be apparent when observing 
the overall market averages, which could remain relatively stable or even 
show modest gains. Nevertheless, beneath this seemingly calm exterior, 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 155 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AM156 • Navigating the Stock Market
certain market sectors or industry groups may be undergoing significant 
corrections, highlighting the need for a more nuanced analysis.
Sector rotation occurs when corrections are concentrated in specific 
sectors or groups, rather than affecting the entire stock market. This can 
lead to substantial fluctuations within these sectors, sometimes to the 
extent of resembling a bear market. Identifying such rotations can offer 
investors a competitive advantage by allowing them to reposition their 
portfolios strategically. By reallocating investments from underperform￾ing sectors to those exhibiting strength, investors can optimize their risk–
reward profiles and capitalize on the changing dynamics of the market.
Why Sector Rotation Takes Place
Sector rotation is a strategic approach employed by investors to optimize 
their portfolios and navigate the ever-changing market conditions. In 
recent years, this phenomenon has become increasingly prevalent due 
to investors’ reluctance to entirely exit the stock market. Their conviction 
that stocks remain one of the most attractive investment vehicles, com￾bined with the fear of missing out on potential market upswings, has led 
them to implement sector rotation strategies.
The process of sector rotation typically begins with investors identi￾fying sectors that are likely to underperform in the broader market. Once 
these underperforming sectors are identified, investors start divesting 
stocks within those sectors, thereby triggering a correction. The capital 
generated from these divestments is then reallocated to sectors expected 
to outperform the overall market. This approach allows investors to 
remain engaged in the market while actively managing their investments, 
aiming to benefit from the relative strength of different sectors over time. 
Sector rotation strategies can be highly effective, enabling investors to 
adapt to shifting market dynamics and capitalize on opportunities for 
growth and stability.
Take Advantage of Corrections
Stock market corrections, although accompanied by investor fear and 
uncertainty, can provide savvy investors with valuable opportunities. 
Being prepared for these market downturns allows you to take advan￾tage of favorable conditions, particularly when others are selling off their 
stocks. It is during corrections that significant bargains may arise, and the 
change in market leadership offers a chance to identify potential leaders 
for the upcoming market recovery. These emerging leaders often exhibit 
NSM_CH09_2pp.indd 156 1/25/2024 11:36:43 AMMarket Behavior • 157
high EPS and RS rankings, making them well-positioned for substantial 
gains as the market rebounds.
It is essential to approach corrections with caution and avoid favoring 
fallen leaders whose declines have been more pronounced than average. 
Such companies may struggle to regain their former status as leaders. 
Additionally, corrections present an opportunity to review your invest￾ment portfolio and make strategic adjustments. By weeding out under￾performing or weak stocks during these periods, you can enhance the 
overall quality and resilience of your investment holdings, positioning 
your portfolio for stronger long-term performance.
Learn How to Pick Leaders During Corrections
During market corrections, investors can strategically identify potential 
leaders that are likely to outperform when the market recovers. One key 
indicator to consider is RS, which measures a stock price performance 
relative to the broader market. Stocks with high RS rankings, despite 
a correction, indicate their resilience and potential for leadership. It is 
essential to recognize that high RS stocks may experience smaller declines 
than the market average during downturns, positioning them as strong 
contenders for leadership roles in the subsequent market rally.
When seeking out emerging leaders during corrections, pay atten￾tion to stocks achieving new highs despite the challenging market condi￾tions. These stocks display remarkable strength, reflecting their ability to 
weather the storm and stand out among their peers. Additionally, consider 
companies with improving or strengthening fundamentals, as these are 
more likely to continue their upward trajectory when the market recov￾ers. By identifying these characteristics during corrections, investors can 
strategically position themselves to capitalize on the next market upswing.
Avoid Market Timing to Avoid Corrections
Market timing, or attempting to predict corrections and reentries with 
precision, is an arduous task fraught with challenges. Even seasoned 
professionals often struggle to consistently time the market accurately. 
Typically, by the time most investors recognize that a correction is under￾way, it is already too late to implement effective defensive strategies. The 
timing of reentry into the market poses another challenge, as pinpointing 
the ideal moment can be equally challenging. Investors who attempt to 
move in and out of the market may risk missing the short and powerful 
upward moves that characterize the market’s unpredictable nature.

As a result, unless you are an experienced trader well-versed in 
market timing, it is generally advisable to avoid such tactics in order to 
mitigate the impact of a market correction. Instead, it is more effective 
to focus on a long-term investment strategy based on your financial goals, 
risk tolerance, and diversification. This approach can help you weather 
market fluctuations, corrections, and overall volatility without the stress 
of trying to time the market effectively.

BASIS AND LIMITATIONS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Besides fundamental analysis, technical analysis is used by many stock 
market investors. This section discusses various aspects of technical anal￾ysis, including concept and usage.
Learn Basic Technical Analysis Concepts
In addition to practicing fundamental analysis, a significant number of 
investors, estimated to be approximately 10–15%, employ technical anal￾ysis in their decision-making process, particularly with the increasing ease 
of online trading. Given the growing popularity of this approach, it is val￾uable for all investors to have a basic understanding of the fundamental 
tenets of technical analysis. This knowledge will enable investors to inter￾pret and make sense of the sometimes inexplicable behavior of stocks, 
such as the occurrence of abnormally heavy buying or selling, often driven 
by signals derived from technical analysis tools like moving average cross￾overs. This ability to comprehend technical signals and market dynamics 
is akin to defensive driving. Just as a skilled driver remains vigilant of 
other drivers’ actions on the road, investors should be equipped to take 
defensive action, when necessary, particularly in response to sudden mar￾ket moves that may potentially affect their investments.
Moreover, technical analysis can be a valuable tool for spotting 
trends, potential entry or exit points, and identifying support and resist￾ance levels. It involves the examination of historical price and volume 
data to forecast future price movements. By understanding the basics of 
technical analysis, investors can gain insights into the market’s collective 
psychology and behavior, which can help in making informed decisions.

NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 159 2/16/2024 5:07:27 PM160 • Navigating the Stock Market
It is important to note that while technical analysis can provide valuable 
insights, it should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and 
not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
What Technical Analysis Is Based On
Technical analysis is fundamentally based on the examination of stock 
price behavior and trading volume. It aims to forecast future price move￾ments by closely scrutinizing these two main variables. Technical analysts 
utilize tools such as stock price charts and a range of technical indicators 
in their analysis. At the core of technical analysis lies the principle that the 
behavior of a stock or of the broader stock market can be meaningfully 
linked to the price direction or trend that develops over time. The central 
belief is that price movements are not random occurrences; rather, they 
unfold in patterns that can be systematically analyzed to make predictions 
about the future price movements of the stock or market.
This approach hinges on the assumption that historical price and 
volume data contain valuable information, and that patterns, trends, 
and price levels exhibit repetitive tendencies. By recognizing these pat￾terns and trends, analysts aim to gain insights into potential future price 
movements, thus enabling investors to make more informed decisions. 
While technical analysis is a well-established method, it is essential to 
remember that it should be used in conjunction with other forms of anal￾ysis, as its effectiveness can vary across different market conditions and 
circumstances.
What Technical Analysis Indicates
Technical analysis serves as a valuable tool for several key aspects of stock 
market analysis. First, it helps identify resistance and support levels in 
stock prices, as these are critical for determining potential turning points 
in a stock’s performance. By recognizing these levels, investors can make 
informed decisions regarding entry and exit points. Second, technical 
analysis is instrumental in shedding light on the reasons behind price 
swings and the behavior of stocks or the market as a whole. Understanding 
the underlying factors driving market movements is essential for strategic 
investment choices. Additionally, it is a useful method for analyzing both 
short-term and long-term trends, enabling investors to anticipate poten￾tial future price movements.
It is important to note that technical analysis is most effective when 
used in conjunction with fundamental analysis. By confirming fun￾damental insights with technical indicators, investors can make more 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 160 2/16/2024 5:07:27 PMTechnical Analysis • 161
well-rounded and informed decisions. For instance, if technical analysis 
signals a potential market top, investors may consider reducing their over￾all stock holdings. Conversely, when technical indicators suggest a rever￾sal in direction, investors can seize opportunities to position themselves 
advantageously in the market. This illustrates the complementary role of 
technical analysis in investment strategies, acting as a supplementary tool 
alongside fundamental analysis to enhance decision-making.
Use Technical Analysis for Entry Point Determination
Fundamental analysis lays the foundation for stock selection by assessing a 
company’s financial health and performance. Importantly, when it comes 
to deciding the right time to enter a position, technical analysis plays a cru￾cial role. Investors often utilize technical indicators to identify favorable 
entry points and confirm that a stock is currently in an uptrend. One com￾mon practice is examining the stock’s relationship with its 200-day moving 
average. If the stock is trading above this moving average, it generates 
a bullish signal, signifying that it is on a long-term uptrend. Conversely, 
when a stock crosses below its 200-day moving average, it may trigger a 
bearish signal, indicating a potential exit point. This approach provides a 
clear and straightforward way to time your investments based on long￾term trends.
For shorter-term strategies or for traders with a preference for hold￾ing stocks over brief intervals, the 50-day moving average is employed as a 
short-term signal for entering or exiting positions. By monitoring this indi￾cator, traders can make nimble decisions that align with the stock’s more 
immediate price dynamics. These moving averages serve as essential tools 
in technical analysis, guiding investors on when to buy and sell, ensuring 
their actions are in harmony with the stock’s prevailing trend, whether 
short-term or long-term.
Limitations of Technical Analysis
While technical analysis provides valuable insights into a stock’s price 
movements, it falls short in evaluating the underlying fundamentals of a 
company. It cannot offer information about a stock’s business conditions, 
future growth prospects, or financial health. As such, it is not a suitable 
substitute for fundamental analysis, which remains an essential compo￾nent for selecting stocks for long-term investments. Fundamental analy￾sis delves into a company’s financial statements, competitive positioning, 
industry trends, and management quality, offering a comprehensive 
understanding of its intrinsic value and growth potential.
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 161 2/16/2024 5:07:27 PM162 • Navigating the Stock Market
Limitations of technical analysis become apparent when investors 
seek a deeper understanding of a company’s overall health and viability. 
Unlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses solely on historical 
price and volume data. Consequently, technical analysis has inherent limi￾tations in providing a comprehensive perspective on a company’s intrinsic 
value and growth potential. Relying solely on technical analysis may cause 
investors to overlook crucial aspects essential for making well-informed 
and strategic long-term investment decisions.
UNDERSTANDING MOVING AVERAGES
This section discusses moving averages, which play a crucial role in 
technical analysis by smoothing out price data over a specified period, 
helping traders identify trends, potential reversals, and overall market 
momentum.
What Is a Moving Average
A moving average is a fundamental technical analysis tool used to assess 
the overall trend of a stock, index, or market average. It calculates the 
average price of the asset over a specified period, helping to smooth out 
short-term fluctuations and highlight the prevailing direction of the trend. 
Moving averages are versatile and can be applied to various time frames, 
ranging from short-term to long-term perspectives, making them valuable 
for different trading and investment strategies.
By plotting a moving average on a price chart, traders and investors 
can gain valuable insights into the asset’s trend behavior. When the mov￾ing average line is rising, it indicates an uptrend, suggesting that the asset’s 
prices are generally increasing over the chosen time frame. Conversely, a 
declining moving average line signals a downtrend, indicating a general 
decline in prices. Traders often use moving averages to identify potential 
entry and exit points based on crossovers or divergences with price move￾ments, making this a key tool for technical analysis in the stock market.
Most Popular Moving Averages
Among the most popular moving averages used in technical analysis, the 
200-day moving average stands out as one of the most widely monitored. 
This moving average is calculated by summing up the closing prices of a 
stock over the past 200 days and then dividing that sum by two hundred. 
The 200-day moving average is considered a long-term indicator that 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 162 2/16/2024 5:07:27 PMTechnical Analysis • 163
helps investors identify the long-term trend of a stock or market. When 
a stock’s price is above the 200-day moving average, it typically suggests 
a bullish sentiment and an upward trend. In contrast, when the stock’s 
price falls below the 200-day moving average, it may indicate a bearish 
sentiment and a potential downward trend.
In addition to the 200-day moving average, the 30-day and 50-day 
moving averages are also commonly used in technical analysis. These mov￾ing averages offer shorter-term insights into price trends. The 30-day 
moving average and 50-day moving average calculate the average closing 
prices over their respective time frames, helping traders and investors 
identify intermediate-term trends and potential trading opportunities. By 
closely monitoring these moving averages, market participants can make 
informed decisions about when to enter or exit positions in response to 
market trends and price movements.
Significance of Moving Averages
Moving averages are widely used in technical analysis because they offer 
valuable insights into a stock’s or a market’s trend direction and potential 
momentum. The basic premise is that when a stock or index crosses above 
its moving average line, it signifies a shift in trend direction, indicating a 
bullish sentiment. This crossing above the moving average is seen as a buy 
signal, suggesting that the asset is expected to continue moving upward 
for some time. Conversely, when the stock or index falls below its moving 
average line, it is perceived as a sell signal, signaling a shift toward a bear￾ish sentiment and an anticipated decline in price.
The significance of moving averages lies in their ability to help traders 
and investors identify and confirm trends in stock prices. They serve as 
dynamic support and resistance levels that guide market participants in 
making decisions about buying or selling assets. By incorporating mov￾ing averages into their technical analysis, traders can better understand 
the underlying sentiment in the market and make informed decisions on 
when to enter or exit positions, maximizing the potential for profitability.
Moving Averages Can Give Mixed Signals
Moving averages are valuable tools in technical analysis, but their reli￾ability can vary depending on the specific time frame and the moving 
average used. While the 200-day moving average is generally regarded as 
a reliable indicator for long-term trend analysis, the shorter-term moving 
averages, like the 30-day or 50-day, can produce mixed signals due to their 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 163 2/16/2024 5:07:27 PM164 • Navigating the Stock Market
sensitivity to shorter period price fluctuations. It is essential for investors 
and traders to understand the limitations of these shorter-term moving 
averages.
The 30-day and 50-day moving averages, being shorter in duration, 
are more responsive to short-term price movements and can lead to fre￾quent crossings over a short period. This frequent crossing can generate 
false signals, making it challenging to determine a clear and consistent 
trend direction. Therefore, when using shorter-term moving averages, 
investors should exercise caution and consider additional technical or 
fundamental analysis to filter out noise and ensure a more accurate inter￾pretation of market trends.
Moving Averages Can Be Related to Investor Sentiment
Moving averages provide insights into investor sentiment and can offer a 
valuable perspective on market dynamics. When a stock is trading above 
its moving average, it signals that the recent buyers, within the chosen 
time frame of the moving average, are experiencing gains, creating a pos￾itive sentiment among those holding the stock. This uptrend suggests that 
investors are optimistic and confident about the stock’s performance.
Conversely, if a stock is trading below its moving average, it signifies 
that recent buyers are holding positions with losses that can lead to a bear￾ish sentiment. This trend implies that investors may be less optimistic and 
more cautious about the stock’s prospects. By examining moving averages, 
investors can gauge the collective sentiment of market participants and 
make more informed decisions based on these insights.
Influence on Momentum Investors
Moving averages can have a significant influence on the behavior of 
momentum investors and traders. These market participants are highly 
attuned to technical indicators, especially moving averages, to guide their 
trading decisions. When a stock is trading above its moving average line, 
indicating an uptrend, it is seen as an attractive buying opportunity by 
momentum investors, who aim to ride the momentum and capitalize on 
upward price movements. Conversely, when a stock falls below its moving 
average, signaling a downtrend, these investors may interpret it as a signal 
to sell, aiming to profit from the expected downward price movement.
The widespread adoption of this strategy by momentum investors 
means that it can become self-fulfilling in the market. As more trad￾ers react to signals generated by moving averages, they contribute to 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 164 2/16/2024 5:07:27 PMTechnical Analysis • 165
reinforcing the trend, causing a bandwagon effect. This phenomenon 
underscores the significance of moving averages as a tool for understand￾ing market sentiment and behavior, as well as the potential impact of 
trading strategies on stock price movements.
Which Moving Average to Use
The choice of which moving average to use largely hinges on the inves￾tor’s specific time horizon and trading style. Long-term investors typically 
rely on the 200-day moving average, as it provides a broader perspective 
on a stock’s price trend. Some long-term investors may also consider the 
50-day moving average for additional insights into intermediate trends. In 
contrast, intermediate, short-term, and day traders often turn to shorter 
moving averages, such as the 50-day or even the 5-day moving average. 
The 50-day moving average is particularly popular due to its common 
usage in the trading community, and price movements crossing this aver￾age can trigger significant trading activity and sentiment shifts among 
traders.
The stock’s inherent volatility also plays a role in the selection of a 
moving average. More volatile stocks with sharp price swings may ben￾efit from the use of longer time frame moving averages to provide a 
smoother trend line. In contrast, less volatile stocks may be analyzed using 
shorter-term moving averages to capture more immediate price changes. 
The choice of moving average is therefore a nuanced decision that takes 
into account the investor’s investment horizon, trading objectives, and the 
specific characteristics of the stock in question.
Understand the Concept of Trend Lines
Trend lines are fundamental tools used in technical analysis to gauge a 
stock’s price movement and predict its future direction. When it comes 
to drawing trend lines, two primary types are essential: rising trend lines, 
which connect low or bottom points in a price chart to represent an 
ascending trend, and falling trend lines, which connect high or top points 
for a descending trend. By analyzing how a stock behaves relative to these 
trend lines, technical analysts aim to make predictions about the stock’s 
future price movement. The underlying concept is rooted in the idea that 
established trends, whether rising or falling, tend to persist over a certain 
period before a potential weakening or reversal occurs.
Trend lines help analysts determine whether a trend is losing strength 
or potentially undergoing a change. For instance, a rising trend line that 
was providing support to a stock’s price may weaken or break, signaling 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 165 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM166 • Navigating the Stock Market
a potential trend reversal. Conversely, a falling trend line that had been 
acting as resistance may be breached, suggesting a change in the stock’s 
direction. By examining the interaction between a stock’s price and these 
trend lines, analysts can make informed decisions about trading or invest￾ing based on the likelihood of a trend continuation or reversal.
Analyze Charts With Moving Averages and Trend Lines
The combined analysis of moving averages and trend lines is a powerful 
approach used by technical analysts to confirm and interpret stock price 
charts effectively. While these tools can be employed individually, they 
often yield stronger insights when used in conjunction, providing dual 
confirmation of the stock’s trend. When a rising moving average line aligns 
with an uptrend line, it offers robust confirmation of an uptrend in the 
stock. Conversely, if both the moving average line and the uptrend line 
are violated on the downside, it serves as a strong signal that the uptrend 
has likely come to an end.
This combined analysis is valuable for traders and investors in iden￾tifying key entry and exit points in the market. It helps them distinguish 
between the continuation of an existing trend and the potential reversal 
of that trend, guiding their decision-making and risk management strat￾egies. By examining moving averages and trend lines in tandem, market 
participants can gain a clearer perspective on a stock’s price movements, 
thereby enhancing their ability to make well-informed trading and invest￾ment choices.
Limitation of Moving Averages
Moving averages are primarily lagging indicators, especially the 200-day 
moving average, which is considered a long-term trend indicator. One 
of the main limitations of moving averages is their delayed signals. By 
the time a stock crosses its 200-day moving average, the trend reversal 
or continuation is often quite apparent in the price action. This means 
that if moving averages are used as the primary tool for generating buy 
and sell signals, their signals may come after a substantial price move has 
already occurred. Consequently, relying solely on moving averages for 
timing decisions can be less effective and, in some cases, result in missed 
opportunities or unfavorable outcomes.
To mitigate the moving average limitation, investors and trad￾ers should integrate them into a comprehensive analysis that considers 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 166 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 167
various technical and fundamental factors. This approach provides a more 
accurate and timely assessment of market conditions, helping navigate 
potential pitfalls associated with the delayed signals of moving averages 
and ensuring well-informed decision-making.
How to Monitor Moving Averages
Monitoring moving averages is crucial for investors and traders to gauge 
the direction and trends of stocks and market indexes. There are numer￾ous sources available for tracking moving averages, both for individual 
stocks and broader market indexes. Many websites offer stock price 
charts with moving averages, which can be accessed in both delayed 
and real-time modes. Some of the popular websites for monitoring mov￾ing averages include stockmaster.com, stockcharts.com, bigcharts.com, 
tradingview.com, and Yahoo Finance. Some of these sites provide free 
access to basic charting tools, while others may offer premium or sub￾scription-based services with advanced features.
Brokerage account holders typically have access to comprehensive 
charting tools, including moving averages, on their trading platforms, 
enabling them to monitor stock trends. For those who prefer traditional 
media, several newspapers, such as The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s 
Business Daily, also publish stock and market charts, making moving aver￾age data readily available to a wide range of investors and traders.
200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE CHARACTERISTICS
Various aspects of the 200-day moving average, which is a long-term 
trend indicator widely used by stock market investors, are discussed in 
this section.
200-Day Moving Average as a Trend Indicator
The 200-day moving average serves as a critical long-term trend indicator 
for stocks and the overall market. Its primary function is to determine 
the prevailing trend direction. When a stock is trading above its 200-day 
moving average line, it is widely recognized as being in an uptrend, which 
is viewed as a bullish signal. Conversely, if a stock is trading below its 
200-day moving average, it is considered to be in a downtrend, signaling a 
bearish sentiment. Investors, especially professional ones, tend to prefer 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 167 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM168 • Navigating the Stock Market
buying stocks that are trading above a rising 200-day moving average line 
as it indicates a strong uptrend.
Due to the lagging nature of the 200-day moving average, many pro￾fessional investors opt to take preemptive action by selling a stock before 
it even crosses below this moving average, particularly if they anticipate 
a forthcoming decline. The same principles of trend identification apply 
to the 200-day moving average when analyzing the broader stock market. 
By closely monitoring the 200-day moving average, investors and traders 
can gain valuable insights into the long-term trends of individual stocks 
and market indexes, which can be crucial for informed decision-making.
200-Day Moving Average as a Market Direction Change Indicator
Market analysts closely monitor the 200-day moving average not only 
for individual stocks but also for various market indexes and averages to 
gauge their overall trend direction and to detect signals of potential mar￾ket shifts. Among these indicators, the DJIA is regarded as a particularly 
valuable one for assessing the broader market’s future behavior. When 
the DJIA rises above its 200-day moving average, it sends a bullish signal 
for the entire market, signifying a change in trend that is expected to 
result in upward momentum. Conversely, when the DJIA crosses below 
its 200-day moving average in a downward trajectory, it generates a bear￾ish signal, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment toward a more 
pessimistic outlook.
The 200-day moving average, especially when applied to well￾established market indexes like the DJIA, can be an invaluable tool for 
market analysts and investors in predicting and reacting to overall market 
trends. By keeping a watchful eye on these trends, they can make more 
informed decisions regarding their investment strategies and the timing 
of buying or selling stocks and other financial assets.
200-Day Moving Average Can Give a False Signal
The 200-day moving average is a valuable tool for investors, but it is 
not infallible, and false signals can occur. When a stock or market index 
crosses below its 200-day moving average, it does not necessarily guaran￾tee a long-term trend change. Sometimes, the decline below this moving 
average is short-lived, and the stock might experience a swift rebound or 
trade in a choppy manner around the moving average line. In such cases, 
investors should exercise caution because the initial decline may not sig￾nify a substantial shift in trend direction.
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 168 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 169
In these situations, the validity of the signal depends on whether the 
stock can sustain its rebound or if it falls back below the moving average. 
A failed rebound could be an indicator of a more prolonged bearish trend, 
suggesting that the stock might encounter difficulties. To avoid falling vic￾tim to false signals, investors should use the 200-day moving average in 
conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools to make 
well-informed investment decisions.
Tips for Individual Stocks
When analyzing individual stocks, the 200-day moving average plays a 
significant role in signaling potential buy or sell opportunities. Decisively 
crossing above the 200-day moving average is often interpreted as a buy 
signal, indicating that the stock might be in an uptrend. It is essential to 
be cautious about overextended situations. If a stock is trading 50% or 
more above its moving average line, it could be considered overextended, 
which makes it vulnerable to a correction. When a stock extends even 
further, reaching 70%–100% above the moving average, profit-taking is 
often advisable to lock in gains.
Conversely, if a stock falls below its moving average line on heavy vol￾ume or experiences a gap-down, which is a sudden sharp price drop, it is a 
negative development that usually results in a sell signal. These conditions 
are often accompanied by strong indications of bearish sentiment. On the 
flip side, if a stock experiences a breakout to the upside with significant 
volume support, it generates a buy signal.
It is crucial to consider the stock’s fundamentals in conjunction with 
these technical signals. A stock that rises above its 50-day moving average 
while also trading above its 200-day moving average is typically seen as a 
bullish sign, while a move in the opposite direction is considered bearish. 
This integration of technical and fundamental analysis provides a more 
comprehensive view for investors when making decisions about individual 
stocks.
Tips for the Market
When assessing the overall market, the behavior of major market averages 
and indexes, such as the DJIA or NASDAQ, in relation to their 200-day 
moving average lines plays a crucial role in determining the market’s trend 
and sentiment. If a major index crosses above its 200-day moving average 
line after a prolonged period of trading below it, this shift is typically seen 
as a bullish signal, indicating a positive trend change. As long as the index 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 169 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM170 • Navigating the Stock Market
maintains its position above the 200-day moving average, it suggests the 
continuation of an uptrend. Conversely, if a major index crosses below its 
200-day moving average line after an extended period of trading above it, 
it signals a trend change and is viewed bearishly.
The slope of the moving average is also important in interpret￾ing market direction. When the moving average line is rising sharply, 
even if it is situated below the index, it is considered a bullish sign. 
Conversely, if the moving average is rapidly declining and positioned 
above the index, it  sends a bearish signal. Additionally, it is essential 
to keep an eye on divergences between key market indexes and their 
respective moving averages. For instance, when major indexes are 
above their 200-day moving averages, and one suddenly drops below 
this level, it can serve as a leading indicator for other indexes to poten￾tially follow suit. Determining which index is leading in an upward or 
downward direction is key to understanding market dynamics and trend 
changes.
Relating the 200-Day Moving Average to the Market Health
The market’s health and its prevailing trend can be effectively assessed by 
examining the percentage of stocks that are trading above their 200-day 
moving average line. When the majority of stocks are trading above this 
threshold, it is indicative of an uptrend in the market, signifying a bull￾ish sentiment. Conversely, if most stocks are trading below their 200-day 
moving average, it suggests that the market is in a downtrend, reflecting 
a bearish tone.
The percentage of stocks that are trading above their 200-day moving 
average is a valuable gauge of the overall market health. A higher percent￾age of stocks above this threshold is associated with a healthier market 
condition, indicating robust underlying strength and more widespread 
investor confidence. In contrast, a lower percentage can signal market 
weakness and increased caution among investors, highlighting the poten￾tial for a bearish trend.
Relating Stocks Trading Over Their 200-Day Moving Average to 
Market Health
The percentage of stocks trading over their 200-day moving average 
serves as a valuable market health indicator with important implications 
for investors. In the context of a bull market, this percentage tends to be 
notably high or trending higher, reflecting a robust and optimistic market 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 170 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 171
environment. It is important to note that when bear markets or correc￾tions are underway, this percentage typically experiences a significant 
decline.
A noteworthy occurrence is when the percentage surpasses the 90% 
mark and maintains that level. This situation indicates the presence of 
a powerful and resilient market, capable of making substantial upward 
moves. Historically, the percentage of NYSE-listed stocks trading above 
their 200-day moving average has fluctuated within a broad range. At mar￾ket tops, this percentage has been known to reach as high as 80%–90%, 
signaling elevated market exuberance. Conversely, during market bottoms, 
the percentage has dwindled to as low as 10%–20%, illustrating a market 
plagued by pessimism and extreme caution. Daily reporting of this number 
by the IBD and various online sources offers investors valuable insights 
into market conditions.
SUPPORT, RESISTANCE, AND BASING
In this section, investors will be introduced to the concepts of support, 
resistance, and basing, which form the foundation of technical analysis, 
enabling them to understand how identifying key levels can guide strate￾gic decision-making.
Be Familiar With the Stock Price Cycle and Its Current Phase
Understanding the stock price cycle is essential for effective stock mar￾ket investing. A typical stock price cycle encompasses four primary 
phases: basing, rising, topping, and declining. The most favorable phase 
for investors is the rising phase, characterized by an uptrend in stock 
prices, making it an opportune time for buying. Conversely, the declin￾ing phase signifies a downtrend in stock prices, making it advisable to 
consider selling rather than buying. Recognizing and identifying these 
phases in a timely manner can enhance profit potential or help mitigate 
significant losses.
The application of technical analysis principles and techniques is 
instrumental in discerning these phases within the stock price cycle. 
By analyzing key technical indicators and patterns, investors can make 
informed decisions, navigating the stock market with greater confidence 
and increasing their chances of financial success.
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 171 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM172 • Navigating the Stock Market
What Is a Support Line?
In technical analysis, the concept of a support line is fundamental for 
understanding price dynamics and making informed investment deci￾sions. A support line represents the price level at which a stock stabilizes 
following a significant price drop or decline. At this juncture, the stock’s 
descent comes to a halt as the selling pressure subsides, and the num￾ber of buyers equals or exceeds that of sellers. The emergence of this 
support level can be identified by distinct markers, such as a sharp sell-off 
characterized by heavy trading volume or a series of price lows occurring 
on progressively diminishing volume. These support levels are critical for 
market participants as they represent crucial reference points for assess￾ing potential future price movements.
To visualize a support line, technical analysts connect the low points or 
bottoms on a stock price chart, effectively creating a line that underscores 
the price levels at which the stock’s descent found support. It is important 
to recognize that a single stock may have multiple support levels, each 
denoting a distinct price range at which the stock encountered support 
during its price decline. In the context of technical analysis, breaching 
a support level to the downside is viewed as a bearish signal, indicating 
potential downward pressure on the stock’s price. Moreover, if this breach 
occurs decisively, investors may anticipate that the next support level will 
serve as the next potential support threshold, with implications for future 
trading decisions.
Moving Average as a Support Line
Moving averages play a pivotal role in technical analysis, particularly as 
support lines for stocks. They represent a stock’s average price over a spe￾cific time frame, such as 30 days, 50 days, or 200 days. Among these, the 
50-day and 200-day moving average lines are widely recognized as robust 
support levels for stocks due to their ability to reflect the underlying trend. 
When a stock’s price approaches or descends near these moving average 
lines, the dynamics of supply and demand come into play. Selling pressure 
tends to wane, and buying interest increases, contributing to a potential 
rebound in the stock’s price. This phenomenon is driven, in part, by the 
fact that major institutional investors frequently use these moving averages 
as predetermined levels at which they initiate positions. Consequently, a 
breach of a moving average line to the downside is often interpreted as a 
bearish signal, suggesting potential weakness in the stock’s price trajectory.
In practice, these moving average lines act as dynamic support levels, 
helping traders and investors gauge the strength of a stock’s trend and 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 172 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 173
make informed decisions. The proximity of a stock’s price to its moving 
average lines can serve as an important reference point for assessing 
whether the stock is trading in alignment with its longer-term or shorter￾term trends, thereby guiding buying and selling strategies. By offering 
consistent support levels based on historical price data, moving averages 
provide valuable insights into a stock’s price dynamics, making them a key 
tool in the technical analyst’s toolkit.
How Solid Is a Support Line?
The solidity of a support line depends on the historical price action and 
how often it has been tested and validated by the stock. The more fre￾quently a stock approaches a support line and successfully rebounds from 
it, the more solid and dependable that support line is considered to be. 
This recurring validation instills confidence in traders and investors, mak￾ing the support line an attractive entry point. Essentially, the support line 
is seen as a price floor that the stock is reluctant to breach, and from which 
a rebound can be anticipated. This reassures traders who use it as a refer￾ence point for their buying decisions, believing that the support line will 
act as a buffer against further declines.
It is important to remember that if a support line is decisively 
breached, it can transform into a resistance level. This reversal of roles 
signifies a significant change in the stock’s price dynamics and is closely 
monitored by traders and investors. Not only traders but also long-term 
investors are keen on watching support lines, as they offer valuable 
insights into the stock’s price behavior and its potential resilience dur￾ing market fluctuations. In summary, a well-established and frequently 
tested support line is an important aspect of technical analysis, provid￾ing traders and investors with key reference points for their trading and 
investment decisions.
What Is a Resistance Line?
A resistance line is an important concept in technical analysis, represent￾ing a price level at which a stock or security tends to encounter selling 
pressure and struggles to move beyond. This occurs after a period of price 
appreciation, when the stock reaches a peak or resistance level. At this 
point, the number of buyers diminishes, and sellers become more promi￾nent, leading to a halt in the stock’s ascent. A resistance line is depicted 
on a price chart by connecting the high points or peaks, beyond which the 
stock has previously struggled to progress.
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 173 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM174 • Navigating the Stock Market
In contrast to a support level, which acts as a floor for the stock’s 
price and provides a rebounding point, a resistance line serves as a price 
ceiling that a stock has difficulty breaking through during an upward 
move. Traders and investors closely monitor resistance levels, as they 
offer insights into potential obstacles a stock might encounter in its jour￾ney higher. A stock can have multiple resistance levels, and traders often 
use these lines as reference points for their trading decisions. If a resist￾ance line is decisively breached, indicating that the stock has successfully 
moved above it, this is interpreted as a bullish sign. Such a breakthrough 
suggests that the stock has the potential for further upward movement.
How Solid Is a Resistance Line?
The strength and significance of a resistance line are closely related to the 
frequency with which a stock approaches it and retreats from it. The more 
often a stock’s price approaches a resistance line and fails to break through 
it, the more psychologically important that line becomes to traders. As a 
result, traders are cautious about buying near resistance levels since they 
are aware of the historical tendency for stocks to struggle at these points. 
Instead, traders often look for opportunities to sell near resistance levels, 
expecting the stock’s price to retreat after another unsuccessful attempt to 
break through the resistance line.
A powerful breakout through a resistance level on heavy trading vol￾ume can be a highly attractive entry point for traders who believe that the 
stock has the potential for significant upward movement. Once a resist￾ance level is successfully breached, it often transforms into a support 
level, offering a floor beneath which the stock’s price is less likely to fall 
easily and from which rebounds are expected. This change in role from 
resistance to support is significant because it reflects a shift in market 
sentiment and expectations for the stock.
Effect of Overhead Supply on Rebounding Stocks
When a stock makes a recovery after a period of decline or corrects from 
a sharp pullback, it has to contend with the concept of overhead supply. 
For instance, if a stock has recently experienced a decline from $75 to 
$50 through a series of steps (e.g., $70, $62, $55, and $50) and subse￾quently reverses direction to move up to $55 after consolidating around 
the $50 level, many investors who initially purchased the stock at $55 will 
often look to sell once the price returns to their breakeven point. A simi￾lar pattern of selling pressure emerges as the stock progresses back up to 
the previous trading levels, such as $62, $70, and $75, as more investors 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 174 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 175
look to offload their shares. This phenomenon, where stocks that were 
previously purchased at specific levels are offered for sale once the price 
returns to those levels, is termed overhead supply. When a stock has 
remained at a certain price level for an extended period before declin￾ing, it will encounter a substantial volume of overhead supply when it 
embarks on a recovery. Consequently, it may face formidable resistance 
when attempting to break through this supply level.
Overhead supply can create hurdles for a rebounding stock, making 
it more challenging to surpass these levels and continue its upward tra￾jectory. The presence of many willing sellers who previously bought the 
stock at these levels can lead to increased selling pressure as the price 
approaches these points, potentially slowing down the stock’s ascent. 
Investors and traders often closely monitor overhead supply levels to 
gauge the likelihood of a stock successfully breaking through these price 
points or facing resistance. Understanding the dynamics of overhead sup￾ply is crucial when analyzing stocks that have experienced recent declines 
and are attempting to recover, as it can provide valuable insights into 
potential price movements and decision-making.
What Is Basing?
In technical analysis, basing refers to a specific phase in a stock’s price 
cycle characterized by trading activity occurring within a confined price 
range and on relatively low volume. During this phase, the stock’s resist￾ance and support levels are in close proximity to each other, often lead￾ing to a prolonged period of equilibrium between buyers and sellers. 
Basing phases can extend for several weeks, months, or, in some cases, 
even longer, depending on market conditions and stock-specific factors. 
This phase can manifest in various scenarios, including during an ongo￾ing uptrend when the stock needs to consolidate and absorb prior gains. 
Alternatively, it can emerge following a gradual price decline or a sudden, 
substantial drop in the stock’s value, marking a period of stabilization and 
indecision in the market.
Basing is a critical technical analysis concept as it indicates a tempo￾rary pause or consolidation in the stock’s price movement. This phase can 
offer valuable insights for traders and investors, allowing them to antic￾ipate potential future price trends based on the stock’s behavior during 
this period. Understanding basing patterns is essential for those seeking 
to make informed decisions about entering, exiting, or holding positions 
in stocks, as it can help in assessing the stock’s readiness to resume its 
upward or downward trajectory.
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 175 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM176 • Navigating the Stock Market
What Is a Breakout
In technical analysis, a “breakout” is a pivotal event that transpires after a stock 
has spent a significant period basing or trading within a confined price range. 
This phase of consolidation can persist for months, signifying a temporary 
equilibrium where buyers and sellers are more or less evenly matched. 
During a breakout, the stock moves out from this trading range by making 
a decisive move, either upward or downward. An upside breakout material￾izes when fresh buyers enter the market and the number of available sellers 
diminishes, causing buying pressure to dominate. Conversely, a downside 
breakout unfolds when new sellers emerge, leading to a predominant selling 
trend. Identifying and monitoring breakouts are of particular interest to tech￾nical analysts because these events often foreshadow the potential for rapid 
and substantial price movements in a relatively short time frame.
Breakouts hold a significant place in the toolkit of traders and inves￾tors, as they can present lucrative opportunities for capitalizing on price 
changes. Traders often leverage breakouts to initiate positions or make 
quick trading decisions, aiming to ride the momentum generated by the 
breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend. By identifying breakouts 
early and correctly, market participants can position themselves to seize 
the potential gains or manage risk, which can be particularly advantageous 
when market conditions align with their strategies and objectives.
Understanding the Breakout Strategy
The breakout strategy is a fundamental approach employed by momentum 
traders to pinpoint stocks displaying promising price momentum charac￾teristics. Nonetheless, not all breakouts guarantee success, as a stock that 
breaks out may subsequently retreat or fail to register a significant upward 
move. To enhance the probability of a successful breakout, it is crucial to 
scrutinize certain key factors. First and foremost, assess the stock’s funda￾mentals, such as its earnings. Stocks with strong earnings performance tend 
to be more resilient and are better poised for sustained upward momen￾tum. Additionally, pay heed to relative strength, aiming for stocks with rel￾ative strength scores that exceed 70 and preferably exceed 90, indicating 
strong price performance compared to the broader market.
Furthermore, consider the stock’s overall trend, as a major uptrend 
can amplify the impact of a breakout. An extended basing period is also 
a valuable criterion, with a preferred duration of three to five months, as 
it reflects the stock’s resilience and its ability to absorb selling pressure 
during the consolidation phase. Stocks that are based above the 50-day 
moving average line are often considered stronger, suggesting solid 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 176 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 177
investor interest. Longer basing periods, combined with a significant rise 
or a surge in trading volume during the breakout, contribute to a more 
powerful expected breakout. Finally, a breakout that propels the stock 
into new high territory, free from overhead supply, is particularly favora￾ble, as it minimizes the risk associated with encountering resistance and 
potentially strengthens the stock’s long-term prospects.
TRADING VOLUME AND PRICE PERFORMANCE
This section explores the intricate relationship between market activity 
and stock price movements, uncovering the significance of trading vol￾ume as a key indicator to analyze and interpret price trends.
Volume Can Be Related to Trend Changes or Turning Points
Trading volume is a critical indicator in the realm of stock analysis, closely 
examined by traders and investors in tandem with the price movements 
of individual stocks and the overall market. Elevated trading volume often 
signals the occurrence of something extraordinary or the anticipation of 
significant forthcoming developments. It serves as a notable barometer 
for potential news and events, catching the attention of investors who 
closely follow volume levels. Investors and traders are astute in moni￾toring trading volume, recognizing its association with substantial price 
fluctuations, whether upward or downward. One well-established prin￾ciple is the direct correlation between rising volume and price, indicat￾ing the likelihood of further price appreciation. In essence, simultaneous 
increases in both volume and price momentum are typically interpreted 
as precursors to the commencement of a new trend.
By observing the interplay between volume and price movements, 
market participants endeavor to decipher pivotal turning points and shifts 
in market dynamics. Heightened trading volume can signify the onset of 
a significant trend and serve as a harbinger of notable price movements. 
Conversely, dwindling or irregular volume may herald a potential market 
shift or signal that the prevailing trend is losing momentum. In essence, trad￾ing volume provides valuable insights into market sentiment, helping traders 
and investors navigate their decisions and identify potential trend changes.
Analyze Trading Volume
Interpreting trading volume is an essential aspect of stock analysis, provid￾ing valuable insights into market sentiment. When daily trading volume 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 177 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PM178 • Navigating the Stock Market
surpasses the average daily trading volume, it indicates heightened investor 
interest and activity, which can be driven by various factors. A notable 
scenario unfolds when a stock experiences a breakout from its established 
trading range, whether to the upside or downside, and is accompanied by 
increased trading volume. An upside breakout with heavy volume is often 
viewed as a robust buy signal, suggesting significant buying activity, par￾ticularly from institutional investors. This surge in trading volume reflects 
the strong interest in the stock, which can propel it to new heights. In 
contrast, when a stock registers an increase in price while trading volume 
remains stagnant or declines, it is considered a bullish indicator, indicat￾ing a lack of selling pressure.
On the flip side, when a stock experiences a downside breakout, it is 
typically regarded as a sell signal, regardless of whether trading volume 
rises or not. A price decline associated with heavy volume is a particu￾larly bearish signal, signifying robust selling activity and potential mar￾ket weakness. This is particularly concerning when it occurs in a strong 
and rising market. In contrast, a price decline on low volume following 
a period of significant selling may suggest that the selling pressure has 
waned or is nearing its conclusion. Generally, trading volume tends to be 
above average during uptrends and below average during downtrends, 
offering valuable cues to market dynamics and potential trend rever￾sals. Additionally, reaching new highs on low volume can raise concerns 
and serve as a warning sign, indicating a potential lack of commitment 
among buyers.
Focus on Percentage Change in Volume
When analyzing trading volume, it is crucial to focus on the percentage 
change in volume rather than simply comparing the absolute volume 
numbers. Stocks can have vastly different average daily trading volumes, 
and evaluating their volume changes using a percentage-based approach 
ensures that the analysis is meaningful and applicable across a broad spec￾trum of stocks. By focusing on the percentage change, you can pinpoint 
stocks with the most substantial volume changes, even if they do not have 
the highest daily trading volume. This approach allows investors to iden￾tify stocks experiencing significant shifts in market interest, which can be 
indicative of noteworthy news or developments affecting those particular 
stocks.
To illustrate, consider two stocks where both experience a one million 
share increase on a particular day. The first stock has an average daily 
trading volume of two hundred thousand shares, while the second stock 
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 178 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMTechnical Analysis • 179
has a daily trading volume of five million shares. By concentrating on the 
percentage change, it becomes evident that the first stock has a 500% rise 
in volume, while the second stock has a 20% increase, which is not as sig￾nificant. Such percentage-based analysis is invaluable for investors seek￾ing early insights into potential news or developments that could impact 
their stock investments.
NSM_CH10_4pp.indd 179 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMNSM_CH10_4pp.indd 180 2/16/2024 5:07:28 PMCHAPTER
GENERAL
Economic indicators reflect the health of the economy and, therefore, 
have a significant impact on the stock market. This section discusses the 
importance of monitoring the economy, as well as the indicators that can 
be used for that purpose.
Why the Economy Should Be Monitored
Monitoring the economy is crucial for investors because it provides valu￾able insights into the factors that influence a company’s profitability and, 
consequently, the stock price performance. The state of the economy and 
the stage of the business cycle have a significant bearing on a compa￾ny’s earnings, as consumer spending, business investment, and overall 
economic health directly affect corporate revenues and profitability. 
Therefore, investors need to keep a watchful eye on economic indicators 
and variables that are closely linked to the financial health of companies 
and the broader stock market. These economic variables are typically 
released through periodic reports by government agencies and various 
organizations, and the data is promptly disseminated by newspapers and 
websites, allowing investors to stay informed and make informed deci￾sions about their investments.
Investors must pay attention to a wide range of economic indicators 
and reports that include, but are not limited to, GDP growth, employ￾ment statistics, consumer sentiment, inflation rates, and interest rates. By 
closely following these economic metrics, investors can gauge the overall 
economic health and direction, which is a vital factor in determining the 
potential future performance of individual stocks and the broader stock 
Monitoring the Economy

NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 181 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PM182 • Navigating the Stock Market
market. Economic data can signal changes in the business cycle, helping 
investors make informed decisions about their portfolios and respond 
to shifting economic conditions, ultimately maximizing their investment 
outcomes.
Key Indicators Used to Monitor the Economy’s Performance
Investors rely on a variety of indicators to assess the health of the econ￾omy and its potential for future growth, both of which play a crucial 
role in determining the level of earnings and the price performance 
of the stock market as well as individual companies. These indicators 
include inflation, employment, GDP, Institute for Supply Management 
(ISM) Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), factory orders, housing and 
construction spending, consumer confidence index, retail sales, per￾sonal income and consumption expenditures, industrial production and 
capacity utilization, housing starts, stock market indexes, and money 
supply.
By closely monitoring these economic indicators, investors can make 
informed decisions about their investments and better position them￾selves to navigate the complexities of the financial markets.
Interest Rates and Fiscal Policy
In addition to economic indicators, investors keep a close watch on the 
policies and actions of the Federal Reserve when it comes to interest 
rates. Short-term and long-term interest rate trends are of particular 
interest, with the thirty-year bond rate and the prime-lending rate being 
commonly monitored indicators. These interest rates have a significant 
impact on various aspects of the financial markets, including the cost of 
borrowing for businesses and consumers, which in turn affects spending, 
investments, and economic growth.
Furthermore, fiscal policy, as represented by government spending 
and the budget deficit, is a crucial area of concern for investors. These 
factors can influence interest rates, as the level of government borrow￾ing required to fund deficits can place upward pressure on interest rates. 
Therefore, investors closely follow government fiscal decisions, as they 
play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape and can have direct 
implications for both the bond and equity markets. By staying informed 
about interest rates and fiscal policy, investors aim to make more informed 
decisions in their investment strategies and understand the potential risks 
and opportunities in the financial markets.

PRIMARY INDICATORS
This section discusses the most important economic indicators, such as 
inflation and unemployment, used by investors for analyzing the state of 
the economy.
Inflation
Inflation holds a significant place in the minds of Wall Street investors, 
primarily due to its potential to erode the purchasing power of money. 
The relationship between inflation and stocks is particularly crucial, as 
stock prices tend to respond to inflationary pressures within the econ￾omy. Investors closely follow inflation-related news, especially indicators 
pointing to an uptick in inflation. When inflation is on the rise, it suggests 
that interest rates may increase to combat it, and this anticipation neg￾atively impacts stocks. Conversely, when inflation appears to be under 
control, it tends to have a positive effect on stocks. The dynamics of infla￾tion and interest rates play a role in asset allocation decisions as investors 
seek to optimize their portfolios. In times of rising inflation and interest 
rates, they may choose to shift their investments from stocks to bonds, and 
vice versa when interest rates are declining.
Two of the most prominent inflation indicators that investors pay 
close attention to are the producer price index (PPI) and the consumer 
price index (CPI). These metrics provide insights into the changing prices 
of goods and services, which are fundamental to gauging inflation trends. 
Additionally, the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index serves as 
a valuable tool for investors to assess potential inflationary pressures by 
tracking the trends in commodity prices. A rising CRB index can indi￾cate increasing costs of raw materials, which often translate into higher 
prices for finished goods and services, contributing to inflation concerns. 
Therefore, monitoring these inflation indicators becomes an essential part 
of investors’ strategies to navigate the effects of inflation on stock prices 
and asset allocation decisions.
Producer Price Index
The producer price index (PPI) plays a pivotal role in assessing inflation 
trends at the producer or wholesale level of the economy. It tracks and 
measures the price changes of various categories of goods, including 
crude, intermediate, and finished products, providing insights into infla￾tionary pressures at different stages of the production process. The PPI 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 183 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PM184 • Navigating the Stock Market
comprises two key components: the overall rate and the core rate. The 
core rate, which holds greater significance, is calculated by excluding the 
more volatile elements of the overall rate, such as food and energy prices. 
Investors typically place greater emphasis on the core rate to get a clearer 
picture of underlying inflationary trends.
The PPI’s movements and trends are of considerable importance to 
the financial markets, especially the stock market. Investors closely mon￾itor the PPI, and any report indicating a rise in this index is often viewed 
as negative for the stock market. This sentiment stems from the fact 
that both the PPI and the CPI hold considerable influence over Federal 
Reserve policies, interest rates, and other financial metrics, such as con￾sumer and auto loan rates. When the PPI remains low or trends down￾ward, it is generally seen as a positive development in the market. This is 
because lower producer prices are indicative of a benign inflationary envi￾ronment, which is often conducive to investment and economic growth. 
Consequently, investors are advised to scrutinize any changes in the PPI 
rate, as they can provide crucial insights into the potential impacts on 
inflation and the financial markets.
Consumer Price Index 
The consumer price index (CPI) is a fundamental gauge of inflation, spe￾cifically focusing on the retail level, where it assesses changes in the prices 
of consumer goods and services. Much like the PPI, the CPI comprises 
two crucial components: the overall rate and the core rate, with the latter 
being of higher significance to investors. The core rate is calculated after 
excluding the prices of food and energy, making it a more stable and reli￾able measure of underlying inflation trends.
The CPI serves as an essential indicator for the financial markets, and 
its movements hold the potential to impact both stocks and bonds. When 
the CPI rate experiences an increase, it generally exerts a negative influ￾ence on these markets. Conversely, when the CPI is stable or shows signs 
of decreasing, it is viewed as a positive development for the stock market. 
The rationale behind this is that a rising CPI signifies an increase in the 
cost of living, which can potentially lead to reduced purchasing power 
and affect consumer sentiment, which in turn can affect stock market 
performance. Due to the monthly volatility of CPI data, it is advisable for 
investors to consider the CPI average over several months to gain a more 
accurate understanding of the inflation trend and its potential impact on 
the financial markets.
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 184 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PMMonitoring the Economy • 185
Commodity Research Bureau Index
The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index is a critical tool for assess￾ing the trend in commodity prices, which are often the first indicators 
of inflationary pressures in the economy. The movement of commodity 
prices is of great importance to analysts and investors, as it directly impacts 
the prices of finished goods and services. When commodity prices remain 
low, it tends to keep inflation and interest rates at manageable levels, ulti￾mately benefiting both individual consumers and the broader economy. 
In turn, the stock market benefits from this scenario, as it thrives in an 
environment of stable prices and low interest rates.
It is important to note that the CRB index does not wield the same 
direct influence over the stock market as indicators like the CPI or the 
PPI. While fluctuations in the CRB index are closely monitored for signs 
of inflation, the stock market’s reaction to these changes may be more 
nuanced and influenced by a broader range of factors. Nonetheless, keep￾ing an eye on the CRB index remains an integral part of financial analysis 
for investors seeking a comprehensive understanding of market condi￾tions and potential influences on stock prices.
Employment
The monthly employment report from the Labor Department is a highly 
anticipated and closely watched indicator, with significant implications 
for investors and economists alike. This report serves as a key barometer 
for assessing the overall health and performance of the economy. Of all 
the components within the employment report, one that holds particu￾lar importance is the number of new jobs created during the reporting 
month. This figure provides critical insight into the trajectory of the econ￾omy, as job creation is typically associated with a thriving economy. 
Another vital component of the employment report is the unemploy￾ment rate, which investors look at closely. A steady or declining unem￾ployment rate is seen as a positive sign, indicating a labor market that is 
becoming increasingly robust. The reaction of investors to the employ￾ment report is contingent upon their expectations, which can vary widely 
depending on the current state of the economy. High expectations may 
lead to bullish sentiment in the stock market if the report exceeds them, 
while low expectations could have the opposite effect.
The employment report plays a pivotal role in shaping investor sen￾timent and influencing market performance. For this reason, it is imper￾ative to closely track and interpret the data presented in this report, as 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 185 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PM186 • Navigating the Stock Market
it can provide critical insights into the economy’s trajectory, job market 
stability, and overall market conditions. A strong employment report, 
characterized by robust job creation and a declining unemployment rate, 
is typically interpreted as a bullish signal for the stock market, while a 
weak report may raise concerns about the broader economy and trigger a 
bearish market sentiment.
Jobs Growth
The level of job growth holds paramount significance in assessing the 
economy’s health and its potential impact on the stock market. In a stead￾ily growing economy, the creation of two hundred thousand to three 
hundred thousand jobs per month is generally regarded as a positive indi￾cator, signifying a healthy economy, and typically met with optimism by 
investors. Any figure above or below this range can convey distinct mes￾sages about the pace and vigor of economic growth. Job creation figures 
exceeding this range may indicate a rapidly expanding economy, raising 
concerns about inflationary pressures. Conversely, job growth numbers 
falling below this range might signal a more sluggish or slowly growing 
economy, influenced by the phase of the business cycle, whether the 
economy is emerging from a recession, currently in a recession, or has 
been in an extended expansion period.
Excessive job growth can be viewed as inflationary, often leading to a 
negative response in the stock market. The correlation between job growth 
and stock market performance depends on various factors, including the 
specific conditions of the economy and the central bank’s monetary policy. 
Investors closely monitor job creation statistics as a barometer of economic 
health and potential inflationary pressures. It is essential to interpret job 
growth data within the broader context of economic conditions and factors 
influencing the stock market to make informed investment decisions.
SECONDARY INDICATORS
In addition to the primary indicators, there are many additional indicators 
monitored by stock market investors, which are discussed in this section.
Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a fundamental economic indicator 
that offers valuable insights into the health and growth of the econ￾omy. Reported quarterly, it represents the total value of goods and 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 186 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PMMonitoring the Economy • 187
services produced within a country during a specific period. The GDP’s 
significance lies in its ability to reflect the pace of economic expansion or 
contraction over the reporting period. Steady GDP growth is a positive 
indicator for the stock market, as it signifies a growing economy, which 
tends to translate into higher corporate profits. Investors typically view 
a report indicating strong and steady GDP growth as favorable, which 
can contribute to positive stock market performance. Conversely, a weak 
or negative GDP report is viewed negatively by the stock market, as it 
implies economic stagnation or contraction, which can undermine cor￾porate earnings.
It is worth noting that the market’s reaction to GDP reports is often 
relatively muted. This is because many of the components used to cal￾culate the GDP are known well in advance when the report is released, 
reducing the likelihood of significant surprises. If the actual GDP figures 
significantly deviate from the advance estimates made by economists, it 
can trigger a more substantial market reaction, leading to either opti￾mism or pessimism among investors, depending on the nature of the 
surprise.
Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers’ Index
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Purchasing Managers’ Index 
(PMI) is a critical economic indicator that provides valuable insights into 
the state of economic growth, particularly within the manufacturing sec￾tor. The overall PMI number is a crucial element, and it serves as a clear 
indicator of whether the manufacturing sector is expanding or contract￾ing. A number above 50 suggests that the manufacturing sector is in an 
expansion phase, which is indicative of a healthy and growing economy. 
Such expansion is generally viewed positively by the stock market, as it 
suggests a favorable economic environment with potential benefits for 
corporate profits. Conversely, a PMI number below 50 signifies a con￾tracting manufacturing sector, which is perceived negatively by the stock 
market as it implies economic slowdown or decline.
While the overall PMI index is the headline figure, it is important 
to note that it comprises several components, each providing unique 
insights into specific areas of the manufacturing sector. These compo￾nents include new orders, order backlog, supplier deliveries, inventories, 
prices paid, and more. Monitoring these components can provide a more 
comprehensive understanding of economic trends. When analyzing PMI 
data, investors often focus not only on the specific index number but also 
on the steadiness and trend of these numbers over time. A consistent 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 187 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PM188 • Navigating the Stock Market
trend, whether upward or downward, can offer additional context and 
predictability regarding the future state of the economy.
Housing
The housing sector plays a pivotal role in the broader economy, and its 
condition often mirrors the overall health of the economy. Investors 
closely monitor the housing sector as a leading indicator to anticipate the 
direction of the economy. Housing tends to be an early signal of economic 
trends; it is usually the first sector to show signs of weakening when the 
economy is heading into a recession, and conversely, it is often the first to 
recover when the economy is on an upswing. This sensitivity to economic 
shifts makes the housing sector a crucial barometer for forecasting eco￾nomic trends.
One of the primary factors influencing the health of the housing sec￾tor is mortgage rates. The housing market is acutely responsive to fluc￾tuations in mortgage rates, which, in turn, are influenced by changes in 
inflation and interest rates. When interest rates rise, mortgage rates tend 
to follow suit, making borrowing more expensive and potentially dampen￾ing the demand for homes. Conversely, when interest rates fall, mortgage 
rates also decrease, making home purchases more affordable and poten￾tially driving an increase in housing demand. As a result, housing data and 
trends can provide valuable insights into broader economic conditions 
and can serve as a useful early warning system for investors seeking to 
navigate economic cycles.
Housing Starts and Building Permits
In the realm of housing data, two vital metrics take center stage as lead￾ing indicators: housing starts and building permits. These indicators are 
particularly important because they foreshadow future construction and 
spending in the housing sector, often by several months. Housing starts 
representing the number of new residential construction projects that 
have begun during a given time period. Building permits, however, are 
official authorizations issued by local governments to commence new con￾struction. Both metrics serve as valuable tools for gauging the health of 
the housing sector and its impact on the broader economy.
An increase in either housing starts or building permits is seen as a 
positive sign for the economy. This is because they trigger construction 
spending and building activity, which, in turn, propels economic growth. 
When housing sector indicators reveal a healthy and robust upward trend, 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 188 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PMMonitoring the Economy • 189
it typically spurs optimism in the stock market. These indicators offer 
investors insights into the future trajectory of the housing sector, which 
plays a crucial role in the overall economy, thus making them essential 
tools for economic forecasting and investment decision-making.
Sales of New and Existing Homes
The sales of new and existing homes are critical factors in stimulating 
economic activity, as they initiate a cascade of purchases for items such 
as furniture, appliances, and other durable goods. These sales, whether 
new or existing homes, are key indicators of strength in the housing sec￾tor. Consequently, robust home sales are viewed as a positive sign for the 
stock market. It is worth noting that the performance of the housing mar￾ket can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in mortgage rates. When 
mortgage rates rise, it tends to put downward pressure on both new and 
existing home sales, which can slow down this vital sector of the economy.
Of the two, existing home sales hold a particular significance as they 
make up a substantial 80% of the total housing market. As a result, they 
are considered to be a more accurate and reliable indicator of the housing 
market’s performance compared to housing starts, which can represent 
merely expected or planned construction activity. Existing home sales 
provide insights into the actual transactions taking place in the market, 
which is a vital aspect of the housing sector’s health. Therefore, they play 
a crucial role in assessing the housing market’s status and its potential 
impact on the broader economy, making them important reference points 
for investors and analysts.
Construction Spending
Construction spending serves as an essential indicator, encompassing 
various aspects of construction activity, including residential and nonres￾idential new construction, as well as public construction spending. These 
expenditure levels are particularly sensitive to factors such as changes 
in mortgage rates, which can impact the overall health of the construc￾tion industry. When construction spending data is released, it typically 
does not produce a significant immediate effect on the stock market. The 
reason for this muted response is that construction spending figures can 
exhibit considerable monthly volatility due to fluctuations in construction 
projects. To better understand the trend and the overall health of this 
sector, it is advisable to analyze the data over a more extended period, 
such as a three-month span, rather than reacting to short-term variations.
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 189 2/6/2024 2:07:25 PM190 • Navigating the Stock Market
By looking at the data over a more extended time frame, investors 
and analysts can gain a clearer picture of the prevailing trends in construc￾tion spending. This approach allows for the identification of any overar￾ching patterns or shifts in construction activity, which may provide more 
substantial insights into the state of the economy and its potential effects 
on the stock market. Overall, construction spending serves as an impor￾tant barometer of economic health and can provide valuable guidance 
for investment decisions, especially when considered in conjunction with 
other relevant economic indicators and market data.
Retail Sales
Retail sales data is a critical economic indicator that provides valuable 
insights into consumer behavior. With consumers accounting for approx￾imately two-thirds of the overall US economy, the monthly retail sales 
report plays a pivotal role in assessing the health of the economy. By track￾ing consumer spending patterns, this report offers a direct indication of 
whether consumer spending, which significantly impacts economic per￾formance, is robust or weakening. Investors and analysts pay close atten￾tion to this report, as it can influence the market due to its potential to 
impact the broader economic landscape. When retail sales are on the rise, 
they are typically received positively by the market, signifying strong con￾sumer spending and, in turn, potential economic strength. Conversely, 
declining retail sales are viewed negatively, indicating a potential slow￾down in consumer spending, which can have adverse implications for the 
economy.
The Commerce Department’s retail sales data report provides a clear 
and up-to-date snapshot of consumer spending, which is a cornerstone of 
economic activity. Investors react to these figures as they reflect the pres￾ent state of consumer sentiment and economic health. A rise in retail sales 
suggests that consumers are confident and actively spending, which can 
contribute to an overall boost in economic growth and corporate earn￾ings. Conversely, a drop in retail sales can signal potential challenges for 
both the economy and the stock market, prompting market participants to 
adjust their investment strategies in response to shifts in consumer behav￾ior. Therefore, monitoring retail sales data is a fundamental practice for 
investors looking to make informed decisions.
Factory Orders
This comprehensive report encompasses new factory orders, which are 
further categorized into durable and nondurable goods, along with data 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 190 2/6/2024 2:07:26 PMMonitoring the Economy • 191
on inventories, factory shipments, and unfilled orders. Each of these 
components contributes to a holistic understanding of economic activ￾ity. New factory orders serve as a direct measure of demand for goods, 
encompassing both long-lasting items (durable goods) and those with a 
shorter lifespan (nondurable goods). Inventories indicate the supply of 
goods held by manufacturers, while factory shipments provide a real￾time measure of current demand in the economy. Additionally, unfilled 
orders reflect a longer-term perspective, indicating pent-up demand and 
backlogs that manufacturers need to address.
Due to the complex nature of the economy and the ever-evolving 
dynamics of supply and demand, factory orders can exhibit notable vol￾atility on a month-to-month basis. Consequently, investors and analysts 
often analyze data spanning about three months to identify trends that 
provide a more stable and insightful perspective. The factory orders 
report is essential for tracking economic activity and assessing how var￾ious sectors are performing. It plays a pivotal role in enabling investors 
to gauge the overall health of the economy, as the trends in factory 
orders and their components reflect the level of demand for goods 
and services. A positive trend in factory orders may indicate a growing 
and robust economy, which is usually met with positive sentiment from 
investors. Conversely, a negative or declining trend may raise concerns 
about the state of the economy and its potential impact on corporate 
earnings and the stock market. As such, factory orders data is a val￾uable tool for making informed investment decisions, especially for 
those who recognize its importance in assessing the broader economic 
landscape.
Durable Goods
Durable goods orders represent a particularly vital component of fac￾tory orders, which provide a key insight into the state of the economy. 
Durable goods are significant investments that are expected to remain in 
use for an extended period, typically three years or longer. They include 
items like automobiles, appliances, machinery, and aircraft, among oth￾ers. The measurement of new orders for durable goods serves as an 
indicator of future manufacturing activity. Because durable goods are 
often more expensive and require substantial consumer and business 
investment, their orders are highly sensitive to economic conditions 
and trends. As such, durable goods orders serve as an advance indicator, 
offering insights into how the economy is likely to perform in the coming 
months.
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 191 2/6/2024 2:07:26 PM192 • Navigating the Stock Market
Durable goods orders are especially valuable in forecasting economic 
trends because they typically reflect changes in demand for significant 
capital expenditures. As a leading indicator of future economic activity, 
durable goods orders tend to signal turning points in the business cycle. 
When new orders for durable goods increase, it is seen as a sign of eco￾nomic strengthening and potential growth on the horizon. Conversely, a 
decline in durable goods orders may suggest economic slowdown or con￾traction. This sensitivity to economic shifts means that changes in durable 
goods orders can impact the stock market. When orders for durable goods 
rise, indicating increased demand for long-lasting products, it tends to 
contribute to a positive sentiment in the market and can drive stock prices 
higher. Conversely, a decline in durable goods orders can raise concerns 
among investors about the state of the economy and its potential impact 
on corporate profits and, in turn, stock market performance. Therefore, 
monitoring durable goods orders is a valuable practice for investors to 
assess the broader economic outlook and make informed investment 
decisions.
Inventories
Inventories are a crucial economic indicator because they reflect the bal￾ance between supply and demand in the market. Businesses closely mon￾itor their inventories to ensure they can meet customer demand without 
overstocking or facing shortages. The level of inventories, in particular, 
whether they are rising or falling, can have significant implications for 
future business operations and economic conditions. Investors pay atten￾tion to inventories as they offer insights into a company’s management of 
its resources and its production and sales strategies.
When inventories are on the rise, it can suggest various scenarios. If 
inventories are increasing while sales remain sluggish, it could indicate 
that products are not moving off the shelves as expected, potentially sig￾naling weak consumer demand or oversaturation in the market. There 
are times when a company may intentionally increase its inventories in 
anticipation of a future uptick in sales, such as during a holiday season or 
a product launch. In such cases, rising inventories may actually be viewed 
positively as a strategic preparation for higher demand. Nevertheless, for 
investors, the key is to interpret inventory data in conjunction with other 
relevant variables, such as sales figures, to gain a comprehensive under￾standing of a company’s operational health and its positioning in the mar￾ket. If rising inventories are accompanied by declining sales, it can be a 
red flag that a company is not effectively managing its supply chain and 
may be vulnerable to losses.

Personal Income and Consumption Expenditures
Personal income and consumption expenditures are essential economic 
indicators, reflecting individuals’ financial health and spending patterns, 
with a significant impact on the overall economy. Personal income repre￾sents the total compensation received by individuals from various sources, 
such as wages, salaries, investments, and government assistance. When 
personal income rises, it implies that individuals have more disposable 
income to spend, save, or invest. This is seen as a positive sign for the 
economy since increased personal income can lead to higher consumer 
spending, which is a major driver of economic growth.
Consumption expenditures encompass the total market value of all 
goods and services purchased by individuals. When consumers increase 
their expenditures, it indicates growing confidence and willingness to 
spend, which can stimulate economic activity. Since consumer spend￾ing accounts for a significant portion of the overall economic activity, an 
uptick in consumption expenditures is viewed positively by the stock mar￾ket. It suggests that a key component of the economy is strong, which can 
contribute to higher corporate earnings and, in turn, drive stock prices 
higher. Therefore, investors closely monitor personal income and con￾sumption expenditures data to gain insights into the financial well-being 
of consumers and the potential direction of the economy. Rising personal 
income and increased consumer spending are generally seen as positive 
signals for both the economy and the stock market.
Industrial Production Index
The industrial production index (IPI) is an economic indicator that meas￾ures the real output of the manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas 
utilities sectors of the economy. It provides insight into the overall level 
of industrial activity, reflecting changes in production levels over time. 
The index is typically expressed as a percentage and is calculated based 
on the relative weights of different industries in the economy. It provides 
valuable insights into the health of the manufacturing sector, which plays 
a significant role in economic growth. 
When the industrial production index is on the rise, it signals 
increased manufacturing activity and production capacity utilization, 
suggesting a growing and robust economy. This positive momentum is 
generally well received by the stock market, as it implies the potential 
for higher corporate earnings and increased demand for goods and ser￾vices. Conversely, a decline in the industrial production index can be a 
cause for concern, indicating a slowdown in economic activity. A decrease 
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 193 2/6/2024 2:07:26 PM194 • Navigating the Stock Market
in industrial production implies reduced manufacturing output, which 
can lead to lower corporate profits and weaker economic performance. 
Investors closely watch this indicator to gauge the state of the manu￾facturing sector and anticipate its potential implications for the broader 
economy and stock market. A declining industrial production index may 
be viewed as a bearish signal for stocks, as it suggests economic challenges 
and reduced demand.
Capacity Utilization
Capacity utilization is a critical indicator that provides insights into how 
efficiently the country’s manufacturing capacity is being used. This metric 
is closely monitored by investors and economists because it can signal 
potential economic issues and inflationary pressures. When capacity uti￾lization is excessively high, it indicates that manufacturing facilities are 
operating close to their maximum capacity. This can lead to bottlenecks 
in the production process, potentially causing inflationary pressures as 
demand outstrips supply. Economists often identify a utilization rate of 
approximately 85% as a potential threshold where inflationary concerns 
may arise.
When capacity utilization is on the decline, it suggests that there is 
reduced demand and slower economic activity, leading to lower infla￾tionary pressures. A declining utilization rate can indicate a slackening 
in the economy and reduced stress on resources. In such cases, stocks 
tend to respond positively, as there are fewer concerns about inflationary 
overheating. If the utilization rate drops to very low levels, approximately 
80% or less, it can signal excess capacity, which may lead to reduced cap￾ital investment in manufacturing, potentially harming economic growth. 
Investors generally react positively to rising capacity utilization, as it indi￾cates a strong economy, but excessive levels can have a negative impact on 
stocks due to concerns of inflation and economic imbalances.
Index of Leading Economic Indicators
The index of leading economic indicators (LEI) is a vital tool used by 
investors to gauge the future direction of the economy. This monthly 
composite index consists of ten different indicators and is highly regarded 
for its ability to forecast the economic direction six to nine months in 
advance. The LEI is often considered a leading indicator because it tends 
to peak and trough earlier than the overall economy. Investors closely 
monitor this index as a change in the LEI’s direction for three consecutive 
months can signal a turning point for the economy.
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 194 2/6/2024 2:07:26 PMMonitoring the Economy • 195
It is important to note that while the LEI is generally reliable, it 
can occasionally fail to provide an accurate outlook. When the LEI is 
released, it does not typically have a significant impact on the stock mar￾ket. This is because the individual components of the LEI are released 
before the  overall index, reducing the element of surprise. Investors 
generally use the LEI as a part of their broader economic analysis and 
decision-making process, rather than relying solely on this indicator for 
immediate trading decisions.
Money Supply
The money supply, a crucial economic indicator, represents the total 
amount of cash and checking account balances within the country’s bank￾ing system, excluding government and interbank holdings. Investors 
keep a close eye on the money supply because it provides insights into 
the overall liquidity in the economy. A steadily growing money supply is 
generally preferred by investors as it often accompanies economic growth 
and stability. When the money supply is increasing at a sustainable rate 
and inflation remains steady or rises modestly, this is considered posi￾tive for the stock market.
Stocks tend to be negatively impacted if either inflation starts to rise 
significantly or if the money supply decreases. Inflation erodes the pur￾chasing power of money, and a rapid increase in inflation can erode stock 
returns in real terms. Likewise, a decrease in the money supply can lead 
to reduced liquidity in the financial markets, potentially causing stock 
prices to fall. Therefore, investors pay close attention to the relationship 
between the money supply, inflation, and their implications for the overall 
economy and stock market performance.
NSM_CH11_3pp.indd 195 2/6/2024 2:07:26 PMNSM_CH11_3pp.indd 196 2/6/2024 2:07:26 PMCHAPTER
GENERAL
Serious investors must systemically monitor and analyze their individual 
stocks, as well as their associated groups and sectors. This will ensure that 
they identify opportunities, trends, and risks in a timely manner, which 
will enable them to become successful investors.
Monitor Everything That Can Impact Your Stock
Monitoring your stock investments requires comprehensive attention to a 
wide range of factors that can influence their performance. Beyond track￾ing the market averages and individual stock prices, you should maintain 
a watchful eye on any elements that can affect a company’s fundamen￾tals and its business environment. This holistic approach to monitoring 
involves regularly observing the broader stock market trends, analyzing 
the industry or sector to which your stock belongs, and assessing the 
prevailing business conditions, including the competitive landscape and 
market dynamics. Stay attuned to economic indicators, interest rates, 
and their trends, as they can impact the broader investing environment.
One of the most critical aspects of your monitoring routine should 
focus on the stock’s fundamentals, with a specific emphasis on earnings. 
Regularly reviewing and interpreting earnings reports and financial state￾ments can provide valuable insights into the health of the company and its 
potential for growth. Additionally, keeping an eye on relevant news items 
related to the stock and its industry is crucial to stay informed and make 
well-informed investment decisions. Staying vigilant about these factors 
helps you adapt to changing circumstances, seize opportunities, and miti￾gate risks as you manage your stock portfolio.

Monitor Factors That Reduce Stock Supply
Monitoring factors that influence the supply of available stock is crucial 
for investors. Various events can impact on the stock supply, creating sit￾uations where there is increased demand but a reduced number of shares 
available for trading, leading to upward price pressure. Key events include 
mergers, acquisitions, and stock buybacks, which can decrease the availa￾ble stock supply. An expansion in supply can occur when companies issue 
additional shares, either through secondary stock offerings or as incentive 
shares to employees and management, which increases the number of 
outstanding shares. Additionally, stocks might become more available for 
trading once the lockup period for an IPO expires or if there is an increase 
in the stock’s float. Since the stock’s supply is a function of its total issued 
shares and daily trading volume, vigilant attention to factors that alter the 
stock’s float is crucial for investors to make informed decisions.
By tracking these factors, investors can anticipate how changes in the 
stock’s supply may affect its price and make more informed investment 
decisions. A reduced supply often creates favorable conditions for stock 
price appreciation, while an increased supply can lead to downward pres￾sure on stock prices. Understanding these dynamics allows investors to 
adapt their strategies, take advantage of potential opportunities, and nav￾igate potential risks in the stock market.
Monitor Factors That Increase Demand
Monitoring factors that impact stock demand is essential for investors as 
it provides valuable insights into potential price movements. Demand 
for a stock is influenced by a multitude of factors that fluctuate continu￾ously, and these factors can exert their effects rapidly or over an extended 
period. Fundamental aspects, including earnings, dividends, P/E ratio, 
and other valuation criteria, are significant drivers of stock demand. An 
increase in these fundamentals, such as a boost in earnings or dividends, 
can attract more investors and subsequently elevate demand for the stock. 
Conversely, a decrease or poor performance in these fundamentals may 
lead to reduced demand.
Apart from fundamentals, demand is also shaped by external factors 
such as acquisitions, economic conditions, the behavior of the overall 
market or specific industry groups, investor sentiment, analyst recom￾mendations, political developments, and other extraneous influences. 
For example, a positive economic outlook may boost demand for stocks, 
while a recession might dampen it. Similarly, favorable recommenda￾tions from analysts or positive news about an acquisition can stimulate 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 198 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMMonitoring Stocks, Groups, and Sectors • 199
investor interest and elevate demand. Investors should remain vigilant 
and continuously monitor these factors to stay informed about potential 
changes in stock demand that could impact their investment decisions 
and overall portfolio performance.
Learn to Recognize if Good or Bad News Has Been Discounted
Understanding how a stock reacts to news is crucial for investors, as it 
can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and help determine 
whether the news has already been factored into the stock’s price. When 
assessing a stock’s response to news, several factors come into play, includ￾ing the timing of the news release, the magnitude of the news (whether its 
exceptionally good or bad), and the prevailing market conditions.
If a stock exhibits minimal or no reaction to very bad news, it suggests 
that the news was likely anticipated or already priced into the stock. This 
is known as “discounting” or discounting the news. In such cases, inves￾tors had already adjusted their expectations and positions based on the 
negative information, rendering any subsequent downward movement 
less pronounced. Conversely, if a stock does not respond significantly to 
good news, it implies that the market may have already priced in the pos￾itive developments, limiting the upward momentum.
The same principle can be applied to broader market movements. 
When extraordinary good or bad news fails to significantly impact 
the overall market, it can be indicative of a market top or bottom. In these 
instances, the market may have already factored in the extreme news, 
suggesting that a reversal in trend could be on the horizon. Recognizing 
these subtleties in stock and market reactions to news is a valuable skill for 
investors, helping them make informed decisions and anticipate potential 
turning points.
Observe How Stocks and the Market Respond to News
Observing how stocks and the market respond to news is a crucial aspect 
of strategic investment analysis. The market’s reaction to specific news 
events can provide valuable insights into the underlying sentiments and 
expectations of investors. For instance, if a piece of news that would typi￾cally be perceived as negative for a particular stock has little to no impact 
on its price, it suggests that the market had already priced in this unfa￾vorable information. This phenomenon is indicative of a mature under￾standing among investors, as the stock appears resilient in the face of 
anticipated challenges.
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 199 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PM200 • Navigating the Stock Market
Conversely, analyzing the market’s response to bad earnings news 
can offer essential clues about the overall market sentiment. If neg￾ative earnings do not result in a significant downturn, particularly 
following a recent market decline, it may suggest that selling pres￾sures are waning, potentially signaling that the market has reached a 
bottom. Effectively observing how the stock market responds to both 
positive and negative news can offer investors valuable insights into 
anticipated or unexpected developments, facilitating more informed 
decision-making.
MONITORING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS
Monitoring individual stocks is a critical task that every investor needs 
to undertake. This section discusses how investors can systemically ana￾lyze  and track individual stocks, so that they stay well-informed and 
become successful investors.
Key Indicators That Are Widely Monitored
When navigating the vast array of available indicators, the challenge lies in 
choosing the most essential ones to monitor. To streamline this process, it 
is advisable to begin by identifying the indicators that are most commonly 
utilized by investors who align with your chosen investment strategy. By 
doing so, you can focus on the metrics that are most relevant to your 
approach and better guide your decision-making in the complex world of 
investing.
A comprehensive approach to monitoring and analyzing stocks 
begins with considering a range of fundamental indicators. EPS, both on 
a quarterly and annual basis, provides insight into a company’s profitabil￾ity, while growth rates in earnings and revenue offer crucial metrics for 
evaluating its financial trajectory. Keeping an eye on earnings estimate 
revisions helps anticipate a company’s future performance. The EPS rank 
and RS rank assess a stock’s standing in the market, considering its earn￾ings performance and relative strength against peers. Valuation metrics, 
such as the P/E ratio, relative P/E ratio, and P/E-to-growth ratio, provide 
insights into a stock’s affordability and growth potential. Moving averages 
offer a smoothed trend line, and metrics like accumulation and distribu￾tion gauge buying and selling pressures. Other fundamental indicators 
include daily trading volume, institutional presence percentage, insider 
trading activities, and cash flow growth rate, collectively forming a robust 
foundation for comprehensive stock analysis.
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 200 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMMonitoring Stocks, Groups, and Sectors • 201
Determine Reasons for Price Moves
Closely monitoring the stock prices of your individual holdings, as well 
as those of their competitors and the broader industry, is crucial in your 
investment journey. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how 
your  stocks are performing within the context of their sector, you can 
employ industry-specific indexes like the semiconductor (SOX) index 
for the semiconductor sector. By tracking such an index, you can discern 
whether your individual stock’s movement aligns with that of the indus￾try, whether it is being influenced by the sector, or if it is a response to 
competition dynamics. It is important to maintain a measured approach 
and not react hastily to minor price fluctuations that can occur on a daily 
basis. Should there be any unusual or significant price movement, or if 
daily trading volume experiences notable shifts, it is essential to promptly 
investigate the underlying reasons and take appropriate action, especially 
when the catalyst is adverse fundamental news.
By staying vigilant and conducting thorough assessments, you can 
effectively gauge whether these price moves are driven by specific factors 
or are part of broader market trends. This level of scrutiny ensures you 
make informed decisions, enhance your ability to seize opportunities, and 
safeguard your investments in the face of potential challenges.
Monitor Earnings Releases
Staying vigilant about earnings releases is a fundamental aspect of man￾aging your investment portfolio. It is crucial to keep a close eye on all 
earnings news and announcements for every stock in your portfolio. 
Understanding both the quarterly and annual earnings estimates is essen￾tial, as it provides insight into what the market and analysts anticipate for 
the company’s performance. Analysts often make periodic adjustments 
to these estimates, so it is important to keep track of these changes and 
stay informed about the consensus earnings estimates, revisiting them 
at least once a month. Be prepared for price fluctuations, especially if 
the quarterly earnings reported fall short of the consensus estimates. It 
is important to recognize that even if a company posts excellent earn￾ings, the stock might experience a decline, particularly if the stock had 
witnessed a significant price run-up leading to the earnings release. This 
phenomenon is often encapsulated by the Wall Street adage “Buy on the 
rumor and sell on the news.”
By closely monitoring earnings reports, you can make more informed 
investment decisions. Understanding the impact of these reports, whether 
they meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations, is crucial in navigating 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 201 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PM202 • Navigating the Stock Market
the volatile post-earnings market reactions. Additionally, assessing the 
broader market sentiment helps you formulate a well-rounded strategy to 
mitigate risks and seize opportunities.
Sources for Earnings Releases
In today’s digital age, accessing earnings releases and estimates has become 
more convenient than ever, thanks to the plethora of online sources dedi￾cated to providing this crucial financial information. Several reputa￾ble platforms are available, such as finance.yahoo.com, investing.com, 
investors.com, cnbc.com, and marketwatch.com. These platforms offer 
a wealth of comprehensive data, allowing investors to select the one that 
aligns with their preferences and needs. They play a pivotal role in equip￾ping investors with insights into predicted earnings, allowing them to 
anticipate financial outcomes before companies officially announce their 
results. Moreover, these platforms are instrumental in delivering real￾time earnings data as soon as it is released by the respective companies.
The online accessibility of such platforms not only simplifies the pro￾cess of staying updated on the financial performance of various companies 
but also enables investors to monitor market reactions to earnings releases 
promptly. Investors can leverage these online resources to make informed 
decisions, strategize their portfolio management, and adapt swiftly to the 
dynamic landscape of the stock market. The ease of online access empow￾ers investors with the timely information needed to efficiently navigate 
the complexities of financial markets.
Investigate Earnings Surprises
Earnings surprises can be a make-or-break factor for stocks, and they often 
lead to significant price movements. When a company’s quarterly earn￾ings significantly deviate from the consensus estimates, higher or lower, 
it is considered an “earnings surprise.” A positive earnings surprise, when 
a company outperforms estimates, can propel the stock’s price upward 
as investors react to the unexpected strong performance. Conversely, a 
negative earnings surprise, often resulting from a substantial earnings 
shortfall, can have a devastating impact on a stock, causing its price to 
plummet.
To assess the significance of an earnings surprise, it is essential to 
investigate not only whether the company met the estimated EPS figure 
but also the percentage change compared to the previous year’s com￾parable quarter. Understanding the factors contributing to the surprise, 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 202 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMMonitoring Stocks, Groups, and Sectors • 203
whether positive or negative, can provide crucial insights for investors 
looking to make informed decisions about their portfolios. Earnings sur￾prises are closely watched by the market, and they can be a critical driver 
of stock price movements.
Monitor Volume Signals
Monitoring trading volume is essential for investors, as it can provide val￾uable insights into market sentiment and stock price movements. When 
volume surges to unusually high levels, whether for an individual stock or 
the overall market, it signifies heightened interest and activity. Abnormal 
trading volume can be triggered by various factors, including significant 
news, technical signals like moving average crossovers, market trends, or 
correlation with the performance of another stock. It is important to rec￾ognize that substantial price shifts, whether upward or downward, often 
coincide with increased trading volume. In general, higher trading volume 
indicates greater strength in the price move, reinforcing its significance.
Many websites, including investors.com, can be used to identify 
stocks that experience the “largest percentage increase in volume” com￾pared to their average daily trading volume. By monitoring volume sig￾nals, investors can gain a better understanding of market dynamics and 
potentially identify stocks that are experiencing increased interest, which 
could lead to significant price moves. This information can be a valuable 
tool in making informed investment decisions.
Observe Changes in Trading Volume
Observing changes in trading volume is crucial for investors to stay 
informed about market developments and potential opportunities or 
risks. When a stock experiences a significant shift in its daily trading 
volume, especially when coupled with a sharp price movement, it serves 
as a valuable indicator of unusual activity that warrants investigation. For 
instance, a substantial increase in a stock’s price accompanied by heavy 
trading volume is generally considered bullish, suggesting strong investor 
interest and positive sentiment. If a stock’s price declines significantly on 
heavy trading volume, it is typically regarded as bearish, indicating poten￾tial negative sentiment and selling pressure.
Conversely, when trading volume dwindles, it can signal a potential 
bottom for a stock that has experienced a significant decline. Decreased 
trading activity may indicate that most of the selling pressure has 
been exhausted, potentially creating an opportunity for a price rebound. 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 203 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PM204 • Navigating the Stock Market
As an investor, staying vigilant and monitoring volume patterns is essential 
for interpreting market dynamics and making informed decisions based 
on changes in trading volume, which can provide valuable insights into 
market sentiment and potential price movements.
Monitor What Institutions Are Doing
Observing the actions of large institutional investors is a crucial aspect of 
tracking stock market trends and potential price movements. Institutional 
investors wield substantial buying power, capable of significantly influenc￾ing a stock’s direction. When institutions start accumulating a particular 
stock, their substantial purchases can drive the stock’s price considerably 
higher. Conversely, if institutions begin selling a stock, their selling pres￾sure can lead to a sharp decline in its value. As an individual investor, it is 
essential to monitor institutional activity to gain insights into the potential 
movements of stocks.
Two primary methods can be employed to keep tabs on institutional 
activity. First, you can utilize the accumulation/distribution indicator, 
which provides valuable insights into the actions of major institutional 
players. This indicator offers a clear perspective on whether institutions 
are actively accumulating or distributing a specific stock. Additionally, 
it can help discern the overall sentiment among institutional investors. 
Second, you can periodically check the percentage of outstanding stock 
held by institutions. This metric enables you to assess whether institu￾tional holdings in a company are increasing or decreasing over time. This 
information is provided by various online sources, such as investors.com. 
By closely monitoring these institutional actions, individual investors can 
better understand the dynamics of the stock market and make informed 
decisions based on the activities of major players in the market.
Monitor Stock Buybacks Announcements
It is important for investors to pay close attention to stock buyback 
announcements made by companies. When a company believes that its 
shares are trading at an undervalued price, it may decide to initiate a stock 
buyback program. In this context, the company purchases its own shares 
from the open market, effectively reducing the overall number of outstand￾ing shares in circulation. As a result, this reduction in the number of shares 
has the potential to enhance the EPS since it lowers the denominator used 
in the EPS calculation. The announcement of a share buyback program is 
generally viewed as a positive development by investors, as it signals that 
the company has confidence in its stock’s future performance and is willing 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 204 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMMonitoring Stocks, Groups, and Sectors • 205
to allocate resources to repurchase shares. This typically leads to increased 
demand for the stock and, consequently, a rise in its price.
Investors should closely monitor such buyback announcements as 
they can offer valuable insights into a company’s outlook and its belief 
in  the current undervaluation of its shares. Moreover, stock buybacks 
have the potential to benefit existing shareholders by enhancing the value 
of their holdings through the reduction of the share count. As such, buy￾back announcements are often regarded as a favorable signal for investors 
and can contribute to positive price movements in the stock.
Monitor Revenue (Sales) Growth Trend
Monitoring the trend of a company’s revenue or sales growth is crucial 
for assessing its overall health and financial performance. Consistent and 
steady revenue growth is a strong indicator of a company’s well-being, as 
it is often a precursor to sustained profitability. A company that is able to 
consistently increase its revenues over time is likely experiencing strong 
demand for its products and services. This growth in sales is indicative of a 
healthy business environment, and it provides a foundation for generating 
consistent profits.
It is essential for investors to delve deeper into the sales figures to gain 
a comprehensive understanding of the company’s performance. Simply 
observing robust sales growth is not sufficient. It is equally important 
to scrutinize whether the revenue growth is effectively translating into 
earnings at the bottom line. If revenue growth is not positively impact￾ing earnings, it is essential to identify the reasons behind this disconnect. 
Additionally, while sales figures are generally less volatile than earnings, 
investors should closely analyze trends in sales growth. If there is a notice￾able decline in the rate of increase in sales, it should serve as a warning 
sign that merits further investigation. Such a slowdown may indicate shifts 
in market dynamics or competition that could potentially affect the com￾pany’s long-term growth prospects.
Monitor How Margins Are Trending
Monitoring a company’s margin trend is essential for assessing its finan￾cial efficiency and competitiveness within its industry. Margins represent 
the percentage of sales that a company successfully converts into profits, 
and they play a significant role in determining overall profitability. Higher 
margins signify that the company is adept at converting its sales into net 
income and effectively managing its business operations. To evaluate a 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 205 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PM206 • Navigating the Stock Market
company’s performance accurately, it is important to compare its margins 
with those of other companies in the same industry or sector.
To make informed comparisons, it is advisable to refer to company 
research reports that provide comprehensive data on performance met￾rics, financial ratios, and margins for similar businesses. Examining vari￾ous types of margins, such as operating profit, pretax profit, and net profit 
margins, can offer valuable insights into different aspects of a company’s 
financial performance. For example, an improvement in operating mar￾gins indicates that the company is gaining a stronger foothold in its 
industry by effectively managing its operating expenses and boosting prof￾itability. Monitoring these margin trends allows investors to gauge how 
well the company is adapting to market dynamics, managing its costs, and 
ultimately generating profits, helping them make more informed invest￾ment decisions.
MONITOR THE INSIDERS
An “insider,” is an individual who has access to confidential and non-pub￾lic information about a company because of their position within the com￾pany. This section discusses various aspects of monitoring insiders, whose 
actions can influence future stock price movements.
Monitor Insider Trading
Monitoring insider trading activities can provide valuable insights into a 
company’s potential future performance. Historically, insider selling has 
been more prevalent than insider buying, but it may not necessarily indi￾cate a negative signal on its own. It is essential to be familiar with the typi￾cal insider trading patterns within your specific stock to be able to identify 
any unusual or significant activity. If insiders are selling shares at a rate 
lower than the standard behavior, it can be interpreted as a bullish sign, 
suggesting their confidence in the company’s future prospects.
Conversely, when you notice a conspicuous or substantial volume of 
insider selling, especially if multiple insiders are involved, it should be 
regarded as a potential warning flag. This could signal that those with an 
intimate knowledge of the company’s operations and financial health have 
concerns about its outlook. Insider buying is often considered a more 
reliable indicator of a stock’s future performance compared to selling. 
Investors tend to view insider purchases as a vote of confidence in the 
company’s potential for growth and financial strength. It is worth noting, 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 206 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMMonitoring Stocks, Groups, and Sectors • 207
however, that insider trading data is available to ordinary investors only 
after a certain time delay, which should be taken into account when inter￾preting these activities.
Monitor Insider Selling
Monitoring insider selling can indeed provide valuable insights, but it is 
crucial to consider the various reasons behind such sales. Insiders may sell 
shares for reasons unrelated to the company’s business prospects, such as 
exercising stock options, covering personal expenses, funding their chil￾dren’s education, or diversifying their investment portfolio. As a result, 
analyzing insider selling can be multifaceted, and it is essential to under￾stand the context of these sales.
It becomes more concerning if insider selling is unusually heavy, 
occurs after a rapid increase in the stock’s price, or deviates from the 
company’s typical insider trading patterns. Additionally, if you notice a 
situation where only insider selling is taking place without corresponding 
insider buying, it should raise a red flag. In such cases, it is advisable to 
exercise caution and carefully evaluate the stock’s outlook. Historically, 
insider selling has often acted as a leading rather than coincidental indi￾cator of market tops, making it a factor to watch for investors seeking to 
make informed decisions about their stock investments.
Monitor Insider Buying
Monitoring insider buying can offer valuable insights into a company’s 
future prospects. The primary reason insiders purchase their own compa￾ny’s stock is their strong belief in the company’s performance and stock’s 
potential. Such conviction is usually grounded in positive expectations, 
like anticipation of robust earnings, upcoming product launches, the start 
of a profitable cycle, the perception that the stock is undervalued, or other 
factors that favor the company’s business and fundamentals. Therefore, 
when you observe instances of insider buying, especially if it’s substantial, 
widespread throughout the company’s leadership, or conducted on the 
open market rather than through options exercises, it serves as a bullish 
signal.
Insider buying serves as an indicator that those with the most intimate 
knowledge of the company’s operations and future prospects have faith 
in its success. For investors, tracking insider buying activity can provide 
an early indication of where the stock might be headed. When consider￾ing your own stock purchases, aiming to buy at prices close to those at 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 207 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PM208 • Navigating the Stock Market
which insiders have made their acquisitions can be a prudent strategy, 
aligning your investments with the confidence expressed by the compa￾ny’s leadership.
MONITORING INDUSTRY GROUPS AND SECTORS
The behavior and performance of industry groups and sectors impact 
their individual members and, therefore, they must be analyzed by every 
serious investor. This section discusses various aspects of monitoring 
these groups and sectors.
Monitor Stock’s Sector and Industry Group Performance
Closely tracking your stock’s sector and industry group performance is vital for 
making well-informed investment decisions. Stocks within the same sector 
often move in tandem, responding to similar market forces and news events. 
Corrections or unfavorable news affecting a leading stock in the group can 
significantly impact all associated stocks. Therefore, it is essential to maintain 
constant awareness of your stock’s industry group, staying informed about its 
trading patterns, business prospects, and overall performance.
Assessing and monitoring industry group performance provides cru￾cial insights into expected stock performance. By observing signs of poten￾tial deterioration or positive outlook within the group, you can adjust your 
investments proactively. When signs suggest sector-wide weakness or a 
downturn in your stock’s industry group, consider reducing exposure to 
those areas. Conversely, in times of sector or industry strength, you can 
confidently increase investments to capitalize on positive market dynam￾ics. This strategic approach allows you to adapt to changing market condi￾tions, thus optimizing your portfolio’s performance.
Identify Group Leaders
Identifying the leaders within various sectors and industry groups is a cru￾cial aspect of successful stock market analysis. Market leaders are typically 
found in sectors and groups that are at the forefront of market trends and 
drive overall market performance. To pinpoint these leaders, it is essen￾tial to closely analyze the performance of different sectors and industry 
groups. By tracking how various sectors and groups are faring in the mar￾ket, you can more easily narrow down potential leaders.
One valuable resource for assessing the performance of sectors and 
groups is the Investor’s Business Daily (IBD), which comprehensively 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 208 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMMonitoring Stocks, Groups, and Sectors • 209
tracks 197 industry groups. By utilizing this source, you can identify 
groups with the highest percentage of stocks making new highs. Stocks 
in groups exhibiting this pattern are generally considered outperformers. 
By identifying these industry leaders, you can focus your attention on the 
sectors and groups with the most potential for strong returns, helping you 
make well-informed investment decisions and potentially enhancing the 
performance of your portfolio.
Monitor Industry Group’s Rank and Trend
Monitoring the rank and trend of your stock’s industry group is essential 
for making informed investment decisions. IBD ranks the price perfor￾mance for 197 industry groups on a daily and weekly basis. Additionally, 
it provides historical data on their performance over the prior six months. 
By using the industry group table in the IBD, you can easily determine 
the rank and trend of your stock’s industry group.
This information can be invaluable in helping you identify potential 
warning signs or positive signals. For instance, if your stock is declin￾ing while its industry group is on the rise, this divergence can serve as a 
warning sign. If the group has a high rank or is trending upward, it is a 
positive indicator. When the signals based on the industry group’s rank 
are negative, you might consider reducing your exposure to that particular 
group. In contrast, when the signals are positive, you can have more con￾fidence in your stock’s potential for strong performance, making it easier 
to make strategic investment decisions.
Monitor Industry Specific Index and/or Report
Monitoring industry-specific indexes and reports is crucial for investors 
who want to stay informed about the performance and trends within spe￾cific sectors of the economy. Various indexes have been created to track 
and represent different sectors, such as high-tech, junior growth, senior 
growth, consumer, gold, and defensive sectors. Each of these indexes pro￾vides valuable insights into their respective areas, allowing investors to 
gauge the health and performance of specific industries. You can easily 
access information on these sectors through various online trading and 
investment websites such as investors.com.
For instance, if you have investments in the semiconductor sector, 
it is essential to monitor the performance of the semiconductor sector 
index (SOX), also known as the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, 
which includes approximately thirty semiconductor-related companies. 
However, the specific number of companies in the index may change 
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 209 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PM210 • Navigating the Stock Market
over  time due to adjustments or updates by the index provider. By 
tracking the SOX index or other relevant sector-specific indexes, you can 
stay updated on how your investments within that sector are likely to per￾form. Additionally, periodic industry-specific reports, like retail sales data, 
are important for investors who have holdings in those particular sectors. 
These reports provide valuable information on consumer spending, mar￾ket trends, and the overall health of the industry, helping investors make 
well-informed decisions based on the latest data.
Monitor Other Groups and Sectors
In addition to keeping a close eye on your stock’s industry group and sec￾tor, it is important to monitor the performance of other sectors in the mar￾ket as well. The performance of various sectors can offer valuable insights 
and clues about the future direction of both the overall market and your 
specific industry group. For example, certain sectors like cyclical stocks, 
such as basic chemicals, tend to advance when a recession is ending, as 
their profits are closely tied to the state of the economy. Alternatively, 
defensive stocks become more attractive when economic growth starts to 
slow down at the end of an economic cycle, as investors seek safety and 
stability. These sector-related patterns can help investors make informed 
decisions about where to allocate their funds based on the broader eco￾nomic and market conditions.
It is important to note that sector behavior should not be solely relied 
upon as a forecasting tool, as assumptions and predictions made by inves￾tors and market participants can sometimes be incorrect. The market is 
influenced by a complex interplay of factors, and sector performance may 
not always conform to the expected trends. Therefore, it is crucial to use 
sector performance as one of several tools in your investment analysis and 
remain flexible in adapting to changing market conditions.
NSM_CH12_3pp.indd 210 2/6/2024 6:48:19 PMCHAPTER
HOW TO MONITOR THE MARKET
Individual stocks, operating within the stock market, are not immune to its 
health and dynamics. Therefore, every investor needs to monitor the stock 
market, and various aspects of this monitoring are discussed in this section.
Monitor the Market Trend
Monitoring the overall market trend is a fundamental aspect of successful 
investing. The market’s direction, whether it is in an uptrend or down￾trend, has a significant influence on your investment strategy and the per￾formance of your portfolio. In a declining market, it is common for the 
majority of stocks to be pulled down, whereas an advancing market tends 
to lift most stocks. While exceptional stocks can sometimes defy the trend, 
it is generally safer to align your investment approach with the broader 
market direction. As a result, understanding the health and direction of 
the market is crucial for making informed investment decisions.
Market trends don’t change overnight, and it is essential to maintain 
a consistent monitoring effort to stay updated on any shifts in market con￾ditions. Regularly analyzing market indicators, preferably at least once 
a week, ensures that you remain well informed and prepared to adapt 
your investment strategy to changing circumstances. Staying attuned to 
market trends allows you to adjust your portfolio positioning, whether 
it is adopting a more defensive posture in a bear market or capitalizing 
on opportunities in a bull market, all with the goal of optimizing your 
investment outcomes.

Monitor Market Behavior
Monitoring the market’s behavior and trend is crucial for successful 
investing. You can gauge market behavior by closely tracking major stock 
market averages and indexes. These groupings, which can range from 
a few to thousands of stocks, provide valuable insights into the behav￾ior of the overall market and specific sectors, helping to identify their 
underlying trends. Market averages and indexes are not only essential for 
benchmarking the performance of individual stocks but are also instru￾mental in assessing the overall health of the market. Investors utilize these 
indicators to detect signs of market extremes, such as tops and bottoms, 
anticipate trend reversals, analyze trading patterns, and make informed 
investment decisions.
For monitoring market behavior, several well-known indexes are 
widely used by investors. These include the DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ 
Composite, and the Russell 2000. These indexes provide a snapshot of 
how the broader market and specific sectors are performing, allowing 
investors to stay informed about market trends, which is essential for 
making strategic investment choices and optimizing portfolio outcomes. 
By consistently analyzing market behavior through these indexes, you can 
adapt your investment strategy to align with the prevailing market condi￾tions and make more effective investment decisions.
Monitor Market Averages and Indexes
Monitoring market averages is fundamental for tracking the collective 
movement of stocks and understanding broader market dynamics. The 
DJIA and NASDAQ are widely recognized benchmarks, with the DJIA, 
consisting of the thirty largest US companies, serving as a crucial indica￾tor of the overall market’s long-term behavior and economic health. It 
is important to note that the DJIA has limitations, not providing a com￾prehensive view of the entire stock market, necessitating the monitor￾ing of other market indexes for a more holistic perspective. Key market 
averages, like the S&P 500 and the technology-focused NASDAQ index, 
offer diversified insights into different sectors, aiding investors in mak￾ing well-informed decisions and adapting strategies to changing market 
conditions.
Major market indexes, including the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and those 
related to the NYSE, play a pivotal role in assessing overall market per￾formance. The NYSE composite index reflects the collective market 
value of all NYSE-listed stocks, providing a broad perspective on their 
performance. The S&P 500, tracking the 500 largest U.S. companies, acts 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 212 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 213
as a widely accepted benchmark for US equities. The NASDAQ index, 
focusing on technology and innovation, showcases smaller and innovative 
firms, making it essential for understanding growth dynamics. By moni￾toring these major market indexes alongside market averages, investors 
gain a diverse view of the overall market’s health, enabling more informed 
investment decisions.
Monitor Market Sector Indexes
For a more nuanced and short-term analysis of market dynamics, inves￾tors often leverage various market sector indexes to gain a detailed per￾spective on specific industries and segments within the broader market. 
These sector-specific indexes provide a granular view, allowing investors 
to assess the performance of distinct market segments and complement￾ing the insights derived from more general market indexes. By examining 
sector-specific trends, investors can make more informed decisions based 
on the specific dynamics influencing industries of interest.
In addition to sector indexes, investors often turn to broader market 
benchmarks such as the Russell 2000 and the Wilshire 5000 for a compre￾hensive overview of the market landscape. The Russell 2000 index spe￾cializes in tracking the performance of small-cap stocks, offering insights 
into a segment of the market known for its potential volatility and respon￾siveness to short-term market fluctuations. Conversely, the Wilshire 5000, 
with its extensive coverage of the overall market, serves as a robust indi￾cator, reflecting the collective wealth encompassed by a broad spectrum 
of stocks. Together, these indexes provide investors with a multifaceted 
toolkit for navigating the complexities of the financial markets.
USING MARKET INDICATORS
To ensure that they are well informed and on top of their investments, 
investors need to analyze the stock market from different perspectives, 
using a range of indicators, which are discussed in this section.
Select the Appropriate Average/Index
Selecting the appropriate market average or index to monitor is a key 
aspect of effective investment analysis. The choice should align with 
your investment strategy and goals. For instance, if you are a growth or 
momentum investor, it makes sense to compare your stock performance 
to indexes relevant to your investment approach, such as technology or 
small-cap indexes. Conversely, conservative investors who primarily invest 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 213 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AM214 • Navigating the Stock Market
in well-established, large-cap companies listed on the DJIA or S&P 500 
would not find the Russell 2000 index a suitable benchmark for assessing 
their portfolio’s performance. This targeted approach ensures that you are 
tracking indexes that are directly comparable and can provide valuable 
insights for your specific investment strategy.
Moreover, for those interested in gaining a comprehensive view of the 
market, focusing solely on a single index, such as the DJIA, may lead to 
missing significant market movements. Instead, it is prudent to monitor 
broader market measures like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ, which 
encompass a wider spectrum of stocks and industries. By considering your 
investment objectives and the relevance of specific indexes to your strat￾egy, you can make informed decisions about which averages or indexes to 
track and effectively gauge the performance of your investments.
Use Market Averages and Indexes for Comparing Performance
Market averages and indexes are invaluable tools for assessing the per￾formance of individual stocks and portfolios. They serve as benchmarks 
against which you can measure the success of your investments and over￾all strategy. For instance, if you have invested in semiconductor stocks, it 
is crucial to compare their performance to the semiconductor index. This 
comparison provides a clear picture of how your stocks are faring within 
the context of their respective industry, allowing you to make informed 
decisions about your investment strategy.
Similarly, when evaluating your entire portfolio, you can compare its 
performance to an appropriate market index or average. For instance, if 
you are a growth investor focused on smaller companies, the NASDAQ is 
a suitable benchmark. By analyzing how your portfolio stacks up against 
these benchmarks, you gain insights into the effectiveness of your invest￾ment choices and can make necessary adjustments to refine your strategy 
or tactics. Performance data for various indexes and averages is readily 
available from numerous online resources, ensuring you have access to the 
information needed to assess and optimize your investment performance.
Do Not Be Misled by the DJIA
While the DJIA is widely reported in daily news bulletins, it is essential 
not to conflate its performance with the overall health of the stock market. 
Ordinary investors often mistakenly associate the DJIA with the entire 
stock market’s well-being. To accurately assess the market’s condition, it 
is vital to examine the actions of other indexes and indicators that may 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 214 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 215
paint a different picture. For example, the DJIA could be reaching new 
highs while the NASDAQ, S&P 500, and the advance/decline line show a 
downward trend. Such discrepancies can signal the end of a bull market, 
as DJIA stocks are typically the last to decline. To gain a comprehensive 
understanding of the market, it is crucial to monitor multiple major mar￾ket averages and indexes beyond just the DJIA.
By taking a more holistic approach to analyzing market indicators and 
indexes, investors can better identify broader trends and potential shifts 
in market sentiment. Relying solely on the DJIA could lead to incom￾plete or even misleading insights into the overall market’s performance 
and trajectory.
Divergence Is a Warning Sign
Divergence in the movements of different market indexes, such as the 
DJIA and the NASDAQ, can serve as a crucial warning sign for investors. 
This phenomenon occurs when these indexes are heading in opposing 
directions, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics. Divergence 
often precedes changes in market direction and trends, making it an early 
indicator that investors should be vigilant about. It is essential to contin￾ually monitor the major market averages for any signs of divergence, as it 
can offer insights into the future direction of the market.
When you detect divergence between indexes, the next step is to 
assess whether the DJIA will ultimately follow the lead of the other index 
or vice versa. This interpretation may require experience and a deep 
understanding of market dynamics. By identifying and understanding 
divergence, investors can better position themselves to respond to market 
shifts and make informed investment decisions.
Monitor Market Averages and Indexes but Retain Perspective
While monitoring market averages and indexes is a valuable aspect of your 
investment strategy, it is crucial not to become overly fixated on these 
indicators. The primary focus of your monitoring efforts should always 
be the individual stocks within your portfolio. Investing success hinges 
on the performance of your specific holdings, so your primary concern 
should be getting your stock selections right. You could be accurate in 
predicting the market’s direction but still not achieve significant profits if 
your stock choices are flawed.
A critical piece of advice for investors is to avoid basing stock-picking 
decisions on market forecasts. Instead, your stock selections should be 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 215 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AM216 • Navigating the Stock Market
grounded in a thorough and comprehensive analysis of individual compa￾nies’ fundamentals. By conducting in-depth research on each company in 
your portfolio and closely monitoring their performance, you can make more 
informed decisions that will ultimately determine your success as an investor.
Be Aware of Factors Causing Volatility
Investors should always be aware of the factors that can cause market vol￾atility. Volatility can arise for various reasons and can significantly impact 
both the broader market and individual stocks. For instance, a sudden 
change in market direction, marking the onset of a correction or bear 
market, can lead to increased volatility as investors react to changing con￾ditions. Additionally, external events, such as negative political develop￾ments or economic news, can create uncertainty and fear in the market, 
causing abrupt and unpredictable price swings.
Other factors contributing to short-term volatility include major index 
changes, like a stock being added or removed from the S&P 500, options 
expiration days, triple witching day (when stock index futures, stock index 
options, and stock options all expire simultaneously), and end-of-quarter 
“window dressing” by money managers. During the latter, portfolio man￾agers may adjust their holdings to make them appear more successful by 
removing underperforming assets and increasing their holdings in win￾ners. All these factors can lead to temporary turbulence in the market, 
making it crucial for investors to stay informed and vigilant in their moni￾toring efforts to make sound investment decisions during volatile periods.
Monitor New Daily Lows to Determine Market Health
Analyzing the number of new daily lows on the NYSE is a valuable tech￾nique for evaluating the market’s health and potential issues. This metric 
measures the total number of stocks whose prices have reached new lows 
over the past year (prior fifty two weeks). A low number of new lows, typ￾ically less than forty, is a positive sign of a healthy market, indicating that 
a majority of stocks are performing well. It should be noted that when the 
number of new lows exceeds this threshold, it serves as a warning signal 
that the market might be encountering difficulties.
A persistent trend of more than forty new lows for five consecutive 
days is an even more severe concern. This condition suggests a deeper 
issue within the market, potentially indicating broader weakness in the per￾formance of various stocks. Investors and analysts use this information to 
make decisions about their portfolio and adjust their strategies accordingly, 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 216 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 217
especially when the number of new lows on the NYSE surpasses the critical 
threshold, as it may indicate a troubled market environment.
Monitor Indicators Spanning a Broad Spectrum
Monitoring a wide range of indicators is essential to comprehensively 
understand the market and make informed investment decisions. These 
indicators span various categories, including economic, psychological, 
technical, and performance factors. The importance and relevance of each 
indicator may vary depending on your investment approach and strategy. 
Nevertheless, ignoring any one of these indicators entirely can expose you 
to unnecessary risk as the market can be influenced by each of them.
For instance, psychological indicators can provide valuable insights 
into market sentiment, and overlooking them might lead to missing criti￾cal signals, such as overly bullish investor sentiment that could precede a 
market top. Similarly, neglecting economic data could result in failing to 
recognize shifts in interest rate trends or other economic factors that can 
significantly impact investment performance. By monitoring a diverse set 
of indicators, you can develop a more comprehensive view of the market 
and reduce the risk associated with unforeseen developments.
MONITORING PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICATORS
Stock market investors must monitor psychological indicators, which are 
discussed in this section, as investor sentiment and market psychology 
play significant roles in shaping price movements.
Analyze Psychological Indicators
Analyzing psychological indicators is crucial because both economic fun￾damentals and investor sentiment jointly influence stock market perfor￾mance. While economic factors drive a company’s profitability and, in the 
long run, play a primary role in determining stock performance, investor 
psychology often comes into play in the short term. The level of optimism 
or pessimism among investors can significantly impact buying and selling 
decisions, leading to market fluctuations. Therefore, for investors seeking 
success in the stock market, understanding both economic fundamentals 
and investor psychology is essential.
To gauge investor sentiment and the levels of optimism and pessi￾mism, psychological tools based on the principles of supply and demand 
can be valuable. These tools provide insights into market dynamics and the 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 217 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AM218 • Navigating the Stock Market
prevailing mood among investors, helping traders make more informed 
decisions. By incorporating psychological indicators into their analysis, 
investors can better navigate the stock market and make adjustments to 
their strategies as market sentiment evolves.
Learn to Recognize Sentiment Extremes
Recognizing sentiment extremes is essential because the stock market 
operates at the intersection of economics and psychology. It experiences 
shifts in sentiment, moving from fear and pessimism to greed and eupho￾ria. These emotional cycles play a significant role in influencing stock 
prices. Investors must understand and identify the signs of sentiment 
extremes in the market to make well-informed decisions.
When you identify periods of excessive speculation, you can exercise 
caution to avoid potential market bubbles or unsustainable rallies. On the 
contrary, during times of panic and widespread pessimism, recognizing 
sentiment extremes can be an opportunity to find undervalued assets or 
stocks poised for recovery. By being attuned to the psychological aspects 
of the market, investors can adapt their strategies to different phases of 
the market cycle and make more profitable decisions.
Be a Contrarian
Being a contrarian investor involves the willingness to go against the 
crowd and the prevailing market sentiment. Many investors tend to fol￾low popular trends or react emotionally to market movements, which can 
lead to herd behavior. Yet it’s important to note that successful investing 
requires independent thinking and making decisions based on careful 
research and analysis rather than succumbing to prevailing emotions.
Contrarian investors recognize that market bottoms often coincide 
with widespread fear and panic. In these moments, they see opportunities 
to buy undervalued assets before a potential rebound. Conversely, they 
understand that market tops are often marked by euphoria and excessive 
optimism, which can be a signal to sell and take profits before a mar￾ket correction. By being contrarian, investors aim to capitalize on market 
inefficiencies and make more informed, rational decisions that align with 
their long-term investment goals rather than short-term trends.
Buy on the Rumor—Sell on the News
The saying “Buy on the rumor—sell on the news” is a valuable reminder 
of the role that sentiment and expectations can play in the stock market. 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 218 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 219
When there is widespread anticipation of positive news about a stock, 
investors often rush to buy shares, driving up the price in the lead-up 
to the actual news release. This behavior is based on the belief that the 
anticipated news will have a positive impact on the stock’s performance.
Once the news is officially released, the stock may not react as 
expected because the market had already priced in the good news during 
the anticipation phase. In such cases, selling on the news can be a prudent 
move. It is important to note that this strategy relies on market sentiment 
and psychology, rather than strict adherence to fundamental analysis. 
Therefore, investors should exercise caution when following this adage, 
as the actual impact of news on a stock can vary, and trading decisions 
should be based on a combination of factors, including fundamentals and 
technical analysis.
Do Not Get Overexcited by News Stories About a Company
The stock market often operates on the principle of anticipation, where 
smart investors try to forecast future events before they become widely 
known. Stocks tend to make their most significant moves while they are 
still under the radar and have yet to capture the attention of the gen￾eral public and media. These early moves are often driven by institutional 
investors who accumulate positions before the broader market catches 
on. As a result, buying a stock before it becomes a popular topic in the 
media can be a strategic move.
When news stories about a company start appearing in widely read 
publications like Forbes or Barron’s, it is a signal that the stock’s story has 
already been disseminated to a broad audience. At this point, many mar￾ket participants are aware of the positive news, and the stock may have 
already seen a significant price increase in anticipation of that news. As 
a result, there might be fewer buyers left to drive the stock higher, and 
investors should be cautious about chasing a stock after it becomes a 
media sensation. Instead, it is important to evaluate the potential impact 
of positive news stories and consider whether the stock has already bene￾fited from the positive sentiment generated by media coverage.
Stock Price Relative to Its Moving Averages Influences Sentiment
The relative position of a stock’s price in relation to its moving averages 
can provide valuable insights into both its past performance and future 
trend. In particular, comparing the current stock price to its 200-day 
moving average is a common practice among investors. When a stock’s 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 219 2/14/2024 11:41:45 AM220 • Navigating the Stock Market
price is trading above its 200-day moving average, it is generally consid￾ered a positive sign. This suggests that the long-term trend for the stock is 
upward, and it also indicates that the majority of investors who purchased 
the stock in the past two hundred days are in a profitable position, which 
tends to contribute to positive sentiment.
Conversely, when a stock’s price is trading below its 200-day moving 
average, it often indicates a more negative sentiment. This means that 
many investors who have bought the stock in the past two hundred days 
are experiencing losses, which can lead to pessimism and a bearish out￾look on the stock. Monitoring the stock’s position relative to its moving 
averages is a fundamental aspect of technical analysis, and it helps inves￾tors gauge the sentiment of the market participants, which can be influ￾ential in predicting future price movements.
USING PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICATORS
Psychological indicators enable investors to anticipate potential shifts in 
market trends, caused by fear and greed. This section discusses how to 
use and benefit from various psychological indicators.
Monitor Sentiment Indicators
Monitoring sentiment indicators is essential for understanding the psy￾chological dynamics within the stock market. Two major groups whose 
sentiment significantly impacts the market are consumers and investment 
advisors. Consumer sentiment is typically measured using tools like The 
Conference Board’s consumer confidence index and the University of 
Michigan’s consumer sentiment index. When these indicators are on the 
rise, it signals an increasing level of consumer optimism, which, in turn, 
translates to greater spending, contributing to economic growth and ulti￾mately benefiting companies’ profitability. This positive sentiment tends 
to have a favorable effect on the stock market.
Alternatively, the sentiment of investment advisors is measured by the 
Investors’ Intelligence Survey, which serves as a contrarian indicator. In 
this context, a high level of bullish sentiment (or a low bearish sentiment) 
is often considered a negative signal, indicating that there may be too 
much optimism in the market, potentially signaling an overheated market. 
Conversely, a high level of bearish sentiment (or a low bullish sentiment) 
is seen as a positive signal, suggesting that there might be more room for 
upside potential as the market is not overly optimistic. Monitoring these 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 220 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 221
sentiment indicators provides investors with crucial insights into market 
psychology, helping them make informed decisions.
Consumer Confidence Index
The Consumer Confidence Index is a critical monthly indicator, reported 
by the Conference Board, and plays a significant role in shaping economic 
and market sentiment. This index measures the level of confidence among 
consumers, a group responsible for roughly two-thirds of the US economy 
through their spending habits. The Consumer Confidence Index serves 
as an invaluable gauge of future consumer spending trends. When con￾sumers are feeling optimistic and have a positive outlook, they are more 
likely to increase their spending, which is beneficial for economic growth. 
Conversely, when consumer confidence is low or declining, it can signal 
economic trouble on the horizon.
The release of the Consumer Confidence Index is often a highly 
anticipated event because it has the potential to influence the stock mar￾ket. An unexpected rise or fall in this index can trigger significant market 
reactions.
Consumer Sentiment Index
The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index is a vital report 
among the two major consumer sentiment indexes that Wall Street closely 
watches. These reports provide key insights into how consumers, who are 
the backbone of the US economy, perceive their current financial situ￾ation and their future expectations. A positive report with a rise in con￾sumer sentiment is viewed as a bullish sign, suggesting that consumers are 
optimistic about their financial prospects and may increase their spend￾ing. Conversely, a negative report with a decline in consumer sentiment is 
considered bearish, as it implies that consumers may become more cau￾tious about their spending habits, which can have broader implications for 
the overall economy and the stock market.
The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index is particu￾larly significant for market observers because it can provide hints about 
future market movements. When consumer confidence reaches its nadir, 
it often indicates a potential bottom for the stock market. In other words, 
when consumer sentiment is at its lowest point, it may signify a turning 
point where investors become more confident and start entering the mar￾ket again, which can be the initial phase of a market recovery. Therefore, 
this index is an important tool for investors and analysts to gauge the 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 221 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AM222 • Navigating the Stock Market
sentiment of the general public and its potential impact on economic 
activity and stock market trends.
Bullish Readings Are Bearish and Vice Versa
Understanding the dynamics of bullish and bearish readings is crucial in 
interpreting the sentiment indicators accurately. When there is an exces￾sive level of bullish sentiment among investors, it often suggests that a 
large percentage of investors have already invested their available funds 
in the market. This leaves limited buying power available to continue 
driving stock prices higher. In such situations, high levels of bullishness 
can coincide with market tops, indicating that the market may be over￾extended and a reversal could be on the horizon. Therefore, when the 
bullishness number exceeds 55%, it is generally considered a bearish sign 
as it may imply that the market has reached a point of excess optimism 
and could be vulnerable to a correction.
Conversely, widespread bearish sentiment suggests that many inves￾tors are holding cash on the sidelines, potentially poised to enter the 
market when they perceive attractive opportunities. When this sidelined 
cash is deployed into stocks, it can drive significant upward momentum. 
Therefore, a bearish sentiment indicator reading below 20% signals that 
investors are overly optimistic. When bearish advisors exceed 55%, it is 
viewed as very bullish because it indicates that the market may be over￾sold and could be due for a rebound. In practice, analysts often consider 
both bullish and bearish sentiment indicators in conjunction to obtain a 
more comprehensive view of market sentiment. For instance, a combina￾tion of high bullish sentiment (above 55%) along with bearish sentiment 
dropping below 20% can be seen as a dangerous sign, suggesting that 
market sentiment is excessively skewed, which may have serious implica￾tions for market direction and potential risks.
Sentiment Is a Leading Indicator
Sentiment indicators are considered leading indicators because they often 
provide insights into future market behavior. When investor sentiment 
reaches an extreme level of optimism and speculation, it is a sign that the 
market may be approaching a top. This is because, at such points, the 
majority of potential buyers have already invested their available funds, 
leaving limited buying power to drive prices higher. In contrast, when 
pessimism prevails, and investors are overwhelmingly bearish, it suggests 
a market bottom could be near. This is because most potential sellers have 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 222 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 223
already sold their positions in response to negative sentiment, creating 
conditions for a potential rebound.
Understanding how to interpret sentiment indicators, especially when 
they reach extreme levels, is crucial for investors. When these indicators 
signal excessive bullish sentiment, it serves as an early warning sign that 
the market might be vulnerable to a correction or reversal. Conversely, a 
very negative bearish reading can imply that the market is poised to rise 
in the future as sidelined cash enters the market. By effectively utilizing 
sentiment indicators, investors can gain valuable insights into the timing 
of potential market tops or bottoms.
Monitor the Put/Call Ratio
The put/call ratio is a valuable sentiment indicator, particularly for moni￾toring the sentiment of option investors in the market. This ratio is deter￾mined by analyzing the relative number of put and call options being 
traded. When investors are optimistic about the market’s future and antic￾ipate rising stock prices, they tend to buy call options, which provide the 
right to purchase the underlying stock at a predetermined exercise price. 
Conversely, when bearish sentiment prevails, and investors expect stock 
prices to decline, they are inclined to buy put options, which grant the 
right to sell the underlying stock at a specific exercise price.
A significant spike in the put/call ratio, particularly when it reaches a 
value of 1 or higher, indicates excessive put buying, which signals a height￾ened level of fear in the market. Contrary to common expectation, this 
fear-driven extreme suggests that the market might be at or near a bot￾tom, presenting a potential opportunity for investors. By monitoring the 
put/call ratio, investors can gain insights into the prevailing sentiment and 
position themselves to make informed decisions in response to shifts in 
market sentiment.
Loss Through Short Selling Can Be Devastating
Short selling is a strategy that carries significant risks due to its asym￾metric nature. When an investor shorts a stock, the potential for profit 
is capped at 100% if the stock’s price falls to zero. Not surprising, the 
downside risk is virtually limitless. As stocks have no upper limit to their 
potential appreciation, short sellers can face substantial losses as stock 
prices rise. In some instances, particularly with technology stocks, certain 
equities have experienced price increases of 1,000% or more. When such 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 223 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AM224 • Navigating the Stock Market
substantial rallies occur, the losses incurred by short sellers can indeed be 
devastating.
Despite the potential for profit in short selling, the long-term statisti￾cal trends in the stock market are not in favor of short sellers. Historically, 
equity markets have tended to rise over time, with upward movements 
significantly outweighing declines. Therefore, the odds are generally 
against short sellers, making it a high-risk strategy that requires careful 
consideration and risk management to avoid substantial losses. Investors 
need to be aware of these risks and exercise caution when implementing 
short selling as a trading strategy.
Analyze Short Interest
Short interest is a key indicator that can provide insights into market sen￾timent and the valuation of individual stocks. When short sellers believe 
that a particular stock or the overall market is overvalued, they tend to 
increase their short positions. This results in a higher level of short inter￾est. Monitoring the trends in short interest can be valuable for investors 
as it reflects the collective opinion of short sellers regarding the future 
performance of stocks or the market. If short interest is on the rise, it 
signals that a significant number of investors are adopting a bearish stance 
and anticipate lower prices. Conversely, when short interest declines, it 
suggests a more bullish sentiment among investors.
In the long run, rising short interest can be a bullish signal for the 
market. This is because, eventually, short positions will need to be cov￾ered by repurchasing shares, potentially driving up prices. It is important 
for investors to keep an eye on short interest trends as they can provide 
valuable information about market dynamics and investor sentiment, 
helping them make more informed investment decisions.
Mutual Funds’ Cash Levels Provide Valuable Insight
The cash levels held by mutual funds can offer valuable insight into the 
overall sentiment and health of the stock market. When mutual funds 
begin to increase their cash reserves, it is often interpreted as a bullish 
sign in a contrarian manner. This is because a higher cash reserve indi￾cates that these funds have money available to invest in the stock mar￾ket. When this cash is eventually deployed into equities, it can potentially 
drive up stock prices, leading to a positive impact on the overall market.
Conversely, when mutual funds hold low cash reserves, it suggests 
that they have already invested a significant portion of their available 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 224 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AMMonitoring Market and Psychological Indicators • 225
capital. In this scenario, there is limited buying power left among these 
funds, which is typically viewed as a bearish sign. A scarcity of available 
cash can restrain the market’s ability to move higher. Therefore, investors 
often monitor cash levels held by mutual funds as an indicator of potential 
market trends and to make more informed investment decisions.
Monitor Mutual Funds’ Cash Levels
Monitoring the cash levels of mutual funds can provide valuable insights 
into the current sentiment of the market. Historically, a cash level of 
around 7% was considered a fully invested position for these funds. 
Therefore, when analyzing these cash levels, it is important to pay atten￾tion to whether they are increasing or decreasing over time, as the trend 
can be a more meaningful indicator than a specific percentage figure.
The significance of the percentage number itself may vary in differ￾ent market conditions, so observing the direction of the trend is crucial. It 
is important to note that the historical reliability of cash levels as an indi￾cator has been somewhat mixed in recent years due to changing market 
dynamics and fund management strategies. Therefore, while monitoring 
this indicator, investors should consider it alongside other relevant market 
signals and not rely solely on cash levels for their investment decisions.
Know What the Insiders Know
Monitoring insider buying and selling activities is a valuable practice for 
investors because it allows them to gain insights into the knowledge and 
sentiments of company executives and major shareholders. These insiders 
have access to critical information that is not readily available to the gen￾eral public, including details about a company’s strategic decisions, finan￾cial performance, competitive positioning, and internal developments. As 
a result, their investment decisions can be considered well-informed and 
timely.
When insiders buy or sell a company’s stock, it serves as a signal that 
can provide valuable clues about the company’s future prospects. Insider 
transactions, especially when significant in scale, can indicate confidence 
or concern among those who know the company best. Consequently, 
regularly monitoring insider activity in the stocks you own or are con￾sidering buying can help inform your investment decisions. This infor￾mation is publicly available through sources like the SEC, the Vickers 
Weekly Insider Report, and various websites dedicated to tracking insider 
trading. By paying attention to insider transactions, investors can gain 
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 225 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AM226 • Navigating the Stock Market
a better understanding of a company’s health and potential investment 
opportunity or risk.
Understand Limitations of Psychological Indicators
Psychological indicators are valuable tools for gauging market sentiment 
and can provide essential insights for investors. When examined collec￾tively, these indicators tend to be reliable and often serve as leading indi￾cators of future market behavior. One must remember that it is essential 
for investors to recognize the potential limitations associated with psycho￾logical indicators for making informed investment decisions.
One limitation of psychological indicators is the time lag between 
data collection and reporting. This lag can reduce their effectiveness as 
leading indicators, as market conditions may have evolved significantly by 
the time the data becomes available. Additionally, while these indicators 
are widely used and can be instrumental for decision-making, they are 
often underutilized during market bottoms, which is precisely when they 
can be most valuable, as investors may be hesitant to buy when sentiment 
is overwhelmingly negative. Understanding these limitations while still 
incorporating psychological indicators into your analytical toolkit can help 
you make more effective investment choices.
NSM_CH13_4pp.indd 226 2/14/2024 11:41:46 AMCHAPTER
BUYING
Investors make many mistakes when buying stocks, which can impact the 
overall profitability of their various investments. The common mistakes 
that they make are discussed in this section.
Do Not Buy a Stock Without a Profitable Track Record
Ensuring that a stock has a profitable track record is a fundamental cri￾terion for many investors, as it provides a historical perspective on a 
company’s financial health and its ability to generate consistent earnings. 
This long-term profitability history, ideally spanning three to five years, 
offers insight into a company’s resilience and financial management. An 
occasional losing year may be acceptable if it was followed by a quick 
turnaround, but a consistent pattern of losses should raise red flags. Note 
that exceptions can be made for companies facing unique challenges, 
such as a severe economic recession, as long as there is a clear path to 
profitability in the near future.
Furthermore, the current profitability of a company is equally impor￾tant. A company that is currently incurring losses should demonstrate 
a strong potential for a turnaround or have a clear strategy in place to 
regain profitability. Investing in a company that has never been profit￾able can be exceptionally risky, as it mirrors the cautionary tales of the 
dot.com bubble where many companies with soaring stock prices and no 
profits ultimately faced significant declines or even bankruptcy. As such, 
maintaining a focus on a stock’s profitable track record, both past and 
Buying and Selling Mistakes

NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 227 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AM228 • Navigating the Stock Market
present, is a sensible approach to mitigate risks and increase the chances 
of long-term success.
Do Not Ignore Leaders
Ignoring leaders and winning stocks due to concerns about overvaluation 
is a common mistake made by investors. These stocks often exhibit strong 
fundamentals, but they might appear expensive based on traditional val￾uation metrics like the P/E ratio. This can lead to missed opportunities 
when such stocks are on the cusp of significant upward moves. The over￾sight stems from a failure to recognize the exceptional growth potential 
these companies possess, which can eventually drive their valuations to 
more reasonable levels.
Leaders and winning stocks tend to have compelling growth stories, 
and their rapid appreciation is often a reflection of their strong earnings 
and revenue growth potential. By investing in these stocks, investors can 
benefit from the potential for substantial returns as they continue to grow 
and expand. Rather than being deterred by temporarily high P/E ratios or 
recent price spikes, astute investors recognize the value of growth-oriented 
investments and focus on their long-term prospects. As they execute their 
growth strategies and deliver on their potential, these stocks have the 
potential to become highly profitable investments over time. Therefore, 
investors should avoid the pitfall of disregarding leaders and winners sim￾ply because they appear overpriced by traditional valuation standards, as 
this can lead to missed opportunities for significant gains.
Do Not Favor Low-Growth Companies
As a growth investor, your primary focus should be on high-growth 
companies rather than settling for those with mediocre growth rates. The 
most significant price appreciation in the stock market typically occurs 
for companies whose earnings are growing at an above-average pace. 
Therefore, it is essential to identify and invest in companies with a solid 
track record of long-term growth, ideally in the range of 20% to 30%. This 
growth rate should be sustainable and consistent, spanning at least three 
to five years into the future, rather than being solely based on the current 
year’s performance.
When targeting high-growth companies, it is also important to 
exercise caution with hypergrowth firms that might experience excep￾tionally rapid growth within a short time frame. While these companies 
can be tempting, they come with elevated risk. The potential for rapid 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 228 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AMBuying and Selling Mistakes to Avoid • 229
burnout within a year or two means investors need to be mindful of their 
investments, especially as the market dynamics may change, affecting the 
prospects of these firms. Therefore, in your quest for growth investments, 
it is wise to strike a balance by focusing on companies with consistent, 
sustainable, and above-average growth rates while avoiding the excessive 
risks associated with hypergrowth companies.
Do Not Buy Mediocre Companies
Investors should avoid buying mediocre companies because, in most 
cases, they are likely to deliver lackluster performance. Mediocre com￾panies typically exhibit lower earnings growth, slower price appreciation, 
and have limited potential for significant business expansion. It is impor￾tant to understand that choosing to invest in a mediocre company simply 
because its stock price is low is not a winning strategy. In fact, opting for 
a mediocre company because it’s inexpensive can result in subpar returns 
and underwhelming investment results.
In the world of investing, the concept of “cheap” is relative. While 
a mediocre company’s stock price might seem attractive from a valua￾tion standpoint, it is crucial to recognize that this apparent cheapness is 
often a reflection of the company’s inferior prospects and limited growth 
potential. Therefore, as an investor, it is generally more advisable to pay 
a premium for shares of an outstanding company with a track record of 
success and robust growth potential than to settle for a subpar investment 
with limited prospects for long-term success.
Avoid Leaders Nearing the End of Their Run
When investing, it is essential to focus on sectors or industry groups that 
exhibit strong fundamentals and clear growth prospects. While it may be 
tempting to invest in sectors or groups that are currently in an uptrend or 
are experiencing many new highs, it is crucial to consider the underlying 
fundamentals and future prospects. It is a common mistake to chase after 
short-term trends without a solid foundation of fundamentals. Instead, 
investors should prioritize sectors with healthy and rapidly improving 
earnings, as these have the potential to exceed earnings expectations and 
offer more sustainable growth.
Furthermore, it is important to exercise caution when dealing with 
industry groups that have been leaders for an extended period. While 
these groups may have enjoyed a strong run, they might be nearing a point 
of correction or pullback. To make more informed investment decisions, 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 229 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AM230 • Navigating the Stock Market
consider selecting stocks with robust fundamentals from industry groups 
that are currently trending upward and displaying a significant percent￾age of new highs. This approach helps ensure that your investments are 
grounded in solid financial performance and positioned for long-term 
success.
Avoid Companies Embroiled in Serious Litigation
Investors should exercise caution when considering companies that are 
entangled in significant litigation issues. Such legal disputes introduce an 
elevated level of uncertainty and risk into the investment equation. The 
outcome of litigation is often uncertain, and if a company does not prevail 
or faces an adverse judgment, it can have severe financial repercussions. 
A  negative judgment may lead to substantial financial penalties, dam￾ages, or other adverse consequences, jeopardizing the company’s financial 
health and impacting its stock price.
Moreover, ongoing litigation tends to deter investors and keep 
them at bay, causing the stock’s performance to suffer. The uncertainty 
and potential legal liabilities can overshadow any positive fundamental 
aspects of the company. As a result, investors are advised to be cautious 
and avoid investing in companies embroiled in serious litigation, particu￾larly those heavily reliant on a single product or source of revenue, as the 
litigation’s outcome can significantly impact their financial stability and 
stock performance.
Do Not Buy a Stock Just Because It Has a Low Price
Investors should exercise caution when considering stocks solely based on 
their low price. A low stock price does not necessarily equate to a good 
investment opportunity. In many cases, a low stock price is indicative of 
a company with an unproven or risky business model and often low earn￾ings. A high-priced stock often corresponds to a company with a strong 
track record of earnings and growth. It is important to consider the rela￾tionship between a stock’s price and its earnings, as this provides valuable 
insights into its valuation.
Instead of solely focusing on a stock’s price, investors should conduct 
a comprehensive analysis that includes an assessment of the company’s 
financial health, competitive position, industry outlook, and growth pros￾pects. While an undervalued or oversold stock may appear attractive due 
to its low price, it is crucial to evaluate these factors alongside the stock’s 
current valuation. The price should be just one of several selection criteria, 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 230 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AMBuying and Selling Mistakes to Avoid • 231
and it should be considered in the context of the company’s fundamentals, 
such as its earnings and future growth potential.
Do Not Buy Immediately After a Big Price Drop
It is generally advisable to exercise caution when considering a stock pur￾chase immediately after a significant price drop. After a sharp decline, 
it is essential to allow the stock to stabilize and consolidate its price for 
a period. This stabilization period is often referred to as basing, during 
which the stock trades within a relatively narrow price range. During this 
time, it is crucial for investors to investigate the reasons behind the stock’s 
decline, ensuring they understand the underlying causes.
Investors should also conduct a thorough analysis of the company’s 
fundamentals to ascertain its financial health, competitive position, and 
future growth prospects. Once the stock has stabilized and investors 
have confidence in its fundamentals, it can be evaluated as a potential 
buy candidate. It is important to consider the stock’s potential for price 
appreciation based on its newly stabilized price. In some cases, experi￾enced investors with an in-depth knowledge of the company may choose 
to act quickly if they are confident that the stock will rebound soon. For 
most investors, it is advisable to take a more cautious approach and allow 
the stock to base and stabilize before making an investment decision, 
as this approach can help minimize risks associated with volatile price 
movements.
Do Not Buy Just Because Stock’s Price Declined to a Lower Level
Purchasing a stock solely based on the fact that its price has declined to a 
lower level can be a risky and often counterproductive approach. While 
it is understandable that stock trading at a lower price may seem like an 
attractive opportunity, it is essential to recognize that price alone does 
not tell the full story. Stocks that have experienced significant declines 
may have underlying issues, and their price may continue to deteriorate. 
The history of the stock market is rife with examples of companies whose 
shares plummeted from high price levels to single-digit values, leaving 
investors with substantial losses.
Instead of focusing on the historical price of a stock, prudent inves￾tors should base their buying decisions on its future prospects. This 
approach involves a comprehensive analysis of the company’s fundamen￾tals. Assessing where the stock is headed in terms of future performance 
is more crucial than dwelling on where it has been. By considering the 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 231 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AM232 • Navigating the Stock Market
stock’s prospects rather than fixating on its historical price, investors can 
make more informed and forward-looking decisions, reducing the risk of 
buying into a deteriorating investment.
Do Not Focus Only on the Buy Price
Focusing solely on the buy price, without considering the stock’s future 
potential, can lead to missed opportunities and suboptimal investment 
decisions. Investors who fixate on buying at a specific price, such as wait￾ing for a stock to drop from $41 to $40 before making a purchase, may 
overlook the broader picture. If a stock is poised for substantial growth 
and expected to reach the $60s in the near future due to strong funda￾mentals, projected earnings, and a competitive advantage, the difference 
between entering at $40 or $41 becomes less significant. In such cases, 
waiting for a minor price drop might result in missing out on the stock’s 
upward momentum and potential profits.
This approach of focusing on the stock’s future direction is par￾ticularly relevant for long-term investors who have a horizon extending 
beyond short-term price fluctuations. For traders with a shorter time 
frame, it may make sense to be more price-sensitive and wait for specific 
entry points, but investors with a longer investment horizon should prior￾itize the stock’s growth potential over minor variations in the entry price. 
By considering the stock’s expected trajectory and fundamental strength, 
investors can make more strategic and forward-thinking decisions, maxi￾mizing the potential for portfolio growth.
Do Not Avoid Buying Because the Stock Price Is at a New High
Buying stocks at new highs can be a successful strategy for momentum 
investors who recognize the advantages of such opportunities. One key 
benefit is the absence of overhead supply or resistance, which can allow 
the stock to move higher without facing significant obstacles. Despite 
these advantages, some investors following different approaches may 
hesitate to invest in stocks at new price highs, often perceiving them as 
overvalued or overpriced. It is essential, however, to adopt a more com￾prehensive perspective before disregarding a stock just because it is trad￾ing at a new high.
To make an informed decision, investors should conduct a thorough 
evaluation of the stock in question. Assess key factors such as estimated 
earnings, growth prospects, and other fundamental indicators that can 
influence the stock’s future performance. By analyzing the potential 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 232 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AMBuying and Selling Mistakes to Avoid • 233
price appreciation and growth prospects for the stock in the coming year, 
investors can make a well-informed decision about whether the stock is 
worth buying despite trading at new highs. This approach allows investors 
to capitalize on stocks with strong upward momentum and the potential 
for further gains, rather than missing out on opportunities due to precon￾ceived notions about new highs.
Do Not Buy a Company Just Because It Has a Low P/E Ratio
It is common for investors, particularly those following a value-based 
investing strategy, to focus on stocks with a low P/E ratio. The rationale 
behind this approach is that stocks with low P/E ratios are seen as reason￾ably priced, with limited downside risk and the potential for significant 
upside gains. It should be noted, however, that investors who solely rely 
on a low P/E ratio as their primary buying criteria might find themselves 
in an unfavorable situation if they neglect to examine the underlying rea￾sons for the low P/E.
In many instances, a company’s low P/E ratio is justified by the fact that 
it has a poor business outlook or a bleak earnings forecast. Consequently, 
these stocks may not appreciate in price for an extended period or might 
even experience price declines. This highlights the importance of con￾ducting a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond the P/E ratio and takes 
into account the company’s overall financial health, growth prospects, and 
the reasons behind the low valuation. Such a holistic approach can help 
investors avoid making the mistake of investing in companies with low P/E 
ratios due to fundamental weaknesses that could hinder their long-term 
performance.
Do Not Buy Low Liquidity Stocks
Liquidity is a crucial factor for stock investors, and it directly impacts the 
ease and speed at which you can buy or sell a stock. One of the primary 
reasons people invest in the stock market is the ability to quickly liquidate 
their investments, either partially or in full, if the need arises. Most stocks 
can be sold within minutes on any of the stock exchanges, providing a high 
level of liquidity. Although for some stocks, this is not the case, and low 
liquidity can pose a significant issue.
Low liquidity typically pertains to stocks that have a limited daily 
trading volume, meaning only a small number of shares change hands 
each day. These stocks can be challenging to sell even during normal mar￾ket conditions, but the real problem becomes apparent during turbulent 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 233 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AM234 • Navigating the Stock Market
periods. During market volatility or uncertainty, it can become extremely 
difficult to sell low-liquidity stocks, potentially leading to substantial losses. 
To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to focus on stocks with a higher level of 
liquidity, preferably those that trade at least 200,000 shares per day. This 
ensures that you have the flexibility to enter and exit positions swiftly, pro￾viding greater peace of mind and control over your investments.
Do Not Buy Defensive Stocks Near the End of a Recession
As a smart investor, it is essential to pay attention to the economic cycle 
and understand its impact on different types of stocks. Defensive stocks 
are typically favored by investors when they anticipate an economic reces￾sion because these companies tend to have more stable revenues and 
profits that are less sensitive to economic downturns. It is crucial to be 
strategic about the timing of your investments. As the economy begins to 
emerge from a recession and shows signs of recovery, the focus of inves￾tors shifts. They start anticipating that company profits will rebound, and 
they redirect their investments toward cyclical and growth stocks, which 
are positioned to benefit from the economic upturn. This shift in inves￾tor sentiment often leads to these stocks experiencing significant price 
appreciation.
To maximize your returns and participate in the broader market 
rebound, it is advisable not to invest heavily in defensive stocks near the 
end of a recession. Instead, consider reallocating your investments to sec￾tors and stocks that are poised for growth as the economy improves. This 
approach allows you to capture the potential gains associated with the 
recovery phase of the economic cycle, taking advantage of the changing 
market dynamics.
Do Not Give Importance to Tips and Rumors
Receiving stock tips and rumors from various sources is a common occur￾rence in the world of investing. While it is acceptable to consider such 
information, it is crucial not to assign undue importance to these tips. 
The key to making informed and successful investment decisions is to 
separate the tip itself from the person or source providing it. Rather than 
blindly acting on a tip, it is essential to subject the recommended stock to 
the same rigorous fundamental analysis that you would apply to a stock 
identified through your usual investment research process. This approach 
ensures that you make decisions based on solid information and analysis 
rather than on hearsay, reducing the level of risk associated with your 
investments.
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 234 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AMBuying and Selling Mistakes to Avoid • 235
By conducting thorough due diligence and relying on fundamental 
analysis, you can make well-informed investment choices that align with 
your financial goals and risk tolerance. Avoiding knee-jerk reactions to 
tips and rumors helps you maintain a disciplined and strategic approach 
to investing, ultimately improving your chances of success in the stock 
market.
SELLING
Investors also make many mistakes when selling stocks, which can also 
impact the overall profitability of their various investments. The common 
selling mistakes that they make are discussed in this section.
Do Not Focus Too Much on the Buy Price
When evaluating a sell decision, investors often tend to focus too much on 
the buy price and the current “loss” or “profit” associated with their hold￾ings. This approach may lead to suboptimal decisions because it does not 
take into account the stock’s future price appreciation potential. A more 
rational and forward-looking strategy involves assessing whether the stock 
is expected to be a winner based on its forecasted price appreciation. If the 
analysis indicates that the stock is likely to deliver significant future gains, 
it should be retained, regardless of the current paper loss. If the stock’s 
total holding period does not align with the expected returns and the fun￾damentals are sound, it might be time to consider selling. Confidence 
should not be eroded by a paper loss, but a sell decision becomes justified 
if the company’s future prospects appear uncertain.
Investors must remember that the objective is not just to recover 
the initial investment or breakeven but to optimize returns. This means 
considering the stock’s future potential rather than dwelling solely on the 
past. A disciplined approach to evaluating stocks based on their long-term 
outlook and fundamental strength can lead to more informed sell deci￾sions and ultimately contribute to better investment outcomes.
Do Not Fail to Cut Your Losses and Let the Profits Run
One of the common mistakes investors make is failing to cut their losses 
when a stock turns into a loser. There is often an emotional attachment to 
the stock, leading to irrational hopes that it will rebound. This emotional 
bias can lead to paralysis, and the small loss initially incurred can snowball 
into a larger one. To mitigate this, it is crucial to adhere to your predefined 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 235 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AM236 • Navigating the Stock Market
selling rules. When you identify a stock as a loser, you should sell it imme￾diately. This proactive approach ensures that you do not find yourself 
stuck in a situation where you are unable or unwilling to cut your losses.
Contrarily, successful investors adopt the strategy of letting their prof￾its run. When a stock becomes a winner, it is tempting to cash in imme￾diately to lock in gains. The key is to ride your winning stocks for as long 
as possible, selling only when their fundamentals deteriorate or when the 
price significantly outpaces earnings growth. By prioritizing the selling of 
underperforming stocks and holding on to the winners, you can maximize 
your investment returns and reduce potential losses in your portfolio.
Do Not Hold on to Mediocre Performers
It is crucial not to hold on to mediocre performers in your portfolio for 
an extended period. While patience is important in stock investing, you 
should also establish a regular review process, typically after twelve to 
eighteen months, to evaluate your holdings. When this review reveals that 
a stock is a mediocre performer with a lackluster outlook for the future, it 
is important not to delay in selling it. Instead, consider reallocating your 
capital to stocks with better performance expectations.
The decision to sell a mediocre performer isn’t only about freeing up 
capital but also about optimizing your portfolio’s performance potential. 
By actively managing your investments and replacing underperforming 
stocks with stronger opportunities, you can enhance your overall returns 
and ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your financial goals.
Do Not Delay Selling for Minor Gains
When you have made the decision to sell a stock, it is important to act 
promptly and not delay the sale for minor gains. Attempting to extract 
every last cent from a stock can backfire, especially when its fundamentals 
are deteriorating. In such situations, it is crucial to sell the stock immedi￾ately and not to hesitate. Delaying the sale in hopes of earning a few extra 
cents per share can expose you to significant losses, as the likelihood of a 
substantial price decline often outweighs the potential for slight upward 
movement in such cases.
Recognize that a swift and decisive approach to selling underperform￾ing stocks is essential to minimize your exposure to risk and safeguard 
your investment capital. By avoiding unnecessary delays and making sell 
decisions based on the stock’s fundamentals and market conditions, you 
can make more informed and effective choices in managing your portfolio.
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 236 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AMBuying and Selling Mistakes to Avoid • 237
Do Not Delay Selling Due to a Rebound Expectation
It is imperative not to delay selling a stock due to the expectation of a 
rebound that may yield only marginal gains. If your fundamental analysis 
indicates that a stock should be sold, it is essential to act on that informa￾tion promptly. Waiting for a rebound can be risky, as it’s difficult to predict 
the precise point at which a declining stock will find stability. Believing 
that a stock that has already experienced significant losses cannot decline 
further can lead to prolonged holding of losing positions; this can ulti￾mately result in even greater losses. Moreover, holding onto a losing stock 
with the belief that stocks always recover is a misconception. In reality, 
many stocks never come close to reaching their all-time highs again.
Maintaining discipline in your selling decisions, guided by objective 
analysis rather than emotions or unrealistic expectations, is crucial to 
managing risk and protecting your investment capital. By avoiding the 
trap of waiting for rebounds that may not materialize and taking proactive 
steps to manage underperforming stocks, you can make more informed 
choices and better position your portfolio for success.
Do Not Sell Too Early
Selling winning stocks too early is a common mistake among investors, 
and it often occurs when they focus solely on the price appreciation that 
has already occurred. In order to maximize the returns on your portfo￾lio, you should evaluate a stock’s potential to rise even higher based on 
its fundamentals. If your analysis suggests that there is significant upside 
potential left, it is wise to let your profits run. A few successful winners 
can more than compensate for multiple small losses in your portfolio.
The key to successful investing is to identify and maintain positions in 
stocks that have strong growth prospects and the potential for substantial 
price appreciation. By avoiding the temptation to sell prematurely and 
holding onto your winning stocks as long as they align with your funda￾mental analysis, you can capture the full benefit of their upward momen￾tum and achieve better overall portfolio performance.
Do Not Sell Your Slightly Overpriced Fast Growers
Selling your slightly overpriced fast-growing stocks can be a costly mistake. 
While conventional valuation criteria might suggest that these stocks are 
overvalued, it is essential to understand that high-growth winners 
and leaders often appear overpriced because of the strong demand 
they attract. This demand drives their prices and P/E ratios higher. 
NSM_CH14_2pp.indd 237 1/27/2024 11:13:23 AM238 • Navigating the Stock Market
When fundamentals are sound and the stock is showing the potential 
for substantial growth, selling it solely based on valuation can result in a 
missed opportunity for a substantial profit.
In such cases, it is crucial to consider the long-term growth prospects 
of the stock, as well as the strength of its fundamentals, instead of focusing 
exclusively on the current price or P/E ratio. The market rewards high￾growth stocks for a reason and holding onto them even when they seem 
slightly overpriced can often lead to significant returns in the future. By 
staying focused on the company’s growth potential and fundamentals, you 
can make more informed decisions about when to sell such stocks.
Do Not Make Taxes an Important Factor
While tax considerations should be a part of your investment strategy, it 
is important not to make them the primary factor when deciding whether 
to retain or sell a stock. Many investors tend to hold onto a stock that has 
reached its peak, even when they are aware that it is time to sell, just to 
delay the associated tax liability. This delay can come at the cost of missing 
out on potential profits by not moving into a more promising stock. Taxes 
should be taken into account, but they should not overshadow the fun￾damental and price appreciation potential of the stocks in your portfolio.
In some cases, holding onto a stock just to avoid taxes can result in 
missed opportunities and potential losses that outweigh the tax benefits. It 
is crucial to strike a balance between managing your tax liability and mak￾ing investment decisions based on a stock’s growth potential and overall 
fundamentals. By keeping this perspective, you can make more informed 
choices when it comes to selling stocks.

GENERAL
The stock market is a complex environment where many variables are at 
play. This section provides additional tips that investors can use for mak￾ing or monitoring stock investments.
Be an Informed Investor
Being an informed investor is the key to success in the stock market. Success 
is not a matter of luck but rather a result of careful preparation and diligent 
research. Those who invest with a well-thought-out plan and stay informed 
about their investments tend to be rewarded, while those who rely on gut 
feelings or chance often end up with losses. To be a successful investor, 
you must maintain a state of perpetual alertness and information-gathering.
This involves continuous monitoring of the companies in which you 
have invested, as well as the industry or group to which those companies 
belong. Understanding the competitive landscape and what factors can 
influence the fundamentals of your stock investments is crucial. Economic, 
financial, and political news can all impact your investments, so it is vital 
to stay informed about these developments and analyze how they might 
affect your stocks or their respective industries. A well-informed investor 
is better equipped to make sound decisions and adapt to changing market 
conditions, and, as such, should never stop monitoring their investments 
and the broader economic and political environment.
Learn to Filter Out the Noise
In the stock market, numerous factors and forces are at play, and their 
influence can vary significantly over time. Economic data, political 
Miscellaneous Tips
15
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 239 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM240 • Navigating the Stock Market
developments, market sentiment, and other variables can all impact stock 
prices to varying degrees. As a result, the stock market can be a noisy and 
chaotic place, making it challenging for investors to discern the essen￾tial factors from the less significant ones. Typically, seasoned investors 
develop the skill of filtering out the noise and honing in on the critical var￾iables that truly affect the stock market and their individual investments.
To become adept at filtering out the noise, investors must prioritize 
their focus on key factors like economic indicators, company financials, 
industry trends, and market sentiment. They need to discern which vari￾ables have the most significant impact on their investment strategies and 
concentrate their research and analysis on those aspects. This ability to 
sift through the noise and maintain a clear focus on what truly matters is a 
valuable skill in making informed investment decisions.
Never Stop Monitoring
In the world of investing, the concept of never-ending monitoring is an 
essential one. The stock market is a highly dynamic and ever-changing 
environment, where factors that influence stock prices, from economic 
shifts to corporate developments, constantly evolve. Even if you hold 
a stock with promising prospects, you cannot assume that its position 
will remain unaltered over time. Business conditions, competitive land￾scapes, growth rates, and various other fundamental aspects are subject 
to change. Therefore, the investor’s vigilance and ongoing monitoring are 
crucial because complacency can lead to unpleasant surprises.
The stock market is known for its capacity to defy expectations and 
provide unforeseen developments, and investors must adapt to these 
changes. The economy, stock market, and individual stocks can all deliver 
unexpected events and challenges. As a result, staying alert and contin￾uously monitoring your investments is a practice that should remain in 
place for as long as you are involved in the stock market, as it has a way of 
surprising even the most seasoned investors.
Avoid Excessive Monitoring
The frequency of monitoring your investments should align with the time 
frame in which the variables you are tracking can change significantly. 
Different factors are subject to distinct reporting schedules. Earnings 
reports, for example, are released on a quarterly basis, while employ￾ment data is published monthly, and GDP reports come out quarterly. 
Stock prices and news, however, fluctuate daily, and they might provide 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 240 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 241
vital insights into your investments. As such, daily monitoring is often 
necessary for news that pertains to your specific company, as it can reflect 
major changes in the business environment or profitability. Monthly anal￾ysis is typically sufficient for reports such as inflation and employment 
data, while more infrequent checks, perhaps quarterly, may suffice for 
variables like GDP.
In general, dedicating approximately three to four hours per week to 
investment research and monitoring can be a reasonable commitment for 
most investors. The key is to strike a balance between staying informed 
and not letting monitoring consume an excessive amount of your time. 
By understanding the nature of the variables you are tracking and their 
significance to your investments, you can develop a monitoring schedule 
that effectively aligns with your investment strategy and goals.
Follow a Few Stocks but Monitor Them Closely
To be an effective investor, it is important to focus your attention on a 
select few stocks while monitoring them closely. In-depth understanding 
of a company’s business, its stock’s behavior, and its industry dynamics 
takes a considerable amount of time and effort. Therefore, it is essential 
to recognize the finite nature of the time available for stock investment 
research and make a conscious effort to limit the number of stocks you 
track closely. Trying to follow too many stocks can lead to a lack of depth 
in your analysis and can become overwhelming.
Monitoring should not be confused with daily tracking of stock prices. 
Instead, it involves staying well-informed about every aspect of the busi￾ness and its broader environment that can impact the stock’s performance. 
This could include understanding the company’s financials, industry trends, 
competitive landscape, and any external factors like economic conditions 
or political developments that may influence the stock. By focusing on a 
manageable number of stocks, you can dedicate the necessary time and 
attention required to make well-informed investment decisions and avoid 
spreading yourself too thin across a large number of investments.
Learn How to Interpret Recommendations
Understanding analyst recommendations can be a challenging task due to 
the multitude of categories and ratings used by analysts. These categories 
can vary from “strong buy” to “sell,” and the interpretation of these recom￾mendations might differ between analysts. The terminology can become 
even more confusing when different analysts use the same categories but 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 241 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM242 • Navigating the Stock Market
have slightly different criteria for assigning them. Some analysts may also 
avoid using the “sell” category altogether.
It is essential to grasp the specific categories and their meanings used by 
the analysts you follow to accurately interpret their recommendations. For 
instance, a rating such as “hold” from one analyst could imply a suggestion to 
sell the stock, while for another it may just mean they see no compelling rea￾son to buy or sell at the moment. To avoid misinterpretation, it is important 
to understand the specific criteria and context behind each recommenda￾tion. Carefully researching the analyst’s methodology and any accompanying 
research reports can provide valuable insights into the true meaning of their 
stock ratings, helping you make more informed investment decisions.
Ensure That Stock Being Considered Is Adequately Covered
The level of analyst coverage for a company is indeed quite variable, and 
it is essential for investors to take this into account when considering an 
investment. Newer or smaller companies may have limited analyst coverage, 
making it more challenging to obtain comprehensive and accurate infor￾mation about their financial performance and prospects. Established and 
well-known companies often attract a larger number of analysts who track 
their performance, issue recommendations, and provide earnings forecasts.
Having at least four analysts covering a company is considered 
a minimum threshold, as this helps reduce the risk of significant inac￾curacies in financial projections. When multiple analysts are tracking a 
company, there is a greater likelihood of balanced and accurate assess￾ments. Investors often rely on the earnings estimates and recommenda￾tions provided by these analysts to make informed investment decisions. 
The more analysts covering a company, the more confidence investors can 
have in the accuracy of the information they rely on for their investment 
strategies.
Understand Stock Classifications 
Understanding stock classifications is crucial for investors when building 
a diversified portfolio that aligns with their financial objectives and risk 
tolerance. Market capitalization is one of the key metrics used to classify 
stocks, and it provides insights into the size of a company. Large-cap com￾panies typically have market capitalizations of $1 billion or more, and they 
are often considered more stable and established. Medium-cap stocks 
fall within the $100 million to $1 billion range and represent companies 
that are somewhat smaller but still significant in size. Small-cap stocks are 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 242 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 243
typically defined as those with market capitalizations under $1 billion or 
sometimes by their stock price, such as being under $20.
Investors should consider their investment goals and risk tolerance 
when determining their preference for stock classifications. Large-cap 
stocks may be suitable for those seeking stability and more modest growth, 
while small-cap stocks can be attractive to investors who are willing to 
take on higher risk in exchange for the potential of significant growth. 
By carefully analyzing and selecting stocks based on their classification, 
investors can tailor their portfolios to align with their individual invest￾ment strategies and financial objectives.
Monitor Brokerage Asset Allocation Announcements
Monitoring asset allocation recommendations made by prominent broker￾age houses like Goldman Sachs can provide investors with valuable insights 
into the overall sentiment and expectations of major financial institutions. 
These recommendations often involve adjustments in the suggested alloca￾tion of funds between stocks and bonds, and they are typically rooted in the 
brokerage house’s outlook on market conditions. For instance, if a broker￾age house increases its recommended stock allocation from 55% to 60%, it 
signifies a bullish view on the stock market. Conversely, a decrease in the 
recommended allocation may indicate a more bearish outlook.
These announcements hold significance because they reflect the 
collective wisdom and market influence of these brokerage firms, which 
manage substantial sums of money. When multiple brokerages are increas￾ing their recommended stock allocations, it suggests a broader consensus 
that the stock market holds potential for growth. This information can be 
valuable for investors in understanding the current market sentiment and 
making informed decisions about their own asset allocation strategies.
MONITORING EXTERNAL FACTORS
Many external factors influence the stock market as well as individual 
stocks. The impact of the key external indicators, which can be significant, 
is discussed in this section.
Do Not Ignore Either Internal or External Factors
Internal and external factors play significant roles in influencing the per￾formance of your stocks, and as an investor, it is crucial not to overlook 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 243 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM244 • Navigating the Stock Market
either of these factors. Internal factors include elements related to the 
specific company you have invested in, such as its financial health, man￾agement team, competitive position, and growth prospects. External 
factors encompass broader economic, political, and industry-related ele￾ments that can affect the market and your stocks, including inflation rates, 
government policies, and global events. Neglecting any of these factors 
can have severe consequences for your stock investments.
While there are numerous internal and external factors at play, not 
all of them will impact your stocks in the same way or to the same extent. 
Therefore, it is essential to identify and closely monitor the specific fac￾tors that have the potential to significantly influence the performance of 
your stocks. Understanding the dynamics between these factors and your 
investments will allow you to make more informed decisions and better 
navigate the complexities of the stock market, ultimately helping you to 
protect and grow your portfolio.
Monitor Economic Indicators
Monitoring economic indicators is essential for investors because the per￾formance of the stock market is closely tied to the broader economic con￾ditions. A strong understanding of the economic cycle, fiscal and monetary 
policies, and other relevant indicators is crucial for evaluating the poten￾tial impact on individual companies and their profitability. Economic fac￾tors can significantly affect stock prices; for instance, during an economic 
boom, many companies tend to thrive, while in a recession, corporate prof￾its may decline, resulting in negative stock price movements. Therefore, 
keeping an eye on key economic indicators is essential for assessing the 
economic environment that your stocks are operating within.
By staying informed about economic indicators, you can make more 
informed investment decisions. Whether it is monitoring employment 
data, inflation rates, interest rates, or government policies, these factors 
have the power to influence your portfolio’s performance. By analyzing 
the economic landscape, you can better position your investments and 
be prepared to adjust your strategies in response to changes in the eco￾nomic environment, ultimately helping you navigate the stock market 
more effectively.
Monitor Political Events
Political events can significantly influence the stock market, often driven 
by the market’s aversion to uncertainty. When there is a crisis or political 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 244 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 245
event with an unclear outcome, investors become cautious and prefer to 
stay on the sidelines. This hesitancy results in an absence or shortage of 
buyers, which can lead to market declines. As an informed investor, it is 
vital to monitor major political events closely and analyze their potential 
consequences for the economy and the stock market.
By keeping tabs on political developments and their potential impact 
on the economy, you can better prepare for different market scenarios 
and adjust your investment strategies accordingly. It is essential to under￾stand how these external factors can create uncertainty and affect investor 
sentiment, as this knowledge will help you make more informed decisions 
in the ever-changing landscape of the stock market.
Learn How to Navigate Markets in Times of Uncertainty
Political and economic uncertainty can significantly impact the stock 
market. Wall Street generally dislikes uncertainty, and when political 
or economic crises create ambiguity, it tends to trigger poor stock mar￾ket performance. While these impacts are typically transitory, and the 
underlying profitability of companies remains the ultimate driver of stock 
prices, investors need to grasp how such crises can sway the market and 
affect their individual stock holdings. Effective monitoring enables inves￾tors to assess how unfolding events may affect their stocks, their industry 
sectors, and industry groups. This knowledge empowers investors to make 
well-informed investment decisions and adapt their strategies based on 
the prevailing conditions.
Political and economic uncertainties introduce an element of risk 
and unpredictability into the stock market. When major events or crises 
create an atmosphere of uncertainty, investors often prefer to take a cau￾tious approach and adopt a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the market 
can experience a decline in buyer interest, leading to market downturns. 
While these effects are usually temporary, they underscore the impor￾tance of monitoring political and economic developments closely. By 
keeping a watchful eye on such events and understanding their potential 
implications for stocks, investors can better navigate the uncertainties and 
make strategic decisions that align with the prevailing political and eco￾nomic conditions.
Check If Money Inflow Is Rising
Monitoring the flow of money into the stock market through mutual 
funds is a critical aspect of understanding market dynamics. The influx 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 245 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM246 • Navigating the Stock Market
of new funds into the market can be a powerful driver of stock demand, 
potentially boosting stock prices. When investors channel more capital 
into stock funds, it signals positive sentiment and a preference for equi￾ties, which can have a favorable impact on stock prices. Conversely, if 
there is a substantial outflow of money due to investors redeeming their 
investments, it can lead to reduced demand for stocks and adversely affect 
stock prices. The timing of these flows is also significant, with January his￾torically witnessing a surge in inflows, contributing to the market’s robust 
performance during that month. Therefore, as an investor, monitoring 
money flows into stock funds is a crucial practice for assessing overall 
market sentiment and potential trends. This data can be obtained from 
various online investment websites.
Additionally, it is important to consider how the direction of money 
flows can provide insights into investor behavior and confidence. Increased 
inflows often signify a positive outlook for the market, while outflows may 
indicate apprehension or a desire to reallocate investments. As such, 
staying informed about these trends can assist investors in making more 
informed decisions and adapting their strategies based on the prevailing 
market conditions. This monitoring should be an integral part of an inves￾tor’s routine, alongside other fundamental and technical analyses, to gain 
a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics.
Analyze Risk Due to Currency Fluctuations
Profits of a US company with foreign operations can be significantly influ￾enced by currency fluctuations. These fluctuations stem from the vary￾ing exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies, which 
affect the translation of foreign revenues into US dollars. Depending on 
the timing of currency conversion, a company may see its revenue appear 
higher or lower when reported in US dollars. Such fluctuations can have 
a direct and immediate impact on a company’s profitability, as they affect 
the bottom-line results reported to shareholders and investors.
For investors evaluating a company, it is essential to take into account 
the geographical spread of the company’s operations and the level of cur￾rency risk it is exposed to. The extent of this risk can vary significantly 
depending on the countries in which the company conducts business. 
For instance, if a company has a substantial portion of its operations in a 
country with a volatile currency, like the Russian ruble, this may be seen 
as a significant risk factor due to the potential impact on its profits when 
converting revenues back into US dollars. Therefore, in-depth scrutiny 
of a company’s international exposure and currency risk is a crucial part 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 246 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 247
of fundamental analysis, allowing investors to make more informed deci￾sions and manage their portfolios effectively.
MONITORING INTEREST RATES AND THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE
Interest rates are among the most important external variables impacting 
the stock market. This section discusses how to monitor them, as well as 
the role and impact of the Federal Reserve on interest rates.
Monitor Interest Rate Trends
Monitoring and understanding interest rate trends are essential for inves￾tors as it directly impacts the profitability of companies. Many businesses 
rely on borrowing capital to fund their operations and expansion, making 
interest payments a significant part of their expenses. When interest rates 
decline, the cost of borrowing money decreases which, in turn, increases 
a company’s profits. This boost in profitability often leads to higher stock 
prices as investors are more inclined to invest in companies with improv￾ing financial performance. Conversely, when interest rates rise, borrow￾ing costs increase, potentially squeezing profit margins, and consequently 
leading to lower stock prices.
To be a successful investor, you should closely monitor interest 
rates and their trends to assess the potential impact on the financial 
performance of companies and the overall stock market. Understanding 
the relationship between interest rates and stock prices is crucial for 
making well-informed investment decisions and being prepared for 
market shifts driven by changes in borrowing costs. By doing so, you can 
position your portfolio to take advantage of market conditions related to 
interest rate trends and react accordingly to maximize your investment 
returns.
Learn How to Forecast Interest Rates
To forecast interest rates, investors can monitor the Dow Jones Utility 
Index, representing the performance of utility companies. Utilities heav￾ily depend on borrowing for operations, making them sensitive to inter￾est rate fluctuations. The utility index’s strength or weakness can signal 
changes in interest rates. A strong utility index often suggests upcoming 
interest rate decreases. As the bond market usually precedes interest rate 
changes, the Dow Jones Utility average reflects shifts before impacting 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 247 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM248 • Navigating the Stock Market
the broader stock market. The performance of utilities acts as a leading 
indicator for the overall market trend, providing insights into future inter￾est rates and, consequently, stock market conditions.
Closely monitoring the Dow Jones Utility Index offers investors 
valuable information on potential interest rate movements impacting 
investment decisions. Recognizing the utility index as an early predictor 
of interest rate changes helps investors position themselves effectively in 
response to market shifts, enhancing their chances of making informed 
and profitable choices.
Monitor the Federal Reserve’s Policies and Decisions
Understanding the role and impact of the Federal Reserve is crucial for 
investors, as it wields substantial influence over the stock market. The 
Federal Reserve’s key responsibilities include managing inflation and 
determining short-term interest rates. To achieve these goals, it adjusts 
interest rates based on the prevailing economic conditions. When the 
economy shows signs of slowing down or enters a recession, the Federal 
Reserve tends to lower interest rates. This move encourages businesses to 
invest and consumers to spend, ultimately leading to increased corporate 
earnings and higher stock prices. Conversely, if the economy is expand￾ing rapidly or facing inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raises 
interest rates to cool down economic activity. As a result, this tightening 
of monetary policy has the opposite effect on the economy and the stock 
market, potentially leading to a decline in stock prices.
Given the Federal Reserve’s substantial impact on the stock market, 
investors must closely monitor the central bank’s policies and decisions, 
as they can significantly influence market conditions. By staying informed 
about Federal Reserve actions and their potential effects on interest 
rates and the economy, investors can make more informed investment 
decisions and better position themselves in response to changing market 
dynamics.
Monitor Federal Reserve Meetings
Monitoring Federal Reserve meetings and their outcomes is essential for 
investors as it provides critical insights into the central bank’s monetary 
policy decisions. The FOMC plays a pivotal role in controlling interest 
rates, specifically the discount rate and the federal funds rate. The dis￾count rate is the interest rate at which member banks can borrow funds 
directly from the Federal Reserve. Alternatively, the federal funds rate 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 248 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 249
represents the interest rate at which banks lend money to one another 
to meet their reserve requirements. The FOMC convenes approximately 
every six weeks to deliberate on monetary policy and interest rates. When 
it makes decisions regarding changes in the discount rate or the federal 
funds rate, they are conveyed through a statement that it issues.
Investors pay close attention to FOMC meetings and the result￾ing statements because they can profoundly impact financial markets. 
Changes in interest rates can influence borrowing costs for businesses and 
consumers, affecting investment decisions and spending patterns, which 
in turn have repercussions on corporate earnings and stock market per￾formance. Thus, staying informed about the outcomes of these meetings 
is a fundamental aspect of monitoring the financial landscape and making 
well-informed investment decisions.
Monitor Federal Reserve Actions and Hints
Monitoring the Federal Reserve’s policies, actions, and statements is cru￾cial for investors seeking to gain insights into the central bank’s stance 
and its potential impacts on the stock market. The Federal Reserve holds 
significant sway over the economy and financial markets due to its control 
over interest rates. A primary focus for investors is to ascertain whether 
the Federal Reserve is in an easing (bullish) or tightening (bearish) mode. 
Easing refers to a policy stance where the central bank lowers interest 
rates to stimulate economic growth, which can be favorable for the stock 
market. In contrast, tightening involves raising interest rates to curb infla￾tion, which can be seen as a bearish signal for stocks as it increases bor￾rowing costs for businesses and consumers.
To stay well-informed, investors should closely monitor the outcomes 
of FOMC meetings, particularly their statements. The content of these 
statements often holds critical information about the central bank’s con￾cerns and priorities. This information can be even more revealing than 
the decisions regarding interest rates. The statements may signal con￾cerns about inflation threats, economic weakness, or other issues, and the 
market’s interpretation of these concerns can significantly impact stock 
prices. Therefore, understanding and interpreting these statements are 
essential for stock market investors.
Monitor How the Federal Reserve’s Tools Are Being Deployed
Observing how the Federal Reserve deploys its monetary policy tools pro￾vides valuable insights into its intentions and can help investors gauge 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 249 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM250 • Navigating the Stock Market
the market’s potential direction. The Federal Reserve wields three crucial 
tools to enact its policies and influence interest rates, inflation, and the 
broader economy. These tools are the discount rate, the federal funds rate, 
and the level of reserve requirements imposed on member banks. Among 
these, the discount rate holds significant power, and its adjustments can 
have substantial impacts on the economy and financial markets. When the 
Federal Reserve lowers the discount rate, it typically aims to stimulate 
economic growth by making it more attractive for banks to borrow from 
the central bank. This can result in lower interest rates in the broader 
financial system, making it more affordable for businesses and consumers 
to borrow, ultimately fostering economic expansion. Observing changes 
in the discount rate and its impact on borrowing costs is, therefore, an 
essential task for investors seeking to understand the Federal Reserve’s 
economic stance and its effects on stock market trends.
Understanding the role and significance of each of these tools is piv￾otal for investors. By closely following the Federal Reserve’s utilization 
of these tools, investors can interpret the central bank’s policy direction 
and its implications for the stock market. The Federal Reserve’s decisions 
regarding interest rates and reserve requirements are key determinants 
of market conditions, so tracking their deployment helps investors align 
their strategies accordingly.
Monitor Real Interest Rates
Real interest rates, as distinguished from nominal interest rates, hold 
vital significance for investors and economists. They represent the actual 
return or cost of borrowing after accounting for inflation in the economy. 
Investors closely monitor real interest rates to understand the true impact 
of monetary policy and economic conditions on borrowing and lending. 
This interest rate is determined by the difference between the nominal 
interest rate, such as the federal funds rate set by the central bank, and the 
prevailing inflation rate. For instance, if the federal funds rate stands at 
5% and inflation is at 3%, the real interest rate would be 2%. This implies 
that lenders or investors are earning a real return of 2% after adjusting for 
the eroding effects of inflation. In cases where inflation is lower, say 2%, 
the real interest rate would increase to 3%, indicating a more significant 
interest rate return in real terms. Therefore, understanding real interest 
rates is essential as it provides insights into the actual return on invest￾ment or cost of borrowing when considering the impact of inflation.
Monitoring real interest rates is particularly valuable for investors 
seeking to evaluate the attractiveness of various investment options. Real 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 250 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 251
interest rates reflect the true value of investing in different assets, helping 
investors make informed decisions about the allocation of their funds. 
When real interest rates rise, it signifies a more favorable climate for sav￾ing and investing, as it means that the returns on investment are greater 
than the rate of inflation. Conversely, when real interest rates decline, it 
suggests a less attractive environment for saving, investing, and borrow￾ing. Investors pay close attention to fluctuations in real interest rates as 
they can significantly influence investment strategies and portfolio deci￾sions, impacting the performance of various assets, including stocks and 
bonds.
Monitor Bond Yields
The dynamic relationship between bond yields and stock prices is a cru￾cial factor that investors need to monitor closely. These two asset classes, 
stocks, and bonds, are in constant competition for investors’ capital. The 
interplay between interest rates and bond yields significantly influences 
the allocation of investment funds. When bond yields are high, they 
tend to attract more capital from investors looking for secure income, 
which can result in capital flowing out of the stock market. Conversely, 
when bond yields are low, stocks become more appealing as they offer 
the potential for higher returns, attracting investment dollars away from 
bonds and into equities.
Moreover, there is a correlation between bond yields and the val￾uation of the stock market, often measured by metrics such as the P/E 
ratio of the S&P 500. When economic growth accelerates, long-term 
bond yields tend to decrease, leading to higher interest rates. In such 
a scenario, investors may shift their focus from stocks to bonds as the 
yields become more attractive. On the contrary, during economic slow￾downs, bond yields may rise as interest rates decrease, making stocks a 
more appealing investment. Understanding this relationship and moni￾toring bond yields is essential for investors to gauge the potential effects 
on stock prices.
MONITORING YOUR PERFORMANCE AND 
PORTFOLIO
This section discusses how investors should monitor the performance 
of their individual stocks as well as portfolios to ensure that they are 
performing as expected, which will ensure their success in the stock 
market.
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 251 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM252 • Navigating the Stock Market
Analyze Your Strategy
Regularly reviewing and analyzing your investment strategy is crucial for 
long-term success in the stock market. This process allows you to assess the 
effectiveness of your strategy and make necessary adjustments to improve 
your approach. It is essential to have a flexible and adaptive mindset, as 
market conditions and your financial goals can change over time.
When conducting a strategy analysis, consider various factors such 
as your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Reflect on the 
performance of your portfolio and whether it aligns with your objectives. 
Determine if your strategy is still relevant given the current economic and 
market conditions. Major paradigm shifts can occur in the financial land￾scape, and you should be prepared to adapt when necessary. Notably, it is 
important to avoid making drastic changes based on short-term mistakes 
or market fluctuations. Instead, evaluate your strategy’s performance over 
a reasonable time frame to make well-informed decisions about potential 
modifications. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between flexibility 
and consistency in your investment strategy.
Test and Evaluate Your Own Decisions 
As an independent investor, it is important to recognize that making mis￾takes is a natural part of the learning process. No one can be right all the 
time in the stock market. In fact, some of the most successful investors 
have experienced their fair share of failures along the way. What distin￾guishes them is their ability to learn from those mistakes and adapt their 
approach.
Regularly evaluate your investment decisions, both the successful 
ones and the errors. Identify the factors that led to each outcome and use 
this analysis to refine your strategy and techniques. This self-assessment 
will help you understand your strengths and weaknesses as an investor, 
allowing you to make more informed and effective decisions in the future. 
It is crucial to maintain a steady mindset and view your mistakes as valua￾ble learning opportunities on your path to becoming a successful investor. 
Remember the fundamental rule in investing: cut your losses and let your 
profits run. A few significant winning investments can more than compen￾sate for smaller losses if you follow this principle.
Analyze Your Trades
Regularly analyzing your trades is a critical aspect of improving as 
an investor. It allows you to gain insights into your decision-making 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 252 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AMMiscellaneous Tips • 253
process and refine your approach. When reviewing your trades, focus on 
understanding what went well and what didn’t. Examine your buying and 
selling decisions to identify what factors influenced your choices. Did you 
correctly assess the stock’s potential? Were you too hasty or too slow to 
act? By analyzing your trades, you can pinpoint the moments when you 
made sound decisions and those moments when you faltered.
Furthermore, scrutinize your monitoring activities. Were there sig￾nals or indicators that you overlooked or misjudged? Identifying these 
missed opportunities can help you fine-tune your strategy to avoid repeat￾ing the same mistakes in the future. Remember that mistakes are a natu￾ral part of investing, but it is crucial to learn from them and not let them 
become recurring issues. Consistent self-analysis and improvement will 
lead to more informed and profitable decisions over time.
Evaluate Each Stock’s Performance
When assessing the performance of individual stocks over time, it is 
imperative to define a specific time frame aligning with your investment 
objectives. The appropriate duration for evaluating stock performance 
may differ depending on factors like the company’s nature and industry. 
Typically, allowing a stock six to eighteen months to meet your investment 
goals is considered reasonable, and maintaining flexibility within this time 
frame is crucial. The decision to hold or sell should hinge on a thorough 
examination of the stock’s fundamentals and its performance concerning 
your initial expectations.
Flexibility becomes paramount as market conditions and company 
dynamics evolve. If a stock demonstrates solid fundamentals and exhibits 
positive trends relative to your expectations, holding onto it may be pru￾dent, even if the initially set time frame has not fully elapsed. Contrastingly, 
if the stock underperforms or if there are shifts in the market or indus￾try landscape that adversely impact its prospects, being flexible allows for 
timely adjustments to your investment strategy. The ability to adapt your 
approach based on ongoing evaluations is key to optimizing investment 
outcomes over time.
Periodically Evaluate Your Portfolio
Regularly evaluating your portfolio is an essential part of effective invest￾ment management. This periodic review allows you to assess various ele￾ments of your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment objectives. 
One critical aspect to consider is asset allocation, which involves analyzing 
NSM_CH15_3pp.indd 253 2/14/2024 11:41:58 AM254 • Navigating the Stock Market
how your assets are distributed among different types of investments, such 
as stocks, bonds, and cash. Rebalancing your portfolio may be necessary 
to maintain your desired level of risk and return. Another key component 
to review is the allocation among different industries and groups within 
your portfolio. This analysis helps you understand if your investments are 
well diversified and not overly concentrated in a single sector.
It is also essential to assess the risk associated with the individual 
stocks in your portfolio and make buy, sell, or hold decisions based on 
their performance. Finally, you should evaluate your portfolio’s overall 
performance compared to relevant benchmarks, such as industry group 
averages or market indexes. This comparison can provide insights into 
whether your portfolio is meeting your financial goals and expectations. 
Periodic portfolio evaluations give you the opportunity to identify under￾performing assets (laggards) that may need to be replaced with new invest￾ments to improve the overall performance and health of your portfolio.
Select an Appropriate Benchmark
Comparing your portfolio’s performance to a relevant benchmark is a cru￾cial step in assessing its success. Choosing an appropriate benchmark is 
important as it allows you to gauge how well your investments are doing 
relative to a comparable group of assets. For example, if your portfolio 
primarily consists of technology stocks, it would make sense to compare 
its performance to a technology sector index, like the NASDAQ. By doing 
so, you can see if your portfolio is outperforming or underperforming its 
peers in the same sector.
Consistently underperforming the chosen benchmark should be a 
cause for concern, as it may indicate that your current investment strat￾egy and techniques are not yielding the expected results. This can serve 
as a signal to reevaluate your approach and consider potential adjustments 
to your portfolio, such as revising your asset allocation, rethinking your 
stock selection criteria, or fine-tuning your risk management strategy. 
Regularly assessing your portfolio’s performance relative to a benchmark 
helps ensure that your investments align with your financial goals and 
objectives.

APPROACH AND STRATEGY
The numerous mistakes that investors make span many areas and 
functions. This section discusses the common mistakes pertaining to their 
investing approach and strategy.
Do Not Delay Investing in the Market
Delaying your entry into the stock market can have significant conse￾quences on your financial goals, especially when it comes to saving for 
retirement. Starting early allows your investments more time to grow, 
benefiting from the power of compounding. For every year you delay 
investing, the monthly amount you will need to set aside for your retire￾ment or other financial objectives will increase. This means that if you 
procrastinate, you will have to allocate a much larger portion of your 
income to reach the same retirement income target as someone who 
started investing earlier.
In addition to requiring a higher monthly investment to catch up, the 
need for a higher return on your investments also increases the level of 
risk. Seeking higher returns often means taking on riskier investments, 
which can lead to greater volatility and the potential for significant losses. 
By starting your investment journey early, you can build a diversified and 
balanced portfolio that offers long-term growth potential while minimiz￾ing unnecessary risks. This not only sets you on a more secure path toward 
achieving your financial goals but also allows you to weather market fluc￾tuations with a longer time horizon for recovery.
Common Mistakes to Avoid
16
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 255 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AM256 • Navigating the Stock Market
Do Not Be a Follower
In the world of investing, being an independent thinker is a valuable trait 
that can set you apart from the crowd and lead to more successful out￾comes. By not simply following the herd and making decisions based on 
your own thorough analysis and understanding of the market, you can 
increase your chances of achieving your investment goals. It is impor￾tant to recognize that market sentiment can often swing from extreme 
pessimism to euphoria, and following the crowd during these emotional 
fluctuations can lead to poor investment decisions. Instead, making 
well-informed choices based on your own research can help you avoid 
buying stocks at peak prices and panic-selling during downturns.
One common pitfall is becoming enamored with stock picks pro￾moted by TV commentators or investment advisors. While their insights 
can be valuable, they should be just one part of your decision-making 
process. By seeking out undiscovered opportunities and making inde￾pendent investment decisions, you can identify assets that may have been 
overlooked by Wall Street. It is also essential to maintain an awareness of 
the overall market trend to ensure that your investments align with the 
broader economic conditions. This balanced approach allows you to lever￾age your independent thinking while staying attuned to market dynamics.
Do Not Invest Without Discipline
Investing without discipline can lead to emotional decision-making and 
erratic trading behaviors. To be a successful investor, it is crucial to have a 
well-defined plan and strategy and then adhere to them with unwavering 
discipline. Your strategy should be well-thought-out and aligned with your 
long-term objectives, allowing you to make decisions based on rational 
analysis rather than short-term fluctuations. It is natural to encounter 
occasional setbacks or periods of underperformance, but it is essential 
not to deviate from your plan too hastily in response to these challenges. 
Instead, give your strategy time to work and evaluate its effectiveness 
periodically.
Discipline also entails following your predetermined rules without 
exceptions. If your strategy includes selling rules, it is crucial to imple￾ment them when they are triggered, even if it is emotionally difficult to 
part with a stock that is not performing as expected. Deviating from your 
rules based on temporary sentiment or market noise can lead to poor 
outcomes. Discipline is a fundamental component of successful invest￾ing, as it ensures that your decisions are based on rational analysis and 
not swayed by emotional reactions or short-term market fluctuations. By 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 256 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 257
sticking to your well-defined plan, you are better equipped to navigate 
the complexities of the stock market and achieve your long-term financial 
goals.
Do Not Be a Casual Investor
Being a casual investor is not conducive to success in the stock market. It 
is a place that requires a serious and dedicated approach, involving con￾sistent study, research, and monitoring. Merely checking daily stock prices 
is not enough; it is only a surface-level observation. To make informed 
decisions, you need to dive deeper into the factors that drive a stock’s 
behavior and understand the “why” behind price movements. This means 
conducting thorough research and monitoring.
For each stock you own, you should establish a routine of regularly 
monitoring developments and news related to the company. These exter￾nal factors have the potential to influence a company’s business prospects 
and fundamentals, which in turn impact the stock price. By staying vig￾ilant and informed, you can make more proactive and informed invest￾ment decisions, minimizing the risks associated with a casual approach. 
Remember that in the stock market, dedication to research and vigilance 
in monitoring are essential for long-term success.
Do Not Invest Without a Strategy
Investing without a well-defined strategy is akin to navigating uncharted 
waters without a compass. It is crucial to take the time to review and eval￾uate different investment strategies and choose the one that aligns with 
your unique investment profile, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Each 
strategy has its own set of principles and approaches, such as value invest￾ing for conservative investors or momentum investing for those seeking 
higher risk and returns. Selecting the strategy that best suits your prefer￾ences is the first step in setting the foundation for a successful investment 
journey.
Once you have chosen your strategy, it is essential to stick with it for 
a reasonable period and let it work. Consistency is key when it comes to 
investing, and constantly changing strategies based on short-term results 
can lead to suboptimal outcomes. It is only after giving a strategy a fair 
chance that you should consider modifying it or exploring alternatives if 
the results do not align with your objectives. Having a clear investment 
strategy and adhering to it is the cornerstone of a disciplined and effective 
investment approach.
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 257 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AM258 • Navigating the Stock Market
Do Not Invest Without Rules
Investing without a well-defined set of rules is akin to embarking on a 
journey without a map or compass. These rules provide you with a struc￾tured and methodical approach to navigate the complexities of the stock 
market. Having a clear set of rules for buying and selling stocks is espe￾cially important because it helps you remain disciplined and avoid emo￾tional decision-making. Emotions, such as fear and greed, can cloud your 
judgment and lead to impulsive and often detrimental choices.
For example, if you have a predefined rule that dictates selling a stock 
if it declines by a certain percentage, say 10%, you are less likely to let 
emotions drive your decisions. This rule acts as a safeguard, ensuring that 
you make rational choices based on predetermined criteria. It can protect 
you from experiencing significant losses that might occur if you allow your 
emotions to take over. These rules are a crucial part of your investment 
strategy and serve as a guiding framework to keep you on track toward 
your financial goals.
Do Not Invest Without a Selection Criterion
Investing without a well-defined set of stock selection criteria is like 
attempting to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded. You risk 
exposing yourself to a higher level of risk and making haphazard invest￾ment decisions that may not align with your financial goals. Sound and 
systematic stock selection criteria are essential to guide your investment 
choices and ensure they are in line with proven investment principles.
Your selection criteria should be based on indicators and methods 
that have demonstrated their effectiveness in identifying potential win￾ners while weeding out underperforming stocks. For instance, incorpo￾rating indicators like earnings growth rate in your screening process is a 
smart move. Equally important is using the right values for these crite￾ria. By setting reasonably high figures for your screening indicators, you 
increase the likelihood of selecting high-growth companies that have a 
better chance of delivering favorable returns. Developing and adhering to 
well-defined selection criteria can significantly enhance your stock-picking 
process and help you build a more robust and diversified investment 
portfolio.
Do Not Buy Before Performing Fundamental Analysis
Investing in stocks based solely on intuition or external recommendations 
is akin to navigating through a dense forest without a map, as it is risky and 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 258 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 259
unpredictable. While the allure of quick gains or hot tips can be tempting, 
investing without conducting thorough fundamental analysis is a recipe 
for potential financial disaster. Fundamental analysis is a cornerstone of 
prudent investing and serves as a critical tool for evaluating the long-term 
prospects of a company.
Performing fundamental analysis involves delving deep into a com￾pany’s financial health, examining its financial statements, assessing key 
performance indicators, and understanding its competitive position 
within the industry. By doing so, investors can make informed decisions 
and determine whether a stock aligns with their investment goals and 
risk tolerance. Before you invest in any stock, it is imperative to conduct 
comprehensive fundamental analysis to gain a clear understanding of the 
company’s financial health, growth potential, and overall stability. This 
approach not only reduces the level of risk you expose yourself to but 
also enhances the probability of making sound, well-informed investment 
decisions.
Do Not Ignore a Stock’s Sector or Industry Group
In the stock market, correlation within sectors and industry groups can 
have a significant impact on individual stock performance. Understanding 
this interconnectedness is crucial for investors. Stocks are not isolated 
entities but are part of a larger ecosystem where industry trends and sec￾tor performance play a pivotal role in their success or failure. Ignoring 
the influence of a stock’s sector or industry group can be a costly mistake.
When you invest, you must assess not only the individual stock’s finan￾cial health and prospects but also consider the broader context in which it 
operates. This means taking a close look at the performance and outlook 
of its industry and sector. A company may have strong fundamentals and 
be well-managed, but if its industry is facing challenges or in a decline, 
it can be dragged down along with the rest of the sector. A company in a 
healthy and growing industry might benefit even if its own fundamentals 
are not as strong. By evaluating a stock within the framework of its sector 
and industry group, you can make more informed investment decisions, 
anticipate trends, and position yourself strategically in the market.
TIMING
Stocks should be bought after thorough evaluation of their fundamentals. 
However, after a decision has been made, additional factors should be 
considered from a timing perspective, which are discussed in this section.
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 259 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AM260 • Navigating the Stock Market
Do Not Wait for the Perfect Scenario
It is common for some investors to fall into the trap of waiting for the 
“perfect” scenario before making any investment decisions. They want 
to minimize every possible risk and uncertainty, which leads to a pro￾longed state of inaction. The quest for a flawless set of circumstances 
is essentially a futile one in the dynamic and unpredictable world of 
stock market investing. The perfect alignment of market conditions, 
individual stock prospects, and economic factors is more of a fantasy 
than a reality.
Recognizing that the ideal scenario will never manifest, it is crucial 
to understand that all investment decisions entail a degree of ambigu￾ity and imperfection. It is the ability to make informed decisions under 
less-than-ideal conditions that sets successful investors apart. Waiting 
endlessly for the perfect moment can result in missed opportunities and 
capital that remains uninvested. Investors should learn to embrace a level 
of calculated risk and uncertainty while maintaining a strategic and well￾researched approach to stock market investing. In essence, the key is to 
act with prudence and adaptability, not inactivity based on the elusive goal 
of perfection.
Do Not Try to Time the Market
Attempting to time the market is a challenging and often futile endeavor 
that investors should avoid. While some investors may achieve short￾term success with market-timing strategies, it is exceptionally challenging 
to consistently time the market with a high degree of accuracy. Market 
dynamics are influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which can be 
unpredictable, and they change over time. A timing strategy that works 
effectively under specific market conditions may not perform as expected 
when market dynamics shift, which they inevitably do in the dynamic 
world of stock market investing.
Market timing based on perceived market “highs” and “lows” is a 
strategy fraught with risk and uncertainty. It is common for investors who 
engage in market-timing to fall into the trap of buying at market peaks 
and selling at market troughs, often resulting in poor returns. Instead 
of attempting to time the market, a more prudent approach is to focus 
on long-term investing, portfolio diversification, and sound fundamental 
analysis. These strategies are likely to lead to more consistent and success￾ful outcomes over time, without the anxiety and pitfalls associated with 
market-timing efforts.

Do Not Avoid Averaging Up
Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy that can be employed in two directions, 
averaging up or down. While many investors are comfortable with aver￾aging down, where they acquire more shares of a stock when its price 
declines, they are often reluctant to average up. The common belief is that 
a stock that has already appreciated is less likely to continue its upward 
trajectory, leading investors to wait for a price decline. This approach may 
cause investors to miss out on the potential for further gains in strong￾performing stocks. Instead of dwelling on where the stock has been 
historically, it is essential to focus on its future potential. If sound funda￾mental analysis and market conditions support the belief that the stock is 
likely to continue rising, it may be a good decision to average up when the 
opportunity arises.
Averaging up should not be ruled out simply because a stock’s price 
has already appreciated. Rather, investors should assess the stock’s future 
growth prospects and investment potential. If the fundamentals remain 
strong and there’s a reasonable expectation of continued growth, averaging 
up can be a strategic move that maximizes returns, allowing investors to 
capture further gains and participate in the success of a high-performing 
stock. This approach highlights the importance of making investment 
decisions based on a stock’s potential for future price appreciation, rather 
than dwelling solely on past performance.
Do Not Ignore the Market’s Seasonal Factors
The stock market, like many aspects of the economy and individual com￾panies, is influenced by seasonal factors that can have a significant impact 
on investment decisions. Recognizing these seasonal patterns is essen￾tial for investors. For instance, understanding that summer tends to be a 
slower season for semiconductor companies or that January historically is 
a strong month for small stocks can help investors make informed deci￾sions. In addition, it is crucial to be aware of events like window dressing 
at the end of each quarter, which can lead to increased volatility as port￾folio managers adjust their holdings. This practice can affect stock prices 
as managers sell underperforming stocks and invest in recently outper￾forming ones. Investors should take these seasonal factors into considera￾tion when managing their portfolios and be cautious about making major 
changes during strong seasonal periods.
While it is important not to overemphasize the significance of sea￾sonal factors, ignoring them can be equally detrimental. Seasonal patterns 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 261 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AM262 • Navigating the Stock Market
can offer valuable insights into potential market trends and economic 
conditions, helping investors make more informed choices about buying 
or selling stocks. By staying informed about how the market responds to 
different seasons and understanding the impact on various sectors, inves￾tors can develop more effective strategies and avoid making impulsive 
decisions based on seasonal fluctuations.
Take Advantage of Cyclical Stocks’ Movements
Cyclical stocks, which are highly sensitive to economic cycles, can offer sig￾nificant opportunities for investors who understand their movements and 
can time their investments strategically. These companies, like Caterpillar 
and International Paper, tend to thrive during economic expansions, as 
increased economic activity leads to higher earnings. On the flip side, dur￾ing economic contractions, these stocks often experience a sharp decline 
in earnings. Therefore, it is important for investors to recognize the cycli￾cal nature of these companies and adjust their portfolios accordingly.
During periods of economic slowdown or recession, investors should 
consider reducing their exposure to cyclical stocks to minimize risk. When 
the economy begins to rebound, cyclical stocks tend to outperform, mak￾ing them attractive investment opportunities. Timing is crucial when 
dealing with cyclical stocks, and astute investors can take advantage of 
their potential for growth during periods of economic expansion while 
being cautious during downturns. By carefully monitoring the economic 
cycle and the performance of cyclical stocks, investors can optimize their 
portfolios.
PSYCHOLOGY
Along with fundamentals, emotions drive the behavior of stocks. However, 
many investors make some common mistakes because they do not under￾stand the role of psychology in the stock market, which is discussed in this 
section.
Do Not Be Overawed by Wall Street Professionals
Overcoming the perception that Wall Street professionals hold an insur￾mountable advantage in the stock market is crucial for individual investors. 
While it is true that professionals have access to extensive resources and 
research tools, individual investors can still achieve success by following 
fundamental investment principles. Confidence in your own abilities and 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 262 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 263
a commitment to learning can be powerful assets in the stock market. 
Additionally, it is important to recognize that many individual investors 
have outperformed professional money managers, highlighting the poten￾tial for individual success.
Investors should focus on conducting their own research, selecting 
stocks based on thorough analysis, and approaching stock recommen￾dations from professionals with caution. While it can be informative to 
consider expert opinions, it is essential to make investment decisions 
independently, guided by your own strategy and analysis. With the right 
approach, individual investors can successfully navigate the stock market 
and achieve their financial goals without being overawed by Wall Street 
professionals.
Do Not Confuse the Company With the Stock
A critical distinction in stock market investing is understanding that a 
good company does not automatically equate to a good stock. Investors 
frequently fall into the trap of assuming that well-known, reputable com￾panies are surefire investments, regardless of the stock’s current condi￾tions. They often make the mistake of buying stocks from these companies 
based on their reputation or familiarity, disregarding the possibility that 
even a great company’s stock can underperform or decline if it’s overval￾ued or if the business prospects take a negative turn due to unpublicized 
factors.
To be a successful investor, it is essential to base your investment 
decisions on clear criteria and focus on evaluating the current and poten￾tial value of a company’s shares, rather than solely relying on its historical 
performance or brand recognition. By keeping the distinction between 
the company and the stock in mind, investors can make more informed 
decisions and avoid falling into the trap of assuming that all strong com￾panies will necessarily result in strong stock investments.
Never Get Attached to a Stock
Your primary goal as an investor is to generate profits, and it is important 
to remember that investing in stocks is not a long-term relationship; it is 
a financial transaction with the objective of achieving gains. Whether you 
hold a stock for a few months or several years, your connection with it 
should always be analytical and goal-oriented. When investing in stocks, 
you must establish clear objectives, and your decision to keep or sell a stock 
should be based on those objectives. It is crucial to approach each stock 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 263 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AM264 • Navigating the Stock Market
investment with an analytical and clinical mindset, devoid of emotional 
attachment, which can cloud your judgment and hinder your ability to 
make rational decisions.
Getting emotionally attached to a stock is a common pitfall for inves￾tors. This attachment can lead to biases, poor decision-making, and a 
reluctance to let go when it is in your best financial interest to do so. To 
succeed in stock market investing, it is vital to remain disciplined, follow 
your predetermined criteria and objectives, and not let emotions get in 
the way of making logical investment decisions.
Do Not Be Impatient
Investing in the stock market is fundamentally a long-term endeavor. The 
idea is to select strong and profitable businesses that have the potential for 
long-term growth and appreciate over a period of several years. During 
this investment horizon, it is inevitable that you will encounter challenges, 
market fluctuations, and obstacles along the way. Successful investing 
requires patience and a long-term perspective to allow your investments 
to flourish and grow. Nevertheless, many investors seek quick and imme￾diate returns, making them more reactive to short-term events. This 
impatience can lead to hasty decisions and may prevent investors from 
fully capitalizing on the wealth-building potential of the stock market. 
Therefore, it is essential to recognize that stock market investing demands 
patience, and you should only engage in it if you have the temperament 
and mindset to endure the necessary time horizon.
As an investor, it is crucial to acknowledge that the stock market, like 
any other investment, has its cycles and fluctuations. Instead of react￾ing emotionally to these short-term changes, patient investors maintain a 
long-term focus and understand that the overall growth and performance 
of their investments will outweigh short-term volatility. Being patient not 
only allows your investments to ride out market volatility but also provides 
the opportunity to benefit from the compounding effect, which can lead 
to significant wealth accumulation over time. If you do not possess the 
necessary patience for stock market investing, it is important to reevaluate 
your investment approach and possibly consider alternatives that better 
align with your financial goals and time horizon.
Do Not Get Carried Away By Stock Splits
It is essential for ordinary investors not to be overly influenced by stock 
splits. While stock splits can generate excitement, their long-term impact 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 264 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 265
on a stock’s performance remains a subject of debate. What a stock split 
essentially accomplishes is an increase in the number of shares and a 
reduction in the stock’s price, which may attract investors who prefer low￾er-priced shares. For instance, a two-for-one stock split of a $100 stock with 
four hundred shares will lead to the stock’s price being halved to $50, while 
the number of shares doubles to eight hundred. Regardless of these num￾bers, the total investment remains at $40,000. It is important to recognize 
that the true driver of a stock’s performance is its fundamental strength and 
growth prospects, not the number of shares or the stock’s price.
Investors should understand that stock splits do not fundamentally 
alter the intrinsic value or financial health of a company. The same com￾pany with the same assets, earnings, and growth potential exists both 
before and after a split. Stock splits are merely a cosmetic adjustment, 
and while they can make shares appear more accessible to some inves￾tors, they do not change the underlying economic realities of the busi￾ness. Therefore, investors should focus on the company’s fundamentals, 
its competitive position, and its growth prospects when considering an 
investment, rather than getting carried away by the superficial appeal of 
stock splits.
SPECULATION
At times, speculation drives the stock market and/or individual stocks, 
which can lead to unpredictable and unsustainable stock price action. 
However, many investors do not know how to avoid the mistakes due to 
speculation, which are discussed in this section.
Do Not Speculate
Engaging in speculation poses a considerable risk for investors, as it entails 
making bets on price movements without a solid foundation of research 
and analysis. This lack of a robust strategy can lead to substantial financial 
losses, especially when market movements don’t align with speculative 
predictions. To navigate these risks successfully, investors are advised to 
adhere to a disciplined approach rooted in fundamental analysis and long￾term investing principles. This involves carefully evaluating a company’s 
financial health, industry trends, and other relevant factors before making 
investment decisions.
Relying on speculation can be likened to gambling in the financial 
markets, introducing a high level of uncertainty and unpredictability. 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 265 2/14/2024 11:42:09 AM266 • Navigating the Stock Market
Investors seeking consistent and reasonable profits are better served by 
adopting a more strategic and informed approach. By focusing on funda￾mental analysis, which involves assessing a company’s intrinsic value and 
growth prospects, and adopting a long-term investment horizon, individ￾uals can build a more resilient and sustainable investment portfolio. This 
approach provides a solid foundation for weathering market fluctuations 
and achieving financial goals over the long run.
Do Not Buy Penny Stocks
Penny stocks are typically not a suitable choice for the majority of inves￾tors due to their inherent risks and speculative nature. High-quality stocks 
from established companies are more transparent and well-researched, 
making them a safer investment. Penny stocks often lack adequate 
research materials and information, making it challenging for investors to 
conduct thorough due diligence. This limited information can increase the 
uncertainty associated with penny stocks, making them a riskier option.
Penny stocks also tend to have lower liquidity and higher trading 
commissions as a percentage of the total buying cost, which can erode 
potential gains and increase transaction costs. These factors make them 
less attractive from a trading perspective, particularly for investors seeking 
consistent and reliable long-term returns. Therefore, for most investors, 
focusing on stocks from reputable, well-established companies with share 
prices above $20 is a more prudent and less risky approach to building a 
diversified and balanced investment portfolio.
Do Not Believe Message Boards
Online message boards can be a double-edged sword for investors, and 
it is essential to approach them with caution. While there may be a few 
valuable insights and informed discussions on these platforms, the vast 
majority of posts are often filled with misinformation, rumors, unin￾formed, and biased opinions. Message boards attract a wide range of par￾ticipants, including novices, speculators, and those with personal agendas, 
and it’s often challenging to distinguish between credible information and 
baseless claims. This can make them a less reliable source of investment 
advice and decision-making.
One common issue with message boards is that many contributors 
may have hidden agendas. Some may aim to manipulate stock prices or 
promote certain stocks for personal gain, while others may simply vent 
their frustrations or share unsubstantiated rumors. For these reasons, 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 266 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 267
investors should approach online message boards with skepticism and rely 
on thorough research and analysis from credible sources when making 
their investment decisions.
MISCELLANEOUS
There are additional common mistakes that many investors tend to make. 
These mistakes, which can impact their portfolios in a significant way and 
cause avoidable losses, are discussed in this section.
Do Not Fight the Trend
The old saying “the trend is your friend” underscores the importance 
of aligning your investment strategy with the prevailing market trend. 
Attempting to swim against the current can be a perilous endeavor in the 
stock market. It is essential to recognize that market trends are driven 
by the collective sentiment and actions of countless investors, and these 
trends often persist for extended periods. Instead of trying to predict or 
counteract these trends, prudent investors acknowledge their presence 
and seek to capitalize on them.
For instance, when you identify a strong and sustained market 
uptrend, it is generally a favorable time to invest in equities. Conversely, 
during a prolonged downtrend, it is wise to exercise caution and poten￾tially reduce your equity exposure. Being attuned to market trends and 
adjusting your investment strategy accordingly can significantly enhance 
your prospects for success in the stock market, and it aligns with the fun￾damental principle of “going with the flow” to make profitable investment 
decisions.
Never Fight the Fed
The Federal Reserve’s influence on the stock market, particularly through 
its management of short-term interest rates, is significant. As the cen￾tral bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve plays a pivotal role 
in maintaining economic stability and controlling inflation. Changes in 
short-term interest rates, particularly the federal funds rate, have a ripple 
effect throughout the financial markets and the broader economy. It is 
critical for investors to understand that the level and direction of interest 
rates can significantly impact the stock market’s performance.
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation, 
it tends to put downward pressure on stock prices, as borrowing costs 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 267 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AM268 • Navigating the Stock Market
increase for businesses and consumers. Conversely, when the Fed lowers 
interest rates to stimulate economic growth or address financial crises, 
stocks often respond positively, as lower interest rates can boost corpo￾rate profits and investor sentiment. Investors who closely monitor the 
Federal Reserve’s policies and the associated interest rate trends are bet￾ter equipped to position their portfolios in alignment with these influen￾tial market dynamics, allowing them to make more informed investment 
decisions that complement, rather than oppose, the Fed’s actions.
Do Not Focus on the Number of Shares
Focusing solely on the number of shares rather than the dollar amount 
invested is a common psychological bias that investors should be aware 
of and overcome. When investors favor low-priced, cheap stocks with 
the aim of acquiring more shares or round lots (usually in multiples of 
100 shares), they often overlook the more important aspect of investment: 
the potential return on their capital. The reality is that the percentage 
price appreciation or depreciation of a stock is not determined by the 
number of shares one owns, but rather by the performance of the stock 
based on the total amount invested.
Investors should think in terms of the dollar amount they are com￾mitting to a particular investment. In essence, the goal is not to maxi￾mize the number of shares but to optimize the return on investment. 
A high-priced quality stock may have a higher potential for growth, and 
by focusing on the dollar amount invested, investors can benefit from the 
capital appreciation of such stocks, which could result in substantial gains. 
Instead of chasing cheap stocks with lower prices, investors should prior￾itize the quality of the investment and the potential for positive returns 
on their capital. By considering the dollar amount and the quality of the 
investment, investors can position themselves to capture opportunities for 
significant growth and financial success.
Do Not Use Flawed Logic
Investors often use flawed logic when justifying their decisions to buy 
beaten-down stocks that have declined into the single-digit price range. 
Two common points are frequently cited in defense of this approach. 
First, they assert that the stock has hit its bottom, suggesting that it is an 
opportune time to buy. With that said, it’s important to remember that 
determining the precise bottom of a stock is highly uncertain, and it is 
only truly known when a stock reaches a value of zero, which may not be 
the case for every struggling company. Second, they make the claim that 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 268 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 269
buying a $5 stock limits their potential loss to a maximum of $5, implying 
a small risk. A more accurate perspective considers such a decline as a 
100% loss rather than a minor one, as the initial investment has been 
entirely eroded.
It is crucial for investors to avoid such flawed logic and take a more 
rational approach when evaluating investment opportunities. Rather 
than relying on uncertain bottom-picking strategies, it is advisable to 
conduct thorough research and analysis to assess whether a stock repre￾sents a sound investment with the potential for positive returns. Making 
investment decisions based on solid fundamentals, future prospects, and 
risk management strategies will lead to more informed and responsible 
choices, ultimately enhancing the potential for long-term success in the 
stock market.
Do Not Make Dividends the Primary Objective
Investors should not become overly fixated on dividends as the primary 
objective in stock investing. The key focus should be on achieving price 
appreciation, rather than solely seeking a high yield. While dividends can 
provide a steady income stream, it is crucial to avoid buying a stock solely 
because it pays dividends. It is important to recognize that, while you may 
receive dividend payments, a struggling stock may potentially experience 
a significant decline, in percentage terms, that outweighs the dividend 
income. In this context, a 5% dividend yield cannot adequately compen￾sate for a 10% price decline.
Furthermore, investors should be cautious of stocks with cloudy 
future prospects, even if they provide a consistent dividend. The risk of 
dividend reduction or elimination should not be ignored. Sound invest￾ment decisions should prioritize a thorough assessment of a stock’s overall 
health and future potential, rather than being solely influenced by divi￾dend income. In the end, price appreciation and the overall performance 
of the stock remain the primary objectives for successful investing.
Do Not Favor Timing Over Selection
In the realm of stock market activities, one must make a fundamental 
choice between adopting an investor’s perspective or embracing the role 
of a trader. For the majority of individuals seeking to build wealth through 
the stock market, the path to success is rooted in long-term investing, 
where the focus is on acquiring and holding investments over an extended 
period. Long-term investors prioritize the process of selection, as it plays 
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 269 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AM270 • Navigating the Stock Market
a pivotal role in determining the quality of their portfolio. The key is to 
identify and acquire high-quality assets with the potential for long-term 
growth.
Alternately, traders operate with a distinct mindset and a shorter 
investment horizon. Their approach places greater emphasis on timing, 
as quick and strategic entry and exit points are crucial for short-term trad￾ing success. Timing is a paramount concern for traders, who need to be 
precise in their execution to maximize profits within their defined time 
frame. Therefore, it is important to recognize that the approach to timing 
and selection varies based on whether one assumes the role of an investor 
or a trader, and this choice will significantly impact the investment strat￾egy employed.
Do Not Let the Spread Eat Into Your Profits
Understanding and managing the spread, the difference between the bid 
and ask prices for a stock, is crucial for any investor or trader. Spreads can 
vary significantly among different stocks and are especially pronounced 
for small-capitalized and thinly traded companies. These large spreads 
can negatively impact the stock’s overall price, liquidity, and trading pat￾tern. It is essential for both buyers and sellers, particularly for traders who 
seek to capitalize on short-term price movements, to take into considera￾tion the spread and its potential impact on their profits.
To mitigate the effect of a large spread on your trades, one strategy is 
to use limit orders rather than market orders. A limit order allows you to 
specify the price at which you are willing to buy or sell a stock, ensuring 
you get the desired price if the order is executed. While this approach can 
help you secure a better price, it may reduce the likelihood of your order 
being filled. It is a valuable tool for investors who want to be more precise 
in their trading and avoid having the spread eat into their profits.
Do Not Be Over Leveraged
Leveraging stocks by using them as collateral with a broker to magnify 
potential gains can be tempting for investors looking to amplify their 
returns. While this strategy can indeed double profits if the stock price 
rises, it is essential to be aware of the significant risks involved. One of 
the  key drawbacks of leveraging is that it can lead to amplified losses 
in  the event the stock price declines. This downside is especially rele￾vant in a volatile market where price fluctuations can be substantial.
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 270 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AMCommon Mistakes to Avoid • 271
Furthermore, when an investor uses margin to leverage their invest￾ments, they are essentially borrowing money from the broker. This bor￾rowed capital incurs interest, which can erode the potential gains or 
exacerbate the losses. Additionally, brokers can issue margin calls dur￾ing a down market, demanding that the investor deposit more capital to 
cover potential losses or face the liquidation of their positions. For most 
investors, especially those looking for a relatively lower level of risk, it Is 
advisable to avoid using margin and remain cautious of overleveraging, as 
it can significantly increase the risk in the stock market.
NSM_CH16_3pp.indd 271 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AMNSM_CH16_3pp.indd 272 2/14/2024 11:42:10 AMCHAPTER
RISKS
Investors should be aware that mistakes in the stock market, which 
are discussed in this section, can pose significant risks to their financial 
portfolios.
Be Aware of Risks Facing Stocks
Stock market investing carries a variety of risks that can affect investments 
in different ways. Understanding and assessing these risks is a crucial part 
of formulating a sound investment strategy. The various sources of risk 
in the stock market include market risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, 
business risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, and specific risks.
Market risk, also known as systematic risk, stems from broad eco￾nomic and market conditions and can impact the entire market or a par￾ticular sector. Investors need to consider how their investments will fare 
in various market scenarios, including bull markets and bear markets. 
Inflation risk pertains to the erosion of the purchasing power of money 
over time due to rising prices. Investments that fail to keep pace with 
inflation may not provide real returns for investors. Interest rate risk 
arises from changes in interest rates, which can affect bond and inter￾est-sensitive stocks.
Business risk is associated with a company’s internal operations and 
industry-specific factors, such as competition and regulatory changes. 
Liquidity risk relates to an investor’s ability to buy or sell assets in the 
market without significantly affecting the asset’s price. Currency risk is 
prevalent in international investing and can result from fluctuations in 
Risk Management

NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 273 1/27/2024 11:15:32 AM274 • Navigating the Stock Market
exchange rates. Specific risks are unique to individual stocks and can 
include events such as management changes, product recalls, or legal 
issues. Understanding and managing these risks is essential for making 
informed investment decisions.
Determine Your Risk Tolerance
Evaluating your risk tolerance is a fundamental step in the investment 
process. It involves a careful examination of your financial situation, 
investment goals, and psychological disposition toward risk. Your risk tol￾erance is influenced by factors such as your age, financial resources, invest￾ment time horizon, and personal comfort with market volatility. Younger 
investors with a longer investment horizon may typically have a higher 
risk tolerance, as they have more time to recover from potential losses. 
Conversely, older investors nearing retirement may have a lower risk tol￾erance as they prioritize capital preservation and income generation.
To determine your risk tolerance, you should consider your financial 
objectives, including your desired rate of return and acceptable level of 
risk. For example, if you have a specific goal of achieving a 10% annu￾alized return and are comfortable with the associated level of risk, you 
can select investments that align with this objective. It is essential to be 
realistic about your tolerance for potential losses and select investments 
that align with your long-term financial goals while also ensuring that you 
can sleep well at night without excessive worry about market fluctuations. 
By defining your risk tolerance, you can create an investment strategy that 
matches your personal and financial objectives.
Market Risk
Market risk, often referred to as systematic risk, is a fundamental consid￾eration when investing in stocks. The broader market’s behavior can signif￾icantly impact individual stocks, and this risk can manifest in various ways. 
During market corrections or bear markets, the risk to stocks, even those 
with strong fundamentals, increases substantially. In such conditions, 
the sentiment of market participants, macroeconomic factors, and global 
events can overshadow a company’s performance. As a result, even the 
best-performing stocks can suffer substantial declines in a bearish market 
environment. It is crucial to recognize that no stock is entirely immune to 
the market’s influence, making it essential for investors to closely monitor 
market conditions and their potential impact on their stock holdings.
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 274 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 275
Being vigilant about market risk involves keeping a watchful eye on 
market indicators, economic trends, and geopolitical events that could 
affect overall market sentiment. Understanding the broader market’s 
behavior and potential trends can help investors make more informed 
decisions and adjust their portfolio strategy when necessary. By assess￾ing market risk, you can position your investments to align with your risk 
tolerance and financial objectives, mitigating the impact of market down￾turns on your stock holdings.
Risk Due to Inflation
Inflation risk is a critical factor that investors should consider when par￾ticipating in the stock market. Rising inflation leads to an increase in the 
prices of goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of consumers. 
This reduction in real income can have adverse effects on stock invest￾ments, as investors may perceive stocks as less attractive when inflation 
erodes their returns. Inflation can lead to higher costs of living and can 
negatively affect stock investments, which are often considered a hedge 
against inflation. During times of high inflation, the real return on invest￾ments may decrease, and stocks may face competition from alterna￾tive investments, such as bonds, which can put downward pressure on 
the stock market. Therefore, investors must remain vigilant about the 
impact of inflation on their stock investments, as rising inflation levels 
can increase the risks associated with stocks. During periods of low or 
manageable inflation, stock investments may carry lower risk, potentially 
leading to higher returns.
To address inflation risk, investors can explore different strategies 
such as diversification or investing in assets that historically perform 
well during inflationary periods, like certain commodities or inflation￾protected securities. By proactively considering and managing inflation 
risk, investors can make more informed decisions about their stock invest￾ments and align their portfolio strategy with their financial goals and risk 
tolerance.
Risk Due to Unfavorable Interest Rates
Unfavorable interest rates can exert a significant influence on the stock 
market and individual stock performances. When interest rates are on 
the rise, they can make alternative investments, particularly bonds, more 
appealing than stocks. This change in investor preferences can have a 
negative impact on the stock market’s overall performance. Furthermore, 
rising interest rates can also affect the profitability of companies because 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 275 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM276 • Navigating the Stock Market
their borrowing costs increase, leading to potential earnings declines and 
subsequent stock market declines.
Specific sectors within the stock market may be more sensitive to 
interest rate fluctuations due to their borrowing needs. For example, 
sectors with higher borrowing requirements, such as banks and utilities, 
are more directly influenced by interest rate changes, causing their stock 
prices to move in tandem with shifts in interest rates. In contrast, growth 
stocks or companies with lower borrowing needs tend to be less sensitive 
to interest rate changes. It is important for investors to remain vigilant 
and monitor interest rates as well as the factors driving them. Assessing 
interest rate risk on a sector and individual stock level is crucial to making 
informed investment decisions, adjusting portfolios, and managing expo￾sure to interest rate-related risks.
Risk From the Business
Business risks are an inherent part of the stock market and are contingent 
upon the performance and stability of individual companies. These risks 
can stem from various sources, both external and internal, and can mani￾fest as obsolescence of products and services, competitive pressures, inef￾fective strategies or execution, unresponsiveness to customer needs, poor 
management, and more. It is essential for investors to carefully evaluate 
and understand these business risks, as they can significantly impact the 
performance and stability of an investment.
One way to mitigate business risks is to invest in companies and sectors 
that you are knowledgeable about and understand well. Having a strong 
grasp of the companies you are investing in enables you to better assess 
and manage associated risks. For instance, if you prefer a more hands-off 
approach to your investments, it is advisable to avoid investing in compa￾nies with a single product and a short product cycle, as these businesses 
are susceptible to rapid changes in fortunes, leading to elevated levels of 
risk exposure. By aligning your investments with your expertise and risk 
tolerance, you can make more informed decisions and navigate the stock 
market with greater confidence.
Risk From Company Performance
Stock performance is subject to a complex interplay of factors, encom￾passing the broader stock market, the specific industry or sector it belongs 
to, and the company’s own performance. As an investor, you can diligently 
choose solid companies operating within robust sectors. The inherent risk 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 276 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 277
is that even a well-researched investment may underperform due to the 
company’s failure to meet expectations.
To mitigate this risk, diversification is a key strategy. By spreading 
your investments across a broad spectrum of companies, sectors, and 
industries, you create a protective buffer. This diversification ensures that 
a subpar performance by one or two companies will not jeopardize your 
entire portfolio. This risk management strategy allows you to weather 
the volatility of individual stock performances while benefiting from the 
potential growth of a well-diversified portfolio.
Risk of Growth Stocks
Investing in growth stocks carries a distinct set of risks. Growth compa￾nies, often in their early stages, lack the extensive performance history 
that established firms have, making their evaluation more challenging. 
Smaller companies, known for their higher-than-average growth rates 
relative to the broader market, are inherently riskier. In the event of fail￾ing to meet investor expectations, they are vulnerable to severe market 
reactions, with the potential to lose a substantial portion of their value in 
a single day. Due to these inherent risks, it is crucial to exercise caution 
and thorough assessment when considering investments in growth stocks. 
Moreover, investors should limit their allocations to these companies to 
avoid excessive exposure.
Selecting growth stocks requires careful analysis and research, includ￾ing a comprehensive evaluation of the company’s fundamentals, competi￾tive positioning, growth potential, and management quality. Additionally, 
diversification within your portfolio can help manage the inherent volatil￾ity associated with growth stocks. By investing only a portion of your funds 
in these high-risk, high-reward opportunities, you can strike a balance 
between potential returns and risk mitigation.
Other Risks
Investors should be aware of a variety of other risks that can impact their 
investments. Liquidity risk is one such concern, where a stock may lack 
sufficient trading volume or float, leading to erratic price swings or diffi￾culties in selling the stock during a market downturn. Mitigating this risk 
can be achieved by selecting stocks that are highly liquid and have sub￾stantial trading volumes, ensuring smoother market participation.
Currency risk is another important consideration for investors. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly affect the value of your 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 277 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM278 • Navigating the Stock Market
investments, especially if a stock derives a substantial portion of its 
business revenue from overseas operations. While currency risk is difficult 
to control, investors can limit their exposure to it by favoring stocks that 
are less dependent on international revenues or by using hedging strate￾gies to offset potential currency fluctuations. By assessing these risks and 
implementing appropriate strategies, investors can make more informed 
decisions and manage their investments more effectively.
Managing Risk
Managing stock market risk is a critical part of successful investing. While 
risk cannot be completely eliminated, there are strategies to mitigate it. 
One key approach is investing for the long term, as time tends to have a 
moderating effect on stock market risk. Short-term market fluctuations 
can be volatile, but long-term investors have historically seen more stable 
returns.
Diversification is another important risk management technique. 
Spreading investments across a range of stocks, sectors, and industries can 
reduce the impact of any single stock’s poor performance on your overall 
portfolio. Overdiversification should be avoided, as it can lead to subpar 
returns. Investing in companies based on thorough fundamental research 
and analysis is also essential for reducing risk. By focusing on companies 
with strong financials and promising growth prospects, investors can make 
more informed decisions. Last, staying informed and making calculated 
moves based on research, rather than reacting impulsively to market 
events, can help reduce risk and improve your chances of success in the 
stock market.
VOLATILITY AND RISK
The stock market is characterized by volatility and many risks, which 
are discussed in this section. To avoid losses, investors should be aware 
of these factors which can impact their individual stocks as well as the 
market.
Understanding Price Fluctuations
Price fluctuations in the stock market are a common and inherent part of 
its dynamic nature. These fluctuations occur at various time scales, rang￾ing from daily, hourly, and even on a minute-by-minute basis. They are 
influenced by a multitude of factors, with changes in investor perceptions 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 278 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 279
playing a central role. Positive news, such as strong corporate earnings or 
favorable economic indicators, tends to drive stock prices higher, while 
negative news can have the opposite effect.
Investors and traders use the term volatility to describe the degree 
of these price fluctuations. High volatility indicates that stock prices are 
experiencing rapid and significant changes, whether upward or downward. 
While short-term traders often thrive on volatility, long-term investors 
may not be as concerned with short-term price swings. Understanding the 
reasons behind these fluctuations and the role of investor sentiment can 
help investors make more informed decisions, whether they are actively 
trading or taking a long-term approach.
Do Not Confuse Volatility With Risk
It is important for investors to distinguish between volatility and risk. 
While these terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct 
meanings in the context of investing. Risk refers to the potential danger 
that an investment may lose its value, posing a threat to an investor’s cap￾ital. Volatility, however, pertains to the short-term price fluctuations of an 
investment, which can sometimes be quite substantial.
Many investors equate volatility with risk, believing that if a stock 
experiences significant short-term price swings, it must be risky. This 
is not always the case. Growth stocks, for instance, tend to have above 
average volatility because of their potential for rapid growth and market 
sentiment shifts. While some volatile stocks can be risky, it is essential 
to focus on the long-term prospects of a company. Volatility can provide 
opportunities for investors, and stocks that experience short-term price 
fluctuations might still have strong fundamentals and growth potential in 
the long run. If an investor’s temperament is not suited to handling vol￾atility, they may choose to avoid highly volatile stocks and focus on more 
stable investments.
Assess Risk Tolerance
The level of risk associated with an investment can vary significantly based 
on the type of investment and the specific stock in question. Generally, 
bonds and fixed-income securities are considered to be less risky com￾pared to stocks. Within the stock market, there is a risk spectrum, with 
large capitalization and blue-chip companies typically being more stable 
and less risky than smaller, less established companies. Investors generally 
expect a higher rate of return when they take on higher levels of risk. This 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 279 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM280 • Navigating the Stock Market
expected return, often referred to as the risk premium, can vary from one 
investor to another based on their individual risk tolerance, investment 
goals, and market conditions. For stock investments, investors typically 
demand a higher return to compensate for the risk associated with the 
potential volatility in earnings compared to government-backed instru￾ments like bonds. This premium is often estimated to be approximately 
4%, although it may fluctuate over time.
Investors need to carefully assess their risk tolerance, understanding 
how much risk they are willing to accept to achieve their financial objec￾tives. It is essential to align one’s investment strategy with their risk tol￾erance, as investing too conservatively may result in insufficient returns, 
while taking on too much risk can lead to substantial losses. Diversifying 
a portfolio by including different types of assets and investments can help 
mitigate risk and provide a more balanced approach to achieving long￾term financial goals.
Measuring Volatility
Measuring volatility is a critical step in assessing investment risk, especially 
for stocks. The level of risk associated with a particular stock can vary sig￾nificantly based on its characteristics and market conditions. To quantify 
this risk and understand the expected price fluctuations, investors often 
rely on a financial metric known as beta. Beta measures the price volatility 
of a specific stock in comparison to a broad market benchmark, such as 
the S&P 500 index. It provides valuable insights into how much a stock’s 
price can be expected to move, either upward or downward, in relation to 
the overall market.
When evaluating stocks, a higher beta suggests that the stock has a 
higher degree of price volatility and risk, making it suitable for investors 
who are comfortable with large price swings and are willing to take on 
more risk. Conversely, stocks with lower beta values are characterized by 
less price volatility and risk, making them a preferred choice for conserva￾tive investors who seek more stability in their investments. By considering 
a stock’s beta, investors can align their investment choices with their risk 
tolerance and overall financial goals, ensuring that their portfolio is well￾suited to their individual preferences and circumstances.
Which Beta to Use 
When using beta to assess investment risk, it is essential to consider your 
individual risk profile and investment objectives. The S&P 500 index 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 280 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 281
serves as the benchmark with a beta value of 1, representing a baseline 
level of price volatility and risk. Stocks are compared to this index, and 
their beta values indicate how much more or less volatile they are com￾pared to the S&P 500. For instance, a stock with a beta of 1.5 is antic￾ipated to be 50% more volatile than the S&P 500. So, if the S&P 500 
moves up or down by 15%, this stock would be expected to move by 30% 
in the same direction.
Conversely, a stock with a beta of 0.5 is considered to be half as vola￾tile as the S&P 500, resulting in a more stable price performance. When 
selecting stocks, it is important to align the stock’s beta with your personal 
risk tolerance and investment goals. If you are risk averse, you may prefer 
to invest in low beta stocks, which offer greater stability. If you are com￾fortable with taking on higher risk, you may opt for technology or growth 
stocks with high beta values, knowing they have the potential for greater 
price volatility and returns. Your choice of beta should be in line with your 
overall investment strategy and risk appetite.
Do Not Use Beta for Timing
Using beta for timing can be a risky strategy. It relies on the assumption 
that the market’s direction can be accurately predicted, which is a challeng￾ing and uncertain endeavor. Attempting to time the market based on beta 
values involves switching between high and low beta stocks in response to 
market conditions. For example, during a rising market, investors might 
favor high beta stocks to potentially outperform the market, and during a 
declining market, they may opt for low beta stocks. This approach is not 
only based on the unpredictable movement of the market but also requires 
timely and accurate decision-making, which can be difficult to achieve.
Instead of using beta for market timing, it is generally advisable for 
long-term investors to focus on their overall investment strategy and 
objectives. Trying to time the market can result in missed opportunities, 
higher transaction costs, and increased risk. It is often more prudent to 
invest in a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and 
long-term financial goals rather than constantly adjusting your invest￾ments based on market timing strategies.
Favor Volatility Over Margin
Investing in high volatility stocks can indeed offer the potential for 
above average returns while still maintaining control over your invest￾ment risk. When compared to using margin, high volatility stocks may 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 281 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM282 • Navigating the Stock Market
provide a more prudent way to take on higher risk. One crucial advantage 
of investing in high volatility stocks is that it allows you to maintain direct 
ownership of the shares without borrowing money or incurring interest 
charges, as is the case with margin investing. This means that even if the 
stock experiences significant fluctuations, your losses are limited to your 
initial investment.
Contrastingly, using margin to amplify your positions exposes you to 
the risk of significant losses that can go beyond your initial investment. 
With margin trading, you are effectively borrowing funds from your bro￾ker, and you will be responsible for paying back those borrowed funds, 
along with any associated interest charges. If the market moves against 
you, the losses can accumulate rapidly, potentially resulting in financial 
distress or a margin call. In this sense, high volatility stocks may offer a 
more controlled approach to taking on additional risk in your portfolio 
without the added complexity and potential financial burden of margin 
trading. Always keep in mind that it is crucial to carefully research and 
understand the high volatility stocks you choose to invest in, as they can 
still carry substantial risks.
MINIMIZING TRADING RISKS
There are many risks associated with trading stocks, discussed in this sec￾tion, which can be avoided or minimized by knowledgeable investors.
Limit Your Losses
Setting a predetermined threshold for selling your stocks is a crucial part 
of effective risk management and capital preservation. By implement￾ing a stop-loss rule, such as a 10% decline limit, you create a disciplined 
approach to limiting losses in your portfolio. This practice helps prevent 
emotions from clouding your judgment, allowing you to make rational 
decisions based on your predetermined criteria. The psychological aspect 
of selling is often a significant challenge for investors, as they may become 
emotionally attached to their investments or hope that the stock will 
rebound. A stop-loss rule provides an objective guideline, reducing the 
risk of incurring larger losses due to delayed decision-making.
Additionally, employing a stop-loss strategy can help protect your 
overall portfolio and minimize the impact of a significant decline in any 
single stock. By adhering to this rule, you can swiftly exit losing positions, 
freeing up capital that can be reallocated to better investment opportu￾nities. In this way, you maintain flexibility in managing your portfolio, 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 282 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 283
allowing you to adjust your holdings and take advantage of more promising 
investments. Overall, having a clear-cut stop-loss strategy is a valuable tool 
for maintaining discipline, controlling risk, and preserving your invest￾ment capital.
Make Use of Stops
Utilizing stop sell orders is an essential practice for risk management and 
protecting your investment capital. These orders act as a safety net to auto￾matically trigger a sell when the stock’s price declines to a predefined level. 
By placing a stop sell order below your purchase price, such as at $90 when 
the stock is trading at $100, you create a safeguard against significant losses. 
This proactive approach ensures that if the stock experiences a decline, 
you can limit your losses by selling your position at the predetermined 
stop price. It allows you to set a threshold based on your risk tolerance at 
approximately 8%–15% below the purchase price, although the exact level 
may vary based on the stock’s volatility and your investment strategy.
One significant advantage of using moving averages, such as the 200-day 
or 50-day moving average lines, as stop-loss limits is that they offer a 
dynamic approach to managing risk. These indicators help you align your 
stop-loss levels with the stock’s price movements over time. This means 
that as the stock’s performance evolves, your stop loss adapts accordingly. 
This flexibility can be particularly useful in different market conditions 
and with stocks that exhibit varying degrees of volatility. Overall, incor￾porating stop sell orders in your investment strategy is a prudent way to 
control risk, safeguard your capital, and ensure you have an exit plan in 
place to protect your investments.
Keep Cash Reserves
Maintaining cash reserves in your investment portfolio is a smart strategy 
that provides you with financial flexibility and risk mitigation. While it is 
essential to participate in the stock market to achieve your financial goals, 
having some funds on the sidelines can be advantageous, particularly dur￾ing specific market conditions. The specific allocation of cash reserves 
varies according to factors like the market’s current state, the volatility 
of your stocks, and the sector or industry conditions. Investors often set 
aside 5%–10% of their funds as cash reserves to be ready for opportuni￾ties when they arise.
These reserves act as a financial cushion, allowing you to capitalize on 
market corrections or individual stock opportunities. When the market 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 283 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM284 • Navigating the Stock Market
or a specific stock experiences a downturn, you can utilize these funds 
to take advantage of discounted prices, thereby enhancing your long￾term returns. While maintaining cash reserves might temporarily affect 
the overall portfolio return, the risk mitigation and strategic benefits they 
offer can significantly outweigh the drawbacks, providing you with the 
confidence to navigate various market conditions effectively.
Limit Exposure to Thinly Traded Stocks
Investors should exercise caution when considering stocks with limited 
liquidity, typically characterized by a small float or low daily trading vol￾ume, especially those with less than 200,000 shares. These thinly traded 
stocks pose higher risks, making them a less attractive option. There are 
two primary drawbacks associated with these stocks. First, they tend to 
exhibit higher volatility, resulting in more significant price swings and 
fluctuations that can lead to unexpected and potentially substantial losses. 
Secondly, the limited trading volume can make these stocks challenging 
to sell, particularly during market downturns.
In times of market panic or extreme volatility, it may be extremely 
difficult to execute sell orders for thinly traded stocks. In some cases, even 
regular or routine selling can be problematic, as there may not be suf￾ficient demand or liquidity to accommodate your trade. This illiquidity 
risk highlights the importance of opting for stocks with more substantial 
trading volumes and greater market participation, ensuring that you have 
the flexibility to enter or exit positions as needed, thereby reducing your 
exposure to potential losses.
Avoid Short Selling
Short selling is a high-risk strategy where investors borrow and sell shares, 
speculating on a stock’s decline to repurchase them later at a lower price 
for a profit. This approach, potentially lucrative but laden with risks, 
demands careful monitoring, strict risk management, and thorough anal￾ysis, making it challenging even for experienced investors. Theoretically, 
losses in short selling are unlimited if the stock’s price rises unexpect￾edly, making it less suitable for those not well-versed in the stock market 
intricacies. Successful short selling requires a profound understanding of 
market dynamics and is often best left to seasoned professionals.
Despite potential profitability in a declining market, this strategy 
poses significant risks, particularly the potential for theoretically unlimited 
losses. Unlike traditional investing, where a stock’s value can only drop to 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 284 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 285
zero, short selling exposes investors to the risk of the stock’s price rising 
without an upper limit. In such cases, short sellers may be compelled 
to buy back shares at a considerably higher cost, resulting in substantial 
financial losses.
Investigate Before Acting on Any Hot Tip
Hot tips can be tempting, but they should be approached with caution. It 
is essential to maintain a critical and analytical mindset when evaluating 
such tips. First and foremost, it is crucial to separate the source of the 
tip from the information itself. Sometimes, individuals sharing these tips 
might have ulterior motives or lack sufficient expertise. Once you’ve dis￾associated the tip from the tipster, you should conduct thorough research. 
Begin by examining the story or news that is said to make the stock “hot.”
Your analysis should delve into the company’s business operations, 
competitive positioning, financial fundamentals, earnings potential, 
industry conditions, and other pertinent factors. Apply the same rigorous 
screening and selection criteria that you would to any other investment 
opportunity. Only after conducting a comprehensive evaluation and con￾cluding that the stock has genuine potential for future appreciation should 
you consider taking action. This approach helps you make informed deci￾sions based on your investment criteria rather than blindly following hot 
tips that can often be unreliable or driven by short-term hype.
Learn How to Identify a Weakening Stock
Identifying a weakening stock is crucial for investors, as it allows them 
to proactively manage their portfolio and avoid potential losses. Several 
warning signs can help you recognize when a stock is weakening. One 
common sign is distribution, which occurs when a stock is heavily traded 
on days when its price declines and lightly traded on days when it rises. 
This asymmetrical trading pattern indicates a lack of buying interest and 
can be a red flag. Another indication of a weakening stock is when it expe￾riences a rally back on below-average volume after a decline. This sug￾gests that there might not be sufficient buying support for the stock to 
sustain its recovery.
Additionally, pay attention to a stock that does not move in sync with 
the broader market, especially on days when the market is rising. A stock 
that fails to participate in a market rally or even moves in the opposite 
direction may be signaling weakness. Watch out for signs like breakout 
failures, where a stock attempts to move higher after a consolidation 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 285 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM286 • Navigating the Stock Market
phase but repeatedly fails to do so. This can be a clear signal of underlying 
weakness. To avoid getting caught in such situations, it is essential to 
closely monitor your stock for these warning signs. Keep an eye on the 
leaders in your stock’s industry group, as their behavior can often serve 
as a leading indicator of your stock’s future performance. Lastly, stay 
informed and vigilant about any early signs of weakening fundamentals, 
as they are often reflected in a stock’s behavior and can help you make 
timely decisions to protect your investments.
Handle Red-Hot Stocks With the Greatest Care
Red-hot stocks that defy expectations by soaring to new heights can be 
a double-edged sword for investors. While they may seem like enticing 
opportunities, they come with substantial reward and risk. It is crucial 
to approach such stocks with great care and caution. The potential for 
both significant gains and significant losses is much higher than with typ￾ical stocks. Investing in these stocks requires a thoughtful and informed 
approach. Before considering an investment in a red-hot stock, it is essen￾tial to conduct a thorough analysis. Understand the underlying reasons for 
the stock’s exceptional performance and determine whether the surge is 
sustainable or if it is merely a speculative bubble.
Unfortunately, many investors let their emotions drive their decisions 
and dive into such stocks without conducting proper due diligence. This 
impulsive behavior often leads to unfavorable outcomes. To avoid being 
burned by a red-hot stock, make sure you maintain a disciplined and ana￾lytical approach when evaluating these opportunities. Remember, when 
dealing with these exceptional cases the stakes are higher, and careful 
consideration is paramount.
Protect Yourself During a Blow-Off Move
During a blow-off move, a stock can exhibit remarkable price surges 
that seem unstoppable, often defying conventional expectations. These 
extraordinary rallies can propel a stock upward by 25%–50% within a 
very short time, or they may take it significantly above its 200-day moving 
average. While the potential for substantial profits is undeniable, these 
meteoric rises also carry a high level of risk. It is crucial to exercise extra 
caution if you hold such stocks in your portfolio, as they have a propensity 
to run out of momentum suddenly and undergo a rapid descent. These 
stocks typically offer warning signs that they are about to reverse course, 
such as closing near their daily lows, experiencing their largest price gain 
of the rally, failing to appreciate despite heavy trading volume, presenting 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 286 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMRisk Management • 287
an exhaustion gap, or reaching a new price high on substantially lower 
trading volume.
To protect yourself during a blow-off move, you can employ various 
strategies. One option is to sell a portion of your position to lock in profits, 
reducing your exposure to any potential downturn. Another approach is to 
use stop orders that are based on the stock’s chart pattern. This way, you can 
establish predetermined exit points at which your stock will automatically 
be sold if it starts to decline. These measures help safeguard your invest￾ments and allow you to capitalize on the exceptional gains while managing 
the increased risk associated with stocks experiencing blow-off moves.
USE OPTIONS
This section discusses how options can be used to generate income, 
reduce the cost basis, and also the risks and rewards associated with call 
and put options.
Sell Call Options to Decrease the Cost Basis
When you own a stock that you intend to hold for an extended period, imple￾menting a covered call strategy can be a useful technique to generate income 
while effectively reducing your overall cost basis in the stock. Covered call 
writing involves selling a call option, granting the option buyer the right, 
though not the obligation, to purchase the underlying stock from you at a 
pre-established price known as the strike price. As the seller of the call, you 
receive a premium from the option buyer, thereby enhancing your returns. 
The primary risk you face in this strategy is that the stock may appreciate 
significantly above the strike price, potentially forcing you to sell the stock.
By employing covered calls, you effectively decrease your cost basis 
in the stock, enabling you to acquire shares at a lower net cost compared 
to the initial purchase price. This strategy allows you to benefit from gen￾erating extra income from the premium received while still participating 
in the stock’s potential price appreciation, all within a longer-term invest￾ment horizon. It is always important to consider your overall investment 
objectives and risk tolerance when implementing this approach to ensure 
it aligns with your financial goals.
Risks and Rewards of Call Options
Understanding the risks and rewards of call options is crucial for effective 
investment decision-making. When it comes to buying call options, it is 
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 287 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AM288 • Navigating the Stock Market
essential to acknowledge the inherent risk involved. As an option buyer, 
you pay a premium for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the 
underlying asset at a predetermined strike price before the option’s expi￾ration. The main risk is that if the price of the underlying asset does not 
reach the strike price by the option’s expiration, you may lose your entire 
premium investment. Therefore, buying call options is speculative in 
nature and carries the potential for significant losses.
Contrarily, selling call options, particularly when you already own 
the underlying stock, involves different risks and rewards. The primary 
risk for call sellers is the opportunity cost of potentially missing out on 
additional profit if the stock’s price appreciates beyond the strike price. 
Keep in mind you retain the premium received from the option buyer, 
which can act as a hedge against potential losses. By consistently selling 
call options over time, you can enhance your overall investment returns, 
particularly in markets with limited price movements. It is important to 
understand the trade-off between the potential opportunity cost of cap￾ping gains and the income generated from selling calls when implement￾ing this strategy.
Risks and Rewards of Put Options
Understanding the risks and rewards of put options is essential for 
effective risk management in your investment strategy. When you buy 
a put option, you are essentially purchasing insurance against a potential 
decline in the stock’s price. The put option provides you with the right, 
but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset (in this case, a stock) at 
the predetermined strike price. This strategy is suitable for investors who 
anticipate a significant decline in the stock’s value and want to protect 
their investment. The downside of buying put options is that it reduces 
the overall portfolio return because you are essentially paying for this 
insurance, which can be costly if the stock does not decline as expected.
Alternatively, if you are pessimistic about a stock’s future and believe it 
may experience a substantial decline, an alternative to buying put options 
is to consider selling the stock. Selling the stock can be a more straight￾forward approach and may eliminate the need to pay premiums for put 
options. The choice between buying puts and selling the stock depends on 
your risk tolerance, your confidence in the stock’s performance, and your 
overall investment objectives. It is crucial to carefully evaluate these fac￾tors and understand the trade-offs associated with each strategy to make 
an informed decision.
NSM_CH17_2pp.indd 288 1/27/2024 11:15:33 AMCHAPTER
AI EVOLUTION IN THE STOCK MARKET
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the stock market has revolu￾tionized financial markets, from early algorithmic trading to advanced 
machine learning models. This section discusses its evolution and recent 
developments, which have influenced how the stock market operates.
History
The history of AI in the stock market is a narrative of continuous innova￾tion and transformation, reshaping the landscape of financial markets and 
influencing the way investors approach trading and decision-making. This 
evolution spans several decades, witnessing key milestones in the applica￾tion of AI technologies.
The initial forays into AI for finance emerged in the mid-twentieth 
century, marked by attempts to implement rule-based systems and algo￾rithms for automated trading. It’s important to note that computational 
limitations and the intricate nature of financial markets constrained the 
practicality of these early AI models. The 1980s saw the rise of expert sys￾tems, designed to emulate human decision-making processes in financial 
analysis. Despite providing some automation, these systems faced chal￾lenges due to their static rule-based nature and struggled to capture the 
dynamic complexities of financial markets.
A pivotal shift occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the 
adoption of machine learning, particularly neural networks. These sys￾tems, capable of learning from data, brought a more dynamic and flexible 
approach to financial modeling. Neural networks were applied to tasks

such as pattern recognition, stock price prediction, and risk management. 
The 2000s marked the era of algorithmic trading, with AI-driven algo￾rithms playing a central role. High-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms 
emerged, executing trades at speeds beyond human capability and react￾ing to market changes in fractions of a second. This period witnessed a 
transition toward more sophisticated AI-driven trading strategies.
Recent Developments
The advent of big data technologies and increased computational power in the 
2010s further propelled AI applications in finance. Machine learning models, 
fueled by vast datasets, became adept at analyzing market trends, identifying 
patterns, and making predictions. Sentiment analysis through natural lan￾guage processing (NLP) gained prominence, extracting insights from news 
articles, social media, and financial reports. Robo-advisors, another signifi￾cant development, characterized the latter part of the 2010s. These platforms 
leveraged AI algorithms to provide personalized investment advice based on 
individual preferences, risk tolerance, and financial goals. This marked a shift 
toward more accessible and automated portfolio management.
In the current decade, AI in the stock market continues to evolve 
with advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the 
integration of alternative data sources such as satellite imagery and social 
media trends. AI is now employed for market surveillance, fraud detec￾tion, and dynamic pricing strategies.
The history of AI in the stock market reflects a journey of continuous 
adaptation and innovation. From early attempts at rule-based systems to 
the current era of sophisticated machine learning models, AI has reshaped 
how financial markets operate and how investment decisions are made. The 
ongoing evolution underscores the transformative impact of AI on the finan￾cial industry, with implications for the future of stock market dynamics.
TRADING AND ANALYSIS
This section discusses how AI has significantly influenced stock market 
trading and analysis by introducing sophisticated algorithms that analyze 
vast datasets, identify patterns, and execute trades at remarkable speeds.
Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic trading is a prominent facet of modern financial markets, 
where AI-driven algorithms play a pivotal role in executing transactions 
NSM_CH18_4pp.indd 290 2/14/2024 11:42:20 AMAI in Stock Investing • 291
with unparalleled speed and frequency, surpassing human capabilities.
