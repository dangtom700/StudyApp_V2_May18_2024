Preface
Overview
“There is a close analogy between organic chemistry in its relation to biochemistry and 
pure mathematics in its relation to physics.”
Sir Robert Robinson
This quote from Sir Robert Robinson exemplifies two broad goals in the creation 
of the twelfth edition of Francis Carey’s organic chemistry textbook. We want our stu￾dents to have a deeper understanding of the physical concepts that underlie organic 
chemistry, and we want them to have a broader knowledge of the role of organic chem￾istry in biological systems. The Carey team includes two new coauthors starting with the 
eleventh edition, Neil Allison, and Susan Bane, who have expertise in physical organic 
chemistry and in biochemistry. Significant changes in the areas of structure and mecha￾nism and in bioorganic chemistry have been incorporated into the twelfth edition. These 
and other changes are highlighted below.
Mechanism
The text is organized according to functional groups—structural units within a molecule 
that are most closely identified with characteristic properties. Reaction mechanisms are 
emphasized early and often in an effort to develop the student’s ability to see similarities 
in reactivity across the diverse range of functional groups encountered in organic chem￾istry. Mechanisms are developed from observations; thus, reactions are normally pre￾sented first, followed by their mechanism.
In order to maintain consistency with what our students have already learned, this 
text presents multistep mechanisms in the same way as most general chemistry 
textbooks—that is, as a series of elementary steps. Additionally, we provide a brief comment 
about how each step contributes to the overall mechanism. Section 1.11 “Curved Arrows, 
Arrow Pushing, and Chemical Reactions” provides the student with an early introduction 
to the notational system employed in all of the mechanistic discussions in the text.
Numerous reaction mechanisms are accompanied by potential energy diagrams. 
Section 5.8 “Reaction of Alcohols with Hydrogen Halides: The SN1 Mechanism” shows 
how the potential energy diagrams for three elementary steps are combined to give the 
diagram for the overall reaction.
Enhanced Graphics
The teaching of organic chemistry has especially benefited as powerful modeling and 
graphics software has become routinely available. Computer-generated molecular models 
and electrostatic potential maps were integrated into the third edition of this text and 
their number has increased in succeeding editions; also seeing increasing use are molecu￾lar orbital theory and the role of orbital interactions in chemical reactivity.
Coverage of Biochemical Topics
From its earliest editions, four chapters have been included on biochemical topics and 
updated to cover topics of recent interest.
▸ Chapter 23 Carbohydrates
▸ Chapter 24 Lipids
▸ Chapter 25 Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
▸ Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic AcidsGenerous and Effective Use of Tables
Annotated summary tables have been a staple of Organic Chemistry since the first edi￾tion. Some tables review reactions from earlier chapters, others the reactions or concepts 
of a current chapter. Still other tables walk the reader step-by-step through skill builders 
and concepts unique to organic chemistry. Well received by students and faculty alike, 
these summary tables remain one of the text’s strengths.
Problems
▸ Problem-solving strategies and skills are emphasized throughout. Understanding is 
progressively reinforced by problems that appear within topic sections.
▸ For many problems, sample solutions are given, including examples of handwritten 
solutions from the authors.
▸ The text now contains more than 1400 problems, many of which contain multiple 
parts. End-of-chapter problems are now organized to conform to the primary topic 
areas of each chapter.
Pedagogy
▸ A list of tables, mechanisms, boxed features, and Descriptive Passages and Interpre￾tive Questions is included in the front matter as a quick reference to these important 
learning tools in each chapter.
▸ Each chapter begins with an opener that is meant to capture the reader’s attention. 
Chemistry that is highlighted in the opener is relevant to chemistry that is included 
in the chapter.
▸ End-of-Chapter Summaries highlight and consolidate all of the important concepts 
and reactions within a chapter.
Audience
Organic Chemistry is designed to meet the needs of the “mainstream,” two-semester 
undergraduate organic chemistry course. From the beginning and with each new edition, 
we have remained grounded in some fundamental notions. These include important issues 
concerning the intended audience. Is the topic appropriate for them with respect to their 
interests, aspirations, and experience? Just as important is the need to present an accurate 
picture of the present state of organic chemistry. How do we know what we know? What 
makes organic chemistry worth knowing? Where are we now? Where are we headed?
Descriptive Passages and Interpretive Problems
Many organic chemistry students later take standardized pre-professional examinations 
composed of problems derived from a descriptive passage; this text includes comparable 
passages and problems to familiarize students with this testing style.
Thus, every chapter concludes with a self-contained Descriptive Passage and Inter￾pretive Problems unit that complements the chapter’s content while emulating the “MCAT 
style.” These 27 passages—listed on page xxii—are accompanied by more than 100 total 
multiple-choice problems.
The passages focus on a wide range of topics—from structure, synthesis, mecha￾nism, and natural products. They provide instructors with numerous opportunities to 
customize their own organic chemistry course, while giving students practice in combin￾ing new information with what they have already learned.
A Student-Focused Revision
Many updates have been made according to changing scientific data and are based on 
current events and reviewer feedback. The following “What’s New” summary lists the 
more major additions and refinements.
xxiv PrefacePreface xxv
What’s New
General Revisions
Reflecting the Diverse World Around Us
McGraw Hill believes in unlocking the potential of every learner at every stage of life. 
To accomplish that, we are dedicated to creating products that reflect, and are accessible 
to, all the diverse, global customers we serve. Within McGraw Hill, we foster a culture 
of belonging, and we work with partners who share our commitment to equity, inclusion, 
and diversity in all forms. In McGraw Hill Higher Education, this includes, but is not 
limited to, the following:
▸ Refreshing and implementing inclusive content guidelines around topics including 
generalizations and stereotypes, gender, abilities/disabilities, race/ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, diversity of names, and age.
▸ Enhancing best practices in assessment creation to eliminate cultural, cognitive, and 
affective bias.
▸ Maintaining and continually updating a robust photo library of diverse images that 
reflect our student populations.
▸ Including more diverse voices in the development and review of our content. 
Strengthening art guidelines to improve accessibility by ensuring meaningful text 
and images are distinguishable and perceivable by users with limited color vision and 
moderately low vision.
▸ Each trend is now set in a shadowbox with a clear title to highlight the importance 
of the trend and aid in student understanding. The description of the trend is placed 
at the bottom.
▸ Color has been revised for consistency in many areas to help students better under￾stand three-dimensional structure, stereochemistry, and reactions. Reaction coordi￾nate diagrams’ rate-determining steps, as well as their protonation and deprotonation 
steps, have their own consistent color. Similarly, any other reaction mechanistic steps 
are color consistent.
▸ New illustrations have also been added throughout the new edition to clarify topics 
and enhance the student learning experience. All pKa values were evaluated and 
updated.
▸ Integration values are now included in all proton NMR spectra starting with the 
Chapter 14 (Spectroscopy).
Chapter-Specific Revisions
▸ In Chapter 1, Rosalind Franklin’s important work that was critical in the discovery 
of the DNA double helix is included in the boxes essay entitled Molecular Models 
and Modeling. A new boxed essay, Curved Arrows and “Electron Pushing,” is 
included to aid in student understanding of the concept.
▸ In Chapter 3, new art was added, reinforcing the relative hydrogen positions in chair 
cyclohexane. Hydrogen and bromine values to the chair–chair interconversion table 
were added.
▸ In Chapter 4, the chirality axis section was moved to the penultimate section posi￾tion. The discussion of molecules with two chirality centers now follows the discus￾sion on enantiomers.
▸ In Chapter 12, the spin density of the benzyl radical has been added. Electron push￾ing was added into the Birch reduction (Mechanism 12.2). Lawrence Knox, a promi￾nent African-American chemist who first reported tropylium bromide, was added.
▸ The orientation of art to bond-line structures was improved in Chapters 7 (cis-2-
butene) and 13 (acylium ion).
▸ An improved discussion of peak integration in 1
H NMR in Chapter 14 was added.
▸ In Chapter 17, the discussion of the stereochemistry of the reaction of epoxides with 
nucleophiles was improved.xxvi Preface
▸ Chapter 18 reinforces molecular orbital descriptions in Chapters 7 and 11 by a dis￾cussion of the π molecular orbitals of the carbonyl group, while introducing the 
concept that a more electronegative oxygen’s 2p orbital is lower in energy than 
carbon’s 2p orbital. 
▸ Chapter 20 begins with a new boxed essay emphasizing the structural reasons why 
reactions of nucleophiles with carboxylic acid derivatives yield substitution products 
compared to the addition products formed with aldehydes and ketones (Chapter 18). 
A second boxed essay recounts how Alice Ball, the first female and first African￾American graduate and faculty member at the University of Hawai’i, converted an 
oily plant extract into a form that was effectively used in the treatment of Hansen’s 
disease (leprosy).
▸ Lipid nanoparticles are described in the context of liposomes in Chapter 24. Lipid 
nanoparticles are critical to the success of mRNA vaccines.
▸ The importance of using relative stereochemical descriptors (d,l) rather than absolute 
stereochemistry descriptors (R,S) for amino acids is explained and emphasized early 
in Chapter 25.
▸ In Chapter 26, the recent success of oligonucleotide-based drugs is highlighted in a 
new boxed essay entitled mRNA Therapeutics. Discussion of topics such as DNA 
sequencing has been updated to encompass next-generation sequencing, and outdated 
material was removed.

McGraw Hill Virtual Labs is a must-see, outcomes-based lab simulation. It assesses a 
student’s knowledge and adaptively corrects deficiencies, allowing the student to learn faster 
and retain more knowledge with greater success. First, a student’s knowledge is adap￾tively leveled on core learning outcomes: Questioning reveals knowledge deficiencies 
that are corrected by the delivery of content that is conditional on a student’s response. 
Then, a simulated lab experience requires the student to think and act like a scientist: 
recording, interpreting, and ana￾lyzing data using simulated 
equipment found in labs and 
clinics. The student is allowed to 
make mistakes—a powerful part 
of the learning experience! A 
virtual coach provides subtle 
hints when needed, asks ques￾tions about the student’s choices, 
and allows the student to reflect 
on and correct those mistakes. 
Whether your need is to over￾come the logistical challenges of 
a traditional lab, provide better 
lab prep, improve student perfor￾mance, or make your online 
experience one that rivals the real 
world, McGraw Hill Virtual Labs 
accomplishes it all.

Properties
Chemists like to call their discipline “The Central Science” 
because of its relationship to physics on one side and biology 
on the other. In the same way, among the various subdisciplines 
of chemistry, organic chemistry can be said to be central. It 
adapts the physical principles that underlie the content of gen￾eral chemistry courses to the relationships between structure 
and properties of compounds based on carbon—the most 
versatile of all the elements.
This chapter begins your training toward understanding 
the relationship between structure and properties by reviewing 
the fundamentals of the Lewis approach to molecular structure 
and bonding and describes the various graphical ways molecu￾lar structures are presented. Principles of acid–base chemistry—
emphasized in a quantitative way in introductory chemistry 
courses—are revisited qualitatively as a tool for introducing the 
effect of structure on properties. This structure/property rela￾tionship is what makes organic chemistry important. The same 
atom (carbon) is common to many structural types, countless 
compounds with different properties, and much variation in the 
degree to which a particular property is expressed. What is 
equally remarkable is the degree to which a relatively small 
group of principles suffice to connect the structure of a 
substance to its properties.
A class of meteors that strikes our planet is classified as “carbonaceous.” 
They bring organic compounds with them—even compounds as 
complicated as the DNA base xanthine.

1.1 Atoms, Electrons, and Orbitals
Before discussing structure and bonding in molecules, let’s first review some fundamen￾tals of atomic structure. Each element is characterized by a unique atomic number Z,* 
which is equal to the number of protons in its nucleus. A neutral atom has equal numbers 
of protons, which are positively charged, and electrons, which are negatively charged.
Electrons were believed to be particles from the time of their discovery in 1897 
until 1924, when the French physicist Louis de Broglie suggested that they have wavelike 
properties as well. Two years later Erwin Schrödinger took the next step and calculated 
the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom by using equations that treated the electron 
as if it were a wave. Instead of a single energy, Schrödinger obtained a series of energies, 
each of which corresponded to a different mathematical description of the electron wave. 
These mathematical descriptions are called wave functions and are symbolized by the 
Greek letter ψ (psi).
According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we can’t tell exactly where an 
electron is, but we can tell where it is most likely to be. The probability of finding an 
electron at a particular spot relative to an atom’s nucleus is given by the square of the 
wave function (ψ2
) at that point. Figure 1.1 illustrates the probability of finding an elec￾tron at various points in the lowest energy (most stable) state of a hydrogen atom. The 
darker the color in a region, the higher the probability. The probability of finding an 
electron at a particular point is greatest near the nucleus and decreases with increasing 
distance from the nucleus but never becomes zero.
Wave functions are also called orbitals. For convenience, chemists use the term 
“orbital” in several different ways. A drawing such as Figure 1.1 is often said to represent 
an orbital. We will see other kinds of drawings in this chapter, and use the word “orbital” 
to describe them too.
Orbitals are described by specifying their size, shape, and directional properties. 
Spherically symmetrical ones such as shown in Figure 1.1 are called s orbitals. The letter 
s is preceded by the principal quantum number n (n = 1, 2, 3, etc.), which specifies 
the shell and is related to the energy of the orbital. An electron in a 1s orbital is likely 
to be found closer to the nucleus, is lower in energy, and is more strongly held than an 
electron in a 2s orbital.
Instead of probability distributions, it is more common to represent orbitals by their 
boundary surfaces, as shown in Figure 1.2 for the 1s and 2s orbitals. The region 
enclosed by a boundary surface is arbitrary but is customarily the volume where the 
probability of finding an electron is high—on the order of 90–95%. Like the probability 
distribution plot from which it is derived, a picture of a boundary surface is usually 
described as a drawing of an orbital.
A hydrogen atom (Z = 1) has one electron; a helium atom (Z = 2) has two. The 
single electron of hydrogen occupies a 1s orbital, as do the two electrons of helium. We 
write their electron configurations as
Hydrogen: 1s
1 Helium: 1s

A glossary of the terms shown in boldface may be found immediately before the index at the back of the book.4 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
In addition to being negatively charged, electrons possess the property of spin. The 
spin quantum number of an electron can have a value of either +_1
2
 or −_1
2
 . According 
to the Pauli exclusion principle, two electrons may occupy the same orbital only when 
they have opposite, or “paired,” spins. For this reason, no orbital can contain more than 
two electrons. Because two electrons fill the 1s orbital, the third electron in lithium (Z = 3) 
must occupy an orbital of higher energy. After 1s, the next higher energy orbital is 2s.
The third electron in lithium therefore occupies the 2s orbital, and the electron configu￾ration of lithium is
Lithium: 1s
2
2s

The period (or row) of the periodic table in which an element appears corresponds to 
the principal quantum number of the highest numbered occupied orbital (n = 1 in the 
case of hydrogen and helium). Hydrogen and helium are first-row elements; lithium (n = 2) 
is a second-row element.
With beryllium (Z = 4), the 2s level becomes filled and, beginning with boron 
(Z = 5), the next orbitals to be occupied are 2px, 2py, and 2pz. These three orbitals 
(Figure 1.3) are of equal energy and are characterized by boundary surfaces that are 
usually described as “dumbbell-shaped.” The axes of the three 2p orbitals are at right 
angles to one another. Each orbital consists of two “lobes,” represented in Figure 1.3 
by regions of different colors. Regions of a single orbital, in this case, each 2p orbital, 
may be separated by nodal surfaces where the wave function changes sign and the 
probability of finding an electron is zero.
The electron configurations of the first 12 elements, hydrogen through magnesium, 
are given in Table 1.1. In filling the 2p orbitals, notice that each is singly occupied before 
any one is doubly occupied. This general principle for orbitals of equal energy is known as 
Hund’s rule. Of particular importance in Table 1.1 are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and 
oxygen. Countless organic compounds contain nitrogen, oxygen, or both in addition to 
carbon, the essential element of organic chemistry. Most of them also contain hydrogen.
It is often convenient to speak of the valence electrons of an atom. These are the 
outermost electrons, the ones most likely to be involved in chemical bonding and reac￾tions. For second-row elements these are the 2s and 2p electrons. Because four orbitals 
(2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) are involved, the maximum number of electrons in the valence shell
of any second-row element is 8. Neon, with all its 2s and 2p orbitals doubly occupied, 
has eight valence electrons and completes the second row of the periodic table. For 
main-group elements, the number of valence electrons is equal to its group number in 
the periodic table.
Problem 1.1
How many electrons does carbon have? How many are valence electrons? What third-row 
element has the same number of valence electrons as carbon?
A complete periodic table of the 
elements is presented at the back 
of the book.
Detailed solutions to all of the 
problems are found in the Student 
Solutions Manual along with a brief 
discussion and advice on how to do 
problems of the same type.

of each orbital are indicated by different colors. The yz-plane is a nodal surface for the 2px orbital. The 
probability of finding a 2px electron in the yz-plane is zero. Analogously, the xz-plane is a nodal surface 
for the 2py orbital, and the xy-plane is a nodal surface for the 2pz orbital.
Other methods are also used to 
contrast the regions of an orbital 
where the signs of the wave function 
are different. Some mark one lobe of a 
p orbital + and the other −. Others 
shade one lobe and leave the other 
blank. When this level of detail isn’t 
necessary, no differentiation is made 
between the two lobes.1.1 Atoms, Electrons, and Orbitals 5
Once the 2s and 2p orbitals are filled, the next level is the 3s, followed by the 3px,
3py, and 3pz orbitals. Electrons in these orbitals are farther from the nucleus than those 
in the 2s and 2p orbitals and are of higher energy.
Problem 1.2
Referring to the periodic table as needed, write electron configurations for all the elements 
in the third period.
Sample Solution The third period begins with sodium and ends with argon. The atomic 
number Z of sodium is 11, and so a sodium atom has 11 electrons. The maximum number of 
electrons in the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals is ten, and so the eleventh electron of sodium 
occupies a 3s orbital. The electron configuration of sodium is 1s2

Organic Chemistry: The Early Days
Eighteenth-century chemists regarded their science as being 
composed of two branches. One dealt with substances 
obtained from natural or living sources and was called organic 
chemistry; the other dealt with materials from nonliving matter—
minerals and the like—and was called inorganic chemistry. Over 
time, combustion analysis established that the compounds derived 
from natural sources contained carbon, and a new definition of 
organic chemistry emerged: Organic chemistry is the study of 
carbon compounds. This is the definition we still use today.
As the eighteenth century gave way to the nineteenth, 
many scientists still subscribed to a doctrine known as vitalism,
which held that living systems possessed a “vital force” that was 
absent in nonliving systems. Substances derived from natural 
sources (organic) were thought to be fundamentally different 
from inorganic ones. It was believed that inorganic compounds 
could be synthesized in the laboratory, but organic compounds 
could not—at least not from inorganic materials.
In 1823, Friedrich Wöhler, after completing medical stud￾ies in Germany, spent a year in Stockholm studying under one of 
the world’s foremost chemists of the time, Jöns Jacob Berzelius. 
Wöhler subsequently went on to have a distinguished indepen￾dent career, spending most of it at the University of Göttingen. 
Wöhler is best remembered for a brief paper published in 1828 
in which it was noted that, on evaporating an aqueous solution 
of ammonium cyanate, he obtained “colorless, clear crystals 
often more than an inch long,” which were not ammonium 
cyanate but were instead urea.
NH4OCN O C(NH2)2
Ammonium cyanate
(inorganic)
Urea
(organic)
This transformation was remarkable at the time because 
an inorganic salt, ammonium cyanate, was converted to urea, a 
known organic substance earlier isolated from urine. It is now 
recognized as a significant early step toward overturning the 
philosophy of vitalism. Although Wöhler made no extravagant 
claims concerning the relationship of his discovery to vitalist 
theory, the die was cast, and over the next generation organic 
chemistry outgrew vitalism. What particularly seemed to excite 
Wöhler and Berzelius had very little to do with vitalism. Berzelius 
was interested in cases in which two clearly different materials 
had the same elemental composition, and thus invented the 
word isomers to apply to them. Wöhler’s observation that an 
inorganic compound (ammonium cyanate) of molecular formula 
CH4N2O could be transformed into an organic compound (urea) 
of the same molecular formula had an important bearing on the 
concept of isomerism.
From the concept of isomerism, we can trace the origins of 
the structural theory—the idea that a specific arrangement of atoms 
uniquely defines a substance. Ammonium cyanate and urea are 
different compounds because they have different structures.
Three mid-nineteenth-century scientists, August Kekulé, 
Archibald S. Couper, and Alexander M. Butlerov, stand out for 
separately proposing the elements of the structural theory. The 
essential features of Kekulé’s theory, developed and presented 
while he taught at Heidelberg in 1858, were that carbon nor￾mally formed four bonds and had the capacity to bond to other 
carbons to form long chains. Isomers were possible because the 
same elemental composition (say, the CH4N2O molecular for￾mula common to both ammonium cyanate and urea) accommo￾dates more than one pattern of atoms and bonds. Shortly after 
that, Couper, a Scot working at the École de Médecine in Paris, 
and Butlerov, a Russian chemist at the University of Kazan, pro￾posed similar theories.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, major 
discoveries about atoms and electrons placed theories of 
molecular structure and bonding on a more secure, physics￾based foundation. Several of these are described at the begin￾ning of this section.

Stock Photo6 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Neon, in the second period, and argon, in the third, have eight electrons in their valence 
shell; they are said to have a complete octet of electrons. Helium, neon, and argon belong 
to the class of elements known as noble gases or rare gases. The noble gases are character￾ized by an extremely stable “closed-shell” electron configuration and are very unreactive.
Structure determines properties and the properties of atoms depend on atomic 
structure. All of an element’s protons are in its nucleus, but the element’s electrons 
are distributed among orbitals of various energy and distance from the nucleus. 
More than anything else, we look at its electron configuration when we wish to under￾stand how an element behaves. Section 1.2 illustrates this with a brief review of ionic 
bonding.
1.2 Ionic Bonds
Atoms combine with one another to give compounds having properties different from 
the atoms they contain. The attractive force between atoms in a compound is a chemical 
bond. One type of chemical bond, called an ionic bond, is the force of attraction between 
oppositely charged species (ions) (Figure 1.4). Positively charged ions are referred to as 
cations; negatively charged ions are anions.
Whether an element is the source of the cation or anion in an ionic bond depends 
on several factors, for which the periodic table can serve as a guide. In forming ionic 
compounds, elements at the left of the periodic table typically lose electrons, giving a 
cation that has the same electron configuration as the preceding noble gas. Loss of an 
electron from sodium, for example, yields Na+, which has the same electron configura￾tion as neon.

An ionic bond is the force of attraction 
between oppositely charged ions. Each 
Na+ ion in the crystal lattice of solid 
NaCl is involved in ionic bonding to 
each of six surrounding Cl− ions and 
vice versa. The smaller spheres are Na+
and the larger spheres are Cl−.1.2 Ionic Bonds 7
Problem 1.3
Species that have the same number of electrons are described as isoelectronic. What +2 ion 
is isoelectronic with Na+
? What −2 ion?
A large amount of energy, called the ionization energy, must be transferred to 
any atom to dislodge an electron. The ionization energy of sodium, for example, is 
496 kJ/mol (119 kcal/mol). Processes that absorb energy are said to be endothermic.
Compared with other elements, sodium and its relatives in group 1A have relatively 
low ionization energies. In general, ionization energy increases across a row in the 
periodic table.
Elements at the right of the periodic table tend to gain electrons to reach the electron 
configuration of the next higher noble gas. Adding an electron to chlorine, for example, 
gives the anion Cl−, which has the same closed-shell electron configuration as the noble 
gas argon.

Energy is released when a chlorine atom captures an electron. Energy-releasing 
reactions are described as exothermic, and the energy change for an exothermic process 
has a negative sign. The energy change for addition of an electron to an atom is referred 
to as its electron affinity and is −349 kJ/mol (−83.4 kcal/mol) for chlorine.
We can use the ionization energy of sodium and the electron affinity of chlorine 
to calculate the energy change for the reaction:
Cl(g)
Chlorine atom
+ Cl– Na(g) Na + (g) +(g)
Sodium atom Sodium ion Chloride ion
Were we to simply add the ionization energy of 496 kJ/mol (119 kcal/mol) for sodium 
and the electron affinity of −349 kJ/mol (−83.4 kcal/mol) for chlorine, we would 
conclude that the overall process is endothermic by +147 kJ/mol (+35 kcal/mol). The 
energy liberated by adding an electron to chlorine is insufficient to override the energy 
required to remove an electron from sodium. This analysis, however, fails to consider 
the force of attraction between the oppositely charged ions Na+ and Cl−, as expressed 
in terms of the energy released in the formation of solid NaCl from the separated 
gas-phase ions:
Cl−(g)
Chloride ion
Na+(g) +
Sodium ion Sodium chloride
NaCl(s)
This lattice energy is 787 kJ/mol (188 kcal/mol) and is more than sufficient to make the 
overall process for formation of sodium chloride from the elements exothermic. Forces 
between charged particles are called electrostatic, or Coulombic, and constitute an ionic 
bond when they are attractive.
The SI (Système International 
d’Unités) unit of energy is the joule (J). 
An older unit is the calorie (cal). Many 
chemists still express energy changes 
in units of kilocalories per mole 
(1 kcal/mol = 4.184 kJ/mol).
Ionic bonding was proposed by the 
German physicist Walther Kossel in 
1916 in order to explain the ability of 
substances such as molten sodium 
chloride to conduct an electric 
current. Walther Kossel was the son of 
Albrecht Kossel, winner of the 1910 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
for early studies of nucleic acids.8 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Problem 1.5
What is the electron configuration of C+? Of C−? Does either one of these ions have a noble 
gas (closed-shell) electron configuration?
Ionic bonds are very common in inorganic compounds, but rare in organic ones. 
The ionization energy of carbon is too large and the electron affinity too small for carbon 
to realistically form a C4+ or C4− ion. What kinds of bonds, then, link carbon to other 
elements in millions of organic compounds? Instead of losing or gaining electrons, car￾bon shares electrons with other elements (including other carbon atoms) to give what 
are called covalent bonds.
1.3 Covalent Bonds, Lewis Formulas, and the Octet Rule
The covalent, or shared electron pair, model of chemical bonding was first suggested 
by G. N. Lewis of the University of California in 1916. Lewis proposed that a sharing
of two electrons by two hydrogen atoms permits each one to have a stable closed-shell 
electron configuration analogous to that of helium.

H H
The amount of energy required to dissociate a hydrogen molecule H2 to two sepa￾rate hydrogen atoms is its bond dissociation enthalpy. For H2 it is quite large, amounting 
to +435 kJ/mol (+104 kcal/mol). The main contributor to the strength of the covalent 
bond in H2 is the increased Coulombic force exerted on its two electrons. Each electron 
in H2 “feels” the attractive force of two nuclei, rather than one as it would in an isolated 
hydrogen atom.
Only the electrons in an atom’s valence shell are involved in covalent bonding. 
Fluorine, for example, has nine electrons, but only seven are in its valence shell. Pairing 
a valence electron of one fluorine atom with one of a second fluorine gives a fluorine 
molecule (F2) in which each fluorine has eight valence electrons and an electron con￾figuration equivalent to that of the noble gas neon. Shared electrons count toward satis￾fying the octet of both atoms.

The six valence electrons of each fluorine that are not involved in bonding comprise 
three unshared pairs.
Structural formulas such as those just shown for H2 and F2 where electrons are 
represented as dots are called Lewis formulas, or Lewis structures. It is usually more 
convenient to represent shared electron-pair bonds as lines and to sometimes omit elec￾tron pairs.
The Lewis model limits second-row elements (Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne) to a total 
of eight electrons (shared plus unshared) in their valence shells. Hydrogen is limited to 
two. Most of the elements that we’ll encounter in this text obey the octet rule: In form￾ing compounds they gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable electron configura￾tion characterized by eight valence electrons. When the octet rule is satisfied for carbon, 
nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine, each has an electron configuration analogous to that of 
the noble gas neon. The Lewis formulas of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), 
and hydrogen fluoride (HF) given in Table 1.2 illustrate the octet rule.
Gilbert Newton Lewis has been called 
the greatest American chemist.
Unshared pairs are also called lone 
pairs.1.3 Covalent Bonds, Lewis Formulas, and the Octet Rule 9
With four valence electrons, carbon normally forms four covalent bonds as shown 
in Table 1.2 for CH4. In addition to CH bonds, most organic compounds contain 
covalent CC bonds. Ethane (C2H6) is an example.

The ten covalent bonds in the Lewis formula shown account for 20 valence electrons, which 
is the same as that calculated from the molecular formula (C3H8). The eight hydrogens of 
C3H8 contribute 1 electron each and the three carbons 4 each, for a total of 20 (8 from the 
hydrogens and 12 from the carbons). Therefore, all the valence electrons are in covalent 
bonds; propane has no unshared pairs.
Lewis’s concept of shared electron-pair bonds allows for four-electron double bonds 
and six-electron triple bonds. Ethylene (C2H4) has 12 valence electrons, which can be

1.4 Polar Covalent Bonds, Electronegativity, 
and Bond Dipoles
Electrons in covalent bonds are not necessarily shared equally by the two atoms that they 
connect. If one atom has a greater tendency to attract electrons toward itself than the 
other, the electron distribution is polarized, and the bond is described as polar covalent.1.4 Polar Covalent Bonds, Electronegativity, and Bond Dipoles 11
The tendency of an atom to attract the electrons in a covalent bond toward itself defines 
its electronegativity. An electronegative element attracts electrons; an electropositive one 
donates them.
Hydrogen fluoride, for example, has a polar covalent bond. Fluorine is more elec￾tronegative than hydrogen and pulls the electrons in the HF bond toward itself, giving 
fluorine a partial negative charge and hydrogen a partial positive charge. Two ways of 
representing the polarization in HF are
(The symbols δ+ and δ−
indicate partial positive
and partial negative
charge, respectively)
δ+H Fδ− H F
(The symbol represents
the direction of polarization
of electrons in the H F bond)
A third way of illustrating the electron polarization in HF is graphically, by way of 
an electrostatic potential map, which uses the colors of the rainbow to show the charge 
distribution. Blue through red tracks regions of greater positive charge to greater negative 
charge. (For more details, see the boxed essay Electrostatic Potential Maps in this section.)

Increasing negative charge →

The colors in an electrostatic potential map indicate charge distribution in molecule
Contrast the electrostatic potential map of HF with those of H2 and F2.
H—H δ+ H—F δ− F—F
The covalent bond in H2 joins two hydrogen atoms. Because the bonded atoms are identi￾cal, so are their electronegativities. There is no polarization of the electron distribution, 
the HH bond is nonpolar, and a neutral yellow-green color dominates the electrostatic 
potential map. Likewise, the FF bond in F2 is nonpolar and its electrostatic potential 
map resembles that of H2. The covalent bond in HF, on the other hand, unites two atoms 
of different electronegativity, and the electron distribution is very polarized. Blue is the 
dominant color near the positively polarized hydrogen, and red the dominant color near 
the negatively polarized fluorine.
The most commonly used electronegativity scale was devised by Linus Pauling. 
Table 1.3 keys Pauling’s electronegativity values to the periodic table.
Electronegativity increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table. Of 
the second-row elements, the most electronegative is fluorine, the least electronegative 
is lithium. Electronegativity decreases going down a column. Of the halogens, fluorine 
is the most electronegative, then chlorine, then bromine, then iodine. Indeed, fluorine is 
the most electronegative of all the elements; oxygen is second.
In general, the greater the electronegativity difference between two elements, the 
more polar the bond between them.
Linus Pauling (1901–1994) was born in 
Portland, Oregon, and was educated 
at Oregon State University and at the 
California Institute of Technology. 
Pauling received a Ph.D. in chemistry 
in 1925. In addition to research in 
bonding theory, Pauling studied the 
structure of proteins and was awarded 
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for that 
work in 1954. Pauling won a second 
Nobel Prize (the Peace Prize) in 1962 
for efforts to limit the testing of 
nuclear weapons. Pauling was one of 
only four scientists to have won two 
Nobel Prizes. The first double winner 
was a woman, Marie Curie, who 
received Nobel Prizes in Physics 
(1903) and then in Chemistry (1911).12 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
All of the material in this text, and most of chemistry generally, 
can be understood on the basis of what physicists call the 
electromagnetic force. Its major principle is that opposite 
charges attract and like charges repel. A good way to connect 
structure to properties such as chemical reactivity is to find the 
positive part of one molecule and the negative part of another. 
Most of the time, these will be the reactive sites.
Imagine that you bring a positive charge toward a mol￾ecule. The interaction between that positive charge and some 
point in the molecule will be attractive if the point is nega￾tively charged, repulsive if it is positively charged, and the 
strength of the interaction will depend on the magnitude of 
the charge. Computational methods make it possible to calcu￾late and map these interactions. It is convenient to display this 
map using the colors of the rainbow from red to blue. Red is the 
negative (electron-rich) end and blue is the positive (electron￾poor) end.
The electrostatic potential map of hydrogen fluoride (HF) 
was shown previously in this section and is repeated here. 
Compare it with the electrostatic potential map of lithium 
hydride (LiH).
H F H Li
The HF bond is polarized so that hydrogen is partially positive 
(blue) and fluorine partially negative (red). Because hydrogen is 
more electronegative than lithium, the HLi bond is polarized in 
the opposite sense, making hydrogen partially negative (red) 
and lithium partially positive (blue).
We will use electrostatic potential maps often to illustrate 
charge distribution in both organic and inorganic molecules. 
However, we need to offer one cautionary note. Electrostatic 
potential mapping within a single molecule is fine, but we need 
to be careful when comparing maps of different molecules. The 
reason for this is that the entire red-to-blue palette is used to 
map the electrostatic potential regardless of whether the charge 
difference is large or small. This is apparent in the HF and 
HLi electrostatic potential maps just shown. If, as shown in the 
following map, we use the same range for HF that was used 
for HLi we see that H is green instead of blue and the red of F 
is less intense.
H F
Thus, electrostatic potential maps can give an exagger￾ated picture of the charge distribution when the entire palette 
of colors is used. In most cases, that won’t matter to us inas￾much as we are mostly concerned with the distribution within a 
single molecule. When we want to compare trends in a series 
of molecules, we’ll use a common scale and will point that 
out. For example, the electrostatic potentials of H2, F2, and HF 
that were compared on page 11 were mapped using the same 
color scale.

Problem 1.8
In which of the compounds CH4, NH3, H2O, SiH4, or H2S is δ+ for hydrogen the greatest? In 
which one does hydrogen bear a partial negative charge?
Table 1.4 compares the polarity of various bond types according to their bond 
dipole moments. A dipole exists whenever opposite charges are separated from each 
other, and a dipole moment μ is the product of the amount of the charge e multiplied 
by the distance d between the centers of charge.
μ = e × d
Because the charge on an electron is 4.80 × 10−10 electrostatic units (esu) and the dis￾tances within a molecule typically fall in the 10−8 cm range, molecular dipole moments 
are on the order of 10−18 esu·cm. To simplify the reporting of dipole moments, this value 
of 10−18 esu·cm is defined as a debye, D. Thus the experimentally determined dipole 
moment of hydrogen fluoride, 1.7 × 10−18 esu·cm, is stated as 1.7 D.
The bond dipoles in Table 1.4 depend on the difference in electronegativity of the 
bonded atoms and on the bond distance. The polarity of a CH bond is relatively low; 
substantially less than a CO bond, for example. Don’t lose sight of an even more 
important difference between a CH bond and a CO bond, and that is the direction
of the dipole moment. In a CH bond the electrons are drawn away from H, toward C. 
In a CO bond, electrons are drawn from C toward O. As we’ll see in later chapters, 
the kinds of reactions that a substance undergoes can often be related to the size and 
direction of key bond dipoles.

1.5 Formal Charge
Lewis formulas frequently contain atoms that bear a positive or negative charge. If the 
molecule as a whole is neutral, the sum of its positive charges must equal the sum of its 
negative charges. An example is nitromethane CH3NO2.
The debye unit is named in honor of 
Peter Debye, a Dutch scientist who 
did important work in many areas of 
chemistry and physics and was 
awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
in 1936.

As written, the Lewis formula for nitromethane shows one of the oxygens doubly bonded 
to nitrogen while the other is singly bonded. The octet rule is satisfied for nitrogen, 
carbon, and both oxygens. Carbon, the three hydrogens, and the doubly bonded oxygen 
are uncharged, but nitrogen bears a charge of +1 and the singly bonded oxygen a charge 
of −1. These charges are called formal charges and are required for the Lewis formula 
of nitromethane to be complete.
Formal charges correspond to the difference between the number of valence 
electrons in the neutral free atom and the number of valence electrons in its bonded 
state. The number of electrons in the neutral free atom is the same as the atom’s group 
number in the periodic table. To determine the electron count of an atom in a Lewis 
formula, we add the total number of electrons in unshared pairs to one-half the number 
of electrons in bonded pairs. It’s important to note that counting electrons to assign 
a formal charge differs from counting electrons to see if the octet rule is satisfied. A 
second-row element has a complete octet if the sum of all the electrons around it, 
shared and unshared, is eight. When counting the electrons to assign formal charge, 
half the number of electrons in covalent bonds are assigned to each atom.
Figure 1.5 applies this procedure to the calculation of formal charges in nitro￾methane. Starting with the three hydrogens, we see that each is associated with two 
electrons, giving each an electron count of _1
2 (2) = 1. Because a neutral hydrogen atom 
has one electron, the hydrogens of nitromethane have no formal charge. Similarly for 
carbon, the electron count is _1
2 (8) = 4, which is the number of electrons on a neutral 
carbon atom, so carbon has no formal charge in nitromethane.
Moving to nitrogen, we see that it has four covalent bonds, so its electron count is _1
2 (8) = 4, which is one less than the number of valence electrons of a nitrogen atom; 
therefore, its formal charge is +1. The doubly bonded oxygen has an electron count of 
six (four electrons from the two unshared pairs + two from the double bond). An electron 
count of six is the same as that of a neutral oxygen’s valence electrons; therefore, the 
doubly bonded oxygen has no formal charge. The singly bonded oxygen, however, has 
an electron count of seven: six for the three nonbonded pairs plus one for the single bond 
to nitrogen. This total is one more than the number of valence electrons of a neutral 
oxygen, so the formal charge is −1.
The method described for calculating formal charge has been one of reasoning 
through a series of logical steps. It can be reduced to the following equation:
Formal charge = Group number in periodic table − Electron count
where
Electron count = _1
2 (Number of shared electrons) + Number of unshared electrons
It will always be true that a covalently 
bonded hydrogen has no formal 
charge (formal charge = 0).
It will always be true that a nitrogen 
with four covalent bonds has a formal 
charge of +1. (A nitrogen with four 
covalent bonds cannot have unshared 
pairs, according to the octet rule.)
It will always be true that an oxygen 
with two covalent bonds and two 
unshared pairs has no formal charge.
It will always be true that an oxygen 
with one covalent bond and three 
unshared pairs has a formal charge 
of −1.

So far we’ve only considered neutral molecules—those in which the sums of the

Ammonium cation and borohydride anion, for example, are ions with net charges of +1 
and −1, respectively. Nitrogen has a formal charge of +1 in ammonium ion, and boron 
has a formal charge of −1 in borohydride. None of the hydrogens in the Lewis formulas

1.5 Formal Charge 1516 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Determining formal charges on individual atoms in Lewis formulas is an 
important element in good “electron bookkeeping.” So much of organic chemistry 
can be made more understandable by keeping track of electrons that it is worth 
taking some time at the beginning to become proficient at the seemingly simple 
task of counting them.
1.6 Structural Formulas of Organic Molecules: Isomers
Most organic compounds are more complicated than the examples we’ve seen so far and 
require a more systematic approach to writing structural formulas for them. The approach 
outlined in Table 1.5 begins (step 1) with the molecular formula that tells us which 
TABLE 1.5 A Systematic Approach to Writing Lewis Formulas
Step Illustration
1. The molecular formula is determined experimentally. Ethanol and dimethyl ether both have the molecular formula 
C2H6O.
2. Based on the molecular formula, count the number of 
valence electrons.
In C2H6O, each hydrogen contributes 1 valence electron, 
each carbon contributes 4, and oxygen contributes 6 for 
a total of 20.
3. Given the connectivity, connect bonded atoms by a shared 
electron-pair bond (:) represented by a dash ().
Oxygen and the two carbons are connected in the order CCO in 
ethanol and COC in dimethyl ether. The connectivity and the fact 
that carbon normally has four bonds in neutral molecules allow 
us to place the hydrogens of ethanol and dimethyl ether.

Ethanol Dimethyl ether
4. Count the number of electrons in the bonds (twice the 
number of bonds), and subtract this from the total number 
of valence electrons to give the number of electrons that 
remain to be added.
The structural formulas in step 3 contain eight bonds, accounting 
for 16 electrons. Because C2H6O contains 20 valence electrons, 
4 more are needed.
5. Add electrons in pairs so that as many atoms as possible 
have eight electrons. It is usually best to begin with the 
most electronegative atom. (Hydrogen is limited to two 
electrons.)
Under no circumstances can a second-row element such as 
C, N, or O have more than eight valence electrons.
Both carbons already have complete octets in the structures 
illustrated in step 3. The remaining four electrons are added to 
each oxygen as two unshared pairs to complete its octet. The 
Lewis structures are:

6. If one or more atoms (excluding hydrogens) have fewer than 
eight electrons, use an unshared pair from an adjacent atom to 
form a double or triple bond to complete the octet. Use one 
double bond for each deficiency of two electrons to complete 
the octet for each atom.
All the carbon and oxygen atoms in the structural formulas of 
ethanol and dimethyl ether have complete octets. No double 
bonds are needed.
7. Calculate formal charges. None of the atoms in the Lewis formulas shown in step 5 bears a 
formal charge.1.6 Structural Formulas of Organic Molecules: Isomers 17
atoms and how many of each are present in the compound. From the molecular formula 
we calculate the number of valence electrons (step 2).
In step 3 we set out a partial structure that shows the order in which the atoms 
are connected. This is called the connectivity of the molecule and is almost always 
determined by experiment. Most of the time carbon has four bonds, nitrogen has three, 
and oxygen two. It frequently happens in organic chemistry that two or more different 
compounds have the same molecular formula, but different connectivities. Ethanol and 
dimethyl ether—the examples shown in the table—are different compounds with different 
properties, yet have the same molecular formula (C2H6O). Ethanol is a liquid with 
a boiling point of 78°C. Dimethyl ether is a gas at room temperature; its boiling point 
is −24°C.
Different compounds that have the same molecular formula are classified as isomers.
Isomers can be either constitutional isomers (differ in connectivity) or stereoisomers
(differ in arrangement of atoms in space). Constitutional isomers are also sometimes called 
structural isomers. Ethanol and dimethyl ether are constitutional isomers of each other. 
Stereoisomers will be introduced in Section 3.11.
The framework of covalent bonds revealed by the connectivity information accounts 
for 16 of the 20 valence electrons in C2H6O (step 4). The remaining four valence elec￾trons are assigned to each oxygen as two unshared pairs in step 5 to complete the Lewis 
formulas of ethanol and dimethyl ether.
Problem 1.13
Write structural formulas for all the constitutional isomers that have the given molecular formula.
(a) C2H7N (b) C3H7Cl (c) C3H8O
Sample Solution (a) The molecular formula C2H7N requires 20 valence electrons. Two 
carbons contribute a total of eight, nitrogen contributes five, and seven hydrogens 
contribute a total of seven. Nitrogen and two carbons can be connected in the order 
CCN or CNC. Assuming four bonds to each carbon and three to nitrogen, we write these 
connectivities as

These two are constitutional isomers.
The suffix -mer in the word “isomer” is 
derived from the Greek word meros,
meaning “part,” “share,” or “portion.” 
The prefix iso- is also from Greek 
(isos, meaning “the same”). Thus 
isomers are different molecules that 
have the same parts (elemental 
composition).18 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Now let’s consider a slightly more complex molecule, methyl nitrite, in which 
we have to include multiple bonds when writing the Lewis structure (step 6). Methyl 
nitrite has the molecular formula CH3NO2 and is a constitutional isomer of nitromethane 
(Section 1.5). All the hydrogens are attached to the carbon, and the order of atom 
connections is CONO. First count the number of valence electrons.

O N O
Each hydrogen contributes 1 valence electron, carbon 4, nitrogen 5, and each 
oxygen 6, for a total of 24. The partial structure shown contains 6 bonds equivalent to 
12 electrons, so another 12 electrons must be added. Add these 12 electrons in pairs to 
oxygen and nitrogen. Both oxygens will end up with eight electrons, but nitrogen, because 
it is less electronegative, will have only six.
H C

All atoms have complete octets except nitrogen, which has a deficiency of two 
electrons. Use an electron pair from the terminal oxygen to form a double bond to nitro￾gen to complete its octet. The resulting structure is the best (most stable) for methyl 
nitrite. All atoms (except hydrogen) have eight electrons in their valence shell.

O N O
You may wonder why the electron pair from the terminal oxygen and not the 
oxygen in the middle was used to form the double bond to nitrogen in the Lewis struc￾ture. The structure that would result from using the electron pair on the middle oxygen 
has a separation of a positive and a negative charge. Although the resulting Lewis 
structure satisfies the octet rule, its charge separation makes it less stable than the other. 
When two or more Lewis structures satisfy the octet rule, we need to know how to 
choose the one that best represents the true structure. Section 1.7 describes a procedure 
for doing this.

Nitrosomethane and formaldoxime both have the molecular formula CH3NO and the

formulas for (a) nitrosomethane and (b) formaldoxime that satisfy the octet rule and are free 
of charge separation.Sample Solution 
As illustrated for diethyl ether, chemists often find condensed formulas and line

The structural language of organic chemistry has been developed so that complex 
molecules can be described in a clear, yet economical way. A molecule as complex as 
cholesterol can be drawn rapidly in a bond-line formula, while drawing even a condensed 
formula would require a prohibitive amount of time.

Curved Arrows and “Electron Pushing”
Arrow symbols used in organic chemistry have precise mean￾ings. Think about mathematical symbols. The symbol “<” 
looks like the symbol “>” but the meanings of the two symbols 
are different. That is,
[a < b] is not the same as [a > b].
Arrows are used in organic chemistry to symbolize dif￾ferent concepts. In Chapter 1, we find reaction arrows ( ) 
and curved arrows ( ). Reaction arrows that designate 
reactants and products are used in general chemistry courses, 
but curved arrows are usually first encountered in an organic 
chemistry course. Organic chemists have a precise use for 
curved arrows! 
A curved arrow denotes the movement and the direc￾tion of movement of an electron pair.
An electron pair (and electron density) moves from the 
“tail” of the arrow to the “head” of the arrow. Consider the exam￾ple of the BO bond breaking in the reaction
F B +
F
F
− O O F
F
F
B
The curved arrow indicates the reactant’s BO bonding 
electron pair is becoming one of the product’s oxygen atom 
nonbonding electron pairs. This movement results in products 
where the boron and oxygen atoms are without formal 
charges.
Now consider the reaction of methylamine with hydro￾nium ion.

The left curved arrow in the reactants denotes a nitrogen 
lone electron pair forming a covalent bond to hydrogen. The 
right curved arrow denotes the pair of electrons in the HO 
bond, forming a nonbonding electron pair on the oxygen. The 
positive formal charge also moves from oxygen in the reactants 
to nitrogen in the products. 
If we drew the arrows facing the other direction, we 
would be trying to indicate that electron density from the 
hydrogen of the positively charged hydronium ion was moving 
to form a bond with methylamine’s nitrogen which already has 
an octet of electrons! This arrow is wrong!! Just as changing 
the direction of the mathematical symbol “<” to “>” changes 
the meaning, changing the direction of an arrow changes its 
meaning. 
Mastering the pushing of electrons using arrows is 
essential for mastering organic chemistry. Throughout the 
text, you will find numerous examples of curved arrows to push 
electrons. Sections 1.7 and 1.11 delve further into their use.
There are several types of arrows that you will become 
acquainted with as we proceed through a year of organic 
chemistry. A selected list of these arrows with their meanings is 
given below.
Full arrow, curved, indicates a two electron movement
in the direction of the arrowhead (Section 1.11).
Single-barbed, or fishhook arrow, curved, indicates 
a one-electron movement in the direction of the 
arrowhead (Chapter 10).
Double-headed arrow denotes resonance 
structures (Section 1.7).
Straight arrow denotes a reaction proceeding in the 
direction of the arrowhead.
Reactants and products in equilibrium.

1.7 Resonance and Arrows
Sometimes more than one Lewis formula can be written for a molecule, especially if the 
molecule contains a double or triple bond. A simple example is ozone (O3), for which 
we can write
O
O O
+
−
This Lewis formula, however, is inconsistent with the experimentally determined 
structure. On the basis of the Lewis formula, we would expect ozone to have two 
different OO bond lengths, one of them similar to the OO single bond distance of 
147 pm (1.47 Å) in hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) and the other similar to the 121 pm 
(1.21 Å) double bond distance in O2. In fact, both bond distances are the same 
(128  pm, 1.28 Å)—somewhat shorter than a single bond, somewhat longer than a 
double bond. The structure of ozone requires that the central oxygen must be identically 
bonded to both terminal oxygens.
An electrostatic potential map shows the equivalence of the two terminal oxygens. 
Notice, too, that the central oxygen is blue (positively charged) and both terminal oxygens 
are red (negatively charged).
To deal with circumstances such as the bonding in ozone, yet retain Lewis for￾mulas as a useful tool for representing molecular structure, the notion of resonance
was developed. According to the resonance concept, when two or more Lewis formu￾las that differ only in the distribution of electrons can be written for a molecule, no 
single Lewis formula is sufficient to describe the true electron distribution. The true 
structure is said to be a resonance hybrid of the various Lewis formulas, called 
contributing structures, that can be written for the molecule. In the case of ozone, 
the two Lewis formulas are equivalent and contribute equally to the resonance hybrid. 
We use a double-headed arrow to signify resonance and read it to mean that the 
Ozone occurs naturally in large 
quantities in the upper atmosphere 
where it screens the surface of Earth 
from much of the sun’s ultraviolet rays.
We will express bond distances in 
both picometers (pm) and angstroms, 
a unit commonly used by organic 
chemists. Picometer is an SI unit 
(1 pm = 10−12 m). To convert pm to 
angstrom units (1 Å = 10−10 m), 
divide by 100.22 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Lewis formulas shown contribute to, but do not separately describe, the electron dis￾tribution in the molecule.

Resonance attempts to correct a fundamental defect in Lewis formulas. Lewis 
formulas show electrons as being localized; they either are shared between two atoms 
in a covalent bond or are unshared electrons belonging to a single atom. In reality, 
electrons distribute themselves in the way that leads to their most stable arrangement. 
This means that a pair of electrons can be delocalized, or shared by several nuclei. 
In the case of ozone, resonance attempts to show the delocalization of four electrons 
(an unshared pair of one oxygen plus two of the electrons in the double bond) over 
the three oxygens.
It is important to remember that the double-headed resonance arrow does not
indicate a process in which contributing Lewis formulas interconvert. Ozone, for example, 
has a single structure; it does not oscillate back and forth between two contributors. An 
average of the two Lewis formulas is sometimes drawn using a dashed line to represent 
a “partial” bond. In the dashed-line notation the central oxygen is linked to the other two 
by bonds that are halfway between a single bond and a double bond, and the terminal 
oxygens each bear one half of a unit negative charge. The structure below represents the 
resonance hybrid for ozone.

Writing the various Lewis formulas that contribute to a resonance hybrid can be 
made easier by using curved arrows to keep track of delocalized electrons. We can 
convert one Lewis formula of ozone to another by moving electron pairs as shown:

Curved arrows show the origin and destination of a pair of electrons. In the case of 
ozone, one arrow begins at an unshared pair and becomes the second half of a double 
bond. The other begins at a double bond and becomes an unshared pair of the other 
oxygen.
Problem 1.16
All of the bonds in the carbonate ion (CO3
2−) are between C and O. Write Lewis formulas 
for the major resonance contributors, and use curved arrows to show their relationship. 
Apply the resonance concept to explain why all of the CO bond distances in carbonate 
are equal.
In most cases, the various resonance structures of a molecule are not equivalent 
and do not contribute equally to the resonance hybrid. The electron distribution in the 
molecule resembles that of its major contributor more closely than any of its alternative 
resonance structures. Therefore, it is important that we develop some generalizations 
concerning the factors that make one resonance form more important (more stable) than 
another. Table 1.6 outlines the structural features that alert us to situations when reso￾nance needs to be considered and lists criteria for evaluating the relative importance of 
the contributing structures.
Resonance is indicated by a double￾headed arrow ⟷; equilibria are 
described by two arrows ⇌.
The main use of curved arrows is to 
show electron flow in chemical 
reactions and will be described in 
Section 1.11. The technique is also 
known as “arrow pushing” and is 
attributed to the English chemist 
Sir Robert Robinson.1.7 Resonance and Arrows 23

I. When can resonance be considered?
1. The connectivity must be the same in all 
contributing structures; only the electron 
positions may vary among the various 
contributing structures. Atom movement is

formal charges of individual atoms may vary among 
the various Lewis formulas.
Structures A, C, and D (preceding example) all have 18 valence electrons 
and a net charge of 0, even though they differ in respect to formal charges 
on individual atoms. Structure E has 20 valence electrons and a net charge 
of −2. It is not a resonance structure of A, C, or D.

has two unpaired electrons; all the electrons in A, C, and D are paired.

second-row elements, the contributing structure 
with the greater number of covalent bonds 
contributes more to the resonance hybrid. 
Maximizing the number of bonds and satisfying 
the octet rule normally go hand in hand. This 
rule is more important than rules 6 and 7.

The structure on the right is more stable because it has one more covalent bond than the

octet rule is satisfied for both carbon and oxygen in the new structure.
It is good chemical practice to represent molecules by their most stable contributing 
structure. However, the ability to write alternative resonance forms and to assess their rela￾tive contributions can provide insight into both molecular structure and chemical behavior.

6. When two or more structures satisfy the octet rule, 
the major contributor is the one with the smallest 
separation of oppositely charged atoms.

on the least electronegative element.

In O the negative charge is on nitrogen. Oxygen is more electronegative

III. What is the effect of resonance?
8. Electron delocalization stabilizes a molecule. 
Resonance is a way of showing electron 
delocalization. Therefore, the true electron distribution 
is more stable than any of the contributing structures. 
The degree of stabilization is greatest when the 
contributing structures are of equal stability.
Structures P, Q, and R for carbonate ion are equivalent and contribute 
equally to the electron distribution. The true structure of carbonate ion is a 
hybrid of P, Q, and R and is more stable than any of them.

1.8 Sulfur and Phosphorus-Containing Organic 
Compounds and the Octet Rule
Applying the Lewis rules to compounds that contain a third-row element such as sulfur 
is sometimes complicated by a conflict between minimizing charge separation and 
following the octet rule. Consider the two structural formulas A and B for dimethyl 
sulfoxide:
H3C CH3
S
O
A
H3C CH3
S
O
B
According to resonance, A and B are contributing structures, and the actual structure 
is a hybrid of both. The octet rule favors A, but maximizing bonding and eliminating 
charge separation favor B. The justification for explicitly considering B is that sulfur 
has vacant 3d orbitals that permit it to accommodate more than eight electrons in its 
valence shell.
The situation is even more pronounced in dimethyl sulfone in which structural 
formula C has 8 electrons in sulfur’s valence shell, D has 10, and E has 12.

There is no consensus regarding which Lewis formula is the major contributor in these and 
related sulfur-containing compounds. The IUPAC recommends writing double bonds rather 
than dipolar single bonds; that is, B for dimethyl sulfoxide and E for dimethyl sulfone.
Similarly, compounds with four atoms or groups bonded to phosphorus can be repre￾sented by contributing structures of the type F and G shown for trimethylphosphine oxide.

Phosphorus shares 8 electrons in F, 10 in G. The octet rule favors F; involvement of

G, but both formulas have been used. Many biochemically important compounds—
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), for example—are phosphates and can be written with 
either a PO or +PO− unit. The same recommendation applies to them; the double￾bonded structure is preferred.

1.9 Molecular Geometries
So far we have emphasized structure in terms of “electron bookkeeping.” We now turn our 
attention to molecular geometry and will see how we can begin to connect the three-dimen￾sional shape of a molecule to its Lewis formula. Table 1.7 lists some simple compounds 
illustrating the geometries that will be seen most often in our study of organic chemistry.
As shown in Table 1.7, methane (CH4) has a tetrahedral geometry. Each hydrogen 
occupies a corner of the tetrahedron with the carbon at its center. The table also shows 
a common method of representing three-dimensionality through the use of different bond 
styles. A solid wedge ( ) stands for a bond that projects toward you, a “hashed” wedge 
( ) for one that points away from you, and a simple line () for a bond that lies in the 
plane of the paper.

Linear Linear1.9 Molecular Geometries 27
The tetrahedral geometry of methane is often explained with the valence shell 
electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model. The VSEPR model rests on the idea that an 
electron pair, either a bonded pair or an unshared pair, associated with a particular atom 
will be as far away from the atom’s other electron pairs as possible. Thus, a tetrahedral 
geometry permits the four bonds of methane to be maximally separated and is character￾ized by HCH angles of 109.5°, a value referred to as the tetrahedral angle.
Water, ammonia, and methane share the common feature of an approximately tetra￾hedral arrangement of four electron pairs. Because we describe the shape of a molecule 
according to the positions of its atoms only rather than by the orientation of its electron 
pairs, water is said to be bent, and ammonia is trigonal pyramidal.
The HOH angle in water (105°) and the HNH angles in ammonia (107°) 
are slightly smaller than the tetrahedral angle. These bond-angle contractions are easily 
accommodated by VSEPR by reasoning that bonded pairs take up less space than unshared 
pairs. A bonded pair feels the attractive force of two nuclei and is held more tightly than 
an unshared pair localized on a single atom. Thus, repulsive forces increase in the order:
Bonded pair vs.
Bonded pair
Unshared pair vs.
Bonded pair < < Unshared pair vs.
Unshared pair
Repulsive forces depend on electron pair types
Least repulsive
Increasing force of repulsion →
Most repulsive
Repulsions among the four bonded pairs of methane give the normal tetrahedral 
angle of 109.5°. Repulsions among the unshared pair of nitrogen in ammonia and the 
three bonded pairs cause the bonded pair-bonded pair HNH angles to be smaller 
than 109.5°. In water, a larger repulsive force exists because of two unshared pairs, and 
the HOH angle is compressed further to 105°.
Boron trifluoride is a trigonal planar molecule. There are six electrons, two for 
each BF bond, associated with the valence shell of boron. These three bonded pairs 
are farthest apart when they are coplanar, with FBF bond angles of 120°.
Problem 1.20
Sodium borohydride, NaBH4, has an ionic bond between Na+ and the anion BH4
−. What are 
the HBH angles in borohydride anion?
A multiple bond (double or triple) is treated as a unit in the VSEPR model. Form￾aldehyde is a trigonal planar molecule in which the electrons of the double bond and 
those of the two single bonds are maximally separated. A linear arrangement of atoms 
in carbon dioxide allows the electrons in one double bond to be as far away as possible 
from the electrons in the other double bond.

Hydrogen cyanide

Ammonium ion
(b)
Azide ion
(c)
Carbonate ion
(d)
Sample Solution (a) The structure shown accounts for all the electrons in hydrogen cyanide. 
No unshared electron pairs are associated with carbon, and so the structure is determined by 
maximizing the separation between its single bond to hydrogen and the triple bond to nitrogen. 
Hydrogen cyanide is a linear molecule.
Although reservations have been 
expressed concerning VSEPR as an 
explanation for molecular geometries, 
it remains a useful tool for predicting 
the shapes of organic compounds.28 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Molecular Models and Modeling
We can gain a clearer idea about the features that affect struc￾ture and reactivity when we examine the three-dimensional 
shape of a molecule, using either a physical model or a graphical 
one. In the nineteenth century, physical molecular models were 
developed from experimental observations. Molecular models, 
combined with experimental data, proved their worth in two of the 
pioneering scientific achievements of the mid-twentieth century—
Linus Pauling’s protein α-helix and Watson–Crick’s DNA structure. 
Models alone were insufficient to deduce DNA’s structure, but 
combined with the precise experimental discoveries from Rosalind 
Franklin, including her now-famous X-ray image, “Photograph 51,” 
the double-helical structure of DNA was elucidated.
biochemistry, and molecular biology. At its lowest level, computer 
graphics substitutes for a physical molecular modeling kit. It is a 
simple matter to assemble atoms into a specified molecule, then 
display it in a variety of orientations and formats. Three of these 
formats are illustrated for methane in Figure 1.6. The most familiar 
are ball-and-stick models (Figure 1.6b), which direct attention to both 
the atoms and the bonds that connect them. Framework models 
(Figure 1.6a) and space-filling models (Figure 1.6c) represent oppo￾site extremes. Framework models emphasize a molecule’s bonds 
while ignoring the sizes of the atoms. Space-filling models empha￾size the volume occupied by individual atoms at the cost of a clear 
depiction of the bonds; they are most useful in those cases where 
we wish to examine the overall molecular shape and to assess 
how closely nonbonded atoms approach each other.
Collections such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are freely 
available on the Internet along with viewers for manipulating the 
models. As of 2015 the PDB contains experimentally obtained 
structural data for more than 105,000 “biological macromolecu￾lar structures”—mainly proteins—and serves as a resource for 
scientists seeking to understand the structure and function of 
important biomolecules. Figure 1.7 shows a model of human 
insulin in a display option in which the two chains are shown as 
ribbons of different colors.
Computational chemistry takes model making to a yet 
higher level. Most modeling software also incorporates pro￾grams that identify the most stable geometry of a molecule by 
calculating the energies of possible candidate structures. More 
than this, the electron distribution in a molecule can be calcu￾lated and displayed as described in the boxed essay Electro￾static Potential Maps (see Section 1.4).
Molecular models of various types are used throughout 
this text. Their number and variety of applications testify to their 
importance in communicating the principles and applications of 
molecular structure in organic chemistry.

1.10 Molecular Dipole Moments
We can combine our knowledge of molecular geometry with a feel for the polarity of 
chemical bonds to predict whether a molecule has a dipole moment or not. The molecular 
dipole moment is the resultant of all of the individual bond dipole moments of a sub￾stance. Some molecules, such as carbon dioxide, have polar bonds, but lack a dipole 
moment because their geometry causes the individual CO bond dipoles to cancel.
Carbon dioxide
O C O Dipole moment = 0 D
Carbon tetrachloride, with four polar CCl bonds and a tetrahedral shape, has no net 
dipole moment, because the result of the four bond dipoles, as shown in Figure 1.8, is 
zero. Dichloromethane, on the other hand, has a dipole moment of 1.62 D. The CH 
bond dipoles reinforce the CCl bond dipoles.

The opening paragraphs of this chapter emphasized that the connection between 
structure and properties is central to understanding organic chemistry. We have just seen 
one such connection. From the Lewis formula of a molecule, we can use electronegativity 
to tell us about the polarity of bonds and combine that with VSEPR to predict whether 
the molecule has a dipole moment. In Sections 1.11–1.15, we’ll see a connection between 
structure and chemical reactivity as we review acids and bases.

1.11 Curved Arrows, Arrow Pushing, and Chemical Reactions
In Section 1.7 we introduced curved arrows as a tool for systematically converting one 
resonance contributor to another. Another common use is to track electron flow in chemi￾cal reactions. The remainder of this chapter introduces acid–base chemistry and illustrates 
how curved-arrow notation enhances our understanding of chemical reactions by focusing 
on electron movement.
There are two kinds of curved arrows. A double-barbed arrow ( ) shows the 
movement of a pair of electrons, either a bonded pair or a lone pair. A single-barbed, 
or fishhook, arrow ( ) shows the movement of one electron. For now, we’ll concern 
ourselves only with reactions that involve electron pairs and focus on double-barbed 
arrows.
We’ll start with some simple examples—reactions involving only one electron pair. 
Suppose the molecule AB dissociates to cation A+ and anion B−. A chemical equation 
for this ionization could be written as
AB A+ + B−
Alternatively, we could write
A B A+ + B−
The reaction is the same but the second equation provides more information by including 
the bond that is broken during ionization and showing the flow of electrons. The curved 
arrow begins where the electrons are originally—in the bond—and points to atom B as 
their destination where they become an unshared pair of the anion B−.
Dissociations of this type are common in organic chemistry and will be encountered 
frequently as we proceed through the text. In many cases, the species A+ has its positive 
charge on carbon and is referred to as a carbocation. Dissociation of an alkyl bromide, 
for example, involves breaking a CBr bond with the two electrons in that bond becoming 
an unshared pair of bromide ion.
Br
+ Br

Charge is conserved, as it must be in all reactions. Here, the reactant is uncharged, and 
the net charge on the products is 0. In a conceptually related dissociation, a net charge 
of +1 is conserved when a positively charged reactant dissociates to a carbocation and 
a neutral molecule.

Water is one product of the reaction. The organic species produced is a cation. Its central 
carbon has six electrons in its valence shell and a formal charge of +1. Charge is conserved 
in the reaction. The net charge on both the left and right side of the equation is +1.
The reverse of a dissociation is a combination, such as the formation of a covalent 
bond between a cation A+ and an anion :B−.
A + B A B
Here the tail of the curved arrow begins at the middle of the unshared electron pair of 
:B− and the head points to the location of the new bond—in this case the open space 
just before A+. Electrons flow from sites of higher electron density to lower. The unshared 
electron pair of :B− becomes the shared pair in the AB bond.
Problem 1.24
Write equations, including curved arrows, describing the reverse reactions of Problem 1.23.
Sample Solution (a) First write the equation for the reverse process. Next, use a curved

unshared electron pair of oxygen in water.

An unshared electron pair of a negatively charged oxygen becomes a shared electron pair 
in a CO bond. Again, notice that electrons flow from electron-rich to electron-poor 
sites. Hydroxide ion is negatively charged and, therefore, electron-rich while the carbon 
of H3CBr is partially positive because of the polarization of the CBr bond (Section 1.4).
A very common process is the transfer of a proton from one atom to another as in 
the reaction that occurs when hydrogen bromide dissolves in water.

is involved. Examples include:

Before we conclude this section, we should emphasize an important point:
■ Resist the temptation to use curved arrows to show the movement of atoms. Curved 
arrows always show electron flow.
Although our eyes are drawn to the atoms when we look at a chemical equation, following 
the electrons provides a clearer understanding of how reactants become products.
1.12 Acids and Bases: The Brønsted–Lowry View
Acids and bases are a big part of organic chemistry, but the emphasis is much different 
from what you may be familiar with from your general chemistry course. Most of the 
attention in general chemistry is given to numerical calculations: pH, percent ionization, 
buffer problems, and so on. Some of this returns in organic chemistry, but mostly we 
are concerned with acids and bases as reactants, products, and catalysts in chemical 
reactions. We’ll start by reviewing some general ideas about acids and bases.
According to the theory proposed by Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist and 
winner of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, an acid is a substance that ionizes to give 
protons when dissolved in water; a base ionizes to give hydroxide ions.
A more general theory of acids and bases was devised by Johannes Brønsted 
(Denmark) and Thomas M. Lowry (England) in 1923. In the Brønsted–Lowry approach, 
an acid is a proton donor, and a base is a proton acceptor. The reaction that occurs 
between an acid and a base is proton transfer.

In the equation shown, the base uses an unshared pair of electrons to remove a proton 
from an acid. The base is converted to its conjugate acid, and the acid is converted to 
its conjugate base. A base and its conjugate acid always differ by a single proton. Like￾wise, an acid and its conjugate base always differ by a single proton.1.12 Acids and Bases: The Brønsted–Lowry View 33
In the Brønsted–Lowry view, an acid doesn’t dissociate in water; it transfers a 
proton to water. Water acts as a base.

(a) Ammonia (:NH3)
(b) Trimethylamine [(CH3)3N:]
Identify the acid, base, conjugate acid, and conjugate base and use curved arrows to track 
electron movement.
Sample Solution (a) We are told that a proton is transferred from HCl to :NH3. Therefore,

The strength of an acid is measured by its acidity constant Ka defined as
Ka = [H3O+][ A−]
[HA]
Even though water is a reactant (a Brønsted base), its concentration does not appear in 
the expression for Ka because it is the solvent. The convention for equilibrium constant 
expressions is to omit concentration terms for pure solids, liquids, and solvents.
Water can also be a Brønsted acid, donating a proton to a base. Sodium amide 
(NaNH2), for example, is a source of the strongly basic amide ion, which reacts with 
water to give ammonia.

Using curved arrows to track electron movement, write an equation for the reaction of 
hydride ion with water. What is the conjugate acid of hydride ion?34 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
A convenient way to express the strength of an acid is by its pKa, defined as
pKa = −log10Ka
Thus, acetic acid with Ka = 1.6 × 10−5 has a pKa of 4.8. The advantage of pKa over Ka
is that it avoids exponentials. You are probably more familiar with Ka, but most organic 
chemists and biochemists use pKa. It is a good idea to be comfortable with both systems, 
so you should practice converting Ka to pKa and vice versa.
Problem 1.28
Salicylic acid, the starting material for the preparation of aspirin, has a Ka of 1.06 × 10−3
. 
What is its pKa?
Problem 1.29
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) has a pKa of 9.2. What is its Ka?
Table 1.8 lists a number of acids, their acidity constants, and their conjugate 
bases. The list is more extensive than we need at this point, but we will return to it 
repeatedly throughout the text as new aspects of acid–base behavior are intro￾duced.  The table is organized so that acid strength decreases from top to bottom. 
Conversely, the strength of the conjugate base increases from top to bottom. Thus, 
the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. The stronger the base, the weaker 
its conjugate acid.
The Brønsted–Lowry approach involving conjugate relationships between acids and 
bases makes a separate basicity constant Kb unnecessary. Rather than having separate 
tables listing Ka for acids and Kb for bases, the usual practice is to give only Ka or pKa
as was done in Table 1.8. Assessing relative basicities requires only that we remember 
that the weaker the acid, the stronger the conjugate base and find the appropriate acid–base 
pair in the table.
Problem 1.30
Which is the stronger base in each of the following pairs? (Note: This information will prove 
useful when you get to Chapter 9.)
(a) Sodium ethoxide (NaOCH2CH3) or sodium amide (NaNH2)
(b) Sodium acetylide (NaCCH) or sodium amide (NaNH2)
(c) Sodium acetylide (NaCCH) or sodium ethoxide (NaOCH2CH3)
Sample Solution (a) NaOCH2CH3 contains the ions Na+ and CH3CH2O−. NaNH2 contains 
the ions Na+ and H2N−. CH3CH2O− is the conjugate base of ethanol; H2N− is the conjugate 
base of ammonia.
Base CH3CH2O− H2N−
Conjugate acid CH3CH2OH NH3
pKa of conjugate acid 16 38
The conjugate acid of CH3CH2O− is stronger than the conjugate acid of H2N−. Therefore, H2N−
is a stronger base than CH3CH2O−.1.12 Acids and Bases: The Brønsted–Lowry View 35

1.13 How Structure Affects Acid Strength
In this section we’ll introduce some generalizations that will permit us to connect molec￾ular structure with acidity in related compounds. The main ways in which structure 
affects acidity in solution depend on:
1. The strength of the bond to the atom from which the proton is lost
2. The electronegativity of the atom from which the proton is lost
3. Electron delocalization in the conjugate base
Bond Strength. The effect of bond strength is easy to see by comparing the acidities 
of the hydrogen halides.

Increasing acidity →
In general, bond strength decreases going down a group in the periodic table. As the 
halogen X becomes larger, the HX bond becomes longer and weaker and acid strength 
increases. This is the dominant factor in the series HCl, HBr, HI and also contributes to 
the relative weak acidity of HF.
With HF, a second factor concerns the high charge-to-size ratio of F−. Other things 
being equal, processes that give ions in which the electric charge is constrained to a small 
volume are less favorable than processes in which the charge is more spread out. The 
strong HF bond and the high charge-to-size ratio of F− combine to make HF the weak￾est acid of the hydrogen halides.
Because of the conjugate relationship between acidity and basicity, the strongest 
acid (HI) has the weakest conjugate base (I−), and the weakest acid (HF) has the strongest 
conjugate base (F−).

Bond strength is more important than electronegativity when comparing elements 
in the same group of the periodic table as the pKa’s for the hydrogen halides show. 
Fluorine is the most electronegative and iodine the least electronegative of the halogens, 
but HF is the weakest acid while HI is the strongest. Electronegativity is the more impor￾tant factor when comparing elements in the same row of the periodic table.

a greater degree of positive charge and 
is more acidic than the OH proton in 
ethanol. The color scale is the same in 
both maps.40 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
The conjugate base of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, the anion CF3CH2O−, is stabilized by its 
three fluorines, which attract electrons from the negatively charged oxygen, dispersing 
the negative charge. Because of this stabilization, the equilibrium for ionization of 
CF3CH2OH lies farther to the right than that of CH3CH2OH.
Structural effects that are transmitted through bonds are called inductive effects.
A substituent induces a polarization in the bonds between it and some remote site.
The same kind of inductive effects that make CF3CH2OH a stronger acid than CH3CH2OH 
makes the trifluoro derivative of acetic acid more than 4 pKa units stronger than acetic acid.

Hypochlorous and hypobromous acid (HOCl and HOBr) are weak acids. Write chemical

Inductive effects depend on the electronegativity of the substituent and the number 
of bonds between it and the affected site. As the number of bonds between the two units 
increases, the inductive effect decreases. For instance, the two butanoic acids differ in 
the placement of chlorines by two bonds and differ by more than 1.5 pKa units.

Electron Delocalization in the Conjugate Base. With a pKa of −1.4, nitric acid is 
almost completely ionized in water. If we look at the Lewis formula of nitric acid in light 
of what we have said about inductive effects, we can see why. The nitrogen atom in nitric acid 
is not only electronegative in its own right, but bears a formal charge of +1, which enhances 
its ability to attract electrons away from the OH group. But inductive effects are only part 
of the story. When nitric acid transfers its proton to water, nitrate ion is produced.

Organic chemistry involves a good bit of reasoning by analogy and looking for trends. 
At the beginning of this section we listed three ways that structure can affect acidity. The last 
two—electronegativity of the atom from which the proton is lost, and electron delocalization 
in the conjugate base—are both related to the stability of the conjugate base. A useful trend 
emerges: factors that stabilize the conjugate base increase the acidity of the parent acid.
1.14 Acid–Base Equilibria
In any proton-transfer reaction:
Acid + Base Conjugate acid + Conjugate base
we are concerned with the question of whether the position of equilibrium lies to the 
side of products or reactants. There is an easy way to determine this. The reaction pro￾ceeds in the direction that converts the stronger acid and the stronger base to the weaker 
acid and the weaker base.
Stronger acid + W Stronger base eaker acid + Weaker base
K > 1
This generalization can be stated even more simply. The reaction will be favorable when 
the stronger acid is on the left and the weaker acid is on the right. The equilibrium 
favors dissociation of the stronger acid.
Consider first the case of adding a strong acid such as HBr to water. The equation 
for the Brønsted acid–base reaction that occurs between them is:

H1.14 Acid–Base Equilibria 43
The acid on the left is HBr, which has a pKa of −8.8. The acid on the right is H3O+, which 
has a pKa of 0. The stronger acid (HBr) is on the left and the weaker acid (H3O+) is on 
the right, so the position of equilibrium lies to the right. The equilibrium constant Keq for 
an acid–base reaction is given by the ratio of the Ka of the reactant acid to the Ka of the 
product acid.
Keq = Ka of reactant acid _________________ Ka of product acid 
Since 10−pKa = Ka, we rewrite the expression as:
Keq = 10−pKa
____________________  of reactant acid 10−pKa
 of product acid 
and substitute the pKa values of HBr and H3O+ to calculate Keq.
Keq = 10_

This equilibrium constant is so large that we consider HBr to be completely ionized in water.
Compare the reaction of HBr with water to that of acetic acid with water.

Here, the weaker acid (acetic acid) is on the left and the stronger acid (hydronium ion)

lies far to the left.
Problem 1.39
What is the equilibrium constant for the following acid–base reactions?
(a) ammonia and acetic acid
(b) fluoride ion and acetic acid
(c) ethanol and hydrogen bromide
Sample Solution (a) Always start with an equation for an acid–base reaction. Ammonia is a 
Brønsted base and accepts a proton from the OH group of acetic acid. Ammonia is converted 
to its conjugate acid, and acetic acid to its conjugate base.

From their respective pKa’s, we see that acetic acid is a much stronger acid than ammonium 
ion. Therefore, the equilibrium lies to the right. The equilibrium constant for the process is

 of acetic acid (reactant) ___________________________ 10−pKa
 of ammonium ion (product) = 10_
−4.8
10−9.3 = 104.5
An unexpected fact emerges by working through this exercise. We see that although acetic acid is a 
weak acid and ammonia is a weak base, the acid–base reaction between them is virtually complete.44 Chapter 1 Structure Determines Properties
Two important points come from using relative pKa’s to analyze acid–base equilibria:
1. They permit clear-cut distinctions between strong and weak acids and bases. A 
strong acid is one that is stronger than H3O+. Conversely, a weak acid is one that 
is weaker than H3O+.
 Example: The pKa’s for the first and second ionizations of sulfuric acid are −9 
and 2.0, respectively. Sulfuric acid (HOSO2OH) is a strong acid; hydrogen sulfate 
ion (HOSO2O−) is a weak acid.
A strong base is one that is stronger than HO−.
 Example: A common misconception is that the conjugate base of a weak acid is 
strong. This is sometimes, but not always, true. It is true, for example, for ammonia, 
which is a very weak acid (pKa 38). Its conjugate base amide ion (H2N−) is a much 
stronger base than HO−. It is not true, however, for acetic acid; both acetic acid 
and its conjugate base acetate ion are weak. The conjugate base of a weak acid 
will be strong only when the acid is a weaker acid than water.
2. The strongest acid present in significant amounts at equilibrium after a strong acid 
is dissolved in water is H3O+. The strongest acid present in significant amounts 
when a weak acid is dissolved in water is the weak acid itself.
 Example: [H3O+] = 1.0 M in a 1.0 M aqueous solution of HBr. The concentration 
of undissociated HBr molecules is near zero. [H3O+] = 0.004 M in a 1.0 M aqueous 
solution of acetic acid. The concentration of undissociated acetic acid molecules is 
near 1.0 M. Likewise, HO− is the strongest base that can be present in significant 
quantities in aqueous solution.
Problem 1.40
Rank the following in order of decreasing concentration in a solution prepared by dissolving 
1.0 mol of sulfuric acid in enough water to give 1.0 L of solution. (It is not necessary to do 
any calculations.)
H2SO4, HSO4
−, SO4
2−, H3O+
Analyzing acid–base reactions according to the Brønsted–Lowry picture provides 
yet another benefit. Table 1.8, which lists acids according to their strength in descending 
order along with their conjugate bases, can be used to predict the direction of proton 
transfer. Acid–base reactions in which a proton is transferred from an acid to a base that 
lies below it in the table have favorable equilibrium constants. Proton transfers from an 
acid to a base that lies above it in the table are unfavorable. Thus, the equilibrium con￾stant for proton transfer from phenol to hydroxide ion is greater than 1, but that for proton 
transfer from phenol to hydrogen carbonate ion is less than 1.

The practical consequence of the reactions shown is that NaOH is a strong enough base

Problem 1.41
Verify that the position of equilibrium for the reaction between phenol and hydroxide ion lies 
to the right by comparing the pKa of the acid on the left to the acid on the right. Which acid 
is stronger? Do the same for the reaction of phenol with hydrogen carbonate ion.
1.15 Acids and Bases: The Lewis View
The same G. N. Lewis who gave us electron dot formulas also suggested a way to classify 
acids and bases that is more general than the Brønsted–Lowry approach. Where Brønsted 
and Lowry viewed acids and bases as donors and acceptors of protons (positively charged), 
Lewis took the opposite view and focused on electron pairs (negatively charged). According 
to Lewis, an acid is an electron-pair acceptor, and a base is an electron-pair donor.
A + +
Lewis acid
B−
Lewis base
A B
An unshared pair of electrons from the Lewis base is used to form a covalent bond between 
the Lewis acid and the Lewis base. The Lewis acid and the Lewis base are shown as ions 
in the equation, but they need not be. If both are neutral molecules, the corresponding 
equation becomes:
A +
Lewis acid
B
Lewis base
A B − +
We can illustrate this latter case by the reaction:

The product of this reaction, a Lewis acid/Lewis base complex called informally “boron 
trifluoride etherate,” may look unusual but it is a stable species with properties different from 
those of the reactants. Its boiling point (126°C), for example, is much higher than that of boron 
trifluoride—a gas with a boiling point of −100°C—and diethyl ether, a liquid that boils at 34°C.
Problem 1.42
Write an equation for the Lewis acid/Lewis base reaction between boron trifluoride and each of 
the following. Use curved arrows to track the flow of electrons and show formal charges if present.

(b) Dimethyl sulfide [(CH3)2S]

Recall that the carbon atom of carbon dioxide bears a partial positive charge because of 
the electron-attracting power of its attached oxygens. When hydroxide ion (the Lewis 
base) bonds to this positively polarized carbon, a pair of electrons in the carbon–oxygen 
double bond leaves carbon to become an unshared pair of oxygen.
Lewis bases use an unshared pair to form a bond to some other atom and are also referred 
to as nucleophiles (“nucleus seekers”). Conversely, Lewis acids are electrophiles (“electron 
seekers”). We will use these terms hundreds of times throughout the remaining chapters.
Examine the detailed table of 
contents. What chapters include terms 
related to nucleophile or electrophile
in their title?
Section 1.1 A review of some fundamental knowledge about atoms and electrons leads to a 
discussion of wave functions, orbitals, and the electron configurations of 
atoms. Neutral atoms have as many electrons as the number of protons in the 
nucleus. These electrons occupy orbitals in order of increasing energy, with no 
more than two electrons in any one orbital. The most frequently encountered 
atomic orbitals in this text are s orbitals (spherically symmetrical) and p orbitals 
(“dumbbell-shaped”).

1.16 SUMMARY1.16 Summary 47
Section 1.2 An ionic bond is the force of electrostatic attraction between two oppositely 
charged ions. Atoms at the upper right of the periodic table, especially 
fluorine and oxygen, tend to gain electrons to form anions. Elements 
toward the left of the periodic table, especially metals such as sodium, 
tend to lose electrons to form cations. Ionic bonds in which carbon is the 
cation or anion are rare.
Section 1.3 The most common kind of bonding involving carbon is covalent bonding:
the sharing of a pair of electrons between two atoms. Lewis formulas are 
written on the basis of the octet rule, which limits second-row elements to 
no more than eight electrons in their valence shells. In most of its compounds, 
carbon has four bonds. Many organic compounds have double or triple 
bonds to carbon. Four electrons are involved in a double bond, six in 
a triple bond.
Each carbon has four bonds in ethyl alcohol;
oxygen and each carbon are surrounded by eight electrons.

Section 1.4 When two atoms that differ in electronegativity are covalently bonded, the 
electrons in the bond are drawn toward the more electronegative element.
The electrons in a carbon−fluorine bond are
drawn away from carbon, toward fluorine.
Section 1.5 Counting electrons and assessing charge distribution in molecules is essential to 
understanding how structure affects properties. A particular atom in a Lewis 
formula may be neutral, positively charged, or negatively charged. The formal 
charge of an atom in the Lewis formula of a molecule can be calculated by 
comparing its electron count with that of the neutral atom itself.
Formal charge = Group number in periodic table − Electron count
where
Electron count = _1

Section 1.6 Table 1.5 in this section sets forth the procedure to be followed in writing

Section 1.7 Many molecules can be represented by two or more Lewis formulas that differ

Section 1.8 The octet rule can be exceeded for second-row elements. Resonance contributors

Section 1.9 The shapes of molecules can often be predicted on the basis of valence shell 
electron-pair repulsions. A tetrahedral arrangement gives the maximum 
separation of four electron pairs (left); a trigonal planar arrangement is best 
for three electron pairs (center), and a linear arrangement for two electron 
pairs (right).
Section 1.10 Knowing the shape of a molecule and the polarity of its various bonds allows 
the presence or absence of a molecular dipole moment and its direction to be 
predicted.
Both water and carbon dioxide have polar bonds,
but water has a dipole moment while carbon dioxide does not.

equation by showing the flow of electrons associated with bond making and 
bond breaking. In the process:

an electron pair of nitrogen becomes the pair of electrons in a CN bond. The 
CBr bond breaks, with the pair of electrons in that bond becoming an 
unshared pair of bromide ion.

The strength of an acid is given by its equilibrium constant Ka for ionization in 
aqueous solution:

or more conveniently by its pKa:
pKa = −log10Ka
Section 1.13 The strength of an acid depends on the atom to which the proton is bonded. 
Two important factors are the strength of the HX bond and the electronegativity 
of X. Bond strength is more important for atoms in the same group of the 
periodic table; electronegativity is more important for atoms in the same row. 
Electronegative atoms elsewhere in the molecule can increase the acidity by 
inductive effects.
Electron delocalization in the conjugate base, usually expressed via 
resonance between contributing Lewis formulas, increases acidity by stabilizing 
the conjugate base.
Section 1.14 The position of equilibrium in an acid–base reaction lies to the side of the 
weaker acid.
Stronger acid + W Stronger base eaker acid + Weaker base
K > 1
This is a very useful relationship. You should practice writing equations 
according to the Brønsted–Lowry definitions of acids and bases and familiarize 
yourself with Table 1.8, which gives the pKa’s of various Brønsted acids.
Section 1.15 The Lewis definitions of acids and bases provide for a more general view of 
acid–base reactions than the Brønsted–Lowry picture. A Lewis acid is an 
electron-pair acceptor. A Lewis base is an electron-pair donor. The Lewis 
approach incorporates the Brønsted–Lowry approach as a subcategory in which 
the atom that accepts the electron pair in the Lewis acid is a hydrogen.

Lewis formulas are the major means by which structural information is communicated in organic 
chemistry. These structural formulas show the atoms, bonds, location of unshared pairs, and formal 
charges.
Two or more Lewis formulas, differing only in the placement of electrons, can often be 
written for a single compound. In such cases the separate structures represented by the Lewis 
formulas are said to be in resonance, and the true electron distribution is a hybrid of the electron 
distributions of the contributing structures.
The amide function is an important structural unit in peptides and proteins. Formamide, 
represented by the Lewis structure shown, is the simplest amide. It is a planar molecule with a 
dipole moment of 3.7 D. Lewis structures I–IV represent species that bear some relationship to 
the Lewis structure for formamide.

Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: 
Introduction to Hydrocarbons
This chapter continues the connection between structure and 
properties begun in Chapter 1. In it we focus on the simplest 
organic compounds—those that contain only carbon and 
hydrogen, called hydrocarbons. These compounds occupy a 
key position in the organic chemical landscape. Their frame￾work of carbon–carbon bonds provides the scaffolding on 
which more reactive functional groups are attached. We’ll 
introduce functional groups in a preliminary way in this chap￾ter but will have much more to say about them beginning in 
Chapter 5.
By focusing on hydrocarbons, we’ll expand our picture of 
bonding by introducing two approaches that grew out of the 
idea that electrons can be described as waves: the valence bond
and molecular orbital models. In particular, one aspect of the 
valence bond model, called orbital hybridization, will be 
emphasized.
A major portion of this chapter deals with how we name 
organic compounds. The system used throughout the world is 
based on a set of rules for naming hydrocarbons, then extend￾ing the rules to include compounds that contain functional 
groups.
In our solar system, only Earth and Titan, a moon of Saturn, are known to 
possess lakes. The spacecraft Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004 and stayed 
operational until September 2017. Cassini and its European-built probe 
Huygens, which landed on Titan’s surface in 2005, revealed that instead of 
lakes of water, Titan’s low temperature of −179°C allows for lakes of methane 
and ethane. The scientific community continues to discuss the origins of 
hydrocarbons on Titan.

2.1 Classes of Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are divided into two main classes: aliphatic and aromatic. This classifica￾tion dates from the nineteenth century, when organic chemistry was devoted almost 
entirely to the study of materials from natural sources, and terms were coined that 
reflected a substance’s origin. Two sources were fats and oils, and the word aliphatic
was derived from the Greek word aleiphar meaning “fat.” Aromatic hydrocarbons, irre￾spective of their own odor, were typically obtained by chemical treatment of pleasant￾smelling plant extracts.
Aliphatic hydrocarbons include three major groups: alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. 
Alkanes are hydrocarbons in which all the bonds are single bonds, alkenes contain at 
least one carbon–carbon double bond, and alkynes contain at least one carbon–carbon 
triple bond. Examples of the three classes of aliphatic hydrocarbons are the two-carbon 
compounds ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. Another name for aromatic hydrocarbons is 
arenes. The most important aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene.

Different properties in these hydrocarbons are the result of the different types of bonding 
involving carbon. The shared electron pair, or Lewis model of chemical bonding described 
in Section 1.3, does not account for all of the differences. In the following sections, we 
will consider two additional bonding theories: the valence bond model and molecular 
orbital model.
2.2 Electron Waves and Chemical Bonds
G. N. Lewis proposed his shared electron-pair model of bonding in 1916, almost a decade 
before Louis de Broglie’s theory of wave–particle duality. De Broglie’s radically different 
view of an electron, and Erwin Schrödinger’s success in using wave equations to calculate 
the energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom, encouraged the belief that bonding in 
molecules could be explained on the basis of interactions between electron waves. This 
thinking produced two widely used theories of chemical bonding; one is called the 
valence bond model, the other the molecular orbital model.
Before we describe these theories in the context of organic molecules, let’s first 
think about bonding between two hydrogen atoms in the most fundamental terms. We’ll 
begin with two hydrogen atoms that are far apart and see what happens as the distance 
between them decreases. The forces involved are electron–electron (−−) repulsions, 
nucleus–nucleus (++) repulsions, and electron–nucleus (−+) attractions. All of these 
forces increase as the distance between the two hydrogens decreases. Because the elec￾trons are so mobile, however, they can choreograph their motions so as to minimize their 
mutual repulsion while maximizing their attractive forces with the protons. Thus, as 
shown in Figure 2.1, a net, albeit weak, attractive force exists between the two hydrogens 
even when the atoms are far apart. This interaction becomes stronger as the two 
atoms approach each other—the electron of each hydrogen increasingly feels the attractive 
force of two protons rather than one, the total energy decreases, and the system becomes 
more stable. A potential energy minimum is reached when the separation between the 
nuclei reaches 74 pm (0.74 Å), which corresponds to the HH bond length in H2. At 
distances shorter than this, nucleus–nucleus and electron–electron repulsions dominate, 
and the system becomes less stable.
De Broglie’s and Schrödinger’s 
contributions to our present 
understanding of electrons were 
described in Section 1.1.
All of the forces in chemistry, except 
for nuclear chemistry, are electrical. 
Opposite charges attract; like charges 
repel. This simple fact can take you a 
long way.58 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
Valence bond and molecular orbital theory both incorporate the wave description 
of an atom’s electrons into this picture of H2, but in somewhat different ways. Both 
assume that electron waves behave like more familiar waves, such as sound and light 
waves. One important property of waves is called interference in physics. Constructive 
interference occurs when two waves combine so as to reinforce each other (in phase); 
destructive interference occurs when they oppose each other (out of phase) (Figure 2.2).
Recall from Section 1.1 that electron waves in atoms are characterized by their 
wave function, which is the same as an orbital. For an electron in the most stable state 
of a hydrogen atom, for example, this state is defined by the 1s wave function and is 
often called the 1s orbital. The valence bond model bases the connection between two 
atoms on the overlap between half-filled orbitals of the two atoms. The molecular orbital
model assembles a set of molecular orbitals by combining the atomic orbitals of all of 
the atoms in the molecule.
For a molecule as simple as H2, valence bond and molecular orbital theory produce 
very similar pictures. The next two sections describe these two approaches.
2.3 Bonding in H2: The Valence Bond Model
The characteristic feature of valence bond theory is that it pictures a covalent bond 
between two atoms in terms of an in-phase overlap of a half-filled orbital of one atom 
with a half-filled orbital of the other, illustrated for the case of H2 in Figure 2.3. Two 
hydrogen atoms, each containing an electron in a 1s orbital, combine so that their orbitals 
overlap to give a new orbital associated with both of them. In-phase orbital overlap 
(constructive interference) increases the probability of finding an electron in the region 
between the two nuclei where it feels the attractive force of both of them. Electrostatic 
potential maps show this build-up of electron density in the region between two hydrogen 
atoms as they approach each other closely enough for their orbitals to overlap. Potential energy

Plot of potential energy versus distance 
for two hydrogen atoms. At long 
distances, there is a weak attractive 
force. As the distance decreases, the 
potential energy decreases, and the 
system becomes more stable because 
each electron now “feels” the attractive 
force of two protons rather than one. 
The lowest energy state corresponds to 
a separation of 74 pm (0.74 Å), which is 
the normal bond distance in H2. At 
shorter distances, nucleus–nucleus and 
electron–electron repulsions are 
greater than electron–nucleus 
attractions, and the system becomes 
less stable.

of phase with each other.2.4 Bonding in H2: The Molecular Orbital Model 59
A bond in which the orbitals overlap along a line connecting the atoms (the inter￾nuclear axis) is called a sigma (σ) bond. The electron distribution in a σ bond is cylin￾drically symmetrical; were we to slice through a σ bond perpendicular to the internuclear 
axis, its cross section would appear as a circle. Another way to see the shape of the 
electron distribution is to view the molecule end-on.

We will use the valence bond approach extensively in our discussion of organic 
molecules and expand on it shortly. First though, let’s introduce the molecular orbital 
method to see how it uses the 1s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms to generate the orbitals 
of an H2 molecule.
2.4 Bonding in H2: The Molecular Orbital Model
The molecular orbital theory of chemical bonding rests on the notion that, as electrons 
in atoms occupy atomic orbitals, electrons in molecules occupy molecular orbitals. Just 
as our first task in writing the electron configuration of an atom is to identify the atomic 
orbitals that are available to it, so too must we first describe the orbitals available to a 
molecule. In the molecular orbital method this is done by representing molecular orbitals 
(a) The 1s orbitals of two separated hydrogen 
atoms, sufficiently far apart so that 
essentially no interaction takes place 
between them. Each electron is associated 
with only a single proton.
(b) As the hydrogen atoms approach each 
other, their 1s orbitals begin to overlap and 
each electron begins to feel the attractive 
force of both protons.
(c) The hydrogen atoms are close enough so 
that appreciable overlap of the two 1s
orbitals occurs. The concentration of 
electron density in the region between the 
two protons is more readily apparent.
(d) A molecule of H2. The center-to-center 
distance between the hydrogen atoms is
74 pm (0.74 A˚). The two individual 1s
orbitals have been replaced by a new 
orbital that encompasses both hydrogens 
and contains both electrons. The electron 
density is greatest in the region between 
the two hydrogens.

maps. The 1s orbitals of two hydrogen 
atoms overlap to give an orbital that

as combinations of atomic orbitals, the linear combination of atomic orbitals-molecular 
orbital (LCAO-MO) method.
Two molecular orbitals (MOs) of H2 are generated by combining the 1s atomic 
orbitals (AOs) of two hydrogen atoms. In one combination, the two wave functions are 
added; in the other they are subtracted. The two new orbitals that are produced are por￾trayed in Figure 2.4. The additive combination generates a bonding orbital; the subtrac￾tive combination generates an antibonding orbital. Both the bonding and antibonding 
orbitals have σ symmetry, meaning that they are symmetrical with respect to the inter￾nuclear axis. The two are differentiated by calling the bonding orbital σ and the antibond￾ing orbital σ* (“sigma star”). The bonding orbital is characterized by a region of high 
electron probability between the two atoms, whereas the antibonding orbital has a nodal 
plane between them.
A molecular orbital diagram for H2 is shown in Figure 2.5. The customary format 
shows the starting AOs at the left and right sides and the MOs in the middle. It must 
always be true that the number of MOs is the same as the number of AOs that combine 
to produce them. Thus, when the 1s AOs of two hydrogen atoms combine, two MOs 
result. The bonding MO (σ) is lower in energy and the antibonding MO (σ*) higher in 
energy than either of the original 1s orbitals.
When assigning electrons to MOs, the same rules apply as for writing electron 
configurations of atoms. Electrons fill the MOs in order of increasing orbital energy, and 
the maximum number of electrons in any orbital is two. Both electrons of H2 occupy the 
bonding orbital and have opposite spins, and both are held more strongly than they would 
be in separated hydrogen atoms. There are no electrons in the antibonding orbital.
For a molecule as simple as H2, it is hard to see much difference between the 
valence bond and molecular orbital methods. The most important differences appear in 
molecules with more than two atoms. In those cases, the valence bond method continues 
to view a molecule as a collection of bonds between connected atoms. The molecular 
orbital method, however, leads to a picture in which the same electron can be associated 
with many, or even all, of the atoms in a molecule. We’ll have more to say about the Increasing energy

2.5 Introduction to Alkanes: Methane, Ethane, and Propane
Alkanes have the general molecular formula CnH2n+2. The simplest one, methane (CH4), 
is also the most abundant. Large amounts are present in our atmosphere, in the ground, 
and in the oceans. Methane has been found on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, 
and Pluto, on Halley’s Comet, even in the atmosphere of a planet in a distant solar sys￾tem. About 2–8% of the atmosphere of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is methane.
Ethane (C2H6: CH3CH3) and propane (C3H8: CH3CH2CH3) are second and third, 
respectively, to methane in many ways. Ethane is the alkane next to methane in structural 
simplicity, followed by propane. Ethane (≈10%) is the second and propane (≈5%) the 
third most abundant component of natural gas, which is ≈75% methane. Natural gas is 
colorless and nearly odorless, as are methane, ethane, and propane. The characteristic 
odor of the natural gas we use for heating our homes and cooking comes from trace 
amounts of unpleasant-smelling sulfur-containing compounds, called thiols, that are 
deliberately added to it to warn us of potentially dangerous leaks.
Methane is the lowest boiling alkane, followed by ethane, then propane.

All the alkanes with four or fewer carbons are gases at room temperature and atmospheric 
pressure. With the highest boiling point of the three, propane is the easiest one to liquefy. 
We are all familiar with “propane tanks.” These are steel containers in which a propane￾rich mixture of hydrocarbons called liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is maintained in a 
liquid state under high pressure as a convenient clean-burning fuel.
It is generally true that as the number of carbon atoms increases, so does the boil￾ing point. The C70-alkane heptacontane [CH3(CH2)68CH3] boils at 653°C, and its C100
analog hectane at 715°C.
The structural features of methane, ethane, and propane are summarized in Figure 2.6. 
All of the carbon atoms have four bonds, all of the bonds are single bonds, and the bond 
angles are close to tetrahedral. In the next section we’ll see how to adapt the valence 
bond model to accommodate the observed structures.
Boiling points cited in this text are at

stated.

 Hybridization and Bonding in Methane
Before we describe the bonding in methane, it is worth emphasizing that bonding theories 
attempt to describe a molecule on the basis of its component atoms; bonding theories 
do not attempt to explain how bonds form. The world’s methane does not come from 
the reaction of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms; it comes from biological processes. 
Methane and the Biosphere
One of the things that environmental scientists do is to keep 
track of important elements in the biosphere—in what form 
do these elements normally occur, to what are they transformed, 
and how are they returned to their normal state? Careful studies 
have given clear, although complicated, pictures of the “nitro￾gen cycle,” the “sulfur cycle,” and the “phosphorus cycle,” for 
example. The “carbon cycle” begins and ends with atmospheric 
carbon dioxide. It can be represented in an abbreviated form as:
CO2 H2O energy Carbohydrates
Naturally occurring
substances of
numerous types
+ +
photosynthesis
respiration
respiration
Methane is one of literally millions of compounds in the 
carbon cycle, but one of the most abundant. It is formed when 
carbon-containing compounds decompose in the absence of air 
(anaerobic conditions). The organisms that bring this about are 
called methanoarchaea. Cells can be divided into three types: 
archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. Methanoarchaea convert 
carbon-containing compounds, including carbon dioxide and 
acetic acid, to methane. Virtually anywhere water contacts 
organic matter in the absence of air is a suitable place for meth￾anoarchaea to thrive—at the bottom of ponds, bogs, rice fields, 
even on the ocean floor. They live inside termites and grass￾eating animals; one source quotes 20 L/day as the methane 
output of a large cow.
The scale on which the world’s methanoarchaea churn out 
methane, estimated to be 1011–1012 lb/year, is enormous. About 
10% of this amount makes its way into the atmosphere, but most 
of the rest simply ends up completing the carbon cycle. It exits the 
anaerobic environment where it was formed and enters the aero￾bic world where it is eventually converted to carbon dioxide. But 
not all of it. Much of the world’s methane lies trapped beneath 
Earth’s surface. Firedamp, an explosion hazard to coal miners, is 
mostly methane, as is the natural gas that accompanies petroleum 
deposits. When methane leaks from petroleum under the ocean 
floor and the pressure is high enough (50 atm) and the water cold 
enough (4°C), individual methane molecules become trapped 
inside clusters of 6–18 water molecules as methane clathrates or 
methane hydrates (Figure 2.7). Aggregates of these hydrates 
remain at the bottom of the ocean in what looks like a lump of 
dirty ice, ice that burns (Figure 2.8). Far from being mere curiosi￾ties, methane hydrates are potential sources of energy on a scale 
greater than that of all the known oil reserves combined. The 
extraction of methane from hydrates has been demonstrated on 
a small scale, and estimates suggest some modest contribution to 
the global energy supply by 2020.
Methane hydrates contributed to the 2010 environmental 
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in an unexpected and important way. 
Because the hydrates are stable only under the extreme condi￾tions of pressure and temperature found in the deep ocean, their 
effect on the methods used to repair damage to the oil rigs proved 
difficult to anticipate and their ice-like properties interfered with 
attempts to cap the flow of oil in its early stages.
In a different vein, environmental scientists are looking 
into the possibility that methane hydrates contributed to a major 
global warming event that occurred 55 million years ago, lasted 
40,000 years, and raised the temperature of Earth some 5°C. 
They speculate that a modest warming of the oceans encour￾aged the dissociation of hydrates, releasing methane into the 
atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and the 
resulting greenhouse effect raised the temperature of Earth. 
This, in turn, caused more methane to be released from the 
oceans into the atmosphere, causing more global warming. 
Eventually a new, warmer equilibrium state was reached.

water molecule, and the lines

SurveyThe boxed essay Methane and the Biosphere tells you more about the origins of methane 
and other organic compounds.
We begin with the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of a mol￾ecule, then propose bonding models that are consistent with the structure. We do not 
claim that the observed structure is a result of the bonding model. Indeed, there may be 
two or more equally satisfactory models. Structures are facts; bonding models are theo￾ries that we use to try to understand the facts.
A vexing puzzle in the early days of valence bond theory concerned the fact that 
methane is CH4 and that the four bonds to carbon are directed toward the corners of a 
tetrahedron. Valence bond theory is based on the in-phase overlap of half-filled orbitals 
of the connected atoms. But with an electron configuration of 1s

 carbon has 
only two half-filled orbitals (Figure 2.9a). How, then, can it have four bonds?
In the 1930s Linus Pauling offered an ingenious solution to this puzzle. He sug￾gested that the electron configuration of a carbon bonded to other atoms need not be the 
same as that of a free carbon atom. By mixing (“hybridizing”) the 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz
orbitals, four new orbitals are obtained (Figure 2.9b). These four new orbitals are called 
sp3 hybrid orbitals because they come from one s orbital and three p orbitals. Each sp3
hybrid orbital has 25% s character and 75% p character. Among their most important 
features are the following:
1. All four sp3
 orbitals are of equal energy. Therefore, according to Hund’s rule 
(Section 1.1) the four valence electrons of carbon are distributed equally among 
them, making four half-filled orbitals available for bonding.
2. The axes of the sp3
 orbitals point toward the corners of a tetrahedron. Therefore, 
sp3 hybridization of carbon is consistent with the tetrahedral structure of methane. 
Each CH bond is a σ bond in which a half-filled 1s orbital of hydrogen over￾laps  with a half-filled sp3
 orbital of carbon along a line drawn between them 
(Figure 2.10).

 hybrid orbitals are of equal energy; therefore, the four valence electrons are distributed evenly among them. The axes of the four sp3
orbitals are directed toward the corners of a tetrahedron.64 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
3. σ Bonds involving sp3
 hybrid orbitals of carbon are stronger than those involving 
unhybridized 2s or 2p orbitals. Each sp3
 hybrid orbital has two lobes of unequal 
size, making the electron density greater on one side of the nucleus than the other. 
In a CH σ bond, it is the larger lobe of a carbon sp3
 orbital that overlaps with 
a hydrogen 1s orbital. This concentrates the electron density in the region between 
the two atoms.
The orbital hybridization model accounts for carbon having four bonds rather than two, 
the bonds are stronger than they would be in the absence of hybridization, and they are 
arranged in a tetrahedral fashion around carbon.
2.7 Bonding in Ethane
The orbital hybridization model of covalent bonding is readily extended to carbon–carbon 
bonds. As Figure 2.11 illustrates, ethane is described in terms of a carbon–carbon σ bond 
joining two CH3 (methyl) groups. Each methyl group consists of an sp3

orbitals. In general, you can expect that carbon will be sp3
-hybridized when it is directly 
bonded to four atoms.

 Hybridization and Bonding in Ethylene
Ethylene is planar with bond angles close to 120° (Figure 2.12); therefore, some hybrid￾ization state other than sp3
 is required. The hybridization scheme is determined by the 
number of atoms to which carbon is directly attached. In sp3
 hybridization, four atoms 
are attached to carbon by σ bonds, and so four equivalent sp3
 hybrid orbitals are required. 
In ethylene, three atoms are attached to each carbon, so three equivalent hybrid orbitals 
are needed. As shown in Figure 2.13, these three orbitals are generated by mixing the

carbon 2s orbital with two of the 2p orbitals and are called sp2 hybrid orbitals. One of 
the 2p orbitals is left unhybridized. The three sp2
 orbitals are of equal energy; each has 
one-third s character and two-thirds p character. Their axes are coplanar, and each has a 
shape much like that of an sp3
 orbital. The three sp2
 orbitals and the unhybridized p
orbital each contain one electron.
Each carbon of ethylene uses two of its sp2
 hybrid orbitals to form σ bonds to two 
hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in the first part of Figure 2.14. The remaining sp2
 orbitals, 
one on each carbon, overlap along the internuclear axis to give a σ bond connecting the 
two carbons.
Each carbon atom still has, at this point, an unhybridized 2p orbital available for 
bonding. These two half-filled 2p orbitals have their axes perpendicular to the framework 
of σ bonds of the molecule and overlap in a side-by-side manner to give a pi (π) bond.
The carbon–carbon double bond of ethylene is viewed as a combination of a σ bond plus 
a π bond. The additional increment of bonding makes a carbon–carbon double bond both 
stronger and shorter than a carbon–carbon single bond.
Electrons in a π bond are called π electrons. The probability of finding a π electron 
is highest in the region above and below the plane of the molecule. The plane of the mol￾ecule corresponds to a nodal plane, where the probability of finding a π electron is zero.
In general, you can expect that carbon will be sp2
-hybridized when it is directly 
bonded to three atoms in a neutral molecule.

overlap of 2p orbitals.2.9 sp Hybridization and Bonding in Acetylene
One more hybridization scheme is important in organic chemistry. It is called sp hybrid￾ization and applies when carbon is directly bonded to two atoms, as in acetylene. The 
structure of acetylene is shown in Figure 2.15 along with its bond distances and bond 
angles. Its most prominent feature is its linear geometry.
Because each carbon in acetylene is bonded to two other atoms, the orbital hybrid￾ization model requires each carbon to have two equivalent orbitals available for σ bonds 
as outlined in Figure 2.16. According to this model the carbon 2s orbital and one of its 
2p orbitals combine to generate two sp hybrid orbitals, each of which has 50% s char￾acter and 50% p character. These two sp orbitals share a common axis, but their major 
lobes are oriented at an angle of 180° to each other. Two of the original 2p orbitals 
remain unhybridized.
As portrayed in Figure 2.17, the two carbons of acetylene are connected to each 
other by a 2sp–2sp σ bond, and each is attached to a hydrogen substituent by a 2sp–1s
σ bond. The unhybridized 2p orbitals on one carbon overlap with their counterparts on

a multiple bond of the σ + π + π type.

bonded to two atoms in a neutral molecule.

2.10 Bonding in Water and Ammonia: Hybridization 
of Oxygen and Nitrogen
The valence bond model and the accompanying idea of orbital hybridization have appli￾cations beyond those of bonding in hydrocarbons. A very simple extension to inorganic 
chemistry describes the bonding to the nitrogen of ammonia and the oxygen of water.
Like the carbon of methane, nitrogen is surrounded by four electron pairs in 
ammonia—three bonded pairs and an unshared pair. Oxygen in water has two bonded 
pairs and two unshared pairs. As we saw when discussing the tetrahedral geometry of 
CH4, the pyramidal geometry of NH3, and the bent geometry of H2O in Section 1.9, all 
three are consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs. By associating a 
tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs with sp3
 orbital hybridization, we see that CH4, 
NH3, and H2O share a common valence bond description, differing only in the number 
of their valence electrons. C, N, and O are each sp3
-hybridized, with σ bonds connecting 
them to four, three, and two hydrogens, respectively. The unshared pair of nitrogen in

As noted in Section 1.9, the HNH angle in ammonia (107°) and the HOH 
angle in water (105°) are slightly smaller than the tetrahedral angle of 109.5° because 
of the larger volume required by unshared pairs.

2.11 Molecular Orbitals and Bonding in Methane
Compared to the Lewis and orbital hybridization models, molecular orbital theory is the 
least intuitive and requires the most training, background, and experience to apply. We 
have so far discussed molecular orbital theory only in the context of bonding in H2 but 
have used the results of molecular orbital theory without acknowledging it. Electrostatic 
potential maps, for example, are obtained by molecular orbital calculations. You will see 
other results of molecular orbital theory often in this text, but the theory itself will be 
developed only as needed.
We saw in Section 2.6 that the valence bond model for bonding in methane 
rests on the overlap of a hydrogen 1s orbital with an sp3
-hybridized orbital of carbon. 
The pair of electrons in each of the four σ bonds is delocalized, but only between 
two atoms—carbon and the attached hydrogen. According to molecular orbital the￾ory, as illustrated in Figure 2.19, the bonding electrons in methane are more delocal￾ized in that each of the four bonding orbitals involves carbon and all of the hydrogens 
and each contains two of the eight valence electrons. The lowest-energy molecular 
orbital in the figure has no nodes; each of the other three has one node. There are 
an equal number of antibonding orbitals, all of which are vacant; these plus the 
carbon 1s orbital and its two electrons are not involved in bonding and are not shown 
in the figure.
Which theory of chemical bonding is best: Lewis, valence bond, or molecular 
orbital? The answer is that organic chemists use all three, depending on the situation. 
The Lewis rules are straightforward and most familiar. Valence bond theory, especially 
when coupled with the concept of orbital hybridization, enhances the information content 
of Lewis formulas by distinguishing among various types of atoms, electrons, and bonds. 
Molecular orbital theory, although the least intuitive of the three methods, can provide 
insights into structure and reactivity that the Lewis and valence bond models cannot. All 
three theories are used by chemists with the choice being determined according to which 
one seems most appropriate.
2.12 Isomeric Alkanes: The Butanes
Methane is the only alkane of molecular formula CH4, ethane the only one that is C2H6, 
and propane the only one that is C3H8. Beginning with C4H10, however, constitutional 
isomers (Section 1.6) are possible; two alkanes have this particular molecular formula. 
In one, called n-butane, four carbons are joined in a continuous chain. The n in n-butane Energy

Each orbital contains two of the eight 
valence electrons. The carbon 1s orbital 
and its two electrons are not shown.stands for “normal” and means that the carbon chain is unbranched. The second isomer 
has a branched carbon chain and is called isobutane.

n-Butane Isobutane
Boiling point: −0.4°C
−139°C
−10.2°C
Melting point: −160.9°C
As noted in Section 2.7, CH3 is called a methyl group. In addition to having methyl 
groups at both ends, n-butane contains two CH2, or methylene groups. Isobutane contains 
three methyl groups bonded to a CH unit. The CH unit is called a methine group.
n-Butane and isobutane have the same molecular formula but differ in connectivity. 
They are constitutional isomers of each other and have different properties. Both are 
gases at room temperature, but n-butane boils almost 10°C higher than isobutane and 
has a melting point that is over 20°C higher.
Bonding in n-butane and isobutane continues the theme begun with methane, eth￾ane, and propane. All of the carbon atoms are sp3
-hybridized, all of the bonds are σ 
bonds, and the bond angles at carbon are close to tetrahedral. This generalization holds 
for all alkanes regardless of the number of carbons they have.
2.13 Higher n-Alkanes
n-Pentane and n-hexane are n-alkanes possessing five and six carbon atoms, respectively.
CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3 CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3
n-Pentane n-Hexane
The condensed formulas can be abbreviated by indicating within parentheses the number of 
methylene groups in the chain. Thus, n-pentane may be written as CH3(CH2)3CH3 and 
n-hexane as CH3(CH2)4CH3. This shortcut is especially convenient with longer-chain alkanes. 
The laboratory synthesis of the “ultralong” alkane CH3(CH2)388CH3 was achieved in 1985; 
imagine trying to write its structural formula in anything other than an abbreviated way!
Problem 2.7
An n-alkane of molecular formula C28H58 has been isolated from a certain fossil plant. Write a 
condensed structural formula for this alkane.
n-Alkanes have the general formula CH3(CH2)xCH3 and constitute a homologous 
series of compounds. A homologous series is one in which successive members differ 
by a CH2 group.
Problem 2.8
Much of the communication between insects involves chemical messengers called pheromones. 
A species of cockroach secretes a substance from its mandibular glands that alerts other 
cockroaches to its presence and causes them to congregate. One of the principal 
components of this aggregation pheromone is the alkane shown. Give the molecular formula 
of this substance, and represent it by a condensed formula.
“Butane” lighters contain about 5% 
n-butane and 95% isobutane in a 
sealed container. The pressure 
produced by the two compounds 
(about 3 atm) is enough to keep them 
in the liquid state until opening a small 
valve emits a fine stream of the 
vaporized mixture across a spark, 
which ignites it.

Three isomeric alkanes have the molecular formula C5H12. The unbranched isomer is

has a three-carbon chain with two methyl branches and is called neopentane.

Table 2.1 lists the number of possible alkane isomers according to the number of 
carbon atoms they contain. As the table shows, the number of isomers increases enor￾mously with the number of carbon atoms and raises two important questions:
1. How can we tell when we have written all the possible isomers corresponding to 
a particular molecular formula?
2. How can we name alkanes so that each one has a unique name?
The answer to the first question is that you cannot easily calculate the number of 
isomers. The data in Table 2.1 were determined by a mathematician who concluded that 
no simple expression can calculate the number of isomers. The best way to ensure that 
you have written all the isomers of a particular molecular formula is to work systemati￾cally, beginning with the unbranched chain and then shortening it while adding branches 
one by one. It is essential that you be able to recognize when two different-looking 
structural formulas are actually the same molecule written in different ways. The key

The answer to the second question—how to provide a name that is unique to a 
particular structure—is presented next in Section 2.15. It is worth noting, however, that 
being able to name compounds in a systematic way is a great help in deciding whether 
two structural formulas represent isomers or are the same compound written in two dif￾ferent ways. By following a precise set of rules, you will always get the same systematic 
name for a compound, regardless of how it is written. Conversely, two different compounds 
will always have different names.
2.14 The C5H12 Isomers 7374 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
2.15 IUPAC Nomenclature of Unbranched Alkanes
In the preceding section we saw that the three C5H12 isomers all incorporate “pentane” 
in their names and are differentiated by the prefixes “n-,” “iso,” and “neo.” Extending 
this approach to alkanes beyond C5H12 fails because we run out of descriptive prefixes 
before all the isomers have unique names. As difficult as it would be to invent different 
names for the 18 constitutional isomers of C8H18, for example, it would be even harder 
to remember which structure corresponded to which name. For this and other reasons, 
organic chemists developed systematic ways to name compounds based on their structure. 
The most widely used approach is called the IUPAC rules; IUPAC stands for the Inter￾national Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. (See the boxed essay What’s in a Name? 
Organic Nomenclature in Section 2.16.)
Alkane names form the foundation of the IUPAC system; more complicated com￾pounds are viewed as being derived from alkanes. The IUPAC names assigned to 
unbranched alkanes are shown in Table 2.2. Methane, ethane, propane, and butane are 
retained for CH4, CH3CH3, CH3CH2CH3, and CH3CH2CH2CH3, respectively. Thereafter, 
the number of carbon atoms in the chain is specified by a Greek prefix preceding the 
suffix -ane, which identifies the compound as a member of the alkane family. Notice 
that the prefix n- is not part of the IUPAC system. The IUPAC name for CH3CH2CH2CH3
is butane, not n-butane.

alkanes of molecular formula C6H14. In Section 2.16 you will see how the IUPAC rules 
generate a unique name for each isomer.
2.16 Applying the IUPAC Rules: The Names 
of the C6H14 Isomers
We can present and illustrate the most important of the IUPAC rules for alkane nomen￾clature by naming the five C6H14 isomers. By definition (see Table 2.2), the unbranched 
C6H14 isomer is hexane.
CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3
IUPAC name: hexane
or
The IUPAC rules name branched alkanes as substituted derivatives of the 
unbranched parent alkanes listed in Table 2.2. Consider the C6H14 isomer represented 
by the structure
CH3CHCH2CH2CH3
CH3
or
Step 1
Pick out the longest continuous carbon chain, and find the IUPAC name in Table 2.2 
that corresponds to the unbranched alkane having that number of carbons. This is the 
parent alkane from which the IUPAC name is to be derived.
In this case, the longest continuous chain has five carbon atoms; the compound is 
named as a derivative of pentane. The key word here is continuous. It does not matter 
whether the carbon skeleton is drawn in an extended straight-chain form or in one with 
many bends and turns. All that matters is the number of carbons linked together in an 
uninterrupted sequence.
Step 2
Identify the substituent groups attached to the parent.
The parent pentane chain bears a methyl (CH3) group as a substituent.
Step 3
Number the longest continuous chain in the direction that gives the lowest number to 
the substituent at the first point of branching.
The numbering scheme
CH3CHCH2CH2CH3
CH3
CH3CHCH2CH2CH3

is equivalent to
1 2 345

Both count five carbon atoms in their longest continuous chain and bear a methyl group 
as a substituent at the second carbon. An alternative numbering sequence that begins at 
the other end of the chain is incorrect:
CH3CHCH2CH2CH3
CH3
(methyl group attached to C-4)
5 4 321
Step 4
Write the name of the compound. The parent alkane is the last part of the name and is 
preceded by the names of the substituents and their numerical locations (locants). 
Hyphens separate the locants from the words.
IUPAC name: 2-methylpentane

Common names, despite their familiarity in certain cases, suffer 
serious limitations compared with systematic ones. The number 
of known compounds (more than 50 million) far exceeds 
our capacity to give each one a unique common name, and 
most common names are difficult to connect directly to a struc￾tural formula. A systematic approach based on structure not 
only conveys structural information, but also generates a unique 
name for each structural variation.
Evolution of the IUPAC Rules A single compound can have 
several acceptable systematic names but no two compounds 
can have the same name.
As early as 1787 with the French publication of Méthode 
de nomenclature chimique, chemists suggested guidelines for 
naming compounds according to chemical composition. Their 
proposals were more suited to inorganic compounds than 
organic ones, and it was not until the 1830s that comparable 
changes appeared in organic chemistry. Later (1892), a group of 
prominent chemists met in Geneva, Switzerland, where they for￾mulated the principles on which our present system of organic 
nomenclature is based.
During the twentieth century, what we now know as the 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) car￾ried out major revisions and extensions of organic nomenclature 
culminating in the IUPAC Rules of 1979 and 1993. Both versions 
are accessible via the Internet and are the basis for the names 
used in this text.* As of this writing, the 2013 rules are available 
only in print form.
Our practice will be to name compounds in the manner of 
most active chemists and to use nomenclature as a tool to 
advance our understanding of organic chemistry.
Other Nomenclatures Chemical Abstracts Service, a division 
of the American Chemical Society, surveys all the world’s lead￾ing scientific journals and publishes brief abstracts of their 
chemistry papers. Chemical Abstracts nomenclature has evolved 
in a direction geared to computerized literature searches and, 
although once similar to IUPAC, it is now much different. In gen￾eral, it is easier to make the mental connection between a struc￾ture and its IUPAC name than its Chemical Abstracts name.
The generic name of a drug is not derived from system￾atic nomenclature. The group responsible for most generic 
names in the United States is the U.S. Adopted Names (USAN) 
Council, a private organization founded by the American Medi￾cal Association, the American Pharmacists Association, and the 
U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention.

for the isomer that has an unbranched carbon chain. The other isomer has three carbons in 
its longest continuous chain with a methyl branch at the central carbon; its IUPAC name is 
2-methylpropane.

So far, the only branched alkanes that we’ve named have methyl groups attached 
to the main chain. What about groups other than CH3? What do we call these groups, 
and how do we name alkanes that contain them?
2.17 Alkyl Groups
An alkyl group lacks one of the hydrogens of an alkane. A methyl group (CH3) is an 
alkyl group derived from methane (CH4). Unbranched alkyl groups in which the point 
of attachment is at the end of the chain are named in IUPAC nomenclature by replacing 
the -ane endings of Table 2.2 by -yl.
CH3CH2
Ethyl group
CH3(CH2)5CH2
Heptyl group
CH3(CH2)16CH2
Octadecyl group
The dash at the end of the chain represents a potential point of attachment for some other 
atom or group.
Carbon atoms are classified according to their degree of substitution by other 
carbons. A primary carbon is directly attached to one other carbon. Similarly, a secondary
carbon is directly attached to two other carbons, a tertiary carbon to three, and a 
quaternary carbon to four. Alkyl groups are designated as primary, secondary, or

Ethyl (CH3CH2), heptyl [CH3(CH2)5CH2], and octadecyl [CH3(CH2)16CH2] are 
examples of primary alkyl groups.
Branched alkyl groups are named by using the longest continuous chain that begins 
at the point of attachment as the parent. Thus, the systematic names of the two C3H7
alkyl groups are propyl and 1-methylethyl. Both are better known by their common 
names, n-propyl and isopropyl, respectively.

An isopropyl group is a secondary alkyl group. Its point of attachment is to a secondary 
carbon atom, one that is directly bonded to two other carbons.
The C4H9 alkyl groups may be derived either from the unbranched carbon skeleton 
of butane or from the branched carbon skeleton of isobutane. Those derived from butane 
are the butyl (n-butyl) group and the 1-methylpropyl (sec-butyl) group.

Those derived from isobutane are the 2-methylpropyl (isobutyl) group and the 1,1-

point of attachment is to a primary carbon. tert-Butyl is a tertiary alkyl group because 
its potential point of attachment is to a tertiary carbon.

continuous chain. In this case the chain is three carbons and there are two methyl groups at 
C-2. The IUPAC name of this alkyl group is 2,2-dimethylpropyl. (The common name for this 
group is neopentyl.) It is a primary alkyl group because the carbon that bears the potential 
point of attachment (C-1) is itself directly bonded to one other carbon.
In addition to methyl and ethyl groups, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, iso￾butyl, tert-butyl, and neopentyl groups will appear often throughout this text. You should 
be able to recognize these groups on sight and to give their structures when needed.
2.18 IUPAC Names of Highly Branched Alkanes
By combining the basic principles of IUPAC notation with the names of the various 
alkyl groups, we can develop systematic names for highly branched alkanes. We’ll start 
with the following alkane, name it, then increase its complexity by successively adding 
methyl groups at various positions.
CH3CH2CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3 1 234 5678
CH2CH3
or
As numbered on the structural formula, the longest continuous chain contains eight car￾bons, and so the compound is named as a derivative of octane. Numbering begins at the 
end nearest the branch, and so the ethyl substituent is located at C-4, and the name of 
the alkane is 4-ethyloctane.
What happens to the IUPAC name when a methyl group replaces one of the hydro￾gens at C-3?

The compound becomes an octane derivative that bears a C-3 methyl group and a C-4 
ethyl group. When two or more different substituents are present, they are listed in alpha￾betical order in the name. The IUPAC name for this compound is 4-ethyl-3-methyloctane.
Replicating prefixes such as di-, tri-, and tetra- (Section 2.16) are used as needed 
but are ignored when alphabetizing. Adding a second methyl group to the original struc￾ture, at C-5, for example, converts it to 4-ethyl-3,5-dimethyloctane.

Italicized prefixes such as sec- and tert- are ignored when alphabetizing except when they 
are compared with each other. tert-Butyl precedes isobutyl, and sec-butyl precedes tert-butyl.

The names and structures of the most 
frequently encountered alkyl groups 
are given on the inside back cover.

continued80 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
Sample Solution (a) This problem extends the preceding discussion by adding a third methyl group 
to 4-ethyl-3,5-dimethyloctane, the compound just described. It is, therefore, an ethyltrimethyloctane. 
Notice, however, that the numbering sequence needs to be changed in order to adhere to the 
rule of numbering from the end of the chain nearest the first branch. When numbered properly, 
this compound has a methyl group at C-2 as its first-appearing substituent.
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
5-Ethyl-2,4,6-trimethyloctane
An additional feature of IUPAC nomenclature that concerns the direction of num￾bering is the “first point of difference” rule. Consider the two directions in which the 
following alkane may be numbered:
1
2 3
5
7
4 6 8
2,3,3,7,7-Pentamethyloctane
(incorrect!)
8
7 6 4 5 3 2
1
2,2,6,6,7-Pentamethyloctane
(correct)
When deciding on the proper direction, a point of difference occurs when one order gives 
a lower locant than another. Thus, although 2 is the first locant in both numbering 
schemes, the tie is broken at the second locant, and the rule favors 2,2,6,6,7, which has 
2 as its second locant, whereas 3 is the second locant in 2,3,3,7,7.
Finally, when the same group of locants are generated from two different number￾ing directions, choose the direction that gives the lower number to the substituent that 
appears first in the name. (Remember, substituents are listed alphabetically.)
The IUPAC nomenclature system is inherently logical and incorporates healthy 
elements of common sense into its rules. Granted, some long, funny-looking, hard-to￾pronounce names are generated. Once one knows the code (rules of grammar) though, 
it becomes a simple matter to convert those long names to unique structural formulas.
2.19 Cycloalkane Nomenclature
Cycloalkanes are alkanes that contain a ring of three or more carbons. They are fre￾quently encountered in organic chemistry and are characterized by the molecular formula 
CnH2n. They are named by adding the prefix cyclo- to the name of the unbranched alkane 
with the same number of carbons as the ring.
Cyclopropane Cyclopentane Cyclohexane Cyclodecane
Substituents are identified in the usual way. Their positions are specified by num￾bering the carbon atoms of the ring in the direction that gives the lowest number to the 
substituents at the first point of difference.
Ethylcyclopentane 3-Ethyl-1,1-dimethylcyclohexane
(not 1-ethyl-3,3-dimethylcyclohexane, because first point of 
difference rule requires 1,1,3 substitution rather than 1,3,3)

Cycloalkanes are one class of alicyclic
(aliphatic cyclic) hydrocarbons.When the ring contains fewer carbon atoms than an alkyl group attached to it, the com￾pound is named as an alkane, and the ring is treated as a cycloalkyl substituent:

Name each of the following compounds:

Sample Solution (a) The molecule has a tert-butyl group bonded to a nine-membered 
cycloalkane. It is tert-butylcyclononane. Alternatively, the tert-butyl group could be named 
systematically as a 1,1-dimethylethyl group, and the compound would then be named 
(1,1-dimethylethyl)cyclononane. Parentheses are used when necessary to avoid ambiguity. In 
this case the parentheses alert the reader that the locants 1,1 refer to substituents on the 
alkyl group and not to ring positions.
2.20 Introduction to Functional Groups
Much of the rich chemistry of organic compounds is associated with the presence of struc￾tural units called functional groups attached to or otherwise incorporated within the carbon 
framework, and it is standard practice to classify a compound according to its functional 
group. Although we will defer a more extensive presentation until Section 5.1, it is useful 
at this point to introduce the role of functional groups as an organizational tool.
A commonly used shorthand represents a generic alkyl group by the symbol R and 
a functionalized derivative of it as RX, where X is a functional group. Thus, a reaction 
in which X is replaced by some other group Y is written as:
RX + Y RY + X
Among functional groups, hydroxyl (X = OH) and halogens, particularly chlorine (X = Cl) 
and bromine (X = Br), are especially frequently encountered.
A widely used method called functional class nomenclature for compounds that 
bear a functional group is to name the alkyl group followed by the functional group as 
a separate word.
CH3CH2Br
Ethyl bromide
CH3
H CH3
OH
Isopropyl alcohol
Cl
tert-Butyl chloride

2.21 Sources of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes
As noted earlier, natural gas is mostly methane but also contains ethane and propane, 
along with smaller amounts of other low-molecular-weight alkanes. Natural gas is 
often found associated with petroleum deposits. Petroleum is a liquid mixture contain￾ing hundreds of substances, including approximately 150 hydrocarbons, roughly half 
The IUPAC defines a functional 
group as an “atom, or a group of 
atoms that has similar chemical 
properties whenever it occurs in 
different compounds.”
Table 5.1 lists the functional groups 
encountered most often in this text.
The word petroleum is derived from 
the Latin words for “rock” (petra) and 
“oil” (oleum).
2.21 Sources of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes 8182 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
of which are alkanes or cycloalkanes. Distillation of crude oil gives a number of 
volatile fractions, which by custom have the names given in Figure 2.21. High-boiling 
fractions such as kerosene and gas oil find wide use as fuels for diesel engines and 
furnaces, and the nonvolatile residue can be processed to give lubricating oil, greases, 
petroleum jelly, paraffin wax, and asphalt. Jet fuels are obtained from the naphtha–
kerosene fractions.
Although both are closely linked in our minds and by our own experience, the 
petroleum industry predated the automobile industry by half a century. The first oil well, 
drilled in Titusville, Pennsylvania, by Edwin Drake in 1859, provided “rock oil,” as it 
was then called, on a large scale. This was quickly followed by the development of a 
process to “refine” it so as to produce kerosene. As a fuel for oil lamps, kerosene burned 
with a bright, clean flame and soon replaced the vastly more expensive whale oil then 
in use (Figure 2.22). Other oil fields were discovered, and uses for other petroleum 
products were found—illuminating city streets with gas lights, heating homes with oil, 
and powering locomotives. There were oil refineries long before there were automobiles. 
By the time the first Model T rolled off Henry Ford’s assembly line in 1908, John D. 
Rockefeller’s Standard Oil holdings had already made him one of the half-dozen wealth￾iest people in the world.
Modern petroleum refining involves more than distillation, however, and includes 
two major additional operations:
1. Cracking. The more volatile, lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons are useful as 
automotive fuels and as a source of petrochemicals. Cracking increases the propor￾tion of these hydrocarbons at the expense of higher-molecular-weight ones by pro￾cesses that involve the cleavage of carbon–carbon bonds induced by heat (thermal 
cracking) or with the aid of certain catalysts (catalytic cracking).
2. Reforming. The physical properties of the crude oil fractions known as light gaso￾line and naphtha (Figure 2.21) are appropriate for use as a motor fuel, but their 
ignition characteristics in high-compression automobile engines are poor and give 
rise to preignition, or “knocking.” Reforming converts the hydrocarbons in petro￾leum to aromatic hydrocarbons and highly branched alkanes, both of which show 
less tendency for knocking than unbranched alkanes and cycloalkanes.
Petroleum is not the only place where alkanes occur naturally. Solid n-alkanes, 
especially those with relatively long chains, have a waxy constituency and coat the outer 
surface of many living things where they help prevent the loss of water. Pentacosane 
[CH3(CH2)23CH3] is present in the waxy outer layer of most insects. Hentriacontane 
[CH3(CH2)29CH3] is a component of beeswax (see Problem 2.10) as well as the wax that 
coats the leaves of tobacco, peach trees, pea plants, and numerous others. The C23, C25, 
C27, C29, and C31 n-alkanes have been identified in the surface coating of the eggs of 
honeybee queens.
The tendency of a gasoline to cause 
“knocking” in an engine is given by its 
octane number. The lower the octane 
number, the greater the tendency. 
The two standards are heptane 
(assigned a value of 0) and 
“isooctane” (2,2,4-trimethylpentane, 
which is assigned a value of 100). The 
octane number of a gasoline is equal 
to the percentage of isooctane in a 
mixture of isooctane and heptane that 
has the same tendency to cause 
knocking as that sample of gasoline.

J. Lekavicius/ShutterstockCyclopentane and cyclohexane are present in petroleum, but as a rule, hydrocarbons 
based on cycloalkane frameworks rarely occur naturally. An exception is a group of more 
than 200 hydrocarbons called hopanes, related to the parent having the carbon skeleton 
shown.
Hopane
Hopanes were first found in petroleum and geological sediments, later as components of 
certain bacterial cell membranes. Although present in small amounts, hopanes are so 
widespread that they rank among the most abundant natural products on Earth.

What is the molecular formula of hopane?
2.22 Physical Properties of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes
Boiling Point. As we have seen earlier in this chapter, methane, ethane, propane, and 
butane are gases at room temperature. The unbranched alkanes pentane (C5H12) through 
heptadecane (C17H36) are liquids, whereas higher homologs are solids. As shown in 
Figure 2.23, the boiling points of unbranched alkanes increase with the number of 
carbon atoms and the boiling points of 2-methyl-branched alkanes are lower than those 
of the unbranched isomer. By exploring at the molecular level the reasons for the 
increase in boiling point with the number of carbons and the difference in boiling point 
between branched and unbranched alkanes, we can continue to connect structure 
with properties.
A substance exists as a liquid rather than a gas because attractive forces between 
molecules (intermolecular attractive forces) are greater in the liquid. Attractive forces

between neutral species (atoms or molecules, but not ions) are referred to as van der 
Waals forces and may be of three types:
1. dipole–dipole (including hydrogen bonding)
2. dipole/induced-dipole
3. induced-dipole/induced-dipole
These forces are electrical in nature, and in order to vaporize a substance, enough energy 
must be added to overcome them. Most alkanes have no measurable dipole moment, and 
therefore the only van der Waals force to be considered is the induced-dipole/induced￾dipole attractive force.
It might seem that two nearby molecules A and B of the same nonpolar substance 
would be unaffected by each other.
+
–

In fact, the electric fields of both A and B are dynamic and fluctuate in a complementary 
way that results in a temporary dipole moment and a weak attraction between them.
– + + –
A B
+ – + –
A B
Extended assemblies of induced-dipole/induced-dipole attractions can accumulate 
to give substantial intermolecular attractive forces. An alkane with a higher molecular 
weight has more atoms and electrons and, therefore, more opportunities for inter￾molecular attractions and a higher boiling point than one with a lower molecular weight.
As noted earlier in this section, branched alkanes have lower boiling points than 
their unbranched isomers. Isomers have the same number of atoms and electrons, but a 
molecule of a branched alkane has a smaller surface area than an unbranched one. The 
extended shape of an unbranched alkane permits more points of contact for inter￾molecular  associations. Compare the boiling points of pentane (36°C) and its isomers 
2-methylbutane (28°C) and 2,2-dimethylpropane (bp 9°C).
The shapes of these isomers are evident in the space-filling models depicted in 
Figure 2.24. Pentane has the most extended structure and the largest surface area avail￾able for “sticking” to other molecules by way of induced-dipole/induced-dipole attractive 
forces; it has the highest boiling point. 2,2-Dimethylpropane has the most compact, most 
spherical structure, engages in the fewest induced-dipole/induced-dipole attractions, and 
has the lowest boiling point.
Induced-dipole/induced-dipole 
attractive forces are often called 
London forces, or dispersion forces.

branched isomer, 2,2-dimethylpropane, 
has the most compact, most spherical 
three-dimensional shape.Induced-dipole/induced-dipole attractions are very weak forces individually, but a 
typical organic substance can participate in so many of them that they are collectively the 
most important of all the contributors to intermolecular attraction in the liquid state. They 
are the only forces of attraction possible between nonpolar molecules such as alkanes.
Problem 2.17
Match the boiling points with the appropriate alkanes.
Alkanes: octane, 2-methylheptane, 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, nonane
Boiling points (°C, 1 atm): 106, 116, 126, 151
Cyclopentane has a higher boiling point (49.3°C) than pentane (36°C), indicating 
greater forces of association in the cyclic alkane than occur in the straight-chain alkane.
Melting Point. Solid alkanes are soft, generally low-melting materials. The forces 
responsible for holding the crystal together are the same induced-dipole/induced-dipole 
interactions that operate between molecules in the liquid, but the degree of organization 
is greater in the solid phase. By measuring the distances between the atoms of one mol￾ecule and its neighbor in the crystal, it is possible to specify a distance of closest approach 
characteristic of an atom called its van der Waals radius. In space-filling molecular 
models, such as those of pentane, 2-methylbutane, and 2,2-dimethylpropane shown in 
Figure 2.24, the radius of each sphere corresponds to the van der Waals radius of the 
atom it represents. The van der Waals radius for hydrogen is 120 pm (1.20 Å). When two 
alkane molecules are brought together so that a hydrogen of one molecule is within 
240 pm (2.40 Å) of a hydrogen of the other, the balance between electron–nucleus attrac￾tions versus electron–electron and nucleus–nucleus repulsions is most favorable. Closer 
approach is resisted by a strong increase in repulsive forces.
Solubility in Water. A familiar physical property of alkanes is contained in the adage 
“oil and water don’t mix.” Alkanes—indeed all hydrocarbons—are virtually insoluble in 
water. In order for a hydrocarbon to dissolve in water, the framework of hydrogen bonds 
between water molecules would become more ordered in the region around each mole￾cule of the dissolved hydrocarbon. This increase in order, which corresponds to a decrease 
in entropy, signals a process that can be favorable only if it is reasonably exothermic. 
Such is not the case here. The hydrogen bonding among water molecules is too strong 
to be disrupted by nonpolar hydrocarbons. Being insoluble, and with densities in the 
0.6–0.8 g/mL range, alkanes float on the surface of water. The exclusion of nonpolar 
molecules, such as alkanes, from water is called the hydrophobic effect.
2.23 Chemical Properties: Combustion of Alkanes
An older name for alkanes is paraffin hydrocarbons. Paraffin is derived from the Latin words 
parum affinis (“with little affinity”) and testifies to the low level of reactivity of alkanes.
Although essentially inert in acid–base reactions, alkanes do participate in oxidation–
reduction reactions as the compound that undergoes oxidation. Burning in air (combustion)
is the best known and most important example. Combustion of hydrocarbons is exothermic 
and gives carbon dioxide and water as the products.

Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part for 
developing novel substances that do 
react with alkanes.
2.23 Chemical Properties: Combustion of Alkanes 8586 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
The heat released on combustion of a substance is called its heat of combustion
and is equal to −ΔH° for the reaction. By convention
ΔH° = H°products − H°reactants
where H° is the heat content, or enthalpy, of a compound in its standard state, that is, 
the gas, pure liquid, or crystalline solid at a pressure of 1 atm. In an exothermic process 
the enthalpy of the products is less than that of the starting materials, and ΔH° is a 
negative number.
Table 2.3 lists the heats of combustion of several alkanes. Unbranched alkanes have 
slightly higher heats of combustion than their 2-methyl-branched isomers, but the most 
important factor is the number of carbons. The unbranched alkanes and the 2-methyl￾branched alkanes constitute two separate homologous series (Section 2.13) in which there 
is a regular increase of about 659 kJ/mol (157.4 kcal/mol) in the heat of combustion for 
each additional CH2 group.
Problem 2.19
Using the data in Table 2.3, estimate the heat of combustion of
(a) 2-Methylnonane
(b) Eicosane
Sample Solution (a) The last entry for the group of 2-methylalkanes in the table is 
2-methylheptane. Its heat of combustion is 5505 kJ/mol (1315.8 kcal/mol). Because 
2-methylnonane has two more methylene groups than 2-methylheptane, its heat of 
combustion is 2 × 659 kJ/mol (or 2 × 157.4 kcal/mol) higher.
Heat of combustion of 2-methylnonane = 5505 + 2(659) = 6823 kJ/mol
(1315.8 + 2(157.4) = 1630.6 kcal/mol)
Heats of combustion can be used to compare the relative stability of isomeric 
hydrocarbons. They tell us not only which isomer is more stable than another, but also

on a potential energy diagram. Potential energy is comparable with enthalpy; it is the 
energy a molecule has exclusive of its kinetic energy. These C8H18 isomers all undergo 
combustion to the same final state according to the equation:
C8H18 + 
__25
2 O2 → 8CO2 + 9H2O
therefore, the differences in their heats of combustion translate directly to differences in 
their potential energies. When comparing isomers, the one with the lowest potential 
energy (in this case, the smallest heat of combustion) is the most stable. Among the 
C8H18 alkanes, the most highly branched isomer, 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, is the most 
stable, and the unbranched isomer octane is the least stable. It is generally true for alkanes 
that a more branched isomer is more stable than a less branched one.
The small differences in stability between branched and unbranched alkanes result 
from an interplay between attractive and repulsive forces within a molecule (intra￾molecular forces). These forces are nucleus–nucleus repulsions, electron–electron repul￾sions, and nucleus–electron attractions, the same set of fundamental forces we met when 
talking about chemical bonding (Section 2.2) plus the van der Waals forces between 
molecules (Section 2.22). When the energy associated with these interactions is calcu￾lated for all of the nuclei and electrons within a molecule, it is found that the attractive 
forces increase more than the repulsive forces as the structure becomes more compact. 
Sometimes, though, two atoms in a molecule are held too closely together. We’ll explore 
the consequences of that in Chapter 3.

Thermochemistry is the study of the heat changes that 
accompany chemical processes. It has a long history dat￾ing back to the work of the French chemist Antoine Laurent 
Lavoisier in the late eighteenth century. Thermochemistry pro￾vides quantitative information that complements the qualita￾tive description of a chemical reaction and can help us 
understand why some reactions occur and others do not. It is 
of value when assessing the relative value of various materials 
as fuels, when comparing the stability of isomers, or when 
determining the practicality of a particular reaction. In the field 
of bioenergetics, thermochemical information is applied to the 
task of sorting out how living systems use chemical reactions 
to store and use the energy that originates in the sun.
By allowing compounds to react in a calorimeter, it is pos￾sible to measure the heat evolved in an exothermic reaction or 
the heat absorbed in an endothermic one. Thousands of reac￾tions have been studied to produce a rich library of thermo￾chemical data. These data take the form of heats of reaction and 
correspond to the value of the standard enthalpy change ΔH°
for a particular reaction of a particular substance.
In this section you have seen how heats of combustion 
can be used to determine relative stabilities of isomeric alkanes. 
In Section 8.3 we shall expand our scope to include the experi￾mentally determined heats of hydrogenation, to see how ΔH°
values from various sources can aid our understanding of struc￾ture and reactivity.
The standard heat of formation (ΔH°f ) is the enthalpy 
change for formation of one mole of a compound directly from 
its elements, and is one type of heat of reaction. In cases such 
as the formation of CO2 or H2O from the combustion of carbon 
or hydrogen, respectively, the heat of formation of a substance 
can be measured directly. In most other cases, heats of forma￾tion are not measured experimentally but are calculated from 
the measured heats of other reactions. Consider, for example, 
the heat of formation of methane. The reaction that defines the 
formation of methane from its elements,
C (graphite)
Carbon
2H2(g)

CH4(g)

+
can be expressed as the sum of three reactions:
(1) C (graphite) + O2(g)
C (graphite) + 2H2(g)
CO2(g) ΔH° = −393 kJ/mol
 (−93.9 kcal/mol)
(2) 2H2(g) + O2(g) 2H2O(l) ΔH° = −572 kJ/mol
 (−136.7 kcal/mol)
(3) CO2(g) + 2H2O(l ) CH4(g) + 2O2(g)
ΔH° = +890 kJ/mol
 (+212.7 kcal/mol)
CH4(g) ΔH° = −75 kJ/mol
 (−17.9 kcal/mol)
Equations (1) and (2) are the heats of formation of one mole of 
carbon dioxide and two moles of water, respectively. Equation (3) 
is the reverse of the combustion of methane, and so the heat of 
reaction is equal to the heat of combustion but opposite in sign. 
The sum of equations (1)–(3) is the enthalpy change for formation 
of one mole of methane from its elements. Thus, ΔH°f = −75 kJ/mol 
(−17.9 kcal/mol).
The heats of formation of most organic compounds are 
derived from heats of reaction by arithmetic manipulations simi￾lar to that shown. Chemists find a table of ΔH°f values to be 
convenient because it replaces many separate tables of ΔH°
values for individual reaction types and permits ΔH° to be calcu￾lated for any reaction, real or imaginary, for which the heats of 
formation of reactants and products are available.

2.24 Oxidation–Reduction in Organic Chemistry
As we have just seen, the reaction of alkanes with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water 
is called combustion. A more fundamental classification of reaction types places it in the 
oxidation–reduction category. To understand why, let’s review some principles of oxida￾tion–reduction, beginning with the oxidation number (also known as oxidation state).
There are a variety of methods for calculating oxidation numbers. In compounds 
that contain a single carbon, such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the oxi￾dation number of carbon can be calculated from the molecular formula. For neutral 
molecules the algebraic sum of all the oxidation numbers must equal zero. Assuming, 
as is customary, that the oxidation state of hydrogen is +1, the oxidation state of carbon 
in CH4 then is calculated to be −4. Similarly, assuming an oxidation state of −2 for 
oxygen, carbon is +4 in H2CO3 and CO2.Hydrogens and oxygens determine carbon oxidation number

Increasing carbon oxidation number
The carbon in methane has the lowest oxidation number (−4) of any of the com￾pounds shown and contains carbon in its most reduced form. Carbon dioxide and car￾bonic acid have the highest oxidation numbers (+4) for carbon, corresponding to its most 
oxidized state. When methane or any alkane undergoes combustion to form carbon diox￾ide, carbon is oxidized and oxygen is reduced.
A useful generalization is the following:
Oxidation of carbon corresponds to an increase in the number of bonds between 
carbon and oxygen or to a decrease in the number of carbon–hydrogen bonds. 
Conversely, reduction corresponds to an increase in the number of carbon–hydrogen 
bonds or to a decrease in the number of carbon–oxygen bonds.
Each successive increase in oxidation state increases the number of bonds between 
carbon and oxygen and decreases the number of carbon–hydrogen bonds. Methane has 
four CH bonds and no CO bonds; carbonic acid and carbon dioxide both have four 
CO bonds and no CH bonds.
Among the various classes of hydrocarbons, alkanes contain carbon in its most 
reduced state, and alkynes contain carbon in its most oxidized state.

Increasing carbon oxidation number
We can extend the generalization by recognizing that the pattern of oxidation states 
is not limited to increasing oxygen or hydrogen content. Any element more electronegative
than carbon will have the same effect on oxidation number as oxygen. Thus, the oxidation 
numbers of carbon in CH3Cl and CH3OH are the same (−2). The reaction of chlorine 
with methane (to be discussed in Sections 10.2 and 10.3) involves oxidation at carbon.
CH4 + Cl2 ⟶ CH3Cl + HCl
Methane Chlorine Chloromethane Hydrogen chloride
2.24 Oxidation–Reduction in Organic Chemistry 8990 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
Any element less electronegative than carbon will have the same effect on oxidation 
number as hydrogen. Thus, the oxidation numbers of carbon in CH3Li and CH4 are the 
same (−4), and the reaction of CH3Cl with lithium (to be discussed in Section 15.3) 
involves reduction at carbon.
CH3Cl + 2Li ⟶ CH3Li + LiCl
Chloromethane Lithium Methyllithium Lithium chloride
The oxidation number of carbon decreases from −2 in CH3Cl to −4 in CH3Li.
The generalization illustrated by the preceding examples can be expressed in terms 
broad enough to cover these reactions and many others, as follows: Oxidation of carbon 
occurs when a bond between a carbon and an atom that is less electronegative than 
carbon is replaced by a bond to an atom that is more electronegative than carbon. The 
reverse process is reduction.

Many, indeed most, organic compounds contain carbon in more than one oxidation 
state. Consider ethanol (CH3CH2OH), for example. One carbon is connected to three hydro￾gens; the other carbon to two hydrogens and one oxygen. Although we could calculate the 
actual oxidation numbers, we rarely need to. Most of the time we are only concerned with 
whether a particular reaction is an oxidation or a reduction. The ability to recognize when 
oxidation or reduction occurs is of value when deciding on the kind of reactant with which 
an organic molecule must be treated to convert it into a desired product.
Problem 2.23

(b) CH3CH2Br CH3CH2Li
(c) H2C C CH2 H3CH2OH

(a) CH3CH2OH
(d) H2C CH2
Sample Solution (a) The CH3 carbon is unchanged in the reaction; however, the carbon of 
CH2OH now has two bonds to oxygen. Therefore, the reaction requires an oxidizing agent.Section 2.1 The classes of hydrocarbons are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and arenes.
Alkanes are hydrocarbons in which all of the bonds are single bonds and are 
characterized by the molecular formula CnH2n+2.
Section 2.2 Two theories of bonding, valence bond and molecular orbital theory, are based 
on the wave nature of an electron. Constructive interference between the electron 
wave of one atom and that of another gives a region between the two atoms in 
which the probability of sharing an electron is high—a bond.
Section 2.3 In valence bond theory a covalent bond is described in terms of in-phase over￾lap of a half-filled orbital of one atom with a half-filled orbital of another. 
When applied to bonding in H2, the orbitals involved are the 1s orbitals of two 
hydrogen atoms and the bond is a σ bond.
1s 1s σ
+
Section 2.4 In molecular orbital theory, the molecular orbitals (MOs) are approximated by 
combining the atomic orbitals (AOs) of all of the atoms in a molecule. The 
number of MOs must equal the number of AOs that are combined.
Section 2.5 The first three alkanes are methane (CH4), ethane (CH3CH3), and propane 
(CH3CH2CH3).
Section 2.6 Bonding in methane is most often described by an orbital hybridization model, 
which is a modified form of valence bond theory. Four equivalent sp3
 hybrid 
orbitals of carbon are generated by mixing the 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals. 
In-phase overlap of each half-filled sp3
 hybrid orbital with a half-filled 
hydrogen 1s orbital gives a σ bond.
s Orbital sp3 Orbital In-phase overlap of
s and sp3 orbitals

Section 2.7 The carbon–carbon bond in ethane is a σ bond viewed as an overlap of a 
half-filled sp3
 orbital of one carbon with a half-filled sp3
 orbital of another.
sp3 Orbital sp3 Orbital In-phase overlap of
two sp3 orbitals
+
Section 2.8 Carbon is sp2
-hybridized in ethylene, and the double bond has a σ component 
and a π component. The sp2
 hybridization state is derived by mixing the 2s and 
two of the three 2p orbitals. Three equivalent sp2
 orbitals result, and their axes 
are coplanar. Overlap of a half-filled sp2
 orbital of one carbon with a half-filled 
sp2
 orbital of another gives a σ bond between the two carbons. Each carbon still 
has one unhybridized p orbital available for bonding, and “side-by-side” overlap 
of half-filled p orbitals of adjacent carbons gives a π bond between them.
2.25 SUMMARY
2.25 Summary 9192 Chapter 2 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Introduction to Hydrocarbons
The π bond in ethylene is generated by
overlap of half-filled p orbitals of adjacent carbons.
Section 2.9 Carbon is sp-hybridized in acetylene, and the triple bond is of the σ + π + π 
type. The 2s orbital and one of the 2p orbitals combine to give two equivalent 
sp orbitals that have their axes in a straight line. A σ bond between the two 
carbons is supplemented by two π bonds formed by overlap of the remaining 
half-filled p orbitals.
The triple bond of acetylene has a σ bond component and two π bonds;
the two π bonds are shown here and are perpendicular to each other.
Section 2.10 The hybridization model for carbon can also be extended to oxygen and nitrogen. 
Oxygen and nitrogen are sp3
-hybridized in water and ammonia, respectively.
Section 2.11 Instead of being localized in a bond between two atoms, electron pairs are more 
delocalized in molecular orbital theory. The lowest energy bonding molecular 
orbital in butane and other alkanes, for example, encompasses all of the atoms. 
Higher-energy orbitals have one or more nodal surfaces where the probability 
of finding an electron is zero.
Lowest-energy molecular orbital of butane
Section 2.12 Two constitutionally isomeric alkanes have the molecular formula C4H10. One 
has an unbranched chain (CH3CH2CH2CH3) and is called n-butane; the other 
has a branched chain [(CH3)3CH] and is called isobutane. Both n-butane and 
isobutane are common names.
Section 2.13 Unbranched alkanes of the type CH3(CH2)xCH3 are often referred to as 
n-alkanes, and are said to belong to a homologous series.
Section 2.14 There are three constitutional isomers of C5H12: n-pentane (CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3), 
isopentane [(CH3)2CHCH2CH3], and neopentane [(CH3)4C].
Sections A single alkane may have several different names; a name may be a common 
name, or it may be a systematic name developed by a well-defined set of rules. The 
most widely used system is IUPAC nomenclature. Table 2.4 summarizes the rules 
for alkanes and cycloalkanes. Table 2.5 gives the rules for naming alkyl groups.
Section 2.20 Much of organic chemistry is concerned with structural units called functional 
groups incorporated into their structure. Alcohols and alkyl halides are 
introduced in this section as representative classes of compounds that contain a 
functional group.
Section 2.21 Natural gas is an abundant source of methane, ethane, and propane. Petroleum 
is a liquid mixture of many hydrocarbons, including alkanes. Alkanes also 
occur naturally in the waxy coating of leaves and fruits.
Section 2.22 Alkanes and cycloalkanes are nonpolar and insoluble in water. The forces of 
attraction between alkane molecules are induced-dipole/induced-dipole
2.15–2.19attractive forces. The boiling points of alkanes increase as the number of carbon 
atoms increases. Branched alkanes have lower boiling points than their 
unbranched isomers. There is a limit to how closely two atoms can approach 
each other, which is given by the sum of their van der Waals radii.
Section 2.23 Alkanes and cycloalkanes burn in air to give carbon dioxide, water, and heat. 
This process is called combustion.

The heat evolved on burning an alkane increases with the number of carbon 
atoms. The relative stability of isomers may be determined by comparing their 
respective heats of combustion. The more stable of two isomers has the lower 
heat of combustion.
Section 2.24 Combustion of alkanes is an example of oxidation–reduction. Although it is 
possible to calculate oxidation numbers of carbon in organic molecules, it is 
more convenient to regard oxidation of an organic substance as an increase in 
its oxygen content or a decrease in its hydrogen content.

Some Biochemical Reactions of Alkanes
Alkanes occur naturally in places other than petroleum deposits—in insects, for example. The 
waxy alkanes dispersed in its cuticle help protect an insect from dehydration. Some insects use 
volatile alkanes to defend themselves or communicate with others of the same species. Alkanes 
even serve as starting materials that the insect converts to other biologically important 
substances.
The major biosynthetic pathway leading to alkanes is by enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation 
(loss of CO2) of fatty acids, compounds of the type CH3(CH2)nCO2H in which n is an even number 
and the chain has 14 or more carbons.

In addition to alkanes, the oxidation of drugs and other substances occurs mainly in the liver and 
is catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrome P-450. Molecular oxygen and nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NAD) are also required.
Oxidation by microorganisms has been extensively studied and is often selective for certain 
kinds of CH bonds. The fungus Pseudomonas oleovorans, for example, oxidizes the CH3 groups 
at the end of the carbon chain of 4-methyloctane faster than the CH3 branch and faster than the 
CH2 and CH units within the chain.

Hydrogen peroxide is formed in the cells of plants and animals 
but is toxic to them. Consequently, living systems have devel￾oped mechanisms to rid themselves of hydrogen peroxide, 
usually by enzyme-catalyzed reduction to water. An understand￾ing of how reactions take place, be they in living systems or in 
test tubes, begins with a thorough knowledge of the structure 
of the reactants, products, and catalysts. Even a molecule as 
simple as hydrogen peroxide (four atoms!) may be structurally 
more complicated than you think. Suppose we wanted to write the 
structural formula for H2O2 in enough detail to show the posi￾tions of the atoms relative to one another. We could write two 
different planar geometries A and B that differ by a 180° rota￾tion about the OO bond. We could also write an infinite 
number of nonplanar structures, of which C is but one example, 
that differ from one another by tiny increments of rotation about 
the OO bond.
Carbon’s unrivaled ability to form bonds to itself can produce not only chains 
and rings, but also compact frameworks of many rings. Diamonds represent 
the ultimate elaboration of the pattern introduced by the progression of 
structural formulas shown. The three most complicated structures, plus many 
analogous but even larger ones, are all found in petroleum.

Structures A, B, and C represent different conformations of hydrogen peroxide. 
Conformations are different spatial arrangements of a molecule that are generated by 
rotation about single bonds. Although we can’t tell from simply looking at these struc￾tures, we now know from experimental studies that all are in rapid equilibrium and that 
C with an HOOH angle of about 114.5° is the most stable conformation.
Conformational analysis is the study of how conformational factors affect the 
structure of a molecule and its properties. In this chapter we’ll examine the conforma￾tions of various alkanes and cycloalkanes, focusing most of our attention on three of 
them: ethane, butane, and cyclohexane. You will see that even simple organic molecules 
can exist in many conformations. Conformational analysis will help us to visualize 
organic molecules as three-dimensional objects and to better understand their structure 
and properties.
3.1 Conformational Analysis of Ethane
Ethane is the simplest hydrocarbon that can have distinct conformations. Two, the staggered 
conformation and the eclipsed conformation, deserve special mention and are illus￾trated with molecular models in Figure 3.1.
In the staggered conformation, each CH bond of one carbon bisects an HCH 
angle of the other carbon. In the eclipsed conformation, each CH bond of one carbon 
is aligned with a CH bond of the other carbon.

space-filling models (right).102 Chapter 3 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Conformations and cis–trans Stereoisomers
The staggered and eclipsed conformations interconvert by rotation about the CC 
bond, and do so very rapidly. We’ll see just how rapidly later in this section.
Among the various ways in which the staggered and eclipsed forms are portrayed, 
wedge-and-dash, sawhorse, and Newman projection drawings are especially useful. These 
are shown for the staggered conformation of ethane in Figure 3.2 and for the eclipsed 
conformation in Figure 3.3.
We used wedge-and-dash drawings in earlier chapters, and so Figures 3.2a and 3.3a
are familiar to us. A sawhorse drawing (Figures 3.2b and 3.3b) shows the conformation 
of a molecule without having to resort to different styles of bonds. In a Newman projec￾tion (Figures 3.2c and 3.3c), we sight down the CC bond, and represent the front 
carbon by a point and the back carbon by a circle. Each carbon has three other bonds 
that are placed symmetrically around it.
Figures 3.2 and 3.3 illustrate the spatial relationship between bonds on adjacent 
carbons. Each HCCH unit in ethane is characterized by a torsion angle or dihedral 
angle, which is the angle between the HCC plane and the CCH plane. The 
torsion angle is easily seen in a Newman projection of ethane as the angle between CH 
bonds of adjacent carbons.

State University.

that are used in pairs to support a plank

2.9 kcal/mol 12 kJ/mol
Of the two conformations of ethane, the staggered is 12 kJ/mol (2.9 kcal/mol) more 
stable than the eclipsed. The staggered conformation is the most stable conformation, the 
eclipsed is the least stable conformation. Two main explanations have been offered for this 
difference. One holds that repulsions between bonds on adjacent atoms destabilize the eclipsed 
conformation. The other suggests that better electron delocalization stabilizes the staggered 
conformation. Both effects contribute to the preference for the staggered conformation.
The ethane conformations in which the torsion angles between adjacent bonds are 
other than 60° are said to have torsional strain. Eclipsed bonds produce the most torsional 
strain; staggered bonds none. Because three pairs of eclipsed bonds are responsible for 
12 kJ/mol (2.9 kcal/mol) of torsional strain in ethane, it is reasonable to assign an “energy 
cost” of 4 kJ/mol (1 kcal/mol) to each pair. In this chapter we’ll learn of additional sources 
of strain in molecules, which together with torsional strain comprise steric strain.
In principle, ethane has an infinite number of conformations that differ by only tiny 
increments in their torsion angles. Not only is the staggered conformation more stable than 
the eclipsed, it also is the most stable of all the conformations; the eclipsed is the least 
stable. Figure 3.4 shows how the potential energy of ethane changes for a 360° rotation 
Steric is derived from the Greek word 
stereos for “solid” and refers to the 
three-dimensional or spatial aspects 
of chemistry.104 Chapter 3 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Conformations and cis–trans Stereoisomers
about the carbon–carbon bond. Three equivalent eclipsed conformations and three equiv￾alent staggered conformations occur during the 360° rotation; the eclipsed conformations 
appear at the highest points on the curve (potential energy maxima), the staggered ones 
at the lowest (potential energy minima). Conformations that correspond to potential 
energy minima are called conformers.
At any instant, almost all of the molecules are in staggered conformations; hardly 
any are in eclipsed conformations.
Problem 3.2
Find the conformations in Figure 3.4 in which the hydrogens marked in red are (a) gauche 
and (b) anti.
Diagrams such as Figure 3.4 help us understand how the potential energy of a 
system changes during a process. The process can be as simple as the one described 
here—rotation about a carbon–carbon bond. Or it might be more complicated—a chemical 
reaction, for example. We will see applications of potential energy diagrams to a variety 
of processes throughout the text.
Let’s focus our attention on a portion of Figure 3.4. The region that lies between 
a torsion angle of 60° and 180° tracks the conversion of one staggered conformer of 
ethane to the next one. Both conformers are equivalent and equal in energy, but for one 
to get to the next, it must first pass through an eclipsed conformation and needs to gain 
12 kJ/mol (2.9 kcal/mol) of energy to reach it. This amount of energy is the activation 
energy (Ea) for the process. Molecules must become energized in order to undergo a 
chemical reaction or, as in this case, to undergo rotation about a carbon–carbon bond. 
Kinetic (thermal) energy is absorbed by a molecule from collisions with other molecules 
and is transformed into potential energy. When the potential energy exceeds Ea, the 
unstable arrangement of atoms that exists at that instant relaxes to a more stable structure, 
giving off its excess potential energy in collisions with other molecules or with the walls 
of a container. The point of maximum potential energy encountered by the reactants as 
they proceed to products is called the transition state. The eclipsed conformation is the 
transition state for the conversion of one staggered conformation of ethane to another.
Rotation about carbon–carbon bonds is one of the fastest processes in chemistry. 
Among the ways that we can describe the rate of a process is by its half-life, which is 
the length of time it takes for one half of the molecules to have reacted. It takes less 
than 10−6 s for half of the molecules in a sample of ethane to have gone from one stag￾gered conformation to another at 25°C.
A second way is by citing the experimentally determined rate constant k, which 
is related to the energy of activation by the Arrhenius equation:
k = Ae−Ea/RT
where A is a frequency factor related to the collision rate and geometry. The e−Ea/RT term 
is the probability that a collision will result in reaction, T is the temperature in kelvins, 
and R is a constant (8.314 kJ/K · mol or 1.987 × 10−3 kcal/K · mol). Ea is calculated by 
comparing reaction rates as a function of temperature. Raising the temperature decreases 
Ea/RT and increases Ae−Ea/RT, thereby increasing k. Small increases in Ea result in large 
decreases in rate. Quantitative studies of reaction rates are grouped under the general 
term kinetics and provide the basis for many of the structure–reactivity relationships that 
we will see in this and later chapters.
As shown in Figure 3.5, most of the molecules in a sample have energies that are 
clustered around some average value. Only molecules with a potential energy greater 
than Ea, however, are able to go over the transition state and proceed on. The number 
of these molecules is given by the shaded areas under the curve in Figure 3.5. The energy 
distribution curve flattens out at higher temperatures, and a greater proportion of mol￾ecules have energies in excess of Ea at T2 (higher) than at T1 (lower). The effect of 
temperature is quite pronounced; an increase of only 10°C produces a two- to threefold 
increase in the rate of a typical chemical process.
The structure that exists at the 
transition state is sometimes referred 
to as the transition structure or the 
activated complex.3.2 Conformational Analysis of Butane
The next alkane that we will examine is butane. In particular, we consider conformations 
related by rotation about the bond between the middle two carbons. Unlike ethane, in 
which the staggered conformations are equivalent, butane has two different staggered 
conformations, as shown in Figure 3.6. The methyl groups of butane are gauche to each 
other in one, anti in the other. Both conformations are staggered, so are free of torsional 
strain, but two of the methyl hydrogens of the gauche conformation lie within 210 pm 
(2.10 Å) of each other. This distance is less than the sum of their van der Waals radii 
(240 pm; 2.40 Å), and there is a repulsive force between the two hydrogens. The desta￾bilization of a molecule that results when two of its atoms are too close to each other is 
called van der Waals strain, or steric hindrance, and contributes to the total steric 
strain. In the case of butane, van der Waals strain makes the gauche conformation approx￾imately 3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol) less stable than the anti.
Figure 3.7 illustrates the potential energy relationships among the various confor￾mations of butane about the central carbon–carbon bond. The staggered conformations 
are more stable than the eclipsed. At any instant, almost all the molecules exist in stag￾gered conformations, and more are present in the anti conformation than in the gauche. 
The point of maximum potential energy lies some 21 kJ/mol (5 kcal/mol) above the anti 
conformation. The total strain in this structure is approximately equally divided between 
the torsional strain associated with three pairs of eclipsed bonds that was determined for

Higher alkanes having unbranched carbon chains are, like butane, most stable in their all-anti 
conformations. The energy difference between gauche and anti conformations is similar to 
that of butane, and appreciable quantities of the gauche conformation are present in liquid 
alkanes at 25°C. In depicting the conformations of higher alkanes it is often more helpful

Computational Chemistry: Molecular Mechanics 
and Quantum Mechanics
Molecular mechanics is a method for calculating the 
energy of a molecule by comparing selected structural 
features with those of “unstrained” standards. It makes no 
attempt to explain why the van der Waals radius of hydrogen 
is 120 pm (1.20 Å), why the bond angles in methane are 109.5°, 
why the C—C bond distance in ethane is 153 pm (1.53 Å), or 
why the staggered conformation of ethane is 12 kJ/mol 
(2.9 kcal/mol) more stable than the eclipsed. Instead, it uses 
these and other experimentally determined values as bench￾marks to create a “force field” to which the features of other 
substances are compared. If we assume that there are certain 
ideal values for bond angles, bond distances, and so on, it 
follows that deviations from them will destabilize a particular 
structure. The resulting increase in potential energy is referred 
to as the steric energy (Esteric) of the structure. Other terms 
include strain energy and steric strain.
Arithmetically, the steric energy of a structure can be sep￾arated into several components:
Esteric = Ebond stretch + Eangle bend + Etorsion + Enonbonded
where Ebond stretch is the strain that results when bond distances are 
distorted from their ideal values, Eangle bend from the expansion or 
contraction of bond angles, Etorsion from deviation of torsion angles 
from their stable relationship, and Enonbonded from attractive or 
repulsive forces between atoms that aren’t bonded to one 
another. It often happens that the shape of a molecule causes two 
atoms to be close in space, even though they may be separated 
by many bonds. Although van der Waals forces in alkanes are 
weakly attractive at most distances, two atoms that are closer 
than the sum of their van der Waals radii experience repulsive 
forces that can dominate the Enonbonded term. This resulting desta￾bilization is called van der Waals strain. Another frequently 
encountered nonbonded interaction is Coulombic, which is the 
attractive force between oppositely charged atoms or the repul￾sive force between atoms of like charge. In molecular mechanics, 
each component of strain is separately described by a mathemat￾ical expression developed and refined so that it gives solutions 
that match experimental observations for reference molecules. A 
computer-driven steric energy minimization routine searches for 
the combination of bond angles, distances, torsion angles, and 
nonbonded interactions that has the lowest total strain.
Consider the rotation about the C(2)—C(3) bond in butane 
discussed in Section 3.2 and its potential energy diagram shown in 
Figure 3.7. As calculated by the molecular mechanics force field, 
MM3, Esteric for the anti and gauche conformations of butane are 
14.5 and 18.4 kJ/mol (3.46 and 4.40 kcal/mol), respectively. The 
3.9 kJ/mol (0.94 kcal/mol) difference between these values is in 
good agreement with the experimentally determined value of 
3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol) cited in the opening paragraph of 
Section 3.2.
Problem 3.6
As calculated by molecular mechanics, Esteric for the methyl 
eclipsed conformation of butane is 36.9 kJ/mol (8.8 kcal/mol). 
On the basis of this and the Esteric values just cited, 
calculate the activation energy for rotation about the 
C(2)—C(3) bond.
Quantum mechanical calculations are much different and 
are based on the Schrödinger equation (Section 1.1). Instead of 
treating molecules as collections of atoms and bonds, quantum 
mechanics focuses on nuclei and electrons and treats electrons 
as waves. The energy of a chemical species is determined as the 
sum of the attractive (nucleus–electron) and repulsive (nucleus–
nucleus and electron–electron) forces plus the kinetic energies 
of the electrons and the nuclei. Minimizing the total energy gives 
a series of solutions called wave functions, which are equivalent 
to orbitals. Calculations based on quantum mechanics are gener￾ally referred to as molecular orbital (MO) calculations.
The computing requirements are so much greater for MO 
calculations than for molecular mechanics that MO calculations 
were once considered a specialty area. That is no longer true 
and it is now a routine matter to carry out MO calculations on 
personal computers. Steric-energy minimization by molecular 
mechanics is increasingly seen as a preliminary step prior to car￾rying out an MO calculation. A molecule is constructed, its geom￾etry minimized by molecular mechanics, then MO methods are 
used to calculate energies, geometries, and other properties.
Our first encounter with the results of computational 
methods is often visual. Figure 3.8a shows a ball-and-stick 
model of the methyl–methyl eclipsed conformation of butane as 
it would appear before doing any calculations. Either a molecu￾lar mechanics or MO calculation can produce, among other ren￾derings, the space-filling model of butane shown in Figure 3.8b,
which reveals the close contact between hydrogens that con￾tributes to van der Waals strain in the eclipsed conformation. 
However, only an MO calculation can generate an electrostatic 
potential map, which we see in Figure 3.8c as an overlay of 
charge distribution on a van der Waals surface.

to look at them from the side rather than end-on as in a Newman projection. Viewed from 
this perspective, the most stable conformations of pentane and hexane have their carbon 
“backbones” arranged in a zigzag fashion, as shown in Figure 3.9. All the bonds are stag￾gered, and the chains are characterized by anti arrangements of CCCC units.
3.4 The Shapes of Cycloalkanes: Planar or Nonplanar?
During the nineteenth century it was widely believed—incorrectly, as we’ll see—that 
cycloalkane rings are planar. A leading advocate of this view was the German chemist 
Adolf von Baeyer, who noted that compounds containing rings other than those based 
on cyclopentane and cyclohexane were rarely encountered naturally and were difficult to 
synthesize. Baeyer connected both observations and suggested that stability was related 
to how closely the internal angles of planar rings match the tetrahedral value of 109.5°. 
For example, the 60° bond angle of cyclopropane and the 90° bond angles of a planar 
cyclobutane ring are much smaller than the tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. Baeyer suggested 
that three- and four-membered rings suffer from what we now call angle strain. Angle 
strain is the strain a molecule has because one or more of its bond angles deviate from 
the ideal value; in the case of alkanes the ideal value is 109.5°.
According to Baeyer, cyclopentane should be the most stable of all the cycloalkanes 
because the ring angles of a planar pentagon, 108°, are closer to the tetrahedral angle 
than those of any other cycloalkane. A prediction of the Baeyer strain theory is that the 
cycloalkanes beyond cyclopentane should become increasingly strained and correspond￾ingly less stable. The angles of a regular hexagon are 120°, and the angles of larger 
polygons deviate more and more from the ideal tetrahedral angle.
Problems with the Baeyer strain theory become apparent when we use heats of 
combustion (Table 3.1) to probe the relative energies of cycloalkanes. The most impor￾tant column in the table is the heat of combustion per methylene (CH2) group. Because 
all of the cycloalkanes have molecular formulas of the type CnH2n, dividing the heat of 
combustion by n allows direct comparison of ring size and potential energy. Cyclopro￾pane has the highest heat of combustion per methylene group, which is consistent with 
the idea that its potential energy is raised by angle strain. Cyclobutane has less angle 
strain at each of its carbon atoms and a lower heat of combustion per methylene group. 
Cyclopentane, as expected, has a lower value still. Notice, however, that contrary to the 
prediction of the Baeyer strain theory, cyclohexane has a smaller heat of combustion per 
methylene group than cyclopentane. If angle strain were greater in cyclohexane than in 
cyclopentane, the opposite would have been observed.
Furthermore, the heats of combustion per methylene group of the very large rings are 
all about the same and similar to that of cyclopentane and cyclohexane. Rather than rising 
because of increasing angle strain in large rings, the heat of combustion per methylene group 
remains constant at approximately 659 kJ/mol (157.4 kcal/mol), the value cited in Section 
2.23 as the difference between successive members of a homologous series of alkanes. We 
conclude, therefore, that the bond angles of large cycloalkanes are not much different from 
the bond angles of alkanes themselves. The prediction of the Baeyer strain theory that angle 
strain increases steadily with ring size is contradicted by experimental fact.
The Baeyer strain theory is useful to us in identifying angle strain as a destabilizing 
effect. Its fundamental flaw is its assumption that the rings of cycloalkanes are planar. 
With the exception of cyclopropane, cycloalkanes are nonplanar. Sections 3.5–3.13 
describe the shapes of cycloalkanes. We’ll begin with cyclopropane.
Although better known now for the 
incorrect theory that cycloalkanes 
were planar, Baeyer was responsible 
for notable advances in the chemistry 
of organic dyes such as indigo and 
was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for work in that area.

and hexane in their all-anti (zigzag) 
conformations.3.5 Small Rings: Cyclopropane and Cyclobutane
Conformational analysis is far simpler in cyclopropane than in any other cycloalkane. 
Cyclopropane’s three carbon atoms are, of geometric necessity, coplanar, and rotation 
about its carbon–carbon bonds is impossible. You saw in Section 3.4 how angle strain 
in cyclopropane leads to an abnormally large heat of combustion. Let’s now look at 
cyclopropane in more detail to see how our orbital hybridization bonding model may be 
adapted to molecules of unusual geometry.
Strong sp3
–sp3
 σ bonds are not possible for cyclopropane, because the 60° bond 
angles of the ring do not permit the orbitals to be properly aligned for effective overlap 
(Figure 3.10). The less effective overlap that does occur leads to what chemists refer to 
as “bent” bonds. The electron density in the carbon–carbon bonds of cyclopropane does 
not lie along the internuclear axis but is distributed along an arc between the two carbon 
atoms. The ring bonds of cyclopropane are weaker than other carbon–carbon σ bonds.
In keeping with the “bent-bond” 
description of Figure 3.10, the 
carbon–carbon bond distance in 
cyclopropane (151 pm; 1.51 Å) is 
slightly shorter than that of ethane 
(153 pm; 1.53 Å) and cyclohexane 
(154 pm; 1.54 Å).

In addition to angle strain, cyclopropane is destabilized by torsional strain. Each 
C—H bond of cyclopropane is eclipsed with two others.
All adjacent pairs
of bonds are eclipsed
Cyclobutane not only has less angle strain than cyclopropane but also can reduce 
the torsional strain that goes with a planar geometry by adopting the nonplanar “puck￾ered” conformation shown in Figure 3.11, in which adjacent C—H bonds are twisted 
away from one another. A fully staggered arrangement in cyclobutane is not possible, 
but eclipsing interactions are decreased in the puckered form.
Problem 3.7
From Table 3.1, cyclohexane has the lowest heat of combustion per CH2 group of 659 kJ/mol 
(157.5 kcal/mol). This represents a CH2 group in a cyclic ring with negligible strain. Calculate 
the total strain energy for (a) the three CH2 groups of cyclopropane and (b) the four CH2 groups 
of cyclobutane.
Sample Solution (a) The heat of combustion for one cyclopropane CH2 group is 697 kJ/mol 
(166.6 kcal/mol). Subtracting this value from the cyclohexane value gives the strain energy for 
one of the cyclopropane CH2 groups: 697 − 659 = 38 kJ/mol (166.6 − 157.5 = 9.1 kcal/mol). 
Cyclopropane, with three CH2 groups, has a total strain energy of three times that amount: 
38 kJ/mol × 3 = 114 kJ/mol (9.1 kcal/mol × 3 = 27.3 kcal/mol).

Problem 3.8
The heats of combustion of ethylcyclopropane and methylcyclobutane have been measured 
as 3352 and 3384 kJ/mol (801.2 and 808.8 kcal/mol). Assign the correct heat of combustion 
to each isomer.
3.6 Cyclopentane
Angle strain in the planar conformation of cyclopentane is relatively small because the 
108° angles of a regular pentagon are not much different from the normal 109.5° bond 
angles of sp3
-hybridized carbon. The torsional strain, however, is substantial, because 
five bonds are eclipsed on the top face of the ring, and another set of five are eclipsed 
on the bottom face (Figure 3.12a). Some, but not all, of this torsional strain is relieved 
in nonplanar conformations. Two nonplanar conformations of cyclopentane, the envelope
(Figure 3.12b) and the half-chair (Figure 3.12c), are of similar energy.
Neighboring C—H bonds are eclipsed 
in any planar cycloalkane. Thus all 
planar conformations are destabilized 
by torsional strain.Figure 3.13
Stick models of the chair conformation 
of cyclohexane (a) in the chair 
perspective and (b) showing its 
staggered arrangement of bonds.
(a) (
(a) (b)
In the envelope conformation four of the carbon atoms are coplanar. The fifth carbon 
is out of the plane of the other four. There are three coplanar carbons in the half-chair 
conformation, with one carbon atom displaced above that plane and another below it. In 
both the envelope and the half-chair conformations, in-plane and out-of-plane carbons 
exchange positions rapidly. Equilibration between conformations of cyclopentane is very fast 
and occurs at rates similar to that of rotation about the carbon–carbon bond of ethane.
3.7 Conformations of Cyclohexane
Experimental evidence indicating that six-membered rings are nonplanar began to accu￾mulate in the 1920s. Eventually, Odd Hassel of the University of Oslo established that 
the most stable conformation of cyclohexane has the shape shown in Figures 3.13 and 3.14. 
This is called the chair conformation. With CCC bond angles of 111°, the chair 
conformation is nearly free of angle strain. All of its bonds are staggered, making it free 
of torsional strain as well. The staggered arrangement of bonds in the chair conformation 
of cyclohexane is apparent in a Newman-style projection.

The cyclohexane chair is best viewed from the side-on perspective, which is 
useful for describing its conformational properties. You may draw chair cyclohexane 
in this perspective using different techniques, but your final drawing must have the 
following features. Bonds that are across the ring from each other are parallel, as 
indicated for the pairs of red, green, and blue bonds in the following drawing. Notice 
also that the bonds shown in red are drawn with longer lines to show the side-on 
perspective. In reality, all of the CC bonds of cyclohexane are of the same length. 
Bonds are slanted as indicated. Although not planar, the cyclohexane ring should be 
level with respect to carbons 2 and 4 and carbons 1 and 5. The side-on perspective 
of cyclohexane is sometimes depicted with wedge bonds for C-1 to C-2 and C-3 to 
C-4 and a bold line for C-2 to C-3.

chemical reactivity.

A second, but much less stable, nonplanar conformation called the boat is shown 
in Figures 3.15 and 3.16. Like the chair, the boat conformation has bond angles that are 
approximately tetrahedral and is relatively free of angle strain. It is, however, destabilized 
by the torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds on four of its carbons. The close 
approach of the two “flagpole” hydrogens shown in Figure 3.15 contributes a small 
amount of van der Waals strain as well. Both sources of strain are reduced by rotation 
about the carbon–carbon bond to give the slightly more stable twist boat, or skew boat,
conformation (Figure 3.16).
The various conformations of cyclohexane are in rapid equilibrium with one 
another, but at any moment almost all of the molecules exist in the chair conformation. 
Less than 5 molecules per 100,000 are present in the skew boat conformation at 25°C. 
Thus, the discussion of cyclohexane conformational analysis that follows focuses exclu￾sively on the chair conformation.
3.8 Axial and Equatorial Bonds in Cyclohexane
One of the most important findings to come from conformational studies of cyclo￾hexane is that its 12 hydrogen atoms can be divided into two groups, as shown in 
Figure 3.17. Six of the hydrogens, called axial hydrogens, have their bonds parallel 
to a vertical axis that passes through the ring’s center. These axial bonds alternately 
are directed up and down on adjacent carbons. The second set of six hydrogens, called 
equatorial hydrogens, are located approximately along the equator of the molecule. 
Notice that the four bonds to each carbon are arranged tetrahedrally, consistent with 
an sp3
 hybridization of carbon.
The conformational features of six-membered rings are fundamental to organic 
chemistry, so it is essential that you have a clear understanding of the directional proper￾ties of axial and equatorial bonds and be able to represent them accurately. Figure 3.18 
offers some guidance.

3.9 Conformational Inversion in Cyclohexane
We have seen that alkanes are not locked into a single conformation. Rotation about their 
C—C bonds occurs rapidly, interconverting anti and gauche conformations. Cyclohexane, 
too, is conformationally mobile. Through a process known as ring inversion, or chair–
chair interconversion, one chair conformation is converted to another.

A potential energy diagram for chair–chair interconversion in cyclohexane is 
shown in Figure 3.19. In the first step, the chair is converted to a twist conformation. 
In this step, cyclohexane passes through a higher-energy half-chair conformation. The 
twist is converted to an alternate twist, via the boat conformation that is only 4–8 kJ/mol 
(1–2 kcal/mol) higher in energy. The second twist then proceeds to the inverted chair 
via another half-chair conformation. The twist conformations are intermediates in the 
process of ring inversion. Unlike a transition state, an intermediate is not a potential 
energy maximum but is a local minimum on the potential energy profile. The half-chair

The difference in energy between the chair and half-chair conformations is the activation 
energy for the chair–chair interconversion, which is 45 kJ/mol (10.8 kcal/mol). It is a 
very rapid process with a half-life of 10−5 s at 25°C.
The most important result of ring inversion is that any substituent that is axial in the 
original chair conformation becomes equatorial in the ring-inverted form and vice versa.

3.10 Conformational Analysis of 
Monosubstituted Cyclohexanes
Ring inversion in methylcyclohexane differs from that of cyclohexane in that the two chair 
conformations are not equivalent. In one chair the methyl group is axial; in the other it is 
equatorial. At room temperature approximately 95% of the molecules of methylcyclohexane 
are in the chair conformation that has an equatorial methyl group, whereas only 5% of 
the molecules have an axial methyl group.

When two conformations of a molecule are in equilibrium with each other, the one 
with the lower free energy predominates. Why is equatorial methylcyclohexane more 
stable than axial methylcyclohexane?
A methyl group is less crowded when it is equatorial than when it is axial. One of 
the hydrogens of an axial methyl group is within 190–200 pm (1.90–2.00 Å) of the axial 
hydrogens at C-3 and C-5. This distance is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii 
of two hydrogens (240 pm; 2.40 Å) and causes van der Waals strain in the axial confor￾mation. When the methyl group is equatorial, it experiences no significant crowding.

The greater stability of an equatorial methyl group, compared with an axial one, is 
another example of steric hindrance (Section 3.2). An axial substituent is said to 
be crowded because of 1,3-diaxial repulsions between itself and the other two axial 
substituents located on the same side of the ring.

The following questions relate to a cyclohexane ring in the chair conformation shown.
(a)  Is a methyl group at C-6 that is “down” axial or equatorial?
(b)  Is a methyl group that is “up” at C-1 more or less stable than a 
methyl group that is up at C-4?
(c)  Place a methyl group at C-3 in its most stable orientation. Is it 
up or down?
Sample Solution (a) First indicate the directional properties of the bonds to the ring 
carbons. A substituent is down if it is below the other substituent on the same carbon atom. 
A methyl group that is down at C-6 is therefore axial.

We can relate the conformational preference for an equatorial methyl group in

The preference for an equatorial methyl group in methylcyclohexane is therefore analogous 
to the preference for the anti conformation in butane. Two gauche butane-like units are 
present in axial methylcyclohexane that are absent in equatorial methylcyclohexane. As we 
saw earlier in Figure 3.7, the anti conformation of butane is 3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol) lower 
in energy than the gauche. Therefore, the energy difference between the equatorial and 
axial conformations of methylcyclohexane should be twice that, or 7.6 kJ/mol (1.8 kcal/mol). 
The experimentally measured difference of 7.2 kJ/mol (1.74 kcal/mol) gives us confidence 
that the same factors that govern the conformations of noncyclic compounds also apply to 
cyclic ones. What we call 1,3-diaxial repulsions in substituted cyclohexanes are really the 
same as van der Waals strain in the gauche conformations of alkanes.
Other substituted cyclohexanes are similar to methylcyclohexane. Two chair con￾formations exist in rapid equilibrium, and the one in which the substituent is equatorial 
is more stable. The relative amounts of the two conformations depend on the effective 
size of the substituent. The size of a substituent, in the context of cyclohexane conforma￾tions, is related to the degree of branching at the atom connected to the ring. A single 
atom, such as a halogen, does not take up much space, and its preference for an equatorial 
orientation is less than that of a methyl group.

The halogens F, Cl, Br, and I do not 
differ much in their preference for the 
equatorial position. As the atomic 
radius increases in the order F < Cl <
Br < I, so does the carbon–halogen 
bond distance, and the two effects 
tend to cancel.3.10 Conformational Analysis of Monosubstituted Cyclohexanes 117
One of the fundamental equations of thermodynamics con￾cerns systems at equilibrium and relates the equilibrium 
constant K to the difference in standard free energy (ΔG°) 
between the products and the reactants.
ΔG° = G°products − G°reactants = −RT ln K
where T is the absolute temperature in kelvins and the constant 
R equals 8.314 J/mol · K (1.99 cal/mol · K).
For the equilibrium between the axial and equatorial con￾formations of a monosubstituted cyclohexane,

the equilibrium constant is given by the expression

_____________________ [axial conformation] 
Inserting the appropriate values for R, T (298 K), and K gives the 
values of ΔG° listed in the following table for the various sub￾stituents discussed in Section 3.10.
The relationship between ΔG° and percent of equatorial 
cyclohexane is plotted in Figure 3.20. A larger percent of equato￾rial cyclohexane has a larger value of K with a more negative ΔG°.
Free energy and enthalpy are related by the expression
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
where ΔS° is the difference in entropy between the products and 
reactants. A positive ΔS° is accompanied by an increase in the 
disorder of a system. A positive ΔS° leads to a ΔG° that is more 
negative than ΔH° and a larger K than expected on the basis of 
enthalpy considerations alone. Conversely, a negative ΔS° gives 
a smaller K than expected. In the case of conformational equilibra￾tion between the chair forms of a substituted cyclohexane, ΔS° is 
close to zero and ΔG° and ΔH° are approximately equal.

3.11 Disubstituted Cycloalkanes: cis–trans Stereoisomers
When a cycloalkane bears two substituents on different carbons—methyl groups, for 
example—these substituents may be on the same or on opposite sides of the ring. When 
substituents are on the same side, we say they are cis to each other; if they are on opposite 
sides, they are trans to each other. Both terms come from the Latin, in which cis means 
“on this side” and trans means “across.”

Problem 3.12
Exclusive of compounds with double bonds, four hydrocarbons are constitutional isomers of 
cis- and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane. Identify these compounds.
The cis and trans forms of 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane are stereoisomers. 
Stereoisomers are isomers that have their atoms bonded in the same order—that is, they 
have the same constitution, but they differ in the arrangement of atoms in space. You 
learned in Section 2.23 that constitutional isomers could differ in stability. What about 
stereoisomers?
We can measure the energy difference between cis- and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclo￾propane by comparing their heats of combustion. As illustrated in Figure 3.21, the difference 
in their heats of combustion is a direct measure of the difference in their energies. Because 
the heat of combustion of trans-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane is 5 kJ/mol (1.2 kcal/mol) less 
than that of its cis stereoisomer, it follows that trans-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane is 5 kJ/mol 
(1.2 kcal/mol) more stable than cis-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane.
In this case, the relationship between stability and stereochemistry is easily 
explained on the basis of van der Waals strain. The methyl groups on the same side 
of the ring in cis-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane crowd each other and increase the potential 
Highly branched groups such as 
tert-butyl are commonly described 
as “bulky.”

Disubstituted cyclopropanes exemplify one of the simplest cases involving stability 
differences between stereoisomers. A three-membered ring has no conformational mobil￾ity, so cannot reduce the van der Waals strain between cis substituents on adjacent car￾bons without introducing other strain. The situation is different in disubstituted derivatives 
of cyclohexane.

The enthalpy difference between cis￾and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane 
can be determined from their heats 
of combustion. Van der Waals strain 
between methyl groups on the 
same side of the ring makes the cis 
stereoisomer less stable than the trans.120 Chapter 3 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Conformations and cis–trans Stereoisomers
Their heats of combustion (Table 3.2) reveal that trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane is 
8 kJ/mol (1.9 kcal/mol) more stable than the cis stereoisomer. It is unrealistic to believe 
that van der Waals strain between cis substituents is responsible, because the methyl 
groups are too far away from each other. To understand why trans-1,4-dimethylcyclo￾hexane is more stable than cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane, we need to examine each ste￾reoisomer in its most stable conformation.
cis-1,4-Dimethylcyclohexane can adopt either of two equivalent chair conforma￾tions, each having one axial methyl group and one equatorial methyl group. The two are 
in rapid equilibrium with each other by ring inversion. The equatorial methyl group 
becomes axial, and the axial methyl group becomes equatorial.

The methyl groups are cis because both are up relative to the hydrogen present at each 
carbon. If both methyl groups were down, they would still be cis to each other. Notice 
that ring inversion does not alter the cis relationship between the methyl groups. Nor 
does it alter their up-versus-down quality; substituents that are up in one conformation 
remain up in the ring inverted form.
The most stable conformation of trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane has both 
methyl groups in equatorial orientations. The two chair conformations of trans-1,4-
dimethylcyclohexane are not equivalent. One has two equatorial methyl groups; the other, 
two axial methyl groups.

TABLE 3.2 Heats of Combustion of Isomeric DimethylcyclohexanesThe more stable chair—the one with both methyl groups equatorial—is adopted by most 
of the trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane molecules.
trans-1,4-Dimethylcyclohexane is more stable than cis-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane 
because both of the methyl groups are equatorial in its most stable conformation. One 
methyl group must be axial in the cis stereoisomer. Remember, it is a general rule that 
any substituent is more stable in an equatorial orientation than in an axial one. It is worth 
pointing out that the 8 kJ/mol (1.9 kcal/mol) energy difference between cis- and trans￾1,4-dimethylcyclohexane is nearly the same as the energy difference between the axial 
and equatorial conformations of methylcyclohexane. There is a simple reason for this: in 
both instances the less stable structure has one axial methyl group, and the 8 kJ/mol 
(1.9 kcal/mol) energy difference can be considered the “energy cost” of having a methyl 
group in an axial rather than an equatorial orientation.
Like the 1,4-dimethyl derivatives, trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane has a lower heat 
of combustion (see Table 3.2) and is more stable than cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The 
cis stereoisomer has two chair conformations of equal energy, each containing one axial 
and one equatorial methyl group.

As in the 1,4-dimethylcyclohexanes, the 8 kJ/mol (1.9 kcal/mol) energy difference 
between the more stable (trans) and the less stable (cis) stereoisomer is attributed to the 
strain associated with the presence of an axial methyl group in the cis stereoisomer.
Probably the most interesting observation in Table 3.2 concerns the 1,3-
dimethylcyclohexanes. Unlike the 1,2- and 1,4-dimethylcyclohexanes, in which the trans 
stereoisomer is more stable than the cis, we find that cis-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane is 
8 kJ/mol (1.9 kcal/mol) more stable than trans-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane. Why?
The most stable conformation of cis-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane has both methyl 
groups equatorial.

these methyl substituents cis or trans?

Sample Solution
Cyclohexane rings that bear tert-butyl substituents are examples of conformation￾ally biased molecules. A tert-butyl group has such a pronounced preference for the 
equatorial orientation that it will strongly bias the equilibrium to favor such conforma￾tions. This does not mean that ring inversion does not occur, however. Ring inversion 
does occur, but at any instant only a tiny fraction of the molecules exist in conformations 
having axial tert-butyl groups. It is not strictly correct to say that tert-butylcyclohexane 
and its derivatives are “locked” into a single conformation; conformations related by ring 
inversion are in rapid equilibrium with one another, but the distribution between them 
strongly favors those in which the tert-butyl group is equatorial.

3.13 Medium and Large Rings
Beginning with cycloheptane, which has four conformations of similar energy, confor￾mational analysis of cycloalkanes becomes more complicated. The same fundamental 
principles apply to medium and large rings as apply to smaller ones—but there are more 
atoms, more bonds, and more conformational possibilities.
3.14 Polycyclic Ring Systems
Polycyclic compounds are those that contain more than one ring. The IUPAC classifies 
polycyclic structures according to the minimum number of bond cleavages required to 
generate a noncyclic structure. The structure is bicyclic if two bond disconnections yield 
an open-chain structure, tricyclic if three, tetracyclic if four, and so on. Adamantane, a 
naturally occurring hydrocarbon found in petroleum, for example, is tricyclic because 
three bond cleavages are needed before an open-chain structure results.
Adamantane
The correct number of rings may be determined by different sets of disconnections, and 
the final open-chain structure need not be the same for different sets. All that matters is 
finding the minimum number of disconnections.
Problem 3.17
Cubane (C8H8) is the common name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon shown. As its 
name implies, its structure is that of a cube. How many rings are present in cubane 
according to the bond-disconnection rule?
In addition to classifying polycyclic compounds according to the number of rings 
they contain, we classify them with respect to the way in which the rings are joined. In 
a spiro compound, one atom is common to two rings.
The simplest spiro alkane is spiro[2.2]pentane, a molecular model of which illus￾trates an interesting structural feature of spiro compounds. The two rings lie at right 
angles to each other.
Spiro[2.2]pentane
The IUPAC names of spiro alkanes take the form spiro[number.number]alkane. The 
alkane suffix is simply the name of the unbranched alkane having the same number of carbons 
as those in the two rings. The numbers inside the brackets are, in ascending order, the number 
of carbons unique to each ring. Thus, eight carbons make up the two rings of spiro[3.4]
octane; the spiro carbon is bridged by three carbons of one ring and four carbons of the other.

carbon and proceeds consecutively around the smaller ring away from the spiro carbon, 
through it, then around the larger ring. As with alkanes, the direction is chosen so as to 
give the lower locant at the first point of difference, substituents are listed in alphabetical 
order, and the locants and substituents appear first in the name.

normally referred to as fused-ring compounds, but for classification and naming purposes 
they are placed in the “bridged” category. The bridge in these cases is the common side

3.15 Heterocyclic Compounds
Not all cyclic compounds are hydrocarbons. Many substances include an atom other than 
carbon, called a heteroatom (Section 1.6), as part of a ring. A ring that contains at least 
one heteroatom is called a heterocycle, and a substance based on a heterocyclic ring is a heterocyclic compound. Each of the following heterocyclic ring systems will be 
encountered in this text:

N
H
Piperidine

The names cited are common names, which have been in widespread use for a long time 
and are acceptable in IUPAC nomenclature.
The shapes of heterocyclic rings are very much like those of their all-carbon ana￾logs. Thus, six-membered heterocycles such as piperidine exist in a chair conformation 
analogous to cyclohexane.

Sulfur-containing heterocycles are also common. Compounds in which sulfur is the 
heteroatom in three-, four-, five-, and six-membered rings, as well as larger rings, are all 
well known. Two interesting heterocyclic compounds that contain sulfur–sulfur bonds 
are lipoic acid and lenthionine.

form of elemental sulfur is an eight￾membered ring of sulfur atoms.
3.16 Summary 127
In this chapter we explored the three-dimensional shapes of alkanes and cycloalkanes. The most 
important point to be taken from the chapter is that a molecule adopts the shape that minimizes 
its total strain. The sources of strain in alkanes and cycloalkanes are:
1. Bond length distortion: destabilization of a molecule that results when one or more of its 
bond distances are different from the normal values
2. Angle strain: destabilization that results from distortion of bond angles from their normal 
values
3. Torsional strain: destabilization that results when bonds on adjacent atoms are not staggered
4. Van der Waals strain: destabilization that results when atoms or groups on nonadjacent 
atoms are too close to one another
3.16 SUMMARY128 Chapter 3 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Conformations and cis–trans Stereoisomers
The various spatial arrangements available to a molecule by rotation about single bonds are 
called conformations, and conformational analysis is the study of the differences in stability and 
properties of the individual conformations. Rotation about carbon–carbon single bonds is normally 
very fast, occurring hundreds of thousands of times per second at room temperature. Molecules are 
rarely frozen into a single conformation but engage in rapid equilibration among the conformations 
that are energetically accessible.
Section 3.1 The most stable conformation of ethane is the staggered conformation. It is 
approximately 12 kJ/mol (2.9 kcal/mol) more stable than the eclipsed, which is 
the least stable conformation.

The difference in energy between the two results from two effects: a 
destabilization of the eclipsed conformation due to electron–electron repulsion 
in aligned bonds, and a stabilization of the staggered conformation due to better 
electron delocalization. At any instant, almost all the molecules of ethane reside in 
the staggered conformation.
Section 3.2 The two staggered conformations of butane are not equivalent. The anti
conformation is more stable than the gauche.
Anti conformation of butane Gauche conformation of butane
Neither conformation suffers torsional strain, because each has a staggered 
arrangement of bonds. The gauche conformation is less stable because of van 
der Waals strain involving the methyl groups.
Section 3.3 Higher alkanes adopt a zigzag conformation of the carbon chain in which all 
the bonds are staggered.
OctaneSection 3.4 At one time the rings of all cycloalkanes were believed to be planar. It was 
expected that cyclopentane would be the least strained cycloalkane because the 
angles of a regular pentagon (108°) are closest to the tetrahedral angle of 
109.5°. Heats of combustion established that this is not so. With the exception 
of cyclopropane, the rings of all cycloalkanes are nonplanar.
Section 3.5 Cyclopropane is planar and destabilized by angle strain and torsional strain. 
Cyclobutane is nonplanar and less strained than cyclopropane.
Cyclopropane Cyclobutane
Section 3.6 Cyclopentane has two nonplanar conformations that are of similar stability: the 
envelope and the half-chair.
Envelope conformation of cyclopentane Half-chair conformation of cyclopentane
Section 3.7 Three conformations of cyclohexane have approximately tetrahedral angles at 
carbon: the chair, the boat, and the twist. The chair is by far the most stable; it 
is free of torsional strain, but the others are not. When a cyclohexane ring is 
present in a compound, it almost always adopts a chair conformation.
Chair Twist Boat
Section 3.8 The C—H bonds in the chair conformation of cyclohexane are not all equivalent 
but are divided into two sets of six each, called axial and equatorial.
Axial bonds to H in cyclohexane Equatorial bonds to H in cyclohexane
Section 3.9 Conformational inversion is rapid in cyclohexane and causes all axial bonds to 
become equatorial and vice versa. As a result, a monosubstituted derivative of 
cyclohexane adopts the chair conformation in which the substituent is equatorial. 
No bonds are made or broken in this process.
3.16 Summary 129130 Chapter 3 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes: Conformations and cis–trans Stereoisomers
Section 3.10 A substituent is less crowded and more stable when it is equatorial than when it 
is axial on a cyclohexane ring. Ring inversion of a monosubstituted cyclohexane 
allows the substituent to become equatorial.
Methyl group axial (less stable) Methyl group equatorial (more stable)
 ring inversion
Branched substituents, especially tert-butyl, have an increased preference for the 
equatorial position.
Sections 3.11 Stereoisomers are isomers that have the same constitution but differ in the 
arrangement of atoms in space. cis-1,3-Dimethylcyclohexane and trans-1,3-
dimethylcyclohexane are stereoisomers. The cis isomer is more stable than the trans.

Section 3.13 Higher cycloalkanes have angles at carbon that are close to tetrahedral and are 
sufficiently flexible to adopt conformations that reduce their torsional strain. 
They tend to be populated by several different conformations of similar stability.
Section 3.14 Cyclic hydrocarbons can contain more than one ring. Spiro hydrocarbons are 
characterized by the presence of a single carbon that is common to two rings. 
Bicyclic alkanes contain two rings that share two or more atoms.
Section 3.15 Substances that contain one or more atoms other than carbon as part of a ring 
are called heterocyclic compounds. Rings in which the heteroatom is oxygen, 
nitrogen, or sulfur rank as both the most common and the most important.

Chirality
In Chapter 3 we saw that rotation about a single bond in a 
molecule could generate a different conformation. In this chapter 
we explore a more subtle kind of isomerism, one of mirror￾image configurational relationships. Its foundations were laid 
by Louis Pasteur’s 1848 discovery of mirror-image tartaric acid 
crystals and suggestion that the spatial arrangement of its atoms 
was responsible. Later, in 1874, Jacobus van’t Hoff* and Joseph 
Achille Le Bel each proposed that the four bonds to carbon were 
directed toward the corners of a tetrahedron.
Our major objectives in this chapter are to describe the 
fundamental principles and properties of molecules as three￾dimensional objects and to become familiar with stereochemical 
terms and notation. A full understanding of organic and biologi￾cal chemistry requires an awareness of the spatial requirements 
for interaction between molecules; this chapter provides the 
basis for that understanding.
4.1 Introduction to Chirality: Enantiomers
Because the structure of a substance determines its properties, 
it is useful to remind ourselves of the factors that contribute to 
molecular structure. It begins with the atoms present and their

in chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure—two topics far removed from 
stereochemistry.

the other traces a counterclockwise path.

Elemental Composition Empirical Formula Molecular Formula
From the molecular formula, a variety of experimental data leads to a molecule’s 
constitution—that is, the order in which the atoms are connected. Next, the three￾dimensional spatial arrangement of substituent groups defines the configuration of 
specific atoms or structural units.
Molecular Formula Constitution/Connectivity Configuration

cis-1,3-Dimethylcyclopentane trans-1,3-Dimethylcyclopentane
Here, the cis and trans prefixes describe relative configuration. In the cis stereoisomer, 
both methyl groups lie on the same side of the cyclopentane ring. In the trans, they are 
on opposite sides.
All of these structural factors contribute to the various conformations available to 
a molecule by rotation about single bonds (Sections 3.1–3.10).
Configuration Conformation
A full understanding, however, requires that we expand the concept of configura￾tion so as to include chirality. Chirality is derived from the Greek word cheir, for 
“hand,” and was coined by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1894 who defined it 
this way:
I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, chiral, and say it has chirality, 
if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with 
itself.
Applying Thomson’s term to chemistry, we say that a molecule is chiral if its two 
mirror-image forms are not superimposable in three dimensions. Thus, it is entirely 
appropriate to speak of the “handedness” of molecules. The opposite of chiral is achiral.
A molecule that is superimposable on its mirror image is achiral.
In organic chemistry, chirality most often occurs in molecules that contain a carbon 
that is attached to four different groups. An example is bromochlorofluoromethane 
(BrClFCH).

Bromochlorofluoromethane
As shown in Figure 4.1, the two mirror images of bromochlorofluoromethane cannot be 
superimposed on each other. Because the two mirror images of bromochlorofluorometh￾ane are not superimposable, BrClFCH is chiral.
The mirror images of bromochlorofluoromethane have the same constitution. That 
is, the atoms are connected in the same order. But they differ in the arrangement of their 
atoms in space; they are stereoisomers. Stereoisomers that are related as an object and 
its nonsuperimposable mirror image are classified as enantiomers. The word enantiomer
describes a particular relationship between two objects. One cannot look at a single 
molecule in isolation and ask if it is an enantiomer any more than one can look at an

greatest scientists, responsible for 
fundamental contributions in 
numerous areas. Thomson’s work

individual human being and ask, “Is that person a cousin?” Furthermore, just as an object 
has one, and only one, mirror image, a chiral molecule can have one, and only one, 
enantiomer.
Notice in Figure 4.1c, where the two enantiomers of bromochlorofluoromethane 
are similarly oriented, that the difference between them corresponds to an interchange 
of the positions of bromine and chlorine (A compared to B′). It will generally be true 
for species of the type C(w,x,y,z), where w, x, y, and z are different atoms or groups, that 
an exchange of two of them converts a structure to its enantiomer.
Consider next a molecule such as chlorodifluoromethane (ClF2CH), in which two 
of the atoms attached to carbon are the same. Figure 4.2 shows two molecular models 
of ClF2CH drawn so as to be mirror images. As is evident from these drawings, it is a 
simple matter to merge the two models so that all the atoms match. Because mirror-image 
representations of chlorodifluoromethane are superimposable on each other, ClF2CH is 
achiral.

Bromochlorofluoromethane is therefore a chiral molecule. The two mirror-image forms are called 
enantiomers.The surest test for chirality is a careful examination of mirror-image forms for 
superimposability. Working with models provides the best practice in dealing with mol￾ecules as three-dimensional objects and is strongly recommended.

are chiral when w, x, y, and z are different. The IUPAC recommends that a tetrahedral 
carbon attached to four different atoms or groups be called a chirality center, which is 
the term that we will use. Several earlier terms, including asymmetric center, asymmetric 
carbon, chiral center, stereogenic center, and stereocenter, are still widely used.
Noting the presence of one (but not more than one) chirality center is a simple, rapid 
way to determine if a molecule is chiral. For example, C-2 is a chirality center in 2-butanol; 
it bears H, OH, CH3, and CH3CH2 as its four different groups. By way of contrast, none of 
the carbon atoms bear four different groups in the achiral alcohol 2-propanol.

A carbon atom in a ring can be a chirality center if it bears two different groups 
and the path traced around the ring from that carbon in one direction is different from 
that traced in the other. The carbon atom that bears the methyl group in 1,2-epoxypropane, 
for example, is a chirality center. The sequence of groups is OCH2 as one proceeds 
clockwise around the ring from that atom, but is H2CO in the counterclockwise direc￾tion. Similarly, C-4 is a chirality center in limonene.

One final, very important point: Everything we have said in this section concerns 
molecules that have one and only one chirality center; molecules with more than one 
chirality center may or may not be chiral. Molecules that have more than one chirality 
center will be discussed in Sections 4.10–4.12.
4.3 Symmetry in Achiral Structures
Certain structural features can help us determine whether a molecule is chiral or achiral. 
For example, a molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is super￾imposable on its mirror image and is achiral.
A plane of symmetry bisects a molecule so that one half of the molecule is the 
mirror image of the other half. The achiral molecule chlorodifluoromethane, for example, 
has the plane of symmetry shown in Figure 4.3.

are chiral? Which are achiral?

A point in the center of a molecule is a center of symmetry if any line drawn 
from it to some element of the structure will, when extended an equal distance in the 
opposite direction, encounter an identical element. trans-1,3-Cyclobutanediol has a plane 
of symmetry as well as a center of symmetry. The center of symmetry is the center of 
the molecule. A line starting at one of the hydroxyl groups and drawn through the center 
of the molecule encounters the equidistant hydroxyl group on the opposite side. Mirror 
images A and B are superimposable, and trans-1,3-cyclobutanediol is achiral.

(a) Where is the plane of symmetry in trans-1,3-cyclobutanediol?
(b) Does cis-1,3-cyclobutanediol possess a center of symmetry? A plane of symmetry? 
Is it chiral or achiral?
Planes of symmetry are easier to identify and more common than centers of sym￾metry. Because either one is sufficient to make a molecule achiral, look first for a plane 
of symmetry. A molecule without a plane or center of symmetry is likely to be chiral, 
but the superimposability test must be applied to be certain.
4.4 Optical Activity
The experimental facts that led van’t Hoff and Le Bel to propose that molecules having 
the same constitution could differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space concerned 
the physical property of optical activity. Optical activity is the ability of a chiral sub￾stance to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light and is measured using an instrument 
called a polarimeter (Figure 4.4).
The light used to measure optical activity has two properties: it consists of a single 
wavelength and it is plane-polarized. The wavelength used most often is 589 nm (called 
the D line), which corresponds to the yellow light produced by a sodium lamp. Except 
for giving off light of a single wavelength, a sodium lamp is like any other lamp in that 
its light is unpolarized, meaning that the plane of its electric field vector can have any 
orientation along the line of travel. A beam of unpolarized light is transformed to plane￾polarized light by passing it through a polarizing filter, which removes all the waves 
except those that have their electric field vector in the same plane. This plane-polarized 
light now passes through the sample tube containing the substance to be examined, either 
in the liquid phase or as a solution in a suitable solvent (usually water, ethanol, or chlo￾roform). The sample is “optically active” if it rotates the plane of polarized light. The 
direction and magnitude of rotation are measured using a second polarizing filter (the 
“analyzer”) and cited as α, the observed rotation.
To be optically active, the sample must contain a chiral substance and one enantiomer 
must be present in excess of the other. A substance that does not rotate the plane of polar￾ized light is said to be optically inactive. All achiral substances are optically inactive.
What causes optical rotation? The plane of polarization of a light wave undergoes 
a minute rotation when it encounters a chiral molecule. Enantiomeric forms of a chiral 
molecule cause a rotation of the plane of polarization in exactly equal amounts but in 
opposite directions. A solution containing equal quantities of enantiomers therefore 
The phenomenon of optical activity 
was discovered by the French 
physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1815.

Figure 4.4
The sodium lamp emits light moving in all planes. When the light passes through the first polarizing filter, 
only one plane emerges. The plane-polarized beam enters the sample compartment, which contains a 
solution enriched in one of the enantiomers of a chiral substance. The plane rotates as it passes through the 
solution. A second polarizing filter (called the analyzer) is attached to a movable ring calibrated in degrees 
that is used to measure the angle of rotation α. exhibits no net rotation because all the tiny increments of clockwise rotation produced 
by molecules of one “handedness” are canceled by an equal number of increments of 
counterclockwise rotation produced by molecules of the opposite handedness.
Mixtures containing equal quantities of enantiomers are called racemic mixtures.
Racemic mixtures are optically inactive. Conversely, when one enantiomer is present in 
excess, a net rotation of the plane of polarization is observed. When all the molecules 
are of the same handedness, the substance is homochiral or enantiopure. In common 
practice, when we have a mixture of enantiomers where one isomer is present in larger 
amounts, percent enantiomeric excess (ee) or enantiomeric ratio (er) is used to describe 
the mixture, where:
ee = (% Major enantiomer) − (% Minor enantiomer)
and
er = (% Major enantiomer):(% Minor enantiomer)
For example, a mixture of enantiomers comprised of 80% one isomer and 20% of the 
other, has an 80:20 enantiomeric ratio. The excess of the major isomer above the minor 
isomer gives the enantiomeric excess, ee = 80 − 20 = 60.
Problem 4.5
A sample of the chiral molecule limonene has an enantiomeric ratio (er) of 97.5:2.5. What is 
the percent enantiomeric excess (ee)?
Rotation of the plane of polarized light in the clockwise sense is taken as positive 
(+), and rotation in the counterclockwise sense as negative (−). Older terms for these 
are dextrorotatory and levorotatory, from the Latin prefixes dexter- (“to the right”) and 
laevus- (“to the left”), respectively. At one time, the symbols d and l were used to dis￾tinguish between enantiomers. Thus, the dextrorotatory enantiomer of 2-butanol was 
called d-2-butanol, and the levorotatory form l-2-butanol; a racemic mixture of the two 
was referred to as dl-2-butanol. Current custom uses algebraic signs instead, as in 
(+)-2-butanol, (−)-2-butanol, and (±)-2-butanol, respectively.
The observed rotation α of an optically pure substance depends on how many mol￾ecules the light beam encounters. A filled polarimeter tube twice the length of another 
produces twice the observed rotation, as does a solution twice as concentrated. To account 
for the effects of path length and concentration, chemists use the term specific rotation,
given the symbol [α] and calculated from the observed rotation according to the expression
[α] = _100α
cl
where c is the concentration of the sample in grams per 100 mL of solution, and l is the 
length of the polarimeter tube in decimeters. (One decimeter is 10 cm.)
Specific rotation is a physical property of a substance, just as melting point, boiling 
point, density, and solubility are. For example, the lactic acid obtained from milk is 
exclusively a single enantiomer. We cite its specific rotation in the form [α]D
25 = +3.8°. 
The temperature in degrees Celsius and the wavelength of light at which the measurement 
was made are indicated as superscripts and subscripts, respectively. The subscript d
stands for the so-called “d-line” of sodium, which has a wavelength of 589 nm. Optical 
purity corresponds to enantiomeric excess and is calculated from the specific rotation:
ee = Optical purity = specific rotation of sample _______________________________ specific rotation of pure enantiomer× 100
Problem 4.6
(a) Cholesterol isolated from natural sources is enantiopure. The observed rotation 
of a 0.3-g sample of cholesterol in 15 mL of chloroform solution contained in a 
10-cm polarimeter tube is −0.78°. Calculate the specific rotation of cholesterol.
continued
If concentration is expressed as grams 
per milliliter of solution instead of 
grams per 100 mL, an equivalent 
expression is
[α] = _α

(b) A sample of synthetic cholesterol consisting entirely of (+)-cholesterol was mixed 
with some natural (−)-cholesterol. The specific rotation of the mixture was −13°. 
What fraction of the mixture was (+)-cholesterol?
It is convenient to distinguish between enantiomers by prefixing the sign of rotation 
to the name of the substance. For example, we refer to one of the enantiomers of 2-butanol 
as (+)-2-butanol and the other as (−)-2-butanol. Optically pure (+)-2-butanol has a spe￾cific rotation [α]D
27 of +13.5°; optically pure (−)-2-butanol has an exactly opposite specific 
rotation [α]D
27 of −13.5°.
4.5 Absolute and Relative Configuration
The three-dimensional spatial arrangement of substituents at a chirality center is its 
absolute configuration. Neither the sign nor the magnitude of rotation by itself can tell 
us the absolute configuration of a substance. Thus, one of the following structures is 
(+)-2-butanol and the other is (−)-2-butanol, but without additional information we can’t 
tell which is which.
C
H
H3C
CH3CH2
OH
H
CH3
CH2CH3
HO C
Although no absolute configuration was known for any substance until the mid￾twentieth century, organic chemists had experimentally determined the configurations of 
thousands of compounds relative to one another (their relative configurations) through 
chemical interconversion. To illustrate, consider a reaction that doesn’t involve any of 
the bonds directly attached to the chirality center.
OH OH
+ H2
Pd
3-Buten-2-ol 2-Butanol 27
D [ ] +33.2°
Hydrogen 27
D [ ] +13.5°
The fact that reactant and product have the same sign of rotation when they have the 
same relative configuration is established by the experiment; it could not have been 
predicted in advance of the experiment. Note also that the experiment does not tell us 
what the arrangement of bonds is; it tells us only that the relative configuration is the 
same when both compounds are dextrorotatory.
Compounds that have the same relative configuration can have optical rotations of 
opposite sign. For example, treatment of (−)-2-methyl-1-butanol with hydrogen bromide 
converts it to (+)-1-bromo-2-methylbutane.

This reaction does not involve any of the bonds to the chirality center, and so both the 
starting alcohol (−) and the product bromide (+) have the same relative configuration.
An elaborate network connecting signs of rotation and relative configurations was 
developed that included the most important compounds of organic and biological chem￾istry. When, in 1951, the absolute configuration of (+)-tartaric acid was determined, the 
absolute configurations of all the compounds whose configurations had been related to

chapter we will use red and blue 
frames to call attention to structures 
that are enantiomeric.

4.6 Cahn–Ingold–Prelog R,S Notation
Shortly after the problem of absolute configuration was settled, a method to specify 
configuration symbolically as an alternative to drawings was developed by R. S. Cahn, 
Christopher Ingold, and Vladimir Prelog. Their approach contains two elements: rules for 
ranking substituents at a chirality center and a protocol for viewing their spatial orientation. 
As an example, consider the enantiomers A and B of bromochlorofluoromethane.
H
F Br
Cl
H
F Br
Cl
A B
The Cahn–Ingold–Prelog system ranks substituents at the chirality center in order 
of decreasing atomic number. Here the order is Br > Cl > F > H. The next step is to 
orient the molecules so that the bond to the lowest ranked substituent—in this case 
H—points away from us and determine if the sequence of decreasing priority of the other 
three substituents is clockwise or counterclockwise.
F Cl
Br
Cl F
Br
A B
If this path is clockwise as in A, the configuration is R (Latin “rectus” “right,” “correct”). 
If it is counterclockwise as in B, the configuration is S (Latin “sinister” “left”).
It has been experimentally determined that (R)-bromochlorofluoromethane is levo￾rotatory (−). Therefore, (S)-bromochlorofluoromethane is dextrorotatory (+). When the 
connection between configuration and sign of rotation is known, it is common practice to 
incorporate both into the name of the compound. Thus, A is (R)-(−)-bromochlorofluoromethane 
and B is (S)-(+)-bromochlorofluoromethane.
In most organic compounds, the groups attached to a chirality center are more 
complicated than single atoms, and the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog system incorporates a series 
of rules to accommodate this fact. These sequence rules are described in Table 4.1.

Rule Example
1. Higher atomic number takes precedence 
over lower.
As described for the case of bromochlorofluoromethane, the sequence priority is 
Br > Cl > F > H.
2. When two atoms directly attached to the 
chirality center are the same, compare the 
atoms attached to them on the basis of their 
atomic numbers. Precedence is determined 
at the first point of difference.
The substituents at the chirality center in 2-chlorobutane are Cl, H, CH3, 
and CH2CH3.
Cl
Ethyl [C(C,H,H) outranks methyl [C(H,H,H)].
In order of decreasing priority, the substituents at the chirality center are:
Cl > CH2CH3 > CH3 > H
3. Work outward from the point of attachment, 
comparing all the atoms attached to a 
particular atom before proceeding further 
along the chain.
The substituents at the chirality center in 1-chloro-3,4-dimethylpentane are 
CH2CH2Cl, H, CH3, and CH(CH3)2.
Cl
Isopropyl [CH(CH3)2] counts as [C(C,C,H)] and outranks
CH2CH2Cl, which counts as [C(C,H,H)].
4. When working outward from the point of 
attachment, always evaluate substituent 
atoms one by one, never as a group.
The substituents at the chirality center in 1-chloro-2,3,3-trimethylpentane are 
CH2Cl, H, CH3, and C(CH3)3.
Cl
CH2Cl counts as [C(Cl,H,H)] and outranks tert-butyl [C(CH3)3], which is 
treated as [C(C,C,C)].
5. An atom that is multiply bonded to another 
atom is considered to be replicated as a 
substituent on that atom.
The substituents at the chirality center in 2-methyl-1-pentene are CH2CH3, 
H, CH3, and CHCH2.
CHCH2 counts as [C(C,C,H)] and outranks CH2CH3, which is treated as 
[C(C,H,H)].
TABLE 4.1 The Cahn–Ingold–Prelog Sequence RulesSample Solution (a) The highest ranking substituent at the chirality center of 2-methyl-1-
butanol is CH2OH; the lowest is H. Of the remaining two, ethyl outranks methyl.
Order of precedence: CH2OH > > CH3CH2 CH3 > H
The lowest ranking group (hydrogen) points away from us in the drawing. The three highest 
ranking groups trace a clockwise path from CH2OH → CH3CH2 → CH3.

H3C CH2OH
This compound therefore has the R configuration. It is (R)-(+)-2-methyl-1-butanol.
Compounds in which a chirality center is part of a ring are handled in an analogous 
fashion. To determine, for example, whether the configuration of (+)-4-methylcyclohex￾ene is R or S, treat the right- and left-hand paths around the ring as if they were inde￾pendent groups.

The Cahn–Ingold–Prelog system is the standard method of stereochemical nota￾tion. It replaced an older system based on analogies to specified reference compounds 
that used the prefixes d and l, a system that is still used for carbohydrates and amino 
acids. We will use d and l notation when we get to Chapters 23 and 25, but won’t need 
it until then.
Homochirality and Symmetry Breaking
The classic work of Louis Pasteur in 1848 showed that an opti￾cally inactive substance then known as “racemic acid” found 
in grapes is a 1:1 mixture of (+)- and (−)-tartaric acids.

Although Pasteur’s discovery was transformative in 
respect to the progress of science, the tartaric acid case turns 
out to be an exceptional one. Naturally occurring chiral com￾pounds are almost always homochiral—their biosynthesis 
provides only a single enantiomer. Lemons contain only (R)-(+)-
limonene, and apples only (S)-(−)-malic acid. Only the S enantio￾mer of methionine, never the R, is one of the amino acid building 
blocks of peptides and proteins.

There are, however, examples where each enantiomer of a nat￾ural product occurs to the exclusion of the other. The S-(+) enan￾tiomer of 5-methylheptan-3-one is present in the female bristle

How molecular homochirality came to dominate the natu￾ral world to the degree it does remains one of the great unan￾swered, and perhaps unanswerable, questions of science. The 
main problem is known as “symmetry breaking,” especially as it 
applies to what origins-of-life theories term the “last universal 
ancestor” (LUA). Without going into detail, the LUA is the most 
recent organism from which all living things on Earth have 
descended, where “recent” encloses a time period between 
now and 3.5 billion years ago. Symmetry breaking is more fun￾damental in that it simply recognizes that our world and its mir￾ror image are equally likely in the absence of some event or 
force that favors one enantiomer of the LUA or one of its descen￾dants over all others.
What event? What force?
In one scenario, the event involves the seeding of Earth 
with extraterrestrial homochiral organisms or compounds. Pro￾ponents of this theory point to the presence of a large number 
of amino acids, including some that are enriched in one enantio￾mer, in a meteorite that fell in Murchison, Australia, in 1969.
In terms of forces, circularly polarized ultraviolet light—a 
type of radiation associated with neutron stars—is the most 
favored candidate (Figure 4.5). Numerous experiments in which 
racemic mixtures of chiral substances were irradiated with circu￾larly polarized light resulted in enrichment of one enantiomer 
because of preferential destruction of the other.
Research directed toward finding symmetry-breaking 
mechanisms for homochiral generation is as fundamental as sci￾ence can be, but standing in the way of even a modest degree 
of progress is the time window through which one is obliged to 
look. Most theories rely on a principle that once generated in a 
population, homochirality will be amplified by natural selection 
to the point that competing stereoisomers vanish.
Figure 4.5
A neutron star lies at the center of the Crab Nebula. Radiation 
from a neutron star has been proposed as the polarized light 
source that served as a “symmetry breaker” in theories 
concerning the origin of homochirality.
NASA4.7 Fischer Projections 149
4.7 Fischer Projections
Stereochemistry deals with the three-dimensional arrangement of a molecule’s atoms, 
and we have attempted to show stereochemistry with wedge-and-dash drawings and 
computer-generated models. It is possible, however, to convey stereochemical information 
in an abbreviated form using a method devised by the German chemist Emil Fischer.
Let’s return to bromochlorofluoromethane as a simple example of a chiral molecule. 
The two enantiomers of BrClFCH are shown as ball-and-stick models, as wedge-and￾dash drawings, and as Fischer projections in Figure 4.6. Fischer projections are always 
generated the same way: the molecule is oriented so that the vertical bonds at the chirality 
center are directed away from you and the horizontal bonds point toward you. A projec￾tion of the bonds onto the page is a cross. The chirality center lies at the center of the 
cross but is not explicitly shown.
It is customary to orient the molecule so that the carbon chain is vertical with the 
lowest numbered carbon at the top as shown for the Fischer projection of (R)-2-butanol.

outdated for most purposes, is still widely used for carbohydrates and amino acids. Likewise, 
Fischer projections find their major application in these same two families of compounds.
4.8 Properties of Enantiomers
The usual physical properties such as density, melting point, and boiling point are identi￾cal for both enantiomers of a chiral compound.
Enantiomers can have striking differences, however, in properties that depend on 
the arrangement of atoms in space. Take, for example, the enantiomeric forms of carvone. 
(R)-(−)-Carvone is the principal component of spearmint oil. Its enantiomer, (S)-(+)-
carvone, is the principal component of caraway seed oil. The two enantiomers do not 
smell the same; each has its own characteristic odor.

The difference in odor between (R)- and (S)-carvone results from their different 
behavior toward receptor sites in the nose. It is believed that volatile molecules occupy 
only those odor receptors that have the proper shape to accommodate them. Because the 
receptor sites are themselves chiral, one enantiomer may fit one kind of receptor while 
the other enantiomer fits a different kind. An analogy that can be drawn is to hands and 
gloves. Your left hand and your right hand are enantiomers. You can place your left hand 
into a left glove but not into a right one. The receptor (the glove) can accommodate one 
enantiomer of a chiral object (your hand) but not the other.
The term chiral recognition refers to a process in which some chiral receptor or 
reagent interacts selectively with one of the enantiomers of a chiral molecule. Very high 
levels of chiral recognition are common in biological processes. (−)-Nicotine, for exam￾ple, is much more toxic than (+)-nicotine, and (+)-adrenaline is more active than 
(−)-adrenaline in constricting blood vessels. (−)-Thyroxine, an amino acid of the thyroid 
gland that speeds up metabolism, is one of the most widely used of all prescription 
drugs—about 10 million people in the United States take (−)-thyroxine on a daily basis. 
Its enantiomer, (+)-thyroxine, has none of the metabolism-regulating effects, but was 
formerly given to heart patients to lower their cholesterol levels.152 Chapter 4 Chirality

Chiral Drugs
Arecent estimate places the number of prescription and over￾the-counter drugs marketed throughout the world at more 
than 2000. Approximately one-third of these are either naturally 
occurring substances themselves or are prepared by chemical 
modification of natural products. Most of the drugs derived from 
natural sources are chiral and are almost always obtained as a 
single enantiomer rather than as a racemic mixture. Not so with 
the over 500 chiral substances represented among the more 
than 1300 drugs that are the products of synthetic organic chem￾istry. Until recently, such substances were, with few exceptions, 
prepared, sold, and administered as racemic mixtures even 
though the desired therapeutic activity resided in only one of the 
enantiomers. Spurred by a number of factors ranging from safety 
and efficacy to synthetic methodology and economics, this prac￾tice is undergoing rapid change as more and more chiral syn￾thetic drugs become available in enantiomerically pure form.
Because of the high degree of chiral recognition inherent in 
most biological processes (Section 4.8), it is unlikely that both enan￾tiomers of a chiral drug will exhibit the same level, or even the same 
kind, of effect. At one extreme, one enantiomer has the desired 
effect, and the other exhibits no biological activity at all. In this case, 
which is relatively rare, the racemic form is simply a drug that is 50% 
pure and contains 50% “inert ingredients.” Real cases are more 
complicated. For example, the S enantiomer is responsible for the 
pain-relieving properties of ibuprofen, normally sold as a racemic 
mixture. The 50% of racemic ibuprofen that is the R enantiomer is 
not completely wasted, however, because enzyme-catalyzed 
reactions in our body convert much of it to active (S)-ibuprofen.

A much more serious drawback to using chiral drugs as 
racemic mixtures is illustrated by thalidomide, briefly employed 
as a sedative and antinausea drug in Europe during the period 
1959–1962. The desired properties are those of (R)-thalidomide. 
(S)-Thalidomide, however, has a very different spectrum of bio￾logical activity and was shown to be responsible for over 2000 
cases of serious birth defects in children born to women who 
took it while pregnant.

Basic research aimed at controlling the stereochemistry 
of chemical reactions has led to novel methods for the synthesis 
of chiral molecules in enantiomerically pure form. Aspects of this 
work were recognized with the award of the 2001 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry to William S. Knowles (Monsanto), Ryoji Noyori 
(Nagoya University), and K. Barry Sharpless (The Scripps 
Research Institute). Most major pharmaceutical companies are 
examining their existing drugs to see which are the best candi￾dates for synthesis as single enantiomers and, when preparing 
a new drug, design its synthesis so as to provide only the desired 
enantiomer. One incentive to developing enantiomerically pure 
versions of existing drugs, called a “chiral switch,” is that the 
novel production methods they require may make them eligible 
for extended patent protection.

many stereoisomers are possible?

We can use straightforward reasoning to come up with the answer. The absolute configu￾ration at C-2 may be R or S. Likewise, C-3 may have either the R or the S configuration. 
The four possible combinations of these two chirality centers are
(2R,3R) (stereoisomer I)
(2R,3S) (stereoisomer III)
(2S,3S) (stereoisomer II)
(2S,3R) (stereoisomer IV)
Figure 4.7 presents structural formulas for these four stereoisomers. Stereoisomers I and 
II are enantiomers of each other; the enantiomer of (R,R) is (S,S). Likewise stereoisomers 
III and IV are enantiomers of each other, the enantiomer of (R,S) being (S,R).
Stereoisomer I is not a mirror image of III or IV, so it is not an enantiomer of either 
one. Stereoisomers that are not related as an object and its mirror image are called diastereo￾mers; diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. Thus, stereoisomer I is a 
diastereomer of III and a diastereomer of IV. Similarly, II is a diastereomer of III and IV.
To convert a molecule with two chirality centers to its enantiomer, the configuration 
at both centers must be changed. Reversing the configuration at only one chirality center 
converts it to a diastereomer.
Enantiomers must have equal and opposite specific rotations. Diastereomers can have 
different rotations, with respect to both sign and magnitude. Thus, as Figure 4.7 shows, 
(2R,3R) : [ ]D−9.5°

the (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) enantiomers (I and II) have specific rotations that are equal in 
magnitude but opposite in sign. The (2R,3S) and (2S,3R) enantiomers (III and IV) likewise 
have specific rotations that are equal to each other but opposite in sign. The magnitudes 
of rotation of I and II are different, however, from those of their diastereomers III and IV.
In writing Fischer projections of molecules with two chirality centers, the mol￾ecule is arranged in an eclipsed conformation for projection onto the page, as shown 
in Figure 4.8. Again, horizontal lines in the projection represent bonds coming toward 
you; vertical lines represent bonds pointing away.
When the carbon chain is vertical and like substituents are on the same side of the 
Fischer projection, the molecule is described as the erythro diastereomer. When like 
substituents are on opposite sides of the Fischer projection, the molecule is described as 
the threo diastereomer. Thus, as seen in the Fischer projections of the stereoisomeric 
2,3-dihydroxybutanoic acids, compounds I and II are erythro stereoisomers and III and 
IV are threo.

Because diastereomers are not mirror images of each other, they can have quite

The situation is the same when the two chirality centers are present in a ring. There

4.10 Achiral Molecules with Two Chirality Centers
Now think about a molecule, such as 2,3-butanediol, which has two chirality centers that 
are equivalently substituted.
OH
OH
2,3-Butanediol
Only three, not four, stereoisomeric 2,3-butanediols are possible. These three are shown 
in Figure 4.9. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) forms are enantiomers and have equal and opposite 
optical rotations. A third combination of chirality centers, (2R,3S), however, gives an 
achiral structure that is superimposable on its (2S,3R) mirror image. Because it is achiral, 
this third stereoisomer is optically inactive. We call achiral molecules that have chirality 
centers meso forms. The meso form in Figure 4.9 is known as meso-2,3-butanediol.
One way to demonstrate that meso-2,3-butanediol is achiral is to recognize that its 
eclipsed conformation has a plane of symmetry that passes through and is perpendicular 
to the C-2—C-3 bond, as illustrated in Figure 4.10a. The anti conformation is achiral as 
well. As Figure 4.10b shows, this conformation is characterized by a center of symmetry 
at the midpoint of the C-2—C-3 bond.156 Chapter 4 Chirality
Fischer projections can help us identify meso forms. Of the three stereoisomeric 
2,3-butanediols, notice that only in the meso stereoisomer does a dashed line through 
the center of the Fischer projection divide the molecule into two mirror-image halves.

When using Fischer projections for this purpose, however, be sure to remember 
what three-dimensional objects they stand for. One should not, for example, test for 
superimposition of the two chiral stereoisomers by a procedure that involves moving any 
part of a Fischer projection out of the plane of the paper in any step.

Chirality of Disubstituted Cyclohexanes
Disubstituted cyclohexanes present us with a challenging 
exercise in stereochemistry. Consider the seven possible 
dichlorocyclohexanes: 1,1-; cis- and trans-1,2-; cis- and trans-1,3-; 
and cis- and trans-1,4-. Which are chiral? Which are achiral?

Structures A and A′ are nonsuperimposable mirror images of 
each other. Thus, although cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane is chiral, 
it is optically inactive when chair–chair interconversion occurs. 
Such interconversion is rapid at room temperature and converts 
optically active A to a racemic mixture of A and A′. Because A 
and A′ are enantiomers interconvertible by a conformational 
change, they are sometimes referred to as conformational 
enantiomers.
The same kind of spontaneous racemization occurs for 
any cis-1,2 disubstituted cyclohexane in which both substituents 
are the same. Because such compounds are chiral, it is incorrect 
to speak of them as meso compounds, which are achiral mole￾cules that have chirality centers. Rapid chair–chair interconver￾sion, however, converts them to a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers, 
and this mixture is optically inactive.158 Chapter 4 Chirality
4.11 Molecules with Multiple Chirality Centers
Many naturally occurring compounds contain several chirality centers. By an analysis 
similar to that described for the case of two chirality centers, it can be shown that the 
maximum number of stereoisomers for a particular constitution is 2n
, where n is equal 
to the number of chirality centers.
Problem 4.19
Using R and S descriptors, write all the possible combinations for a molecule with three 
chirality centers.
When two or more of a molecule’s chirality centers are equivalently substituted, meso 
forms are possible, and the number of stereoisomers is then less than 2n
. Thus, 2n
 represents 
the maximum number of stereoisomers for a molecule containing n chirality centers.
The best examples of substances with multiple chirality centers are the carbohy￾drates. One class of carbohydrates, called aldohexoses, has the constitution:

Because there are four chirality centers and no possibility of meso forms, there are

natural products or as the products of chemical synthesis.

Steroids are another class of natural products with multiple chirality centers. One

given in Figure 4.11. Cholic acid has 11 chirality centers, and so a total (including cholic 
acid) of 211, or 2048, stereoisomers have this constitution. Of these 2048 stereoisomers,

how many are diastereomers of cholic acid? Remember! Diastereomers are stereoisomers 
that are not enantiomers, and any object can have only one mirror image. Therefore, of 
the 2048 stereoisomers, one is cholic acid, one is its enantiomer, and the other 2046 are 
diastereomers of cholic acid. Only a small fraction of these compounds are known, and 
(+)-cholic acid is the only one ever isolated from natural sources!
Eleven chirality centers may seem like a lot, but it is nowhere close to a world 
record. It is a modest number when compared with the more than 100 chirality centers 
typical for most small proteins and the billions of chirality centers present in human DNA.
4.12 Resolution of Enantiomers
The separation of a racemic mixture into its enantiomeric components is termed resolution.
The first resolution, that of tartaric acid, was carried out by Louis Pasteur in 1848. Tartaric 
acid is a byproduct of wine making and is almost always found as its dextrorotatory 
2R,3R stereoisomer, shown here in a perspective drawing and in a Fischer projection.

Problem 4.21
There are two other stereoisomeric tartaric acids. Write their Fischer projections, and specify 
the configuration at their chirality centers.
Occasionally, an optically inactive sample of tartaric acid was obtained. Pasteur 
noticed that the sodium ammonium salt of optically inactive tartaric acid was a mixture 
of two mirror-image crystal forms. With microscope and tweezers, Pasteur carefully 
separated the two and found that one kind of crystal (in aqueous solution) was dextro￾rotatory, whereas the mirror-image crystals rotated the plane of polarized light an equal 
amount but were levorotatory.
Although Pasteur was unable to provide a structural explanation—that had to wait 
for van’t Hoff and Le Bel a quarter of a century later—he correctly deduced that the 
enantiomeric quality of the crystals was the result of enantiomeric molecules. The rare 
form of tartaric acid was optically inactive because it contained equal amounts of (+)-tartaric 
acid and (−)-tartaric acid. It had earlier been called racemic acid (from Latin racemus,
meaning “a bunch of grapes”), a name that subsequently gave rise to our present term for 
an equal mixture of enantiomers.
Problem 4.22
Could the unusual, optically inactive form of tartaric acid studied by Pasteur have been 
meso-tartaric acid?
Pasteur’s technique of separating enantiomers not only is laborious but requires that 
the crystals of the enantiomers be distinguishable. This happens very rarely. Conse￾quently, alternative and more general approaches for resolving enantiomers have been 
developed. Most are based on a strategy of temporarily converting the enantiomers of a 
racemic mixture to diastereomeric derivatives, separating these diastereomers, then 
regenerating the enantiomeric starting materials.
Figure 4.12 illustrates this strategy. Say we have a mixture of enantiomers, which, 
for simplicity, we label as C(+) and C(−). Assume that C(+) and C(−) bear some func￾tional group that can combine with a reagent P to yield adducts C(+)-P and C(−)-P. 
Now, if reagent P is chiral, and if only a single enantiomer of P, say, P(+), is added to 
a racemic mixture of C(+) and C(−), as shown in the first step of Figure 4.12, then the 160 Chapter 4 Chirality
products of the reaction are C(+)-P(+) and C(−)-P(+). These products are not mirror 
images; they are diastereomers. Diastereomers can have different physical properties, 
which can serve as a means of separating them. The mixture of diastereomers is sepa￾rated, usually by recrystallization from a suitable solvent. In the last step, an appropriate 
chemical transformation liberates the enantiomers and restores the resolving agent.
Whenever possible, the chemical reactions involved in the formation of diastereo￾mers and their conversion to separate enantiomers are simple acid–base reactions. For 
example, naturally occurring (S)-(−)-malic acid is often used to resolve amines such as 
1-phenylethylamine. Amines are bases, and malic acid is an acid. Proton transfer from 
(S)-(−)-malic acid to a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethylamine gives a mix￾ture of diastereomeric salts.

The general procedure for resolving a chiral substance into its enantiomers. Reaction with a single enantiomer of a chiral resolving agent P(+) converts the 
racemic mixture of enantiomers C(+) and C(−) to a mixture of diastereomers C(+)-P(+) and C(−)-P(+). The mixture of diastereomers is separated—by fractional 
crystallization, for example. A chemical reaction is then carried out to convert diastereomer C(+)-P(+) to C(+) and the resolving agent P(+). Likewise, 
diastereomer C(−)-P(+) is converted to C(−) and P(+). C(+) has been separated from C(−), and the resolving agent P(+) can be recovered for further use.
Most resolving agents are isolated 
as single enantiomers from natural 
sources. S-(−)-Malic acid is obtained 
from apples.

Problem 4.23
In the resolution of 1-phenylethylamine using (S)-(−)-malic acid, the compound obtained by 
recrystallization of the mixture of diastereomeric salts is (R)-1-phenylethylammonium (S)-malate. 
The other component of the mixture is more soluble and remains in solution. What is the 
configuration of the more soluble salt?
This method is widely used for the resolution of chiral amines and carboxylic acids. 
Analogous methods based on the formation and separation of diastereomers have been 
developed for other functional groups; the precise approach depends on the kind of 
chemical reactivity associated with the functional groups present in the molecule.
As the experimental tools for biochemical transformations have become more pow￾erful and procedures for carrying out these transformations in the laboratory more rou￾tine, the application of biochemical processes to mainstream organic chemical tasks 
including the production of enantiomerically pure chiral molecules has grown.
Another approach, called kinetic resolution, depends on the different rates of reac￾tion of two enantiomers with a chiral reagent. A very effective form of kinetic resolution 
uses enzymes as chiral biocatalysts to selectively bring about the reaction of one enan￾tiomer of a racemic mixture (enzymatic resolution). Lipases, or esterases—enzymes 
that catalyze ester hydrolysis and formation—have been successfully used in many kinetic 
resolutions. In a representative procedure, one enantiomer of an ester undergoes hydrolysis 
and the other is left unchanged.

4.13 The Chirality Axis
We have, so far, restricted our discussion of chiral molecules to those that contain one 
or more chirality centers. Although these are the most common, they are not the only 
kinds of chiral molecules. A second group consists of molecules that contain a chirality 
axis—an axis about which a set of atoms or groups is arranged so that the spatial 
arrangement is not superimposable on its mirror image. We can think of two enantio￾mers characterized by a chirality axis as being analogous to a left-handed screw and a 
right-handed screw.162 Chapter 4 Chirality
Among molecules with a chirality axis, substituted derivatives of biaryls have 
received much attention. Biaryls are compounds in which two aromatic rings are joined 
by a single bond: biphenyl and 1,1′-binaphthyl, for example.
Biphenyl 1,1′-Binaphthyl
Although their individual rings are flat, the molecules themselves are not. Rotation 
about the single bond connecting the two rings in biphenyl reduces the steric strain 
between nearby hydrogens of one ring (red) and those of the other (green). This rotation 
makes the “twisted” conformation more stable than one in which all of the atoms lie in 
the same plane.

Rotation about the bond joining the two rings is very fast in biphenyl, about the

rings bear groups other than hydrogen.

If the substituents are large enough, the steric strain that accompanies their moving 
past each other during rotation about the single bond can decrease the rate of equilibration 
so much that it becomes possible to isolate the two conformations under normal labora￾tory conditions.
When A ≠ B, and X ≠ Y, the two conformations are nonsuperimposable mirror 
images of each other; that is, they are enantiomers. The bond connecting the two rings 
lies along a chirality axis.

Structures such as chiral biaryls, which are related by rotation about a single bond 
yet are capable of independent existence, are sometimes called atropisomers, from the 
Greek a meaning “not” and tropos meaning “turn.” They represent a subcategory of 
conformers.
Derivatives of 1,1′-binaphthyl exhibit atropisomerism, due to hindered rotation 
about the single bond that connects the two naphthalene rings. A commercially important 
application of chiral binaphthyls is based on a substituted derivative known as BINAP, 
a component of a hydrogenation catalyst. In this catalyst, ruthenium is bound by the two 
phosphorus atoms present on the groups attached to the naphthalene rings.

We will explore the use of the ruthenium BINAP catalysts in the synthesis of chiral 
drugs in Section 15.13.
4.14 Chirality Centers Other Than Carbon
Atoms other than carbon may also be chirality centers. Silicon, like carbon, has a tetra￾hedral arrangement of bonds when it bears four substituents. Unlike carbon, there are no 
naturally occurring chiral organosilicon compounds to provide a ready source for stereo￾chemical studies. Beginning in the 1960s, however, Leo H. Sommer and his students at 
Penn State began a systematic study of organosilicon reaction mechanisms made possible 
by their successful resolution of the enantiomers of 1-naphthylphenylmethylsilane.

Trigonal pyramidal molecules are chiral if the central atom bears three different 
groups. If one is to resolve substances of this type, however, the pyramidal inversion that 
BINAP is an abbreviation for 
2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-
binaphthyl.
Chemists don’t agree on the minimum 
energy barrier for bond rotation that 
allows isolation of enantiomeric 
atropisomers at room temperature, 
but it is on the order of 100 kJ/mol 
(24 kcal/mol). Recall that the activation 
energy for rotation about CC single 
bonds in alkanes is about 12 kJ/mol 
(3 kcal/mol).164 Chapter 4 Chirality

Phosphorus is in the same group of the periodic table as nitrogen, and tricoordinate

optically active phosphines have been prepared.

Tricoordinate sulfur compounds are pyramidal and chiral when sulfur bears three 
different groups. The most common examples are sulfoxides. Alliin, which occurs natu￾rally in garlic, has two chirality centers; the one at carbon has the R configuration; the 
one at sulfur is S. Omeprazole, which is a racemic mixture, is widely used for treatment 
of acid reflux and has been joined in the marketplace by an enantiopure S version, which 
is appropriately named Esomeprazole.

Stereochemistry is chemistry in three dimensions. At its most fundamental level, its concern is 
molecular structure; at another level, it is chemical reactivity. Table 4.2 summarizes some of its 
basic definitions.
Section 4.1 A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.

4.15 SUMMARY4.15 Summary 165
Section 4.2 The most common kind of chiral molecule contains a carbon atom that bears 
four different atoms or groups. Such an atom is called a chirality center.
Table 4.2 shows the enantiomers of 2-chlorobutane. C-2 is a chirality center in 
2-chlorobutane.
Section 4.3 A molecule that has a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry is achiral. 
cis-4-Methylcyclohexanol (Table 4.2) has a plane of symmetry that bisects the 
molecule into two mirror-image halves and is achiral. The same can be said for 
trans-4-methylcyclohexanol.
Definition Example
Isomers are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. They may be either constitutional isomers or stereoisomers.
1. Constitutional isomers are isomers that differ in the order in 
which their atoms are connected.
Three constitutionally isomeric compounds have the molecular 
formula C3H8O:
OH
O
OH
1-Propanol 2-Propanol Ethyl methyl ether
2. Stereoisomers are isomers that have the same constitution 
but differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space.
(a) Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are related as an 
object and its nonsuperimposable mirror image.
The two enantiomeric forms of 2-chlorobutane are
Cl Cl
(R)-(−)-2-Chlorobutane (S)-(+)-2-Chlorobutane
and
(b) Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror 
images.
The cis and trans isomers of 4-methylcyclohexanol are stereoiso￾mers, but they are not related as an object and its mirror image; 
they are diastereomers.

TABLE 4.2 Classification of Isomers
Section 4.4 Optical activity, or the degree to which a substance rotates the plane of 
polarized light, is a physical property used to characterize chiral substances. 
Enantiomers have equal and opposite optical rotations. To be optically active a 
substance must be chiral, and one enantiomer must be present in excess of the 
other. A racemic mixture is optically inactive and contains equal quantities of 
enantiomers. When enantiomers are present in unequal amounts, enantiomeric 
excess or enantiomeric ratio is used to specify the purity of the enantiomeric 
mixtures. Enantiomeric excess corresponds to optical purity.
Section 4.5 Relative configuration compares the arrangement of atoms in space to some 
reference. The prefix cis in cis-4-methylcyclohexanol, for example, describes 
relative configuration by referencing the orientation of the CH3 group to the 
OH. Absolute configuration is an exact description of the arrangement of 
atoms in space.
Section 4.6 Absolute configuration in chiral molecules is best specified using the prefixes 
R and S of the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog notational system. Substituents at a chirality 
center are ranked in order of decreasing precedence. If the three highest ranked 
substituents trace a clockwise path (highest → second highest → third highest) 
when the lowest ranked substituent is held away from you, the configuration is 
R. If the path is counterclockwise, the configuration is S. Table 4.2 shows the 
R and S enantiomers of 2-chlorobutane.166 Chapter 4 Chirality
Section 4.7 A Fischer projection shows how a molecule would look if its bonds were 
projected onto a flat surface. Horizontal lines represent bonds pointing toward 
you; vertical lines represent bonds pointing away from you. The projection is 
normally drawn so that the carbon chain is vertical, with the lowest numbered 
carbon at the top.

Section 4.8 Both enantiomers of the same substance are identical in most of their physical 
properties. The most prominent differences are biological ones, such as taste 
and odor, in which the substance interacts with a chiral receptor site. Enantiomers 
also have important consequences in medicine, in which the two enantiomeric 
forms of a drug can have much different effects on a patient.
Section 4.9 When a molecule has two chirality centers and these two chirality centers are 
not equivalent, four stereoisomers are possible.

Stereoisomers that are not mirror images are classified as diastereomers. Each 
enantiomer of erythro-3-bromo-2-butanol is a diastereomer of each enantiomer 
of threo-3-bromo-2-butanol.
Section 4.10 Achiral molecules that contain chirality centers are called meso forms. Meso 
forms typically contain (but are not limited to) two equivalently substituted 
chirality centers. They are optically inactive.

Section 4.11 For a particular constitution, the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2n
, 
where n is the number of chirality centers. The number of stereoisomers is 
reduced to less than 2n
 when there are meso forms.
Section 4.12 Resolution is the separation of a racemic mixture into its enantiomers. It is 
normally carried out by converting the mixture of enantiomers to a mixture of 
diastereomers, separating the diastereomers, then regenerating the enantiomers.
Section 4.13 Molecules without chirality centers can be chiral. Biphenyls that are substituted 
can exhibit an axis of chirality. When A ≠ B, and X ≠ Y, the two conformations 
are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other; that is, they are enantiomers. 
The bond connecting the two rings lies along a chirality axis.

B Y
X

Section 4.14 Atoms other than carbon can be chirality centers. Examples include those based 
on tetracoordinate silicon and tricoordinate sulfur or phosphorus as the chirality 
center. In principle, tricoordinate nitrogen can be a chirality center in compounds 
of the type N(x,y,z), where x, y, and z are different, but inversion of the nitrogen 
pyramid is so fast that racemization occurs virtually instantly at room temperature.Problems 167

Enantiotopic groups are designated as pro-R or pro-S by a modification of Cahn–Ingold–
Prelog notation. One is assigned a higher priority than the other without disturbing the priorities 
of the remaining groups, and the R,S configuration of the resulting chirality center is determined 
in the usual way. If it is R, the group assigned the higher rank is pro-R. If S, this group is pro-S.

Citric acid played a major role in the development of the concept of prochirality. Its two 
CH2CO2H chains groups behave differently in a key step of the Krebs cycle, so differently that 
some wondered whether citric acid itself were really involved. Alexander Ogston (Oxford) provided 
the answer in 1948 by pointing out that the two CH2CO2H groups are differentiated when citric 
acid interacts with the chiral environment of an enzyme.
The two prochiral faces of a trigonal atom C(x,y,z) are enantiotopic and designated Re and 
Si according to whether x, y, and z trace a clockwise (Re) or counterclockwise (Si) path in order 
of decreasing Cahn–Ingold–Prelog precedence. An acetaldehyde molecule that lies in the plane of

Alcohols and Alkyl Halides: 
Introduction to Reaction 
Mechanisms
Our first four chapters established some fundamental principles 
concerning the structure of organic molecules and introduced 
the connection between structure and reactivity with a review 
of acid–base reactions in Sections 1.12–1.15. In the present 
chapter, we’ll explore the relation between structure and reac￾tivity in more detail by developing two concepts: functional 
groups and reaction mechanisms. A functional group is the 
atom or group in a molecule most responsible for the reaction 
the compound undergoes under a prescribed set of conditions. 
How the structure of the reactant is transformed to that of the 
product is what we mean by the reaction mechanism.
Organic compounds are grouped into families according to 
the functional groups they contain. Two of the most important 
families are alcohols and alkyl halides; both of which are versa￾tile starting materials for preparing numerous other families and 
will appear in virtually all of the remaining chapters of this text.
The major portion of the present chapter concerns the 
conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides by reaction with hydro￾gen halides:

As a motion picture tells a story, so too a mechanism tells us how a chemical 
reaction takes place. If we could look at a reaction “frame-by-frame,” as we 
can with a film reel, we would observe intermediates and transition states 
that appear during it.

CH35.1 Functional Groups 175
It is convenient in equations such as this to represent generic alcohols and alkyl halides 
as ROH and RX, respectively, where “R” stands for an alkyl group. In addition to 
convenience, this notation lets us focus more clearly on the functional-group transforma￾tion; the OH functional group of an alcohol is replaced by a halogen, such as chlorine 
(X = Cl) or bromine (X = Br).
While developing the connections between structure, reaction, and mechanism, we 
will also extend the fundamentals of IUPAC nomenclature to functional-group families, 
beginning with alcohols and alkyl halides.
5.1 Functional Groups
The families of hydrocarbons—alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and arenes—were introduced 
in Section 2.1. The double bond is a functional group in an alkene, the triple bond a 
functional group in an alkyne, and the benzene ring itself is a functional group in an 
arene. Alkanes (RH) are not considered to have a functional group, although as we’ll see 
in later chapters, reactions that replace a hydrogen atom can take place. In general though, 
hydrogen atoms of alkanes are relatively unreactive and any other group attached to the 
hydrocarbon framework will be the functional group.
Table 5.1 lists the major families of organic compounds covered in this text and 
their functional groups.
Problem 5.1
(a) Write a structural formula for a sulfide having the molecular formula C3H8S. 
(b) What two thiols have the molecular formula C3H8S?
Sample Solution (a) According to Table 5.1, sulfides have the general formula RSR and the 
Rs may be the same or different. The only possible connectivity for a sulfide with three 
carbons is CSCC. Therefore, the sulfide is CH3SCH2CH3.
Problem 5.2
A footnote to Table 5.1 states “The example given is a primary amine (RNH2). Secondary
amines have the general structure R2NH; tertiary amines are R3N.” Eight constitutionally 
isomeric amines have the molecular formula C4H11N. Write their structural formulas and 
classify each as a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine as appropriate.
We have already touched on some of these functional-group families in our discussion 
of acids and bases. We have seen that alcohols resemble water in pKa and that carboxylic 
acids, although weak acids, are stronger acids than alcohols. Carboxylic acids belong to one 
of the most important classes of organic compounds—those that contain carbonyl groups 
(CO). They and other carbonyl-containing compounds rank among the most abundant and 
biologically significant naturally occurring substances. In this chapter we focus our attention 
on two classes of organic compounds listed in Table 5.1: alkyl halides and alcohols.
Problem 5.3
Many compounds contain more than one functional group. Elenolic acid is obtained from 
olive oil and contains three carbonyl groups. Classify each type according to Table 5.1. 
Identify the most acidic proton in elenolic acid and use Table 1.8 to estimate its pKa.

5.2 IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkyl Halides
According to the IUPAC rules, alkyl halides may be named in two different ways, 
called functional class nomenclature and substitutive nomenclature. In functional 
class nomenclature the alkyl group and the halide (fluoride, chloride, bromide, or 
iodide) are designated as separate words. The alkyl group is named on the basis 
The IUPAC rules permit certain 
common alkyl group names to be used. 
These include n-propyl, isopropyl, 
n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, 
and neopentyl (Section 2.17).

Substitutive nomenclature of alkyl halides treats the halogen as a halo (fluoro-,

substituent nearer the end of the chain.

Problem 5.4
Write structural formulas and give the functional class and substitutive names of all the 
isomeric alkyl chlorides that have the molecular formula C4H9Cl.
Substitutive names are preferred, but functional class names are sometimes more 
convenient or more familiar and are often encountered in organic chemistry.
5.3 IUPAC Nomenclature of Alcohols
Functional class names of alcohols are derived by naming the alkyl group that bears the 
hydroxyl substituent (OH), then adding alcohol as a separate word. The chain is always 
numbered beginning at the carbon to which the hydroxyl group is attached.
Substitutive names of alcohols are developed by identifying the longest continuous 
chain that bears the hydroxyl group and replacing the -e ending of the corresponding 
alkane by -ol. The position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by number, choosing the 
sequence that assigns the lower locant to the carbon that bears the hydroxyl group.
The 1993 IUPAC recommendations alter the substitutive names of alcohols by 
bracketing the numerical locant for the substituted carbon with hyphens and placing it 
immediately before the -ol ending.

Functional class names are part of the 
IUPAC system; they are not “common 
names.”
Several alcohols are commonplace 
substances, well known by common 
names that reflect their origin (wood 
alcohol, grain alcohol) or use (rubbing 
alcohol). Wood alcohol is methanol
(methyl alcohol, CH3OH), grain alcohol 
is ethanol (ethyl alcohol, CH3CH2OH), 
and rubbing alcohol is 2-propanol
[isopropyl alcohol, (CH3)2CHOH].178 Chapter 5 Alcohols and Alkyl Halides: Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms
Hydroxyl groups take precedence over (“outrank”) alkyl groups and halogens in deter￾mining the direction in which a carbon chain is numbered. The OH group is assumed to 
be attached to C-1 of a cyclic alcohol.

Problem 5.5
Write structural formulas, and give the functional class and substitutive names of all the 
isomeric alcohols that have the molecular formula C4H10O.
5.4 Classes of Alcohols and Alkyl Halides
Alcohols and alkyl halides are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary according to 
the degree of substitution of the carbon that bears the functional group (Section 2.17). 
Thus, primary alcohols and primary alkyl halides are compounds of the type RCH2G 
(where G is the functional group), secondary alcohols and secondary alkyl halides are 
R2CHG, and tertiary alcohols and tertiary alkyl halides are R3CG.

(a primary alcohol)
Problem 5.6
Classify the isomeric C4H10O alcohols as being primary, secondary, or tertiary.
Many of the properties of alcohols and alkyl halides are affected by whether their 
functional groups are attached to primary, secondary, or tertiary carbons. We will see a 
number of cases in which a functional group attached to a primary carbon is more reac￾tive than one attached to a secondary or tertiary carbon, as well as other cases in which 
the reverse is true.
5.5 Bonding in Alcohols and Alkyl Halides
The carbon that bears the functional group is sp3
-hybridized in alcohols and alkyl halides. 
Figure 5.1 illustrates bonding in methanol. The bond angles at carbon are approximately 
tetrahedral, as is the COH angle. A similar orbital hybridization model applies to 
alkyl halides, with the halogen connected to sp3
-hybridized carbon by a σ bond. Carbon–
halogen bond distances in alkyl halides increase in the order CF (140 pm; 1.40 Å) < 
CCl (179 pm; 1.79 Å) < CBr (197 pm; 1.97 Å) < CI (216 pm; 2.16 Å).
Carbon–oxygen and carbon–halogen bonds are polar covalent bonds, and carbon 
bears a partial positive charge in alcohols (δ+COδ−) and in alkyl halides (δ+CXδ−). 5.6 Physical Properties of Alcohols and Alkyl Halides: Intermolecular Forces 179
Alcohols and alkyl halides are polar molecules. The dipole moments of methanol and 
chloromethane are very similar to each other and to water.

Problem 5.7
Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine, yet methyl bromide and methyl chloride have 
very similar dipole moments. Why?
Figure 5.2 maps the electrostatic potential in methanol and chloromethane. Both 
are similar in that the sites of highest negative potential (red) are near the electronegative 
atoms: oxygen and chlorine. The polarization of the bonds to oxygen and chlorine, as 
well as their unshared electron pairs, contribute to the concentration of negative charge 
on these atoms.
Relatively simple notions of attractive forces between opposite charges are suffi￾cient to account for many of the properties of chemical substances. You will find it 
helpful to keep the polarity of carbon–oxygen and carbon–halogen bonds in mind as we 
develop the properties of alcohols and alkyl halides in later sections.
5.6 Physical Properties of Alcohols and 
Alkyl Halides: Intermolecular Forces
Boiling Point. When describing the effect of alkane structure on boiling point in 
Section 2.22, we pointed out that van der Waals attractive forces between neutral 
molecules are of three types.
1. Induced-dipole/induced-dipole forces (dispersion forces; London forces)
2. Dipole/induced-dipole forces
3. Dipole–dipole forces
Induced-dipole/induced-dipole forces are the only intermolecular attractive forces avail￾able to nonpolar molecules such as alkanes and are important in polar molecules as well. 
In addition, polar molecules also engage in dipole–dipole and dipole/induced-dipole

attractions. The dipole–dipole attractive force is easiest to visualize and is illustrated 
in Figure 5.3. Two molecules of a polar substance experience a mutual attraction between 
the positively polarized region of one molecule and the negatively polarized region of 
the other. The dipole/induced-dipole force combines features of both the induced-dipole/
induced-dipole and dipole–dipole attractive forces. A polar region of one molecule alters 
the electron distribution in a nonpolar region of another in a direction that produces an 
attractive force between them.
We can gain a sense of the relative importance of these intermolecular forces by 
considering three compounds similar in size and shape: the alkane propane, the alkyl 
halide fluoroethane, and the alcohol ethanol. Both of the polar compounds, ethanol and 
fluoroethane, have higher boiling points than the nonpolar one, propane. We attribute 
this to a combination of dipole/induced-dipole and dipole–dipole attractive forces that 
are present in the liquid states of ethanol and fluoroethane, but absent in propane.

The most striking difference, however, is that despite the similarity in their dipole 
moments, ethanol has a much higher boiling point than fluoroethane. This suggests that 
the attractive forces in ethanol are unusually strong. They are an example of a special 
type of dipole–dipole attraction called hydrogen bonding and involve, in this case, the 
positively polarized proton of the OH group of one ethanol molecule with the nega￾tively polarized oxygen of another. The oxygen of the OH group of alcohols serves as 
a hydrogen bond acceptor, while the hydrogen attached to the oxygen serves as a hydro￾gen bond donor. Having both hydrogen bond acceptor and donor capability in the same 
molecule creates a strong network among ethanol molecules in the liquid phase.

H δ+ δ−
Figure 5.4 shows the association of two ethanol molecules to form a hydrogen-bonded 
complex. The proton in the hydrogen bond (OH---O) is not shared equally between the 
two oxygens, but is closer to and more strongly bonded to one oxygen than the other. 
Typical hydrogen bond strengths are on the order of 20 kJ/mol (about 5 kcal/mol), 
making them some 15–20 times weaker than most covalent bonds. Extended networks 
of hydrogen bonds are broken when individual ethanol molecules escape from the liquid 
to the vapor phase, but the covalent bonds remain intact.
Among organic compounds, hydrogen bonding involves only OH or NH protons, 
as in:
O O H O H N N H O N N H
The hydrogen must be bonded to a strongly electronegative element in order for the bond 
to be polar enough to support hydrogen bonding. Therefore, CH groups do not par￾ticipate in hydrogen bonds.
Problem 5.8
Write structural formulas for all the isomers of (C3H8O). One of these is a gas at 25°C. Which 
one? Why?
Hydrogen bonds between OH 
groups are stronger than those 
between NH groups, as a 
comparison of the boiling points of 
water (H2O, 100°C) and ammonia 
(NH3, −33°C) demonstrates.

molecules of a polar substance associate

one and the negatively polarized region

More than other dipole–dipole attractions, intermolecular hydrogen bonds are 
strong enough to impose a relatively high degree of structural order on systems in which 
they occur. We’ll see, in Chapters 25 and 26, that the three-dimensional structures 
adopted by proteins and nucleic acids, the organic chemicals of life, are strongly influ￾enced by hydrogen bonds.
Table 5.2 lists the boiling points of some representative alkyl halides and alcohols. 
When comparing the boiling points of related compounds as a function of the alkyl 
group, we find that the boiling point increases with the number of carbon atoms, as it 
does with alkanes.
The importance of hydrogen bonding in alcohols is evident in the last column of 
the table where it can be seen that the boiling points of alcohols are consistently higher 
than the corresponding alkyl fluoride, chloride, or bromide.
Among alkyl halides, the boiling point increases with increasing size of the halo￾gen; alkyl fluorides have the lowest boiling points, alkyl iodides the highest. Induced￾dipole/induced-dipole attractive forces are mainly responsible and are favored when the

electron cloud around an atom is easily distorted. This property of an atom is its 
polarizability and is more pronounced when the electrons are farther from the nucleus 
(iodine) than when they are closer (fluorine). Thus, induced-dipole/induced-dipole attrac￾tions are strongest in alkyl iodides, weakest in alkyl fluorides, and the boiling points of 
alkyl halides reflect this.
The boiling points of the chlorinated derivatives of methane increase with the 
number of chlorine atoms because the induced-dipole/induced-dipole attractive forces 
increase with each replacement of hydrogen by chlorine.

Thus, although the difluoride CH3CHF2 boils at a higher temperature than CH3CH2F, the 
trifluoride CH3CF3 boils at a lower temperature than either of them. Even more striking 
is the observation that the hexafluoride CF3CF3 is the lowest boiling of any of the fluo￾rinated derivatives of ethane. Its boiling point is, in fact, only 11°C higher than that of 
ethane itself. The reason for this has to do with the very low polarizability of fluorine 
and a decrease in induced-dipole/induced-dipole forces that accompanies the incorpora￾tion of fluorine substituents into a molecule. Their weak intermolecular attractive forces 
give fluorinated hydrocarbons certain desirable physical properties such as that found in 
the “no stick” Teflon coating of frying pans. Teflon is a polymer (Sections 10.8 and 27.2) 
made up of long chains of CF2CF2 units.
Solubility in Water. Alkyl halides and alcohols differ markedly from one another in 
their solubility in water. All alkyl halides are insoluble in water, but low-molecular￾weight alcohols (methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and isopropyl) are soluble in all proportions. 
Their ability to participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding not only affects the boil￾ing points of alcohols, but also enhances their water solubility. Hydrogen-bonded net￾works of the type shown in Figure 5.5, in which alcohol and water molecules associate 
with one another, replace the alcohol–alcohol and water–water hydrogen-bonded net￾works present in the pure substances.
Higher alcohols become more “hydrocarbon-like” and less water-soluble. 
1-Octanol, for example, dissolves to the extent of only 1 mL in 2000 mL of water. 
As the alkyl chain gets longer, the hydrophobic effect (Section 2.22) becomes more 
important, to the point that it, more than hydrogen bonding, governs the solubility 
of alcohols.
These boiling points illustrate why we 
should do away with the notion that 
boiling points always increase with 
increasing molecular weight.5.7 Preparation of Alkyl Halides from Alcohols and Hydrogen Halides 183

more dense, than water.

(20°C):
Because alkyl halides are insoluble in water, a mixture of an alkyl halide and water 
separates into two layers. When the alkyl halide is a fluoride or chloride, it is the upper 
layer and water is the lower. The situation is reversed when the alkyl halide is a bromide 
or an iodide. In these cases the alkyl halide is the lower layer. Polyhalogenation increases 
the density. The compounds CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CCl4, for example, are all more dense 
than water.
All liquid alcohols have densities of approximately 0.8 g/mL and are less dense 
than water.
5.7 Preparation of Alkyl Halides from 
Alcohols and Hydrogen Halides
Much of what organic chemists do is directed toward practical goals. Chemists in the 
pharmaceutical industry synthesize new compounds as potential drugs. Agricultural 
chemicals designed to increase crop yields include organic compounds used for weed 
control, insecticides, and fungicides. Among the “building block” molecules used as 
starting materials to prepare new substances, alcohols and alkyl halides are especially 
valuable.
By knowing how to prepare alkyl halides, we can better appreciate the material in 
later chapters, where alkyl halides figure prominently in key functional-group transforma￾tions.  Just as important, the preparation of alkyl halides will serve to introduce some 
fundamental principles of reaction mechanisms. We’ll begin with the preparation of alkyl 
halides from alcohols by reaction with hydrogen halides according to the general equation:
R OH + +

The reaction shown is an example of a substitution. A halogen, usually chlorine or 
bromine, replaces a hydroxyl group on carbon.
The order of reactivity of the hydrogen halides parallels their acidity: HI > HBr > 
HCl > HF. Hydrogen iodide is used infrequently, however, and the reaction of alcohols 
with hydrogen fluoride is not a useful method for the preparation of alkyl fluorides.
Among the various classes of alcohols, tertiary alcohols are the most reactive and 
primary alcohols the least.

The efficiency of a synthetic 
transformation is normally expressed 
as a percent yield, or percentage of 
the theoretical yield. Theoretical yield
is the amount of product that could be 
formed if the reaction proceeded to

products other than those given in the 
equation.5.8 Reaction of Alcohols with Hydrogen Halides: The SN1 Mechanism 185
5.8 Reaction of Alcohols with Hydrogen 
Halides: The SN1 Mechanism
The reaction of an alcohol with a hydrogen halide is a substitution. A halogen, usually 
chlorine or bromine, replaces a hydroxyl group as a substituent on carbon. In addition 
to knowing what the reactants and products of a chemical reaction are, it is useful to 
evaluate the energy relationships between them (thermodynamics) and the pathway by 
which reactants become products (mechanism).
With respect to thermodynamics, we’ve already seen how experimentally deter￾mined heats of combustion provide quantitative information concerning the relative sta￾bility of constitutional isomers (see Section 2.23) and of stereoisomers (see Section 3.11). 
These, along with a variety of other studies, have provided a library of thermochemical 
data from which the enthalpy change for formation of a particular compound from its 
component elements under defined conditions can be calculated. The resulting compila￾tion of standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf
°) values can then be used to calculate the 
enthalpy change ΔH° for a particular reaction such as that between tert-butyl alcohol 
and hydrogen chloride.

Subtracting the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants from those of the 
products gives the standard enthalpy change for the reaction.
ΔH°reaction = (−211 kJ/mol − 286 kJ/mol) − (−359 kJ/mol − 92 kJ/mol) = −46 kJ/mol
(−50.4 kcal/mol − 68.4 kcal/mol) − (−85.8 kcal/mol − 22.0 kcal/mol) = −11 kcal/mol
Energy is transferred to the surroundings, the products are of lower energy than 
the reactants, and the conversion of tert-butyl alcohol to tert-butyl chloride under the 
conditions shown is calculated to be exothermic.
For the corresponding reaction using aqueous hydrochloric acid, the standard enthalpy 
of formation of HCl(aq) is −167 kJ/mol (−39.9 kcal/mol), which makes ΔH°reaction = +29 kJ/mol 
(+6.9 kcal/mol). Although this would seem to indicate that the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol 
with hydrochloric acid might not be suitable as a method for making tert-butyl chloride, we 
need to remember that concentrated hydrochloric acid is 12 M in HCl versus 1 M for the 
standard state used in calculations. The high HCl concentration causes the position of equi￾librium to shift to the side of products and makes the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with 
concentrated hydrochloric acid an effective method for preparing tert-butyl chloride.
In developing a mechanism for any reaction, we combine some basic principles of 
chemical reactivity with experimental observations to deduce the most likely sequence 
of steps. A mechanism can never be proven correct but is our best present assessment 
of how a reaction proceeds. If new experimental data appear that conflict with the pro￾posed mechanism, the mechanism must be modified to accommodate them. In the 
absence of conflicting data, our confidence grows that our proposed mechanism is likely 
to be correct. The generally accepted mechanism for the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol 
with hydrogen chloride is presented as a series of three equations in Mechanism 5.1.

Each equation in Mechanism 5.1 represents a single elementary step, meaning that 
it involves only one transition state. A particular reaction might proceed by way of a single 
elementary step, in which it is described as a concerted reaction, or by a series of elemen￾tary steps as in Mechanism 5.1. To be valid a proposed mechanism must meet a number 
of criteria, one of which is that the sum of the equations for the elementary steps must 
correspond to the equation for the overall reaction. Before we examine each step in detail, 
you should verify that the process in Mechanism 5.1 satisfies this requirement.
Step 1: Proton Transfer
We saw in Chapter 1, especially in Table 1.8, that alcohols resemble water in respect to 
their Brønsted acidity (ability to donate a proton from oxygen). They also resemble water 
in their Brønsted basicity (ability to accept a proton on oxygen). Just as proton transfer 
to a water molecule gives oxonium ion (hydronium ion, H3O+), proton transfer to an 
alcohol gives an alkyloxonium ion (ROH2
+).

Furthermore, a strong acid such as HCl that ionizes completely when dissolved in water, 
also ionizes completely when dissolved in an alcohol. Many important reactions of alco￾hols involve strong acids either as reactants or as catalysts. In all these reactions the first 
step is formation of an alkyloxonium ion by proton transfer from the acid to the alcohol.
The molecularity of an elementary step is given by the number of species that 
undergo a chemical change in that step. Transfer of a proton from hydrogen chloride to 
tert-butyl alcohol is bimolecular because two molecules [HCl and (CH3)3COH] undergo 
chemical change.
The tert-butyloxonium ion formed in step 1 is an intermediate. It was not one of the 
initial reactants, nor is it formed as one of the final products. Rather it is formed in one 
elementary step, consumed in another, and lies on the pathway from reactants to products.
Potential energy diagrams of the kind introduced in Section 3.1 are especially use￾ful when applied to reaction mechanisms. One for proton transfer from hydrogen chloride 
to tert-butyl alcohol is shown in Figure 5.6. The potential energy of the system is plotted 
against the “reaction coordinate,” which is a measure of the degree to which the reacting 
molecules have progressed on their way to products. Several aspects of the diagram are 
worth noting:
■ Because this is an elementary step, it involves a single transition state.
■ Proton transfers from strong acids to water and alcohols rank among the most rapid 
chemical processes and occur almost as fast as the molecules collide with one another. 
Thus, the height of the energy barrier Ea for proton transfer must be quite low.
■ The step is known to be exothermic, so the products are placed lower in energy 
than the reactants.
The concerted nature of proton transfer contributes to its rapid rate. The energy 
cost of breaking the HCl bond is partially offset by the energy released in forming the 
new bond between the transferred proton and the oxygen of the alcohol. Thus, the acti￾vation energy is far less than it would be for a hypothetical two-step process in which 
the HCl bond breaks first, followed by bond formation between H+ and the alcohol.
The species present at the transition state is not a stable structure and cannot be 
isolated or examined directly. Its structure is assumed to be one in which the proton 
being transferred is partially bonded to both chlorine and oxygen simultaneously, although 
not necessarily to the same extent.

Inferring the structure at the transition state on the basis of the reactants and prod￾ucts of the elementary step in which it is involved is a time-honored practice in organic 
chemistry. Speaking specifically of transition states, George S. Hammond suggested that 
if two states are similar in energy, they are similar in structure. This rationale is known 
as Hammond’s postulate. One of its corollaries is that the structure of a transition state 
more closely resembles the immediately preceding or following state to which it is closer 
in energy. In the case of the exothermic proton transfer in Figure 5.6, the transition state 
is closer in energy to the reactants and so resembles them more closely than it does the 
products of this step. We often call this an “early” transition state. The next step of this 
mechanism will provide us with an example of a “late” transition state.
Step 2: Carbocation Formation
In the second elementary step of Mechanism 5.1, the alkyloxonium ion dissociates to a 
molecule of water and a carbocation, an ion that contains a positively charged carbon.

Only one species, tert-butyloxonium ion, undergoes a chemical change in this step. 
Therefore, the step is unimolecular.
Like tert-butyloxonium ion, tert-butyl cation is an intermediate along the reaction 
pathway. It is, however, a relatively unstable species and its formation by dissociation 
of the alkyloxonium ion is endothermic. Step 2 is the slowest step in the mechanism 
and has the highest activation energy. Figure 5.7 shows a potential energy diagram for 
this step.
■ Because this step is endothermic, the products of it are placed higher in energy 
than the reactants.
Hammond made the proposal in 1955 
while at Iowa State University and
later did pioneering work in organic 
photochemistry at CalTech.
One way to name carbocations in the 
IUPAC system is to add the word 
“cation” to the name of the alkyl 
group.

■ The transition state is closer in energy to the carbocation (tert-butyl cation), so, 
according to Hammond’s postulate, its structure more closely resembles the carbo￾cation than it resembles tert-butyloxonium ion. The transition state has considerable 
“carbocation character,” meaning that a significant degree of positive charge has 
developed at carbon, and its hybridization is closer to sp2
 than sp3
.

There is ample evidence from a variety of sources that carbocations are intermedi￾ates in many chemical reactions but are almost always too unstable to isolate. The sim￾plest reason for the instability of carbocations is that the positively charged carbon has 
only six electrons in its valence shell—the octet rule is not satisfied for the positively 
charged carbon.
The properties of tert-butyl cation can be understood by focusing on its structure 
shown in Figure 5.8. With only six valence electrons, which are distributed among three 
coplanar σ bonds, the positively charged carbon is sp2
-hybridized. The unhybridized 2p
orbital that remains on the positively charged carbon contains no electrons.
The positive charge on carbon and the vacant p orbital combine to make carboca￾tions strongly electrophilic (“electron-loving” or “electron-seeking”). Electrophiles are 
Lewis acids (Section 1.15). They are electron-pair acceptors and react with Lewis bases 
(electron-pair donors). Step 3, which follows and completes the mechanism, is a Lewis 
acid/Lewis base reaction. We’ll return to carbocations to describe them in more detail in 
Section 5.9.
Step 3: Reaction of tert-Butyl Cation with Chloride Ion
The Lewis bases that react with electrophiles are called nucleophiles (“nucleus seekers”). 
They have an unshared electron pair that they can use in covalent bond formation. The 
nucleophile in step 3 of Mechanism 5.1 is chloride ion.

Step 3 is bimolecular because two species, the carbocation and chloride ion, react 
together. Figure 5.9 is a potential energy diagram for this step, and Figure 5.10 shows 
the orbitals involved in CCl bond formation.
■ The step is exothermic; it leads from the carbocation intermediate to the stable 
isolated products of the reaction.
■ The activation energy for this step is small, and bond formation between a positive 
ion and a negative ion occurs rapidly.
■ The transition state for this step involves partial bond formation between tert-butyl 
cation and chloride ion.

Having seen how Mechanism 5.1 for the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with hydro￾gen chloride can be supplemented with potential energy diagrams for its three elementary 
steps, we’ll complete the picture by combining these diagrams into one that covers the 
entire process.
The composite diagram (Figure 5.11) has three peaks and two valleys. The peaks 
correspond to transition states, one for each of the three elementary steps. The valleys 
correspond to the reactive intermediates—tert-butyloxonium ion and tert-butyl cation—
species formed in one step and consumed in another. The transition state for formation

of tert-butyl cation from the oxonium ion is the point of highest energy on the dia￾gram, which makes this elementary step the slowest of the three. It is called the 
rate-determining step, and the overall reaction can proceed no faster than the rate of 
this, its slowest step.
Substitution reactions, of which the reaction of alcohols with hydrogen halides is 
but one example, will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6. There, we will make 
extensive use of a notation originally introduced by Sir Christopher Ingold. Ingold pro￾posed the symbol, SN, to stand for substitution nucleophilic, to be followed by the num￾ber 1 or 2 according to whether the rate-determining step is unimolecular or bimolecular. 
The reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with hydrogen chloride, for example, is said to follow 
an SN1 mechanism because its slow step (dissociation of tert-butyloxonium ion) is uni￾molecular. Only the alkyloxonium ion undergoes a chemical change in this step.

5.9 Structure, Bonding, and Stability of Carbocations
As we have just seen, the rate-determining step in the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with 
hydrogen chloride is formation of the carbocation (CH3)3C+. Convincing evidence from 
a variety of sources tells us that carbocations can exist, but are relatively unstable. When 
carbocations are involved in chemical reactions, it is as reactive intermediates, formed 
slowly in one step and consumed rapidly in another.
Numerous other studies have shown that alkyl groups directly attached to the pos￾itively charged carbon stabilize a carbocation. Figure 5.12 illustrates this generalization 
for CH3
+, CH3CH2
+, (CH3)2CH+, and (CH3)3C+. Among this group, CH3
+ is the least 
stable and (CH3)3C+ the most stable.
Carbocations are classified according to the degree of substitution at the posi￾tively charged carbon. The positive charge is on a primary carbon in CH3CH2
+, a second￾ary carbon in (CH3)2CH+, and a tertiary carbon in (CH3)3C+. Ethyl cation is a primary 
carbocation, isopropyl cation a secondary carbocation, and tert-butyl cation a tertiary 
carbocation.
As carbocations go, CH3
+ is particularly unstable, and its existence as an interme￾diate in chemical reactions has never been demonstrated. Most primary carbocations, 
although more stable than CH3
+, are still too unstable to be involved as intermediates in 
chemical reactions. The threshold of stability is reached with secondary carbocations. 
Many reactions, including the reaction of secondary alcohols with hydrogen halides, 
involve secondary carbocations. Similarly, reactions with tertiary alcohols give tertiary 
carbocation intermediates.

Problem 5.12
Carbocations are key intermediates in petroleum refining. Of particular importance is one 
having the carbon skeleton shown.
How many different C8H17
+ carbocations have this carbon skeleton? Write a bond-line formula 
for each and classify the carbocation as primary, secondary, or tertiary. The most stable of 
them corresponds to the intermediate in petroleum refining. Which one is it?
Alkyl groups stabilize carbocations by releasing electron density to the positively 
charged carbon, thereby dispersing the positive charge. Figure 5.13 illustrates this effect 
by comparing the electrostatic potential maps of CH3
+, CH3CH2
+, (CH3)2CH+, and 
(CH3)3C+. The decreased intensity of the blue color reflects the greater dispersal of 
positive charge as the number of methyl groups on the positively charged carbon increases.
Dispersal of positive charge goes hand in hand with delocalization of electrons. 
The redistribution of negative charge—the electrons—is responsible for spreading out 
the positive charge. There are two main ways that methyl and other alkyl groups act as 
electron sources to stabilize carbocations:
■ Inductive effect (by polarization of σ bonds)
■ Hyperconjugation (by delocalization of electrons in σ bonds)

(a) Valence bond: Overlap of the

(b) Molecular orbital: One of the molecular 
orbitals of CH3CH2
+ encompasses 
both the CH3 group and the positively 
charged carbon; it is a bonding MO and 
contains two electrons.
Recall from Section 1.13 that an inductive effect is an electron-donating-or￾withdrawing effect of a substituent that is transmitted by the polarization of σ bonds. As 
illustrated for (CH3)2CH+ in Figure 5.14, the positively charged carbon draws the electrons 
in its σ bonds toward itself and away from the atoms attached to it. Electrons in a CC 
bond are more polarizable than those in a CH bond, so replacing hydrogens by alkyl 
groups reduces the net charge on the positively charged carbon. Alkyl groups are electron￾releasing substituents with respect to their inductive effect. The more alkyl groups that 
are directly attached to the positively charged carbon, the more stable the carbocation.
Problem 5.13
Which would you expect to be more stable: (CH3)3C+ or (CF3)3C+? Why?
Hyperconjugation refers to the delocalization of electrons in a σ bond through a 
system of overlapping orbitals. Its application to carbocations such as CH3CH2
+ can be 
described in terms of valence bond and molecular orbital models.
The valence bond approach to hyperconjugation in CH3CH2
+ is illustrated in 
Figure 5.15a. Overlap of an orbital associated with one of the CH σ bonds of the 
methyl group with the vacant p orbital of the positively charged carbon gives an extended 
orbital that encompasses both and permits the electrons in the σ bond to be shared by 
both carbons. The positive charge is dispersed, and the delocalized electrons feel the 
attractive force of both carbons.
A molecular orbital approach parallels the valence bond model. One of the filled 
bonding MOs of CH3CH2
+ (Figure 5.15b) combines a portion of the 2p orbital of the 
positively charged carbon with orbitals associated with the CH3 group. The pair of elec￾trons in this MO are shared by the CH3 group and by the positively charged carbon.
When applying hyperconjugation to carbocations more complicated than CH3CH2
+, 
it is helpful to keep track of the various bonds. Begin with the positively charged carbon 
and label the three bonds originating from it with the Greek letter α. Proceed along the 
chain, labeling the bonds extending from the next carbon β, those from the next carbon 
γ, and so on.
C C C + γ

γ β

Only electrons in bonds that are β to the positively charged carbon can stabilize a car￾bocation by hyperconjugation. Moreover, it doesn’t matter whether hydrogen or another 
carbon is at the far end of the β bond; stabilization by hyperconjugation will still operate. 
The key point is that electrons in bonds that are β to the positively charged carbon are 
more stabilizing than electrons in an α +CH bond. Thus, successive replacement of 
first one, then two, then three hydrogens of CH3
+ by alkyl groups increases the oppor￾tunities for hyperconjugation, which is consistent with the observed order of carbocation 
stability: CH3
+ < CH3CH2
+ < (CH3)2CH+ < (CH3)3C+.194 Chapter 5 Alcohols and Alkyl Halides: Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms
Problem 5.14
For the general case of R = any alkyl group, how many bonded pairs of electrons are 
involved in stabilizing R3C+ by hyperconjugation? How many in R2CH+? In RCH2
+?
We will see numerous reactions that involve carbocation intermediates as we pro￾ceed through the text, so it is important to understand how their structure determines 
their properties.
5.10 Effect of Alcohol Structure on Reaction Rate
For a proposed reaction mechanism to be valid, the sum of its elementary steps must 
equal the equation for the overall reaction and the mechanism must be consistent with 
all experimental observations. The SN1 process set forth in Mechanism 5.1 satisfies the 
first criterion. What about the second?
One important experimental fact is that the rate of reaction of alcohols with hydro￾gen halides increases in the order primary < secondary < tertiary. This reactivity order 
parallels the carbocation stability order and is readily accommodated by the mechanism 
we have outlined.
The rate-determining step in the SN1 mechanism is dissociation of the alkyloxonium 
ion to the carbocation.

The rate of this step is proportional to the concentration of the alkyloxonium ion:

Rate = k
where k is a constant of proportionality called the rate constant. The value of k is related 
to the activation energy for alkyloxonium ion dissociation and is different for different 
alkyloxonium ions. A low activation energy implies a large value of k and a rapid rate 
of alkyloxonium ion dissociation. Conversely, a large activation energy is characterized 
by a small k for dissociation and a slow rate.
The transition state is closer in energy to the carbocation and, according to 
Hammond’s postulate, more closely resembles it than the alkyloxonium ion. Thus, struc￾tural features that stabilize carbocations stabilize transition states leading to them. It 
follows, therefore, that alkyloxonium ions derived from tertiary alcohols have a lower 
energy of activation for dissociation and are converted to their corresponding carboca￾tions faster than those derived from secondary alcohols. Simply put: more stable carbocations 
are formed faster than less stable ones. Figure 5.16 expresses this principle via potential 
energy diagrams.
The SN1 mechanism is generally accepted to be correct for the reaction of tertiary 
and most secondary alcohols with hydrogen halides. It is almost certainly not correct for 
methyl alcohol and primary alcohols because methyl and primary carbocations are believed 
to be much too unstable, and the activation energies for their formation much too high, 
for them to be reasonably involved. Before describing the mechanism by which methyl 
and primary alcohols are converted to their corresponding halides, we’ll complete our 
discussion of the SN1 mechanism by examining its stereochemical aspects in Section 5.11 
and some novel properties of carbocations in Section 5.12.
The rate of any chemical reaction 
increases with increasing temperature. 
Thus the value of k for a reaction is 
not constant, but increases as the 
temperature increases.5.11 Stereochemistry and the SN1 Mechanism 195
5.11 Stereochemistry and the SN1 Mechanism
When studying reactions that are believed to involve carbocations as intermediates, it is 
common to test this proposal by assessing the stereochemical relationship between the 
organic reactant and its product. Carbocations are trigonal planar and have a plane of 
symmetry, so it might be expected that attack of the halide would occur equally at both 
faces of the intermediate to give a product that is a racemic mixture.

in configuration at the chirality center from 84% S in the alcohol to 70% R in the product 
is an example of a reaction that proceeds with predominant inversion of configuration
at the chirality center. A modified version of the SN1 mechanism is generally accepted 
to account for the observed stereochemistry. According to this model, dissociation of the 
oxonium ion intermediate to a carbocation and water remains the rate-determining step. 
The two of them, however, retain a close spatial orientation that favors approach of 
chloride from the side opposite the original CO bond.

With a water molecule shielding one face of the carbocation, the opposite face is 
more exposed to the medium and chloride bonds preferentially to that face.
Were this the only possibility, configurational inversion would be 100% and is 
sometimes observed. At the other extreme, the rate at which halide bonds to one face of 
the carbocation is the same as the rate at which it bonds to the other and the product is 
an optically inactive racemic mixture.

A carbocation that is not shielded by a water molecule may be expected to give 
equal amounts of the stereoisomeric 4-tert-butyl-1-methylcyclohexyl halides instead of 
the approximately 80:20 ratio observed. The reason for the different yields is not 
because of shielding of the water molecule—instead, structural features of the cyclo￾hexyl cation ring allow for the formation of the more stable cyclohexane product with 
the chlorine axial. Since these two products are related as cis and trans isomers, they 
are diastereomers. Because one diastereomer is formed in higher yield, this is a 
diastereoselective reaction.
Reactions involving carbocation intermediates can sometimes give products having 
a carbon skeleton different from the starting alcohol. When and how this occurs is the 
topic of the next section.5.12 Carbocation Rearrangements 197
5.12 Carbocation Rearrangements
A reaction is said to have proceeded with rearrangement when an atom or group in the 
reactant migrates from the atom to which it is attached and becomes bonded to another.
In the example shown:
OH
Cl
HCl
3,3-Dimethyl-2-butanol 2-Chloro-2,3-
dimethylbutane (83%)
instead of chlorine simply replacing the hydroxyl group at C-2, one of the methyl groups 
at C-3 has moved to C-2 and its original place at C-3 is taken by the incoming chlorine.
The generally accepted explanation for this rearrangement is outlined in Mechanism 
5.2. It extends the SN1 mechanism of Section 5.8 by introducing a new reaction path for 
carbocations. Not only can a carbocation react with a halide ion, it can also rearrange to 
a more stable carbocation prior to capture by the nucleophile.

Similar reactions called Wagner–

ago. The mechanistic explanation is 
credited to Frank Whitmore of Penn 
State who carried out a systematic 
study of rearrangements during the 
1930s.198 Chapter 5 Alcohols and Alkyl Halides: Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms
Why do carbocations rearrange? The answer is straightforward once we recall that 
tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary ones (Section 5.9); rearrangement 
of a secondary to a tertiary carbocation is energetically favorable. As shown in Mecha￾nism 5.2, the carbocation that is formed first in the dehydration of 3,3-dimethyl-2-buta￾nol is secondary; the rearranged carbocation is tertiary. Rearrangement occurs, and the 
alkyl halide comes from the tertiary carbocation.
How do carbocations rearrange? To understand this we need to examine the struc￾tural change that takes place at the transition state. Referring to the initial (secondary) 
carbocation intermediate in Mechanism 5.2, rearrangement occurs when a methyl group 
shifts from C-2 of the carbocation to the positively charged carbon. The methyl group 
migrates with the pair of electrons that made up its original σ bond to C-2. In the curved 
arrow notation for this methyl migration, the arrow shows the movement of both the 
methyl group and the electrons in the σ bond.

At the transition state for rearrangement, the methyl group is partially bonded both 
to its point of origin and to the carbon that will be its destination.
This rearrangement is shown in orbital terms in Figure 5.17. The relevant orbit￾als of the secondary carbocation are shown in structure (a), those of the transition state 
for rearrangement in (b), and those of the tertiary carbocation in (c). Delocalization of 
the electrons of the CCH3 σ bond into the vacant p orbital of the positively charged 
carbon by hyperconjugation is present in both (a) and (c), requires no activation energy, 
and stabilizes each carbocation. Migration of the atoms of the methyl group, however, 
occurs only when sufficient energy is absorbed by (a) to achieve the transition state 
(b). The activation energy is modest, and carbocation rearrangements are normally 
quite fast.
Many carbocation rearrangements involve migration of a hydrogen and are called 
hydride shifts. The same requirements apply to hydride shifts as to alkyl group migra￾tions; they proceed in the direction that leads to a more stable carbocation; the origin 
Step 3: The secondary carbocation formed in step 2 rearranges to a more stable 
tertiary carbocation. One of the methyl groups at C-3 migrates with its 
electron pair to C-2.

Hydrogen Halides: The SN2 Mechanism
Unlike tertiary and secondary carbocations, methyl and primary carbocations are too high 
in energy to be intermediates in chemical reactions. However, methyl and primary alco￾hols are converted, albeit rather slowly, to alkyl halides on treatment with hydrogen 
halides. Therefore, they must follow a different mechanism, one that avoids carbocation

intermediates. This alternative process is outlined in Mechanism 5.3 for the reaction of 
1-heptanol with hydrogen bromide.
The first step of this new mechanism is exactly the same as that seen earlier for 
the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with hydrogen chloride—formation of an alkyloxonium 
ion by proton transfer from the hydrogen halide to the alcohol. Like the earlier example, 
this is a rapid, reversible Brønsted acid–base reaction.
The major difference between the two mechanisms is the second step. The second 
step in the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with hydrogen chloride is the unimolecular dis￾sociation of tert-butyloxonium ion to tert-butyl cation and water. Heptyloxonium ion, 
however, instead of dissociating to an unstable primary carbocation, reacts differently. It 
reacts with bromide ion, which acts as a nucleophile. We can represent the transition 
state of this displacement as:
O
H H
H

δ−

Transition state for step 2

Bromide ion forms a bond to the primary carbon by “pushing off” a water molecule. 
This step is bimolecular because it involves both bromide and heptyloxonium ion. Step 2 
is slower than the proton transfer in step 1, so it is rate-determining. Using Ingold’s ter￾minology, we classify nucleophilic substitutions that have a bimolecular rate-determining 
step by the mechanistic symbol SN2. In the present case, the SN2 mechanism is favored 
because the reaction site, being a primary carbon, is less crowded than that of a second￾ary or tertiary carbon. Further, because primary carbocations are much less stable than 
secondary and tertiary ones, an SN1 mechanism is too slow to compete with SN2.

Problem 5.16
Sketch a potential energy diagram for the reaction of 1-heptanol with hydrogen bromide, 
paying careful attention to the positioning and structures of the intermediates and transition 
states.
It is important to note that although methyl and primary alcohols react with hydro￾gen halides by a mechanism that involves fewer steps than the corresponding reactions 
of secondary and tertiary alcohols, fewer steps do not translate to faster reaction rates. 
Remember, the observed order of reactivity of alcohols with hydrogen halides is tertiary > 
secondary > primary. Reaction rate is governed by the activation energy of the slowest 
step, regardless of how many steps there are.
We described the effect of temperature on reaction rates in Section 3.1 and will 
examine concentration effects beginning in Section 6.3. These and other studies provide 
additional information that can be used to determine reaction mechanisms and a deeper 
understanding of how reactions occur.
5.14 Other Methods for Converting Alcohols 
to Alkyl Halides
Alkyl halides are such useful starting materials for preparing other functional-group types 
that chemists have developed several alternative methods for converting alcohols to them. 
Of these, those based on thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and the phosphorus trihalides PCl3
and PBr3, bear special mention.
Thionyl chloride reacts with alcohols to give alkyl chlorides.

The reaction mechanism differs according to whether the alcohol is primary, sec￾ondary, or tertiary and whether it is carried out in the presence of an amine or not. When 
an amine is present, we can regard it as proceeding in two stages, each of which involves 
more than one elementary step. In the first stage, reaction with thionyl chloride converts 
the alcohol to a chlorosulfite. Pyridine, shown above the arrow in the equation, acts as 202 Chapter 5 Alcohols and Alkyl Halides: Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms

An early step in the mechanism of phosphorus trihalides with alcohols is the for￾mation of a series of intermediates of the type ROPX2, (RO)2PX, (RO)3P, which react 
with the nucleophilic halide ion in subsequent steps. Chiral alcohols are converted to the 
corresponding alkyl halides with predominant inversion of configuration.
5.15 Sulfonates as Alkyl Halide Surrogates
As pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, alkyl halides are commonly used to prepare 
other functional-group families of organic compounds. On exploring the preparation of alkyl 
halides themselves, we emphasized the role of alcohols as their precursors and saw that the 
stereochemical integrity of the alcohol is not always completely maintained in the process. 
Usually an optically active alcohol gives an alkyl halide with net, but incomplete and vary￾ing, inversion of configuration at its chirality center. Moreover, we’ll see in Chapter 6 that 
the customary reaction conditions invite the formation of an alkyl halide mixture contain￾ing isomers having carbon skeletons different from the original alcohol.
Organic chemists have devised alternatives to minimize these shortcomings by 
using alkyl sulfonates instead of alkyl halides. Sulfonates undergo many of the same 
kinds of reactions as alkyl halides but have the advantage that their preparation involves 
the oxygen of the alcohol, not the carbon to which the oxygen is attached.

Thus, both the carbon skeleton and stereochemistry of the original alcohol are

of an alcohol with one of a number of sulfonyl chlorides including the following:

The reactions are normally carried out in the presence of an amine such as trimethyl￾amine or pyridine. The first example demonstrates the maintenance of the carbon skeleton

5.16 SUMMARY
Chemical reactivity and functional-group transformations involving the conversion of alcohols to 
alkyl halides comprise the main themes of this chapter.
Section 5.1 Functional groups are the structural units responsible for the characteristic 
reactions of a molecule. The hydrocarbon chain to which a functional group is 
attached can often be considered as a supporting framework. The most common 
functional groups characterize the families of organic compounds listed on first 
pages of the text.
Section 5.2 Alcohols and alkyl halides may be named using either substitutive or 
functional class IUPAC nomenclature. In substitutive nomenclature alkyl 
halides are named as halogen derivatives of alkanes. The parent is the longest 
continuous chain that bears the halogen substituent, and in the absence of other 
substituents the chain is numbered from the direction that gives the lower 
number to the carbon that bears the halogen. The functional class names of 
alkyl halides begin with the name of the alkyl group and end with the halide as 
a separate word.
Br
Substitutive IUPAC name: 2-Bromohexane
Functional class IUPAC name: 1-Methylpentyl bromide
Section 5.3 The substitutive names of alcohols are derived by replacing the -e ending of an 
alkane with -ol. The longest chain containing the OH group becomes the basis 
for the name. Functional class names of alcohols begin with the name of the 
alkyl group and end in the word alcohol.
OH
Substitutive IUPAC name: 2-Hexanol or hexan-2-ol
Functional class IUPAC name: 1-Methylpentyl alcohol
Section 5.4 Alcohols (X = OH) and alkyl halides (X = F, Cl, Br, or I) are classified as 
primary, secondary, or tertiary according to the degree of substitution at the 
carbon that bears the functional group.

Section 5.9 Carbocations contain a positively charged carbon with only three atoms or 
groups attached to it. This carbon is sp2
-hybridized and has a vacant 2p orbital.
Carbocations are stabilized by alkyl substituents attached directly to the 
positively charged carbon. Alkyl groups are electron-releasing substituents. 
Stability increases in the order
(least stable) CH3
+ < RCH2
+ < R2CH+ < R3C+ (most stable)
Carbocations are strong electrophiles (Lewis acids) and react with nucleophiles
(Lewis bases).
Section 5.10 The rate at which alcohols are converted to alkyl halides depends on the rate of 
carbocation formation: tertiary alcohols are most reactive; primary alcohols do not 
react. A low activation energy gives a large reaction rate.
Section 5.11 The reaction of optically active alcohols with hydrogen halides normally 
proceeds with predominant inversion of configuration accompanied by varying 
degrees of racemization. A reaction that yields one diastereomer over another is 
called a diastereoselective reaction.
Section 5.12 A complicating feature of reactions that involve carbocation intermediates is 
their capacity to undergo rearrangement.
Section 5.13 Primary alcohols and methanol do not react with hydrogen halides by way of 
carbocation intermediates. The nucleophilic species (Br− for example) attacks 
the alkyloxonium ion and displaces a water molecule from carbon in a 
bimolecular step. This step is rate-determining, and the mechanism is SN2.

Nucleophilic Substitution
Nucleophilic substitution was introduced in Chapter 5 with the 
reaction of alcohols with hydrogen halides to form alkyl halides. 
Now we’ll see how alkyl halides themselves can be converted 
by nucleophilic substitution to other classes of organic com￾pounds. Like Chapter 5, the present chapter has a mechanistic 
emphasis designed to achieve a practical result. By understand￾ing the mechanisms by which alkyl halides undergo nucleo￾philic substitution, we can choose experimental conditions best 
suited to carrying out a particular functional-group transforma￾tion. The difference between a successful reaction that leads 
cleanly to a desired product and one that fails is often a subtle 
one. Mechanistic analysis helps us to appreciate these subtleties 
and use them to our advantage.
6.1 Functional-Group Transformation 
by Nucleophilic Substitution
We’ve learned in Sections 5.8–5.13 that the initial intermediate 
in the reaction of alcohols with hydrogen halides is the conju￾gate acid of the alcohol and that, once formed, two mechanistic 
pathways are available to it. In one, called SN2 for substitution 
nucleophilic bimolecular, rate-determining step displacement of 
a water molecule by a halide anion gives an alkyl halide.
This electrostatic potential map is of the transition state for the reaction of 
hydroxide ion with chloromethane. The tetrahedral arrangement of bonds 
inverts during the reaction like an umbrella in a strong wind.

Table 6.1 illustrates an application of each of these to a functional-group transfor￾mation. The anionic portion of the salt substitutes for the halogen of an alkyl halide. The 
metal cation portion becomes a lithium, sodium, or potassium halide.
Notice that all the examples in Table 6.1 involve alkyl halides, that is, compounds in 
which the halogen is attached to an sp3

compounds in which the halogen is attached to sp2

To ensure that reaction occurs in homogeneous solution, solvents are chosen that dissolve 
both the alkyl halide and the ionic salt. Alkyl halides are soluble in organic solvents, but 
the salts often are not. Inorganic salts are soluble in water, but alkyl halides are not. Mixed 
solvents such as ethanol–water mixtures that can dissolve both the alkyl halide and the 
nucleophile are frequently used. Many salts, as well as most alkyl halides, possess significant 
solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which makes 
them good solvents for carrying out nucleophilic substitution reactions (Section 6.9).

With Table 6.1 as background, you can begin to see how useful alkyl halides are in 
synthetic organic chemistry. Their ease of preparation from alcohols makes them readily 
available as starting materials for the preparation of other functionally substituted organic 
compounds. The range of compounds that can be prepared by nucleophilic substitution reac￾tions of alkyl halides is quite large; the examples shown in Table 6.1 illustrate only a few of 
them. Numerous other examples will be added to the list in this and subsequent chapters.
6.2 Relative Reactivity of Halide Leaving Groups
Among alkyl halides, alkyl iodides undergo nucleophilic substitution at the fastest rate, 
alkyl fluorides the slowest.

6.2 Relative Reactivity of Halide Leaving Groups 215216 Chapter 6 Nucleophilic Substitution
Alkyl iodides are several times more reactive than alkyl bromides and from 50 to 100 times 
more reactive than alkyl chlorides. Alkyl fluorides are several thousand times less reactive 
than alkyl chlorides and are rarely used in nucleophilic substitutions. These reactivity differ￾ences can be related to (1) the carbon–halogen bond strength and (2) the basicity of the halide 
anion. Alkyl iodides have the weakest carbon–halogen bond and require the lowest activation 
energy to break; alkyl fluorides have the strongest carbon–halogen bond and require the 
highest activation energy. Regarding basicity of the halide leaving group, iodide is the weak￾est base, fluoride the strongest. It is generally true that the less basic the leaving group, the 
smaller the energy requirement for cleaving its bond to carbon and the faster the rate.
Problem 6.2
1-Bromo-3-chloropropane reacts with one molar equivalent of sodium cyanide in aqueous 
ethanol to give a single organic product. What is this product?
6.3 The SN2 Mechanism of Nucleophilic Substitution
Much of what we know about the mechanisms of nucleophilic substitution is due to 
studies  carried out by Sir Christopher Ingold and Edward D. Hughes at University Col￾lege,  London, in the 1930s using kinetics and stereochemistry as their key experimental 
tools. Indeed, it is these studies of substitution in alkyl halides that are the foundation 
upon which our earlier discussion of the reactions of alcohols with hydrogen halides in 
Chapter 5 rested.
Kinetics. Because the rate of nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl halide—be it methyl, 
primary, secondary, or tertiary—depends on the leaving group (I > Br > Cl > F), the 
carbon–halogen bond must break in the slow (rate-determining) step, and the concentra￾tion of the alkyl halide must appear in the rate law. What about the nucleophile? Hughes 
and Ingold found that many nucleophilic substitutions, such as the hydrolysis of methyl 
bromide in base:
CH3Br + HO CH3OH + Br
Methyl bromide Hydroxide ion Methyl alcohol Bromide ion
obey a second-order rate law, first order in the alkyl halide and first order in the nucleophile.
Rate = k[CH3Br][HO−]
They concluded that the rate-determining step is bimolecular and proposed the substitution 
nucleophilic bimolecular (SN2) mechanism shown as an equation in Mechanism 6.1 and 
as a potential energy diagram in Figure 6.1.
The Hughes–Ingold SN2 mechanism is a one-step concerted process in which both 
the alkyl halide and the nucleophile are involved at the transition state. Cleavage of the 
bond between carbon and the leaving group is assisted by formation of a bond between 
carbon and the nucleophile. Carbon is partially bonded to both the incoming nucleophile 
and the departing halide at the transition state. Progress is made toward the transition 
state as the nucleophile begins to share a pair of its electrons with carbon and the halide 
ion leaves, taking with it the pair of electrons in its bond to carbon.
Problem 6.3
Is the two-step sequence depicted in the following equations consistent with the second￾order kinetic behavior observed for the hydrolysis of methyl bromide?

fast H3C+ + O H H3C O H −Stereochemistry. The diagram for the transition state in Mechanism 6.1 and Figure 6.1 
for the reaction of methyl bromide with hydroxide illustrates a key stereochemical fea￾ture of the SN2 mechanism. The nucleophile attacks carbon from the side opposite the 
bond to the leaving group. Figure 6.2, which maps the electrostatic potential of methyl 
bromide and hydroxide, supports this fact, where the highest negative potential (red) of 
the oxygen atom in hydroxide attacks the positive (blue) carbon of methyl bromide, 
opposite to the bromide.

6.3 The SN2 Mechanism of Nucleophilic Substitution 217218 Chapter 6 Nucleophilic Substitution
Another way of expressing the same point, especially when substitution occurs at 
a chirality center, is that SN2 reactions proceed with inversion of configuration at the 
carbon that bears the leaving group. The tetrahedral arrangement of bonds in the reactant 
is converted to an inverted tetrahedral arrangement in the product.

Problem 6.5
Would you expect the 2-octanol formed by SN2 hydrolysis of (−)-2-bromooctane to be 
optically active? If so, what will be its absolute configuration and sign of rotation? What about 
the 2-octanol formed by hydrolysis of racemic 2-bromooctane?
Countless experiments have confirmed that substitution by the SN2 mechanism is 
stereospecific and suggest that there exists a stereoelectronic requirement for the nucleo￾phile to approach carbon from the side opposite the bond to the leaving group. The results 
of molecular orbital calculations help us understand why.
When a nucleophile such as hydroxide ion reacts with methyl bromide, electrons 
flow from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of HO− to the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CH3Br. Directing our attention to the LUMO 
of CH3Br, we find three main regions where the HOMO of the nucleophile can overlap 
with the LUMO. One of these—the blue region shown at the right—can be ignored

The region between carbon and bromine contains a nodal surface; therefore, no net bond￾ing results from its overlap with the HOMO of HO−. The remaining possibility, which 
is also the one that coincides with experimental observation, is overlap of the HOMO 
of HO− with the LUMO of CH3Br in the region opposite the CBr bond. It involves a 
major region of the LUMO, avoids a node, and gives a CO bond with inversion of 
configuration at carbon.
The SN2 mechanism is believed to describe most substitutions in which simple primary 
and secondary alkyl halides react with negatively charged nucleophiles. All the examples 
that introduced nucleophilic substitution in Table 6.1 proceed by the SN2 mechanism (or a 
mechanism very much like SN2—remember, mechanisms can never be established with 
certainty but represent only our best present explanations of experimental observations).

We saw in Section 6.2 that the rate of nucleophilic substitution depends strongly on 
the leaving group—alkyl iodides are the most reactive, alkyl fluorides the least. In Section 6.4, 
we’ll see that the structure of the alkyl group can have an even larger effect.

6.4 Steric Effects and SN2 Reaction Rates 219220 Chapter 6 Nucleophilic Substitution
The very large rate differences between methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and tert-butyl 
bromides reflect the steric hindrance each offers to nucleophilic attack. The nucleophile 
must approach the alkyl halide from the side opposite the bond to the leaving group, 
and, as illustrated in Figure 6.3, this approach is hindered by alkyl substituents on the 
carbon that is being attacked. The three hydrogens of methyl bromide offer little resis￾tance to approach of the nucleophile, and a rapid reaction occurs. Replacing one of the 
hydrogens by a methyl group somewhat shields the carbon from approach of the nucleo￾phile and causes ethyl bromide to be less reactive than methyl bromide. Replacing all 
three hydrogens by methyl groups almost completely blocks approach to the tertiary 
carbon of (CH3)3CBr and shuts down bimolecular nucleophilic substitution.
In general, SN2 reactions of alkyl halides show the following dependence of rate 
on structure: secondary < primary < methyl. Tertiary alkyl halides do not react by SN2 
mechanisms.
Problem 6.7
Identify the compound in each of the following pairs that reacts with sodium iodide in 
acetone at the faster rate:
(a) 1-Chlorohexane or cyclohexyl chloride
(b) 1-Bromopentane or 3-bromopentane
(c) 2-Chloropentane or 2-fluoropentane
(d) 2-Bromo-2-methylhexane or 2-bromo-5-methylhexane
(e) 2-Bromopropane or 1-bromodecane
Sample Solution (a) Compare the structures of the two chlorides. 1-Chlorohexane is a primary 
alkyl chloride; cyclohexyl chloride is secondary. Primary alkyl halides are less crowded at the 
site of substitution than secondary ones and react faster in substitution by the SN2 mechanism. 
1-Chlorohexane is more reactive.

Alkyl groups at the carbon atom adjacent to the point of nucleophilic attack also 
decrease the rate of the SN2 reaction. Taking ethyl bromide as the standard and succes￾sively replacing its C-2 hydrogens by methyl groups, we see that each additional methyl 
group decreases the rate of displacement of bromide by iodide. When C-2 is completely

Because attack by the nucleophile is the rate-determining step of the SN2 mechanism, 
the rate of substitution varies from nucleophile to nucleophile. Nucleophilic strength, or 
nucleophilicity, is a measure of how fast a Lewis base displaces a leaving group from a 
suitable substrate. Table 6.2 compares the rate at which various Lewis bases react with 
methyl iodide in methanol, relative to methanol as the standard nucleophile.
As long as the nucleophilic atom is the same, the more basic the nucleophile, the 
more reactive it is. An alkoxide ion (RO−) is more basic and more nucleophilic than a 
carboxylate ion (RCO2
−).

The connection between basicity and nucleophilicity holds when comparing atoms 
in the same row of the periodic table. Thus, HO− is more basic and more nucleophilic 
than F−, and NH3 is more basic and more nucleophilic than H2O. It does not hold when 
proceeding down a column in the periodic table. In that case, polarizability involving 
the distortion of the electron density surrounding an atom or ion comes into play. The 
more easily distorted the electron distribution, the more nucleophilic the atom or ion. 
Among the halide ions, for example, I− is the least basic but the most nucleophilic, F−
the most basic but the least nucleophilic. In the same vein, phosphines (R3P) are more 
nucleophilic than amines (R3N), and thioethers (R2S) more nucleophilic than their oxygen 
counterparts (R2O).

*
Relative reactivity is k(nucleophile)/k(methanol) for typical SN2 reactions and is approximate. Data pertain to methanol as the solvent.Another factor, likely the one most responsible for the inverse relationship between 
basicity and nucleophilicity among the halide ions, is the degree to which the ions are 
solvated by ion–dipole forces of the type illustrated in Figure 6.4. Smaller anions, because 
of their high charge-to-size ratio, are more strongly solvated than larger ones. In order 
to act as a nucleophile, the halide must shed some of the solvent molecules that surround 
it. Among the halide anions, ion–dipole forces are strongest for F− and weakest for I−. 
Thus, the nucleophilicity of F− is suppressed more than that of Cl−, Cl− more than Br−, 
and Br− more than I−. Similarly, HO− is smaller, more solvated, and less nucleophilic 
than HS−. The importance of solvation in reducing the nucleophilicity of small anions 
more than larger ones can be seen in the fact that, when measured in the gas phase where 
solvation forces don’t exist, the order of halide nucleophilicity reverses and does track 
basicity: F− > Cl− > Br− > I−.

Enzyme-Catalyzed Nucleophilic Substitutions of Alkyl Halides
Nucleophilic substitution is one of a variety of mechanisms 
by which living systems detoxify halogenated organic com￾pounds introduced into the environment. Enzymes that catalyze 
these reactions are known as haloalkane dehalogenases. The 
hydrolysis of 1,2-dichloroethane to 2-chloroethanol, for exam￾ple, is a biological nucleophilic substitution catalyzed by the 
dehalogenase shown in Figure 6.5.

Some of the most common biological SN2 reactions

S-adenosylmethionine. Examples of these will be given in 
Chapter 17.

6.6 The SN1 Mechanism of Nucleophilic Substitution
Having seen that tertiary alkyl halides are practically inert to substitution by the SN2 mech￾anism because of steric hindrance, we might wonder whether they undergo nucleophilic 
substitution at all. They do, but by a variant of the mechanism introduced in Section 5.8.
In their studies of reaction kinetics, Hughes and Ingold observed that the hydrolysis 
of tert-butyl bromide follows a first-order rate law:
Rate = k[(CH3)3CBr]
tert-Butyl bromide
(CH3)3CBr
tert-Butyl alcohol
(CH3)3COH
Water
2H2O
Hydronium ion
H3O+
Bromide ion
Br− + + +
The reaction rate depends only on the concentration of tert-butyl bromide. Just as they 
interpreted a second-order rate law in terms of a bimolecular rate-determining step, 
Hughes and Ingold saw first-order kinetics as evidence for a unimolecular rate-determining 
step involving only the alkyl halide while independent of both the concentration and 
identity of the nucleophile. Like the SN1 mechanism for the reaction of alcohols with 
hydrogen halides (Section 5.8), this pathway is characterized by the formation of a car￾bocation in the rate-determining step.
The SN1 mechanism for the hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide is presented as a series 
of elementary steps in Mechanism 6.2 and as a potential energy diagram in Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.6
Energy diagram illustrating the SN1 
mechanism for hydrolysis of tert-butyl 
bromide.The key step is the first: a rate-determining unimolecular ionization of the alkyl halide 
to give a carbocation and a halide ion. Following this, capture of the carbocation by a 
water molecule acting as a nucleophile gives an alkyloxonium ion, which is then depro￾tonated by a second water molecule acting as a Brønsted base to complete the process.
In order to compare SN1 rates in alkyl halides, experimental conditions of low 
nucleophilicity such as solvolysis (Section 6.5) are chosen so as to suppress competition 
from SN2 reactions. Under these conditions, the structure/reactivity trend among alkyl 
halides is exactly opposite to the SN2 profile.

6.6 The SN1 Mechanism of Nucleophilic Substitution 225226 Chapter 6 Nucleophilic Substitution
We have seen a similar trend in the reaction of alcohols with hydrogen halides (Section 5.10); 
the more stable the carbocation, the faster it is formed, and the faster the reaction rate. 
Secondary alkyl halides occupy a borderline region in which the nature of the 
nucleophile is the main determining factor in respect to the mechanism. Secondary alkyl 
halides usually react with good nucleophiles by the SN2 mechanism, and with weak 
nucleophiles by SN1. Methyl and primary alkyl halides, on the other hand, never react 
by the SN1 mechanism and tertiary alkyl halides never react by SN2.
Problem 6.9
Identify the compound in each of the following pairs that reacts at the faster rate in an SN1 
reaction:
(a) Isopropyl bromide or isobutyl bromide
(b) Cyclopentyl iodide or 1-methylcyclopentyl iodide
(c) Cyclopentyl bromide or 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylpropane
(d) tert-Butyl chloride or tert-butyl iodide
Sample Solution (a) Isopropyl bromide, (CH3)2CHBr, is a secondary alkyl halide, whereas 
isobutyl bromide, (CH3)2CHCH2Br, is primary. Because the rate-determining step in an SN1 
reaction is carbocation formation and secondary carbocations are more stable than primary 
ones, isopropyl bromide is more reactive than isobutyl bromide in nucleophilic substitution by 
the SN1 mechanism.
Problem 6.10

nucleophilic substitution in bicyclic compounds A and B relative to their tert-butyl counterpart,

6.7 Stereochemistry of SN1 Reactions
Although SN2 reactions are stereospecific and proceed with inversion of configuration at 
carbon, the situation is not as clear-cut for SN1. When the leaving group departs from a 
chirality center of an optically active halide, the positively charged carbon that results is 
sp2
-hybridized and cannot be a chirality center. The three bonds to that carbon define a 
plane of symmetry.
Alkyl halide is chiral Carbocation is achiral
+
+ : –
If a nucleophile can approach each face of the carbocation equally well, substitution by 
the SN1 mechanism should give a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers irrespective of whether the starting alkyl halide is R, S, or racemic. SN1 reactions of alkyl halides should give race￾mic products from optically active starting materials.
But they rarely do. Methanolysis of the tertiary alkyl halide (R)-3-chloro-3,7-
dimethyloctane, which almost certainly proceeds by an SN1 mechanism, takes place with 
a high degree of inversion of configuration.

Partial but not complete loss of optical activity in SN1 reactions is explained as 
shown in Figure 6.7. The key feature of this mechanism is that when the carbocation is 
formed, it is not completely free of the leaving group. Although ionization is complete, 
the leaving group has not yet diffused very far away from the carbon to which it was 
attached and partially blocks approach of the nucleophile from that direction. Nucleo￾philic attack on this species, called an ion pair, occurs faster from the side opposite the 
leaving group. Once the leaving group has diffused away, however, both faces of the 
carbocation are equally accessible to nucleophiles.
The stereochemistry of SN1 substitution depends on the relative rates of competing 
processes—attack by the nucleophile on the ion pair versus separation of the ions. Con￾sequently, the observed stereochemistry varies considerably according to the alkyl halide, 
nucleophile, and experimental conditions. Some give predominant, but incomplete, inver￾sion of configuration. Others give products that are almost entirely racemic.

the product is formed with net inversion 
of configuration. In a process that 
competes with nucleophilic attack on 
the ion pair, the leaving group diffuses 
away from the carbocation. The 
nucleophile attacks the carbocation at 
the same rate from either side to give 
equal amounts of enantiomers.

6.8 Carbocation Rearrangements in SN1 Reactions
Additional evidence for carbocation intermediates in certain nucleophilic substitutions 
comes from observing rearrangements of the kind described in Section 5.12. For example, 
hydrolysis of the secondary alkyl bromide 2-bromo-3-methylbutane yields the rearranged 
tertiary alcohol 2-methyl-2-butanol as the only substitution product.

Mechanism 6.3 for this reaction assumes rate-determining ionization of the alkyl 
halide (step 1), followed by a hydride shift that converts a secondary carbocation to a 
more stable tertiary one (step 2). The tertiary carbocation then reacts with water to yield 
the observed product (steps 3 and 4).
Problem 6.12
Why does the carbocation intermediate in the hydrolysis of 2-bromo-3-methylbutane

H6.9 Effect of Solvent on the Rate of Nucleophilic Substitution 229
Rearrangements, when they do occur, are taken as evidence for carbocation inter￾mediates and point to the SN1 mechanism as the reaction pathway. Rearrangements are 
never observed in SN2 reactions of alkyl halides.
6.9 Effect of Solvent on the Rate 
of Nucleophilic Substitution
The major effect of the solvent is on the rate of nucleophilic substitution, not on what 
the products are. Thus, we need to consider two related questions:
1. What properties of the solvent influence the rate most?
2. How does the rate-determining step of the mechanism respond to the properties of 
the solvent?
We begin by looking at the solvents commonly employed in nucleophilic substitutions, 
then proceed to examine how these properties affect the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. Because 
these mechanisms are so different from each other, we discuss each one separately.
Classes of Solvents. Table 6.3 lists a number of solvents in which nucleophilic sub￾stitutions are carried out and classifies them according to two criteria: whether they are 
protic or aprotic, and polar or nonpolar.
Protic solvents are those that are capable of hydrogen-bonding interactions. Most 
have OH groups, as do the examples in Table 6.3 (water, formic acid, methanol, and 
acetic acid). The aprotic solvents in the table (dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, 
and acetonitrile) lack —OH groups.
The polarity of a solvent is related to its dielectric constant (ε), which is a measure 
of the ability of a material to moderate the force of attraction between oppositely charged 
particles. The standard dielectric is a vacuum, assigned a value ε of exactly 1, to which 
the polarities of other materials are then compared. The higher the dielectric constant ε,
the better the medium is able to support separated positively and negatively charged spe￾cies. Solvents with high dielectric constants are classified as polar solvents; those with 
low dielectric constants are nonpolar.
Problem 6.13
Diethyl ether (CH3CH2OCH2CH3) has a dielectric constant of 4. What best describes its 
solvent properties: polar protic, nonpolar protic, polar aprotic, or nonpolar aprotic?
Unlike protic and aprotic, which 
constitute an “either-or” pair, polar 
and nonpolar belong to a continuous 
gradation with no sharply defined 
boundary separating them.

Solvent Effects on the Rate of Substitution by the SN1 Mechanism. Table 6.4 gives 
the relative rate of solvolysis of tert-butyl chloride in several protic solvents listed in 
order of increasing dielectric constant. As the table illustrates, the rate of solvolysis of 
tert-butyl chloride (which is equal to its rate of ionization) increases dramatically as the 
solvent becomes more polar.
According to the SN1 mechanism, a molecule of an alkyl halide ionizes to a posi￾tively charged carbocation and a negatively charged halide ion in the rate-determining 
step. As the alkyl halide approaches the transition state for this step, positive charge 
develops on the carbon and negative charge on the halogen. The effects of a nonpolar 
and a polar solvent on the energy of the transition state are contrasted in Figure 6.8. 
Polar and nonpolar solvents are similar in their interaction with the starting alkyl halide, 
but differ markedly in how they stabilize the transition state. A solvent with a low dielec￾tric constant has little effect on the energy of the transition state, whereas one with a 
high dielectric constant stabilizes the charge-separated transition state, lowers the activa￾tion energy, and increases the rate of the reaction.
If the solvent, like those listed in Table 6.3, is protic, stabilization of the transition 
state is pronounced because of the hydrogen bonding that develops as the leaving group 
becomes negatively charged.

as the sodium and potassium salts cited earlier in Table 6.1, are not sufficiently 
soluble in nonpolar solvents to give a high enough concentration of the nucleophile 
to allow the reaction to occur at a rapid rate. Other than the requirement that the 
solvent be polar enough to dissolve ionic compounds, however, the effect of solvent 
polarity on the rate of SN2 reactions is small. What is more important is whether the 
polar solvent is protic or aprotic. Protic solvents all have OH groups that allow 
them to form hydrogen bonds to anionic nucleophiles.

This clustering of protic solvent molecules (solvation) around an anion as illustrated in 
Figure 6.4, suppresses its nucleophilicity and retards the rate of bimolecular substitution.
Aprotic solvents, on the other hand, lack OH groups and do not solvate anions 
very strongly, leaving the anions much more able to express their nucleophilic character.

6.9 Effect of Solvent on the Rate of Nucleophilic Substitution 231232 Chapter 6 Nucleophilic Substitution
The large rate enhancements observed for bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions in 
polar aprotic solvents offer advantages in synthesis. One example is the preparation of 
alkyl cyanides (nitriles) by the reaction of sodium cyanide with alkyl halides:
X CN
Hexyl halide Hexyl cyanide
+ + NaX
Sodium cyanide Sodium halide
NaCN
When the reaction was carried out in aqueous methanol as the polar protic solvent, hexyl 
bromide was converted to hexyl cyanide in 71% yield. Although this is perfectly accept￾able for a synthetic reaction, it required heating for a period of over 20 hours. Changing 
the solvent to the polar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide increased the reaction rate to the 
extent that the less reactive (and less expensive) hexyl chloride could be used and 
the reaction was complete (91% yield) in only 20 minutes!
The rate at which reactions occur can be important in the laboratory, and under￾standing how solvents affect rate is of practical value. As we proceed through the text, 
however, and see how nucleophilic substitution is applied to a variety of functional-group 
transformations, be aware that the nature of both the substrate and the nucleophile, more 
than anything else, determines what product is formed.
6.10 Nucleophilic Substitution of Alkyl Sulfonates
A few other classes of organic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions 
analogous to those of alkyl halides; the most important of these are sulfonates.
Sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid are strong 
acids, comparable in acidity with sulfuric acid.

Alkyl sulfonates resemble alkyl halides in their ability to undergo nucleophilic

as tosylates and abbreviated as ROTs.

As shown in Table 6.6, alkyl tosylates undergo nucleophilic substitution at rates that are 
even faster than those of the corresponding iodides. Iodide is the weakest base and the best 
leaving group among the halide anions. Similarly, sulfonate ions rank among the least 
basic of the oxygen-containing leaving groups. The weaker the base, the better the leaving 
group. Trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate, CF3SO2O−) is a much weaker base than 
p-toluenesulfonate and is the best leaving group in the table.
Notice that strongly basic leaving groups are absent from Table 6.6. In general, any 
species that has pKa greater than about 2 for its conjugate acid cannot be a leaving group 
in a nucleophilic substitution. Thus, hydroxide (HO−) is far too strong a base to be dis￾placed from an alcohol (ROH), and alcohols themselves do not undergo nucleophilic 
substitution. In strongly acidic media, alcohols are protonated to give alkyloxonium ions, 
and these do undergo nucleophilic substitution, because the leaving group is a weakly 
basic water molecule. SN2 reactions are most favorable when a more basic nucleophile 
displaces a less basic leaving group.
Because halides are poorer leaving groups than p-toluenesulfonate, alkyl p-toluene￾sulfonates can be converted to alkyl halides by SN2 reactions involving chloride, bromide, 
or iodide as the nucleophile.

and the product of nucleophilic substitution is octadecyl acetate.

An advantage that sulfonates have over alkyl halides is that their preparation from 
alcohols does not involve any of the bonds to carbon. The alcohol oxygen becomes the 
oxygen that connects the alkyl group to the sulfonyl group. Thus, the stereochemical 
configuration of a sulfonate is the same as that of the alcohol from which it was prepared. 
If we wish to study the stereochemistry of nucleophilic substitution in an optically active 
substrate, for example, we know that a tosylate will have the same configuration and the 
same optical purity as the alcohol from which it was prepared.

The same cannot be said about reactions with alkyl halides. The conversion of optically 
active 2-octanol to the corresponding halide does involve a bond to the chirality center, 
and so the optical purity and absolute configuration of the alkyl halide need to be inde￾pendently established.The mechanisms by which sulfonates undergo nucleophilic substitution are the 
same as those of alkyl halides. Inversion of configuration is observed in SN2 reactions 
of alkyl sulfonates and predominant inversion accompanied by racemization in SN1 
processes.

6.11 Introduction to Organic Synthesis: 
Retrosynthetic Analysis
An important concern to chemists is synthesis, the challenge of preparing a particular 
compound in an economical way with confidence that the method chosen will lead to 
the desired structure. In this section we introduce the topic of synthesis, emphasizing the 
need for systematic planning to find the best sequence of steps to prepare a desired 
product (the target molecule).
Two critical features of synthetic planning are to always use reactions that you 
know will work and to reason backward from the target to the starting material. A way 
to represent this backward reasoning is called retrosynthetic analysis, characterized 
by an arrow of the type ⟹ pointing from the product of a synthetic step toward the 
reactant.
Suppose you wanted to prepare (R)-2-butanethiol from (S)-2-butanol.
OH
H
(S)-2-Butanol
SH
H
(R)-2-Butanethiol
Begin by asking the question “From what can I prepare the target molecule in a single 
step?” Table 6.1 tells us that alkyl halides react with HS− by nucleophilic substitution 
to give thiols. Therefore, we are tempted to consider the retrosynthesis shown.
Br
H
(S)-2-Bromobutane
SH
H
(R)-2-Butanethiol
OH
H
(S)-2-Butanol
The flaw in this plan is stereochemical in that it requires that (S)-2-butanol be converted 
to (S)-2-bromobutane in order to get the correct enantiomer of the desired thiol. We 
know, however, that the reaction of alcohols with hydrogen halides proceeds with inver￾sion of configuration (Section 5.11). Therefore, we need an alternative plan—one that 
takes into account both the functionality and configuration at C-2. One based on a sul￾fonate leaving group satisfies both considerations.
Retrosynthetic analysis is one 
component of a formal system of 
synthetic planning developed by 
E. J. Corey (Harvard). Corey received 
the 1990 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 
achievements in synthetic organic 
chemistry.

Problem 6.18
Use retrosynthetic analysis to devise a synthesis of 2-bromo-3-methylbutane. You will find it 
useful to refer to Sections 6.3 and 6.10.
Chemists are often presented with the task of preparing a target molecule from an 
unspecified starting material. Usually there will be several possibilities and choosing the 
best one includes considering a number of factors—availability of the starting materials, 
cost, scale, and disposal of hazardous waste, among others. As we proceed through the 
text and develop a larger inventory of functional-group transformations and methods for 
forming carbon–carbon bonds, our ability to evaluate alternative synthetic plans will 
increase. In most cases the best synthetic plan is the one with the fewest steps.
6.12 Substitution versus Elimination: A Look Ahead
Early in this chapter, Table 6.1 listed a number of examples in which alkyl halides were 
converted to other functional-group classes by nucleophilic substitution. As the chapter 
progressed, important aspects of nucleophilic substitution were developed from a mech￾anistic perspective based on the SN1/SN2 concepts of Hughes and Ingold. As we close 
the chapter, we return to the use of nucleophilic substitution as a synthetic method for 
functional-group transformation, particularly with regard to its major limitation.
The major limitation to nucleophilic substitution as applied to both alkyl halides 
and sulfonates is that similar reaction conditions can lead to elimination as well as, or 
even instead of, substitution.

Thus, a particular combination of reactants can give a mixture containing the products 
of elimination and/or substitution depending on a number of factors. These factors will 
be explored in detail in Chapter 7. For the present chapter, however, nucleophilic sub￾stitution has predominated over elimination in all of the reactions discussed so far and 
will in the end-of-chapter problems as well.6.13 Summary 237
6.13 SUMMARY
Section 6.1 Nucleophilic substitution is one of the main methods for functional-group 
transformations. Examples of synthetically useful nucleophilic substitutions 
were given in Table 6.1. It is a good idea to return to that table and review 
its entries now that the details of nucleophilic substitution have been 
covered.
Sections These sections show how a variety of experimental observations led to the 
proposal of the SN1 and the SN2 mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution. 
Summary Table 6.7 integrates the material in these sections.

RI > RBr > RCl >> RF (Section 6.2) RI > RBr > RCl >> RF (Section 6.2)
Effect of structure on rate R3CX > R2CHX > RCH2X > CH3X
Rate is governed by stability of carbocation 
that is formed in ionization step. Tertiary alkyl 
halides can react only by the SN1 mechanism; 
they never react by the SN2 mechanism. 
(Section 6.6)
CH3X > RCH2X > R2CHX > R3CX
Rate is governed by steric effects (crowding 
in transition state). Methyl and primary alkyl 
halides can react only by the SN2 mechanism; 
they never react by the SN1 mechanism. 
(Section 6.6)
Effect of nucleophile on rate Rate of substitution is independent of both 
concentration and nature of nucleophile. 
Nucleophile does not participate until after 
rate-determining step. (Section 6.6)
Rate depends on both nature of nucleophile 
and its concentration. (Sections 6.3 and 6.5)
Effect of solvent on rate Rate increases with increasing polarity of 
solvent as measured by its dielectric 
constant ε. (Section 6.9)
Polar aprotic solvents give fastest rates of 
substitution; solvation of Nu:− is minimal and 
nucleophilicity is greatest. (Section 6.9)
Stereochemistry Not stereospecific: racemization accompanies 
inversion when leaving group is located at a 
chirality center. (Section 6.7)
Stereospecific: 100% inversion of 
configuration at reaction site. Nucleophile 
attacks carbon from side opposite bond to 
leaving group. (Section 6.3)
Potential for rearrangements Carbocation intermediate capable of 
rearrangement. (Section 6.8)
No carbocation intermediate; no 
rearrangement.238 Chapter 6 Nucleophilic Substitution
Section 6.10 Nucleophilic substitution can occur with leaving groups other than halide. Alkyl 
p-toluenesulfonates (tosylates), which are prepared from alcohols by reaction 
with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, are often used.

Nucleophilic Substitution
These problems differ from those in earlier chapters in that they directly test your knowledge of 
core material rather than using a descriptive passage to extend the material or introduce new ideas.

Structure and Preparation of 
Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
Alkenes are hydrocarbons that contain a carbon–carbon double 
bond. A carbon–carbon double bond is both an important struc￾tural unit and an important functional group in organic chem￾istry. The shape of an organic molecule is influenced by its 
presence, and the double bond is the site of most of the chem￾ical reactions that alkenes undergo.
This chapter is the first of two dealing with alkenes; it 
describes their structure, bonding, and preparation. Chapter 8 
examines their chemical reactions.
7.1 Alkene Nomenclature
We give alkenes IUPAC names by replacing the -ane ending of 
the corresponding alkane with -ene. The two simplest alkenes 
are ethene and propene. Both are also well known by their 
common names ethylene and propylene.
IUPAC name: ethene
Common name: ethylene
H2C CH2 CH3CH CH2
IUPAC name: propene
Common name: propylene
Squalene (C30H50) is a hydrocarbon with six carbon–carbon double bonds. 
It is present in plants and animals and, as will be seen in Chapter 24, is the 
biosynthetic precursor to steroids such as cholesterol.
Sodapix AG, Switzerland/Fotosearch/Glow Images7.1 Alkene Nomenclature 247
The alkene corresponding to the longest continuous chain that includes the double 
bond is considered the parent, and the chain is numbered in the direction that gives the 
doubly bonded carbons their lower numbers. The locant (or numerical position) of only 
one of the doubly bonded carbons is specified in the name; it is understood that the other 
doubly bonded carbon must follow in sequence. According to various versions of the 
IUPAC rules, the locant may precede the parent chain or the -ene suffix. Both versions are 
widely used. Carbon–carbon double bonds take precedence over alkyl groups and halogens 
in determining the main carbon chain and the direction in which it is numbered.

Hydroxyl groups, however, outrank the double bond, and a chain that contains both an 
OH group and a double bond is numbered in the direction that gives the carbon 
attached to the OH group the lower number. Compounds that contain both a double 
bond and a hydroxyl group combine the suffixes -en + -ol to signify that both functional 
groups are present.

vinyl, has many applications, including 
siding for houses, wall coverings, and 
PVC piping.248 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions

No locants are needed in the absence of substituents; it is understood that the double 
bond connects C-1 and C-2. Substituted cycloalkenes are numbered beginning with the 
double bond, proceeding through it, and continuing in sequence around the ring. The 
direction is chosen so as to give the lower of two possible numbers to the substituent.
Problem 7.2
Write structural formulas and give the IUPAC names of all the monochloro-substituted 
derivatives of cyclopentene. Include enantiomers and assign R- and S-configurations as 
appropriate. Which isomers are allylic chlorides? Which are vinylic?
7.2 Structure and Bonding in Alkenes
The structure of ethylene and the orbital hybridization model for its double bond were 
presented in Section 2.8 and are briefly reviewed in Figure 7.1. Ethylene is planar, each 
carbon is sp2
-hybridized, and the double bond has a σ component and a π component. 
The σ component arises from overlap of sp2
 hybrid orbitals along a line connecting the 
two carbons, the π component via a “side-by-side” overlap of two p orbitals. Regions of 
high π electron density are present above and below the plane of the molecule. Most of 
the reactions of ethylene and other alkenes involve these π electrons.

˚7.2 Structure and Bonding in Alkenes 249
Molecular orbital (MO) theory offers an alternative to the valence bond theory for 
understanding the structure of alkenes. Recall from Section 2.4 that the number of molec￾ular orbitals is equal to the number of atomic orbitals (AOs) that combine to form them. 
When we combine the two 2p AOs, one from each of the sp2
-hybridized carbons of ethene, 
the two π MOs are formed as shown in Figure 7.2. The highest occupied molecular 
orbital, or HOMO (π1), is doubly occupied, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital, or LUMO (π2), is vacant. Since both lobes above and both lobes below the 
sigma bond of the HOMO are the same, π bonding occurs.
On the basis of their bond-dissociation enthalpies, the CC bond in ethylene is 
stronger than the CC single bond in ethane, but it is not twice as strong.
H2C CH2

2 CH2 ΔH° = +728 kJ/mol (174 kcal/mol)
H3C CH3
Ethane Methyl
2 CH3 ΔH° = +377 kJ/mol (90 kcal/mol)
While it is not possible to apportion the CC bond energy of ethylene between its σ and 
π components, the data suggest that the π bond is weaker than the σ bond.
Ethylene
Ethylene was known to chemists in the eighteenth century 
and isolated in pure form in 1795. An early name for ethylene 
was gaz oléfiant (French for “oil-forming gas”), to describe the 
fact that an oily liquid product is formed when two gases— 
ethylene and chlorine—react with each other.
H2C CH2 + Cl2 ClCH2CH2Cl
Ethylene
(bp: −104°C )
Chlorine
(bp: −34°C)
1,2-Dichloroethane
(bp: 83°C)
The term gaz oléfiant was the forerunner of the general term 
olefin, formerly used as the name of the class of compounds we 
now call alkenes.
Ethylene occurs naturally in small amounts as a plant hor￾mone. It is formed in a complex series of steps from a compound 
containing a cyclopropane ring:
NH3
CO2
−
+
1-Amino￾cyclopropane￾carboxylic acid
several
steps H2C CH2
Ethylene
+ other products
Even minute amounts of ethylene can stimulate the ripening of 
fruits, and the rate of ripening increases with the concentration 
of ethylene. This property is used to advantage in the marketing 
of bananas. Bananas are picked green in the tropics, kept green 
by being stored with adequate ventilation to limit the amount of 
ethylene present, and then induced to ripen at their destination 
by passing ethylene over the fruit.
Ethylene is the cornerstone of the world’s mammoth petro￾chemical industry and is produced in vast quantities. In a typical 
year the amount of ethylene produced in the United States 
(5 × 1010 lb) exceeds the combined weight of all of its people. In 
one process, ethane from natural gas is heated to bring about its 
dissociation into ethylene and hydrogen:
H2C CH2
Ethylene
CH3CH3
Ethane
+ H2
Hydrogen
750°C
This dehydrogenation is simultaneously both a source of ethyl￾ene and one of the methods by which hydrogen is prepared on 
an industrial scale. Most of this hydrogen is subsequently used 
to reduce nitrogen to ammonia for the preparation of fertilizer.
Similarly, dehydrogenation of propane gives propene:
H2C CHCH3
Propene
CH3CH2CH3
Propane
+ H2

750°C
Propene is the second most important petrochemical and is 
produced on a scale about half that of ethylene.
Almost any hydrocarbon can serve as a starting material 
for production of ethylene and propene. Cracking of petroleum 
(Section 2.21) gives ethylene and propene by processes involv￾ing cleavage of carbon–carbon bonds of higher-molecular￾weight hydrocarbons. An area of current research interest is 
directed toward finding catalytic methods for converting meth￾ane from natural gas to ethylene.
The major uses of ethylene and propene are as starting 
materials for the preparation of polyethylene and polypropylene 
plastics, fibers, and films. These and other applications will be 
described in Chapter 8.250 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
There are two different types of carbon–carbon bonds in propene, CH3CHCH2.

7.3 Isomerism in Alkenes

alkene, there are four isomeric alkenes of molecular formula C4H8:

Two molecular orbitals (MOs) are

orbitals (AOs). The bonding MO is lower

combine to produce it. The antibonding 
MO is higher energy than either AO.7.3 Isomerism in Alkenes 251
1-Butene has an unbranched carbon chain with a double bond between C-1 and C-2. It 
is a constitutional isomer of the other three. Similarly, 2-methylpropene, with a branched 
carbon chain, is a constitutional isomer of the other three.
The pair of isomers designated cis- and trans-2-butene are stereoisomers of each 
other. They have the same constitution; but the cis isomer has both of its methyl groups 
on the same side of the double bond, while the methyl groups in the trans isomer are 
on opposite sides.
Cis–trans stereoisomerism in alkenes is not possible when one of the doubly bonded 
carbons bears two identical substituents. Thus, neither 1-butene nor 2-methylpropene can 
have stereoisomers.

How many alkenes have the molecular formula C5H10? Write their structures and give their

In principle, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene may be interconverted by rotation 
about the C-2—C-3 double bond. However, unlike rotation about single bonds, which 
is quite fast, rotation about double bonds is restricted. Interconversion of the cis and 
trans isomers of 2-butene has an activation energy that is 10–15 times greater than that 
for rotation about the single bond of an alkane and does not occur under normal 
circumstances.

π-Bonding in cis- and trans-2-butene is strong because of the favorable parallel alignment 
of the p orbitals at C-2 and C-3. Interconverting the two stereoisomers, however, requires 
these p orbitals to be at right angles to each other, eliminates their overlap, and breaks 
the π component of the double bond.

Are cis-2-hexene and trans-3-hexene stereoisomers? Explain.252 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
7.4 Naming Stereoisomeric Alkenes 
by the E–Z Notational System
When the groups on either end of a double bond are the same or are structurally similar 
to each other, it is a simple matter to describe the configuration of the double bond as 
cis or trans. Oleic acid, for example, has a cis double bond. Cinnamaldehyde has a trans 
double bond.

Problem 7.6
Female houseflies attract males by sending a chemical signal known as a pheromone. 
The substance emitted by the female housefly that attracts the male has been identified 
as cis-9-tricosene, C23H46. Write a structural formula, including stereochemistry, for this 
compound.
The terms cis and trans are ambiguous, however, when it is not obvious which 
substituent on one carbon is “similar” or “analogous” to a reference substituent on the 
other. An unambiguous system for specifying double-bond stereochemistry has been 
adopted by the IUPAC based on the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog sequence rules (Section 4.6). 
When atoms or groups of higher sequence-rule precedence are on the same side of the 
double bond, the double bond has the Z configuration, where Z stands for the German 
word zusammen, meaning “together.” When they are on opposite sides, the configuration 
is E, standing for the German word entgegen, meaning “opposite.” The E or Z descrip￾tor is placed between parentheses and precedes the rest of the name.

Give the IUPAC name of each of the compounds in Problem 7.7, including E or Z as appropriate.
Sample Solution (a) The longest continuous chain has 4 carbons and bears a hydroxyl 
group at C-1 and a methyl group at C-2. Its double bond connects C-2 and C-3 and has the 
Z configuration. Its IUPAC name is (Z)-2-methyl-2-buten-1-ol.
A molecule that has both chirality centers and double bonds incorporates opportu￾nities for stereoisomerism from both structural units. For example, the configuration of 
the chirality center in 3-penten-2-ol may be either R or S, and the double bond may be 
either E or Z. Thus, there are four stereoisomers of 3-penten-2-ol.
OH OH OH OH
(2R,3E)-3-Penten-2-ol (2S,3E)-3-Penten-2-ol (2R,3Z)-3-Penten-2-ol (2S,3Z)-3-Penten-2-ol
The relationship of the (2R,3E) stereoisomer to the others is that it is the enantiomer 
of (2S,3E)-3-penten-2-ol and is a diastereomer of the (2R,3Z) and (2S,3Z) isomers.
7.5 Physical Properties of Alkenes
Alkenes resemble alkanes in most of their physical properties. The lower-molecular￾weight alkenes through C4H8 are gases at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
The dipole moments of most alkenes are quite small. Among the C4H8 isomers, 
1-butene, cis-2-butene, and 2-methylpropene have dipole moments in the 0.3–0.5 D 
range; trans-2-butene has no dipole moment. Nevertheless, we can learn some things 
about alkenes by looking at the effect of substituents on dipole moments.
Experimental measurements of dipole moments give size, but not direction. We nor￾mally deduce the overall direction by examining the individual bond dipoles. With alkenes 
the basic question concerns the alkyl groups attached to CC. Does an alkyl group donate 
electrons to or withdraw electrons from a double bond? This question can be approached 
by comparing the effect of an alkyl group, methyl for example, with other substituents.

Ethylene has no dipole moment. Replacing one of its hydrogens by an electron-attracting 
chlorine atom gives vinyl chloride, which has a dipole moment of 1.4 D. The effect is 
much smaller when one of the hydrogens of ethylene is replaced by methyl; propene has 
a dipole moment of only 0.3 D. Now place CH3 and Cl trans to each other on the 
double bond. If methyl releases electrons better than H, then the dipole moment of trans￾CH3CHCHCl should be larger than that of H2CCHCl, because the effects of CH3
and Cl reinforce each other. If methyl is electron attracting, the opposite should occur, 
and the dipole moment of trans-CH3CHCHCl will be smaller than 1.4 D. In fact, the 
dipole moment of trans-CH3CHCHCl is larger than that of H2CCHCl, indicating 
that a methyl group acts as an electron-donating substituent on the double bond.
Problem 7.9
Arrange the following in order of increasing dipole moment.
Cl Cl
Cl
Cl Cl
(E)-1-Chloropropene 1,1-Dichloro-2-methylpropene (E)-2,3-Dichloro-2-butene
A methyl group releases electrons to an attached double bond in much the same way 
that it releases electrons to an sp2
-hybridized carbon of a carbocation—by an inductive 
effect and by hyperconjugation. These effects are less pronounced compared to carbocations 
since a severely electron-deficient carbocation center is not involved.
Other alkyl groups resemble methyl in respect to their ability to stabilize double 
bonds by hyperconjugation. We’ll see examples of this substituent effect in Section 7.6.
7.6 Relative Stabilities of Alkenes
We have seen how heats of combustion can be used to compare the stabilities of isomeric 
alkanes (Section 2.23) and dimethylcyclohexanes (Section 3.12). When a similar analysis 
of heats of combustion data is applied to the four alkenes of molecular formula C4H8, 
we find that l-butene is the least stable isomer and 2-methylpropene the most stable. Of 
the pair of stereoisomeric 2-butenes, trans-2-butene is more stable than cis-.

Alkene stability depends on substitution

Increasing stability
Similar data for a host of alkenes tell us that the most important factors governing 
alkene stability are:
1. Degree of substitution of CC (an electronic effect)
2. van der Waals strain in the cis stereoisomer (a steric effect)
3. Chain branching (analogous to the increased stability of branched alkane chains 
relative to their unbranched isomers, Section 2.23)7.6 Relative Stabilities of Alkenes 255
Degree of substitution refers to the number of carbons directly attached to the CC 
unit. An alkene of the type RCHCH2 has a monosubstituted or terminal double bond 
regardless of the number of carbons in R. Disubstituted, trisubstituted, and tetrasubstituted
double bonds have two, three, and four carbon atoms, respectively, directly attached to 
CC. Among the C4H8 isomeric alkenes, only 1-butene has a monosubstituted double 
bond; the other three have disubstituted double bonds and are, as measured by their heats 
of combustion, more stable than 1-butene.
Problem 7.10
Write structural formulas and give the IUPAC names for all the alkenes of molecular formula 
C6H12 that contain a trisubstituted double bond. (Don’t forget to include stereoisomers.)
Like the sp2
-hybridized carbons of carbocations and free radicals, the sp2
-hybridized 
carbons of double bonds are electron attracting, and alkenes are stabilized by substituents 
that release electrons to these carbons. As we saw in the preceding section, alkyl groups 
are better electron-releasing substituents than hydrogen and are, therefore, better able to 
stabilize an alkene.
In general, alkenes with more highly substituted double bonds are more stable than isomers 
with less substituted double bonds.
Problem 7.11
The heats of combustion are known for all 17 isomeric C6H12 alkenes, with the most stable 
being 4006 kJ/mol (957.5 kcal/mol) and the least stable being 4034 kJ/mol (964.2 kcal/mol). 
Which is the least stable and which is the most stable?
An effect that results when two or more atoms or groups interact so as to alter the 
electron distribution in a molecule is called an electronic effect. The greater stability of 
more highly substituted alkenes is an example of an electronic effect.
Van der Waals strain in alkenes is a steric effect most commonly associated with 
repulsive forces between substituents that are cis to each other and is reflected in the 
observation that the heat of combustion of cis-2-butene is 4 kJ/mol (1.0 kcal/mol) greater 
than trans-2-butene. The source of this difference is illustrated in the space-filling mod￾els of Figure 7.3, where it can be seen that the methyl groups crowd each other in cis,
but not trans-2-butene.
In general, trans alkenes are more stable than their cis stereoisomers.
Problem 7.12
Arrange the following alkenes in order of decreasing stability: 1-pentene; (E)-2-pentene; 
(Z)-2-pentene; 2-methyl-2-butene.
A more dramatic example of this difference is observed between stereoisomeric 
alkenes with bulky alkyl groups as substituents on the double bond. The heat of combus￾tion of the cis stereoisomer of 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hexene, for example, is 44 kJ/mol 
(10.5 kcal/mol) higher than that of the trans because of van der Waals strain between cis 
tert-butyl groups!

The common names of these alkenes 
are cis- and trans-di-tert-butylethylene. 
In cases such as this the common 
names are more convenient than the 
IUPAC names because they are more 
readily associated with molecular 
structure.256 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
Problem 7.13
Despite numerous attempts, the alkene 3,4-di-tert-butyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hexene has 
never been synthesized. Can you explain why?
Chain branching was seen earlier (Section 2.23) to have a stabilizing effect on 
alkanes. The same is true of carbon chains that include a double bond. Of the three 
disubstituted C4H8 alkenes, the branched isomer (CH3)2CCH2 is more stable than either 
cis- or trans-CH3CHCHCH3.
In general, alkenes with branched chains are more stable than unbranched isomers. This 
effect is usually less important than the degree of substitution or stereochemistry of the 
double bond.
Problem 7.14
Write structural formulas for the six isomeric alkenes of molecular formula C5H10 and arrange 
them in order of increasing stability (smaller heat of combustion, more negative ΔH°f ).
7.7 Cycloalkenes
Double bonds are accommodated by rings of all sizes. The smallest cycloalkene, cyclo￾propene, was first synthesized in 1922. A cyclopropene ring is present in sterculic acid, 
a substance derived from the oil present in the seeds of a tree (Sterculia foetida) that 
grows in the Philippines and Indonesia.

As we saw in Section 3.5, cyclopropane is destabilized by angle strain because its 60° bond 
angles are much smaller than the normal 109.5° angles associated with sp3
-hybridized 
carbon. Cyclopropene is even more strained because of the distortion of the bond angles 
at its doubly bonded carbons from their normal sp2
-hybridization value of 120°. Cyclobutene 
has less angle strain than cyclopropene, and the angle strain in cyclopentene, cyclohexene, 
and higher cycloalkenes is negligible.
The presence of the double bond in cycloalkenes affects the conformation of the 
ring. The conformation of cyclohexene is a half-chair, with carbons 1, 2, 3, and 6 in the 
same plane, and carbons 4 and 5 above and below the plane. Substituents at carbons 3 
and 6 are tilted from their usual axial and equatorial orientations and are referred to as 
pseudoaxial and pseudoequatorial. Conversion to the alternative half-chair occurs readily, 
with an energy barrier of 22.2 kJ/mol (5.3 kcal/mol), which is about one half that required 
for chair-to-chair interconversion in cyclohexane.

So far we have represented cycloalkenes by structural formulas in which the double 
bonds are of the cis configuration. If the ring is large enough, however, a trans stereo￾isomer is also possible. The smallest trans cycloalkene that is stable enough to be isolated 
and stored in a normal way is trans-cyclooctene.

trans-Cycloheptene has been prepared and studied at low temperature (−90°C) but 
is too reactive to be isolated and stored at room temperature. Evidence has also been 
presented for the fleeting existence of the even more strained trans-cyclohexene as a 
reactive intermediate in certain reactions.

In the Z stereoisomer the two lower priority substituents—the methyl group and the 
hydrogen—are on the same side of the double bond. In the E stereoisomer these 
substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. The ring carbons are the higher 
ranking substituents at each end of the double bond.
CH3258 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
Because larger rings have more carbons with which to span the ends of a double bond, 
the strain associated with a trans cycloalkene decreases with increasing ring size. The strain 
eventually disappears when a 12-membered ring is reached and cis- and trans-cyclododecene 
are of approximately equal stability. When the rings are larger than 12-membered, trans 
cycloalkenes are more stable than cis. In these cases, the ring is large enough and flexible 
enough that it is energetically similar to a noncyclic cis alkene.
7.8 Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
The rest of this chapter describes how alkenes are prepared by elimination—that is, reac￾tions of the type:
X C C Y C C + X Y α β
Alkene formation requires that X and Y be substituents on adjacent carbon atoms. By 
making X the reference atom and identifying the carbon attached to it as the α carbon, 
we see that atom Y is a substituent on the β carbon. Carbons succeedingly more 
remote from the reference atom are designated γ, δ, and so on. Only β elimination 
reactions will be discussed in this chapter. β Eliminations are also known as 1,2 
eliminations.
You are already familiar with one type of β elimination, having seen in Section 7.2 
that ethylene and propene are prepared on an industrial scale by the high-temperature 
dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Both reactions involve β elimination of H2.

Dehydrogenation of alkanes is not a practical laboratory synthesis for the vast 
majority of alkenes. The principal methods by which alkenes are prepared in the labo￾ratory are two other β eliminations: the dehydration of alcohols and the dehydrohalo￾genation of alkyl halides. A discussion of these two methods makes up the remainder 
of this chapter.
7.9 Dehydration of Alcohols
In the dehydration of alcohols, H and OH are lost from adjacent carbons. An acid 
catalyst is necessary. Before dehydrogenation of ethane became the dominant method, 
ethylene was prepared by heating ethyl alcohol with sulfuric acid.

Reaction conditions, such as the acid used and the temperature, are chosen to maximize

(H3PO4) are the acids most frequently used in alcohol dehydrations. Potassium hydrogen 
sulfate (KHSO4) is also often used.

7.10 Regioselectivity in Alcohol Dehydration: The Zaitsev Rule
Except for the biochemical example just cited, the structures of all of the alcohols 
in Section 7.9 were such that each one could give only a single alkene by β elimination. 
What about elimination in alcohols such as 2-methyl-2-butanol, in which dehydration 
HSO4
− and H3PO4 are very similar in 
acid strength. Both are much weaker 
than H2SO4, which is a strong acid.260 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
can occur in two different directions to give alkenes that are constitutional isomers? 
Here, a double bond can be generated between C-1 and C-2 or between C-2 and 
C-3. Both processes occur but not nearly to the same extent. Under the usual reac￾tion  conditions 2-methyl-2-butene is the major product, and 2-methyl-1-butene the 
minor one.

Dehydration of this alcohol is selective in respect to its direction. Elimination 
occurs in the direction that leads to the double bond between C-2 and C-3 more than 
between C-2 and C-1. Reactions that can proceed in more than one direction, but in 
which one direction is preferred, are said to be regioselective.
In 1875, Alexander M. Zaitsev of the University of Kazan (Russia) set forth a 
generalization describing the regioselectivity of β eliminations. Zaitsev’s rule summa￾rizes the results of numerous experiments in which alkene mixtures were produced by 
β elimination. In its original form, Zaitsev’s rule stated that the alkene formed in great￾est  amount is the one that corresponds to removal of the hydrogen from the β carbon 
having the fewest hydrogens.

Zaitsev’s rule as applied to the acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohols is now more 
often expressed in a different way: β elimination reactions of alcohols yield the most 
highly substituted alkene as the major product. Because, as was discussed in Section 7.6, 
the most highly substituted alkene is also normally the most stable one, Zaitsev’s rule is 
sometimes expressed as a preference for predominant formation of the most stable alkene 
that could arise by β elimination.
Problem 7.17
Each of the following alcohols has been subjected to acid-catalyzed dehydration and yields a

most often in German scientific 
journals, where the name Zaitsev
was transliterated as Saytzeff. The 
spelling used here corresponds to 
the currently preferred style.7.12 The E1 and E2 Mechanisms of Alcohol Dehydration 261
The major product is 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene. It has a tetrasubstituted double bond and is 
more stable than 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene, which has a disubstituted double bond. The major 
alkene arises by loss of a hydrogen from the β carbon that has fewer attached hydrogens 
(C-3) rather than from the β carbon that has the greater number of hydrogens (C-1).
7.11 Stereoselectivity in Alcohol Dehydration
In addition to being regioselective, alcohol dehydrations are stereoselective. A 
stereoselective reaction is one in which a single starting material can yield two or more 
stereoisomeric products, but gives one of them in greater amounts than any other. Alcohol 
dehydrations tend to produce the more stable stereoisomer of an alkene. Dehydration of 
3-pentanol, for example, yields a mixture of trans-2-pentene and cis-2-pentene in which 
the more stable trans stereoisomer predominates.

What three alkenes are formed in the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 2-pentanol?
7.12 The E1 and E2 Mechanisms of Alcohol Dehydration
We saw in Chapter 6 that nucleophilic substitution mechanisms were classified by Hughes 
and Ingold as SN1 or SN2 according to whether the rate-determining elementary step 
is unimolecular or bimolecular. They adopted similar terminology for elimination reac￾tions via the labels E1 and E2 standing for elimination unimolecular and elimination 
bimolecular, respectively.
The dehydration of alcohols resembles the reaction of alcohols with hydrogen 
halides (Section 5.7) in two important ways:
1. Both reactions are promoted by acids.
2. The relative reactivity of alcohols increases in the order primary < secondary < 
tertiary.
These common features suggest that carbocations are key intermediates in alcohol dehydra￾tions, just as they are in the reaction of alcohols with hydrogen halides. Mechanism 7.1 
portrays a three-step process for the acid-catalyzed dehydration of tert-butyl alcohol. 
Steps 1 and 2 describe the generation of tert-butyl cation by a process similar to that 
which led to its formation as an intermediate in the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with 
hydrogen chloride.
Like the reaction of tert-butyl alcohol with hydrogen chloride, step 2 in which tert￾butyloxonium ion dissociates to (CH3)3C+ and water, is rate-determining. Because the 
rate-determining step is unimolecular, the overall dehydration process is referred to as a 
unimolecular elimination and given the symbol E1.
Step 3 is an acid–base reaction in which the carbocation acts as a Brønsted 
acid, transferring a proton to a Brønsted base (water). This is the property of carbo￾cations that is of the most significance to elimination reactions. Carbocations are 
strong acids; they are the conjugate acids of alkenes and readily lose a proton to 
form alkenes. Even weak bases such as water are sufficiently basic to abstract a 
proton from a carbocation.
Step 3 in Mechanism 7.1 shows water 
as the base that abstracts a proton 
from the carbocation. Other Brønsted 
bases present in the reaction mixture 
that can function in the same way 
include tert-butyl alcohol and 
hydrogen sulfate ion.262 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions

As noted earlier (Section 5.9), primary carbocations are too high in energy to be 
intermediates in most chemical reactions. If primary alcohols don’t form primary carbo￾cations, then how do they undergo elimination? A modification of our general mechanism 
for alcohol dehydration offers a reasonable explanation. For primary alcohols it is believed 
that a proton is lost from the alkyloxonium ion in the same step in which carbon–oxygen 
bond cleavage takes place. For example, the rate-determining step in the sulfuric acid–
catalyzed dehydration of ethanol may be represented as:

Because the rate-determining step involves two molecules—the alkyloxonium ion and 
water—the overall reaction is classified as a bimolecular elimination and given the 
symbol E2.
Like tertiary alcohols, secondary alcohols normally undergo dehydration by way of 
carbocation intermediates.
Chapters 5 and 6 introduced carbocations as intermediates in SN1 reactions and 
showed that a less stable carbocation could rearrange to a more stable one prior to react￾ing with a nucleophile. In the present chapter, we’ve seen that a carbocation can lose a 
proton to form an alkene according to an E1 mechanism. Section 7.13 describes how 
carbocation rearrangements affect the outcome of E1 reactions in a manner similar to 
that of their SN1 relatives.
7.13 Rearrangements in Alcohol Dehydration
Some alcohols undergo dehydration to yield alkenes having carbon skeletons different 
from the starting alcohols. In the example shown, only the least abundant of the three 
alkenes in the isolated product has the same carbon skeleton as the original alcohol. A 
rearrangement of the carbon skeleton has occurred during the formation of the two 
most abundant alkenes.

The generally accepted explanation for this rearrangement is outlined in Mechanism 7.2. 
It extends the E1 mechanism for acid-catalyzed alcohol dehydration by combining it with 
the tendency of carbocation intermediates to rearrange. Not only can a carbocation give 
an alkene by deprotonation, it can also rearrange to a more stable carbocation that 
becomes the source of the constitutionally isomeric alkenes.

THE MECHANISM:
Steps 1 and 2: These are analogous to the first two steps in the acid-catalyzed dehydration of tert-butyl alcohol

to a carbocation and water.

Steps 3 and 3′: The carbocation formed in step 2 can do two things. It can give an alkene by transferring a proton to a 
Brønsted base such as water present in the reaction mixture (step 3), or it can rearrange (step 3′). Because alkenes 
with a rearranged carbon skeleton predominate in the product, we conclude that step 3′ is faster than step 3.

Hydride shifts often occur during the dehydration of primary alcohols. Thus, although

butyloxonium ion is removed while a water molecule departs from C-1 (step 2). The cis 
and trans stereoisomers of 2-butene, however, are formed from the secondary carbocation 
that arises via a hydride shift from C-3 to C-2, which accompanies loss of water from 
the oxonium ion (step 2′).

7.13 Rearrangements in Alcohol Dehydration 265266 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
This concludes discussion of our second functional-group transformation involving 
alcohols: the first was the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides (Chapter 5), and the 
second the conversion of alcohols to alkenes. In the remaining sections of the chapter 
the conversion of alkyl halides to alkenes by dehydrohalogenation is described.
7.14 Dehydrohalogenation of Alkyl Halides
Dehydrohalogenation is the loss of a hydrogen and a halogen from an alkyl halide. It 
is one of the most useful methods for preparing alkenes by β elimination. When applied 
to the preparation of alkenes, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong base, 
such as sodium ethoxide.

Similarly, sodium methoxide (NaOCH3) is a suitable base and is used in methyl alcohol. 
Potassium hydroxide in ethyl alcohol is another base–solvent combination often employed 
in the dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides. Potassium tert-butoxide [KOC(CH3)3] is the 
preferred base when the alkyl halide is primary; it is used in either tert-butyl alcohol or 
dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent.

When using smaller bases like hydroxide, methoxide, and ethoxide, the regioselec￾tivity of dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides follows the Zaitsev rule; β elimination

In addition to being regioselective, dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides is stereo￾selective and favors formation of the more stable stereoisomer. Usually, as in the case of

when the ring has fewer than ten carbons. As the ring becomes larger, it can accom￾modate either a cis or a trans double bond, and large-ring cycloalkyl halides give mix￾tures of cis and trans cycloalkenes.

7.15 The E2 Mechanism of Dehydrohalogenation 
of Alkyl Halides
We have seen that nucleophilic substitution mechanisms were classified by Hughes and 
Ingold as SN1 or SN2 according to whether the rate-determining elementary step is 
unimolecular or bimolecular. They adopted similar terminology for elimination reactions 
via the labels E1 and E2 standing for elimination unimolecular and elimination 
bimolecular. The next several sections focus on eliminations that follow the E2 mech￾anism because these are the ones with the greater synthetic application. Only rarely 
does a synthetic plan rest on carrying out an elimination under conditions that favor E1.
Like SN2, E2 is a one-step mechanism. The equation for the general reaction, when 
supplemented by curved arrows to show the electron flow, also describes the mechanism.

Kinetic studies show that the rate of elimination of an alkyl halide on treatment with a 
strong base is directly proportional to the concentration of both the base and the alkyl 
halide.
Rate = k[Alkyl halide][Base]
The rate constant k (Section 5.10) depends on the alkyl halide and the base among 
other experimental variables (temperature, solvent, etc.). The larger the rate constant, the 
more reactive the alkyl halide. The value of k for the formation of cyclohexene from 
cyclohexyl bromide and sodium ethoxide, for example, is over 60 times larger than that 
of cyclohexyl chloride. Among the halogens, iodide is the best leaving group in dehy￾drohalogenation, fluoride the poorest. Fluoride is such a poor leaving group that alkyl 
fluorides are rarely used to prepare alkenes.
Reactivity depends on the halide leaving group
RF < RCl < RBr < RI
Slowest rate of elimination
Strongest C−X bond

This trend in leaving-group behavior correlates with certain other properties, such 
as decreasing carbon–halogen bond strength and decreasing basicity of the halide leaving 
group. Among the alkyl halides, the C—I bond is the weakest, C—F the strongest. 
Among halide ions, I− is the weakest base, F− the strongest.
For leaving-group effects in 
nucleophilic substitution, see 
Section 6.2.7.15 The E2 Mechanism of Dehydrohalogenation of Alkyl Halides 269
Problem 7.23
A study of the hydrolysis behavior of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) carried out by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency found that 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane (ClF2CCHClF) 
underwent dehydrohalogenation on treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide. Suggest a 
reasonable structure for the product of this reaction.
Four key elements
1. Base---H bond making
2. C---H bond breaking
3. C---C π bond development
4. C---X bond breaking
all contribute to the structure of the transition state.
Mechanism 7.4 shows the E2 mechanism for the reaction of 1-chlorooctadecane 
with potassium tert-butoxide presented in the preceding section. The bimolecular transi￾tion state is characterized by partial bonds between tert-butoxide and one of the hydro￾gens at C-2 of 2-chlorooctadecane, a partial double bond between C-1 and C-2, and a 
partial bond between C-1 and chlorine. Figure 7.4 is a potential energy diagram for a 
simpler reaction (ethyl chloride + hydroxide ion) that also illustrates the orbital interac￾tions involved.

With hindered bases, reactions with hydrogens on more substituted carbons, such 
as secondary versus primary, are slower. This is due to steric hindrance, which raises the

The two regioisomeric alkenes formed via the E2 transition state of the tertiary 
halide 2-bromo-2-methylbutane are both more substituted than the alkenes (ethylene and 
propene) formed from ethyl and isopropyl bromide, respectively.
The E2 mechanism is followed whenever an alkyl halide—be it primary, secondary, 
or tertiary—undergoes elimination in the presence of a strong base. If a strong base is 
absent, or present in very low concentration, elimination can sometimes still occur by a 
unimolecular mechanism (E1). The E1 mechanism for dehydrohalogenation will be 
described in Section 7.18.
7.16 Anti Elimination in E2 Reactions: Stereoelectronic Effects
Further insight into the E2 mechanism comes from stereochemical studies. One such 
experiment compares the rates of elimination of the cis and trans isomers of 4-tert￾butylcyclohexyl bromide.272 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions

Although both stereoisomers yield 4-tert-butylcyclohexene as the only alkene, they do 
so at quite different rates. The cis isomer reacts over 500 times faster than the trans.
The difference in reaction rate results from different degrees of π bond development 
in the E2 transition state. Since π overlap of p orbitals requires their axes to be parallel, 
π bond formation is best achieved when the four atoms of the HCCX unit lie in 
the same plane at the transition state. The two conformations that permit this are termed 
syn coplanar and anti coplanar.
Gauche
Staggered conformation
C H and C X bonds not aligned

Because adjacent bonds are eclipsed when the HCCX unit is syn coplanar, a 
transition state with this geometry is less stable than one that has an anti coplanar rela￾tionship between the proton and the leaving group.
Bromine is axial and anti coplanar to two axial hydrogens in the most stable con￾formation of cis-4-tert-butylcyclohexyl bromide and has the proper geometry for ready 
E2 elimination. The transition state is reached with little increase in strain, and elimina￾tion occurs readily.

A B7.17 Isotope Effects and the E2 Mechanism 273
Effects on rate or equilibrium that arise because one spatial arrangement of elec￾trons (or orbitals or bonds) is more stable than another are called stereoelectronic effects.
We saw an important example of a stereoelectronic requirement in the SN2 mechanism 
of nucleophilic substitution (Section 6.3) where the incoming nucleophile bonds to 
carbon at the transition state from the side opposite the bond to the leaving group. Like￾wise, there is a stereoelectronic preference for the anti coplanar arrangement of proton 
and leaving group in elimination by the E2 mechanism. Just as inversion of configuration 
characterizes the SN2 mechanism, anti elimination characterizes the E2 mechanism. 
Although coplanarity of the p orbitals is the best geometry for the E2 process, modest 
deviations from it can be tolerated at the cost of a decrease in reaction rate.
The stereoelectronic preference for an anti coplanar arrangement of the HCCX 
unit in the E2 mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 7.4, is also reflected in the preference 
for formation of trans rather than cis alkenes.

Not only is this conformation less populated than the other, but van der Waals repulsions 
between the CH3 and CH3CH2CH2 groups increase in going to the transition state, which 
raises the energy of the activated complex, increases Ea, and decreases the reaction rate.
The preferential formation of trans-2-hexene from 2-bromohexane is an example 
of a stereoselective reaction, a reaction that can give two or more stereoisomeric prod￾ucts but gives one of them preferentially (Section 7.11). Stereospecific reactions are 
those in which stereoisomeric reactants yield products that are stereoisomers of each 
other. Terms such as “addition to the less-hindered side” describe stereoselectivity; 
“inversion of configuration” and “anti-elimination” describe stereospecificity.
7.17 Isotope Effects and the E2 Mechanism
The E2 mechanism as outlined in the preceding two sections receives support from studies 
of the rates of dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides that contain deuterium (D = 2
H) instead 
of protium (1
H) at the β carbon. The fundamental kinds of reactions a substance undergoes 
are the same regardless of which isotope is present, but the reaction rates can be different.
A CD bond is ≈ 12 kJ/mol (2.9 kcal/mol) stronger than a CH bond, making 
the activation energy for breaking a CD bond slightly greater than that of an analogous 
CH bond. Consequently, the rate constant k for an elementary step in which a CD 
bond breaks is smaller than for a CH bond. This difference in rate is expressed as a 
ratio of the respective rate constants (kH/kD) and is a type of kinetic isotope effect.
Because it compares 2
H to 1
H, it is also referred to as a deuterium isotope effect.
Typical deuterium isotope effects for reactions in which CH bond breaking is 
rate-determining lie in the range kH/kD = 3–8. If the CH bond breaks after the 274 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
rate-determining step, the overall reaction rate is affected only slightly and kH/kD = 1–2. 
Thus, measuring the deuterium isotope effect can tell us if a CH bond breaks in the 
rate-determining step.
According to the E2 mechanism for dehydrohalogenation, a base removes a proton 
from the β carbon in the same step as the halide is lost. This step, indeed it is the only 
step in the mechanism, is rate-determining. Therefore, elimination by the E2 mechanism 
should exhibit a deuterium isotope effect. This prediction was tested by comparing the 
rate of elimination in the reaction:

H
CD3

with that of (CH3)2CHBr. The measured value was kH/kD = 6.7, consistent with the idea 
that the β hydrogen is removed by the base in the rate-determining step, not after it.
Problem 7.27

Sample Solution (a) A double bond is formed between C-1 and C-2 when either of the two 
compounds undergoes elimination. Bromine is lost from C-1, and H (or D) is lost from C-2. 
A CH bond breaks faster than a CD bond; therefore, E2 elimination is faster in 
CH3CH2CH2CD2Br than in CH3CH2CD2CH2Br.
The size of an isotope effect depends on the ratio of the atomic masses of the 
isotopes; thus, those that result from replacing 1
H by 2
H or 3
H (tritium) are easiest to 
measure. This, plus the additional facts that most organic compounds contain hydrogen 
and many reactions involve breaking CH bonds, have made rate studies involving 
hydrogen isotopes much more common than those of other elements.
In later chapters we’ll see several additional examples of reactions in which deu￾terium isotope effects were measured in order to test proposed mechanisms.
7.18 The E1 Mechanism of Dehydrohalogenation 
of Alkyl Halides
The E2 mechanism is a concerted process in which the carbon–hydrogen and carbon–
halogen bonds both break in the same elementary step. What if these bonds break in 
separate steps?
One possibility is the two-step process of Mechanism 7.5, in which the carbon–
halogen bond breaks first to give a carbocation intermediate, followed by deprotonation 
of the carbocation in a second step.
The alkyl halide, in this case 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, ionizes to a carbocation and a 
halide anion by a heterolytic cleavage of the carbon–halogen bond. Like the dissociation of an 
alkyloxonium ion to a carbocation, this step is rate-determining. Because the rate-determining 
step is unimolecular—it involves only the alkyl halide and not the base—it is an E1 mechanism.
(b)
(c)7.18 The E1 Mechanism of Dehydrohalogenation of Alkyl Halides 275
Typically, elimination by the E1 mechanism is observed only for tertiary and some 
secondary alkyl halides, and then only when the base is weak or in low concentration. 
Unlike eliminations that follow an E2 pathway and exhibit second-order kinetic behavior:
Rate = k[alkyl halide][base]
those that follow an E1 mechanism obey a first-order rate law.
Rate = k[alkyl halide]
The reactivity order parallels the ease of carbocation formation.

Because the carbon–halogen bond breaks in the slow step, the rate of the reaction depends 
on the leaving group. Alkyl iodides have the weakest carbon–halogen bond and are the 
most reactive; alkyl fluorides have the strongest carbon–halogen bond and are the least 
reactive.
Problem 7.28
Based on the E1 mechanism shown for it in Mechanism 7.5, would you expect elimination in 
2-bromo-2-methylbutane to exhibit a deuterium isotope effect?
The most common examples of E1 eliminations are those carried out in the absence 
of added base. In the example cited in Mechanism 7.5, the base that abstracts the proton 
from the carbocation intermediate is a very weak one; it is a molecule of the solvent, 
ethyl alcohol. At even modest concentrations of strong base, elimination by the E2 mech￾anism is much faster than E1 elimination.
There is a strong similarity between the process shown in Mechanism 7.5 and the 
one shown for alcohol dehydration in Mechanism 7.1. The main difference between the 
dehydration of 2-methyl-2-butanol and the dehydrohalogenation of 2-bromo-2-methylbutane 
is the source of the carbocation. With alcohols, it is the corresponding alkyloxonium ion 
that dissociates to form the carbocation. Alkyl halides ionize directly to the carbocation.

Alkyloxonium ion Carbocation Alkyl halide
Like alcohol dehydrations, E1 reactions of alkyl halides can be accompanied by 
carbocation rearrangements. Eliminations by the E2 mechanism, on the other hand, nor￾mally proceed without rearrangement. Consequently, if one wishes to prepare an alkene 
from an alkyl halide, conditions favorable to E2 elimination should be chosen. In practice 
this simply means carrying out the reaction in the presence of a strong base.

In this and the preceding chapter we have seen that a Lewis base can react with an alkyl 
halide by either substitution or elimination.

Substitution can take place by the SN1 or the SN2 mechanism, elimination by E1 or E2.
How can we predict whether substitution or elimination will predominate? The two 
most important factors are the structure of the alkyl halide and the basicity of the anion. 
It is useful to approach the question from the premise that the characteristic reaction of 
alkyl halides with Lewis bases is elimination, and that substitution predominates only under 
certain special circumstances. In a typical reaction, a secondary alkyl halide such as iso￾propyl bromide reacts with a Lewis base such as sodium ethoxide mainly by elimination:

Figure 7.5 illustrates the close relationship between the E2 and SN2 pathways for 
this case, and the results cited in the preceding equation show that E2 is faster than SN2 
when a secondary alkyl halide reacts with a strong base.
As crowding at the carbon that bears the leaving group decreases, the rate of 
nucleophilic substitution becomes faster than the rate of elimination. A low level of 
steric hindrance to approach of the nucleophile is one of the special circumstances that 
permit substitution to predominate, and primary alkyl halides react with alkoxide bases 
by an SN2 mechanism in preference to E2.

If, however, the base itself is crowded, such as potassium tert-butoxide, even primary 
alkyl halides undergo elimination rather than substitution (87%).

A second factor that can tip the balance in favor of substitution is weak basicity of the 
nucleophile. Nucleophiles that are less basic than hydroxide react with both primary and 
secondary alkyl halides to give the product of nucleophilic substitution in high yield. To 
illustrate, cyanide ion is much less basic than hydroxide and reacts with 2-chlorooctane 
to give the corresponding alkyl cyanide as the major product.

pKa of 4.6, and so is similar to acetic 
acid in its acidity.

Figure 7.5
When a Lewis base reacts with an alkyl halide, either substitution or elimination can occur. Substitution 
(SN2) occurs when the Lewis base acts as a nucleophile and attacks carbon to displace bromide. 
Elimination (E2) occurs when the Lewis base abstracts a proton from the β carbon. The alkyl halide shown 
is isopropyl bromide, and elimination (E2) predominates over substitution with alkoxide bases.278 Chapter 7 Structure and Preparation of Alkenes: Elimination Reactions
Hydrogen sulfide ion HS−, and anions of the type RS−, are substantially less basic 
than hydroxide ion and react with both primary and secondary alkyl halides to give 
mainly substitution products.
Tertiary alkyl halides are so sterically hindered to nucleophilic attack that the pres￾ence of any anionic Lewis base favors elimination. Usually substitution predominates 
over elimination in tertiary alkyl halides only when anionic Lewis bases are absent. In 
the solvolysis of the tertiary bromide 2-bromo-2-methylbutane, for example, the ratio of 
substitution to elimination is 64:36 in pure ethanol but falls to 1:99 in the presence of 
2 M sodium ethoxide.

The substitution product in this case is formed by an SN1 mechanism in both the presence 
and absence of sodium ethoxide. The alkenes are formed by an E1 mechanism in the absence 
of sodium ethoxide and by a combination of E2 (major) and E1 (minor) in its presence.

Regardless of the alkyl halide, raising the temperature increases the rate of both 
substitution and elimination. The rate of elimination, however, usually increases faster 
than substitution, so that at higher temperatures the proportion of elimination products 
increases at the expense of substitution products.
As a practical matter, if an anti coplanar arrangement of a proton and a suitable 
leaving group is structurally accessible, elimination can always be made to occur quan￾titatively. Strong bases, especially bulky ones such as tert-butoxide ion, react even with 
primary alkyl halides by an E2 process at elevated temperatures. The more difficult task 
is to find conditions that promote substitution. In general, the best approach is to choose 
conditions that favor the SN2 mechanism—an unhindered substrate, a good nucleophile 
that is not strongly basic, and the lowest practical temperature consistent with reasonable 
reaction rates.

Functional-group transformations that rely on substitution by the SN1 mechanism 
are not as generally applicable as those of the SN2 type. Hindered substrates are prone 
to elimination, and rearrangement is possible when carbocations are involved. Only in 
cases in which elimination is impossible are SN1 reactions used in functional-group 
transformations.

Section 7.1 Alkenes and cycloalkenes contain carbon–carbon double bonds. According to 
IUPAC nomenclature, alkenes are named by substituting -ene for the -ane suffix 
of the alkane that has the same number of carbon atoms as the longest continuous 
chain that includes the double bond. The chain is numbered in the direction 
that gives the lower number to the first-appearing carbon of the double bond. 
The double bond takes precedence over alkyl groups and halogens in dictating 
the direction of numbering, but is outranked by a hydroxyl group.

Section 7.2 Bonding in alkenes is described according to an sp2
 orbital hybridization model. 
The double bond unites two sp2
-hybridized carbon atoms and is made of a σ 
component and a π component. The σ bond arises by overlap of an sp2
 hybrid 
orbital on each carbon. The π bond is weaker than the σ bond and results from 
a side-by-side overlap of half-filled p orbitals. By combining two 2p orbitals, 
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (LUMO) are formed.
Sections 7.3 Isomeric alkenes may be either constitutional isomers or stereoisomers. There 
is a sizable barrier to rotation about a carbon–carbon double bond, which 
corresponds to the energy required to break the π component of the double 
bond. Stereoisomeric alkenes do not interconvert under normal conditions. Their 
configurations are described according to two notational systems. One system 
adds the prefix cis- to the name of the alkene when similar substituents are on 
the same side of the double bond and the prefix trans- when they are on 
opposite sides. The other ranks substituents according to a system of rules 
based on atomic number. The prefix Z is used for alkenes that have higher 
ranked substituents on the same side of the double bond; the prefix E is used 
when higher ranked substituents are on opposite sides.

Section 7.5 Alkenes are nonpolar. Alkyl substituents donate electrons to an sp2
-hybridized 
carbon to which they are attached slightly better than hydrogen does.
Section 7.6 Electron release from alkyl substituents stabilizes a double bond. In general, the 
order of alkene stability is:
1. Tetrasubstituted alkenes (R2CCR2) are the most stable.
2. Trisubstituted alkenes (R2CCHR) are next.
3. Among disubstituted alkenes, trans-RCHCHR is normally more stable 
than cis-RCHCHR. Exceptions are cycloalkenes, cis cycloalkenes being 
more stable than trans when the ring contains fewer than 12 carbons.
4. Monosubstituted alkenes (RCHCH2) have a more stabilized double bond 
than ethylene (unsubstituted) but are less stable than disubstituted alkenes.
and 7.4
7.21 SUMMARY7.21 Summary 281
The greater stability of more highly substituted double bonds is an example of 
an electronic effect. The decreased stability that results from van der Waals 
strain between cis substituents is an example of a steric effect.
Section 7.7 Cycloalkenes that have trans double bonds in rings smaller than 12 members are 
less stable than their cis stereoisomers. trans-Cyclooctene can be isolated and 
stored at room temperature, but trans-cycloheptene is not stable above −30°C.

Section 7.8 Alkenes are prepared by β elimination of alcohols and alkyl halides. These 
reactions are summarized with examples in Table 7.1. In both cases, β 
elimination proceeds in the direction that yields the more highly substituted 
double bond (Zaitsev’s rule).

Primary alcohols do not dehydrate as readily as secondary or tertiary alcohols, 
and their dehydration does not involve a primary carbocation. A proton is lost 
from the β carbon in the same step in which carbon–oxygen bond cleavage 
occurs. The mechanism is E2.
Section 7.13 Alkene synthesis via alcohol dehydration is sometimes accompanied by 
carbocation rearrangement. A less stable carbocation can rearrange to a more 
stable one by an alkyl group migration or by a hydride shift, opening the 
possibility for alkene formation from two different carbocations.

Section 7.16 The preceding equation shows the proton H and the halogen X in the anti 
coplanar relationship that is required for elimination by the E2 mechanism.
Section 7.17 A β CD bond is broken more slowly in the E2 dehydrohalogenation of alkyl 
halides than a β CH bond. The ratio of the rate constants kH/kD is a measure 
of the deuterium isotope effect and has a value in the range 3–8 when a 
carbon–hydrogen bond breaks in the rate-determining step of a reaction.
TABLE 7.1 Preparation of Alkenes by Elimination Reactions of Alcohols and Alkyl Halides
Reaction (section) and comments General equation and specific example
Dehydration of alcohols (Sections 7.9–7.13)
Dehydration requires an acid catalyst; the 
order of reactivity of alcohols is tertiary 
> secondary > primary. Elimination is 
regioselective and proceeds in the direction 
that gives the most highly substituted double 
bond. When stereoisomeric alkenes are 
possible, the more stable one is formed in 
greater amounts. An E1 (elimination 
unimolecular) mechanism via a carbocation 
intermediate is followed with secondary and 
tertiary alcohols. Primary alcohols react by an 
E2 (elimination bimolecular) mechanism. 
Sometimes elimination is accompanied by 
rearrangement.

(Sections 7.14–7.16) Strong bases cause a

carbons of an alkyl halide to yield an alkene. 
When using small strong bases, regioselectivity 
is in accord with the Zaitsev rule. When using 
sterically hindered strong bases, like tert￾butoxide, Hofmann elimination is observed.

Section 7.19 The competition between substitution and elimination is influenced by the 
structure of the substrate (alkyl halide or sulfonate) and the size and basicity of 
the nucleophile/base. Unhindered substrates react with good nucleophiles that 
are not strongly basic by the SN2 mechanism. Elimination is normally favored 
in the reactions of secondary or tertiary substrates with strong bases, or even 
primary substrates with strong, bulky bases.
Section 7.20 Alkyl sulfonates undergo elimination reactions under the same conditions as 
alkyl halides with similar outcomes.

Addition Reactions of Alkenes
Now that we’re familiar with the structure and preparation of 
alkenes, let’s look at their chemical reactions, the most charac￾teristic of which is addition to the double bond according to 
the general equation:
A B + C C A C C B
The range of compounds represented as A–B in this equation 
offers a wealth of opportunity for converting alkenes to a num￾ber of other structural types.
Alkenes are commonly described as unsaturated hydro￾carbons because they have the capacity to react with substances 
that add to them. Alkanes, on the other hand, are saturated hydro￾carbons and are incapable of undergoing addition reactions.
8.1 Hydrogenation of Alkenes
The relationship between reactants and products in addition 
reactions can be illustrated by the hydrogenation of alkenes to 
yield alkanes. Hydrogenation is the addition of H2 to a multiple 
bond, as illustrated in the conversion of ethylene to ethane.
Petroleum-derived benzene is the source of the six carbon atoms of 
adipic acid, an industrial chemical used to make nylon. An alternative 
process has been developed that uses genetically engineered strains of 
the bacterium Escherichia coli to convert glucose, a renewable resource 
obtained from cornstarch, to cis,cis-muconic acid. Subsequent 
hydrogenation gives adipic acid. This chapter is about reactions that 
involve addition to double bonds and begins with hydrogenation.

Hydrogenation of all alkenes is exothermic, so is characterized by a negative sign for 
ΔH°. The heat given off is called the heat of hydrogenation and cited without a sign. 
In other words, heat of hydrogenation = −ΔH°.
The uncatalyzed addition of hydrogen to an alkene, although exothermic, is too 
slow to ever occur, but is readily accomplished in the presence of certain finely divided 
metal catalysts, such as platinum, palladium, nickel, and rhodium. Catalytic hydrogena￾tion is normally rapid at room temperature, and the alkane is the only product.

Problem 8.1
What three alkenes yield 2-methylbutane on catalytic hydrogenation?
The solvent used in catalytic hydrogenation is chosen for its ability to dissolve the 
alkene and is typically ethanol, hexane, or acetic acid. The metal catalysts are insoluble 
in these solvents (or, indeed, in any solvent). Two phases, the solution and the metal, are 
present, and the reaction takes place at the interface between them. Reactions involving 
a substance in one phase with a different substance in a second phase are called hetero￾geneous reactions. A number of organometallic compounds have been developed for 
catalytic hydrogenation under homogeneous conditions and are described in Chapter 15.
Catalytic hydrogenation of an alkene is believed to proceed by the series of steps 
shown in Mechanism 8.1. The addition of hydrogen to the alkene is very slow in the 
absence of a metal catalyst, meaning that any uncatalyzed mechanism must have a very 
high activation energy. The metal catalyst accelerates the rate of hydrogenation by provid￾ing an alternative pathway that involves a sequence of several low activation energy steps.
8.2 Stereochemistry of Alkene Hydrogenation
Two stereochemical aspects—stereospecificity and stereoselectivity—attend catalytic 
hydrogenation. Recall that a stereospecific reaction is one in which stereoisomeric start￾ing materials give stereoisomeric products. Previous examples were the requirement of 
inversion of configuration in substitution by the SN2 mechanism (Section 6.3) and an 
anti relationship between the proton lost and the leaving group in elimination by the E2 
mechanism (Section 7.16). Catalytic hydrogenation is a stereospecific syn addition; both 
hydrogens add to the same face of the double bond. Its counterpart—anti addition—
would be characterized by addition to opposite faces of a double bond.
syn
addition
anti
addition
The French chemist Paul Sabatier 
received the 1912 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for the discovery that 
finely divided nickel is an effective 
hydrogenation catalyst.
Elimination reactions that proceed 
by the E2 mechanism (see Sections 
7.15 and 7.16) are stereospecific in 
that they require an anti relationship 
between the proton and leaving group.292 Chapter 8 Addition Reactions of Alkenes
Mechanism 8.1
Hydrogenation of Alkenes
Step 1: Hydrogen molecules react with 
metal atoms at the catalyst surface. The 
relatively strong hydrogen–hydrogen σ 
bond is broken and replaced by two weak 
metal–hydrogen bonds.
Step 2: The alkene reacts with the metal 
catalyst. The π component of the double 
bond between the two carbons is replaced 
by two relatively weak carbon–metal 
σ bonds.
Step 3: A hydrogen atom is transferred 
from the catalyst surface to one of the 
carbons of the double bond.
Step 4: The second hydrogen atom is 
transferred, forming the alkane. The sites 
on the catalyst surface at which the reac￾tion occurred are free to accept additional 
hydrogen and alkene molecules.
Experimental support for syn addition can be found in the hydrogenation of the 
cyclohexene derivative shown where the product of syn addition is formed exclusively, 
even though it is the less stable stereoisomer.

Product of anti addition
(not formed)
Unlike catalytic hydrogenation, not all additions to alkenes are syn. As we proceed 
in this chapter, we’ll see some that take place by anti addition, and others that are not 
stereospecific. Identifying the stereochemical course of a reaction is an important element 
in proposing a mechanism.
The second stereochemical aspect of alkene hydrogenation concerns its stereoselec￾tivity. A stereoselective reaction is one in which a single starting material can give two 
or more stereoisomeric products but yields one of them in greater amounts than the other 
(or even to the exclusion of the other). Recall from Section 7.11 that the acid-catalyzed 8.3 Heats of Hydrogenation 293
dehydration of alcohols is stereoselective in that it favors the formation of the more 
stable stereochemistry of the alkene double bond. In catalytic hydrogenation, stereo￾selectivity is associated with a different factor—the direction from which hydrogen atoms 
are transferred from the catalyst to the double bond. In the example shown:

H
CH3
H2C
CH3
H
H
CH3
trans-1,2-Dimethyl￾cyclohexane (32%)
H
H3C
the major product is the cis stereoisomer of the product. The reason for this is that the 
face of the double bond that is opposite the C-2 methyl group in the alkene is less hin￾dered and better able to contact the catalyst surface. Therefore, hydrogen is transferred 
predominantly to that face. We customarily describe the stereochemistry of alkene hydro￾genation as proceeding by syn addition of hydrogen to the less hindered face of the 
double bond. Reactions that discriminate between nonequivalent sides or faces of a reac￾tant are common in organic chemistry and are examples of steric effects on reactivity.
Previously we saw steric effects on stability in the case of cis and trans stereoisomers of 
substituted cycloalkanes (Sections 3.11 and 3.12) and alkenes (Sections 7.6 and 7.7).

Could the amounts of stereoisomeric 1,2-dimethylcyclohexanes formed in the preceding 
equation reflect their relative stabilities?

8.3 Heats of Hydrogenation
In much the same way as heats of combustion, heats of hydrogenation are used to com￾pare the relative stabilities of alkenes. Both methods measure the differences in the 
energy of isomers by converting them to a product or products common to all. Catalytic 
hydrogenation of 1-butene, cis-2-butene, or trans-2-butene yields the same product—
butane. As Figure 8.1 shows, the measured heats of hydrogenation reveal that trans￾2-butene is 4 kJ/mol (1.0 kcal/mol) lower in energy than cis-2-butene and that cis-2-butene 
is 7 kJ/mol (1.7 kcal/mol) lower in energy than 1-butene.
Heats of hydrogenation can be used to estimate the stability of double bonds as 
structural units, even in alkenes that are not isomers. Table 8.1 lists the heats of hydro￾genation for a representative collection of alkenes.
Remember that a catalyst affects the 
rate of a reaction but not the energy 
relationships between reactants 
and products. Thus, the heat of 
hydrogenation of a particular alkene 
is the same irrespective of what 
catalyst is used.294 Chapter 8 Addition Reactions of Alkenes

Increasing stability of the double bond
Ethylene, which has no alkyl substituents to stabilize its double bond, has the highest 
heat of hydrogenation. Alkenes that are similar in structure to one another have similar 
heats of hydrogenation. For example, the heats of hydrogenation of the monosubstituted 
alkenes propene, 1-butene, and 1-hexene are almost identical. Cis-disubstituted alkenes 
have lower heats of hydrogenation than monosubstituted alkenes but higher heats of 
hydrogenation than their more stable trans stereoisomers. Alkenes with trisubstituted 
double bonds have lower heats of hydrogenation than disubstituted alkenes, and tetrasub￾stituted alkenes have the lowest heats of hydrogenation.

The reaction is classified as an electrophilic addition, a term analogous to nucleophilic 
substitution where the first word characterizes the attacking reagent and the second describes 
what happens to the organic reactant. In general, an electrophile is a Lewis acid in that it acts 
as an electron-pair acceptor in a reaction based on the alkene acting as an electron-pair donor.
The electrostatic potential maps in Figure 8.2 illustrate the complementary dis￾tribution of charge in hydrogen chloride and ethylene. The proton of hydrogen chloride 
is positively polarized (electrophilic), and the region of greatest negative character in the 
alkene is where the π electrons are—above and below the plane of the bonds to the sp2
-
hybridized carbons. During the reaction, π electrons flow from the alkene toward the 
proton of the hydrogen halide. More highly substituted double bonds are more “electron￾rich” and react faster than less substituted ones.

Observations such as these prompted Vladimir Markovnikov, a colleague of Alexander 
Zaitsev at the University of Kazan (Russia), to offer a generalization in 1870. According 
to what is now known as Markovnikov’s rule, when an unsymmetrically substituted 
alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide, the hydrogen adds to the carbon that has the greater 
number of hydrogens, and the halogen adds to the carbon that has fewer hydrogens.
Problem 8.5
Use Markovnikov’s rule to predict the major organic product formed in the reaction of 
hydrogen chloride with each of the following:
(a) 2-Methyl-2-butene
(b) cis-2-Butene
(c) 2-Methyl-1-butene
(d) CH3CH
Sample Solution (a) Hydrogen chloride adds to the double bond of 2-methyl-2-butene in 
accordance with Markovnikov’s rule. The proton adds to the carbon that has one attached 
hydrogen, chlorine to the carbon that has none.

Like Zaitsev’s rule (Section 7.10), Markovnikov’s rule collects experimental 
observations into a form that allows us to predict the outcome of future experiments. 
Recall from Section 7.10 that a 
regioselective reaction is one that can 
produce two (or more) constitutional 
isomers from a single reactant, but 
gives one in greater amounts than the 
other. A regiospecific reaction is one 
that is 100% regioselective.To understand its basis we need to look at the mechanism by which these reactions 
take place.

THE MECHANISM:
Step 1: This is the rate-determining step and is bimolecular. Protonation of the 
double bond occurs in the direction that gives the more stable of two 
possible carbocations. In this case the carbocation is tertiary. Protonation 
of C-2 would have given a less stable secondary carbocation.

The first step is rate-determining protonation of the double bond by the hydrogen halide, 
forming a carbocation. The regioselectivity of addition is set in this step and is controlled

Figure 8.3 compares potential energy diagrams for these two competing modes of addi￾tion. According to Hammond’s postulate (Section 5.8), the transition state for protonation 
of the double bond resembles the carbocation more than the alkene, and Ea for formation 
of the more stable carbocation (tertiary) is less than that for formation of the less stable 
carbocation (primary). The major product is derived from the carbocation that is formed 
faster, and the energy difference between a primary and a tertiary carbocation is so great 
and their rates of formation so different that essentially all of the product is derived from 
the tertiary carbocation.
Problem 8.6
Give a structural formula for the carbocation intermediate that leads to the major product in 
each of the reactions of Problem 8.5.

to alkenes. What about stereoselectivity? Addition of hydrogen bromide to 1-butene, 
cis-2-butene, or trans-2-butene, all of which are achiral, yields the same chiral product, 
2-bromobutane. The product, however, is not optically active because it is racemic. It 
is composed of equal amounts of (R)- and (S)-2-bromobutane because both are formed 
at equal rates regardless of whether the starting alkene is 1-butene, cis-2-butene, or 
trans-2-butene.

The carbocation intermediate has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. It reacts with 
bromide ion with equal probability from either side to give a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and 
(S)-2-bromobutane (Figure 8.4). This reaction illustrates a general principle, that optically 
active products cannot be formed from an optically inactive starting material unless at 
least one optically active reactant, reagent, or catalyst is used. This principle holds 
regardless of the mechanism.
Rules, Laws, Theories, and the Scientific Method
As we have just seen, Markovnikov’s rule can be expressed 
in two ways:
1. When a hydrogen halide adds to an alkene, hydrogen 
adds to the carbon of the alkene that has the greater num￾ber of hydrogens attached to it, and the halogen to the 
carbon that has the fewer hydrogens.
2. When a hydrogen halide adds to an alkene, protonation of 
the double bond occurs in the direction that gives the 
more stable carbocation.
The first of these statements is close to the way Vladimir Mar￾kovnikov expressed it in 1870; the second is the way we usually 
phrase it now. These two statements differ in an important 
way—a way that is related to the scientific method.
Adherence to the scientific method is what defines sci￾ence. The scientific method has four major elements: observa￾tion, law, theory, and hypothesis.
Observation
Hypothesis Theory
Law
Most observations in chemistry come from experi￾ments. If we do enough experiments we may see a pattern 
running through our observations. A law is a mathematical 
(the law of gravity) or verbal (the law of diminishing returns) 
description of that pattern. Establishing a law can lead to the 
framing of a rule that lets us predict the results of future 
experiments. This is what the 1870 version of Markovnikov’s 
rule is: a statement based on experimental observations that 
has predictive value. The same can be said of Zaitsev’s rule 
for elimination reactions.
A theory is our best present interpretation of why things 
happen the way they do. The modern version of Markovnikov’s 
rule, which is based on mechanistic reasoning and carbocation 
stability, recasts the rule in terms of theoretical ideas. Mecha￾nisms, and explanations grounded in them, belong to the theory 
part of the scientific method.
It is worth remembering that a theory can never be proven 
correct. It can only be proven incorrect, incomplete, or inade￾quate. Thus, theories are always being tested and refined. As 
important as anything else in the scientific method is the test￾able hypothesis. Once a theory is proposed, experiments are 
designed to test its validity. If the results are consistent with the 
theory, our belief in its soundness is strengthened. If the results 
conflict with it, the theory is flawed and must be modified. Sec￾tion 8.5 describes some observations that support the theory 
that carbocations are intermediates in the addition of hydrogen 
halides to alkenes.

8.5 Carbocation Rearrangements in Hydrogen 
Halide Addition to Alkenes
Our belief that carbocations are intermediates in the addition of hydrogen halides to alkenes 
is strengthened by the fact that rearrangements of the kind seen in alcohol dehydrations 
(Section 7.13) sometimes occur. For example, the reaction of hydrogen chloride with 
3-methyl-1-butene is expected to produce 2-chloro-3-methylbutane. Instead, a mixture of 
2-chloro-3-methylbutane and 2-chloro-2-methylbutane results.

Mechanism 8.3 extends the general principles of electrophilic addition to acid￾catalyzed hydration. In the first step of the mechanism, proton transfer converts the 
alkene to a carbocation, which then reacts with a molecule of water in step 2. The 
alkyloxonium ion formed in this step is the conjugate acid of the ultimate alcohol and 
yields it in step 3 while regenerating the acid catalyst.

This mechanism cannot be correct! What is its fundamental flaw?
The notion that carbocation formation is rate-determining follows from our previous 
experience with reactions that involve carbocation intermediates and by observing how 
the reaction rate is affected by the structure of the alkene. Alkenes that yield more stable 
carbocations react faster than those that yield less stable ones.

reaction rate.

An important principle, called microscopic reversibility, connects the mechanisms of 
the forward and reverse reactions. It states that in any equilibrium, the sequence of inter￾mediates and transition states encountered as reactants proceed to products in one direc￾tion must also be encountered, and in precisely the reverse order, in the opposite direction.
Just as the reaction is reversible with respect to reactants and products, so too is each 
tiny increment of progress along the mechanistic pathway. Once we know the mechanism 
for the forward reaction, we also know the intermediates and transition states for its 
reverse. In particular, the three-step mechanism for the acid-catalyzed hydration of 
2-methylpropene shown in Mechanism 8.3 is the reverse of that for the acid-catalyzed 
dehydration of tert-butyl alcohol in Mechanism 7.1.
It would be a good idea to verify the 
statement in the last sentence of this 
paragraph by revisiting Mechanisms 
7.1 and 8.3.8.7 Thermodynamics of Addition–Elimination Equilibria 303
Problem 8.10
Is the electrophilic addition of hydrogen chloride to 2-methylpropene the reverse of the E1 or 
E2 elimination of tert-butyl chloride?
Reaction mechanisms help us understand the “how” of reversible reactions, but not 
the “how much.” To gain an appreciation for the factors that influence equilibria in addi￾tion reactions we need to expand on some ideas introduced when we discussed acid–base 
reactions in Chapter 1 and conformational equilibria in Chapter 3.
8.7 Thermodynamics of Addition–Elimination Equilibria
We have seen that both the forward and reverse reactions represented by the hydration–
dehydration equilibrium are useful synthetic methods.

Alkene Water Alcohol
H+
We can prepare alcohols from alkenes, and alkenes from alcohols, but how do we control 
the position of equilibrium so as to maximize the yield of the compound we want?
The qualitative reasoning expressed in Le Châtelier’s principle is a helpful guide: 
a system at equilibrium adjusts so as to minimize any stress applied to it. For hydration–
dehydration equilibria, the key stress factor is the water concentration. Adding water to 
a hydration–dehydration equilibrium mixture causes the system to respond by consuming 
water. More alkene is converted to alcohol, and the position of equilibrium shifts to the 
right. When we prepare an alcohol from an alkene, we use a reaction medium in which 
the molar concentration of water is high—dilute sulfuric acid, for example.
On the other hand, alkene formation is favored when the concentration of water is 
kept low. The system responds to the absence of water by causing more alcohol molecules 
to dehydrate, forming more alkene. The amount of water in the reaction mixture is kept 
low by using concentrated acids as catalysts. Distilling the reaction mixture is an effective 
way of removing water as it is formed, causing the equilibrium to shift to the left. If the 
alkene is low-boiling, it can also be removed by distillation. This offers the additional 
benefit of protecting the alkene from acid-catalyzed isomerization after it is formed.
Le Châtelier’s principle helps us predict qualitatively how an equilibrium will 
respond to changes in experimental conditions. For a quantitative understanding, we need 
to examine reactions from a thermodynamic perspective.
At constant temperature and pressure, the direction in which a reaction proceeds—
that is, the direction in which it is spontaneous—is the one that leads to a decrease in 
free energy (G):
ΔG = Gproducts − Greactants spontaneous when ΔG < 0
The free energy of the reactants and products depends on what they are and how much 
of each is present. Although G is always positive, ΔG can be positive or negative. If 
only the reactants are present at the beginning, Greactants has some value but Gproducts is 
zero; therefore, ΔG is negative and the reaction is spontaneous in the direction written. 
As the reaction proceeds, Greactants decreases while Gproducts increases until both are equal 
and ΔG = 0. At this point the system is at equilibrium. Both the forward and reverse 
reactions continue to take place, but at equal rates.
Because reactions are carried out under a variety of conditions, it is convenient to 
define a standard state for substances and experimental conditions. The standard state is 
the form (solid, liquid, or gas) assumed by the pure substance at 1 atm pressure. For 
substances in aqueous solution, the standard-state concentration is 1 M. Standard-state 
values are designated by a superscript ° following the thermodynamic symbol as in ΔG°.

Free energy is also called “Gibbs free 
energy.” The official term is Gibbs

the relationship between ΔG and ΔG° is
ΔG ΔG° + RT ln [C]c

[B] = b
where R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) or 1.99 cal/(mol·K) and T is the Kelvin temperature. At

[D]d
_______
[A]a
[B]b
 becomes the equilibrium constant K. Substituting these 
values in the preceding equation and rearranging, we get
ΔG° = −RT ln K
Reactions for which the sign of ΔG° is negative are exergonic; those for which ΔG° is 
positive are endergonic. Exergonic reactions have an equilibrium constant greater than 1; 
endergonic reactions have equilibrium constants less than 1.
Free energy has both an enthalpy (H) and an entropy (S) component.
G = H − TS
At constant temperature, ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
For the hydration of 2-methylpropene, the standard-state thermodynamic values are 
given beside the equation.
(CH3)2C CH2(g) (CH3)3COH(ℓ) ΔG° = −5.4 kJ/mol Exergonic

 (−12.6 kcal/mol)
ΔS° = −0.16 kJ/K·mol Entropy 
 (−0.038 kcal/K·mol) decreases
+ H2O(ℓ) 
The negative sign for ΔG° tells us the reaction is exergonic. From the relationship
ΔG° = −RT ln K
we can calculate the equilibrium constant at 25°C as K = 9.
Problem 8.11
You can calculate the equilibrium constant for the dehydration of (CH3)3COH (the reverse of 
the preceding reaction) by reversing the sign of ΔG° in the expression ΔG° = −RT ln K, but 
there is an easier way. Do you know what it is? What is K for the dehydration of (CH3)3COH?
The ΔH° term is dominated by bond strength. A negative sign for ΔH° almost 
always means that bonding is stronger in the products than in the reactants. Stronger 
bonding reduces the free energy of the products and contributes to a more negative ΔG°. 
Such is the normal case for addition reactions. Hydrogenation, hydration, and hydrogen 
halide additions to alkenes, for example, are all characterized by negative values for ΔH°.
The ΔS° term is a measure of the increase or decrease in the order of a system. A 
more ordered system has less entropy and is less probable than a disordered one. The main 
factors that influence ΔS° in a chemical reaction are the number of moles of material on 
each side of the balanced equation and their physical state. The liquid phase of a substance 
has more entropy (less order) than the solid, and the gas phase has much more entropy 
than the liquid. Entropy increases when more molecules are formed at the expense of fewer 
ones, as for example in elimination reactions. Conversely, addition reactions convert more 
molecules to fewer ones and are characterized by a negative sign for ΔS°.
The negative signs for both ΔH° and ΔS° in typical addition reactions of alkenes 
cause the competition between addition and elimination to be strongly temperature￾dependent. Addition is favored at low temperatures, elimination at high temperatures. 
The economically important hydrogenation–dehydrogenation equilibrium that connects 
ethylene and ethane illustrates this.
H2C CH2(g) C + H2(g) H3CH3(g)
Ethylene Hydrogen Ethane8.8 Hydroboration–Oxidation of Alkenes 305
Hydrogenation of ethylene converts two gas molecules on the left to one gas molecule 
on the right, leading to a decrease in entropy. The hydrogenation is sufficiently exother￾mic and ΔH° sufficiently negative, however, that the equilibrium lies far to the right over 
a relatively wide temperature range.
Very high temperatures—typically in excess of 750°C—reverse the equilibrium. At 
these temperatures, the −TΔS° term in
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
becomes so positive that it eventually overwhelms ΔH° in magnitude, and the equilibrium 
shifts to the left. In spite of the fact that dehydrogenation is very endothermic, billions 
of pounds of ethylene are produced from ethane each year by this process.
Problem 8.12
Does the presence or absence of a catalyst such as finely divided platinum, palladium, or

8.8 Hydroboration–Oxidation of Alkenes
Acid-catalyzed hydration converts alkenes to alcohols according to Markovnikov’s rule. 
Frequently, however, one needs an alcohol having a structure that corresponds to hydra￾tion of an alkene with a regioselectivity opposite to that of Markovnikov’s rule. The 
conversion of 1-decene to 1-decanol is an example.

The synthetic method used to accomplish this is an indirect one known as 
hydroboration–oxidation. Hydroboration is a reaction in which a boron hydride, a com￾pound of the type R2BH, adds to a carbon–carbon π bond. A carbon–hydrogen bond and 
a carbon–boron bond result.

Hydroboration–oxidation was 
developed by Professor Herbert C. 
Brown [Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
(1979)] as part of a broad program 
designed to apply boron-containing 
reagents to organic chemical 
synthesis.
With sodium hydroxide as the base, 
boron of the alkylborane is converted 
to the water-soluble and easily 
removed sodium salt of boric acid.306 Chapter 8 Addition Reactions of Alkenes
Hydroboration–oxidation leads to the overall hydration of an alkene. Notice, how￾ever, that water is not a reactant. The hydrogen that becomes bonded to carbon comes 
from the organoborane, and the hydroxyl group from hydrogen peroxide.
With this as introduction, let us now look at the individual steps in more detail for 
the case of hydroboration–oxidation of 1-decene. A boron hydride that is often used is 
diborane (B2H6). Diborane adds to 1-decene to give tridecylborane according to the 
balanced equation:
1-Decene
6CH3 CH2 (CH2)7CH
Diborane
B2H6
Tridecylborane
2[CH3(CH2)7CH2CH2] + 3B diglyme
There is a regioselective preference for boron to bond to the less substituted carbon of 
the double bond. Thus, the hydrogen atoms of diborane add to C-2 of 1-decene, and boron 
to C-1. Oxidation of tridecylborane gives 1-decanol. The net result is the conversion of 
an alkene to an alcohol with a regioselectivity opposite to that of acid-catalyzed hydration.

Hydroboration–oxidation of α-pinene, like its catalytic hydrogenation (Problem 8.3), is 
stereoselective. Addition takes place at the less hindered face of the double bond, and a 
single alcohol is produced in high yield (89%). Suggest a reasonable structure for this alcohol.
8.9 Mechanism of Hydroboration–Oxidation
The regioselectivity and syn stereospecificity of hydroboration–oxidation, coupled with 
a knowledge of the chemical properties of alkenes and boranes, contribute to our under￾standing of the reaction mechanism.
In order to simplify our presentation, we’ll regard the hydroborating agent as if 
it were borane (BH3) itself rather than B2H6 or the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex. 
BH3 is electrophilic; it has a vacant 2p orbital that interacts with the π electron pair 
of the alkene as shown in step 1 of Mechanism 8.4. The product of this step is an 
unstable intermediate called a π complex in which boron and the two carbons of the 
double bond are joined by a three-center, two-electron bond. Structures of this type 
in which boron and two other atoms share two electrons are frequently encountered 
in boron chemistry. Each of the two carbons of the π complex has a small positive 
charge, whereas boron is slightly negative. This negative character of boron assists 
one of its hydrogens to migrate with a pair of electrons (a hydride shift) from boron 
to carbon as shown in step 2, yielding a stable alkylborane. The carbon–boron bond 
and the carbon–hydrogen bond are formed on the same face of the alkene in a 
stereospecific syn addition.
Step 1 is consistent with the regioselectivity of hydroboration. Boron, with its 
attached substituents, is more sterically demanding than hydrogen, and bonds to the 
less crowded carbon of the double bond; hydrogen bonds to the more crowded one. 
Electronic effects are believed to be less important than steric ones, but point in the 
same direction. Hydrogen is transferred with a pair of electrons to the carbon atom 
that bears more of the positive charge in the π complex, namely, the one that bears 
the methyl group.
The oxidation stage (Mechanism 8.5) of hydroboration–oxidation begins with 
the formation of the conjugate base of hydrogen peroxide in step 1, followed by its 
bonding to boron in step 2. The resulting intermediate expels hydroxide with migra￾tion of the alkyl group from boron to oxygen in step 3. It is in this step that the 
critical CO bond is formed. The stereochemical orientation of this new bond is the 
same as that of the original CB bond, thereby maintaining the syn stereochemistry 
Borane (BH3) does not exist as such at 
room temperature and atmospheric 
pressure. Two molecules of BH3
combine to give diborane (B2H6), 
which is the more stable form.308 Chapter 8 Addition Reactions of Alkenes

of the hydroboration stage. Migration of the alkyl group from boron to oxygen occurs 
with retention of configuration at carbon. The alkoxyborane intermediate formed in 
step 3 undergoes subsequent base-promoted oxygen–boron bond cleavage in step 4 to 
give the alcohol product.
The mechanistic complexity of hydroboration–oxidation stands in contrast to the 
simplicity with which these reactions are carried out experimentally. Both the hydro￾boration and oxidation steps are extremely rapid and are performed at room tempera￾ture with conventional laboratory equipment. Ease of operation, along with the fact 
that hydroboration–oxidation leads to syn hydration of alkenes with a regioselectivity 
opposite to Markovnikov’s rule, makes this procedure one of great value to the 
synthetic chemist.Mechanism 8.5

8.10 Addition of Halogens to Alkenes
Halogens react rapidly with alkenes by electrophilic addition. The products are called 
vicinal dihalides, meaning that the halogen atoms are attached to adjacent carbons.

Addition of iodine is not as straightforward, and vicinal diiodides are less commonly

is violent, difficult to control, and accompanied by substitution of hydrogens by fluorine.
Chlorine and bromine react with cycloalkenes by stereospecific anti addition.

The crowded environment enclosing the three-membered ring prevents the next step in 
the mechanism and prevents formation of a vicinal dibromide.
The trend in relative rates as a function of alkene structure is consistent with a 
rate-determining step in which electrons flow from the alkene to the halogen.

Step 2: Bromide ion acts as a nucleophile, forming a bond to one of the carbons 
of the bromonium ion and displacing the positively charged bromine from 
that carbon. Because substitutions of this type normally occur with the 
nucleophile approaching carbon from the side opposite the bond that is 
broken, the two bromine atoms are trans to one another in the product.

Three stereoisomers are possible: a pair of enantiomers and a meso form.
Two factors combine to determine which stereoisomers are actually formed in the 
reaction:
1. The (E)- or (Z)-configuration of the starting alkene
2. The anti stereochemistry of addition
Figure 8.5 shows the stereochemical differences associated with anti addition of 
bromine to (E)- and (Z)-2-butene, respectively. The trans alkene (E)-2-butene yields only 
meso-2,3-dibromobutane, but the cis alkene (Z)-2-butene gives a racemic mixture of 
(2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)-2,3-dibromobutane.Bromine addition to alkenes is a stereospecific reaction, a reaction in which stereo￾isomeric starting materials yield products that are stereoisomers of each other. In this 
case the starting materials, in separate reactions, are the E and Z stereoisomers of 
2-butene. The chiral dibromides formed from (Z)-2-butene are stereoisomers (diastereomers) 
of the meso dibromide from (E)-2-butene.

nucleophilic attack of water from the side opposite the carbon–halogen bond. The tran￾sition state for bromonium ion ring opening has some of the character of a carbocation; 
therefore, the reaction proceeds by breaking the bond between bromine and the more

8.11 Epoxidation of Alkenes
We have seen two reactions in which alkenes react with electrophilic reagents via cyclic 
transition states (hydroboration) or intermediates (halonium ions). In this section we’ll 
introduce a reaction that gives a cyclic product—a three-membered oxygen-containing 
ring called an epoxide.
Substitutive IUPAC nomenclature treats epoxides as epoxy derivatives of alkane 
parents; the epoxy-prefix is listed in alphabetical order like other substituents. Some indus￾trial chemicals have common names formed by adding the word “oxide” to the name of 
the alkene.

Disparlure
In one strategy designed to control the spread of the gypsy moth, infested areas are

become hopelessly confused as to the actual location of individual females. Many other￾wise fertile female gypsy moths then live out their lives without producing hungry gypsy 
moth caterpillars.

Epoxidation of alkenes with peroxy acids is a syn addition to the double bond. 
Substituents that are cis to each other in the alkene remain cis in the epoxide; substituents 
that are trans in the alkene remain trans in the epoxide.
Problem 8.19
Give the structure of the alkene, including stereochemistry, that you would choose as the 
starting material in a preparation of synthetic disparlure.
Electron-releasing substituents on the double bond increase the rate of epoxidation, 
which suggests that the peroxy acid acts as an electrophile toward the alkene.

The types of carbonyl compounds that result are determined by the substituents on the 
doubly bonded carbons. Formaldehyde, aldehydes, or ketones are possible, depending on 
whether a particular carbon is attached to two hydrogens, a hydrogen and an alkyl group, 
or two alkyl groups respectively. Thus, the CH2 unit in each of the preceding examples 
gives formaldehyde. The remaining seven carbons of 1-octene are incorporated into the 
aldehyde heptanal, and the remaining six carbons of 2-methyl-1-hexene into the ketone 
2-hexanone.

Ozonolysis has both synthetic and analytical applications in organic chemistry. In 
synthesis, ozonolysis of alkenes provides a method for the preparation of aldehydes and 
ketones. When the objective is analytical, the products of ozonolysis are isolated and 
identified, thereby allowing the structure of the alkene to be deduced. In one such example,

8.13 Enantioselective Addition to Alkenes
The preceding sections have introduced several stereochemical aspects of addition to 
double bonds. This section extends our discussion by focusing on additions in which an 
achiral reactant is converted to a chiral product. Countless examples of reactions of this 
type exist—a simple one being the hydration of the double bond of cis- or trans-2-butene. 
Under either the usual acid-catalyzed conditions or hydroboration–oxidation, 2-butanol 
is formed as a racemic mixture.

If, instead, certain chiral and enantiomerically enriched hydroborating agents are 
used instead of diborane itself, the 2-butanol that results is itself enriched in one of its 
enantiomers. Reactions such as this are said to be enantioselective.
Most biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes and many require coenzymes 
to carry out their function. All enzymes and most coenzymes are chiral and enantiopure 
and provide an asymmetric environment for chemical reactions to take place. Enzyme￾catalyzed reactions are enantioselective and occur with such a high level of stereoselec￾tivity as to form a single enantiomer of a chiral substance exclusively.

From the equation, we see that the chemical reaction is hydration of a double bond. Neither 
fumaric acid nor water is chiral, but only the S enantiomer of malic acid is produced. The 
only source of chirality is the enzyme fumarase. According to the equation, we also see 
that the reaction is reversible—hydration of a double bond in one direction, dehydration in 
the other—and that fumarase is a catalyst for both processes. We should also point out the 
cis isomer of fumaric acid, called maleic acid, does not react under these or analogous 
conditions nor is there an enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis that converts fumaric or maleic 
acid directly to (R)-(+)-malic acid.
Problem 8.22
The enzyme aconitase catalyzes the hydration of aconitic acid to two products: citric acid

Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the preparation and reactions of alkenes, but are not only about 
alkenes. The two chapters also concern the compounds that lead to alkenes and the prod￾ucts of the reactions of alkenes. Suppose you wanted to prepare 1,2-epoxycyclohexane,

Now consider a slightly more difficult, but more realistic case—one in which the 
target is the nitrile (CH3)2CHCH2CN and the starting material is not specified other than 
to say it must be an alkene with five carbons or fewer.
Begin by recalling that the only reaction we have seen that yields a compound of 
the type RCN is a substitution of the SN2 type. Thus, we consider a partial sequence of 
the type:
Br OH
N
Conversion of 1-bromo-2-methylpropane to the nitrile target is a reasonable last step, but 
successful preparation of the bromide is doubtful because of the possibility of rearrange￾ment in the reaction of 2-methyl-1-propanol with hydrogen bromide. A safer choice is 
to use a sulfonate instead of a bromide.
OSO2CH3 OH

The problem specifies that the starting material be an alkene with five or fewer

We write the synthesis in the forward direction by choosing the appropriate reagents 
and begin by converting 2-methylpropene to 2-methyl-1-propanol by hydration of the 
double bond regioselectively by hydroboration–oxidation. Converting the alcohol to the 
methanesulfonate, followed by nucleophilic substitution of methanesulfonate by cyanide, 
completes the synthesis.

Section 8.6 See Table 8.2. Acid-catalyzed addition of water to the double bond of an alkene 
gives an alcohol. The mechanism is analogous to that for electrophilic addition 
of hydrogen halides and is the reverse of that for acid-catalyzed dehydration of

proceeds in accordance with Markovnikov’s rule: 
hydrogen adds to the carbon that has the greater 
number of hydrogens, halide to the carbon that 
has the fewer hydrogens. The regioselectivity is 
controlled by the relative stability of the two

electrophilic addition of a boron hydride to the 
double bond, followed by oxidation of the

Addition of Halogens (Section 8.10) Reactions 
with Br2 or Cl2 are the most common and yield 
vicinal dihalides except when the reaction is 
carried out in water. In water, the product is a 
vicinal halohydrin. The reactions involve a 
cyclic halonium ion intermediate and are 
stereospecific (anti addition). Halohydrin 
formation is regiospecific; the halogen bonds

TABLE 8.2 Addition Reactions of Alkenes (Continued)322 Chapter 8 Addition Reactions of Alkenes
Section 8.7 Addition and elimination reactions are often reversible, and proceed 
spontaneously in the direction in which the free energy G decreases. The 
reaction is at equilibrium when ΔG = 0. Free energy is related to enthalpy (H) 
and entropy (S) by the equations
G = H − TS and ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
The standard free energy change ΔG° is related to the equilibrium constant K by 
the equation
ΔG° = −RT ln K
Sections 8.8 See Table 8.2. Hydroboration–oxidation is a synthetically useful and 
mechanistically novel method for converting alkenes to alcohols.
Section 8.10 See Table 8.2. Bromine and chlorine react with alkenes to give cyclic halonium 
ions, which react further to give vicinal dihalides. In aqueous solution, the 
product is a vicinal bromohydrin.
Section 8.11 See Table 8.2. Peroxy acids are a source of electrophilic oxygen and convert 
alkenes to epoxides.
Section 8.12 Alkenes are cleaved to carbonyl compounds by ozonolysis. This reaction is 
useful for both synthesis (preparation of aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic 
acids) and analysis. When applied to analysis, the carbonyl compounds are 
isolated and identified, allowing the substituents attached to the double bond 
to be deduced.

3-ethylpentane. Suggest structures for compounds A, B, and C consistent with these 
observations.

compound B yields 2,4-dimethylpentane. Identify compounds A and B.
8.53 Compounds A and B are isomers of molecular formula C9H19Br. Both yield the same 
alkene C as the exclusive product of elimination on being treated with potassium tert-butoxide

8.54 Alcohol A (C10H18O) is converted to a mixture of alkenes B and C on being heated

Oxymercuration
Concerns about mercury’s toxicity have led to decreased use of mercury-based reagents in synthetic 
organic chemistry. Alternatives exist for many of the transformations formerly carried out with 
mercury compounds while carrying much less risk. The chemistry of several of the reactions, 
however, is sufficiently interesting to examine here.
Among the synthetically useful reactions of Hg(II) salts with organic compounds, the most 
familiar is a two-stage procedure for alkene hydration called oxymercuration–demercuration. Its 
application in the conversion of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene to 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol illustrates the 
procedure.

The reaction is performed in two operations, the first of which is oxymercuration. In this stage 
the alkene is treated with mercury(II) acetate [Hg(O2CCH3)2, abbreviated as Hg(OAc)2]. 
Mercury(II) acetate is a source of the electrophile +HgOAc, which bonds to C-1 of the alkene. 
The oxygen of water, one of the components in the THF–H2O solvent mixture, bonds to C-2. 
The demercuration operation uses sodium borohydride (NaBH4, a reducing agent) to convert 
CHg to CH.
From the overall reaction, we see that oxymercuration–demercuration
1. accomplishes hydration of the double bond in accordance with Markovnikov’s rule, and
2. carbocation rearrangements do not occur.
Descriptive Passage and Interpretive Problems 8330 Chapter 8 Addition Reactions of Alkenes
Additional information from stereochemical studies with other alkenes has established that
3. anti addition of HgOAc and OH characterizes the oxymercuration stage, and
4. the replacement of HgOAc by H in the demercuration stage is not stereospecific.
The structure of the intermediate in oxymercuration has received much attention and can 
be approached by considering what is likely to happen when the electrophile +HgOAc reacts with 
the double bond of an alkene.

Alkynes
Hydrocarbons that contain a carbon–carbon triple bond are 
called alkynes. Noncyclic alkynes have the molecular for￾mula CnH2n–2. Acetylene (HCCH) is the simplest alkyne. 
We call compounds that have their triple bond at the end of 
a carbon chain (RCCH) monosubstituted, or terminal, 
alkynes. Disubstituted alkynes (RCCR′) have internal
triple bonds. You will see in this chapter that a carbon–
carbon triple bond is a functional group, reacting with many 
of the same reagents that react with the double bonds of 
alkenes.
The most distinctive aspect of the chemistry of acetylene 
and terminal alkynes is their acidity. As a class, compounds of 
the type RCCH are the most acidic of all hydrocarbons. The 
structural reasons for this property, as well as the ways in which 
it is used to advantage in chemical synthesis, are important 
elements of this chapter.
9.1 Sources of Alkynes
Acetylene was discovered in 1836 but did not command much 
attention until its large-scale preparation from calcium carbide 
near the end of the nineteenth century stimulated interest in 
industrial applications. In the first stage of that synthesis, 
The brightly colored poison dart frogs of Central and South America 
store toxic substances such as the acetylenic alkaloid histrionicotoxin 
within their bodies to deter attacks by other animals.

The reaction is endothermic, and the equilibrium favors ethylene at low temperatures but 
shifts to favor acetylene above 1150°C. Indeed, at very high temperatures most hydro￾carbons, even methane, are converted to acetylene. Acetylene has value not only by itself 
but also as a starting material from which higher alkynes are prepared.
More than 1000 natural products contain carbon–carbon triple bonds. Many, such 
as stearolic acid and tariric acid, are fatty acids—carboxylic acids with unbranched 
chains of 12–20 carbon atoms—or are derived from them.

Cultures of the bacterium Micromonospora chersina produce dynemicin A, a purple 
substance characterized by a novel structure containing a double bond and two triple 
bonds in a ten-membered ring (an enediyne). Dynemicin A has attracted interest because 
of its ability to cleave DNA by a novel mechanism, which may lead to the development 
of anticancer drugs that are based on the enediyne structure.

Diacetylene (HCCCCH) has been identified as a component of the 
hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. It is also present in the 
atmospheres of Titan and Triton, satellites of Saturn and Neptune, respectively. Most 
surprisingly, 2009 brought the report of the discovery of diacetylene on our own moon.
9.2 Nomenclature
In naming alkynes the usual IUPAC rules for hydrocarbons are followed, and the suffix 
-ane is replaced by -yne. Both acetylene and ethyne are acceptable IUPAC names for 
HCCH. The position of the triple bond along the chain is specified by number in a 
manner analogous to alkene nomenclature.

Problem 9.2
Write structural formulas and give the IUPAC names for all the alkynes of molecular 
formula C5H8.
If a compound contains both a double bond and a triple bond, the chain is numbered 
so as to give the first multiple bond the lowest number, irrespective of whether it is a 
double bond or a triple bond. Ties are broken in favor of the double bond. An en suffix 
for the double bond precedes yne and is separated from it by the yne locant. Thus, the 
compound vinylacetylene H2CCHCCH is named but-1-en-3-yne according to the 
latest IUPAC rules.
When the CCH group is named as a substituent, it is designated as an ethynyl
group.
9.3 Physical Properties of Alkynes
Alkynes resemble alkanes and alkenes in their physical properties. They share with these 
other hydrocarbons the properties of low density and low water-solubility and have boil￾ing points similar to those of alkanes.
Vinylacetylene is an industrial 
chemical used in the preparation of

Linear geometries characterize the HCCC and CCCC units of ter￾minal and internal triple bonds, respectively, as well. This linear geometry is responsible 
for the relatively small number of known cycloalkynes. Figure 9.1 shows a molecular 
model of cyclononyne in which the bending of the CCCC unit is clearly evident. 
Angle strain destabilizes cycloalkynes to the extent that cyclononyne is the smallest one 
that is stable enough to be stored for long periods. The next smaller one, cyclooctyne, 
has been isolated, but is relatively reactive and polymerizes on standing.
An sp hybridization model for the carbon–carbon triple bond was developed in 
Section 2.9 and is reviewed for acetylene in Figure 9.2. Figure 9.3 compares the elec￾trostatic potential maps of ethylene and acetylene and shows how the two π bonds in 
acetylene cause a band of high electron density to encircle the molecule.
Table 9.1 compares some structural features of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. As 
we progress through the series in the order ethane → ethylene → acetylene:
1. The geometry at carbon changes from tetrahedral → trigonal planar → linear.
2. The CC and CH bonds become shorter and stronger.
3. The acidity of the CH bonds increases.

in (b) and (c).

and acetylene. The region of highest 
negative charge (red) is associated with 
the π bonds and lies between the two 
carbons in both. This electron-rich region 
is above and below the plane of the 
molecule in ethylene. Because acetylene 
has two π bonds, a band of high electron 
density encircles the molecule.
Figure 9.1

showing bending of the bond angles 
associated with the triply bonded

the structure determined experimentally. 
Notice how the staggering of bonds on 
adjacent atoms governs the overall 
shape of the ring.336 Chapter 9 Alkynes
All of these trends can be accommodated by the orbital hybridization model. The 
bond angles are characteristic for the sp3
, sp2
, and sp hybridization states of carbon and 
don’t require additional comment. The bond distances, bond strengths, and acidities are 
related to the s character in the orbitals used for bonding. s Character is the fraction of the 
hybrid orbital contributed by an s atomic orbital. Thus, an sp3
 hybrid orbital has one quarter 
s character and three quarters p, an sp2
 hybrid orbital has one third s and two thirds p, and 
an sp hybrid orbital one half s and one half p. We then use this information to analyze 
how various qualities of the hybrid orbital reflect those of its s and p contributors.
Take CH bond distance and bond strength, for example. Recalling that an electron 
in a 2s atomic orbital is, on average, closer to the nucleus and more strongly held than an 
electron in a 2p atomic orbital, it follows that an electron in an orbital with more s character 
will be more strongly held than an electron in an orbital with less s character. Thus, when 
a half-filled sp orbital of carbon overlaps with a half-filled hydrogen 1s atomic orbital to 
give a CH σ bond, the bond is stronger and shorter than one between hydrogen and sp2
-
hybridized carbon. Similar reasoning holds for the shorter CC bond distance of acetylene 
compared with ethylene, although here the additional π bond in acetylene is also a factor.
The pattern is repeated in higher alkynes as shown when comparing propyne and 
propene. The bonds to the sp-hybridized carbons of propyne are shorter than the cor￾responding bonds to the sp2
-hybridized carbons of propene.

A good way to think about the effect of the s character is to associate it with elec￾tronegativity. As its s character increases, so does a carbon’s electronegativity (the elec￾trons in the bond involving that orbital are closer to carbon). The hydrogens in CH 
bonds behave as if they are attached to an increasingly more electronegative carbon in 
the series ethane → ethylene → acetylene.

Problem 9.3
How do bond distances and bond strengths change with electronegativity in the series NH3, 
H2O, and HF?
The property that most separates acetylene from ethane and ethylene is its acidity. 
It, too, can be explained on the basis of the greater electronegativity of sp-hybridized 
carbon compared with sp3
 and sp2
.
9.5 Acidity of Acetylene and Terminal Alkynes
The CH bonds of hydrocarbons show little tendency to ionize, and alkanes, alkenes, 
and alkynes are all very weak acids. The acid-dissociation constant Ka for methane, for 
example, is too small to be measured directly but is estimated to be about 10−50 (pKa 50).

The conjugate base of a hydrocarbon is called a carbanion. It is an anion in which 
the negative charge is borne by carbon. Because it is derived from a very weak acid, a 
carbanion such as −:CH3 is an exceptionally strong base.
Using the relationship from Section 9.4 that the electronegativity of carbon increases 
with its s character (sp3
 < sp2
 < sp), the order of hydrocarbon acidity is seen to increase 
with increasing s character of carbon.

In the corresponding ionizations of ethylene and ethane, the unshared pair occupies 
an orbital with 33% (sp2
) and 25% (sp3
) s character, respectively. The greater % s character 
helps to stabilize the anion charge by allowing the negative charge to be held closer to 
the positively charged nucleus. Figure 9.4 illustrates the effect of s character on the anion 
by comparing the conjugate bases of ethane, ethylene, and acetylene.
Terminal alkynes (RCCH) resemble acetylene in acidity.

Although acetylene and terminal alkynes are far stronger acids than other hydro￾carbons, we must remember that they are, nevertheless, very weak acids—much weaker 
than water and alcohols, for example. Hydroxide ion is too weak a base to convert acety￾lene to its anion in meaningful amounts. The position of the equilibrium described by 
the following equation lies overwhelmingly to the left:

Because acetylene is a far weaker acid than water and alcohols, these substances 
are not suitable solvents for reactions involving acetylide ions. Acetylide is instantly 
converted to acetylene by proton transfer from compounds that contain OH groups.
Amide ion, however, is a much stronger base than acetylide ion and converts acety￾lene to its conjugate base quantitatively.

Alcohols are stronger acids than acetylene, and so the position of equilibrium lies to the left. 
Methoxide ion is not a strong enough base to remove a proton from acetylene.
Anions of acetylene and terminal alkynes are nucleophilic and react with methyl 
and primary alkyl halides to form carbon–carbon bonds by nucleophilic substitution. 
They are such strong bases, however, that they react with secondary and tertiary alkyl 
halides by elimination.
9.6 Preparation of Alkynes by Alkylation 
of Acetylene and Terminal Alkynes
Organic synthesis makes use of two major reaction types:
1. Carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions
2. Functional-group transformations
Both strategies are applied to the preparation of alkynes. In this section we shall see how 
to prepare alkynes by carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions. By attaching alkyl groups 
to acetylene (alkylation), more complex alkynes can be prepared.

elimination procedure.9.7 Preparation of Alkynes by Elimination Reactions 341
9.7 Preparation of Alkynes by Elimination Reactions
Just as it is possible to prepare alkenes by dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides, so may 
alkynes be prepared by a double dehydrohalogenation of dihaloalkanes. The dihalide 
may be a geminal dihalide, one in which both halogens are on the same carbon, or it 
may be a vicinal dihalide, one in which the halogens are on adjacent carbons.

The most frequent applications of these procedures lie in the preparation of ter￾minal alkynes. Because the terminal alkyne product is acidic enough to transfer a proton 
to amide anion, one equivalent of base in addition to the two equivalents required for 
double dehydrohalogenation is needed. Adding water or acid after the reaction is com￾plete converts the sodium salt to the corresponding alkyne.

9.8 Reactions of Alkynes
We have already discussed one important chemical property of alkynes, the acidity of 
acetylene and terminal alkynes. In the remaining sections of this chapter several other 
reactions of alkynes will be explored. Most of them will be similar to reactions of 
alkenes. Like alkenes, alkynes undergo addition reactions. We’ll begin with a reaction 
familiar to us from our study of alkenes, namely, catalytic hydrogenation.
9.9 Hydrogenation of Alkynes
The conditions for hydrogenation of alkynes are similar to those employed for alkenes. 
In the presence of finely divided platinum, palladium, nickel, or rhodium, two molar 
equivalents of hydrogen add to the triple bond of an alkyne to yield an alkane.

Problem 9.9
Write a series of equations showing how you could prepare octane from acetylene and any 
necessary organic and inorganic reagents.
The heat of hydrogenation of an alkyne is greater than twice the heat of hydroge￾nation of an alkene. When two moles of hydrogen add to an alkyne, addition of the first 
mole (triple bond → double bond) is more exothermic than the second (double bond → 
single bond).9.9 Hydrogenation of Alkynes 343
Substituents affect the heats of hydrogenation of alkynes in the same way they 
affect alkenes. Compare the heats of hydrogenation of 1-butyne and 2-butyne, both of 
which give butane on taking up two moles of H2.

The internal triple bond of 2-butyne is stabilized relative to the terminal triple bond of 
1-butyne. Alkyl groups release electrons to sp-hybridized carbon, stabilizing the alkyne 
and decreasing the heat of hydrogenation.
Like the hydrogenation of alkenes, hydrogenation of alkynes is a syn addition; cis 
alkenes are intermediates in the hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes.

The fact that cis alkenes are intermediates in the hydrogenation of alkynes suggests 
that partial hydrogenation of an alkyne would provide a method for preparing:
1. Alkenes from alkynes, and
2. cis Alkenes free of their trans stereoisomers
Both objectives are met with special hydrogenation catalysts. The most frequently used 
one is the Lindlar catalyst, a palladium on calcium carbonate combination to which 
lead acetate and quinoline have been added. Lead acetate and quinoline partially deacti￾vate (“poison”) the catalyst, making it a poor catalyst for alkene hydrogenation while 
retaining its ability to catalyze the addition of H2 to the triple bond.

reagents. (Hint: You may find it helpful to review Section 9.6.)

The structure of quinoline is shown 
on page 463. In subsequent equations, 
we will simply use the term Lindlar Pd
to stand for all of the components of 
the Lindlar catalyst.344 Chapter 9 Alkynes
Sample Solution
Hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes using the Lindlar catalyst is attractive because 
it sidesteps the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity issues that accompany the dehydra￾tion of alcohols and dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides. In terms of regioselectivity, 
the position of the double bond is never in doubt—it appears in the carbon chain at 
exactly the same place where the triple bond was. In terms of stereoselectivity, only the 
cis alkene forms. Recall that dehydration and dehydrohalogenation normally give a cis–
trans mixture in which the cis isomer is the minor product.
9.10 Addition of Hydrogen Halides to Alkynes
Alkynes react with many of the same electrophilic reagents that add to the carbon–carbon 
double bond of alkenes. Hydrogen halides, for example, add to alkynes to form alkenyl halides.

When formulating a mechanism for the reaction of alkynes with hydrogen halides, we 
could propose a process analogous to that of electrophilic addition to alkenes in which the 
first step is formation of a carbocation and is rate-determining. According to such a mech￾anism, the second step would be nucleophilic capture of the carbocation by a halide ion.

Evidence from a variety of sources, however, indicates that alkenyl cations (also 
called vinylic cations) are much less stable than simple alkyl cations, and their involve￾ment in these additions has been questioned.
Kinetic studies suggest a transition state involving two molecules of the hydrogen 
halide and one of the alkyne. Figure 9.5 depicts a one-step termolecular process that 
avoids the formation of a very unstable alkenyl cation intermediate by invoking nucleo￾philic participation by the halogen at an early stage. Nevertheless, because Markovnikov’s 
rule is observed, it seems likely that some degree of positive character develops at carbon 
and controls the regioselectivity of addition.
In the presence of excess hydrogen halide, geminal dihalides are formed by sequen￾tial addition of two molecules of hydrogen halide to the carbon–carbon triple bond.

converting ethylene to acetylene as a key feature. As described in Section 9.7, this may be 
accomplished by conversion of ethylene to a vicinal dihalide, followed by double

By analogy to the hydration of alkenes, hydration of an alkyne would be expected to 
yield an alcohol. This alcohol, however, would be a special kind, called an enol, one in 
which the OH group is attached to a carbon–carbon double bond. Except for the enol

Some Things That Can Be Made from Acetylene . . . But Aren’t
Acetylene had several uses around the time of World War I, 
primarily because it burned with a hot, luminous flame. The 
oxyacetylene torch and automobile and bicycle headlamps made 
by the Prest-O-Lite Company are representative of this period.
In an attempt to find a route to acetylene other than from 
calcium carbide, Prest-O-Lite sponsored research carried out by 
George O. Curme at Pittsburgh’s Mellon Institute. Curme’s 
research, which was directed toward converting the gases pro￾duced during petroleum refining to acetylene, led to methods 
better suited for making ethylene than acetylene. Viewed from 
our present perspective, Curme’s petroleum-based route to 
ethylene ranks as a major discovery. It wasn’t at the time though, 
because ethylene had virtually no uses before the 1920s. 
Curme’s second great contribution was the research carried out 
to see what useful products could be made from ethylene. The 
first was ethylene glycol, which became Prestone antifreeze. 
Others followed, and now ethylene is the most important 
industrial organic chemical—perhaps the most important of all 
industrial chemicals.
What about acetylene? Based on the reactions described 
in this chapter we can write the following equations, all of which 
lead to useful compounds.
In fact, very little of each of these products is made from 
acetylene. Ethylene is the starting material for the preparation of 
vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, and acetaldehyde. Propene is the 
starting material for acrylonitrile.
Economics dictate the choice of alkene in each case. Acet￾ylene, because of the high energy cost of preparing it, is much 
more expensive than ethylene and propene. At present, acety￾lene is used as a starting material only in those few countries 
where local coal versus petroleum prices favor it. Ethylene comes 
from petroleum, acetylene can be made from coal. In time, as 
petroleum becomes increasingly expensive, acetylene-based 
syntheses may become competitive with ethylene-based ones.

Recall that when carbonic acid is 
formed as a reaction product, it 
dissociates to carbon dioxide and 
water.As was the case in the reaction of ozone with alkenes (Section 8.12), ozonolysis 
of alkynes was used as a tool in structure determination. By identifying the carboxylic 
acids produced, the structure of the alkyne can be deduced. As with many other chemical 
methods of structure determination, however, it has been superseded by spectroscopic 
methods such as those to be described in Chapter 14.
Problem 9.14
A certain hydrocarbon had the molecular formula C16H26 and contained two triple bonds. 
Ozonolysis gave CH3(CH2)4CO2H and HO2CCH2CH2CO2H as the only products. Suggest a 
reasonable structure for this hydrocarbon.
9.14 Alkynes in Synthesis and Retrosynthesis
Acetylene occupies a useful position in organic synthesis in that it can be applied 
to  CC bond formation by reaction of its conjugate base with alkylating agents 
such  as alkyl halides and sulfonates. The chain-extended product retains the triple 
bond and can undergo subsequent addition reactions to give other classes of organic 
compounds or be subjected to a second alkylation. The following illustrates the retro￾synthetic approach and incorporates a chain extension plus two functional-group 
transformations.
Example: Outline a synthesis of 1,2-epoxybutane using ethyl bromide and acetylene 
as sources for all the carbon atoms.
We determine the last step in the synthesis by recognizing that the most common 
route to epoxides is via the reaction of alkenes with peroxy acids.

The problem now is to prepare 1-butene from ethyl bromide and acetylene, a process 
that requires CC bond formation. We can do this in two operations, shown retrosyn￾thetically as:

Section 9.1 Alkynes are hydrocarbons that contain a carbon–carbon triple bond. Simple 
alkynes having no other functional groups or rings have the general formula 
CnH2n−2. Acetylene is the simplest alkyne.

9.15 Summary 349350 Chapter 9 Alkynes
Section 9.2 Alkynes are named in much the same way as alkenes, using the suffix -yne
instead of -ene.
4,4-Dimethyl-2-pentyne
Section 9.3 The physical properties (boiling point, solubility in water, dipole moment) of 
alkynes resemble those of alkanes and alkenes.
Section 9.4 Acetylene is linear and alkynes have a linear geometry of their XCCY 
units. The carbon–carbon triple bond in alkynes is composed of a σ and two π 
components.
The triple-bonded carbons are sp-hybridized. The σ component of the triple bond 
contains two electrons in an orbital generated by the overlap of sp-hybridized 
orbitals on adjacent carbons. Each of these carbons also has two 2p orbitals, 
which overlap in pairs so as to give two π orbitals, each of which contains two 
electrons.
Section 9.5 Acetylene and terminal alkynes are more acidic than other hydrocarbons. They 
have pKas of approximately 25, compared with about 44 for alkenes and about 
50 for alkanes. Sodium amide is a strong enough base to remove a proton from 
acetylene or a terminal alkyne, but sodium hydroxide is not.

them to be converted to their conjugate bases on treat￾ment with sodium amide. These anions are good nucleo￾philes and react with methyl and primary alkyl halides 
to form carbon–carbon bonds. Secondary and tertiary 
alkyl halides cannot be used, because they yield only 
elimination products under these conditions.

Thinking Mechanistically About Alkynes
The preparation and properties of alkynes extend some topics explored in earlier chapters:
∙ Alkynes can be prepared by elimination reactions related to the E2 dehydrohalogenation of 
alkyl halides used to prepare alkenes (Sections 7.15–7.17).
∙ Alkynes can be prepared by SN2 reactions (Sections 6.3–6.5) in which a nucleophile of the 
type RCC:− reacts with a primary alkyl halide.
∙ Alkynes undergo addition reactions, especially electrophilic addition, with many of the same 
compounds that add to alkenes (Chapter 8).
The greater s character of sp hybrid orbitals compared with sp3
 and sp2

properties beyond those seen in alkanes and alkenes. It is convenient to think of sp-hybridized

 counterparts.

reduce the need to memorize facts while increasing your ability to analyze and understand new 
material. Nucleophilic addition to alkynes, for example, is not covered in this chapter but is the

Introduction to Free 
Radicals
There is a pronounced chemical bias in favor of compounds that 
have an even number of electrons—electron pairs and the octet
rule testify to this. Our familiarity with paired electrons doesn’t 
mean, however, that compounds with an odd number of elec￾trons don’t exist. They do, in both inorganic and organic chem￾istry and must, of necessity, contain at least one unpaired 
electron. Two of the oxides of nitrogen furnish us with inorganic 
examples.
N O N
O O
Nitrogen monoxide Nitrogen dioxide
Although known for hundreds of years, nitrogen monoxide has 
only recently been found to be an important biochemical mes￾senger and moderator of so many biological processes that it’s 
fair to ask “Which ones is it not involved in?” Nitrogen dioxide 
produced by combustion of various fuels, especially gasoline, 
contributes significantly to air pollution in cities.
Stars that are well along in their lifetime are described as “evolved.” 
While using up their nuclear fuel, these evolved stars produce a stellar 
wind that carries chemical substances from the interior to the envelope 
surrounding the surface. Most of these substances have very simple 
molecular formulas, but unusual structures. C2H, for example, cannot be 
represented by a structural formula in which all of its electron spins are 
paired. It belongs to a class of compounds we call “free radicals.”

Chapter10.1 Structure, Bonding, and Stability of Alkyl Radicals 359
Species that contain unpaired electrons are called free radicals. Some, such as 
nitrogen monoxide and dioxide, are stable species. Others, and these are the ones of 
interest in this chapter, occur as intermediates in chemical reactions—formed in one step 
of a mechanism and consumed in another. We’ll begin with a description of structure 
and bonding in carbon-centered free radicals, then introduce reactions of alkanes, alkenes, 
and alkynes that involve them as intermediates.
10.1 Structure, Bonding, and Stability of Alkyl Radicals
Alkyl radicals are characterized by the presence of a carbon with three bonds and are 
classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary according to the number of carbon atoms 
directly attached to the one that bears the unpaired electron.

Two possibilities can be considered for bonding in methyl radical. According to 
the model shown in Figure 10.1a, carbon is sp2
-hybridized and the unpaired electron 
occupies a 2p orbital. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 10.1b, carbon is sp3
-hybridized, 
and one of its orbitals contains only one electron. Of the two extremes, experimental 
studies indicate that the planar sp2
 model describes the bonding in alkyl radicals better 
than the pyramidal sp3
 model. Methyl radical is planar, and more highly substituted 
radicals such as tert-butyl are flattened pyramids closer in shape to that expected for 
sp2
-hybridized carbon than for sp3
.
Free radicals, like carbocations, are stabilized by substituents such as alkyl groups 
that can donate electrons to the unfilled orbital by hyperconjugation, where the unpaired 
electron, plus electrons in σ bonds that are β to the radical site, are delocalized. This 
delocalization is illustrated in Figure 10.2, which compares the calculated spin density 
in methyl and ethyl radical. Spin density is a measure of the unpaired electron density 
at a particular point in a molecule—it tells us where the unpaired electron is most 
likely to be. In the case of methyl radical, which cannot be stabilized by hyperconjuga￾tion, the spin density is concentrated on a single atom, carbon. In ethyl radical, hyper￾conjugation allows the spin density to be shared by the sp2
-hybridized carbon plus the 
three hydrogens of the methyl group.
For more on the role of NO in 
physiology, see the boxed essay Oh 
NO! it’s Inorganic! in Chapter 25.
Stabilization of carbocations by 
hyperconjugation was described in 
Section 5.9.

More highly substituted radicals are more stable than less highly substituted ones 
because they have more electron pairs β to the radical site. The order of free-radical 
stability parallels that of carbocations.

Problem 10.1
Write a line formula for all the free radicals that have the formula C5H11 and classify each as 
primary, secondary, or tertiary. Which one is the most stable?
Some of the evidence indicating that alkyl substituents stabilize free radicals comes 
from comparing CH bond strengths in alkanes. A covalent bond can be broken in two 
ways. In a homolytic cleavage a bond between two atoms is broken so that each atom 
retains one of the electrons in the bond. Conversely, both electrons are retained by one 
of the atoms in a heterolytic cleavage.
X Y X + Y X Y X + Y +
Homolytic bond cleavage Heterolytic bond cleavage
We can assess the relative stability of alkyl radicals by measuring the enthalpy 
change (ΔH°) for the homolytic cleavage of a CH bond in an alkane:
R H R + H
The more stable the radical, the lower the energy required to generate it by homolytic 
cleavage of a CH bond. This energy is called the bond dissociation enthalpy (D).
Table 10.1 gives some examples.
As the table indicates, CH bond dissociation enthalpies in alkanes are approxi￾mately 400–440 kJ/mol (95–105 kcal/mol). Cleaving the HCH3 bond in methane gives 
methyl radical and requires 439 kJ/mol (105 kcal/mol). The dissociation enthalpy of the 
HCH2CH3 bond in ethane, which gives a primary radical, is somewhat less (421 kJ/mol, 
or 100.5 kcal/mol) and is consistent with the notion that ethyl radical (primary) is more 
stable than methyl.

*Bond dissociation enthalpies refer to the bond indicated in each structural formula and were calculated from standard enthalpy of 
formation values as recorded in the NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69, http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/.362 Chapter 10 Introduction to Free Radicals
Because the starting material (propane) and one of the products (H·) are the same in 
both processes, the difference in bond dissociation enthalpies is equal to the energy dif￾ference between a propyl radical (primary) and an isopropyl radical (secondary). As 
depicted in Figure 10.3, the secondary radical is 10 kJ/mol (2 kcal/mol) more stable than 
the primary radical.
Similarly, by comparing the bond dissociation enthalpies of the two different types 
of CH bonds in 2-methylpropane, we see that a tertiary radical is 22 kJ/mol (6 kcal/mol) 
more stable than a primary radical.

Problem 10.2
The CCl bond dissociation enthalpies of propyl and isopropyl chloride are the same within 
experimental error (see Table 10.1). However, it is incorrect to conclude that the data indicate 
equal stabilities of propyl and isopropyl radical. Why? Why are the bond dissociation 
enthalpies of propane a better indicator of the free-radical stabilities?
Like carbocations, most free radicals are exceedingly reactive species—too reactive 
to be isolated but capable of being formed as intermediates in chemical reactions. Methyl 
radical, as we shall see in Section 10.2, is an intermediate in the chlorination of methane.

The bond dissociation enthalpies of 
methylene and methyl C—H bonds in 
propane reveal a difference in stabilities 
between two isomeric free radicals. The 
secondary radical is more stable than 
the primary.10.2 Halogenation of Alkanes 363
The alkane is said to undergo fluorination, chlorination, bromination, or iodination accord￾ing to whether X2 is F2, Cl2, Br2, or I2, respectively. The general term is halogenation.
Chlorination and bromination are the most widely used.
The reactivity of the halogens decreases in the order F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2. Fluorine 
is an extremely aggressive oxidizing agent, and its reaction with alkanes is strongly 
exothermic and difficult to control. Chlorination of alkanes is less exothermic than fluo￾rination, and bromination less exothermic than chlorination. Iodine is unique among the 
halogens in that its reaction with alkanes is endothermic; consequently, alkyl iodides are 
never prepared by iodination of alkanes.
Problem 10.3
Use the data in Table 10.1 to calculate ΔH° for the iodination of methane.
Volume 11 of Organic Reactions, an 
annual series that reviews reactions of 
interest to organic chemists, contains 
the statement “Most organic 
compounds burn or explode when 
brought in contact with fluorine.”
From Bond Enthalpies to Heats of Reaction
You have seen that measurements of heats of reaction, such 
as heats of combustion, can provide quantitative informa￾tion concerning the relative stability of constitutional isomers 
(Section 2.23) and stereoisomers (Section 3.11). The boxed essay 
in Section 2.23 described how heats of reaction can be manipu￾lated arithmetically to generate heats of formation (ΔH°f) for 
many molecules. The following material shows how two differ￾ent sources of thermochemical information, heats of formation 
and bond dissociation enthalpies (see Table 10.1), can reveal 
whether a particular reaction is exothermic or endothermic and 
by how much.
Consider the chlorination of methane to chloromethane. 
The heats of formation of the reactants and products appear 
beneath the equation. These heats of formation for the chemical 
compounds are taken from published tabulations; the heat of 
formation of chlorine is zero, as it is for all elements.

The overall heat of reaction is given by
ΔH° = Σ (heats of formation of products) − 
Σ (heats of formation of reactants)
ΔH° (kJ/mol) = (−83.7 − 92.3) − (−74.8) = −101.2 kJ/mol
ΔH° (kcal/mol) = (−20.0 − 22.1) − (−17.9) = −24.2 kcal/mol
Thus, the chlorination of methane is calculated to be exothermic 
on the basis of heat of formation data.
The same conclusion is reached using bond dissociation 
enthalpies. The following equation shows the bond dissociation 
enthalpies of the reactants and products taken from Table 10.1:

Because stronger bonds are formed at the expense of weaker 
ones, the reaction is exothermic and
ΔH° = Σ(BDE of bonds broken) − Σ(BDE of bonds formed)
ΔH° (kJ/mol) = (439 + 243) − (351 + 432) = −101 kJ/mol
ΔH° (kcal/mol) = (105 + 58) − (84 + 103) = −24 kcal/mol
This value is in good agreement with that obtained from heats of 
formation.
Compare chlorination of methane with iodination. The rel￾evant bond dissociation enthalpies are given in the equation.

ΔH° (kcal/mol) = (105 + 36) − (57 + 71) = +13 kcal/mol
A positive value for ΔH° signifies an endothermic reaction. The 
reactants are more stable than the products, and so iodination of 
alkanes is not a feasible reaction. You would not want to attempt 
the preparation of iodomethane by iodination of methane.
A similar analysis for fluorination of methane gives ΔH° =
−432 kJ/mol (−103 kcal/mol) for its heat of reaction. Fluorination 
of methane is about four times as exothermic as chlorination. A 
reaction this exothermic, if it also occurs at a rapid rate, can pro￾ceed with explosive violence.
Bromination of methane is exothermic, but less so than 
chlorination. The value calculated from bond dissociation 
enthalpies is ΔH° = −26 kJ/mol (−6.2 kcal/mol). Although bromi￾nation of methane is energetically favorable, economic consid￾erations cause most of the methyl bromide prepared 
commercially to be made from methanol by reaction with hydro￾gen bromide.364 Chapter 10 Introduction to Free Radicals
Chlorination of methane is carried out in the gas phase on an industrial scale to 
give a mixture of chloromethane (CH3Cl), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), trichloromethane 
(CHCl3), and tetrachloromethane (CCl4).

One of the chief uses of chloromethane is as a starting material from which silicone 
polymers are made. Dichloromethane is widely used as a paint stripper. Trichloromethane 
(chloroform) was once used as an inhalation anesthetic, but its toxicity caused it to be replaced 
by safer materials many years ago. Tetrachloromethane is the starting material for chloro￾fluorocarbons (CFCs), at one time widely used as refrigerant gases. Most of the world’s 
industrialized nations have agreed to phase out all uses of CFCs because these compounds 
have been implicated in atmospheric processes that degrade Earth’s ozone layer.
The mechanism of free-radical chlorination, to be presented in Section 10.3, is 
fundamentally different from the mechanism by which alcohols react with hydrogen 
halides. Alcohols are converted to alkyl halides in reactions involving ionic (or “polar”) 
intermediates—alkyloxonium ions and carbocations. The intermediates in the chlorina￾tion of methane and other alkanes are free radicals, not ions.
10.3 Mechanism of Methane Chlorination
Mechanism 10.1 describes the sequence of steps in the generally accepted mechanism for the 
chlorination of methane. The reaction is normally carried out in the gas phase at high tem￾perature (400–440°C). Although free-radical chlorination of methane is strongly exothermic, 
energy must be put into the system to initiate the reaction. This energy goes into breaking 
the weakest bond in the system, which, as we see from the bond dissociation enthalpy data in 
Table 10.1, is the ClCl bond with a bond dissociation enthalpy of 243 kJ/mol (58 kcal/mol). 
The step in which ClCl bond homolysis occurs is called the initiation step.
Each chlorine atom formed in the initiation step has seven valence electrons and 
is very reactive. Once formed, it abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane as shown in 
step 2 in Mechanism 10.1. Hydrogen chloride, one of the isolated products from the 
overall reaction, is formed in this step. A methyl radical is also formed, which then reacts 
with a molecule of Cl2 in step 3 giving chloromethane, the other product of the overall 
reaction, along with a chlorine atom, which cycles back to step 2, and the process repeats. 
Steps 2 and 3 are called propagation steps and, when added together, reproduce the net 
equation. Because one initiation step can result in a great many propagation cycles, the 
overall process is called a free-radical chain reaction.
Problem 10.4
Write equations for the initiation and propagation steps for the formation of dichloromethane 
by free-radical chlorination of chloromethane.
Chlorination of methane provides 
approximately one third of the annual 
U.S. production of chloromethane. 
The reaction of methanol with 
hydrogen chloride is the major 
synthetic method for the preparation 
of chloromethane.
Dichloromethane, trichloromethane, 
and tetrachloromethane are widely 
known by their common names 
methylene chloride, chloroform, and 
carbon tetrachloride, respectively.
The bond dissociation enthalpy of the 
other reactant, methane, is much 
higher. It is 439 kJ/mol (105 kcal/mol).10.3 Mechanism of Methane Chlorination 365

Steps 2 and 3 then repeat many times.
In practice, side reactions intervene to reduce the efficiency of the propagation 
steps. The chain sequence is interrupted whenever two odd-electron species combine to 
give an even electron product. Reactions of this type are called chain-terminating steps.
Chain-terminating steps in the chlorination of methane include:

Termination steps are, in general, less likely to occur than the propagation steps. Each 
of the termination steps requires two free radicals to encounter each other in a medium 
that contains far greater quantities of other materials (methane and molecular Cl2) with 
which they can react. Although some chloromethane undoubtedly arises via combination 
of methyl radicals with chlorine atoms, most of it is formed by the propagation sequence 
shown in Mechanism 10.1.

Chlorination of ethane yields, in addition to ethyl chloride, a mixture of two isomeric

Reactions that occur when light energy—usually visible or ultraviolet—is absorbed 
by a molecule are called photochemical reactions irrespective of their mechanism. In 
laboratory-scale syntheses, it is often convenient to carry out free-radical halogenations 
photochemically at room temperature.

If every collision of a chlorine atom with a butane molecule resulted in hydrogen atom 
abstraction, the butyl/sec-butyl radical ratio and, therefore, the 1-chloro/2-chlorobutane ratio, 
would be given by the relative numbers of hydrogens in the two equivalent methyl groups 
of butane (six) compared with those in the two equivalent methylene groups (four). The 
product distribution expected on this basis would be 60% 1-chlorobutane and 40% 
2-chlorobutane. The experimentally observed product distribution, however, is much differ￾ent: 28% 1-chlorobutane and 72% 2-chlorobutane. sec-Butyl radical is therefore formed in 
greater amounts, and butyl radical in lesser amounts, than expected on a statistical basis.
Mechanistically, this behavior stems from the greater stability of secondary com￾pared with primary free radicals. The transition state for the step in which a chlorine 
atom abstracts a hydrogen from carbon has free-radical character at carbon.

A secondary hydrogen is abstracted faster than a primary hydrogen because the 
transition state with secondary radical character is of lower energy than the one with 
primary radical character. The same factors that stabilize a secondary radical stabilize a 
transition state with secondary radical character more than one with primary radical 
character and cause a hydrogen atom to be abstracted from a CH2 group faster than one 
from a CH3 group. We can calculate how much faster a single secondary hydrogen is 
abstracted compared with a single primary hydrogen from the experimentally observed 
product distribution.

A single secondary hydrogen in butane is abstracted by a chlorine atom 3.9 times faster

Assuming the relative rate of secondary to primary hydrogen atom abstraction to be the

In summary, the chlorination of alkanes is not very selective. The various kinds of 
hydrogens present in a molecule (tertiary, secondary, and primary) differ by only a factor 
of 5 in the relative rate at which each reacts with a chlorine atom.

Bromine reacts with alkanes by a free-radical chain mechanism analogous to that of 
chlorine. There is an important difference between chlorination and bromination, however. Bromination is highly selective for substitution of tertiary hydrogens. The spread in 
reactivity among primary, secondary, and tertiary hydrogens is greater than 103

In practice, this means that when an alkane contains primary, secondary, and tertiary

We can understand why bromination is more selective than chlorination by using 
bond dissociation enthalpies (Table 10.1) to calculate the energy changes for the propa￾gation step in which each halogen atom abstracts a hydrogen from ethane.

The alkyl radical-forming step is exothermic for chlorination and endothermic for 
bromination. Applying Hammond’s postulate to these elementary steps, we conclude 
that alkyl radical character is more highly developed in the transition state for 
abstraction of hydrogen by a bromine atom than by a chlorine atom. Thus, bromination 
is more sensitive to the stability of the free-radical intermediate than chlorination and 
more selective.

The difference in selectivity between chlorination and bromination of alkanes needs 
to be kept in mind when one wishes to prepare an alkyl halide from an alkane:
1. Chlorination of an alkane yields every possible monochloride, so is used only when 
all the hydrogens in an alkane are equivalent.
2. Bromination of alkanes is highly regioselective for replacing tertiary hydrogens, so 
is mainly used to prepare tertiary alkyl bromides.
The percentage cited in this reaction 
is the isolated yield of purified 
product. Isomeric bromides constitute 
only a tiny fraction of the product.
10.4 Halogenation of Higher Alkanes 369370 Chapter 10 Introduction to Free Radicals
In Section 10.5 we’ll see a second free-radical method for preparing alkyl halides 
from hydrocarbons—the addition of hydrogen bromide to alkenes under conditions 
different from those involving electrophilic addition in Section 8.4.
10.5 Free-Radical Addition of Hydrogen 
Bromide to Alkenes and Alkynes
The regioselectivity of addition of hydrogen bromide to alkenes puzzled chemists for a 
long time. In contrast to the HCl and HI additions to alkenes that faithfully obeyed 
Markovnikov’s rule, HBr sometimes added in accordance with the rule, while at other 
times, seemingly under the same conditions, it added opposite to it. After hundreds of 
experiments during the period 1929–1933, Morris Kharasch’s research group at the 
University of Chicago found that Markovnikov’s rule was followed when peroxides 
were carefully excluded from the reaction mixture, but addition occurred opposite to the 
rule when peroxides were intentionally added.

+ HBr

Kharasch called this the peroxide effect and proposed that the difference in regioselec￾tivity was due to a peroxide-induced change in mechanism. The conventional electro￾philic addition pathway via a carbocation is responsible for Markovnikov addition and 
operates in the absence of peroxides; the other mechanism involves a free-radical inter￾mediate (Mechanism 10.2).
Problem 10.10
Kharasch’s earliest studies in this area were carried out in collaboration with graduate 
student Frank R. Mayo. Mayo performed over 400 experiments in which allyl bromide 
(3-bromo-1-propene) was treated with hydrogen bromide under a variety of conditions, and 
determined the distribution of the “normal” and “abnormal” products formed during the 
reaction. What two products were formed? Which is the product of addition in accordance 
with Markovnikov’s rule? Which one corresponds to addition opposite to the rule?
Like free-radical chlorination of methane described in Section 10.3, the free-radical 
addition of hydrogen bromide to 1-butene (Mechanism 10.2) is characterized by initiation
and chain propagation stages. The initiation stage, however, involves two steps rather 
than one, and it is this “extra” step that accounts for the role of peroxides. Peroxides are 
initiators; they are not incorporated into the product but act as a source of radicals nec￾essary to get the chain reaction started.
The regioselectivity of electrophilic addition of HBr to alkenes is controlled by 
the tendency of a proton to add to the double bond to produce the more stable car￾bocation. Under free-radical conditions the regioselectivity is governed by addition 
of a bromine atom to give the more stable alkyl radical. For the case of 1-butene, 
electrophilic addition involves a secondary carbocation, free-radical addition involves 
a secondary free radical.

Although the possibility of having two different reaction paths available to an alkene and 
hydrogen bromide may seem like a complication, it can be an advantage in organic 
synthesis. It is often possible to regioselectively prepare either of two different alkyl 
bromides by choosing reaction conditions that favor electrophilic addition or free-radical 
addition of hydrogen bromide.
Problem 10.12
Electrophilic addition of HBr to H2CCHCH(CH3)2 gives a mixture of two constitutional 
isomers A and B. Only B is formed, however, when CH3CHC(CH3)2 reacts with HBr in the 
presence of peroxides. Identify A and B and explain your reasoning.10.6 Metal–Ammonia Reduction of Alkynes 373
Hydrogen bromide (but not hydrogen chloride or hydrogen iodide) adds to alkynes 
by a free-radical mechanism when peroxides are present in the reaction mixture. As in 
the free-radical addition of hydrogen bromide to alkenes, the regioselectivity is opposite 
to Markovnikov’s rule.

10.6 Metal–Ammonia Reduction of Alkynes
A useful alternative to catalytic partial hydrogenation for converting alkynes to alkenes 
is reduction by a Group 1 metal (lithium, sodium, or potassium) in liquid ammonia. The 
unique feature of metal–ammonia reduction is that it converts alkynes to trans alkenes, 
whereas catalytic hydrogenation yields cis. Thus, from the same alkyne one can prepare 
either a cis or a trans alkene by choosing the appropriate reaction conditions.

Suggest an efficient synthesis of trans-2-heptene from propyne and any necessary organic or 
inorganic reagents.
The stereochemistry of metal–ammonia reduction of alkynes differs from that 
of catalytic hydrogenation because the mechanisms of the two reactions are different. 
The mechanism of hydrogenation of alkynes (Section 9.9) is similar to that of catalytic 
hydrogenation of alkenes (Section 8.2). Metal–ammonia reduction of alkynes is 
outlined in Mechanism 10.3.
The mechanism includes two single-electron transfers (steps 1 and 3) and two 
proton transfers (steps 2 and 4). Experimental evidence indicates that step 2 is rate￾determining, and that the (E)- and (Z)-alkenyl radicals formed in this step interconvert 
rapidly.

Reduction of these alkenyl radicals (step 3) gives a mixture of the (E)- and (Z)-alkenyl 
anions in which the more stable E stereoisomer predominates. Unlike the corresponding 
alkenyl radicals, the (E)- and (Z)-alkenyl anions are configurationally stable under the 
reaction conditions and yield an E/Z ratio of alkenes in step 4 that reflects the E/Z ratio 
of the alkenyl anions formed in step 3.374 Chapter 10 Introduction to Free Radicals

Sodium–Ammonia Reduction of an Alkyne

On dissolving in liquid ammonia, sodium atoms dissociate into sodium ions and

10.8 Free-Radical Polymerization of Alkenes
The boxed essay Ethylene and Propene: The Most Important Industrial Organic Chem￾icals summarizes the main uses of these two alkenes, especially their polymerization to 
polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Of the methods used to prepare polyethyl￾ene, the oldest involves free radicals and is carried out by heating ethylene under pressure 
in the presence of oxygen or a peroxide initiator.

In this reaction, n can have a value of thousands.
Mechanism 10.4 shows the steps in the free-radical polymerization of ethylene. Dis￾sociation of a peroxide initiates the process in step 1. The resulting peroxy radical adds to 
the carbon–carbon double bond in step 2, giving a new radical, which then adds to a second 
molecule of ethylene in step 3. The carbon–carbon bond-forming process in step 3 can be 
repeated thousands of times to give long carbon chains. In spite of the -ene ending to its 376 Chapter 10 Introduction to Free Radicals
name, polyethylene is much more closely related to alkanes than to alkenes. It is simply 
a long chain of CH2 groups bearing at its ends an alkoxy group (from the initiator) or a 
carbon–carbon double bond.
The properties that make polyethylene so useful come from its alkane-like structure. 
Except for the ends of the chain, which make up only a tiny portion of the molecule, 
polyethylene has no functional groups so is almost completely inert to most substances 
with which it comes in contact.

A large number of compounds with carbon–carbon double bonds have been poly￾merized to yield materials with useful properties. Some of the more familiar ones are listed 
in Table 10.2. Not all are effectively polymerized under free-radical conditions, and much 
research has been carried out to develop alternative methods. The most notable of these, 
coordination polymerization, employs transition metal catalysts and is used to prepare 
polypropylene. Coordination polymerization is described in Sections 15.15 and 27.7.
Ethylene and Propene: The Most Important 
Industrial Organic Chemicals
Having examined the properties of alkenes and intro￾duced the elements of polymers and polymerization, let’s 
now look at some commercial applications of ethylene and 
propene.
Ethylene We discussed ethylene production in an earlier 
boxed essay (Section 7.2), where it was pointed out that the out￾put of the U.S. petrochemical industry exceeds 5 × 1010 lb/year. 
Approximately 90% of this material is used for the preparation of 
four compounds (polyethylene, ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride, 
and styrene), with polymerization to polyethylene accounting for 
half the total. Vinyl chloride and styrene are polymerized to give 
poly(vinyl chloride) and polystyrene, respectively. Ethylene ox￾ide is a starting material for the preparation of ethylene glycol 
for use as an antifreeze in automobile radiators and in the pro￾duction of polyester fibers.
Propene The major use of propene is in the production of 
polypropylene. Two other propene-derived organic chemicals, 
acrylonitrile and propylene oxide, are also starting materials for 
polymer synthesis. Acrylonitrile is used to make acrylic fibers, 
and propylene oxide is one component in the preparation of 
polyurethane polymers. Cumene itself has no direct uses but 
rather serves as the starting material in a process that yields two 
valuable industrial chemicals: acetone and phenol.
We have not indicated the reagents employed in the reac￾tions by which ethylene and propene are converted to the com￾pounds shown. Because of patent requirements, different 
companies often use different processes. Although the pro￾cesses may be different, they share the common characteristic 
of being extremely efficient. The industrial chemist faces the 
challenge of producing valuable materials, at low cost. Success 
in the industrial environment requires both an understanding of 
chemistry and an appreciation of the economics associated with 
alternative procedures.

Section 10.4 Among alkanes, tertiary hydrogens are replaced faster than secondary, and 
secondary faster than primary. Chlorination is not very selective and is used 
only when all the hydrogens of the alkane are equivalent. Bromination is highly 
selective, replacing tertiary hydrogens much more readily than secondary or 
primary ones.

Without referring to Table 10.1, identify the alkane in each of the following pairs that 
has the lower carbon–carbon bond-dissociation enthalpy, and explain the reason for your 
choice.
(a) Ethane or propane
(b) Propane or 2-methylpropane
(c) 2-Methylpropane or 2,2-dimethylpropane
(d) Cyclobutane or cyclopentane
10.17 (a) Use the bond dissociation enthalpy data in Table 10.1 to calculate ΔH° for the 
reaction of methane with a bromine atom.
(b) The activation energy for this reaction is 76 kJ/mol (18.3 kcal/mol). Sketch a 
potential energy diagram for it, labeling reactants, product, and the transition state. 
Does the transition state more closely resemble reactants or products?
10.18 Use the bond dissociation enthalpy data in Table 10.1 to calculate ΔH° for (a) the 
monofluorination and (b) the monoiodination of methane. What is the main reason the 
values are so different?
Section 10.5 Hydrogen bromide is unique among the hydrogen halides in that it can add to 
alkenes by either electrophilic or free-radical addition. Under photochemical 
conditions or in the presence of peroxides, free-radical addition is observed, 
and HBr adds to the double bond with a regioselectivity opposite to that of 
Markovnikov’s rule.

Section 10.7 Free-radical reactions often provide alternative routes to useful compounds 
when planning a synthesis. In one example, free-radical halogenation offers a 
method to attach a functional group to an otherwise unreactive alkane frame￾work. In another, free-radical addition of hydrogen bromide to alkenes occurs 
with a regioselectivity opposite to that observed under more conventional ionic 
conditions.
Section 10.8 In their polymerization, many individual alkene molecules combine to give a 
high-molecular-weight product. Several economically important polymers such 
as polystyrene and low-density polyethylene are prepared by free-radical 
processes.Problems 381

underwent hydrolysis much more slowly than the minor one (compound B). Deduce the 
structures of compounds A and B and discuss the factors that influence their 
distribution.

Free-Radical Reduction of Alkyl Halides
Earlier chapters have introduced several methods for preparing alkyl halides and demonstrated 
their value in preparing other classes of organic compounds. A thioether, for example, cannot be 
prepared from an alcohol directly but is readily obtained by first converting the alcohol to an alkyl 
halide.
HBr NaSCH3 OH Br SCH3
In this chapter we learned that another source of alkyl halides is free-radical halogenation of 
alkanes. This opens another reasonable route to the same synthetic target.
Br2 NaSCH3

Br SCH3
Sometimes, we face the opposite situation: removing a halogen from carbon and replacing 
it with hydrogen. We might look at this in terms of nucleophilic substitution and consider sodium 
hydride (NaH), for example, as a source of hydride ion (:H−) in an SN2 reaction.
NaH?
Br
Reactions of this type, however, usually fail. Sodium hydride is not only too basic (think E2 instead 
of SN2) but is also incompatible with the solvents customarily used in nucleophilic substitutions.
An approach that does work is to use hydrides of metals that are less electropositive than 
sodium; tributyltin hydride [(CH3CH2CH2CH2)3SnH], for example.
R X + (CH3CH2CH2CH2)3SnH R H + (CH3CH2CH2CH2)3SnX
Tin, with an electronegativity of 1.8 compared to 0.9 for sodium, is closer in electronegativity 
to hydrogen (2.1). Thus, the Sn–H bond is not very polar and hydrogen is transferred as ·H rather 
than :H−. The reaction proceeds by a free-radical mechanism in which the propagation steps are
R X + Sn(CH2CH2CH2CH3)3 R + X Sn(CH2CH2CH2CH3)3
R + H Sn(CH2CH2CH2CH3)3 R—H + Sn(CH2CH2CH2CH3)3
Tin hydride reduction of alkyl halides suffers from the fact that the reagent not only is used 
in stoichiometric amounts but organotin compounds present hazardous waste problems due to their 
toxicity.
In an alternative method, sodium borohydride (NaBH4)—a reducing agent commonly used 
in a number of synthetic procedures—serves as the source of hydrogen atoms in a process catalyzed 
by indium chloride (InCl3).

Conjugation in Alkadienes 
and Allylic Systems
Not all the properties of alkenes are revealed by focusing 
exclusively on the functional-group behavior of the double 
bond. A double bond can affect the properties of a second 
functional unit to which it is directly attached. It can be a 
substituent, for example, on a positively charged carbon in an 
allylic carbocation, on a carbon that bears an unpaired elec￾tron in an allylic free radical, on a negatively charged carbon 
in an allylic anion, or it can be a substituent on a second 
double bond in a conjugated diene.

Allyl is derived from the botanical name for garlic (Allium sativum). Over a 
century ago it was found that the major component obtained by distilling 
garlic oil is H2CCHCH2SSCH2CHCH2, and the word allyl was coined 
for the H2CCHCH2 group on the basis of this origin.

S11.1 The Allyl Group 387
Conjugare is a Latin verb meaning “to link or yoke together,” and allylic carbocations, 
allylic free radicals, allylic anions, and conjugated dienes are all examples of conjugated 
systems. In this chapter we’ll see how conjugation permits two functional units within 
a molecule to display a kind of reactivity that is qualitatively different from that of either 
unit alone.
11.1 The Allyl Group
Allyl is both a common name and a permissible IUPAC name for the H2CCHCH2
group. Its derivatives are better known by their functional class IUPAC names than by 
their substitutive ones:
OH
Allyl alcohol
(2-propen-1-ol)
Cl
Allyl chloride
(3-chloro-1-propene)
NH2
Allylamine
(2-propen-1-amine)
The sp3
-hybridized carbon of an allyl group is termed an allylic carbon, and atoms or 
groups attached to it are allylic substituents.
Problem 11.1
α-Terpineol is a pleasant-smelling oil obtained from pine. How many 
allylic hydrogens does it have? Is the hydroxyl group allylic?
According to the number of its electrons, an allyl unit can be a positively charged 
carbocation (H2CCHCH2
+), a neutral free radical (H2CCHCH2·), or a negatively 
charged carbanion (H2CCHCH2:
−). Each is stabilized by delocalization involving the 
π electrons in the double bond. The positive charge, negative charge, or unpaired electron 
is shared by the two carbons at opposite ends of the allyl group.

Another way to indicate this electron delocalization is via the dotted-line structures 
shown. It is important, however, to recognize that the +, −̈

dashed line applies to the unit as a whole and is shared only by its end carbons.

Sample Solution (a) First, identify the allylic unit by picking out the CCC+ sequence. Of 
the two double bonds in this structure, only the one at the left is part of CCC+. The 
double bond at the right is separated from the positively charged carbon by a CH2 group, so 
is not conjugated to it. Move electrons in pairs from the double bond toward the positively 
charged carbon to generate a second resonance structure.

The two contributing structures are not equivalent; therefore, the positive charge is not 
shared equally between C-1 and C-3. C-1 is a primary carbon, C-3 is secondary. More of the 
positive charge resides on C-3 than on C-1. The original structure (left) contributes more to 
the resonance hybrid than the other (right).
Figure 11.1 displays a valence bond description of bonding in allyl cation. The 
planar structure of H2CCHCH2
+ (a) provides a framework of σ bonds that allows for 
continuous overlap of the 2p orbitals of three adjacent sp2
-hybridized carbons (b and c).

+. The 
two electrons in this orbital are delocalized over three carbons.
(a) (b) (c)
π 2p π11.1 The Allyl Group 389
Until now, we have only seen π orbitals involving two carbons. Conjugated systems are 
characterized by extended π orbitals that encompass three or more atoms.
Although satisfactory for allyl cation, Figure 11.1 is insufficient for species with 
more than two π electrons because the π orbital in (c) can accommodate only two 
electrons. Molecular orbital (MO) theory, however, offers an alternative to resonance 
and valence bond theory for understanding the structure and reactions of not only 
allylic cations, but radicals (three π electrons) and anions (four π electrons) as well. 
Recalling from Section 7.2 that the number of molecular orbitals is equal to the number 
of atomic orbitals (AOs) that combine to form them, we combine the three 2p AOs, 
one from each of the three sp2
-hybridized carbons of allyl, into the system of three 
π MOs shown in Figure 11.2.
The lowest-energy orbital π1 is doubly occupied in all three species; whereas π2 is 
vacant in allyl cation, singly occupied in allyl radical, and doubly occupied in allyl anion. 
When H2CCHCH2
+ reacts with a nucleophile, electrons flow from the nucleophile to 
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, or LUMO, which in this case is π2. Because 
π2 is characterized by a node at C-2, only C-1 and C-3 are available for bonding of a 
nucleophile to allyl cation. At the other extreme, electrons flow from the highest occu￾pied molecular orbital, or HOMO (π2), of allyl anion when it bonds to an electrophile. 
Again, only C-1 or C-3 can participate in bond formation because of the node at C-2. 
The results are similar for bond formation in allyl radical.
Erich Hückel was a German physical 
chemist first known for collaborating 
with Peter Debye in developing what 
remains the most widely accepted 
theory of electrolyte solutions, then 
later for applying molecular orbital 
theory to conjugated hydrocarbons, 
especially aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Chapter 12).

11.2 SN1 and SN2 Reactions of Allylic Halides
Much of our understanding about conjugation effects in allylic systems comes from rate 
and product studies of nucleophilic substitution, especially those that take place by the 
SN1 mechanism. Allylic halides react faster than their nonallylic counterparts in both SN1 
and SN2 reactions, but for different reasons. SN1 reactions will be described first, followed 
later in this section by SN2.
Relative SN1 Rates Under SN1 conditions such as solvolysis in ethanol, the tertiary 
allylic chloride 3-chloro-3-methyl-1-butene reacts over 100 times faster than tert-butyl 
chloride. Both reactions follow a first-order rate law, and their relative rates reflect the 
greater stability of [(CH3)2CCHCH2]
+ compared with (CH3)3C+.

Allylic carbocations are more stable than simple alkyl cations and a vinyl group 
(H2CCH) is a better carbocation-stabilizing substituent than methyl (CH3). Although 
H2CCHCH2
+, for example, is a primary carbocation, it is about as stable as a typical 
secondary carbocation such as (CH3)2CH+.

Mechanism 11.1 applies the SN1 mechanism to this hydrolysis. Its key features are 
carbocation formation in step 1 and bonding of the nucleophile (water) to the carbocation 
in step 2. The oxygen of water can bond to either end of the allylic unit, but does so at 
different rates. The oxygen of water bonds to the carbon that carries more of the positive 
charge, giving the tertiary alcohol as the major product. Figure 11.3 illustrates the effect 
that methyl substituents have on the allyl cation by comparing the electrostatic potential 
maps of allyl cation, 1-methylallyl cation, and 1,1-dimethylallyl cation. The minor prod￾uct, a primary alcohol, results when the oxygen of water bonds to the primary carbon.11.2 SN1 and SN2 Reactions of Allylic Halides 391

In a parallel experiment, hydrolysis of the isomeric primary allylic chloride 1-chloro￾3-methyl-2-butene gave the same two alcohols as 3-chloro-3-methyl-1-butene and in the

The mechanism of this reaction is exactly the same as that shown for 3-chloro-3-methyl￾1-butene in Mechanism 11.1 except the structure of the starting allylic halide is different. 
The same carbocation is the common intermediate in both cases.
Reactions such as these are described as proceeding with allylic rearrangement.
They differ from the carbocation rearrangements of earlier chapters in that the latter 
involve structural changes resulting from atom or group migrations. Changes in electron
positions are responsible for allylic rearrangements.
Problem 11.4
What three alcohols are the expected products of the SN1 hydrolysis of 
the compound shown?
Be sure you understand that we are not dealing with an equilibrium between 
two isomeric carbocations. There is only one allylic carbocation. It has a delocalized 
structure, so is not adequately represented by a single Lewis formula but by con￾tributing resonance structures that differ in their distribution of positive charge. 
Molecular orbital theory is also consistent with the fact that the terminal carbons 
of the allyl unit are the main sites of interaction with an incoming nucleophile 
because, as we saw in Figure 11.2, these are the only ones that contribute a p orbital 
to the LUMO.

The three halides that react at the fastest rates are all allylic; the three slowest are not. 
Within each group, the typical SN2 order (primary faster than secondary) is observed.
The greater SN2 reactivity of allylic halides results from a combination of two 
effects: steric and electronic. Sterically, a CH2Cl group is less crowded and more reactive 
when it is attached to the sp2
-hybridized carbon of a vinyl group compared with being 
attached to the sp3
-hybridized carbon of an alkyl group. Electronically, molecular orbital 
treatments such as seen for the SN2 mechanism in Section 6.3 are readily adapted to allyl 
chloride. According to that picture, electrons flow from the HOMO of the nucleophile 
to the LUMO of the alkyl halide.

Because the LUMO of allyl chloride extends over all three carbons of the allyl group, it

a lower activation energy, and a faster rate of reaction.

or by the π-electron molecular orbital approximation. Both show the unpaired electron 
equally distributed between C-1 and C-3. In the π-electron approximation this unpaired 
electron singly occupies π2, which is characterized by a node at C-2.
π2 of allyl radical
Bond formation of allyl radical with some other species can occur only at either end of 
the allyl unit because these are the sites of the greatest unpaired electron probability. A 
molecular orbital calculation of the spin density of allyl radical reinforces these interpre￾tations (Figure 11.4).
Delocalization of the unpaired electron stabilizes allylic radicals and causes reac￾tions that generate them to proceed more readily than those that give simple alkyl radicals. 
Spin density is a measure of the 
unpaired electron density at an atom 
and was introduced in Section 10.1.Compare, for example, the bond dissociation enthalpies of the primary CH bonds of 
propane and propene:

Breaking an allylic CH bond in propene requires 55 kJ/mol (13 kcal/mol) less energy 
than a bond to a primary hydrogen in propane. Allyl radical is stabilized by π-electron 
delocalization; propyl radical is not.
Problem 11.7
Rank the CH bonds of trans-3-hexene in order of decreasing bond dissociation enthalpy.
The greater stability of allylic radicals relative to their alkyl counterparts suggests 
that free-radical halogenation of alkenes should be both feasible and regioselective for 
the allylic position. Although, as we have already seen, the typical reaction of alkenes 
with halogens at room temperature and below is electrophilic addition to the double 
bond, free-radical substitution is favored at high temperature. The industrial-scale prepa￾ration of allyl chloride involves heating propene and chlorine at 300–500°C.

11.3 Allylic Free-Radical Halogenation 395396 Chapter 11 Conjugation in Alkadienes and Allylic Systems
N-Bromosuccinimide provides a low concentration of molecular bromine, which reacts 
with alkenes by a mechanism analogous to that of other free-radical halogenations.
Problem 11.8
Assume that N-bromosuccinimide serves as a source of Br2, and write equations for the 
propagation steps in the formation of 3-bromocyclohexene by allylic bromination of cyclohexene.
 Although allylic bromination and chlorination offer methods for attaching a reac￾tive functional group to a hydrocarbon framework, we need to be aware of two important 
limitations. For allylic halogenation to be effective in a particular synthesis:
1. All the allylic hydrogens in the starting alkene must be equivalent, and
2. Both resonance forms of the allylic radical must be equivalent.
In the two examples cited so far, the chlorination of propene and the bromination of 
cyclohexene, both requirements are met.
All the allylic hydrogens of propene H2C CH CH3
are equivalent.
The two resonance forms of allyl H2C CH CH2 H2C CH CH2

Problem 11.9
Evaluate 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-butene as a candidate for free-radical bromination. How many allylic 
bromides would you expect to result from its treatment with N-bromosuccinimide?
11.4 Allylic Anions
Like allyl cation and allyl radical, allyl anion is planar and stabilized by electron delocal￾ization. The unshared pair plus the two π electrons of the double bond are shared by the 
three carbons of the allyl unit. This delocalization can be expressed in resonance terms
H2C CH CH2 H2C or H H

or by molecular orbital methods. According to the π-electron approximation, the four π 
electrons of allyl anion are distributed in pairs between the two bonding orbitals π1 and 
π2 as shown earlier in Figure 11.2. The electrons in the HOMO π2 interact equally with 
C-1 and C-3. Thus, the negative charge is shared equally by these two carbons, and both 
are equivalent reactive sites.
The extent to which electron delocalization stabilizes allyl anion can be assessed 
by comparing the pKas of propane and propene.
H + H pKa ≈ 50

Although the pKa values of hydrocarbons are subject to a fair degree of uncertainty and 
vary according to how they are measured, all of the methods agree that allyl anion is a 
much weaker base than propyl anion.
The electrostatic potential maps in Figure 11.5 illustrate the greater dispersal of 
negative charge in allyl anion versus propyl anion. In addition to the stabilization that 
results from electron delocalization of the π electrons, C-2 of propene is sp2
-hybridized,

electronegativity of carbon increases 
with increasing s character.

11.5 Classes of Dienes: Conjugated and Otherwise
As described in Sections 11.1–11.4, allylic carbocations, radicals, and anions are conju￾gated π-electron systems involved as intermediates in chemical reactions. The remaining 
sections of this chapter focus on stable molecules, especially hydrocarbons called 
conjugated dienes, which contain two CC units joined by a single bond as in 
CCCC. It begins by comparing their structure and stability to isolated dienes, in 
which the two CC units are separated from each other by one or more sp3
-hybridized 
carbons, and to cumulated dienes, or cumulenes (also called allenes), in which two 
CC units share a single carbon (CCC).

double bonds:
Isolated double bonds
Conjugated double bonds
Isolated double bonds are separated from other double bonds by at least one sp3
-hybridized 
carbon. Conjugated double bonds are joined by a single bond.
Alkadienes are named according to the IUPAC rules by replacing the -ane ending 
of an alkane with -adiene and locating the position of each double bond by number. 
Compounds with three carbon–carbon double bonds are called alkatrienes and named 
accordingly, those with four double bonds are alkatetraenes, and so on.
11.6 Relative Stabilities of Dienes
Which is the most stable arrangement of double bonds in an alkadiene: isolated, conju￾gated, or cumulated?
As we have seen before (Section 8.3), the relative stabilities of alkenes can be 
assessed from their heats of hydrogenation. Figure 11.6 compares these values for 
the isolated diene 1,4-pentadiene and its conjugated isomer (E)-1,3-pentadiene. The 
figure shows that an isolated pair of double bonds behaves much like two indepen￾dent alkene units. The measured heat of hydrogenation of the two double bonds in 
1,4-pentadiene is 252 kJ/mol (60.2 kcal/mol), exactly twice the heat of hydrogenation 
of 1-pentene. Furthermore, the heat evolved on hydrogenation of each double bond 
must be 126 kJ/mol (30.1 kcal/mol) because 1-pentene is an intermediate in the 
hydrogenation of 1,4-pentadiene to pentane.
By the same reasoning, hydrogenation of the terminal double bond in the conju￾gated diene (E)-1,3-pentadiene releases only 111 kJ/mol (26.5 kcal/mol) when it is 
hydrogenated to (E)-2-pentene. Hydrogenation of the terminal double bond in the conjugated Potential energy

Heats of hydrogenation in kJ/mol

stabilities of isolated versus conjugated

(solid lines) of the four compounds 
shown gives the values shown by 
the dashed lines for the heats of 
hydrogenation of the terminal double 
bond of 1,4-pentadiene and 
(E)-1,3-pentadiene. A conjugated 
double bond is approximately 15 kJ/mol 
(3.6 kcal/mol) more stable than an 
isolated double bond.400 Chapter 11 Conjugation in Alkadienes and Allylic Systems
diene evolves 15 kJ/mol (3.6 kcal/mol) less heat than hydrogenation of a terminal double 
bond in the diene with isolated double bonds. A conjugated double bond is 15 kJ/mol 
(3.6 kcal/mol) more stable than an isolated double bond. This increased stability due to 
conjugation is the delocalization energy, resonance energy, or conjugation energy.
The cumulated double bonds of an allenic system are of relatively high energy. The 
heat of hydrogenation of allene is more than twice that of propene.

Problem 11.12
Another way in which energies of isomers may be compared is by their heats of combustion. 
Match the heat of combustion with the appropriate diene.
Dienes: 1,2-Pentadiene, (E)-1,3-pentadiene, 1,4-pentadiene
Heats of combustion: 3186 kJ/mol (761 kcal/mol), 3217 kJ/mol (769 kcal/mol), 
3251 kJ/mol (776 kcal/mol)
Thus, the order of alkadiene stability decreases in the order: conjugated diene (most 
stable) → isolated diene → cumulated diene (least stable). To understand this ranking, 
we need to look at structure and bonding in alkadienes in more detail.
11.7 Bonding in Conjugated Dienes
At 146 pm (1.46 Å) the C-2C-3 distance in 1,3-butadiene is relatively short for a 
carbon–carbon single bond. This is most reasonably seen as a hybridization effect. In 
ethane both carbons are sp3
-hybridized and are separated by a distance of 153 pm (1.53 Å). 
The carbon–carbon single bond in propene unites sp3
- and sp2
-hybridized carbons and 
is shorter than that of ethane. Both C-2 and C-3 are sp2
-hybridized in 1,3-butadiene, and 
a decrease in bond distance between them reflects the tendency of carbon to attract 
electrons more strongly as its s character increases.

The factor most responsible for the increased stability of conjugated double bonds 
is the greater delocalization of their π electrons compared with the π electrons of isolated 
double bonds. As shown in Figure 11.7a, the four p orbitals of the conjugated diene 
1,3-pentadiene combine to give a continuous π system, which allows each of the π electrons 
to interact with all four carbons. Continuous overlap of all four p orbitals of 1,4-pentadiene 
(Figure 11.7b) is not possible because a CH2 group separates the two alkene units and 
their π electrons are no more delocalized than they are in ethylene.

adjacent p orbitals gives an extended

(b) Isolated double bonds are separated 
from one another by one or more 
sp3
-hybridized carbons and cannot 
overlap to give an extended π orbital.11.7 Bonding in Conjugated Dienes 401
A more detailed molecular orbital picture of electron delocalization is shown for 
the case of 1,3-butadiene in Figure 11.8. The four p AOs combine to give four π MOs, 
two of which (π1 and π2) are bonding; each of these π orbitals contains two electrons. 
The two antibonding orbitals are unoccupied.
Electron delocalization in 1,3-butadiene is most effective when all four carbons lie 
in the same plane. Two conformations, called s-cis and s-trans, permit this coplanarity.

the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital is the LUMO.402 Chapter 11 Conjugation in Alkadienes and Allylic Systems
The s-trans conformation is 12 kJ/mol (2.8 kcal/mol) more stable than s-cis, with van 
der Waals strain between the C-1 and C-4 “interior” hydrogens contributing to the 
decreased stability of the s-cis conformation. The two conformations are interconvertible 
by rotation about the C-2C-3 single bond with an activation energy for the s-trans → 
s-cis conversion of 25 kJ/mol (6 kcal/mol). This energy cost reflects the loss of π-electron 
delocalization in going from a coplanar CCCC arrangement to a nonplanar one 
at the transition state.
11.8 Bonding in Allenes
The three carbons of allene lie in a straight line, with relatively short carbon–carbon 
bond distances of 131 pm (1.31 Å). The middle carbon, because it has two π bonds, is 
sp-hybridized. The end carbons of allene are sp2
-hybridized.

As Figure 11.9 illustrates, allene is nonplanar; the plane of one HCH unit is perpen￾dicular to the plane of the other. Figure 11.9 also shows the reason for this unusual 
geometry. The 2p orbital of each of the terminal carbons overlaps with a different 2p
orbital of the central carbon. Because the 2p orbitals of the central carbon are per￾pendicular to each other, the perpendicular nature of the two HCH units follows 
naturally.
The nonplanarity of allenes has an interesting stereochemical consequence. 
1,3-Disubstituted allenes are chiral; they are not superimposable on their mirror images. 
Van der Waals strain between interior 
hydrogens increases strain energy of 
the s-cis conformation of 1,3-butadiene.

The enantiomers shown are related as a right-hand and left-hand screw, respectively.
Chiral allenes are another example of molecules that are chiral, but do not contain 
a chirality center. Like the chiral biaryl derivatives that were described in Section 4.13, 
chiral allenes contain an axis of chirality. The axis of chirality in 2,3-pentadiene is a line 
passing through the three carbons of the allene unit (carbons 2, 3, and 4).

Is 2-methyl-2,3-pentadiene chiral? What about 2-chloro-2,3-pentadiene?
11.9 Preparation of Dienes
The conjugated diene 1,3-butadiene is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber for 
automobile tires and is prepared on an industrial scale in vast quantities. In the 
presence of a suitable catalyst, butane undergoes thermal dehydrogenation to yield

As we saw in Chapter 7, dehydrations and dehydrohalogenations are typically regio￾selective in the direction that leads to the most stable double bond. Conjugated 
dienes are more stable than isolated dienes and are formed faster via a lower-energy 
transition state.

Southeast Asia. One, Hevea brasiliensis, is a source of nat￾ural rubber and was imported from Brazil in the nineteenth cen￾tury. The other, Isonandra gutta, is native to Sumatra, Java, and 
Borneo and gives a latex from which gutta-percha is obtained.
Some 500 years ago during voyages to what are now the 
Americas, European crews saw children playing with balls made 
from the latex of trees that grew there. Later, Joseph Priestley 
called this material “rubber” to describe its ability to erase pencil 
marks by rubbing, and in 1823 Charles Macintosh demonstrated 
how rubber could be used to make waterproof coats and shoes. 
Shortly thereafter Michael Faraday determined an empirical for￾mula of C5H8 for rubber. It was eventually determined that rubber 
is a polymer of 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene.
2-Methyl-1,3-butadiene
(common name: isoprene) 
The structure of rubber corresponds to 1,4 addition of several 
thousand isoprene units to one another:
All the double bonds in rubber have the Z configuration.
Gutta-percha is a different polymer of isoprene. Its chains 
are shorter than those of natural rubber and have E double bonds.
Gutta-percha is flexible when heated, but is harder and more 
durable than rubber at room temperature. It was, at one time, the 
material of choice for golf ball covers. Gutta-percha’s main claim 
to fame though lies out of sight on the floors of the world’s oceans. 
The first global communication network—the telegraph—relied 
on insulated copper wire to connect senders and receivers. 
Gutta-percha proved so superior to natural rubber in resisting 
deterioration, especially underwater, that it coated the thousands 
of miles of insulated telegraph cable that connected most of the 
countries of the world by the close of the nineteenth century.
In natural rubber the attractive forces between neighbor￾ing polymer chains are relatively weak, and there is little overall 
structural order. The chains slide easily past one another when 
stretched and return, in time, to their disordered state when the 
distorting force is removed. The ability of a substance to recover 
its original shape after distortion is its elasticity. The elasticity of 
natural rubber is satisfactory only within a limited temperature 
range; it is too rigid when cold and too sticky when warm to be 
very useful. Rubber’s elasticity is improved by vulcanization, a 
process discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839. When natural 
rubber is heated with sulfur, a chemical reaction occurs in which 
neighboring polyisoprene chains become connected through 
covalent bonds to sulfur. Although these sulfur “bridges” permit 
only limited movement of one chain with respect to another, 
their presence ensures that the rubber will snap back to its orig￾inal shape once the distorting force is removed.
As the demand for rubber increased, so did the chemical 
industry’s efforts to prepare a synthetic substitute. One of the 
first elastomers (a synthetic polymer that possesses elasticity) 
to find a commercial niche was neoprene, discovered by 
chemists at Du Pont in 1931. Neoprene is produced by free￾radical polymerization of 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene and has the 
greatest variety of applications of any elastomer. Some uses 
include electrical insulation, conveyer belts, hoses, and 
weather balloons.

The elastomer produced in greatest amount is styrene-butadiene 
rubber (SBR). Annually, just under 109
 lb of SBR is produced in the 
United States, most of which is used in automobile tires. As its 
name suggests, SBR is prepared from styrene and 1,3-butadiene. 
It is an example of a copolymer, a polymer assembled from two or 
more different monomers. Free-radical polymerization of a mix￾ture of styrene and 1,3-butadiene gives SBR.

Coordination polymerization of isoprene using Ziegler–Natta 
catalyst systems (Section 15.15) gives a material similar in proper￾ties  to natural rubber, as does polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. 
Poly(1,3-butadiene) is produced in about two thirds the quantity of 
SBR each year. It, too, finds its principal use in tires.

11.10 Addition of Hydrogen Halides to Conjugated Dienes
Electrophilic addition is the characteristic reaction of alkenes, and conjugated dienes 
undergo addition with the same electrophiles that react with alkenes, and by similar 
mechanisms. Hydrogen chloride, for example, adds to the diene unit of 1,3-cyclopentadiene 
to give 3-chlorocyclopentene. Mechanism 11.3 is analogous to the electrophilic addition 
of HCl to alkenes.

Problem 11.15
Carbons 1 and 4 of 1,3-cyclopentadiene are equivalent and give the same carbocation on 
protonation. Likewise, carbons 2 and 3 are equivalent. Write the structure of the carbocation 
formed by protonation of C-2 or C-3 to verify that it is not allylic and therefore not as stable 
as the one formed by protonation of C-1 or C-4.
Both resonance contributors of the allylic carbocation from 1,3-cyclopentadiene are 
equivalent and attack by chloride at either of the carbons that share the positive charge 
gives the same product, 3-chlorocyclopentene.
Such is not the case with 1,3-butadiene. Protonation of the diene is still regiospe￾cific for the end carbon, but the two resonance forms of the resulting allylic carbocation 
are not equivalent.

Both products are formed from the same allylic carbocation. The major product corre￾sponds to addition of a proton to C-1 of 1,3-butadiene and bromine to C-2. This mode 
of addition is called 1,2 addition. The minor product has its proton and bromide at C-1 
and C-4, respectively, and is formed by 1,4 addition.
At −80°C the product from 1,2 addition predominates because it is formed faster 
than the 1,4-addition product. The product distribution is governed by kinetic control.
At room temperature, a much different product ratio is observed. Under these con￾ditions the 1,4-addition product predominates.

To understand why temperature affects the product composition, an important fact 
must be added. The 1,2- and 1,4-addition products interconvert at elevated temperature 
in the presence of hydrogen bromide.

At 45°C, for example, interconversion is rapid and gives an equilibrium mixture contain￾ing 85% of the 1,4-addition product and 15% of the 1,2 product. This demonstrates that 
the 1,4 product is more stable, presumably because it has a disubstituted double bond, 
whereas the double bond in the 1,2 product is monosubstituted.
When addition occurs under conditions in which the products can equilibrate, 
the composition of the reaction mixture no longer reflects their relative rates of formation 
but tends to reflect their relative stabilities. Reactions of this type are governed by 
thermodynamic control.11.11 Halogen Addition to Dienes 407
The energy diagram of Figure 11.10 illustrates kinetic and thermodynamic control 
in the addition of hydrogen bromide to 1,3-butadiene. At low temperature, addition takes 
place irreversibly. Isomerization is slow because insufficient thermal energy is available 
to permit the products to surmount the energy barrier for ionization. At higher tempera￾tures isomerization is possible, and the more stable product predominates.
Before leaving this section, we should point out that the numbers in the terms 1,2 
and 1,4 addition refer to carbons within the CCCC structural unit wherever it may 
be in the molecule and not to the IUPAC numbering. For example, 1,2 and 1,4 addition 
to 2,4-hexadiene would involve the carbons shown.

11.12 The Diels–Alder Reaction
We’ve already mentioned the value of carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions in organic 
synthesis. Imagine how useful it would be to have a reaction in which two carbon–carbon 
bonds are formed in a single operation simply by combining two compounds without 
having to add acids, bases, or other catalysts. The Diels–Alder reaction, which is the 
conjugate addition of an alkene to a diene, is one such reaction.

The alkene that adds to the diene is called the dienophile (“diene seeker”). The reaction 
is classified as a cycloaddition, and the product contains a cyclohexene ring.
The reaction occurs in a single step, without an intermediate, by a mechanism in 
which six atoms undergo bonding changes in the same transition state by way of cyclic 
reorganization of their π electrons. Concerted (one-step) reactions such as the Diels–Alder 
cycloaddition that proceed through a cyclic transition state are called pericyclic reactions.
Effect of Substituents on the Reactivity of the Dienophile The simplest of all Diels–
Alder reactions, cycloaddition of ethylene to 1,3-butadiene, has a high activation energy 
and a low reaction rate, so does not proceed readily. However, electron-withdrawing sub￾stituents such as CO and CN, when attached directly to the double bond, activate the 
dienophile toward cycloaddition. Acrolein (H2CCHCHO), for example, reacts with 
1,3-butadiene to give a high yield of the Diels–Alder adduct at a modest temperature.

Conformational Effects on the Reactivity of the Diene The diene must be able to 
adopt the s-cis conformation in order for cycloaddition to occur. We saw in Section 11.7 
that the s-cis conformation of 1,3-butadiene is 12 kJ/mol (2.8 kcal/mol) less stable than 
the s-trans form. This is a relatively small energy difference, so 1,3-butadiene is reactive 
in the Diels–Alder reaction. Dienes that cannot readily adopt the s-cis conformation are 
less reactive. For example, 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene is a thousand times less reactive in 410 Chapter 11 Conjugation in Alkadienes and Allylic Systems
the Diels–Alder reaction than trans-1,3-pentadiene because its s-cis conformation is 
destabilized by the steric effect imposed by the additional methyl group.

Problem 11.19
2,3-Di-tert-butyl-1,3-butadiene is extremely unreactive in Diels–Alder reactions. Explain.
Cyclic conjugated dienes such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene are often used as the diene 
component in Diels–Alder reactions and are relatively reactive because the s-cis geometry 
is built into their structure.
Diels–Alder Reactions Are Stereospecific and Stereoselective The following pair of 
related cycloadditions combine to illustrate two important aspects of Diels–Alder reac￾tions. First, recall that a stereospecific reaction is one in which stereoisomeric starting 
materials yield stereoisomeric products. In the example, 1,3-cyclopentadiene reacts with 
the two stereoisomeric dienophiles, dimethyl fumarate and dimethyl maleate. Dimethyl 
fumarate has a trans double bond; dimethyl maleate’s double bond is cis.

Both reactions are stereospecific. The trans relationship between the CO2CH3 sub￾stituents in dimethyl fumarate is retained in the cycloaddition product, and the cis rela￾tionship between them is retained in the product from dimethyl maleate. The customary 
terminology in bicyclic systems describes a substituent as exo if it is oriented toward the 
smaller bridge, endo if it is oriented away from it. Thus, one CO2CH3 group is exo 
and the other endo in the dimethyl fumarate Diels–Alder adduct, while both are endo in 
the major product from dimethyl maleate, exo in the minor product.
In addition to being stereospecific, there is a stereoselective preference favoring the 
formation of endo-Diels–Alder adducts from cyclic dienes as is evident in the observed 
3:1 endo–exo ratio in the reaction of dimethyl maleate with 1,3-cyclopentadiene shown 
in the preceding equation. Such results are common and are the basis of an empirical 
rule called the endo rule or Alder rule, which holds that for a dienophile that can yield 
two diastereoisomeric Diels–Alder adducts, the adduct with an endo orientation of the 11.13 Intramolecular Diels–Alder Reactions 411
substituent predominates. Figure 11.11 illustrates the energy relationships involved in 
endo versus exo addition for the reaction of dimethyl maleate with 1,3-cyclopentadiene.
Problem 11.20

products. Write structural formulas for both and predict which one predominates.
11.13 Intramolecular Diels–Alder Reactions
Not only is the Diels–Alder reaction itself synthetically useful, it has also stimulated 
explorations of variants on its theme. The one most directly related to the traditional 
Diels–Alder reaction is an intramolecular analog in which both the diene and dienophile 
reside in the same molecule.

Intramolecular cycloaddition generates two new rings in a single operation. One of 
the new rings is, as in the intermolecular reaction, a cyclohexene; the other is typically

alkene from a noncyclic triene.

11.14 Retrosynthetic Analysis and

Diels–Alder reactions are widely used for making carbon–carbon bonds, and retrosyn￾thetic analysis can reveal opportunities for their application. If a synthetic target contains 
a cyclohexene ring, start with the double bond and use curved arrows to disconnect the 
bonds to be formed in the sought-for cycloaddition. For example:

In deciding whether the cycloaddition revealed by the disconnection is feasible or not, 
examine the alkene to make sure that it is a reactive dienophile. Usually this means that 
the double bond bears an electron-attracting group, especially CO or CN.
Problem 11.22
What diene and dienophile could you use to prepare

The number of reaction types that we have covered to this point is extensive enough 
to allow the construction of relatively complicated products from simple, readily available

O11.15 Molecular Orbital Analysis of the Diels–Alder Reaction 413
11.15 Molecular Orbital Analysis of the Diels–Alder Reaction
The conventional curved-arrow description of the Diels–Alder reaction shows a one-step 
mechanism involving a cyclic reorganization of six electrons—four from the diene plus 
two from the dienophile—in the transition state.
Diene + alkene Transition state Cyclohexene
Such a concerted process is more consistent with the stereochemical observations than 
one in which the two new σ bonds are formed in separate steps. Substituents that are cis 
in the dienophile remain cis in the product; those that are trans in the dienophile remain 
trans in the product.
Since all of the bonds are formed in the same step and only π electrons are involved, 
we can use the Hückel π-electron approximation to explore the process from a molecular 
orbital perspective and need examine only those orbitals of the reactants that are directly 
involved in bond formation. These are called the frontier orbitals and are usually the 
HOMO of one reactant and the LUMO of another. For the Diels–Alder reaction they are 
the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile and are as shown in Figure 11.12. 
The choice of this HOMO–LUMO combination is made to be consistent with the experi￾mental fact that electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile increase its reactivity and 
suggest that electrons flow from the diene to the dienophile. Notice that the symmetry 
properties of these two orbitals are such as to permit the in-phase overlap necessary for 
σ bond formation between the diene and dienophile. In MO terms, the Diels–Alder reac￾tion is classified as symmetry-allowed.
Contrast the Diels–Alder reaction with one that looks similar, the cycloaddition of 
one ethylene molecule to another to give cyclobutane.
Ethylene + ethylene Transition state Cyclobutane
Cycloadditions of alkenes are rare and likely proceed in a stepwise fashion rather than 
by the concerted process implied in the equation. Figure 11.13 shows the interaction

Pericyclic Reactions in Chemical Biology
Although pericyclic reactions are widely used in synthetic 
chemistry, there are very few pericyclic reactions that natu￾rally occur in living organisms. Chemists and chemical biolo￾gists have taken advantage of the rarity of these reactions to 
perform “bioorthogonal” chemical reactions. Bioorthogonal 
chemical reactions occur selectively in the presence of the 
plethora of reactive functional groups in biological systems, ide￾ally under conditions that are compatible with biomolecules 
(aqueous solution, temperatures 37°C and below, near neutral 
pH). These reactions have found broad applications in biology 
and medicine, including basic research in cells and in living 
organisms, preparation of antibody–drug conjugates, and for 
medical imaging.
One of the most successful and widely used bioorthogo￾nal reactions involves an azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction. 
The copper-catalyzed version of this reaction was introduced by 
Nobel Laureate K. Barry Sharpless, who coined the term “click” 
for reactions that are simple, high yielding, and environmentally 
benign. Like the Diels–Alder reaction, the azide–alkyne “click” 
reaction is a six-electron process. The four-electron component 
is the azide, and the two-electron component comes from one 
π bond of the alkyne. This class of reactions is discussed in greater 
detail in the Descriptive Passage at the end of this chapter.

Neither of these functional groups occurs naturally in bio￾polymers, so chemical biologists continue to develop methods 
to incorporate them into the target biomolecule. In one example, 
a normal metabolic pathway in an organism is co-opted into 
accepting an “unnatural” substrate that contains one of the func￾tional groups. This modified biomolecule can then be observed 
and identified using its bioorthogonal partner.

between the HOMO of one ethylene molecule and the LUMO of another. The carbons 
that are to become σ-bonded to each other experience an antibonding interaction dur￾ing cycloaddition, which raises the activation energy. The reaction is symmetry￾forbidden. Reaction, were it to occur, would take place slowly and by a mechanism 
in which the two new σ bonds are formed in separate steps rather than one involving 
a single transition state.
Focusing on HOMO–LUMO interactions can aid our understanding of many 
organic reactions. Its early development is attributed to Professor Kenichi Fukui 
(Kyoto), and its application to Diels–Alder reactions constitutes but one part of the 
Woodward–Hoffmann rules proposed by Professors R. B. Woodward (Harvard) and 
Roald Hoffmann (Cornell).
11.16 The Cope and Claisen Rearrangements
As noted in Section 11.12, reactions that proceed in a single step by way of a cyclic 
transition state are called pericyclic reactions. Diels–Alder cycloadditions are one exam￾ple of a pericyclic reaction; the Cope rearrangement is another. In general terms, the 
Cope rearrangement is the one-step thermal transformation of one 1,5-diene unit to 
another by way of a cyclic transition state.
A 1,5-diene Transition state Product of Cope 
rearrangement
The Cope rearrangement shown of 1,5-hexadiene is a special case in which the 
reactant and the product are the same. More interesting are those in which they are 
different. A particularly striking example is the case of cis-1,2-divinylcyclopropane, 
which, on attempted preparation, spontaneously rearranges to 1,4-cycloheptadiene 
even at −40°C.
cis-1,2-Divinylcyclopropane 1,4-Cycloheptadiene
−40°C
The low activation energy for this process results from the relief of angle strain as 
the cyclopropane ring undergoes partial cleavage in the transition state. Higher 
temperatures are required for relatively unstrained compounds that incorporate a 
1,5-diene unit.

A Cope rearrangement of a divinylcyclopropane derivative was the final step in a laboratory 
synthesis of (R)-(–)-dictyopterene C, a constituent of Pacific seaweed. Deduce the structure,

Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Woodward 
had already won a Nobel Prize in 1965 
for achievements in the synthesis of 
complex organic compounds, and 
only Woodward’s untimely death in 
1979 prevented recognition a second 
time in 1981.

A significant number of structural types undergo reactions analogous to the Cope re￾arrangement of 1,5-dienes. In one—called the Claisen rearrangement—allyl vinyl ethers 
are converted to carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones depending on substituents).

Problem 11.25
What is the product of the following reaction?
Thermodynamically, Cope and Claisen rearrangements differ in an important way. In 
its simplest terms, the pattern of bond types (CC single and CC double) is the same 
in both the reactant and product of a Cope rearrangement—one 1,5-diene is converted to 
an isomeric 1,5-diene—and ΔHreaction is usually small. The Claisen rearrangement of an allyl 
vinyl ether, on the other hand, converts an OCO unit in the reactant to CO at a cost 
of converting one of its CC units to CC. Inasmuch as the bond energy of CO is 
normally more than twice that of CO while the opposite holds for CC versus CC, 
Claisen rearrangements lead to stronger net bonding and tend to be exothermic.
Ludwig Claisen was a German chemist 
whose career spanned the end of the 
nineteenth century and the beginning 
of the twentieth. The Claisen name is 
associated with two other reactions in 
addition to the Claisen rearrangement. 
They are the Claisen–Schmidt reaction
(Section 21.3) and the Claisen 
condensation (Section 21.4).

This chapter focused on the effect of a carbon–carbon double bond as a stabilizing substituent on 
a positively charged carbon in an allylic carbocation, on a carbon bearing an odd electron in an 
allylic free radical, on a negatively charged carbon in an allylic anion, and on a second double 
bond in a conjugated diene.

Section 11.2 Allylic halides are more reactive than simple alkyl halides in both SN1 and SN2 
reactions. The allylic carbocation intermediates in SN1 reactions have their 
positive charge shared between the two end carbons of the allylic system. The

mixture of isomeric allylic bromides is produced.

Section 11.4 Stabilization of allylic anions by electron delocalization causes an allylic hydrogen 
to be more acidic (pKa ≈ 43) than a hydrogen in an alkane (pKa ≈ 50).
Section 11.5 Dienes are classified as having isolated, conjugated, or cumulated double bonds.
C CH2
Isolated Conjugated Cumulated
Section 11.6 Conjugated dienes are more stable than isolated dienes, and cumulated dienes 
are the least stable of all.
Section 11.7 Conjugated dienes are stabilized by electron delocalization to the extent of 
12–16 kJ/mol (3–4 kcal/mol). Overlap of the p orbitals of four adjacent 
sp2
-hybridized carbons in a conjugated diene gives an extended π system 
through which the electrons are delocalized.
The two most stable conformations of conjugated dienes are the s-cis and 
s-trans. The s-trans conformation is normally more stable than the s-cis. Both 
conformations are planar, which allows the p orbitals to overlap to give an 
extended π system.

Section 11.8 1,2-Propadiene (H2CCCH2), also called allene, is the simplest cumulated 
diene. The two π bonds in an allene share an sp-hybridized carbon and are at 
right angles to each other. Certain allenes such as 2,3-pentadiene 
(CH3CHCCHCH3) possess a chirality axis and are chiral.
Section 11.9 Dehydration and dehydrohalogenation are commonly used methods for 
preparing dienes. Elimination is regioselective and gives a conjugated diene 
rather than an isolated or cumulated one.

carbocation that can be captured by the halide nucleophile at either of the two 
sites that share the positive charge. Nucleophilic attack at the carbon adjacent to 
the one that is protonated gives the product of 1,2 addition. Capture at the

Arenes and Aromaticity
In this chapter and the next we extend our coverage of conju￾gated systems to include arenes. Arenes are hydrocarbons 
based on the benzene ring as a structural unit. Benzene, toluene,

One factor that makes conjugation in arenes special is its cyclic 
nature. A conjugated system that closes on itself can have prop￾erties that are much different from those of open-chain poly￾enes. Arenes are also referred to as aromatic hydrocarbons. 
Used in this sense, the word aromatic has nothing to do with 
odor but means instead that arenes are much more stable than 
we expect them to be based on their formulation as conjugated 
trienes. Our goal in this chapter is to develop an appreciation

the reasons for it. This chapter also examines the effect of a benzene ring as a substituent. 
The chapter following this one describes reactions that involve the ring itself.
Let’s begin by tracing the history of benzene, its origin, and its structure. Many of 
the terms we use, including aromaticity itself, are of historical origin. We’ll begin with 
the discovery of benzene.
12.1 Benzene
In 1825, Michael Faraday isolated a new hydrocarbon from illuminating gas, which Faraday 
called “bicarburet of hydrogen.” Nine years later Eilhardt Mitscherlich of the University 
of Berlin prepared the same substance by heating benzoic acid with lime and found it 
to be a hydrocarbon having the empirical formula CnHn.

Eventually, because of its relationship to benzoic acid, this hydrocarbon came to be 
named benzin, then later benzene, the name by which it is known today.
Benzoic acid had been known for several hundred years by the time of Mitscherlich’s 
experiment, having been prepared from gum benzoin, a pleasant-smelling resin used as 
incense and obtained from a tree native to Java. Similarly, toluene, the methyl derivative 
of benzene, takes its name from the South American tolu tree from which derivatives of 
it can be obtained.
Although benzene and toluene are not particularly fragrant compounds themselves, 
their origins in aromatic plant extracts led them and compounds related to them to be 
classified as aromatic hydrocarbons. Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes belong to another 
class, the aliphatic hydrocarbons. The word aliphatic comes from the Greek aleiphar
(meaning “oil” or “unguent”) and was given to hydrocarbons that were obtained by the 
chemical degradation of fats.
Benzene was isolated from coal tar by August W. von Hofmann in 1845. Coal tar 
remained the primary source for the industrial production of benzene for many years, 
until petroleum-based technologies became competitive about 1950. Current production 
is about 6 million tons per year in the United States and almost 50 million tons world￾wide. A substantial portion of this benzene is converted to styrene for use in the prepara￾tion of polystyrene plastics and films.
Toluene is also an important organic chemical. Like benzene, its early industrial 
production was from coal tar, but most of it now comes from petroleum.
12.2 The Structure of Benzene
Benzene puzzled the mid-nineteenth-century scientists who attempted to connect 
chemical properties to the still-novel concept of molecular structure. In spite of its 
C6H6 formula, benzene either failed to react with the compounds that added readily 
to alkenes and alkynes or, when it did, reacted by substitution instead. Reactions could 
be carried out that replaced one or more of its hydrogens, but benzene’s six-carbon 
core remained, prompting early chemists to regard it as a unit. What was this unit and 
why was it “special”?
In 1866, only a few years after publishing what we now recognize as the structural 
theory of organic chemistry, August Kekulé applied it to the structure of benzene. 
Kekulé’s reasoning was based upon three premises:
1. Benzene is C6H6.
2. All the hydrogens of benzene are equivalent.
3. The structural theory requires that there be four bonds to each carbon.
Faraday is better known in chemistry 
for the laws of electrolysis and in 
physics for proposing the relationship 
between electric and magnetic fields 
and for demonstrating the principle of 
electromagnetic induction.430 Chapter 12 Arenes and Aromaticity
Kekulé proposed that the six carbon atoms of benzene were joined together in a ring. 
Four bonds to each carbon could be accommodated by a system of alternating single and 
double bonds with one hydrogen on each carbon.

A flaw in the Kekulé structure for benzene was soon discovered. Kekulé’s struc￾ture requires that 1,2- and 1,6-disubstitution create different compounds (isomers).

The two substituted carbons are connected by a double bond in one structure but by a 
single bond in the other. Because no such cases of isomerism in benzene derivatives 
were known, and none could be found, Kekulé suggested that two isomeric cyclohexa￾trienes could exist but interconverted too rapidly to be separated.

We now know that benzene is not cyclohexatriene, nor is it a pair of rapidly equilibrat￾ing isomers. Benzene is planar and its carbon skeleton has the shape of a regular hexa￾gon. There is no evidence that it has alternating single and double bonds. As shown in 
Figure 12.1, all of the carbon–carbon bonds are the same length and the 120° bond 
angles correspond to perfect sp2
 hybridization. Moreover, the 139 pm (1.39 Å) bond 
distances in benzene are exactly midway between the typical sp2
–sp2
 single-bond distance 
of 146 pm (1.46 Å) and the sp2
–sp2
 double-bond distance of 134 pm (1.34 Å).
The two Kekulé structures for benzene have the same arrangement of atoms, but 
differ in the placement of electrons. Thus, they are resonance forms, and neither one by 
itself correctly describes the bonding in the actual molecule. As a hybrid of the two Kekulé
structures, benzene is often represented by a hexagon containing an inscribed circle.

The circle-in-a-hexagon symbol was first suggested by the British chemist Sir Robert 
Robinson to represent the six delocalized π electrons of the three double bonds. Robinson’s 
symbol is a convenient shorthand device, but Kekulé-type formulas are better for keeping 
track of electrons, especially in chemical reactions.
Problem 12.1
Write structural formulas for toluene (C6H5CH3) and for benzoic acid (C6H5CO2H) (a) as 
resonance hybrids of two Kekulé forms and (b) with the Robinson symbol.
In 1861, Johann Josef Loschmidt, who 
was later to become a professor at the 
University of Vienna, privately 
published a book containing a 
structural formula for benzene similar 
to the one Kekulé would propose five 
years later. Loschmidt’s book reached 
few readers.
Robinson won the 1947 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for studies of natural 
products. Robinson may also have 
been the first to use curved arrows to 
track electron movement.

Because the carbons that are singly bonded in one resonance form are doubly 
bonded in the other, the resonance description is consistent with the observed carbon–
carbon bond distances in benzene. These distances not only are all identical but also are 
intermediate between typical single-bond and double-bond lengths.
We have come to associate electron delocalization with increased stability. On that basis 
alone, benzene ought to be stabilized. It differs from other conjugated systems that we have 
seen, however, in that its π electrons are delocalized over a cyclic conjugated system. Both 
Kekulé structures of benzene are of equal energy, and one of the principles of resonance 
theory is that stabilization is greatest when the contributing structures are of similar energy. 
Cyclic conjugation in benzene, then, leads to a greater stabilization than is observed in non￾cyclic conjugated trienes. How much greater can be estimated from heats of hydrogenation.
12.3 The Stability of Benzene
Hydrogenation of benzene and other arenes is more difficult than hydrogenation of alkenes 
and alkynes. Two of the more active catalysts are rhodium and platinum, and it is possible 
to hydrogenate arenes in the presence of these catalysts at room temperature and modest 
pressure. Benzene consumes three molar equivalents of hydrogen to give cyclohexane.

Nickel catalysts, although less expensive than rhodium and platinum, are also less active. 
Hydrogenation of arenes in the presence of nickel requires high temperatures (100–200°C) 
and pressures (100 atm).
The measured heat of hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is the same regardless 
of the catalyst and is 208 kJ/mol (49.8 kcal/mol). To put this value into perspective, compare 
it with the heats of hydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, as shown in 
Figure 12.2. The most striking feature of Figure 12.2 is that the heat of hydrogenation of Potential energy

benzene, with three “double bonds,” is less than the heat of hydrogenation of the two 
double bonds of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The heat of hydrogenation of benzene is 152 kJ/mol 
(36 kcal/ mol) less than expected for a hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene with noninter￾acting double bonds. This is the resonance energy of benzene. It is a measure of how 
much more stable benzene is than would be predicted on the basis of its formulation as 
a pair of rapidly interconverting 1,3,5-cyclohexatrienes.
We reach a similar conclusion when comparing benzene with the noncyclic conju￾gated triene (Z)-1,3,5-hexatriene. Here we compare two real molecules, both conjugated 
trienes, but one is cyclic and the other is not. The heat of hydrogenation of (Z)-1,3,5-
hexatriene is 337 kJ/mol (80.5 kcal/mol), a value which is 129 kJ/mol (30.7 kcal/mol) 
greater than that of benzene.

The precise value of the resonance energy of benzene depends, as comparisons with 
1,3,5-cyclohexatriene and (Z)-1,3,5-hexatriene illustrate, on the compound chosen as the 
reference. What is important is that the resonance energy of benzene is quite large, six to 
ten times that of a conjugated triene. It is this very large increment of resonance energy 
that places benzene and related compounds in a separate category that we call aromatic.
Problem 12.2
The heats of hydrogenation of cycloheptene and 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene are 110 kJ/mol 
(26.3 kcal/mol) and 305 kJ/mol (73.0 kcal/mol), respectively. In both cases cycloheptane is 
the product. What is the resonance energy of 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene? How does it compare 
with the resonance energy of benzene?
12.4 Bonding in Benzene
In the valence bond approach, the planar structure of benzene suggests sp2
 hybridization 
of carbon and the framework of σ bonds shown in Figure 12.3a. In addition to its three 
sp2
 orbitals, each carbon has a half-filled 2p orbital that can participate in π bonding by 
overlap with its counterpart on each of two adjacent carbons. Figure 12.3b shows the 
continuous π system that results from overlap of these orbitals and provides for delocal￾ization of the π electrons over all six carbons.
The valence bond picture of benzene with six electrons in a delocalized π orbital 
is a useful, but superficial, one. Only two electrons can occupy a single orbital, be it an 
atomic orbital or a molecular orbital. The molecular orbital picture shown in Figure 12.4 
does not suffer from this defect. We learned in Section 2.4 that when AOs combine to 
give MOs, the final number of MOs must equal the original number of AOs. Thus, the 
six 2p AOs of benzene combine to give six π MOs.
The orbitals in Figure 12.4 are arranged in order of increasing energy. Three orbit￾als are bonding; three are antibonding. Each of the three bonding MOs contains two 
electrons, accounting for the six π electrons of benzene. There are no electrons in the 
antibonding MOs. Benzene is said to have a closed-shell π electron configuration.
Recall that a wave function changes sign on passing through a nodal plane and is 
zero at a node (Section 1.1). In addition to the molecular plane, which contains a nodal 
surface common to all of them, five of the six π orbitals of benzene are characterized 
by nodal planes perpendicular to the molecule. The lowest-energy orbital π1 has no such 
additional nodal surface; all of its p orbital interactions are bonding. The two other bond￾ing orbitals π2 and π3 each have one nodal surface perpendicular to the molecule. The 
next three orbitals π4*, π5*, and π6* are antibonding and have, respectively, 2, 2, and 
3 nodal planes perpendicular to the molecular plane. In the highest-energy orbital π6*, 
all interactions between adjacent p orbitals are antibonding.
(b)
Figure 12.3
(a) The framework of bonds shown in 
the tube model of benzene are σ bonds. 
(b) Each carbon is sp2
-hybridized and 
has a half-filled 2p orbital perpendicular 
to the σ framework. Overlap of the 2p
orbitals generates a π system 
encompassing the entire ring.
(a)12.4 Bonding in Benzene 433
The pattern of orbital energies is different for benzene from the pattern it would have 
if the six π electrons were confined to three noninteracting double bonds. The delocalization 
provided by cyclic conjugation in benzene causes its π electrons to be held more strongly 
than they would be in the absence of cyclic conjugation. Stronger binding of its π electrons 
is the factor most responsible for the special stability—the aromaticity—of benzene.
But as the regions of high electron density above and below the plane of the ring 
in the electrostatic potential map (Figure 12.5) show, the π electrons are less strongly 
held than the electrons in the CH bonds. In Chapter 13 we will see how this fact 
governs the characteristic chemical reactivity of benzene and its relatives.
Later in this chapter we’ll explore the criteria for aromaticity in more detail to see 
how they apply to cyclic polyenes of different ring sizes. The next several sections intro￾duce us to the chemistry of compounds that contain a benzene ring as a structural unit. 
We’ll start with how we name them.

12.5 Substituted Derivatives of Benzene

In these examples the name of the parent benzene derivative determines the carbon at 
which numbering begins: anisole has its methoxy group at C-1, toluene its methyl group 
at C-1, and aniline its amino group at C-1. The direction of numbering is chosen to give 
the next substituted position the lowest number irrespective of what substituent it bears. 
The order of appearance of substituents in the name is alphabetical. When no simple 
parent other than benzene is appropriate, positions are numbered so as to give the lowest 
locant at the first point of difference. Thus, each of the following examples is named as 
a 1,2,4-trisubstituted derivative of benzene rather than as a 1,3,4-derivative:

12.6 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Members of a class of arenes called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons possess sub￾stantial resonance energies because each is a collection of benzene rings fused together.
Naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene are the three simplest members of this 
class. They are all present in coal tar, a mixture of organic substances formed by heating 
coal at about 1000°C in the absence of air. Naphthalene is bicyclic and its two benzene 
rings share a common side. Anthracene and phenanthrene are both tricyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons. Anthracene has three rings fused in a “linear” fashion; an “angular” fusion 
characterizes phenanthrene. The structural formulas of naphthalene, anthracene, and 
phenanthrene are shown along with the numbering system used to name their substituted 
derivatives:

A large number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are known. Many have been

Benzo[a]pyrene, for example, is present in tobacco smoke, contaminates food cooked on 
barbecue grills, and collects in the soot of chimneys. Benzo[a]pyrene is a carcinogen (a

mutations leading to the uncontrolled growth of certain cells.

n general, the term nanoscale applies to dimensions on the 
order of 1–100 nanometers (1 nm = 10–9 m), and one goal of 
nanotechnology is to develop useful nanoscale devices (nano￾devices). Because typical covalent bonds range from 0.1  to 0.2 nm, 
chemical structures hold promise as candidates upon which to base 
nanodevices. Among them, much recent attention has been given 
to carbon-containing materials and even elemental carbon itself.
Until 1985, chemists recognized two elementary forms 
(allotropes) of carbon: diamond and graphite (Figure 12.6). Then, 
Professors Harold W. Kroto (University of Sussex), Robert F. Curl, 
and Richard E. Smalley (both of Rice University) reported that 
laser-induced evaporation of graphite gave a species with a 
molecular formula of C60 and proposed the spherical cluster of 
carbon atoms now called buckminsterfullerene (Figure 12.7) for it. 
Other closed carbon clusters, some larger than C60 and some 
smaller, were also formed in the experiment. These forms of carbon 
are now known as fullerenes, and Kroto, Smalley, and Curl were 
awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering them.
Research on fullerenes carried out at NEC Corporation 
(Japan) and at IBM (United States) led in 1991 to the isolation of 
fibrous clusters of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) 
(Figure 12.8). SWCNTs have since been joined by multiwalled 
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Figure 12.9) as well as nanotubes 
containing elements other than carbon.
CNTs are of interest because of their electrical and 
mechanical properties, and functionally modified ones are being 
examined in applications ranging from medical diagnosis and 
therapy to photovoltaic systems. Methods for adding functional￾ity to CNTs include both covalent attachment of a reactive group 
and noncovalent coating of the outer surface of the CNT with a 
substance that itself bears a functional substituent.
Graphene is the most recent form of elemental carbon to 
emerge as a nanomaterial. As its name suggests, graphene is 
related to graphite in that graphite is an assembly of many gra￾phene layers held together by van der Waals forces. The suc￾cessful separation of single sheets of graphene was recognized 
with the award of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics to Andre Geim 
and Konstantin Novoselov of the University of Manchester. Much 
attention is being directed toward producing it on a scale that 
would make it available for use in novel materials and as a supe￾rior substitute for silicon in electronic devices.

12.7 Physical Properties of Arenes
In general, arenes resemble other hydrocarbons in their physical properties. They are 
nonpolar, insoluble in water, and less dense than water. The boiling point of benzene is 
not much different from that of similar hydrocarbons and suggests that the aggregate 
intermolecular forces in the liquid phase are about equal for all of them.

The intermolecular attractive forces in benzene have received considerable attention 
and prompted experimental and computational studies of benzene dimer, formed by non￾covalent association between two benzene molecules. Figure 12.10 shows four geometries 
for this species. In (a) and (b) the rings are parallel to each other; in (c) and (d) they are 
perpendicular.
The parallel alignment of the rings in (a) and (b), referred to as π–π stacking, is 
destabilizing due to repulsion between the π electron systems of the two benzenes and 
subtracts from various stabilizing interactions such as intermolecular van der Waals 
attractive forces. Displacement of one ring versus the other reduces this electron–electron 
repulsion, making (b) more stable than (a). Both perpendicular geometries (c) and (d) 
avoid the repulsive π–π interaction and are more stable than the parallel dimers, with (c) 
slightly more stable than (d). The spread in energies among the four benzene dimers, 
however, is only a few kilojoules per mole, and other factors can tip the balance in favor 
of parallel versus perpendicular geometries when substituents are present.
In the solid phase, benzene molecules pack together in what is known as a 
“herringbone” pattern characterized by a combination of stacked, side-by-side, and 
perpendicular arrangements between molecules (Figure 12.11).

Polycyclic aromatic compounds have significantly higher melting points than other 
hydrocarbons of similar size. The melting point of naphthalene is much higher than that 
of cyclodecane, and anthracene’s is much higher than cyclotetradecane’s.

Cyclodecane

Anthracene

This reflects the increasing preference for parallel arrangements in the solid state of 
aromatic hydrocarbons larger than benzene. Intermolecular attractive forces like those in 
the perpendicular herringbone arrangement of benzene are outnumbered by van der 
Waals attractions in parallel displaced arrangements of polycyclic aromatics.
The stacking of graphene layers in graphite (see Figure 12.6 in the boxed essay 
Fullerenes, Nanotubes, and Graphene) is an example of such packing on a grand scale.
The three-dimensional shapes of proteins and nucleic acids can bring remote 
aromatic rings close enough in space so that interactions between them can contribute 
to the overall shape of the molecule. In general though, more familiar forces exert 
a greater influence than π–π stacking. We explore these forces in more detail in 
Chapters 25 and 26.
12.8 The Benzyl Group
A benzene ring can behave in two different ways in a chemical reaction; it can be a 
functional group in its own right or it can be a substituent that affects a reaction elsewhere 
in the molecule. In the most common case, this “elsewhere” is the carbon directly 
attached to the ring—the benzylic carbon.
Benzylic carbocations, radicals, and anions resemble their allylic counterparts in 
being conjugated systems stabilized by electron delocalization. This delocalization is 
describable in resonance, valence bond, and molecular orbital terms.

Valence Bond Description of Benzyl Cation, Radical, and Anion Figure 12.12 
shows the valence bond approach to electron delocalization in benzyl cation, radical, and 
anion as the overlap of the π system of a benzene ring with, respectively, a vacant, half￾filled, and filled 2p orbital of the benzylic carbon. According to this approach, benzyl 
cation (a) is stabilized by electron donation from the π system of the ring to the vacant 
2p orbital of the benzylic carbon, thereby dispersing the positive charge and increasing 
the delocalization of the ring’s π electrons. The charge dispersal contribution is absent 
in benzyl radical (b), but the stabilization due to electron delocalization remains and 
governs the rates of free-radical reactions of alkylbenzenes. Charge dispersal returns to 
join electron delocalization in stabilizing benzyl anion (c). In this case, the benzene ring 
acts as an electron-withdrawing group.
Molecular Orbitals of Benzyl Cation, Radical, and Anion At the molecular orbital 
level, the most important MO for benzyl cation is the lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO), for benzyl radical it is the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), 
and for benzyl anion the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Figure 12.13 
shows the LUMO for benzyl cation where it is clear that the carbon 2p atomic orbitals 
that contribute the most are those of the benzylic carbon and the ring carbons that are 
ortho and para to it. These are the same carbons that, according to resonance, share the 
positive charge. The SOMO of benzyl radical and HOMO of benzyl anion are not shown, 
but are virtually identical to the LUMO of benzyl cation, in keeping with their respective 
resonance descriptions.
12.9 Nucleophilic Substitution in Benzylic Halides
Like allylic halides, benzylic halides undergo nucleophilic substitution, both SN1 and 
SN2, faster than simple alkyl halides and for similar reasons.

creates an extended π system that 
stabilizes each one by electron 
delocalization.

Because SN1 rates reflect the activation energy for carbocation formation, we conclude

1-Methyl-1-phenylethyl cation tert-Butyl cation
The electrostatic potential maps for the two carbocations (Figure 12.14) show the 
greater dispersal of positive charge in 1-methyl-1-phenylethyl cation compared with 
tert-butyl cation.
Problem 12.8
As measured by their first-order rate constants, the compound 
shown (R = CH3) undergoes hydrolysis 26 times faster than 
2-chloro-2-phenylpropane (R = H) in 90% acetone–10% water 
at 25°C. Offer a resonance explanation for this rate difference.
The rate-enhancing effect of phenyl substituents is cumulative; (C6H5)2CHCl 
undergoes SN1 substitution faster than C6H5CH2Cl, and triphenylmethyl perchlorate 
[(C6H5)3C+ ClO4
−] is a stable ionic compound that can be stored indefinitely.
SN1 Reaction Products Unlike SN1 reactions of allylic halides, dispersal of the charge 
in benzylic halides does not result in the nucleophile bonding to a carbon other than the 
one that had the leaving group. The ring’s aromaticity is retained only if the nucleophile 
bonds to the benzylic carbon.

As we saw for SN2 reactions of alkyl halides (Section 6.3), and allylic halides (Section 11.2), 
the key interaction is between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the LUMO of the organic 
halide. In a benzylic halide, the LUMO encompasses both the CH2Cl unit and the π system 
of the aromatic ring.

As electrons flow from the HOMO into the LUMO, they feel the attractive force not only 
of the benzylic carbon but of the ring carbons as well, which lowers the energy of the 
transition state and increases the reaction rate compared to allyl and propyl chloride.

Secondary and tertiary benzylic halides resemble secondary and tertiary alkyl halides in 
that they undergo substitution only when the nucleophile is weakly basic. If the nucleo￾phile is a strong base such as sodium ethoxide, elimination by the E2 mechanism is faster 
than substitution.444 Chapter 12 Arenes and Aromaticity

Triphenylmethyl Radical Yes, Hexaphenylethane No
An oft-told tale from organic chemistry’s early days begins with a 1900 paper by Moses Gomberg of the University of Michigan 
entitled “An Instance of Trivalent Carbon: Triphenylmethyl.” In an attempt to prepare hexaphenylethane by the reaction

Gomberg found that the product was not hexaphenylethane but had properties more consistent with what we would now call tri￾phenylmethyl radical [(C6H5)3C•] and suggested the two were in equilibrium with each other.

Hexaphenylethane Triphenylmethyl radical
Gomberg’s paper received wide attention and stimulated alternative interpretations. One of these, suggested by Paul Jacobson, 
an official of a German chemical society and editor of its journal, raised the possible role of a species based on an alternative coupling 
of the two triphenylmethyl units.
H
Jacobson’s dimer
Even though Gomberg grew to favor Jacobson’s proposal, it became customary to regard hexaphenylethane as the prod￾uct of the reaction and explain its properties in terms of an equilibrium between it and triphenylmethyl. The situation remained 
this way until 1968 when, on reinvestigating the reaction, it was conclusively determined that the structure proposed by Jacobson 
is the correct one.
It is now a routine matter to calculate relative energies of molecules. When compared this way, the Jacobson dimer is deter￾mined to be 62.9 kJ/mol (15.0 kcal/mol) more stable than hexaphenylethane. Although the Jacobson dimer has one less aromatic 
ring, the steric strain that would result from having six benzene rings on adjacent carbons is prohibitively high and it is likely that hexa￾phenylethane has never been prepared.12.10 Benzylic Free-Radical Halogenation 445
Sample Solution (a) Benzyl bromide is a primary bromide and undergoes SN2 reactions

There is one more aspect to the story. It involves yet another dimer—one having the

this reaction. Hint: See Section 12.13.

As in Section 11.3 where we counted the decreased bond-dissociation enthalpy in propene 
compared with 2-methylpropane as evidence for stabilization of allyl radical by delocaliza￾tion of the unpaired electron, we attribute the decreased C—H bond strength in toluene 
versus propene as reflecting better electron delocalization in benzyl radical versus allyl.446 Chapter 12 Arenes and Aromaticity
Figure 12.15
The spin density (yellow) of the benzyl 
radical is divided among four carbons.
Benzyl radical electron delocalization can be expressed by contributing Lewis reso￾nance structures. A molecular orbital calculation of the spin density of benzyl radical 
supports the sites with significant radical character (Figure 12.15). 
In contrast to allyl radicals, where bond formation can occur at different sites 
(Section 11.3), bond formation with benzyl radical occurs at the benzylic carbon. Bond 
formation at the ring carbons would remove aromatic stabilization. The comparative ease 
with which a benzylic hydrogen is abstracted leads to a regioselective preference for 
substitution at the benzylic carbon in free-radical halogenations of alkylbenzenes. 
Bromination of alkylbenzenes using N-bromosuccinimide offers a convenient synthesis 
of benzylic bromides.

12.11 Benzylic Anions
A benzylic cation is stabilized by delocalization of the π electrons of the ring into the vacant 
2p orbital of the benzylic carbon. Similarly, the half-filled 2p orbital of a benzylic radical
interacts with the π system of the ring to both increase the delocalization of the ring’s elec￾trons and allow delocalization of the unpaired electron. What about a benzylic anion?
One way to assess the stabilization of an anion is to regard it as the conjugate base of 
an acid and to compare the acid’s pKa with other substances. The weaker the conjugate base, 
the more strongly held is the unshared electron pair. For the case of benzyl anion, we compare 
toluene with other hydrocarbons—methane, diphenylmethane, and triphenylmethane.

The term oxidation includes so many reaction types that space allows only a few to be 
included here, and those only briefly. Of these, one is a large-scale industrial synthesis, 
a second is a laboratory method, the third is biological.

Benzene oxide and compounds derived from it are carcinogenic and can react with DNA to

The side-chain double bond is more reactive than the aromatic ring toward most 
electrophilic reagents. Many of the reactions of alkenes that were discussed in 
Chapter 8 find a parallel in the reactions of alkenylbenzenes. Thus, hydrogenation and

The annual production of styrene in the United States is approximately 1.1 × 1010 lb, 
with about 65% of this output used to prepare polystyrene plastics and films. Styrofoam 
coffee cups are made from polystyrene. Polystyrene can also be produced in a form that 
is very strong and impact-resistant and is used widely in luggage, television and radio 
cabinets, and furniture.

synthetic rubber is a copolymer of

12.15 The Birch Reduction
We saw in Section 10.6 that the combination of a Group 1 metal and liquid ammonia is 
a powerful reducing system capable of reducing alkynes to trans alkenes. In the presence 
of an alcohol, this same combination reduces arenes to nonconjugated dienes. Thus, 
treatment of benzene with sodium and methanol or ethanol in liquid ammonia converts 
it to 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Alkyl-substituted benzenes give 1,4-cyclohexadienes in which 
the alkyl group is a substituent on the double bond.

The mechanism by which the Birch reduction of benzene takes place (Mechanism 12.2)

a sequence of four steps in which steps 1 and 3 are one-electron reductions and steps 2 
and 4 are proton transfers from the alcohol.12.16 Benzylic Side Chains and Retrosynthetic Analysis
The relative stability of benzylic carbocations, radicals, and carbanions makes it pos￾sible to manipulate the side chains of aromatic rings. Functionalization at the benzylic 
position, for example, is readily accomplished by free-radical halogenation and pro￾vides access to the usual reactions (substitution, elimination) that we associate with 
alkyl halides.
To illustrate, consider the synthesis of (Z)-1-phenyl-2-butene. A major consideration—

12.17 Cyclobutadiene and Cyclooctatetraene
During our discussion of benzene and its derivatives, it may have occurred to you that 
cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene might be stabilized by cyclic π electron delocaliza￾tion in a manner analogous to that of benzene.
Cyclobutadiene Cyclooctatetraene
The same thought occurred to early chemists. However, the complete absence of naturally 
occurring compounds based on cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene contrasted starkly 
with the abundance of compounds containing a benzene unit. Attempts to synthesize 
cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene met with failure until 1911 when Richard Willstätter 
prepared cyclooctatetraene by a lengthy degradation of pseudopelletierine, a natural prod￾uct obtained from the bark of the pomegranate tree. Today, cyclooctatetraene is prepared 
from acetylene in a reaction catalyzed by nickel cyanide.

Cyclooctatetraene is relatively stable, but lacks the “special stability” of ben￾zene. Unlike benzene, which we saw has a heat of hydrogenation that is 152 kJ/mol 
(36 kcal/mol) less than three times the heat of hydrogenation of cyclohexene, cyclo￾octatetraene’s heat of hydrogenation is 26 kJ/mol (6 kcal/mol) more than four times 
that of cis-cyclooctene.

Problem 12.18
Both cyclooctatetraene and styrene have the molecular formula C8H8 and undergo 
combustion according to the equation
C8H8 + 1002 ⟶ 8CO2 + 4H2O
The measured heats of combustion are 4393 and 4543 kJ/mol (1050 and 1086 kcal/mol). 
Which heat of combustion belongs to which compound?
Thermodynamically, cyclooctatetraene does not qualify as aromatic. Nor does its 
structure offer any possibility of the π electron delocalization responsible for aromaticity. 
As shown in Figure 12.16, cyclooctatetraene is nonplanar with four short and four long 
carbon–carbon bond distances. Cyclooctatetraene is satisfactorily represented by a single 
Lewis structure having alternating single and double bonds in a tub-shaped eight￾membered ring. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the struc￾ture of cyclooctatetraene shown in Figure 12.16 is about 75 kJ/mol (18 kcal/mol) more 
stable than the planar delocalized alternative. Cyclooctatetraene is not aromatic.
What about cyclobutadiene?
Cyclobutadiene escaped chemical characterization until the 1950s, when a vari￾ety of novel techniques succeeded in generating cyclobutadiene as a transient, reactive 
intermediate.
Problem 12.19
One of the chemical properties that makes cyclobutadiene difficult to isolate is that it reacts 
readily with itself to give a dimer:
What reaction of dienes does this resemble?
Molecular orbital calculations of cyclobutadiene itself and experimentally measured 
bond distances of a stable, highly substituted derivative both reveal a pattern of alternat￾ing short and long bonds characteristic of a rectangular, rather than square, geometry.

Experimental measurements place delocalized cyclobutadiene approximately 150 kJ/mol 
(36 kcal/mol) higher in energy than a structure with noninteracting double bonds; both 
square cyclobutadiene and planar cyclooctatetraene are antiaromatic. Antiaromatic mol￾ecules are destabilized by delocalization of their π electrons and cyclobutadiene and 
cyclooctatetraene adopt structures that minimize the delocalization of these electrons.
Cyclic conjugation, although necessary for aromaticity, is not sufficient for it. Some 
other factor or factors must contribute to the special stability of benzene and compounds 
based on the benzene ring. To understand these factors, let’s return to the molecular 
orbital description of benzene.
12.18 Hückel’s Rule
One of molecular orbital theory’s early successes came in 1931 when Erich Hückel 
discovered an interesting pattern in the π orbital energy levels of benzene, cyclobuta￾diene, and cyclooctatetraene. By limiting the analysis to monocyclic conjugated polyenes 
Hückel was a German physical 
chemist. Before pursuing theoretical 
studies of aromaticity, Hückel 
collaborated with Peter Debye in 
developing what remains the most 
widely accepted theory of electrolyte 
solutions.

cyclooctatetraene. The ring is not 
planar, and the bond distances alternate 
between short double bonds and long 
single bonds.456 Chapter 12 Arenes and Aromaticity
and restricting the structures to planar geometries, Hückel found that whether a hydro￾carbon of this type was aromatic depended on its number of π electrons. This is what 
we now call Hückel’s rule:
Among planar, monocyclic, fully conjugated polyenes, only those possessing 
(4n + 2) π electrons, where n is a whole number, will have special stability; 
that is, be aromatic.
Thus, for this group of hydrocarbons, those with (4n + 2) = 2, 6, 10, 14, . . . π electrons 
will be aromatic. These values correspond to (4n + 2) when n = 0, 1, 2, 3. . . .
Hückel’s rule was proposed before ideas of antiaromaticity emerged. We now 
amplify the theory by noting that among the hydrocarbons covered by Hückel’s rule, 
those with (4n) π electrons not only are not aromatic, they are antiaromatic.
Benzene, cyclobutadiene, and cyclooctatetraene provide clear examples of Hückel’s 
rule. Benzene, with six π electrons, is a (4n + 2) system and is predicted to be aromatic 
by the rule. Square cyclobutadiene and planar cyclooctatetraene are 4n systems with four 
and eight π electrons, respectively, and are antiaromatic.
The (4n + 2) π electron standard follows from the pattern of orbital energies in 
monocyclic, completely conjugated polyenes. The π energy levels were shown for benzene 
earlier in Figure 12.4 and are repeated in Figure 12.17b. Figure 12.17a and 12.17c show 
the π energy levels for square cyclobutadiene and planar cyclooctatetraene, respectively.
The diagrams in Figure 12.17 illustrate a simple method, called the Frost circle, for 
setting out the Hückel MOs of “planar, monocyclic, completely conjugated polyenes.” By 
inscribing a polygon having the appropriate number of sides within a circle so that one of 
its corners lies at the bottom, the location of each of the polygon’s corners defines a π 
electron energy level. A horizontal line drawn through the center of the circle separates 
the bonding and antibonding MOs; an orbital that lies directly on the line is nonbonding.
The pattern of orbital energies in Figure 12.17 provides a convincing explanation 
for why benzene is aromatic while square cyclobutadiene and planar cyclooctatetraene 
are not. We start by counting π electrons; cyclobutadiene has four, benzene six, and 
cyclooctatetraene has eight. These π electrons are assigned to MOs in accordance with 
the usual rules—lowest-energy orbitals first, a maximum of two electrons per orbital, 
and when two orbitals are of equal energy, each gets one electron before either orbital 
gets two (Hund’s rule).
Benzene As seen in Figure 12.4 (Section 12.4), the six π electrons of 
benzene are distributed in pairs among its three bonding π MOs, 
giving a closed-shell electron configuration. All the bonding 
orbitals are filled, and all the electron spins are paired.
Cyclobutadiene Square cyclobutadiene has one bonding π MO, two equal￾energy nonbonding π MOs, and one antibonding π* MO. 
After the bonding MO is filled, the remaining two electrons 
are assigned to different nonbonding MOs in accordance 
The circle mnemonic was devised by 
Arthur A. Frost, a theoretical chemist 
at Northwestern University.

with Hund’s rule. This results in a species with two unpaired 
electrons—a diradical. In a square geometry, cyclobutadiene 
lacks a closed-shell electron configuration. It is not stabilized 
and, with two unpaired electrons, should be very reactive.
Cyclooctatetraene Six of the eight π electrons of planar cyclooctatetraene 
occupy three bonding orbitals. The remaining two π electrons 
occupy, one each, the two equal-energy nonbonding orbitals. 
Planar cyclooctatetraene should, like square cyclobutadiene, 
be a diradical.
An important conclusion to draw from the qualitative MO diagrams is that the 
customary geometry required for maximum π electron delocalization gives relatively 
unstable electron configurations for cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene. Both escape 
to alternative geometries that have electron configurations which, although not aromatic, 
at least have all their electron spins paired. For cyclobutadiene the stable geometry is 
rectangular; for cyclooctatetraene it is tub-shaped.
Benzene’s structure allows effective π electron conjugation and gives a closed-shell 
electron configuration. To understand why it also conveys special stability, we need to go 
one step further and compare the Hückel π MOs of benzene to those of a hypothetical 
“cyclohexatriene” with alternating single and double bonds. Without going into quantitative 
detail, we’ll simply note that the occupied orbitals of a structure in which the π electrons 
are restricted to three noninteracting double bonds are of higher energy (less stable) than 
the occupied Hückel MOs of benzene.
Before looking at other applications of Hückel’s rule, it is worth pointing out that its 
opening phrase, “Among planar, monocyclic, fully conjugated polyenes,” does not mean that 
only “planar, monocyclic, fully conjugated polyenes” can be aromatic. It merely limits the 
rule to compounds of this type. There are countless aromatic compounds that are not 
monocyclic—naphthalene and related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Section 12.6), for 
example. All compounds based on benzene rings are aromatic. Cyclic conjugation is a 
requirement for aromaticity, however, and in those cases the conjugated system must contain 
(4n + 2) π electrons. Cyclic conjugated systems with 4n π electrons are antiaromatic.
Problem 12.20
Give an explanation for each of the following observations:
(a) Compound A has six π electrons but is not aromatic.
(b) Compound B has six π electrons but is not aromatic.
(c) Compound C has 12 π electrons and is aromatic.
Compound A
(C7H8)
Compound B

Compound C

Sample Solution (a) Cycloheptatriene (compound A) is not aromatic because, although it 
does contain six π electrons, its conjugated system of three double bonds does not close on 
itself—it lacks cyclic conjugation. The CH2 group prevents cyclic delocalization of the π electrons.
In Section 12.19 we’ll explore Hückel’s rule for values of n greater than 1 to see 
how it can be extended beyond cyclobutadiene, benzene, and cyclooctatetraene.
12.19 Annulenes
The general term annulene refers to completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons with 
more than six carbons. Cyclobutadiene and benzene retain their names, but higher members 
of the group are named [x]annulene, where x is the number of carbons in the ring. Thus, 
cyclooctatetraene becomes [8]annulene, cyclodecapentaene becomes [10]annulene, and so on.
Most of the synthetic work directed 
toward the higher annulenes was 
carried out by Franz Sondheimer’s 
research group, first at Israel’s 
Weizmann Institute and later at the 
University of London.458 Chapter 12 Arenes and Aromaticity
Problem 12.21
Use Frost’s circle to construct orbital energy diagrams for (a) [10]annulene and (b) [12]annulene. 
Is either aromatic according to Hückel’s rule?
Sample Solution (a) [10]Annulene is a ten-membered ring with five conjugated double 
bonds. Drawing a polygon with ten sides with its vertex pointing downward within a 
circle gives the orbital template. Place the orbitals at the positions where each vertex 
contacts the circle. The ten π electrons of [10]annulene satisfy the (4n + 2) rule for 
n = 2 and occupy the five bonding orbitals in pairs. [10]Annulene is aromatic according 
to Hückel’s rule.

π Electron configuration
The prospect of observing aromatic character in conjugated polyenes having 10, 
14, 18, and so on π electrons spurred efforts toward the synthesis of higher annulenes. 
A problem immediately arises in the case of the all-cis isomer of [10]annulene, the 
structure of which is shown in the preceding problem. Geometry requires a ten-sided 
regular polygon to have 144° bond angles; sp2
 hybridization at carbon requires 120° bond 
angles. Therefore, aromatic stabilization due to conjugation in all-cis-[10]annulene is 
opposed by the destabilizing angle strain at each of its carbon atoms. All-cis-[10]annulene 
has been prepared. It is highly reactive and lacks the “special stability” we associate with 
aromaticity.
A second isomer of [10]annulene (the cis, trans, cis, cis, trans stereoisomer) can 
have bond angles close to 120° but is destabilized by a close contact between two hydro￾gens directed toward the interior of the ring. To minimize the van der Waals strain 
between these hydrogens, the ring adopts a nonplanar geometry, which limits its ability 
to be stabilized by π electron delocalization. It, too, has been prepared and is not aro￾matic. Similarly, the next higher (4n + 2) system, [14]annulene, is also somewhat desta￾bilized by van der Waals strain, is nonplanar and not aromatic.

When the ring contains 18 carbon atoms, it is large enough to be planar while 
still allowing its interior hydrogens to be far enough apart so as to not interfere with 
one another. The [18]annulene shown is planar, or nearly so, and has all its carbon–
carbon bond distances in the range 137–143 pm (1.37–1.43 Å), very much like those 
of benzene. Its resonance energy is estimated to be about 418 kJ/mol (100 kcal/mol). 
Although its structure and resonance energy attest to the validity of Hückel’s rule, 
which predicts “special stability” for [18]annulene, its chemical reactivity does not. 
[18]Annulene behaves more like a polyene than like benzene in that it undergoes 
addition rather than substitution with bromine and forms a Diels–Alder adduct with 
maleic anhydride.

It is important to recognize the difference between the hydrocarbon cyclohepta￾triene and cycloheptatrienyl cation. The carbocation is aromatic; the hydrocarbon is not. 
Although cycloheptatriene has six π electrons in a conjugated system, the ends of the 
triene system are separated by an sp3
-hybridized carbon, which prevents continuous 
cyclic π electron delocalization.

Problem 12.24
Cycloheptatrienyl radical (C7H7·) contains a cyclic, completely conjugated system of π
electrons. Is it aromatic? Is it antiaromatic? Explain.
When we say cycloheptatriene is not aromatic but cycloheptatrienyl cation is, 
we are not comparing the stability of the two to each other. Cycloheptatriene is a 
stable hydrocarbon but does not possess the special stability required to be called 
aromatic. Cycloheptatrienyl cation, although aromatic, is still a carbocation and rea￾sonably reactive toward nucleophiles. Its special stability does not imply a rock-like 
passivity, but rather a much greater ease of formation than expected on the basis of 
the Lewis structure drawn for it. A number of observations indicate that cycloheptatrienyl 
cation is far more stable than most other carbocations. To emphasize its aromatic nature, 
chemists often write the structure of cycloheptatrienyl cation in the Robinson circle￾in-a-ring style.

contributes two π electrons, a negatively charged carbon contributes two, and a positively

12.22 Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds 
and Hückel’s Rule
Hückel’s rule can be extended to heterocyclic aromatic compounds. A heteroatom such 
as oxygen or nitrogen can contribute either zero or two of its unshared electrons as 
needed to the π system so as to satisfy the (4n + 2) π electron requirement.
The unshared pair in pyridine, for example, is not needed to satisfy the six π electron 
requirement for aromaticity, so is associated entirely with nitrogen and is not delocalized 
into the aromatic π system.
2 π electrons 2 π electrons
Pyridine 2 π electrons sp2-hybridized
These electrons occupy an
sp2 orbital and are not involved 
in the π system

The unshared pair in the Lewis structure for pyrrole, on the other hand, must be added to 
the four π electrons of the two double bonds in order to meet the six π electron requirement.
2 π electrons 2 π electrons (in a p orbital)
Pyrrole 2 π electrons

In both pyridine and pyrrole the unshared electron pair occupies that orbital which pro￾vides the most stable structure. It is a different orbital in each case. In pyridine it is an 
sp2
-hybridized orbital localized on nitrogen. In pyrrole it is a p orbital of nitrogen that 
overlaps with the p orbitals of the ring carbons to give a delocalized π system.12.22 Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds and Hückel’s Rule 465
The electrostatic potential maps in Figure 12.20 show how pyridine and pyrrole 
differ with respect to their charge distribution. The unshared electron pair in pyridine 
gives rise to a region of high electron density (red) near nitrogen. A similar concentration 
of charge is absent in pyrrole because the corresponding electrons are delocalized among 
the five ring atoms.
The difference in bonding in pyridine and pyrrole is reflected in their properties. 
Although both are weak bases, pyridine is 107
–109
 times more basic than pyrrole. When 
pyridine acts as a Brønsted base, protonation of nitrogen converts an unshared pair (N:) 
to a bonded pair (NH) while leaving the aromatic π system intact.

With pyrrole, however, the pair of electrons shown as an unshared pair in its Lewis formula 
is actually part of the aromatic π system. Were these two electrons to be involved in cova￾lent bonding to a proton, all of the stabilization associated with aromaticity would be lost.

Problem 12.31
Estimate the pKa of the conjugate acid of pyrrole given that pyrrole is about 107
–109
 times 
less basic than pyridine and that the pKa of the conjugate acid of pyridine is 5.3. Is the 
conjugate acid of pyridine strong or weak? What about the conjugate acid of pyrrole?
Imidazole is a heterocyclic aromatic compound with two nitrogens in a five￾membered ring. One nitrogen has a pyridine-like unshared pair; the other has a pyrrole-like 
pair that is incorporated into the aromatic π system. Imidazole is somewhat more basic 
than pyridine. When imidazole acts as a Brønsted base, protonation of its pyridine-like 
nitrogen permits aromaticity to be retained by leaving the pyrrole-like nitrogen untouched.

Refer to the structure of imidazolium ion in the preceding equation and write a second 
resonance contributor that obeys the octet rule and has its positive charge on the other 
nitrogen. Use curved arrows to show how you reorganized the electrons.
Turning to oxygen as a heteroatom, the question of two unshared pairs on the same 
atom arises.

One pair is like the pair in pyrrole, occupying a p orbital and contributing two electrons 
to complete the six-π electron requirement for aromatic stabilization. The other electron 
pair in furan is an “extra” pair, not needed to satisfy the 4n + 2 rule for aromaticity, and 
occupies an sp2
-hybridized orbital like the unshared pair in pyridine.
Section 12.1 Benzene is the parent of a class of compounds called arenes, which are 
aromatic hydrocarbons.
Section 12.2 An important property of aromatic hydrocarbons is that they are much more 
stable and less reactive than other unsaturated compounds. The Kekulé formulas 
for benzene seem inconsistent with its low reactivity and with the fact that all 
of the CC bonds in benzene are the same length (139 pm (1.39 Å)).
One explanation for the structure and stability of benzene and other arenes is 
based on resonance, according to which benzene is regarded as a hybrid of the 
two Kekulé structures.
Section 12.3 The extent to which benzene is more stable than either of the Kekulé structures 
is its resonance energy, which is estimated to be 152 kJ/mol (36 kcal/mol) 
from heats of hydrogenation data.
Section 12.4 According to the valence bond model, benzene has six π electrons, which are 
shared by all six sp2
-hybridized carbons. Regions of high π electron density are 
located above and below the plane of the ring.
A molecular orbital description of benzene has three π orbitals that are bonding 
and three that are antibonding. Each of the bonding orbitals is fully occupied 
(two electrons each), and the antibonding orbitals are vacant.

Section 12.16 The choice of synthetic routes to aromatic compounds is strongly influenced by 
considerations of the effect of the benzylic carbon on rate and regioselectivity.
Section 12.17 Although cyclic conjugation is a necessary requirement for aromaticity, this 
alone is not sufficient. If it were, cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene would 
be aromatic. They are not.

(not aromatic)
Cyclooctatetraene

Section 12.18 An additional requirement for aromaticity is that the number of π electrons in 
conjugated, planar, monocyclic species must be equal to 4n + 2, where n is an 
integer. This is called Hückel’s rule. Benzene, with six π electrons, satisfies 
Hückel’s rule for n = 1. Square cyclobutadiene (four π electrons) and planar 
cyclooctatetraene (eight π electrons) do not. Both are examples of systems with 
4n π electrons and are antiaromatic.
Section 12.19 Annulenes are monocyclic, completely conjugated polyenes synthesized for the 
purpose of testing Hückel’s rule. They are named by using a bracketed numerical 
prefix to indicate the number of carbons, followed by the word annulene.
[4n]-Annulenes are characterized by rings with alternating short (double) and long

Substituent Effects on Reaction Rates and Equilibria
We have seen numerous examples of substituent effects on rates and equilibria of organic reactions 
and have developed a qualitative feel for steric and electronic effects as important factors. What 
about their quantitative treatment?
The first widely accepted method dealt with electronic effects and dates to the 1930s when 
Louis P. Hammett (Columbia University) developed an approach represented in the equations:
log __k
k0
 = σρ and log ___ K
K0
 = σρ
where k and k0 are rate constants and K and K0 are equilibrium constants. σ and ρ are experimentally 
determined constants characteristic of a substituent (σ) and a reaction (ρ). The standard substituent 
is H and is assigned σ = 0. The standard reaction, assigned a value of ρ = 1.0, is the ionization 
of meta- and para-substituted benzoic acids.

When X is electron-withdrawing, the sign of σ is + and the acid is stronger than benzoic 
acid. Conversely, σ is negative for electron-releasing, acid-weakening groups. For individual 
substituents, σ differs according to whether it is meta or para to the reaction site. Experimental 
measures of Ka for a variety of substituted benzoic acids gave the following substituent constants.
There are no σortho values because of the possibility of steric interactions.

Example: Which of the following is the strongest acid? Which is the weakest?
m-Methylbenzoic acid
m-Fluorobenzoic acid
p-(Trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid
p-Methoxybenzoic acid
Answer: By definition: ρ = +1.0 for the ionization of substituted benzoic acids; therefore, 
the acid with the most positive value of σ for its substituent is strongest. Among the substituents 
p-F3C with σ = 0.53 is the strongest electron-withdrawing group; therefore, p-(trifluoromethyl)
benzoic acid is the strongest acid. m-Methylbenzoic acid is the weakest.
Descriptive Passage and Interpretive Problems 12476 Chapter 12 Arenes and Aromaticity
Experimentally determined substituent constants for more than 100 other groups have been 
determined and used to determine values of ρ for various reactions, resulting in a rich library of 
σmeta, σpara, and ρ values that can be applied to specific questions of reaction mechanisms, rates, 
and equilibria.

Answer: The positive value for ρ (+2.1) tells us that the reaction rate increases with 
increasingly positive values of σ. The substituent constant σpara for OCH3 = −0.12 while σmeta
for Cl = 0.37; therefore, B reacts faster than A.
With respect to reaction mechanisms, the major application of the Hammett equation lies 
in using ρ as an indicator of the direction and degree of charge development in the transition state. 
In the E2 example just described (ρ = +2.1), we conclude that the substituted benzene ring is 
acting as an electron-withdrawing group and infer that CH bond-breaking is more advanced 
than CBr bond-breaking in the rate-determining transition state.
Historically, the Hammett equation provided the foundation for related applications, 
especially one developed by Robert Taft (Penn State, University of California Irvine). Taft adapted 
Hammett’s approach so as to apply to aliphatic compounds by deriving an appropriate set of 
substituent constants (σ*) and including a term (δEs) for steric effects where δ is a steric sensitivity 
factor for the reaction and Es is a steric substituent constant.

Others, especially Marvin Charton (Pratt Institute), expanded the scope of what had come 
to be called linear free-energy relationships to more broadly based structure-activity correlations.
A potentially very important recent advance integrates stereochemistry into structure-activity 
correlations for the purpose of identifying reactants and catalysts best suited to produce chiral 
molecules with high levels of enantiomeric excess. As developed by Matthew Sigman (University 
of Utah), it applies relatively complex mathematical methods to identify the optimum experimental 
conditions for enantioselective synthesis. For example, in the reaction:

70% yield; 70% enantiomeric excess
the reactants included not only the two shown in the equation, but also five other components in

Electrophilic and Nucleophilic 
Aromatic Substitution
In the preceding chapter the special stability of benzene was 
described, along with reactions in which an aromatic ring was 
present as a substituent. What about reactions that occur on the 
ring itself? What sort of reagents react with benzene and its 
derivatives, what products are formed, and by what mechanisms?
The largest and most important class of such reactions 
involves electrophilic reagents. We already have some experi￾ence with electrophiles, particularly with respect to their reac￾tion with alkenes. Electrophilic reagents add to alkenes.

between the π electron system of benzene and the nitrogen of nitronium ion.

In Section 6.1, we noted that aryl halides are normally much less reactive toward nucleo￾philic substitution than alkyl halides. In the present chapter we’ll see examples of novel, 
useful, and mechanistically interesting nucleophilic aromatic substitutions and explore 
the structural features responsible for these reactions.
13.1 Representative Electrophilic Aromatic 
Substitution Reactions of Benzene
The scope of electrophilic aromatic substitution is quite large; both the aromatic com￾pound and the electrophilic reagent are capable of wide variation. Indeed, it is this broad 
scope that makes electrophilic aromatic substitution so important. Electrophilic aromatic 
substitution is the main method by which substituted derivatives of benzene are prepared. 
We can gain a feeling for these reactions by examining the examples in Table 13.1. Each 
will be discussed in more detail in Sections 13.3 through 13.7. First, however, let us look 
at the general mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution.

The first step is rate-determining. In it a carbocation results when the pair of π electrons 
of the alkene is used to form a bond with the electrophile. The carbocation then under￾goes rapid capture by some Lewis base present in the medium.
The first step in the reaction of electrophilic reagents with benzene is similar. An 
electrophile accepts an electron pair from the π system of benzene giving a carbocation.

In the second step, this carbocation, called a cyclohexadienyl cation, arenium ion, or 
σ complex, then undergoes deprotonation to restore the aromaticity of the ring. If the 
Lewis base (:Y−) had acted as a nucleophile and bonded to carbon, the product would 
have been a nonaromatic cyclohexadiene derivative. Substitution occurs preferentially 
because a substantial driving force is present that favors rearomatization.
Figure 13.1 is a potential energy diagram describing the general mechanism of 
electrophilic aromatic substitution. In order to overcome the high activation energy that 
characterizes the first step, the electrophile must be a reactive one. Many of the electro￾philic reagents that react rapidly with alkenes do not react at all with benzene. Peroxy 
acids and diborane, for example, fall into this category. Others, such as bromine, react 
with benzene only in the presence of catalysts that increase their electrophilicity. The 
low level of reactivity of benzene toward electrophiles stems from the loss of aromaticity 
in the transition state for the rate-determining step.
Problem 13.1
Based on Hammond’s postulate which holds that the closer two consecutive states in a 
reaction mechanism are in energy the closer they are in structure, does the structure of the 
transition state for formation of the carbocation intermediate more closely resemble benzene 
or cyclohexadienyl cation?13.3 Nitration of Benzene 481
With this as background, we’ll examine each of the electrophilic aromatic substitu￾tions presented in Table 13.1 in more detail, especially with respect to the electrophile 
that reacts with benzene.
13.3 Nitration of Benzene
Having outlined the general mechanism for electrophilic aromatic substitution, we need 
only identify the specific electrophile in the nitration of benzene to have a fairly clear 
idea of how the reaction occurs.

in nitronium ion is evident both in its Lewis structure and in the electrostatic potential

Mechanism 13.1 adapts the general mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution 
to the nitration of benzene. The first step is rate-determining; in it benzene reacts with 
nitronium ion to give the cyclohexadienyl cation intermediate. In the second step, the 
aromaticity of the ring is restored by loss of a proton from the cyclohexadienyl cation.
One way we know that step 1 is rate-determining is that nitration of benzene does 
not exhibit a deuterium isotope effect (Section 7.17). Loss of deuterium (D = 2
H) during 
nitration of C6H5D occurs at the same rate as loss of a single 1
H, which tells us that the 
CD bond must break after the rate-determining step, not during it.
Nitration by electrophilic aromatic substitution is not limited to benzene alone, but 
is a general reaction of compounds that contain a benzene ring with at least one replace￾able hydrogen. It would be a good idea to write out the answers to the following two 
problems to ensure that you understand the relationship of starting materials to products 
and the mechanism of aromatic nitration before continuing to the next section.

C8H9NO2 in high yield. What is this product?

13.4 Sulfonation of Benzene
The reaction of benzene with sulfuric acid to produce benzenesulfonic acid is reversible and 
can be driven to completion by several techniques. Removing the water formed in the reac￾tion, for example, allows benzenesulfonic acid to be obtained in virtually quantitative yield.

Bromine, although it adds rapidly to alkenes, is too weak an electrophile to react 
at an appreciable rate with benzene. A catalyst that increases the electrophilic properties 
of bromine must be present. Somehow carpet tacks can do this. How?
The active catalyst is not iron itself but iron(III) bromide, formed by reaction of 
iron and bromine.

Complexation of bromine with iron(III) bromide makes bromine more electrophilic, 
and it reacts with benzene to give a cyclohexadienyl intermediate as shown in step 1 of 
Mechanism 13.3. In step 2, as in nitration and sulfonation, loss of a proton from the 
cyclohexadienyl cation is rapid and gives the product of electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Only small quantities of iron(III) bromide are required. It is a catalyst for the bro￾mination and, as Mechanism 13.3 indicates, is regenerated in the course of the reaction. 
We’ll see later in this chapter that some aromatic compounds are much more reactive 
than benzene and react rapidly with bromine even in the absence of a catalyst.
Chlorination is carried out in a manner similar to bromination and follows an 
analogous mechanism to give aryl chlorides.
Iodination with I2 is not very effective, but specialized reagents such as acetyl 
hypoiodite have been developed that provide a useful synthesis of aryl iodides.

Biosynthetic Halogenation
Over 4000 natural products contain halogens. Some natu￾rally occurring aryl halides include:
The presence of the halogen in these and in other haloge￾nated natural products has a strong effect on their properties, 
and their biosynthetic origin was a scientific puzzle of longstand￾ing. What are the biological halogenating agents, what enzymes 
catalyze the halogenation, and how do they do it? Recent stud￾ies have unlocked the answers to some of these questions.
Biosynthetic halogenation can occur through multiple 
pathways, but many halogenase enzymes use electrophilic halo￾genating species that are produced by oxidation of halide ions.
The biosynthesis of the antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin 
begins with enzyme-catalyzed chlorination of the benzene ring 
of the amino acid tryptophan. The enzyme is a halogenase, and 
the electrophilic chlorinating agent is thought to be hypochlorous 
acid (HOCl), which is generated in a separate step. Although the 
oxidation state of chlorine in HOCl is +1, it alone is not electro￾philic enough to chlorinate tryptophan but can be activated 
through hydrogen bonding with a nearby amino group found in 
the catalytic site of the enzyme. Loss of a proton to rearomatize 
the ring occurs from the σ complex and gives 7-chlorotryptophan, 
which undergoes subsequent conversion to pyrrolnitrin by way of 
additional enzyme-catalyzed processes, including a second 
biochemical chlorination.

Secondary alkyl halides react by a similar mechanism. Methyl and ethyl halides do not

product? How did it arise?
Because electrophilic aromatic substitution is simply another reaction available to a 
carbocation, other carbocation precursors can be used in place of alkyl halides. For example, 
alkenes, which are converted to carbocations by protonation, can be used to alkylate benzene.

Problem 13.9
tert-Butylbenzene can be prepared by alkylation of benzene using an alkene or an alcohol 
as the carbocation source. What alkene? What alcohol?
Alkenyl halides such as vinyl chloride (H2CCHCl) do not form carbocations on 
treatment with aluminum chloride and so cannot be used in Friedel–Crafts reactions. 
Thus, the industrial preparation of styrene from benzene and ethylene does not involve 
vinyl chloride but proceeds by way of ethylbenzene.

Dehydrogenation of alkylbenzenes, although useful in the industrial preparation of 
styrene, is not a general procedure and is not well suited to the laboratory preparation 
of alkenylbenzenes. In such cases an alkylbenzene is subjected to benzylic bromination 
(Section 12.10), and the resulting benzylic bromide is treated with base to effect 
dehydrohalogenation.

The electrophile in a Friedel–Crafts acylation is an acyl cation (also referred to as 
an acylium ion) and is formed on reaction of acyl chlorides with aluminum chloride in 
much the same way as alkyl cations are formed from alkyl halides.
Electron delocalization in the acyl cation derived from propanoyl chloride is rep￾resented by the following two resonance contributors. Note that electron release from 
oxygen generates a contributing structure that both satisfies the octet rule and disperses 
the positive charge.

Propanoyl cation
Unlike alkyl carbocations, acyl cations do not rearrange. An acyl cation is so 
strongly stabilized by electron delocalization that it is more stable than any other ion that 
would arise from it by a hydride or alkyl group shift.
The electrostatic potential map of propanoyl cation in Figure 13.4 illustrates the 
positive character of the acyl carbon, and it is this carbon that is the reactive site in 
electrophilic aromatic substitution (Mechanism 13.5).

13.8 Synthesis of Alkylbenzenes by Acylation–Reduction
Because acylation of an aromatic ring can be accomplished without rearrangement, it is 
frequently used as the first step in a procedure for the alkylation of aromatic compounds 
by acylation–reduction. As we saw in Section 13.6, Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene 
with primary alkyl halides normally yields products having rearranged alkyl groups. 
When preparing a compound of the type ArCH2R, a two-step sequence is used in which 
the first step is a Friedel–Crafts acylation.

13.9 Rate and Regioselectivity in Electrophilic 
Aromatic Substitution
So far we’ve been concerned only with electrophilic substitution of benzene. Two impor￾tant questions arise when we turn to substitution on rings that already bear at least one 
substituent:
1. What is the effect of a substituent on the rate of electrophilic aromatic substitution?
2. What is the effect of a substituent on the regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic 
substitution?13.9 Rate and Regioselectivity in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution 493
To illustrate substituent effects on rate, consider the nitration of benzene, toluene, 
and (trifluoromethyl)benzene.
CF3
(Trifluoromethyl)benzene Benzene
CH3
Toluene
Least reactive Most reactive
Reactivity increases
Reactivity depends on benzene’s substituents
The range of nitration rates among these three compounds is quite large; it covers a spread 
of approximately 1-millionfold. Toluene undergoes nitration some 20–25 times faster than 
benzene. Because toluene is more reactive than benzene, we say that a methyl group activates
the ring toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. (Trifluoromethyl)benzene, on the other 
hand, undergoes nitration about 40,000 times more slowly than benzene. A trifluoromethyl 
group deactivates the ring toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. The structural factors 
responsible for these rate differences will be discussed in more detail beginning in the next 
section, but we can gain a clue in advance of that material from the three electrostatic 
potential maps in Figure 13.5, which illustrate how the aromatic rings of benzene and toluene 
are more “electron-rich” than the ring of (trifluoromethyl)benzene.
Just as there is a marked difference in how methyl and trifluoromethyl substituents 
affect the rate of electrophilic aromatic substitution, so too is there a marked difference 
in how they affect its regioselectivity.
Three products are possible from nitration of toluene: o-nitrotoluene, m-nitrotoluene, 
and p-nitrotoluene. All are formed, but not in equal amounts. Together, the ortho- and 
para-substituted isomers make up 97% of the product mixture; the meta only 3%.

(Trifluoromethyl)benzene Benzene Toluene494 Chapter 13 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
Nitration of (trifluoromethyl)benzene, on the other hand, yields almost exclusively 
m-nitro(trifluoromethyl)benzene (91%). The ortho- and para-substituted isomers are 
minor components of the reaction mixture.

Because substitution in (trifluoromethyl)benzene occurs primarily at positions meta to 
the substituent, a trifluoromethyl group is a meta director.
The regioselectivity of substitution, like the rate, is strongly affected by the sub￾stituent. In the following several sections we will examine the relationship between the 
structure of the substituent and its effect on rate and regioselectivity of electrophilic 
aromatic substitution.
13.10 Rate and Regioselectivity in the Nitration of Toluene
Why is there such a marked difference between methyl and trifluoromethyl substituents 
in their influence on electrophilic aromatic substitution? Methyl is activating and ortho, 
para-directing; trifluoromethyl is deactivating and meta-directing. The first point to 
remember is that the regioselectivity of substitution is set once the cyclohexadienyl cat￾ion intermediate is formed. If we can explain why

in the rate-determining step, we will understand the reasons for the regioselectivity. A 
principle we have used before serves us well here: a more stable carbocation is formed 
faster than a less stable one. The most likely reason for the directing effect of a CH3
group must be that the carbocations that give o- and p-nitrotoluene are more stable than 
the one that gives m-nitrotoluene.
One way to assess the relative stabilities of these carbocations is to examine electron 
delocalization in them using a resonance description. The cyclohexadienyl cations leading 
to o- and p-nitrotoluene have tertiary carbocation character. Each has a contributing structure 
in which the positive charge resides on the carbon that bears the methyl group.

A methyl group is ortho, para-directing because the carbocations leading to o- and 
p-nitrotoluene are more stable and formed faster than the one leading to m-nitrotoluene. 
The greater stability of the carbocations for ortho and para substitution comes from their 
tertiary carbocation character. All of the contributing carbocation structures for meta 
substitution are secondary.
A methyl group is an activating substituent because it stabilizes the carbocation 
intermediate formed in the rate-determining step more than hydrogen does. Figure 13.6 
compares the energies of activation for nitration at the various positions of toluene with 
each other and with benzene. Nitration of benzene has the highest activation energy, 
para-nitration of toluene the lowest.
Methyl is an electron-releasing group and activates all the available ring carbons 
toward electrophilic substitution. The ortho and para positions are activated more than 
meta. At 25°C, the relative rates of nitration at the various positions of toluene compared 
with a single carbon of benzene are:

These relative rate data per position are experimentally determined and are known as 
partial rate factors. They offer a convenient way to express substituent effects in elec￾trophilic aromatic substitutions.
The major influence of the methyl group is its electronic effect on carbocation 
stability. To a small extent, the methyl group sterically hinders the approach of the elec￾trophile to the ortho positions, making substitution slightly slower at a single ortho 
carbon than at the para carbon. However, para substitution is at a statistical disadvantage 
because there are two equivalent ortho positions but only one para position.

Sample Solution (a) Benzene has six equivalent sites at which nitration can occur.

tert-Butylbenzene undergoes nitration 15 times faster than benzene.
All alkyl groups, not just methyl, are electron-releasing, activating substituents and 
ortho, para directors. This is because any alkyl group, be it methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, 
or any other, stabilizes a carbocation site to which it is directly attached. When R = alkyl,

13.11 Rate and Regioselectivity in the Nitration 
of (Trifluoromethyl)benzene
Turning now to electrophilic aromatic substitution in (trifluoromethyl)benzene, we con￾sider the electronic properties of a trifluoromethyl group. Because of their high electro￾negativity the three fluorine atoms polarize the electron distribution in their σ bonds to 
carbon, so that carbon bears a partial positive charge.

Unlike a methyl group, which is electron-releasing, trifluoromethyl is a powerful 
electron-withdrawing group. Consequently, CF3 destabilizes a carbocation site to which 
it is attached.

bonding at either the ortho or the para position, and so meta substitution predomi￾nates. Even the carbocation intermediate corresponding to meta nitration, however, is 
very unstable and is formed with difficulty. The trifluoromethyl group is only one 
bond farther removed from the positive charge here than it is in the ortho and para 
intermediates and so still exerts a significant, although somewhat diminished, desta￾bilizing inductive effect.
Section 5.9 discusses how alkyl 
groups stabilize carbocations.498 Chapter 13 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
All the ring positions of (trifluoromethyl)benzene are deactivated compared with 
benzene. The meta position is simply deactivated less than the ortho and para positions.

Figure 13.7 compares the energy profile for nitration of benzene with those for the ortho,

but the increase is least for the meta position.

The compounds benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl), (dichloromethyl)benzene (C6H5CHCl2), and

another. Classify the substituents CH2Cl, CHCl2, and CCl3 according to each one’s 
effect on rate and regioselectivity in electrophilic aromatic substitution.
13.12 Substituent Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic 
Substitution: Activating Substituents
Our analysis of substituent effects has so far centered on two groups: methyl and tri￾fluoromethyl. We have seen that a methyl substituent is electron-releasing, activating, 
and ortho, para-directing. A trifluoromethyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, 
deactivating, and meta-directing. What about other substituents?
Table 13.2 summarizes orientation and rate effects in electrophilic aromatic substi￾tution for some frequently encountered substituents. It is arranged in order of decreasing

3. Strongly deactivating substituents are meta directors.500 Chapter 13 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
Some of the most powerful activating substituents are those in which an oxygen 
atom is attached directly to the ring. These substituents include the hydroxyl group as 
well as alkoxy and acyloxy groups. All are ortho, para directors.

The inductive effect of hydroxyl and alkoxy groups, because of the electronegativ￾ity of oxygen, is to withdraw electrons and would seem to require that such substituents 
be deactivating. This electron-withdrawing inductive effect, however, is overcome by a 
much larger electron-releasing resonance effect involving the unshared electron pairs of 
oxygen. Bonding of the electrophile at positions ortho and para to a substituent of the 
type OR gives a cation stabilized by delocalization of an unshared electron pair of 
oxygen into the π system of the ring.

Phenol and anisole are among the

derivatives listed in Table 12.1. Oxygen-stabilized carbocations of this type are far more stable than tertiary carbocations. 
They are best represented by structures in which the positive charge is on oxygen because 
all the atoms then have octets of electrons. Their stability permits them to be formed 
rapidly, resulting in rates of electrophilic aromatic substitution that are much faster than 
that of benzene.

The nitrogen atom in each of these groups bears an electron pair that, like the unshared 
pairs of oxygen, stabilizes a carbocation to which it is attached. Nitrogen is less electro￾negative than oxygen, so is a better electron-pair donor and stabilizes the cyclohexadi￾enyl cation intermediates in electrophilic aromatic substitution to an even greater degree.

Alkyl groups are, as we saw when we discussed the nitration of toluene in Section 13.10, 
activating and ortho, para-directing substituents. Aryl and alkenyl substituents resemble 
alkyl groups in this respect; they too are activating and ortho, para-directing.

13.13 Substituent Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic 
Substitution: Strongly Deactivating Substituents
As Table 13.2 indicates, a number of substituents are meta-directing and strongly deac￾tivating. We have already discussed one of these, the trifluoromethyl group. Several

Because the carbon atom attached to the ring is positively polarized, a carbonyl group 
is strongly electron-withdrawing and behaves in much the same way as a trifluoromethyl 
group to destabilize all the cyclohexadienyl cation intermediates in electrophilic aromatic 
substitution. Reaction at any ring position in benzaldehyde is slower than in benzene. 
The intermediates for ortho and para substitution are particularly unstable because each 
has a resonance contributor in which there is a positive charge on the carbon that bears 
the electron-withdrawing group. The intermediate for meta substitution avoids this unfa￾vorable juxtaposition of positive charges, is not as unstable, and gives rise to most of 
the product. For the nitration of benzaldehyde:

13.14 Substituent Effects in Electrophilic 
Aromatic Substitution: Halogens
Returning to Table 13.2, notice that halogen substituents are ortho, para-directing, but deacti￾vating. Nitration of chlorobenzene is a typical example; its rate is some 30 times slower than 
the corresponding nitration of benzene, and the major products are o-chloronitrobenzene and 
p-chloronitrobenzene.

Problem 13.22
Reaction of chlorobenzene with p-chlorobenzyl chloride and aluminum chloride gave a 
mixture of two products in good yield (76%). What were these two products?
Rate and product studies of electrophilic aromatic substitution in halobenzenes 
reveal a fairly consistent pattern of reactivity. The partial rate factors for chlorination 
show that, with one exception, all the ring positions of fluoro-, chloro-, and bromo￾benzene are deactivated. The exception is the para position of fluorobenzene, which is 
slightly more reactive than a single position of benzene.

The range of reactivity is not large. Benzene undergoes chlorination only about 1.4 times 
faster than the most reactive of the group (fluorobenzene) and 14 times faster than the 
least reactive (bromobenzene). In each halobenzene the para position is the most reactive, 
followed by ortho.
Because we have come to associate activating substituents with ortho, para-directing 
effects and deactivating substituents with meta, the properties of halogen substituents 
appear on initial inspection to be unusual. The seeming inconsistency between regio￾selectivity and rate can be understood by analyzing the inductive and resonance effects 
of a halogen substituent.
Through its inductive effect, a halogen withdraws electrons from the ring by polar￾ization of the σ framework. The effect is greatest for fluorine, least for iodine.
X Inductive effect of halogen
attracts electrons from ring
This polarization, in turn, causes the ring carbons to bind the π electrons more tightly 
and raises the activation energy for electrophilic aromatic substitution, and decreases the 
reaction rate. Figure 13.8 illustrates this effect by comparing the electrostatic potential 
maps of fluorobenzene and benzene.506 Chapter 13 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
Like OH and NH2 groups, however, halogen substituents possess unshared 
electron pairs that can be donated to a positively charged carbon. This electron donation 
into the π system stabilizes the intermediates for ortho and para substitution.

Comparable stabilization of the intermediate for meta substitution is not possible. Thus, 
resonance involving their lone pairs causes halogens to be ortho, para-directing substituents.
The resonance effect is much greater for fluorine than for the other halogens. 
For resonance stabilization to be effective, the lone-pair p orbital of the substituent 
must overlap with the π system of the ring. The 2p orbital of fluorine is well suited 
for such overlap, but the 3p orbital of chlorine is not because of its more diffuse 
character and the longer CCl bond distance. The situation is even more pronounced 
for Br and I.
By stabilizing the cyclohexadienyl cation intermediate, lone-pair donation from 
fluorine counteracts the inductive effect to the extent that the rate of electrophilic aro￾matic substitution in fluorobenzene is usually only slightly less than that of benzene. 
With the other halogens, lone-pair donation is sufficient to make them ortho, para direc￾tors, but is less than that of fluorine.
13.15 Multiple Substituent Effects
When a benzene ring bears two or more substituents, both its reactivity and the site of 
further substitution can usually be predicted from the cumulative effects of its substituents.
In the simplest cases all the available sites are equivalent, and substitution at any 
one of them gives the same product.

which only a single product of 
electrophilic aromatic substitution is 
possible.
Benzene Fluorobenzene
Figure 13.8
Electrostatic potential maps of 
benzene and fluorobenzene. The high 
electronegativity of fluorine causes the 
π electrons of fluorobenzene to be more 
strongly held than those of benzene. 
This difference is reflected in the more 
pronounced red color associated with 
the π electrons of benzene. The color 
scale is the same for both models.13.15 Multiple Substituent Effects 507
Often the directing effects of substituents reinforce each other. Bromination of 
p-nitrotoluene, for example, takes place at the position that is ortho to the ortho, para￾directing methyl group and meta to the meta-directing nitro group.

In almost all cases, including most of those in which the directing effects of indi￾vidual substituents oppose each other, it is the more activating substituent that controls 
the regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution. Thus, bromination occurs ortho 
to the N-methylamino group in 4-chloro-N-methylaniline because this group is a very 
powerful activating substituent while the chlorine is weakly deactivating.

When two positions are comparably activated by alkyl groups, substitution usually

Sample Solution (a) Of the two substituents in p-methylbenzoic acid, the methyl group is 
more activating and controls the regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The 
position para to the ortho, para-directing methyl group already bears a substituent (the 
carboxyl group), and so substitution occurs ortho to the methyl group. This position is meta 
to the meta-directing carboxyl group, and the orienting properties of the two substituents 
reinforce each other. The product is 4-methyl-3-nitrobenzoic acid.

An exception to the rule that regioselectivity is controlled by the most activating 
substituent occurs when the directing effects of alkyl groups and halogen substituents 
oppose each other. Alkyl groups and halogen substituents are weakly activating and 
weakly deactivating, respectively, and the difference between them is too small to allow 
a simple generalization.
13.16 Retrosynthetic Analysis and the 
Synthesis of Substituted Benzenes
Because the regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution is controlled by the 
directing effects of substituents already present on the ring, the synthesis of more highly 
substituted derivatives requires that careful thought be given to the order in which the 
reactions are performed. Retrosynthetic analysis provides a useful guide.13.16 Retrosynthetic Analysis and the Synthesis of Substituted Benzenes 509
The analysis is often straightforward; one simply disconnects one of the substituents 
from the ring of the target molecule and examines the ring with respect to the directing 
properties of the remaining substituent. Consider m-bromoacetophenone:

Bromine is an ortho, para director, acetyl a meta director. Reasoning backward from the

step. Of the two approaches, only bromination of acetophenone delivers the desired meta 
relationship of the two substituents and suggests the following synthesis.

Although both substituents are meta-directing, the only practical synthesis involves 
nitration of acetophenone (disconnection a).

Aluminum chloride is a stronger Lewis

shown, the aromatic ring bears a

When the orientation of substituents in an aromatic compound precludes a synthe￾sis as straightforward as the preceding ones, functional-group manipulation can be useful. 
p-Nitrobenzoic acid, for example, can’t be prepared directly from either nitrobenzene or 
benzoic acid because each substituent is a meta director. However, by recognizing that 
the carboxyl group is accessible via oxidation of a methyl group, we can use nitration 
of toluene to gain the correct regiochemistry.

13.17 Substitution in Naphthalene
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution when 
treated with the same reagents that react with benzene. In general, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons are more reactive than benzene. Most lack the symmetry of benzene, how￾ever, and mixtures of products may be formed even on monosubstitution. Among poly￾cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we will discuss only naphthalene, and that only briefly.13.18 Substitution in Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds 511

control? Can you think of a reason why one isomer is more stable than the other?
13.18 Substitution in Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds
Their great variety of structural types causes heterocyclic aromatic compounds to range 
from exceedingly reactive to practically inert toward electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Pyridine lies near one extreme in being far less reactive than benzene toward sub￾stitution by electrophilic reagents. In this respect it resembles strongly deactivated aro￾matic compounds such as nitrobenzene. It is incapable of being acylated or alkylated 
under Friedel–Crafts conditions, but can be sulfonated at high temperature. Electrophilic 
substitution in pyridine, when it does occur, takes place at C-3.
N
Pyridine
SO3H
N
Pyridine-3-sulfonic acid
(71%)

One reason for the low reactivity of pyridine is that nitrogen is more electronegative 
than carbon, which causes the π electrons of pyridine to be held more tightly and raises 
the activation energy for bonding to an electrophile. Another is that the nitrogen of pyri￾dine is protonated in sulfuric acid and the resulting pyridinium ion is even more deacti￾vated than pyridine itself.512 Chapter 13 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
Lewis acid catalysts such as aluminum chloride and iron(III) halides also bond to 
nitrogen to strongly deactivate the ring toward Friedel–Crafts reactions and halogenation.
Pyrrole, furan, and thiophene, on the other hand, have electron-rich aromatic rings 
and are extremely reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution—more like phenol 
and aniline than benzene. Like benzene they have six π electrons, but these π electrons are 
delocalized over five atoms, not six, and are not held as strongly as those of benzene. Even 
when the ring atom is as electronegative as oxygen, substitution takes place readily.

13.19 Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
We have seen numerous examples of electrophilic aromatic substitution in this chapter. 
What about nucleophilic aromatic substitutions: reactions in which a nucleophile dis￾places a halogen substituent from the ring?13.19 Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution 513
In general, aryl halides are much less reactive than alkyl halides toward nucleophilic 
substitution. One reason for this is that breaking of the carbon–halogen bond is rate￾determining in both the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms and the carbon–halogen bonds of aryl 
halides are stronger than those of alkyl halides. A second reason, illustrated in Figure 13.9, 
is that the optimal transition state geometry for SN2 processes is inaccessible in aryl halides 
because the ring itself blocks approach of the nucleophile from the side opposite the 
carbon–halogen bond.
Aryl halides that bear electronegative substituents, most notably nitro, are an exception. 
These compounds do undergo nucleophilic substitution relatively readily. For example:

exceedingly unreactive, aryl fluorides undergo nucleophilic substitution when the ring 
bears an ortho- or para-nitro group. The reaction of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, known 
as Sanger’s reagent, with amino acids takes place readily at room temperature and is the 
basis of a method used in protein structure determination.

This unusual halide leaving-group behavior tells us that the rate-determining step in the 
mechanism cannot be carbon–halogen bond cleavage. Such a mechanism is described in 
the next section.
13.20 The Addition–Elimination Mechanism 
of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
Kinetic studies of nucleophilic aromatic substitutions reveal that they follow a second￾order rate law:
Rate = k[Aryl halide][Nucleophile]
which suggests a biomolecular rate-determining step. In this case, then, we look for a mech￾anism in which both the aryl halide and the nucleophile are involved in the slowest step.
The generally accepted mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution in nitro￾substituted aryl halides, illustrated for the reaction of p-fluoronitrobenzene with sodium 
methoxide, is outlined in Mechanism 13.6. It is a two-step addition–elimination mechanism,
in which addition of the nucleophile to the aryl halide is followed by elimination of 
the halide leaving group. The mechanism is consistent with the following experimental 
observations:
1. Kinetics: Consistent with the observed second-order rate law, the rate-determining 
step (step 1) involves both the aryl halide and the nucleophile.
2. Rate-enhancing effect of the nitro group: The nucleophilic addition step is rate￾determining because the aromatic character of the ring must be sacrificed to form 
the cyclohexadienyl anion intermediate. Only when the anionic intermediate is sta￾bilized by the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing substituent ortho or para 
to the leaving group will the activation energy for its formation be low enough to 
This mechanism is sometimes called 
SNAr (substitution-nucleophilic￾aromatic).13.20 The Addition–Elimination Mechanism of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution 515

m-Fluoronitrobenzene reacts with sodium methoxide 105
 times more slowly than 
its ortho and para isomers. According to the resonance description, direct conjugation of 
the negatively charged carbon with the nitro group is not possible in the cyclohexadienyl 
anion intermediate from m-fluoronitrobenzene, and the decreased reaction rate reflects 
the decreased stabilization afforded this intermediate.

Reaction of 1,2,3-tribromo-5-nitrobenzene with sodium ethoxide in ethanol gave a single

3. Leaving-group effects: Because aryl fluorides have the strongest carbon–halogen 
bond yet react fastest, the rate-determining step cannot involve carbon–halogen bond 
cleavage. According to Mechanism 13.6 the carbon–halogen bond breaks in the rapid 
elimination step that follows the rate-determining addition step. The unusually high 
reactivity of aryl fluorides arises because fluorine is the most electronegative of the 
halogens, and its greater ability to attract electrons increases the rate of formation 
of the cyclohexadienyl anion intermediate in the first step of the mechanism.

Before leaving this mechanistic discussion, we should mention that the addition–
elimination mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution illustrates a principle 
worth remembering. The words activating and deactivating as applied to substituent 
effects in organic chemistry are without meaning when they stand alone. When we 
say that a group is activating or deactivating, we need to specify the reaction type 
that is being considered. A nitro group is a strongly deactivating substituent in elec￾trophilic aromatic substitution, where it markedly destabilizes the key cyclohexadienyl 
cation intermediate:

A nitro group behaves the same way in both reactions: it attracts electrons. Reaction is 
retarded when electrons flow from the aromatic ring to the attacking species (electro￾philic aromatic substitution). Reaction is facilitated when electrons flow from the attack￾ing species to the aromatic ring (nucleophilic aromatic substitution). By being aware of 
the connection between reactivity and substituent effects, you will sharpen your appre￾ciation of how chemical reactions occur.
13.21 Related Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions
The most common types of aryl halides in nucleophilic aromatic substitutions are those 
that bear ortho- or para-nitro substituents. Among other classes of reactive aryl halides, 
a few merit special consideration. One class includes highly fluorinated aromatic com￾pounds such as hexafluorobenzene, which undergoes substitution of one of its fluorines 
on reaction with nucleophiles such as sodium methoxide.

Here it is the combined electron-attracting inductive effects of the six fluorine substitu￾ents that stabilize the cyclohexadienyl anion intermediate and permit the reaction to 
proceed so readily.
Problem 13.33
Write equations describing the addition–elimination mechanism for the reaction of 
hexafluorobenzene with sodium methoxide, clearly showing the structure of the rate￾determining intermediate.
Halides derived from certain heterocyclic aromatic compounds are often quite reac￾tive toward nucleophiles. 2-Chloropyridine, for example, reacts with sodium methoxide 
some 230 million times faster than chlorobenzene at 50°C.

Again, rapid reaction is attributed to the stability of the intermediate formed in the addi￾tion step. In contrast to chlorobenzene, where the negative charge of the intermediate 
must be borne by carbon, the anionic intermediate in the case of 2-chloropyridine has 
its negative charge on nitrogen. Because nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, 
the intermediate is more stable and is formed faster than the one from chlorobenzene.518 Chapter 13 Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution
Problem 13.34
Offer an explanation for the observation that 4-chloropyridine is more reactive toward 
nucleophiles than 3-chloropyridine.
The reactivity of 2-chloropyridines and analogous compounds can be enhanced by 
the presence of strongly electron-withdrawing groups. In the following example, the 
chlorine leaving group is activated toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution by both of 
the ring nitrogens and is ortho to the electron-withdrawing cyano group as well. Substi￾tution by ammonia takes place at 0°C to give a 96% yield of product.

Very strong bases can bring about nucleophilic aromatic substitution by a 
mechanism other than the one we have been discussing. The intermediate in this other 
mechanism, outlined in the Descriptive Passage at the end of this chapter, may 
surprise you.
Section 13.1 On reaction with electrophilic reagents, compounds that contain a benzene ring 
undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution. Table 13.1 in Section 13.1 and 
Table 13.3 in this summary give examples.
Section 13.2 The mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution involves two stages: bonding 
of the electrophile by the π electrons of the ring (slow, rate-determining), followed 
by rapid loss of a proton to restore the aromaticity of the ring.

Section 13.9 Substituents on an aromatic ring can influence both the rate and regioselectivity
of electrophilic aromatic substitution. Substituents are classified as activating or 
deactivating according to whether they cause electrophilic aromatic substitution 
to occur more rapidly or less rapidly than benzene. With respect to regioselectivity, 
substituents are either ortho, para-directing or meta-directing. A methyl group 
is activating and ortho, para-directing. A trifluoromethyl group is deactivating 
and meta-directing.

substitution results from their effect on carbocation stability. An electron-releasing

TABLE 13.4 Limitations on Friedel–Crafts Reactions
1. The organic halide that reacts with the arene 
must be an alkyl halide (Section 13.6) or an 
acyl halide (Section 13.7).
Vinylic halides and aryl halides do not form 
carbocations under conditions of the Friedel–
Crafts reaction and so cannot be used in place 
of an alkyl halide or an acyl halide.
These will react with benzene under Friedel–Crafts conditions:
CH2Cl
H
Cl Cl
O
Alkyl halide Benzylic halide Acyl halide
These will not react with benzene under Friedel–Crafts conditions:
Cl Cl
Vinylic halide Aryl halide
2. Rearrangement of alkyl groups can occur
(Section 13.6).
Rearrangement is especially prevalent with primary alkyl halides of the type 
RCH2CH2X and R2CHCH2X. Aluminum chloride induces ionization with 
rearrangement to give a more stable carbocation. Benzylic halides and acyl 
halides do not rearrange.
3. Strongly deactivated aromatic rings do not 
undergo Friedel–Crafts alkylation or 
acylation (Section 13.16). Friedel–Crafts 
alkylations and acylations fail when applied to 
compounds of the following type, where EWG 
is a strongly electron-withdrawing group:

4. It is sometimes difficult to limit Friedel–Crafts 
alkylation to monoalkylation. Only 
monoacylation occurs during Friedel–Crafts 
acylation.
The first alkyl group that goes on makes the ring more reactive toward further 
substitution because alkyl groups are activating substituents. Monoacylation 
is possible because the first acyl group to go on is strongly electron￾withdrawing and deactivates the ring toward further substitution.substituent stabilizes the cyclohexadienyl cation intermediates leading to ortho

Substituents can be arranged into three major categories:
1. Activating and ortho, para-directing: These substituents stabilize the 
cyclohexadienyl cation formed in the rate-determining step. They include 
NR2, OR, R, Ar, and related species. The most strongly 
activating members of this group are bonded to the ring by a nitrogen or 
oxygen atom that bears an unshared pair of electrons.
2. Deactivating and ortho, para-directing: The halogens are the most 
prominent members of this class. They withdraw electron density from all 
the ring positions by an inductive effect, making halobenzenes less reactive 
than benzene. Lone-pair electron donation stabilizes the cyclohexadienyl 
cation intermediates for ortho and para substitution more than those for 
meta substitution.
3. Deactivating and meta-directing: These substituents are strongly electron￾withdrawing and destabilize carbocations. They include
CH3, CR, C N, NO2
O
and related species. All the ring positions are deactivated, but because the 
meta positions are deactivated less than the ortho and para, meta substitution 
is favored.
Section 13.15 When two or more substituents are present on a ring, the regioselectivity of 
electrophilic aromatic substitution is generally controlled by the directing effect 
of the more powerful activating substituent.
Section 13.16 The order in which substituents are introduced onto a benzene ring needs to be 
considered in order to prepare the desired isomer in a multistep synthesis.
Section 13.17 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons undergo the same kind of electrophilic 
aromatic substitution reactions as benzene.
Section 13.18 Heterocyclic aromatic compounds may be more reactive or less reactive than 
benzene. Pyridine is much less reactive than benzene, but pyrrole, furan, and 
thiophene are more reactive. Pyridine undergoes substitution at C-3, whereas 
pyrrole, furan, and thiophene give mainly C-2-substituted products.

Section 13.19 Aryl halides are less reactive than alkyl halides in nucleophilic substitution 
reactions. Nucleophilic substitution in aryl halides is facilitated by the presence

On the basis of the labeling experiment, an alternative mechanism was proposed for the substitution 
reaction of aryl halides with strong base—the elimination–addition mechanism. In the first step, 
the elimination stage, amide anion removes a proton from the carbon on the ring adjacent to the 
one with the halogen. The product is an unstable intermediate known as benzyne.

The triple bond in benzyne is different from the usual triple bond of an alkyne. In benzyne, one 
of the π components of the triple bond results from p–p overlap and is part of the delocalized 
π system of the aromatic ring. The second π component, which results from overlapping adjacent 
sp2
-hybridized orbitals, lies in the plane of the ring and is not part of the aromatic π system, as 
shown in Figure 13.10.

The intermediacy of benzyne in the elimination–addition mechanism for aryl halides 
accounts for the regioselectivity observed in the substitution reactions of labeled chlorobenzene 
and o-bromotoluene because both can give only a single aryne intermediate. Attack at either of 
the aryne carbons gives rise to the products.
The triple bond in benzyne is strained and is a dienophile in Diels–Alder reactions. 
Alternative methods exist for the generation of benzyne in cycloadditions and other synthetic 
applications. In the following example, o-bromofluorobenzene is treated with magnesium in 
tetrahydrofuran (THF). When carried out in the presence of cyclohexadiene, a Diels–Alder reaction

Spectroscopy
Until the second half of the twentieth century, the structure of 
a substance—a newly discovered natural product, for example—
was determined using information obtained from chemical reac￾tions. This information included the identification of functional 
groups by chemical tests, along with the results of experiments 
in which the substance was broken down into smaller, more 
readily identifiable fragments. Typical of this approach is the 
demonstration of the presence of a double bond in an alkene 
by catalytic hydrogenation and determination of its location by 
ozonolysis. After considering all the available chemical evi￾dence, the chemist proposed a candidate structure (or struc￾tures) consistent with the observations. Proof of structure was 
provided either by converting the substance to some already 
known compound or by an independent synthesis.
Qualitative tests and chemical degradation have given way 
to instrumental methods of structure determination. The main 
methods and the structural clues they provide are:
■ Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
which tells us about the carbon skeleton and the environ￾ments of the hydrogens attached to it.
■ Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, which reveals the presence 
or signals the absence of key functional groups.
Palytoxin is one of the most toxic substances known. It is produced by a 
seaweed-like coral found in Hawaii known as limu-make-o-Hana and has the 
formula C129H223N3O54. NMR spectroscopy played a key role in the assignment 
of the structure of palytoxin.

■ Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, which probes the electron distribution, 
especially in molecules that have conjugated π electron systems.
■ Mass spectrometry (MS), which gives the molecular weight and formula, of both 
the molecule itself and various structural units within it.
As diverse as these techniques are, all of them are based on the absorption of energy by 
a molecule, and all measure how a molecule responds to that absorption. In describing 
these techniques our emphasis will be on their application to structure determination. 
We’ll start with a brief discussion of electromagnetic radiation, which is the source of 
the energy that a molecule absorbs in NMR, IR, and UV-VIS spectroscopy. Mass spec￾trometry is unique in that, instead of electromagnetic radiation, its energy source is a 
stream of charged particles such as electrons.
14.1 Principles of Molecular Spectroscopy: 
Electromagnetic Radiation
Electromagnetic radiation, of which visible light is but one example, has the properties 
of both particles and waves. The particles are called photons, and each possesses an 
amount of energy referred to as a quantum. In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck 
proposed that the energy of a photon (E) is directly proportional to its frequency (ν).
E = hν
The SI units of frequency are reciprocal seconds (s−1), given the name hertz and the 
symbol Hz in honor of the nineteenth-century physicist Heinrich R. Hertz. The constant 
of proportionality h is called Planck’s constant and has the value
h = 6.63 × 10−34 J ⋅ s
Electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light (c = 3.0 × 108
 m/s), which 
is equal to the product of its frequency ν and its wavelength λ:
c = νλ
The range of photon energies is called the electromagnetic spectrum and is shown in 
Figure 14.1. Visible light occupies a very small region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
“Modern” physics dates from Planck’s 
proposal that energy is quantized, 
which set the stage for the develop￾ment of quantum mechanics. Planck 
received the 1918 Nobel Prize in 
Physics.

The electromagnetic spectrum. 536 Chapter 14 Spectroscopy
It is characterized by wavelengths of 400 nm (violet) to 800 nm (red). When examining 
Figure 14.1 be sure to keep the following two relationships in mind:
1. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength; the greater the frequency, the 
shorter the wavelength.
2. Energy is directly proportional to frequency; electromagnetic radiation of higher 
frequency possesses more energy than radiation of lower frequency.
Gamma rays and X-rays are streams of very high energy photons. Radio waves are 
of relatively low energy. Ultraviolet radiation is of higher energy than the violet end of 
visible light. Infrared radiation is of lower energy than the red end of visible light. When 
a molecule is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, it may absorb a photon, increasing 
its energy by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. Molecules are highly selec￾tive with respect to the frequencies they absorb. Only photons of certain specific frequen￾cies are absorbed by a molecule. The particular photon energies absorbed by a molecule 
depend on molecular structure and are measured with instruments called spectrometers.
The data obtained are very sensitive indicators of molecular structure.
14.2 Principles of Molecular Spectroscopy: 
Quantized Energy States
What determines whether electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by a molecule? The most 
important requirement is that the energy of the photon must equal the energy difference 
between two states, such as two nuclear spin states (NMR), two vibrational states (IR), or 
two electronic states (UV-VIS). In physics, the term for this is resonance—the transfer of 
energy between two objects that occurs when their frequencies are matched. In molecular 
spectroscopy, we are concerned with the transfer of energy from a photon to a molecule. 
Consider, for example, two energy states of a molecule designated E1 and E2 in Figure 14.2. 
The energy difference between them is E2 − E1, or ΔE. Unlike kinetic energy, which is 
continuous, meaning that all values of kinetic energy are available to a molecule, only cer￾tain energies are possible for electronic, vibrational, and nuclear spin states. These energy 
states are said to be quantized. More of the molecules exist in the lower-energy state E1
than in the higher-energy state E2. Excitation of a molecule from a lower state to a higher 
one requires the addition of an increment of energy equal to ΔE. Thus, when electromagnetic 
radiation strikes a molecule, only the frequency with energy equal to ΔE is absorbed.
Spectrometers are designed to measure the absorption of electromagnetic radiation 
by a sample. Basically, a spectrometer consists of a source of radiation, a compartment 
containing the sample through which the radiation passes, and a detector. The frequency 
of radiation is continuously varied, and its intensity at the detector is compared with that 
at the source. When the frequency is reached at which the sample absorbs radiation, the 
detector senses a decrease in intensity. The relation between frequency and absorption is 
plotted as a spectrum, which consists of a series of peaks at characteristic frequencies. Its 
interpretation can furnish structural information. Each type of spectroscopy developed inde￾pendently of the others, and so the data format is different for each one. An NMR spectrum 
looks different from an IR spectrum, and both look different from a UV-VIS spectrum.
With this as background, we will now discuss spectroscopic techniques individually. 
NMR, IR, and UV-VIS spectroscopy provide complementary information, and all are 
useful. Among them, NMR provides the information that is most directly related to 
molecular structure and is the one we’ll examine first.
14.3 Introduction to 1
H NMR Spectroscopy
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy depends on the absorption of energy when the 
nucleus of an atom is excited from its lowest-energy spin state to the next higher one. 
The nuclei of many elements can be studied by NMR, and the two elements that are the 
most common in organic molecules (carbon and hydrogen) have isotopes (1
H and 13C)

capable of giving NMR spectra that are rich in structural information. A proton nuclear 
magnetic resonance (1
H NMR) spectrum tells us about the environments of the various 
hydrogens in a molecule; a carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectrum 
does the same for the carbon atoms. Separately and together 1
H and 13C NMR take us 
a long way toward determining a substance’s molecular structure. We’ll develop most of 
the general principles of NMR by discussing 1
H NMR, then extend them to 13C NMR. 
The 13C NMR discussion is shorter, not because it is less important than 1
H NMR, but 
because many of the same principles apply to both techniques.
Like an electron, a proton has two spin states with quantum numbers of +_1
2 and −_1
2. 
There is no difference in energy between these two nuclear spin states; a proton is just 
as likely to have a spin of +_1
2 as −_1
2. Absorption of electromagnetic radiation can occur 
only when the two spin states have different energies. A way to make them different is 
to place the sample in a magnetic field. A spinning proton behaves like a tiny bar mag￾net and has a magnetic moment associated with it (Figure 14.3). In the presence of an 
external magnetic field B0, the spin state in which the magnetic moment of the nucleus 
is aligned with B0 is lower in energy than the one in which it opposes B0.
As shown in Figure 14.4, the energy difference between the two states is directly 
proportional to the strength of the applied field. Net absorption of electromagnetic 
radiation requires that the lower state be more highly populated than the higher one, 
and quite strong magnetic fields are required to achieve the separation necessary to give 
a detectable signal. A magnetic field of 4.7 T, which is about 100,000 times stronger 
than Earth’s magnetic field, separates the two spin states of a proton by only 8 × 10−5 kJ/mol 
(1.9 × 10−5 kcal/mol). From Planck’s equation ΔE = hν, this energy gap corresponds to 
Nuclear magnetic resonance of 
protons was first detected in 1946 by 
Edward Purcell (Harvard) and by Felix 
Bloch (Stanford). Purcell and Bloch 
shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in 
Physics.
The SI unit for magnetic field strength 
is the tesla (T), named after Nikola 
Tesla, a contemporary of Thomas 
Edison and who, like Edison, was an 
inventor of electrical devices.

Problem 14.1
Most of the NMR spectra in this text were recorded on a spectrometer having a field strength 
of 7 T (300 MHz for 1
H). The first generation of widely used NMR spectrometers were 60-MHz 
instruments. What was the magnetic field strength of these earlier spectrometers? What is the 
field strength of the 920-MHz instruments receiving increasing use?
The response of an atom to the strength of the external magnetic field is different 
for different elements, and for different isotopes of the same element. The resonance fre￾quencies of most nuclei are sufficiently different that an NMR experiment is sensitive only 
to a particular isotope of a single element. The frequency for 1
H is 300 MHz at 7 T, but 
that for 13C is 75.6 MHz. Thus, when recording the NMR spectrum of an organic com￾pound, we see signals only for 1
H or 13C, but not both; 1
H and 13C NMR spectra are 
recorded in separate experiments with different instrument settings.
Problem 14.2
What will be the 13C frequency of an NMR spectrometer that operates at 400 MHz for protons?
The essential features of an NMR spectrometer consist of a powerful magnet to 
align the nuclear spins, a radiofrequency (rf) transmitter as a source of energy to excite 
a nucleus from its lowest-energy state to the next higher one, and a way to monitor the 
absorption of rf radiation and display the spectrum.
NMR spectra are acquired using pulsed Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic reso￾nance (FT-NMR) spectrometers (Figure 14.5). The sample is placed in a magnetic field 
and irradiated with a short, intense burst of rf radiation (the pulse), which excites all of 
the protons in the molecule at the same time. The magnetic field associated with the 
new orientation of nuclear spins induces an electrical signal in the receiver that decreases 
as the nuclei return to their original orientation. The resulting free-induction decay (FID) 
is a composite of the decay patterns of all of the protons in the molecule. The FID pat￾tern is stored in a computer and converted into a spectrum by a mathematical process 
known as a Fourier transform. The pulse-relaxation sequence takes only about a second. 
The signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced by repeating the sequence many times, then averag￾ing the data. Noise is random and averaging causes it to vanish; signals always appear 
at the same frequency and accumulate. All of the operations—the interval between 
pulses, collecting, storing, and averaging the data and converting it to a spectrum by a 
Fourier transform—are under computer control, which makes the actual recording of an 
FT-NMR spectrum a routine operation.

H nuclei in general without regard for the environ￾ments of individual protons in a molecule. Protons in a molecule are connected to other 
atoms—carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and so on—by covalent bonds. The electrons in these 
bonds, indeed all the electrons in a molecule, affect the magnetic environment of the 
protons. Alone, a proton would feel the full strength of the external field, but a proton 
in an organic molecule responds to both the external field and any local fields within

the molecule. An external magnetic field affects the motion of the electrons in a mole￾cule, inducing local fields characterized by lines of force that circulate in the opposite
direction from the applied field (Figure 14.6). Thus, the net field felt by a proton in a 
molecule will always be less than the applied field, and the proton is said to be shielded.
All of the protons of a molecule are shielded from the applied field by the electrons, but 
some are less shielded than others. The term deshielded is often used to describe this 
decreased shielding of one proton relative to another.
The more shielded a proton is, the greater must be the strength of the applied field in 
order to achieve resonance and produce a signal. A more shielded proton absorbs rf radiation 
at higher field strength (upfield) compared with one at lower field strength (downfield). 
Different protons give signals at different field strengths. The dependence of the resonance 
position of a nucleus that results from its molecular environment is called its chemical shift.
This is where the real power of NMR lies. The chemical shifts of various protons in a 
molecule can be different and are characteristic of particular structural features.
Figure 14.7 shows the 1
H NMR spectrum of chloroform (CHCl3) to illustrate how 
the terminology just developed applies to a real spectrum.
Instead of measuring chemical shifts in absolute terms, we measure them with 
respect to a standard—tetramethylsilane (CH3)4Si, abbreviated TMS. The protons of TMS 
are more shielded than those of most organic compounds, so all of the signals in a 
sample ordinarily appear at lower field than those of the TMS reference. When measured 
using a 100-MHz instrument, the signal for the proton in chloroform (CHCl3), for exam￾ple, appears 728 Hz downfield from the TMS signal. But because frequency is propor￾tional to magnetic field strength, the same signal would appear 2184 Hz downfield from 
TMS on a 300-MHz instrument. We simplify the reporting of chemical shifts by convert￾ing them to parts per million (ppm) downfield from TMS, which is assigned a value of 0. 
The TMS need not actually be present in the sample, nor even appear in the spectrum 
in order to serve as a reference. When chemical shifts are reported this way, they are 
identified by the symbol δ and are independent of the magnetic field strength.

Problem 14.3
The 1
H NMR signal for bromoform (CHBr3) appears at 2065 Hz when recorded on a 300-MHz 
NMR spectrometer. (a) What is the chemical shift of this proton? (b) If the spectrum was 
recorded on a 400-MHz instrument, what would be the chemical shift of the CHBr3 proton? 
(c) How many hertz downfield from TMS is the signal when recorded on a 400-MHz instrument?
NMR spectra are usually run in solution and, although chloroform is a good 
solvent for most organic compounds, it’s rarely used because its own signal at δ 7.28 
would be so intense that it would obscure signals in the sample. Because the magnetic 
properties of deuterium (D = 2
H) are different from those of 1
H, CDCl3 gives no 
signals at all in a 1
H NMR spectrum and is the most commonly used solvent in 
1
H NMR spectroscopy. Likewise, D2O is used instead of H2O for water-soluble 
substances such as carbohydrates.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is such a powerful tool for structure determina￾tion because protons in different environments experience different degrees of shielding 
and have different chemical shifts. In compounds of the type CH3X, for example, the 
shielding of the methyl protons increases as X becomes less electronegative.

Inasmuch as the shielding is due to the electrons, it isn’t surprising to find that the 
chemical shift depends on the degree to which X draws electrons away from the methyl 
group. A similar trend is seen in the methyl halides, in which the protons in CH3F are 
the least shielded (δ 4.3) and those of CH3I (δ 2.2) are the most.
The decreased shielding caused by electronegative substituents is primarily an 
inductive effect and, like other inductive effects, falls off rapidly as the number of bonds 
between the substituent and the proton increases. Compare the chemical shifts of the 
protons in propane and 1-nitropropane.

Given that the chemical shift of methane is δ 0.2, we attribute the decreased shielding 
of the protons of RCH3, R2CH2, and R3CH to the number of carbons attached to primary, 
secondary, and tertiary carbons, respectively. Carbon is more electronegative than hydro￾gen, so replacing the hydrogens of CH4 by one, then two, then three carbons decreases 
the shielding of the remaining protons.
Likewise, the generalization that sp2

sp3

protons.

The main contributor to the deshielding of vinylic and aryl protons is the induced mag￾netic field associated with π electrons. We saw earlier in Section 14.4 that the local field 
resulting from electrons in a CH σ bond opposes the applied field and shields a mol￾ecule’s protons. The hydrogens of ethylene and benzene, however, lie in a region of the 
molecule where the induced magnetic field of the π electrons reinforces the applied field, 
deshielding the protons (Figure 14.9). In the case of benzene, this is described as a ring 
current effect that originates in the circulating π electrons. It has interesting conse￾quences, some of which are described in the boxed essay Ring Currents: Aromatic and 
Antiaromatic, which appears later in this section.
The induced field of CC and aryl groups contributes to the deshielding of allylic

Acetylenic hydrogens are unusual in that they are more shielded than we would 
expect for protons bonded to sp-hybridized carbon. This is because the π electrons 
circulate around the triple bond, not along it (Figure 14.10a). Therefore, the induced 
magnetic field is parallel to the long axis of the triple bond and shields the acetylenic 
proton (Figure 14.10b). Acetylenic protons typically have chemical shifts in the range 
δ 1.8–3.1.

The chemical shifts of OH and NH protons vary much more than those of 
protons bonded to carbon. This is because OH and NH groups can be involved in 
intermolecular hydrogen bonding, the extent of which depends on molecular structure, 
temperature, concentration, and solvent. Generally, an increase in hydrogen bonding 
decreases the shielding. This is especially evident in carboxylic acids. With δ values in 
the 10–12 ppm range, OH protons of carboxylic acids are the least shielded of all of 
the protons in Figure 14.8. Hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acids is stronger than in most 
other classes of compounds that contain OH groups.

Ring Currents: Aromatic and Antiaromatic
We saw in Chapter 12 that aromaticity reveals itself in vari￾ous ways. Qualitatively, aromatic compounds are more 
stable and less reactive than alkenes. Quantitatively, their heats 
of hydrogenation are smaller than expected. Theory, especially 
Hückel’s rule, furnishes a structural basis for aromaticity. Now 
let’s examine some novel features of the NMR spectra of aro￾matic compounds.
We have mentioned that the protons in benzene appear 
at relatively low field because of deshielding by the magnetic 
field associated with the circulating π electrons. The amount of 
deshielding is sufficiently large—on the order of 2 ppm more 
than the corresponding effect in alkenes—that its presence is 
generally accepted as evidence for aromaticity. We speak of this 
deshielding as resulting from an aromatic ring current.
Something interesting happens when we go beyond ben￾zene to apply the aromatic ring current test to annulenes.
[18]Annulene satisfies the Hückel (4n + 2) π electron rule 
for aromaticity, and many of its properties indicate aromaticity 
(Section 12.19). As shown in Figure 14.11a, [18]annulene contains 
two different kinds of protons; 12 lie on the ring’s periphery 
(“outside”), and 6 reside near the middle of the molecule 
(“inside”). The 2:1 ratio of outside/inside protons makes it easy to 
assign the signals in the 1
H NMR spectrum. The outside protons 
have a chemical shift δ of 9.3 ppm, which makes them even less 
shielded than those of benzene. The six inside protons, on the 
other hand, have a negative chemical shift (δ−3.0), meaning that 
the signal for these protons appears at higher field (to the right) 
of the TMS peak. The inside protons of [18]annulene are more 
than 12 ppm more shielded than the outside protons.
As shown in Figure 14.11a, both the shielding of the inside 
protons and the deshielding of the outside ones result from the 
same aromatic ring current. When the molecule is placed in an 
external magnetic field B0, its circulating π electrons produce 
their own magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied 
field B0 in the center of the molecule, shielding the inside pro￾tons. Because the induced magnetic field closes on itself, the 
outside protons lie in a region where the induced field rein￾forces B0. The aromatic ring current in [18]annulene shields the 
6 inside protons and deshields the 12 outside ones.
Exactly the opposite happens in [16]annulene (Figure 14.11b). 
Now it is the outside protons (δ 5.3) that are more shielded. The 
inside protons (δ 10.6) are less shielded than the outside ones and 
less shielded than the protons of both benzene and [18]annulene. 
This reversal of the shielding and deshielding regions in going 
from [18] to [16]annulene can only mean that the directions of their 
induced magnetic fields are reversed. Thus, [16]annulene, which 
has 4n π electrons and is antiaromatic, not only lacks an aromatic 
ring current, its π electrons produce exactly the opposite effect 
when placed in a magnetic field.
Score one for Hückel.

aromatic ring current in [18]annulene shields the inside protons and deshields the outside protons. The opposite occurs in [16]annulene, which is 
antiaromatic.

H NMR Spectra 547
It is common for several different kinds of protons to have similar chemical 
shifts. The range covered for 1
H chemical shifts is only 12 ppm, which is relatively 
small compared with (as we’ll see) the 200-ppm range for 13C chemical shifts. The 
ability of an NMR spectrometer to separate signals that have similar chemical shifts 
is termed its resolving power and is directly related to the magnetic field strength of 
the instrument. Even though the δ values of their chemical shifts in parts per million 
don’t change, two signals that are closely spaced at 60 MHz become well separated 
at 300 MHz.
14.6 Interpreting 1
H NMR Spectra
In addition to suggesting what structural units might be present from the chemical shifts, 
an NMR spectrum provides other useful information.
1. The number of signals, which tells us how many different kinds of protons there are.
2. The intensity of the signals as measured by the area under each peak, which tells 
us the relative ratios of the different kinds of protons.
3. The multiplicity, or splitting, of each signal, which tells us how many protons are 
vicinal to the one giving the signal.
Protons that have different chemical shifts are said to be chemical-shift-nonequivalent
(or chemically nonequivalent). A separate NMR signal is given for each chemical-shift￾nonequivalent proton in a substance. Figure 14.12 shows the 300-MHz 1
H NMR spec￾trum of methoxyacetonitrile (CH3OCH2CN), a molecule with protons in two different 
environments. The three protons in the CH3O group constitute one set, the two protons 
in the OCH2CN group the other, and both can be assigned based on their chemical shifts. 
The protons in the OCH2CN group are connected to a carbon that bears two electronega￾tive substituents (O and CN), are less shielded, and have a larger chemical shift (δ 4.2) 
than protons of the CH3O group (δ 3.4), which are attached to a carbon that bears only 
one electronegative atom (O).
Another aid for assigning the peaks is to compare their areas. The three equivalent 
protons of the CH3O group give rise to a taller peak than the two equivalent protons of 
the OCH2CN group. Comparing the heights of the peaks in this spectrum works for this 
case, but it is generally better to compare peak areas. Peak areas are displayed electroni￾cally when the NMR spectrum appears on the computer screen or are printed with an 
integration curve. The relative computer-generated numerical values of the peak areas 
are proportional to the number of equivalent protons responsible for that signal. Thus, a 
3:2 ratio of areas can, as in the case of CH3OCH2CN, correspond to a 3:2 ratio of protons. 
But in some other compound a 3:2 ratio of areas might correspond to a 6:4 or 9:6 ratio 
of protons.
Recall (Section 9.7) that two atoms or 
groups are vicinal to each other if they 
are attached to adjacent carbons.

The 300-MHz 1
H NMR spectrum of 1,4-dimethylbenzene looks exactly like that of 
CH3OCH2CN except the chemical shifts of the two peaks are δ 2.2 and δ 7.0. Assign the 
peaks to the appropriate protons of 1,4-dimethylbenzene.
Protons in equivalent environments have the same chemical shift. Often it is an 
easy matter to decide, simply by inspection, whether protons are equivalent or not. In 
more difficult cases, mentally replacing a proton in a molecule by a “test group” can 
help. We’ll illustrate the procedure for a simple case—the protons of propane. To see if 
they have the same chemical shift, replace one of the methyl protons at C-1 by chlorine, 
then do the same thing for a proton at C-3. Both replacements give the same molecule, 
1-chloropropane. Therefore, the methyl protons at C-1 are equivalent to those at C-3.

If the two structures produced by replacement of two different hydrogens in a molecule 
by a test group are the same, the hydrogens are chemically equivalent. Thus, the six 
methyl protons of propane are all chemically equivalent to one another and have the same 
chemical shift.
Replacement of either one of the methylene protons of propane generates 2-chloro￾propane. Both methylene protons are equivalent. Neither of them is equivalent to any of 
the methyl protons.
The 1
H NMR spectrum of propane contains two signals: one for the six equivalent 
methyl protons, the other for the pair of equivalent methylene protons.

accidental overlap, we expect to find four signals in the NMR spectrum of 1-bromobutane.
Chemical-shift nonequivalence can occur when two environments are stereochemically 
different. The two vinyl protons of 2-bromopropene have different chemical shifts.

One of the vinyl protons is cis to bromine; the other trans. Replacing one of the vinyl 
protons by some test group, say, chlorine, gives the Z isomer of 2-bromo-1-chloropropene; 
replacing the other gives the E stereoisomer. The E and Z forms of 2-bromo￾1-chloropropene are diastereomers. Protons that yield diastereomers on being replaced 
by some test group are diastereotopic and can have different chemical shifts. Because 
their environments are similar, however, the chemical-shift difference is usually small, 
and it sometimes happens that two diastereotopic protons accidentally have the same 
chemical shift. Recording the spectrum on a higher field NMR spectrometer is often 
helpful in resolving signals with similar chemical shifts.

At the beginning of this section we noted that an NMR spectrum provides structural

multiplicity, or splitting, of the peaks. We have discussed the first three of these features 
of 1
H NMR spectroscopy. Let’s now turn our attention to peak splitting to see what kind 
of information it offers.
14.7 Spin–Spin Splitting and 1
H NMR
The 1
H NMR spectrum of CH3OCH2CN (Figure 14.12) displayed in the preceding section 
is relatively simple because both signals are singlets; that is, each one consists of a single 
peak. It is quite common though to see a signal for a particular proton appear not as a singlet, 
but as a collection of peaks. The signal may be split into two peaks (a doublet), three peaks 
Enantiotopic protons can have 
different chemical shifts in an 
enantiomerically enriched chiral 
solvent. Because the customary 
solvent (CDCl3) used in NMR 
measurements is achiral, this 
phenomenon is not observed in 
routine work.550 Chapter 14 Spectroscopy
(a triplet), four peaks (a quartet), or even more. Figure 14.13 shows the 300-MHz 1
H NMR 
spectrum of 1,1-dichloroethane (CH3CHCl2), which is characterized by a doublet centered at 
δ 2.1 for the methyl protons and a quartet at δ 5.9 for the methine proton.
The number of peaks into which the signal for a particular proton is split is called 
its multiplicity. For simple cases the rule that allows us to predict splitting in 1
H NMR 
spectroscopy is
Multiplicity of signal for Ha = n + 1
where n is equal to the number of equivalent protons that are vicinal to Ha. Two protons 
are vicinal to each other when they are bonded to adjacent atoms. Protons vicinal to Ha
are separated from Ha by three bonds. The three methyl protons of 1,1-dichloroethane 
are equivalent and vicinal to the methine proton and split its signal into a quartet. The 
single methine proton, in turn, splits the methyl protons’ signal into a doublet.
This proton splits the signal for the
methyl protons into a doublet. These three protons split the signal
for the methine proton into a quartet.

The physical basis for peak splitting in 1,1-dichloroethane can be explained with 
the aid of Figure 14.14, which examines how the chemical shift of the methyl protons 
is affected by the spin of the methine proton. There are two magnetic environments for 
the methyl protons: one in which the magnetic moment of the methine proton is parallel 
to the applied field, and the other in which it is antiparallel to it. When the magnetic 
moment of the methine proton is parallel to the applied field, it reinforces it. This 
decreases the shielding of the methyl protons and causes their signal to appear at slightly 
Complex splitting patterns conform to 
an extension of the “n + 1” rule and 
will be discussed in Section 14.11.

The magnetic moments (blue arrows) 
of the two possible spin states of the 
methine proton affect the chemical 
shift of the methyl protons in 
1,1-dichloroethane. When the magnetic 
moment is parallel to the external field 
B0 (green arrow), it adds to the external 
field and a smaller B0 is needed for 
resonance. When it is antiparallel to the 
external field, it subtracts from it and 
shields the methyl protons.14.7 Spin–Spin Splitting and 1
H NMR 551
lower field strength (higher frequency). Conversely, when the magnetic moment of the 
methine proton is antiparallel to the applied field, it opposes it and increases the shield￾ing of the methyl protons. Instead of a single peak for the methyl protons, there are two 
of approximately equal intensity: one at slightly higher field than the “true” chemical 
shift, the other at slightly lower field.
Turning now to the methine proton, its signal is split by the methyl protons into a 
quartet. The same kind of analysis applies here and is outlined in Figure 14.15. The 
methine proton “sees” eight different combinations of nuclear spins for the methyl pro￾tons. In one combination, the magnetic moments of all three methyl protons reinforce 
the applied field. At the other extreme, the magnetic moments of all three methyl protons 
oppose the applied field. There are three combinations in which the magnetic moments 
of two methyl protons reinforce the applied field, whereas one opposes it. Finally, there 
are three combinations in which the magnetic moments of two methyl protons oppose 
the applied field and one reinforces it. These eight possible combinations give rise to 
four distinct peaks for the methine proton, with a ratio of intensities of 1:3:3:1.
We describe the observed splitting of NMR signals as spin–spin splitting and the 
physical basis for it as spin–spin coupling. It has its origin in the communication of 
nuclear spin information via the electrons in the bonds that intervene between the nuclei. 
Its effect is greatest when the number of bonds is small. Vicinal protons are separated 
by three bonds, and coupling between vicinal protons, as in 1,1-dichloroethane, is called 
three-bond coupling, or vicinal coupling. Four-bond couplings are weaker and not 
normally observable.
A very important characteristic of spin–spin splitting is that protons that have the 
same chemical shift do not split each other’s signal. Ethane, for example, shows only a 
single sharp peak in its NMR spectrum. Even though there is a vicinal relationship 
between the protons of one methyl group and those of the other, they do not split each 
other’s signal because they are equivalent.
Problem 14.11
Describe the appearance of the 1
H NMR spectrum of each of the following compounds. How 
many signals would you expect to find, and into how many peaks will each signal be split?
(a) 1,2-Dichloroethane (d) 1,2,2-Trichloropropane
(b) 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (e) 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloropropane
(c) 1,1,2-Trichloroethane
Sample Solution (a) All the protons of 1,2-dichloroethane (ClCH2CH2Cl) are chemically 
equivalent and have the same chemical shift. Protons that have the same chemical shift do 
not split each other’s signal, and so the NMR spectrum of 1,2-dichloroethane consists of a 
single sharp peak.
There are eight possible combinations
of the nuclear spins of the three methyl
protons in CH3CHCl2.
These eight combinations cause the
signal of the CHCl2 proton to be
split into a quartet, in which the
intensities of the peaks are in the
ratio 1:3:3:1.

The methyl protons of 
1,1-dichloroethane split the signal of the

Coupling of nuclear spins requires that the nuclei split each other’s signal equally. 
The separation between the two halves of the methyl doublet in 1,1-dichloroethane is 
equal to the separation between any two adjacent peaks of the methine quartet. The extent 
to which two nuclei are coupled is given by the coupling constant J and in simple cases 
is equal to the separation between adjacent lines of the signal of a particular proton. The 
three-bond coupling constant 3
Jab in 1,1-dichloroethane has a value of 7 Hz. The size of 
the coupling constant is independent of the field strength; the separation between adjacent 
peaks in 1,1-dichloroethane is 7 Hz, irrespective of whether the spectrum is recorded at 
300 MHz or 500 MHz.
14.8 Splitting Patterns: The Ethyl Group
One of the most characteristic patterns of peaks is that of the ethyl group, represented 
in the NMR spectrum of ethyl bromide in Figure 14.16. In compounds of the type 
CH3CH2X, especially where X is an electronegative atom or group, such as bromine in 
ethyl bromide, the ethyl group appears as a triplet–quartet pattern. The signal for the 
methylene protons is split into a quartet by coupling with the three methyl protons. The 
signal for the methyl protons is a triplet because of vicinal coupling to the two protons 
of the adjacent methylene group.
Br CH2 CH3
These three protons split
the methylene signal into
a quartet.
These two protons split
the methyl signal into
a triplet.
We have discussed in the preceding section why methyl groups split the signals 
due to vicinal protons into a quartet. Splitting by a methylene group gives a triplet cor￾responding to the spin combinations shown in Figure 14.17 for ethyl bromide. The rela￾tive intensities of the peaks of this triplet are 1:2:1.
Table 14.1 summarizes the splitting patterns and peak intensities expected for cou￾pling to various numbers of protons.

The NMR spectrum of isopropyl chloride (Figure 14.18) illustrates the appearance of an 
isopropyl group. The signal for the six equivalent methyl protons at δ 1.5 is split into a 
doublet by the proton of the HCCl unit. In turn, the HCCl proton signal at δ 4.2 
The intensities correspond to the 
coefficients of a binomial expansion 
(Pascal’s triangle).

14.10 Splitting Patterns: Pairs of Doublets
We often see splitting patterns in which the intensities of the individual peaks do not 
match those given in Table 14.1, but are distorted in that the signals for coupled protons 
“lean” toward each other. This leaning is a general phenomenon, but is most easily illus￾trated for the case of two nonequivalent vicinal protons as shown in Figure 14.19.

The appearance of the splitting pattern of protons 1 and 2 depends on their coupling 
constant J and the chemical-shift difference Δν between them. When the ratio Δν/J is 
large, two symmetrical 1:1 doublets are observed. We refer to this as the “AX” case, using 
two letters that are remote in the alphabet to stand for signals well removed from each 
other on the spectrum. Keeping the coupling constant the same while reducing Δν leads 
to a steady decrease in the intensity of the outer two peaks with a simultaneous increase 
in the inner two as we progress from AX through AM to AB. At the extreme (A2), the 
two protons have the same chemical shift, the outermost lines have disappeared, and no 
splitting is observed. Because of its appearance, it is easy to misinterpret an AB or AM 
pattern as a quartet, rather than the pair of skewed doublets it really is.
Figure 14.19
The appearance of the splitting pattern of two coupled protons depends on their coupling constant J and 
the chemical-shift difference Δν between them. As the ratio Δν/J decreases, the doublets become 
increasingly distorted. When the two protons have the same chemical shift, no splitting is observed.

A skewed pair of doublets is clearly visible in the 1
H NMR spectrum of 
2,3,4-trichloroanisole (Figure 14.20). In addition to the singlet at δ 3.9 for the protons 
of the OCH3 group, we see doublets at δ 6.8 and δ 7.3 for the two protons of the 
aromatic ring.

A pair of doublets frequently occurs with geminal protons (protons bonded to the 
same carbon). Geminal protons are separated by two bonds, and geminal coupling is 
referred to as two-bond coupling (2
J) in the same way that vicinal coupling is referred 
to as three-bond coupling (3
J). An example of geminal coupling is provided by the 
compound 1-chloro-1-cyanoethene, in which the two hydrogens appear as a pair of 
doublets. The splitting in each doublet is 2 Hz.

Splitting due to geminal coupling is seen only in CH2 groups and only when the 
two protons have different chemical shifts. All three protons of a methyl (CH3) group 
are equivalent and cannot split one another’s signal.
14.11 Complex Splitting Patterns
All the cases we’ve discussed so far have involved splitting of a proton signal by coupling 
to other protons that were equivalent to one another. Indeed, we have stated the splitting 
rule in terms of the multiplicity of a signal as being equal to n + 1, where n is equal to 
the number of equivalent protons to which the proton that gives the signal is coupled. 
What if all the vicinal protons are not equivalent?
The protons in 1-chloro-1-cyanoethene 
are diastereotopic (Section 14.6). They 
are nonequivalent and have different 
chemical shifts. Remember, splitting 
can occur only between protons that 
have different chemical shifts.

Figure 14.21a shows the signal for the proton marked ArCHaCH2 in m-nitrostyrene, 
which appears as a set of four peaks in the range δ 6.7–6.9. These four peaks are in fact 
a “doublet of doublets.” The proton in question is unequally coupled to the two protons 
at the end of the vinyl side chain. The size of the vicinal coupling constant between 
protons trans to each other on a double bond is normally larger than that between cis 
protons. In this case the trans coupling constant is 16 Hz and the cis coupling constant 
is 12 Hz. Thus, as shown in Figure 14.21b, the signal for Ha is split into a doublet with 
a spacing of 16 Hz by one vicinal proton, and each line of this doublet is then split into 
another doublet with a spacing of 12 Hz.
The “n + 1 rule” should be amended to read: When a proton Ha is coupled to Hb, 
Hc, Hd, etc., and Jab ≠ Jac, ≠ Jad, etc., the original signal for Ha is split into n + 1 peaks 
by n Hb protons, each of these lines is further split into n + 1 peaks by n Hc protons, 
and each of these into n + 1 lines by n Hd protons, and so on. Bear in mind that because 
of overlapping peaks, the number of lines actually observed can be less than that expected 
on the basis of the splitting rule.
Diastereotopic hydrogens can complicate the NMR spectra of chiral molecules, espe￾cially those in which there is a CH2 group adjacent to a chirality center. Consider Ha and 
Hb in (S)-1,2-diphenyl-2-propanol, which has a chirality center at C-2 (Figure 14.22). 
You will find it revealing to construct a 
splitting diagram similar to that of 
Figure 14.21 for the case in which the 
cis and trans HCCH coupling 
constants are equal. Under those 
circumstances the four-line pattern 
simplifies to a triplet, as it should for a 
proton equally coupled to two vicinal 
protons.

Replacement of Ha with a test group, for example, deuterium, gives a compound that is 
diastereomeric to the one that is generated by replacement of Hb. Recall that when dia￾stereomers are produced by replacement of protons with test groups, the protons are diastereo￾topic and may have different chemical shifts (Section 14.6). In 1,2-diphenyl-2-propanol, Ha
and Hb are diastereotopic, have different chemical shifts, and appear as a pair of doublets. 
They give an AM splitting pattern (Figure 14.19) because the chemical-shift differences 
between Ha and Hb are not much larger than the coupling constant.

H NMR Spectra of Alcohols
We expect the hydroxyl proton of a primary alcohol RCH2OH to be split into a triplet 
by vicinal coupling to the two protons of the CH2 group. This is, in fact, exactly what 
we observe in the 300-MHz spectrum of benzyl alcohol shown in Figure 14.24. In recip￾rocal fashion, the OH proton splits the signal for the protons of the CH2 group into a 
doublet. Often, however, splitting due to HCOH coupling is not observed because 
of rapid exchange of OH protons between alcohol molecules, the rate of which increases 
with concentration and temperature and is subject to catalysis by acids and bases. Because 
higher field strength instruments allow more dilute solutions to be used, HCOH 
splitting is more commonly seen in 300-MHz spectra than in earlier spectra run at 
200 MHz and below.
Problem 14.15
Hydrogen bonding between the oxygen of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the proton of an 
OH group is relatively strong. How could recording an NMR spectrum in DMSO instead of 
CDCl3 be helpful in distinguishing between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols?
The chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton is variable, with a range of δ 0.5–5, 
depending on the solvent, the temperature at which the spectrum is recorded, and the 
concentration of the solution. The alcohol proton shifts to lower field in more concen￾trated solutions.
An easy way to verify that a particular signal belongs to a hydroxyl proton is to 
add D2O. The hydroxyl proton is replaced by deuterium according to the equation:
RCH2OH + + D2O RCH2OD DOH
Deuterium does not give a signal under the conditions of 1
H NMR spectroscopy. Thus, 
replacement of a hydroxyl proton by deuterium leads to the disappearance of the OH 
peak of the alcohol. Protons bonded to nitrogen and sulfur also undergo exchange with 
D2O. Those bound to carbon normally do not, which makes this a useful technique for 
assigning the proton resonances of OH, NH, and SH groups.

single sharp peak at δ 1.4. All the protons of cyclohexane appear to be equivalent in the

The answer is related to the very rapid rate of chair–chair interconversion in cyclohexane.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
I
t isn’t often that someone goes to the emergency room 
because of a headache, and when the staff discovered that 
the man who did was due in court for sentencing the next day, 
some of them felt that there might not be anything wrong at all. 
There was.
The man’s behavior toward the staff soon convinced them 
that he should be admitted, kept overnight, and seen by a neu￾rologist the next day. After a preliminary examination, a mag￾netic resonance image, or MRI, was ordered which revealed a 
brain tumor. The tumor was located in the right frontal cortex, a 
portion of the brain known to be involved in controlling impul￾sive behavior.
The man had behaved normally until middle age; then his 
personality underwent significant changes, involving certain 
impulsive behaviors and criminal tendencies. These, as well as 
other behaviors, had not responded to drugs or counseling. 
Even though he had earned a master’s degree, the man per￾formed poorly on some simple mental tests and was unable to 
sketch the face of a clock or write a legible, coherent sentence.
Once the tumor was found, it was surgically removed. The 
man’s ability to curb his impulses was restored, his mental, 
graphical, and writing skills improved to the normal range, and 
he successfully completed a rehabilitation program. About a 
year later though, the headaches and some of the earlier behav￾iors returned. When a new MRI showed that the tumor had 
regrown, it was removed and again the symptoms disappeared.
At a turning point in this man’s life, an MRI made all the 
difference. MRI is NMR. The word nuclear is absent from the 
name to avoid confusion with nuclear medicine, which involves 
radioactive isotopes. MRI is noninvasive, requires no imaging or 
contrast agents, and is less damaging than X-rays. In the time 
since the first MRI of a living creature—a clam—was successfully 
obtained in the early 1970s, MRI has become a standard diag￾nostic tool. Two of its early developers, Paul Lauterbur (Univer￾sity of Illinois) and Peter Mansfield (University of Nottingham) 
were recognized with the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology 
or Medicine.
An MRI scanner is an NMR machine large enough to 
accommodate a human being, has a powerful magnet, operates 
in the pulse-FT mode, and detects protons—usually the protons 
in water and, to a lesser extent, lipids. The principles are the 
same as those of conventional FT-NMR spectroscopy but, 
because the goal is different, the way the data are collected and 
analyzed differs too. Some key features of MRI include:
1. A selective pulse is used in order to excite protons in a 
particular slice of the object to be imaged.
2. Unlike conventional NMR, the magnetic field in MRI is not 
uniform. A linear gradient is applied in addition to the 
static field so that the field strength varies as a function of 
position in the object but is precisely known. Because the 
frequency of a proton signal is directly proportional to the 
strength of the applied magnetic field, the measured reso￾nance frequency is linearly related to the position in the 
magnetic field gradient.
3. Computer software carries out the essential task of recon￾structing the 2D or 3D image from the NMR signals. The 
data are generally presented as a series of slices through 
the imaged object.
4. The intensity of the signal—its relative lightness or dark￾ness in the image—depends on the concentration and 
spin relaxation times of the various protons. Spin relax￾ation time is the time it takes for the perturbed magneti￾zation associated with a proton to return to its equilibrium 
value. The relaxation time is quite sensitive to the envi￾ronment and is different for water in blood and various 
tissues.
New applications of nuclear magnetic resonance in bio￾medical science continue to appear. Functional MRI (fMRI) is an 
offshoot of MRI. Unlike MRI, which is used for diagnosis in a 
clinical setting, fMRI is a research tool that detects regions of the 
brain that are actively responding to stimuli. Increased brain 
activity is accompanied by an increase in blood flow to the 
region involved. This alters the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin 
to its nonoxygenated counterpart. Because the two hemoglo￾bins have different magnetic properties, the nuclear spin relax￾ation times of the protons in water are affected and can be

NMR is too slow to “see” the individual conformations of cyclohexane, but sees instead 
the average environment of the protons. Because chair–chair interconversion in cyclo￾hexane converts each axial proton to an equatorial one and vice versa, the average envi￾ronments of all the protons are the same. A single peak is observed that has a chemical 
shift midway between the true chemical shifts of the axial and the equatorial protons.
The rate of interconversion can be slowed down by lowering the temperature. At 
temperatures of about −100°C, separate signals are seen for the axial and equatorial 
protons of cyclohexane.
14.14 13C NMR Spectroscopy
We pointed out in Section 14.3 that both 1
H and 13C are nuclei that can provide useful 
structural information when studied by NMR. Although a 1
H NMR spectrum helps us 
infer much about the carbon skeleton of a molecule, a 13C NMR spectrum has the obvious 
advantage of probing the carbon skeleton directly. 13C NMR spectroscopy is analogous to 
1
H NMR in that the number of signals informs us about the number of different kinds of 
carbons, and their chemical shifts are related to particular chemical environments.
However, unlike 1
H, which is the most abundant of the hydrogen isotopes (99.985%), 
only 1.1% of the carbon atoms in a sample are 13C. Moreover, the intensity of the signal 
produced by 13C nuclei is far weaker than the signal produced by the same number of 
1
H nuclei. In order for 13C NMR to be a useful technique in structure determination, a 
vast increase in the signal-to-noise ratio is required. Pulsed FT-NMR provides for this, 
and its development was the critical breakthrough that led to 13C NMR becoming the 
routine tool that it is today.
To orient ourselves in the information that 13C NMR provides, let’s compare the 1
H and 
13C NMR spectra of 1-chloropentane (Figures 14.25a and 14.25b, respectively). The 1
H NMR 
spectrum shows reasonably well-defined triplets for the protons of the CH3 and CH2Cl groups 
(δ 0.9 and 3.55, respectively). The signals for the six CH2 protons at C-2, C-3, and C-4 of 
CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2Cl, however, appear as two unresolved multiplets at δ 1.4 and 1.8.
The 13C NMR spectrum, on the other hand, is very simple: a separate, distinct 
peak is observed for each carbon.
Notice, too, how well-separated these 13C signals are: they cover a range of over 
30 ppm, compared with less than 3 ppm for the proton signals of the same compound. 
In general, the window for proton signals in organic molecules is about 12 ppm; 13C 
chemical shifts span a range of over 200 ppm. The greater spread of 13C chemical shifts 
makes it easier to interpret the spectra.
Problem 14.16
How many signals would you expect to see in the 13C NMR spectrum of each of the following 
compounds?
(a) Propylbenzene
(b) Isopropylbenzene
(c) 1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene
(d) 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene
(e) 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene
Sample Solution (a) The two ring carbons that are ortho to the propyl substituent are 
equivalent and so must have the same chemical shift. Similarly, the two ring carbons that are 
meta to the propyl group are equivalent to each other. The carbon atom para to the 
substituent is unique, as is the carbon that bears the substituent. Thus, there will be four 
signals for the ring carbons, designated w, x, y, and z in the structural formula. These four 
signals for the ring carbons added to those for the three nonequivalent carbons of the 
propyl group yield a total of seven signals.

14.15 13C Chemical Shifts
Just as chemical shifts in 1
H NMR are measured relative to the protons of tetramethyl￾silane, chemical shifts in 13C NMR are measured relative to the carbons of tetramethyl￾silane. Table 14.2 lists typical chemical-shift ranges for some representative types of 
carbon atoms.
In general, the factors that most affect 13C chemical shifts are
1. The electronegativity of the groups attached to carbon
2. The hybridization of carbon
Substituent Effects Electronegative substituents affect 13C chemical shifts in the same 
way as they affect 1
H chemical shifts, by withdrawing electrons. For 1
H NMR, recall that 
because carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, the protons in methane (CH4) are 
more shielded than primary hydrogens (RCH3), primary hydrogens are more shielded 
than secondary (R2CH2), and secondary more shielded than tertiary (R3CH). The same 
holds true for carbons in 13C NMR, but the effects can be 10–20 times greater.

The most obvious feature of these 13C chemical shifts is that the closer the carbon is to 
the electronegative chlorine, the more deshielded it is. Peak assignments will not always 
be this easy, but the correspondence with electronegativity is so pronounced that spectrum 
simulators are available that allow reliable prediction of 13C chemical shifts from structural 
formulas. These simulators are based on arithmetic formulas that combine experimentally 
derived chemical-shift increments for the various structural units within a molecule.
Problem 14.17
The 13C NMR spectrum of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane contains peaks at δ 30, δ 35, and δ 43. 
Assign these signals to the appropriate carbons.
The effects of substituents on rate and orientation in electrophilic aromatic substi￾tution described in Chapter 13 find parallels in their effect on the chemical shifts of 
aromatic ring carbons. For the group of compounds represented as
G
the 13C chemical shift of the para carbon is observed to correlate with the ortho, para- versus 
meta-directing effects of substituent G. Since shielding in NMR results from the local magnetic

fields that accompany local electric fields, it follows that nuclear shielding—especially at 
carbons ortho or para to a substituent—increases as the substituent becomes more electron￾releasing or less electron-withdrawing. The effect on chemical shift is quite pronounced and 
covers a range of over 16 ppm in the following group of para-substituted benzene derivatives.

Relative to H, deactivating meta-directing substituents at C-1 deshield the carbon 
at C-4; activating ortho, para-directing substituents shield it. The halogen substituent in 
the group (bromine) behaves in much the same way as it does in electrophilic aromatic 
substitution, where, although weakly deactivating, it is an ortho, para director. In the case 
of 13C chemical shifts, bromine increases the shielding (electron density) at the para position.
Hybridization Effects Here again, the effects are similar to those seen in 1
H NMR.

families of compounds are discussed in more detail.
14.16 13C NMR and Peak Intensities
Two features that are fundamental to 1
H NMR spectroscopy—integrated areas and split￾ting patterns—are much less important in 13C NMR.
Although it is a simple matter to integrate 13C signals, it is rarely done because the 
observed ratios can be more misleading than helpful. The pulsed FT technique that is 
standard for 13C NMR has the side effect of distorting the signal intensities, especially 
for carbons that lack attached hydrogens. Examine Figure 14.26, which shows the 
13C NMR spectrum of 3-methylphenol (m-cresol). Notice that, contrary to what we might 
expect for a compound with seven peaks for seven different carbons, the intensities of 
these peaks are not nearly the same. The two least intense signals, those at δ 140 and 
δ 157, correspond to carbons that lack attached hydrogens.

1
H Coupling
You have probably noticed another characteristic of 13C NMR spectra—all of the peaks 
are singlets. With a spin of ±
_12, a 13C nucleus is subject to the same splitting rules that 
apply to 
1
H, and we might expect to see splittings due to 13
C
13C and 13
C

1
H couplings. 
We don’t. Why?
The lack of splitting due to 13
C
13C coupling is easy to understand. 13C NMR 
spectra are measured on samples that contain 13C at the “natural abundance” level. Only 
1% of all the carbons in the sample are 13C, and the probability that any molecule con
-
tains more than one 13C atom is quite small.
Splitting due to 13
C

1
H coupling is absent for a different reason, one that has to 
do with the way the spectrum is run. Because a 13C signal can be split not only by the 
protons to which it is directly attached, but also by protons separated from it by two, 
three, or even more bonds, the number of splittings might be so large as to make the 
spectrum too complicated to interpret. Thus, the spectrum is measured under conditions, 
called broadband decoupling, that suppress such splitting.
What we gain from broadband decoupling in terms of a simple-looking spectrum 
comes at the expense of some useful information. For example, being able to see splitting 
corresponding to one-bond 13
C

1
H coupling would immediately tell us the number of 
hydrogens directly attached to each carbon. The signal for a carbon with no attached 
hydrogens (a quaternary carbon) would be a singlet, the hydrogen of a CH group would 
split the carbon signal into a doublet, and the signals for the carbons of a CH
2 and a CH
3
group would appear as a triplet and a quartet, respectively. Although it is possible, with 
a technique called off-resonance decoupling, to observe such one-bond couplings, identi
-
fying a signal as belonging to a quaternary carbon or to the carbon of a CH, CH
2, or CH
3
group is normally done by a method called DEPT, which is described in the next section.
14.18 Using DEPT to Count Hydrogens
In general, a simple pulse FT-NMR experiment involves the following stages:
1. Equilibration of the nuclei between the lower and higher spin states under the 
influence of a magnetic field
2. Application of a radiofrequency pulse to give an excess of nuclei in the higher spin state
3. Acquisition of free-induction decay data during the time interval in which the 
equilibrium distribution of nuclear spins is restored
4. Mathematical manipulation (Fourier transform) of the data to plot a spectrum
The pulse sequence (stages 2–3) can be repeated hundreds of times to enhance the signal￾to-noise ratio. The duration of time for stage 2 is on the order of milliseconds, and that 
for stage 3 is about 1 second.
Major advances in NMR have been made by using a second rf transmitter to irradiate 
the sample at some point during the sequence. There are several such techniques, of which 
we’ll describe just one, called distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer,
abbreviated as DEPT.
In the DEPT routine, a second transmitter excites 
1
H, which affects the appearance 
of the 13C spectrum. A typical DEPT experiment is illustrated for the case of 1-phenyl￾1-pentanone in Figure 14.28. In addition to the normal spectrum shown in Figure 14.28a,
four more spectra are run using prescribed pulse sequences. In one (Figure 14.28
b), the 
signals for carbons of CH
3 and CH groups appear normally, whereas those for CH
2 groups 
are inverted and those for C without any attached hydrogens are nulled. In the others (not 
shown) different pulse sequences produce combinations of normal, nulled, and inverted 
peaks that allow assignments to be made to the various types of carbons with confidence.

14.19 2D NMR: COSY and HETCOR
The more information you can extract from an NMR spectrum, the better your chances 
at arriving at a unique structure. Like spin–spin splitting, which complicates the appear￾ance of a 1
H NMR spectrum but provides additional information, 2D NMR looks more 
complicated than it is while making structure determination easier.
The key dimension in NMR is the frequency axis. All of the spectra we have seen 
so far are 1D spectra because they have only one frequency axis. In 2D NMR a standard 
pulse sequence adds a second frequency axis.
One kind of 2D NMR is called COSY, which stands for correlated spectroscopy.
With a COSY spectrum you can determine by inspection which signals correspond to 
spin-coupled protons. Identifying coupling relationships is a valuable aid to establishing 
a molecule’s connectivity.
Figure 14.30 is the COSY spectrum of 2-hexanone. Both the x- and y-axes are 
frequency axes expressed as chemical shifts. Displaying the 1D 1
H NMR spectrum of 
2-hexanone along the x- and y-axes makes it easier to interpret the 2D information, 
which is the collection of contoured objects contained within the axes. To orient 
ourselves, first note that many of the contours lie along the diagonal that runs from 
the lower left to the upper right. This diagonal bisects the 2D NMR into two mirror￾image halves. The off-diagonal contours are called cross peaks and contain the 
connectivity information we need.
Each cross peak has x and y coordinates. One coordinate corresponds to the 
chemical shift of a proton, the other to the chemical shift of a proton to which it is 
coupled. Because the diagonal splits the 2D spectrum in half, each cross peak is 
duplicated on the other side of the other diagonal with the same coordinates, except 
in reverse order. This redundancy means that we really need to examine only half of 
the cross peaks.

To illustrate, start with the lowest field signal (δ 2.4) of 2-hexanone. We assign 
this signal, a triplet, to the protons at C-3 on the basis of its chemical shift and the 
splitting evident in the 1D spectrum.
δ 2.4
CH3CCH2CH2CH2CH3
O
We look for cross peaks with the same x coordinate by drawing a vertical line from 
δ  2.4, finding a cross peak with a y coordinate of δ 1.6. This means that the protons 
responsible for the signal at δ 2.4 are coupled to the ones at δ 1.6. Therefore, the 
chemical shift of the C-4 protons is δ 1.6.
Now work from these C-4 protons. Drawing a vertical line from δ 1.6 on the 
x-axis finds two cross peaks. One cross peak simply confirms the coupling to the 
protons at C-3. The other has a y coordinate of δ 1.3 and, therefore, must correspond 
to the protons at C-5.
A vertical line drawn from δ 1.3 intersects the cross peaks at both δ 1.6 and δ 0.9. 
The former confirms the coupling of C-5 to C-4; the latter corresponds to the C-5 to 
C-6 coupling and identifies the signal at δ 0.9 as belonging to the protons at C-6.
Finally, a vertical line drawn from δ 2.1 intersects no cross peaks. The singlet at 
δ 2.1, as expected, is due to the protons at C-1, which are not coupled to any of the 
other protons in the molecule.

Although the 1D 1
H spectrum of 2-hexanone is simple enough to be interpreted directly, 
you can see that COSY offers one more tool we can call on in more complicated cases.
A second 2D NMR method called HETCOR (heteronuclear chemical shift 
correlation) is a type of COSY in which the two frequency axes are the chemical shifts 
for different nuclei, usually 1
H and 13C. With HETCOR it is possible to relate a peak in 
a 13C spectrum to the 1
H signal of the protons attached to that carbon. As we did with 
COSY, we’ll use 2-hexanone to illustrate the technique.
The HETCOR spectrum of 2-hexanone is shown in Figure 14.31. It is considerably 
simpler than a COSY spectrum, lacking diagonal peaks and contoured cross peaks. 
Instead, we see objects that are approximately as tall as a 1
H signal is wide, and as wide 
as a 13C signal. As with the COSY cross peaks, however, it is their coordinates that 
matter, not their size or shape. Interpreting the spectrum is straightforward. The 13C peak 
at δ 30 correlates with the 1
H singlet at δ 2.1, which because of its multiplicity and 
chemical shift corresponds to the protons at C-1. Therefore, this 13C peak can be assigned 
to C-1 of 2-hexanone. Repeating this procedure for the other carbons gives:

products and the conformations of biomolecules.14.20 Introduction to Infrared Spectroscopy 569
14.20 Introduction to Infrared Spectroscopy
Before the advent of NMR spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy was the instru￾mental method most often applied to organic structure determination. Although NMR, 
in general, tells us more about the structure of an unknown compound, IR remains an 
important tool because of its usefulness in identifying the presence of certain func￾tional groups within a molecule. Structural units, including functional groups, vibrate 
in characteristic ways and it is this sensitivity to group vibrations that is the basis of 
IR spectroscopy.
Among the ways a molecule responds to the absorption of energy is by vibrational 
motions such as the stretching and contracting of bonds and the opening and closing 
(bending) of bond angles. Vibrational motion and its energy are quantized. Only certain 
vibrational energy states are allowed.
We can visualize molecular vibrations by thinking of atoms and bonds as balls and 
springs.
Even at the absolute zero of temperature, atoms in a molecule vibrate with respect to 
the bonds that connect them. At room temperature, the molecules are distributed among 
various vibrational energy states. Frequency is a property of the vibration and is related 
to the difference between vibrational energy states by ΔE = hν (Section 14.1). Promot￾ing a molecule from a lower to a higher vibrational energy state increases the amplitude
of the vibration.
For a sense of the variety of vibrational modes available to a molecule, consider 
a CH2 group. Stretching and contracting the pair of CH bonds can occur in two

The best way to get good at interpreting spectra is by experi￾ence. Look at as many spectra and do as many spectros￾copy problems as you can.
Among Web sites that offer spectroscopic problems, two 
stand out (Figure 14.32). One, called WebSpectra, was devel￾oped by Professor Craig A. Merlic (UCLA):
www.chem.ucla.edu/~webspectra/#Problems
The other is the Organic Structure Elucidation workbook, cre￾ated by Professor Bradley D. Smith (Notre Dame):
https://www3.nd.edu/~smithgrp/structure/workbook.html
WebSpectra includes 75 problems. All the problems display 
the 1
H and 13C spectra, several with DEPT or COSY enhance￾ments. A number include IR spectra. Organic Structure Eluci￾dation contains 64 problems, all with 1

them a try.

These two welcome screens open the door to almost 150 spectroscopy problems. The screens are used with permission of Professors Craig A. 
Merlic (WebSpectra) and Bradley D. Smith (Organic Structure Elucidation).
The SDBS contains 15,900 1
H NMR, 14,200 13C NMR, 54,100 IR, and 
25,000 mass spectra. Not only does the SDBS contain more spec￾tra than anyone could possibly browse through, it incorporates 
some very useful search features. If you want spectra for a particu￾lar compound, entering the name of the compound calls up links 
to its spectra, which can then be displayed. If you don’t know what 
the compound is, but know one or more of the following:
• Molecular formula
• 1
H or 13C chemical shift of one or more peaks
• Mass number of mass spectra fragments
entering the values singly or in combination returns the names 
of the best matches in the database. You can then compare the 
spectra of these candidate compounds with the spectra of the 
sample to identify it.
As extensive as the SDBS is, don’t be disappointed if the 
exact compound you are looking for is not there. There are, after 
all, millions of organic compounds. However, much of structure 
determination (and organic chemistry in general) is based on 
analogy. Finding the spectrum of a related compound can be 
almost as helpful as finding the one you really want.
These Web resources, in conjunction with the figures and 
problems in your text, afford a wealth of opportunities to gain 
practice and experience in what are now the standard tech￾niques of structure determination.14.21 Infrared Spectra 571
In addition to stretching vibrations, a CH2 group can bend, and each bending mode 
has its own set of energy states.
Bending vibrations: Scissoring Rocking Wagging Twisting
A molecule absorbs that portion of electromagnetic radiation having a frequency 
that matches the energy difference between two vibrational energy levels. This radiation 
lies in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 14.1). The wavelength 
λ of the infrared region that is the most useful for structure determination is 2.5–16 μm, 
where 1 μm = 10−6 m. Instead of wavelengths or SI units of frequency (s−1), IR spec￾troscopy uses wavenumbers, which are equal to λ−1 and expressed in units of reciprocal 
centimeters (cm−1). Thus, the region 2.5–16 μm corresponds to 4000–625 cm−1. Wave￾numbers are directly proportional to energy; 4000 cm−1 is the high-energy end of the 
scale for IR spectra, and 625 cm−1 is the low-energy end.
Problem 14.22
Vibrational frequencies are sensitive to isotopic replacement. The OH stretching frequency 
is near 3600 cm−1
, but that of OD is about 2630 cm−1
. Which are closer in energy, two 
adjacent OH or two adjacent OD vibrational states?
Most molecules have many more vibrational modes than the ones just shown for a 
single CH2 group. Some involve relatively simple structural units, others a substantial 
fraction of the atoms in a molecule. Thus, the infrared spectrum of each compound is 
unique, and superimposability of their IR spectra is convincing evidence that two sub￾stances are the same.
14.21 Infrared Spectra
IR spectra can be obtained regardless of the physical state of a sample—solid, liquid, 
gas, or dissolved in some solvent. If the sample is a liquid, a drop or two is placed 
between two sodium chloride disks, through which the IR beam is passed. Solids may 
be dissolved in a suitable solvent such as carbon tetrachloride or chloroform. More com￾monly, a solid sample is mixed with potassium bromide and the mixture pressed into a 
thin wafer, which is placed in the path of the IR beam. Newer instruments require little 
or no sample preparation. The present generation of IR spectrometers employs a tech￾nique known as attenuated total reflectance (ATR) coupled with FT data analysis. The 
whole range of vibrational states is sampled at once and transformed by Fourier analysis.
Figure 14.33 orients us with respect to where we can expect to find IR absorptions 
for various structural units. Peaks in the range of 4000–1600 cm−1 are usually emphasized 
because this is the region in which the vibrations characteristic of particular functional 
groups are found. We’ll look at some of these functional groups in more detail in Section 
14.22. The region 1500–500 cm−1 is known as the fingerprint region; it is here that the 
pattern of peaks varies most from compound to compound.
An IR spectrum usually contains more peaks than we can assign, or even need to 
assign. We gain information by associating selected absorptions with particular structural 
units and functional groups, as well as noting what structural units can be excluded from 
consideration because a key peak that characterizes it is absent from the spectrum.
The energy difference between 
adjacent vibrational states is tens of 
thousands of times larger than what 
we saw for nuclear spin states in NMR.
All IR spectra in this text were 
recorded without solvent using an 
ATR instrument.572 Chapter 14 Spectroscopy
Figure 14.34a–d shows the IR spectra of four hydrocarbons: hexane, 1-hexene, 
benzene, and hexylbenzene. Each spectrum consists of a series of absorption peaks of 
varying shape and intensity. Unlike NMR, in which intensities are related to the number 
of nuclei responsible for each signal, some IR vibrations give more intense peaks than 
others. To give an observable peak in the infrared, a vibration must produce a change in 
the molecular dipole moment, and peaks are usually more intense when they involve a 
bond between two atoms of different electronegativity. Consequently, CC single-bond 
stretching vibrations normally give peaks of low intensity. The intensities of IR peaks 
are usually expressed in terms of percent transmittance (%T) and described as weak, 
medium, or strong.

IR spectra of the hydrocarbons: (a) hexane, (b) 1-hexene, (c) benzene, and (d) hexylbenzene.14.22 Characteristic Absorption Frequencies 573
The IR spectrum of hexane (Figure 14.34a) is relatively simple, characterized by 
several peaks near 3000 cm−1 due to CH stretching, along with weaker peaks at 1460, 
1380, and 725 cm−1 from CH and CC bending.
Among the several ways in which the spectrum of the alkene 1-hexene (Figure 14.34b) 
differs from hexane, the most useful from the perspective of structure determination is found 
in the CH stretching region. Although all the peaks for CH stretching in hexane appear 
below 3000 cm−1, 1-hexene exhibits a peak at 3079 cm−1. Peaks for CH stretching above 
3000 cm−1 are characteristic of hydrogens bonded to sp2
-hybridized carbon. The IR spectrum 
of 1-hexene also displays a weak peak at 1642 cm−1 corresponding to its CC stretching 
vibration. The peaks at 993 and 908 cm−1 in the spectrum of 1-hexene, absent in the spec￾trum of hexane, are bending vibrations of the H2CC group.
Problem 14.23
Ethylene lacks a peak in its IR spectrum for CC stretching. Why?
Benzene (Figure 14.34c) has only sp2
-hybridized carbons, and all of its peaks for 
CH stretching lie above 3000 cm−1. CC stretching gives a weak peak at 1478 cm−1. 
The most intense peak in benzene (667 cm−1) results from a vibration in which one of 
the CH bonds bends out of the plane of the ring.
The hexylbenzene spectrum (Figure 14.34d) bears similarities to those of hexane 
and benzene. Peaks for CH stretching are found both above and below 3000 cm−1 for 
sp2
 and sp3
 CH stretching, respectively. The benzene ring is represented in the weak 
peak at 1496 cm−1. The three peaks between 750 and 690 cm−1 include bending modes 
for the hexyl chain and the ring.
Rarely can the structure of a hydrocarbon ever be determined by IR alone. Figure 
14.34 alerts us to the fact that most organic compounds give IR spectra in which many 
of the peaks are due to the carbon skeleton and its attached hydrogens. Chemists pay 
less attention to these peaks now that 1
H and 13C NMR are available to gain the same 
information. What IR does best—identifying the presence or absence of functional 
groups—is described in the following section.
14.22 Characteristic Absorption Frequencies
Table 14.3 lists the characteristic absorption frequencies (in wavenumbers) for a variety 
of structural units found in organic compounds. Generally, absorptions above 1500 cm−1
for functional groups such as OH, CO, and CN are the easiest to assign and provide 
the most useful information.
Some of these characteristic absorptions are reflected in the IR spectra of eight 
functional-group classes in Figure 14.35: alcohol, nitrile, carboxylic acid, ketone, ester, ether, 
amine, and amide. None of the specific compounds represented contains hydrogens bonded 
to sp2
-hybridized carbon, so all of the CH absorbances lie below 3000 cm−1. The com￾pounds are related in that all have an unbranched six-carbon chain and, except for the peaks 
associated with the functional group, their spectra are similar, though not identical.

spectrum shown in Figure 14.36?

In later chapters, when families of compounds are discussed in detail, the IR frequen￾cies associated with each type of functional group will be revisited.
All of the spectra in this and the next 
section are displayed on a common 
% T scale to better show how peak 
intensities differ among various 
groups.574 Chapter 14 Spectroscopy
(a) Alcohols: A broad peak at 3200–3400 cm−l
is characteristic of hydrogen-bonded OH groups. 
In dilute solution, hydrogen bonding is less, and a 
sharp second peak for “free” OH groups appears 
near 3600 cm−l.
The peak at 1070 cm−1 lies in the range 
given in Table 14.3 (1025–1200 cm−1) for CO 
stretching and can be assigned to it.
(b) Nitriles: The CN triple bond absorption is 
easily identifiable in the IR spectrum of a nitrile as a 
sharp peak of medium intensity at 2240–2280 cm−1.
Very few other groups absorb in this region, 
the most notable being CC triple bonds 
(2100–2200 cm−1).
(c) Carboxylic acids: Carboxylic acids have two 
characteristic absorptions: a broad peak for OH 
stretching in the range 2500–3600 cm−1 and a strong 
peak for CO stretching at 1700–1725 cm−1.
(d) Aldehydes and ketones: As in other carbonyl￾containing compounds, the CO stretching 
vibration gives the strongest peak in the IR spectra 
of aldehydes and ketones.
The CO stretching frequencies of alde￾hydes are similar to those of ketones.
The CH stretch of the CHO group in 
aldehydes appears as a pair of bands in the range 
2700–2900 cm−1.

(e) Esters: In addition to a strong CO absorption 
(1730–1750 cm−1), esters exhibit peaks for 
symmetric and antisymmetric COC stretching 
at 1050–1300 cm−1.
(f ) Ethers: Peaks for COC stretching in 
ethers appear in the range 1070–1150 cm−1. Ethers 
of the type ROR′ where R and R′ are different 
have two peaks in this region.
(g) Amines: Primary amines (RNH2) have two 
peaks for the NH2 group in the 3300–3500 cm−1
region, one for symmetric and the other for 
antisymmetric NH stretching. Secondary amines 
(RNHR′) have only one peak (3310–3350 cm−1).
An NH bending peak at 650–900 cm−1 occurs 
in both RH2 and RNHR′. Primary amines also have 
an NH bending absorption at 1580–1650 cm−1.
CN stretching peaks are found at 
1020–1250 cm−1.
(h) Amides: Amides of the type RC(O)NH2 have 
peaks for both symmetric and antisymmetric NH 
stretching in the 3400–3150 cm−1 region.
The CO absorption for amides appears at 
slightly lower frequency (1650–1700 cm−1) than 
for ketones. Amides have a peak for NH2 bending 
at a slightly lower frequency (1600–1650 cm−1) 
than CO.

014.23 Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy 577
14.23 Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy
The main application of UV-VIS spectroscopy, which depends on transitions between 
electronic energy levels, is in identifying conjugated π electron systems.
Much greater energies separate electronic states than vibrational states. The energy 
required to promote an electron from one electronic state to the next lies in the visible 
and ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum (see Figure 14.1). We usually 
identify radiation in the UV-VIS range by its wavelength in nanometers. Thus, the vis￾ible region corresponds to 400–800 nm. Red light is the low-energy (long wavelength) 
end of the visible spectrum, violet light the high-energy (short wavelength) end. Ultra￾violet light lies beyond the visible spectrum with wavelengths in the 200–400-nm range.
Figure 14.37 shows the UV spectrum of the conjugated diene cis,trans-1,3-
cyclooctadiene, measured in ethanol as the solvent. As is typical of most UV spectra, 
the absorption is rather broad and is often spoken of as a “band” rather than a “peak.” 
The wavelength at an absorption maximum is referred to as the λmax of the band. For 
1,3-cyclooctadiene, λmax is 230 nm. In addition to λmax, UV-VIS bands are character￾ized by their absorbance (A), which is a measure of how much of the radiation that 
passes through the sample is absorbed. To correct for concentration and path length 
effects, absorbance is converted to molar absorptivity (ϵ) by dividing it by the con￾centration c in moles per liter and the path length l in centimeters.
ϵ = ____ A
c ⋅ l
Molar absorptivity, when measured at λmax, is cited as ϵmax. It is normally expressed 
without units. Both λmax and ϵmax are affected by the solvent, which is therefore included 
when reporting UV-VIS spectroscopic data. Thus, you might find a literature reference 
expressed in the form
cis,trans-1,3-Cyclooctadiene
ethanol λmax 230 nm 
2630 ethanol
ϵmax
Figure 14.38 illustrates the transition between electronic energy states responsible 
for the 230-nm UV band of cis,trans-1,3-cyclooctadiene. Absorption of UV radiation 
excites an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In alkenes and polyenes, both the HOMO and 
LUMO are π type orbitals (rather than σ); the HOMO is the highest-energy π orbital and 
the LUMO is the lowest-energy π* orbital. Exciting one of the π electrons from a bond￾ing π orbital to an antibonding π* orbital is referred to as a π → π* transition.

Problem 14.25
λmax for the π → π* transition in ethylene is 170 nm. Is the HOMO–LUMO energy difference in 
ethylene greater than or less than that of cis,trans-1,3-cyclooctadiene (230 nm)?
The HOMO–LUMO energy gap and, consequently, λmax for the π → π* transition 
varies with the substituents on the double bonds. The data in Table 14.4 illustrate two 
substituent effects: adding methyl substituents to the double bond, and extending conju￾gation. Both cause λmax to shift to longer wavelengths, but the effect of conjugation is 
the larger of the two. Based on data collected for many dienes it has been found that 
each methyl substituent on the double bonds causes a shift to longer wavelengths of about 
5 nm, whereas extending the conjugation causes a shift of about 36 nm for each addi￾tional double bond.
Problem 14.26
Which one of the C5H8 isomers shown has its λmax at the longest wavelength?
A striking example of the effect of conjugation on light absorption occurs in lycopene,
one of the pigments in ripe tomatoes. Lycopene has a conjugated system of 11 double 
bonds and absorbs visible light. It has several UV-VIS bands, each characterized by a 
separate λmax. Its longest wavelength absorption is at 505 nm. Note the inverse relation￾ship between the color of a compound and the wavelength of light absorbed. Lycopene 
absorbs light in the blue region of the visible spectrum, yet appears red. The red color 
of lycopene is produced by the light that is not absorbed.

Foodcollection14.24 Mass Spectrometry 579
Many organic compounds such as lycopene are colored because their HOMO–LUMO 
energy gap is small enough that λmax appears in the visible range of the spectrum. All 
that is required for a compound to be colored, however, is that it possess some absorption 
in the visible range. It often happens that a compound will have its λmax in the UV region 
but that the peak is broad and extends into the visible. Absorption of the blue-to-violet 
components of visible light occurs, and the compound appears yellow.
A second type of absorption that is important in UV-VIS examination of organic 
compounds is the n → π* transition of the carbonyl (CO) group. One of the electrons 
in a lone-pair orbital of oxygen is excited to an antibonding orbital of the carbonyl group. 
The n in n → π* identifies the electron as one of the nonbonded electrons of oxygen. 
This transition gives rise to relatively weak absorption peaks (ϵmax < 100) in the region 
270–300 nm. The structural unit associated with an electronic transition in UV-VIS 
spectroscopy is called a chromophore. UV-visible spectroscopy has applications in bio￾chemistry, where chromophores such as the heterocyclic bases found in nucleic acids and 
certain coenzymes involved in biochemical reactions can be studied.
14.24 Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry differs from the other instrumental methods discussed in this chapter in 
a fundamental way. It does not depend on the absorption of electromagnetic radiation but 
rather examines ions produced from a molecule in the gas phase. Several techniques have 
been developed for ionization in mass spectrometry. In one method, the molecule is bom￾barded with high-energy electrons. If an electron having an energy of about 10 electronvolts 
(10 eV = 230.5 kcal/mol) collides with an organic molecule, the energy transferred as a 
result of that collision is sufficient to dislodge one of the molecule’s electrons.

We say the molecule AB has been ionized by electron impact. The species that results, 
called the molecular ion, is positively charged and has an odd number of electrons—it 
is a cation radical. The molecular ion has the same mass (less the negligible mass of a 
single electron) as the molecule from which it is formed.
Although energies of about 10 eV are required, energies of about 70 eV are used. 
Electrons this energetic not only cause ionization of a molecule but also impart a large 
amount of energy to the molecular ion, enough energy to break chemical bonds. The molec￾ular ion dissipates this excess energy by dissociating into smaller fragments. Dissociation 
of a cation radical produces a neutral fragment and a positively charged fragment.

Ionization and fragmentation produce a mixture of particles, some neutral and some 
positively charged. To understand what follows, we need to examine the design of an 
electron-impact mass spectrometer, shown in Figure 14.39. The sample is bombarded 
with 70-eV electrons, and the resulting positively charged ions (the molecular ion as well 
as fragment ions) are directed into an analyzer tube surrounded by a magnet. This mag￾net deflects the ions from their original trajectory, causing them to adopt a circular path, 
the radius of which depends on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Ions of small m/z are 
deflected more than those of larger m/z. By varying either the magnetic field strength or 
the degree to which the ions are accelerated on entering the analyzer, ions of a particu￾lar m/z can be selectively focused through a narrow slit onto a detector, where they are 
counted. Scanning all m/z values gives the distribution of positive ions, called a mass 
spectrum, characteristic of a particular compound.
Most mass spectrometers are capable of displaying the mass spectrum according to a 
number of different formats. Bar graphs on which relative intensity is plotted versus m/z are 
the most common. Figure 14.40 shows the mass spectrum of benzene in bar graph form.
Don’t confuse the n in n → π* with the 
n of Hückel’s rule.
An important enzyme in biological 
electron transport called cytochrome 
P450 gets its name from its UV 
absorption. The “P” stands for 
“pigment” because it is colored, and 
the “450” corresponds to the 450-nm 
absorption of one of its derivatives.580 Chapter 14 Spectroscopy
The mass spectrum of benzene is relatively simple and illustrates some of the informa￾tion that mass spectrometry provides. The most intense peak in the mass spectrum is called 
the base peak and is assigned a relative intensity of 100. Ion abundances are proportional to 
peak intensities and are reported as intensities relative to the base peak. The base peak in 
the mass spectrum of benzene corresponds to the molecular ion (M+) at m/z = 78.

Benzene does not undergo extensive fragmentation; none of the fragment ions in its mass 
spectrum are as abundant as the molecular ion.
There is a small peak one mass unit higher than M+ in the mass spectrum of benzene. 
What is the origin of this peak? What we see in Figure 14.40 as a single mass spectrum is 
actually a superposition of the spectra of three isotopically distinct benzenes. Most of the

Not only the molecular ion peak but all the peaks in the mass spectrum of benzene are 
accompanied by a smaller peak one mass unit higher. Indeed, because all organic com￾pounds contain carbon and most contain hydrogen, similar isotopic clusters will appear 
in the mass spectra of all organic compounds.
Isotopic clusters are especially apparent when atoms such as bromine and chlorine 
are present in an organic compound. The natural ratios of isotopes in these elements are

Figure 14.41 presents the mass spectrum of chlorobenzene. There are two prominent 
molecular ion peaks, one at m/z 112 for C6H5
35Cl and the other at m/z 114 for C6H5
37Cl. 
The peak at m/z 112 is three times as intense as the one at m/z 114.
Problem 14.27
Knowing what to look for with respect to isotopic clusters can aid in interpreting mass 
spectra. How many peaks would you expect to see for the molecular ion in each of the 
following compounds? At what m/z values would these peaks appear? (Disregard the small 
peaks due to 13C and 2

(c) p-Dibromobenzene

Sample Solution (a) The two isotopes of chlorine are 35Cl and 37Cl. There will be three 
isotopically different forms of p-dichlorobenzene present. They have the structures shown as

Unlike the case of benzene, in which ionization involves loss of a π electron from the 
ring, electron-impact-induced ionization of chlorobenzene involves loss of an electron from an 
unshared pair of chlorine. The molecular ion then fragments by carbon–chlorine bond cleavage.

m/z 77
The peak at m/z 77 in the mass spectrum of chlorobenzene in Figure 14.41 is attributed to 
this fragmentation. Because there is no peak of significant intensity two atomic mass units 
higher, we know that the cation responsible for the peak at m/z 77 cannot contain chlorine.
Some classes of compounds are so prone to fragmentation that the molecular ion 
peak is very weak. The base peak in most unbranched alkanes, for example, is m/z 43, 
which is followed by peaks of decreasing intensity at m/z values of 57, 71, 85, and so on. 
These peaks correspond to cleavage of each possible carbon–carbon bond in the molecule. 
This pattern is evident in the mass spectrum of decane, depicted in Figure 14.42. The 
points of cleavage are indicated in the following diagram:

Many fragmentations in mass spectrometry proceed so as to form a stable carboca￾tion, and the principles that we have developed regarding carbocation stability apply. 
Alkylbenzenes of the type C6H5CH2R undergo cleavage of the bond to the benzylic carbon 
to give m/z 91 as the base peak. The mass spectrum in Figure 14.43 and the following 
fragmentation diagram illustrate this for propylbenzene.

Although this cleavage is probably driven by the stability of benzyl cation, evidence has

Understanding how molecules fragment upon electron impact permits a mass spec￾trum to be analyzed in sufficient detail to deduce the structure of an unknown compound. 
Thousands of compounds of known structure have been examined by mass spectrometry, 
and the fragmentation patterns that characterize different classes are well documented. 
As various groups are covered in subsequent chapters, aspects of their fragmentation 
behavior under conditions of electron impact will be described.
The structure of tropylium cation is 
given in Section 12.20.

14.25 Molecular Formula as a Clue to Structure
As we have just seen, interpreting the fragmentation patterns in a mass spectrum in terms 
of a molecule’s structural units makes mass spectrometry much more than just a tool for 
determining molecular weights. Nevertheless, even the molecular weight can provide 
more information than you might think.
A relatively simple example is the nitrogen rule. A molecule with an odd number 
of nitrogens has an odd molecular weight; a molecule with only C, H, and O or with an 
even number of nitrogens has an even molecular weight.

A second example concerns different compounds that have the same molecular 
weight, but different molecular formulas, such as heptane and cyclopropyl acetate.
O
O
Heptane (C7H16) Cyclopropyl acetate (C5H8O2)
Because we normally round off molecular weights to whole numbers, both have a molec￾ular weight of 100 and both have a peak for their molecular ion at m/z 100 in a typical 
mass spectrum. Recall, however, that mass spectra contain isotopic clusters that differ 
according to the isotopes present in each ion. Using the exact values for the major iso￾topes of C, H, and O, we calculate exact masses of m/z of 100.1253 and 100.0524 for 
the molecular ions of heptane (C7H16) and cyclopropyl acetate (C5H8O2), respectively. 
As similar as these values are, it is possible to distinguish between them using a high￾resolution mass spectrometer. This means that the exact mass of a molecular ion can 
usually be translated into a unique molecular formula.
Once we have the molecular formula, it can provide information that limits the 
amount of trial-and-error structure writing we have to do. Consider, for example, heptane 
and its molecular formula of C7H16. We know immediately that the molecular formula 
belongs to an alkane because it corresponds to CnH2n+2.
What about a substance with the molecular formula C7H14? This compound cannot 
be an alkane but may be either a cycloalkane or an alkene, because both these classes 
of hydrocarbons correspond to the general molecular formula CnH2n. Any time a ring or 
a double bond is present in an organic molecule, its molecular formula has two fewer 
hydrogen atoms than that of an alkane with the same number of carbons.
The relationship between molecular formulas, multiple bonds, and rings is referred 
to as the index of hydrogen deficiency and can be expressed by the equation:
Index of hydrogen deficiency = _1
2 (CnH2n+2 − CnHx)
where CnHx is the molecular formula of the compound.
A molecule that has a molecular formula of C7H14 has an index of hydrogen 
deficiency of 1:
Index of hydrogen deficiency = _1
2 (C7H16 − C7H14)
Index of hydrogen deficiency = _1
2 (2) = 1
Thus, the compound has one ring or one double bond. It can’t have a triple bond.
You can’t duplicate these molecular 
weights for C7H16 and C5H8O2 by using 
the atomic weights given in the 
periodic table. Those values are for 
the natural-abundance mixture of 
isotopes. The exact values are 
12.00000 for 12C, 1.00783 for 1
H, and 
15.9949 for 16O.
Other terms that mean the same thing 
as the index of hydrogen deficiency 
include elements of unsaturation, sites 
of unsaturation, and the sum of double 
bonds and rings.A molecule of molecular formula C7H12 has four fewer hydrogens than the corre￾sponding alkane. It has an index of hydrogen deficiency of 2 and can have two rings, 
two double bonds, one ring and one double bond, or one triple bond.
What about substances other than hydrocarbons, 1-heptanol [CH3(CH2)5CH2OH], 
for example? Its molecular formula (C7H16O) contains the same carbon-to-hydrogen ratio 
as heptane and, like heptane, it has no double bonds or rings. Cyclopropyl acetate 
(C5H8O2), the structure of which was given at the beginning of this section, has one ring 
and one double bond and an index of hydrogen deficiency of 2. Oxygen atoms have no 
effect on the index of hydrogen deficiency.
A halogen substituent, like hydrogen, is monovalent and when present in a molec￾ular formula is treated as if it were hydrogen for counting purposes. If a nitrogen is 
present, one hydrogen is taken away from the formula. For example, C5H11N is treated 
as C5H10 when calculating the index of hydrogen deficiency.
How does one distinguish between rings and double bonds? This additional piece 
of information comes from catalytic hydrogenation experiments in which the amount of 
hydrogen consumed is measured exactly. Each of a molecule’s double bonds consumes 
one molar equivalent of hydrogen, but rings are unaffected. For example, a substance 
with a hydrogen deficiency of 5 that takes up 3 mol of hydrogen must have two rings.
Problem 14.30
How many rings are present in each of the following compounds? Each consumes 2 mol of 
hydrogen on catalytic hydrogenation.
(a) C10H18
(b) C8H8
(c) C8H8CI2
(d) C8H8O
(e) C8H10O2
(f) C8H9ClO
(g) C3H5N
(h) C4H5N
Sample Solution (a) The molecular formula C10H18 contains four fewer hydrogens than the 
alkane having the same number of carbon atoms (C10H22). Therefore, the index of hydrogen 
deficiency of this compound is 2. Because it consumes two molar equivalents of hydrogen on 
catalytic hydrogenation, it must have either a triple bond or two double bonds and no rings.
Section 14.1 Structure determination in modern organic chemistry relies heavily on 
instrumental methods. Several of the most widely used ones depend on the 
absorption of electromagnetic radiation.
Section 14.2 Absorption of electromagnetic radiation causes a molecule to be excited from its 
most stable state (the ground state) to a higher-energy state (an excited state).

state to the higher state depends on the extent to which a nucleus is shielded 
from the external magnetic field by the molecule’s electrons.
14.26 SUMMARY
14.26 Summary 585586 Chapter 14 Spectroscopy
Section 14.5 Protons in different environments within a molecule have different chemical 
shifts; that is, they experience different degrees of shielding. Chemical shifts 
(δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane (TMS). 
Table 14.1 lists characteristic chemical shifts for various types of protons.
Section 14.6 In addition to chemical shift, a 1
H NMR spectrum provides structural 
information based on:
Number of signals, which tells how many different kinds of protons there are 
Integrated areas, which tells the ratios of the various kinds of protons
Splitting pattern, which gives information about the number of protons that are 
within two or three bonds of the one giving the signal
Section 14.7 Spin–spin splitting of NMR signals results from coupling of the nuclear spins 
that are separated by two bonds (geminal coupling) or three bonds (vicinal 
coupling).
Geminal hydrogens

In the simplest cases, the number of peaks into which a signal is split is equal to 
n + 1, where n is the number of protons to which the proton in question is coupled. 
Protons that have the same chemical shift do not split each other’s signal.
Section 14.8 The methyl protons of an ethyl group appear as a triplet and the methylene 
protons as a quartet in compounds of the type CH3CH2X.
Section 14.9 The methyl protons of an isopropyl group appear as a doublet and the methine 
proton as a septet in compounds of the type (CH3)2CHX.
Section 14.10 A pair of doublets characterizes the signals for the protons of the type shown 
(where W, X, Y, and Z are not H or atoms that split H themselves).
C
H H
W C Z
X Y
Section 14.11 Complicated splitting patterns can result when a proton is unequally coupled to 
two or more protons that are different from one another.
Section 14.12 Splitting resulting from coupling to the OH proton of alcohols is sometimes 
not observed, because the hydroxyl proton undergoes rapid intermolecular 
exchange with other alcohol molecules, which “decouples” it from other protons 
in the molecule.
Section 14.13 Many processes such as conformational changes take place faster than they can 
be detected by NMR. Consequently, NMR provides information about the 
average environment of a proton. For example, cyclohexane gives a single peak 
for its 12 protons even though, at any instant, 6 are axial and 6 are equatorial.
13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Section 14.14 13C has a nuclear spin of ±_1
2 but only about 1% of all the carbons in a sample 
are 13C. Nevertheless, high-quality 13C NMR spectra can be obtained by pulse 
FT techniques and are a useful complement to 1
H NMR spectra.
Section 14.15 13C signals are more widely separated from one another than proton signals, 
and 13C NMR spectra are relatively easy to interpret. Table 14.2 gives 
chemical-shift values for carbon in various environments.
Section 14.16 13C NMR spectra are rarely integrated because the pulse FT technique distorts 
the signal intensities.Section 14.17 Carbon signals normally appear as singlets, but several techniques are available 
that allow one to distinguish among the various kinds of carbons shown.

Section 14.18 One of the special techniques for distinguishing carbons according to the number 
of their attached hydrogens is called DEPT. A series of NMR measurements 
using different pulse sequences gives normal, nulled, and inverted peaks that 
allow assignment of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary carbons.
Section 14.19 2D NMR techniques are enhancements that are sometimes useful in gaining 
additional structural information. A 1
H-1
H COSY spectrum reveals which protons 
are spin-coupled to other protons, which helps in determining connectivity. A 
HETCOR spectrum shows the CH connections by correlating 13C and 1
H 
chemical shifts.
Infrared Spectroscopy
Section 14.20 IR spectroscopy probes molecular structure by examining transitions between 
quantized vibrational energy levels using electromagnetic radiation in the 
625–4000-cm−1 range, where cm−1 are units of wavenumbers, defined as λ−1. 
Wavenumbers are proportional to frequency. The simplest vibration is the 
stretching of the bond between two atoms, but more complex vibrations can 
involve movement of many of a molecule’s atoms.
Section 14.21 IR spectra are commonly regarded as consisting of a functional-group region 
(1500–4000 cm−1) and a fingerprint region (500–1500 cm−1). Included in the 
functional-group region are absorptions due to CH stretching. In general, 
CH stretching frequencies lie below 3000 cm−1 for sp3
-hybridized carbon and 
above 3000 cm−1 for sp2
. The fingerprint region is used less for determining 
structure than for verifying whether two compounds are identical or not.
Section 14.22 Functional-group identification is the main contribution of IR spectroscopy to 
organic chemistry. Various classes of compounds exhibit peaks at particular 
frequencies characteristic of the functional groups they contain (Table 14.3).
Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy
Section 14.23 Transitions between electronic energy levels involving electromagnetic radiation 
in the 200–800-nm range form the basis of UV-VIS spectroscopy. The 
absorption peaks tend to be broad but are often useful in indicating the 
presence of particular π electron systems within a molecule.
Mass Spectrometry
Section 14.24 Mass spectrometry exploits the information obtained when a molecule is 
ionized by electron impact and then dissociates to smaller fragments. Positive 
ions are separated and detected according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. 
By examining the fragments and by knowing how classes of molecules 
dissociate on electron impact, one can deduce the structure of a compound. 
Mass spectrometry is quite sensitive; as little as 10−9 g of compound is 
sufficient for analysis.
Section 14.25 A compound’s molecular formula gives information about the number of double 
bonds and rings it contains and is a useful complement to spectroscopic 
methods of structure determination.

More on Coupling Constants
As a result of the coupling of the nuclear spin of a proton with the spins of other protons, its 
1
H  NMR signal is often split into two or more smaller peaks. The chemical-shift difference in 
hertz between the individual peaks in the resulting multiplet can provide structural information 
and is governed by a coupling constant J, which in most cases can be determined directly from 
the spectrum. For example, the difference between any two adjacent lines in either the quartet or 
triplet in the 1
H NMR spectrum of ethyl bromide is 7.5 Hz and is cited as the vicinal, or three￾bond (HCCH), coupling constant (3
J).

δ (ppm)
The splitting pattern for ethyl bromide conforms to the n + 1 rule, which states that n
adjacent nonequivalent protons split the signal for an observed proton into n + 1 lines. However, 
when a proton is unequally coupled to two or more nonequivalent protons, the splittings are 
independent of each other. Each of the vinylic protons Ha, Hb, and Hc in vinyl acetate, for example, 
is unequally coupled to the other two and each is split into a doublet of doublets (Figure 14.58).
Table 14.5 gives ranges for a variety of representative coupling constants. Their exact value 
within the range is influenced by several factors, including the number of bonds separating the

As the table indicates, 1
H NMR can indicate whether two benzene protons are ortho, meta, 
or para to each other, whether two protons are cis, trans, or geminal on a double bond, or whether 
a vicinal pair on a cyclohexane ring is gauche or anti.
The relation of J to dihedral angle in a pair of vicinal protons was explored on a theoretical 
basis by Martin Karplus of Columbia University who calculated that 3
J is greatest when the 
HCCH dihedral angle is 0° or 180° and smallest when the angle is 90° (Figure 14.59).

Organometallic Compounds
Organometallic compounds are compounds that have a 
carbon–metal bond; they occupy the place where organic and 
inorganic chemistry meet. You are already familiar with at least 
one organometallic compound, sodium acetylide (NaCCH), 
which has an ionic bond between carbon and sodium. But just 
because a compound contains both a metal and carbon isn’t 
enough to classify it as organometallic. Like sodium acetylide, 
sodium methoxide (NaOCH3) is an ionic compound. Unlike 
sodium acetylide, however, the negative charge in sodium 
methoxide resides on oxygen, not carbon.
Sodium acetylide
(has a carbon-to-metal bond)
Na+ C CH −
Sodium methoxide
(does not have a carbon-to-metal bond)
Na+ OCH3
−
The properties of organometallic compounds are very dif￾ferent from those of the other classes we have studied so far and 
differ among themselves according to the metal, its oxidation state, 
and the organic groups attached to the metal. Many organometallic 
compounds are sources of nucleophilic carbon, a quality that 
makes them especially valuable to the synthetic organic chemist 
who needs to make carbon–carbon bonds. For example, the prep￾aration of alkynes by the reaction of sodium acetylide with alkyl 
halides (Section 9.6) depends on the presence of a negatively 
charged, nucleophilic carbon in acetylide ion. Conversely, certain 
other organometallic compounds behave as electrophiles.
Parkinsonism results from a dopamine deficit in the brain that affects the 
“firing” of neurons. It responds to treatment with a chiral drug (l-dopa), one 
commercial synthesis of which involves the enantioselective organorhodium￾catalyzed hydrogenation described in Section 15.13.

A comprehensive treatment of organometallic chemistry would require a book of its 
own. In this chapter the preparation, properties, and usefulness of some of the most common 
organometallic reagents, those based on magnesium and lithium, are described in some 
detail. Other organometallic compounds derived from less familiar metals are introduced by 
highlighting some of their synthetic applications. We will also continue the story of alkene 
polymerization by introducing modern methods based on transition-metal catalysts.
15.1 Organometallic Nomenclature
Organometallic compounds of main-group metals are named as substituted derivatives 
of the metal. The metal is the parent, and the attached alkyl groups are identified by the 
appropriate prefix.
Li
H
Cyclopropyllithium
H2C CHNa
Vinylsodium
(CH3CH2)2Mg
Diethylmagnesium
When the metal bears a substituent other than carbon, the substituent is treated as if it 
were an anion and named separately.
CH3MgI
Methylmagnesium iodide
(CH3CH2)2AlCl
Diethylaluminum chloride
Problem 15.1
Each of the following organometallic reagents will be encountered later in this chapter. 
Suggest a suitable name for each.
Li
CH3

ICH2ZnI
H

(a) (b) (c)
Sample Solution (a) The metal lithium is considered the parent. The alkyl group to which it 
is bonded is tert-butyl, and so the name of this organometallic compound is tert-butyllithium. 
An alternative, equally correct name is 1,1-dimethylethyllithium.
An exception to this type of nomenclature is NaCCH, which is normally referred to 
as sodium acetylide. Both sodium acetylide and ethynylsodium are acceptable IUPAC names.
The second half of this chapter concentrates on organometallic complexes of tran￾sition metals. These complexes are normally named on the basis of the parent metal, 
with the attached groups (ligands) cited in alphabetical order preceding the metal. Their 
structural variety, however, requires a greater number of rules than is needed for our 
purposes and their nomenclature will be developed only to the degree necessary.
15.2 Carbon–Metal Bonds
With an electronegativity of 2.5 (Figure 15.1), carbon is neither strongly electropositive 
nor strongly electronegative. When carbon is bonded to an element more electronegative 
than itself, such as oxygen or chlorine, the electron distribution in the bond is polarized 
so that carbon is slightly positive and the more electronegative atom is slightly negative. 
Conversely, when carbon is bonded to a less electronegative element, such as a metal, 
the electrons in the bond are more strongly attracted toward carbon.

This is especially true with Group 1A and 2A metals where the bonds range from ionic 
to polar covalent, depending on the metal and the nature of the organic group to which 
it is attached. Less electropositive metals such as copper have much less polarized cova￾lent bonds to carbon (Figure 15.2).
Many organometallic compounds have carbanionic character, and the ionic character of 
the carbon–metal bond becomes more pronounced as the metal becomes more electropositive. 
Organosodium and organopotassium compounds have ionic carbon–metal bonds; organo￾lithium and organomagnesium compounds tend to have covalent, but rather polar, carbon–metal 
bonds with significant carbanionic character. This carbanionic character makes these compounds 
especially useful as sources of nucleophilic carbon in organic synthesis.
Carbanions are the conjugate bases 
of hydrocarbons and were introduced 
in Section 9.5.

In general, carbon–metal bonds involving transition elements are not as polar as 
those of the elements in Groups 1A and 2A and exhibit less carbanionic character. The 
availability of d orbitals of transition elements, however, provides opportunities for novel 
and useful types of reactivity not available to main-group metals. The first part of this 
chapter deals with Group 1A and 2A organometallics, the second part with the transition￾metal organometallics. Both emphasize synthetic applications.
15.3 Preparation of Organolithium and 
Organomagnesium Compounds
The most useful organometallic compounds of Groups 1A and 2A are those of lithium 
and magnesium. Organomagnesium compounds are called Grignard reagents after the 
French chemist Victor Grignard, who developed efficient methods for their preparation 
and demonstrated their value in synthesis. Grignard reagents and their lithium analogs 
are prepared by the reaction of the metal with an alkyl (primary, secondary, or tertiary), 
aryl, or vinyl halide, usually in diethyl ether as the solvent.

The order of halide reactivity is I > Br > Cl > F, and alkyl halides are more reactive 
than aryl and vinyl halides. As shown in the preceding examples, the reactions are nor￾mally carried out in diethyl ether. When more vigorous reaction conditions are required, 
as in the preparation of vinylmagnesium chloride from vinyl chloride, the higher boiling 
solvent tetrahydrofuran is used.

In all cases, it is especially important that the solvent be anhydrous. Even trace amounts 
of water or alcohols react with organolithium and organomagnesium reagents to form 
insoluble hydroxides or alkoxides that coat the surface of the metal and prevent it from 
reacting with the alkyl halide. Also, as we’ll discuss in Section 15.4, organolithium and 
organomagnesium reagents are very strong bases and react instantly with water and 
alcohols to form hydrocarbons.
Problem 15.2
Write equations showing how you could prepare 2-methylpropylmagnesium bromide 
[(CH3)2CHCH2MgBr] from 2-methylpropene and any necessary organic or inorganic reagents.
Grignard shared the 1912 Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry with Paul Sabatier, who 
showed that finely divided nickel is an 
effective hydrogenation catalyst.
Recall the structure of tetrahydrofuran, 
abbreviated THF, from Section 3.15:
O606 Chapter 15 Organometallic Compounds
The reaction of an organic halide with a metal is an oxidation–reduction in which the 
metal is the reducing agent. As shown in the following equations for the reactions of methyl 
chloride with lithium and with magnesium, a single-electron transfer from the metal converts 
methyl chloride to a radical anion, which then dissociates to a methyl radical and chloride 
ion. Bond formation between methyl radical and a metal species (·Li or Mg+) follows.

We can understand the tendency for the radical anion [H3CCl:]·− to dissociate to a 
methyl radical and chloride ion by referring to Figure 15.3, which illustrates the destabi￾lizing antibonding interaction between carbon and chlorine in the highest occupied molec￾ular orbital (HOMO) of the radical anion. This results in a much weaker bond and a 
CCl distance, calculated to be 324 pm (3.24 Å), that is longer than that of methyl 
chloride itself (181 pm, 1.81 Å).
The actual structures of organolithium and organomagnesium compounds are rarely 
monomeric as shown here; dimers are common, as well as higher aggregates, depending 
on the structure of the organometallic and the solvent.
Organolithium and organomagnesium compounds find their chief use in the prepa￾ration of alcohols by reaction with aldehydes and ketones. Before discussing these reac￾tions, let us first examine their reactions with proton donors.
15.4 Organolithium and Organomagnesium 
Compounds as Brønsted Bases
Organolithium and organomagnesium compounds are stable species in aprotic solvents such 
as diethyl ether. They are strongly basic, however, and react instantly with proton donors 
even as weakly acidic as water and alcohols. A proton is transferred from the hydroxyl group 
to the negatively polarized carbon of the organometallic compound to form a hydrocarbon.

Because of their basicity organolithium compounds and Grignard reagents cannot 
be prepared or used in the presence of any material that bears an OH group. Nor are 
they compatible with NH or SH groups, which can also convert an organolithium 
or organomagnesium compound to a hydrocarbon by proton transfer.
The carbon–metal bonds of organolithium and organomagnesium compounds have 
appreciable carbanionic character. Carbanions rank among the strongest bases that we’ll

15.5 Synthesis of Alcohols Using Grignard 
and Organolithium Reagents
The main synthetic application of Grignard and organolithium reagents is their reaction with 
carbonyl-containing compounds to produce alcohols. Carbon–carbon bond formation is rapid 
and exothermic when Grignard and organolithium reagents react with an aldehyde or ketone.

A carbonyl group is quite polar, and its carbon atom is electrophilic. Grignard and organo￾lithium reagents are nucleophilic and add to carbonyl groups, forming a new carbon–carbon 
bond. This addition step leads to an alkoxymagnesium halide or a lithium alkoxide, which in 
the second stage of the synthesis is converted to the desired alcohol by adding aqueous acid.

The type of alcohol produced depends on the carbonyl compound. Substituents 
present on the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone stay there—they become sub￾stituents on the carbon that bears the hydroxyl group in the product. Thus, as shown in 
Table 15.1, formaldehyde reacts with Grignard reagents to yield primary alcohols, alde￾hydes yield secondary alcohols, and ketones yield tertiary alcohols. Analogous reactions 
take place with organolithium reagents.

An ability to form carbon–carbon bonds is fundamental to organic synthesis. The 
addition of Grignard and organolithium reagents to aldehydes and ketones is one of the 
most frequently used reactions in synthetic organic chemistry. Not only does it permit 
the extension of carbon chains, but because the product is an alcohol, a wide variety of 
subsequent functional-group transformations is possible.

As noted in Section 15.4, acetylenic Grignard reagents of the type RCCMgBr

aldehydes and ketones in the usual way.

15.7 Retrosynthetic Analysis and Grignard 
and Organolithium Reagents
Constructing the desired carbon skeleton is a primary concern in synthetic organic chem￾istry, and we have already seen a number of methods for making carbon–carbon bonds 
in earlier chapters. The present section illustrates how to use retrosynthetic analysis to 
identify situations in which the reaction of a Grignard or organolithium reagent with an 
aldehyde or ketone can be used to advantage in building a carbon chain.
As illustrated earlier in Table 15.1, the main use of Grignard and organolithium 
reagents lies in the synthesis of alcohols. In such cases, the retrosynthesis focuses on the 
carbon that bears the hydroxyl group and begins by disconnecting one of its organic 
substituents as the corresponding anion.

These reactions are normally carried 
out in liquid ammonia because that is

the alkyne is prepared.15.8 An Organozinc Reagent for Cyclopropane Synthesis 611
This disconnection identifies the carbonyl component in the potential CC bond-forming 
step, and R represents the group that adds to the carbonyl as a carbanion. For retrosyn￾thetic purposes, Grignard and organolithium reagents (RMgX and RLi) are regarded as 
synthetically equivalent to a carbanion (R:−). If the target is a primary alcohol (RCH2OH), 
the carbonyl component is formaldehyde. If the target is a secondary alcohol, there are 
two retrosyntheses that differ in which R group is the carbanion equivalent and which 
remains attached to the carbonyl.

Three disconnections are possible for tertiary alcohols.
There is often little advantage in choosing one route over another when preparing 
a particular target alcohol. For example, all three of the following combinations have

Problem 15.5
Use retrosynthetic analysis to develop a synthesis of 2-phenyl-2-butanol from benzene and 
2-butyne as the source of all of the carbons and write a series of equations for the synthesis 
showing all necessary reagents.
All that has been said in this section applies with equal force to organolithium 
reagents. Grignard reagents are one source of nucleophilic carbon; organolithium reagents 
are another. Both have substantial carbanionic character in their carbon–metal bonds and 
undergo the same kinds of reactions with aldehydes and ketones.

Zinc is less electropositive than lithium and magnesium, and the carbon–zinc bond is 
less polar. Organozinc reagents are not nearly as reactive toward aldehydes and ketones 
as Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds.
An organozinc compound that occupies a special niche in organic synthesis is 
iodomethylzinc iodide (ICH2ZnI). It is prepared by the reaction of zinc–copper couple 
[Zn(Cu)], zinc that has had its surface activated with a little copper, with diiodomethane 
in diethyl ether.

Iodomethylzinc iodide is a useful reagent because it reacts with alkenes to give cyclo￾propanes. This reaction is called the Simmons–Smith reaction and is one of the few 
methods available for the synthesis of cyclopropanes. The reaction is stereospecific. Sub￾stituents that were cis in the alkene remain cis in the cyclopropane.

Cyclopropanation of alkenes with the Simmons–Smith reagent bears some simi￾larity to epoxidation. Both reactions are stereospecific cycloadditions, and iodometh￾ylzinc iodide behaves, like peroxy acids, as a weak electrophile. Both cycloadditions 
take place faster with more highly substituted double bonds than less substituted ones, 
but are sensitive to steric hindrance in the alkene. These similarities are reflected in 
the mechanisms proposed for the two reactions shown in Mechanism 15.1. Both are 
believed to be concerted.
Prior to experiments with 
organomagnesium compounds, Victor 
Grignard’s earlier experiments dealt 
with organic derivatives of zinc.
Iodomethylzinc iodide is known as the 
Simmons–Smith reagent, after 
Howard E. Simmons and Ronald D. 
Smith of DuPont, who first described 
its use in the preparation of 
cyclopropanes.

the synthesis, four of the six rings arise by Simmons–Smith-type cyclopropanation. The

in this way; the blue lines identify bonds that originated with the initial reactant.

15.9 Carbenes and Carbenoids
Iodomethylzinc iodide is often referred to as a carbenoid, meaning that it resembles a 
carbene in its chemical reactions. Carbenes are neutral molecules in which one of the 
carbon atoms has six valence electrons. Such carbons are divalent; they are directly 
bonded to only two other atoms and have no multiple bonds. Iodomethylzinc iodide reacts 
as if it were a source of the carbene H H C .
It is clear that free :CH2 is not involved in the Simmons–Smith reaction, but there 
is substantial evidence to indicate that carbenes are formed as intermediates in certain 
other reactions that convert alkenes to cyclopropanes. The most studied examples of these 
reactions involve dichlorocarbene and dibromocarbene.

Carbenes are too reactive to be isolated and stored, but have been trapped in frozen argon 
for spectroscopic study at very low temperatures. Bonding in dihalocarbenes is based on 
sp2
 hybridization of carbon, shown for CCl2 in Figure 15.4a. Two of carbon’s sp2
 hybrid 
orbitals are involved in σ bonds to the halogen. The third sp2
 orbital contains the unshared 
Divalent carbon species first received 
attention with the work of the Swiss￾American chemist J. U. Nef in the late 
nineteenth century; they were then 
largely ignored until the 1950s.

electron pair, and the unhybridized 2p orbital is vacant. The electrostatic potential map 
in Figure 15.4b illustrates this nicely with the highest negative character (red) concen￾trated in the region of the lone pair orbital, and the region of highest positive charge 
(blue) situated above and below the plane of the carbene.
15.10 Transition-Metal Organometallic Compounds
The transition elements occupy groups 3–11 of the periodic table and are characterized 
electronically as having a partially filled d subshell. A related but not equivalent term is 
d-block element, which includes all of these plus the elements in group 12. The first 
sequence of d-block elements begins in the fourth period with scandium, which has one 
3d electron, and continues through zinc, which has ten. The second (4d) and third (5d) 
transition series are analogous.

Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn
The group number (3–12) corresponds to the number of valence electrons, and the num￾ber of d electrons is two less than the group number. Manganese, for example, has seven 
valence electrons and five 3d electrons and is referred to as a d5
 element. Mn2+ is a d3
 ion, 
as is Fe3+.
Problem 15.7
How many 4d electrons are there in Pd2+? What +2 ion in the fourth period has the same 
number of 3d electrons? In the sixth period?
An already large and steadily increasing number of organometallic compounds 
of transition elements is known, and their applications in both laboratory and indus￾trial processes have transformed synthetic organic chemistry. They not only make it 
possible to carry out reactions that are difficult to do otherwise but in many cases 
do so as catalysts rather than reactants. Before we look at the reactions of transition￾metal organometallics in this and subsequent sections, some structural background 
is in order.
We’ll start with nickel carbonyl, an intermediate in the purification of nickel first 
prepared over a hundred years ago. It is a neutral molecule (boiling point: 43°C) that 
forms spontaneously when carbon monoxide is passed over elemental nickel.

A structural unit attached to the metal is called a ligand, and can be an element, 
a compound (carbon monoxide in this case), or an ion; also, it can be organic or 
inorganic. Ligands are electron-pair donors (Lewis bases) and include the following 
plus many others.
H R Cl NH3 P(C6H5)3 C O C N
Hydride Alkyl Chloride Ammonia Triphenylphosphine Carbon monoxide Cyanide15.10 Transition-Metal Organometallic Compounds 615
Many transition-metal complexes obey the 18-electron rule, which is to transition 
elements as the octet rule is to main-group elements. It states:
The number of ligands that can be attached to a transition metal are such that the 
sum of the electrons in the bonds to the metal plus the metal’s valence electrons 
equals 18.
Both the octet rule and the 18-electron rule connect stability to noble gas electron configu￾rations. The noble gases in the second and third periods of the periodic table (Ne and Ar) 
have 8 valence electrons, those in the fourth and fifth (Kr and Xe) have 18.
Because the custom for writing structural formulas of transition-metal complexes 
omits electrons and formal charges, we need to first know the charge on the complex 
itself in order to apply the 18-electron rule. Take Ni(CO)4, which is a neutral molecule, 
as an example. We count the valence electrons of nickel as given by its group number 
(10) and add to that the total number of electrons in NiC bonds (8) for a total of 18. 
The 18-electron rule is satisfied for Ni(CO)4.
Problem 15.8
Like nickel, iron reacts with carbon monoxide to form a compound having the formula M(CO)n
that obeys the 18-electron rule. What is the value of n in the formula Fe(CO)n?
Transition-metal complexes that have an electron count less than 18 are described 
as coordinatively unsaturated and can take on additional ligands.
Not all ligands use just two electrons to bond to transition metals. Benzene uses 
its six π electrons in organometallic compounds such as (benzene)tricarbonylchromium.

The complex is neutral, and chromium is a group 6 transition metal, so contributes six 
valence electrons. The three CO ligands contribute six more, and the six π electrons of 
benzene bring the total to 18.

What is the electron count of manganese in the cation shown? Is it coordinatively unsaturated?

Like benzene, cyclopentadienyl anion is an aromatic six π electron system 
(Section  12.20) and bonds to transition metals in a similar way. Ferrocene is the best 
known example, with a structure aptly described as a sandwich.
Fe
Ferrocene
Ferrocene is neutral, and each cyclopentadienyl ligand brings a charge of −1; therefore, 
the oxidation state of iron is +2. Iron is a group 8 transition metal, but being in the +2 
oxidation state contributes six, rather than eight, electrons. These 6, plus 12 from the 
two cyclopentadienide ligands, bring the total to 18.
Problem 15.10
What is the oxidation state of manganese in the complex given in Problem 15.9?
Metallocenes, organometallic compounds that bear cyclopentadienyl ligands, are 
not only structurally interesting but many of them have useful applications as catalysts 
for industrial processes. Zirconium-based metallocenes, for example, are the most widely 
used catalysts for Ziegler–Natta polymerization of alkenes. We’ll have more to say about 
them in Section 15.15 and Chapter 27.

Naturally occurring compounds with carbon–metal bonds are very rare, coenzyme 
B12 being the best known example (see the boxed essay An Organometallic Compound 
That Occurs Naturally: Coenzyme B12 that accompanies this section).
In Sections 15.11 and 15.12, we’ll describe some synthetic applications of organo￾copper and organopalladium compounds used to form CC bonds between organic 
groups. The two types differ in that the organocopper compounds to be described are 
reagents present in stoichiometric amounts, whereas the organopalladium compounds are 
catalysts.15.10 Transition-Metal Organometallic Compounds 617
An Organometallic Compound That Occurs Naturally: 
Coenzyme B12
Pernicious anemia is a disease characterized, as are all ane￾mias, by a deficiency of red blood cells. Unlike ordinary 
anemia, pernicious anemia does not respond to treatment with 
sources of iron, and before effective treatments were devel￾oped, was often fatal. Injection of liver extracts was one such 
treatment, and in 1948 chemists succeeded in isolating the “anti￾pernicious anemia factor” from beef liver as a red crystalline 
compound, which they called vitamin B12. This compound had 
the formula C63H88CoN14O14P. Its complexity precluded structure 
determination by classical degradation techniques, and spectro￾scopic methods were too primitive to be of much help. The 
structure was solved by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin of Oxford 
University in 1955 using X-ray diffraction techniques and is 
shown in Figure 15.5a. Structure determination by X-ray crystal￾lography can be superficially considered as taking a photograph 
of a molecule with X-rays. It is a demanding task and earned 
Hodgkin the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Modern structural 
studies by X-ray crystallography use computers to collect and 
analyze the diffraction data and take only a fraction of the time 
required years ago to solve the vitamin B12 structure.
The structure of vitamin B12 is interesting in that it contains 
a central cobalt atom that is surrounded by six atoms in an octa￾hedral geometry. One substituent, the cyano (CN) group, is 
what is known as an “artifact.” It appears to be introduced into 
the molecule during the isolation process and leads to the 
synonym cyanocobalamin for vitamin B12. This is the material 
used to treat pernicious anemia, but is not the form in which it 
exerts its activity. The biologically active substance is called 
coenzyme B12 and differs from vitamin B12 in the ligand attached 
to cobalt (Figure 15.5b). Coenzyme B12 was the first naturally 
occurring substance discovered to have a carbon–metal bond. 
In fact, coenzyme B12 was discovered before any compound 
containing an alkyl group σ-bonded to cobalt had ever been 
isolated in the laboratory!

15.11 Organocopper Reagents
Early observations that certain Grignard reactions could be catalyzed by copper salts 
eventually led to systematic studies of organocopper compounds as reagents for carbon–carbon 
bond formation. Of these, lithium diorganocuprates known as Gilman reagents proved 
to be the most effective.
Gilman reagents are prepared by the reaction of a copper(I) halide with two equiv￾alents of an alkyl- or aryllithium in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.

Henry Gilman, whose career at Iowa 
State spanned the period 1919–1975, 
was the first to prepare and study 
organocuprates.15.11 Organocopper Reagents 619
The reactions of diorganocuprates with alkyl halides have characteristics that we’ve 
come to associate with the SN2 mechanism:
Relative reactivity: RI > RBr > RCl >> RF
CH3 > primary > secondary > tertiary
Substitution/Elimination: Mainly substitution with primary alkyl halides; 
elimination with secondary and tertiary alkyl halides.
Stereochemistry: Inversion of configuration at sp3
-hybridized carbon.
However, the fact that vinylic and aryl halides undergo similar reactions suggests that 
SN2 cannot be the only possible mechanism. An alternative, and more likely, mechanism 
begins by regarding the dialkylcuprate as equivalent to the product of the reaction 
between Cu+ and two methyl anions.
H3C Cu CH3 H3C Cu CH3
Copper is a group 11 element, so Cu+ contributes 10 valence electrons, and the two 
methyl anions contribute 4 more, for a total of 14. With fewer than 18 valence electrons, 
copper is coordinatively unsaturated and can accommodate additional ligands. When 
dimethylcuprate reacts with an alkyl halide RX, both R and X become ligands on copper.
H3C Cu CH3

H3C Cu CH3 + R X
oxidative
addition
Copper gains two electrons from the RX bond, increasing its electron count from 14 
to 16, and the 18-electron rule is not exceeded.
In spite of this increase in electron count, the reaction is classified as an oxidative 
addition. The reason for this seeming anomaly is that counting electrons for the purpose 
of the 18-electron rule differs from calculating oxidation state. Two new bonds, CuR 
and CuX, are formed by a process in which two electrons come from RX and two d
electrons from copper. We count all the electrons around an atom for the 18-electron rule, 
but when calculating oxidation number assign both electrons in a bond to the more elec￾tronegative partner, which is almost never the metal. Thus, copper is in the +1 oxidation 
state in R2Cu− and in the +3 oxidation state in the product of oxidative addition. Oxidative 
addition increases the electron count of a transition metal, but counts as a loss of two 
electrons when calculating oxidation state.
The counterpart of oxidative addition is reductive elimination and constitutes the 
next step in the reaction.

Of the four electrons in the CuX and CuCH3 bonds, two remain on copper after

the overall reaction.

15.12 Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling
Four transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling procedures, known separately as the 
Stille, Negishi, Suzuki-Miyaura, and Heck couplings, have emerged as powerful meth￾ods for making carbon–carbon bonds. Collectively, their most important qualities include 
their efficiency, tolerance of functionality elsewhere in the reacting molecules, versatil￾ity with respect to hybridization state, and the fact that palladium is used only in cata￾lytic amounts. The four involve the Pd(0)-catalyzed reaction of a suitably functionalized

As the examples illustrate, the synthesis of biaryls has received much attention. 
One reason is that they are difficult to synthesize, another is that they are often candi￾dates for new drugs. The product in the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, for example, is an 
intermediate in the synthesis of atazanavir, a protease inhibitor used in the treatment 
of HIV–AIDS. Numerous other classes of compounds are accessible by appropriate 
choices of reactants.
The reactions tolerate many functional groups, including OH, CO, and NO2, 
elsewhere in the molecule, and as shown in the Heck example, the stereochemistry of 
the double bond is retained when cross-coupling involves an sp2
-hybridized carbon.
It should also be noted that various sources of palladium are given in the examples. 
The active oxidation state is Pd(0) in all these reactions, even when the source is Pd2+
as in the Heck reaction example that uses palladium acetate.

The 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
was awarded to Richard F. Heck 
(University of Delaware), Ei-ichi 
Negishi (Purdue University), and Akira 
Suzuki-Miyaura (Hokkaido University) 
for their work on palladium-catalyzed 
cross-coupling reactions. Early and 
important contributions were made by 
John Stille (Colorado State University) 
before his untimely death in a 1989 
plane crash.622 Chapter 15 Organometallic Compounds
The mechanisms of palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings are complicated, but they 
all begin the same way—by oxidative addition of an organic halide to the catalyst (repre￾sented here as PdL2, where L is a ligand). This is followed by transmetalation in the 
Stille, Negishi, and Suzuki-Miyaura methods through which palladium displaces another 
metal (Sn, Zn, or B) on the organometallic reactant. Reductive elimination creates a 
CC bond between R and R′ and regenerates the catalyst.

π Complex
Coordination of the π electrons of the double bond with palladium gives a π complex, 
which rearranges by migration of the substituent R to the less substituted carbon of the 
double bond while palladium bonds to the other carbon. Dissociation of the complex 
gives the alkene. Other steps (not shown) restore the original form of the catalyst.
Catalytic processes are often represented by a catalytic cycle that shows the conver￾sion of reactants to products and regeneration of the catalyst, in this case PdL2. A catalytic 
cycle for the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling illustrated by reaction (c) earlier in this section is 
shown in Figure 15.6. The aryl boronic acid serves as the aryl group donor in the trans￾metalation step in this reaction.

“Transmetalation” is sometimes

spelled it with one “l.”15.13 Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation 623
15.13 Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation
We have seen numerous examples of the hydrogenation of alkenes catalyzed by various 
finely divided metals such as Ni, Pt, Pd, and Rh. In all those cases, the metal acted as 
a heterogeneous catalyst, present as a solid while the alkene was in solution. The idea 
of carrying out hydrogenations in homogeneous solution seems far-fetched inasmuch as 
no solvent is capable of simultaneously dissolving both metals and hydrocarbons. Never￾theless, there is a way to do it.
Rhodium is a good catalyst for alkene hydrogenation (Section 8.1), as are many 
of its complexes such as tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium chloride (Wilkinson’s 
catalyst).

Like rhodium itself, Wilkinson’s catalyst is an effective catalyst for alkene hydrogenation. 
Unlike rhodium metal, however, Wilkinson’s catalyst is soluble in many organic solvents.
Geoffrey Wilkinson (Imperial College, 
London) shared the 1973 Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry with Ernst O. Fischer 
(Munich) for their achievements in 
organometallic chemistry. In addition 
to work on catalysts for homogeneous 
hydrogenation, Wilkinson collaborated 
on determining the structure of 
ferrocene as well as numerous other 
aspects of organometallic compounds.

Homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of the compound shown gives two

Rhodium is in the +1 oxidation state in Wilkinson’s catalyst, so is a d8
 ion. Its four 
ligands count for 8 more electrons, bringing the total number of valence electrons to 16. 
Addition of H2 in the first step raises the number to 18. Loss of a triphenylphosphine 
ligand in the second step reduces the number of valence electrons to 16 and gives the 
active form of the catalyst, setting in motion the repeating cycle of four steps for alkene 
hydrogenation shown in Mechanism 15.2.
The effect that homogeneous transition-metal catalysis has had on stereoselective 
synthesis is especially impressive. Using chiral ligands, it is possible to control hydrogena￾tion of double bonds so that new chirality centers have a particular configuration. The drug 
l-dopa, used to treat Parkinsonism, is prepared in multiton quantities by enantioselective 
hydrogenation catalyzed by an enantiomerically pure chiral rhodium complex.

The synthesis of l-dopa was one of the earliest of what has become an important 
advance in the pharmaceutical industry—the preparation and marketing of chiral drugs 
as single enantiomers (see the boxed essay, Chiral Drugs, in Chapter 4). William 
S. Knowles (Monsanto) and Ryoji Noyori (Nagoya, Japan) shared one half of the 2001 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their independent work on enantioselective hydrogenations. 
Knowles devised and carried out the synthesis of l-dopa and Noyori developed a variety 
of chiral catalysts which varied both the metal and the ligands to achieve enantio￾selectivities approaching 100%.
Chirality is built into the catalysts by employing ligands with either chirality centers 
or axes. Noyori’s widely used BINAP has a chirality axis, and crowding prevents inter￾conversion of enantiomers by restricting rotation around the bond connecting the naph￾thalene rings. The metal, usually ruthenium, is held in place by the two phosphorus atoms 
(yellow) in a chiral environment. The steric demands in the cavity occupied by the metal 
in Ru-BINAP cause reaction to occur preferentially at one face of the double bond.

A large number of enantioselective transition-metal catalysts have been developed, 
not just for hydrogenation but for other reactions as well. The opportunities for fine￾tuning their properties by varying the metal, its oxidation state, and the ligands are almost 
limitless.
15.14 Olefin Metathesis
The 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was jointly awarded to Robert H. Grubbs (Caltech), 
Yves Chauvin (French Petroleum Institute), and Richard R. Schrock (MIT) for establish￾ing olefin metathesis as a reaction of synthetic versatility and contributing to an under￾standing of the mechanism of this novel process. Olefin metathesis first surfaced in the 
late 1950s when industrial researchers found that alkenes underwent a novel reaction 
when passed over a heated bed of mixed metal oxides. Propene, for example, was con￾verted to a mixture of ethylene and 2-butene (cis + trans).

BINAP is an abbreviation for 
2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-
binaphthyl.
The word metathesis refers to an 
interchange, or transposition, of 
objects.15.14 Olefin Metathesis 627
This same transformation was subsequently duplicated at lower temperatures by homo￾geneous transition-metal catalysis. An equilibrium is established, and the same mixture 
is obtained regardless of whether propene or a 1:1 mixture of ethylene and 2-butene is 
subjected to the reaction conditions. This type of olefin metathesis is called a cross￾metathesis.
When cross-metathesis was first discovered, propene enjoyed only limited use and 
the reaction was viewed as a potential source of ethylene. Once methods were developed 
for the preparation of stereoregular polypropylene, however, propene became more valu￾able and cross-metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene now serves as a source of propene.
The relationship between reactants and products in cross-metathesis can be ana￾lyzed retrosynthetically by joining the double bonds in two reactant molecules by dotted 
lines, then disconnecting in the other direction.

Although this representation helps us relate products and reactants, it is not related to 
the mechanism. Nothing containing a ring of four carbons is an intermediate in olefin 
cross-metathesis.
Problem 15.18
What alkenes are formed from 2-pentene by olefin cross-metathesis?
The generally accepted mechanism for olefin cross-metathesis is outlined for 
the  case of propene in Mechanism 15.3. The catalyst’s structure is characterized by a 
carbon–metal double bond, and the metal is typically ruthenium (Ru), tungsten (W), or 
molybdenum (Mo).
One of the most widely used catalysts for olefin metathesis is the ruthenium carbene 
complex shown. It is called Grubbs’ catalyst and abbreviated Cl2(PCy3)2RuCHC6H5.

Olefin cross-metathesis is an intermolecular reaction between double bonds in

same molecule are also common and lead to ring formation. The process is called ring￾closing metathesis.

Although olefin metathesis is an equilibrium process, it can give high yields of the 
desired product when ethylene is formed as the other alkene. Being a gas, ethylene 
escapes from the reaction mixture, and the equilibrium shifts to the right in accordance 
with Le Châtelier’s principle. Ring-closing metathesis has been widely and imaginatively 
applied to the synthesis of natural products. It occurs under mild conditions and tolerates 
the presence of numerous functional groups.
Compounds with a formal transition￾metal-to-carbon double bond are 
called carbene complexes. 628 Chapter 15 Organometallic Compounds

15.15 Ziegler–Natta Catalysis of Alkene Polymerization
We have already described the essentials of the free-radical polymerization of alkenes in 
Sections 10.8 and 12.14. In the present section we introduce a very different method—
coordination polymerization—that has revolutionized the industry.
In the early 1950s, Karl Ziegler, then at the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research 
in Germany, was studying the use of aluminum compounds as catalysts for the oligo￾merization of ethylene.
Al(CH2CH3)3
Ethylene
nH2C CH2
Ethylene oligomers
CH3CH2(CH2CH2)n−2CH CH2
Ziegler found that adding certain metals or their compounds to the reaction mixture led 
to the formation of ethylene oligomers with 6–18 carbons, but others promoted the for￾mation of very long carbon chains giving polyethylene. Both were major discoveries. 
The 6–18 carbon ethylene oligomers constitute a class of industrial organic chemicals 
known as linear α olefins that are produced at a rate of 3 × 109
 pounds/year in the United 
States. The Ziegler route to polyethylene is even more important because it occurs at 
modest temperatures and pressures and gives high-density polyethylene, which has prop￾erties superior to the low-density material formed by the free-radical polymerization 
described in Section 10.8.
Ziegler had a working relationship with the Italian chemical company Montecatini, 
for which Giulio Natta of the Milan Polytechnic Institute was a consultant. When Natta 
used Ziegler’s catalyst to polymerize propene,
CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3
it was discovered that the catalyst was effective and that it gave mainly isotactic
polypropylene.
CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3 CH3
Isotactic polypropylene Syndiotactic polypropylene
Norbornene is a common name for 
bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene.630 Chapter 15 Organometallic Compounds
Isotactic polypropylene is an example of a stereoregular polymer. All of its methyl 
groups are oriented in the same direction along the carbon chain. A second stereoregular 
form, classified as syndiotactic, has its methyl groups alternate front and back along the 
chain. When the orientation of the methyl groups is random, the polymer is not stereo￾regular and is referred to as atactic. Free-radical polymerization of propene gives atactic 
polypropylene. Isotactic polypropylene has a higher melting point than the atactic form 
and can be drawn into fibers or molded into hard, durable materials.
The earliest Ziegler–Natta catalysts were combinations of titanium tetrachloride 
(TiCl4) and diethylaluminum chloride [(CH3CH2)2AlCl], but these have given way to more 
effective zirconium-based metallocenes, the simplest of which is bis(cyclopentadienyl)￾zirconium dichloride (Section 15.10).
Cl
Cl
Zr
Bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2)
Hundreds of analogs of Cp2ZrCl2 have been prepared and evaluated as catalysts for 
ethylene and propene polymerization. The structural modifications include replacing one 
or both of the cyclopentadienyl ligands by variously substituted cyclopentadienyl groups, 
linking the two rings with carbon chains, and so on. Some modifications give syndio￾tactic polypropylene, others give isotactic.
The metallocene catalyst is used in combination with a promoter, usually methyl￾alumoxane (MAO).

CH3 n
O O Al
Mechanism 15.4 outlines ethylene polymerization in the presence of Cp2ZrCl2. 
Step 1 describes the purpose of the MAO promoter, which is to transfer a methyl group 
to the metallocene to convert it to its catalytically active form. This methyl group will 
be incorporated into the growing polymer chain—indeed, it will be the end from which 
the rest of the chain grows.
The active form of the catalyst, having one less ligand and being positively charged, 
acts as an electrophile toward ethylene in step 2.
With electrons flowing from ethylene to zirconium, the ZrCH3 bond weakens, 
the carbons of ethylene become positively polarized, and the methyl group migrates from 
zirconium to one of the carbons of ethylene. Cleavage of the ZrCH3 bond is accom￾panied by formation of a σ bond between zirconium and one of the carbons of ethylene 
in step 3. The product of this step is a chain-extended form of the active catalyst, ready 
to accept another ethylene ligand and repeat the chain-extending steps.
Before coordination polymerization was discovered by Ziegler and applied to propene 
by Natta, there was no polypropylene industry. Now, more than 1010 pounds of it are pre￾pared each year in the United States. Ziegler and Natta shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry: Ziegler for discovering novel catalytic systems for alkene polymerization and 
Natta for stereoregular polymerization. We’ll see more about Ziegler–Natta polymerization 
in Chapter 27 when we examine the properties of synthetic polymers in more detail.
Most polypropylene products are 
made from isotactic polypropylene.
Zirconium lies below titanium in the 
periodic table, so was an obvious 
choice in the search for other 
Ziegler–Natta catalysts.15.15 Ziegler–Natta Catalysis of Alkene Polymerization 631
Mechanism 15.4
Polymerization of Ethylene in the Presence of Ziegler–Natta Catalyst
Step 1: Cp2ZrCl2 is converted to the active catalyst by reaction with the promoter methylalumoxane (MAO). A methyl 
group from MAO displaces one of the chlorine ligands of Cp2ZrCl2. The second chlorine is lost as chloride 
by ionization, giving a positively charged metallocene.

results.

Allylindium Reagents
Organometallic reagents are the basis of useful methods in synthetic organic chemistry for the 
formation of carbon–carbon bonds. However, many organometallic reagents are sensitive to air 
and/or water. In the late 1980s, it was discovered that carbonyl compounds can undergo allylation,
the addition of an allyl group, with allyl halides in the presence of indium. While several solvents 
may also be used for this reaction, the use of water makes this procedure attractive from the 
standpoint of green, sustainable chemistry. Indium-mediated allylation is compatible with a variety 
of functional groups.

Alcohols, Diols, and Thiols
The next several chapters deal with the chemistry of various 
oxygen-containing functional groups. The interplay of these 
important classes of compounds—alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, 
ketones, carboxylic acids, and derivatives of carboxylic acids—
is fundamental to organic chemistry and biochemistry.

We’ll start by discussing in more detail a class of com￾pounds already familiar to us, alcohols. Alcohols were intro￾duced in Chapter 5 and have appeared regularly since then. 
With this chapter we extend our knowledge of alcohols, par￾ticularly with respect to their relationship to carbonyl-containing 
compounds. In the course of studying alcohols, we shall also 
look at some relatives. Diols are alcohols in which two 
hydroxyl groups (OH) are present; thiols are compounds 
that contain an SH group. Phenols are compounds of the 
type ArOH.
This chapter is a transitional one. It ties together much of 
the material encountered earlier and sets the stage for our study 
of other oxygen-containing functional groups in the chapters 
that follow.
This battery-powered electric car is equipped with a methanol fuel cell that 
recharges the battery while the vehicle is driven. The methanol in the fuel 
cell is not burned but converted electrochemically through the use of a 
catalyst to carbon dioxide and water. The process produces an electric 
current that charges the battery.

16.1 Sources of Alcohols
At one time, the major source of methanol was as a byproduct in the production of charcoal 
from wood—hence, the name wood alcohol. Now, most of the more than 10 billion lb of 
methanol used annually in the United States is synthetic, prepared by reduction of carbon 
monoxide with hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is normally made from methane.

The major use of methanol is in the preparation of formaldehyde as a starting 
material for various resins and plastics.
When vegetable matter ferments, its carbohydrates are converted to ethanol and carbon 
dioxide by enzymes present in yeast. Fermentation of barley produces beer; grapes give wine. 
The maximum ethanol content is on the order of 15%, because higher concentrations inacti￾vate the enzymes, halting fermentation. Distillation of the fermentation broth gives “distilled 
spirits” of increased ethanol content. The characteristic flavors, odors, and colors of the 
various alcoholic beverages depend on both their origin and the way they are aged.
Synthetic ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are derived from petroleum by hydration 
of ethylene and propene, respectively.
Most alcohols of six carbons or fewer, as well as many higher alcohols, are commer￾cially available at low cost. Some occur naturally; others are the products of efficient syn￾theses. Figure 16.1 presents the structures of a few naturally occurring alcohols. Table 16.1 
summarizes the reactions encountered in earlier chapters that give alcohols and illustrates a 
thread that runs through the fabric of organic chemistry: a reaction that is characteristic of 
one functional group often serves as a synthetic method for preparing another.

16.2 Preparation of Alcohols by Reduction 
of Aldehydes and Ketones
The most obvious way to reduce an aldehyde or a ketone to an alcohol is by hydrogena￾tion of the carbon–oxygen double bond. Like the hydrogenation of alkenes, the reaction 
is exothermic but exceedingly slow in the absence of a catalyst. Finely divided metals 
such as platinum, palladium, nickel, and ruthenium are effective catalysts for the hydro￾genation of aldehydes and ketones. Aldehydes yield primary alcohols:

Problem 16.1
Which of the isomeric C4H10O alcohols can be prepared by hydrogenation of aldehydes? 
Which can be prepared by hydrogenation of ketones? Which cannot be prepared by 
hydrogenation of a carbonyl compound?
For most laboratory-scale reductions of aldehydes and ketones, catalytic hydrogena￾tion has been replaced by methods based on metal hydride reducing agents. The two 
most common reagents are sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride.

Recall from Section 2.24 that 
reduction corresponds to a decrease 
in the number of bonds between 
carbon and oxygen or an increase in 
the number of bonds between carbon 
and hydrogen (or both).644 Chapter 16 Alcohols, Diols, and Thiols

Lithium aluminum hydride reacts violently with water and alcohols, so it must be 
used in solvents such as anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. Following reduction,

are used for LiAlH4 as for Grignard

BH4

The mechanism of lithium aluminum hydride reduction of aldehydes and ketones

16.3 Preparation of Alcohols by Reduction 
of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids are exceedingly difficult to reduce. Acetic acid, for example, is often 
used as a solvent in catalytic hydrogenations because it is inert under the reaction condi￾tions. Lithium aluminum hydride is one of the few reducing agents capable of reducing 
a carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol.

hydride and does not reduce carboxylic acids.
16.4 Preparation of Alcohols from Epoxides

with lithium aluminum hydride. We will 
examine this reaction in detail in 
Section 20.11.16.5  Preparation of Diols 647
Sample Solution (a) Reaction with ethylene oxide results in the addition of a CH2CH2OH

Epoxide rings are readily opened with cleavage of the carbon–oxygen bond when 
attacked by nucleophiles. Grignard reagents and organolithium reagents react with 
ethylene oxide by serving as sources of nucleophilic carbon. The mechanism resembles 
an SN2 reaction. Cleavage of the epoxide CO bond is analogous to the cleavage of the 
bond between carbon and a leaving group.

This kind of chemical reactivity of epoxides is rather general. Nucleophiles other than 
Grignard reagents react with epoxides, and epoxides more elaborate than ethylene oxide may 
be used. These features of epoxide chemistry will be discussed in Sections 17.11 and 17.12.
16.5 Preparation of Diols
Much of the chemistry of diols—compounds that bear two hydroxyl groups—is analo￾gous to that of alcohols. Diols may be prepared, for example, from compounds that 
contain two carbonyl groups, using the same reducing agents employed in the preparation 
of alcohols. The following example shows the conversion of a dialdehyde to a diol by 
catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively, the same transformation can be achieved by reduc￾tion with sodium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride.

3-Methylpentanedial 3-Methylpentane-1,5-diol (81–83%)
As can be seen in the preceding equation, the nomenclature of diols is similar to that 
of alcohols. The suffix -diol replaces -ol, and two locants, one for each hydroxyl group, are 
required. Note that the final -e of the parent alkane name is retained when the suffix begins 
with a consonant (-diol), but dropped when the suffix begins with a vowel (-ol).
Problem 16.4
Write an equation showing how 3-methylpentane-1,5-diol could be prepared from a dicarboxylic acid.
Vicinal diols are diols that have their hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons. Two 
commonly encountered vicinal diols are ethane-1,2-diol and propane-1,2-diol.

Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are common names for these two diols and are 
acceptable IUPAC names. Aside from these two compounds, the IUPAC system does 
not use the word glycol for naming diols.
Vicinal diols are often prepared from alkenes using osmium tetraoxide (OsO4). 
Osmium tetraoxide reacts rapidly with alkenes to give cyclic osmate esters.

Because osmium tetraoxide is regenerated in this step, alkenes can be converted to vicinal 
diols using only catalytic amounts of osmium tetraoxide in a single operation by simply 
allowing a solution of the alkene and tert-butyl hydroperoxide in tert-butyl alcohol con￾taining a small amount of osmium tetraoxide and base to stand for several hours.
Overall, the reaction leads to addition of two hydroxyl groups to the double bond 
and is referred to as dihydroxylation. Both hydroxyl groups of the diol become attached 
to the same face of the double bond; syn dihydroxylation of the alkene is observed.

alkaloid (+)-dihydroquinidine.
Problem 16.6
When trans-2-butene was subjected to enantioselective dihydroxylation, the 2,3-butanediol that 
was formed had the (R)-configuration at one carbon. What was the configuration at the other?
Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol 
are prepared industrially from the 
corresponding alkenes by way of their 
epoxides.
Enantioselective dihydroxylation is 
one aspect of novel oxidation methods 
developed by K. Barry Sharpless (The 
Scripps Research Institute). Sharpless 
shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry with William S. Knowles 
and Ryogi Noyori (Section 15.13).

Fischer esterification is reversible, and the position of equilibrium usually lies slightly

more favorable by using either the alcohol or the carboxylic acid in excess. In the fol￾lowing example, in which an excess of the alcohol was employed, the yield indicated is

The acyl group of the carboxylic acid, acyl chloride, or acid anhydride is transferred 
to the oxygen of the alcohol. This fact is most clearly evident in the esterification of

16.9 Oxidation of Alcohols
Oxidation of an alcohol yields a carbonyl compound. Whether the resulting carbonyl 
compound is an aldehyde, a ketone, or a carboxylic acid depends on the alcohol and on 
the oxidizing agent.
Primary alcohols are oxidized either to an aldehyde or to a carboxylic acid:
RCH2OH
Primary alcohol
oxidize oxidize RCH
O
Aldehyde
RCOH
O
Carboxylic acid
Vigorous oxidation leads to the formation of a carboxylic acid, but a number of methods 
permit us to stop the oxidation at the intermediate aldehyde stage. The reagents most 
commonly used for oxidizing alcohols are based on high-oxidation-state transition metals, 
particularly chromium(VI).654 Chapter 16 Alcohols, Diols, and Thiols
Chromic acid (H2CrO4) is a good oxidizing agent and is formed when solutions 
containing chromate (CrO4
2−) or dichromate (Cr2O7
2−) are acidified. Sometimes it is 
possible to obtain aldehydes in satisfactory yield before they are further oxidized, but in 
most cases carboxylic acids are the major products isolated on treatment of primary 
alcohols with chromic acid.

mixtures of products result.

The second step is slower than the first as evidenced by the observation that (CH3)2CHOH 
reacts almost seven times faster than (CH3)2CDOH. An H/D kinetic isotope effect this 
large is consistent with rate-determining carbon–hydrogen bond cleavage (Section 7.17).
As an alternative to chromium-based oxidants, chemists have developed other 
reagents for oxidizing alcohols, several of which are based on chlorodimethylsulfonium 
ion [(CH3)2SCl+]. Most commonly, chlorodimethylsulfonium ion is generated under the 
reaction conditions by the reaction of dimethyl sulfoxide with oxalyl chloride.

Sustainability and Organic Chemistry
I
n the 1970s, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment 
independently addressed sustainability—the efficient and environmentally responsible use of our resources. Ideally, a “green” or 
“benign” chemical process should be efficient, based on renewable raw materials, produce minimum waste, use catalysts rather than 
stoichiometric reagents, avoid the use or formation of toxic or hazardous materials, require minimum energy, and yield a product that 
maximizes the incorporation of all materials.
These objectives have spurred research directed toward developing alternative synthetic methods. Take alcohol oxidation, for 
example. As described in Section 16.9, primary alcohols are converted to aldehydes by oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).
OH
PCC
CH2Cl2 O
H

While this oxidation proceeds in synthetically satisfactory yield, it is inefficient in terms of atom economy. PCC is used in stoichio￾metric amounts and none of its atoms are incorporated into the desired product. Moreover, the toxicity of chromium compounds 
introduces significant hazardous-waste disposal problems.
On the other hand, oxidation according to the equation:

Alcohol Sodium

Aldehyde Sodium

offers a more sustainable alternative in that it avoids toxicity problems (aqueous sodium hypochlorite is nothing more than household 
bleach), and the byproducts (water and sodium chloride) are benign. In practice, however, the reaction was not widely used until it 
was found that it could be catalyzed by the free-radical compound 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO). The active catalyst 
is an oxoammonium cation formed by hypochlorite oxidation of TEMPO under the reaction conditions.

TEMPO-catalyzed oxidations are replacing more familiar oxidation methods, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. An early

Isopropylbenzene is made from benzene and propene, both of which are readily available petrochemicals, O2 is the ultimate green

On an even larger scale, all of the polymers listed in Table 10.2 and most of them in Chapter 27 are prepared by reactions that 
are efficient, use catalysts, produce minimum waste, and incorporate all of the atoms in the reactant into the product.658 Chapter 16 Alcohols, Diols, and Thiols
16.10 Biological Oxidation of Alcohols
Many biological processes involve oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds or the 
reverse process, reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols. Ethanol, for example, is 
metabolized in the liver to acetaldehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol 
dehydrogenase.
CH3CH
O

In addition to enzymes, biological oxidations require substances known as coenzymes.
Coenzymes are organic molecules that, in concert with an enzyme, act on a substrate to 
bring about chemical change. Most vitamins are coenzymes. A coenzyme contains a 
functional group that is complementary to a functional group of the substrate; the enzyme 
catalyzes the interaction of these mutually complementary functional groups. If ethanol 
is oxidized, some other substance must be reduced. This other substance is the oxidized 
form of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). By representing the 
oxidized form as NAD+ and the reduced form as NADH, the chemical equation for the 
biological oxidation of ethanol may be written:

The structure of the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is shown in 
Figure 16.2. The only portion of the coenzyme that undergoes chemical change in the 
reaction is the substituted pyridine ring of the nicotinamide unit (framed in red in 
Figure 16.2). Representing the remainder of the coenzyme molecule by R, we track the

The key feature here is that hydrogen is transferred from ethanol to NAD+ not as a 
proton (H+), but as hydride (:H−). The ability of ethanol to transfer hydride is enhanced 
by removal of the OH proton by a basic site of the enzyme. Hydride is never free, but 
is transferred directly from ethanol to the positively charged pyridinium ring of NAD+
to give NADH.

The mechanism of enzymatic oxidation has been studied by isotopic labeling with the aid of

The reverse reaction also occurs in living systems; NADH reduces acetaldehyde to 
ethanol in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase. In this process, NADH serves as a 
hydride donor and is oxidized to NAD+ while acetaldehyde is reduced.
The NAD+–NADH coenzyme system is involved in a large number of biological 
oxidation–reductions. Another reaction similar to the ethanol–acetaldehyde conversion is the 
oxidation of lactic acid to pyruvic acid by NAD+
 and the enzyme lactic acid dehydrogenase:

A reaction characteristic of vicinal diols is their oxidative cleavage on treatment with

Periodic acid cleavage of vicinal diols is often used for analytical purposes as an

constitution of the starting diol may be deduced. This technique finds its widest applica￾tion with carbohydrates and will be discussed more fully in Chapter 23.
16.12 Thiols
Sulfur lies just below oxygen in the periodic table, and many oxygen-containing organic 
compounds have sulfur analogs. The sulfur analogs of alcohols (ROH) are thiols (RSH).
Thiols are given substitutive IUPAC names by appending the suffix -thiol to the name 
of the corresponding alkane, numbering the chain in the direction that gives the lower 
locant to the carbon that bears the SH group. As with diols (Section 16.5), the final 
-e of the alkane name is retained. When the SH group is named as a substituent, it is 
called a mercapto, or sulfanyl, group. It is also often referred to as a sulfhydryl group, 
but this is a generic term, not used in systematic nomenclature.

At one time thiols were named mercaptans. Thus, CH3CH2SH was called “ethyl 
mercaptan” according to this system. This nomenclature was abandoned beginning with 
the 1965 revision of the IUPAC rules but is still sometimes encountered.
Thiols have a marked tendency to 
bond to mercury, and the word 
mercaptan comes from the Latin 
mercurium captans, which means 
“seizing mercury.” The drug 
dimercaprol is used to treat mercury 
and lead poisoning; it is 2,3-disulfanyl￾1-propanol.16.12  Thiols 661
The most obvious property of a low-molecular-weight thiol is its foul odor. Ethanethiol 
is added to natural gas so that leaks can be detected without special equipment—your 
nose is so sensitive that it can detect less than one part of ethanethiol in 10,000,000,000 
parts of air! The odor of thiols weakens with the number of carbons, because both the 
volatility and the sulfur content decrease. 1-Dodecanethiol, for example, has only a faint 
odor. On the positive side, of the hundreds of substances that contribute to the aroma of 
freshly brewed coffee, the one most responsible for its characteristic odor is the thiol 
2-(mercaptomethyl)furan. Likewise, the contribution of p-1-menthene-8-thiol to the taste 
and odor of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice far exceeds that of most of the more than 
260 other volatile components so far identified.

Problem 16.14
Two major components of a skunk’s scent fluid are 3-methyl-1-butanethiol and trans-2-butene￾1-thiol. Write structural formulas for each of these compounds.
The SH bond is less polar than the OH bond, as is evident in the electrostatic 
potential maps of Figure 16.3. The decreased polarity of the SH bond, especially the 
decreased positive character of the proton, causes hydrogen bonding to be absent in 
thiols. Thus, methanethiol (CH3SH) is a gas at room temperature (bp 6°C), whereas 
methanol (CH3OH) is a liquid (bp 65°C).
In spite of SH bonds being less polar than OH bonds, thiols are stronger acids 
than alcohols. This is largely because SH bonds are weaker than OH bonds. We 
have seen that most alcohols have pKas of 16–18. The corresponding value for a thiol is 
about 11. The significance of this difference is that a thiol can be quantitatively converted 
to its conjugate base (RS−), called an alkanethiolate, by hydroxide. Consequently, thiols 
dissolve in aqueous base.

A major difference between alcohols and thiols concerns their oxidation. We have 
seen earlier in this chapter that oxidation of alcohols produces carbonyl compounds. 
Analogous oxidation of thiols to compounds with CS functions does not occur. Only 
sulfur is oxidized, not carbon, and compounds containing sulfur in various oxidation 
states are possible. These include a series of acids classified as sulfenic, sulfinic, and 
sulfonic according to the number of oxygens attached to sulfur.

Of these the most important are the sulfonic acids. In general though, sulfonic acids are 
not prepared by oxidation of thiols. Benzenesulfonic acid (C6H5SO2OH), for example, is 
prepared by sulfonation of benzene (see Section 13.4).
From a biochemical perspective the most important oxidation is the conversion of 
thiols to disulfides.

Although a variety of oxidizing agents are available for this transformation, it occurs so 
readily that thiols are slowly converted to disulfides by the oxygen in air. Dithiols give 
cyclic disulfides by intramolecular sulfur–sulfur bond formation. An example of a cyclic 
disulfide is the coenzyme α-lipoic acid. The last step in the laboratory synthesis of 
α-lipoic acid is an iron(III)-catalyzed oxidation of the dithiol shown:

Rapid and reversible making and breaking of the sulfur–sulfur bond is essential to the 
biological function of α-lipoic acid.
The SS bonds in disulfides are intermediate in strength between typical covalent 
bonds and weaker interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Covalent bonds involving C, H, N, 
and O have bond strengths on the order of 330–420 kJ/mol (79–100 kcal/mol). The SS 
bond energy is about 220 kJ/mol (53 kcal/mol), and hydrogen bond strengths are usually 
less than 30 kJ/mol (7 kcal/mol). Thus, SS bonds provide more structural stability than 
a hydrogen bond, but can be broken while leaving the covalent framework intact.
All mammalian cells contain a thiol called glutathione, which protects the cell by 
scavenging harmful oxidants. It reacts with these oxidants by forming a disulfide, which 
is eventually converted back to glutathione.

The three-dimensional shapes of many proteins are governed and stabilized by

16.13 Spectroscopic Analysis of Alcohols and Thiols
Infrared: We discussed the most characteristic features of the infrared spectra of alco￾hols earlier (Section 14.22). The OH stretching vibration is especially easy to identify, 
appearing in the 3200–3650 cm−1 region. As the infrared spectrum of cyclohexanol, 
presented in Figure 16.4, demonstrates, this peak is seen as a broad absorption of 664 Chapter 16 Alcohols, Diols, and Thiols
moderate intensity. The CO bond stretching of alcohols gives rise to a moderate to 
strong absorbance between 1025 and 1200 cm−1. It appears at 1065 cm−1 in cyclo￾hexanol, a typical secondary alcohol, but is shifted to slightly higher energy in tertiary 
alcohols and slightly lower energy in primary alcohols.
The SH stretching frequency of thiols gives rise to a weak band in the range 
2550–2700 cm−1.
1
H NMR: The most helpful signals in the 1
H NMR spectrum of alcohols result from 
the OH proton and the proton in the HCO unit of primary and secondary alcohols.
δ 3.3–4.0 δ 0.5–5
H C O H
The chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton signal is variable, depending on solvent, 
temperature, and concentration. Its precise position is not particularly significant in struc￾ture determination. Often the signals due to hydroxyl protons are not split by other 
protons in the molecule and are fairly easy to identify. To illustrate, Figure 16.5 shows 
the 1
H NMR spectrum of 2-phenylethanol, in which the hydroxyl proton signal appears 
as a singlet at δ 2.2. Of the two triplets in this spectrum, the one at lower field (δ 3.8) 
corresponds to the protons of the CH2O unit. The higher-field triplet at δ 2.8 arises from 
the benzylic CH2 group. The assignment of a particular signal to the hydroxyl proton 
can be confirmed by adding D2O. The hydroxyl proton is replaced by deuterium, and its 
1
H NMR signal disappears.
Because of its lower electronegativity, sulfur deshields neighboring protons less 
than oxygen does. Thus, the protons of a CH2S group appear at higher field than those 
of a CH2OH group.

13C NMR: The electronegative oxygen of an alcohol decreases the shielding of the 
carbon to which it is attached. The chemical shift for the carbon of the COH is 60–75 ppm 
for most alcohols. Carbon of a CS group is more shielded than carbon of CO.

Mass Spectrometry: The molecular ion peak is usually quite small in the mass spec￾trum of an alcohol. A peak corresponding to loss of water is often evident. Alcohols also 
fragment readily by a pathway in which the molecular ion loses an alkyl group from the 
hydroxyl-bearing carbon to form a stable cation. Thus, the mass spectra of most primary 
alcohols exhibit a prominent peak at m/z 31.

Interpreting the mass spectra of sulfur compounds is aided by the observation of 
an M + 2 peak because of the presence of the mass-34 isotope of sulfur. The major cleavage

16.14 Summary 667668 Chapter 16 Alcohols, Diols, and Thiols
Section 16.12 Thiols are compounds of the type RSH. They are more acidic than alcohols 
and are readily deprotonated by reaction with aqueous base. Thiols can be 
oxidized to sulfenic acids (RSOH), sulfinic acids (RSO2H), and sulfonic acids 
(RSO3H). The redox relationship between thiols and disulfides is important in 
certain biochemical processes.

Section 16.13 The hydroxyl group of an alcohol has its O—H and C—O stretching vibrations 
at 3200–3650 and 1025–1200 cm−1, respectively.
The chemical shift of the proton of an O—H group is variable (δ 1–5) 
and depends on concentration, temperature, and solvent. Oxygen deshields both 
the proton and the carbon of an H—C—O unit. Typical NMR chemical shifts 
are δ 3.3–4.0 for 1
H and δ 60–75 for 13C of H—C—O.
The most intense peaks in the mass spectrum of an alcohol correspond to 
the ion formed according to carbon–carbon cleavage of the type shown:

Ethers, Epoxides, and Sulfides
In contrast to alcohols with their rich chemical reactivity, ethers
(compounds containing a COC unit) undergo relatively 
few chemical reactions. As you saw when we discussed Grignard 
reagents in Chapter 15 and lithium aluminum hydride reduc￾tions in Chapter 16, this lack of reactivity of ethers makes them 
valuable as solvents in a number of synthetically important 
transformations. In the present chapter you will learn of the 
conditions in which an ether linkage acts as a functional group, 
as well as the methods by which ethers are prepared.
Unlike most ethers, epoxides (compounds in which the 
COC unit forms a three-membered ring) are very reactive 
substances. The principles of nucleophilic substitution are impor￾tant in understanding the preparation and properties of epoxides.
Sulfides (RSR′) are the sulfur analogs of ethers. Just as 
in Chapter 16, where we saw that the properties of thiols (RSH) 
are different from those of alcohols, we will explore differences 
between sulfides and ethers in this chapter.
17.1 Nomenclature of Ethers, 
Epoxides, and Sulfides
Ethers are named, in substitutive IUPAC nomenclature, as alkoxy
derivatives of alkanes. Functional class IUPAC names of ethers 
are derived by listing the two alkyl groups in the general structure 
Intestinal parasites in cattle are controlled by adding monensin to their feed. 
Monensin belongs to a class of antibiotics known as ionophores (“ion carriers”) 
that act by forming stable complexes of the kind shown in the space-filling 
model with metal ions. For more, see the boxed essay Polyether Antibiotics.

Ethers are described as symmetrical or unsymmetrical depending on whether the two 
groups bonded to oxygen are the same or different. Diethyl ether is a symmetrical ether; 
ethyl methyl ether is an unsymmetrical ether.
Cyclic ethers have their oxygen as part of a ring—they are heterocyclic compounds
(Section 3.15). Several have specific IUPAC names.

In each case the ring is numbered starting at the oxygen. The IUPAC rules also permit 
oxirane (without substituents) to be called ethylene oxide. Tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydro￾pyran are acceptable synonyms for oxolane and oxane, respectively.
Problem 17.1
Each of the following ethers has been shown to be or is suspected to be a mutagen, which 
means it can induce mutations in test cells. Write the structure of each of these ethers.
(a) Chloromethyl methyl ether
(b) 2-(Chloromethyl)oxirane (also known as epichlorohydrin)
(c) 3,4-Epoxy-1-butene (2-vinyloxirane)
Sample Solution (a) Chloromethyl methyl ether has a chloromethyl group (ClCH2) and a 
methyl group (H3C) attached to oxygen. Its structure is ClCH2OCH3.
Many substances have more than one ether linkage. Two such compounds, often 
used as solvents, are the diethers 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 1,4-dioxane. Diglyme, also a 
commonly used solvent, is a triether.

Molecules that contain several ether functions are referred to as polyethers. Polyethers 
have some novel properties and will appear in Section 17.4.
The sulfur analogs (RS) of alkoxy groups are called alkylthio groups. The first 
two of the following examples illustrate the use of alkylthio prefixes in substitutive 
nomenclature of sulfides. Functional class IUPAC names of sulfides are derived in 
exactly the same way as those of ethers but end in the word sulfide. Sulfur heterocycles 
have names analogous to their oxygen relatives, except that ox- is replaced by thi-. Thus, 
the sulfur heterocycles containing three-, four-, five-, and six-membered rings are named 
thiirane, thietane, thiolane, and thiane, respectively.

Recall from Section 8.11 that epoxides 
may be named as epoxy derivatives of 
alkanes in substitutive IUPAC 
nomenclature.
Sulfides are sometimes informally 
referred to as thioethers, but this term 
is not part of systematic IUPAC 
nomenclature.

17.2 Structure and Bonding in Ethers and Epoxides
Bonding in ethers is readily understood by comparing ethers with water and alcohols. 
Van der Waals strain involving alkyl groups causes the bond angle at oxygen to be larger 
in ethers than in alcohols, and larger in alcohols than in water. An extreme example is 
di-tert-butyl ether, where steric hindrance between the tert-butyl groups is responsible 
for a dramatic increase in the COC bond angle.

Typical carbon–oxygen bond distances in ethers are similar to those of alcohols 
(≈  142 pm, 1.42 Å) and are shorter than carbon–carbon bond distances in alkanes 
(≈ 153 pm, 1.53 Å).
An ether oxygen affects the conformation of a molecule in much the same way that 
a CH2 unit does. The most stable conformation of diethyl ether is the all-staggered anti 
conformation. Tetrahydropyran is most stable in the chair conformation—a fact that has 
an important bearing on the structures of countless carbohydrates.
Anti conformation of diethyl ether Chair conformation of tetrahydropyran
Incorporating an oxygen atom into a three-membered ring requires its bond angle 
to be seriously distorted from the normal tetrahedral value. In ethylene oxide, for exam￾ple, the bond angle at oxygen is 61.5°.

Thus, epoxides, like cyclopropanes, have significant angle strain. They tend to undergo 
reactions that open the three-membered ring by cleaving one of the carbon–oxygen bonds.
Problem 17.2
The heats of combustion of 1,2-epoxybutane (2-ethyloxirane) and tetrahydrofuran have been 
measured: one is 2499 kJ/mol; the other is 2546 kJ/mol. Match the heats of combustion with 
the respective compounds.
17.3 Physical Properties of Ethers
Table 17.1 compares the physical properties of diethyl ether to those of an alkane (pen￾tane) and an alcohol (1-butanol) of similar size and shape. With respect to boiling point, 
diethyl ether resembles pentane more than 1-butanol. With respect to dipole moment and 
solubility in water, the reverse is true.
As we have seen before, alcohols have unusually high boiling points because of 
hydrogen bonding between OH groups.

Lacking OH groups, ethers resemble alkanes in that dispersion forces are the major 
contributors to intermolecular attractions. Although ethers have significant dipole 
moments, the fact that their boiling points are closer to alkanes than to alcohols tells us 
that dipole–dipole attractive forces are minor contributors.
On the other hand, ethers have a negatively polarized oxygen that can hydrogen 
bond to an OH proton of water.

Such hydrogen bonding causes ethers to dissolve in water to approximately the same

the hydrogen-bonded complex formed between them.

Problem 17.3
Of the two compounds cyclopentane and tetrahydrofuran, one has a boiling point of 49°C 
and is insoluble in water; the other has a boiling point of 65°C and is miscible with water in 
all proportions. Match the properties to the appropriate compound. In which property of 
which compound is hydrogen bonding important? Sketch the hydrogen-bonding interaction.
17.4 Crown Ethers
Their polar carbon–oxygen bonds and the presence of unshared electron pairs at oxygen

The strength of this bonding depends on the kind of ether. Simple ethers form relatively 
weak complexes with metal ions, but Charles J. Pedersen of DuPont discovered that certain 
polyethers form much more stable complexes with metal ions than do simple ethers.
Pedersen prepared a series of macrocyclic polyethers, cyclic compounds containing four 
or more oxygens in a ring of 12 or more atoms and called these compounds crown ethers,
because their molecular models resemble crowns. Their nomenclature is somewhat cumber￾some, so Pedersen devised a shorthand description whereby the word crown is preceded by 
the total number of atoms in the ring and is followed by the number of oxygen atoms.

12-Crown-4 and 18-crown-6 are a cyclic tetramer and hexamer, respectively, of repeating 
OCH2CH2 units; they are polyethers based on ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH) as 
the parent alcohol.
Problem 17.4
What organic compound mentioned earlier in this chapter is a cyclic dimer of OCH2CH2
units?
The metal–ion complexing properties of crown ethers are evident in their effects 
on the solubility and reactivity of ionic compounds in nonpolar media. Potassium fluo￾ride (KF) is ionic and practically insoluble in benzene alone, but dissolves in it when 
18-crown-6 is present. This happens because of the electron distribution of 18-crown-6 
as shown in Figure 17.2a. The electrostatic potential surface consists of essentially two 
regions: an electron-rich interior associated with the oxygens and a hydrocarbon-like 
exterior associated with the CH2 groups. When KF is added to a solution of 18-crown-6 
in benzene, potassium ion (K+) interacts with the oxygens of the crown ether to form 
a Lewis acid/Lewis base complex. As can be seen in the space-filling model of this 
complex (Figure 17.2b), K+, with a diameter of 266 pm (2.66 Å), fits comfortably within 
the 260–320 pm (2.60–3.20 Å) internal cavity of 18-crown-6. Nonpolar CH2 groups 
dominate the outer surface of the complex, mask its polar interior, and permit the

a fluoride ion with it, resulting in a solution containing strongly complexed potassium 
ions and relatively unsolvated fluoride ions.

In solvents such as water and alcohols, fluoride ion is strongly solvated by ion– 
dipole forces and is neither very basic nor very nucleophilic. On the other hand, the 
poorly solvated, or “naked,” fluoride ions that are present when potassium fluoride dis￾solves in benzene in the presence of a crown ether are better able to express their anionic 
reactivity. Thus, alkyl halides react with potassium fluoride in benzene containing 
18-crown-6, thereby providing a method for the preparation of otherwise difficultly 
accessible alkyl fluorides. No reaction is observed in the absence of the crown ether.

Catalysis by crown ethers has been used to advantage to increase the rate of many 
organic reactions that involve anions as reactants. Just as important, though, is the 
increased understanding that studies of crown ether catalysis have brought to our knowl￾edge of biological processes in which metal ions, including Na+ and K+, are transported 
through the nonpolar interiors of cell membranes.
17.5 Preparation of Ethers
Because they are widely used as solvents, many simple dialkyl ethers are commercially 
available. Diethyl ether and dibutyl ether, for example, are prepared by acid-catalyzed 
condensation of the corresponding alcohols, as described earlier in Section 16.7.
OH O + H2O
1-Butanol Dibutyl ether (60%) Water
H2SO4
130°C
In general, this method is limited to the preparation of symmetrical ethers in which both 
alkyl groups are primary.
The reaction proceeds in the direction 
indicated because a CF bond is 
much stronger than a CBr bond.
The mechanism for the formation of 
diethyl ether from ethanol under 
conditions of acid catalysis was shown 
in Mechanism 16.1.

nonpolar solvents such as benzene.

Acid-catalyzed addition of alcohols to alkenes is sometimes used. Billions of 
pounds of tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) have been prepared by the reaction:
+ +
CH3OH H OCH3
2-Methylpropene Methanol tert-Butyl methyl ether
Small amounts of tert-butyl methyl ether increase the octane rating of gasoline, and 
before environmental concerns placed limits on its use, the demand for MTBE exceeded 
the supply.
tert-Butyl methyl ether is often 
referred to as MTBE, standing for the 
incorrect name “methyl tert-butyl 
ether.” Remember, italicized prefixes 
are ignored when alphabetizing, and 
tert-butyl precedes methyl.
One way in which pharmaceutical companies search for new 
drugs is by growing colonies of microorganisms in nutrient 
broths and assaying the substances produced for their biologi￾cal activity. This method has yielded thousands of antibiotic sub￾stances, of which hundreds have been developed into effective 
drugs. Antibiotics are, by definition, toxic (anti = “against”; bios
= “life”), and the goal is to find substances that are more toxic to 
infectious organisms than to their human hosts.
Since 1950, a number of polyether antibiotics have been 
discovered using fermentation technology. They are character￾ized by the presence of several cyclic ether structural units, as 
illustrated for the case of monensin in Figure 17.3a. Monensin 
and other naturally occurring polyethers are similar to crown 
ethers in their ability to form stable complexes with metal ions.

The structure of the sodium salt of monensin is depicted in 
Figures 17.3b and 17.3c, where it can be seen that four ether 
oxygens and two hydroxyl groups surround a sodium ion. The 
alkyl groups are oriented toward the outside of the complex, 
and the polar oxygens and the metal ion are on the inside. The 
hydrocarbon-like surface of the complex permits it to carry its 
sodium ion through the hydrocarbon-like interior of a cell 
membrane. This disrupts the normal balance of sodium ions 
within the cell and interferes with important processes of cel￾lular respiration. Small amounts of monensin are added to ani￾mal feed to kill parasites that live in the intestines of chickens, 
cows, etc. Compounds such as monensin and the crown ethers 
that affect metal ion transport are referred to as ionophores
(“ion carriers”).

(a) Write equations describing two different ways in which benzyl ethyl ether could

Williamson, a British chemist who 
used it to prepare diethyl ether in 
1850.

(b) Write an equation showing the most practical synthesis of allyl phenyl ether by 
the Williamson method.
Secondary and tertiary alkyl halides are not suitable, because they react with alk￾oxide bases by E2 elimination rather than by SN2 substitution. Whether the alkoxide base
is primary, secondary, or tertiary is much less important than the nature of the alkyl 
halide. Thus, benzyl isopropyl ether is prepared in high yield from benzyl chloride, a 
primary chloride that is incapable of undergoing elimination, and sodium isopropoxide:

The alternative synthetic route using the sodium salt of benzyl alcohol and an isopropyl

as the alkyl halide becomes more sterically hindered.

17.7 Reactions of Ethers: A Review and a Preview
Up to this point, we haven’t seen any reactions of dialkyl ethers. Indeed, ethers are one 
of the least reactive of the functional groups we shall study. It is this low level of reactiv￾ity, along with an ability to dissolve nonpolar substances, that makes ethers so often used 
as solvents when carrying out organic reactions. Nevertheless, most ethers are hazardous 
materials, and precautions must be taken when using them. Diethyl ether is extremely 
flammable and because of its high volatility can form explosive mixtures in air relatively 
quickly. Open flames must never be present in laboratories where diethyl ether is being 
used. Other low-molecular-weight ethers must also be treated as fire hazards.
Another dangerous property of ethers is the ease with which they undergo oxidation 
in air to form explosive peroxides. Air oxidation of diisopropyl ether proceeds according 
to the equation
O
+ O2
O
OOH
Diisopropyl ether Oxygen Diisopropyl ether hydroperoxide
The reaction follows a free-radical mechanism and gives a hydroperoxide, a compound 
of the type ROOH. Hydroperoxides are unstable and shock-sensitive and form related 
peroxidic derivatives that are prone to violent decomposition. Air oxidation leads to 
peroxides within a few days if ethers are even briefly exposed to atmospheric oxygen. 
For this reason, one should never use old bottles of dialkyl ethers, and extreme care must 
be exercised in their disposal.688 Chapter 17 Ethers, Epoxides, and Sulfides

A series of dialkyl ethers was allowed to react with excess hydrogen bromide, with the

(a) One ether gave a mixture of bromocyclopentane and 1-bromobutane.
(b) Another ether gave only benzyl bromide.
(c) A third ether gave one mole of 1,5-dibromopentane per mole of ether.
Sample Solution (a) In the reaction of dialkyl ethers with excess hydrogen bromide, 
each alkyl group of the ether function is cleaved and forms an alkyl bromide. Because 
bromocyclopentane and 1-bromobutane are the products, the starting ether must be butyl

17.9 Preparation of Epoxides
There are two main methods for the preparation of epoxides:
1. Epoxidation of alkenes
2. Base-promoted ring closure of vicinal halohydrins

Allylic alcohols are converted to epoxides by oxidation with tert-butyl hydroperoxide 
in the presence of certain transition metals. The most significant aspect of this reaction—
called the Sharpless epoxidation—is its high enantioselectivity when carried out using 
a combination of tert-butyl hydroperoxide, titanium(IV) isopropoxide, and diethyl tartrate.

Oxygen is transferred to the double bond of the allylic alcohol from the hydro￾peroxy group in a chiral environment and occurs enantioselectively.
The value of this reaction was recognized with the award of the 2001 Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry to its creator K. Barry Sharpless. Sharpless epoxidation of allylic alcohols 
can be carried out with catalytic amounts of titanium(IV) isopropoxide and, because both 
enantiomers of diethyl tartrate are readily available, can be applied to the synthesis of 
either enantiomer of a desired epoxy alcohol.
Problem 17.11
What would be the absolute configuration of the 2,3-epoxy-1-hexanol produced in the 
preceding reaction if diethyl (2S,3S)-tartrate were used instead of (2R,3R)?
More than a laboratory synthesis, Sharpless epoxidation has been adapted to the 
large-scale preparation of (+)-disparlure, a sex pheromone used to control gypsy moth 
infestations, and of (R)-glycidol, an intermediate in the synthesis of cardiac drugs known 
as beta-blockers.

The following section describes the preparation of epoxides by the base-promoted 
ring closure of vicinal halohydrins. Because vicinal halohydrins are customarily 
prepared from alkenes (Section 8.10), both methods—epoxidation using peroxy acids 
and ring closure of halohydrins—are based on alkenes as the starting materials for 
preparing epoxides.
17.10 Conversion of Vicinal Halohydrins to Epoxides

17.11 Reactions of Epoxides with Anionic Nucleophiles
The most striking chemical property of epoxides is their far greater reactivity toward 
nucleophilic reagents compared with simple ethers. They react rapidly and exothermically 
with anionic nucleophiles to yield ring-opened products. This enhanced reactivity results 
from the angle strain of epoxides; ring opening relieves that strain.
We saw an example of nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides in Section 16.4, where 
the reaction of Grignard and organolithium reagents with ethylene oxide was presented 
as a synthetic route to primary alcohols:

present. Both kinds of strain are 
relieved when a ring-opening

The reactions of epoxides with anionic nucleophiles have many of the characteristics 
of SN2 reactions. Attack of nucleophiles at carbon occurs on the face opposite the carbon–

17.13 Epoxides in Biological Processes
Many naturally occurring substances are epoxides. In most cases, epoxides are biosyn￾thesized by the enzyme-catalyzed transfer of one of the oxygen atoms of an O2 molecule 
to an alkene. Because only one of the atoms of O2 is transferred to the substrate, the 
enzymes that catalyze such transfers are classified as monooxygenases. A biological 
reducing agent, usually the coenzyme NADH (Section 16.10), is required as well.

A prominent example of such a reaction is the biological epoxidation of the polyene

The reactivity of epoxides toward nucleophilic ring opening is responsible for one

precursor to cholesterol and the steroid hormones, including testosterone, progesterone, 
estrone, and cortisone. The pathway from squalene 2,3-epoxide to these compounds is 
triggered by epoxide ring opening and will be described in Chapter 24.

17.15 Oxidation of Sulfides: Sulfoxides and Sulfones
We saw in Section 16.12 that thiols differ from alcohols with respect to their behavior 
toward oxidation. Similarly, sulfides differ from ethers in their behavior toward oxidizing 
agents. Whereas ethers tend to undergo oxidation at carbon to give hydroperoxides 
(Section 17.7), sulfides are oxidized at sulfur to give sulfoxides. If the oxidizing agent 
is strong enough and present in excess, oxidation can proceed further to give sulfones.

Problem 17.18
Prilosec and Nexium are widely used “proton 
pump” inhibitors for treatment of gastrointestinal 
reflux disease (GERD). Both have the constitution 
shown. Prilosec (omeprazole) is racemic while 
Nexium (esomeprazole) has the S configuration at 
its chirality center. Revise the drawing so that it 
represents Nexium.
Oxidation of sulfides occurs in living systems as well. Among naturally occurring 
sulfoxides, one that has received recent attention is sulforaphane, which is present in 
Third-row elements such as sulfur can 
expand their valence shell beyond 
eight electrons, and so sulfur–oxygen 
bonds in sulfoxides and sulfones can 
be represented as double bonds.

17.16 Alkylation of Sulfides: Sulfonium Salts
Sulfur is more nucleophilic than oxygen (Section 6.5), and sulfides react with alkyl halides 
much faster than do ethers. The products of these reactions are called sulfonium salts.

What other combination of alkyl halide and sulfide will yield the same sulfonium salt shown 
in the preceding example? Predict which combination will yield the sulfonium salt at the 
faster rate.
A naturally occurring sulfonium salt, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), is a key sub￾stance in certain biological processes. It is formed by a nucleophilic substitution in which 
the sulfur atom of methionine attacks the primary carbon of adenosine triphosphate, 
displacing the triphosphate leaving group.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) + Methionine S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM)
S-Adenosylmethionine acts as a biological methyl-transfer agent. Nucleophiles, par￾ticularly amines, attack the methyl carbon of SAM, breaking the carbon–sulfur bond. 
The following equation represents the biological formation of epinephrine by methylation 
of norepinephrine. Only the methyl group and the sulfur of SAM are shown explicitly 
The NCS unit in sulforaphane 
is the isothiocyanate group. 
Isothiocyanates are among the 
ingredients responsible for the 
flavor of wasabi.

indicates that the adenosyl group is 
bonded to sulfur. It does not stand

Epoxides, and Sulfides
The IR, 1
H NMR, and 13C NMR spectra of dipropyl ether, which appear in parts a, b,
and c, respectively of Figure 17.5, illustrate some of the spectroscopic features of ethers.
Infrared: The infrared spectra of ethers are characterized by a strong, rather broad band 
due to antisymmetric COC stretching between 1070 and 1150 cm−1. Dialkyl ethers exhibit 
this band consistently at 1120 cm−1, as shown in the IR spectrum of dipropyl ether.
CH3CH2CH2OCH2CH2CH3
Dipropyl ether
ν = 1118 cm−1 C O C
The analogous band in alkyl aryl ethers (ROAr) appears at 1200–1275 cm−1.
Epoxides typically exhibit three bands. Two bands, one at 810–950 cm−1 and the 
other near 1250 cm−1, correspond to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the ring, 
respectively. The third band appears in the range 750–840 cm–1.

The CSC stretching vibration of sulfides gives a weak peak in the 600–700 cm−1
range. Sulfoxides show a strong peak due to SO stretching at 1030–1070 cm−1. With two 
oxygens attached to sulfur, sulfones exhibit strong bands due to symmetric (1120–1160 cm−1) 
and asymmetric (1290–1350 cm−1) SO stretching.

H NMR: The chemical shift of the proton in the HCOC unit of an ether is very 
similar to that of the proton in the HCOH unit of an alcohol. A range of δ 3.2–4.0 
is typical. The proton in the HCSC unit of a sulfide appears at higher field than 
the corresponding proton of an ether because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen.

CH3CH2CH2 O CH2CH2CH3 CH3CH2CH2 S CH2CH2CH3
2.5
Oxidation of a sulfide to a sulfoxide or sulfone is accompanied by a decrease in shielding 
of the HCSC proton by about 0.3–0.5 ppm for each oxidation.
Epoxides are unusual in that the protons on the ring are more shielded than expected. 
The protons in ethylene oxide, for example, appear at δ 2.5 instead of the δ 3.2–4.0 range 
just cited for dialkyl ethers.17.17 Spectroscopic Analysis of Ethers, Epoxides, and Sulfides 701
13C NMR: The carbons of the COC group in an ether are about 10 ppm less 
shielded than those of an alcohol and appear in the range δ 57–87. The carbons of the 
CSC group in a sulfide are significantly more shielded than those of an ether.

UV-VIS: Simple ethers have their absorption maximum at about 185 nm and are trans￾parent to ultraviolet radiation above about 220 nm.
Mass Spectrometry: Ethers, like alcohols, lose an alkyl radical from their molecular 
ion to give an oxygen-stabilized cation. Thus, m/z 73 and m/z 87 are both more abundant 
than the molecular ion in the mass spectrum of sec-butyl ethyl ether.

There is another oxygen-stabilized cation of m/z 87 capable of being formed by fragmentation 
of the molecular ion in the mass spectrum of sec-butyl ethyl ether. Suggest a reasonable 
structure for this ion.
An analogous fragmentation process occurs in the mass spectra of sulfides. As with other 
sulfur-containing compounds, the presence of sulfur can be inferred by a peak at m/z of M + 2.
Section 17.1 Ethers are compounds that contain a COC linkage. In substitutive IUPAC 
nomenclature, they are named as alkoxy derivatives of alkanes. In functional 
class IUPAC nomenclature, we name each alkyl group as a separate word (in 
alphabetical order) followed by the word ether.

Section 17.4 Ethers form Lewis acid/Lewis base complexes with metal ions. Certain cyclic 
polyethers, called crown ethers, are particularly effective in coordinating with 
Na+ and K+, and salts of these cations can be dissolved in nonpolar solvents 
when crown ethers are present. Under these conditions the rates of many 
reactions that involve anions are accelerated.

Epoxide Rearrangements and the NIH Shift
This passage is about two seemingly unrelated aspects of epoxides:
1. epoxide rearrangements
2. arene oxides
These two topics merge in an important biological transformation in which neither the reactant 
nor the product is an epoxide—the conversion of the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine.

Epoxide rearrangements
In some epoxide ring-opening reactions, CO bond cleavage is accompanied by the development 
of enough carbocation character at carbon (δ+CO) to allow rearrangement to occur. These 
reactions are typically promoted by protonation of the epoxide oxygen or by its coordination to 
Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride (BF3) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3).
O H O BF3 O AlCl3
+ + − − +
As positive charge develops on the ring carbon, one of the groups on the adjacent carbon migrates 
to it. This migration is assisted by electron-pair donation from oxygen. It is likely that all of this 
occurs in the same transition state. Subsequent deprotonation gives an aldehyde or ketone as the 
isolated product.

1,2-Epoxycyclohexa-3,5-diene is formally the
epoxide of benzene and is the parent of the
class of compounds known as arene oxides. 
The most striking thing about arene oxides is their involvement in biological processes. Enzymes 
in the liver oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons to arene oxides, which then react with biological 
nucleophiles to give compounds used in subsequent reactions or to aid elimination of the arene 
oxide from the body. Some arene oxides, especially those from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 
are carcinogenic and react with nitrogen nucleophiles of DNA to induce mutations (Section 12.6).

The NIH shift
Although hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine looks like a typical electrophilic aromatic sub￾stitution, scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Health discovered that the biochemical pathway 
combines epoxidation of the benzene ring followed by epoxide ring opening with rearrangement. 
This rearrangement, which is the biochemical analog of the pinacol-type reactions described earlier, 
is known as the “NIH shift.”

Although the present chapter includes the usual collection of

nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups. The principles of 
nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones developed here 
will be seen to have broad applicability in later chapters when 
transformations of various derivatives of carboxylic acids are 
discussed.

18.1 Nomenclature
The longest continuous chain including the CHO unit, called a formyl group, pro￾vides the parent name for aldehydes. The -e ending of the corresponding alkane name 
is replaced by -al, and substituents are specified in the usual way. It is not necessary to 
specify the location of the formyl group in the name, because the chain must be numbered 
starting with this group as C-1. The suffix -dial is added to the appropriate alkane name 
when the compound contains two aldehyde functions.

alkyl groups in determining the parent name and direction of numbering. Aldehydes 
outrank ketones, however, and a compound that contains both an aldehyde and a ketone 
carbonyl group is named as an aldehyde. In such cases, the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone 
is considered an oxo-substituent on the main chain.

18.2 Structure and Bonding: The Carbonyl Group
Two notable aspects of the carbonyl group are its geometry and polarity. The coplanar 
geometry of the bonds to the carbonyl group is seen in the molecular models of form￾aldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone in Figure 18.1. The bond angles involving the car￾bonyl group are approximately 120°, but vary somewhat from compound to compound 
as shown by the examples in Figure 18.1. The CO bond distance in aldehydes and 
ketones (122 pm, 1.22 Å) is significantly shorter than the typical CO bond distance 
of 141 pm (1.41 Å) seen in alcohols and ethers.
Bonding in formaldehyde can be described according to a valence bond model 
analogous to that of ethylene (Figure 18.2). According to this model, the carbon–oxygen 
double bond is viewed as one of the σ + π type. Overlap of half-filled sp2
 hybrid orbitals 
of carbon and oxygen gives the σ component, whereas side-by-side overlap of half-filled 
2p orbitals gives the π bond. The oxygen lone pairs occupy sp2
 hybrid orbitals, the axes 
of which lie in the plane of the molecule. The carbon–oxygen double bond of formalde￾hyde is both shorter and stronger than the carbon–carbon double bond of ethylene.

The bonds to the carbon of the carbonyl

Molecular orbital (MO) theory for the π bond of the carbonyl group parallels that 
of alkenes except for the energy level of the oxygen 2p orbital (Figure 18.3). Recall from 
Figure 7.2 that the combination of 2p orbitals on two carbon atoms gives two molecular 
orbitals, a HOMO and a LUMO. Oxygen, more electronegative than carbon, has an 
atomic 2p orbital that is smaller and slightly lower in energy than carbon. Oxygen’s 
smaller orbital is observed in formaldehyde’s HOMO and LUMO.
The carbonyl group makes aldehydes and ketones rather polar, with dipole moments 
that are substantially higher than those of alkenes.

π1How much a carbonyl group affects the charge distribution in a molecule is apparent in 
the electrostatic potential maps of 1-butene and propanal (Figure 18.4). The carbonyl 
carbon of propanal is positively polarized and the oxygen is negatively polarized.
The various ways of representing this polarization include
C O
δ+ δ−
or C O and
+ C −
C O O
The structural features, especially the very polar nature of the carbonyl group, point 
clearly to the kind of chemistry we will see for aldehydes and ketones in this chapter. 
The partially positive carbon of CO has carbocation character and is electrophilic. The 
planar arrangement of its bonds make this carbon relatively uncrowded and susceptible 
to attack by nucleophiles. Oxygen is partially negative and weakly basic.
C O electrophiles, especially
protons, bond to oxygen

Alkyl substituents stabilize a carbonyl group in much the same way that they 
stabilize carbon–carbon double bonds and carbocations—by releasing electrons to 
sp2
-hybridized carbon. Thus, as their heats of combustion reveal, the ketone 2-butanone 
is more stable than its aldehyde isomer butanal.

The carbonyl carbon of a ketone bears two electron-releasing alkyl groups; an aldehyde 
carbonyl has only one. Just as a disubstituted double bond in an alkene is more stable 
than a monosubstituted double bond, a ketone carbonyl is more stable than an aldehyde 
carbonyl. We’ll see later in this chapter that structural effects on the relative stability of 
carbonyl groups in aldehydes and ketones are an important factor in their relative 
reactivity.

the electrons of the double bond. The 
charge separation is greater in 
propanal. The carbon of the carbonyl 
group is a site of positive potential. The 
region of highest negative potential is 
near oxygen.

18.3 Physical Properties
In general, aldehydes and ketones have higher boiling points than alkenes because the 
dipole–dipole attractive forces between molecules are stronger. But they have lower 
boiling points than alcohols because, unlike alcohols, two carbonyl groups can’t form 
hydrogen bonds to each other.

18.4 Sources of Aldehydes and Ketones
As we’ll see later in this chapter and the next, aldehydes and ketones are involved in 
many of the most widely used reactions in synthetic organic chemistry. Where do 
aldehydes and ketones themselves come from?
Many occur naturally and arise by the biosynthetic oxidation of alcohols pathway 
outlined in Section 16.10. In terms of both variety and quantity, aldehydes and ketones 
rank among the most common and familiar natural products. Several are shown in 
Figure 18.5.

important of these are the last two: the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and 
secondary alcohols to ketones. Indeed, when combined with reactions that yield alcohols, 
the oxidation methods are so versatile that it will not be necessary to introduce any new 
methods for preparing aldehydes and ketones in this chapter. A few examples will illus￾trate this point.
Let’s first consider how to prepare an aldehyde from a carboxylic acid. There are 
no good methods for going from RCO2H to RCHO directly. Instead, we do it indirectly 
by first reducing the carboxylic acid to the corresponding primary alcohol, then oxidizing 
the primary alcohol to the aldehyde.

Similar processes are used to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde and isopropyl alcohol to acetone.

Excess hydrogen brings about the hydrogenation of the aldehyde and allows the process 
to be adapted to the preparation of primary alcohols. Over 2 × 109
 lb/year of a variety 
of aldehydes and alcohols is prepared in the United States by hydroformylation.
Many aldehydes and ketones are prepared both in industry and in the laboratory by a 
reaction known as the aldol condensation, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 21.
The name aldehyde was invented to 
stand for alcohol dehydrogenatum, 
indicating that aldehydes are related 
to alcohols by loss of hydrogen.

A Review and a Preview
Table 18.2 summarizes the reactions of aldehydes and ketones that you’ve seen in earlier 
chapters. All are valuable tools to the synthetic chemist. Carbonyl groups provide access 
to hydrocarbons by Clemmensen or Wolff–Kishner reduction, and to alcohols by reduction 
or by reaction with Grignard or organolithium reagents.
The most important chemical property of the carbonyl group is its tendency to 
undergo nucleophilic addition reactions of the type represented in the general

The next section explores the mechanism of nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and 
ketones. There we’ll discuss their hydration, a reaction in which water adds to the CO 
group. After we use this reaction to develop some general principles, we’ll survey a 
number of related reactions of synthetic, mechanistic, or biological interest.
18.6 Principles of Nucleophilic Addition: 
Hydration of Aldehydes and Ketones

rapid equilibrium. The product is a geminal diol, also called a “hydrate.”

Overall, the reaction is classified as an addition. Water adds to the carbonyl group. 
Hydrogen becomes bonded to the negatively polarized carbonyl oxygen, hydroxyl to the 
positively polarized carbon.
Table 18.3 compares the equilibrium constants (Khydr) of some simple aldehydes 
and ketones. The position of equilibrium depends on what groups are attached to CO 
and how they affect its steric and electronic environment. Both contribute, but the 
electronic effect controls Khydr more than the steric effect.
The convention for writing equilibrium 
constant expressions without the 
solvent (water in this case) was 
discussed in Section 1.12.

Consider first the electronic effect of alkyl groups versus hydrogen atoms attached 
to CO. Alkyl substituents stabilize a ketone carbonyl more than the hydrogen of an 
aldehyde carbonyl. As with all equilibria, factors that stabilize the reactants decrease the 
equilibrium constant. Thus, in water the extent of hydration increases as the number of 
alkyl groups on the carbonyl decrease.

A striking example of an electronic effect on carbonyl group stability and its rela￾tion to the equilibrium constant for hydration is seen in the case of hexafluoroacetone.

Instead of stabilizing the carbonyl group by electron donation as alkyl substituents do, 
trifluoromethyl groups destabilize it by withdrawing electrons. A less-stabilized carbonyl 
group is associated with a greater equilibrium constant for addition.
Problem 18.6
Chloral is one of the common names for trichloroethanal. Its hydrate has featured prominently 
in countless detective stories as the notorious “Mickey Finn” knockout drops. Write a structural 
formula for chloral hydrate.
Now let’s turn our attention to steric effects by looking at how the size of the groups 
that were attached to CO affect Khydr. The bond angles at carbon shrink from ≈120° to 
≈109.5° as the hybridization changes from sp2
 in the reactant (aldehyde or ketone) to sp3
 in 
the product (hydrate). The increased crowding this produces in the hydrate is better tolerated, 
and Khydr is greater when the groups are small (hydrogen) than when they are large (alkyl).C

Electronic and steric effects operate in the same direction. Both cause the equilibrium 
constants for hydration of aldehydes to be greater than those of ketones.
Effects of Structure on Rate: Electronic and steric effects influence the rate of hydra￾tion in the same way that they affect equilibrium. Indeed, the rate and equilibrium data 
of Table 18.3 parallel each other almost exactly.
Hydration of aldehydes and ketones is a rapid reaction, quickly reaching equilibrium, 
but faster in acid or base than in neutral solution. Thus, instead of a single mechanism for 
hydration, we’ll look at two mechanisms, one for basic and the other for acidic solution.
Mechanism of Base-Catalyzed Hydration: The base-catalyzed mechanism 
(Mechanism 18.1) is a two-step process in which the first step is rate-determining. In step 1, 
the nucleophilic hydroxide ion bonds to the carbon of the carbonyl group. The alkoxide 
ion formed in step 1 abstracts a proton from water in step 2, yielding the geminal diol. 
The second step, like all other proton transfers between oxygen that we have seen, is fast.
The role of the basic catalyst (HO−) is to increase the rate of the nucleophilic addi￾tion step. Hydroxide ion, the nucleophile in the base-catalyzed reaction, is much more 
reactive than a water molecule, the nucleophile in neutral solutions.
Aldehydes react faster than ketones for almost the same reasons that their equilib￾rium constants for hydration are more favorable. The sp2
 → sp3
 hybridization change that 
the carbonyl carbon undergoes on hydration is partially developed in the transition state 
for the rate-determining nucleophilic addition step (Figure 18.6). Alkyl groups at the 
reaction site increase the activation energy by simultaneously lowering the energy of the 
starting state (ketones have a more stabilized carbonyl group than aldehydes) and raising 
the energy of the transition state (a steric crowding effect).
Mechanism of Acid-Catalyzed Hydration: Three steps are involved in acid-catalyzed 
hydration (Mechanism 18.2). The first and last are rapid proton transfers between oxygens. 
The second is a nucleophilic addition and is rate-determining. The acid catalyst activates 
the carbonyl group toward attack by a weakly nucleophilic water molecule. Protonation 
of oxygen makes the carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde or a ketone much more electrophilic. 
Expressed in resonance terms, the protonated carbonyl has a greater degree of carboca￾tion character than an unprotonated carbonyl.

18.6 Principles of Nucleophilic Addition: Hydration of Aldehydes and Ketones 729730 Chapter 18 Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition to the Carbonyl Group
Steric and electronic effects influence the rate of nucleophilic addition to a proton￾ated carbonyl group in much the same way as they do for the case of a neutral one, and 
protonated aldehydes react faster than protonated ketones.
With this as background, let us now examine how the principles of nucleophilic 
addition apply to the characteristic reactions of aldehydes and ketones. We’ll begin with 
the addition of hydrogen cyanide.

18.7 Cyanohydrin Formation 731732 Chapter 18 Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition to the Carbonyl Group
The addition of hydrogen cyanide is catalyzed by cyanide ion, but HCN is too weak 
an acid to provide enough C
− N for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate. Cyano￾hydrins are normally prepared by adding an acid to a solution containing the carbonyl 
compound and sodium or potassium cyanide. This procedure ensures that free cyanide 
ion is always present in amounts sufficient to increase the rate of the reaction.
Cyanohydrin formation is reversible, and the position of equilibrium depends on 
the steric and electronic factors governing nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups 
described in the preceding section.

sodium hydroxide in step 2 in Mechanism 18.3.
Converting aldehydes and ketones to cyanohydrins is of synthetic value because:
1. A new carbon–carbon bond is formed.
2. The CN group can be converted to COH

 (Section 19.12) and CH2NH2
(Section 22.9).
3. The OH group can undergo functional-group transformations.

Cyanohydrins occur naturally, often as derivatives in which the OH group has 
been modified to OR, where R is a carbohydrate unit. These cyanogenic glycosides
are widespread in plants; one, called amygdalin, is found in bitter almonds and in the 
kernels of peaches, plums, apricots, and related fruits.

Cyanogenic compounds are not limited to plants. The defense secretion of many 
species of millipedes contains the products of cyanohydrin dissociation. These millipedes 
(Figure 18.7) store either benzaldehyde cyanohydrin or a derivative of it, plus the enzyme 
that catalyzes its hydrolysis in separate chambers within their bodies. When the millipede 
is under stress, the contents of the two chambers are mixed and the hydrolysis products—
including HCN—are released through the millipede’s pores to deter predatory insects 
and birds.
18.8 Reaction with Alcohols: Acetals and Ketals
Many of the most interesting and useful reactions of aldehydes and ketones involve 
transformation of the initial product of nucleophilic addition to some other substance 
under the reaction conditions. An example is the acid-catalyzed addition of alcohols to 
aldehydes. The expected product, a hemiacetal, is not usually isolable, but reacts with 
an additional mole of the alcohol to give an acetal.

The position of equilibrium is favorable for acetal formation from most aldehydes, 
especially when excess alcohol is present as the reaction solvent. For most ketones the 
position of equilibrium is unfavorable, and other methods must be used for the preparation 
of acetals from ketones.
Compounds that contain both carbonyl and alcohol functional groups are often 
more stable as cyclic hemiacetals or hemiketals than as open-chain structures. An equi￾librium mixture of 4-hydroxybutanal contains 11.4% of the open-chain hydroxy aldehyde 
and 88.6% of the cyclic hemiacetal.

then alkylate it with methyl iodide (Section 9.6). There is a complication, however. The 
carbonyl group in the starting alkyne will neither tolerate the strongly basic conditions 
required for anion formation nor survive in a solution containing carbanions. Acetylide 
ions add to carbonyl groups (Section 15.6). Thus, the necessary anion is inaccessible.738 Chapter 18 Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition to the Carbonyl Group
The strategy that is routinely followed is to protect the carbonyl group during the 
reactions with which it is incompatible and then to remove the protecting group in a 
subsequent step. Acetals and ketals, especially those derived from ethylene glycol, are 
the most commonly used groups for carbonyl protection, because they can be introduced 
and removed readily. They resemble ethers in being inert to many of the reagents, such 
as hydride reducing agents and organometallic compounds, that react readily with carbonyl 
groups. The following sequence is the one that was actually used to bring about the 
desired transformation.

Although protecting and deprotecting the carbonyl group adds two steps to the synthetic 
procedure, both are essential to its success. Functional-group protection is frequently 
encountered in preparative organic chemistry, and considerable attention has been paid 
to the design of effective protecting groups for a variety of functionalities.

18.10 Reaction with Primary Amines: Imines
Like acetal formation, the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with primary amines—
compounds of the type RNH2 and ArNH2—is a two-stage process. Its first stage is 
nucleophilic addition of the amine to the carbonyl group to give a hemiaminal. The second stage is a dehydration and yields an imine as the isolated product. Imines from 
aldehydes are called aldimines, those from ketones are ketimines.

Mechanism 18.5 describes the reaction between benzaldehyde and methylamine 
given in the first example. The first two steps lead to the hemiaminal; the last three show 
its dehydration to the imine. Step 4, the key step in the dehydration phase, is rate￾determining when the reaction is carried out in acid solution. If the solution is too acidic, 
however, protonation of the amine blocks step 1. Therefore, there is some optimum pH, 
usually about 5, at which the reaction rate is a maximum. Too basic a solution reduces 
the rate of step 4; too acidic a solution reduces the rate of step 1.
Imine formation is reversible and can be driven to completion by removing the 
water that forms. Imines revert to the aldehyde or ketone and amine in the presence of 
aqueous acid.

Imines in Biological Chemistry
Many biological processes involve an “association” between 
two species in a step prior to some subsequent transformation. 
This association can take many forms. It can be a weak association 
of the attractive van der Waals type, or a stronger interaction such as 
a hydrogen bond. It can be an electrostatic attraction between a 
positively charged atom of one molecule and a negatively charged 
atom of another. Covalent bond formation between two species of 
complementary chemical reactivity represents an extreme kind of 
association. It often occurs in biological processes in which 
aldehydes or ketones react with amines via imine intermediates.
In a second example, a key step in the chemistry of vision 
is binding of an aldehyde to an enzyme via an imine. An outline 
of the steps involved is presented in Figure 18.8. It starts with 
β-carotene, a pigment that occurs naturally in several fruits and 
vegetables, including carrots. β-Carotene undergoes oxidative 
cleavage in the liver to give an alcohol known as retinol, or vita￾min A. Oxidation of vitamin A, followed by isomerization of one 
of its double bonds, gives the aldehyde 11-cis-retinal. In the eye, 
the aldehyde function of 11-cis-retinal combines with an amino 
group of the protein opsin to form an imine called rhodopsin. 
An example of a biologically important aldehyde is pyri￾doxal phosphate, which is the active form of vitamin B6 and a 
coenzyme for many of the reactions of α-amino acids. In these 
reactions the amino acid binds to the coenzyme by reacting 
with it to form an imine of the kind shown in the equation. 
Reactions then take place at the amino acid portion of the 
imine, modifying the amino acid. In the last step, enzyme-cat￾alyzed hydrolysis cleaves the imine to pyridoxal and the modi￾fied amino acid.
When rhodopsin absorbs a photon of visible light, the cis double 
bond of the retinal unit undergoes a photochemical cis-to-trans 
isomerization, which is attended by a dramatic change in its 
shape and a change in the conformation of rhodopsin. This con￾formational change is translated into a nerve impulse perceived 
by the brain as a visual image. Enzyme-promoted hydrolysis of 
the photochemically isomerized rhodopsin regenerates opsin 
and a molecule of all-trans-retinal. Once all-trans-retinal has 
been enzymatically converted to its 11-cis isomer, it and opsin 
reenter the cycle.

Not all biological reactions of amino acids involving imine intermediates require pyridoxal phosphate. The first step in the

a species having the molecular formula C5H9NO3, which then goes on to produce glutamic acid. Suggest a structure for the 
C5H9NO3 species. (Hint: There are two reasonable possibilities; one is a hemiaminal, the other is not cyclic.)

Oxidation of retinol converts it to
the corresponding aldehyde, retinal.
The double bond at C-11 is isomerized
from the trans to the cis configuration.
11-cis-Retinal is the biologically
active stereoisomer and reacts
with the protein opsin to form
an imine. The covalently bound
complex between 11-cis-retinal
and opsin is called rhodopsin.
Rhodopsin absorbs a photon of
light, causing the cis double-bond at
C-11 to undergo a photochemical
transformation to trans, which
triggers a nerve impulse detected
by the brain as a visual image.
Hydrolysis of the isomerized (inactive)
form of rhodopsin liberates opsin and

negatively charged one is carbon. Most Wittig reagents have three phenyl groups attached

other than phosphorus and carbon are hydrogen, is shown in Figure 18.9. The electron 
distribution is highly polarized in the direction that makes carbon nucleophilic.
Ylides are prepared by a two-step procedure. First, an alkyl halide is treated with 
a phosphine—typically triphenylphosphine—to give a phosphonium salt. The alkyl halide 
can be methyl, primary, or secondary.

Problem 18.22
What is the relationship between the major and minor products of the reaction just 
described? Are they enantiomers or diastereomers?
Enzyme-catalyzed reductions of carbonyl groups are, more often than not, completely 
stereoselective. Pyruvic acid, for example, is converted exclusively to (S)-(+)-lactic acid 
by the lactate dehydrogenase-NADH system (Section 16.10). The enantiomer (R)-(−)-lactic 
acid is not formed.

Pyruvic acid Reduced form

(S)-(+)-Lactic acid Oxidized form
of coenzyme
The enzyme is a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule and binds the coenzyme 
and substrate in such a way that hydride is transferred exclusively to the face of the 
carbonyl group that leads to (S)-(+)-lactic acid. Reduction of pyruvic acid in an achiral 
environment, say with sodium borohydride, also gives lactic acid but as a racemic mixture 
containing equal quantities of the R and S enantiomers.
The enantioselectivity of enzyme-catalyzed reactions can be understood on the basis 
of a relatively simple model. Consider the case of an sp2
-hybridized carbon with prochi￾ral faces as in Figure 18.10a. If structural features on the enzyme are complementary in 
some respect to the groups attached to this carbon, one prochiral face can bind to the 
enzyme better than the other—there will be a preferred geometry of the enzyme–substrate 
complex. The binding forces are the usual ones: electrostatic, van der Waals, and so on. 
If a reaction occurs that converts the sp2
-hybridized carbon to sp3
, there will be a bias 
toward adding the fourth group from a particular direction as shown in Figure 18.10b. As 
Prochirality was the subject of the 
Chapter 4 Descriptive Passage.18.14 Oxidation of Aldehydes 749
a result, an achiral molecule is converted to a single enantiomer of a chiral one. The 
reaction is enantioselective because it occurs preferentially at one prochiral face.

Geminal diols are more easily oxidized than alcohols, which is why special reagents 
such as PCC and PDC (Section 16.9) have been developed for oxidizing primary alcohols 
to aldehydes and no further. PCC and PDC are effective not only because they are sources 
of Cr(VI), but also because they are used in nonaqueous media (dichloromethane). By 
keeping water out of the reaction mixture, the aldehyde is not converted to its hydrate, 
which is the necessary intermediate that leads to the carboxylic acid.
Alcohol oxidation, especially of ethanol, is one of the most common of all biologi￾cal processes. Two key enzymes, both classified as dehydrogenases, are involved. The 
first catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, the second catalyzes the oxidation 
of acetaldehyde to acetic acid.

Acetaldehyde is toxic and responsible for many of the adverse effects attributed to etha￾nol. Too much ethanol produces acetaldehyde faster than it can be oxidized to acetic acid 
and leads to elevated acetaldehyde levels.
18.15 Spectroscopic Analysis of Aldehydes and Ketones
Infrared: Carbonyl groups are among the easiest functional groups to detect by IR 
spectroscopy. The CO stretching vibration of aldehydes and ketones gives rise to strong 
absorption in the region 1710–1750 cm−1, as illustrated for butanal in Figure 18.11. In 
addition to a peak for CO stretching, the CHO group of an aldehyde exhibits two 
weak bands for CH stretching near 2720 and 2820 cm−1.
1
H NMR: Aldehydes are readily identified by the presence of a signal for the hydrogen of 
CHO at δ 9–10. This is a region where very few other protons ever appear. Figure 18.12 
shows the 300-MHz 1
H NMR spectrum of 2-methylpropanal [(CH3)2CHCHO)], where 
the large chemical-shift difference between the aldehyde proton and the other protons in 
the molecule is clearly evident. As seen in the expanded-scale inset, the aldehyde proton 
is a doublet, split by the proton at C-2. Coupling between the protons in HCCHO 
is much smaller than typical vicinal couplings, making the multiplicity of the aldehyde 
peak difficult to see without expanding the scale.
Methyl ketones, such as 2-butanone in Figure 18.13, are characterized by sharp singlets 
near δ 2 for the protons of CH3CO. Similarly, the deshielding effect of the carbonyl causes 
the protons of CH2CO to appear at lower field (2.5) than in a CH2 group of an alkane.
13C NMR: The signal for the carbon of CO in aldehydes and ketones appears at 
very low field, some 190–220 ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane. Figure 18.14 illus￾trates this for 3-heptanone, in which separate signals appear for each of the seven carbons. 
The six sp3
-hybridized carbons appear in the range δ 8–42, and the carbon of the CO 
group is at δ 210. Note, too, that the intensity of the peak for the CO carbon is much 
less than all the others, even though each peak corresponds to a single carbon. This

decreased intensity is a characteristic of pulsed Fourier transform (FT) spectra for carbons 
that don’t have attached hydrogens.
UV-VIS: Aldehydes and ketones have two absorption bands in the ultraviolet region. 
Both involve excitation of an electron to an antibonding π* orbital. In one, called a 
π → π* transition, the electron is one of the π electrons of the CO group. In the other, 
called an n → π* transition, it is one of the oxygen lone-pair electrons. Because the π 
electrons are more strongly held than the lone-pair electrons, the π → π* transition is of 
higher energy and shorter wavelength than the n → π* transition. For simple aldehydes 
and ketones, the π → π* transition is below 200 nm and of little use in structure deter￾mination. The n → π* transition, although weak, is of more diagnostic value.

Mass Spectrometry: Aldehydes and ketones typically give a prominent molecular ion 
peak in their mass spectra. Aldehydes also exhibit an M –1 peak. A major fragmentation 
pathway for both aldehydes and ketones leads to formation of acyl cations (acylium ions) 
by cleavage of an alkyl group from the carbonyl. The most intense peak in the mass 
spectrum of diethyl ketone, for example, is m/z 57, corresponding to loss of ethyl radical 
from the molecular ion.

The chemistry of the carbonyl group is probably the single most important aspect of organic 
chemical reactivity. Classes of compounds that contain the carbonyl group include many derived 
from carboxylic acids (acyl chlorides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides) as well as the two 
related classes discussed in this chapter: aldehydes and ketones.
Section 18.1 The substitutive IUPAC names of aldehydes and ketones are developed by 
identifying the longest continuous chain that contains the carbonyl group and 
replacing the final -e of the corresponding alkane by -al for aldehydes and -one
for ketones. The chain is numbered in the direction that gives the lowest locant 
to the carbon of the carbonyl group.
O
H
3-Methylbutanal
O
3-Methyl-2-butanone
or
3-Methylbutan-2-one
Ketones may also be named using functional class IUPAC nomenclature by 
citing the two groups attached to the carbonyl in alphabetical order followed by 
the word ketone. Thus, 3-methyl-2-butanone (substitutive) becomes isopropyl 
methyl ketone (functional class).
Section 18.2 The carbonyl carbon is sp2
-hybridized, and it and the atoms 
attached to it are coplanar. Aldehydes and ketones are polar 
molecules. Nucleophiles attack CO at carbon (positively 
polarized) and electrophiles, especially protons, attack oxygen 
(negatively polarized).
Section 18.3 Aldehydes and ketones have higher boiling points than hydrocarbons, but have 
lower boiling points than alcohols.
Section 18.4 The numerous reactions that yield aldehydes and ketones discussed in earlier 
chapters and reviewed in Table 18.1 are sufficient for most syntheses.
Sections The characteristic reactions of aldehydes and ketones involve nucleophilic 
addition to the carbonyl group and are summarized in Table 18.5. Reagents of 
the type HY react according to the general equation

The Baeyer–Villiger Oxidation
The oxidation of ketones with peroxy acids is both novel and synthetically useful. An oxygen from 
the peroxy acid is inserted between the ketone carbonyl group and one of its attached carbons to 
give an ester. First described by Adolf von Baeyer and Victor Villiger in 1899, reactions of this 
type are known as Baeyer–Villiger oxidations.

Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids, compounds of the type RCOH

, constitute one 
of the most frequently encountered classes of organic com￾pounds. Countless natural products are carboxylic acids or are 
derived from them. Some carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, 
have been known for centuries. Others, such as the prostaglan￾dins, which are powerful regulators of numerous biological 
processes, remained unknown until relatively recently. Still oth￾ers, aspirin for example, are the products of chemical synthesis. 
The therapeutic effects of aspirin, known for well over a cen￾tury, are now understood to result from aspirin’s ability to 
inhibit the biosynthesis of prostaglandins.

derivatives that includes acyl chlorides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides. Those 
classes of compounds will be discussed in Chapter 20. Together, this chapter and the 
next tell the story of some of the most fundamental structural types and functional-group 
transformations in organic and biological chemistry.
19.1 Carboxylic Acid Nomenclature
It is hard to find a class of compounds in which the common names of its members 
have influenced organic nomenclature more than carboxylic acids. Not only are the 
common names of carboxylic acids themselves widely used, but the names of many 
other compounds are derived from them. Benzene took its name from benzoic acid and 
propane from propionic acid, not the other way around. The name butane comes from 
butyric acid, present in rancid butter. The common names of most aldehydes are 
derived from the common names of carboxylic acids—valeraldehyde from valeric acid, 
for example. Many carboxylic acids are better known by common names than by their 
systematic ones, and the framers of the IUPAC rules have taken a liberal view toward 
accepting these common names as permissible alternatives to the systematic ones. 
Table 19.1 lists both common and systematic names for a number of important car￾boxylic acids.
Systematic names for carboxylic acids are derived by counting the number of carbons 
in the longest continuous chain that includes the carboxyl group and replacing the -e end￾ing of the corresponding alkane by -oic acid. The first four acids in Table 19.1, methanoic 
(1 carbon), ethanoic (2 carbons), pentanoic (5 carbons), and octadecanoic acid (18 carbons), 
illustrate this point. When substituents are present, their locations are identified by number; 
numbering of the carbon chain always begins at the carboxyl group.
Notice that compounds 5 and 6 are named as hydroxy derivatives of carboxylic 
acids, rather than as carboxyl derivatives of alcohols. This parallels what we saw in 
Section 18.1 where an aldehyde or ketone function took precedence over a hydroxyl 
group in defining the main chain. Carboxylic acids take precedence over all the common 
groups we have encountered to this point in respect to defining the main chain.
Double bonds in the main chain are signaled by the ending -enoic acid, and their 
position is designated by a numerical prefix as shown in entries 7 and 8.
When a carboxyl group is attached to a ring, the parent ring is named (retaining 
the final -e) and the suffix -carboxylic acid is added, as shown in entries 9 and 10.
Compounds with two carboxyl groups, as illustrated by entries 11 through 13, are 
distinguished by the suffix -dioic acid or -dicarboxylic acid as appropriate. The final -e in 
the name of the parent alkane is retained.
Problem 19.1
The list of carboxylic acids in Table 19.1 is by no means exhaustive insofar as common names 
are concerned. Many others are known by their common names, a few of which follow. Give 
a systematic IUPAC name for each.

The structural features of the carboxyl group are most apparent in formic acid, which is 
planar, with one of its carbon–oxygen bonds shorter than the other, and with bond angles 
at carbon close to 120°.

This suggests sp2

analogous to that of aldehydes and ketones.
Additionally, sp2
 hybridization of the hydroxyl oxygen allows one of its unshared 
electron pairs to be delocalized by orbital overlap with the π system of the carbonyl 
group (Figure 19.1a). In resonance terms, this electron delocalization is represented as:

Lone-pair donation from the hydroxyl oxygen makes the carbonyl group less electro￾philic than that of an aldehyde or ketone. The electrostatic potential map of formic acid 
(Figure 19.1b) shows the most electron-rich site to be the oxygen of the carbonyl group 
and the most electron-poor one to be, as expected, the OH hydrogen.
Carboxylic acids are fairly polar, and simple ones such as acetic acid, propanoic 
acid, and benzoic acid have dipole moments in the range 1.7–1.9 D.
19.3 Physical Properties
The melting points and boiling points of carboxylic acids are higher than those of hydro￾carbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds of comparable size and shape and 
indicate strong intermolecular attractive forces.

toward the carbonyl oxygen of a second. In a reciprocal fashion, the hydroxyl proton of 
the second carboxyl function interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of the first. The result 
is that the two carboxylic acid molecules are held together by two hydrogen bonds. So 
efficient is this hydrogen bonding that some carboxylic acids exist as hydrogen-bonded 
dimers even in the gas phase. In the pure liquid a mixture of hydrogen-bonded dimers 
and higher aggregates is present.
In aqueous solution, intermolecular association between carboxylic acid molecules 
is replaced by hydrogen bonding to water. The solubility properties of carboxylic acids 
are similar to those of alcohols. Carboxylic acids of four carbon atoms or fewer are 
miscible with water in all proportions.
19.4 Acidity of Carboxylic Acids
Carboxylic acids are the most acidic class of compounds that contain only carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen. With pKa’s of about 5, they are much stronger acids than water 
and alcohols. The case should not be overstated, however. Carboxylic acids are weak 
acids; a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid in water, for example, is only 1.3% ionized.
To understand the greater acidity of carboxylic acids compared with water and 
alcohols, compare the structural changes that accompany the ionization of a representa￾tive alcohol (ethanol) and a representative carboxylic acid (acetic acid).

The large difference in the free energies of ionization of ethanol and acetic acid 
reflects a greater stabilization of acetate ion relative to ethoxide. Ionization of ethanol 
yields an alkoxide ion in which the negative charge is localized on oxygen. Solvation 
forces are the chief means by which ethoxide ion is stabilized. Acetate ion is also stabi￾lized by solvation, but there are two additional mechanisms for dispersing its negative 
charge that are not available to ethoxide:
1. The inductive effect of the carbonyl group. The carbonyl group of acetate ion is 
electron-withdrawing, and by attracting electrons away from the negatively charged 
oxygen, acetate anion is stabilized. This is an inductive effect, arising in the polar￾ization of the electron distribution in the σ bond between the carbonyl carbon and 
the negatively charged oxygen.

The electrostatic potential maps in Figure 19.3 contrast the localized negative charge in 
ethoxide ion with the delocalized charge in acetate.
Measured CO bond distances also reflect the importance of electron delocaliza￾tion in acetate ion. Acetic acid’s bond distances are consistent with a short double bond 
(121 pm; 1.21 Å) and a long single bond (136 pm; 1.36 Å), whereas the two carbon–
oxygen bond distances in acetate are the same (125 pm; 1.25 Å).

Because the electrical properties of a neutral carboxylic acid molecule and a nega￾tively charged carboxylate ion are so different, we need to be aware of which is the major

Beyond its usual application in calculating the pH of buffer solutions, the Henderson– 
Hasselbalch equation can be rearranged to tell us the ratio of concentrations of an acid 
and its conjugate base at a particular pH.
log 
[conjugate base]
______________ [acid] = pH − pKa
[conjugate base]
______________ [acid] = 10(pH−pKa)
For a typical carboxylic acid with pKa = 5, the ratio of the carboxylate ion to the carboxylic 
acid at pH = 7 is:
[conjugate base]
______________ [acid] = 10(7−5) = 102
 = 100
Thus, in a solution buffered at a pH of 7, the carboxylate concentration is 100 times 
greater than the concentration of the undissociated acid.
Notice that this ratio is for a solution at a specified pH, which is not the same as 
the pH that would result from dissolving a weak acid in pure (unbuffered) water. In the 
latter instance, ionization of the weak acid proceeds until equilibrium is established at 
some pH less than 7.
In most biochemical reactions the pH of the medium is close to 7. At this pH, carboxylic 
acids are nearly completely converted to their conjugate bases. Thus, it is common practice in 
biological chemistry to specify the derived carboxylate anion rather than the carboxylic acid 
itself. For example, we say that “glycolysis leads to lactate by way of pyruvate.”
Problem 19.2
(a) Lactic acid has a pKa of 3.9. What is the [lactate]/[lactic acid] ratio at the pH of 
blood (7.4)?
(b) A 0.1 M solution of lactic acid in water has a pH of 2.5. What is the 
[lactate]/[lactic acid] ratio in this solution?
Sample Solution (a) Use the Henderson–Hasselbalch relationship to calculate the ratio of 
the concentration of the conjugate base (lactate) to the acid (lactic acid).
[conjugate base]
______________ [acid] = 10(pH−pKa)
[lactate] _________ [lactic acid] = 10(7.4−3.9) = 103.5 = 3162
19.5 Substituents and Acid Strength
The effect of structure on acidity was introduced in Section 1.13 where we saw that 
electronegative substituents near an ionizable hydrogen increase its acidity. Alkyl groups,
on the other hand, have little effect on the ionization constants of carboxylic acids; the 
Ka values of all acids that have the general formula CnH2n+1CO2H are very similar to one 
another and equal approximately 10−5 (pKa = 5). Table 19.2 gives a few examples.
An electronegative substituent, particularly if it is attached to the α carbon, increases 
the acidity of a carboxylic acid. All the monohaloacetic acids in Table 19.2 are about 
100 times more acidic than acetic acid. Multiple halogen substitution increases the acidity 
even more; trichloroacetic acid is 7000 times more acidic than acetic acid!
The acid-strengthening effect of electronegative atoms or groups is easily seen as 
an inductive effect transmitted through the σ bonds of the molecule. According to this 
model, the σ electrons in the carbon–chlorine bond of chloroacetic acid are drawn toward 
chlorine, leaving carbon with a slight positive charge. Successive polarization of the 
electron distribution in the remaining σ bonds increases the positive character of the

Inductive effects depend on the electronegativity of the substituent and the number

Sample Solution (a) Think of the two compounds as substituted derivatives of acetic acid. 
A tert-butyl group is slightly electron-releasing and has only a modest effect on acidity. The 
compound (CH3)3CCH2CO2H is expected to have an acid strength similar to that of acetic 
acid. A trimethylammonium substituent, on the other hand, is positively charged and is a 
powerful electron-withdrawing substituent. The compound (CH3)3N
+
CH2CO2H is expected to 
be a much stronger acid than (CH3)3CCH2CO2H. The measured ionization constants, shown 
as follows, confirm this prediction.

Closely related to the inductive effect, and operating in the same direction, is the 
field effect. In the field effect the electronegativity of a substituent is communicated, 
not by successive polarization of bonds but through the medium, usually the solvent. A 
substituent in a molecule polarizes surrounding solvent molecules and this polarization 
is transmitted through other solvent molecules to the remote site.
It is a curious fact that substituents affect the entropy of ionization more than they 
do the enthalpy term in the expression 
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
The enthalpy term ΔH° is close to zero for the ionization of most carboxylic acids, 
regardless of their strength. The free energy of ionization ΔG° is dominated by the –TΔS° 
term. Ionization is accompanied by an increase in solvation forces, leading to a decrease 
in the entropy of the system; ΔS° is negative, and –TΔS° is positive. Carboxylate ions 
with substituents capable of dispersing negative charge impose less order on the solvent 
(water), and less entropy is lost in their production.
19.6 Ionization of Substituted Benzoic Acids
A considerable body of data is available on the acidity of substituted benzoic acids. 
Benzoic acid itself is a slightly stronger acid than acetic acid. Its carboxyl group is attached 
to an sp2
-hybridized carbon and ionizes to a greater extent than one that is attached to an 
sp3
-hybridized carbon. Remember, carbon becomes more electron-withdrawing as its 
s character increases.

Table 19.3 lists the ionization constants of some substituted benzoic acids. The 
largest effects are observed when strongly electron-withdrawing substituents are ortho to 
the carboxyl group. An ortho-nitro substituent, for example, increases the acidity of 
benzoic acid 100-fold. Substituent effects are small at positions meta and para to the 
carboxyl group. In those cases the pKa values are clustered in the range 3.5–4.5.

The salts formed on neutralization of carboxylic acids are named by first specifying 
the metal ion and then adding the name of the acid modified by replacing -ic acid by 
-ate. Monocarboxylate salts of diacids are designated by naming both the cation and the 
hydrogen of the CO2H group.

Metal carboxylates are ionic, and when the molecular weight isn’t too high, the sodium 
and potassium salts of carboxylic acids are soluble in water. Carboxylic acids therefore 
may be extracted from ether solutions into aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide.
The solubility behavior of salts of carboxylic acids having 12–18 carbons is unusual 
and can be illustrated by considering sodium stearate (sodium octadecanoate). Stearate 
ion contains two very different structural units—a long nonpolar hydrocarbon chain and 
a polar carboxylate group. The electrostatic potential map of sodium stearate in Figure 19.4 
illustrates how different most of the molecule is from its polar carboxylate end.
Carboxylate groups are hydrophilic (“water-loving”) and tend to confer water solu￾bility on species that contain them. Long hydrocarbon chains are lipophilic (“fat-loving”) 
and tend to associate with other hydrocarbon chains. Sodium stearate is an example of 
an amphiphilic substance; both hydrophilic and lipophilic groups occur within the same 
molecule.
When sodium stearate is placed in water, the hydrophilic carboxylate group encour￾ages the formation of a solution; the lipophilic alkyl chain discourages it. The compromise 
achieved is to form a colloidal dispersion of aggregates called micelles (Figure 19.5). 
Micelles form spontaneously when the carboxylate concentration exceeds a certain 
minimum value called the critical micelle concentration. Each micelle is composed of 
50–100 individual molecules, with the polar carboxylate groups directed toward its out￾side where they experience attractive forces with water and sodium ions. The nonpolar 
hydrocarbon chains are directed toward the interior of the micelle, where individually 
weak but cumulatively significant induced-dipole/induced-dipole forces bind them 
together. Micelles are approximately spherical because a sphere exposes the minimum 
surface for a given volume of material and disrupts the water structure least. Because 
“Hydrophobic” is often used instead 
of “lipophilic.”

Structure and electrostatic potential 
map of sodium stearate.their surfaces are negatively charged, two micelles repel each other rather than clustering 
to form higher aggregates.
The formation of micelles and their properties are responsible for the cleansing 
action of soaps. Water that contains sodium stearate removes grease by enclosing it in 
the hydrocarbon-like interior of the micelles. The grease is washed away with the water, 
not because it dissolves in the water but because it dissolves in the micelles that are 
dispersed in the water. Sodium stearate is an example of a soap; sodium and potassium 
salts of other C12–C18 unbranched carboxylic acids possess similar properties.
Detergents are substances, including soaps, that cleanse by micellar action. A large 
number of synthetic detergents are known. An example is sodium lauryl sulfate 
[CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3Na], which has a long hydrocarbon chain terminating in a polar 
sulfate ion and forms soap-like micelles in water. Detergents are designed to be effective 
in hard water, meaning water containing calcium salts that form insoluble calcium car￾boxylates with soaps. These precipitates rob the soap of its cleansing power and form 
an unpleasant scum. The calcium salts of synthetic detergents such as sodium lauryl 
sulfate, however, are soluble and retain their micelle-forming ability even in hard water.

The first ionization constant of dicarboxylic acids is larger than Ka for mono￾carboxylic analogs. One reason is statistical. There are two potential sites for ionization 
rather than one, making the effective concentration of carboxyl groups twice as large. 
Furthermore, one carboxyl group acts as an electron-withdrawing group to facilitate dis￾sociation of the other. This is particularly noticeable when the two carboxyl groups are 
separated by only a few bonds. Oxalic and malonic acid, for example, are two to three 
orders of magnitude stronger than simple alkyl derivatives of acetic acid. Heptanedioic 
acid, in which the carboxyl groups are well separated from each other, is only slightly 
stronger than acetic acid.
Long-chain carboxylic acids found in 
nature are called fatty acids. They are 
discussed in Sections 24.2 and 24.3.
Oxalic acid is poisonous and occurs 
naturally in a number of plants 
including sorrel and begonia. It is a 
good idea to keep houseplants out of 
the reach of small children, who might 
be tempted to eat the leaves or 
berries.

Through an accident of history, the simplest dicarboxylic acid, carbonic acid, HOCOH
O
, 
is not even classified as an organic compound. Because many minerals are carbonate 
salts, nineteenth-century chemists placed carbonates, bicarbonates, and carbon dioxide in 
the inorganic realm. Nevertheless, the essential features of carbonic acid and its salts are 
easily understood on the basis of our knowledge of carboxylic acids.
Carbonic acid is formed when carbon dioxide reacts with water. Hydration of carbon 
dioxide is far from complete, however. Almost all the carbon dioxide that is dissolved 
in water exists as carbon dioxide; only 0.3% of it is converted to carbonic acid. Carbonic 
acid is a weak acid and ionizes to a small extent to bicarbonate ion.

The equilibrium constant for the overall reaction is related to an apparent equilibrium 
constant K1 for carbonic acid ionization by the expression
K1 = [H3O+][HCO3
−] _____________ [CO2]
 = 4.3 × 10−7 pK1 = 6.4
Problem 19.6
The value cited for K1 of carbonic acid, 4.3 × 10−7, is determined by measuring the pH of water 
to which a known amount of carbon dioxide has been added. When we recall that only 0.3% of 
carbon dioxide is converted to carbonic acid in water, what is the “true K1” of carbonic acid?
Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide to 
bicarbonate. The uncatalyzed hydration of carbon dioxide is too slow to be effective in 
transporting carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs, and so animals have developed 
catalysts to speed this process. The activity of carbonic anhydrase is remarkable; it has 
been estimated that one molecule of this enzyme can catalyze the hydration of 3.6 × 107
molecules of carbon dioxide per minute.
As with other dicarboxylic acids, the second ionization constant of carbonic acid 
is far smaller than the first.

19.10 Sources of Carboxylic Acids
Many carboxylic acids were first isolated from natural sources and were given common 
names based on their origin (Figure 19.6). Formic acid (Latin formica, meaning “ant”) 
was obtained by distilling ants, but is found in some other insects as well. Since ancient 
times acetic acid (Latin acetum, for “vinegar”) has been known to be present in wine 
that has turned sour. Butyric acid (Latin butyrum, meaning “butter”) contributes to the 
odor of both rancid butter and ginkgo berries. Malic acid (Latin malum, meaning “apple”) 
occurs in apples. Oleic acid (Latin oleum, “oil”) takes its name from naturally occurring 
esters such as those that comprise the major portion of olive oil.
The large-scale preparation of carboxylic acids relies on chemical synthesis. Virtually 
none of the 3 × 109
 lb of acetic acid produced in the United States each year is obtained 
from vinegar. Most of it comes from the reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide.

dead ants is a chemical signal to other ants to carry
them from the nest. In an experiment in which live
ants had been coated with oleic acid, they were also
removed.
Ants aren’t the only insects that use
formic acid as a weapon. Some Galerita
beetles spray attackers with an 80%
solution of it.

many fruits and vegetables.

The carboxylic acid produced in the greatest amounts is 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic 
acid (terephthalic acid). About 5 × 109
 lb/year is produced in the United States as a 
starting material for the preparation of polyester fibers, “PETE” beverage containers, and 
Mylar film. One important process converts p-xylene to terephthalic acid by oxidation

The most apparent chemical property of carboxylic acids, their acidity, has already been 
examined. Three reactions of carboxylic acids—conversion to acyl chlorides, reduction, and 
esterification—have been encountered in previous chapters and are reviewed in Table 19.5. 
Acid-catalyzed esterification of carboxylic acids is one of the fundamental reactions of 
organic chemistry, and this portion of the chapter begins with an examination of the mech￾anism by which it occurs.

19.14 Mechanism of Acid-Catalyzed Esterification
An important question about the mechanism of acid-catalyzed esterification concerns the 
origin of the alkoxy oxygen. For example, does the methoxy oxygen in methyl benzoate 
come from methanol, or is it derived from benzoic acid?
COCH3
O Is this the oxygen originally present
in benzoic acid, or is it the
oxygen of methanol?
A clear-cut answer was provided by Irving Roberts and Harold C. Urey of Columbia 
University in 1938. They prepared methanol that had been enriched in the mass-18 isotope 
of oxygen and found that when this sample of methanol was esterified with benzoic acid, 
the methyl benzoate product contained all the 18O label that was originally present in the 
alcohol.

The Roberts–Urey experiment tells us that the CO bond of the alcohol is pre￾served during esterification. The oxygen that is lost as a water molecule must come from 
the carboxylic acid.
Mechanism 19.1 is consistent with these facts. The six steps are best viewed as a 
combination of two distinct stages. Formation of a tetrahedral intermediate characterizes 
Urey’s achievements in chemistry 
were many and include the discovery 
of deuterium for which he was 
awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry.
In this equation, the red O signifies 
oxygen enriched in its mass-18 
isotope; analysis of isotopic 
enrichment was performed by 
mass spectrometry.

THE MECHANISM:
Step 1: The carboxylic acid is protonated on its carbonyl oxygen. The proton

The species connecting the two stages is called a tetrahedral intermediate because 
the hybridization at carbon has changed from sp2
 in the carboxylic acid to sp3
 in the 
intermediate before returning to sp2
 in the ester product. The tetrahedral intermediate is 
formed by nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to a carboxylic acid and is analogous to 
a hemiacetal formed by nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to an aldehyde or a ketone. 
The three steps that lead to the tetrahedral intermediate in the first stage of esterification 
are analogous to those in the mechanism for acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of an 
alcohol to an aldehyde or a ketone (see Section 18.8). The tetrahedral intermediate is 
unstable under the conditions of its formation and undergoes acid-catalyzed dehydration 
to form the ester.
Notice that the oxygen of methanol becomes incorporated into the methyl benzoate 
product according to Mechanism 19.1, as the results of the Roberts–Urey experiment 
require it to be.
Notice, too, that the carbonyl oxygen of the carboxylic acid is protonated in the 
first step and not the hydroxyl oxygen. The species formed by protonation of the carbonyl 
oxygen is more stable because it is stabilized by electron delocalization. The positive 
charge is shared equally by both oxygens.

The positive charge in the hydroxyl-protonated cation cannot be shared by the two oxy￾gens; it is localized on one of them. Because protonation of the carbonyl oxygen gives 
a more stable cation, that cation is formed preferentially.
Problem 19.9
When benzoic acid is allowed to stand in water enriched in 18O, the isotopic label becomes 
incorporated into the benzoic acid. The reaction is catalyzed by acids. Suggest an 
explanation for this observation.
In Chapter 20 the three elements of the mechanism just described will be seen 
again as part of the general theme that unites the chemistry of carboxylic acid derivatives. 
These elements are
1. Activation of the carbonyl group by protonation of the carbonyl oxygen
2. Nucleophilic addition to the protonated carbonyl to form a tetrahedral intermediate
3. Elimination from the tetrahedral intermediate to restore the carbonyl group
This sequence is fundamental to the carbonyl-group chemistry of carboxylic acids, acyl 
chlorides, anhydrides, esters, and amides.19.15 Intramolecular Ester Formation: Lactones 787
19.15 Intramolecular Ester Formation: Lactones
Hydroxy acids, compounds that contain both a hydroxyl and a carboxylic acid function, 
have the capacity to form cyclic esters called lactones. This intramolecular esterification 
takes place spontaneously when the ring that is formed is five- or six-membered. Lactones 
that contain a five-membered cyclic ester are referred to as γ-lactones; their six-membered 
analogs are known as δ-lactones.

Lactones are named by replacing the -oic acid ending of the parent carboxylic acid 
by -olide and identifying its oxygenated carbon by number as illustrated in the preceding 
equations.

lactones instead if a five- or six-membered ring can be formed.

Many natural products are lactones, and it is not unusual to find examples in which 
the ring size is rather large. A few naturally occurring lactones are shown in Figure 19.7. 
The macrolide antibiotics, of which erythromycin is a prominent example, are macrocyclic 
(large-ring) lactones. The lactone ring of erythromycin is 14-membered.

Lactones with three- or four-membered rings (α-lactones and β-lactones) are very 
reactive, making their isolation difficult. Special methods are normally required for the 
laboratory synthesis of small-ring lactones as well as those that contain rings larger than 
six-membered.788 Chapter 19 Carboxylic Acids

Decarboxylation of derivatives of malonic acid and β-keto acids is the last step in two 
standard synthetic methods—the malonic ester synthesis and the acetoacetic ester synthesis—
each of which is described in Chapter 21. They also find parallels in certain biochemical 
reactions. An example of biological decarboxylation is described in the following boxed essay.
Enzymatic Decarboxylation of a β-Keto Acid
I
n the nineteenth and early twentieth century, simple organic solvents were prepared by fermentation. One of the first industrial￾scale processes used the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum to produce acetone and butanol. This strain of 
bacterium was discovered by the chemist Chaim Weizmann, whose work in acetone production during World War I indirectly led him 
to become the first president of Israel. The final step in acetone production is decarboxylation of acetoacetate catalyzed by the 
enzyme acetoacetate decarboxylase.

Since the carboxylic acid is not protonated in neutral aqueous solution (pKa ≈ 3.6), the enzymatic reaction was unlikely to mirror the 
chemical reaction involving a proton transfer from the carboxylic acid to the β-carbonyl. A series of elegant experiments by Frank 
Westheimer of Harvard University showed that the enzymatic reaction proceeds through an iminium ion intermediate, formed 
between the ketone of the substrate and an amino group of a lysine residue in the protein (Enz), which lowers the energy of the 
decarboxylation reaction. Proton transfer from a proton donor (HA) near the active site to the enamine gives another iminium ion 
intermediate that undergoes hydrolysis to release the desired product, acetone.

Fermentation remained an important method for producing acetone until the late 1950s, when solvent production by the petrochemical 
industry became more economical. Advances in generic engineering and increasing desire to reduce the use of petroleum products are 
leading to a resurgence of interest in the use of fermentation to produce solvents, biofuels, and industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals.19.17 Spectroscopic Analysis of Carboxylic Acids 791
19.17 Spectroscopic Analysis of Carboxylic Acids
Infrared: The most characteristic peaks in the IR spectra of carboxylic acids are those 
of the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. As shown in the IR spectrum of 4-phenylbutanoic 
acid (Figure 19.8), the OH and CH stretching frequencies overlap to produce a broad 
absorption in the 3500–2500 cm−1 region. The carbonyl group gives a strong band for 
CO stretching at 1684 cm−1.
1
H NMR: The hydroxyl proton of a CO2H group is normally the least shielded of all 
the protons in an NMR spectrum, appearing 10–12 ppm downfield from tetramethyl￾silane, often as a broad peak. Figure 19.9 illustrates this for 4-phenylbutanoic acid. As 
with other hydroxyl protons, the proton of a carboxyl group can be identified by adding 
D2O to the sample. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange converts CO2H to CO2D, and 
the signal corresponding to the carboxyl group disappears.
13C NMR: Like other carbonyl groups, the carbon of the CO2H group of a carboxylic 
acid is strongly deshielded (δ 160–185), but not as much as that of an aldehyde or ketone 
(δ 190–215).
UV-VIS: In the absence of any additional chromophores, carboxylic acids absorb at a 
wavelength (210 nm) that is not very useful for diagnostic purposes.
Mass Spectrometry: Aside from a peak for the molecular ion, which is normally easy 
to pick out, aliphatic carboxylic acids undergo a variety of fragmentation processes. The 
dominant fragmentation in aromatic acids corresponds to loss of OH, then loss of CO.

Section 19.4 Carboxylic acids are weak acids and, in the absence of electron-attracting 
substituents, have pKa’s of approximately 5. Carboxylic acids are much stronger 
acids than alcohols because of the electron-withdrawing power of the carbonyl 
group (inductive effect) and its ability to delocalize negative charge in the

Many natural products are lactones, and chemists have directed substantial attention to developing 
alternative methods for their synthesis. The most successful of these efforts are based on 
electrophilic addition to the double bond of unsaturated carboxylic acids. For a generalized 
electrophilic reagent E—Y and 4-pentenoic acid, such reactions give a 5-substituted γ-lactone.

Although the curved arrows show the overall electron flow, the mechanism depends on the 
electrophilic reagent E—Y and normally involves more than one step.
In iodolactonization the electrophilic atom E = I, and E—Y represents a source of 
electrophilic iodine, usually I2 or N-iodosuccinimide. In phenylselenolactonization, E = C6H5Se 
and E—Y is benzeneselenenyl chloride (C6H5SeCl). Anti addition is observed in both iodo- and 
phenylselenolactonization.

Both iodo- and phenylselenolactonization offer the advantage of giving a product containing 
a functional group capable of further modification. Oxidation of the C6H5Se substituent, for

processes. Its mechanism, which constitutes a major portion of 
this chapter, has been thoroughly studied and provides a frame￾work for organizing what might otherwise be a collection of

to the reactions of nitriles and these are included as well.

Acyl Chlorides: Although acyl fluorides, bromides, and iodides are all known classes 
of organic compounds, they are not encountered nearly as often as acyl chlorides. Acyl 
chlorides, which will be the only acyl halides discussed in this chapter, are named by adding 
the word “chloride” after the name of the acyl group. To name an acyl group, replace the 
-ic acid ending of the IUPAC name of the corresponding carboxylic acid by -yl. The suffix 
-carbonyl chloride is used for attachments to rings other than benzene.

20.2 Structure and Reactivity of Carboxylic 
Acid Derivatives
The number of reactions in this chapter is quite large and keeping track of them all can 
be difficult—or it can be manageable. The key to making it manageable is the same as 
always: structure determines properties.
A preview of the reactivity pattern that we will encounter with carboxylic acid 
derivatives compared to the other carbonyl-containing functional groups we have already 
studied, aldehydes and ketones (Chapter 18), is shown in the boxed essay Reaction Trends: 
Aldehydes and Ketones vs. Carboxylic Acid Derivatives. The key difference between car￾boxylic acid derivatives and aldehydes and ketones is that there is a heteroatom directly 
bonded to the carbonyl in carboxylic acid derivatives. This difference in structure is 
responsible for the different outcomes of the reactions of two classes of compounds with 
nucleophiles. The overall process when carboxylic acid derivatives undergo reaction with 
nucleophiles is a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction.
Figure 20.1 shows the structures of various derivatives of acetic acid (acetyl chloride, 
acetic anhydride, ethyl acetate, and acetamide) arranged in order of decreasing reactivity 
toward nucleophilic acyl substitution. Acyl chlorides are the most reactive, amides the 
least reactive. The reactivity order:
acyl chloride > anhydride > ester > amide
is general for nucleophilic acyl substitution and well worth remembering. The range of 
reactivities is quite large; a factor of about 1013 in relative rate separates acyl chlorides 
from amides.20.2 Structure and Reactivity of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives 805

Structure, reactivity, and carbonyl-group stabilization in carboxylic acid derivatives. Acyl chlorides are the

the most. Conversion of one class of compounds to another is feasible only in the direction that leads to a 
more stabilized carbonyl group—that is, from more reactive to less reactive.
Reaction Trends: Aldehydes and Ketones vs. 
Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
As we saw in Chapter 18, carbonyls are electrophilic and 
undergo reaction with nucleophiles at the carbonyl carbon. 
A new bond between the nucleophile and carbonyl carbon is 
formed, resulting in a tetrahedral carbon. This process is 
illustrated for a ketone:

Since C—C bonds are difficult to break, the ketone inter￾mediate can reform a carbonyl only if the new C—Nu bond is 
broken, which would return the starting ketone. 
The presence of the heteroatom in the carboxylic acid 
derivative provides a new path for carbonyl formation. Breaking 
the weaker carbon–heteroatom bond allows the carbonyl to 
reform and retains the new bond formed by the nucleophile.

This difference in reactivity, especially toward hydrolysis, has an important result. 
We’ll see in Chapter 25 that the structure and function of proteins are critical to life 
itself. The bonds mainly responsible for the structure of proteins are amide bonds, which 
are about 100 times more stable to hydrolysis than ester bonds. These amide bonds are 
stable enough to maintain the structural integrity of proteins in an aqueous environment, 
but susceptible enough to hydrolysis to be broken when the occasion demands.
What structural features are responsible for the reactivity order of carboxylic acid 
derivatives? Like the other carbonyl-containing compounds that we’ve studied, they all 
have a planar arrangement of bonds to the carbonyl group. Thus, all are about the same 
in offering relatively unhindered access to the approach of a nucleophile. They differ in 
the degree to which the atom attached to the carbonyl group can stabilize the carbonyl 
group by electron donation.

Electron release from the substituent X stabilizes the carbonyl group and makes it less 
electrophilic.
The order of reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives toward nucleophilic acyl 
substitution can be explained on the basis of the electron-donating properties of 
substituent X. The greater the electron-donating powers of X, the slower the rate.

 Because the CCl bond is so long, the lone-pair orbital (3p) of chlorine and the 
π orbital of the carbonyl group do not overlap sufficiently to permit delocalization 
of a chlorine unshared pair. Not only is the carbonyl group of an acyl chloride not 
stabilized by electron-pair donation, the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of 
chlorine makes it more electrophilic and more reactive toward nucleophiles.
2. Acid anhydrides: The carbonyl group of an acid anhydride is better stabilized by 
electron donation than the carbonyl group of an acyl chloride. Even though oxygen 
is more electronegative than chlorine, it is a far better electron-pair donor toward 
sp2

 Working against this electron-delocalization is the fact that both carbonyl groups 
are competing for the same electron pair. Thus, the extent to which each one is 
stabilized is reduced.
3. Esters: Like acid anhydrides, the carbonyl group of an ester is stabilized by electron 
release from oxygen. Because there is only one carbonyl group, versus two in

Amide resonance is a powerful stabilizing force and gives rise to a number of struc￾tural effects. Unlike the pyramidal arrangement of bonds in ammonia and amines, the 
bonds to nitrogen in amides lie in the same plane (Figure 20.2a). The carbon–nitrogen 
bond has considerable double-bond character and, at 135 pm (1.35 Å), is substantially 
shorter than the normal 147 pm (1.47 Å) carbon–nitrogen single-bond distance observed 
in amines.
The barrier to rotation about the carbon–nitrogen bond in amides is 75–85 kJ/mol 
(18–20 kcal/mol).

This is an unusually high rotational energy barrier for a single bond and indicates that 
the carbon–nitrogen bond has significant double-bond character, as the resonance and 
orbital overlap (Figure 20.2b) descriptions suggest.
Problem 20.2
Suggest an explanation for the fact that N,N-dimethylformamide [(CH3)2NCHO] has signals 
for three nonequivalent carbons (δ 31.3, 36.4, and 162.6) in its 13C NMR spectrum.
Electron release from nitrogen stabilizes the carbonyl group of amides and decreases 
the rate at which nucleophiles attack the carbonyl carbon.
An extreme example of carbonyl-group stabilization is seen in carboxylate anions:

The negatively charged oxygen is a powerful electron donor to the carbonyl group. 
Resonance in carboxylate anions is more effective than resonance in carboxylic acids, 
acyl chlorides, anhydrides, esters, and amides. Carboxylate ions do not undergo nucleophilic 
acyl substitution.
Most methods for their preparation convert one class of carboxylic acid derivative 
to another by nucleophilic acyl substitution. The order of carbonyl-group stabilization 
Recall (Section 3.1) that the rotational 
barrier in ethane is only 12 kJ/mol 
(3 kcal/mol).

(b)808 Chapter 20 Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution
given in Figure 20.1 bears directly on the means by which these transformations may be 
achieved. A reaction that converts one carboxylic acid derivative to another that lies 
below it in the figure is practical; a reaction that converts it to one that lies above it is 
not. This is another way of saying that one carboxylic acid derivative can be converted 
to another if the reaction leads to a more stabilized carbonyl group.
In practical terms, this means that a less reactive carboxylic acid derivative can be 
prepared directly from a more reactive carboxylic acid derivative. For example, an amide 
can be synthesized by reaction of an amine with an acyl chloride, anhydride, or ester. 
Conversely, a more reactive carboxylic acid derivative cannot be prepared by direct 
nucleophilic substitution of a less reactive carboxylic acid derivative. 
The most reactive carboxylic acid derivative in Figure 20.1, an acyl chloride, cannot 
be prepared by nucleophilic substitution of an anhydride, ester, or amide. Instead, it is 
prepared from a carboxylic acid using thionyl chloride (Section 13.7). An ester can be 
prepared directly by reaction of an acyl halide or an anhydride with an alcohol, but an 
amide cannot be converted into an ester by direct nucleophilic substitution. Numerous 
examples of the conversion of one carboxylic acid derivative to another will be presented 
in the sections that follow.
20.3 Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Mechanisms
Experimental support exists for several different mechanisms of nucleophilic acyl 
substitution, three of which are introduced here.
By far, the most common mechanism is bimolecular and involves what is referred to 
as a tetrahedral intermediate (TI). It incorporates two stages, formation of the TI by nucleo￾philic addition to the carbonyl group followed by an elimination that restores the 
carbonyl.

The first stage is rate-determining and analogous to nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl 
group of an aldehyde or ketone. Many of the same nucleophiles that add to the carbonyl 
groups of aldehydes and ketones—water, alcohols, and amines—add to carbonyl groups 
of carboxylic acid derivatives and lead to the products of nucleophilic acyl substitution. 
Each stage can involve several steps, the precise nature of which depends on whether the 
reaction occurs in neutral, acidic, or basic solution.
The main features that complicate the mechanism involve acid–base chemistry and 
influence the form in which the reactants, intermediates, and products exist under the 
reaction conditions. Thus, the rate-determining step can involve formation of the tetra￾hedral intermediate as a cation (TIH+), anion (TI−), or neutral species (TI) depending 
on the pH at which the reaction is carried out.

Once formed, the tetrahedral intermediate can revert to the original carboxylic acid 
derivative or go on to form the product of nucleophilic acyl substitution. As noted in the 
preceding section, the reactions generally proceed in the direction that converts a less 
stabilized carbonyl group to a more stable one.20.4 Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution in Acyl Chlorides 809
Alternative mechanisms for nucleophilic acyl substitution are more limited in their

Transition state
This mechanism combines features of both the tetrahedral intermediate and acylium ion 
mechanisms. Like the tetrahedral intermediate mechanism, bond making to the nucleo￾phile contributes to the transition state. Like the ionization mechanism, the bond to the 
leaving group is partially broken at the transition state. The latter makes it more likely 
to compete with the tetrahedral intermediate mechanism in reactions of acyl chlorides 
and less likely in reactions of anhydrides, esters, and amides.
20.4 Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution in Acyl Chlorides
Among the various carboxylic acid derivatives, acyl chlorides are especially useful because 
they are readily converted to acid anhydrides, esters, and amides by nucleophilic acyl 
substitution (Table 20.1). Yields are high and the reaction rates are much greater than the 
corresponding rates of alkyl halides with the same nucleophiles. Benzoyl chloride, for 
example, is about 1000 times more reactive than benzyl chloride toward hydrolysis at 25°C.
Problem 20.4
Use Table 20.1 to predict the major organic product obtained by reaction of benzoyl chloride 
with each of the following:
(a) Acetic acid (d) Methylamine, CH3NH2
(b) Benzoic acid (e) Dimethylamine, (CH3)2NH
(c) Ethanol (f) Water
One of the most useful reactions of 
acyl chlorides was presented in 
Section 13.7. Friedel–Crafts acylation 
of aromatic rings takes place when 
arenes are treated with acyl chlorides 
in the presence of aluminum chloride.

The product is a mixed anhydride. Acetic acid acts as a nucleophile and substitutes for

On examining the specific examples in Table 20.1, we see that nucleophilic sub￾stitutions of acyl chlorides are often carried out in the presence of pyridine. Pyridine is 
both a catalyst and a weak base. As a catalyst it increases the rate of acylation. As a 
base it prevents the build-up of HCl.
Table 20.1 concludes with the hydrolysis of acyl chlorides. Because acyl chlorides are 
themselves prepared by the reaction of carboxylic acids with thionyl chloride (Section 13.7), 
their hydrolysis is of little synthetic value.
20.5 Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution in Acid Anhydrides
After acyl halides, acid anhydrides are the most reactive carboxylic acid derivatives. 
Although anhydrides can be prepared by reaction of carboxylic acids with acyl chlorides 
as was shown in Table 20.1, the three most commonly used anhydrides are industrial 
chemicals and are prepared by specialized methods. Phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride, 
for example, are prepared from naphthalene and butane, respectively.

Acid anhydrides contain two acyl groups bonded to the same oxygen. In nucleo￾philic acyl substitution, one of these acyl groups becomes bonded to the nucleophilic 
atom. The other acyl group remains on oxygen to become part of a carboxylic acid.

Acid anhydrides are more stable and less reactive than acyl chlorides. Acetyl chlo￾ride, for example, undergoes hydrolysis about 100,000 times more rapidly than acetic 
anhydride at 25°C.
Table 20.2 gives examples of two reactions of acetic anhydride. In the first, the 
anhydride carbonyl is converted to the more stabilized carbonyl group of an ester; in the 
second, a more stabilized amide carbonyl results. Hydrolysis under neutral or acid-catalyzed 
conditions yields two moles of a carboxylic acid per mole of anhydride, but, like hydrolysis 
of acyl chlorides is of little preparative value and is not included in the table. Likewise,

Esters are moderately polar, with dipole moments in the 1.5- to 2.0-D range. Dipole–dipole 
attractive forces give esters higher boiling points than hydrocarbons of similar shape and 
molecular weight. Because they lack hydroxyl groups, however, ester molecules cannot 
form hydrogen bonds to each other and have lower boiling points than alcohols of 
comparable molecular weight.

Esters can participate in hydrogen bonds with substances that contain hydroxyl groups 
(water, alcohols, carboxylic acids). This confers some measure of water solubility on 
low-molecular-weight esters; methyl acetate, for example, dissolves in water to the extent 
of 33 g/100 mL. Water solubility decreases as the carbon content of the ester increases.

Many esters occur naturally. Those of low molecular weight are fairly volatile, and 
many have pleasing odors. Esters often form a significant fraction of the fragrant oil of 
fruits and flowers. The aroma of oranges, for example, contains 30 different esters along 
with 10 carboxylic acids, 34 alcohols, 34 aldehydes and ketones, and 36 hydrocarbons.

abundant natural products. The most important group of glycerol triesters includes those 
in which each acyl group is unbranched and has 14 or more carbon atoms. Structurally

20.7 Reactions of Esters: A Preview
Nucleophilic acyl substitutions of esters are summarized in Table 20.4. Esters are less 
reactive than acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides. Nucleophilic acyl substitution in esters, 
especially ester hydrolysis, has been extensively investigated from a mechanistic perspec￾tive. Indeed, much of what we know concerning the general topic of nucleophilic acyl 
substitution comes from studies carried out on esters. The following sections describe 
those mechanistic studies.

Notice that (R)-(Z )-5-tetradecen￾4-olide is a cyclic ester. Recall from 
Section 19.15 that cyclic esters are

names for lactones.

The pathway for acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis is given in Mechanism 20.2. It 
is precisely the reverse of the mechanism given for acid-catalyzed ester formation in 
Section 19.14. Like other nucleophilic acyl substitutions, it proceeds in two stages. A 
tetrahedral intermediate is formed in the first stage, then dissociates to products in the 
second stage.
A key feature of the first stage (steps 1–3) is the site at which the starting ester is 
protonated. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, as shown in step 1 of Mechanism 20.2, 
gives a cation that is stabilized by electron delocalization. The alternative site of proton￾ation, the alkoxy oxygen, gives rise to a much less stable cation.
Positive charge is delocalized.

HProtonation of the carbonyl oxygen makes the carbonyl group more electrophilic. 
A water molecule adds to the carbonyl group of the protonated ester in step 2. Loss of 
a proton from the resulting alkyloxonium ion gives the neutral form of the tetrahedral 
intermediate in step 3 and completes the first stage of the mechanism. In step 4 of 
Mechanism 20.2, protonation of the tetrahedral intermediate at its alkoxy oxygen gives 
a new oxonium ion, which loses a molecule of alcohol in step 5. Along with the alcohol, 
the protonated form of the carboxylic acid arises by dissociation of the tetrahedral inter￾mediate. Its deprotonation in step 6 completes the process.
Problem 20.7
On the basis of the general mechanism for acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis shown in 
Mechanism 20.2, write an analogous sequence of steps for the specific case of ethyl 
benzoate hydrolysis.
The most important species in the mechanism for ester hydrolysis is the tetrahedral 
intermediate. Evidence in support of its existence was developed by Professor Myron 
Bender on the basis of labeling experiments carried out at the University of Chicago. 
Bender prepared ethyl benzoate, labeled with the mass-18 isotope of the carbonyl oxygen, 
then subjected it to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in ordinary (unlabeled) water. Bender found 
that ethyl benzoate, recovered from the reaction before hydrolysis was complete, had lost 
a portion of its isotopic label. This observation is consistent only with the reversible 
formation of a tetrahedral intermediate under the reaction conditions:
O H3O+ O O
+ H2O + H2O
H3O+
O HO OH O
Tetrahedral intermediate Ethyl benzoate 18O-Labeled
ethyl benzoate
Water 18O-Labeled
water
The two OH groups in the tetrahedral intermediate are equivalent, and so either the labeled 
or the unlabeled one can be lost when the tetrahedral intermediate reverts to ethyl benzoate. 
Both are retained when the tetrahedral intermediate goes on to form benzoic acid.
Problem 20.8
In a similar experiment, unlabeled 4-butanolide was allowed to stand in an acidic solution in 
which the water had been labeled with 18O. When the lactone was extracted from the 
solution after four days, it was found to contain 18O. Which oxygen of the lactone do you 
think became isotopically labeled?

years ago, the seafaring peoples bordering the southeastern shores of the Mediterranean gener￾ally grouped as Phoenicians made soap by heating animal fat with wood ashes. Animal fat is 
rich in glycerol triesters, and wood ashes are a source of potassium carbonate. Basic hydrolysis 
of the fats produced a mixture of long-chain carboxylic acids as their potassium salts.

20.9 Ester Hydrolysis in Base: Saponification 821
The Ball Method
Hansen’s disease, formerly known as leprosy, was a scourge on humankind for thousands 
of years. The disease damaged the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucus membranes, 
resulting in severe physical deformities. Since Hansen’s disease was both contagious and incur￾able, people with the disease were outcasts and often forced to live apart from noninfected 
individuals in colonies. 
Symptoms of Hansen’s disease could be mildly controlled using practices from tradi￾tional medicine of India and China. One of these was chaulmoogra oil, an extract from the 
seeds of the Hydnocarpus species. Unfortunately, it was difficult to administer to patients 
owing to its bad taste, which induced vomiting. Furthermore, it had the consistency of butter 
and was ill-suited for administration by injection. 
In the early twentieth century, Dr. Harry T. Hollmann, a physician treating leprosy 
patients at the Molokai colony, approached the University of Hawai’i to develop an injectable 
formulation of the material. The challenge was undertaken by Alice Ball, who had earned her 
master’s degree in chemistry in natural product isolation and was an instructor in the 
department. Professor Ball successfully converted the waxy solid into a free-flowing liquid by 
first saponifying the fatty acid esters of the solid to their carboxylic acid salts, which dissolved 
in hot water. Acidifying the soapy solution caused the free fatty acids to float to the top of the 
container. The oil was skimmed from the top and then fractionated into components by distil￾lation and crystallization. The chaulmoogric acid fraction was subjected to acid-catalyzed 
esterification, yielding the ethyl esters as a free-flowing liquid.

Dr. Hollmann successfully treated dozens of patients at Molokai with the fatty acid esters, and the treatment regimen spread 
throughout the world. Chaulmoogra oil extracts prepared by the Ball method were used until the introduction of antibiotics against the 
causal bacteria, Mycobacterium leprae, in the 1940s. Professor Ball tragically passed away only a few years after her discovery, and 
another chemist at the university attempted to take credit for her method. Dr. Hollmann ensured her contribution was rightfully credited 
in publications and public presentations. Today the University of Hawai’i honors its first female and first African-American graduate and 
faculty member with an endowed scholarship bearing her name. The school’s lone chaulmoogra tree is dedicated to her memory.

Convincing evidence that ester hydrolysis in base proceeds by a nucleophilic acyl 
substitution mechanism has been obtained from several sources. In one experiment, ethyl 
propanoate labeled with 18O in the ethoxy group was hydrolyzed. On isolating the products, 
all the 18O was found in the ethyl alcohol; none was in the sodium propanoate.

The carbon–oxygen bond broken in the process is therefore the one between oxygen and 
the acyl group. The bond between oxygen and the ethyl group remains intact. An SN2 
reaction at the ethyl group would have broken this bond.
Problem 20.10
In a similar experiment, pentyl acetate was subjected to saponification with 18O-labeled 
hydroxide in 18O-labeled water. What product do you think became isotopically labeled here, 
acetate ion or 1-pentanol?
Identical conclusions come from stereochemical studies. Saponification of esters of

None of the bonds to the chirality center is broken when hydroxide adds to the carbonyl 
group. Had an SN2 reaction occurred instead, inversion of configuration at the chirality 
center would have taken place to give (S)-(–)-1-phenylethyl alcohol.
In an extension of his work described in the preceding section, Bender showed that 
ester hydrolysis in base, like acid hydrolysis, takes place by way of a tetrahedral intermediate. 
The nature of the experiment was the same, and the results were similar to those observed 
in the acid-catalyzed reaction.
Second-order kinetics, nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, and the involve￾ment of a tetrahedral intermediate are accommodated by Mechanism 20.3. Like the 
acid-catalyzed mechanism, it has two distinct stages, namely, formation of a tetrahedral 
intermediate and its subsequent dissociation. Nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group 
has a higher activation energy than dissociation of the tetrahedral intermediate; step 1 is 
rate-determining. All the steps are reversible except the last one. The equilibrium constant 
for proton abstraction from the carboxylic acid by hydroxide in step 3 is so large that it 
makes the overall reaction irreversible.
Problem 20.11
On the basis of the general mechanism for basic ester hydrolysis shown in Mechanism 20.3,

20.12 Amides
Physical Properties of Amides: In Section 20.2, we noted several of the ways in 
which electron donation from nitrogen to the carbonyl group affects various structural 
features of amides. To review, the hybridization of nitrogen in amides is sp2
, and the 
bonds to nitrogen lie in the same plane. The CN bond is shorter in amides, and the 20.12 Amides 827
activation energy for rotation about this bond is greater than in amines. According to the 
resonance picture of formamide, all these properties are consistent with significant CN 
double-bond character as expressed in contributor C.

Of the major classes of organic compounds, amides rank among the most polar. 
As shown in Table 20.5, acetamide, N-methylacetamide, and N,N-dimethylacetamide 
have dipole moments that range from 3.8 to 4.4 D compared with 1.9 for acetic acid. 
This increased polarity leads to stronger intermolecular attractive forces and causes the 
boiling points of the amides to be higher. They also contribute to higher melting points 
for the two amides in the table that contain NH bonds. N,N-Dimethylacetamide does 
not participate in the hydrogen bonds that characterize the solid phase and has the lowest 
melting point of the compounds in the table. On the other hand, acetamide has two NH 
protons capable of hydrogen bonding and is composed of flat sheets of hydrogen-bonded 
dimers stacked on top of each other in the crystal.

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in amides, along with the planar geometry of the 
amide functional group, are the two most important factors governing the conformation 
of protein chains. We’ll learn more about this in Chapter 25.
Acidity of Amides: Because nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, the NH 
group of an amide is a weaker acid than the OH of a carboxylic acid. Typical primary 
amides have pKa’s near 16, which makes them slightly less acidic than water. The 
presence of the carbonyl group makes amides stronger acids and weaker bases than

Synthesis of Amides: Tables 20.1, 20.2, and 20.4 included nucleophilic acyl substitu￾tions that are useful for preparing amides by the reaction of amines with acyl chlorides, 
anhydrides, and esters, respectively. These are the most common methods for the laboratory 
synthesis of amides.
Because acylation of amines with acyl chlorides and anhydrides yields an acid as 
one of the products (HCl from acyl chlorides, a carboxylic acid from an anhydride), the 
efficient synthesis of amides requires some attention to stoichiometry.
Two molar equivalents of amine are frequently used in the reaction with acyl chlorides 
and acid anhydrides; one molecule of amine acts as a nucleophile, the second as a 
Brønsted base.

It is possible to use only one molar equivalent of amine in these reactions if some other

cases in which the amine is either valuable or available only in small quantities.

Unlike esters, which can be prepared by acid-catalyzed condensation of an alcohol and a 
carboxylic acid, amides cannot be prepared by an acid-catalyzed condensation of an amine 
and a carboxylic acid. Why?
20.13 Hydrolysis of Amides
Amides are the least reactive carboxylic acid derivative, and the only nucleophilic acyl 
substitution reaction they undergo is hydrolysis. Amides are fairly stable in water, but 
the amide bond is cleaved on heating in the presence of strong acids or bases. Nominally, 
this cleavage produces an amine and a carboxylic acid. In acid, however, the amine is 
protonated, giving an ammonium ion:

Once formed, the O-protonated intermediate is attacked by a water molecule in step 2. 
The intermediate formed in this step loses a proton in step 3 to give the neutral form of 
the tetrahedral intermediate. The tetrahedral intermediate has its amino group (NH2) 
attached to an sp3
-hybridized carbon, and this amino group is the site at which proton￾ation occurs in step 4. Cleavage of the carbon–nitrogen bond in step 5 yields the proton￾ated form of the carboxylic acid, along with a molecule of ammonia. In acid solution 
ammonia is immediately protonated to give ammonium ion, as shown in step 6.
The protonation of ammonia in step 6 has such a large equilibrium constant that it 
makes the overall reaction irreversible.

In base the tetrahedral intermediate is formed in a manner analogous to that proposed 
for ester saponification. Steps 1 and 2 in Mechanism 20.5 show the formation of the tetra￾hedral intermediate in the basic hydrolysis of amides. In step 3 the basic amino group of the 
tetrahedral intermediate abstracts a proton from water, and in step 4 the derived ammonium 
ion dissociates. Conversion of the carboxylic acid to its corresponding carboxylate anion in

t may never be known just how spores of Penicillium notatum
found their way to a Petri dish containing Staphylococcus in 
Alexander Fleming’s laboratory at St. Mary’s Hospital in London 
during the summer of 1928. But they did, and the mold they 
produced made a substance that stopped the Staphylococcus
colony from growing. Fleming then systematically challenged 
the substance he called “penicillin” with other bacteria and, in 
addition to Staphylococcus, found impressive activity against 
Streptococcus as well as the bacteria that cause diphtheria, 
meningitis, and pneumonia. Fleming published these findings in 
1929, but his efforts to isolate the active substance responsible 
for penicillin’s antibacterial properties were unsuccessful.
By 1938, Fleming had moved on to other research, and 
Howard Florey and Ernst Chain of the School of Pathology at 
Oxford were just beginning a program aimed at developing anti￾bacterial agents from natural sources. A candidate that espe￾cially appealed to them was Fleming’s penicillin.
Their most daunting initial problem was making enough 
penicillin. Enter Norman Heatley, of whom it has been said: 
“. . . without Heatley, no penicillin.”* Heatley (Figure 20.3), an 
inventive and careful experimentalist, devised procedures to 
make and isolate penicillin on a scale sufficient to begin testing. 
By 1941, Florey, Chain, and Heatley had a drug that was both 
effective and safe.
England was at war, and the United States soon would be; 
the need for large amounts of penicillin was obvious. Working 
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Heatley and Andrew 
J. Moyer of the USDA laboratories in Peoria, Illinois, found better 
Penicillium sources and developed novel fermentation methods 
Figure 20.3
Norman Heatley was instrumental in devising methods for obtaining 
penicillins on a practical scale.

Just as amides are more stable than esters, lactams are more stable than lactones. 
Thus, although β-lactones are rare (Section 19.15), β-lactams are among the best known 
products of the pharmaceutical industry. The penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, 
which are so useful in treating bacterial infections, are β-lactams and are discussed in 
the boxed essay accompanying this section.

to produce ever-increasing amounts of penicillin. Treatment of 
wounded soldiers with penicillin became possible early in 1943 
and was widely practiced before the war ended in August 1945. 
Four months later, Fleming, Florey, and Chain traveled to 
Stockholm to accept that year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine. Heatley was not included because custom dictates 
that a Nobel Prize can be divided among no more than three 
persons.
The structure of penicillin is unusual because it con￾tains  an amide function as part of a four-membered ring 
Although their strained four-membered ring makes 
β-lactam antibiotics susceptible to hydrolysis, this same ele￾vated reactivity toward nucleophilic acyl substitution is 
responsible for their antibacterial properties. β-Lactams act 
by deactivating an enzyme, transpeptidase, required for the 
biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. The active site of 
(a β-lactam). Various penicillins differ in respect to substituent 
groups and their effectiveness against different strains of bac￾teria. Penicillin G originated in a strain obtained from a rotting 
cantaloupe in Peoria and was the first penicillin made on a 
large scale. Fleming’s original penicillin (now called penicillin F) 
bears a CH3CH2CHCHCH2 group in place of the C6H5CH2
of penicillin G. A different class of β-lactam antibiotics, the 
cephalosporins, are similar in structure to the penicillins but 
have a six-membered instead of a five-membered sulfur￾containing ring.
transpeptidase contains a key hydroxyl group, which is con￾verted to an ester by a nucleophilic acyl substitution that 
cleaves the β-lactam ring. With the acylated form of the 
enzyme unable to catalyze cell-wall biosynthesis, further 
bacterial growth is brought under control, and the body’s 
immune system does the rest.

20.15 Preparation of Nitriles
We have already discussed two procedures by which nitriles are prepared, namely, 
nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides by cyanide and conversion of aldehydes and 
ketones to cyanohydrins. Table 20.6 reviews aspects of these reactions. Neither of the 
reactions in the table is suitable for aryl nitriles (ArCN); these compounds are normally 
prepared by a reaction to be discussed in Section 22.17.
Both alkyl and aryl nitriles are accessible by dehydration of amides.

20.16 Hydrolysis of Nitriles
Nitriles are classified as carboxylic acid derivatives because they are converted to car￾boxylic acids on hydrolysis. The conditions required are similar to those for the hydro￾lysis of amides, namely, heating in aqueous acid or base for several hours. Like the 
hydrolysis of amides, nitrile hydrolysis is irreversible in the presence of acids or bases. 
Acid hydrolysis yields ammonium ion and a carboxylic acid.

The first four steps of the mechanism for hydrolysis of nitriles in basic solution are 
given in Mechanism 20.6. These steps convert the nitrile to an amide, which then pro￾ceeds to the hydrolysis products according to the mechanism of amide hydrolysis in 
Mechanism 20.5.
The acid-catalyzed mechanism for nitrile hydrolysis also goes through the amide 
as an intermediate. Problem 20.26 encourages you to propose a mechanism for that 
process.
Problem 20.26
Suggest a reasonable mechanism for the conversion of a nitrile (RCN) to the corresponding 
amide in aqueous acid.
Nucleophiles other than water can also add to the carbon–nitrogen triple bond of 
nitriles. In the following section we will see a synthetic application of such a nucleophilic 
addition.

The carbon–nitrogen triple bond of nitriles is much less reactive toward nucleophilic

20.18 Spectroscopic Analysis of 
Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
Infrared: IR spectroscopy is quite useful in identifying carboxylic acid derivatives. 
The carbonyl stretching vibration is very strong, and its position is sensitive to the nature 
of the carbonyl group. In general, electron donation from the substituent decreases the 
double-bond character of the bond between carbon and oxygen and decreases the stretch￾ing frequency. Two distinct absorptions are observed for the symmetric and antisymmetric 
stretching vibrations of the anhydride function.

H NMR spectra aid the structure deter￾mination of esters. Consider the two isomeric esters: ethyl acetate and methyl propanoate.840 Chapter 20 Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution
As Figure 20.4 shows, the number of signals and their multiplicities are the same for 
both esters. Both have a methyl singlet and a triplet–quartet pattern for the ethyl group.

Notice, however, that there is a significant difference in the chemical shifts of the cor￾responding signals in the two spectra. The methyl singlet is more shielded (δ 2.0) when 
it is bonded to the carbonyl group of ethyl acetate than when it is bonded to the oxygen 
of methyl propanoate (δ 3.6). The methylene quartet is more shielded (δ 2.3) when it is 
bonded to the carbonyl group of methyl propanoate than when it is bonded to the oxygen 
of ethyl acetate (δ 4.1). Analysis of only the number of peaks and their splitting patterns 
does not provide an unambiguous answer to structure assignment in esters; chemical-shift 
data such as that just described must also be considered.
The chemical shift of the NH proton of amides appears in the range δ 5–8 and 
is often very broad.
13C NMR: The 13C NMR spectra of carboxylic acid derivatives, like the spectra of 
carboxylic acids themselves, are characterized by a low-field resonance for the carbonyl 
carbon in the range δ 160–180. The carbonyl carbons of carboxylic acid derivatives are 
more shielded than those of aldehydes and ketones, but less shielded than the sp2
-hybridized 
carbons of alkenes and arenes.
The carbon of a CN group appears near δ 120.

Nitrogen is a better electron-pair donor than oxygen, and amides have a more

Section 20.3 The characteristic reaction of acyl chlorides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides

Table 20.2 presents examples of these reactions.
Section 20.6 Esters occur naturally or are prepared from alcohols by Fischer esterification or 
by acylation with acyl chlorides or acid anhydrides (see Table 20.3). Esters are 
polar and have higher boiling points than alkanes of comparable size and shape. 
Esters don’t form hydrogen bonds to other ester molecules so have lower 
boiling points than analogous alcohols. They can form hydrogen bonds to water 
and so are comparable to alcohols in their solubility in water.
Section 20.7 Esters give amides on reaction with ammonia and amines and are cleaved to a 
carboxylic acid and an alcohol on hydrolysis (see Table 20.4).
Section 20.8 Ester hydrolysis can be catalyzed by acids and its mechanism (see Mechanism 
20.2) is the reverse of the mechanism for Fischer esterification. The reaction 
proceeds via a tetrahedral intermediate.

Section 20.9 Ester hydrolysis in basic solution is called saponification and proceeds through 
the same tetrahedral intermediate (see Mechanism 20.3) as in acid-catalyzed 
hydrolysis. Unlike acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, saponification is irreversible 
because the carboxylic acid is deprotonated under the reaction conditions.

Section 20.18 Acyl chlorides, anhydrides, esters, and amides all show a strong band for 
CO stretching in the infrared. The range extends from about 1820 cm−1 (acyl 
chlorides) to 1690 cm−1 (amides). Their 13C NMR spectra are characterized by 
a peak near δ 180 for the carbonyl carbon. 1
H NMR spectroscopy is useful for 
distinguishing between the groups R and R′ in esters (RCO2R′). The protons on 
the carbon bonded to O in R′ appear at lower field (less shielded) than those 
on the carbon bonded to CO.

In Chapter 18 you learned that nucleophilic addition to the 
carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones is one of the fun￾damental types of reactions in organic chemistry. In 
Chapter  20  you saw how addition to the carbonyl group of 
esters is a key step in nucleophilic acyl substitution. In the 
present chapter, you’ll encounter yet another pattern of reac￾tivity of these compounds involving enols and the enolates
derived from them.

Enolates, represented as a hybrid of the resonance structures shown, are the conjugate 
bases of enols. The major enolate contributor is the structure with the negative charge 
on oxygen. It is, however, the carbanionic character of the α carbon that is respon￾sible for the importance of enolates in organic synthesis, and we will sometimes write 
the enolate in the form that has the negative charge on carbon to emphasize this.
21.1 Aldehyde, Ketone, and Ester Enolates
It is convenient to use Greek letters to designate atoms in relation to the carbonyl group 
in an aldehyde, ketone, or ester. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl carbon is the α 
carbon atom, the next one down the chain is the β carbon, and so on. Butanal, for 
example, has an α carbon, a β carbon, and a γ carbon.
The carbonyl carbon is the reference atom;
no Greek letter is assigned to it.
O
CH3CH2CH2CH
γ β α
Substituents take the same Greek letter as the carbon atom to which they are 
attached. A hydrogen connected to the α-carbon atom is an α hydrogen. Butanal has two 
α hydrogens, two β hydrogens, and three γ hydrogens. No Greek letter is assigned to the 
hydrogen attached directly to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde.
Our experience to this point has been that CH bonds are not very acidic. Alkanes, 
for example, have pKa’s of approximately 50. Compared with them, however, aldehydes, 
ketones, and esters have relatively acidic hydrogens on their α-carbon atoms (Table 21.1).

Two factors—one an electron-withdrawing inductive effect, the other electron 
delocalization—combine to make an HCCO unit of an aldehyde, ketone, or ester 
relatively acidic compared with most other CH bonds. The inductive effect of the 
carbonyl group increases the positive character of the α hydrogen, and resonance stabilizes 
the conjugate base.

The fact that the pKa’s of most simple aldehydes and ketones are about 16–20 
means that both the carbonyl compound and its enolate are present when an acid–base 
equilibrium is established with hydroxide ion. The pKa’s of 2-methylpropanal and 
water, for example, are so similar that the equilibrium constant for enolate formation is 
approximately 1.

Lithium diisopropylamide (known as LDA) is comparable to sodium amide (NaNH2) in 
basicity, but, unlike NaNH2, is too sterically hindered to undergo competing nucleophilic 
addition to the carbonyl group.
Problem 21.2
Methyllithium is a stronger base than lithium diisopropylamide but would not be a good 
choice for converting aldehydes and ketones to their enolates. Why?
The decreased acidity of ester α protons compared with those of aldehydes and 
ketones reflects the decreased electron-withdrawing ability of an ester carbonyl. Electron 
delocalization of the type:

decreases the positive character of an ester carbonyl group and reduces its ability to

The conditions for generating enolates from simple esters are similar to those used 
for aldehydes and ketones except that alkoxide bases are used instead of hydroxide. The 
alkoxide is chosen to match the ester (sodium ethoxide with ethyl esters, sodium methoxide 
with methyl esters) to avoid complications due to exchange of alkoxy groups by nucleo￾philic acyl substitution. An equilibrium is established in which the ester predominates 
and only a very small amount of enolate is present.

Instead of simply maintaining an equilibrium between the two, however, carbon–carbon 
bond formation occurs.

The β-hydroxy aldehyde product is called an aldol because it contains both an aldehyde

the series of steps shown in Mechanism 21.1. All the steps in the reaction are reversible, 21.2 The Aldol Condensation 859

Mixed aldol additions and condensations are those involving two different carbonyl com￾pounds. In the most synthetically useful circumstances, only one of the reactants can

21.4 Acylation of Enolates: The Claisen 
and Related Condensations
Nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone by an enolate is a 
key step in aldol condensations. Nucleophilic acyl substitution at the carbonyl group of 
an ester by an enolate is a key step in several synthetic procedures applied to making 
CC bonds.
In the Claisen condensation, one ester is the source of both the acyl group and 
the enolate and the product is a β-keto ester.

1. NaOCH2CH3
2. H3O+ O

+ OH 2
An ester must have, as in this case, at least two α hydrogens to undergo a syn￾thetically useful Claisen condensation. The first α proton is removed to form the ester 
enolate (step 1 in Mechanism 21.2). However, the equilibrium concentration of the β-keto 
ester is unfavorable unless a second α proton is removed as in step 4. Thus, Claisen 
concentrations succeed for esters of the type RCH2CO2R′, but not R2CHCO2R′.
Ludwig Claisen was a German 
chemist who worked during the last 
two decades of the nineteenth 
century and the first two decades of 
the twentieth. Claisen’s name is 
associated with three reactions. The 
Claisen–Schmidt reaction was

21.5 Alkylation of Enolates: The Acetoacetic 
Ester and Malonic Ester Syntheses
Simple aldehyde, ketone, and ester enolates are relatively basic, and their alkylation is 
limited to methyl and primary alkyl halides; secondary and tertiary alkyl halides undergo 
elimination. Even when alkylation is possible, other factors intervene that can reduce its 
effectiveness as a synthetic tool. It is not always possible to limit the reaction to mono￾alkylation, and aldol addition can compete with alkylation. With unsymmetrical ketones, 
regioselectivity becomes a consideration. For example, a strong, hindered base such as 
lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) exhibits a preference for abstracting a proton from the 
less substituted α carbon of 2-methylcyclohexanone to form the enolate with the less￾substituted double bond, termed the kinetic enolate. The isomeric enolate with the more￾substituted double bond, termed the thermodynamic enolate, is also formed to some 
degree. Regioisomeric products are formed on alkylation with benzyl bromide.

With a pKa of 8.9, the protons attached to C-3 of 2,4-pentanedione are much more acidic 
than the protons of C-1 and C-5 (pKa ≈ 19). This increased acidity reflects stabilization 
of the enolate by electron delocalization involving both carbonyl groups.
O O O O O O
H H H
Similar stabilization and reduced basicity of the enolates of β-keto esters and esters of 
malonic acid makes possible their efficient alkylation as well.
Two procedures called the acetoacetic ester synthesis and the malonic ester 
synthesis take advantage of the properties of β-dicarbonyl compounds and are standard 
methods for making carbon–carbon bonds. Both begin with alkylation of the enolate. 
Ethyl esters are normally used, with sodium ethoxide as the base.

After alkylation, hydrolysis in aqueous base and acidification, followed by heating, 
leads to decarboxylation. The alkylated β-keto ester yields a ketone; the alkylated malonic 
ester gives a carboxylic acid.

A convenient way to determine when to apply the acetoacetic ester or malonic ester 
approach to a synthetic problem is to incorporate the synthon concept into retrosynthetic 
analysis. A synthon is a structural unit in a molecule that is related to a synthetic 
operation. A CH2CO2H group is a synthon that alerts us to the possibility of preparing 
a target by a malonic ester synthesis. Likewise, a CH2C(O)CH3 group is a synthon that 
suggests an acetoacetic synthesis.

Keto enol equilibration is a property of carbonyl compounds that contain a proton 
on their α carbon and normally favors the keto form (Table 21.2). Simple aldehydes and 
ketones exist almost entirely in their keto forms; acetaldehyde contains less than 1 ppm 
of its enol, and acetone contains 100 times less than that. The enol content of acetic acid 
and methyl acetate is even smaller because their keto isomers are stabilized by electron 
release from OH and OCH3, respectively, to CO; the enols are not.

The far higher enol content in the β-dicarbonyl compounds of Table 21.2—almost 
7% in ethyl acetoacetate and 20% in 2,4-pentanedione—reflects the stabilization of the 
enol by conjugation of the carbon–carbon double bond with the other carbonyl group plus 
intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the enolic OH with CO. Both features are apparent 
in the structure of the enol of 2,4-pentanedione shown in Figure 21.1. Analogous structural 
features stabilize the enol of ethyl acetoacetate.

Phosphorus trichloride converts the carboxylic acid to the corresponding acyl chloride, 
which has a less stabilized carbonyl group (see Section 20.2) and, therefore, a greater 
enol content. Bromination of this enol takes place, followed by a process that gives the 
α-bromo acid plus another molecule of the acyl chloride, which then undergoes enoliza￾tion, bromination, and so on.
This procedure is called the Hell–
Volhard–Zelinsky reaction after its 
discoverers. In an alternative method, 
elemental phosphorus is used which 
reacts with the halogen to generate 
the phosphorus trihalide.21.7 The Haloform Reaction 875

21.8 Some Chemical and Stereochemical 
Consequences of Enolization
A number of novel reactions involving the α-carbon atom of aldehydes and ketones 
involve enol and enolate anion intermediates.
Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at the α-carbon atom of an aldehyde or a 
ketone is a convenient way to introduce an isotopic label into a molecule and is readily 
carried out by treating the carbonyl compound with deuterium oxide (D2O) and base.

Only the α hydrogens are replaced by deuterium in this reaction. The key intermediate 
is the enolate ion formed by proton abstraction from the α-carbon atom of cyclopenta￾none. Transfer of deuterium from the solvent D2O to the enolate gives cyclopentanone 
containing a deuterium atom in place of one of the hydrogens at the α carbon.

21.9 Conjugation Effects in α,β-Unsaturated 
Aldehydes and Ketones
Aldol condensation (Section 21.3) offers an effective route to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes 
and ketones, compounds that have interesting and useful properties that result from 
conjugation of the carbon–carbon double bond with the carbonyl group.
First, in common with other conjugated π electron systems that we have seen, 
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones are more stable than their nonconjugated isomers. 
Under conditions chosen to bring about their interconversion, for example, the equilib￾rium between a β,γ-unsaturated carbonyl and its α,β-unsaturated analog favors the 
conjugated isomer.

The positive character of the β carbon suggested by the resonance description is consis￾tent with numerous differences between α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and their 
nonconjugated relatives. Consistent with its greater separation of positive and negative

addition. Nucleophilic addition, on the other hand, can involve either the carbonyl group 
or the α,β double bond.

Amines
Nitrogen-containing compounds are essential to life. Their ulti￾mate source is atmospheric nitrogen that, by a process known 
as nitrogen fixation, is reduced to ammonia, then converted to 
organic nitrogen compounds. This chapter describes the chem￾istry of amines, organic derivatives of ammonia. Alkylamines
have their nitrogen attached to sp3
-hybridized carbon; arylamines
have their nitrogen attached to an sp2
-hybridized carbon of a 
benzene or benzene-like ring.

Amines, like ammonia, are weak bases. They are, how￾ever, the strongest uncharged bases found in significant quanti￾ties under physiological conditions. Amines are usually the 
bases involved in biological acid–base reactions; they are often 
the nucleophiles in biological nucleophilic substitutions.
Our word vitamin was coined in 1912 in the belief that the 
substances present in the diet that prevented scurvy, pellagra, 
beriberi, rickets, and other diseases were “vital amines.” In many 
cases, that belief was confirmed; certain vitamins did prove to 
be amines. In many other cases, however, vitamins were not 
In 1917, Robert Robinson verified his ideas about the biosynthesis of alkaloids 
by combining methylamine with the compounds shown. The reaction worked 
as Robinson planned and is recognized as the first chemical synthesis inspired 
by biochemical thinking.

amines. Nevertheless, the name vitamin entered our language and stands as a reminder that 
early chemists recognized the crucial place occupied by amines in biological processes.
22.1 Amine Nomenclature
Unlike alcohols and alkyl halides, which are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary 
according to the degree of substitution at the carbon that bears the functional group, 
amines are classified according to their degree of substitution at nitrogen. An amine with 
one carbon attached to nitrogen is a primary amine, an amine with two is a secondary 
amine, and an amine with three is a tertiary amine.

The groups attached to nitrogen may be any combination of alkyl or aryl groups.
Amines are named in two main ways in the IUPAC system, either as alkylamines or 
as alkanamines. When primary amines are named as alkylamines, the ending -amine is 
added to the name of the alkyl group that bears the nitrogen. When named as alkanamines, 
the alkyl group is named as an alkane and the -e ending replaced by -amine.

Aniline is the parent IUPAC name for amino-substituted derivatives of benzene. 
Substituted derivatives of aniline are numbered beginning at the carbon that bears the 
amino group. Substituents are listed in alphabetical order, and the direction of numbering 
is governed by the usual “first point of difference” rule.

degradation product of indigo, a dark 
blue dye obtained from the West 
Indian plant Indigofera anil, from 
which the name aniline is derived.896 Chapter 22 Amines
Arylamines may also be named as arenamines. Thus, benzenamine is an alternative, 
but rarely used, name for aniline.
Compounds with two amino groups are named by adding the suffix -diamine to 
the name of the corresponding alkane or arene. The final -e of the parent hydrocarbon

22.2 Structure and Bonding
Alkylamines: As shown in Figure 22.1, methylamine, like ammonia, has a pyramidal 
arrangement of bonds to nitrogen. Its HNH angles (106°) are slightly smaller than 
the tetrahedral value of 109.5°, whereas the CNH angle (112°) is slightly larger. 
The CN bond distance of 147 pm (1.47 Å) lies between typical CC bond distances 
in alkanes (153 pm; 1.53 Å) and CO bond distances in alcohols (143 pm; 1.43 Å).
Nitrogen and carbon are both sp3
-hybridized and are joined by a σ bond in 
methylamine. The unshared electron pair on nitrogen occupies an sp3
-hybridized orbital 
and is involved in reactions in which amines act as bases or nucleophiles. The elec￾trostatic potential map clearly shows the concentration of electron density at nitrogen 
in methylamine.
Arylamines: Aniline, like alkylamines, has a pyramidal arrangement of bonds around nitro￾gen, but its pyramid is somewhat shallower. One measure of the extent of this flattening is 
given by the angle between the carbon–nitrogen bond and the bisector of the HNH angle.

142.5° 180°
For sp3
-hybridized nitrogen, this angle (not the same as the CNH bond angle) is 
125°, and the measured angles in simple alkylamines are close to that. The correspond￾ing  angle for sp2
 hybridization at nitrogen with a planar arrangement of bonds, as in 
amides, for example, is 180°. The measured value for this angle in aniline is 142.5°, 
suggesting a hybridization somewhat closer to sp3
 than to sp2
.
Amines that are substituted with three 
different groups on the nitrogen are 
chiral but cannot be resolved into 
enantiomers because of the low 
energy barrier for racemization by 
inversion (see Section 4.14).

region in the electrostatic potential map.898 Chapter 22 Amines
The structure of aniline reflects a compromise between two modes of binding 
the nitrogen lone pair (Figure 22.2). The electrons are more strongly attracted to 
nitrogen when they are in an orbital with some s character—an sp3
-hybridized orbital, 
for example—than when they are in a p orbital. On the other hand, delocalization of 
these electrons into the aromatic π system is better achieved if they occupy a p orbital. 
A p orbital of nitrogen is better aligned for overlap with the p orbitals of the benzene 
ring to form an extended π system than is an sp3
-hybridized orbital. As a result of 
these two opposing forces, nitrogen adopts an orbital hybridization that is between 
sp3
 and sp2
.
The corresponding resonance description shows the delocalization of the nitrogen 
lone-pair electrons in terms of contributions from dipolar structures.

Dipolar resonance contributors of aniline
Delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair decreases the electron density at nitrogen 
while increasing it in the π system of the aromatic ring. We’ve already seen one 
chemical consequence of this in the high level of reactivity of aniline in electrophilic 
aromatic substitution reactions (see Section 13.12). Other ways in which electron 
delocalization affects the properties of arylamines are described in later sections of 
this chapter.
Problem 22.4
As the extent of electron delocalization into the ring increases, the geometry at nitrogen 
flattens. p-Nitroaniline, for example, is planar. Write a resonance contributor for p-nitroaniline 
that shows how the nitro group increases electron delocalization.

sp2
-hybridized, and the electron pair is delocalized between a p orbital of nitrogen and the π system 
of the ring. The region of highest electron density in (b) encompasses both the ring and nitrogen. The 
actual structure combines features of both; nitrogen adopts a hybridization state between sp3
 and sp2
. 
The color scale is the same for both models.22.4 Basicity of Amines 899
22.3 Physical Properties
We have often seen that the polar nature of a substance can affect physical properties 
such as boiling point. This is true for amines, which are more polar than alkanes but less 
polar than alcohols. For similarly constituted compounds, alkylamines have boiling points 
higher than those of alkanes but lower than those of alcohols.

Dipole–dipole interactions, especially hydrogen bonding, are present in amines but 
absent in alkanes. But because nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen, an NH bond 
is less polar than an OH bond and hydrogen bonding is weaker in amines than in alcohols.
Among isomeric amines, primary amines have the highest boiling points, and ter￾tiary amines the lowest.

Primary and secondary amines can participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but 
tertiary amines lack NH bonds and so cannot.
Amines that have fewer than six or seven carbon atoms are soluble in water. All amines, 
even tertiary amines, can act as proton acceptors in hydrogen bonding to water molecules.
22.4 Basicity of Amines
When considering the basicity of amines, bear in mind that:
The more basic the amine, the weaker its conjugate acid.
The more basic the amine, the larger the pKa of its conjugate acid.
Citing amine basicity according to pKa of its conjugate acid makes it possible to analyze 
acid–base reactions of amines according to the usual Brønsted relationships. For example, 
we see that amines are converted to ammonium ions by acids even as weak as acetic acid:

Problem 22.5
Apply the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (see Section 19.4) to calculate the 
CH3NH3
+/CH3NH2 ratio in water buffered at pH 7.
Their basicity provides a means by which amines may be separated from neutral organic 
compounds. A mixture containing an amine is dissolved in diethyl ether and shaken with 
dilute hydrochloric acid to convert the amine to an ammonium salt. The ammonium salt, 
being ionic, dissolves in the aqueous phase, which is separated from the ether layer. Adding 
sodium hydroxide to the aqueous layer converts the ammonium salt back to the free amine, 
which is then removed from the aqueous phase by extraction with a fresh portion of ether.
Amines are weak bases, but as a class, amines are the strongest bases of all neutral 
molecules. Table 22.1 lists basicity data for a number of amines. The most important 
relationships to be drawn from the data are:
1. Alkylamines are slightly stronger bases than ammonia.
2. Alkylamines differ very little among themselves in basicity. Their basicities cover 
a range of less than 10 in equilibrium constant (1 pK unit).
3. Arylamines are about 1 million times (6 pK units) weaker bases than ammonia and 
alkylamines.

Conjugate Acids*22.4 Basicity of Amines 901
The small differences in basicity between ammonia and alkylamines, and among 
the various classes of alkylamines (primary, secondary, tertiary), come from a mix of 
effects. Replacing hydrogens of ammonia by alkyl groups affects both sides of the acid–
base equilibrium in ways that largely cancel.
Replacing hydrogens by aryl groups is a different story, however. An aryl group 
affects the base much more than the conjugate acid, and the overall effect is large. One 
way to compare alkylamines and arylamines is by examining the Brønsted equilibrium 
for proton transfer to an alkylamine from the conjugate acid of an arylamine.

The equilibrium shown in the equation lies far to the right. Keq = 106
 for proton transfer 
from the conjugate acid of aniline to cyclohexylamine, making cyclohexylamine 1,000,000 
times more basic than aniline.
Reading the equation from left to right, we can say that anilinium ion is a stronger 
acid than cyclohexylammonium ion because loss of a proton from anilinium ion creates 
a delocalized electron pair of aniline and biases the equilibrium toward the right.
Reading the equation from right to left, we can say that aniline is a weaker base 
than cyclohexylamine because the electron pair on nitrogen of aniline is strongly held 
by virtue of being delocalized into the π system of the aromatic ring. The unshared pair 
in cyclohexylamine is localized on nitrogen, less strongly held, and therefore “more 
available” in an acid–base reaction.
Problem 22.6
The pKa’s of the conjugate acids of the two amines shown differ by a factor of 40,000. 
Which amine is the stronger base? Why?

H
Tetrahydroquinoline

Even though they are weaker bases, arylamines, like alkylamines, can be completely 
protonated by strong acids. Aniline is extracted from an ether solution into 1 M hydro￾chloric acid by being completely converted to a water-soluble anilinium salt under these 
conditions.
Conjugation of the amino group of an arylamine with a second aromatic ring, then 
a third, reduces its basicity even further. Diphenylamine is 6300 times less basic than 
aniline, whereas triphenylamine is scarcely a base at all, being estimated as 1010 times 
less basic than aniline and 1014 times less basic than ammonia.

In general, electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring increase the basicity 
of arylamines only slightly. Thus, as shown in Table 22.2, an electron-donating methyl 
group in the para position increases the basicity of aniline by less than 1 pK unit. Electron￾withdrawing groups are base-weakening and can exert large effects. A p-trifluoromethyl 
group decreases the basicity of aniline by a factor of 200 and a para-nitro group by a 902 Chapter 22 Amines
factor of 3800. In the case of p-nitroaniline a resonance interaction of the type shown 
provides for extensive delocalization of the unshared electron pair of the amine group.

Electron delocalization in p-nitroaniline
Just as aniline is much less basic than alkylamines because the unshared electron pair of 
nitrogen is delocalized into the π system of the ring, p-nitroaniline is even less basic because 
the extent of this delocalization is greater and involves the oxygens of the nitro group.
Problem 22.7
Each of the following is a much weaker base than aniline. Present a resonance argument to 
explain the effect of the substituent in each case.

This resonance stabilization is lost when the amine group becomes protonated; therefore, 
o-cyanoaniline is a weaker base than aniline.
Multiple substitution by strongly electron-withdrawing groups diminishes the basic￾ity of arylamines still more. Aniline is 3800 times as strong a base as p-nitroaniline and 
109
 times more basic than 2,4-dinitroaniline.
Nonaromatic heterocyclic compounds, piperidine, for example, are similar in basicity 
to alkylamines. When nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring, however, its basicity decreases 
markedly. Pyridine, for example, is almost 1 million times less basic than piperidine.

The difference between the two lies in the fact that the nitrogen lone pair occupies an 
sp3
-hybridized orbital in piperidine versus an sp2
-hybridized one in pyridine. As we have 
noted on several occasions, electrons in orbitals with more s character are more strongly 
held than those with less s character. For this reason, nitrogen binds its unshared pair 
more strongly in pyridine than in piperidine and is less basic.
Imidazole and its derivatives form an interesting and important class of heterocyclic 
aromatic amines. Imidazole is approximately 100 times more basic than pyridine. Pro￾tonation of imidazole yields an ion that is stabilized by the electron delocalization rep￾resented in the resonance structures shown:

The ease with which amines are extracted into aqueous acid, 
combined with their regeneration on treatment with base, 
makes it a simple matter to separate amines from other plant 
materials, and nitrogen-containing natural products were among 
the earliest organic compounds to be studied. Their basic 
(alkaline) properties led amines obtained from plants to be 
called alkaloids. The number of known alkaloids exceeds 5000. 
They are of special interest because most are characterized by 
a high level of biological activity. Some examples include 
atropine, coniine, and morphine.
Many alkaloids, such as nicotine and quinine, contain two 
(or more) nitrogen atoms. The nitrogens shown in red in quinine 
and nicotine are part of a substituted quinoline and pyridine 
ring, respectively.

22.5 Tetraalkylammonium Salts as Phase-Transfer Catalysts
In spite of being ionic, many quaternary ammonium salts dissolve in nonpolar media. 
The four alkyl groups attached to nitrogen shield its positive charge and impart lipophilic
(hydrophobic) character to the tetraalkylammonium ion. The following two quaternary 
ammonium salts, for example, are soluble in solvents of low polarity such as benzene, 
decane, and halogenated hydrocarbons:

spermidine, and spermine exist as cations with a charge of

+ +
Sodium cyanide does not dissolve in butyl bromide. The two reactants contact each other 
only at the surface of the solid sodium cyanide, and the rate of reaction under these 
conditions is too slow to be of synthetic value. Dissolving the sodium cyanide in water 
is of little help because butyl bromide is not soluble in water and reaction can occur only 
at the interface between the two phases. Adding a small amount of benzyltrimethyl￾ammonium chloride, however, causes pentanenitrile to form rapidly even at room tem￾perature. The quaternary ammonium salt is acting as a catalyst; it increases the reaction 
rate but is not consumed. How?
Quaternary ammonium salts catalyze the reaction between an anion and an organic 
substrate by transferring the anion from the aqueous phase, where it cannot contact the 
substrate, to the organic phase. In the cycle shown in Figure 22.4, the first step occurs in 
the aqueous phase and is an exchange of the anionic partner of the quaternary ammonium 
salt for cyanide ion. The benzyltrimethylammonium ion migrates to the butyl bromide 
phase, carrying a cyanide ion along with it. Once in the organic phase, cyanide ion is 
only weakly solvated and is far more reactive than it is in water or ethanol, where it is 
strongly solvated by hydrogen bonding. The benzyltrimethylammonium bromide formed 
in the substitution step returns to the aqueous phase, where it can repeat the cycle. Phase￾transfer catalysis incorporates principles of green chemistry. Reactions are faster and pro￾ceed in higher yield; fewer side products are produced; the need for excess reagents 
(cyanide in this case) is minimized; and water can be used as a solvent.

the nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides and the reaction of α-halo acids with ammonia 
give amines directly. The other reactions in Table 22.3 yield products that are converted 
to amines by some subsequent procedure. As these procedures are described in the fol￾lowing sections, you will see that they are largely applications of principles that you’ve 
already learned. You will encounter some new reagents and some new uses for familiar 
reagents, but very little in the way of new reaction types is involved.

Although this reaction is useful for preparing α-amino acids (see Table 22.3, fifth entry), it 
is not a general method for the synthesis of amines. Its major limitation is that the expected 
primary amine product is itself a nucleophile and competes with ammonia for the alkyl 
halide. When 1-bromooctane, for example, is allowed to react with ammonia, both the primary 
amine and the secondary amine are isolated in comparable amounts.

Alkylation of ammonia is sometimes employed in industrial processes such as the preparation 
of allylamine from propene, chlorine, and ammonia. Write a series of equations summarizing 
this process. (Allylamine has a number of uses, including the preparation of the diuretic drugs 
meralluride and mercaptomerin.)
Aryl halides that are substituted with electron-withdrawing groups react with amines 
by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (see Section 13.19).
22.8 The Gabriel Synthesis of Primary Alkylamines
A method that achieves the same end result as that of alkylation of ammonia but which 
avoids the formation of secondary and tertiary amines as byproducts is the Gabriel 
synthesis. Alkyl halides are converted to primary alkylamines without contamination by 
secondary or tertiary amines. The key reagent is the potassium salt of phthalimide, prepared

Among compounds other than simple alkyl halides, α-halo ketones, α-halo esters, 
and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates have also been used. Because phthalimide can undergo only 
a single alkylation, the formation of secondary and tertiary amines does not occur, and the 
Gabriel synthesis is a valuable procedure for the laboratory preparation of primary amines.

22.9 Preparation of Amines by Reduction
Almost any nitrogen-containing organic compound can be reduced to an amine. The 
synthesis of amines then becomes a question of the availability of suitable precursors 
and the choice of an appropriate reducing agent.
Alkyl azides, prepared by nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides by sodium 
azide, as shown in the first entry of Table 22.3, are reduced to alkylamines by a variety 
of reagents, including lithium aluminum hydride.

Cyano groups in cyanohydrins (see Section 18.7) are reduced under the same reaction 
conditions.
Nitro groups are readily reduced to primary amines by a variety of methods. Catalytic 
hydrogenation over platinum, palladium, or nickel is often used, as is reduction by iron or 
tin in hydrochloric acid. The ease with which nitro groups are reduced is especially useful 
in the preparation of arylamines, where the sequence ArH → ArNO2 → ArNH2 is the 
standard route to these compounds.

Reduction of an azide, a nitrile, or a nitro compound furnishes a primary amine.

Mechanism 22.1 outlines the reduction of amides with lithium aluminum hydride. The 
reduction of amides follows a similar course to the reduction of esters (see Section 20.11). 
A tetrahedral intermediate is formed by the addition of hydride (step 1), and undergoes 
elimination (step 2). In the case of an ester, the alkoxy group is lost to give an inter￾mediate aldehyde. Amides, on the other hand, retain the nitrogen and lose the oxygen 
from the tetrahedral intermediate. The iminium ion formed undergoes addition of a 
second hydride and is reduced to the amine in step 3. Because amides are so easy to 
prepare, this is a versatile method for preparing amines.

The methods described in this section involve the prior synthesis and isolation of 
some reducible material that has a carbon–nitrogen bond: an azide, a nitrile, a nitro￾substituted arene, or an amide. The following section describes a method that combines 
the two steps of carbon–nitrogen bond formation and reduction into a single operation. 
Like the reduction of amides, it offers the possibility of preparing primary, secondary, 
or tertiary amines by proper choice of starting materials.
22.10 Reductive Amination
A class of nitrogen-containing compounds that was omitted from the section just dis￾cussed includes imines and their derivatives. Imines are formed by the reaction of alde￾hydes and ketones with ammonia and primary amines (see Section 18.10). Imines derived 
from ammonia can be reduced to primary amines by catalytic hydrogenation.

The overall reaction converts a carbonyl compound to an amine by carbon–nitrogen bond 
formation and reduction; it is commonly known as reductive amination. What makes 
it a particularly valuable synthetic procedure is that it can be carried out in a single 
operation by hydrogenation of a solution containing both ammonia and the carbonyl 
compound along with a hydrogenation catalyst. The intermediate imine is not isolated 
but undergoes reduction under the conditions of its formation. Also, the reaction is 
broader in scope than implied by the preceding equation. All classes of amines—primary, 
secondary, and tertiary—may be prepared by reductive amination.
When primary amines are desired, the reaction is carried out as just described, 
using ammonia as the nitrogen source.

A variation of the classical reductive amination procedure uses sodium cyanoboro￾hydride (NaBH3CN) instead of hydrogen as the reducing agent and is better suited to amine 
syntheses in which only a few grams of material are needed. All that is required is to add 
sodium cyanoborohydride to an alcohol solution of the carbonyl compound and an amine.

Sodium cyanoborohydride reduces aldehydes and ketones less rapidly than sodium boro￾hydride, but it reduces iminium ions rapidly. To take advantage of this selectivity, reduc￾tive aminations are carried out at mildly acidic pH, where the imines are protonated. 
Iminium ions are also more reactive than imines toward reduction with hydride.
22.11 Reactions of Amines: A Review and a Preview
The most noteworthy properties of amines are their basicity and their nucleophilicity.
The basicity of amines has been discussed in Section 22.4. Several reactions in which 
amines act as nucleophiles have already been encountered in earlier chapters. These are 
summarized in Table 22.4.
Both the basicity and the nucleophilicity of amines originate in the unshared electron 
pair of nitrogen. When an amine acts as a base, this electron pair abstracts a proton from a 
Brønsted acid. When an amine undergoes the reactions summarized in Table 22.4, the first 
step in each case is nucleophilic addition to the positively polarized carbon of a carbonyl group.

In addition to being more basic than arylamines, alkylamines are more nucleo￾philic. All the reactions in Table 22.4 take place faster with alkylamines than with 
arylamines.
The sections that follow introduce some additional reactions of amines. In all cases 
our understanding of how these reactions take place starts with a consideration of the 
role of the unshared electron pair of nitrogen.
We’ll begin with an examination of the reactivity of amines as nucleophiles in SN2 
reactions.

Among the family of amine-derived compounds, quaternary ammonium salts are 
the most different from the others in their properties and applications. We have 
touched on one of these applications earlier in their role as phase-transfer catalysts 
(see Section 22.5). In general, the most commonly encountered quaternary ammonium 
compounds are those derived by alkylation of primary, secondary, or tertiary amines 
with methyl iodide.

In Section 22.13, we’ll see how quaternary ammonium hydroxides are used to

22.13 The Hofmann Elimination
When quaternary ammonium hydroxides are heated, they undergo an E2 β elimination 
to form an alkene and an amine. The quaternary ammonium hydroxide itself is prepared 
by treating the corresponding iodide with an aqueous slurry of silver oxide. Silver iodide 
The reaction of amines with alkyl 
halides was seen in Section 22.7 
as a complicating factor in the 
preparation of amines by alkylation 
of ammonia.918 Chapter 22 Amines

quaternary ammonium hydroxide causes the elimination of trimethylamine.

This reaction is known as the Hofmann elimination; it was developed by August 
W. Hofmann in the middle of the nineteenth century and is both a synthetic method to 
prepare alkenes and an analytical tool for structure determination.
The most useful aspect of the Hofmann elimination is its regioselectivity. Elimination 
in alkyltrimethylammonium hydroxides proceeds in the direction opposite to that of the 
Zaitsev rule (Section 7.10) and favors formation of the less substituted alkene.

The least sterically hindered β hydrogen is removed by the base. Methyl groups are 
deprotonated in preference to methylene groups, and methylene groups are deprotonated 
in preference to methines. Elimination reactions of alkyltrimethylammonium hydroxides 
are said to obey the Hofmann rule; they yield the less substituted alkene.

Methylenecyclopentane has the less substituted double bond and is the major product. The 
observed isomer distribution is 91% methylenecyclopentane and 9% 1-methylcyclopentene.
We can understand the regioselectivity of the Hofmann elimination by comparing 
steric effects in the E2 transition states for formation of 1-butene and trans-2-butene from 
sec-butyltrimethylammonium hydroxide. In terms of its size, (CH3)3N
+
 (trimethylammonio) 
is comparable to (CH3)3C— (tert-butyl). As Figure 22.5 illustrates, the E2 transition state 
requires an anti relationship between the proton that is removed and the trimethylammonio 
group. No serious van der Waals repulsions are evident in the transition state geometry 22.14 Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution in Arylamines 919
for formation of 1-butene. The conformation leading to trans-2-butene, however, is de -
stabilized by van der Waals strain between the trimethylammonio group and a methyl 
group gauche to it. Thus, the activation energy for formation of trans-2-butene exceeds 
that of 1-butene, which becomes the major product because it is formed faster.
With a regioselectivity opposite to that of the Zaitsev rule, the Hofmann elimination 
is sometimes used in synthesis to prepare alkenes not accessible by dehydrohalogenation 
of alkyl halides. This application decreased in importance once the Wittig reaction (see 
Section 18.12) became established as a synthetic method.
22.14 Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution in Arylamines
Arylamines contain two functional groups, the amine group and the aromatic ring; they 
are difunctional compounds. The reactivity of the amine group is affected by its aryl 
substituent, and the reactivity of the ring is affected by its amine substituent. The same 
electron delocalization that reduces the basicity and the nucleophilicity of an arylamine 
nitrogen increases the electron density in the aromatic ring and makes arylamines 
extremely reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution.
The reactivity of arylamines was noted in Section 13.12, where it was pointed out 
that NH2, NHR, and NR2 are ortho, para-directing and exceedingly powerful acti￾vating groups. These substituents are such powerful activators that electrophilic aromatic 
substitution is only rarely performed directly on arylamines.
Direct nitration of aniline and other arylamines fails because oxidation leads to the 
formation of dark-colored “tars.” As a solution to this problem it is standard practice to 
first protect the amino group by acylation with either acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride.

N-Nitroso amines are stabilized by electron delocalization. Write the two most stable

N-Nitroso amines are more often called nitrosamines, and because many of them 
are potent carcinogens, they have been the object of much investigation. We encounter 
nitrosamines in the environment on a daily basis. A few of these, all of which are known 
carcinogens, are:

Nitrosamines are formed whenever nitrosating agents come in contact with secondary 
amines, and more are probably synthesized within our body than enter it by environmental 
contamination. Enzyme-catalyzed reduction of nitrate (NO3
−) produces nitrite (NO2
−), 
which combines with amines present in the body to form N-nitroso amines.
When primary amines are nitrosated, their N-nitroso compounds can’t be isolated 
because they react further.

Aryl diazonium ions, prepared by nitrous acid diazotization of primary arylamines, 
are substantially more stable than alkyl diazonium ions and are of enormous synthetic 
value. Their use in the synthesis of substituted aromatic compounds is described in 
Sections 22.16 and 22.17.
The nitrosation of tertiary alkylamines is rather complicated, and no generally use￾ful chemistry is associated with reactions of this type.
22.16 Nitrosation of Arylamines
We learned in the preceding section that different reactions are observed when the 
various classes of alkylamines—primary, secondary, and tertiary—react with nitro￾sating agents. Although no useful chemistry attends the nitrosation of tertiary alkyl￾amines, electrophilic aromatic substitution by nitrosyl cation ( ) O

Primary arylamines, like primary alkylamines, form diazonium ion salts on nitro￾sation. Whereas alkyl diazonium ions decompose under the conditions of their forma￾tion, aryl diazonium salts are considerably more stable and can be stored in aqueous 
solution at 0–5°C for a reasonable time. Loss of nitrogen from an aryl diazonium ion 
generates an unstable aryl cation and is much slower than loss of nitrogen from an alkyl 
diazonium ion.

Aryl diazonium ions undergo a variety of reactions that make them versatile inter￾mediates for preparing a host of ring-substituted aromatic compounds. In these reactions, 
summarized in Figure 22.6 and discussed individually in Section 22.17, molecular nitro￾gen acts as a leaving group and is replaced by another atom or group. All the reactions 
are regiospecific; the entering group becomes bonded to the same carbon from which 
nitrogen departs.

Diazonium salt chemistry provides the principal synthetic method for the prepara￾tion of aryl fluorides through a process known as the Schiemann reaction. In this

Although it is possible to prepare aryl chlorides and aryl bromides by electrophilic

Because cyano groups may be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids (see Section 20.16), the 
Sandmeyer preparation of aryl nitriles is a key step in the conversion of arylamines to 
substituted benzoic acids. In the example just cited, the o-methylbenzonitrile that was 
formed was subsequently subjected to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to give o-methylbenzoic 
acid in 80–89% yield.
It is possible to replace amino groups on an aromatic ring by hydrogen by reducing 
a diazonium salt with hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) or with ethanol. These reductions

Cumene (isopropylbenzene) is a relatively inexpensive commercially available starting material. 
Show how you could prepare m-isopropylnitrobenzene from cumene.
The value of diazonium salts in synthetic organic chemistry rests on two main 
points. Through the use of diazonium salt chemistry:
1. Substituents that are otherwise accessible only with difficulty, such as fluoro, iodo, 
cyano, and hydroxyl, may be introduced onto a benzene ring.
2. Compounds that have substitution patterns not directly available by electrophilic 
aromatic substitution can be prepared.
The first of these two features is readily apparent and is illustrated by Problems 22.18 
to 22.20. If you have not done these problems yet, you are strongly encouraged to attempt 
them now.
The second point is somewhat less obvious but is illustrated by the synthesis of 
1,3,5-tribromobenzene. This particular substitution pattern cannot be obtained by direct 
bromination of benzene because bromine is an ortho, para director. Instead, advantage 
is taken of the powerful activating and ortho, para-directing effects of the amino group 
in aniline. Bromination of aniline yields 2,4,6-tribromoaniline in quantitative yield. 
Diazotization of the resulting 2,4,6-tribromoaniline and reduction of the diazonium salt 
gives the desired 1,3,5-tribromobenzene.

To exploit the synthetic versatility of aryl diazonium salts, be prepared to reason 
backward. When you see a fluorine attached to a benzene ring, for example, realize that 
it probably will have to be introduced by a Schiemann reaction of an arylamine; realize 
that the required arylamine is derived from a nitroarene, and that the nitro group is 
introduced by nitration. Be aware that an unsubstituted position of a benzene ring need 
not have always been that way. It might once have borne an amino group that was used 
to control the orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions before being 
removed by reductive deamination. The strategy of synthesis is intellectually demanding, 
and a considerable sharpening of your reasoning power can be gained by attacking the 
synthesis problems at the end of each chapter. Use retrosynthetic analysis to plan your 
sequence of accessible intermediates, then fill in the details on how each transformation 
is to be carried out.928 Chapter 22 Amines
22.18 Azo Coupling
A reaction of aryl diazonium salts that does not involve loss of nitrogen takes place when 
they react with phenols and arylamines. Aryl diazonium ions are relatively weak electrophiles 
but have sufficient reactivity to attack strongly activated aromatic rings. The reaction is known 
as azo coupling; two aryl groups are joined together by an azo (NN) function.

The product of this reaction, as with many azo couplings, is highly colored. It is called 
methyl red and was a familiar acid–base indicator before the days of pH meters. It is red 
in solutions of pH 4 and below, yellow above pH 6.
Soon after azo coupling was discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, the reaction 
received major attention as a method for preparing dyes. Azo dyes first became com￾mercially available in the 1870s and remain widely used, with more than 50% of the 
From Dyes to Sulfa Drugs
The medicine cabinet was virtually bare of antibacterial 
agents until sulfa drugs burst on the scene in the 1930s. 
Before sulfa drugs became available, bacterial infection might 
transform a small cut or puncture wound to a life-threatening 
event. The story of how sulfa drugs were developed is an inter￾esting example of being right for the wrong reasons. It was 
known that many bacteria absorbed dyes, and staining was a 
standard method for making bacteria more visible under the 
microscope. Might there not be some dye that is both absorbed 
by bacteria and toxic to them? Acting on this hypothesis, scien￾tists at the German dyestuff manufacturer I. G. Farbenindustrie 
undertook a program to test the thousands of compounds in 
their collection for their antibacterial properties.
In general, in vitro testing of drugs precedes in vivo test￾ing. The two terms mean, respectively, “in glass” and “in life.” In 
vitro testing of antibiotics is carried out using bacterial cultures 
in test tubes or Petri dishes. Drugs that are found to be active in 
vitro progress to the stage of in vivo testing. In vivo testing is 
carried out in living organisms: laboratory animals or human 
volunteers. The I. G. Farben scientists found that some dyes did 
possess antibacterial properties, both in vitro and in vivo. Others 
were active in vitro but were converted to inactive substances in 
vivo and therefore of no use as drugs. Unexpectedly, an azo dye 
called Prontosil was inactive in vitro but active in vivo.
In 1932, a member of the I. G. Farben research group, 
Gerhard Domagk, used Prontosil to treat a young child suffering 
from a serious, potentially fatal staphylococcal infection. Accord￾ing to many accounts, the child was Domagk’s own daughter; 
her infection was cured and her recovery was rapid and com￾plete. Systematic testing followed and Domagk was awarded 
the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology.
In spite of the rationale on which the testing of dyestuffs 
as antibiotics rested, subsequent research revealed that the 
antibacterial properties of Prontosil had nothing at all to do with 
its being a dye! In the body, Prontosil undergoes a reductive 
cleavage of its azo linkage to form sulfanilamide, which is the 
substance actually responsible for the observed biological activ￾ity. This is why Prontosil is active in vivo, but not in vitro.

Dyes are regulated in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Over the years the FDA has removed a number of dyes formerly approved for 
use in food and cosmetics because of concerns about toxicity or cancer-causing potential 
or because they are skin irritants. Naturally occurring pigments, too numerous to count 
(saffron, turmeric, fruit colors, for example), are exempt from the approval process.

Bacteria require p-aminobenzoic acid to biosynthesize folic 
acid, a growth factor. Structurally, sulfanilamide resembles 
p-aminobenzoic acid and is mistaken for it by the bacteria. Folic acid 
biosynthesis is inhibited and bacterial growth is slowed sufficiently to 
allow the body’s natural defenses to effect a cure. Because animals 
do not biosynthesize folic acid but obtain it in their food, sulfanil￾amide halts the growth of bacteria without harm to the host.
Identification of the mechanism by which Prontosil com￾bats bacterial infections was an early triumph of pharmacology, a 
We tend to take the efficacy of modern drugs for

branch of science at the interface of physiology and biochemis￾try that studies the mechanism of drug action. By recognizing 
that sulfanilamide was the active agent, the task of preparing 
structurally modified analogs with potentially superior properties 
was considerably simplified. Instead of preparing Prontosil ana￾logs, chemists synthesized sulfanilamide analogs. They did this 
with a vengeance; over 5000 compounds related to sulfanil￾amide were prepared during the period 1935–1946. Two of the 
most widely used sulfa drugs are sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine.
The sulfa drugs are used less now than they were in the mid￾twentieth century. Not only are more-effective, less-toxic anti￾biotics available, such as the penicillins and tetracyclines, but 
many bacteria that were once susceptible to sulfa drugs have 
become resistant.

have noticed that almost every over-the-counter cold medicine is a red liquid or comes

Yellow #5 is a lemon color; yellow #6 is orange. The highly conjugated azo linkage

the intense absorption of visible light by these molecules. Substituents affect the wave￾lengths absorbed and ultimately the color. Red #40, yellow #5, and yellow #6 all are 
sodium salts of sulfonic acids, which confers on them the water solubility they need to

Infrared: The absorptions of interest in the IR spectra of amines are those associated 
with NH vibrations. Primary alkyl- and arylamines exhibit two peaks in the range

have no NH bonds.

H NMR: Characteristics of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of amines may be 
illustrated by comparing 4-methylbenzylamine (Figure 22.9a) with 4-methylbenzyl alco￾hol (Figure 22.9b). Nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen and so shields neighbor￾ing nuclei to a greater extent. The benzylic methylene group attached to nitrogen in 
4-methyl-benzylamine appears at higher field (δ 3.8) than the benzylic methylene of 
4-methylbenzyl alcohol (δ 4.5). The NH protons are somewhat more shielded than the 
OH protons of an alcohol. In 4-methylbenzylamine the protons of the amino group 
correspond to the signal at δ 1.4, whereas the hydroxyl proton signal of 4-methylbenzyl 
alcohol is found at δ 2.5. The chemical shifts and splittings of amino group protons, like 
those of hydroxyl protons, are variable and are sensitive to solvent, concentration, and 
temperature.

bonded to oxygen, as revealed by comparing the 13C chemical shifts of methylamine and 
methanol.

UV-VIS: In the absence of any other chromophore, the UV-VIS spectrum of an alkyl￾amine is not very informative. The longest wavelength absorption involves promoting 
one of the unshared electrons of nitrogen to an antibonding σ* orbital (n nσ*) with a 
λmax in the relatively inaccessible region near 200 nm. In arylamines the interaction of 
the nitrogen lone pair with the π electron system of the ring shifts the ring’s absorptions 
to longer wavelength. Tying up the lone pair by protonation causes the UV-VIS spectrum 
of anilinium ion to resemble benzene.

Second, nitrogen is exceptionally good at stabilizing adjacent carbocation sites. The

Alkylamines are named in two ways. One method adds the ending -amine to 
the name of the alkyl group. The other applies the principles of substitutive 
nomenclature by replacing the -e ending of an alkane name by -amine and uses 
appropriate locants to identify the position of the amino group. Arylamines are 
named as derivatives of aniline.
Section 22.2 Nitrogen’s unshared electron pair is of major importance in understanding the 
structure and properties of amines. Alkylamines have a pyramidal arrangement 
of bonds to nitrogen, with an unshared electron pair in an sp3
-hybridized 
orbital. The geometry at nitrogen in arylamines is somewhat flatter, and 
the unshared electron pair is delocalized into the π system of the ring. 
Delocalization binds the electron pair more strongly in arylamines than in 
alkylamines. Arylamines are less basic and less nucleophilic than alkylamines.
Section 22.3 Amines are less polar than alcohols. Hydrogen bonding in amines is weaker 
than in alcohols because nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen. Amines 
have lower boiling points than alcohols, but higher boiling points than alkanes. 
Primary amines have higher boiling points than isomeric secondary amines; 
tertiary amines, which cannot form intermolecular hydrogen bonds, have the 
lowest boiling points. Amines resemble alcohols in their solubility in water.
Section 22.4 The basicity of amines is conveniently expressed in terms of the pKa of their 
conjugate acids.

The stronger base is associated with the weaker conjugate acid. The greater the 
pKa of the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. The pKa’s of the conjugate acids 
of alkylamines lie in the 9–11 range. Arylamines are much weaker bases than 
alkylamines. The pKa’s of the conjugate acids of arylamines are usually 3–5. Strong 
electron-withdrawing groups can weaken the basicity of arylamines even more.

Section 22.5 Quaternary ammonium salts, compounds of the type R4N+X−, find application 
as phase-transfer catalysts. A small amount of a quaternary ammonium salt 
promotes the transfer of an anion from aqueous solution, where it is highly 
solvated, to an organic solvent, where it is much less solvated and much more 
reactive.

Alkylation methods
Alkylation of ammonia (Section 22.7) Ammonia 
can act as a nucleophile toward primary and some 
secondary alkyl halides to give primary alkylamines. 
Yields tend to be modest because the primary 
amine is itself a nucleophile and undergoes 
alkylation. Alkylation of ammonia can lead to a 
mixture containing a primary amine, a secondary 
amine, a tertiary amine, and a quaternary 
ammonium salt.

Nitrosation of amines occurs when sodium nitrite 
is added to a solution containing an amine and 
an acid. Primary amines yield alkyl diazonium 
salts. Alkyl diazonium salts are very unstable 
and yield carbocation-derived products. Aryl 
diazonium salts are exceedingly useful synthetic 
intermediates. Their reactions are described

Aldehyde or ketone Secondary amine Enamine Water
When preparing enamines, the reaction is normally carried out by heating in benzene as the 
solvent. No catalyst is necessary, but p-toluenesulfonic acid is sometimes added. The water formed 
is removed by distillation of its azeotropic mixture with benzene, which shifts the position of 
equilibrium to the right to give the enamine in high yield. Conversely, enamines can be hydrolyzed 
in aqueous acid to aldehydes and ketones.
Enamines resemble enols in that electron-pair donation makes their double bond electron￾rich and nucleophilic.

Because nitrogen is a better electron-pair donor than oxygen, an enamine is more nucleophilic 
than an enol. Enamines, being neutral molecules, are, however, less nucleophilic than enolates, 
which are anions.
Reactions of enamines with electrophiles (E+) lead to carbon–carbon bond formation. 
Subsequent hydrolysis gives an α-substituted derivative of the original aldehyde or ketone.

Carbohydrates
The major classes of organic compounds common to living 
things are lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. 
Carbohydrates are very familiar to us—we call many of them 
“sugars.” They make up a substantial portion of the food we 
eat and provide most of the energy that keeps the human engine 
running. Carbohydrates are structural components of the walls 
of plant cells and the wood of trees; they are also major com￾ponents of the exoskeletons of insects, crabs, and lobsters. 
Carbohydrates are found on every cell surface, where they pro￾vide the molecular basis for cell-to-cell communication. Genetic 
information is stored and transferred by way of nucleic acids, 
specialized derivatives of carbohydrates, which we’ll examine 
in more detail in Chapter 26.
Historically, carbohydrates were once considered to be 
“hydrates of carbon” because their molecular formulas in many 
(but not all) cases correspond to Cn(H2O)m. It is more realistic 
to define a carbohydrate as a polyhydroxy aldehyde or poly￾hydroxy ketone, a point of view closer to structural reality and 
more suggestive of chemical reactivity.
This chapter is divided into two parts. The first, and major, 
portion is devoted to carbohydrate structure. You will see how 
the principles of stereochemistry and conformational analysis 
combine to aid our understanding of this complex subject. 
Hummingbirds receive nourishment from flower nectar. Nectar contains 
glucose (shown), fructose, and sucrose.
Daniel Dempster Photography/Alamy Stock Photo23.2 Fischer Projections and d,l Notation 951
The second portion describes chemical reactions of carbohydrates. Most of these reactions 
are simply extensions of what you have already learned concerning alcohols, aldehydes, 
ketones, and acetals. The two areas—structure and reactions—meet in Section 23.20, 
where we consider the role of carbohydrates in the emerging field of glycobiology.
23.1 Classification of Carbohydrates
The Latin word for sugar is saccharum, and the derived term saccharide is the basis of 
a system of carbohydrate classification. A monosaccharide is a simple carbohydrate, 
one that on hydrolysis is not cleaved to smaller carbohydrates. Glucose (C6H12O6), for 
example, is a monosaccharide. A disaccharide on hydrolysis is cleaved to two mono￾saccharides, which may be the same or different. Sucrose—common table sugar—is a 
disaccharide that yields one molecule of glucose and one of fructose on hydrolysis.
Sucrose (C12H22O11) + H2O ⟶ glucose (C6H12O6) + fructose (C6H12O6)
An oligosaccharide (oligos is a Greek word that in its plural form means “few”) 
yields two or more monosaccharides on hydrolysis. Thus, the IUPAC classifies disaccha￾rides, trisaccharides, and so on as subcategories of oligosaccharides.
Polysaccharides are hydrolyzed to “many” monosaccharides. The IUPAC has chosen 
not to specify the number of monosaccharide components that separates oligosaccharides 
from polysaccharides. The standard is a more practical one; it notes that an oligosac￾charide is homogeneous. Each molecule of a particular oligosaccharide has the same 
number of monosaccharide units joined together in the same order as every other molecule 
of the same oligosaccharide. Polysaccharides are almost always mixtures of molecules 
having similar, but not necessarily the same, chain length. Cellulose, for example, is a 
polysaccharide that gives thousands of glucose molecules on hydrolysis, but only a small 
fraction of the cellulose chains contain exactly the same number of glucose units.
Over 200 different monosaccharides are known. They can be grouped according to 
the number of carbon atoms they contain and whether they are polyhydroxy aldehydes 
or polyhydroxy ketones. Monosaccharides that are polyhydroxy aldehydes are called 
aldoses; those that are polyhydroxy ketones are ketoses. Aldoses and ketoses are further 
classified according to the number of carbon atoms in the main chain. Table 23.1 lists 
the terms applied to monosaccharides having four to eight carbon atoms.
23.2 Fischer Projections and d,l Notation
Stereochemistry is the key to understanding carbohydrate structure, a fact that was clearly 
appreciated by the German chemist Emil Fischer. The projection formulas used by Fischer 
to represent stereochemistry in chiral molecules (see Section 4.7) are particularly well-suited 
to carbohydrates. Figure 23.1 illustrates their application to the enantiomers of glyceralde￾hyde (2,3-dihydroxypropanal), a fundamental molecule in carbohydrate stereochemistry. 
When the Fischer projection is oriented as shown in the figure, with the carbon chain 
Sugar is a combination of the Sanskrit 
words su (sweet) and gar (sand). Thus, 
its literal meaning is “sweet sand.”
Fischer determined the structure of 
glucose in 1900 and won the Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry in 1902.

vertical and the aldehyde carbon at the top, the C-2 hydroxyl group points to the right 
in (+)-glyceraldehyde and to the left in (−)-glyceraldehyde.
Techniques for determining the absolute configuration of chiral molecules were not 
developed until the 1950s, and so it was not possible for Fischer and contemporaries 
to  relate the sign of rotation of any substance to its absolute configuration. A system 
evolved based on the arbitrary assumption, later shown to be correct, that the enantiomers 
of glyceraldehyde have the signs of rotation and absolute configurations shown in 
Figure  23.1. Two stereochemical descriptors were defined: d and l: d from the Latin 
(dexter) for right and l (laevus) for left. The absolute configuration of (+)-glyceraldehyde 
was said to be d and that of its enantiomer, (−)-glyceraldehyde, l, as depicted in 
Figure  23.1. Compounds that had a spatial arrangement of substituents analogous to 
(+)-d- or (−)-l-glyceraldehyde were said to have the d or l configurations.

Sample Solution (a) To compare the structure given to glyceraldehyde most easily, turn it 
180° in the plane of the page so that CHO is at the top and CH2OH is at the bottom. Rotation 
in this sense keeps the horizontal bonds pointing forward and the vertical bonds pointing 
back, making it an easy matter to convert the structural drawing to a Fischer projection.

The structure is the same as that of (+)-glyceraldehyde in Figure 23.1. It is d-glyceraldehyde.
Fischer projections and d,l notation have proved to be so helpful in representing 
carbohydrate stereochemistry that the chemical and biochemical literature is replete with 
their use. To read that literature you need to be acquainted with these devices, as well 
as the more modern Cahn–Ingold–Prelog R,S system.
23.3 The Aldotetroses
Glyceraldehyde can be thought of as the simplest chiral carbohydrate. It is an aldotriose
and, because it contains one chirality center, exists in two stereoisomeric forms: the d and l
enantiomers. Moving up the ladder in complexity, next come the aldotetroses. Examining 
Adopting the enantiomers of 
glyceraldehyde as stereochemical 
reference compounds originated with 
proposals made in 1906 by M. A. 
Rosanoff, a chemist at New York 
University.

Relative to each other, both hydroxyl groups are on the same side in Fischer projec￾tions of the erythrose enantiomers. The remaining two stereoisomers have hydroxyl groups 
on opposite sides in their Fischer projections. They are diastereomers of d- and l-erythrose 
and are called d- and l-threose. The d and l prefixes again specify the configuration of 
the highest numbered chirality center. d-Threose and l-threose are enantiomers:

As shown for the aldotetroses, an aldose belongs to the d or the l series according 
to the configuration of the chirality center farthest removed from the aldehyde function. 
23.3 The Aldotetroses 953954 Chapter 23 Carbohydrates
Individual names, such as erythrose and threose, specify the particular arrangement of 
chirality centers within the molecule relative to each other. Optical activities cannot be 
determined directly from the d and l prefixes. As it turns out, both d-erythrose and 
d-threose are levorotatory, but d-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory.
23.4 Aldopentoses and Aldohexoses
Aldopentoses have three chirality centers. The eight stereoisomers are divided into a set 
of four d-aldopentoses and an enantiomeric set of four l-aldopentoses. The aldopentoses 
are named ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose. Fischer projections of the d stereo￾isomers of the aldopentoses are given in Figure 23.2. Notice that all these diastereomers 
have the same configuration at C-4 and that this configuration is analogous to that of 
(+)-d-glyceraldehyde.
Problem 23.3
(+)-l-Arabinose is a naturally occurring l sugar. It is obtained by acid hydrolysis of the 
polysaccharide present in mesquite gum. Write a Fischer projection for (+)-l-arabinose.
Among the aldopentoses, d-ribose is a component of many biologically important 
substances, most notably the ribonucleic acids. d-Xylose is very abundant and is isolated 
by hydrolysis of the polysaccharides present in corncobs and the wood of trees.
The aldohexoses include some of the most familiar of the monosaccharides, as well 
as one of the most abundant organic compounds on Earth, (+)-d-glucose. With four
chirality centers, 16 stereoisomeric aldohexoses are possible; 8 belong to the d series 
and 8 to the l series. All are known, either as naturally occurring substances or as the 
products of synthesis. The eight d-aldohexoses are given in Figure 23.2; the spatial 
arrangement at C-5, hydrogen to the left in a Fischer projection and hydroxyl to the right, 
identifies them as carbohydrates of the d series.
Problem 23.4
Use Figure 23.2 as a guide to help you name the aldose shown. What is the d,l configuration 
at the highest numbered chirality center? The R,S configuration? What is its sign of rotation?

Of all the monosaccharides, (+)-d-glucose is the best known, most important, and 
most abundant. Its formation from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight is the central 
theme of photosynthesis. Carbohydrate formation by photosynthesis is estimated to be 
on the order of 1011 tons per year, a source of stored energy utilized, directly or indirectly, 
by all higher forms of life on the planet. Glucose was isolated from raisins in 1747 and 
by hydrolysis of starch in 1811. Its structure was determined, in work culminating in 
1900, by Emil Fischer.
(+)-d-Galactose is a constituent of numerous polysaccharides. It is best obtained 
by acid hydrolysis of lactose (milk sugar), a disaccharide of d-glucose and d-galactose. 
(−)-l-Galactose also occurs naturally and can be prepared by hydrolysis of flaxseed gum 
Dextrorotatory and levorotatory are 
older terms for (+) and (−) optical 
rotation, respectively.

Cellulose is more abundant than 
glucose, but each cellulose molecule 
is a polysaccharide composed of 
thousands of glucose units 
(Section 23.16). Methane may also be 
more abundant, but most of the 
methane comes from glucose.955

the ivory nut, a large, nut-like seed obtained from a South American palm.
23.5 A Mnemonic for Carbohydrate Configurations
The task of relating carbohydrate configurations to names requires either a world-class 
memory or an easily recalled mnemonic. A mnemonic that serves us well here was pop￾ularized by Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser of Harvard University in their 1956 textbook, 
Organic Chemistry. As with many mnemonics, it’s not clear who actually invented it, and 
references to this particular one appeared in the chemical education literature before pub￾lication of the Fiesers’ text. The mnemonic has two features: (1) a system for setting down 
all the stereoisomeric d-aldohexoses in a logical order; and (2) a way to assign the correct 
name to each one.
A systematic way to set down all the d-aldohexoses (as in Figure 23.2) is to draw 
skeletons of the necessary eight Fischer projections, placing the C-5 hydroxyl group to 
the right in each so as to guarantee that they all belong to the d series. Working up the 
carbon chain, place the C-4 hydroxyl group to the right in the first four structures, and 
to the left in the next four. In each of these two sets of four, place the C-3 hydroxyl 
group to the right in the first two and to the left in the next two; in each of the resulting 
four sets of two, place the C-2 hydroxyl group to the right in the first one and to the left 
in the second.
Once the eight Fischer projections have been written, they are named in order with 
the aid of the sentence “All altruists gladly make gum in gallon tanks.” The words of 
the sentence stand for allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose.
An analogous pattern of configurations can be seen in the aldopentoses when they 
are arranged in the order ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose. (RAXL is an easily remem￾bered nonsense word that gives the correct sequence.) This pattern is discernible even 
in the aldotetroses erythrose and threose.
23.6 Cyclic Forms of Carbohydrates: Furanose Forms
Aldoses incorporate two functional groups, CO and OH, which are capable of reacting 
with each other. We saw in Section 18.8 that nucleophilic addition of an alcohol function 
to a carbonyl group gives a hemiacetal. When the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups are part 
of the same molecule, a cyclic hemiacetal results, as illustrated in Figure 23.3.
Cyclic hemiacetal formation is most common when the ring that results is five- or 
six-membered. Five-membered cyclic hemiacetals of carbohydrates are called furanose 
forms; six-membered ones are called pyranose forms. The ring carbon that is derived 
from the carbonyl group, the one that bears two oxygen substituents, is called the 
anomeric carbon.
Aldoses exist almost exclusively as their cyclic hemiacetals; very little of the 
open-chain form is present at equilibrium. To understand their structures and chemi￾cal reactions, we need to be able to translate Fischer projections of carbohydrates into 
their cyclic hemiacetal forms. Consider first cyclic hemiacetal formation in d-erythrose. 
To visualize furanose ring formation more clearly, redraw the Fischer projection in a 
form more suited to cyclization, being careful to maintain the stereochemistry at each 
chirality center.

Hemiacetal formation between the carbonyl group and the C-4 hydroxyl yields the five￾membered furanose ring form. The anomeric carbon is a new chirality center; its hydroxyl 
group can be either cis or trans to the other hydroxyl groups. The two cyclic forms are 
diastereomers and are referred to as anomers because they have different configurations 
at the anomeric carbon.

Structural drawings of carbohydrates of this type are called Haworth formulas, after 
the British chemist Sir Walter Norman Haworth (St. Andrew’s University and the Univer￾sity of Birmingham). Haworth contributed to the discovery that carbohydrates exist 
as cyclic hemiacetals rather than in open-chain forms. Haworth also collaborated on 
an efficient synthesis of vitamin C from carbohydrate precursors. This was the first 
chemical synthesis of a vitamin and provided an inexpensive route to its preparation 
on a commercial scale. Haworth was a corecipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
in 1937.
The two stereoisomeric furanose forms of d-erythrose are named α-d-erythrofuranose 
and β-d-erythrofuranose. The prefixes α and β describe the relative configuration of 
the anomeric carbon. The configuration of the anomeric carbon is compared with that 
of the highest numbered chirality center in the molecule—the one that determines 
whether the carbohydrate is d or l. Chemists use a simplified, informal version of the 
IUPAC rules for assigning α and β that holds for carbohydrates up to and including 
hexoses.
1. Orient the Haworth formula of the carbohydrate with the ring oxygen at the back 
and the anomeric carbon at the right.
The formal IUPAC rules for α and β
notation in carbohydrates are more

α if its hydroxyl group is down, β if the hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon 
is up.
3. For carbohydrates of the l series, the configuration of the anomeric carbon is α if 
its hydroxyl group is up, β if the hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon is down. 
This is exactly the reverse of the rule for the d series.

Generating Haworth formulas to show stereochemistry in furanose forms of higher 
aldoses is slightly more complicated and requires an additional operation. Furanose forms 
of d-ribose are frequently encountered building blocks in biologically important organic

Notice that the eclipsed conformation of d-ribose derived directly from the Fischer pro￾jection does not have its C-4 hydroxyl group properly oriented for furanose ring forma￾tion. We must redraw it in a conformation that permits the five-membered cyclic 
hemiacetal to form. This is accomplished by rotation about the C(3)C(4) bond, taking 
care that the configuration at C-4 is not changed.23.6 Cyclic Forms of Carbohydrates: Furanose Forms 959

As viewed in the drawing, a 120° counterclockwise rotation of C-4 places its hydroxyl

to a position such that it will become a substituent that is “up” on the five-membered 
ring. The hydrogen at C-4 then will be “down” in the furanose form.

23.7 Cyclic Forms of Carbohydrates: Pyranose Forms
During the discussion of hemiacetal formation in d-ribose in Section 23.6, you may have 
noticed that aldopentoses can potentially form a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal via addition 
of the C-5 hydroxyl to the carbonyl group. This mode of ring closure leads to α- and

Like aldopentoses, aldohexoses such as d-glucose are capable of forming two fura￾nose forms (α and β) and two pyranose forms (α and β). The Haworth representations 
of the pyranose forms of d-glucose are constructed as shown in Figure 23.4; each has a 
CH2OH group as a substituent on the six-membered ring.
Haworth formulas are satisfactory for representing configurational relationships 
in pyranose forms but are uninformative as to carbohydrate conformations. X-ray

All the ring substituents in β-d-glucopyranose are equatorial in the most stable chair 
conformation. Only the anomeric hydroxyl group is axial in the α isomer; all the other 
substituents are equatorial.
Other aldohexoses behave similarly in adopting chair conformations that permit the 
CH2OH substituent to occupy an equatorial orientation. Normally the CH2OH group is the 
bulkiest, most conformationally demanding substituent in the pyranose form of a hexose.
Problem 23.7

Galactose differs from glucose in configuration at C-4. The C-4 hydroxyl is axial in 
β-d-galactopyranose, but it is equatorial in β-d-glucopyranose.
Because six-membered rings are normally less strained than five-membered ones, 
pyranose forms are usually present in greater amounts than furanose forms at equilibrium, 
and the concentration of the open-chain form is quite small. The distribution of 962 Chapter 23 Carbohydrates
carbohydrates among their various hemiacetal forms has been examined by using 1
H and 
13C NMR spectroscopy. In aqueous solution, for example, d-ribose is found to contain the 
various α- and β-furanose and pyranose forms in the amounts shown in Figure 23.5. The 
concentration of the open-chain form at equilibrium is too small to measure directly. Never￾theless, it occupies a central position, in that interconversions of α and β anomers and furanose 
and pyranose forms take place by way of the open-chain form as an intermediate. As will 
be seen later, certain chemical reactions also proceed by way of the open-chain form.
23.8 Mutarotation
The α and β stereoisomeric forms of carbohydrates are capable of independent existence, 
and many have been isolated in pure form as stable, crystalline solids. When crystallized 
from ethanol, for example, d-glucose yields α-d-glucopyranose, mp 146°C, [α]D +112.2°. 
Crystallization from a water–ethanol mixture produces β-d-glucopyranose, mp 148–155°C, 
[α]D +18.7°. In the solid state the two forms do not interconvert and are stable indefinitely. 
Their structures have been unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
The optical rotations just cited for each isomer are those measured immediately 
after each one is dissolved in water. On standing, the rotation of the solution containing 
the α isomer decreases from +112.2° to +52.5°; the rotation of the solution of the 
β isomer increases from +18.7° to the same value of +52.5°. This phenomenon is called 
mutarotation. What is happening is that each solution, initially containing only one 
anomeric form, undergoes equilibration to the same mixture of α- and β-pyranose forms. 
The open-chain form is an intermediate in the process.

the role of the acid catalyst. The combination of step 2 (ring-opening) and step 3 (ring￾closing) reverses the configuration at the anomeric carbon. All the steps are reversible and 
the α/β ratio is governed by the relative energies of the two diastereomers.
The distribution between the α- and β-pyranose forms at equilibrium can be calcu￾lated from the optical rotations of the pure isomers and the final optical rotation of the 
solution. For d-glucose, such a calculation gives 36% α and 64% β. These are close to 
the values (38.8% and 60.9%, respectively) obtained by 13C NMR measurements. The 
α- and β-furanoses and the hydrate of the open-chain form comprise the remaining 0.3%.
Problem 23.8
The specific optical rotations of pure α- and β-d-mannopyranose are +29.3° and −17.0°, 
respectively. When either form is dissolved in water, mutarotation occurs, and the observed 
rotation of the solution changes until a final rotation of +14.2° is observed. Assuming that only 
α- and β-pyranose forms are present, calculate the percent of each isomer at equilibrium.
It is not possible to tell by inspection which pyranose form of a particular carbohydrate— 
α or β—predominates at equilibrium. As just described, the β-pyranose is the major species 
present in an aqueous solution of d-glucose, whereas the α-pyranose predominates in a 
solution of d-mannose (Problem 23.8). In certain other carbohydrates, d-ribose for example, 
furanose and pyranose forms are both well represented at equilibrium (Figure 23.5).

The factors that control the equilibrium composition of sugars in solution are com￾plex. Although the well-established preference for substituents in six-membered rings to 
be equatorial rather than axial is important, it is not always the overriding factor. 
Section 23.9 introduces a new structural feature that plays a significant part in determin￾ing carbohydrate conformations and α/β anomeric ratios.
23.9 Carbohydrate Conformation: The Anomeric Effect
Not only does carbohydrate structure affect properties such as chemical reactivity, but 
the structure and shape of carbohydrates are also major factors in a number of biological 
processes that depend on interactions between molecules—a phenomenon known as 
molecular recognition. In this section, we will consider mainly the conformations of 
carbohydrates in their pyranose forms. We will return to some familiar concepts of chair 
conformations and axial versus equatorial groups, but you will see that the presence of 
an oxygen atom in a six-membered ring leads to some surprising consequences.
The 1969 Nobel Laureate for Chemistry, University of Oslo professor Odd Hassel, 
was the first to suggest that the pyranose form of carbohydrates would resemble chair 
cyclohexane. Replacing a carbon atom in the ring with an oxygen does not change the 
basic preference for chair forms, even though the pyranose ring has unequal bond lengths. 
However, in addition to the usual factors that govern the equatorial versus axial orientation 
of substituents on a six-membered ring, two other factors are important:
1. an equatorial OH is less crowded and better solvated by water than an axial one
2. the anomeric effect23.9 Carbohydrate Conformation: The Anomeric Effect 965
The first of these is straightforward and alerts us to the fact that the relative ener￾gies of two species may be different in solution than in the solid state or the gas phase. 
Hydrogen bonding to water stabilizes equatorial OH groups better than axial ones.
The anomeric effect, on the other hand, stabilizes axial OH and other electro￾negative groups at the anomeric carbon in pyranose rings better than equatorial. Con￾sider the mutarotation of glucose just described, which produces an equilibrium mixture 
containing 36% of the α-anomer and 64% of the β. If we consider only the destabilizing 
effect of a solvated axial hydroxyl group in the axial position, we would expect only 
11% α and 89% β. The presence of more axial hydroxyl than expected results from the 
contribution of the anomeric effect to the free energy difference between these two 
stereoisomers.
The anomeric effect also influences the conformational equilibria in pyranoses 
with an electronegative atom, usually oxygen or halogen, at C-l. For example, the 
equilibrium mixture of the β-pyranosyl chloride derived from xylose triacetate contains 
98% of the conformer in which chlorine is axial. These two conformations are not 
interconverted by mutarotation but by chair–chair interconversion. The anomeric effect 
is sufficiently large so that all four substituents occupy axial positions in the more 
stable conformer.

What is responsible for the anomeric effect? Chemists continue to debate this ques￾tion, and a number of explanations have emerged, one of which is detailed in Figure 23.6. 
The structure depicted in (a), in which substituent X is axial, is stabilized by the interac￾tion of an unshared electron pair on the ring oxygen with the antibonding σ* orbital 
(LUMO) of the CX bond [(b)]. This interaction is greater when X is axial and anti 
coplanar to the nonbonding electron pair than it is when X is equatorial (c). The transfer 
of electron density toward the anomeric carbon is facilitated when X is an electronegative 
substituent, so the effect is often seen in pyranoses with oxygen or halogen at the ano￾meric carbon. This model also accounts for the shortening of the OC-l bond seen in 
pyranoses that bear an axial electronegative substituent at the anomeric carbon.
Because five-membered rings are more flexible than six-membered, the anomeric 
effect is less important in furanose than in pyranose forms.

where X and Y are electronegative and Y has at least one unshared pair. Of the conforma￾tions about the YC bond, gauche is normally more stable than anti.

23.10 Ketoses
To this point our attention has been directed toward aldoses, carbohydrates having an aldehyde 
function in their open-chain form. Aldoses are more common than ketoses, and their role in 
biological processes has been more thoroughly studied. Nevertheless, a large number of 
ketoses are known, and several of them are pivotal intermediates in carbohydrate biosynthesis 
and metabolism. Examples of some ketoses include d-ribulose, l-xylulose, and d-fructose:

In all three the carbonyl group is at C-2, which is the most common case for naturally

which energy from sunlight drives the formation of d-glucose from carbon dioxide and 
water. l-Xylulose is a product of the abnormal metabolism of xylitol in persons who lack 
a particular enzyme. d-Fructose is the most familiar ketose; it is present in fruits and 
honey and is sweeter than sucrose.

Ketoses, like aldoses, exist mainly as cyclic hemiacetals. In the case of d-ribulose,

The anomeric carbon of a furanose or pyranose form of a ketose bears both a hydroxyl 
group and a carbon substituent. In the case of 2-ketoses, this substituent is a CH2OH 
group. As with aldoses, the anomeric carbon of a cyclic hemiacetal is readily identifiable 
because it is bonded to two oxygens.
Problem 23.12
Use the method outlined in Figure 23.4 to write a Haworth formula for the β-furanose form of 
d-fructose.
23.11 Deoxy Sugars
A common variation on the general pattern seen in carbohydrate structure is the replace￾ment of one or more of the hydroxyl substituents by some other atom or group. In deoxy 
sugars the hydroxyl group is replaced by hydrogen. Two examples of deoxy sugars are 
2-deoxy-d-ribose and l-fucose:

The hydroxyl at C-2 in d-ribose is absent in 2-deoxy-d-ribose. In Chapter 26 we shall 
see how derivatives of 2-deoxy-d-ribose, called deoxyribonucleotides, are the funda￾mental building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the material responsible for 
storing genetic information. l-Fucose, the carbon chain of which terminates in a 
methyl rather than a CH2OH group, is often found as one of the carbohydrates in 
glycoproteins, such as those on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood 
type (see Section 23.20).

23.12 Amino Sugars
Another structural variation is the replacement of a hydroxyl group in a carbohydrate by 
an amino group to give an amino sugar. The most abundant amino sugar is one of the 
oldest and most abundant organic compounds on Earth. N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine is the 
main component of the polysaccharide in chitin, the substance that makes up the tough 
outer skeleton of arthropods and insects. Chitin has been isolated from a 25-million-year￾old beetle fossil, and more than 1011 tons of chitin is produced in the biosphere each year. 
Lobster shells, for example, are mainly chitin (Figure 23.7). More than 60 amino sugars 
are known, many of them having been isolated and identified only recently as compo￾nents of antibiotics. The anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), for 
example, contains the amino sugar l-daunosamine as one of its structural units.

We’ve included N-acetylneuraminic acid in the section on amino sugars and described it as a 
ketose. We could also call it a deoxy sugar. Locate reasons for these classifications in the

configuration (d or l) at the highest numbered chirality center?
Nitrogen-containing sugars in which nitrogen replaces the ring oxygen are known 
as imino sugars. An example of an imino sugar is nojirimicin, which occurs naturally. 
A synthetic derivative, N-butyl-1-deoxynojirimicin, is used in the treatment of a lipid 
metabolism disorder known as Gaucher’s disease.

antibiotic that has emerged as one of only a few that are effective against drug-resistant 
bacteria. l-Vancosamine is not only a branched-chain carbohydrate, it is a deoxy sugar 
and an amino sugar as well.
23.14 Glycosides: The Fischer Glycosidation
Glycosides are a large and important class of carbohydrate derivatives characterized by 
the replacement of the anomeric hydroxyl group by some other substituent. Glycosides 
are termed O-glycosides when the atom attached to the anomeric carbon is oxygen. If 
the atom is sulfur, the names S-glycoside and thioglycoside are both used. Glycosides in 
which the atom attached to the anomeric carbon is nitrogen are named as glycosylamines.

Linamarin Adenosine Sinigrin
Linamarin is an O-glycoside of d-glucose and acetone cyanohydrin. It is present in 
manioc (cassava), a tuberous food plant, and is just one of many cyanogenic glycosides. 
Nucleosides such as adenosine are glycosylamines of heterocyclic aromatic compounds. 
The most important ones are those derived from d-ribose and 2-deoxy-d-ribose. Sinigrin 
is an S-glycoside that contributes to the characteristic flavor of mustard and horseradish. 
All three of the glycosides shown have the β configuration at their anomeric carbon. 
Many antibiotics occur as glycosides. The most common are O-glycosides, such as eryth￾romycin (see Figure 19.7).
The term glycoside without a prefix is taken to mean an O-glycoside. O-Glycosides 
bear an alkoxy group OR instead of OH at the anomeric carbon. Structurally, 
they are mixed acetals. Recall the sequence of intermediates in acetal formation (see 
Section 18.8):

4-Hydroxybutanal Cyclic hemiacetal Acetal
In this illustration only a five-membered cyclic hemiacetal, analogous to the furanose form 
of a carbohydrate, is possible from the γ-hydroxy aldehyde. The final acetal is analogous to 
a glycoside; in this case, a furanoside. The corresponding products from an aldehyde with 
a δ OH group would be a pyranose (cyclic hemiacetal) and a pyranoside (acetal).
In a reaction known as the Fischer glycosidation, glycosides are prepared by sim￾ply allowing a carbohydrate to react with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. 
The reaction is thermodynamically controlled, and the major product is the most stable 
glycoside; for the reaction of d-glucose with methanol this is methyl α-d-glucopyranoside. 
Six-membered rings are more stable than five-membered ones, and the anomeric effect 
stabilizes an axial OCH3 group.

Write structural formulas for the α- and β-methyl pyranosides formed by reaction of d-galactose 
with methanol in the presence of hydrogen chloride.
Experimental observations suggest that the methyl glycosides are formed by more 
than one mechanism and can involve formation of a hemiacetal, acetal, or oxonium ion 
as an intermediate, followed by its cyclization. For the reaction of d-glucose with methanol 
these key intermediates are:

Cyclization can lead to the α- or β-furanoside or α- or β-pyranoside. The furanosides are 
the kinetic products of the Fischer glycosidation and can be isolated if the reaction is 
stopped prior to equilibrium. Mechanism 23.2 describes the initial formation of the methyl 
hemiacetal of d-glucose and its cyclization to a mixture of methyl α-d-glucopyranoside 
and its β anomer.
A process similar to that of Mechanism 23.2 involving the OH group at C-4 
gives the methyl α- and β-furanosides. These then undergo subsequent conversion to the 
more stable pyranosides by a mechanism not requiring reversion to d-glucose itself.23.14 Glycosides: The Fischer Glycosidation 971

In spite of its mechanistic complexity, equilibrium is established rapidly thereby 
making the Fischer glycosidation a reliable method for converting a carbohydrate to its 
O-glycoside. Once formed, O-glycosides are useful intermediates in the synthesis of a 
variety of carbohydrate structural types by suitable manipulation of the remaining 
hydroxyl groups.
Glycosides, like other acetals, are stable in base but undergo hydrolysis in aqueous 
acid. The products of hydrolysis of an alkyl glycoside are an alcohol and a carbohydrate. 
Hydrolysis of methyl β-l-nogaloside, for example, gives l-nogalose, which is a branched￾chain carbohydrate found in the antibiotic nogalamycin. Note that the methyl glycoside 
is hydrolyzed selectively; the three methyl ethers remain intact.

23.15 Disaccharides
Disaccharides are carbohydrates that yield two monosaccharide molecules on hydrolysis. 
Structurally, disaccharides are glycosides in which the alkoxy group attached to the ano￾meric carbon is derived from a second sugar molecule.
Maltose, obtained by the hydrolysis of starch, and cellobiose, by the hydrolysis of 
cellulose, are isomeric disaccharides. In both maltose and cellobiose two d-glucopyranose 
units are joined by a glycosidic bond between C-1 of one unit and C-4 of the other. The 
two are diastereomers, differing only in the stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon of 
the glycosidic bond; maltose is an α-glycoside, cellobiose is a β-glycoside.

The stereochemistry and points of connection of glycosidic bonds are commonly 
designated by symbols such as α-(1→4) for maltose and β-(1→4) for cellobiose; α and 
β designate the stereochemistry at the anomeric position; the numerals specify the ring 
carbons involved.
Both maltose and cellobiose have a free anomeric hydroxyl group that is not 
involved in a glycosidic bond. The configuration at the free anomeric center is variable 
and may be either α or β. Indeed, two stereoisomeric forms of maltose have been isolated: 
one has its anomeric hydroxyl group in an equatorial orientation; the other has an axial 
anomeric hydroxyl.
Problem 23.19
The two stereoisomeric forms of maltose just mentioned undergo mutarotation when 
dissolved in water. What is the structure of the key intermediate in this process?
The single difference in their structures, the stereochemistry of the glycosidic 
bond, causes maltose and cellobiose to differ significantly in their three-dimensional 
shape, as the molecular models of Figure 23.8 illustrate. This difference in shape 974 Chapter 23 Carbohydrates
affects how maltose and cellobiose interact with other chiral molecules such as pro￾teins, causing them to behave much differently toward enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. 
The enzyme maltase catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the α-glycosidic bond of 
maltose but not the β-glycosidic bond of cellobiose. A different enzyme, emulsin,
produces the opposite result: emulsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of cellobiose but not 
maltose. The behavior of each enzyme is general for glucosides (glycosides of glu￾cose). Maltase catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-glucosides and is also known as 
α-glucosidase, whereas emulsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-glucosides and is known 
as β-glucosidase. The specificity of these enzymes offers a useful tool for structure 
determination because it allows the stereochemistry of glycosidic linkages to be 
assigned.
Lactose is a disaccharide constituting 2–6% of milk and is known as milk sugar. 
It differs from maltose and cellobiose in that only one of its monosaccharide units is 
d-glucose. The other monosaccharide unit, the one that contributes its anomeric carbon 
to the glycosidic bond, is d-galactose. Like cellobiose, lactose is a β-glycoside.

Digestion of lactose is facilitated by the β-glycosidase lactase. A deficiency of this 
enzyme makes it difficult to digest lactose and causes abdominal discomfort. Lactose 
intolerance is a genetic trait; it is treatable through over-the-counter formulations of 
lactase and by limiting the amount of milk in the diet.
The most familiar of all the carbohydrates is sucrose—common table sugar. Sucrose 
is a disaccharide in which d-glucose and d-fructose are joined at their anomeric carbons 
by a glycosidic bond.

cellobiose. Maltose and cellobiose 
are diastereomers.23.16 Polysaccharides 975
Its chemical composition is the same irrespective of its source; sucrose from cane and 
sucrose from sugar beets are identical. Because sucrose does not have a free anomeric 
hydroxyl group, it does not undergo mutarotation. Hydrolysis of sucrose, catalyzed either 
by acid or by the enzyme invertase, gives a 1:1 mixture of d-glucose and d-fructose, 
which is sweeter than sucrose. The mixture prepared this way is called “invert sugar” 
because the sign of rotation of the aqueous solution in which it is carried out “inverts” 
from + to − as sucrose is converted to the glucose–fructose mixture.
23.16 Polysaccharides
Cellulose is the principal structural component of vegetable matter. Wood is 30–40% 
cellulose, cotton over 90%. Photosynthesis in plants is responsible for the formation of 
at least 100 billion tons per year of cellulose. Structurally, cellulose is a polysaccharide 
composed of d-glucose units joined by β-(1→4)-glycosidic linkages (Figure 23.9). The 
average is 7000 glucose units, but can be as many as 12,000. Complete hydrolysis of all 
the glycosidic bonds of cellulose yields d-glucose. The disaccharide fraction that results 
from partial hydrolysis is cellobiose.
As Figure 23.9 shows, the glucose units of cellulose are turned with respect to each 
other. The overall shape of the chain, however, is close to linear. Consequently, neighbor￾ing chains can pack together in bundles where networks of hydrogen bonds stabilize the 
structure and impart strength to cellulose fibers.
Animals lack the enzymes necessary to catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulose and so 
can’t digest it. Cattle and other ruminants use cellulose as a food source indirectly. 
Colonies of bacteria that live in their digestive tract consume cellulose and in the process 
convert it to other substances that the animal can digest.
A more direct source of energy for animals is provided by the starches found in 
many plants. Starch is a mixture containing about 20% of a water-dispersible fraction 
called amylose and 80% of a second component, amylopectin.
Like cellulose, amylose is a polysaccharide of d-glucose. However, unlike cel￾lulose in which all of the glycosidic linkages are β, all of the linkages in amylose are α. 
The small change in stereochemistry between cellulose and amylose creates a large 
difference in their overall shape and in their properties. Some of this difference can 
be seen in the structure of a short portion of amylose in Figure 23.10. The presence 
of the α-glycosidic linkages imparts a twist to the amylose chain. Where the main 
chain is roughly linear in cellulose, it is helical in amylose. Attractive forces between
chains are weaker in amylose, and amylose does not form the same kind of strong 
fibers that cellulose does.

Figure 23.9
Cellulose is a polysaccharide in which 
d-glucose units are connected by 
β-(1→4)-glycosidic linkages analogous 
to cellobiose. Hydrogen bonding, 
especially between the C-2 and C-6 
hydroxyl groups, causes adjacent 
glucose units to tilt at an angle of 180°
with each other.976 Chapter 23 Carbohydrates
Amylopectin resembles amylose in being a polysaccharide built on a framework 
of α-(1→4)-linked d-glucose units. In addition to this main framework, however, 
amylose incorporates polysaccharide branches of 24–30 glucose units joined by 
α-(1→4)-glycosidic bonds. These branches sprout from C-6 of glucose units at vari￾ous points along the main framework, connected to it by α-(1→6)-glycosidic bonds 
(Figure 23.11).
One of the most important differences between cellulose and starch is that animals 
can digest starch. Because the glycosidic linkages in starch are α, an animal’s α-glycosidase 
enzymes can catalyze their hydrolysis to glucose. When more glucose is available than 
is needed as fuel, animals store some of it as glycogen. Glycogen resembles amylopectin 
in that it is a branched polysaccharide of α-(1→4)-linked d-glucose units with branches 
connected to C-6 of the main chain. The frequency of such branches is greater in glycogen 
than in amylopectin.

How Sweet It Is!
How sweet is it?
There is no shortage of compounds, natural or synthetic, 
that taste sweet. The most familiar, sucrose, glucose, and fruc￾tose, all occur naturally with worldwide production of sucrose 
Among sucrose, glucose, and fructose, fructose is the sweet￾est. Honey is sweeter than table sugar because it contains fruc￾tose formed by the isomerization of glucose as shown in the 
equation.
You may have noticed that most soft drinks contain “high￾fructose corn syrup.” Corn starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which 
is then treated with glucose isomerase to produce a fructose-rich 
All of these are hundreds of times sweeter than sucrose and 
variously described as “low-calorie” or “nonnutritive” sweeteners.
Saccharin was discovered at Johns Hopkins University in 
1879 in the course of research on coal-tar derivatives and is the 
oldest artificial sweetener. In spite of its name, which comes 
from the Latin word for sugar, saccharin bears no structural rela￾tionship to any sugar. Nor is saccharin itself very soluble in water. 
The proton bonded to nitrogen, however, is fairly acidic and sac￾charin is normally marketed as its water-soluble sodium or cal￾cium salt. Its earliest applications were not in weight control, but 
as a replacement for sugar in the diet of diabetics before insulin 
became widely available.

mixture. The enhanced sweetness permits less to be used, 
reducing the cost of production. Using less carbohydrate-based 
sweetener also reduces the number of calories.
Artificial sweeteners are a billion-dollar-per-year industry. 
The primary goal is to maximize sweetness and minimize calories. 
We’ll look at the following sweeteners to give us an overview of 
the field.
Sucralose has the structure most similar to sucrose. Galac￾tose replaces the glucose unit of sucrose, and chlorines replace 
three of the hydroxyl groups. The three chlorine substituents do 
not diminish sweetness, but do interfere with the ability of the 
body to metabolize sucralose. It, therefore, has no food value 
and is “noncaloric.”
Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide, unrelated to 
any carbohydrate. An aspartame relative, neotame, is even 
sweeter.
Saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame illustrate the diversity 
of structural types that taste sweet, and the vitality and continu￾ing development of the industry of which they are a part.978 Chapter 23 Carbohydrates
23.17 Application of Familiar Reactions 
to Monosaccharides
In our discussion of carbohydrate structure to this point, we have already encountered 
an important reaction—the formation of glycosides under acid-catalyzed conditions (see 
Section 23.14). Glycoside formation draws our attention to the fact that an OH group on 
the anomeric carbon of a pyranose or furanose differs in reactivity from the other 
hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate. It also demonstrates that what looks like a new 
reaction is one that we’ve encountered before—in this case, acetal formation that occurs 
in the reactions of alcohols with aldehydes and ketones (see Section 18.8). Many other 
reactions of carbohydrates are also related to familiar functional-group transformations; 
some of these are recounted in Table 23.2.
The first two entries in Table 23.2 illustrate reactions that involve nucleophilic 
addition to the carbonyl group of the open-chain form which, although present in small 
amounts, is continuously replenished as it reacts. Entry 1 is the sodium borohydride 
reduction of the carbonyl group of the aldose d-galactose. The reaction is a general one; 
other reducing agents may be used, and the product from reduction of either an aldose 
or ketose is called an alditol. Alditols lack a carbonyl group and exist entirely in open￾chain forms.
Problem 23.20
Reduction of the ketose d-fructose gives two alditols on 
reduction. Which two are they?
Entry 2 is cyanohydrin formation by nucleophilic addition of HCN to the carbonyl 
group. It is the basis of a synthetic method for extending the carbon chain of an aldose. 
In the example shown in Table 23.2 the two diastereomeric cyanohydrins derived from 
l-arabinose were separated, and their CN groups converted to CHO to yield 
l-mannose and l-glucose, as shown below for one of the diastereomers. In this conver￾sion, the nitrile group is first reduced to an imine (CNH), which is then hydrolyzed 
to the aldehyde. The sequence extends the chain of l-arabinose, a pentose, to that of 
l-glucose, a hexose.

Entries 3 and 4 are acylation and alkylation, respectively, of hydroxyl groups. 
Entry  3 shows the formation of a pentaacetate on reaction of α-d-glucopyranose with 
acetic anhydride, and entry 4 shows the formation of a tetrabenzyl ether on reaction of 
methyl α-d-glucopyranoside with benzyl chloride. Benzyl ethers are stable to acid and 
base hydrolysis, organometallic reagents, and numerous other reaction conditions and are 
often used to protect OH groups during synthetic operations. They are usually removed 
by hydrogenolysis, a reaction in which catalytic hydrogenation cleaves the C6H5CH2O 
bond of a benzyl ether.

In Section 18.9 we explored the use of diols to protect carbonyl groups. Entry 5 
shows how carbohydrates can function as the diol component in forming a cyclic acetal 
from benzaldehyde, thereby protecting two of the carbohydrate’s hydroxyl groups. This 
is yet another example of acetal formation, in this case involving the aldehyde group of 
benzaldehyde and the C-4 and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the carbohydrate.
Entry 6 reminds us that the furanose and pyranose forms of carbohydrates are 
specialized examples of hemiacetals and capable of interconversion. Entries 7 and 8 
connect enolization of the open-chain form to interconversion of C-2 epimers. Entry 9 
illustrates another reaction involving the enol of the open-chain form. Here, the enediol 
intermediate connects aldose and ketose isomers. In entry 10, an enzyme-catalyzed 
reverse aldol reaction cleaves a 6-carbon chain to two 3-carbon fragments.
Most monosaccharides bear an oxidizable function on every carbon so their oxida￾tion is more complicated than others we have seen and is discussed separately in 
Section 23.18.

The formation of a red precipitate of copper(I) oxide by reduction of Cu(II) is taken

reagent are termed reducing sugars.
Aldoses are reducing sugars, since they possess an aldehyde function in their open￾chain form. Ketoses are also reducing sugars. Under the conditions of the test, ketoses 
equilibrate with aldoses by way of enediol intermediates, and the aldoses are oxidized 
by the reagent.

and will not give a positive test with Benedict’s reagent.
The most easily oxidized groups in an aldose are the aldehyde at one end and the

23.19 Glycosides: Synthesis of Oligosaccharides
As we saw in Section 23.14, the preparation of glycosides by acid-catalyzed condensation 
of a carbohydrate with a simple alcohol—the Fischer glycosidation—is thermodynamically 
controlled and favors the formation of pyranose over furanose rings. The anomeric effect 
causes the α stereoisomer to predominate over the β.

When the desired glycoside is a disaccharide, however, the “alcohol” is no longer simple; 
it is a carbohydrate with more than one OH group capable of bonding to the anomeric 
carbon of the other carbohydrate. Thus, constitutionally isomeric as well as stereoisomeric 
pyranosides are possible.
Consider, for example, a disaccharide such as gentiobiose in which both carbohydrate 
units are pyranosyl forms of d-glucose. Using the notation introduced in Section 23.15, 
gentiobiose is a β-(1→6) glycoside. An oxygen atom is bonded to the anomeric carbon of 
one d-glucopyranose and C-6 of a second d-glucopyranose.

Although the stereochemistry of the glycosidic linkage is a concern, the first problem to 
be addressed in a chemical synthesis of a disaccharide such as gentiobiose is achieving 
the desired 1→6 connectivity. The general strategy involves three stages:
1. Preparation of a suitably protected glycosyl donor and glycosyl acceptor. A 
glycosyl donor contains a leaving group at the anomeric carbon. The glycosyl 
acceptor contains a nucleophilic group, hydroxyl in this case, at the desired 
carbon.
2. Formation of the glycosidic CO bond by a nucleophilic substitution in which an 
OH group of the glycosyl acceptor acts as the nucleophile toward the anomeric 
carbon of the glycosyl donor.
3. Removal of the protecting groups from the protected disaccharide formed in 
stage 2.
The glycosyl donor in the synthesis of gentiobiose is 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl￾α-d-glucopyranosyl bromide. It is prepared by treating d-glucose with benzoyl chlo￾ride in pyridine, then hydrogen bromide. This reaction places a bromide leaving 
group on the anomeric carbon and protects the four remaining OH groups as 
benzoate esters. Like the Fischer glycosylation, the α stereochemistry at the ano￾meric  carbon results from thermodynamic control. The glycosyl acceptor is methyl 
2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, in which all of the hydroxyl groups are 
protected except the one at C-6.
Gentiobiose occurs naturally and has 
been isolated from gentian root, 
saffron, and numerous other plant 
materials. For more, see the boxed 
essay Crocuses Make Saffron from

Coupling of the glycosyl donor and acceptor takes place in the presence of silver tri￾fluoromethanesulfonate (AgOSO2CF3) as a source of Ag+, which activates the pyranosyl

the ester protecting groups and hydrolysis of the methyl glycoside are required to complete 
the synthesis of gentiobiose.
The mechanism of the coupling reaction resembles an SN1 reaction and begins with 
a silver-ion-assisted ionization of the carbon–bromine bond of the glycosyl donor to give 
a carbocation (Mechanism 23.3).
This method of silver-assisted 
glycoside synthesis is a variation of 
the Koenigs–Knorr reaction. William 
Koenigs and Edward Knorr first 
reported their method in 1901.

The synthesis of di- and trisaccharides was considered a major achievement, until 
the advent of new synthetic methods made it possible to construct more complex oligo￾saccharides, such as those found on cell surfaces. In 2017, an oligosaccharide component 
of the tuberculosis bacterium’s cell wall was synthesized. The 92-sugar product, called 
an arabinogalactan, is the largest, most complex oligosaccharide synthesized to date. 
Advances in oligosaccharide synthesis are critical to the development of emerging areas 
of research in carbohydrate chemistry and biology. An exciting new area is glycobiology,
described next in Section 23.20.
23.20 Glycobiology
In the early to mid twentieth century, the study of carbohydrates concentrated on their 
role in energy production. Although a chemical linkage between carbohydrates and pro￾teins was discovered in the late nineteenth century, the term “glycoconjugates” was not

Hans Adolf Krebs was awarded half of 
the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine for the discovery of the citric 
acid cycle.

coined until the early 1970s. The study of the carbohydrates that occur with these 
conjugates is the subject of the field of glycobiology. A related term, glycomics, refers 
to the study of the complete set of carbohydrates in an organism and their genetic, 
physiological, and pathological roles. Part of the difficulty in studying these substances 
is the inherent structural complexity. Two d-glucopyranose molecules, for example, can 
be joined to form 11 different disaccharides. Although the complexity of oligosaccha￾rides hampers their chemical synthesis, it allows them to serve highly diverse roles in 
organisms.
Glycoconjugates are widely distributed in living systems. Almost all of human plasma 
proteins are glycosylated. The outer surfaces of cells and plasma membranes are decorated 
with oligosaccharides attached to both protein and lipid sources, which are collectively 
referred to as the “glycocalyx.” Bacteria cell walls are particularly dense in glycoproteins 
and glycolipids. The oligosaccharides of cell walls and membranes are important in cell–
cell recognition, cell migration, and interaction with cells of the immune system. There is 
recent evidence that the composition of the glycocalyx is altered in some cancer cells, 
which can allow the cancer cells to evade the immune system and make them resistant to 
immunotherapy. Paradoxically, some glycoproteins, referred to as “tumor-associated anti￾gens,” are more highly expressed on the surface of cancer cells and may be exploited for 
targeted chemotherapy.
One example of the informational role of cell-surface carbohydrates occurs in 
the distinctions among human blood groups. The structure of the glycoproteins attached 
to the surface of blood cells determines whether the blood is type A, B, AB, or O. Dif￾ferences among the carbohydrate components of the various glycoproteins have been 
identified and are shown in Figure 23.12. Compatibility of blood types is dictated by 
antigen–antibody interactions. The cell-surface glycoproteins are antigens. Antibodies 
present in certain blood types can cause the blood cells of certain other types to clump 
together, and thus set practical limitations on transfusion procedures. The antibodies 
recognize the antigens they act on by their terminal saccharide units.
Differences in the oligosaccharide composition of bacteria and humans have been 
exploited in the creation of vaccines. For example, many bacteria are decorated with 
capsular polysaccharides (CPS), which are long polysaccharide chains from the surface 
of the virulent bacteria. The CPS need to possess an exposed antigenic determinant that 
Edward Jenner, an English physician, 
is credited with the development of a 
vaccine for smallpox in the 1790s. 
Louis Pasteur developed a vaccine 
against anthrax for use in cattle in the 
1870s and coined the term vaccine
from the Latin vacca for cow, in

An important oligosaccharide used in medicine is the drug heparin, which is a 
linear polysaccharide of repeating sulfated glucosamine and uronic acid disaccharide 
units. Heparin is an anticoagulant drug used to prevent blood from clotting. Without 
heparin, many procedures in modern medicine would be impossible, since it would be 
impossible to keep blood fluid once it was removed from the human body in procedures 
like heart–lung oxygenation or kidney dialysis. Heparin is a natural product commonly 
prepared from animal tissues such as cow lung and pig intestines.
Recently organic and medicinal chemists have begun to prepare heparin oligosac￾charides and polysaccharides through chemoenzymatic synthesis. In one such synthesis, 
a heparin dodecasaccharide (12 sugar residues) was prepared with anticoagulant activity 
for preclinical evaluation in a primate model. This synthesis was accomplished using a 
combination of chemical and enzymatic methods and afforded gram quantities of the 
desired dodecasaccharide shown in Figure 23.13 in 22 steps at 10% overall yield and in 
98% purity.
New drugs to treat influenza were developed based on an understanding of the 
importance of cell-surface oligosaccharides in the life cycle of the viron. After infect￾ing and replicating within a mammalian cell, the influenza virus produces an enzyme 
called neuraminidase (NA). NA cleaves N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) residues 
from the glycocalyx of the host cell and in respiratory mucus, which facilitates the 
release of the virus and propagation of its infection. Inhibitors of this enzyme prevent 
viral progeny from being released and thus slow the spread of infection. Two drugs 
that inhibit the activity of NA are oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) 
(Figure 23.14).

Oligosaccharides in Infectious Disease
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that 
causes both acute and chronic infections in humans. Chronic 
infections are particularly problematic in host tissues, such as 
heart valves, and in implanted medical devices, such as pros￾thetic joints. Chronic S. aureus infections are associated with 
biofilms, communities of surface-associated bacteria embedded 
in a self-produced, hydrated extracellular polymeric matrix. 
Although bacterial biofilms have been known for over 100 years, 
their importance in human disease was not recognized until the 
mid-1970s. Canadian microbiologist J. William Costerton, considered 
to be the “father of biofilms,” proposed that bacterial biofilms are 
protected from the immune system and the action of antimicro￾bial agents. Biofilm cells have been shown to be 10–1000-fold 
less susceptible to various antimicrobial agents than their plank￾tonic (free-floating) counterparts. It is thus not surprising that con￾ventional therapies have proven inadequate in the treatment of 
many (if not most) chronic biofilm infections due to the extraordi￾nary resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial treatments. Searching 
for ways to prevent or eradicate biofilms is a very active area of 
biomedical research. One strategy involves the disaggregation 
of the bacterial biofilm structure, mainly by attacking the extra￾cellular polymeric matrix that surrounds the biofilm.
Biofilms are encased or embedded in a complex mixture of 
oligosaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). The 
main oligosaccharide component of the S. aureus biofilm matrix is 
a β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine polymer called oligosaccharide 
intercellular adhesin (PIA). One approach for disruption of the bio￾film architecture is to break down the PIA and disperse the individ￾ual bacteria, which can then be attacked by the immune system. 
Dispersion B, a 361-amino-acid protein produced by Aggregati￾bacter actinomycetemcomitans, degrades S. aureus biofilms by 
hydrolyzing the glycosidic linkages of PIA. Clinical uses being 
explored for Dispersion B include topical application to wounds, 
coating for medical devices, and cleansing of contact lenses.

A model of biofilm development. At stage 1, the bacterial cells attach reversibly to the surface. Then, at stage 2, the cells attach irreversibly, a 
step mediated mainly by exopolymeric substances. At stage 3, the first maturation phase is reached, as indicated by early development of 
biofilm architecture. The second maturation phase is reached at stage 4 with fully mature biofilms, as indicated by the complex biofilm 
architecture. At the dispersion stage (stage 5), single motile cells disperse from the microcolonies. Adapted from P. Stoodely et al, “Biofilms as 
Complex Differentiated Communities,” Annual Review of Microbiology, 56, 187–209 (2002).

Section 23.1 Carbohydrates are marvelous molecules! In most of them, every carbon bears 
a functional group, and the nature of the functional groups changes as the 
molecule interconverts between open-chain and cyclic hemiacetal forms. 
Any approach to understanding carbohydrates must begin with structure.
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones. Those derived from 
aldehydes are classified as aldoses; those derived from ketones are ketoses.
Section 23.2 Fischer projections and d,l notation are commonly used to describe carbohydrate 
stereochemistry. The standards are the enantiomers of glyceraldehyde.

Section 23.3 Aldotetroses have two chirality centers, so four stereoisomers are possible. They 
are assigned to the d or the l series according to whether the configuration at 
their highest numbered chirality center is analogous to d- or l-glyceraldehyde, 
respectively. Both hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the Fischer 
projection in erythrose, but on opposite sides in threose. The Fischer projections 
of d-erythrose and d-threose are shown in Figure 23.2.
Section 23.4 Of the eight stereoisomeric aldopentoses, Figure 23.2 shows the Fischer 
projections of the d-enantiomers (d-ribose, d-arabinose, d-xylose, and d-lyxose). 
Likewise, Figure 23.2 gives the Fischer projections of the eight d-aldohexoses.
Section 23.5 The aldohexoses are allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, 
and talose. The mnemonic “All altruists gladly make gum in gallon tanks” is 
helpful in writing the correct Fischer projection for each one.
Sections Most carbohydrates exist as cyclic hemiacetals. Those with five-membered rings 
are called furanose forms; those with six-membered rings are called pyranose
forms.

The anomeric carbon in a cyclic hemiacetal is the one attached to two oxygens. 
It is the carbon that corresponds to the carbonyl carbon in the open-chain form. 
The symbols α and β refer to the configuration at the anomeric carbon.
Section 23.8 Hemiacetal forms of carbohydrates are interconvertible in water. The equilibrium 
mixture can contain α and β anomers of furanose and pyranose forms. The change 
from one form to the equilibrium mixture is accompanied by a change in optical 
rotation called mutarotation. For d-glucose, mutarotation can be described in 
terms of the interconversion of α-pyranose and β-pyranose forms by way of the 
open-chain form.

23.21 SUMMARYSection 23.9 Pyranose forms of carbohydrates resemble cyclohexane in their conformational 
preference for chair forms. The anomeric effect causes an electronegative 
substituent at the anomeric (C-1) carbon to be more stable when it is axial than 
when it is equatorial. The effect is believed to result from the delocalization of 
an electron pair of the ring oxygen into an antibonding orbital of the anomeric 
substituent.
Section 23.10 Most naturally occurring ketoses have their carbonyl group located at C-2. Like 
aldoses, ketoses cyclize to hemiacetals and exist as furanose or pyranose forms.
Sections Structurally modified carbohydrates include deoxy sugars, amino sugars, and 
branched-chain carbohydrates.
Section 23.14 Glycosides are acetals, compounds in which the anomeric hydroxyl group has 
been replaced by an alkoxy group. Glycosides are easily prepared by allowing a 
carbohydrate and an alcohol to stand in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Sections 23.15 Disaccharides are carbohydrates in which two monosaccharides are joined 
by a glycosidic bond. Polysaccharides have many monosaccharide units 
connected through glycosidic linkages. Complete hydrolysis of disaccharides 
and polysaccharides cleaves the glycosidic bonds, yielding the free 
monosaccharide components.
Sections 23.17 Carbohydrates undergo chemical reactions characteristic of aldehydes and 
ketones, alcohols, diols, and other classes of compounds, depending on their 
structure. A review of the reactions described in this chapter is presented in 
Table 23.2.
Section 23.19 Carbohydrates linked by O-glycosidic linkages such as those found in disaccharides 
are synthesized by the reaction of a glycosyl donor and a glycosyl acceptor.
Section 23.20 Carbohydrates linked to proteins, termed glycoproteins, are one example of 
glycoconjugates in which a carbohydrate is attached to some other biomolecule. 
Cell-surface glycoproteins are involved in molecular recognition and are 
important in the immune system as well as in certain diseases.

Emil Fischer and the Structure of (+)-Glucose
Emil Fischer’s determination of the structure of glucose was carried out as the nineteenth century 
ended and the twentieth began. The structure of no other sugar was known at that time, and the 
spectroscopic techniques that now aid organic analysis were not yet available. All Fischer had was 
information from chemical transformations, polarimetry, and a sharp intellect.
Fischer knew that (+)-glucose was one of 16 possible stereoisomers having the constitution:
HO C-2, 3, 4, and 5 are chirality centers H of unknown configuration.

OH OH O
OH OH
By arbitrarily assigning a particular configuration to the chirality center at C-5, Fischer realized 
that one could determine the configurations of C-2, C-3, and C-4 relative to C-5. This reduces 
the number of structural possibilities to the eight that we now call d-hexoses.

Eventually, Fischer’s arbitrary assignment proved correct, which made the stereochemical 
assignments for all of the chirality centers of (+)-glucose correct in an absolute as well as a relative 
sense.
The following problems lead you through Fischer’s interpretation of the information available 
to Fischer in determining the structure of (+)-glucose. The order in which the facts are presented 
is modified slightly from Fischer’s, but the logic is the same. We’ll begin in Problem 23.47 with 
(−)-arabinose, a pentose having the same configuration at its highest numbered chirality center as 
(+)-glucose, a fact that emerges in Problem 23.48.

Problem 23.48. If you are not certain about how this answer is arrived at, it would be a 
good idea to review the previous questions.

Lipids
Among the major classes of naturally occurring biomolecules 
(lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids), lipids differ 
in being defined by a physical property—solubility. They are 
more soluble in nonpolar solvents than in water. Lipids include 
a variety of structural types, a collection of which is introduced 
in this chapter. Fatty acids, terpenes, steroids, prostaglandins, 
and carotenes are all lipids but are very different from one 
another in both structure and function. They share a common 
biosynthetic origin in that all are ultimately derived from 
glucose. During glycolysis, glucose is converted to lactic acid 
by way of pyruvic acid.

The pathway leading to lactic acid and beyond is concerned 
with energy storage and production, but some pyruvic acid is 
converted to acetic acid and used as a starting material in the 
biosynthesis of more complex substances, especially lipids. 
This chapter is organized around that theme. We’ll begin by 
looking at the reaction in which acetate (two carbons) is formed 
from pyruvate (three carbons).
Digoxigenin is the steroid component of digoxin, a glycoside found in the 
flowers called foxgloves. Digoxin is used to treat heart arrhythmia and 
fibrillation. Like all steroids, digoxigenin is a lipid.

24.1 Acetyl Coenzyme A
Acetate is furnished in most of its important biochemical reactions as its thioester acetyl 
coenzyme A (Figure 24.1a). Its formation from pyruvate involves the enzymes of the

Four cofactors are required, including NAD+ (see Section 16.10) as an oxidizing agent 
and coenzyme A (Figure 24.1b) as the acetyl group acceptor. Coenzyme A is a thiol; its 
chain terminates in a sulfhydryl (SH) group. Acetylation of the sulfhydryl group of 
coenzyme A gives acetyl coenzyme A.
Thioesters are both more reactive than ordinary esters toward nucleophilic acyl 
substitution and also contain a greater proportion of enol at equilibrium. Both properties 
are apparent in the properties of acetyl coenzyme A. In some reactions it is the CO 
function that reacts; in others it is the α-carbon atom.

though these reactions are enzyme-catalyzed and occur at far faster rates than similar 
transformations carried out in their absence, the types of reactions are essentially the 
same as the fundamental processes of organic chemistry.

Historically, fats are solids and oils are liquids, but we refer to both as fats when describ￾ing most of their other properties. They serve a number of functions, especially that of 
energy storage. Although carbohydrates are a source of readily available energy, it is 
more efficient for an organism to store energy in the form of fat because the same mass 
of fat delivers over twice the energy.
Figure 24.2 shows the structures of two typical triacylglycerols, 2-oleyl-1,3-
distearylglycerol (Figure 24.2a) and tristearin (Figure 24.2b). Both occur naturally—in 
cocoa butter, for example. All three acyl groups in tristearin are stearyl (octadecanoyl) 
groups. In 2-oleyl-1,3-distearylglycerol, two of the acyl groups are stearyl, but the one in 
the middle is oleyl (cis-9-octadecenoyl). As the figure shows, tristearin can be prepared by 
catalytic hydrogenation of the carbon–carbon double bond of 2-oleyl-1,3-distearylglycerol. 
Glycerol is the common name for 
propane-1,2,3-triol.

Hydrogenation raises the melting point from 43°C in 2-oleyl-1,3-distearylglycerol to 
72°C in tristearin and is a standard technique in the food industry for converting liquid 
vegetable oils to solid “shortenings.” The space-filling models of the two show the more 
compact structure of tristearin, which allows it to pack better in a crystal lattice than the 
more irregular shape of 2-oleyl-1,3-distearyl-glycerol permits. This irregular shape is a 
direct result of the cis double bond in the side chain.
Hydrolysis of fats yields glycerol and long-chain fatty acids. Thus, tristearin gives 
glycerol and three molecules of stearic acid on hydrolysis. Table 24.1 lists a few 
The term fatty acid originally referred 
to those carboxylic acids that occur 
naturally in triacylglycerols. Its use has 
expanded to include all unbranched 
carboxylic acids, irrespective of their 
origin and chain length.

representative fatty acids. As these examples indicate, most naturally occurring fatty acids 
possess an even number of carbon atoms and an unbranched carbon chain. The carbon 
chain may be saturated or it can contain one or more double bonds. When double bonds 
are present, they are almost always cis. Acyl groups containing 14–20 carbon atoms are 
the most abundant in triacylglycerols.
Problem 24.1
What fatty acids are produced on hydrolysis of 2-oleyl-1,3-distearylglycerol? What other 
triacylglycerol gives the same fatty acids and in the same proportions as 2-oleyl-1,3-
distearylglycerol?
A few fatty acids with trans double bonds (trans fatty acids) occur naturally, but 
the major source of trans fats comes from partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils in, for 
example, the preparation of margarine. The same catalysts that catalyze the hydrogena￾tion of the double bonds in a triacylglycerol also catalyze double-bond migration and 
stereoisomerization.

The intermediate in hydrogenation, formed by reaction of the unsaturated ester with the 
hydrogenated surface of the metal catalyst M, not only can proceed to the saturated fatty 
acid ester, but also can dissociate to constitutional and stereoisomers. Unlike poly￾unsaturated vegetable oils, which tend to reduce serum cholesterol levels, the trans fats 
produced by stereoisomerization during partial hydrogenation have cholesterol-raising 
effects similar to those of saturated fats. Increased consumption of trans fats has been 
linked to higher levels of coronary artery disease.
Palmitic acid is the most abundant 
naturally occurring fatty acid. It is 
present in many fats and oils and is 
best known as the major fatty acid 
component of palm oil.

Fatty acids occur naturally in forms other than as triacylglycerols, and we’ll see 
numerous examples as we go through the chapter. Anandamide, for example, is an amide 
of arachidonic acid (see Table 24.1).

Anandamide
Anandamide was isolated from pig’s brain and identified as the substance that normally binds 
to the “cannabinoid receptor.” The active component of marijuana, Δ9
-tetrahydrocannabinol, 
exerts its effect by binding to a receptor, and scientists had long wondered what compound 
was the natural substrate for this binding site. Anandamide is that compound and seems 
to be involved in moderating pain. Once the identity of the “endogenous cannabinoid” 
was known, scientists looked specifically for it and found it in some surprising places—
chocolate, for example.

the other three are derived from it, malonyl-ACP because it is the source of all but two 
of the carbons in the final fatty acid.
Malonyl-CoA is formed by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. The energy to drive the

These attached acyl carrier protein units are handles that bind the growing fatty acid 
to the multienzyme complex mammalian fatty acid synthase (mFAS) and guide it 
through subsequent transformations. The various enzymes occupy seven domains 
of mFAS.
One enzyme catalyzes a reaction in which decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP 
gives an enolate that reacts with acetyl-ACP by nucleophilic acyl substitution to give 
acetoacetyl-ACP.

Problem 24.2
Give the structure of the keto acyl-ACP formed after four cycles of chain extension starting 
with acetyl-ACP.
This phase of fatty acid biosynthesis concludes with transfer of the newly formed 
acyl group from ACP to coenzyme A. The resulting acyl coenzyme A molecules can 
then undergo a number of subsequent biological transformations. One is chain extension, 
leading to acyl groups with more than 16 carbons. Another is the introduction of one or 
more carbon–carbon double bonds. A third is acyl transfer from sulfur to oxygen to form 
esters such as triacylglycerols. The process by which acyl coenzyme A molecules are 
converted to triacylglycerols involves a type of intermediate called a phospholipid and 
is discussed next in Section 24.4.

chains, each of which has a molecular

but also are biosynthetic precursors of other members of a group of compounds called 
phosphoglycerides or glycerol phosphatides. Phosphorus-containing derivatives of lipids 
are known as phospholipids, and phosphoglycerides are one type of phospholipid.
One important phospholipid is phosphatidylcholine, also called lecithin. Phosphati￾dylcholine is a mixture of diesters of phosphoric acid. One ester function is derived from a 
diacylglycerol, whereas the other is a choline [OCH2CH2N

Phosphatidylcholine possesses a hydrophilic polar “head group” (the positively 
charged choline) and two lipophilic (hydrophobic) nonpolar “tails” (the acyl groups). 
Under certain conditions, such as at the interface of two aqueous phases, phosphatidyl￾choline forms what is called a lipid bilayer, as shown in Figure 24.3. Because there are 
two long-chain acyl groups in each molecule, the most stable assembly has the polar 
groups solvated by water molecules at the top and bottom surfaces and the lipophilic 
acyl groups directed toward the interior of the bilayer.
Phosphatidylcholine is an important component of cell membranes, but cell mem￾branes are more than simply lipid bilayers. Although their composition varies with their 
source, a typical membrane contains about equal amounts of lipid and protein, and the 
amount of cholesterol in the lipid fraction can approximate that of phosphatidylcholine. 
A simplified schematic representation of a cell membrane is shown in Figure 24.4. This 
diagram originates from the fluid mosaic model, which was originally proposed in 1972.
It was known in 1972 that the interior and exterior of the plasma membrane is 
different with respect to lipid composition, integral membrane protein organization, 
glycoproteins, and glycolipids. “Flipping” lipids from one side of the membrane to 
the other does not occur spontaneously, and the overall fluidity of a membrane is 
affected by the lipid composition. This model has been refined to reflect our increas￾ing understanding of the complexities of biological membranes. It was thought, for 
example, that lipid composition was fairly homogeneous laterally and that lipids 
moved freely within the monolayer. Today, more emphasis is placed on the “mosaic” 
rather than the “fluid” nature of membranes. We now know that organization occurs 
by lipid–lipid, lipid–protein, and protein–protein interactions within a membrane. For 
example, “lipid rafts” are ordered subdomains of membranes. In plasma membranes, 
they contain more cholesterol and sphingolipids. Lipid rafts play important organiza￾tional roles in membrane functions such as signal transduction, endocytosis, and 
cell–cell interactions (Figure 24.5).

The protein fraction is responsible for a major part of membrane function. Nonpolar 
materials can diffuse through the bilayer from one side to the other relatively easily, 
but polar materials, particularly metal ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+, cannot. The 
transport of metal ions is assisted by the membrane proteins. These proteins pick up a 
metal ion from the aqueous phase on one side of the membrane and shield it from the 
hydrophobic environment within the membrane while transporting it to the aqueous 
phase on the other side of the membrane. Ionophore antibiotics such as monensin (see 
Section 17.5, Figure 17.3) disrupt the normal functioning of cells by facilitating metal 
ion transport across cell membranes.
Like cells, only much smaller, spherical objects called liposomes are enclosed by a 
phospholipid bilayer that separates a watery interior from an external (also watery) environment. 
Liposomes occur naturally but can also be prepared from lecithin as a phosphatidyl￾choline source. Following their chance discovery in 1961, liposomes originally received 
attention as models for membrane structure. Subsequently, their use as novel vehicles for 
drug delivery was demonstrated and has led to important applications in medicine.
Generating a liposome in an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble drug 
yields the species illustrated in Figure 24.6 in which the drug is encapsulated within the 
interior of the liposome. When given to a patient, the drug-carrying liposome binds to 
one of the patient’s cells and transfers the drug into the cell. Conventional liposomes are 
rapidly cleared from the bloodstream. Currently, liposomes are modified to increase their 
stability and to increase their specificity to cellular targets.
Advances in liposome technology have expanded the types of substances that can 
be used as therapeutics. Nanoparticles are a class of materials that have one or more 
dimensions less than 100 nm, and many types of liposomes can be created that meet this 
criterion. Commonly called lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), these delivery systems contain a 
complex mixture of lipids. For example, inclusion of cationic lipids can entrap and neu￾tralize negatively charged species such as nucleic acid polymers. mRNA vaccines such 
as those against COVID-19 rely on such LNPs to protect the nucleic acid polymer from 
extracellular degradation and to deliver the polymer to the cytosol, where it can be 
expressed by the host cell to produce a desired protein.
Problem 24.4
In addition to bilayers in cell membranes and liposomes, phosphatidylcholine also forms 
micelles. Compare a typical fatty acid micelle (see Section 19.7) and a phosphatidylcholine 
micelle, both at pH 7. What is the most significant difference in their surface properties?
24.5 Waxes
Waxes are water-repelling solids that are part of the protective coatings of a number of 
living things, including the leaves of plants, the fur of animals, and the feathers of birds. 
They are usually mixtures of esters in which both the alkyl and acyl group are unbranched 
and contain a dozen or more carbon atoms. Beeswax, for example, contains the ester

Problem 24.5
The bulk of the head of the sperm whale is filled with spermaceti, a mixture of waxes 
believed to serve a role in the animal’s buoyancy. One component of spermaceti is an ester 
known as cetyl palmitate. Currently manufactured from the seeds of the jojoba shrub, the 
pure ester is an emollient in a number of soaps and cosmetics. The systematic name for 
cetyl palmitate is hexadecyl hexadecanoate. Write a structural formula for this substance.
Fatty acids normally occur naturally as components of esters; fats, oils, phos￾pholipids, and waxes all are unique types of fatty acid esters. There is, however, an 
important class of fatty acid derivatives that carries out its biological role in the form 
of the free acid. This class of fatty acid derivatives is described next in Section 24.6.
24.6 Prostaglandins
Research in physiology carried out in the 1930s established that the lipid fraction of 
semen contains small amounts of substances that exert powerful effects on smooth mus￾cle. Sheep prostate glands proved to be a convenient source of this material and yielded 
a mixture of structurally related substances referred to collectively as prostaglandins.
We now know that prostaglandins are present in almost all animal tissues, where they 
carry out a variety of regulatory functions. Among these functions are relaxation or 
constriction of bronchial muscles, platelet aggregation or disaggregation, induction of 
labor, and the regulation of inflammation.
Prostaglandins are extremely potent substances and exert their physiological 
effects at very small concentrations. Because of this, their isolation was difficult, and 
it was not until 1960 that the first members of this class, designated PGE1 and PGF1α
(Figure 24.7), were obtained as pure compounds. More than a dozen structurally 
related prostaglandins have since been isolated and identified. All the prostaglandins 
are 20-carbon carboxylic acids and contain a cyclopentane ring. All have hydroxyl 
groups at C-11 and C-15 (see Figure 24.7). Prostaglandins belonging to the F series 
have an additional hydroxyl group at C-9, and a carbonyl function is present at this 
position in the various PGEs. The subscript numerals in their abbreviated names 
indicate the number of double bonds.
Prostaglandins arise from unsaturated C20-carboxylic acids such as arachidonic acid 
(see Table 24.1). Animals cannot biosynthesize arachidonic acid directly. They obtain 
linoleic acid from vegetable oils in their diet and extend the carbon chain of linoleic acid 
from 18 to 20 carbons while introducing two more double bonds. Linoleic acid is said 
to be an essential fatty acid, forming part of the dietary requirement of animals. Those 
that feed on diets that are deficient in linoleic acid grow poorly and suffer a number of 
other disorders, some of which are reversed on feeding them vegetable oils rich in linoleic 
Much of the fundamental work on 
prostaglandins was carried out by 
Sune Bergström and Bengt 
Samuelsson of the Karolinska Institute 
(Sweden) and by Sir John Vane of the 
Wellcome Foundation (Great Britain). 
These three shared the Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine in 1982.
Arachidonic acid gets its name from 
arachidic acid, the saturated C20 fatty 
acid isolated from peanut (Arachis 
hypogaea) oil.

the raw materials for prostaglandin biosynthesis.
Studies of the biosynthesis of PGE2 from arachidonic acid have shown that the three 
new oxygens come from O2. The enzyme involved, cyclooxygenase (COX), catalyzes 
cycloaddition of O2 to arachidonic acid to give an endoperoxide (PGG2).

Before leaving this biosynthetic scheme, notice that PGE2 has four chirality

in the equation is formed. Moreover, it is formed as a single enantiomer. Like most 
enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the transformations in the biosynthesis of PGE2 are 
enantioselective.

Write the structural formula and give the IUPAC name for the fatty acid from which PGE1 is

Prostaglandins belong to a group of compounds that, because they are related to 
icosanoic acid [CH3(CH2)18CO2H)], are collectively known as icosanoids. The other 
icosanoids are thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes.
Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) promotes platelet aggregation and blood clotting. The 
biosynthetic pathway to TXA2 is the same as that of PGE2 up to PGH2. At that point

Leukotrienes are the substances most responsible for the constriction of bronchial

from the one that leads to prostaglandins and related compounds. The pathway to 
leukotrienes does not involve cyclooxygenation. Instead, oxidation simply introduces 
An injection of the steroid cortisone is often effective for 
reducing the pain and inflammation that comes from an 
injury. But chronic pain and inflammation, such as occurs with 
arthritis, is better managed with an orally administered remedy. 
Enter nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
The long-standing question of how aspirin works has 
been answered in terms of its effect on prostaglandin bio￾synthesis. Prostaglandins are made continuously in all mammalian 
cells and serve a variety of functions. They are biosynthesized 
in greater amounts at sites of tissue damage, and it is they that 
cause the pain and inflammation we feel. Cells contain two 
forms of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, COX-1 and COX-2; both 
catalyze prostaglandin biosynthesis. Some of the prostaglan￾dins produced with the aid of COX-1 are involved in protecting 
the stomach and kidneys. COX-2 is concentrated in injured 
tissue where it works to catalyze the biosynthesis of the prosta￾glandins responsible for inflammation. Aspirin inhibits pros￾taglandin biosynthesis by inactivating both COX-1 and COX-2. 
Although inhibition of COX-2 has the desired effect of relieving 
pain and inflammation, inhibition of COX-1 causes irritation of 
the stomach lining.
Aspirin is the oldest and best known NSAID. Over the 
years it has been joined by many others, a few of which are:
A good antiinflammatory drug, therefore, will selectively 
inactivate COX-2 while leaving COX-1 untouched. Aspirin 
doesn’t; in fact, it is about ten times more effective toward inac￾tivating the “wrong” COX.
The classical period of drug development emphasized 
testing a variety of compounds for biological activity, identifying 
the features believed to be associated with the desired activity, 
then synthesizing and testing numerous analogs. Celecoxib, 
however, was developed with the express goal of inhibiting 
COX-2. Molecular models of the three-dimensional structures of 
COX-1 and COX-2 were examined to guide thinking about the 
kinds of structural units a drug should have in order to selec￾tively inactivate COX-2. This approach not only led to a success￾ful drug, but also validated a structure-based route to new drug 
development.

acid. The enzymes involved are known as lipoxygenases and are differentiated according 
to the carbon of the chain that is oxidized. The biosynthesis of the leukotriene shown 
begins with a 5-lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonic acid.

Most of the drugs such as epinephrine and albuterol used to treat asthma attacks 
are bronchodilators—substances that expand the bronchial passages. Newer drugs are 
designed either to inhibit the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme, which acts on arachidonic acid in 
the first stage of leukotriene biosynthesis, or to block leukotriene receptors.
24.7 Terpenes: The Isoprene Rule
The word essential as applied to naturally occurring organic substances can have two 
different meanings. With respect to fatty acids, essential means “necessary.” Linoleic 
acid is an “essential” fatty acid; it must be included in the diet for animals to grow 
properly because they lack the ability to biosynthesize it directly.
Essential is also used as the adjective form of the noun essence. The mixtures of 
substances that make up the fragrant material of plants are called essential oils because 
they contain the essence, that is, the odor, of the plant. The study of the composition of 
essential oils ranks as one of the oldest areas of organic chemical research. Very often, 
the principal volatile component of an essential oil belongs to a class of chemical sub￾stances called the terpenes.
Myrcene, a hydrocarbon isolated from bayberry oil, is a typical terpene:
Myrcene
The structural feature that distinguishes terpenes from other natural products is the 
isoprene unit. The carbon skeleton of myrcene (exclusive of its double bonds) corresponds 
to the head-to-tail union of two isoprene units.

The German chemist Otto Wallach determined the structures of many terpenes and 
is credited with setting forth the isoprene rule: terpenes are repeating assemblies of 
isoprene units, normally joined head-to-tail.
Terpenes are often referred to as isoprenoid compounds and are classified accord￾ing to the number of isoprene units they contain (Table 24.2).
Although the term terpene once referred only to hydrocarbons, its use expanded to 
include functionally substituted derivatives as well, grouped together under the general 
term isoprenoids. Figure 24.8 presents the structural formulas for a number of represen￾tative examples. The isoprene units in some of these are relatively easy to identify. The 
three isoprene units in the sesquiterpene farnesol, for example, are indicated as follows 
in color. They are joined in a head-to-tail fashion.
OH
Isoprene units in farnesol (C15H26O)
Many terpenes contain one or more rings, but these also can be viewed as collec￾tions of isoprene units. An example is β-selinene. Like farnesol, it is made up of three 
isoprene units linked head-to-tail.
Isoprene units in β-selinene (C15H24)
Problem 24.8
Locate the isoprene units in each of the monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes 
shown in Figure 24.8. (In some cases there are two equally correct arrangements.)
Tail-to-tail linkages of isoprene units sometimes occur, especially in the higher 
terpenes. The C(12)C(13) bond of squalene unites two C15 units in a tail-to-tail manner. 
Notice, however, that isoprene units are joined head-to-tail within each C15 unit of squalene.

Problem 24.9
Identify the isoprene units in β-carotene (see Figure 24.8). Which carbons are joined by a 
tail-to-tail link between isoprene units?
Over time, Wallach’s original isoprene rule was refined, most notably by Leopold 
Ruzicka of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Zürich). Ruzicka put forward a bio￾logical isoprene rule, which connected the various classes of terpenes according to their 
biological precursors. Thus arose the idea of the biological isoprene unit. Isoprene is the 
fundamental structural unit of terpenes and related compounds, but isoprene does not 
occur naturally—at least in places where biosynthesis is going on. What then is the 
biological isoprene unit, how is this unit itself biosynthesized, and how do individual 
isoprene units combine to give terpenes?
24.8 Isopentenyl Diphosphate: The Biological Isoprene Unit
Isoprenoid compounds are biosynthesized from acetate by a process that involves several 
stages. The first stage is the formation of mevalonic acid from three molecules of acetic 
acid. In the second stage, mevalonic acid is converted to isopentenyl diphosphate:

Isopentenyl diphosphate is the biological isoprene unit; it contains five carbon atoms 
connected in the same order as in isoprene.
In the presence of the enzyme isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, isopentenyl 
diphosphate is converted to dimethylallyl diphosphate. The isomerization involves two 
successive proton transfers: one from an acidic site of the enzyme (EnzH) to the 
double bond to give a tertiary carbocation; the other is deprotonation of the carbocation 
by a basic site of the enzyme to generate the double bond of dimethylallyl diphosphate.

Isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate are structurally similar—
both contain a double bond and a diphosphate ester unit—but the chemical reactivity 
expressed by each is different. The principal site of reaction in dimethylallyl diphosphate 
is the carbon that bears the diphosphate group. Diphosphate is a reasonably good leaving 
group in nucleophilic substitution reactions, especially when, as in dimethylallyl diphos￾phate, it is located at an allylic carbon. Isopentenyl diphosphate, on the other hand, does 
not have its leaving group attached to an allylic carbon and is far less reactive than 
dimethylallyl diphosphate toward nucleophilic reagents. The principal site of reaction in 
isopentenyl diphosphate is the carbon–carbon double bond, which, like the double bonds 
of simple alkenes, is reactive toward electrophiles.
24.9 Carbon–Carbon Bond Formation 
in Terpene Biosynthesis
The chemical properties of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate are 
complementary in a way that permits them to react with each other to form a carbon–
carbon bond that unites two isoprene units. In broad outline, the enzyme-catalyzed process 
involves bond formation between the allylic CH2 of dimethylallyl diphosphate and the 
Ruzicka was a corecipient of the 1939 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

The group to which the OH (or other substituent) is attached is called a prenyl group.
The higher terpenes are formed not by successive addition of C5 units but by the 
coupling of simpler terpenes. Thus, the triterpenes (C30) are derived from two molecules 
of farnesyl diphosphate, and the tetraterpenes (C40) from two molecules of geranylgeranyl 
diphosphate. These carbon–carbon bond-forming processes involve tail-to-tail couplings 
and proceed by a more complicated mechanism than that just described.
The reaction of an allylic diphosphate or a carbocation with a source of π electrons 
is a recurring theme in terpene biosynthesis and is invoked to explain the origin of more 
complicated structural types. Consider, for example, the formation of cyclic mono￾terpenes. Neryl diphosphate, formed by an enzyme-catalyzed isomerization of the E
double bond in geranyl diphosphate, has the proper geometry to form a six-membered 
ring via intramolecular attack of the double bond on the allylic diphosphate unit.

This bicyclic carbocation then undergoes many reactions typical of carbocation 
intermediates to provide a variety of bicyclic monoterpenes, as outlined in Figure 24.9.
Problem 24.11
The structure of the bicyclic monoterpene borneol is shown in Figure 24.9. Isoborneol, a 
stereoisomer of borneol, can be prepared in the laboratory by a two-step sequence. In the 
first step, borneol is oxidized to camphor by treatment with chromic acid. In the second step, 
camphor is reduced with sodium borohydride to a mixture of 85% isoborneol and 15% borneol. 
On the basis of these transformations, deduce structural formulas for isoborneol and camphor.
Analogous processes involving cyclizations and rearrangements of carbocations 
derived from farnesyl diphosphate produce a rich variety of structural types in the sesqui￾terpene series. We will have more to say about the chemistry of higher terpenes, especially 
the triterpenes, later in this chapter. For the moment, however, let’s return to smaller 
molecules to complete the picture of how isoprenoid compounds arise from acetate.
24.10 The Pathway from Acetate 
to Isopentenyl Diphosphate
The introduction to Section 24.8 pointed out that mevalonic acid is the biosynthetic 
precursor of isopentenyl diphosphate. The early steps in the biosynthesis of mevalonate 
from three molecules of acetic acid are analogous to those in fatty acid biosynthesis 
except that they do not involve acyl carrier protein. Thus, the reaction of acetyl coenzyme 
A with malonyl coenzyme A yields a molecule of acetoacetyl coenzyme A.

In keeping with its biogenetic origin in three molecules of acetic acid, mevalonic acid 
has six carbon atoms. The conversion of mevalonate to isopentenyl diphosphate involves 
loss of the “extra” carbon as carbon dioxide. First, the alcohol hydroxyl groups of meval￾onate are converted to phosphate ester functions—they are enzymatically phosphorylated,
with introduction of a simple phosphate at the tertiary site and a diphosphate at the primary 
site. Decarboxylation, in concert with loss of the tertiary phosphate, introduces a carbon–
carbon double bond and gives isopentenyl diphosphate, the fundamental building block for 
formation of isoprenoid natural products.

Much of what we know concerning the pathway from acetate to mevalonate to 
isopentenyl diphosphate to terpenes comes from “feeding” experiments, in which plants 
are grown in the presence of radioactively labeled organic substances and the distribution 
of the radioactive label is determined in the products of biosynthesis. To illustrate, euca￾lyptus plants were allowed to grow in a medium containing acetic acid enriched with 
14C in its methyl group. Citronellal was isolated from the mixture of monoterpenes 
produced by the plants and shown, by a series of chemical degradations, to contain the 
radioactive 14C label at carbons 2, 4, 6, and 8, as well as at the carbons of both branch￾ing methyl groups.

Problem 24.12
How many carbon atoms of citronellal would be radioactively labeled if the acetic acid 
used in the experiment were enriched with 14C at C-1 instead of at C-2? Identify these 
carbon atoms.
Some of the most effective 
cholesterol-lowering drugs act by 
inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes 
this reaction.
Some bacteria, algae, and plants 
make isopentenyl diphosphate by a 
different route.
Citronellal occurs naturally as the 
principal component of citronella oil 
and is used as an insect repellent.1022 Chapter 24 Lipids
The present method employs 13C as the isotopic label. Instead of locating the posi￾tion of a radioactive 14C label by a laborious degradation procedure, the 13C NMR spec￾trum of the natural product is recorded. The signals for the carbons that are enriched in 
13C are far more intense than those corresponding to carbons in which 13C is present 
only at the natural abundance level.
Isotope incorporation experiments have demonstrated the essential correctness of 
the just described scheme for terpene biosynthesis. Considerable effort has been expended 
toward its detailed elaboration because of the common biosynthetic origin of terpenes 
and another class of acetate-derived natural products, the steroids.
24.11 Steroids: Cholesterol
Cholesterol is the central compound in any discussion of steroids. Its name is a com￾bination of the Greek words for “bile” (chole) and “solid” (stereos) preceding the char￾acteristic alcohol suffix -ol. It is the most abundant steroid present in humans and the 
most important one as well because all other steroids arise from it. An average adult has 
over 200 g of cholesterol; it is found in almost all body tissues, with relatively large 
amounts present in the brain and spinal cord and in gallstones. Cholesterol is the chief 
constituent of the plaque that builds up on the walls of arteries in atherosclerosis.
Cholesterol was isolated in the eighteenth century, but its structure is so complex that 
its correct constitution was not determined until 1932 and its stereochemistry not verified 
until 1955. Steroids are characterized by the tetracyclic ring system shown in Figures 24.11a
and 24.11b, and cholesterol in Figure 24.11c modified to include an alcohol function at C-3, 
a double bond at C-5, methyl groups at C-10 and C-13, and a C8H17 side chain at C-17. 
Isoprene units may be discerned in various portions of the cholesterol molecule, but the

overall correspondence with the isoprene rule is far from perfect. Indeed, cholesterol has 
only 27 carbon atoms, three too few for it to be classed as a triterpene.
Animals accumulate cholesterol from their diet, but are also able to biosynthesize it 
from acetate. The pioneering work that identified the key intermediates in the complicated 
pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis was carried out by Konrad Bloch (Harvard) and Feodor 
Lynen (Munich). An important discovery was that the triterpene squalene (see Figure 24.8) 
is an intermediate in the formation of cholesterol from acetate. Thus, the early stages of 
cholesterol biosynthesis are the same as those of terpene biosynthesis described in Sec￾tions 24.8–24.10. In fact, a significant fraction of our knowledge of terpene biosynthesis 
is a direct result of experiments carried out in the area of steroid biosynthesis.
How does the tetracyclic steroid cholesterol arise from the acyclic triterpene squa￾lene? It begins with the epoxidation of squalene described earlier in Section 17.13 and 
continues from that point in Mechanism 24.1. Step 1 is an enzyme-catalyzed electrophilic 
ring opening of squalene 2,3-epoxide. Epoxide ring opening triggers a series of carboca￾tion reactions. These carbocation processes involve cyclization via carbon–carbon bond 
formation (step 1), ring expansion via a carbocation rearrangement (step 2), another 
cyclization (step 3), accompanied by a cascade of methyl group migrations and hydride 
shifts (step 4). The result of all these steps is the tetracyclic triterpene lanosterol. Step 
5 of Mechanism 24.1 summarizes the numerous remaining transformations by which 
lanosterol is converted to cholesterol.
Problem 24.13
The biosynthesis of cholesterol as outlined in Mechanism 24.1 is admittedly quite complicated. 
It will aid your understanding of the process if you consider the following questions:
(a) Which carbon atoms of squalene 2,3-epoxide correspond to the doubly bonded 
carbons of cholesterol?
(b) Which two hydrogen atoms of squalene 2,3-epoxide are the ones that migrate in 
step 4?
(c) Which methyl group of squalene 2,3-epoxide becomes the methyl group at the 
C,D ring junction of cholesterol?
(d) What three methyl groups of squalene 2,3-epoxide are lost during the conversion 
of lanosterol to cholesterol?
Sample Solution (a) As the structural formula in step 5 of Mechanism 24.1 indicates, the 
double bond of cholesterol unites C-5 and C-6 (steroid numbering). The corresponding carbons 
in the cyclization reaction of step 1 in the figure may be identified as C-7 and C-8 of squalene 
2,3-epoxide (systematic IUPAC numbering).

The biosynthetic pathway shown in Mechanism 24.1 was developed with the aid of isotopic 
labeling experiments. Which carbon atoms of cholesterol would you expect to be labeled when 
acetate enriched with 14C in its methyl group (14CH3COOH) is used as the carbon source?
Once formed, cholesterol undergoes a number of biochemical transformations. A 
very common one is acylation of its C-3 hydroxyl group by reaction with coenzyme A 
derivatives of fatty acids. Other processes convert cholesterol to the biologically important 
steroids described in the following sections.

Mechanism 24.1
Biosynthesis of Cholesterol from Squalene
The biosynthetic conversion of squalene to cholesterol proceeds through lanosterol. Lanosterol is formed by enzyme￾catalyzed cyclization of the 2,3-epoxide of squalene.
Step 1: An electrophilic species, shown here as +EnzH, catalyzes ring opening of squalene 2,3-epoxide. Ring opening 
is accompanied by cyclization to give a tricyclic tertiary carbocation. It is not known whether formation of 
the three new carbon–carbon bonds occurs in a single step or a series of steps.

A steroid very closely related structurally to cholesterol is its 7-dehydro derivative. 
7-Dehydrocholesterol is formed by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol and has a conjugated 
diene unit in its B ring. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is present in the tissues of the skin, where 
it is transformed to vitamin D3 by a sunlight-induced photochemical reaction.

Vitamin D3
Vitamin D3 is a key compound in the process by which Ca2+ is absorbed from the intestine. 
Low levels of vitamin D3 lead to Ca2+ concentrations in the body that are insufficient to 
support proper bone growth, resulting in rachitis, or “rickets.”
Rachitis was once thought to be a dietary deficiency disease because it could be 
prevented in children by feeding them fish liver oil. Actually, it is an environmental disease 
brought about by a deficiency of sunlight. Where the winter sun is weak, children may 
not be exposed to enough of its light to convert the 7-dehydrocholesterol in their skin to 
Cholesterol is biosynthesized in the liver, transported 
throughout the body to be used in a variety of ways, and 
returned to the liver where it serves as the biosynthetic precur￾sor to other steroids. But cholesterol is a lipid and isn’t soluble in 
water. How can it move through the blood if it doesn’t dissolve 
in it? The answer is that it doesn’t dissolve, but is instead carried 
through the blood and tissues as part of a lipoprotein (lipid +
protein = lipoprotein).
The proteins that carry cholesterol from the liver are called 
low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs; those that return it to the liver 
are the high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs. If too much cholesterol 
is being transported by LDL, or too little by HDL, the extra choles￾terol builds up on the walls of the arteries, causing atherosclero￾sis. Blood work done as part of a thorough physical examination 
The statins lower cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is 
required for the biosynthesis of mevalonic acid (see Section 24.10). 
measures not only total cholesterol but also the distribution 
between LDL and HDL cholesterol. An elevated level of LDL cho￾lesterol is a risk factor for heart disease. LDL cholesterol is “bad” 
cholesterol. HDLs, on the other hand, remove excess cholesterol 
and are protective. HDL cholesterol is “good” cholesterol.
The distribution between LDL and HDL cholesterol 
depends mainly on genetic factors, but can be altered. Regular 
exercise increases HDL and reduces LDL cholesterol, as does 
limiting the amount of saturated fat in the diet. Much progress 
has been made in developing new drugs to lower cholesterol. 
The statin class, beginning with lovastatin in 1988, has proven 
especially effective. The most prescribed cholesterol-lowering 
drug is atorvastatin (as its calcium salt). A chiral drug, atorvastatin 
was introduced in 1997 and is sold as a single enantiomer.
Mevalonic acid is an obligatory precursor to cholesterol, so less 
mevalonic acid translates into less cholesterol.

vitamin D3 at levels sufficient to promote the growth of strong bones. Fish have adapted 
to an environment that screens them from sunlight, and so they are not directly dependent 
on photochemistry for their vitamin D3 and accumulate it by a different process. Although 
fish liver oil is a good source of vitamin D3, it is not very palatable. Synthetic vitamin D3, 
prepared from cholesterol, is often added to milk and other foods to ensure that children 
receive enough of the vitamin for their bones to develop properly. Irradiated ergosterol is 
another dietary supplement added to milk and other foods for the same purpose. Ergosterol, 
a steroid obtained from yeast, is structurally similar to 7-dehydrocholesterol and, on irra￾diation with sunlight or artificial light, is converted to vitamin D2, a substance analogous 
to vitamin D3 and comparable in its ability to support bone growth.

24.13 Bile Acids
A significant fraction of the body’s cholesterol is used to form bile acids. Oxidation in 
the liver removes a portion of the C8H17 side chain, and additional hydroxyl groups are 
introduced at various positions on the steroid nucleus. Cholic acid is the most abundant 
of the bile acids. In the form of certain amide derivatives such as sodium taurocholate,
bile acids act as emulsifying agents to aid the digestion of fats.

The structure of cholic acid helps us understand how bile salts such as sodium taurocho￾late promote the transport of lipids through a water-rich environment. The bottom face of 
the molecule bears all of the polar groups, and the top face is exclusively hydrocarbon-like. 
Bile salts emulsify fats by forming micelles in which the fats are on the inside and the 
bile salts are on the outside. The hydrophobic face of the bile salt associates with the fat 
that is inside the micelle; the hydrophilic face is in contact with water on the outside.
24.14 Corticosteroids
The outer layer, or cortex, of the adrenal gland is the source of a large group of substances 
known as corticosteroids. Like the bile acids, they are derived from cholesterol by oxidation, 
with cleavage of a portion of the alkyl substituent on the D ring. Cortisol is the most abundant 24.15 Sex Hormones 1027

Corticosteroids exhibit a wide range of physiological effects. One important function 
is to assist in maintaining the proper electrolyte balance in body fluids. They also play a vital 
regulatory role in the metabolism of carbohydrates and in mediating the allergic response.
24.15 Sex Hormones
Hormones are the chemical messengers of the body; they are secreted by the endo￾crine glands and regulate biological processes. Corticosteroids, described in the pre￾ceding section, are hormones produced by the adrenal glands. The sex glands—testes 
in males, ovaries in females—secrete a number of hormones that are involved in 
sexual development and reproduction. Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone; 
it is an androgen. Testosterone promotes muscle growth, deepening of the voice, the 
growth of body hair, and other male secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone is 
formed from cholesterol and is the biosynthetic precursor of estradiol, the principal 
female sex hormone, or estrogen. Estradiol is a key substance in the regulation of 
the menstrual cycle and the reproductive process. It is the hormone most responsible 
for the development of female secondary sex characteristics.

Testosterone and estradiol are present in the body in only minute amounts, and 
their isolation and identification required heroic efforts. In order to obtain 0.012 g of 
estradiol for study, for example, 4 tons of sow ovaries had to be extracted!
A separate biosynthetic pathway leads from cholesterol to progesterone, a female 
sex hormone. One function of progesterone is to suppress ovulation at certain stages of 
the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy. Synthetic substances, such as norethindrone,
have been developed that are superior to progesterone when taken orally to “turn off” 
ovulation. By inducing temporary infertility, they form the basis of most oral contraceptive 
agents.

Carotenoids are natural pigments characterized by a tail-to-tail linkage between two C20
units and an extended conjugated system of double bonds. They are the most widely 
distributed of the substances that give color to our world and occur in flowers, fruits, 
plants, insects, and animals. It has been estimated that biosynthesis from acetate produces 
approximately a hundred million tons of carotenoids per year. The most familiar carotenoids 
are lycopene and β-carotene, pigments found in numerous plants and easily isolable from 
ripe tomatoes and carrots, respectively.

Crocuses Make Saffron from Carotenes
The flowers of Crocus sativus are not only pretty, they are 
valuable. The saffron crocus is cultivated on a large scale 
because the three gold-colored filaments in each bloom are the 
source of saffron, a dye and a spice that has been used for thou￾sands of years. The amount is small; 75,000 flowers are needed 
to provide 1 pound of saffron, yet 300 tons of it reach the world￾wide market each year.
Saffron is a mixture of substances. Those that make it 
desirable as a spice and dye are among the ones the plant uses 
to attract insects. Two of them, crocetin and crocin, are mainly 
responsible for its color, another (safranal) its odor, and another 
(picrocrocin) its taste. The same 20-carbon conjugated polyene 
unit is the chromophore that gives crocetin and crocin their yel￾low color. The difference between the two is that crocin is a 
glycoside in which both carboxylic acid functions of crocetin are 
attached to a disaccharide (gentiobiose) by ester linkages.

Not all carotenoids are hydrocarbons. Oxygen-containing carotenes called xantho￾phylls, which are often the pigments responsible for the yellow color of flowers, are 
especially abundant.
Carotenoids absorb visible light (see Section 14.23) and dissipate its energy as heat, 
providing protection from the potentially harmful effects of sunlight-induced photochem￾istry. They are also indirectly involved in the chemistry of vision, owing to the fact that 
β-carotene is the biosynthetic precursor of vitamin A, also known as retinol, a key sub￾stance in the visual process.

Problem 24.16
Can you find the isoprene units in crocetin, crocin, safranal, and picrocrocin?
The 20-carbon chromophore originates in biochemical degrada￾tion of β-carotene and related carotenoids. Enzyme-catalyzed 
Safranal and picrocrocin are both aldehydes. Their struc￾tures suggest that they too come from carotenoid precursors. 
Because it is volatile, safranal contributes to the odor that 
attracts insects to the flowers. Picrocrocin is a glycoside. Its 
oxidation cleaves the double bonds at the points indicated to 
give crocetin.
ability to participate in hydrogen bonding makes it nonvolatile

Section 24.1 Chemists and biochemists find it convenient to divide the principal organic 
substances present in cells into four main groups: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic 
acids, and lipids. Structural differences separate carbohydrates from proteins, and 
both of these are structurally distinct from nucleic acids. Lipids are characterized 
by a physical property, their solubility in nonpolar solvents, rather than by their 
structure. In this chapter we have examined lipid molecules that share a common 
biosynthetic origin in that all their carbons are derived from acetic acid (acetate).

acetyl coenzyme A, represented for convenience as:

Many polyketides have one or more methyl substituents on their carbon chain. In some cases 
S-adenosylmethionine is the source of a methyl group; in others methylmalonyl CoA (from

The number and complexity of structural types that can arise via polyketides is magnified 
when one realizes that other reactions involving the carbon chain and its carbonyl groups can 
precede or follow cyclization. Although the number of polyketides for which precise biosynthetic 
details are known is limited, reasonable suggestions can be made as to their main elements based 
on a few basic principles of organic reaction mechanisms.

Amino Acids, Peptides, 
and Proteins
The relationship between structure and function reaches its ulti￾mate expression in the chemistry of amino acids, peptides, and 
proteins.
Amino acids are carboxylic acids that contain an amine 
function. An amide bond between the carboxylic acid function 
of one amino acid and the amino nitrogen of another is called 
a peptide bond.

A dipeptide is a molecule consisting of two amino acids joined 
by a peptide bond. A tripeptide has three amino acids joined by 
two peptide bonds, a tetrapeptide has four amino acids, and so 
on. Peptides with more than 30–50 amino acids are polypeptides.
Proteins are polypeptides that have some biological function.
The most striking thing about proteins is the diversity of 
their roles in living systems: silk is a protein, skin and hair are 
mostly proteins, many hormones are proteins, a protein carries 
Horses and many other animals, including humans, must obtain lysine 
from the food they eat because they can’t biosynthesize it; thus, it is one 
of several “essential” amino acids. Commercial animal feed is often 
enriched in lysine obtained by methods based in biotechnology.

oxygen from the lungs to the tissues where it is stored by another protein, and all enzymes 
are proteins.
As in most aspects of chemistry and biochemistry, structure is the key to function. We’ll 
explore the structure of proteins by first concentrating on their fundamental building-block 
units, the α-amino acids. Then, after developing the principles of peptide structure, we’ll see 
how the insights gained from these smaller molecules aid our understanding of proteins.
25.1 Classification of Amino Acids
Amino acids are classified as α, β, γ, and so on, according to the location of the amine 
group on the carbon chain that contains the carboxylic acid function.

Although more than 700 different amino acids are known to occur naturally, the 
group of 20 α-amino acids called the standard amino acids listed in Table 25.1 com￾mands special attention. These 20 are coded for in DNA-directed protein synthesis, and 
all except proline are characterized by the general formula shown where R is a side chain. 
Proline has a cyclic side chain that incorporates the α-amino function.

Two different formats are widely used to abbreviate the names of the standard amino 
acids. One employs three letters, the other one. Both are given in the table. Our bodies 
make 12 of the standard amino acids; the other 8 are called essential amino acids, which 
have to be obtained from our diet and are so noted in the table.
The most important aspect of Table 25.1 is that although the 20 standard amino 
acids share the common feature of being α-amino acids, their side chains differ in respect 
to their:
1. Size and shape
2. Electronic characteristics; acid–base properties; and ability to engage in ionic bonding, 
covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces.
Table 25.1 shows the amino acids in the form in which they exist at physiological pH (7.4): 
amine groups as positively charged ammonium ions, and carboxylic acid groups as 
negatively charged carboxylates. Their electrostatic potential maps compare their shape 
and charge distribution.
Amino acids can be grouped by the chemical properties of their side chains. This 
grouping is a guide, since many side chains have properties common to more than one 
group.

TABLE 25.1 The Standard Amino Acids (Continued)1044 Chapter 25 Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
in Table 25.1—alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine—all have simple alkyl groups as 
side chains: methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, and sec-butyl, respectively. Like aliphatic hydro￾carbons, the aliphatic side chains of amino acids are quite unreactive. These side chains 
are hydrophobic and, although electronically similar, differ in size and shape.
Proline is an aliphatic amino acid that serves important and unique structural roles 
in proteins. It is sometimes referred to by the archaic term imino acid because of the 
bond between the side chain methylene and the α-amino group. The five-membered ring 
restricts the conformation of the amino acid and peptide bonds between proline and other 
amino acids. Connective tissue proteins such as collagen are rich in proline.
Aromatic Amino Acids: Three amino acid side chains contain substituted benzene 
rings. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan absorb ultraviolet light (absorption max￾ima at ∼260, 270, and 280 nm, respectively) and are responsible for the lower-energy 
absorption and fluorescence bands observed in many proteins. Phenylalanine and 
tryptophan are hydrophobic and are usually found on the interior of proteins. Owing to 
its phenolic side chain, tyrosine can serve additional roles in a protein, including hydrogen 
bond donor and acceptor. It can also participate in some enzymatic reactions.
Aliphatic Amino Acids with Polar but Nonionized Side Chains: Two amino acids 
contain an alcohol in the side chain. Serine is a small primary alcohol and serves many 
functions in proteins. It is frequently found on the surface of proteins and as part of the 
active site of enzymes as a hydrogen bond donor, a hydrogen bond acceptor, and a nucleo￾phile. Threonine has a methyl group in place of one of the hydrogens of the CH2OH 
group of serine, sterically hindering the hydroxyl group. It is less effective than serine in 
hydrogen bonding and it almost never behaves as a nucleophile in an enzyme.
Cysteine is related to serine except that its side chain is CH2SH rather than 
CH2OH. This apparently minor difference in structure makes a huge difference in its 
role in proteins. Recall from Section 16.12 that the —SH group is a weaker acid, is a 
better nucleophile, and is more easily oxidized than the —OH group. When two cysteines 
are joined through side chain oxidation (CH2SSCH2), the dimeric amino acid 
product is referred to as cystine. The number of cysteines in a protein is often relatively 
small, but they often serve important functions in the three-dimensional shape of proteins 
owing to their ability to undergo reversible oxidation to disulfide bonds. Within a protein, 
two oxidized cysteines form a disulfide bridge. These covalent bonds can link remote 
amino acids and are often critically important in the proper folding and maintenance of 
three-dimensional structures of proteins.
The other sulfur-containing amino acid is methionine. In terms of protein structure, 
the thioether-containing methionine has properties similar to those of aliphatic amino 
acids. As a free amino acid, however, it plays a vital role in cellular metabolism as the 
“universal methyl donor,” S-adenosylmethionine.

Asparagine and glutamine are primary amides. The side chains of both terminate 
in C(O)NH2 and differ by only a single CH2 group. As typical primary amides, they 
are not nucleophilic and do not form covalent bonds in enzymic reactions. Amide func￾tions are quite polar and interact strongly with water molecules by hydrogen bonding. 
Like serine, asparagine and glutamine are often found in regions of a peptide that are in 
contact with water.25.1 Classification of Amino Acids 1045
Amino Acids with Acidic Side Chains: Two of the standard amino acids have car￾boxylic acids in their side chains: aspartic acid (CH2COOH) and glutamic acid
(CH2CH2COOH). The electrostatic potential maps of aspartic acid and glutamic acid
are two of the most prominent ones in Table 25.1. The CO2H side chains of both 
aspartic and glutamic acid are essentially completely deprotonated to CO2
–
 at biologi￾cal pH, giving these species the most electron-rich units of all of the common amino 
acids. Their functions in protein structure include ionic bonding to positively charged 
species such as metal ions and ammonium ions.
Amino Acids with Basic Side Chains: Three of the standard amino acids are bases. 
Two of the three are protonated at physiological pH. Lysine, CH2CH2CH2CH2NH2, 
possesses four methylene groups in its side chain. Its acid–base properties are similar 
to those of an aliphatic amine (Section 22.4). The second basic amino acid, arginine, 
is the most basic standard amino acid. The traditionally accepted pKa value of arginine 
(12.5) has been recently measured using modern spectroscopic techniques to be 13.8. 
Its pKa approaches the pKa of hydroxide, and it is always protonated in proteins. Argi￾nine is so basic because its functional group is not a primary amine, but a four-atom 
functional group called guanidine. Protonation of the imine-like nitrogen of arginine 
forms a cationic species in which the positive charge is delocalized over all three 
nitrogens of the functional group. The electrostatic maps of these two amino acids in 
Table 25.1 illustrate the localized charge on the lysine amine versus the delocalized 
charge on the arginine guanidine.
The side chain of histidine has a functional group we saw in Section 22.4, an 
imidazole. This aromatic heterocycle has a pKa of approximately 6 in the free amino 
acid, which means that just a small portion of the side chains of the free amino acid is 
protonated at neutral pH. Why, then, is it grouped with the basic amino acids? As noted 
earlier, not all amino acid side chains are neatly categorized by a single chemical property. 
Histidine is located in many enzyme active sites and often serves a dual role as both a 
proton donor (in its positively charged form) and a proton acceptor (in its neutral form). 
Protonation of histidine produces a species in which the positive charge is delocalized 
over both nitrogens of the side chain. Removal of either proton returns histidine to its 
neutral state. This property of the amino acid allows it to accomplish a net transfer of 
protons through space. Its ability to act as part of a “proton relay” system is important 
in the catalytic activity of a number of enzymes.
Nonstandard Amino Acids: Peptides sometimes contain an amino acid different from 
the 20 shown in Table 25.1. Dehydroalanine, for example, is a component of a toxic 
substance produced by a strain of cyanogenic bacteria, and hydroxyproline is a component 
of the collagen in connective tissue.

Like most nonstandard amino acids, dehydroalanine and hydroxyproline are formed by 
modification of one of the standard amino acids that has already been incorporated into 
a peptide. Two nonstandard amino acids—selenocysteine and pyrrolysine—the so-called 
“twenty-first and twenty-second amino acids,” however, are coded for by DNA.

Organic chemists are capable of creating amino acids with functionality not found 
in nature. New techniques in molecular biology are allowing scientists to use an organism’s 
own ribosomal protein biosynthesis apparati. “Noncanonical” or “unnatural” amino acid 
mutagenesis has been developed to place synthetic amino acids into the linear sequence 
of proteins. Just a few of the many noncanonical amino acids that have been inserted 
into proteins using this technology are shown.

Problem 25.1
Section 25.2 deals with amino acid stereochemistry. You can prepare for it by locating all of 
the chirality centers in the nonstandard amino acids just shown and specifying their 
configuration using the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog R,S notation.
25.2 Stereochemistry of Amino Acids
Glycine is the only amino acid in Table 25.1 that is achiral; the α-carbon atom is a 
chirality center in all the others. Configurations in amino acids are normally specified 
by the d,l notational system, which has been described in Section 23.2. Recall that the 
d,l system describes a three-dimensional structure relative to the stereochemistry of 
glyceraldehyde. All the chiral amino acids obtained from proteins have the l-configuration 
at their α-carbon atom, meaning that the amine group is at the left when a Fischer 
projection is arranged so the carboxyl group is at the top.

The absolute configuration of l-cysteine is R.
This example illustrates the difference between designating relative stereochemistry 
(d,l) and absolute stereochemistry (R,S). The side chain of an amino acid is in the same 
location in three-dimensional space in all l-amino acids, which is more clearly illustrated 
using relative stereochemistry. This relationship is not necessarily clear when the 
configuration of the α carbon is defined using Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) rules.
Problem 25.3
The amino acid l-threonine is (2S,3R)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid. Draw a Fischer 
projection and line formula for l-threonine.
Although all the chiral amino acids resulting from ribosomal protein biosynthesis 
have the l-configuration at their α carbon, that should not be taken to mean that d-amino 
acids are unknown. In fact, quite a number of d-amino acids occur naturally. It has long 
been known that bacterial cell walls contain peptides with d-alanine. Antibiotics such as 
penicillin are toxic to the microbes but not to humans because they target an enzyme 
necessary in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis that recognizes the sequence d-Ala-d-Ala. 
d-Ser and d-Asp are involved in mammalian neurological function, although their roles 
are not well understood. It has been hypothesized that increased levels of d-serine may 
be involved in conditions such as schizophrenia.
A novel technique for dating archaeological samples called amino acid racemization 
(AAR) is based on the stereochemistry of amino acids. Over time, the configuration at the 
α-carbon atom of a protein’s amino acids is lost in a reaction that follows first-order kinetics. 
When the α carbon is the only chirality center, this process corresponds to racemization. 
For an amino acid with two chirality centers, changing the configuration of the α carbon 
from l to d gives a diastereomer. In the case of isoleucine, for example, the diastereomer 
is an amino acid not normally present in proteins, called alloisoleucine.

By measuring the l-isoleucine/d-alloisoleucine ratio in the protein isolated from the 
eggshells of an extinct Australian bird, it was determined that this bird lived approxi￾mately 50,000 years ago. Radiocarbon (14C) dating is not accurate for samples older 
than about 35,000 years, so AAR is a useful addition to the tools available to 
paleontologists.
25.3 Acid–Base Behavior of Amino Acids
The physical properties of a typical amino acid such as glycine suggest that it is a very 
polar substance, much more polar than would be expected on the basis of its formulation 
as H2NCH2CO2H. Glycine is a crystalline solid; it does not melt, but on being heated it 
eventually decomposes at 233°C. It is very soluble in water but practically insoluble in 
nonpolar organic solvents. These properties are attributed to the fact that the stable form 
of glycine in neutral aqueous solution is a zwitterion.

−. How 
do we know this? Aside from its physical properties, the acid–base properties of 
glycine, as illustrated by the titration curve in Figure 25.1, require it. In a strongly 
acidic medium the species present is the cation H3N

CH2CO2H. As the pH is raised, 
its most acidic proton is removed. Is this proton removed from the positively charged 
nitrogen or from the carboxyl group? We know what to expect for the relative acid 
strengths of RN+
H3 and RCO2H. A typical ammonium ion has pKa ≈ 9, and a typical 
carboxylic acid has pKa ≈ 5. The measured pKa for the conjugate acid of glycine is 
2.34, a value closer to that expected for deprotonation of the carboxyl group. As the 
pH is raised, a second deprotonation step, corresponding to removal of a proton from 
The zwitterion is also often referred to 
as a dipolar ion. Note, however, that it 
is not an ion, but a neutral molecule.

Thus, glycine is characterized by two pKa values: the one corresponding to the more 
acidic site is designated pKa1, the one corresponding to the less acidic site is designated 
pKa2. Table 25.2 lists pKa1 and pKa2 values for the α-amino acids that have neutral side 
chains, which are the first three groups of amino acids given in Table 25.1. In all cases 
their pKa values are similar to those of glycine.
Table 25.2 includes a column labeled pI, which is the isoelectric point of the 
amino acid. The isoelectric point, also called the isoionic point, is the pH at which 
the amino acid has no net charge. It is the pH at which the concentration of the 
zwitterion is a maximum. At a pH lower than pI, the amino acid is positively charged; 
at a pH higher than pI, the amino acid is negatively charged. For the amino acids 
in  Table 25.2, pI is the average of pKa1 and pKa2 and lies slightly to the acid side 
of neutrality.
Some amino acids have side chains that bear acidic or basic groups. As Table 25.3 
indicates, these amino acids are characterized by three pKa values. The third pKa

reflects the nature of the side chain. Acidic amino acids (aspartic and glutamic acid) 
have acidic side chains; basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, and histidine) have basic 
side chains.
The isoelectric points of the amino acids in Table 25.3 are midway between the 
pKa values of the zwitterion and its conjugate acid. Take two examples: aspartic acid 
and lysine. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain and a pI of 2.77. Lysine has a basic

Above a pH of about 10, the major species present in a solution of tyrosine has a net charge

Individual amino acids differ in their acid–base properties. This is important in 
peptides and proteins, where the properties of the substance depend on its amino acid 
constituents, especially on the nature of the side chains. It is also important in analyses 
in which a complex mixture of amino acids is separated into its components by taking 
advantage of the differences in their proton-donating and accepting power.1051
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis is a method for separation and purification 
that depends on the movement of charged particles in an 
electric field. Its principles can be introduced by considering 
some representative amino acids. The medium is a cellulose 
acetate strip that is moistened with an aqueous solution buff￾ered at a particular pH. The opposite ends of the strip are placed 
in separate compartments containing the buffer, and each 
compartment is connected to a source of direct electric current 
(Figure 25.2a). If the buffer solution is more acidic than the iso￾electric point (pI) of the amino acid, the amino acid has a net 
positive charge and migrates toward the negatively charged 
electrode. Conversely, when the buffer is more basic than the pI 
of the amino acid, the amino acid has a net negative charge and 
migrates toward the positively charged electrode. When the pH 
of the buffer corresponds to the pI, the amino acid has no net 
charge and does not migrate from the origin.
Thus, if a mixture containing alanine, aspartic acid, and lysine 
is subjected to electrophoresis in a buffer that matches the isoelec￾tric point of alanine (pH 6.0), aspartic acid (pI = 2.8) migrates toward 
the positive electrode, alanine remains at the origin, and lysine 
(pI = 9.7) migrates toward the negative electrode (Figure 25.2b).

Electrophoresis is used primarily to analyze mixtures of 
peptides and proteins, rather than individual amino acids, but 
analogous principles apply. Because they incorporate different 
numbers of amino acids and because their side chains are dif￾ferent, two peptides will have slightly different acid–base prop￾erties and slightly different net charges at a particular pH. Thus, 
their mobilities in an electric field will be different, and electro￾phoresis can be used to separate them. The medium used to 
separate peptides and proteins is typically a polyacrylamide 
gel, leading to the term gel electrophoresis for this technique.
A second factor that governs the rate of migration 
during electrophoresis is the size (length and shape) of the 
peptide or protein. Larger molecules move through the poly￾acrylamide gel more slowly than smaller ones. In current prac￾tice, the experiment is modified to exploit differences in size 
more than differences in net charge, especially in the SDS gel 
electrophoresis of proteins. Approximately 1.5 g of the deter￾gent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) per gram of protein is 
added to the aqueous buffer. SDS binds to the protein, caus￾ing the protein to unfold so that it is roughly rod-shaped with 
the CH3(CH2)10CH2 groups of SDS associated with the lipo￾philic (hydrophobic) portions of the protein. The negatively 
charged sulfate groups are exposed to the water. The SDS 
molecules that they carry ensure that all the protein molecules 
are negatively charged and migrate toward the positive elec￾trode. Furthermore, all the proteins in the mixture now have 
similar shapes and tend to travel at rates proportional to their 
chain length. Thus, when carried out on a preparative scale, 
SDS gel electrophoresis permits proteins in a mixture to be 
separated according to their molecular weight. On an analyti￾cal scale, it is used to estimate the molecular weight of a pro￾tein by comparing its electrophoretic mobility with that of 
proteins of known molecular weight.

A second method, called the Strecker synthesis, combines both functional-group 
manipulation and chain extension to give an α-amino acid having one more carbon atom 
than the aldehyde. It begins with two nucleophilic additions that convert the aldehyde to 
an aminonitrile, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile function.

have been developed employ specialized chiral reagents or catalysts and feature enantio￾selective generation of a chirality center by nucleophilic addition to an imine.

25.6 Peptides
A key biochemical reaction of amino acids is their conversion to peptides, polypeptides, 
and proteins. In all these substances amino acids are linked together by amide bonds. 
The amide bond between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl of another 
is called a peptide bond. Alanylglycine is a representative dipeptide.

By agreement, peptide structures are written so that the amino group (as H3N

 or 
H2N) is at the left and the carboxyl group (as CO2
− or CO2H) is at the right. The left 
and right ends of the peptide are referred to as the N terminus (or amino terminus) and 
the C terminus (or carboxyl terminus), respectively. Alanine is the N-terminal amino 
acid in alanylglycine; glycine is the C-terminal amino acid. A dipeptide is named as an 
acyl derivative of the C-terminal amino acid. The precise order of bonding in a peptide 
(its amino acid sequence) is conveniently specified by using the three-letter amino acid 
abbreviations for the respective amino acids and connecting them by hyphens. One-letter 
abbreviations are used without punctuation. Individual amino acid components of peptides 
are often referred to as amino acid residues.

Figure 25.3 shows the structure of Ala-Gly as determined by X-ray crystallography. 
An important feature is the planar geometry of the peptide bond, and the most stable 
conformation with respect to this bond has the two α-carbon atoms anti to each other. 
Rotation about the amide bond is slow because delocalization of the unshared electron 
pair of nitrogen into the carbonyl group gives partial double-bond character to the 
carbon–nitrogen bond.
In addition to its planar geometry, the amide bond affects the structure of peptides in 
another important way. The NH and the CO units are candidates for hydrogen bonding 
with other peptide linkages both within the same and with adjacent polypeptide chains.

Peptides having structures slightly different from those described to this point are 
known. One such variation is seen in the nonapeptide oxytocin, shown in Figure 25.4. 
Oxytocin is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates uterine contractions 
during childbirth and promotes lactation. Rather than terminating in a carboxyl group, 
the C-terminal glycine residue in oxytocin has been modified to become its correspond￾ing amide. Two cysteine units, one of them the N-terminal amino acid, are joined by the 
sulfur–sulfur bond of a large-ring cyclic disulfide unit. This is a common structural 
modification in polypeptides and proteins that contain cysteine residues. It provides a 
covalent bond between regions of peptide chains that may be many amino acid residues 
removed from each other.

25.7 Introduction to Peptide Structure Determination
There are several levels of peptide structure. The primary structure is the amino acid 
sequence plus any disulfide links. With the 20 amino acids of Table 25.1 as building 
blocks, 202
 dipeptides, 203
 tripeptides, 204
 tetrapeptides, and so on, are possible. Given 
a peptide of unknown structure, how do we determine its amino acid sequence?
In this section we will first show how peptide sequencing was first accomplished, 
which was a monumental achievement in the 1940s. Then we will show the modern 
chemical method for peptide sequencing, which is still performed today. Finally, we will 
introduce the most recent advance in peptide sequencing, which is performed by mass 
spectrometry.
We’ll describe peptide structure determination by first looking at one of the great 
achievements of biochemistry, the determination of the amino acid sequence of insulin 
by Frederick Sanger of Cambridge University (England). Sanger was awarded the 1958 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work, which he began in 1944 and completed 10 years 
later. The methods used by Sanger and his coworkers are dated by now, but the overall 
logic remains important.
Sanger’s strategy can be outlined as follows:
1. Determine what amino acids are present and their molar ratios.
2. Cleave the peptide into smaller fragments, separate these fragments, and determine 
the amino acid composition of the fragments.
3. Identify the N-terminal and the C-terminal amino acid in the original peptide and 
in each fragment.
4. Organize the information so that the amino acid sequences of small fragments can 
be overlapped to reveal the full sequence.
25.8 Amino Acid Analysis
Determining what amino acids are present and their ratios begins with hydrolysis of the 
amide bonds. The peptide is hydrolyzed by heating in 6 M hydrochloric acid to give a 
solution that contains all of the amino acids. Analysis of the mixture in terms of its 
components and their relative amounts is typically done by chromatographic methods.
These methods flow from the work of Stanford Moore and William H. Stein of 
Rockefeller University, who developed automated techniques for separating and identify￾ing amino acids. In their original work, Moore and Stein used ion-exchange chromato￾graphy. Modern methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are 
both faster and more selective for separating the individual amino acids in a mixture. 
Either before or after their separation, the amino acids are allowed to react (“tagged”) 
with a substance that bears a group—a naphthalene ring, for example—that fluoresces. 
The fluorescence is strong enough so that modern analyzers can detect the amino acids 
obtained from 10−5 to 10−7g of peptide.
Problem 25.15
Amino acid analysis of a certain tetrapeptide gave alanine, glycine, phenylalanine, and valine 
in equimolar amounts. What amino acid sequences are possible for this tetrapeptide?
25.9 Partial Hydrolysis and End Group Analysis
Whereas acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptides cleaves amide bonds indiscriminately and 
eventually breaks all of them, enzymatic hydrolysis is much more selective and is the 
method used to convert a peptide into smaller fragments.
The enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds are called peptidases.
Trypsin, a digestive enzyme present in the intestine, catalyzes only the hydrolysis of peptide 
Sanger was a corecipient of a second 
Nobel Prize in 1980 for devising 
methods for sequencing nucleic acids. 
Sanger’s strategy for nucleic acid 
sequencing is described in 
Section 26.13.
Moore and Stein shared one half of 
the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Fluorescence is the emission of

absorbed radiation of a higher 
frequency.

bonds involving the carboxyl group of a lysine or arginine residue. Chymotrypsin, another 
digestive enzyme, is selective for peptide bonds involving the carboxyl group of amino acids 
with aromatic side chains (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan). One group of pancreatic 
enzymes, known as carboxypeptidases, catalyzes only the hydrolysis of the peptide bond to 
the C-terminal amino acid. In addition to these, many other digestive enzymes are known 
and their selectivity exploited in the selective hydrolysis of peptides.

Digestion of the tetrapeptide of Problem 25.15 with chymotrypsin gave a dipeptide that on 
amino acid analysis gave phenylalanine and valine in equimolar amounts. What amino acid 
sequences are possible for the tetrapeptide?
An amino acid sequence is ambiguous unless we know the direction in which to 
read it—left to right, or right to left. We need to know which end is the N terminus and 
which is the C terminus. As we’ve just seen, carboxypeptidase-catalyzed hydrolysis cleaves 
the C-terminal amino acid and so can be used to identify it. What about the N terminus?
Several chemical methods take advantage of the fact that the N-terminal amino 
group can act as a nucleophile. The α-amino groups of all the other amino acids are part 
of amide linkages and are much less nucleophilic. Sanger’s method for N-terminal resi￾due analysis involves treating a peptide with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, which is very 
reactive toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution (see Chapter 13).
O2N F

1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
Nucleophiles attack here,
displacing fluoride.
The amino group of the N-terminal amino acid displaces fluoride from 1-fluoro￾2,4-dinitrobenzene and gives a peptide in which the N terminus is labeled with a 
2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) group. This process is shown for Val-Phe-Gly-Ala in 
Figure 25.5. The 2,4-dinitrophenyl-labeled peptide DNP-Val-Phe-Gly-Ala is isolated and 
subjected to hydrolysis, after which the 2,4-dinitrophenyl derivative of the N-terminal 
amino acid is isolated and identified as DNP-Val by comparing its chromatographic 
behavior with that of standard samples of DNP-labeled amino acids. None of the other 
amino acid residues bear a 2,4-dinitrophenyl group; they appear in the hydrolysis product 
as the free amino acids.
Labeling the N-terminal amino acid as its DNP derivative is mainly of historical 
interest and has been replaced by other methods. We’ll discuss one of these—the Edman 
degradation—in Section 25.11. First, though, we’ll complete our review of the general 
strategy for peptide sequencing by seeing how Sanger tied all of the information together 
into a structure for insulin.

commonly referred to as Sanger’s 
reagent.1060 Chapter 25 Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
25.10 Insulin
Sanger worked with insulin from cows, which has 51 amino acids, divided between two 
chains. One of these, the A chain, has 21 amino acids; the other, the B chain, has 30. 
The A and B chains are joined by disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (Cys-Cys). 
Figure 25.6 shows some of the information that defines the amino acid sequence of the 
B chain.
■ Reaction of the B chain peptide with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene established that 
phenylalanine is the N terminus.
■ Pepsin-catalyzed hydrolysis gave the four peptides shown in blue in Figure 25.6. 
(Their sequences were determined in separate experiments.) These four peptides 
contain 27 of the 30 amino acids in the B chain, but there are no points of overlap 
between them.
■ The sequences of the four tetrapeptides shown in red in Figure 25.6 bridge the gaps 
between three of the four “blue” peptides to give an unbroken sequence from 1 
through 24.
■ The peptide shown in green was isolated by trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis and has 
an amino acid sequence that completes the remaining overlaps.
The collection of sequenced fragments constitutes the peptide map for insulin.

Sanger also determined the sequence of the A chain and identified the cysteine 
residues involved in disulfide bonds between the A and B chains as well as in the disul￾fide linkage within the A chain. The complete insulin structure is shown in Figure 25.7. 
The structure shown is that of bovine insulin. The A chains of human insulin and bovine 
insulin differ in only two amino acid residues; their B chains are identical except for the 
amino acid at the C terminus.

25.11 Edman Degradation and Automated 
Sequencing of Peptides
When Sanger’s method for N-terminal residue analysis was discussed, you may have 
wondered why it was not done sequentially. Simply start at the N terminus and work 
steadily back to the C terminus identifying one amino acid after another. The idea is 
fine, but it just doesn’t work well in practice, at least with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene.
A major advance was devised by Pehr Edman (University of Lund, Sweden) that 
became the standard method for N-terminal residue analysis. The Edman degradation is 
based on the chemistry shown in Mechanism 25.1. A peptide reacts with phenyl isothiocyanate 
to give a phenylthiocarbamoyl (PTC) derivative, as shown in the first step. This PTC deriv￾ative is then treated with an acid in an anhydrous medium (Edman used nitromethane satu￾rated with hydrogen chloride) to cleave the amide bond between the N-terminal amino acid 
and the remainder of the peptide. No other peptide bonds are cleaved in this step as amide 
bond hydrolysis requires water. When the PTC derivative is treated with acid in an anhydrous 
medium, the sulfur atom of the CS unit acts as an internal nucleophile, and the only 
amide bond cleaved under these conditions is the one to the N-terminal amino acid. The

product of this cleavage, called a thiazolone, is unstable under the conditions of its formation 
and rearranges to a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH), which is isolated and identified by compar￾ing it with standard samples of PTH derivatives of known amino acids. This is normally 
done by chromatographic methods, but mass spectrometry has also been used.
Only the N-terminal amide bond is broken in the Edman degradation; the rest of the 
peptide chain remains intact. It can be isolated and subjected to a second Edman procedure 
to determine its new N terminus. We can proceed along a peptide chain by beginning with 
the N terminus and determining each amino acid in order. The sequence is given directly 
by the structure of the PTH derivative formed in each successive degradation.
Problem 25.17
Give the structure of the PTH derivative isolated in the second Edman cycle of the tetrapeptide 
Val-Phe-Gly-Ala.
Ideally, one could determine the primary structure of even the largest protein 
by repeating the Edman procedure. Because anything less than 100% conversion in 
any single Edman degradation gives a mixture containing some of the original pep￾tide along with the degraded one, two different PTH derivatives are formed in the 
Figure 25.8
The Edman degradation is performed by attaching the peptide of interest to a resin (solid phase) through its 
carboxyl terminus. The amino acid PTH derivative is released into solution and separated from the rest of the 
peptide for identification. The resin bound peptide is then available for the next series of Edman reactions.

next Edman cycle, and the ideal is not realized in practice. After about 20 amino 
acids, possible mixtures become problematic. Instead, the protein of interest is 
cleaved into smaller fragments using proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin and chymo
-
trypsin (Section 25.9) and other cleavage techniques. The fragments are then attached 
to a polymeric support by their carboxyl terminus and the chemical reactions of the 
Edman degradation are performed on the resin. The released PTH amino acid is 
then washed from the resin and identified. The remaining peptide is still attached 
to the resin, exposing the amino terminus of the next amino acid, and the cycle is 
repeated (Figure 25.8).
As may be evident by the repetitive nature of the processes, the Edman degradation 
can be automated. Edman protein sequencers are commercially available, and current 
instrumentation can reliably sequence as little as 10 pmol of a peptide.
25.12 Mass Spectrometry of Peptides 
and Proteins
The use of mass spectrometry in protein analysis has revolutionized many areas of 
research and medicine. First developed to sequence unknown peptides, increasing 
sophistication in instrumentation and computational resources have made protein mass 
spectrometry an indispensable tool in modern biochemical research. Proteomics, 
which is the study of proteins in cells, tissues, and organisms, would be impractical 
if not impossible without mass spectrometry. Using large databases of protein mass 
spectrometry data and present-day computation power, scientists can identify multiple 
proteins in complex mixtures and correlate this information with a myriad of cellular 
processes and diseases.
Protein sequencing by mass spectrometry is generally used for peptides prepared 
by chemical synthesis, for proteins unknown to a database, and for particularly difficult 
peptides, such as ones that might be found in proteins with unusual post-translational 
modifications. The general principles of mass spectrometry were introduced in 
Section  14.24 and are briefly reiterated here. Molecules are vaporized into the gas 
phase and are ionized in different ways, depending on a particular application. The 
charged particles are accelerated by magnetic fields and are deflected to an ion detec
-
tor. In protein mass spectrometry, an ionization technique called MALDI can create 
ions from large molecules. Measurement of the ion time-of-flight (TOF) of the charged 
molecules is used to determine the 
m
/
z ratios. (See the boxed essay Peptide Mapping 
and MALDI Mass Spectrometry.)
One utility of mass spectrometry in organic chemistry is that molecular ions 
containing certain functional groups tend to break into fragments in predictable ways. 
The 
m
/
z of these fragments limit and often define the functional groups contained in 
the unknown molecule. This principle is used in tandem mass spectrometry (often 
called tandem mass spectrometry, or MS/MS) to directly determine the sequence of 
the peptide ion.
A simplified diagram of a hypothetical peptide is shown in Figure 25.10. In tandem 
mass spectrometry, peptide ions are deflected into a separate chamber and are broken 
into smaller ions (collision-induced dissociation). Each bond of the peptide backbone can 
fragment at the three different types of bond: CO
NH, CH
CO, and NH
CH. For 
simplicity, the locations of only CO
NH bond cleavages are shown. Each bond break￾age produces two species, one charged and one uncharged. Charged N-terminal fragments 
are called B-ions, while charged C-terminal fragments are called Y-ions. For example, 
cleavage at B
1 would yield the charged fragment shown; the other fragment will be 
uncharged and therefore not seen by the detector. Cleavage at just B
2 would also give a 
charged N-terminal fragment. The difference in the 
m
/z of B
1 and B
2 will yield the mass 
of the amino acid containing R
2. Exact masses of the various amino acids (and frequently 
common post-translationally modified amino acids) are then consulted to identify the 
particular amino acid.25.12 Mass Spectrometry of Peptides and Proteins 1065
Peptide Mapping and MALDI Mass Spectrometry
Biological materials often contain proteins that must be iden￾tified. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have made 
peptide mapping a convenient tool for this purpose. The protein 
in question is selectively hydrolyzed with a peptidase such as 
trypsin and the mixture of peptides produced is analyzed by 
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) as illustrated 
in Figure 25.9.
MALDI offers two main advantages over traditional mass 
spectrometric methods.
1. Substances, such as peptides, that lack sufficient volatility 
to be vaporized for analysis by conventional mass spec￾trometry can be vaporized by MALDI.
2. The species analyzed by the mass spectrometer is the con￾jugate acid of a peptide (peptide + H+). Unlike the highly 
energetic ions generated by electron impact (see Section 
14.24), the cations produced by MALDI have little tendency 
to fragment. Consequently, a mixture of peptide fragments 
gives a mass spectrum dominated by peaks with m/z values 
corresponding to those of the individual protonated 
peptides.
With the aid of freely available Internet tools and data￾bases, the MALDI data set is compared with known proteins to 
generate a list of potential matches. The analyst inputs the pep￾tidase used to digest the original protein and the m/z values of 
the peptides displayed in the MALDI spectrum. As specified by 
the search criteria, the search delivers (in a matter seconds!) a 
list of peptide sequences and the proteins these sequences 
contain. Next, a different peptidase is used to hydrolyze the 
protein, to provide a second set of peptides that are also ana￾lyzed by MALDI and matched against the database. MALDI mass 
spectrometry compares the amino acid composition of 
unsequenced peptides with the amino acid sequence of known 
proteins in order to identify an unknown protein. The procedure 
is repeated until the list of potential matches is narrowed to a 
single known protein, additional data are needed, or it becomes 
likely that the protein is new.
Problem 25.18
Which two of the standard amino acids cannot be differentiated on the basis of their m/z ratio?

25.13 The Strategy of Peptide Synthesis
One way to confirm the structure proposed for a peptide is to synthesize a peptide having 
a specific sequence of amino acids and compare the two. This was done, for example, 
in the case of bradykinin, a peptide present in blood that acts to lower blood pressure. 
Excess bradykinin, formed as a response to the sting of wasps and other insects contain￾ing substances in their venom that stimulate bradykinin release, causes severe local pain. 
Bradykinin was originally believed to be an octapeptide containing two proline residues; 
however, a nonapeptide containing three prolines in the following sequence was synthe￾sized and determined to be identical with natural bradykinin in every respect, including 
biological activity:
Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg 
Bradykinin
or RPPGFSPFR
A reevaluation of the original sequence data established that natural bradykinin was 
indeed the nonapeptide shown. Here the synthesis of a peptide did more than confirm 
structure; synthesis was instrumental in determining structure.
The synthesis of peptides is an important area of drug development. For many years, 
the high cost of peptide synthesis and the rapid degradation of peptides when administered 
in the body hampered the progress of peptide drug discovery. Recent advances in peptide 
manufacturing and drug delivery have increased the use of peptide-based pharmaceuticals. 
Two of the most prominent peptide drugs are insulin and calcitonin.

The insulin required for the treatment of diabetes used to be obtained by extrac￾tion from the pancreas glands of cows and pigs. Since the early 1980s, this “natural” 
insulin has been replaced by “synthetic” human insulin prepared by recombinant DNA 
technology.
Recombinant DNA technology is widely used for the synthesis of peptides and 
proteins and can be exceptionally efficient in producing a desired product. Why, then, 
is it necessary to use chemical methods to synthesize peptides and proteins? One 
reason is the nature of protein biosynthesis. It is critical for an organism to make 
proteins that have the exact sequence of naturally occurring amino acids so it can 
perform its normal function in an organism. Even one mistake can have catastrophic 
consequences. For example, sickle cell anemia is the result of just one mutation in 
the protein hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in all red blood cells, in which 
a glutamic acid is replaced by a leucine (see Section 25.19). To avoid errors, the 
components of in vivo protein synthesis are finely tuned to faithfully translate the 
genomic message to create the correct protein. If the protein or peptide desired is 
composed of naturally occurring amino acids, recombinant DNA methods are often 
the most efficient way of synthesizing these products.
In some cases, though, it is desirable to join amino acids with bonds other than 
amides, to alter the side chain of an amino acid to a moiety not found in nature, or 
to change the stereochemistry of one or all of the amino acids in a biopolymer. Phar￾maceutical companies use all of these methods to increase the effectiveness, stability, 
and solubility of peptides used against human diseases. Biochemists use them to 
understand fundamental science. Chemists can synthesize natural peptides and pro￾teins and variations of these biopolymers not found in nature. We can understand how 
chemists do so based on what we have learned earlier in this book, but as we will 
see, there are some complications that we need to take into account to efficiently 
obtain the desired product.
The objective in peptide synthesis may be simply stated: to connect amino acids 
in a prescribed sequence by amide bond formation between them. A number of very 
effective methods and reagents have been designed for peptide bond formation, so that 
the joining together of amino acids by amide linkages is not difficult. The real diffi￾culty lies in ensuring that the correct sequence is obtained. This can be illustrated by 
considering the synthesis of a representative dipeptide, Phe-Gly. Random peptide bond 
formation in a mixture containing phenylalanine and glycine would be expected to lead 
to four dipeptides:
Phenylalanine
H3NCHCO2
−
CH2C6H5
Glycine
H3NCH2CO2
− + Phe-Gly + Phe-Phe + + Gly-Phe Gly-Gly + +
To direct the synthesis so that only Phe-Gly is formed, the amino group of phenyl￾alanine and the carboxyl group of glycine must be protected so that they cannot react 
under the conditions of peptide bond formation. We can represent the peptide bond 
formation step by the following equation, where X and Y are amine- and carboxyl￾protecting groups, respectively:

H1068 Chapter 25 Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins
Thus, the synthesis of a dipeptide of prescribed sequence requires at least three 
operations:
1. Protect the amino group of the N-terminal amino acid and the carboxyl group of 
the C-terminal amino acid.
2. Couple the two protected amino acids by amide bond formation between them.
3. Deprotect the amino group at the N terminus and the carboxyl group at the 
C terminus.
Higher peptides are prepared in an analogous way by a direct extension of the logic just 
outlined for the synthesis of dipeptides.
Sections 25.14 and 25.15 describe the chemistry associated with the protection and 
deprotection of amino and carboxyl functions, along with methods for peptide bond for￾mation. The focus in those sections is on solution-phase peptide synthesis. Section 25.16 
shows how these methods are adapted to solid-phase synthesis.
25.14 Amino and Carboxyl Group Protection 
and Deprotection
Amino groups are normally protected as their tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), carbobenzoxy￾carbonyl (Z), or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) derivative prepared as described in 
Section 25.5. The Boc group is usually removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid 
in an organic solvent. Other nonaqueous acidic reagents such as hydrogen bromide may 
also be used.

The tert-butyl group is cleaved as tert-butyl carbocation which, on deprotonation, gives 
2-methylpropene. Both of the derived products of the deprotection reaction are gases, 
which bubble out of the solution and drive the reaction to completion.
A benzyloxycarbonyl-protected amine is more stable than a Boc-protected amine 
and is not removed by treatment with room-temperature trifluoroacetic acid. It requires 
a stronger acid such as hydrogen bromide. The derived product from this reaction is 
benzyl bromide in addition to carbon dioxide.

Notice how the conditions for removal of the three amine protecting groups are orthogonal. 
These groups can protect three different amines and can be removed separately. For 
example, a Boc group may be removed to uncover one amine while other amines bonded 
to Z and Fmoc would remain protected. This type of strategy is used in peptide synthe￾sis so that side-chain functional groups will not undergo unwanted reactions. In our case, 
though, we will concern ourselves only with amino acids with unreactive side chains.
Carboxyl groups are normally protected as esters. Methyl and ethyl esters are pre￾pared by Fischer esterification and removed by hydrolysis in base. Benzyl esters are a 
popular choice because a synthetic peptide, protected at its N terminus with a Z group 
and at its C terminus as a benzyl ester, can be completely deprotected in a single operation 
by hydrogenolysis.

Protection of the α-carboxylic acid is not necessary for the most common method

25.15 Peptide Bond Formation
To form a peptide bond between two suitably protected amino acids, the free carboxyl 
group of one of them must be activated so that it is a reactive acylating agent. The most 
familiar acylating agents are acyl chlorides, and they were once extensively used to 
couple amino acids. Certain drawbacks to this approach, however, led chemists to seek 
alternative methods.
In one method, treatment of a solution containing the N-protected and the 
C-protected amino acids with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) leads directly to 
peptide bond formation:

The N,N′-dicyclohexylurea that is produced in peptide couplings with DCCI is 
soluble in the same solvents as the product, making it more difficult to separate the 
byproducts during purification. An alternative carbodiimide used in peptide synthesis is 
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, known as EDCI. Both EDCI and the 
urea that is produced from it are water-soluble and can be more easily separated from 
the peptide product. EDCI can also be used in organic solvents.

condensation approach). Human pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), for 
example, has 39 amino acids and was synthesized by coupling of smaller peptides 
containing residues 1–10, 11–16, 17–24, and 25–39. An attractive feature of this approach 
is that the various protected peptide fragments may be individually purified, which 
simplifies the purification of the final product. Among other substances that have been 
synthesized by fragment condensation are insulin (51 amino acids) and the protein ribo￾nuclease A (124 amino acids).
The reactions discussed show one problem with solution-phase synthesis. Byproducts 
of the reaction need to be separated from the product, and every separation step (liquid–
liquid extraction) will decrease the yield. Using segment condensation, the overall yield 
of the reaction is directly affected just by peptide-bond-forming steps. So, if just a few 
segments are joined together for the product, this approach can be efficient. If many 
peptide-bond-forming reactions are performed in a sequential manner, the overall yield 
will be decreased by each step. For example, a linear synthesis of the 39-amino-acid 
peptide ACTH requires 38 coupling reactions, each of which affects the overall yield. If 
each peptide-bond-forming reaction had a very good yield (say, 90%), the overall yield 
would be (0.9)38 × 100, or just 1.8%. As a result, another approach is needed for per￾forming sequential peptide synthesis! Fortunately, there is a method to do just that. It is 
described next in Section 25.16.
25.16 Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis: 
The Merrifield Method
In 1962, R. Bruce Merrifield of Rockefeller University reported the synthesis of the 
nonapeptide bradykinin by a novel method. In Merrifield’s method, peptide coupling 
and deprotection are carried out not in homogeneous solution but at the surface of an 
insoluble polymer, or solid support. Beads of a copolymer prepared from styrene con￾taining about 2% divinylbenzene are treated with chloromethyl methyl ether and tin(IV) 
chloride to give a resin in which about 10% of the aromatic rings bear CH2Cl groups 
(Figure 25.11). The growing peptide is anchored to this polymer, and excess reagents, 
impurities, and byproducts are removed by thorough washing after each operation. This 
greatly increases the yield of each coupling step (up to 99+%) and therefore the overall 
yield of the final peptide.
The actual process of solid-phase peptide synthesis, outlined in Figure 25.12, 
begins with the attachment of the C-terminal amino acid to the chloromethylated polymer 
in step 1. Nucleophilic substitution by the carboxylate anion of an N-Boc-protected 
Merrifield was awarded the 1984 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 
developing the solid-phase method 
of peptide synthesis.
Cl
Figure 25.11
A section of polystyrene showing one of the benzene rings modified by chloromethylation. Individual 
polystyrene chains in the resin used in solid-phase peptide synthesis are connected to one another at 
various points (cross-linked) by adding a small amount of p-divinylbenzene to the styrene monomer. The 
chloromethylation step is carried out under conditions such that only about 10% of the benzene rings 
bear CH2Cl groups.25.16 Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis: The Merrifield Method 1073
C-terminal amino acid displaces chloride from the chloromethyl group of the polymer 
to form an ester, protecting the C terminus while anchoring it to a solid support. Next, 
the Boc group is removed by treatment with acid (step 2), and the polymer containing 
the unmasked N terminus is washed with a series of organic solvents. Byproducts are 
removed, and only the polymer and its attached C-terminal amino acid residue remain. 
Next (step 3), a peptide bond to an N-Boc-protected amino acid is formed by condensa￾tion in the presence of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Again, the polymer is washed 
thoroughly. The Boc protecting group is then removed by acid treatment (step 4), and 
after washing, the polymer is now ready for the addition of another amino acid residue 
by a repetition of the cycle. When all the amino acids have been added, the synthetic 
peptide is removed from the polymeric support by treatment with hydrogen bromide in 
trifluoroacetic acid.
The Merrifield procedure has been 
adapted to accommodate Fmoc as 
well as Boc protecting groups.
Step 1: The Boc-protected amino acid is
anchored to the resin. Nucleophilic 
substitution of the benzylic chloride by
the carboxylate anion gives an ester.

By successively adding amino acid residues to the C-terminal amino acid, it took 
Merrifield only eight days to synthesize the nonapeptide bradykinin in 68% yield. The 
biological activity of synthetic bradykinin was identical with that of natural material.
Problem 25.21
Starting with phenylalanine and glycine, outline the steps in the preparation of Phe-Gly by 
the Merrifield method.
Merrifield successfully automated all the steps in solid-phase peptide synthesis, and 
computer-controlled equipment is commercially available to perform this synthesis. 
Using an early version of his “peptide synthesizer,” in collaboration with coworker Bernd 
Gutte, Merrifield reported the synthesis of the enzyme ribonuclease in 1969. It took them 
only six weeks to perform the 369 reactions and 11,391 steps necessary to assemble the 
sequence of 124 amino acids of ribonuclease.
Solid-phase peptide synthesis does not solve all purification problems, however. 
Even if every coupling step in the ribonuclease synthesis proceeded in 99% yield, the 
product would be contaminated with many different peptides containing 123 amino acids, 
122 amino acids, and so on. Thus, Merrifield and Gutte’s six weeks of synthesis was 
followed by four months spent in purifying the final product. About 12% of the expected 
mass was obtained after cleaving the protein from the resin. After the purification steps, 
the final yield was about 3%, which corresponds to a minimum 97% yield for each 
peptide-bond-forming step. The technique has since been refined to the point that yields 
at the 99% level and greater are achieved with current instrumentation, and thousands of 
peptides and peptide analogs have been prepared by the solid-phase method.
Merrifield’s concept of a solid-phase method for peptide synthesis and his develop￾ment of methods for carrying it out set the stage for an entirely new way to do chemical 
reactions. Solid-phase synthesis has been extended to include numerous other classes of 
compounds and has helped spawn a whole field called combinatorial chemistry.
Combinatorial synthesis allows a chemist, using solid-phase techniques, to prepare 
hundreds of related compounds (called libraries) at a time.
25.17 Secondary Structures of Peptides and Proteins
The primary structure of a peptide is its amino acid sequence. The secondary structure
is the conformational relationship of nearest-neighbor amino acids with respect to each 
other. On the basis of X-ray crystallographic studies and careful examination of molecular 
models, Linus Pauling and Robert B. Corey of the California Institute of Technology 
showed that certain peptide conformations were more stable than others. Two arrangements, 
the α helix and the β sheet, stand out as secondary structural units that are both particularly 
stable and commonly encountered. Both of these incorporate two important features:
1. The geometry of the peptide bond is planar and the main chain is arranged in an 
anti conformation (see Section 25.6).
2. Hydrogen bonding can occur when the NH group of one amino acid unit and 
the CO group of another are close in space; conformations that maximize the 
number of these hydrogen bonds are stabilized by them.
Chains in a β sheet exist in an extended conformation with hydrogen bonds between 
a carbonyl oxygen of one chain and an amide NH of another (Figure 25.13). Both the 
parallel and antiparallel arrangements of chains occur in proteins. Some of the space 
between peptide chains is occupied by the amino acid side chains, represented by R in 
Figure 25.13. Van der Waals repulsive forces involving these substituents cause the chains 
to rotate with respect to one another, giving a rippled effect known as a β-pleated sheet
(Figure 25.14).25.17 Secondary Structures of Peptides and Proteins 1075
The β-pleated sheet is an important secondary structure in proteins that are rich 
in amino acids with small side chains such as H (glycine), CH3 (alanine), and CH2OH 
(serine). The model in Figure 25.14 is a portion of the calculated structure for a sheet 
composed of antiparallel strands containing only glycine and alanine in alternating 
order (-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-, etc.). It was designed to resemble fibroin, the major protein 
of silk. Fibroin is almost entirely pleated sheet, and over 80% of it is a repeating 
sequence of the six-residue unit -Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-. Because the polypeptide 
backbone adopts an extended zigzag conformation, silk, unlike wool for example, 
resists stretching.
Problem 25.22
The methyl groups of the alanine residues of the β sheet in Figure 25.14 all point upward. If 
this pleated sheet were composed of only alanine residues instead of being Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala, 
etc., what would be the pattern of methyl groups? Would they all point up, alternate up and 
down, or be random?
The α helix is another commonly encountered secondary structure. Figure 25.15 
gives three views of an α-helix model constructed from eight l-alanine residues. Part a
of the figure is a ball-and-stick model; part b is a view through the center of the helix 
along its axis. The helix is right-handed with about 3.6 amino acids per turn and is 
stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygens and NH protons. View b
shows how the methyl groups of l-alanine project outward from the main chain. This 
outward orientation of amino acid side chains makes them the points of contact with 
other amino acids of the same chain, with different protein chains, and with other

biomolecules. Part c of the figure uses a ribbon to trace the peptide backbone. The ribbon 
helps distinguish front from back, makes the right-handedness of the helix more apparent, 
and is especially useful when looking at how proteins are folded.
The protein components of muscle (myosin) and wool (α-keratin) contain high 
percentages of α helix. When wool is stretched, hydrogen bonds break and the peptide 
chain is elongated. Covalent SS bonds between l-cysteine residues limit the extent to 
which the chain can be stretched, however, and once the stretching force is removed the 
hydrogen bonds re-form spontaneously.
Most proteins cannot be described in terms of a single secondary structure. Rather, 
most are mixtures of α helix and β sheet, interspersed with regions of random coils that 
have no regular pattern. Figure 25.16 shows a model of ribonuclease, an enzyme that

catalyzes the hydrolysis of RNA. The helical regions are shown in red, the β sheets in 
yellow. Of the 124 amino acids in this protein, 24 are represented in three sections of 
α helix. There are two β sheets, one with three strands accounting for 21 amino acids, 
the other with four strands and 20 amino acids. The strands of each β sheet belong to 
the same chain and are brought within hydrogen bonding distance because of how the 
chain is folded. Indeed, the formation of hydrogen bonds such as these is one of the 
factors that contributes to chain folding.
Another protein which has regions of α helix and β sheet is green fluorescent 
protein, or GFP. In GFP, the β-sheet structure is barrel-shaped, and the α helix runs along 
the center of the barrel, where it is shielded from the exterior (Figure 25.17). The α helix 
in GFP contains an arrangement of amino acids that undergoes fluorescence. Through 
the use of recombinant DNA technology, GFP can be attached to other proteins that are 
normally invisible, but now can be imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Using GFP 
as a biomarker, it is possible to monitor the roles of different proteins in the body, in 
part because GFP has very low toxicity toward living cells. The development of nerve 
cells in the brain, the spread of cancer cells, and the damage to neurons that occurs dur￾ing Alzheimer’s disease can be followed by techniques that use GFP.
25.18 Tertiary Structure of Polypeptides and Proteins
The way a protein chain is folded, its tertiary structure, affects both its physical prop￾erties and its biological function. The two main categories of protein tertiary structure 
are fibrous and globular.
1. Fibrous proteins are bundles of elongated filaments of protein chains and are 
insoluble in water.
2. Globular proteins are approximately spherical and either are soluble or form 
colloidal dispersions in water.
The primary structure of a protein, its amino acid sequence, is the main determinant of 
tertiary structure. Secondary structure also contributes by limiting the number of confor￾mations available to a polypeptide chain.
Fibrous proteins, being insoluble in water, often have a structural or protective 
function. The most familiar fibrous proteins are the keratins and collagen. α-Keratin 
(Figure 25.18) is based on the α-helix secondary structure and is the protein structural 
The 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, 
Martin Chalfie, and Roger Tsien for 
their work in the development of GFP.

(GFP) has an outer β-sheet structure

component of hair, wool, nails, claws, quills, horns, and the outer layer of skin. β-Keratin 
is based on the β-sheet secondary structure and occurs in silk as fibroin. l-Cysteine is 
especially abundant in keratins, where it can account for more than 20% of the amino 
acids present. Collagen occurs mainly in connective tissue (cartilage and tendons) and 
has a triple helix structure.
Globular proteins include most enzymes and function in aqueous environments. 
About 65% of the mass of most cells, for example, is water. When placed in water, 
nonpolar materials, including nonpolar amino acid side chains, cause nearby water mol￾ecules to adopt a more ordered arrangement, reducing the entropy of water. This is called 
the hydrophobic effect. The unfavorable negative ΔS is moderated if the protein adopts 
a spherical shape which places nonpolar side chains inside and polar ones on the surface. 
Of the various globular arrangements, the one that best offsets the entropy loss with 
attractive forces among the side chains is the tertiary structure adopted by the protein in 
its normal, or native, state.
Table 25.4 lists the attractive forces that most influence protein tertiary structure. 
The strongest of these is the covalent SS bond that unites two cysteine residues. This 
disulfide bridge can form between the CH2SH groups of two cysteines, which, 
although they may be remote from each other in respect to the amino acid sequence, 
become neighbors when the chain is folded. Formation of the disulfide bond connecting 
the two stabilizes the local folded arrangement. A typical globular protein normally has 
only a small number of disulfide bridges. Of the 124 amino acids in ribonuclease (see 
Figure 25.16 in Section 25.17), 6 are cysteines and each participates in a disulfide 
bridge; one bridge unites Cys-26 and Cys-84, another Cys-58 and Cys-110, and a third 
Cys-65 and Cys-72.
The noncovalent interactions are all much weaker than the SS covalent bond. 
Among them, the electrostatic attraction between positively and negatively charged side 
chains, called a salt bridge, is the strongest, followed by hydrogen bonding, then van der 
Waals forces. Keep in mind though, that the total contribution of the various forces 
depends not only on the magnitude of an interaction but also on their number. Disulfide 
bridges may be strong, but there are usually only a few of them. Van der Waals forces 
are weak, but they outnumber all the other intermolecular attractive forces.

25.19 Protein Quaternary Structure: Hemoglobin
Rather than existing as a single polypeptide chain, some proteins are assemblies of two or 
more chains. The manner in which these subunits are organized is called the quaternary 
structure of the protein.
Hemoglobin is an example of a protein that has quaternary structure. Hemoglobin 
is the oxygen-carrying protein of blood. It binds oxygen at the lungs and transports it to 
the muscles, where it is stored by myoglobin. Hemoglobin consists of four protein chains, 
including two identical chains called the alpha chains and two identical chains called 
the beta chains (Figure 25.19).
Each chain (subunit) contains a prosthetic group, heme. Prosthetic groups are 
nonprotein small molecules that bind tightly to a protein and are required for its func￾tion. Heme is an important prosthetic group in which iron(II) is coordinated with the 
four nitrogen atoms of a type of tetracyclic aromatic substance known as a porphyrin 
(Figure 25.20). Four of the six available coordination sites of Fe2+ are taken up by

the nitrogens of the porphyrin, one by a histidine residue of the protein, and the last 
by a water molecule. Hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs by formation of 
an FeO2 complex. The oxygen displaces water as the sixth ligand on iron and is 
held there until needed. The protein serves as a container for the heme and prevents 
oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, an oxidation state in which iron lacks the ability to bind 
oxygen. Separately, neither heme nor the protein binds oxygen in aqueous solution; 
together, they do it very well.
Some substances, such as CO, form strong bonds to the iron of heme, strong 
enough to displace O2 from it. Carbon monoxide binds hundreds of times better than 
oxygen to hemoglobin. Strong binding of CO at the active site interferes with the ability 
of heme to perform its biological task of transporting and storing oxygen, with poten￾tially lethal results.
How function depends on structure can be seen in the case of the genetic disorder 
sickle cell anemia. This is a debilitating, sometimes fatal, disease in which red blood 
cells become distorted (“sickle-shaped”) and interfere with the flow of blood through the 
capillaries. This condition results from the presence of an abnormal hemoglobin in 
affected people. The primary structures of the beta chain of normal and sickle cell hemo￾globin differ by a single amino acid out of 146; sickle cell hemoglobin has valine in 
place of glutamic acid as the sixth residue from the N terminus of the β chain. A tiny 
change in amino acid sequence can produce a life-threatening result! This modification 
is genetically controlled and probably became established in the gene pool because 
bearers of the trait have an increased resistance to malaria.

25.20 Enzymes
Knowing how the protein chain is folded is a key element in understanding how an 
enzyme catalyzes a reaction. Enzymes are essential to living systems, which depend on 
chemical reactions occurring at the right time and in the right location under conditions 
compatible with life. For mammals, this is generally near neutral pH and at moderate 
temperature. Protein folding often brings amino acids that are distant from each other in 
the linear sequence of the protein to precise locations within an enzyme active site, the 
area of the protein in which the catalytic reactions take place.
Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions in a number of ways, some of which are 
common to all enzymes. For example, all enzymatic reactions begin with a substrate 
binding to an active site. The energetically unfavorable loss of entropy occurs in this 
step rather than in the transition state of a catalytic step. This factor alone can account 
for a substantial increase in the rate of the chemical reaction. In addition, well-placed 
amino acids dictate the shape, charge, and conformation of substrate(s) that can enter 
the active site. Amino acid side chains can serve as proton donors or acceptors, 
nucleophiles, and electrophiles in the catalytic process. Prosthetic groups may be 
required for the catalytic reaction to take place, which are called cofactors when their 
presence is indispensable.
We saw in Section 25.9 that carboxypeptidase A catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 
peptide bond to the C-terminal amino acid of polypeptides. Carboxypeptidase A is a 
metalloprotein; it contains a Zn2+ ion as a cofactor, which is essential for catalytic activ￾ity. The X-ray crystal structure of carboxypeptidase A (Figure 25.21) locates this Zn2+
ion in a hydrophobic cavity near the center of the enzyme, where it is held by coor￾dination to a glutamic acid residue (Glu-72) and two histidines (His-69 and His-196). 
This region is the active site. The substrate in the case of carboxypeptidase A is a 
peptide, especially a peptide with a hydrophobic C-terminal amino acid such as phe￾nylalanine or tyrosine. In addition to being hydrophobic, as is the active site, the 
substrate is bound by an electrostatic attraction between its negatively charged car￾boxylate and the positively charged side chain of Arg-145. Mechanism 25.3 shows 
the interactions of the side chains of carboxypeptidase A with Zn2+ and a peptide, 
then describes the mechanism for cleaving the peptide bond to the terminal amino 
acid. Side chains other than those shown in Mechanism 25.3 have been implicated 
but have been omitted. The main feature of the mechanism is its relationship to the 
mechanism of nucleophilic acyl substitution (on which it was patterned). Not only 
does the enzyme bring the substrate and catalytically active functions together at the 
active site, but by stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate it lowers the activation 
energy for its formation and increases the reaction rate.

Mechanism 25.3
Carboxypeptidase-Catalyzed Hydrolysis
THE MECHANISM: The mechanism shown outlines the major stages in carboxypeptidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of a 
peptide in which the C-terminal amino acid is phenylalanine. Proton transfers accompany stages 2 and 3 but 
are not shown. Only the major interactions of the substrate with the carboxypeptidase side chains are shown 
although others may also be involved.
Stage 1: The peptide is positioned in the active site by an electrostatic bond between its negatively charged 
C-terminal carboxylate and a positively charged arginine side chain of the enzyme. Also at the active site, 
Zn2+ engages in Lewis acid/Lewis base interactions with His-69 and His-196 and an electrostatic attraction 
with the negatively charged carboxylate of Glu-72. These ligands are shown here but will be omitted in 
subsequent steps for simplicity.

25.21 Coenzymes in Reactions of Amino Acids
The number of chemical processes that protein side chains can engage in is rather lim￾ited. Most prominent among them are proton donation, proton abstraction, and nucleo￾philic addition to carbonyl groups. In many biological processes a richer variety of 
reactivity is required, and proteins often act in combination with substances other than 
proteins to carry out the necessary chemistry. These substances are called prosthetic 
groups or cofactors, and they can be organic or inorganic. Organic substances that 
are  required for catalytic activity are called coenzymes. The protein portion of the 
enzyme is called the apoenzyme, and the combination of the protein and cofactor is 
called the holoenzyme. In earlier sections we saw numerous examples of coenzyme￾catalyzed reactions that required the cofactor NAD+ for oxidation reactions and NADH 
for enzymatic reductions.
Enzymes with particular cofactors tend to catalyze similar transformations. Enzymes 
that contain pyridoxal pyrophosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin  B6, catalyze 
reactions that involve carbanionic intermediates. Amino acid metabolism and catabolism 
pathways frequently involve PLP-containing enzymes.
All PLP-containing enzymes contain an imine bond between the protein and the 
coenzyme in the resting state. The imine is the result of a chemical reaction between 
PLP and a lysine residue in the enzyme active site.

recent studies show that this nitrogen may be protonated in some enzymes but it is not 
in other enzymes.
Many bioactive amines arise by PLP-assisted decarboxylation. Decarboxylation of 
histidine, for example, gives histamine, a powerful vasodilator normally present in the 
body but formed in excessive amounts under conditions of anaphylactic shock.

Histamine is present in various tissues and produces different effects depending on 
the kind of receptor it binds to. Binding of histamine to H1 receptors in mast cells 
triggers, for example, the sneezing and watery eyes of hay fever and the itching of 
mosquito bites. The H2 receptors in the cells that line the stomach regulate the secretion 
of gastric acid. The present generation of antiallergy and antiulcer drugs bind to H1 and 
H2, respectively, and act by denying histamine access to these receptors.
Problem 25.24
One of the amino acids in Table 25.1 is the biological precursor to γ-aminobutyric acid 
(4-aminobutanoic acid), which it forms by a decarboxylation reaction. Which amino acid is this?
The chemistry of the brain and central nervous system is affected by a group of 
neurotransmitters, substances that carry messages across a synapse from one neuron to 
another. Several of these neurotransmitters arise from l-tyrosine by structural modifica￾tion and decarboxylation, as outlined in Figure 25.22.
Problem 25.25
Which of the transformations in Figure 25.22 is catalyzed by an amino acid decarboxylase?
Many of the drugs prescribed to treat anxiety, depression, or attention deficit dis￾order are “reuptake” inhibitors. They increase the concentration in the brain of a neces￾sary neurotransmitter such as dopamine or epinephrine by slowing the rate at which it 
is reabsorbed.
Mast cells reside in tissue rather than 
blood.

Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is also a coenzyme for the enzyme-catalyzed racemization 
of amino acids. The key reaction is proton abstraction from the α carbon of the amino 
acid imine of PLP. This step converts the α carbon, which is a chirality center, from sp3

Proton transfer to the imine carbon of the achiral intermediate gives equal amounts of 
both enantiomers of the PLP imine. The equation illustrates the racemization of l-alanine, 
which is catalyzed by the PLP-dependent enzyme alanine racemase. Because d-alanine 
is an essential component of bacterial cell walls, there is considerable interest in designing 
inhibitors of alanine racemase as potential antibacterial drugs.
In addition to amino acid decarboxylation and racemization, PLP is a coenzyme 
for transamination—the transfer of an amino group from one compound to another. The 
enzymes that catalyze transaminations are called aminotransferases or transaminases.
Many transaminations involve two compounds: α-ketoglutaric acid and l-glutamic acid—
one as a reactant, the other as its product.

As outlined in the first four stages of Mechanism 25.5, the amino group of l-glutamic 
acid is transferred to the coenzyme PLP to give pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). A 
second transamination, shown in abbreviated form as stage 5, is analogous to the first 
and gives l-alanine.
Problem 25.26
α-Ketoglutaric acid undergoes a transamination reaction with l-aspartic acid (see Table 25.1), 
converting it to a compound known as oxaloacetic acid. What is the structure of oxaloacetic 
acid?
Peptide-bond formation and transamination are the most general reactions of the 
standard amino acids, but individual amino acids often undergo reactions of more limited 
scope. One of the biosynthetic pathways to l-tyrosine is oxidation of l-phenylalanine.

THE MECHANISM:
Each stage can involve more than one elementary step, and each reaction is enzyme-catalyzed. Stages 1–4 show the 
transfer of the amino group of l-glutamic acid to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate to give α-ketoglutaric acid and pyridoxamine 
5′-phosphate (PMP). PMP reacts with pyruvic acid to give an imine, which then follows stages analogous to 1–4, but 
in reverse order, to give l-alanine and PLP. These stages are summarized as stage 5.
Stage 1: l-Glutamic acid forms an imine bond to the coenzyme PLP by reaction with the imine formed between PLP 
and the enzyme.

25.22 G-Protein-Coupled Receptors
Biological receptors have been mentioned a few times in this book, in the context of 
organic molecules that bind to them. In Section 24.2, we described anandamide, a lipid 
that binds to the same receptor in the brain as the cannabinoids. In Section 25.13, we 
mentioned calcitonin, a peptide that regulates blood calcium levels and is used in the 
treatment of osteoporosis. The biological receptors for anandamide and for calcitonin both 
belong to a very large class of protein receptors known as G-protein-coupled receptors,
or GPCRs. The “G” stands for guanine in “guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.” GPCRs 
occur throughout the body and function as “molecular switches” that regulate many physi￾ological processes.
The 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
was awarded to Robert J. Lefkowitz 
(Howard Hughes Medical Institute and 
Duke University) and Brian K. Kobilka 
(Stanford University) for their studies 
of G-protein-coupled receptors.

L-Citrulline Nitric oxide
Our experience conditions us to focus on the organic compo￾nents of the reaction—l-arginine and l-citrulline—and to give 
less attention to the inorganic one—nitric oxide (nitrogen mon￾oxide, NO). To do so, however, would lead us to overlook one of 
the most important discoveries in biology in the last quarter of 
the twentieth century.
Our story starts with the long-standing use of nitroglycerin 
to treat the chest pain that characterizes angina, a condition in 
diseases such as atherosclerosis in which restricted blood flow 
to the heart muscle itself causes it to receive an insufficient 
amount of oxygen. Placing a nitroglycerin tablet under the 
tongue provides rapid relief by expanding the blood vessels 
feeding the heart. A number of other nitrogen-containing com￾pounds such as amyl nitrite and sodium nitroprusside exert a 
similar effect.

A chemical basis for their action was proposed in 1977 by Ferid 
Murad, who showed that all were sources of NO, thereby impli￾cating it as the active agent.
Three years later, Robert F. Furchgott discovered that the 
relaxing of smooth muscles, such as blood vessel walls, was 
stimulated by an unknown substance produced in the lining of 
the blood vessels (the endothelium). He called this substance 
the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor, or EDRF and, in 
1986, showed that EDRF was NO. Louis J. Ignarro reached the 
same conclusion at about the same time. Further support was 
provided by Salvador Moncada, who showed that endothelial 
cells did indeed produce NO and that the l-arginine-to-l-citrulline 
conversion was responsible.
The initial skepticism that greeted the idea that NO, which 
is (a) a gas, (b) toxic, (c) inorganic, and (d) a free radical, could be 
a biochemical messenger was quickly overcome. An avalanche 
of results confirmed not only NO’s role in smooth-muscle relax￾ation, but added more and more examples to an ever-expanding 
list of NO-stimulated biochemical processes. Digestion is facili￾tated by the action of NO on intestinal muscles. The drug Viagra 
(sildenafil citrate), prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction, 
works by increasing the concentration of a hormone, the 
release of which is signaled by NO. A theory that NO is involved 
in long-term memory receives support from the fact the brain is 
a rich source of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which 
catalyzes the formation of NO from l-arginine. NO even medi￾ates the glow of fireflies. They glow nonstop when placed in a 
jar containing NO, but not at all when measures are taken to 
absorb NO.
Identifying NO as a signaling molecule in biological 
processes justified a Nobel Prize, but who would get it? 
Nobel Prizes are often shared, but never among more than 
three persons. Although four scientists—Murad, Furchgott, 
Ignarro, and Moncada—made important contributions, the 
Nobel committee followed tradition and recognized only the 
first three of them with the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine.
Oh NO! It’s Inorganic!GPCRs span the cell membrane (see Figure 24.4). When GPCRs bind their specific 
ligand, such as a lipid, peptide, or ion, they undergo a conformational change, which 
results in the transduction of a signal across the membrane. The details of how signaling 
occurs are not completely understood. The conformational change may result in an inter￾action with a nearby G protein, which in turn can activate enzymes or ion channels 
(Figure 25.23).
In the biochemistry of vision (see Section 18.11), the interaction of rhodopsin, a 
GPCR, with light results in the photo-induced isomerization of cis retinal imine to trans 
retinal imine. This causes conformational changes in rhodopsin, which ultimately result 
in the closing of an ion channel, polarization of the cell membrane, and a nerve impulse 
that is transmitted to the brain in vision.
G-protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases. It is estimated that 
nearly one half of prescription drugs target GPCRs, in the treatment of cancer, cardiac 
malfunction, inflammation, pain, and disorders of the central nervous system.
Signal transduction pathways in 
biochemistry involve a relay of 
molecular interactions that ultimately 
produce an intracellular response. 
These pathways can serve as a 
connection between events at the cell 
surface and gene expression in the 
nucleus.
GDP and GTP are abbreviations for 
the nucleotides guanosine

Signal transduction is initiated by the binding of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) to the ligand on the exterior of the cell. Interactions with a 
nearby G protein inside the cell result in the exchange of bound GDP to GTP and in the release of one of its subunits in a GTP-bound form that 
activates an ion channel or enzyme.
This chapter revolves around proteins. It describes the building blocks of proteins, progressing 
through amino acids and peptides, and concludes with proteins themselves.
Section 25.1 The 20 amino acids listed in Table 25.1 are the building blocks of proteins. All 
are α-amino acids.
Section 25.2 Except for glycine, which is achiral, all of the α-amino acids in Table 25.1 are 
chiral and have the l-configuration at the α carbon.
Section 25.3 The most stable structure of a neutral amino acid is a zwitterion. The pH of an 
aqueous solution at which the concentration of the zwitterion is a maximum is 
called the isoelectric point (pI).

Section 25.7 The primary structure of a peptide is its amino acid sequence plus any disulfide 
bonds between two cysteine residues. The primary structure is determined by a 
systematic approach in which the protein is cleaved to smaller fragments, even 
individual amino acids. The smaller fragments are sequenced and the main 
sequence deduced by finding regions of overlap among the smaller peptides.
Section 25.8 Complete hydrolysis of a peptide gives a mixture of amino acids. An amino acid 
analyzer identifies the individual amino acids and determines their molar ratios.
Section 25.9 Selective hydrolysis can be accomplished by using enzymes to catalyze cleavage 
at specific peptide bonds. Carboxypeptidase-catalyzed hydrolysis can be used to 
identify the C-terminal amino acid. The N terminus is determined by chemical 
means. One reagent used for this purpose is Sanger’s reagent, 1-fluoro-2,4-
dinitrobenzene.

similar to that used to sequence insulin, but are automated and can be carried 
out on a small scale. An example is repetitive N-terminal amino acid 
identification using the Edman degradation.
Section 25.12 Mass spectrometry is used for peptide sequencing and proteomics.
Section 25.13 Synthesis of a peptide of prescribed sequence requires the use of protecting 
groups to minimize the number of possible reactions.
Section 25.14 Amino-protecting groups include benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), tert-butoxycarbonyl
(Boc), and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).

Trifluoroacetic acid may be used to remove the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting 
group but not the benzyloxycarbonyl group. The benzyloxycarbonyl protecting 
group may then be removed using hydrogen bromide or by catalytic 
hydrogenolysis. Fmoc is removed in base.
Carboxyl groups are normally protected as benzyl, methyl, or ethyl esters. 
Hydrolysis in dilute base is normally used to deprotect methyl and ethyl esters. 
Benzyl protecting groups are removed by hydrogenolysis.
Section 25.15 Peptide bond formation between a protected amino acid having a free carboxyl 
group and a protected amino acid having a free amino group can be

Section 25.16 In the Merrifield method the carboxyl group of an amino acid is anchored to a 
solid support and the chain extended one amino acid at a time. When all the 
amino acid residues have been added, the polypeptide is removed from the 
solid support.
Section 25.17 Two secondary structures of proteins are particularly prominent. The pleated
β sheet is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between NH and CO groups of 
adjacent chains. The α helix is stabilized by hydrogen bonds within a single 
polypeptide chain.
Section 25.18 The folding of a peptide chain is its tertiary structure. The tertiary structure has 
a tremendous influence on the properties of the peptide and the biological role it 
plays. The tertiary structure is normally determined by X-ray crystallography.
Section 25.19 Many proteins consist of two or more chains, and the way in which the various 
units are assembled in the native state of the protein is called its quaternary 
structure.
Section 25.20 Many globular proteins are enzymes. They accelerate the rates of chemical 
reactions in biological systems, but the kinds of reactions that take place are 
the fundamental reactions of organic chemistry. One way in which enzymes 
accelerate these reactions is by bringing reactive functions together in the 
presence of catalytically active functions of the protein.
Section 25.21 Often the catalytically active functions of an enzyme are nothing more than 
proton donors and proton acceptors. In many cases a protein acts in cooperation 
with a cofactor, a small molecule having the proper functionality to carry out a 
chemical change not otherwise available to the protein itself. Pyridoxal 
5′-phosphate (PLP) is a common cofactor (coenzyme) that catalyzes reactions 
involving amino acids. 
Among the biochemical reactions of α-amino acids, several use PLP as a 
coenzyme. These reactions involve bonds to the α carbon and include 
transamination, decarboxylation, and racemization.
Section 25.22 G-protein-coupled receptors are transmembrane proteins that function as 
molecular switches in many physiological processes.

Amino Acids in Enantioselective Synthesis
Organic chemists speak of a “chiral pool,” which comprises those naturally occurring compounds 
that are readily available as a single enantiomer and capable of being used as starting materials 
for the enantioselective synthesis of other chiral molecules. Amino acids are well represented in 
the chiral pool. All except glycine have at least one chirality center and, although l-amino acids 
are more abundant and less expensive than their d-enantiomers, both are available.
Most of the standard amino acids have served as starting materials for enantioselective 
syntheses. One of the most widely used is l-glutamic acid and its lactam (S)-pyroglutamic acid, 
which is easily prepared by heating an aqueous solution of l-glutamic acid in a sealed container.

Nucleosides, Nucleotides, 
and Nucleic Acids
In Chapter 1 we saw that a major achievement of the first half 
of the twentieth century was the picture of atomic and molecu￾lar structure revealed by quantum mechanics. In this chapter we 
examine the major achievement of the second half of that 
century—a molecular view of genetics based on the structure 
and biochemistry of nucleic acids.
Nucleic acids are substances present in the nuclei of 
cells and were known long before anyone suspected they 
were the primary substances involved in the storage, trans￾mission, and processing of genetic information. There are 
two kinds of nucleic acids: ribonucleic acid (RNA) and 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Both are biopolymers based 
on three structural units: a carbohydrate, a phosphate ester 
linkage between carbohydrates, and a heterocyclic aromatic 
compound. The heterocyclic aromatic compounds are referred 
to as purine and pyrimidine bases. We’ll begin with them 
and follow the structural thread:
Purine and pyrimidine bases → Nucleosides → Nucleotides 
→ Nucleic acids
Gregor Mendel’s studies of the inherited traits of garden peas received 
little attention during his lifetime. What Mendel found is now recognized as 
the beginning of our understanding of genetics. Adenine, shown in the 
electrostatic potential map, is a “purine base” present in DNA and RNA.

H26.1 Pyrimidines and Purines 1103
There will be a few pauses along the way to examine some biochemical roles played by 
these compounds separate from their genetic one.
26.1 Pyrimidines and Purines
The two types of heterocycles found in DNA and RNA are pyrimidines and purines.
Pyrimidines are monocyclic aromatic compounds that contain two nitrogens in the ring. 
A purine is a bicyclic molecule in which an imidazole ring is fused to a pyrimidine ring. 
When derivatives of these molecules are part of DNA or RNA, they are referred to as 
nucleic acid bases.

The five nucleic acid bases of DNA and RNA are shown in Table 26.1. Adenine is a 
purine with an amine substituent at position 6. The structural resemblance between the 
parent molecule and the other four nucleic acid bases is not as obvious. Purines and 
pyrimidines with exocyclic heteroatom substituents can exist in different tautomeric 
forms. Uracil, for example, can exist in three tautomeric forms. The “keto” (lactam) form 
is the most stable tautomer, and it is the form found in RNA. Tautomerization forms an 
“enol” (lactim) form. The double lactim tautomer most clearly shows why uracil is clas￾sified as a pyrimidine.

Tautomers, which are constitutional

discussed in Sections 9.11 and 21.6.
6-Aminopurine is adenine and 
will appear numerous times in this 
chapter.1104 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
The tautomers of the familiar forms of the nucleic acid bases predominate under 
physiological conditions. This is fortunate, because tautomerization will change the 
hydrogen-bonding pattern of the base. For example, the lactim tautomer of thymine 
possesses the same pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors as cytosine 
(Figure 26.1).
In the early 1950s, Watson and Crick suggested the possibility that a rare tau￾tomer of a base could lead to spontaneous mutations in the genome. For example, if 
the lactim tautomer of thymine is present during replication, the newly synthesized 
DNA strand would possess guanine rather than adenine at the corresponding position. 
The presence of the “wrong” tautomer at the wrong time can also affect translation 
of DNA into protein. In fact, it is currently believed that base tautomerization is 
responsible for a portion of the naturally occurring miscoding errors observed 
in proteins.
Problem 26.1
Write a structural formula for the enol tautomer of cytosine (Table 26.1).

Problem 26.2
Classify caffeine and theobromine according to whether each is a pyrimidine or a purine. 
One of these cannot isomerize to an enolic form; two different enols are possible for the 
other. Explain and write structural formulas for the possible enols.
Several synthetic pyrimidines and purines are useful drugs. Acyclovir was the first 
effective antiviral compound and is used to treat herpes infections. 6-Mercaptopurine is 
one of the drugs used to treat childhood leukemia, which has become a very treatable 
form of cancer with a remission rate approaching 95%.

26.2 Nucleosides
The most important derivatives of pyrimidines and purines are nucleosides. Nucleosides
are glycosylamines in which a pyrimidine or purine nitrogen is bonded to the anomeric 
carbon of a carbohydrate. The nucleosides listed in Table 26.2 are the main building 
blocks of nucleic acids. In RNA the carbohydrate component is d-ribofuranose; in DNA 
it is 2-deoxy-d-ribofuranose.
The caffeine added to soft drinks is 
the caffeine that was removed when 
decaffeinating coffee and tea.
Acyclovir and 6-mercaptopurine are 
representative of the kind of drugs for 
which Gertrude B. Elion and George 
H. Hitchings of Burroughs Wellcome 
were awarded a share of the 1988 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

*Sometimes the abbreviation applies to the pyrimidine or purine base, sometimes to the nucleoside. Though this may seem confusing, it is normally clear from the context what is intended and causes no confusion in practice.26.3 Nucleotides 1107
Among the points to be made concerning Table 26.2 are the following:
1. Three of the bases (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) occur in both RNA and DNA.
2. Uracil occurs only in RNA; thymine occurs only in DNA.
3. The anomeric carbon of the carbohydrate is attached to N-1 in pyrimidine nucleo￾sides and to N-9 in purines.
4. The pyrimidine and purine bases are cis to the CH2OH group of the furanose 
ring (β stereochemistry).
5. Potential hydrogen-bonding groups (NH2 and CO) point away from the 
furanose ring.
The numbering scheme used for nucleosides maintains the independence of the two 
structural units. The pyrimidine or purine is numbered in the usual way. So is the carbohy￾drate, except that a prime symbol (′) follows each locant. Thus, adenosine is a nucleoside 
of d-ribose, and 2′-deoxyadenosine is a nucleoside of 2-deoxy-d-ribose.
Problem 26.3
The nucleoside cordycepin was isolated from cultures of the fungus Cordyceps militaris and 
found to be 3′-deoxyadenosine. Write its structural formula.
Table 26.2 doesn’t include all of the nucleoside components of nucleic acids. 
Nucleic acid bases in DNA and RNA can be covalently modified by enzymes that attach 
functional groups to pyrimidine and purine rings, most commonly methyl groups. 
Methylcytosine (5-mC) can make up to 4% of the cytosine in genomic DNA. Methylated 
DNA is one of the epigenomic modifications, which is a way that cells control gene 
activity without changing the DNA sequence. 
Although the term nucleoside was once limited to the compounds in Table 26.2 and 
a few others, current use is more permissive. Pyrimidine derivatives of d-arabinose, for 
example, occur in the free state in certain sponges and are called spongonucleosides. The 
powerful antiviral drug ribavirin, used to treat hepatitis C and Lassa fever, is a synthetic 
nucleoside analog in which the base, rather than being a pyrimidine or purine, is a triazole.

26.3 Nucleotides
Nucleotides are phosphoric acid esters of nucleosides. Those derived from adenosine, 
of which adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) is but one example, are especially prominent. 
AMP is a weak diprotic acid with pKa’s for ionization of 3.8 and 6.2, respectively. In 
aqueous solution at pH 7, both OH groups of the P(O)(OH)2 unit are ionized.

ATP is the main energy-storing molecule for practically every form of life on Earth. We 
often speak of ATP as a “high-energy compound” and its PO bonds as “high-energy 
bonds.” This topic is discussed in more detail in Sections 26.4 and 26.5.
The biological transformations that involve ATP are both numerous and fundamen￾tal. They include, for example, many reactions in which ATP transfers one of its phos￾phate units to the OH of another molecule. These phosphorylations are catalyzed by 
enzymes called kinases. An example is the first step in the metabolism of glucose:

Both adenosine and guanosine form cyclic monophosphates (cyclic-AMP or cAMP
and cyclic-GMP or cGMP, respectively) that are involved in a large number of biological 
processes as “second messengers.” Many hormones (the “first messengers”) act by stimu￾lating the formation of cAMP or cGMP on a cell surface, which triggers a series of events 
characteristic of the organism’s response to the hormone. Signalling by cAMP is also 
involved in the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (see Section 25.22).

As we saw in the boxed essay Oh NO! It’s Inorganic! in Section 25.21, nitric oxide (NO) 
expands blood vessels and increases blood flow. This process begins when NO stimulates 
the synthesis of cGMP as a second messenger. Erectile dysfunction drugs such as 
Earl Sutherland of Vanderbilt 
University won the 1971 Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine for uncovering 
the role of cAMP as a second 
messenger in connection with 
studies of the “fight or flight” hormone 
epinephrine (see Section 25.21).26.4 Bioenergetics 1109
sildenafil (Viagra) increase the concentration of cGMP by inhibiting the enzyme that 
catalyzes hydrolysis of its cyclic phosphate unit.
Problem 26.5
Cyclic-AMP is formed from ATP in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme adenylate cyclase.
Assume that adenylate cyclase acts as a base to remove a proton from the 3′-hydroxyl group 
of ATP and write a mechanism for the formation of cAMP.
26.4 Bioenergetics
Bioenergetics is the study of the thermodynamics of biological processes, especially 
those that are important in energy storage and transfer. Some of its conventions are 
slightly different from those we are accustomed to.
First, it is customary to focus on changes in free energy (ΔG) rather than changes 
in enthalpy (ΔH). It is instructive to review some of the thermodynamic relationships in 
chemical reactions that involve free energy. Consider the reaction
mA ⥫⥬ nB
K = [B]
n
____
[A]
m
Recall that the standard free-energy change (ΔG°) applies to a standard state at 
constant temperature (298 K) and pressure (1 atm), where initial [A] = initial [B] = 1 M. 
Reactions are classified as exergonic or endergonic according to the sign of ΔG°. An 
exergonic reaction is one in which ΔG° is negative, whereas an endergonic reaction has 
a positive value of ΔG°. The sign and magnitude of ΔG° describes the equilibrium 
constant for the process at standard state.
ΔG° = −RT ln K
But spontaneity under nonstandard state depends on the concentrations of reactants 
and products. If the ratio [B]n
/[A]m is less than a certain value, the reaction is spontane￾ous in the forward direction (ΔG < 0); if [B]n
/[A]m exceeds this value, the reaction is 
spontaneous in the reverse direction (ΔG < 0). Thus, ΔG tells us about the reaction with 
respect to the substances present and their concentrations. The criterion for spontaneity 
for a reaction under a given set of conditions is the value of ΔG, which is concentration 
dependent, not ΔG°.
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Bn ___
Am
An important consideration in bioenergetics is that these processes are performed 
in an aqueous environment in which water and hydronium ions may be both participants 
in the processes as well as components of the solutions. Standard state in biochemical 
reactions is additionally defined as occurring in dilute solutions at pH 7 ([H3O+
] = 10−7 M). 
The activities of water and hydronium ion are defined as 1, and these components do 
not occur in the equilibrium constant expression. So, for a biochemical reaction such as
A + H2O ⥫⥬ B + C + H+
The expression for the equilibrium constant, K′, is
K′ = [B][C]
______
[A] 
Standard free-energy change (ΔG°′) for a biological system at equilibrium is therefore
ΔG°′ = RT ln K′
Recall that free energy is the energy 
available to do work. By focusing on 
free energy, we concern ourselves 
more directly with what is important to 
a living organism.1110 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
To determine if the biochemical reaction is spontaneous under a set of conditions, the 
free-energy change for the reaction, ΔG′, is calculated.
ΔG′ = ΔG°′ + RT ln [B][C]
______
[A] 
This is an important concept for chemical reactions that occur in biochemical systems. 
Reactions that are not exergonic at the standard state can spontaneously occur if the 
reaction conditions are such that the sum of ΔG′ and ΔG°′ is < 0.
26.5 ATP and Bioenergetics
The key reaction in bioenergetics is the interconversion of ATP and ADP, usually 
expressed in terms of the hydrolysis of ATP.

As written, the reaction is exergonic at pH = 7. The reverse process—conversion of ADP 
to ATP—is endergonic. ATP is categorized as a “high-energy compound.” In biochem￾istry, these are molecules whose hydrolysis releases more than ∼25 kJ/mol (∼6 kcal/mol) 
at standard state. Such molecules are generally short lived in living systems, serving as 
vehicles for energy transfer rather than energy storage.
When coupled to some other process, the conversion of ATP to ADP can provide 
the free energy to transform an otherwise endergonic process to an exergonic one. Take, 
for example, the conversion of glutamic acid to glutamine at pH = 7.
Equation 1:
O O H2N
O
NH3
O
+ NH4 O
O
NH3
O
+ H2O
Glutamic acid Glutamine
Equation 1 has ΔG°′ = +14 kJ/mol (3.3 kcal/mol) and is endergonic. The main reason 
for this is that one of the very stable carboxylate groups of glutamic acid is converted 
to a less-stable amide function.
Nevertheless, the biosynthesis of glutamine proceeds from glutamic acid. The dif￾ference is that the endergonic process in Equation 1 is coupled with the strongly exergonic 
hydrolysis of ATP.
Equation 2:
O O H2N

Adding the value of ΔG°′ for the hydrolysis of ATP (−31 kJ/mol; −7.4 kcal/mol) to that 
of Equation 1 (+14 kJ/mol; 3.3 kcal/mol) gives ΔG°′ = −17 kJ/mol (−4.1 kcal/mol) for 
Equation 2. The biosynthesis of glutamine from glutamic acid is exergonic because it is 
coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP.
Problem 26.6
Verify that Equation 2 is obtained by adding Equation 1 to the equation for the hydrolysis of ATP.

“inorganic phosphate” and 
abbreviated Pi
.26.5 ATP and Bioenergetics 1111
There is an important qualification to the idea that ATP can serve as a free-energy 
source for otherwise endergonic processes. There must be some mechanism by which 
ATP reacts with one or more species along the reaction pathway. Simply being present 
and undergoing independent hydrolysis isn’t enough. The mechanism normally involves 
transfer of a phosphate unit from ATP to some nucleophilic site. In the case of glutamine 
synthesis, this step is phosphate transfer to glutamic acid to give γ-glutamyl phosphate 
as a reactive intermediate.

The γ-glutamyl phosphate formed in this step is a mixed anhydride of glutamic acid and

which you recognize as the reverse of the exergonic hydrolysis of ATP. The free energy 
to drive this endergonic reaction comes from the metabolism of energy sources such as 
fats and carbohydrates. In the metabolism of glucose during glycolysis, for example, 
about one third of the free energy produced is used to convert ADP to ATP. Glycolysis 
produces phosphoenolpyruvate, which provides sufficient energy for the conversion of 
ADP to ATP. Energy-rich compounds are compared in terms of ΔG°′ for their hydrolysis 
in Table 26.3.

As important as nucleotides of adenosine are to bioenergetics, that is not the only 
indispensable part they play in biology. The remainder of this chapter describes how 
these and related nucleotides are the key compounds in storing and expressing genetic 
information.1112 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
26.6 Phosphodiesters, Oligonucleotides, and Polynucleotides
Just as amino acids can join together to give dipeptides, tripeptides, and so on up to 
polypeptides and proteins, so too can nucleotides join to form larger molecules. Analo￾gous to the “peptide bond” that connects two amino acids, a phosphodiester joins two 
nucleosides. Figure 26.2 shows the structure and highlights the two phosphodiester units 
of a trinucleotide of 2′-deoxy-d-ribose in which the bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), 
and guanine (G). Phosphodiester units connect the 3′-oxygen of one nucleoside to the 
5′-oxygen of the next. Nucleotide sequences are written with the free 5′ end at the left 
and the free 3′ end at the right. Thus, the trinucleotide sequence shown in Figure 26.2 
is written as ATG.

3′-OH group at the other end.26.7 Phosphoric Acid Esters 1113
The same kind of 5′→3′ phosphodiester units that join the 2′-deoxy-d-ribose units 
in Figure 26.2 are also responsible for connecting nucleosides of d-ribose.
Problem 26.9
How would the structures of the trinucleotides AUG and GUA in which all of the pentoses 
are d-ribose differ from the trinucleotide in Figure 26.2?
Adding nucleotides to the 3′-oxygen of an existing structure is called elongation
and leads ultimately to a polynucleotide. The most important polynucleotides are 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). As we shall see in later 
sections, the polynucleotide chains of DNA and some RNAs are quite long and contain 
hundreds of thousands of bases.
Polynucleotides of modest chain length, say 50 or fewer, are called oligonucleotides.
Their synthesis is modeled after the Merrifield solid-phase method and, like it, is auto￾mated. The synthesis of a typical oligonucleotide containing 20–50 bases can be readily 
accomplished in an academic lab. Longer sequences of polynucleotides (up to about 2000 
base pairs) can be obtained from many commercial vendors.
26.7 Phosphoric Acid Esters
Phosphate groups are ubiquitous in living systems. In addition to serving as a source of 
energy, phosphoric acid derivatives are involved in signal transduction, regulation of 
protein function, and, as described in Section 26.6, they connect the nucleosides in the 
nucleic acid polymers as phosphate esters. The chemical properties of the phosphate 
esters in DNA and RNA reflect their role in the cell.
Phosphoric acid possesses three ionizable groups. The first pKa of the parent acid is 
2.15, which makes phosphoric acid about 450 times stronger than acetic acid (pKa = 4.8). 
The second ionization occurs near neutral pH (pKa 7.2). The closeness of this pKa to 
physiological pH (7.4) is one reason why phosphate buffers are very common in 
biochemical research laboratories.

Phosphoric acid esters can exist in three different forms: phosphotriester, phospho￾diester, or phosphate monoester. Phosphotriesters are not found in living systems, while 
phosphodiesters and phosphate monoesters are very common. Phosphotriesters are readily 
hydrolyzed to phosphodiesters.

In contrast, alkyl phosphodiesters are very stable toward hydrolysis. In fact, after 
16 days at 100°C, only about half of an alkyl diester is hydrolyzed to its monoester. The 
phosphate is less electrophilic in the diester anion, and the negative charge on the 
phosphodiester repulses the incoming hydroxide ion.

The chemical stability of phosphodiesters is reflected in the stability of DNA. Prolonged 
heating in strong aqueous base does not hydrolyze the DNA phosphodiester bonds.

From an evolutionary point of view, high chemical stability of the genetic material 
is desirable. The fidelity of the genetic code relies on maintaining the correct sequence 
of the nucleic acid bases. DNA may be cleaved enzymatically, and therefore the location 
and timing of strand breaking can be controlled. DNA strands are so stable that DNA from 
ancient animals, plants, and humanoids more than 200,000 years old can be sequenced.
In contrast, RNA tends to serve transient roles in a cell. Chemically, it is highly 
susceptible to hydrolysis. Contaminating RNA can be eliminated from DNA samples by 
short treatment with aqueous base.
RNA

The key structural difference in the two polymers is the 2′ hydroxyl group on the 
ribofuranose of the nucleotide. The hydroxyl group affects the hydrolysis reaction by 
anchimeric assistance, which is defined as a rate increase due to neighboring group 
participation in a chemical reaction (Figure 26.3). The 2′-alcohol serves as an intramo￾lecular nucleophile, which attacks the adjacent phosphate and forms a new phosphate–
oxygen bond. During the process, the bond between the phosphate and the 5′-alcohol in 
the next ribonucleotide is cleaved and the RNA strand is broken.
The presence of the cyclic intermediate is suggested by the formation of 
2′-phosphoesters in addition to the expected 3′-phosphoester. Release of ring strain of 
the cyclic phosphodiester (∼19 kJ/mol; 4.6 kcal/mol) can also contribute to the increased 
hydrolysis rate for RNA.

26.8 Deoxyribonucleic Acids
The nineteenth century saw three things happen that, taken together, prepared the way for 
our present understanding of genetics. In 1854, an Augustinian monk named Gregor Mendel 
began growing peas and soon discovered some fundamental relationships about their 
inherited characteristics. Mendel discovered two laws of heredity: segregation and indepen￾dent assortment. The work demonstrated the existence of paired elementary units of hered￾ity, and revealed statistical relationships that govern their expression. Mendel described 
these at a scientific meeting in 1865 and sent copies of a paper describing the work to a 
number of prominent scientists. At about the same time (1859), Charles Darwin published 
the book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. Mendel’s work was 
ignored until it was rediscovered in 1900; Darwin’s was widely known and vigorously 
debated. The third event occurred in 1869 when Johann Miescher isolated a material, 
calling it nuclein, from the nuclei of white blood cells harvested from the pus of surgical 
bandages. Miescher’s nuclein contained both a protein and an acidic, phosphorus-rich sub￾stance that, when eventually separated from the protein, was given the name nucleic acid.
After 1900, genetic research—but not research on nucleic acids—blossomed. Nucleic 
acids were difficult to work with, hard to purify, and, even though they were present in 
all cells, did not seem to be very interesting. Early analyses, later shown to be incorrect, 
were interpreted to mean that nucleic acids were polymers consisting of repeats of some 
sequence of adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 
Nucleic acids didn’t seem to offer a rich enough alphabet from which to build a genetic 
dictionary. Most workers in the field believed proteins to be better candidates.
More attention began to be paid to nucleic acids in 1945 when Oswald Avery of 
the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research found that a nonvirulent strain of a bac￾terium (Streptococcus pneumoniae) produced virulent offspring after incubation with a 
substance isolated from a virulent strain. What was especially important was that this 
virulence was passed on to succeeding generations and could only result from a perma￾nent change in the genetic makeup—what we now call the genome—of the bacterium. 
Avery established that the substance responsible was DNA and in a letter speculated that 
it “may be a gene.”
Avery’s paper prompted other biochemists to rethink their ideas about DNA. One 
of them, Erwin Chargaff of Columbia University, soon discovered that the distribution 
of adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine differed from species to species, but was the 
same within a species and within all the cells of a species. Perhaps DNA did have the 
capacity to carry genetic information after all. Chargaff also found that regardless of the 
source of the DNA, half the bases were purines and the other half were pyrimidines. 
Significantly, the ratio of the purine adenine (A) to the pyrimidine thymine (T) was 
always close to 1:1. Likewise, the ratio of the purine guanine (G) to the pyrimidine 
cytosine (C) was also close to 1:1. For human DNA the values are:
Purine Pyrimidine Base ratio
Adenine (A) 30.3% Thymine (T) 30.3% A/T = 1.00
Guanine (G) 19.5% Cytosine (C) 19.9% G/C = 0.98
Total purines 49.8% Total pyrimidines 50.2%

Estimate the guanine content in turtle DNA if adenine = 28.7% and cytosine = 21.3%.

Villanova University1116 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
Our text began with an application of physics to chemistry 
when we described the electronic structure of atoms. We 
saw then that Erwin Schrödinger’s introduction of wave mechan￾ics figured prominently in developing the theories that form the 
basis for our present understanding. As we near the end of our 
text, we see applications of chemistry to areas of biology that 
are fundamental to life itself. Remarkably, Schrödinger appears 
again, albeit less directly. His 1944 book What Is Life? made the 
case for studying genes, their structure, and function.
Schrödinger’s book inspired a number of physicists to 
change fields and undertake research in biology from a physics 
perspective. One of these was Francis Crick who, after earning 
an undergraduate degree in physics from University College, 
London, and while employed in defense work for the British 
government, decided that the most interesting scientific ques￾tions belonged to biology. Crick entered Cambridge University 
in 1949 as a 30-year-old graduate student, eventually settling on 
a research problem involving X-ray crystallography of proteins.
One year later, 22-year-old James Watson completed 
Ph.D. studies on bacterial viruses at Indiana University and 
began postdoctoral research in biochemistry in Copenhagen. 
After a year at Copenhagen, Watson decided Cambridge was 
the place to be.
Thus it was that the paths of James Watson and Francis 
Crick crossed in the fall of 1951. One was a physicist, the other a 
biologist. Both were ambitious in the sense of wanting to do 
great things and shared a belief that the chemical structure of 
DNA was the most important scientific question of the time. At 
first, Watson and Crick talked about DNA in their spare time 
because each was working on another project. Soon, however, 
it became their major effort. Their sense of urgency grew when 
they learned that Linus Pauling, fresh from his proposal of helical 
protein structures, had turned his attention to DNA. Indeed, Wat￾son and Crick were using the Pauling approach to structure—
take what is known about the structure of small molecules, 
couple it to structural information about larger ones, and build 
molecular models consistent with the data.
At the same time, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at 
King’s College, Cambridge, were beginning to obtain high￾quality X-ray crystallographic data of DNA. Some of their results 
were presented in a seminar at King’s attended by Watson, and 
even more were disclosed in a progress report to the Medical 
Research Council of the U.K. Armed with Chargaff’s A = T and 
G = C relationships and Franklin’s X-ray data, Watson and Crick 
began their model building. A key moment came when Jerry 
Donohue, a postdoctoral colleague from the United States, 
noticed that they were using the wrong structures for the pyrimi￾dine and purine bases. Watson and Crick were using models of 
the enol forms of thymine, cytosine, and guanine, rather than the 
correct keto forms (recall Section 26.1). Once they fixed this 
error, the now-familiar model shown in Figure 26.4 emerged 
fairly quickly and they had the structure of DNA.
Watson and Crick published their work in a paper entitled 
“A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid” in the British journal 
Nature on April 25, 1953. In addition to being one of the most 
important papers of the twentieth century, it is also remembered 
for one brief sentence appearing near the end.
“It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing 
we have postulated immediately suggests a possible 
copying mechanism for the genetic material.”
True to their word, Watson and Crick followed up their 
April 25 paper with another on May 30. This second paper, 
“Genetical Implications of the Structure of Deoxyribonucleic 
Acid,” outlines a mechanism for DNA replication that is still 
accepted as essentially correct.
“It Has Not Escaped Our Notice . . .”

Avery’s studies shed light on the function of DNA. Chargaff’s touched on structure
in that knowing the distribution of A, T, G, and C in DNA is analogous to knowing the 
amino acid composition of a protein, but not its sequence or three-dimensional shape.
The breakthrough came in 1953 when James D. Watson and Francis H. C. Crick 
proposed a structure for DNA. The Watson–Crick proposal ranks as one of the most 
important in all of science and has spurred a revolution in our understanding of genetics. 
The structure of DNA is detailed next in Section 26.9. The boxed essay “It Has Not 
Escaped Our Notice . . .” describes how it came about.26.9 Secondary Structure of DNA: The Double Helix 1117
26.9 Secondary Structure of DNA: The Double Helix
Watson and Crick relied on molecular modeling to guide their thinking about the structure 
of DNA. Because X-ray crystallographic evidence suggested that DNA was composed of 
two polynucleotide chains running in opposite directions, they focused on the forces holding 
the two chains together. Hydrogen bonding between bases seemed the most likely candidate. 
After exploring a number of possibilities, Watson and Crick proposed the arrangement 
shown in Figure 26.5 in which adenine and thymine comprise one complementary base pair
and guanine and cytosine another. This base-pairing scheme has several desirable features.
1. Pairing A with T and G with C gives the proper Chargaff ratios (A = T and G = C).
2. Each pair contains one purine and one pyrimidine base. This makes the A---T and 
G---C pairs approximately the same size and ensures a consistent distance between 
the two DNA strands.
3. Complementarity between A and T, and G and C suggests a mechanism for copying 
DNA. This is called replication and is discussed in Section 26.10.
Figure 26.6 supplements Figure 26.5 by showing portions of two DNA strands 
arranged side by side with the base pairs in the middle.
Hydrogen bonding between complementary bases is responsible for association between 
the strands, whereas conformational features of its carbohydrate–phosphate backbone and the 
orientation of the bases with respect to the furanose rings govern the overall shape of each 
strand. Using the X-ray crystallographic data available to them, Watson and Crick built a 
molecular model in which each strand took the shape of a right-handed helix. Joining two 
antiparallel strands by appropriate hydrogen bonds produced the double helix shown in the 
photograph (Figure 26.4). Figure 26.7 shows two modern renderings of DNA models.
In addition to hydrogen bonding between the two polynucleotide chains, the double￾helical arrangement is stabilized by having its negatively charged phosphate groups on the 
outside where they are in contact with water and various cations, Na+, Mg2+, and ammo￾nium ions, for example. Attractive van der Waals forces between the aromatic pyrimidine 
Watson and Crick shared the 1962 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
with Maurice Wilkins who, with 
Rosalind Franklin, was responsible for 
the X-ray crystallographic work.

and purine rings, called π-stacking, stabilize the layered arrangement of the bases on the 
inside. Even though the bases are on the inside, they are accessible to other substances 
through two grooves that run along the axis of the double helix. They are more accessible 
via the major groove, which is almost twice as wide as the minor groove. The grooves 
differ in size because of the way the bases are tilted with respect to the furanose ring.
The structure proposed by Watson and Crick was modeled to fit crystallographic 
data obtained by Franklin on a sample of the most common form of DNA called B-DNA. 
Other forms include A-DNA, which is similar to, but more compact than B-DNA, and 
Z-DNA, which is a left-handed double helix.
By analogy to the levels of structure of proteins, the primary structure of DNA 
is the sequence of bases along the polynucleotide chain, and the A-DNA, B-DNA, and 
Z-DNA helices are varieties of secondary structures.
Not all DNAs are double helices (duplex DNA). Some types of viral DNA are 
single-stranded, and even a few triple and quadruple DNA helices are known.
26.10 Replication of DNA
Every time a cell divides, its DNA is duplicated so that the DNA in the new cell is 
identical to that in the original one. As Figure 26.8 shows, Watson–Crick base-pairing 
provides the key to understanding this process of DNA replication. During cell division 
A helical structure for DNA strands 
had been suggested in 1949 by Sven 
Furberg in his Ph.D. dissertation at the 
University of London.

the DNA double helix begins to unwind, generating a replication fork separating the 
two strands. Each strand serves as a template on which a new DNA strand is constructed. 
The AT, GC base-pairing requirement ensures that each new strand is the precise 
complement of its template strand. Each of the two new duplex DNA molecules contains 
one original and one new strand.

1. The DNA to be copied is a double helix, shown 
here as flat for clarity.
2. The two strands begin to unwind. Each strand 
will become a template for construction of its 
complement.
3. As the strands unwind, the pyrimidine and 
purine bases become exposed. Notice that the 
bases are exposed in the 3′ → 5′ direction in 
one strand, and in the 5′ → 3′ direction in the 
other.
4. Two new strands form as nucleotides that are 
complementary to those of the original strands 
are joined by phosphodiester linkages. The 
sources of the new bases are dATP, dGTP, 
dCTP, and dTTP already present in the cell.
5. Because nucleotides are added in the 5′ → 3′ 
direction, the processes by which the two new 
chains grow are different. Chain growth can be 
continuous in the leading strand, but not in the 
lagging strand.
6. Two duplex DNA molecules result, each of 
which is identical to the original DNA.
Figure 26.8
Outline of DNA replication. The original strands are shown in red and blue and are the templates from which the new strands, shown in black, are copied.1120 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
Both new chains grow in their 5′ → 3′ direction. Because of this, one grows toward 
the replication fork (the leading strand) and the other away from it (the lagging strand), 
making the details of chain extension somewhat different for the two. The fundamental 
chemistry, however, is straightforward (Figure 26.9). The hydroxyl group at the 3′ end 
of the growing polynucleotide chain acts as a nucleophile, attacking the 5′-triphosphate 
of 2′-deoxyadenosine, 2′-deoxyguanosine, 2′-deoxycytidine, or thymidine to form the new 
phosphodiester linkage. The enzyme that catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation is 
called DNA polymerase; different DNA polymerases operate on the leading strand and 
the lagging strand.
All of the steps, from the unwinding of the original DNA double helix to the 
supercoiling of the new DNAs, are catalyzed by enzymes.
Genes are DNA and carry the inheritable characteristics of an organism and these 
characteristics are normally expressed at the molecular level via protein synthesis. Gene 
expression consists of two stages, transcription and translation, both of which involve 
RNAs. Sections 26.11 and 26.12 describe these RNAs and their roles in transcription 
and translation.
26.11 Ribonucleic Acids
The flow of genetic information in an organism starts with DNA, which contains the code 
for reproducing itself and for the proteins that are required for the life form to function.

the cytoplasm, in which the information from DNA is “transferred” (translated) into the 
RNA sequence, which passes out of the nucleus and is then “read” (transcribed) in the 
cytosol into the ultimate product, the protein.
The “central dogma” of molecular biology, expressed originally by Francis Crick, 
is that the flow of genetic information terminates in the protein. That is, DNA and RNA 
can both send and receive genetic information. Proteins can only receive genetic informa￾tion; they cannot replicate or transfer genetic instructions back to nucleic acid polymers. 
Since that time scientists have discovered that DNA and RNA play more complicated 
roles than originally envisioned, but the central dogma still holds.
The cellular roles of RNA were originally thought to be restricted to its three major 
forms, all of which are involved in the direct transfer of genetic information from DNA 
to protein. These three forms are:
1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA)
3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
Messenger RNA (mRNA): Messenger RNA is synthesized in the cell nucleus during 
the process of transcription, which is illustrated in Figure 26.10. Transcription resem￾bles DNA replication in that a DNA strand serves as the template for construction of, 
in this case, a ribonucleic acid. mRNA synthesis begins at its 5′ end, and ribonucleo￾tides complementary to the DNA strand being copied are added. The phosphodiester 
linkages are formed by reaction of the free 3′-OH group of the growing mRNA with 
ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP (recall that uracil, not thymine, is the complement of adenine 
in RNA). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is RNA polymerase. Only a small 
section of about 10 base pairs of the DNA template is exposed at a time. As the 
synthesis zone moves down the DNA chain, restoration of hydrogen bonds between 
the two original DNA strands displaces the newly synthesized single-stranded mRNA. 
The entire DNA molecule is not transcribed as a single mRNA. Transcription begins 
at a prescribed sequence of bases (the promoter sequence) and ends at a termination 
sequence. Thus, one DNA molecule can give rise to many different mRNAs and code 
for many different proteins. There are thousands of mRNAs and they vary in length 
from about 500 to 6000 nucleotides.
The genetic code (Figure 26.11) is the message carried by mRNA. It is made up of 
triplets of adjacent nucleotide bases called codons. Because mRNA has only four different 
bases and 20 amino acids must be coded for, codes using either one or two nucleotides per 
promoter sequence

During transcription a molecule of mRNA is assembled from a DNA template. Transcription begins at a promoter sequence and proceeds in the 5′→3′
direction of the mRNA until a termination sequence of the DNA is reached. Only a region of about 10 base pairs is unwound at any time.1122 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
amino acid are inadequate. If nucleotides are read in sets of three, however, the four mRNA 
bases generate 64 possible “words,” more than sufficient to code for 20 amino acids.
In addition to codons for amino acids, there are start and stop codons. Protein 
biosynthesis begins at a start codon and ends at a stop codon of mRNA. The start codon 
is the nucleotide triplet AUG, which is also the codon for methionine. The stop codons 
are UAA, UAG, and UGA. UAG and UGA can also code for pyrrolysine and selenocys￾teine, respectively. How these two “ambiguous” codons are read depends on the presence 
of specific genes.
Problem 26.12
Write the sequence of the peptide that is coded for by the DNA sequence 
TACGAAGGACTAAGAATC.
Transfer RNA (tRNA): Transfer RNAs are relatively small nucleic acids, containing 
only about 70 nucleotides. They get their name because they transfer amino acids to the 
ribosome for incorporation into a polypeptide. Although 20 amino acids need to be trans￾ferred, there are 50–60 tRNAs, some of which transfer the same amino acids. Figure 26.12 
shows the structure of phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAPhe). Like all tRNAs it is composed of 
a single strand, with a characteristic shape that results from the presence of paired bases 
in some regions and their absence in others.
Among the 76 nucleotides of tRNAPhe are two sets of three that are especially 
important. The first is a group of three bases called the anticodon, which is comple￾mentary to the mRNA codon for the amino acid being transferred. Figure 26.11 shows 
two mRNA codons for phenylalanine, UUU and UUC (reading in the 5′→3′ direction). 
Because base-pairing requires the mRNA and tRNA to be antiparallel, the two anticodons 
are read in the 3′→5′ direction as AAA and AAG.
3′ A A G 5′ tRNA anticodon
5′ U U C 3′ mRNA codon
The other important sequence is the CCA triplet at the 3′ end. The amino acid that 
is to be transferred is attached through an ester linkage to the terminal 3′-oxygen of this 
sequence. All tRNAs have a CCA sequence at their 3′ end.
The 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine was shared by Robert W. 
Holley of Cornell University for 
determining the nucleotide sequence 
of phenylalanine transfer RNA.

The codon wheel can be used to decode 
a messenger RNA sequence to a peptide 
sequence. Starting at the 5′-end of the 
gene, the first position in the codon is 
found in the center circle. The second 
and third positions are read from the 
next two concentric circles. For example, 
the codon for methionine is AUG. Most 
of the codons are redundant, meaning 
that an individual amino acid is 
designated by more than one codon.26.11 Ribonucleic Acids 1123
Transfer RNAs normally contain some bases other than A, U, G, and C. Of the 76 
bases in tRNAPhe, for example, 13 are of the modified variety. One of these, marked G* 
in Figure 26.12a, is a modified guanosine in the anticodon. Many of the modified bases, 
including G*, are methylated derivatives of the customary RNA bases.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): Ribosomes, which are about two-thirds nucleic acid and 
about one-third protein, constitute about 90% of a cell’s RNA. A ribosome is made up 
of two subunits, referred to as the 60S and 40S subunits in eukaryotes. The larger 60S 
subunit contains 57 proteins and three strands of RNA: 28S (3354 nucleotides), 5S 
(120 nucleotides), and 5.8S (154 nucleotides). The smaller 40S subunit contains 32 
proteins and one RNA polymer (18S, 1753 nucleotides). The ribosome is where the 
message carried by the mRNA is translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein. 
How it occurs is described in Section 26.12.
An indication of the potential versatility of RNA was the discovery that RNA 
itself can possess catalytic activity. Until that time, the known catalytic reactions in 
living systems were performed solely by proteins. In 1982, Thomas Cech and cowork￾ers reported that a strand of RNA from Tetrahymena thermophila was capable of 
breaking and reforming its own phosphodiester bond in the absence of protein. Con￾temporarily, Sidney Altman of Yale University discovered that the RNA portion of 
the enzyme RNAse P was sufficient to perform the ribonucleoprotein’s catalytic activity 
in the absence of protein. We now know that RNA catalysts, called ribozymes, are 
found in all kingdoms. One of the functions of RNA in the ribosome is catalytic: 
an adenine from RNA in the 60S subunit catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds 
(Figure 26.13).
For their studies on the structure and 
mode of action of ribosomes, 
Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (Medical 
Research Council, U.K.), Thomas Steitz 
(Yale University, U.S.), and Ada Yonath 
(Weizmann Institute, Israel) were 
awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry.
Sidney Altman (Yale University) and 
Thomas Cech (University of Colorado) 
shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for showing that RNAs 
could function as biological catalysts.

Other Types and Functions of RNA: An important new activity of intracellular RNA 
emerged from what appeared to be a failed experiment. In the mid 1980s, Richard 
Jorgensen, a plant scientist at a biotech startup company, was attempting to create a 
deeper purple color in a petunia. Jorgensen reasoned that adding an extra gene for the 
color would produce the dark color. Surprisingly, the genetically modified petunias were 
white instead of purple. Instead of enhancing the color, the second gene “silenced” the 
plant’s original gene. Other research groups observed similar phenomena after introduc￾ing sense or antisense RNA into an organism. Observations such as these were explained 
in 1998. Craig Mello of University of Massachusetts Medical School and Andrew Fire 
of Stanford University reported that injecting double-stranded RNA into a worm silenced 
genes complementary to the RNA. It is now known that RNA interference (RNAi) is a 
naturally occurring phenomenon for controlling gene expression, and Mello and Fire 
were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.
We now know that RNA plays many more roles in eukaryotic cells than simply 
serving protein biosynthesis. New discoveries of RNA structures and functions are 
occurring at a rapid pace. MicroRNA (miRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and 
small interfering RNA (siRNA) are known to be involved in gene regulation in most 
eukaryotes. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has a wide range of functions, many of 
which are not yet understood. Our increased understanding of RNA functions has led 
to a new class of therapeutics. Some RNA therapeutics are FDA approved and many 
more are in advanced clinical trials. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which can 
be either DNA- or RNA-based, are short, single-stranded oligonucleotides that increase 
or decrease expression of a target protein. RNAi therapeutics are short, double￾stranded oligonucleotides that target and degrade mRNAs, effectively silencing the 
corresponding gene. mRNA therapeutics are designed to elicit expression of a peptide 
or protein in the cytoplasm. The most prominent example is the COVID-19 vaccine, 
discussed in the boxed essay mRNA Therapeutics.
The terms sense and antisense refer 
to the orientation of DNA or RNA 
strands with respect to transcription 
or translation. In RNA, the sense 
strand is the template for translation, 
so antisense RNA has a sequence 
complementary to sense RNA. The 
two can anneal to form double￾stranded RNA.

Translation of mRNA into an amino acid sequence of a protein involves three types of RNA as well as 
multiple proteins. (a) The ribosome brings together the mRNA and the complementary tRNAs and 
catalyzes the peptide-bond-forming reaction. (b) The growing peptide chain is attached to the tRNA in 
the P (peptidyl) site. The next amino acid in the polypeptide is attached to a tRNA in the A (aminoacyl) 
site. Formation of the peptide bond involves a catalytic adenine from rRNA. The process converts an 
ester to an amide.26.12 Protein Biosynthesis 1125
26.12 Protein Biosynthesis
As described in the preceding sections, protein synthesis involves transcription of the 
DNA to mRNA, followed by translation of the mRNA as an amino acid sequence. In 
addition to outlining the mechanics of transcription, we have described the relationship 
among mRNA codons, tRNA anticodons, and amino acids.
During translation the protein is synthesized beginning at its N terminus (Figure 26.13). 
The mRNA is read in its 5′→3′ direction beginning at the start codon AUG and ending 
at a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). Because the start codon is always AUG, the 
N-terminal amino acid is always methionine (as its N-formyl derivative). However, this 
N-formylmethionine residue is normally lost in a subsequent process and the N terminus 
of the expressed protein is therefore determined by the second mRNA codon. The portion 
of the mRNA between the start and stop codons is called the coding sequence and is 
flanked on either side by noncoding regions.
Traditionally, therapeutic drug development has concen￾trated on discovering small molecules to treat diseases. A 
key consideration is the ability of a drug to reach its biological 
target, which is frequently inside a cell. The drug must therefore 
be stable enough to withstand distribution through the circulatory 
system and must be able to enter its cellular target. DNA and 
RNA carry net negative charges, so they do not readily pass 
through the plasma membrane, which is also negatively charged. 
The inherent instability of RNA polymers is an additional challenge 
(Section 26.11).
In 1990, a group of researchers injected DNA and RNA 
directly into mouse muscle and discovered that the encoded 
proteins were expressed at the injection site. Since that time, 
many researchers have been working on designing and deliver￾ing exogenous DNA and RNA for the modulation of intracellular 
protein expression. More than a dozen oligonucleotide-based 
drugs are FDA approved, and many more are in preclinical and 
clinical testing.
The most prominent successful exploitation of exogenous 
mRNA-based protein expression has been in the COVID-19 
mRNA vaccines, two of which received FDA approval in 2020. A 
synthetic form of mRNA that codes for the spike protein of the 
COVID-19 virus is protected from degradation and delivered to 
cells by encapsulating it in a mixture of lipids. These lipid 
nanoparticles (LNPs) contain natural lipids, such as cholesterol 
and phospholipids, as well as synthetic cationic lipids (to neutralize 
the negative charge of the mRNA) and polyethylene-glycol￾modified lipids (to prolong their circulation time). The mRNA￾containing LNPs enter a cell and release the mRNA. The 
synthetic mRNA is translated into multiple copies of the virus 
protein, which exits from the cell. The immune system recognizes 
the foreign protein and mounts a response.
A feature of mRNA therapy is that the exogenous mRNA is 
degraded in the cytoplasm and cannot integrate into a cell’s 
genome. Thus, the effect of the exogenous RNA is transient, 
which is an asset for its use in a vaccine. Its short-lived effects, 
however, are a challenge for other uses. Application of mRNA 
therapeutics to treat chronic diseases over long periods of time 
in which missing or deficient proteins are required is highly 
desirable and is a topic of intense research by academic and 
pharmaceutical scientists.

In addition to illustrating the mechanics of translation, Figure 26.13 is important 
in that it shows the mechanism of peptide bond formation as a nucleophilic acyl 
substitution. Both methionine and alanine are attached to their respective tRNAs as 
esters. In a reaction catalyzed by adenine in rRNA, the amino group of new amino 
acid attacks the ester bond between the growing peptide chain and its tRNA. The 
process displaces the growing peptide from its tRNA and converts the ester linkage 
to an amide, forming the peptide bond.
26.13 DNA Sequencing
To explain how DNA sequencing works, we must first mention restriction enzymes.
Like all organisms, bacteria are subject to infection by external invaders (e.g., viruses and 
other bacteria) and possess defenses in the form of restriction enzymes that destroy the 
invader by cleaving its DNA. Over 3000 restriction enzymes are known, and hundreds 
are readily available. Unlike proteases, which recognize a single amino acid, restriction 
enzymes recognize specific nucleotide sequences. Cleavage of the DNA at prescribed 
sequences gives fragments 100–200 base pairs in length, which can be separated, puri￾fied, and sequenced independently.
The general approach uses a DNA fragment as a template to create complements 
of itself, which are placed in a tube containing the materials necessary for DNA synthe￾sis. These materials include the four nucleosides present in DNA, 2′-deoxyadenosine 
(dA), 2′-deoxythymidine (dT), 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG), and 2′-deoxycytidine (dC), as 
their triphosphates dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. Also present are small amounts of 
synthetic analogs of ATP, TTP, GTP, and CTP that had been modified in two ways. Their 
2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups have been replaced by hydrogens giving the dideoxy nucleo￾tides 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP), 2′,3′-dideoxythymidine triphosphate 
(ddTTP), 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine triphosphate (ddGTP), and 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine triphos￾phate (ddCTP).
Because their furanose rings lack a 3′ hydroxyl group, incorporation of ddATP, 
ddTTP, ddGTP, or ddCTP into a growing strand of DNA terminates chain growth 
(Figure 26.14). In its original formulation by Frederick Sanger the method relied on 
priming DNA synthesis with 32P-labeled dideoxynucleotides, which were detected by 
a radioactivity tracing method. Sanger’s original method has been modified by using 
synthetic dideoxy nucleotides identified according to which of four different fluores￾cent dyes is attached to their purine or pyrimidine base.
As DNA synthesis proceeds, nucleotides from the solution are added to the growing 
polynucleotide chain. Chain extension takes place without complication as long as the 
incorporated nucleotides are derived from dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. If, however, 
the incorporated species is derived from a dideoxy analog, chain extension stops. Thus, 
the sample contains a mixture of DNA fragments of different length, each of which 
terminates in a dideoxy nucleotide.
After separation by electrophoresis, which discriminates among fragments accord￾ing to their length, the gel is read by irradiation at four different wavelengths. One 
wavelength causes the modified ddA-containing polynucleotides to fluoresce, another 
causes modified ddT fluorescence, and so on (Figure 26.14).
Sanger sequencing technology was used for The Human Genome Project, called 
complete in 2003. It took 13 years and cost about $3 billon; however, about 15% of the 
sequence was missing (about 500 million base pairs). Since then, great advances in DNA 
and RNA sequencing technologies have taken place to fill in the sequence gaps and to 
make genomic sequencing a routine practice. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an 
umbrella term used to describe variations in new sequencing approaches, which perform 
sequencing runs in a massively parallel fashion, sequencing millions of fragments simul￾taneously. Many of these systems retain Sanger’s fluorescent dideoxy nucleotides in their 
analyses. Using these new methods, the 3.055 billion–base pair sequence of the human 
genome was finally declared complete and published in the journal Science in 2022.
Sanger, who had already won a Nobel 
Prize in 1958 for protein sequencing, 
shared the 1980 chemistry prize with 
Walter Gilbert of Harvard University 
and Paul Berg of Stanford University. 
Gilbert developed a chemical method 
for DNA sequencing and Berg was 
responsible for many important 
techniques in the study of nucleic acids.O

DNA sequencing. (a) DNA synthesis proceeds in the 5′-to-3′ direction, in which the 3′-OH of the growing strand forms a phosphodiester bond with 
the next nucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), releasing pyrophosphate. The process continues as long as sufficient dNTP is present. (b) Adding a 
dideoxynucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP), which lacks the 3′-OH, terminates synthesis of the complementary strand. If a fluorophore is attached to the 
ddNTP, the truncated strand will be fluorescent. (c) The DNA fragment to be synthesized is annealed to a complementary primer. DNA synthesis 
proceeds in the presence of dNTPs and ddNTPs, each of which has a different color fluorophore attached. This process generates DNA strands that 
are different by one base and that contain one fluorophore at the 3′-end of the polymer. The strands are separated by electrophoresis and the identity 
of the 3′-nucleotide is shown by the fluorophore. An automated DNA sequencer translates this information into the sequence of the desired DNA.

Oligonucleotides contain about 50 or fewer nucleotides held together by 
phosphodiester links; polynucleotides can contain thousands of nucleotides. The 
carbohydrate component is d-ribose in the polynucleotide ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
and 2-deoxy-d-ribose in the polynucleotide deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
Section 26.7 The phosphodiester bond is very stable toward hydrolysis, but RNA is easily 
hydrolyzed. The 2′-OH of RNA is responsible for the large difference in 
hydrolytic stability of DNA and RNA.
Section 26.8 Before the 1940s, the material responsible for genetic transmission was unknown. 
Research into the structure of genetic material was culminated with Watson and 
Crick’s Nobel Prize–winning DNA structure.
Section 26.9 The most common form of DNA is B-DNA, which exists as a right-handed 
double helix. The carbohydrate–phosphate backbone lies on the outside, the 
purine and pyrimidine bases on the inside. The double helix is stabilized by 
complementary hydrogen bonding (base pairing) between adenine (A) and 
thymine (T), and guanine (G) and cytosine (C).
Section 26.10 During DNA replication the two strands of the double helix begin to unwind, 
exposing the pyrimidine and purine bases in the interior. Nucleotides with 
complementary bases hydrogen bond to the original strands and are joined 
together by phosphodiester linkages with the aid of DNA polymerase. Each new 
strand grows in its 5′→3′ direction.1130 Chapter 26 Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids
Section 26.11 Three RNAs are involved in gene expression. In the transcription phase, a 
strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized from a DNA template. The 
four bases A, G, C, and U, taken three at a time, generate 64 possible 
combinations called codons. These 64 codons comprise the genetic code and 
code for the 20 amino acids found in proteins plus start and stop signals. The 
mRNA sequence is translated into a prescribed protein sequence at the ribosomes. 
There, small polynucleotides called transfer RNA (tRNA), each of which 
contains an anticodon complementary to an mRNA codon, carries the correct 
amino acid for incorporation into the growing protein. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
is the main constituent of ribosomes and appears to catalyze protein biosynthesis.
RNA has many functions in the cell, such as in gene regulation, in 
addition to translating and expressing genes into proteins.
Section 26.12 The start codon for protein biosynthesis is AUG, which is the same as the codon 
for methionine. Thus, all proteins initially have methionine as their N-terminal 
amino acid, but lose it subsequent to their formation. The reaction responsible 
for extending the protein chain is nucleophilic acyl substitution.
Section 26.13 The nucleotide sequence of DNA can be determined by the Sanger method. 
This is a technique in which a short section of single-stranded DNA is allowed 
to produce its complement in the presence of dideoxy analogs of ATP, TTP, 
GTP, and CTP. DNA formation terminates when a dideoxy analog is incorporated 
into the growing polynucleotide chain. A mixture of polynucleotides differing 
from one another by an incremental nucleoside is produced and analyzed by 
electrophoresis. From the observed sequence of the complementary chain, the 
sequence of the original DNA is deduced.

Oligonucleotide Synthesis
In Section 26.6 we noted that synthetic oligonucleotides of defined sequence can be synthesized 
in a laboratory. Here we will examine how these oligonucleotides are prepared.
The method bears many similarities to the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis of peptides. A 
starter unit is attached to a solid support, nucleosides are attached one-by-one until the sequence 
is complete, whereupon the target oligonucleotide is removed from the support and purified. Like 
solid-phase peptide synthesis, the preparation of oligonucleotides relies heavily on protecting 
groups and bond-forming methods.

Thymidine lacks an NH2 group, so needs no protecting group on its pyrimidine base.
These N-protecting groups remain in place throughout the synthesis. They are the first ones 
added and the last ones removed. None of the further “chemistry” that takes place involves the 
purine or pyrimidine rings.
The 5′-OH group of the 2′-deoxyribose portion of the nucleosides is primary and more 
reactive toward ether formation than the 3′-OH group, which is secondary. This difference allows 
selective protection of the 5′-OH as its 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylmethyl (DMT) ether.

Synthetic Polymers
A polymer is a substance composed of macromolecules, mol￾ecules that contain a very large number of atoms and have a 
high molecular weight. Starch, cellulose, silk, and DNA are 
examples of naturally occurring polymers. Synthetic polymers 
include nylon, polyethylene, and Bakelite, among countless oth￾ers. Polymers need not be homogeneous, and most are not. Even 
one as simple as polyethylene is a mixture of macromolecules 
with different chain lengths and different degrees of branching.
This chapter is about synthetic polymers, many of which 
have been introduced in earlier chapters where we emphasized 
the connection between the reactions used to prepare polymers 
and the core reactions of organic chemistry. In this chapter, we 
will add new polymers and methods to those already introduced 
and expand our understanding of their synthesis, structure, and 
properties. As we do so, keep in mind that the reactions used 
to prepare polymers are the same fundamental reactions that 
occur with simple organic compounds.
27.1 Some Background
The earliest applications of polymer chemistry involved chemical 
modification designed to improve the physical properties of 
naturally occurring polymers. In 1839, Charles Goodyear trans￾formed natural rubber, which is brittle when cold and tacky 
Aerodynamics of the official 2014 World Cup soccer ball, named the Brazuca 
ball, were evaluated by NASA. Soccer balls are made of polymeric materials 
such as polyurethanes, which are prepared from a diol and a diioscyanate 
such as toluene diisocyanate.

Polymer science affects our daily lives in ways unimaginable 
until the early days of the twentieth century. Two men—Leo 
Baekeland and Wallace Carothers—both chemists by training 
and innovators by inclination deserve special mention for their 
roles in bringing it about.
Baekeland was born in Belgium in 1863 and spent his 
early professional life in Europe. Baekeland visited the United 
States in 1886, became a citizen in 1897, and maintained homes 
in New York and Florida until his death in 1944. Baekeland is best 
known for introducing polymer chemistry to the world of commerce 
in a way that affected the daily lives of people everywhere.
Baekeland had already become independently wealthy 
by inventing one of the earliest photographic films and contin￾ued to carry out research designed to produce new materials by 
chemical methods. By 1907, Baekeland and coworkers had 
created a novel polymer by heating phenol and formaldehyde in 
a sealed container. Baekeland named the polymer and the 
company formed to produce it Bakelite (Figure 27.1).

As early as 1912, billiard balls made of Bakelite began to 
replace ivory ones. Other applications followed and for decades 
thereafter, it almost always went without saying that anything 
“plastic” was Bakelite. Now, more than 100 years after Bakelite 
was invented, numerous products made from it continue to be 
produced. The company and its name still exist, but as part of an 
international conglomerate.
Wallace Carothers’s story could not be more different, 
yet his accomplishments rival those of Baekeland. Carothers 
was born in Iowa in 1896 and, after graduate work and in the 
early stages of a career in academic teaching and research, 
was recruited to work at the DuPont Experimental Station in 
Wilmington, Delaware, in 1928. Carothers was soon given the 
job of directing a group involved in developing commercially 
useful polymers. After successfully working out the details for 
completing an existing project that eventually led to neo￾prene, Carothers and coworkers settled on polyamides as 
attractive candidates for investigation, “nylon 6,6” emerged, 
and the rest is history.
Nylon 6,6 is a polyamide with each “6” designating the 
number of carbons in the precursor molecules—adipic acid 
[HO2C(CH2)4CO2H] and hexamethylenediamine [H2N(CH2)6NH2].

Nylon 6,6 not only proved to be successful in its own right, 
but inspired DuPont and others to pursue polymer chemistry 
with increasing vigor, both in designing candidate structures 
and novel methods for preparing them. Carothers, however, 
died suddenly in 1937 and one can only speculate what might 
have been had he not.1140 Chapter 27 Synthetic Polymers
when warm, to a substance that maintains its elasticity over a wider temperature range 
by heating it with sulfur (vulcanization). The first synthetic fibers—called rayons—were 
made by chemical modification of cellulose near the end of the nineteenth century.
Leo Baekeland patented the first totally synthetic polymer, calling it Bakelite, in 
1910 (Figure 27.1). Bakelite is a versatile, durable material prepared from low-cost 
materials (phenol and formaldehyde) and was the most successful synthetic material of 
its kind for many years.
These early successes notwithstanding, knowledge about polymer structure was 
meager. Most chemists believed that rubber, proteins, and the like were colloidal disper￾sions of small molecules. During the 1920s Hermann Staudinger, beginning at the Swiss 
Federal Institute of Technology and continuing at the University of Freiburg, argued that 
polymers were high-molecular-weight compounds held together by normal covalent 
bonds. Staudinger’s views received convincing support in a 1929 paper by Wallace H. 
Carothers of Du Pont who reached similar conclusions.
Staudinger’s studies of polymer structure and Carothers’s achievements in polymer 
synthesis accelerated the development of polymer chemistry, especially its shift from 
chemical modification of natural polymers to the design and synthesis of new materials. 
Thousands of synthetic polymers are now known; some mimic the properties of natural 
materials, others have superior properties and have replaced natural materials.
27.2 Polymer Nomenclature
Although the IUPAC has set forth rules for naming polymers according to structure, an 
alternative IUPAC source-based system that names polymers according to the monomers
from which they are prepared is more widely used.
Source-based names are, for example, the ones we are accustomed to seeing for 
polymers such as polyethylene (see Section 10.8) and polystyrene (see Section 12.14). 
When the name of the monomer is a single word, the polymer derived from it is gener￾ated by simply adding the prefix poly-. When the name of the monomer consists of two 
words, both words are enclosed in parentheses immediately following poly. Thus, poly￾acrylonitrile and poly(vinyl chloride) are the polymers of acrylonitrile and vinyl chloride, 
respectively.
Acrylonitrile Polyacrylonitrile
H2C CH C N
Vinyl chloride
H2C CH Cl n
CH2 CH
C N
Poly(vinyl chloride)
n

Cl
The convention for writing polymer formulas is to enclose the repeating unit within 
brackets, followed by the letter n to indicate that the number of repeating units is not 
specified. It is, however, assumed to be large.

Staudinger received the 1953 Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry for studies of 
polymers. Carothers would likely have 
shared in the award, but they cannot 
be awarded posthumously.
A monomer is any compound from 
which a polymer can be prepared.27.3 Classification of Polymers: Reaction Type 1141

Source-based nomenclature does not require that a particular polymer actually be 
made from the “source” monomer. Both poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(ethylene oxide), 
for example, are made from ethylene oxide and have the same repeating unit.
n
CH2CH2O
The structural difference between the two is that the value of n is larger for poly(ethylene 
oxide) than for poly(ethylene glycol). Therefore, their physical properties are different 
and they are known by different source-based names.
Many polymers are routinely referred to by their common names or trade names. The 
polymer n
CF2CF2 is almost always called Teflon rather than polytetrafluoroethylene.
27.3 Classification of Polymers: Reaction Type
Structure, synthesis, production, and applications of polymers span so many disciplines 
that it is difficult to classify them in a way that serves every interest. Figure 27.2 compares 
some of the different ways. This section describes how polymers are classified according 
to the type of reaction—addition or condensation—that occurs.

where the product (A—B) retains all of the atoms of the reactants (A + B). In the general 
equation, A and B are monomers that react to give the polymer. When A = B, the resulting 
polymer is a homopolymer. Polystyrene is an example of a homopolymer.

The two components in a copolymer need not be present in equal-molar amounts. In a 
typical Saran formulation vinylidene chloride is the major monomer (about 85%), and 
vinyl chloride the minor one.
Polymers prepared from alkenes, regardless of whether they are homopolymers or 
copolymers, are known as polyolefins and are the most familiar addition polymers.
Not all addition polymers are polyolefins. Formaldehyde, for example, polymerizes 
to give an addition polymer that retains all of the atoms of the monomer.

When monomeric formaldehyde is needed, to react with a Grignard reagent, for example, 
it is prepared as needed by heating the polymer in order to “depolymerize” it.
Problem 27.2
Under certain conditions formaldehyde forms a cyclic trimer (C3H6O3) called trioxane. Suggest 
a structure for this compound.
Condensation polymers are prepared by covalent bond formation between mono￾mers, accompanied by the loss of some small molecule such as water, an alcohol, or a 
hydrogen halide. The condensation reaction:
X + Y + X Y
gives a condensation polymer when applied to difunctional reactants. The first condensa￾tion step:
X X + Y Y X Y + X Y
gives a product that has reactive functional groups. Condensation of these functional 
groups with reactant molecules extends the chain.
Y Y + X Y + X X Y X + 2X Y
The product retains complementary functional groups at both ends and can continue to grow.27.4 Classification of Polymers: Chain Growth and Step Growth 1143
The most familiar condensation polymers are polyamides, polyesters, and 
polycarbonates.
The aramids, polyamides in which aromatic rings are joined by amide bonds, are 
one class of condensation polymer. Heating 1,4-benzenediamine and the acyl chloride of 
benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (terephthalic acid) gives the aramid Kevlar with loss of 
hydrogen chloride.

Problem 27.3
The amide bond between a molecule of 1,4-benzenediamine and a molecule of terephthaloyl 
chloride is formed by the usual nucleophilic acyl substitution mechanism. Write a structural

27.4 Classification of Polymers: Chain 
Growth and Step Growth
Addition and condensation are familiar to us as reaction types in organic chemistry. The 
terms we apply to the two different ways that macromolecules arise from lower-molecular￾weight units are unique to polymer chemistry and are illustrated in Figure 27.4.
In a chain-growth process monomers add one-by-one to the same end of a growing 
chain (Figure 27.4a). Each chain has only one growth point. The concentration of monomer 
decreases gradually until it is depleted.
The terms chain growth and step 
growth are attributed to Paul Flory, 
who was awarded the 1974 Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry for studies on the 
physical chemistry of polymers.
Figure 27.4
Chain-growth (a) and step-growth (b) polymerization. During chain growth, the amount of monomer remaining decreases gradually. In step growth, 
most of the monomer is consumed early and the molecular weight of the polymer increases as oligomers combine to form longer chains.
(a) Chain growth: Monomers add one-by-one to the same end of a growing chain.
(b) Step growth: A mixture of polymers of intermediate length (oligomers) form.
These oligomers react together to give longer chains.

Police and the military depend on body 
armor and helmets made of Kevlar 
fibers. Kevlar protective equipment is 
more effective than steel, yet far lighter 
in weight.
NEstudio/Shutterstock1144 Chapter 27 Synthetic Polymers
In a step-growth process (Figure 27.4b), chains have at least two growth points. 
Most of the monomer molecules are consumed early in the process to give a mixture of 
compounds of intermediate molecular weight called oligomers. These oligomers react 
with one another to form the polymer. The molecular weight continues to increase even 
after all the monomer molecules have reacted.
In general, chain growth is associated with addition polymerization and step growth 
with condensation polymerization. It is not always so, however. We’ll see in Section 27.14 
that polyurethanes are addition polymers in which step growth, not chain growth, 
characterizes macromolecule formation.

27.5 Classification of Polymers: Structure
Polymers made from the same compounds can have different properties depending on 
how they are made. These differences in physical properties result from differences in the 
overall structure of the polymer chain. The three major structural types—linear, branched, 
and cross-linked—are illustrated in Figure 27.5. Other, more specialized, structural types—
ladders, stars, and dendrimers—have unique properties and are under active investigation.
Linear polymers (Figure 27.5a) have a continuous chain of repeating units. The 
repeating units within the chain are subject to the usual conformational requirements of 
organic chemistry. The collection of chains can range from random, much like a bowl 
Figure 27.5
(a) A linear polymer has a continuous chain. (b) A branched polymer has relatively short branches connected to the main chain. (c) A cross-linked 
polymer has covalently bonded linking units between chains. The main chains are shown in blue, the branches in red, and the cross links in yellow.
(a) Linear (b) Branched
(c) Cross-linked27.5 Classification of Polymers: Structure 1145
of spaghetti, to ordered. We describe polymers at the random extreme as amorphous and 
those at the ordered extreme as crystalline.
Most polymers are a mixture of random tangles interspersed with crystalline 
domains called crystallites (Figure 27.6). The degree of crystallinity of a polymer, that 
is, the percentage of crystallites, depends on the strength of intermolecular forces between 
chains. For a particular polymer, density increases with crystallinity because randomly 
coiled chains consume volume, while closer packing puts the same mass into a smaller 
volume. The efficiency with which the chains can pack together is strongly affected by 
the extent to which the chain is branched.
Branched polymers (Figure 27.5b) have branches extending from the main chain. 
In general, increased branching reduces the crystallinity of a polymer and alters proper￾ties such as density.
Contrast the properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density 
(HDPE), two of the six polymers familiar enough to have their own identifying codes 
for recycling (Table 27.1). Both are homopolymers of ethylene, but are prepared by dif￾ferent methods and have different properties and uses. As their names imply, LDPE has 
a lower density than HDPE (0.92 g/cm3
 versus 0.96 g/cm3
). LDPE is softer, HDPE more 
rigid. LDPE has a lower melting point than HDPE. LDPE is the plastic used for grocery 
store bags; HDPE is stronger and used for water bottles, milk jugs, and gasoline tanks.
The structural difference between the two is that LDPE is more branched, averaging 
about 20 branches for every thousand carbon atoms compared with about 5 per thousand 
for HDPE. The greater density of HDPE results from packing more mass into the same 
volume. Unbranched chains pack more efficiently than branched ones, which translates into 
stronger intermolecular forces, greater crystallinity, and a tougher, more durable material.
Like HDPE, isotactic polypropylene is highly crystalline with numerous uses, 
including fibers for rope and carpets. Atactic polypropylene, on the other hand, is much 
less crystalline and has few applications.
Chains in a cross-linked or network polymer (Figure 27.5c) are connected to one 
another by linking units, which may be long or short and composed of the same repeating 
units as the main chain or different ones. Vulcanization, for example, uses sulfur to cross￾link the hydrocarbon chains of natural rubber. In general, cross linking increases rigidity by 
Stereoregular polymers including 
isotactic polypropylene were 
described in Section 15.15.

restricting the movement of the polymer chains. Vulcanized rubber is a lightly cross-linked 
elastomer; Bakelite can be so highly cross-linked as to be considered a single molecule.
27.6 Classification of Polymers: Properties
How a polymer responds to changes in temperature is important not only with respect 
to the conditions under which it can be used, but also in the methods by which it is 
transformed into a commercial product.
Thermoplastic polymers are the most common and are those that soften when heated. 
At their glass transition temperature (Tg), thermoplastic polymers change from a glass to 
a flexible, rubbery state. Past this point amorphous polymers are gradually transformed to 
a liquid as the temperature is raised. Crystalline polymers undergo a second transition, 
liquefying only when the melting temperature (Tm) is reached. Compare the behaviors of 
atactic, isotactic, and syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) on being heated.

syndiotactic 126 200
The atactic form of poly(methyl methacrylate) is amorphous and exhibits only one tran￾sition temperature (Tg). The stereoregular isotactic and syndiotactic forms are partially 
crystalline and undergo both a glass transition and melting.
The process that takes place at Tg is an increase in the conformational mobility of the 
polymer chains. At Tm, attractive forces in crystallites are broken and individual chains separate.
Melting temperature is an important factor in respect to how polymers are used. 
The relatively low Tm for low-density polyethylene (115°C) makes it an easy polymer to 
cast into the desired shape when melted, but at the same time limits its applications. 
When, for example, a container is required that must be sterilized by heating, the higher 
Tm of HDPE (137°C) makes it a better choice than LDPE.
Unlike thermoplastic polymers that soften on heating, thermosetting polymers (also 
called thermosetting resins) pass through a liquid state then solidify (“cure”) on continued 
heating. The solidified material is a thermoset. It is formed by irreversible chemical reac￾tions that create cross links as the thermosetting polymer is heated. Bakelite, a highly 
cross-linked thermoset made from phenol and formaldehyde, is prepared in two stages. In 
the first stage, condensation between phenol and formaldehyde gives a polymer, which, 
in its fluid state, is cast in molds and heated, whereupon it solidifies to a hard, rigid mass. 
The chemical reactions that form the fluid polymer and the solid thermoset are the same 
kind of condensations; the difference is that there are more cross links in the thermoset. 
Melamine (used in plastic dinnerware) is another example of a thermoset.
Elastomers are flexible polymers that can be stretched but return to their original 
state when the stretching force is released. Most amorphous polymers become rubbery 
beyond their glass transition temperature, but not all rubbery polymers are elastic. Cross 
links in elastomers limit the extent to which elastomers can be deformed then encourage 
them to return to their original shape when they are relaxed.

Termination Steps in Alkene Polymerization: The main chain-terminating processes 
in free-radical polymerization are combination and disproportionation. In a combination, 
the pairing of the odd electron of one growing radical chain with that of another gives 
a stable macromolecule.

each of which is present in low concentration, they have a low probability compared with 
chain growth, in which a radical reacts with a monomer. Combination involves only bond 
making and has a low activation energy; disproportionation has a higher activation energy 
because bond breaking accompanies bond making. Disproportionation has a more adverse 
effect on chain length and molecular weight than combination.

27.8 Chain Branching in Free-Radical Polymerization
Even with the same monomer, the properties of a polymer can vary significantly depend￾ing on how it is prepared. Free-radical polymerization of ethylene gives low-density 
polyethylene; coordination polymerization gives high-density polyethylene. The proper￾ties are different because the structures are different, and the difference in the structures 
comes from the mechanisms by which the polymerizations take place. Free-radical 
polymerization of ethylene gives a branched polymer, coordination polymerization gives 
a linear one.
What is the mechanism responsible for the branching that occurs in the free-radical 
polymerization of ethylene?
By itself, the propagation step in the free-radical polymerization of ethylene cannot 
produce branches.
Polymer CH2 CH2 H2C CH2 Polymer CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2
In order for the polymer to be branched, an additional process must occur involving a 
radical site somewhere other than at the end of the chain. The two main ways this can 
happen both involve hydrogen abstraction from within the polymer chain.
1. Intramolecular hydrogen-atom abstraction
2. Intermolecular hydrogen-atom abstraction (chain transfer)
Intramolecular Hydrogen-Atom Abstraction: Mechanism 27.1 shows how intra￾molecular hydrogen atom abstraction can lead to the formation of a four-carbon branch. 
Recall that an intramolecular process takes place within a molecule, not between mole￾cules. As the mechanism shows, the radical at the end of the growing polymer abstracts 
a hydrogen atom from the fifth carbon. Five carbons and one hydrogen comprise six 
atoms of a cyclic transition state. When a hydrogen atom is removed from the fifth 
carbon, a secondary radical is generated at that site. This, then, is the carbon that becomes 
the origin for further chain growth. Analogous mechanisms apply to branches shorter or 
longer than four carbons.27.8 Chain Branching in Free-Radical Polymerization 1151
Problem 27.7
Suggest an explanation for the observation that branches shorter or longer than four carbons 
are found infrequently in polyethylene. Frame your explanation in terms of how ΔH and ΔS
affect the activation energy for intramolecular hydrogen-atom abstraction.
A comparable process cannot occur when Ziegler–Natta catalysts are used because 
free radicals are not intermediates in coordination polymerization.
Intermolecular Hydrogen-Atom Abstraction (Chain Transfer): Mechanism 27.2 
shows how a growing polymer chain abstracts a hydrogen atom from a terminated chain. 
The original growing chain is now terminated, and the original terminated chain is acti￾vated toward further growth. Chain growth, however, occurs at the branch point, not at 
the end of the chain. An already long chain adds a branch while terminating a (presum￾ably shorter) growing chain. Chain transfer not only leads to branching, but also encour￾ages disparity in chain lengths—more short chains and more long branched chains. Both 
decrease the crystallinity of the polymer and reduce its strength.
As in the case of intramolecular hydrogen abstraction, branching by chain transfer 
is not a problem when alkenes are polymerized under Ziegler–Natta conditions because 
free radicals are not intermediates in coordination polymerization.

27.9 Anionic Polymerization: Living Polymers
Anionic polymerization is a useful alternative to free-radical and Ziegler–Natta proce￾dures for certain polymers. Adding butyllithium to a solution of styrene in tetrahydrofuran 
(THF), for example, gives polystyrene.

Mechanism 27.3 shows how addition of butyllithium to the double bond of styrene initiates 
polymerization. The product of this step is a benzylic carbanion that then adds to a second 
molecule of styrene to give another benzylic carbanion, and so on by a chain-growth process.
Polystyrene formed under these conditions has a narrower range of molecular weights 
than provided by other methods. Initiation of polymerization by addition of butyllithium 
to styrene is much faster than subsequent chain growth. Thus, all the butyllithium is con￾sumed and the number of chains is equal to the number of molecules of butyllithium used. 
These starter chains then grow at similar rates to produce similar chain lengths.
Problem 27.8
How will the average chain length of polystyrene vary with the amount of butyllithium used 
to initiate polymerization?
As shown in step 3 of Mechanism 27.3, once all of the monomer is consumed 
the polymer is present as its organolithium derivative. This material is referred to as

The organolithium reagent is stable, but easily protonated by water to give polystyrene. Alternatively, another

better known in polymer chemistry by its common name isobutylene. Mechanism 27.4

The popularity of clothing made of polyester-cotton blends testifies to the economic

usually made of PETE, as are Mylar film and Dacron fibers (Figure 27.8).
Alkyd resins number in the hundreds and are used in glossy paints and enamels—
house, car, and artist’s—as illustrated in Figure 27.9. Most are derived from benzene￾1,2-dicarboxylic acid (o-phthalic acid) and 1,2,3-propanetriol (glycerol). Two of the 
hydroxyl groups of glycerol are converted to esters of o-phthalic acid; the third is

which to grow skin cells. This “artificial skin” is then applied to a wound to promote healing.

Problem 27.14
Write the repeating unit of the “polymeric diol” if it is derived from 1,2-epoxypropane.
The reaction of an alcohol with an isocyanate is addition, not condensation. There￾fore, polyurethanes are classified as addition polymers. But because the monomers are 
difunctional, the molecular weight increases by step growth rather than chain growth.
A major use of polyurethanes is in spandex fibers. Spandex, even when stretched 
several times its length, has the ability to return to its original state and is a superior 
substitute for rubber in elastic garments. Its most recognizable application is in athletic 
wear (swimming, cycling, running) where it is the fabric of choice for high-performance 
athletes (Figure 27.11).
Polyurethanes have many other applications, especially in paints, adhesives, and 
foams. Polyurethane foams, which can be rigid (insulation panels) or flexible (pillows, 
cushions, and mattresses) depending on their degree of cross linking, are prepared by 
adding foaming agents to the polymerization mixture. One method takes advantage of 
the reaction between isocyanates and water.

Although esters of carbamic acid (urethanes) are stable compounds, carbamic acid itself 
rapidly dissociates to an amine and carbon dioxide. Adding some water to the reactants dur￾ing polymerization generates carbon dioxide bubbles which are trapped within the polymer.
27.15 Copolymers
Copolymers, polymers made from more than one monomer, are as common as homo￾polymers. The presence of more than one monomer in a chain makes some control of 
properties possible. Some structural units stiffen the chain, others make it more flexible. 
Often a second monomer is added to allow cross linking.
Copolymers are classified according to the distribution of monomers in the 
macromolecule.

out on a mixture of styrene and 1,3-butadiene. Free-radical initiation is essentially non￾selective and gives the random copolymer. Anionic initiation is carried out under condi￾tions designed to equalize the reactivity of the two monomers so as to ensure randomness.

A graft copolymer of styrene and 1,3-butadiene is called “high-impact polystyrene” 
and is used, for example, in laptop computer cases. It is prepared by free-radical poly￾merization of styrene in the presence of poly(1,3-butadiene). Instead of reacting with 
styrene, the free-radical initiator abstracts an allylic hydrogen from poly(1,3-butadiene).

Polystyrene alone is brittle; poly(1,3-butadiene) alone is rubbery. The graft 
copolymer is strong, but absorbs shock without cracking because of the elasticity 
provided by its poly(1,3-butadiene) structural units.
Conducting Polymers
The notion that polymers can conduct electricity seems 
strange to most of us. After all, the plastic wrapped around 
the wires in our homes and automobiles serves as insulation. Do 
polymers exist that can conduct electricity? Even if such materi￾als could be made, why would we be interested in them?
Henry Letheby, a lecturer in chemistry and toxicology at 
the College of London Hospital, obtained a partially conducting 
material in 1862 by the anodic oxidation of aniline in sulfuric acid. 
The material Letheby synthesized was a form of polyaniline. In 
the 1980s, Alan MacDiarmid of the University of Pennsylvania 
reinvestigated polyaniline, which is now a widely used conduct￾ing polymer. Polyaniline exists in a variety of oxidation states 
(Figure 27.12), each with different properties. The emaraldine salt 
is a conductor without the use of additives that enhance conduc￾tivity, but its conductivity is enhanced by adding a Brønsted acid 
that protonates the nitrogen atoms.

Section 27.1 Polymer chemistry dates to the nineteenth century with the chemical modification 
of polymeric natural products. Once the structural features of polymers were 
determined, polymer synthesis was placed on a rational basis.
Section 27.2 Polymers are usually named according to the monomers from which they are 
prepared (source-based nomenclature). When the name of the monomer is one 
word, the polymer is named by simply adding the prefix poly-. When the name of 
the monomer is two words, they are enclosed in parentheses and preceded by poly.

27.16 SUMMARY
The synthesis of polyaniline can be carried out in aqueous 
HCl solution, by electrochemical oxidation, or in the presence of 
a chemical oxidant such as ammonium persulfate. The different 
forms of polyaniline can then be obtained by altering the current 
or the pH of the solution. The ability to tailor the process increases 
the potential for commercial application where the unique prop￾erties of a certain polyaniline are desired. Polyanilines are used 
as corrosion inhibitors and in the electromagnetic shielding of 
circuits, where they can protect against electrostatic discharge.
Another conducting polymer that has found commer￾cial application is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT, 
which is marketed as a dispersion that contains poly(styrene 
sulfonate). This polymer dispersion is used in the manufacture 
of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are materials 
that emit light when an electric current is applied to them 
(Figure 27.13). OLEDs are used for flat panel displays in televi￾sions and cellular telephone displays.
The 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Alan 
Heeger (University of California Santa Barbara), Alan MacDiarmid 
(University of Pennsylvania), and Hideki Shirakawa (University of 
Tsukuba, Japan) for their “discovery and development of electri￾cally conductive polymers.”

Sections Polymers may be classified in several different ways:
• Reaction type (addition and condensation)
• Chain growth or step growth
• Structure (linear, branched, cross-linked)
• Properties (thermoplastic, thermoset, or elastomer)
Section 27.7 This section emphasizes initiation and termination steps in alkene polymerization. 
The main terminating reactions in free-radical polymerization are the coupling of 
two radicals and disproportionation. Coupling of two radicals pairs the odd 
electrons and stops chain growth.
Polymer CH2 H2C Polymer Polymer CH2 CH2 Polymer
In disproportionation, a hydrogen atom is exchanged between two growing 
chains, terminating one in a double bond and the other in a new C—H bond.

Section 27.8 Free-radical polymerization of alkenes usually gives branched polymers of low 
crystallinity. The two main mechanisms by which branches form both involve 
hydrogen-atom abstraction by the radical site. In one, a growing chain abstracts 
a hydrogen atom from a terminated polymer.

The other is an intramolecular hydrogen-atom abstraction. In most cases this 
reaction proceeds by a six-center transition state and moves the reactive site 
from the end of the growing chain to inside it.

Section 27.15 Copolymers are the polymers formed when two or more monomers are present 
in the mixture to be polymerized. They are classified as random, block, or 
graft. A random copolymer lacks a regular sequence in respect to the appearance 
of the structural units of the components. A block copolymer of monomers A 
and B is composed of blocks of poly(A) and poly(B). A graft copolymer has a 
main chain of poly(A) to which are grafted branches of poly(B).Problems 1165

At the same time that Merrifield was developing a method for the solid-phase synthesis of peptides, 
Robert Letsinger (Northwestern University) was independently applying the same concept to 
polynucleotide synthesis. Modern methods for making oligonucleotides are direct descendants of 
Letsinger’s method.
Today’s chemists can buy Merrifield-type resins with varying degrees of chloromethyl 
substitution and cross linking tailored for specific purposes. Because the chlorine atom is primary 
and benzylic, these resins can be further modified by nucleophilic substitution.

polystyrene or a copolymer of polystyrene and p-divinylbenzene.)
The products of these reactions form the basis for an entire methodology—polymer-supported 
chemical reactions—wherein the modified polystyrene serves as a reactant, reagent, or catalyst. 
The reactions are the usual ones of organic chemistry. In the following equation, for example, the 
modified polystyrene serves as a phase-transfer catalyst (see Section 22.5). The main advantage 
of using a polymer-supported reagent, or in this case a polymer-supported catalyst, is that it makes 
isolation of the reaction product easier.

Cyanide ion from aqueous KCN exchanges with Cl− of the polymer-supported phosphonium 
chloride and reacts with 1-bromooctane on the surface and within channels of the polymer support. 
When the reaction is judged to be complete, the polymer (insoluble in both toluene and water) is 
recovered by filtration and the aqueous layer removed. Distillation of the toluene solution of the 
product furnishes nonanenitrile, the product of nucleophilic substitution of cyanide for bromide.
The number of applications of chemically modified polymers as materials, reagents, and
