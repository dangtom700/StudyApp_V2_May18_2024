List of Contributors xixPreface
This book provides basic concepts and recent advances of fluid flow and transport in unconven￾tional reservoirs across different scales (from pore to core and to reservoir) for a broad range of
audiences from various scientific disciplines, such as geology, geoscience, geochemistry, geophys￾ics, rock mechanics, and petroleum engineering. In the Introduction chapter, we address recent
progress and ongoing challenges related to hydrocarbon exploration and production in tight and
ultra-tight formations. The first part of the book on pore-scale characterizations consists of three
chapters. In the second chapter, Wang and his coworkers present an overview of recent progress
on pore-scale simulations and digital rock physics to unconventional reservoir rocks. They
emphasize that further small-scale experiments are still required to validate numerical models.
In Chapter 3, Wu and Tahmasebi review digital rock models. They discuss that incorporating
multiresolution and multiscale structures and generating large-scale digital models are still very
challenging. In Chapter 4, Ghanbarian and Esmaeilpour address the effect of scale on permea￾bility and formation factor. They present a simple scaling law and show reasonable agreement
between theoretical estimations and pore-network simulations. Part II of the book on core-scale
heterogeneity includes seven chapters. In Chapter 5, Ghanbarian et al. study theoretical modeling
of single-phase and gas relative permeabilities in shales and tight porous rocks. They apply con￾cepts of the effective-medium approximation and demonstrate that by including the physics of
gas flow, one can estimate permeability reasonably well at the core scale. Chapter 6 by Chen
and his coworkers addresses applications of nuclear magnetic resonance and its recent advances
to determine total porosity and partial porosity in organic matter of unconventional reservoir
rocks. In Chapter 7, recent progress on tight rock permeability measurement is addressed by
Liu, Zhang, and Boudjatit. They present two newly developed laboratory methods and evaluate
them using laboratory measurements. Chapter 8 by Bhandari et al. presents permeability
evolution under cycling confining stress conditions. They demonstrate that micro-fractures
might be closed due to confining stress leading to permeability reduction under cyclic loading.
In Chapter 9, Gao and Hu provide insights into shale wettability using spontaneous imbibition
experiments. Their results demonstrate the co-existence of water and oil in the pore network of
shales proving their mixed-wet characteristics. In Chapter 10, Schwartz and Elsworth study per￾meability enhancement in shales induced by desorption. Those authors argue that the magnitude
of permeability enhancement depends on the distribution of sorptive mineral components, geom￾etry of flow path, and initial permeability. Chapter 11 by Liang, Liu, and Zhang provides insights
that help improve oil and gas production in unconventional reservoirs. More specifically, their
experimental evidence shows that aqueous-based fracturing fluid may have positive impacts
on gas production from organic-rich carbonate source rocks. The last part of the book focuses
on large-scale petrophysics of unconventional reservoirs, which has broad applications to field.
xxiIn Chapter 12, Ghanbarian proposes percolation-based effective-medium theory to model effec￾tive permeability in matrix-fracture systems. By comparing with numerical simulations, he shows
that effective permeability can be accurately estimated at different fracture densities. In Chapter
13, Xie et al. apply embedded discrete fracture model to simulate fluid flow in complex fracture
networks. They address the effect of natural fracture properties, such as fracture azimuth, length,
and dip angle. Chapter 14 by Liu and his coauthors presents a closed-form relationship for pro￾duction rate. By comparing with numerical simulations, Liu et al. validate their proposed model
for different initial reservoir pressures, pressure drawdowns, and pressure sensitivity factors for
permeability. In the last chapter, Mesdour et al. discuss sweet spots and their identification in
shale reservoirs. They provide a state-of-art review of existing methods developed for sweet spot
identification and address relevant challenges and knowledge gaps.
Many colleagues and students contributed to our understanding of fluid flow and transport in
unconventional reservoirs. We are grateful to those who helped us with this book. We also acknowl￾edge those who contributed to this book by writing different chapters on several topics. We hope
this book helps geologists and petroleum engineers in industry as well as faculty and students in
academia.

1.1 Background
Energy is one of the most important components in the world. Primary sources of energy take
various forms, such as fossil energy, nuclear energy, and renewable energy sources. Fossil energy
resources (e.g. coal, oil, and natural gas) were formed when plants and animals died and were
buried underground. The quality of hydrocarbon accordingly depends on organic content as well
as temperature and pressure conditions. Although there are limited reserves of fossil energy
resources and despite recent advances in renewable energy, global economy still depends on fossil
fuels to a great extent (Figure 1.1). Statistics reported by the British Petroleum (BP) company based
on data from 1994 to 2019 show that the world primary energy consumption growth in 2019 slowed
to 1.3%. This is less than half the growth rate i.e. 2.8% in 2018. Three-quarters of the energy
consumption increase was driven by natural gas and renewable resources in 2019.
Based on analyses reported by the BP company, oil has contributed to the share of global primary
energy more than others since 1994 (Figure 1.2) with 33.1% contribution in 2019. After oil, coal and
natural gas are the second and third largest contributors. Although coal lost its share to account for
nearly 27%, the contribution of natural gas increased to 24% in 2019. The share of renewable
resources rose to record highs of 5% in 2019, and they overtook nuclear energy with about 4% con￾tribution. Figure 1.2 shows the share of hydroelectricity has been nearly constant and about 6%.
Unconventional reservoirs, including oil and gas shales and tight sandstones, are distributed
around the world (Figure 1.3) with an estimated endowment of several thousand trillion cubic feet
(Kim et al. 2000). Since shale reservoirs have been successfully explored and produced in the United
States (Figure 1.3), they recently became one of the major contributors to energy supplies.
There exist three general types of unconventional reservoirs, i.e. (i) organic-rich source rocks,
(ii) tight oil reservoirs, and (iii) hybrid plays in which production occurs from source rocks and
conventional reservoirs (Zoback and Kohli 2019). These types of unconventional reservoirs are
different in geologic formations and, therefore, should be optimally exploited using different
and appropriate approaches.
Despite numerous practical applications in oil/gas exploration and production as well as recent
progress, we are still far from fully understanding all mechanisms of flow and transport in shales

address recent advances in unconventional reservoirs and discuss current challenges in oil and gas
exploration and production.
1.2 Advances
Since 2005, the beginning of shale gas revolution in the United States, unconventional oil and gas
resources as well as their developments and productions have received a remarkable amount of
attention around the world (Zoback and Kohli 2019). Despite various challenges that still exist,
the petroleum engineering community made tremendous progress, particularly in the past decade.
In what follows, we briefly address several notable achievements. For further details and compre￾hensive recent advances, see e.g. Barati and Alhubail (2020), Rezaee (2021), and Moghanloo (2022).
1.2.1 Wettability
Characterizing the contact angle of fluids (e.g. water, oil, and gas) and its spatial variability within
unconventional reservoirs and under in situ conditions are essential not only to understand the trap￾ping phenomenon and enhance oil and gas recovery but also to improve greenhouse gas (e.g. carbon
dioxide and hydrogen) sequestration underground. In the literature, various methods, such as contact
angle measurements (Iglauer et al. 2015; Roshan et al. 2016), spontaneous imbibition (Liu et al. 2019;
Siddiqui et al. 2019), and nuclear magnetic resonance (Odusina et al. 2011; Su et al. 2018) were pro￾posed to determine wettability in unconventional reservoir rocks. Recently, Arif et al. (2021) collected

of World Energy (2020)/BP International Limited.
4 1 Unconventional Reservoirspublished data on shale contact angle measurements and developed a repository. They concluded
that the oil-brine mixture in shales behaved in terms of wettability over a wide range from water￾wet to strongly oil-wet. Although the CO2-brine mixture typically showed weakly water-wet to
CO2-wet behavior, the CH4-brine mixture in shales was weakly water-wet. Arif et al. (2021) also inves￾tigated what causes high variabilities in shale wettability and found that the main factors were pres￾sure, temperature, thermal maturity, total organic content, and mineralogy of shales.
Although our knowledge of shale wettability has improved, further investigations are still needed
to study the solid–fluid and fluid–fluid contact angles under realistic reservoir conditions more
comprehensively. This would help enhance oil and gas recovery and exploit unconventional reser￾voirs even more successfully.
1.2.2 Permeability
Liquid and gas transports in shales and tight porous rocks were widely studied, particularly at the
pore and core levels. The literature on gas permeability and its modeling is indeed vast and exten￾sive (Javadpour et al. 2021; Liu 2017; Tahmasebi et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2019). Numerous models

Energy 2020/BP International Limited).
1.2 Advances 5were developed to address gas flow in nanostructures of shales by taking the effect of different trans￾port mechanisms, such as slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, and sorption into
account. For example, Beskok and Karniadakis (1999) incorporated the effect of slip flow and mod￾ified the Poiseuille equation to describe gas flow in a cylindrical tube. Civan (2010) later applied the

6 1 Unconventional ReservoirsBeskok–Karniadakis model to scale up gas permeability in a network of pores. Using concepts from
first-order slip flow and Knudsen diffusion, Javadpour (2009) developed another model for gas
transport in a nano-scale cylindrical tube.
Recently, in addition to slip flow and Knudsen diffusion, more complex mechanisms such as
sorption and surface diffusion were incorporated to model gas flow in shales. For instance, Wu
et al. (2016) proposed a unified theoretical model by coupling various mechanisms including slip
flow, Knudsen diffusion, sorption, and surface diffusion. Those authors stated that “… surface dif￾fusion is an important transport mechanism, and its contribution cannot be negligible and even
dominates in nanopores with less than 2 nm in diameter.” Jia et al. (2018) found that surface dif￾fusion might increase gas flow significantly at low pore pressures (e.g. < 2000 psi) depending on the
value of surface diffusivity.
In the literature, most theoretic models developed to study gas permeability are based on the bun￾dle of tortuous capillary tubes approach. However, it is an oversimplifying idealization in which a
porous medium with actual interconnected pores is replaced with non-interconnected tortuous
tubes of equal length (Purcell 1949). An important inconsistency between the bundle of tubes
model and real porous media was noted by Fatt (1956). Fatt’s main objection to the parallel-tubes
model was that it has no connections between the individual tubes, in contrast to the network mod￾els that he developed. An additional problem is that, in a bundle-of-tubes model, individual pores
span the entire sample or problem domain, regardless of its size.
Instead of the bundle of tortuous tubes approach, one may theoretically model gas transport in
shales using more appropriate upscaling techniques e.g. percolation theory, critical path analysis
(CPA), and effective-medium approximation (EMA) from statistical physics (Ghanbarian et al.
2020; Hunt et al. 2014; Sahimi 2011). Such approaches take into account the effect of pore connec￾tivity. For example, Zhang and Scherer (2012) applied the CPA approach to estimate Klinkenberg￾corrected permeability in shales from mercury intrusion capillary pressure curve and formation
factor. They also used the Kozeny–Carman model, compared their estimations with experiments,
and found that measured permeability values matched with CPA estimations more accurately. In
another study, Ghanbarian and Javadpour (2017) assumed that slip flow and Knudsen diffusion are
dominant transport mechanisms and employed the EMA to estimate the pore pressure-dependent
gas permeability in shales. By comparing with experiments, pore-network models, and lattice￾Boltzmann simulations, they found that their proposed model estimated gas permeability within
a factor of 3 of measurements and/or simulations.
1.3 Challenges
Over the past decade, productions from unconventional reservoirs were successful in the United
States and Canada. However, there are several outstanding issues that critically impact hydrocar￾bon recovery in tight and ultra-tight formations. In the following, we discuss some notable issues
briefly.
1.3.1 Multiscale Systems
Unconventional reservoirs are extremely complex multiscale formations composed of nano- and
micro-scale pores as well as naturally and hydraulically induced fractures of various sizes. Morphol￾ogy, pore structure, and spatial/temporal heterogeneities are important, as these factors affect fluid
transport in unconventional reservoirs. Figure 1.4a and b show nano- and micro-scale pores within
organic and inorganic matrices, respectively, and Figure 1.4c shows microfractures.
1.3 Challenges 7Maximizing the production of unconventional reservoirs is limited in part by the incomplete
understanding of mass transport mechanisms in tight and ultra-tight reservoir rocks at the pore
and even molecular scale. In the literature, various approaches, such as scan electron microscopy
(Wu and Aguilera 2012), focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (Shabro et al. 2014),
atomic force microscopy (Javadpour et al. 2012; Wu and Aguilera 2012), and transmission electron
microscopy (Chalmers et al. 2012; Froute and Kovscek 2020) were extensively applied to charac￾terize the complexity and heterogeneity of pore space in unconventional reservoir rocks.
Although molecular dynamics simulations (Castez et al. 2017; Fang et al. 2017; He et al. 2020;
Huang et al. 2018; Ungerer et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2020) have been applied to gain molecular
insights of transport processes, mass transport dynamics investigations in real shale rocks are still
very limited. Characterization of mass transport dynamics in shales is of contemporary interest in
the oil and gas industry. Shales may be permeable to some hydrocarbons and impermeable to

8 1 Unconventional Reservoirsothers. Transport rates are controlled by partitioning between different phases, adsorption, and
desorption from pore surfaces, and by diffusion within nano-scale pores. These molecular-level pro￾cesses are dictated by chemical and electrostatic interactions. A better understanding of the molec￾ular mechanisms of mass transport is certain to facilitate oil and gas production.
1.3.2 Hydrocarbon Production
Another issue associated with unconventional reservoirs is that production rates rapidly decrease in
the first few years of production (Hakso and Zoback 2019; Sandrea and Sandrea 2014; Speight 2019).
Patzek et al. (2013) developed a simple but robust gas production model using basic concepts and
geometry of the extraction process. In their model, the production rate scales with time as t
−0.5 at
early times, however, declines exponentially at late times. By comparison with gas production from
8294 wells within the Barnett shale, they showed that their model provided accurate scaling of gas
production. Patzek et al. (2013) also found reasonable agreement between their theory and exper￾imental data from 2057 horizontal wells. They argued that in young wells, it would be difficult to
determine the crossover between the square-root decay and exponential decay. However, their
model was capable of determining lower and upper bounds.
More recently, Hakso and Zoback (2019) analyzed hydrocarbon production data from two oil
(Eagle Ford and Bakken) and two gas (Marcellus and Barnett) unconventional reservoirs. The aver￾age monthly data are presented in Figure 1.5 (Hakso and Zoback 2019). To eliminate uncertainties,
Hakso and Zoback (2019) removed those wells that did not produce hydrocarbon for at least two
years. Each curve shown in Figure 1.5 represents the average over more than 7500 wells from each
reservoir. As can be seen, monthly production rates decline sharply during the first two to three
years of production, consistent with the results of Patzek et al. (2013).
1.3.3 Recovery Factor
Recovery factor is the recoverable amount of hydrocarbon initially in place whose value is relatively
low for both shale gas and tight oil wells. Although it is uncertain to accurately determine the
amount of total hydrocarbon in place, the recovery factor in tight gas reservoirs is around 25% after
a few years of production (Zoback and Kohli 2019). For tight oil, various studies reported recovery
factors about 2–10% (Hamdi et al. 2018; Pankaj et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019). Low and extremely
low recovery factors for gas and oil reservoirs indicate that a considerable amount of hydrocarbon is
not produced from unconventional resources, particularly compared to conventional reservoirs.
One promising enhanced oil recovery approach to improve recovery factor is gas Huff and Puff
(Hoffman 2012, 2018). Various types of gas, such as carbon dioxide, methane, air, immiscible hydro￾carbon, and miscible hydrocarbon, were used in the gas Huff and Puss process (Firouz and Torabi
2014; Sanchez-Rivera et al. 2015; Soh and Babadagli 2018). Particularly, the CO2 Huff and Puff proc￾ess has been applied in the field for several decades. However, there still exist challenges, such as
asphaltene precipitation, corrosion, and viscous fingering, associated with field implementations
(Zhou et al. 2018). One should note that the price of oil and cost of CO2 capture and storage
may also play determinative roles.
1.3.4 Unproductive Wells
Another issue in unconventional reservoirs is that a large number of drilled wells contribute min￾imally to hydrocarbon production (Zoback and Kohli 2019). It was reported that around 30% of
shale wells were not productive (Al-Nakhli et al. 2020; Miller et al. 2011). Although unproductive

be given to produce hydrocarbon more optimally from unconventional reservoirs by drilling more
economic wells.
1.4 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we briefly reviewed several recent advances in unconventional oil and gas reser￾voirs. We noted that our knowledge of shale wettability as well as gas and liquid transport at
the pore and core levels increased in the past decade. However, there still exist challenges, such
as low hydrocarbon production and recovery factors. We also discussed that a considerable number
of drilled wells in unconventional formations are unproductive. Although various technologies
were developed to improve production, further investigations are still required to substantially
increase production rates in tight and ultra-tight reservoirs.
The major purpose of this book is to, in a systematic way, present the most recent developments
in addressing some of these technical challenges in the areas of pore-scale characterizations, core￾scale heterogeneity, and large-scale petrophysics.

2.1 Introduction
Unconventional reservoir rocks have drawn increasing attention due to the development of
advanced techniques such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, and due
to the depletion of conventional resources (Middleton et al. 2015). Unconventional reservoirs have
been successfully explored in North America and are being evaluated and produced in Europe,
Australia, and China (Weijermars 2014). To reduce uncertainties and increase the efficiency of
production related to these systems, accurate production prediction over time is necessary (Kim
et al. 2017). This is typically achieved by running large-scale fluid flow simulations on the order
of meters to kilometers using constitutive equations. They, therefore, require the input of effective
material properties, such as porosity and permeability, which characterize the formation where the
hydrocarbon production takes place. The unconventional reservoir rocks are composed of various
porous components and fractures from nano- to macro-scale. The internal micro-structure and the
macroscopic behavior are indeed strongly and directly related to each other, and properties of the
micro-porous system and their interaction with inherent fluid significantly impact the formation’s
performance. Therefore, understanding why and how the macroscopic features of the unconven￾tional reservoirs vary over space and time requires the detailed examination of the fluid flow at the
pore scale. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of these natural micro-porous media, such a
deep understanding is crucial. However, experimental measurements of fluid flow in unconven￾tional reservoirs are often difficult, expensive, and time-consuming since these reservoirs are
extremely tight with the average pore space in the matrix comparable to the mean free path of
the gas molecules. Therefore, analytical or semi-analytical models derived based on simplified
structures (Javadpour et al. 2007) and image-based pore-scale simulation techniques (Jing et al.
2020) on the scale of the material’s micro-structure have become an attractive tool to complement
direct measurements and to improve our understanding of fluid flow behavior in unconventional

method, which has been widely used to calculate the single-phase flow and transport in the con￾tinuum flow regime, has attracted increasing attention in the recent decade (Chen et al. 2014, 2022;
Wang et al. 2016a). Tremendous efforts devoted to developing its methodology or boundary treat￾ment have extended its application to simulating fluid flow and transport phenomena in uncon￾ventional reservoir rocks.
In this chapter, the physics of fluid flow in unconventional reservoir rocks is firstly introduced,
then followed by recent developments in pore-scale LB simulation methods and their applications
in fluid flow simulation of unconventional reservoir rocks.
2.2 Physics of Pore-Scale Fluid Flow in Unconventional Rocks
Due to the small pore size of unconventional reservoir rocks, the inherent fluid flow falls in differ￾ent regimes from those in conventional reservoirs. Additionally, the liquid flow is under the control
of wettability, and high content of organic matter with strong adsorption capacity would introduce
extra mass transport to the free gas flow. Therefore, a reasonable description of the physics of fluid
flow in unconventional reservoir rocks in numerical models is the prerequisite of accurate estima￾tion of hydrocarbon production. A brief introduction of fluid flow physics is described in the fol￾lowing subsections.
2.2.1 Physics of Gas Flow
2.2.1.1 Gas Slippage and Knudsen Layer Effect
Unlike conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs, abundant micro- and nano-pores with irregular geo￾metric structures coexist in unconventional reservoir rocks. Classic theories under continuum
assumptions fail to describe gas flow in these pores, and the deviations of gas flow in micropores
from that in macropores are usually characterized by the Knudsen number (Kn), which is defined
as Kn = λ/L with λ and L representing the mean free path (MFP) and the characteristic length,
respectively. Many studies have confirmed that the gas flow in micro-systems like unconventional
reservoir rocks is dynamically similar to rarefied gas flow at high altitudes at the same Kn (Beskok
and Karniadakis 1999), and according to the magnitude of Kn, the gas flow regimes can be classified
as continuum flow (Kn < 0.001), slip flow (0.001 < Kn < 0.1), transition flow (0.1 < Kn < 10), and
free molecular flow (Kn > 10). Because the pore sizes in inorganic minerals are normally less than
2 μm, and pores in kerogen are considerably smaller with sizes ranging from 2 to 50 nm, gas flow in
unconventional reservoirs falls into the slip flow (0.001 < Kn < 0.1) and early transition flow
regimes (0.1 < Kn < 1).
From slip to transition flow regimes, the rarefaction effect, as well as the Knudsen layer (KL),
which is defined as a region of local non-equilibrium with a thickness of a few MFP from the wall
start to take effect (Zhang et al. 2012). The rarefaction effect indicates that the non-zero slip velocity
at the solid boundary is noticeable, and the classic linear stress/strain-rate behavior breaks down
inside the KL. It is believed that in micro-systems, approximately 70% of the mass flow rate increase
could result from the velocity slip at the wall, and 30% of this increase is attributed to the non￾Newtonian structure of the KL (Lockerby et al. 2005). Therefore, it is essential to capture KL when
its relative thickness cannot be ignored. The typical velocity slip profile near a solid wall is shown in
Figure 2.1 (Watari 2010).
18 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock PhysicsIn the slip flow regime, the no-slip boundary condition fails to provide an agreement between
theoretical predictions and experimental results, although continuum conservation equations
can still be used to describe the bulk flow. Therefore, in this flow regime, the gas flow could be
analyzed by solving the Navier–Stokes (N–S) equation with slip boundary condition, i.e. allowing
non-zero fluid velocity near the solid wall. Various gas–solid interaction models have been pro￾posed since Maxwell in 1879 (Maxwell 1879), and the first-order or second-order slip models in
which the slip velocity is a function of λ or Kn have been mostly used. In the first-order slip model,
the slip velocity satisfies:
us = σpλ ∂us
∂n s
, 2 1
where n is the coordinate normal to the solid wall, and σp = (2 − σv)/σv is the slip coefficient with σv
being the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC).
In the second-order slip model, the slip velocity satisfies:
us = C1λ ∂us
∂n s
+ C2λ2 ∂2
us
∂n2 s
, 2 2
where C1 and C2 are the first- and second-order slip coefficients, respectively. Many methods have
been proposed to determine the slip coefficients, including but not limited to Kinetic-model based
methods, direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods, experimental measurements, etc.
In the transition flow regime, the rarefaction effect dominates the flow and the thermodynamic
equilibrium assumptions of the N–S equation begin to break down. The difficulty in analyzing the
transition flow from a continuum assumption arises from the fact that the stress–strain relationship
from the gas flow becomes nonlinear near KL. Therefore, the gas dynamic viscosity change in KL
needs to be proposed, and the effective gas viscosity in KL can be written as:
μe
KL = J × μ, 2 3
where μ is gas viscosity,Jis the modification factor, and variousJ have been proposed (see Table 3 in
Wang et al. (2016)). Among them, wall function methods or Bosanquet-type models are most

micro-channel/tube flows. Various correction functions have been proposed. Most recently,
Wang et al. (2017b) further modified the power–law (PL) based correction function proposed by
Dongari et al. (2011) and extended its application to modeling gas flow in micro-porous media
(as shown in Figure 2.2), in which the local mean free path is an average of the mean free path

It can be seen from wall function expression that μe

Alternatively, the Bosanquet-type effective viscosity is independent of the distance due to its value
averaging over the cross-section, and

where αk is a coefficient and its value changes with different micro-systems. It is observed that the
value of αk depends on the Knudsen number, and it varies slightly over the majority of the tran￾sition flow regime (Michalis et al. 2010).
2.2.1.2 Gas Adsorption/Desorption and Surface Diffusion
In addition to the free gas flow as a bulk phase in unconventional reservoir rocks, a considerable
amount of adsorbed gas exists in the organic matter and clay minerals under reservoir conditions
and therefore provides a significant portion of gas in place (GIP). As pressure declines under

20 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock Physicscontinuous reservoir depletion during production, adsorbed gas starts to desorb, leading to sustain￾able gas flow and affecting the ultimate recovery rate.
It is believed that the gas adsorption in unconventional reservoir rocks is under the control of
physical interactions of gas/solid walls, and in a situation where the potential energy barrier to dif￾fusion is smaller than the energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, an adsorbed particle may
remain mobile in a metastable phase while still being physically bound to the surface. This phe￾nomenon is known as the surface diffusion (Higashi et al. 1963). Besides, there is also a probability
that adsorbed molecules may escape from the surface before reaching thermal equilibrium with the
surface after a short time and leave prematurely at a velocity with a portion of its energy dissipated
(Levesque et al. 2013). Therefore, after the incident gas molecules collide with the solid wall, in
addition to being directly reflected, they would also be adsorbed on the surface and move in terms
of surface diffusion or escape back into the bulk gas before reaching the thermal equilibrium with
the surface.
A complete mathematical description of gas-surface interaction is under development. How￾ever, as the adsorption phase contributes to the total mass transport to a great extent in uncon￾ventional reservoir rocks, many studies have been carried out. The Langmuir model (Langmuir
1918), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model (Brunauer et al. 1938), or gas condensation the￾ory are normally adopted to model adsorbing capacity of unconventional reservoir rocks. The
Langmuir isotherm model is based on the assumption that adsorption is a mono-layer process.
It does not account for the variation of pore size and wettability of hydrocarbon in unconven￾tional reservoirs. However, it has been widely used in the literature because of its simplicity
and acceptable accuracy in modeling adsorption in micro-pores. The Langmuir isotherm curve
is illustrated in Figure 2.3.
Surface diffusion of adsorbed gas was introduced either by hopping process (Higashi et al. 1963)
or random walk statistics (Theodorou and Wei 1983), to explain the mass flow in excess of that of
the bulk phase. Krishna and Wesselingh (1997) proposed a Maxwell-Stefan approach combined
with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (which implicitly implies equilibrium), and yielded a rea￾sonable expression for the description of surface diffusion, which is confirmed by experimental
work and simulation studies (Marković et al. 2009; Moon et al. 2005). In their approach, the molar
flux of surface diffusion in a single component system can be expressed as:
Nsurface = qsat
Ds
1 − θL
∇θL, 2 7
where Ds is the Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity that can be esti￾mated from experimental studies or molecular dynamic
(MD) simulations, qsat is the Langmuir volume, and θL is
the fractional coverage of adsorbed gas which satisfies
θL = q/qsat = bP/(1 + bP) based on the Langmuir model,
where b is the Langmuir constant, P is the pressure, and
q is the surface concentration. Therefore, the surface diffu￾sion velocity usurface can be written as:
usurface = NsurfaceMads

= qsatMads

where Mads and ρads are molecular weight of adsorbed gas

2.2 Physics of Pore-Scale Fluid Flow in Unconventional Rocks 212.2.2 Physics of Water Flow
Because of the significant difference in physical properties between liquid and gas, the gas flow
mechanisms do not always apply to liquid flow in unconventional reservoir rocks. Liquid flow,
especially water flow, has also been widely investigated. The micro- to nano-scale effect can either
increase or decrease water flux compared with that obtained by no-slip Hagen-Poiseuille equation,
depending on the difference between fluid–solid interaction force and water intermolecular inter￾action force (Wu et al. 2017). The continuum model with slip length and effective viscosity is widely
used to quantitatively describe the nano-scale effect for water flow, and the slip length and effective
viscosity can be extracted by curve fitting the velocity profile obtained by molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Different fluid–solid interaction forces can induce different slip lengths and effective
viscosity. If the fluid–solid interaction force is much larger than the water intermolecular interac￾tion force, water molecules would be stuck onto the solid surface, thus water mobility near the solid
surfaces would decrease. In this situation, the no-slip boundary condition is still valid on the solid
surface and the viscosity of water near the solid surface would increase (Raviv et al. 2001). As a
result, the nano-scale effect decreases the flow rate. If the fluid–solid interaction force is much
smaller than the water intermolecular interaction force, water molecules would slip on the solid
surface and the viscosity of water near the solid surface would decrease (Barrat and Bocquet
1999). Then the nano-scale effect would increase the flow rate. The fluid–solid interaction force
can be characterized by the wettability or contact angle (θw) measured from a water droplet forming
on the walls. A small θw means strong fluid–solid interaction force while a large θw indicates weak
fluid–solid interaction force. Wu et al. (2017) established a model describing water flow in
nano-pores considering the fluid–solid interaction effect and nano-pore dimension. In their model,
the slip length is calculated as:
ls
w = C
cos θw + 1 2 , 2 9
where ls is the slip length defined as the ratio of slip velocity to the shear rate at the solid walls, C is a
constant for a certain fluid which should be fitted with experimental or MD simulation data
(C = 0.41 for water), and θw is the contact angle of water. This relationship matches well MD
simulation results for θw up to 150 (figure S1 in Wu et al. (2017)).
Affected by the fluid–solid interaction force, the viscosity of water near the solid wall would
change. Considering the interface region affected by the solid walls, the area-weighted-average
effective viscosity μe
w can be calculated by:
μe
w = μi
Ai
At
+ μ∞ 1 − Ai
At
, 2 10
where μi and Ai are the viscosity and area of water in the interface region, respectively, μ∞ is the
bulk viscosity of water in the middle of the channel, and At is the total cross-sectional area. The area
of the interface region is dependent on the thickness of the interface region, which is 0.7 nm for
water according to experiments and MD simulations (Table S1 in Wu et al. (2017)).
The viscosity of water in the interface region is also dependent on the wettability (Wu et al. 2017):
μi
μ∞
= − 0 018θw + 3 25 2 11
22 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock PhysicsIncorporating the slip length and effective viscosity, the modified N–S equation can be adopted
to describe water flow in nano-pores. However, for water flow in short channels or tubes, because
of the bending of streamlines at the entrance or exit of the channels or tubes, additional hydrody￾namic resistance can be generated by the end effect, and a complete description of fluid volume
flux in slit pores satisfies:
Q = δP
12Lμe
w
H3 + 6H2ls
+
32μe
w
πH2
, 2 12
where the first term in the denominator accounts for the flow resistance in the pore and the second
term represents the flow resistance caused by the end effect. Therefore, the end effect would become
important under two conditions: ratio of channel length to height, L/H is small or ls is very large
compared with the pore size (large θw).
2.2.3 Physics of Condensation
Phase change is a specific process of liquid–vapor multi-phase flow, which includes evaporation,
boiling and condensation (Li et al. 2016). The difference between phase change and general two￾phase flows lies in the transition from one phase to another governed by a non-ideal equation of
state. This chapter focuses on condensation phase change during which vapor turns into liquid
when over-saturated. In conventional reservoirs, condensation consists of two types, i.e. dropwise
and film condensations on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. However, condensation in
unconventional reservoirs may be quite different. Capillary condensation occurs in pores when
vapor turns into liquid phase before reaching the vapor saturation pressure (Barsotti et al.
2016). The reason is considerable van der Waals interactions between vapor molecules and solid
walls in very small pores, which is categorized as the adsorption effect of gas phase. The gas adsorp￾tion to achieve over-saturated vapor precedes its condensation on wall surface. In general, since
phase change is a specific type of two-phase flow, except for the adsorption effect, it shares the
physics of gas Knudsen layer effect and liquid–solid interaction force. If liquid is formed after
quasi-equilibrium condensation without the influence of other gas flow (such as air) and without
capillary flow in the liquid, the liquid velocity is normally small enough to be neglected. In this case,
the influence of liquid–solid interaction on liquid velocity may be negligible. Hence, the gas
slippage, Knudsen layer, and adsorption effects play an important role.
2.3 Theory of Pore-Scale Simulation Methods
2.3.1 The Isothermal Single-Phase Lattice Boltzmann Method
Historically, the LBM was derived from lattice gas automata (McNamara and Zanetti 1988). Later, it
was shown that the LB equation can also be directly derived by discretizing the Boltzmann equation
(He and Luo 1997). Shortly after its introduction, the LBM became an attractive technique to study
single/multi-phase flow and reactive transport in porous media, covering groundwater flow, fabric
materials, fuel cells, etc. Detailed pore structures obtained by FIB-SEM and micro-CT have made
the LBM a popular alternative to direct numerical solution of the N–S equation for flows in tight
rocks. Because of its kinetic nature, the LBM is, however, far more than just an N–S solver at the
pore-scale. Advances in micro electrical mechanical system (MEMS) and nanotechnology have
spurred interest in the use of the LBM for the simulation of microfluidics, and tremendous efforts
2.3 Theory of Pore-Scale Simulation Methods 23have been made in developing the LBM for micro-system. One noteworthy advance is its extension
to the simulation of gaseous flows in slip flow regime and/or early transition flow regime. In gen￾eral, the LB equation with a body force term can be written as (Guo et al. 2002):
f i x+ ciδt, t + δt − f i x, t = Ωi f i + δtFi, 2 13
where ci indicates the finite number of discrete velocities of particles, fi is the distribution function
of particles with speed ci, Ωi is the collision operator, Fi is the force term, which is defined according
to the collision operator, and δt is the time between two simulation iterations. The fluid variables
(density and velocity) are defined as:
ρ x, t =
i
f i x, t , 2 14
ρ x, t u x, t =
i
f i x, t ci + 0 5δtF, 2 15
The collision operator Ωi describes the collision behavior of particles at every lattice location,
which represents the variation of distribution functions caused by the collisions between particles.
The requirements are that they should be physically correct and efficiently computable. In the fol￾lowing, collision operators commonly used in fluid flow are presented.
2.3.1.1 Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) Collision Operator
Bhatnagar et al. (1954) proposed an efficient simplification operator to approximate the collision
term as:
Ωi f i = − τ − 1 f i − f

where τ is the relaxation time and f

(qx, qy) correspond to energy flux, (pxx, pxy) are related to the diagonal and off-diagonal components
of the stress tensors, and u and v are the components of the velocity u, respectively. Therefore, the

2.3.1.3 The Regularization Procedure
Generally, the LBM is carried out in alternate streaming and collision steps. When this dynamic
procedure is viewed as a projection of the LB equation onto the Hermite space, it introduces an
error analogous to the aliasing effect because the distribution function fi does not automatically
lie entirely within the Hermite space. Such an error is usually very small and negligible. However,
Table 2.1 Parameters of the discrete velocity models are shown in Figure 2.4.

26 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock Physicsit can be no longer neglected when the system is far from equilibrium. Therefore, a “regularization
procedure” is introduced to resolve this error and to improve the numerical stability. The procedure
is implemented as follows (Suga et al. 2010):
First, the post-streaming distribution function fi is divided into the equilibrium part f eq
i and the
non-equilibrium part f neq
i :
f i = f eq
i + f neq
i 2 25
As f eq
i already lies entirely in the subspace of Hermite space, then f neq
i needs to be converted
to a new distribution f
neq
i which lies within the subspace spanned by the higher-order Hermite
polynomials. Using the second-order Hermite polynomials, for the D2Q9 models, f

where H(2) is the second-order Hermite polynomial. By replacing f neq

The regularization procedure filters out the higher-order non-equilibrium moments that contain

2.3.2 Multi-phase Lattice Boltzmann Simulation Method
To simulate multi-phase flow, interactions among different phases should be incorporated into
the LB model. There are different ways to introduce interaction forces among different fluids,
based on which different multi-phase LB models have been developed, such as the color-gradient
model, Shan-Chen model, Free-energy model (Huang et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016), and the former
two LB models have been extended to modeling multi-phase flow in unconventional reser￾voir rocks.
2.3.2.1 Color-Gradient Model
The color-gradient LB model has been widely used to simulate immiscible two-phase flow in porous
media as the desired interfacial tension can be specified directly without any simulation test. In
addition, it can easily handle two-phase flow with large density/viscosity ratios (Liu et al. 2016).
In the two-phase color-gradient LB model, two density distribution functions are used to charac￾terize the immiscible two fluids. The multi-phase interactions are incorporated by a perturbation
operator and a recoloring operator. Then the collision operator becomes:
ΩK

generates an interfacial tension:

where AK represents the ratio of interfacial tension contributed by fluid K; Ft is the interfacial ten￾sion calculated by:

where R and B represent the red and blue fluids, respectively, and ρR0 and ρB0 are the densities of
pure red and blue fluids.

et al. 2018a).
2.3.2.2 Shan-Chen Model
Shan and Chen (1993) developed an inter-particle potential model (also known as Shan-Chen
model) through introducing microscopic interactions among nearest-neighboring particles. The
mean field force is incorporated by adding an additional force term in the collision operator,
and this force ensures phase separation and introduces interfacial tension. The Shan-Chen model
has become very popular due to its simplicity and versatility. Different non-ideal equations of state
(Yuan and Schaefer 2006) can be easily incorporated into the Shan-Chen model to simulate multi￾phase flow and phase change problems. The evolution equation of MRT-LB single component
multi-phase Shan-Chen model can be written as (Guo and Zheng 2008):
f i x + ciδt, t + δt − f i x, t = Ωij f j + Fi, 2 35

2.3.3 Capture Fluid Slippage at the Solid Boundary
In traditional fluid mechanics, the no-slip condition is used at the solid boundary and breaks down
on micro- and nano-scales. Generally, the interfacial slip is generated by hydrophobicity in liquid
flow and by rarefaction effect for gas flow. To capture the fluid slippage at the solid boundary, var￾ious slip boundary conditions have been adopted to implicitly consider the solid–fluid interaction.
Among them, the three mostly adopted combined boundary forms are:
the combined specular with diffusive reflection boundary condition (MR) (Guo et al. 2006)
f i x = 1 − Cmr f sr
i x + Cmrf dr
i x , 2 40
the combined bounce-back with specular reflection boundary condition (BR) (Guo et al. 2006)
f i x = 1 − Cbr f sr

et al. 2009)
f i x = 1 − Cmb f bb
i x + Cmbf dr
i x 2 42
In these three forms, f bb
i x , f sr
i x , and f dr
i x represent bounce back, specular reflection, and
Maxwellian diffuse reflection distribution functions, respectively. Cmr, Cbr, and Cmb are combina￾tion coefficients in corresponding boundary conditions. Historically, there is no consensus on how
to choose combination coefficients. Recent studies indicate that the combination coefficients can be
obtained by matching the slip velocity of LB model and the analytical solution of N–S equation with
Maxwellian slip boundary condition. Therefore, the combination coefficients are functions of the
TMAC for gas slip flow and contact angle θw for water flow, which would be inferred from exper￾imental results or molecular simulations.
2.3.4 Capture the Knudsen Layer/Effective Viscosity
To implement water-effective viscosity in the LB model is quite straightforward. By simply repla￾cing μ with μe
w to calculate relaxation times, the change of viscosity could be taken into account. To
capture KL for gas flow with an effective viscosity model, a reasonable relationship between λ and
viscosity needs to be applied. According to gas kinetic theory, the hard-sphere model can be adopted
to calculate the μ and λ relationship:
μ
ρ = λ
2RgT
π , 2 43
where Rg is the specific gas constant and T is temperature. For dilute gas, the above equation can be
written as:
μ
ρ = 5λ
16
2πkT
mg
, 2 44
where k is the Boltzmann constant and mg is the gas molecular mass. With these functions, relax￾ation times could be easily estimated at different λ or Kn, and KL effect can be reflected in the LB
model by replacing μ with μe
KL using the wall function or Bosanquet-type approach as shown in
Section 2.2.1.
2.3.5 Capture the Adsorption/Desorption and Surface Diffusion Effects
2.3.5.1 Modeling of Adsorption in LBM
The adsorption in unconventional reservoir rocks is normally considered as a kind of physical
adsorption caused by the strong interaction forces between solids and gas. Therefore, an interaction
force between solid and gas particles could be introduced in LB models to model adsorption (Martys
and Chen 1996):
Fs x, t = − Gsψ x, t
8
i = 1
Siωiψs x + ciδt, t ci, 2 45
where Fs is the interaction force between solids and gas particles, Gs is a parameter that controls
the interaction strength between solids and gas particles, Si is a Boolean variable, which equals 1 if
the node in a direction is solid node and 0 otherwise, and ψs is the potential function of solids and
depends on ρs. So, Fs can be changed by changing Gs or ρs. It should be mentioned that ρs is not the
30 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock Physicsreal solid’s density but an adsorption parameter reflecting the solid’s potential. For a given system,
the key issue of adopting LBM to simulate gas adsorption accurately is to obtain the accurate Fs.
Zhao et al. (2016) proposed a novel process to estimate Fs by matching the simulation results of
LBM and molecular simulations, and the general process is implemented as follows:
1) Applying molecular simulations e.g. the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) to simulate gas
adsorption in a certain porous medium and obtain the adsorption curve.
2) Applying LBM to do the same simulation under the same conditions. By matching the simula￾tion results of LBM and the adsorption curve obtained by molecular simulation, the adsorption
parameter ρs in the LB model can be obtained under different conditions.
3) The regression curve between the adsorption parameter ρs and bulk density can be obtained,
and this curve is introduced into the micro-scale LB model.
By doing so the adsorption parameters in LBM are determined by molecular simulation. It is
worth mentioning that Lubbers et al. (2020) have built a Machine Learning (ML) surrogate model
that captures adsorption effects across a wide range of parameter space and bridges the MD and
LBM scales using a relatively small number of MD calculations. The surrogate model is seven orders
of magnitude faster than MD simulations.
2.3.5.2 Modeling of Surface Diffusion Via LBM
In addition to adsorption/desorption of adsorbed gas, to capture the surface diffusion, inspired by
the work of Levesque et al. and their co-workers (Vanson et al. 2015), Wang et al. (2017a) proposed a
similar propagation scheme by introducing a surface diffusion to the slip boundary condition (as
shown in Figure 2.5).
In this boundary condition, the surface diffusion of the adsorbed gas follows the Maxwell-Stefan
approach, and the streamwise surface diffusion velocity can be calculated with usurface shown in
Section 2.2.1.2, and the distribution function of fluid boundary nodes is defined as:

is the “post-desorption distribution function” and is a function of the surface diffusion velocity

i is the reflected distribution function contributed from the free gas and can be modeled
with combined forms in modeling gas slippage near the solid wall. For the calculation of f des
i , the
boundary condition proposed by Inamuro et al. (1995) can be used, in which f des
i is assumed to be
the equilibrium distribution function with a counter slip velocity to ensure the gas at the fluid
boundary has the velocity usurface and the density ρ.
2.4 Applications
In the above sections, the fundamentals of fluid flow physics and LB method for fluid flow have
been briefly summarized. In this section, some representative applications of the LB methods in
modeling fluid flow in unconventional reservoir rocks are presented.
2.4.1 Simulation of Gas Flow in Unconventional Reservoir Rocks
2.4.1.1 Gas Slippage
In spite of the tremendous efforts, modeling of gas flow in micro-porous media on pore-scale still
remains a challenge. To clarify effects of rarefaction and pore configuration on gas flow in uncon￾ventional reservoir rocks (Wang et al. 2017b) proposed a regularized multiple-relaxation-time
(MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model to analyze gas flow in 2-dimensional (2D) micro-porous
medium reconstructed by quartet structure generation set (QSGS) on pore-scale. A 4-CCL algo￾rithm is also applied to remove the dead pores generated by QSGS, and the structure (100 × 400
lattices) used for analysis is illustrated in Figure 2.6.
In this study, MR boundary condition is applied for modeling gas slippage, and to match the sec￾ond-order slip boundary condition, the following combination factor Cmr and relaxation time τq are
applied:

To clarify the influence of rarefaction on gas flow, the methane flow in pore structure shown in
Figure 2.6 at fixed outlet pressures of 10, 30, and 50 MPa and a constant pressure gradient ∇P = 0.1
MPa/m are discussed. The velocity vector distribution of methane and the corresponding gas appar￾ent permeability at different pressures are presented in Figure 2.7.
As shown in the figure, rarefaction is evident for gas flow in micro-porous media as the gas mole￾cules collide with the solid surface more frequently. The results show that the apparent permeabil￾ity of methane is not constant with pressure or Kn and increases by a factor around 2 with decreased
pressure for current study. Specifically, it takes values ranging from 0.95 mD for outlet pressure of
50 MPa to 1.89 mD for outlet pressure of 10 MPa. This phenomenon is well explained by the chan￾ged velocity field. Given that rarefaction dominates gas flow in small pore and/or at low pressures,
decreasing pressure gives rise to a higher bulk velocity, especially for flow through narrow pore
throats or locations near the outlet with a low pressure, and finally, it leads to an increased apparent
permeability.
2.4.1.2 Gas Adsorption
The effect of gas adsorption on gas flow in unconventional reservoir rocks such as organic shale was
analyzed by Zhao et al. (2016). The interaction forces between solids and adsorbed gas particles are
introduced, and GCMC is applied to obtain the input parameters related to gas adsorption for LB
model. Following the procedure illustrated in Section 2.3.5.1. GCMC is firstly applied to simulate
the adsorption isotherm of methane (Figure 2.8a), followed by an LB simulation under the same

and regression curve (Figure 2.8b and c).
The structure model in this study is shown in Figure 2.9,
and the gas is produced by the only outlet (inlet) at the bot￾tom of the porous medium.
The gas density distributions at different pressures are
shown in Figure 2.10. It can be seen that a layer of adsorbed
gas with high density would form near the organic matter
under the adsorption force. By calculating the densities of dif￾ferent types of gas at different pressures, it can be concluded
that the total gas density in the whole inorganic matter is
always lower than that in organic matter, which means that
the organic matter stores more gas than the inorganic matter
(Figure 2.11a). Additionally, the bulk gas densities are almost
the same in the two types of porous media at different pres￾sures, while the adsorbed gas in organic matter is much
higher than that in inorganic matter, especially when the
pressure is low. Therefore, the total gas density in the whole
pores increases in the organic matter (Figure 2.11b and c).
2.4.1.3 Surface Diffusion of Adsorbed Gas
In order to qualify the influence of adsorbed gas and its sur￾face diffusion on micro-gaseous flow, the normalized streamwise velocity distribution of the free
gas at different adsorbed gas fractional coverage θads and surface diffusion velocity usurface are ana￾lyzed by (Wang et al. 2017a). The boundary condition explained in Section 2.3.5.2 is implemented
with an MRT-LB model. As shown in Figure 2.12, when θads = 0, the variation of usurface does not
influence the gas flow because there is no adsorbed gas in the system (Figure 2.12a). The gas slip at
the solid surface is controlled by the interaction of free gas molecules with solid molecules and the
rarefaction dominates the flow, which leads to a large slip velocity at the boundary. When θads = 1,
the slip velocity of the free gas at the solid surface is completely determined by the desorbed gas, and
it vanishes to zero at usurface = 0 (Figure 2.12d). This result indicates that the gas flow in confined
micro-channel manifests a parabolic velocity profile with zero slip velocity at the solid surface when
an immobile adsorption layer is formed, and the slip model based on kinetic theory (Karniadakis et al.
2006) fails to capture the flow behavior. When the solid surface is partially covered by an amount of
adsorbed gas, the slippage of the free gas is determined by the interactions with both solid wall and the
adsorbed gas, and the “dynamic similarity” of rarefied gas flow and micro-scale confined flow breaks
down. At a certain coverage, the gas slip at the wall decreases with the decreased usurface as a result of
the premature short-time desorption of adsorbed gas (Figure 2.12b and c). Comparing different
sub-figures in Figure 2.12, one can see that when usurface = us, the increase with coverage does not
influence the slip velocity. Otherwise, the slip of the free gas is decreased with the increase of adsorbed
gas coverage θads at a certain usurface.
2.4.2 Simulation of Water Flow in Unconventional Reservoir Rocks
The water flow in unconventional reservoir rock was investigated by Zhao et al. (2018b). In their
study, BR slip boundary is applied with MRT-LB model, and the first-order slip boundary condition
is used to calculate the slip coefficient. Therefore,

hydrophilic and strong hydrophobic conditions.
The distribution of dimensionless velocity in y direction across slice Y = 400 is shown in
Figure 2.14, and the velocity distribution is illustrated in Figure 2.15. As can be seen from
Figure 2.14, the slip effect has a significant influence on liquid flow on micro-scale. For the hydro￾philic porous medium, because of the strong fluid–solid interaction, the fluid prefers to stick on the

38 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock Physicssolid surface. This increases the fluid viscosity near the
solid surface and decreases the flow velocity. For the
hydrophobic porous medium, because of the repulsive
solid surface, the slip velocity occurs on the solid sur￾face, and the fluid viscosity near the solid surface
decreases, which significantly increases the flow veloc￾ity. Figure 2.15 qualitatively shows the dimensionless
velocity distributions in different porous media.
Although the water flow velocity in hydrophilic porous
medium is much smaller than that without considering
the nano-scale effect (as shown in Figure 2.14), the rel￾ative velocity distributions are similar. However, for the
strong hydrophobic porous medium, the velocity distri￾bution is quite different. From Figure 2.15, it can be
seen that the dimensionless velocities in small pores
are higher, and the velocity distribution is more uni￾form compared with the other two cases.
2.4.3 Simulation of Immiscible Two-Phase Flow
The color-gradient LB model introduced in Section 2.3.2.1 is applied to simulate spontaneous imbi￾bition of water in a straight nano-channel and a nano-porous medium shown in Figure 2.16a. In
these simulations, the slip boundary condition and effective viscosity caused by nano-pore confine￾ment effect are considered in both phases (Zhao et al. 2018b). For the water phase, the interface
region around the solid surface affected by the fluid–solid interaction is explicitly considered. As
shown in Figure 2.16b, the red color represents the interface region with viscosity μi and blue color
represents the bulk region with viscosity μ∞. For the octane phase, the local effective viscosity (μo
e)
dependent on local pore size (H) is considered, as shown in Figure 2.16c, which can be calculated by

In all the simulations, the water-octane-quartz three-phase contact angle θwo was 29 and water
was the wetting phase. The water contact angle θw used to characterize the water-solid interaction

imbibition in a straight nano-channel with 20 lattices width and 1000 lattices length. The resolution
was 0.1 nm/lattice; therefore, the pore size was 2 nm in physical unit. The theoretical solution for
the spontaneous imbibition in a 2D straight nano-channel is shown below:

shown in Figure 2.17a under different conditions in lattice units. The “intrinsic” means the results
without considering nano-scale effect. At the initial stage of imbibition process, the nano-scale
effect enhances the imbibition velocity of water under different θw. This is because imbibition

2.4 Applications 41in the initial stage is dominated by the non-wetting octane phase, which flows faster under the
nano-scale effect. With the increase of lw, the influence of the wetting phase becomes more signif￾icant. Under different θw, the imbibition dynamics show different trends. For a weak water-solid
interaction force (θw = 120 ), the nano-scale effect enhances the water flow ability. Therefore, the
imbibition of water is always faster compared to the intrinsic case, as shown by the green curve. We
note that this θw may not exist for the water–quartz system, and this is a theoretical analysis. For the
neural (θw = 60 ) and strong (θw = 0 ) water-solid interaction forces, the nano-scale effect reduces
the water flow ability in nano-channel. As a result, the imbibition process becomes slower with lw.
Under a certain imbibition length, the overall imbibition time considering nano-scale effect may
exceed the intrinsic case, as shown by the crossover of red curve and black curve. In all these cases,
the LBM simulation results match well with the theoretical solutions, demonstrating the accuracy
of the proposed LB model.

42 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock PhysicsThen the proposed LB model is used to simulate spontaneous imbibition of water in an octane￾saturated nano-porous medium, as shown in Figure 2.16a. The simulation domain is 720 × 480 lat￾tice2 with a resolution of 0.1 nm/lattice and the mean pore size is 20 lattices. At the initial condition,
a small amount of water phase is placed at the left of the domain, as shown in Figure 2.18a. The
simulation stops when the water phase reaches the right outlet boundary. Three conditions are con￾sidered: intrinsic, θw = 60 and θw = 0 . The obtained water saturation as a function of simulation
time is shown in Figure 2.17b. As can be seen, the imbibition in a nano-porous medium shows sim￾ilar trends with that in a straight nano-channel, which implies similar underlying flow mechan￾isms. In Figure 2.18b–g, we further compare the phase distributions under different conditions.
Figure 2.18b–d show the phase distributions when the water saturation is around 0.5 and
Figure 2.18e–g show the final phase distributions when the water phase breakthroughs the outlet.
From left to right, the figures correspond to the intrinsic situation, θw = 0 and θw = 60 , respec￾tively. As can be seen, the displacement efficiency of water phase is very high due to the capillary
valve effect. The nano-scale effect has some influence on the phase distribution, even for this simple
geometry. We observe trapped non-wetting bubbles in different positions of the porous medium
under different conditions. For the cases considering nano-scale effect (θw = 60 and θw = 0 ),
as the water-solid interaction force increases the interface viscosity of water, the displacement front
of water phase becomes more compact. As a result, the final displacement efficiency considering
nano-scale effect is higher than the intrinsic case, as shown in Figure 2.18e–g.
2.4.4 Simulation of Vapor Condensation
The work presented in this subsection was performed by the authors of this chapter and has not
been published elsewhere. During methane gas production, vapor condensation may occur when
pressure changes, which in turn influences gas production. In addition, the nano-scale confinement
may affect gas condensation. To simulate the condensation phenomenon at the pore scale, the
Shan-Chen model introduced in Section 2.3.2.2 was applied. The original Shan-Chen model devel￾oped to simulate multi-phase flow is more suitable for conventional reservoir rocks. To correctly
simulate the phase change problems in unconventional reservoir, the effects of gas slippage,

2.4 Applications 43effective viscosity, and gas adsorption have to be considered. To realize the gas slippage effect, the
combined bounce-back/specular-reflection boundary condition (BR) introduced in Section 2.3.3
was used at the solid surface. The details for choosing free parameter Cbr can be found in Li
et al. (2011). To capture the Knudsen layer and gas denseness effects, the effective relaxation time
is expressed as (Zhao et al. 2018b):

And the method introduced in Section 2.3.5.1 is applied for modeling gas adsorption.
2.4.4.1 Model Validations
Since the phase change problem in unconventional reservoir is not well studied, a single validation
case considering all the physics is difficult to conduct. Therefore, the model proposed here was vali￾dated in two sub-steps, i.e. first by a single-phase slip flow to validate the gas slippage and effective
viscosity effects and followed by droplet evaporation to validate phase change.
The slip flow considering gas slippage and effective viscosity was validated by simulating gas flow
in a periodic microchannel. A constant pressure gradient was implemented between left and right
sides of a channel with fixed height. The size of computational domain is L × H = 240 × 60 lattices2
and the pressure gradient is implemented by external force G = − ∂p
∂x
, 0 = 10 − 6, 0 in lattice
units. Two cases with Knudsen numbers Kn = 0.1128, 2.2568 are studied. The obtained velocity
profile against channel height is shown in Figure 2.19, where U = u u and u = 1 H H
0 udy. It is
observed that higher Kn leads to higher slip velocity at the wall surface. Present simulation results
agree well with that from Ohwada et al. (1998) and Li et al. (2011), showing the accuracy of current
implementation. It is noted that the results from Ohwada et al. (1998) under-estimate the slip veloc￾ity at the wall surface to a small extent.
The phase change is validated by evaporation of a suspended droplet. In current simulation, the
domain size is L × H = 180 × 180 lattices2
. A droplet with initial diameter of D0 = 98 lattices is
placed in the center of the domain and the four boundaries are set at constant pressure lower than
saturation pressure to induce evaporation. A liquid–vapor density ratio of ρl/ρv ≈ 30 is used at the
temperature ratio of T/Tc = 0.75. Under quasi-isothermal condition, the droplet diameter square
should decrease linearly with time. As shown in Figure 2.20, the decrease of droplet diameter
square generally follows the linear line. At the end of evaporation, the evaporation rate is a little
under-estimated. The reason might be the heat transfer and its influence on evaporation rate is not
considered (Qin et al. 2019). Overall, the accuracy of model is acceptable for studying phase change
problem qualitatively.
2.4.4.2 Vapor Condensation in Two Adjacent Nano-Pores
Similar to the validation case, a liquid–vapor density ratio of ρl/ρv ≈ 30 was used at the temperature
ratio of T/Tc = 0.75. The simulation domain is shown in Figure 2.21, where the left-hand side is the
44 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock Physicsvapor inlet with a constant pressure slightly higher than the saturation vapor pressure to trigger
condensation. The two pores are of the same length, but with a width ratio of 2, and Kn = 1.0,
2.0 for the large and small pores, respectively. In current simulations, the virtual solid density
ρvs = 0.54ρl is adopted, to realize a liquid–vapor-solid contact angle of around θlw = 60 . As
explained in Section 2.3, ρvs also plays the role of the gas adsorption parameter ρad to achieve vapor
adsorption at the wall. To demonstrate the influence of gas slippage in condensation in nano-pores,
simulation results obtained with and without gas slippage effect are compared, while the Knudsen
layer and adsorption effects are kept the same. According to current simulation setup, the liquid
formed after vapor condensation is at quasi-equilibrium state with its velocity around zero. Thus,
the flow in vapor phase is mainly analyzed.
The vapor condensation process of two cases is compared in Figure 2.22, with (a) showing the
result considering gas slippage while (b) showing that using no-slip boundary condition. For the

2.4 Applications 45left and right columns, the liquid saturation in the large pore (Sl) is kept almost the same. For both
cases, a layer of dense vapor is observed at the solid surface at t = 10,000 iterations before conden￾sation starts. As time goes by, the vapor starts to condensate at the corners of the large pores. After
some time, the liquid also forms at the corner of small pores at t = 110,000 and 140,000 iterations,
respectively. At this stage, the condensed liquid is in partial-droplet shape with convex interfaces.
Later at t = 220,000 and 360,000 iterations, the small convex interfaces merge into concave ones,
after enough amount of liquid is formed by condensation. At t = 920,000 and 1,330,000 iterations,
the large pores in both cases are almost fully filled with liquid, while the small pores are only par￾tially filled, indicating the condensation is faster in large pores. According to Figure 2.22, the con￾densation processes of the two cases are qualitatively similar. However, the amount of liquid
against time during condensation shows a significant difference. To reach the same liquid satura￾tion in large pore, the condensation time considering gas slippage (Figure 2.22a) is shorter than that
using no-slip boundary condition (Figure 2.22b). Moreover, at the same saturation of large pore (Sl),
the saturation of small pore (Ss) is higher when considering gas slippage effect. Both observations
indicate the vapor condensation rate is generally higher when considering gas slippage effect.

slice of the computational domain between the two cases at Sl ≈ 19.7% (t = 220,000 and 360,000
iterations in Figure 2.22a and b) is compared, since the vapor velocity determines the condensation
rate. As shown in Figure 2.23a, the vapor velocity considering gas slippage is always larger than that
using no-slip boundary. The ratios of slippage velocity to maximum velocity for large and small
pores are 15.6% and 22.4%, respectively. The ratio in the small pore is larger because of the higher
Kn. The velocity profile is not in a typical parabolic shape near the wall, due to the influence of
dense vapor formed (gas adsorption). As shown in Figure 2.23b, the vapor density near the wall
is about eight times that in the center of the pore. The adoption considering gas slippage and using
no-slip boundaries are very close to each other. The maximum vapor density in large pores is

during the condensation process between two cases is compared, to quantitatively compare the
average condensation rate. Figure 2.24 shows that with the given Kn, when considering gas slip￾page, the condensation rate in large and small pores are about 45.1 and 100.1% higher than those
using no-slip boundary. Compared with that in small pores, the condensation rate in large pores in
the two cases are about 40.9 and 98.5% higher. The condensation rate in small pore considering gas
slippage is even 15.4% higher than that in large pore using no-slip boundary, indicating the signif￾icant influence of gas slippage.

48 2 Pore-Scale Simulations and Digital Rock Physics1) Fluid flow in unconventional reservoirs presents very different behavior from those in conven￾tional gas reservoirs. High Kn, high total organic content, complex structure, mix wettability,
etc., all could introduce more complicated flow patterns.
2) With the scarcity of experimental data, pore-scale simulations can be essential tools to reveal the
unique flow characteristics in unconventional gas reservoirs. Pore-scale LB models have been
successfully extended to modeling single/multi-phase flow and phase change in unconventional
gas reservoirs through modification of boundary conditions, collision operators, or force terms.
Current simulations indicate that when the pore size is small enough, slippage appears at the
solid interface for both liquid and gas flows and thus results in a faster flow rate and a higher
condensation rate, although these effects could be diminished by wettability change or adsorp￾tion. Also, surface diffusion of adsorbed gas could provide additional mass flow for gas flow in
unconventional gas reservoirs.
3) Although pore-scale simulations have been widely applied to study fluid flow in unconventional
reservoirs, it should be noted that phenomenological models or physical approaches are usually
introduced in these models, and therefore significant challenges remain to provide accurate pre￾dictions of fluid flow in complex porous media at nano- to micro-scales. Further development of
specified pore-scale experiments on unconventional gas reservoirs will be useful to validate cur￾rent numerical models.

3.1 Introduction
Digital rock physics (DRP), as an emerging computational simulation technique in recent years, is not
only used for the characterization of pore systems and simulation of acoustic and electrical properties
(Andrä et al. 2013; Blunt et al. 2013; Karimpouli and Tahmasebi 2016, 2019a; Sahimi 2011; Wu et al.
2019a; Wu et al. 2020c), but are also widely used for simulation of fluid flow, mass transport and
understanding of pore-scale mechanisms of An et al. (2020), Bultreys et al. (2016), Karimpouli
and Tahmasebi (2016, 2019c), Tahmasebi et al. (2020a), Xia et al. (2019), Zhu et al. (2019), and
Wu et al. (2022a). Compared to conventional laboratory experiments, DRP embraces many advan￾tages (Blunt 2017; Bultreys et al. 2016; Fagbemi et al. 2018; Munawar et al. 2018; Tahmasebi et al.
2020a; Wu et al. 2019b, d). Firstly, DRP can ensure that valuable digital information of the cores
can be permanently stored and reused in the future (Andrä et al. 2013; Lin et al. 2018). Secondly,
the traditional physical experiments, such as the mercury injection capillary pressure experiment,
may damage the rock, so the used sample cannot be utilized for other experiments (Golparvar
et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2019). DRP is a non-destructive method that uses numerical simulation to
compute all physical and chemical processes on digital rock models (Wu et al. 2022b). Thirdly,
DRP is capable of changing the proportions of minerals and pores in the digital core and investigating
how each component affects the petrophysical properties (Yang et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2020d). Thus,
due to the above-mentioned reasons, DRP has become a game-changer in rock physics.
The first step of DRP is to construct an accurate digital model. Thanks to the recent advances in
imaging techniques and computational methods, plenty of modeling methods have been proposed
to build such models (Gerke et al. 2015; Lemmens et al. 2019; Mosser et al. 2017; Tahmasebi et al.
2020a; Wu et al. 2019c; Yang et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2019). Among such methods, some are developed
to generate simple porous media with single-scale pore systems in conventional reservoirs, while
others construct heterogeneous digital rocks with multiscale pore structures in unconventional
reservoirs. Compared to the former, the latter involves micro- and nano-meter pores, and it presents
more complex structures. Therefore, modeling methods for conventional and unconventional res￾ervoir rocks are different. This chapter aims to review these methods of digital rocks. The benefits
and drawbacks of these methods are also discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and future devel￾opment paths of the modeling methods are presented as well.

© 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2023 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.3.2 Single-Scale Modeling of Digital Rocks
Conventional reservoir rocks usually involve micrometer pores and single-scale structures, which
require using single-scale modeling methods. Such techniques can be divided into two groups of
experimental and computational methods, as discussed in detail in the following (Blunt et al.
2013; Tahmasebi and Sahimi 2012; Zhu et al. 2019).
3.2.1 Experimental Techniques
Techniques in this group usually scan or continuously photograph samples using experimental
equipment to obtain multiple two-dimensional (2D) slices of the core and then superimpose the
2D slices to construct a three-dimensional (3D) digital core. It mainly includes the imaging tech￾nique of serial sectioning (Chawla et al. 2006), laser scanning confocal microscopy (Shah et al.
2017), and X-Ray computer tomography scanning technique (Munawar et al. 2018; Tahmasebi
et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2019b; Zhang et al. 2020).
3.2.1.1 Imaging Technique of Serial Sectioning
The workflow of the imaging technique of serial sectioning is cumbersome. It contains cutting, pol￾ishing, and imaging of a sample. These steps should be repeated until enough 2D sections are
obtained. Finally, a 3D digital model can be produced by superimposing these slices (Chawla
et al. 2006). This technique was invented by Lymberopoulos and Payatakes (1992), who analyzed
the characteristics of pore structures of rocks. In order to enhance the quality and contrast of the
images, they injected a dye into the sample, then cut the sample with a microtome, and used
the vernier on the microtome to ensure the thickness of the sample was the same every time. Then
the sample was polished and photographed with a high-resolution microscope. After photograph￾ing, the sample was cut and polished again until a certain number of slices were obtained, and
finally, a 3D digital core was obtained through image superposition (Lymberopoulos and Payatakes
1992). Vogel and Roth (2001) used this method to study the pore structures of soil. They put clean
soil samples in polyester resin to improve the quality of shooting. After processing, samples were
cut and polished, and then a digital camera was used to photograph samples, and they finally super￾imposed 2D pictures to construct the 3D digital model of soils (Vogel and Roth 2001).
At present, the combination of imaging techniques of serial sectioning and focused ion beam
(FIB), namely FIB-SEM, is widely used in the construction of digital cores for tight reservoirs.
The advantage of the imaging technique of serial sectioning is that it can obtain high-resolution
rock pictures, but it usually spends a long time to obtain a lot of 2D images. Moreover, the captured
area of such images may be small, and samples will be demolished in the process of cutting.
3.2.1.2 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy
Initially, laser scanning confocal microscopy was used for observing cell structures. Minsky (1988)
first proposed the technique and clarified the basic work principle of laser scanning confocal
microscopy (Minsky 1988). This technology uses a laser light as the illumination source, puts
two pinholes in front of the light source and the detector, and places a dichroic mirror on the path
of light propagation; this mirror reflects the light from the source. When the reflected light reaches
the surface of an object, it propagates to the detector after reflection. The detector then receives the
light with an intensity, which is converted into an electrical signal and sent to a computer. After
some processing, a 3D image with a certain thickness can be obtained. In order to improve the
54 3 Digital Rock Modelingimaging quality, a core should be immersed in a low-viscosity epoxy resin intercalated with fluo￾rescent substances as Fredrich (1999) proposed to construct 3D digital cores (Fredrich 1999). After
the epoxy resin was completely penetrated into a rock sample, the 3D pore structure can be
acquired. Some researchers used laser scanning confocal microscopy to construct 3D digital models
of carbonate and shales (Kus 2015; Shah et al. 2017). Due to the limitation of the experiment instru￾ment, this technique cannot meet the requirements of high resolution and large field of view at the
same time. Therefore, the constructed digital rock by this technique would be single-scale, not
multiscale.
3.2.1.3 X-Ray Computed Tomography Scanning
In 1967, Hounsfield invented the first computed tomography (CT) scanning machine (Dmytriw
2012), which was later applied in the medical field. In the 1980s, this technology was used for soil
and rock. With the advances in CT instruments, X-ray CT scanners have become the most widely
used technique to build 3D digital rocks (Cnudde and Boone, 2013; Wildenschild and Sheppard
2013; Wu et al. 2020a). This technique uses an X-ray as the ray source, which is absorbed by materi￾als and its intensity attenuates when the X-ray passes through a rock sample. The attenuated X-ray
intensity would be different depending on the materials in a sample. Then a certain reconstruction
algorithm is used to convert the detected ray intensity into the gray value in an image, and next the
gray value is related to the density of minerals. After processing, one can acquire the digital rock. To
date, the fast development of CT machines has improved the speed of scanning samples. The CT
instrument has been used to monitor the dynamic processes inside the samples (Bultreys et al.
2016), such as fluid flow in porous media (Berg et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2020a,
2020c), dissolution of minerals (Menke et al. 2018), pore-system evolution with the temperature
(Saif et al. 2019). Thus, it is an excellent tool to construct static and dynamic digital rocks.
The commonly used CT scanners can get images of 10003
–20003 voxels, and the resolution can be
micrometers or nanometers (Bultreys et al. 2016). Compared with the first two experimental meth￾ods, this technique can build 3D digital cores with higher resolution and larger size and is the most
accurate experimental method for building digital rocks of conventional reservoirs. Also, the X-ray
CT scanning method does not damage the utilized samples. Nevertheless, the technique is not suit￾able for constructing 3D digital cores with micro- and nano-meter pores since it has to make a bal￾ance between the high resolution and large field of view.
3.2.2 Computational Methods
Compared to experimental techniques, computational methods reconstruct 3D digital cores using
some algorithms based on 2D images, for example, SEM images or thin sections. This group
includes the truncated Gaussian random field method (Yeong and Torquato 1998), phase recovery
algorithm (Fullwood et al. 2008; Hasanabadi et al. 2016), simulated annealing method (Eschricht
et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2018), Markov chain Monte Carlo method (Wu et al. 2006), sequential indi￾cator simulation method (Keehm et al. 2004), multiple-point statistics method (Okabe and Blunt
2005; Tahmasebi and Sahimi 2012, 2013), quartet structure generation set method (Chen et al. 2015;
Wang et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2020c), deep learning method (Feng et al. 2018b), and process-based
method (Bakke and Øren 1997), etc. The cost of these techniques is quite low, and the modeling
speed is fast, so these methods are quite popular. The truncated Gaussian random field method and
phase recovery algorithm are currently less used. Thus, in the following, we put the focus on the
other methods.
3.2 Single-Scale Modeling of Digital Rocks 553.2.2.1 Simulated Annealing
The simulated annealing method was initially proposed to solve global optimization problems
(Metropolis et al. 1953). In 1995, Hazlett used this method to reconstruct 3D digital cores of Berea
sandstones (Hazlett 1995). Afterward, it has been widely applied to the reconstruction of 3D porous
media (Gerke et al. 2015; Hamzehpour et al. 2007; Jiao et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2009; Manwart and
Hilfer 1999; Talukdar et al. 2002; Yeong and Torquato 1998). The modeling process of simulated
annealing is similar to the annealing and cooling process of metals, and the simulation aims to
transform a high “energy” system composed of disordered particles and pores into an ordered
low “energy” system (Jiao et al. 2009). As to the workflow of the method, first, a simulation field
is considered with a grid size, for example, N3
, and start random simulation under the constraints of
porosity and autocorrelation function (both obtained from 2D images). For each iteration, a pore
voxel and a particle voxel are exchanged, and this exchange slightly changes the simulation func￾tion, so the energy of the system also changes. When the simulation result meets the requirements
of constraint conditions, the simulation ends.
If only low-order correlation functions (e.g. porosity or autocorrelation function) are taken as
constraints, it would be difficult to accurately generate complex structures in porous media. In
order to solve this issue, different additional constraints are introduced, such as pore size distribu￾tion (Eschricht et al. 2005), linear path function, two-point cluster correlation function (Karsanina
et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2007), fractal system control function (Ju et al. 2014), and co-occurrence cor￾relation function (Feng et al. 2018b). These constraints improve the accuracy of modeling, but the
cost of modeling increases. The simulated annealing method has better modeling accuracy than the
truncated Gaussian random field method, but it is still not suitable for generating digital rocks of
heterogeneous porous media.
3.2.2.2 Markov Chain Monte Carlo
The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method originates from the Markov random fields. The Markov
random fields can predict unknown global image features based on small images because it theo￾retically considers the correlation of a few pixels and several descriptors of global features (Geman
and Geman 1984). Thus, unknown features can be determined from the given prior images. The
original algorithm only updated one unknown pixel at a time, which limits the simulation speed.
Wu et al. (2004) improved the method to predict a line of unknown pixels and then used it to recon￾struct 2D images based on 2D thin sections of soil samples (Wu et al. 2004). Wu et al. (2006)
extended their algorithm to 3D reconstruction based on 2D images. They added a multiple-voxel
interaction scheme into the method to create the 3D reconstruction, which can reduce the simu￾lation time. When predicting an unknown voxel in a one-dimensional (1D) simulation, the adjacent
two- and three-neighborhoods are taken as the conditioning data. Then, the first row can be gen￾erated after which the reconstruction of unknown voxels in the second row can be evaluated under
the constraints of the three- and four-neighborhoods. Next, the values of all the voxels in the first
layer can be predicted row-by-row. When it comes to the pixels in the second layer, more known
voxels can be taken into consideration. Finally, all the voxels can be assigned to void or solid.
Although Wu et al. (2006) generated several 3D heterogeneous porous media, such as sandstones,
mudrocks, and soils, the digital rocks are single-scale and cannot involve the micro-and nano￾meter digital rocks (Wu et al. 2006).
3.2.2.3 Sequential Indicator Simulation
Keehm et al. (2004) utilized the sequential indicator simulation approach to reconstruct simple
porous media from 2D thin sections (Keehm et al. 2004). The sequential indicator simulation algo￾rithm is based on geostatistics. In this method, unknown nodes are predicted on a random path. For
56 3 Digital Rock Modelingevery node, the local conditional cumulative distribution function is evaluated by indicator kriging.
The function is related to the 2D input image. The procedure of the sequential indicator simulation
approach is as follows: (i) Take a value from the local conditional cumulative distribution function;
(ii) Keep the number as the conditioning data and visit the next unknown node along a predefined
path; (iii) Determine the value of the unknown node using the porosity and autocorrelation
function; (iv) Visit all the nodes in the simulation region and produce a binary 3D image. In their
study, petrophysical properties of generated digital rocks, including porosity and permeability, were
compared with those from laboratory measurements, and the results showed agreement between
estimated and measured values (Keehm et al. 2004). Nevertheless, samples in their study were from
conventional reservoirs, so the produced digital models were single-scale.
3.2.2.4 Multiple-Point Statistics
The theory of most aforementioned computational modeling algorithms, such as the truncated
Gaussian random field method, simulated annealing, and sequential indicator simulation method,
is based on the two-point correlation functions. Such methods might not be very efficient for
generating 3D digital rocks with long-range connectivity since considering two points is not
sufficient, particularly for reconstructing complex structures (Tahmasebi and Sahimi 2012). Thus,
multiple-point statistics (MPS) was proposed to overcome this issue (Strebelle 2002; Tahmasebi
2018b; Zhang et al. 2006a). To date, MPS methods have been developed in pixel- and pattern-based
forms (Tahmasebi 2018b). The former contains a single normal equation simulation (Strebelle
2002), direct sampling (Mariethoz et al. 2010), and cumulants (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2010).
The latter involves the simulation of a pattern (Arpat and Caers 2007), filter-based simulation
(Zhang et al. 2006b), and cross-correlation simulation (Tahmasebi et al. 2012). Afterward, the
hybrid pixel- and pattern simulation in the MPS method was proposed by Tahmasebi et al.
(2017) where the capabilities of both categories are combined. The MPS method extracts the
multiple-point correlation from a conceptual input called a training image, using which new values
are estimated. The training image can be 2D or 3D.
Okabe and Blunt (2005) used this method to reconstruct 3D digital rocks, but their simulation
was very time-demanding (Okabe and Blunt 2005). Later, many researchers adopted the MPS meth￾ods to build 3D porous media (Ding et al. 2018; Hajizadeh et al. 2011; Ji et al. 2017; Tahmasebi and
Sahimi 2012; Wu et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2015). Among the studies, the cross-correlation simulation
algorithm is widely used and has been applied to various porous materials, including rock, copper
foam, hard-sphere packing, electron detector, stroboscopic optical reflectance image, oxygen-free
copper, ferritic steel sample, and fiber concrete material (Ji et al. 2017; Song et al. 2018; Tahmasebi
2018a; Tahmasebi and Sahimi 2012, 2013, 2018). During the 3D reconstruction from a 2D training
image, one should employ a sampling method to extract necessary pixels in one layer as condition￾ing data (or hard data) when generating the next layer since the pore structure should slowly
change between two adjacent layers. The sampling strategy is quite significant, which determines
the connectivity of the reconstructed porous media. The main modeling procedure of this method is
to generate the next layer based on the prior layer. Finally, all the produced layers are piled together
to generate an entire 3D model. If the initially built 3D model contains artifacts or discontinuities,
one can use optimization strategies to remove these structures (Tahmasebi and Sahimi 2016;
Tahmasebi et al. 2020a). In addition, Feng et al. (2019) combined this strategy with a conditional
generative adversarial network in deep learning to improve the simulation speed of the conven￾tional MPS method (Feng et al. 2018a).
Compared with other stochastic modeling methods, MPS has some distinct advantages. It can
effectively reconstruct 3D digital rocks with great connectivity of pores. Besides, MPS based on
cross-correlation simulation also considers multiple mineral components, rather than only pore
3.2 Single-Scale Modeling of Digital Rocks 57space and solid matrix, when it is used to reconstruct 3D multicomponent digital rocks (Tahmasebi
2018a; Tahmasebi et al. 2017); see Figure 3.1. This is of great importance since realistic samples
indeed encompass several minerals. However, the drawback of this method is that it relies on
training images. This issue was later addressed by including other sources of information, such
as histogram matching (Tahmasebi et al. 2016b) and soft data conditioning (Tahmasebi and Sahimi
2015). Clearly, the generated 3D digital rock is single-scale if the training image only involves
single-scale structures. If one wants to use it to reconstruct the multiscale digital rocks, multiscale
images should be available for the training images.
3.2.2.5 Machine Learning
Machine learning has been used to reconstruct 2D and 3D porous media and calculate their trans￾port and physical properties (Kamrava et al. 2019b, 2021; Karimpouli and Tahmasebi 2019b; Mosser
et al. 2017, 2018). For example, one can use generative adversarial networks and produce more rea￾lizations. Furthermore, conditional generative networks can also be used to reconstruct the entire
images based on an extremely small subarea (Feng et al. 2019). 3D porous media based on 2D
images has also been reconstructed using this approach (Feng et al. 2020). Similarly, the physical
properties can also be estimated with high accuracy. These previous studies indicate that the deep
learning method presents an excellent performance in the reconstruction of porous media.
A comprehensive review of all such methods is available elsewhere (Tahmasebi et al. 2020b). How￾ever, in such studies, the utilized samples are still single-scale and simple rocks, such as Berea sand￾stones, Bead packs, and Ketton limestones. If the training images are multiscale, the method may
construct multiscale digital rocks.
3.2.2.6 Process-Based Modeling
Sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones, mudrocks, and carbonates, are formed after sedimentary
materials experience various diagenesis events including compaction, cementation, and dissolu￾tion. By going through such diagenesis events, loose and high-permeability sediments gradually
tighten, and rocks become low-permeable. Several attempts have been made to mimic the above
natural events. For example, Bryant et al. (1993) used spheres to construct a 3D digital core by simu￾lating the compaction and overgrowth of minerals in sedimentary rocks. However, they only con￾sidered two diagenesis events, and their morphological features were not realistic. After that, Bakke
and Øren (1997) reconstructed 3D digital cores by mimicking the deposition process, compaction
process, and cementation process of sedimentary rocks. In their study, they first obtained the

58 3 Digital Rock Modelingparticle size cumulative probability curve from 2D images, randomly selected a value on the cumu￾lative probability curve, and used the value as the particle radius. Then, the particle was deposited
in a preset sedimentation box under the gravitational field. Their algorithm searched for the lowest
local- or global-energy point, and this point was considered to be the deposition location of the par￾ticle. Considering the realistic situation that the location of real particle deposition is affected by
horizontal hydrodynamic effects, when the deposition process occurs in a hydrodynamic environ￾ment, the particle is deposited at the point of the lowest local potential. In a strongly hydrodynamic
environment, particles settle at the point of the lowest global potential. According to the above￾described rules, all particles are deposited in the simulation box. When it comes to the simulation
of compaction, they hold the viewpoint that compaction is a process of a linear transformation of
the ordinates of the deposited particles, so the simulation of compaction is realized by changing the
coordinates of the particles. With regard to the simulation of cementation, they only simulated the
overgrowth of quartz and clay coating.
There are three main types of clay coating: pore lining, pore filling, and pore bridging (Øren and
Bakke 2002). The clustering algorithm is used to simulate pore lining and pore-filling. After simu￾lating the diagenesis events, a 3D digital rock is reconstructed, and the accuracy of the model is
verified by comparing the simulated rock properties with the experimental values. Numerical
researchers built digital porous media using a similar process-based method (Al Ibrahim et al.
2019; Biswal et al. 1999; Jin et al. 2003; Keehm et al. 2001; Latief et al. 2010; Mousavi and Bryant
2012; Politis et al. 2008; Ratnanabha et al. 2014; Torskaya et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2020b; Zhao et al.
2013; Zhu et al. 2012). Over time, the simulation accuracy of the process-based techniques was
improved by adding more physics and complexities.
Compared to other computational modeling methods, process-based approaches consider the
geological rules when generating digital rocks (Wu et al. 2020b, 2020e). In addition, they could
be used to reconstruct multiscale digital rocks if complex diagenesis events and multiscale pore
structures are fully taken into consideration. However, there are some disadvantages. Firstly,
the used particles are spherical and not near irregular geometries. The realistic particles are very
complex in shape. More textural characteristics including roundness, sphericity, and elongation
should be accounted for while such particles are generated (Tahmasebi 2019; Tahmasebi et al.
2020a). Secondly, one should analyze diagenesis events and the history of diagenesis according
to thin sections before randomly simulating diagenesis processes. If not, implemented diagenesis
events would be totally random without a theoretical basis. Last, since some minerals, particularly
clay minerals, have special morphological features, not all the used objects exactly represent the
realistic structure of minerals.
3.3 Multiscale Modeling of Digital Rocks
Section 3.2 presented the widely used modeling techniques of single-scale digital rocks appropriate
for conventional reservoirs. However, unconventional reservoirs exhibit extremely heterogeneous
characteristics and their pore systems involve both the micro- and nano- or centimeter pores (Cai
et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2013; Lai et al. 2018; Loucks et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2014; Tahmasebi 2018c;
Tahmasebi et al. 2020a; Wang et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). One single image from X-ray CT or
SEM experiment may not necessarily contain multiscale structure features of such reservoir rocks
(Prodanović et al. 2015; Tahmasebi and Kamrava 2018; Tahmasebi et al. 2016a; Zeng et al. 2021). On
the other hand, conventional computational methods are not able to generate multiscale digital
3.3 Multiscale Modeling of Digital Rocks 59porous media based on one single simulation. To address this issue, several approaches, for exam￾ple, multiscale imaging techniques (Ma et al. 2017, 2019; Saif et al. 2017), image superposition
method, pore-network integration method, object-based reconstruction method, and image reso￾lution enhancement method were proposed to include information from distinct scales.
3.3.1 Multiscale Imaging Techniques
Unconventional reservoirs, tight sandstones, and carbonates manifest a strong level of heterogene￾ity. Taking shale formations as an example, their length-scale heterogeneity spans involve at least
five orders of magnitude (10−9 to 10−4 m). As to modeling the microstructures at different scales,
one should implement different imaging experiments. At the millimeter or centimeter scale, the
medical CT or low-resolution X-ray CT can be used to build the digital model of rocks. From
micrometer to millimeter scale, micrometer CT is a popular method to construct the 3D digital core
at a higher resolution. When it comes to nanometer-scale 3D imaging, the nanometer CT and
focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) are suitable choices. Macro-CT images
can capture large-scale structures, such as fractures and silt-rich laminas (Ma et al. 2019). Micro-CT
images can obtain a lot of micrometer pores, mainly intergranular pores. In higher-resolution ima￾ging experiments including nano-CT and FIB-SEM, the acquired images mainly include nanopores,
especially organic-matter pores. Also, a transmission electron microscope can be used to capture
sub-nanometer pores.
The above-discussed multiscale imaging techniques can also be applied to other unconventional
reservoirs. These techniques are of significance to characterize and model the structures of porous
media at different scales, which can improve our understanding of the complex unconventional
reservoirs. Nevertheless, these multiscale techniques have to make a balance between the resolu￾tion and the field of view. In other words, current 3D imaging techniques either cover large-scale
structures at a lower resolution or cover a small region at a higher resolution (Tahmasebi 2018c; Wu
et al. 2019b). Moreover, it is not easy to integrate 3D images at small scales into large-scale ones.
Overall, it is of great difficulty to construct large-scale and high-resolution porous media only by
multiscale imaging techniques.
3.3.2 Computational Methods
For simple and homogeneous porous media, one may use one of the stochastic methods discussed
in Section 3.2.2 to properly reconstruct single-scale 3D digital models. However, for complex and
heterogeneous samples, it is difficult to produce multiscale 3D digital rocks. Thus, some other
methods are required to generate large-scale and high-resolution images, such as image superpo￾sition, pore-network integration, image resolution, and object-based reconstruction methods.
3.3.2.1 Image Superposition
The goal of the image superposition method is to build a multiscale image by superposing images
from different scales and resolutions. Such images can cover structures of different scales. The high￾resolution images cover a small area but capture ample fine-scale structures. The low-resolution
images, however, include large-scale information and may not disclose fine-scale patterns. The
image superposition method aims to fuse multiresolution spatial information into a large-scale
and high-resolution model.
Okabe and Blunt (2007) used this approach to generate a large-scale and high-resolution digital
image of carbonate rocks. They carried out X-ray CT imaging to capture large pores and vugs
in carbonates at a low resolution. On the other hand, they randomly generated high-resolution
60 3 Digital Rock Modeling3D micropores using multiple-point statistics based on a 2D image. Then, the voxel number of the
3D image from the CT technique was scaled to match the number of the stochastically produced
image. Finally, the superposition of two images created a multiscale digital rock containing macro￾pores and micropores (Okabe and Blunt 2007). Later, Yao et al. (2013) used the image superposition
method to reconstruct multiscale digital images of carbonate rocks. In their study, they utilized sim￾ulated annealing to build a digital porous medium containing macropores based on a coarse-scale
2D image, while they randomly produced digital core-covered micropores by the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo technique (Yao et al. 2013). In addition to carbonates, multiscale digital images of
shale samples were constructed using the superposition method. Tahmasebi and his coauthors
(2015, 2016) employed multiple-point statistics, which involves a cross-correlation function, to gen￾erate low-resolution and high-resolution 3D digital shale models according to micrometer-scale
and nanometer-scale 2D images, respectively. Then, they overlapped the micro- and nano-meter
pores to generate multiscale 3D digital shale models (Tahmasebi et al. 2015, 2016b). Similarly, other
researchers used the superposition method to reconstruct the multiscale digital rocks of complex
porous media (Cao et al. 2018; Gerke et al. 2015; Ji et al. 2019; Lemmens et al. 2019; Li et al. 2020;
Rao et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2018a; Wu et al. 2020c; Yang et al. 2015). In the above-mentioned stud￾ies, high-resolution 3D digital rocks were generated using one stochastic method.
The superposition method seems to be appropriate for constructing multiscale digital rocks
of unconventional reservoirs. It can be applied to the superposition of more than two-scale
images. Besides, some researchers also used this method to build multicomponent (multiphase)
digital porous media (Ji et al. 2019; Lemmens et al. 2019). One of the drawbacks of the method
is computation-demanding to fuse digital images with more than one billion voxels.
3.3.2.2 Pore-Network Integration
Pore space can be represented by the pore networks for large porous systems. From the pore space
to the pore network (see Figure 3.2), the pores and throats are simplified as balls and tubes, respec￾tively (Fatt 1956; Tahmasebi and Kamrava 2018). There are numerous methods to extract the pore
networks from the images (Bultreys et al. 2016), for instance, the medial axis method (Idowu et al.
2014; Lindquist et al. 2000), maximal ball method (Dong and Blunt 2009), grain-based method
(Idowu et al. 2014), and Delaunay-tesselation based method (Bhattad et al. 2011). Bultreys et al.
(2016) compared the advantages and disadvantages of different extraction methods. If one only

3.3 Multiscale Modeling of Digital Rocks 61focuses on the pore space rather than solid minerals in complex porous media, one can integrate
macropores and micropores into a pore network. Then the multiscale pore network can be used to
predict the transport properties and study the flow mechanisms.
Bauer et al. (2012) proposed a dual pore network method to predict the petrophysical properties
of heterogeneous rocks by combining the macropores and micropores. Jiang et al. (2013) generated
multiscale pore networks of carbonate rocks and presented a detailed modeling workflow. Firstly,
they scanned a carbonate sample using a multiple-resolution X-ray CT machine and obtained mul￾tiscale digital images. Then, they extracted the pore networks and analyzed their properties, such as
the pore/throat radius and coordination number distributions. Under the constraint of the pore￾system properties, they randomly generated equivalent fine-scale networks, which can be rescaled
to be of any size. Finally, they integrated the networks of macropores and micropores into a single
pore network. Among the two kinds of networks, the fine-scale throats were added to keep their
connection. Eventually, the three-scale pore networks of carbonate rocks were generated (Jiang
et al. 2013). Later, Mehmani and Prodanović (2014) used a similar technique to build a two-scale
pore network of complex rocks and analyzed the effects of micropores on the transport properties of
porous media. In their study, they also utilized a scaling factor to change the size of the micropores.
In contrast, the micropores were randomly produced in two forms, namely pore filling and grain
filling. For these two cases, the connected forms among macropores are different (Mehmani and
Prodanović 2014). Afterward, Bultreys et al. (2015) regarded the micropores as micro-links that
can connect the macropores in parallel or series. Then, they generated the dual pore networks
of carbonates and validated the accuracy of the proposed method by comparing the produced net￾work and the one from the CT experiment (Bultreys et al. 2015). Yao et al. (2015) also integrated
three-scale pore networks from stochastically generated 3D images and constructed multiscale pore
networks containing vugs, macropores, and micropores (Yao et al. 2015). de Vries et al. (2017) trea￾ted the micropores in heterogeneous porous media as the microscopic aggregate domain. In the
simulation domain, the microscopic aggregates are stochastically produced and randomly inserted
in the macropore domain in order to construct the multiscale pore network. In each microscopic
aggregate, there were numerous micropores. The micropores are connected to adjacent macropores
by the small throats. Tahmasebi and Kamrava (2018) presented a mini-review of constructing mul￾tiscale pore networks. Moreover, they also put forward a new approach for producing multiscale
pore networks. The macropore networks were first extracted from the 3D coarse-scale CT images,
while the micropore networks were obtained from the stochastically generated 3D porous media
based on the high-resolution 2D SEM images. The technique of reconstructing 3D images from 2D
ones was multiple-point statistics based on the cross-correlation function, which was initially devel￾oped by Tahmasebi and his coauthors (Tahmasebi 2017; Tahmasebi and Sahimi 2012; Tahmasebi
et al. 2012). The generated micropore networks were fused into the specific locations and connected
with the previous existing macropores in rocks. In addition, they also took the grain-filling and
pore-filling micropores into consideration. In their study, the fraction of micropores was also var￾ied, displayed in Figure 3.2, to investigate its impact on rock properties (Tahmasebi and Kamrava
2018). Wang et al. (2018b, 2019a) produced the multiscale pore networks by integrating the mul￾tiple pore networks of different scales and used the pore network to study the transport properties of
complex porous media (Wang et al. 2018b, 2019a).
Multiscale pore networks are an alternative strategy for multiscale digital rocks. They can rep￾resent the complex pore systems by the simplified geometries, such as spheres and tubes. This is
a quite efficient approach to characterizing the inner pore structures of heterogeneous porous
media. In addition, it is uncomplicated to simulate the fluid flow in such simplified pore networks.
However, the pore networks only signify the pore structures rather than the whole elements. They
62 3 Digital Rock Modelingdo not contain any information on solid space, so the multiscale networks cannot be utilized to
study the rock properties related to the minerals, for instance, the elastic moduli and other proper￾ties of solid mechanics. Moreover, the pore networks are simplified pore systems, which may lead to
inaccurate results when they are used to predict the transport properties.
3.3.2.3 Image Resolution Enhancement
Generating high-resolution and large-scale images is of great significance for the accurate evalua￾tion of petrophysical properties. Apart from the image superposition and pore-network integration
method, another alternative approach is to enhance the resolution of coarse-scale images (Kamrava
et al. 2019a; Tahmasebi et al. 2020a; Wu et al. 2019c).
Tahmasebi (2018c) used a hybrid pattern- and pixel-based simulation algorithm and a similarity
map to insert the fine-scale structures into a coarse-scale image. The finally generated large model
included both the micro- and nano-meter structures (Tahmasebi 2018c). Wu et al. (2019b) used a
template-matching algorithm based on the cross-correlation function to fuse the fine-scale struc￾tures from multiscale and multiresolution images into a high-resolution and large-scale model.
The workflow of enhancing the image resolution based on the template matching algorithm is
shown in Figure 3.3. They searched for the best matching patterns from nanometer-scale training
images, then inserted them into the rescaled coarse image. Finally, they obtained a large-scale and
high-resolution image that is closer to the actual one (Wu et al. 2019c). Later, the conventional neu￾ral networks were applied to enhance the resolution enhancement of CT images (Chen et al. 2020;
Ebadi et al. 2021; Janssens et al. 2020; Ying Da Wang et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019b) and SEM images
(Kamrava et al. 2019a). Among these studies, Kamrava et al. (2019a) proposed a hybrid stochastic
deep-learning (HSDL) algorithm to improve the resolution of coarse-scale images. They combined
the cross-correlation-based simulation (CCSIM) method and image processing techniques to sto￾chastically generate hundreds of images based on several available images as the training images
for situations where enough data are not available (Kamrava et al. 2019a).
3.3.2.4 Object-Based Reconstruction
Object-based methods construct digital rocks by stochastically generating relevant geometries
(objects) in shale samples that are similar to the existing minerals/pores. Such elements may be
represented by rectangles, circles, and ellipses in 2D, and cubes, spheres, and ellipsoids in 3D. When
generating these objects, the morphological characteristics, size distributions, and volume fractions
of real minerals and pores should be fully taken into account (Wu et al. 2020d). Thus, the multiscale
pores or minerals can be reproduced if their properties are available. When more properties and
complex geometries are considered, the generated models would be closer to the real rocks
(Wu et al. 2020d).
Naraghi and Javadpour (2015) used 2D rectangular patches as the organic matter and randomly
put them in the simulation domain. The regions which are not occupied by the rectangles were
taken as the inorganic matter. The sizes of pores in organic matter and inorganic matrix were
assigned to the cells according to the size distributions of organic and inorganic pores (Naraghi
and Javadpour 2015). Naraghi et al. (2018) used more complex 2D objects to signify the different
minerals. The ellipses of different sizes represent the fecal pellet, feldspar, quartz, and clay mineral.
The hexagon denotes the quartz and they finally generated 2D multiscale digital rocks. Later,
Tahmasebi et al. (2020a) extended the 2D objects to 3D ones and used the ellipsoids to produce
3D digital cores. Harland et al. (2015) utilized the spheres and cuboids to produce the 2D and
3D multiscale digital models of carbonates and proved that the micropores had a great impact
on the permeability of carbonates (Harland et al. 2015).

experience complex diagenesis events and the internal components greatly change (Curtis et al.
2012; Ko et al. 2018; Loucks and Reed 2014; Pommer and Milliken 2015; Wu et al. 2015). Wu
et al. (2020b, 2020e) combined the quartet structure generation set algorithm (Wang et al. 2007)
and object-based method to generate dynamic shale models. During the construction of the shale
models, the variations of minerals, organic matter, and pores were fully taken into account. For
example, once the shale models experience cementation, the calcite and quartz often overgrow,
and calcite is then also added. While the organic matter transforms into oil, bitumen, and gas,
the organic-matter pores appear (Loucks and Reed 2014). The construction process is indeed
process-mimic modeling. The morphological features, size distributions, and volume fractions of
all the phases, including minerals, organic matter, interparticle pores, intraparticle pores, and
organic-matter pores, should be all accounted for (Wu et al. 2020b, 2020e). Some finally generated
shale models are demonstrated in Figure 3.4.
3.4 Conclusions and Future Perspectives
In terms of the simple porous media with homogeneous pore structures, single-scale stochastic
modeling or experiment techniques should be enough to generate a representative digital core.
For the experimental instruments, the X-ray computer tomography scanner is the most effective
tool to build the digital rocks of conventional reservoirs. With regard to the stochastic modeling
methods, simulated annealing, multiple-point statistics, and process-based modeling are widely
used methods.
As to complex porous media with heterogeneous pore systems, multiscale imaging techniques
should be used to capture the characteristics of pore structures at different scales. However, it is
quite difficult to fuse the multiresolution and multiscale structures into a large-scale digital image.

method. Source: Adapted from Wu et al. (2020c). Each color represents one kind of mineral or pore.
3.4 Conclusions and Future Perspectives 65Thus, several methods, e.g. image superposition and pore-network integration algorithms, were
proposed to achieve such a goal. The former method can generate a multiscale digital rock contain￾ing the pore space and solid matrix, but the latter only can produce a multiscale pore network. Thus,
the former i.e. the image superposition method may be a more popular technique than the latter in
the future. To build the multiscale digital rocks, some algorithms, such as deep learning and tem￾plate matching, were proposed to enhance the resolution of digital images. In addition, the object￾based modeling method is an alternative strategy to generate multiscale and multiphase digital
rocks. The morphological features, size distributions, and volume fractions are all fully taken into
consideration when using the method to generate the digital cores.
Although numerous algorithms for constructing single- and multiple-scale digital rocks were
developed, most of them can only generate static models which do not vary with the increase of
temperature and pressure. For sedimentary rocks, especially shale samples, the inner pore struc￾tures would greatly change when the temperature and pressure vary. The process-based and object￾based modeling techniques show great potential to implement dynamic modeling.
Building the multiphase or multicomponent digital rocks is of great significance for the study of
the solid mechanisms of porous media. Most stochastic modeling and experimental techniques can￾not easily accomplish such a goal. Object-based modeling methods could generate such models.
Nevertheless, the properties of minerals, e.g. morphological features, are partially considered in
the method. Thus, developing more powerful techniques to produce accurate multicomponent dig￾ital cores can be researched further.
The development of numerous modeling methods of single- and multiple-scale digital cores has
greatly improved the accuracy of modeling. The single-scale, static, and two-phase (i.e. pore and
solid) models have been perfectly constructed. At present, constructing multiscale, dynamic,
and, multiphase (multicomponent) digital rocks would be the development trend in the field.

4.1 Introduction
In geological and petroleum engineering, flow and transport in porous rocks are typically investi￾gated at three scales: (i) pore, (ii) core, and (iii) reservoir. Accordingly, scaling has been an active
subject of research. In fact, the effect of scale (or sample volume) on petrophysical properties of
rocks has been known for decades (Brace 1984; Ewing et al. 2010; Garbesi et al. 1996; Hyun
et al. 2002; Rovey and Cherkauer 1995; Yoon and Dewers 2013), and various scaling approaches
have been proposed to study the scale dependence of flow and transport in porous media. For
example, based on experimental measurements from different formations, Schulze-Makuch
et al. (1999) proposed an empirical power–law scaling relationship to relate permeability k to
sample volume Vs as follows:
k = CV m
s 4 1
where the constant C and scaling exponent m characterizing the formation’s heterogeneity are
empirical. For different values of the exponent m in various types of porous media, see Esmaeilpour
et al. (2021). Although Eq. (4.1) has been frequently applied in the literature, it is purely empirical,
and because of its empiricism the interpretation of its parameters and their variations from one
sample to another is not clear.
Ghanbarian et al. (2015) applied a machine learning method called contrast pattern-aided regres￾sion and proposed scale-dependent functions to estimate permeability from other porous media
properties. They showed that by including sample internal diameter and height (or length), k esti￾mations were substantially improved (Ghanbarian et al. 2015, 2017).
In the context of percolation theory (Hunt et al. 2014), Hunt (2006) assumed that pore-throat size
distribution followed the power–law probability density function and proposed a theoretical rela￾tionship that estimates the scale dependence of permeability from pore space characteristics as well
as the permeability value at the representative elementary volume (REV). Using experimental data
of Schulze-Makuch (1996), collected from various sites within a carbonate-rock aquifer in south￾eastern Wisconsin, Hunt (2006) found generally well agreement between his model estimations
and experiments. More recently, Esmaeilpour et al. (2021) generalized Hunt’s approach (Hunt
2006) to be independent of the shape of pore-throat size distribution, compared their proposed
generalized model with pore-network simulations, and extended the percolation-based model to
formation factor and its scale dependence in porous media. By comparing with pore-scale

and between 0.21 and 4.04% for formation factor.
Despite recent progress (Ghanbarian 2022a, 2022b; Ghanbarian et al. 2021), we are still far from
fully understanding the effect of length scale on petrophysical properties of rocks. The main objec￾tives of this study are to (i) apply a simple theoretical scaling law developed by Machta and Guyer
(1987) for random resistor networks, (ii) adopt it to networks of pores, and (iii) evaluate it using
pore-network simulations.
4.2 Theory
In this section, we first present the concepts of the theoretic model proposed by Machta and Guyer
(1987). Then, its applications to porous media and scale-dependent permeability and formation
factor are discussed.
4.2.1 Funnel Defect Approach
Machta and Guyer (1987) studied the expected value of the largest current flowing in a random
resistor network. They assumed that the network was composed of low- and high-conductance
(gl and gh) resistors whose distribution conformed to the following probability density function:
f g = pδ g − gh + 1 − p δ g − gl 4 2
where f(g) is the conductance distribution, δ represents the delta function, p is the occupation
probability of high-conductance resistors, and 0 < gl/gh < 1. Equation (4.2) is schematically shown
in Figure 4.1.
Machta and Guyer (1987) considered the most effective defect for producing large currents and
argued that the average largest current over configurations of the conductance imax should con￾form to the following scaling law
imax ln L α 4 3
where L is the linear size of the network, and α is a scaling exponent. The value of α depends on gl/gh
and network dimensionality d. In two dimensions (d = 2), Machta and Guyer (1987) found the
following relationship:
α =

78 4 Scale Dependence of Permeability and Formation FactorIn three dimensions, however, the relationship between α and gl/gh is more complicated (see equa￾tion 3.2 in Machta and Guyer 1987). In Figure 4.2, we show α versus gl/gh for two and three dimen￾sions. The 2D line represents Eq. (4.4), while the 3D one was digitized from figure 2 of Machta and
Guyer (1987). As can be seen, α ranges between 0 and 0.5 in two dimensions. However, its value
varies from 0 to nearly 0.33 in three dimensions. Theoretically, 0 < α < 1/d, so that the average max￾imum expected current diverges with L, if gl/gh is near 1 (Machta and Guyer 1987).
Chan et al. (1989) simulated the electric current in two-dimensional resistor networks and eval￾uated the predictability of Eq. (4.3) for gl/gh = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. By comparing with numerical
simulations, they found reasonably well agreement between theory and simulation. Chan et al.
(1989) also showed that the configuration of resistors in the neighborhood of large currents had
a funnel shape.
4.2.2 Application to Porous Media
Unlike random resistor networks constructed of low- and high-conductance values (gl and gh) pre￾sumed by Machta and Guyer (1987), natural porous media are typically composed of pore conduc￾tances following a broad distribution shown in Figure 4.3. The term “broad,” however, has not been
satisfactorily defined in the literature. This means that pore conductance distributions in porous
rocks probably do not conform to the delta function given in Eq. (4.1). Nonetheless, when gl = 0
and if f(g) is narrow enough, we demonstrate that the proposed scaling law, Eq. (4.3), as a phenom￾enological approach, results in accurate estimations of permeability and formation factor below the
REV. Recall that when gl = 0, gl/gh = 0 and thus α = 0.33 in three dimensions (Fig. 4.2).
To apply Eq. (4.3) to estimate the scale dependence of permeability and formation factor, we
assume that the average largest current is approximately the main contributor to hydraulic or elec￾trical flow, and, thus, k ≈ imax and F ≈ imax −1
. Accordingly, by normalizing Eq. (4.3), one has:

4.3 Pore-network Simulations
To construct pore networks composed of spherical pore bodies and cylindrical pore throats, we used
the open-access code developed by Valvatne (2004). The code generates pore networks based on a
truncated Weibull distribution with two shape parameters δ and γ as well as lower and upper
cutoffs. In this study, three different pore-throat radius ranges, i.e. 0.1–10, 1–50, and 10–75 μm, were
used to have different levels of pore-scale heterogeneity (Table 4.1). Within each range, we varied γ
from 12 to 30 (γ = 12, 18, 24, and 30), while set δ = 0.2. Overall, 12 synthetic pore networks with
constant pore-throat length of 100 μm and pore coordination number of 6 were generated. The net￾work size varied from 1130 to 6770 μm (L = 1130, 2250, 3380, 4510, and 6770 μm). This means that
Lmin = 1130 μm.
Figure 4.3 shows the pore-throat radius distributions for the12 pore networks. As can be seen, the
pore-throat radius distribution becomes broader from Network 1 to Network 3. Permeability and
formation factors were simulated using the “poreflow” simulator, also developed by Valvatne
(2004). The value of permeability was determined using Darcy’s law, and the total flow rate was
calculated by solving for pressure throughout the network under the steady-state flow conditions.
Formation factor F, defined as the ratio of saturated medium resistivity to brine resistivity, was
determined based on Ohm’s law. Simulations of permeability and formation factor were iterated
a hundred times and averaged over all realizations.

80 4 Scale Dependence of Permeability and Formation Factor4.4 Results and Discussion
Figure 4.5 presents the results of pore-scale numerical simulations of k and F as well as the theo￾retical estimations by Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) for Network 1. Recall that this is the pore network with the
narrowest pore-throat radius distribution studied here (Figure 4.4). As reported in Figure 4.5, we
found an average relative error between −0.67 and −0.44% for permeability, which demonstrates
accurate theoretical estimations. The negative average relative errors indicate that Eq. (4.5) gener￾ally underestimated the scale dependence of permeability. Figure 4.5 also shows that the permea￾bility increases with increase in the network size, although the pore-throat radius distribution does
not statistically vary with the scale.
The estimated scale-dependent formation factors using Eq. (4.6) are also shown in Figure 4.5 for
Network 1. We found the average relative error between 0.04 and 0.15% showing precise theoretical
estimations. In contrast to the results of k(L), the positive average relative errors reported in
Figure 4.5 indicate that, generally speaking, Eq. (4.6) slightly overestimated the scale dependence
of the formation factor.
Results for Network 2 are shown in Figure 4.6. Similar to Network 1, the value of permeability
increases, while the formation factor value decreases as the network size increases. Compared to
Network 1, k is nearly two orders of magnitude greater, and F is one order of magnitude smaller in
Network 2. Based on the permeability plots shown in Figure 4.6, it seems that Network 2 has a
greater REV than Network 1. Although the simulated k in Network 1 does not vary with the scale
at a network size of 6770 μm (Figure 4.5), its value tends to keep increasing with the scale in Net￾work 2. This shows that Network 2 should be more heterogeneous than Network 1, in accordance
with the broader pore-throat radius distribution in the former (Figure 4.4).

4.4 Results and Discussion 852.58% for Eq. (4.5) and −2.60 to −2.46% for Eq. (4.6) in the estimation of the scale dependence of
permeability and formation factor in Network 3. We also found that α = 0.18 led to more accurate
estimations in Network 3 compared to α = 0.33 (results not shown).
The average relative error values for Networks 2 and 3 are greater than those reported for
Network 1. This is most probably because the funnel defect approach and its subsequent deriva￾tions, Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6), work best in networks whose conductances conform to a delta function.
Accordingly, as the conductance (or pore-throat radius) distribution becomes broader, the accuracy
of the funnel defect approach is expected to decrease. Comparing the average relative errors
reported in Figures 4.5–4.7 clearly demonstrates that with the increase in the pore-scale heteroge￾neity, the model accuracy decreases.
4.5 Limitations
The effect of pore coordination number on flow and transport in porous media has been well
documented in the literature (Hunt et al. 2014; Jerauld et al. 1984; Sahimi 2011). Machta and Guyer
(1987) proposed their scaling law, Eq. (4.3), for simple square and cubic lattices in two and three
dimensions with coordination numbers 4 and 6, respectively. The average pore coordination
number in rocks is typically around 3 or 4 (Blunt 2017; Liang et al. 2000; Vogel and Roth 2001).
Therefore, generalizing their approach for any average pore coordination number would make
it applicable to a wide range of porous media.
The funnel defect approach and its subsequent derivations, Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6), are not a function
of REV and do not incorporate its effect. Recall that REV is the smallest size above which perme￾ability and/or formation factor does not change with scale. Accordingly, applying Eqs. (4.5) and
(4.6) near and above the REV may result in significant errors and uncertainties.
4.6 Conclusion
Modeling the scale dependence of permeability and formation factor in porous rocks has been a
challenge in petrophysics because understanding the effect of small- and large-scale heterogeneities
and capturing them are essential. In this study, we applied a simple scaling law developed based on
the funnel defect approach in physics. By adopting the theory to networks of pores represented
porous rocks, we investigated the effect of scale on permeability and formation factor. To evaluate
the proposed theoretic approach, we simulated permeability and formation factor in 12 pore net￾works with different levels of heterogeneities reflected in pore-throat radius distributions. Compar￾ing pore-network simulations with theoretical estimations showed that the proposed theoretic
approach estimated k and F accurately with relative errors less than 2.60%. However, further inves￾tigations are required to generalize the proposed approach and evaluate it both numerically and
experimentally using a broader range of porous rocks.

5.1 Introduction
Precise estimations of petrophysical properties of rocks, such as gas permeability, have numerous
practical applications, particularly in determining gas production from unconventional reservoirs.
Shale and tight formations have been successfully explored and produced not only in the United
States and North America but also in China (Jia et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2017). Accordingly, they
became one of the major contributors to energy supplies. Although investigating flow and transport
in unconventional reservoir rocks has made significant progress in the past decade, there is still a
long way to fully understand all mechanisms and key factors that control gas transport in such
formations.
Literature on single-phase gas permeability and its modeling in mudrocks is extensive and vast
(Allan and Mavko 2013; Civan 2010; Darabi et al. 2012; Ghanbarian and Javadpour 2017; Javadpour
2009; Landry et al. 2016; Nazari Moghaddam and Jamiolahmady 2016; Sakhaee-Pour and Bryant
2012), while investigations of gas relative permeability are still very limited. In what follows,
we summarize some applications from theoretic approaches and numerical simulations to the
modeling of gas transport in shales and tight porous rocks.
5.1.1 Theoretical Models
Early theoretical models of gas permeability were developed based on first- and then higher-order
slip equations (Zhang et al. 2012). For example, Beskok and Karniadakis (1999) accounted for slip
flow and modified the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for gas flow in a single cylindrical pore tube.
Javadpour (2009) incorporated first-order slip flow and Knudsen diffusion mechanisms and pro￾posed another model for gas permeability in a cylindrical nanopore. To scale up from pore scale
to core scale, theoretic models based on a bundle of capillary tubes have been developed to study
single-phase gas permeability and gas-relative permeability in shales and tight porous rocks. For
instance, Zhang et al. (2018) presumed that nanoscale inorganic pores in shales followed fractal
scaling, and their size distribution conformed to a power–law probability density function. They
proposed a gas-relative permeability model by considering effects of gas slippage in the entire
Knudsen regime, stress dependence, and water film thickness. Zhang et al. (2018) found that

© 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2023 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Knudsen diffusion and slippage effects boosted the gas-relative permeability considerably at low to
intermediate pressures (e.g., 0.1–1 MPa). They also stated that as pore space or tortuosity fractal
dimension increased, gas relative permeability slightly increased, while water relative permeability
decreased (see their figure 10).
Liu et al. (2018) proposed power–law functions to model gas relative permeability in unconven￾tional reservoir rocks based on the bundle of capillary tubes approach. Although theoretically
developed, their models (see their eqs. (31) and (32)) assume that gas relative permeability vanishes
at zero gas saturation meaning that critical gas saturation is zero. By fitting their one-parameter model
i.e. krg = (1 − Sw)
γ to four experimental data, Liu et al. (2018) found γ ranged between 3.9 and 40.9.
5.1.2 Pore-Network Models
Pore-network models (PNMs) have been used to study gas transport in nanoporous membranes by
incorporating effects of different mechanisms, such as viscous flow, Knudsen diffusion, and hin￾dered diffusion. Mehmani et al. (2013) were among the first to propose three-dimensional PNMs
to study single-phase gas permeability in shales. Their models were composed of two domains:
(i) pores in nanometer size range (~100–575 nm), and (ii) pores in micrometer size range
(~10–57.5 μm). In both domains, the pore coordination number was four (Z = 4), and slip flow
and Knudsen diffusion were important contributors to gas flow. Results of Mehmani et al.
(2013) demonstrated the non-trivial contribution of Knudsen diffusion and slip flow, particularly
at low pressures and in pore networks with dominant fraction of nanopores. Mehmani et al. (2013)
also showed that gas permeability significantly depended on the fraction of nanoscale pores.
However, they did not address how the connectivity between organic patches and inorganic matrix
would affect gas permeability of the entire pore network.
Ma et al. (2014) derived the pore network of a shale sample, contained near 20,000 pore bodies
and 30,000 pore throats, from a three-dimensional model reconstructed from serial SEM images.
The porosity of the network was 2.9%, the average pore coordination number was near 3, and
80% of the pores were less than 10 nm in radius. Considering slip flow and Knudsen diffusion
mechanisms, Ma et al. (2014) simulated gas permeability in PNMs using methane and nitrogen
under operational and laboratory conditions, respectively. They stated that “… the nitrogen perme￾ability can only approximate the methane permeability within a certain range of field operational
conditions when the slip flow is not dominating.”
In another study, Zhang et al. (2015a) developed a three-dimensional multi-scale PNM in which
organic pores, inorganic pores, and pore coordination number conformed to normal distributions
with means and standard deviations obtained from actual shale samples. The average organic and
inorganic pore sizes were 6 and 300 nm, respectively. Results of Zhang et al. (2015a) showed that gas
permeability was greatly dependent on pore pressure and organic pore sizes. More specifically, they
found that as pore pressure decreases, the effect of viscous flow vanishes, while slip flow and
Knudsen diffusion become gradually dominant flow regimes.
Song et al. (2017) simulated gas permeability via PNMs constructed based on a section of a high￾resolution SEM image of an organic-rich shale sample. Their PNM simulations, accordingly,
represent gas flow contributions in organic pores. Song et al. (2017) developed three PNMs with
different average pore radii – 1.56, 3.2, and 15.6 nm – and determined gas permeability for pore
pressures from 5 to 70 MPa. They found that for pores smaller than 5 nm, gas permeability was
remarkably sensitive to gas properties and surface diffusion. They stated that “… when the pore
radius is less than 2 nm, the gas permeability will be significantly underestimated if the surface
diffusion is neglected.”
92 5 Modeling Gas Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir Rocks5.1.3 Gas Transport Mechanisms
In addition to slip flow and Knudsen diffusion, more complex mechanisms, such as sorption and
surface diffusion, were incorporated to model gas flow in shales (Allan and Mavko 2013; Naraghi
et al. 2018; Song et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2015b). For instance, Wu et al. (2016) proposed a unified
theoretical model by coupling various mechanisms including slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, sorp￾tion, and surface diffusion. The authors stated that “… surface diffusion is an important transport
mechanism, and its contribution cannot be negligible and even dominates in nanopores with less
than 2 nm in diameter.” In contrast, Naraghi et al. (2018) claimed that surface diffusion has little
impact on total gas flow. Their results, however, are based on two-dimensional stochastic models of
shale samples at 13.8 MPa (2000 psi) pore pressure. Remarkable discrepancies between two- and
three-dimensional models, representing shales, and their gas permeability estimations have been
recently highlighted in Cao et al. (2017). Those authors considered slip flow and Knudsen diffusion
mechanisms and demonstrated that deviations between two- and three-dimensional models are
negligible only if pore pressure is greater than 10 MPa. Interestingly, Finkbeiner et al. (2001)
reported that pore pressure in shale reservoirs is typically greater than 20 MPa (see their tables
5 and 6). In another study, Gherabati et al. (2016) indicated that for Eagle Ford the pore pressure
varied from near 14 to about 97 MPa. A recent three-dimensional stochastic model based on an
embedded discrete fracture model by Xu et al. (2017) included organic and inorganic pores as well
as fractures to investigate permeability anisotropy of shale formations. As expected, their results
showed that the contribution of fractures to gas permeability was more prominent than that of
matrix. They also found that the contribution of inorganic pores to permeability was greater than
that of organic pores.
Table 5.1 summarizes several studies as well as mechanisms used to investigate gas permeability
of unconventional reservoir rocks by means of bundle-of-tubes, pore-network, and stochastic mod￾els in the literature.
5.1.4 Objectives
In this book chapter, we aim to present applications from effective-medium theory (EMT) to mod￾eling single-phase gas permeability and relative gas permeability in unconventional reservoir rocks.
The main objectives of this study are to (i) develop upscaling theoretical frameworks based upon
EMT to model gas transport under variably saturated conditions and (ii) to compare the proposed
models with experimental data, PNMs, and lattice-Boltzmann simulations from the literature.
5.2 Effective-Medium Theory
EMT (Bruggeman 1935; Landauer 1952) is an upscaling technique from statistical physics in which
a heterogeneous medium is replaced by a homogeneous one with an effective permeability that is
supposed to be an estimate of the original medium (Sahimi 2011). Based on EMT, the effective con￾ductance ge of the homogeneous medium is calculated by requiring that the spatially averaged per￾turbations, taken with respect to the pore conductance distribution f( g) in the heterogeneous
medium, to be zero as follows
gmax
gmin
ge − g
g + Z 2 − 1 ge
f g dg = 0 5 1

aPSD is pore-throat size distribution and PNM is pore-network model.where g is the pore conductance, gmin and gmax are the smallest and largest pore conductances in the
heterogeneous medium, respectively, and Z is the average pore coordination number. Recall that
pore conductance, g, is related to pore-throat radius, r, via the Hagen-Poiseuille’s law. So, one can
determine the pore conductance distribution f(g) from f(r)/(dg/dr). For further detail, see Hunt
et al. (2014).
Following Ghanbarian et al. (2016), one may replace the percolation threshold pc = 2/Z in
Eq. (5.1) by the critical saturation Sc, the minimum amount of saturation required to form
sample-spanning cluster for percolation, and accordingly (Z/2 – 1) by (1 – Sc)/Sc. Therefore,
Eq. (5.1) changes to
gmax
gmin
ge − g
g + Sc 1 − Sc ge
f g dg = 0 5 2
In Eq. (5.2), Sc can be estimated from mercury saturation SHg at the inflection point on the mercury
intrusion porosimetry curve (Ghanbarian and Javadpour 2017). The greater the critical saturation
Sc, the smaller the effective pore conductance ge, and accordingly, the smaller the permeability.
It is well documented in the literature that estimations of EMT are accurate as long as the pore
conductance distribution is not too broad (Adler and Berkowitz 2000; Doyen 1988; Ghanbarian and
Daigle 2016; Ghanbarian and Javadpour 2017; Ghanbarian et al. 2016, 2019, 2020; Koplik 1981).
For example, numerical simulations of Adler and Berkowitz (2000) in three-dimensional lattices,
randomly composed of bonds chosen from a lognormal distribution, demonstrated that the EMA
results under fully saturated conditions would be accurate as long as the lognormal distribution
standard deviation σ < 1.
5.3 Single-Phase Gas Permeability
5.3.1 Gas Permeability in a Cylindrical Tube
Let us assume that gas transport at nanoscales is mainly controlled by slip flow and Knudsen
diffusion, and these two mechanisms contribute in parallel. Accordingly, gas permeability in a
single, straight, and perfectly cylindrical nanotube with radius R is given by (Javadpour 2009)

where M is molar mass, T is temperature, Rg is gas constant, μ is gas viscosity, ρ is gas density, p is
pore pressure, and TMAC is tangential momentum accommodation coefficient whose value
theoretically ranges between 0 and 1, depending on gas type, temperature, pressure and surface
roughness (Arkilic et al. 1997).
5.3 Single-Phase Gas Permeability 955.3.2 Pore Pressure-Dependent Gas Permeability in Tight Rocks
To estimate gas permeability from pore-throat radius distribution, porosity, tortuosity, and gas
characteristics, one may apply concepts from EMT. Combining the EMT permeability with the
Javadpour (2009) model gives

where Cs is the pore shape factor equal to 8 in cylindrical pores, rb is the pore-body radius, re is the
effective pore-throat radius, τ is the tortuosity (> 1), and φ is total porosity.
The value of TMAC required to determine F may be approximated using the following empirical
relationship (Agrawal and Prabhu 2008)
TMAC = 1 − log 1+ K0 7

in which Kn, Knudsen number, is determined from (Heidemann et al. 1984)
Kn = kBT

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and dm is the collision diameter of gas molecule (dm = 0.3 and
0.38 nm for nitrogen and methane, respectively).
To evaluate the accuracy of our pore pressure-dependent permeability model, we compare it with
experimental data, PNMs, and lattice-Boltzmann simulations presented in the literature listed in
Table 5.2.
5.3.3 Comparison with Experiments
Experimental data used in this study are from Nazari Moghaddam and Jamiolahmady (2016b), who
reported measurements on three shale rock samples from the Eagle Ford, Pierre, and Barnett for￾mations. Mercury intrusion porosimetry data measured in the range of 0–380 MPa (0–55,000 psi)
were used to determine the pore throat-size distribution for each sample. The critical saturation Sc
for percolation determined from mercury saturation at the inflection point of the mercury intrusion
porosimetry curve was 0.13, 0.35, and 0.27 for the Eagle Ford, Pierre, and Barnett samples,
respectively.
The lognormal probability density function fitted to the pore throat-size distribution and results
of the pore pressure-dependent permeability estimations are presented in Figure 5.1 for the Eagle
Ford, Pierre, and Barnett shales.
As can be observed, EMT, Eq. (5.5), underestimated the pore pressure dependence of the perme￾ability for Eagle Ford with a factor of 6, while it estimated k more accurately, within a factor of three
of the measured value, for the Pierre and Barnett samples. One possible source of error in the per￾meability estimation may be rough approximation of tortuosity whose value was set equal to 2.
We should note that the permeability of the Eagle Ford sample is in the order of milliDarcies
(mD), while it is in the order of microDarcies (μD) for the Pierre and Barnett samples. The critical
saturation in the Eagle Ford sample is remarkably less than that in the Pierre and Barnett samples,
which might be an indication of microfractures in the Eagle Ford sample, associated with micro￾fossils, fragmentary fossil material, or pyrite framboids that are not reflected in the pore throat-size
distribution (Ghanbarian and Javadpour 2017).

98 5 Modeling Gas Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir Rocksagreement between k = 0.91 D, the estimated permeability, and k = 0.97 D, the simulated one, at
p = 10 MPa, indicates that Eq. (5.5) accurately upscaled permeability in the three-dimensional net￾work constructed of cylindrical pores whose size varies in a limited range (5 ≤ r < 25 μm).
5.3.5 Comparaison with Lattice-Boltzmann Simulations
We used Reconstruction 1 from Landry et al. (2016), composed of spheres of radii ranged from 4.5 to
6 nm with a porosity of 0.583. Landry et al. (2016) applied the local-effective-viscosity multi￾relaxation-time lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate methane permeability at 400 K temperature
and various pore pressures between 5 and 35 MPa (725–5076 psi). The critical saturation Sc = 0.25
for percolation was determined from the mercury intrusion porosimetry data simulated by the full
morphology model flooding algorithm.
The pore throat-size distribution as well as the simulated permeabilities versus pore pressure are
presented in Figure 5.3. The estimated permeabilities via Eq. (5.5) and its factor of three boundaries
(denoted by dashed lines) are also shown in Figure 5.3. Results indicate that the estimations are in
good agreement with the lattice-Boltzmann simulations, although Eq. (5.5) slightly overesti￾mated k.
Another set of lattice-Boltzmann simulation was selected from Chen et al. (2015), who recon￾structed a shale medium using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on SEM images
of organic content of a shale sample from Sichuan Basin, China. The pore size in the reconstructed
sample was in the range of 5–80 nm with porosity ϕ = 0.191. Methane permeability at T = 383 K was
simulated by the lattice-Boltzmann method adapted to model fluid flow and Knudsen diffusion.
Chen et al. (2015) applied a connected phase labeling algorithm, checked the local connectivity,
and reported a connectivity of 98% for the Sichuan Basin sample indicated Sc ≈ 0.02.
The pore throat-size distribution of the Sichuan Basin sample as well as the lattice-Boltzmann
permeability simulations are shown in Figure 5.4. As can be seen, the estimated permeabilities
via Eq. (5.5) agree well with the simulated values. The reported tortuosity value by Chen et al.
(2015) is greater than that for other samples listed in Table 5.2. However, τ = 12.2 resulted in accu￾rate estimation of gas permeability (Figure 5.4). This clearly confirms that precise quantification of
the pore pressure dependence of gas permeability in shales requires accurate characterization of the
pore structure and microscopic topological properties of the pore space.

Non-slip boundary conditions may not accurately capture the physics of flow, particularly at the
nano- and micro-scale levels (Karniadakis et al. 2006). In unconventional reservoir rocks, slippage
of gas molecules on surface walls facilitates gas flow, and its effect should be incorporated into the
modeling of gas transport. The hydraulic conductance (gh) of a cylindrical pore of radius R and
length l filled with a gas of viscosity μ is described in Eq. (5.8) (Brown et al. 1946; Javadpour 2009):

100 5 Modeling Gas Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir Rocksin which F is the dimensionless coefficient for slippage and given by Eq. (5.4). Agrawal and Prabhu
(2008) proposed an empirical relationship to estimate TMAC from Knudsen number Kn. However,
it returns negative TMAC values for Kn > 23.1. For the sake of simplicity, one may approximately
set TMAC = 0.8 (Javadpour 2009; Karniadakis et al. 2006).
Ghanbarian and Javadpour (2017) employed Eq. (5.8) in combination with Knudsen diffusion
and the EMA to model single-phase gas permeability in shales and found good match between the￾ory and measurement/simulation.
5.4.2 Molecular Flow in a Cylindrical Pore
When the mean free path of gas molecules is of the same order or greater than the pore diameter,
the majority of molecules move along straight trajectories until hitting a wall. Under the range of
relatively large Knudsen number conditions, gas molecules move independently of each other, and
collisions between the molecules happen rarely. This type of flow, called molecular, is only caused
by the kinetic energy of the molecules (Halwidl 2016; Livesey 1998).
The molecular conductance (gm) in a cylindrical pore of radius R and length l is (Knudsen 1909;
Livesey 1998)
gm = απR2 RgT
2πMm
5 9
in which α is
α =1+ y2 − y 1 + y2 −
2 − y2 1 + y2 + y3 − 2 2
4 5y 1 + y2 − 4 5 ln y + 1 + y2
5 10
where y = l/2R.
5.4.3 Total Gas Flow in a Cylindrical Pore
Assuming that gas flow is mainly controlled by hydraulic flow and molecular flow (two mechan￾isms contributing in parallel) in a single cylindrical tube with radius R and length l, the total con￾ductance (gt) at the pore scale is given by
gt = gh + gm = F πR4
8μl + απR2 RgT
2πMm
5 11
Although the linear superposition of transport mechanisms i.e. molecular flow and hydraulic
flow employed here to determine the total gas conductance is a first-order approximation, it has
been previously validated in the literature to be accurate enough (see Xu et al. (2018) and references
therein).
5.4.4 Gas Relative Permeability in Tight Rocks
We presume that each pore is occupied by either water (or oil) or gas, and all pores with size r and
greater are accessible to gas. If capillary pressure curve is not available, then the gas saturation, Sg,
corresponding to pore radius r can be determined by integrating r
3
f(r) between r and rmax and nor￾malizing that as follows:

5 12
where Sgr is the residual gas saturation formed from gas trapped in some subset of the pores in the
range [rmin, rmax].
Under fully saturated conditions (Sg = 1), the effective conductance ge is given by
gtmax
gtmin
ge Sg = 1 − gt
gt +
1 − Sgc
Sgc
ge Sg = 1
f gt dgt = 0 5 13
where gtmin and gtmax are, respectively, the minimum and maximum total conductances in the pore
network. Recall that the actual pore size distribution and the total pore conductance distribution
are interrelated via f(gt)dgt = f(r)dr.
Under partially saturated conditions, one has

ge(Sg = 1) and ge(Sg) are computed by numerically solving Eqs. (5.13) and (5.14), respectively.
Since gas permeability is proportional to the effective conductance, one may define krg as
krg = kg Sg
kg Sg = 1 = ge Sg
ge Sg = 1
5 15
Theoretically, one expects krg to vanish as Sg tends to its critical value, Sgc. It is well-known that
EMT is not accurate near the critical gas saturation. Hence, one may apply EMT at high to inter￾mediate gas saturations and use the universal power–law scaling from percolation theory at low gas
saturations close to Sgc. The crossover between the two occurs at some gas saturation Sgx.
The universal power–law scaling from percolation theory is
krg = k0 Sg − Sgc
t
, Sg > Sgc 5 16
where the scaling exponent t = 2 in three dimensions, and k0 is a numerical prefactor.
The value of k0 is determined by setting Eqs. (5.15) and (5.16) equal at Sgx for which one needs to
set the first derivative of the two equations equal. Since Eq. (5.15) is an implicit function of Sg, one
should numerically compute the values of k0 and Sgx (Ghanbarian et al. 2020).
It is noted that Eq. (5.16) has been successfully applied to model gas relative permeability over the
entire range of gas saturation in conventional porous media (Ghanbarian-Alavijeh and Hunt 2012;
Ghanbarian et al. 2015a; Hunt 2005; Hunt et al. 2014). It was also combined with the linear scaling
law from EMT by Ghanbarian et al. (2015b, 2018) to model diffusion in porous materials.
To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed theoretic gas relative permeability model, we compare it
with experimental data and pore-network simulations summarized in Table 5.3.
5.4.5 Comparison with Experiments
We first present the obtained results for the Bennion and Bachu (2007) dataset. Figure 5.5 displays
the pore size distributions and Sg-krg curves for both Calmar and Colorado shale samples. As
shown, pore sizes span near one order of magnitude for Calmar shale, while more than three orders

Figure 5.5 The pore size distribution, derived from the measured mercury intrusion porosimetry curves
(on the left) and the estimated gas relative permeability curve (on the right) for Calmar and Colorado shales
from Bennion and Bachu (2007). The black and gray lines represent the results of effective-medium
approximation (Eq. 5.15) and universal power–law scaling from percolation theory (Eq. 5.16), respectively.
Unfilled circles represent krg measured at p = 12.25 MPa (Calmar) and 20 MPa (Colorado). Note that Sgc = 0 for
Calmar was determined from the actual krg measurements, while for Colorado, Sgc = 0.30 was estimated from
the inflection point of the measured MICP curve. Source: Data from Bennion and Bachu (2007).
5.4 Gas Relative Permeability 103of magnitude for Colorado shale. This means that the latter is more complex in terms of pore-scale
heterogeneity than the former. Accordingly, one should expect krg for Colorado shale to be less than
that for Calmar shale, demonstrated in Figure 5.5.
The krg estimations via the EMA (Eq. 5.15) and power–law scaling from percolation theory
(Eq. 5.16) are also given in Fig. 5.5. Results of the EMA and universal power–law scaling from per￾colation theory are denoted respectively by black and gray lines. From the measured capillary pres￾sure curve reported by Bennion and Bachu (2007) (see their figure 2), we found that the inflection
point corresponds to some mercury saturation greater than zero. However, it is clear from the krg
measurements (Figure 5.5) that Sgc = 0 for Calmar shale. Results (not shown) indicated that Sgc > 0
would cause krg underestimation via our model. Although in the following we show that estimating
Sgc from the inflection point of mercury intrusion porosimetry curve results into accurate predic￾tion of krg, further investigation is required to address alternative methods for estimating Sgc in
unconventional reservoir rocks.
Figure 5.5 also shows results for the Colorado shale sample for which we found Sgc = 0.3, deter￾mined from the inflection point of MICP curve. As can be seen, the estimated krg curve agrees well
with the measured data. For Colorado shale, we also found Sgx = 0.87 – the crossover gas saturation
at which the EMA scaling switches to the universal power–law scaling from percolation theory –
nearly twice greater than that for Calmar shale (Sgx = 0.43). The crossover point is non-universal
and its value is a function of pore space characteristics such as pore size distribution broadness as
well as percolation threshold (or equivalently here, critical gas saturation) (Hunt et al. 2014). This
means that one should expect Sgx to vary from one rock sample to another.
For the Colorado shale sample with Sgc = 0.3 (Figure 5.5, bottom right), we found a sharp switch
from the percolation theory scaling to the EMA one. As stated earlier, in this case, Sgx corresponds
to the gas saturation at which the difference in slopes of Eqs. (5.15) and (5.16) is minimal.
Ghanbarian et al. (2018) also reported such an abrupt transition for gas relative permeability
measurements in sand packs.
Figure 5.6 shows the estimated krg curves for the tight-gas sand sample from Dacy (2010). As can
be observed, pore sizes span two orders of magnitude. Recall that in this dataset, gas permeability

Sgc = 0.08 was estimated from the inflection point of the measured MICP curve. Source: Data from Dacy (2010).
104 5 Modeling Gas Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir Rocksvalues were normalized to that measured at Sg = 0.35. Our results indicate that the proposed model,
Eq. (5.15) in combination with Eq. (5.16), reduced to the universal power–law scaling from
percolation theory shown in red in Figure 5.6. We also found that estimating Sgc from the mercury
saturation corresponding to the inflection point on the MICP curve resulted into accurate
estimation of krg for this dataset.
Results for the tight-gas siltstone from Yassin et al. (2016) are presented in Figure 5.7. Pore radius
ranges between 0.0023 and 0.24 μm, spanning near two orders of magnitude, and r = 0.1 μm cor￾responds to the mode of the pore size distribution. Comparison of the estimated krg curve with the
measured one obtained from three Montney samples is also shown in Figure 5.7. We found that our
model with Sgc = 0.26 estimated krg accurately from the pore size distribution. Yassin et al. (2016)
developed a dual-wettability krg model based on the bundle of capillary tubes approach and, more
specifically, the Purcell (1949) model. However, they overestimated krg and had to replace the tor￾tuosity factor (1 – Sw)
2 with (1 – Sw)
3 to obtain better match between the measured and estimated krg
(see their figure 9b–d). Interestingly, our model estimated krg precisely without adjusting/tuning
any parameters. We also emphasize that all parameters in our theoretic approach are physically
meaningful.
In Figure 5.8, we present the obtained results for the Eagle Ford and Pierre samples from Nazari
Moghaddam and Jamiolahmady (2019a, 2019b). Similar to the tight-gas siltstone sample shown in
Figure 5.4, the Eagle Ford and Pierre pore size distributions are negatively skewed, indicating the
non-trivial contribution of smaller pores in such unconventional reservoir rocks. Yassin et al. (2016)
also noticed a long tail at the lower end of the pore size distribution. For Eagle Ford shale, the pore
radius ranges between 0.002 and 0.2 μm, spanning two orders of magnitude. However, for Pierre
shale, r ranges between 0.002 and 0.08 μm, spanning less than two orders of magnitude.
Figure 5.8 shows the estimated and measured gas relative permeabilities against gas saturation
for the Eagle Ford and Pierre shale samples. Similar to the Colorado shale and tight-gas siltstone
samples, the crossover gas saturation Sgx is around 0.8 (Sgx = 0.79 and 0.84, respectively, for Eagle
Ford and Pierre).

5.4 Gas Relative Permeability 105As can be seen in Figure 5.8, for Eagle Ford shale, krg estimates are relatively accurate at low gas
saturations. However, deviations between theory and experiment are observed at intermediate Sg
values. Overall, the proposed model, Eq. (5.15) in combination with Eq. (5.16), underestimated krg
for this case. This underestimation is in accord with the findings from Ghanbarian and Javadpour
(2017), who estimated single-phase permeability using the EMT on the same sample. Those authors
found that the EMT underestimated gas permeability and attributed that to the presence of micro￾fractures in the sample that was not captured via MICP. They stated that “… the critical saturation
in the Eagle Ford sample is remarkably less than that in the Pierre and Barnett samples, which
might be an indication of microfractures in the Eagle Ford sample, associated with coring processes
that are not reflected in the pore throat-size distribution.” However, our theoretic model estimated
krg accurately over the entire range of gas saturation for Pierre shale. This means that if Sgc can be
estimated with high accuracy and the pore size distribution can be determined precisely, and our
model would be able to estimate krg accurately.

106 5 Modeling Gas Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir RocksIn most datasets studied here, krg was experimentally measured at low to intermediate gas satura￾tions e.g. Sg < 0.5. Therefore, model evaluation at high Sg values is still required. We address the
predictability of the proposed model, Eq. (5.15) in combination with Eq. (5.16), at high gas satura￾tions using the pore-network simulations in the following section.
5.4.6 Comparison with Pore-Network Simulations
In Figure 5.9, we show the pore size distribution, estimated krg curve at p = 25 MPa, and pore￾network simulations from Song et al. (2018). This figure demonstrates that the proposed krg model
estimated gas relative permeability accurately over the entire range of gas saturation. More specif￾ically, we found that Sgc = 0.05, estimated from the fraction of dead-end pores, is in well agreement
with the simulations.
Figure 5.9 also shows that although the pore-network simulations vary by pore pressure, differ￾ences in krg for various pore pressure values are not substantially remarkable, particularly at low
and high gas saturations. This is consistent with two-dimensional simulations of Wang and Sheng
(2018), who reported similar krg values for p = 10 and 20 MPa (see their figures 7 and 8). Similar
results were also theoretically obtained by Zhang et al. (2018). Huang et al. (2016) also found that
the relative permeability curves for the boundary pressure difference of 0.05 and 5 MPa were sim￾ilar. However, they reported that the curves for 5 and 500 MPa cases were different, particularly at
low and intermediate gas saturations (see their figure 12). As Huang et al. (2016) stated, this might
be because at lower pore pressures gas transport is dominated by capillary forces, while at high p
values viscous forces dominate.
Figure 5.10 shows the pore size distribution as well as the estimated and simulated gas relative
permeability curves for the pore-network model of Wang and Sheng (2019). Pore size spans near
one order of magnitude with a weighted arithmetic mean of 98 nm. This value is very close to that
Wang and Sheng (2019) reported (i.e., 110 nm). As can be seen, the EMT, shown in black, estimated
gas relative permeability at high gas saturations accurately. The universal power–law scaling from

5.4 Gas Relative Permeability 107percolation theory, shown in gray, also estimated krg at low to intermediate Sg values precisely. We
should point out that the value of critical gas saturation for this dataset was not available. We,
accordingly, had to determine its value (Sgc = 0.43) from the simulated krg curve.
5.5 Conclusions
In this study, we used concepts from the effective-medium approximation to upscale gas permea￾bility k in shales. Given that permeability is mainly controlled by slip flow and Knudsen diffusion,
we modified the Doyen (1988) model and proposed Eq. (5.5) to calculate k from pore-size distribu￾tion, pore connectivity, tortuosity, porosity, and gas characteristics such as gas type, temperature,
molar mass, and viscosity. Comparison with six datasets including three experiments, one pore￾network model, and two lattice-Boltzmann simulations showed that the proposed upscaling model
estimated gas permeability in shales accurately, within a factor of three of the measurements. We
should, however, caution that our model provides accurate results as long as pore throat-size dis￾tribution is not too broad. Results also showed that our model is most sensitive to the effective pore
radius re that was determined using the effective-medium approximation, Eq. (5.3), and tortuosity
that was approximated by 2 (τ = 2) in all datasets except in the Chen et al. (2015) dataset in which
τ = 12.2 was reported by those authors.
In this study, we applied concepts from the effective-medium approximation and universal
power–law scaling from percolation theory to develop a theoretical gas relative permeability krg
model in shales and tight porous rocks. For this purpose, we assumed that gas transport is mainly
controlled by two mechanisms contributing in parallel: (i) hydraulic flow and (ii) molecular flow.
Our proposed model estimates krg from pore space properties such as pore size distribution, pore
connectivity (reflected in critical gas saturation), and porosity as well as gas characteristics e.g. gas
type, viscosity, temperature, and molar mass. To evaluate the proposed theoretic approach, we

6.1 Introduction
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a resonance phenomenon between electromagnetic waves
and atomic nuclei. After the discovery of NMR in condensed matter in 1945 (Bloch et al. 1946;
Purcell et al. 1946), NMR has been widely used to investigate matter in a multitude of areas,
encompassing physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. NMR was also quickly adapted to
petrophysical laboratory research and subsequently developed downhole logging tools for in situ
reservoir evaluation (Brown and Gamson 1960; Dunn et al. 2002).
A rigorous discussion of NMR physics is deeply rooted in quantum mechanics, especially when
the fundamental of NMR relaxation mechanism is considered (Abragam 1961); however, for most
applications of NMR in petroleum industry, classical physics using magnetism vectors suffices. In
this chapter, we first give a brief introduction about basic NMR physics, including both quantum
and classical mechanical descriptions. We then show a few examples of NMR applications in
unconventional source rock reservoirs. NMR applications in formation rocks comprise two major
branches: downhole logging and laboratory measurement of retrieved rock samples. Here we do
not intend for a comprehensive review of NMR and its applications in measurements of reservoir
properties, but to present some recent NMR technology development that extend the application of
NMR for the investigation of unconventional source rocks.
6.2 Basic NMR Physics
This section describes the fundamentals most relevant to the application of NMR in formation
rocks. The focus is to provide a correct understanding of the basic physics for interested readers.
Sections 6.2.1–6.2.3 are the quantum mechanics description of basic NMR physics and can be
skipped for the uninterested reader.

The atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Each proton and neutron possess a spin 1/2.
Each nucleus has a specific spin quantum number S, which is determined by the enclosed specific
combination of protons and neutrons. Spin is an intrinsic and a purely quantum mechanics
property. It has no classical analog and does not originate from particle rotation. Spin is a type
of angular momentum, expressed as a vector S for a nucleus with spin quantum number S. The
magnitude of the nuclear spin angular momentum S is given by
S = ℏ S S + 1 , 6 1
in which ℏ = 1.054 × 10−34J/S is the reduced Planck’s constant. Quantum mechanics restricts
such that only one of the three Cartesian components of S can be specified simultaneously
with S . Normally, the z-component of S is specified
SZ = mℏ, 6 2
with m taking quantum number, m = (−S, − S + 1, …, S − 1, S), for a total 2S + 1 states. Thus, S is
quantized: its magnitude is a constant and z-component takes several discrete values.
For applications in formation rocks, the most important nucleus is hydrogen (1
H), whose nucleus
contains a single proton and has a total spin quantum number S = 1/2. Hydrogen is the most sen￾sitive isotope and a major element of both water and hydrocarbon. Other nuclei, such as 13C, 23Na,
and 31P can also be used to investigate rock formations but are not generally used in unconventional
source rocks. Hereafter, only hydrogen is discussed. For hydrogen, the z-component of angular
momentum has two states, −1/2ℏ and 1/2ℏ.
6.2.2 Nuclear Zeeman Splitting and NMR
The nuclear spin angular momentum S possesses a magnetic moment μ which is proportional to
the angular momentum
μ = γS 6 3
where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant for a specific nucleus. For 1
H, γH = 4.258 × 107 Hz/T.
Because the spin angular momentum is quantized, so is the nuclear magnetic moment. For hydro￾gen, the z-component of spin magnetic moment
μz = − 1 2ℏγ
1 2ℏγ
6 4
The two quantum states have the same energy and thus are twofold degenerated. The degeneracy
breaks when the nucleus is placed in and interacts with a magnetic field B0. Usually, the magnetic
field B0 is chosen to along z-axis, and the energy from the interaction is
Em = − μ B0 = − mℏγB0 6 5
The splitting between the nuclear spin levels is called nuclear Zeeman splitting, which is the source
and subject of all the NMR spectroscopy (Abragam 1961). Considering Eqs. (6.4) and (6.5), the
energy difference between the two energy levels for spin 1/2 is
ΔE = ℏγB0 6 6
114 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir RocksThe quantization of hydrogen angular momentum is shown in Figure 6.1a, and the hydrogen
nuclear Zeeman levels as a function of strength of the applied magnetic field B0 is illustrated in
Figure 6.1b. Note that Figure 6.1 also shows that the nuclear spin angular momentum is neither
parallel nor anti-parallel to the magnetic field.
Transitions between the two energy levels can be induced by applying an electromagnetic wave.
The photon energy ℏω0 required to excite a transition must be equal to the difference of the two
energy levels, aka, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The frequency of the electromagnetic wave
is then required as
ω0 = γB0 6 7
in unit rad/s. This frequency, also called the Larmor frequency, is the frequency at which the
nuclear spin angular momentum processes on the cone shown in Figure 6.1a. The frequency of
all current NMRs falls into the range of radio frequency (r.f.) and the electromagnetic wave applied
to excite NMR is often called r.f. field.
6.2.3 Nuclear Magnetization
For an ensemble of nuclear spins in macroscopic condensed matter, for example 1
H in a water
sample, in a static magnetic field, the net magnetic moment M is the vector summation of the
magnetic moment of individual nuclei μ. At equilibrium, the transverse components of different
nuclei are uncorrelated and sum to zero. For the z-component in the direction of the B0, more
protons are in the lower energy state than in the higher energy state, thus resulting in a net
equilibrium magnetization. According to Boltzmann’s fundamental distribution law, the
population of the energy levels are proportional to exp(−Em/kBT) = exp(γℏm B0/kBT) with
kB = 1.38 × 10−23/m2
/kg/s−2
/k−1 the Boltzmann constant. The net magnetization of a sample
containing Ns spins in unit volume (number density) at equilibrium is then (Abragam 1961)

6.2 Basic NMR Physics 115The magnetization in Eq. (6.8) shows that the NMR signal is proportional to the strength of static
magnetic field B0, the number density Ns, and inversely to the temperature T.
6.2.4 Bloch Equations and NMR Relaxation
For noninteracting spin 1/2 nuclei, a vector model based on the Bloch Equations is sufficient to
describe the behavior of the macroscopic magnetization for all the NMR experiments (Bloch
1956). A detailed introduction of complete Bloch Equations is beyond the scope of this chapter
(interested readers are referred to Abragam (1961)).
Magnetization as a vector in a coordinate frame has three components, Mx, My, and Mz. At
equilibrium, the magnetization in Eq. (6.8) lies along the applied static magnetic field B0 or the
z-axis. In this notation, the z-component of magnetization Mz = M0 and Mx = My = 0, as illustrated
in Figure 6.2a. Mz is also referred as longitudinal magnetization, Mx and My as transverse
magnetization. In all current NMR experimental setups, only the transverse components of the
magnetization are measured. Therefore, no signal can be detected at equilibrium state.
Applying an r.f. pulse to the sample with a frequency equal or close to the Larmor frequency
excites the nuclear spins and rotate the macroscopic magnetization away from the z-axis. In
general, an r.f. pulse with intensity B1 and length τ is applied along x-axis that rotates the
magnetization away from z-axis with an angle θ = γB1τ, as shown in a rotating reference frame
of Larmor frequency in Figure 6.2b. In the following discussions, all the transverse magnetizations,
or signals are in the rotating reference frame. Since only the transverse component of the
magnetization can be detected, the maximum NMR signal is then M0 sin θ.
After the excitation by an r.f. pulse, the nuclear spins need to re-establish thermal equilibrium, as
shown in Figure 6.2a, which is the most stable state. In the vector model, two relaxation time
constants were introduced to describe how the excited state returns to equilibrium: longitudinal
relaxation time T1 and transverse relaxation time T2 (Bloch 1956). T1 and T2 are also called
spin-lattice relaxation time and spin-spin relaxation time, respectively. Nuclear spin relaxation

detected. The maximum signal detected is M0 sin θ.
116 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir Rocksis the result of a fluctuating local magnetic field on the nuclear spin by the neighboring nuclear
spins (Bloembergen et al. 1948). The mobility of the molecules has a determinant effect on the
relaxation time T1 and T2 (Abragam 1961). Nuclear spins in solids have very short T2 relaxation
times and cannot be studied at low magnetic fields. NMR for petrophysical measurement is mainly
used to investigate the mobile molecules in liquid and gas phases in formation rocks.
The equations governing the magnetizations as a function of time t to establish equilibrium after
excitation are
Mz = M0 1− 1− cos θ exp − t
T1
6 9
My = M0 sin θ exp − t

6 10
The relaxation process ensures that at sufficiently long times, the net magnetization in the z-axis
grows to M0 and the transverse components go to zero, i.e. the equilibrium state. In practical
applications, t is considered sufficiently long for the spin system to re-established equilibrium when
t ≥ 5T1. In the majority of NMR experiments, the r.f. pulse is chosen to such that θ = 90 , for
maximized transverse signal and the largest detection sensitivity. This r.f. pulse is called a 90 -pulse
or π/2-pulse. Similarly, an r.f. pulse that rotates the magnetization by θ = 180 is called a 180 -pulse
or π-pulse.
6.2.5 Simple NMR Experiments: Free Induction Decay and CPMG Echoes
The inhomogeneity of static magnetic field B0 also induces decay of the transverse magnetization of
nuclear spins. As a result, the apparent transverse relaxation time T∗

This inhomogeneity has no effects on the longitudinal relaxation T1.
After a 90 pulse, the NMR signal is
My = M0 exp − t

6 12
This detected NMR signal is called Free Induction Decay (FID). In pure liquid samples at high
magnetic field strength the inhomogeneity of the B0 is small and therefore 1 TB0inhom
2 is small or
negligible in Eq. (6.11). However, for application of low-field NMR to fluids in formation rocks, two
sources can generate significant static field homogeneity. First, the applied static field can be
inhomogeneous, and this is especially true for NMR downhole logging tools. Second, magnetic
susceptibility effects from the rock minerals can generate additional spatial inhomogeneity. This
is the main contributor of inhomogeneity in laboratory NMR experiments. In both cases,
1 TB0inhom
2 can become the dominant term in Eq. (6.11).
The most vital NMR parameter is the intrinsic T2, which contains petrophysical information.
A modified spin-echo (Hahn 1950) pulse sequence, called CPMG (Carr and Purcell 1954; Meiboom
and Gill 1958), can eliminate the magnetization decay caused by static field inhomogeneity. The
CPMG pulse sequence applies a carefully timed series of 180 -pulse after the 90 -pulse excitation
of the equilibrium magnetization, as
6.2 Basic NMR Physics 117tw − 90o
x − τ
2 − 180o
y − τ
2 N
6 13
In this sequence, tw is a waiting time to allow the nuclear spin to establish equilibrium with a net
z-magnetization of M0, and it should satisfy tw ≥ 5T1. The 90 -pulse applied on x-axis rotates the
magnetization to y-axis. A duration τ/2 allows the magnetization to decay with the apparent trans￾verse relaxation time T∗
2. However, the 180o
y − τ 2 refocus the decay from the field inhomogeneity
and generate a spin-echo (Hahn 1950). Right at the end of the second τ/2, one data point is acquired.
At time τ, the magnetization decays with intrinsic T2. The τ 2 − 180o
y − τ 2 is repeated N times and
N data points are acquired for the NMR signal. The acquired NMR CPMG echoes are
My nτ = M0 exp − nτ

6 14
with n = 1, 2, …, N. Almost all the current NMR applications in formation rocks are acquired using
CPMG pulse sequence. As a result, the inhomogeneity of the static field can be ignored.
6.2.6 NMR Relaxation of a Pure Fluid in a Rock Pore
NMR transverse relaxation time, T2, of a fluid in a pore can be expressed as (Brown and Gamson
1960; Kleinberg et al. 1994):
1
T2
= ρ2
A
V +
1
T2b
+
1
T2D
6 15
The three terms on the right in Eq. (6.15) represent three different relaxation mechanisms, which
are summed to give the overall transverse relaxation time T2 at the fast diffusion regime
(Brownstein and Tarr 1979). The first term is from surface relaxation in which ρ2, A, and V are sur￾face relaxivity, surface area, and pore volume, respectively. The second term is the bulk relaxation
time of fluid, which comes from the interaction of intramolecular spins. It is important to note that
nanoconfined fluids also have additional relaxation mechanisms from intermolecular spin interac￾tion on the bulk relaxation (Chen et al. 2020). However, the second term is generally on the order of
magnitude of seconds for non-viscous liquids and high-pressure gas. It is typically two orders of
magnitude smaller than the first term in unconventional source rocks and can generally be ignored.
The third term is from signal dephasing in a gradient magnetic field. It may be worth noting that the
third term is not a traditional relaxation mechanism, which is always the result of a fluctuating
interaction to a nuclear spin (Abragam 1961). While this term’s contribution can be ignored in
a laboratory setup, it is important in downhole logging tools because of the large gradient in the
static magnetic field. Consequently, for laboratory studies Eq. (6.15) is simplified to
1
T2
= ρ2
A
V
6 16
In this case, the relaxation is only sensitive to the pore surface-to-volume ratio A/V and pore surface
relaxivity ρ2. For some simple, well-defined pore shapes, Eq. (6.16) can be further expressed as
1
T2
= ρ2
α
R
6 17
where R is the pore size and α is 1, 2, or 3 for slit, cylinder, or spherical pore, respectively. For rocks
formed with packed grains of different sorting and shapes that have undergone diagenesis, α is
clearly not a constant; but it should not change by an order of magnitude either. Therefore, the
118 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir Rocksmeasured relaxation time of fluid in a pore is largely determined by the surface relaxivity ρ2 and
pore-body size R. Surface relaxivity ρ2 depends on the surface mineralogy, especially paramagnetic
minerals. If ρ2 is approximately constant for a homogeneous rock, T2 responds to the pore-body
size, and the NMR measurement reflects the pore-size distribution in a rock.
6.2.7 Measured NMR CPMG Echoes in a Formation Rock
CPMG is the mostly widely used method of NMR application in formation rocks. In a real rock, the
pores are nonuniform and have a distribution of different sizes. As a result, the measured NMR
signal is a summation of fluids in different pores with different relaxation times. The CPMG echoes
in a rock sample are a superposition of all pores and can be expressed as
My nτ =
i
Mi
0 exp − nτ
Ti
2
6 18
in which Mi
0 and Ti
2 are the magnetization and transverse relaxation time of the ith pore,
respectively. Mi
0 is determined by the total amount of fluid in the pore and Ti
2 depends on the pore
size. The summation in Eq. (6.18) extends to all the pores in a sample. The distribution of the
magnetization according to the transverse relaxation time then gives the distribution of fluids in
different-sized pores, which is obtained by inversion of the measured NMR signal in Eq. (6.18),
discussed in the following section 6.2.8.
6.2.8 Inversion
The task is to obtain the distribution of magnetization according to different transverse relaxation

are used. The exponential term in Eq. (6.20) can be formally replaced with x variables defined as

120 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir Rocks6.2.9 Data from NMR Measurement
The measured NMR signals must be calibrated using a standard sample to determine the absolute
amount of fluid in a sample. For most current laboratory or downhole logging NMR instruments,
the calibration is done semiautomatically, i.e. data reported from the NMR instruments are cali￾brated to absolute fluid volume using a standard sample and procedure. For simplicity, here, we
do not distinguish the nuclear magnetization and the specific volume of fluid it represents and
directly use M0 as the measured volume in NMR experiments hereafter. In this case, T2 spectrum

In addition to porosity, NMR also measures the fluid properties and sizes of the pores containing
these fluids through the measured T2 distribution. From this information, NMR has been used to
estimate or infer (Coates et al. 1999; Freedman 2006)

6.3 NMR Logging for Unconventional Source Rock Reservoirs
6.3.1 Brief Introduction of Unconventional Source Rocks
Unconventional source rocks are formations where light hydrocarbons were generated and then
partially trapped in rock pore system. Hydrocarbon generation depends on the quality and content
of organic matter and burial history (Vandenbroucke and Largeau 2007). The organic-rich source
rock reservoirs were once considered impossible to produce commercially but now contribute more
than 50% of oil and gas production in the United States (U.S.EIA 2016a, 2016b). The rising global
importance of hydrocarbon production from source rocks is due to the combination of horizontal
drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing.
The characterization of the pore system in unconventional source rock formations is essential for
estimating the original hydrocarbon-in-place and production. Pores have been observed in both
organic matter and the inorganic matrix from focused ion beam (FIB) scanning electron micros￾copy (SEM) (Loucks et al. 2009). Figure 6.4 shows a gray-scale three-dimensional (3D) FIB-SEM
of a source rock sample. In the image, the pores, organic matter, and inorganic matrix are identi￾fiable by their distinct colors (Durand et al. 1980). The 3D FIB-SEM illustrates an important char￾acteristic of source rock: the porosity predominantly occurs within the organic matter with very
limited matrix porosity in the sample. Organic pores are likely hydrocarbon wet and inorganic
pores water wet. The organic porosity is the result of the maturation process as hydrocarbons
are being generated and stored (Loucks et al. 2009). The inorganic porosity related to the matrix
is mainly controlled by the burial and compaction processes.
6.3 NMR Logging for Unconventional Source Rock Reservoirs 121Two additional characteristics of source rock pore system can also be observed or deduced from
the 3D FIB-SEM. First, the majority of the pores are on the nanometer scale. As a result, adsorption
and capillary condensation are important physical mechanisms in estimating the storage and
hydrocarbon-in-place (Chen et al. 2012, 2013; Thommes et al. 2015). Second, the pore throats con￾necting pores are even smaller, which lead to matrix permeability of source rocks on the scale of
nano-Darcy. These are also the reason that drilling long horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing
are necessary to produce from unconventional source rock reservoirs.
6.3.2 NMR Measurement of Source Rocks
Many traditional measurement methods developed for conventional reservoirs need to be revisited
for application to unconventional source rocks because of the existence of organic matter as part of
the rock matrix, multiple pore types (organic pores, inorganic pores, and fractures (Loucks et al.
2012)) with varying pore wettability, and complex fluids. For example, traditionally the hydrocar￾bon content in a conventional gas reservoir can be estimated from the cross-plot of density and
neutron logs (Schön 2015). For unconventional shale gas reservoirs, the presence of organic matter,
in addition to the complex mineralogical composition, complicates both logs: the uncertainty in
quantity and density of organic matter and other heavy minerals, such as pyrite, makes the density
and porosity inaccurate. The large quantity of hydrogen in organic matter and clay-bound water
lead to the porosity estimation from neutron log much higher than the real value.
Low-field NMR is lithology independent as it only measures the mobile hydrogen, i.e. oil, gas, and
water, but not the solid organic matter. As a result, NMR has become the key technology for
evaluating unconventional source rocks including measurement of porosity; identification of fluid
types, such as water and/or hydrocarbon; and determination of the confinement environment for
fluids such as organic pores or inorganic mineral pores and bound versus mobile fluid volume.
6.3.2.1 NMR Log of a Source Rock Reservoir
NMR logs are obtained by moving an NMR logging tool along the borehole and acquiring NMR
data of the surrounding reservoir (Coates et al. 1991, 1999; Chen et al. 2003). A simple type of

spots) are in the organic matter (dark gray, labeled in the image as organic matter). The FIB-SEM is a
compilation of 1000 two-dimensional images at 5 nm resolution. The resolution per slice is 8 nm.
(Image dimensions: 14 × 10 × 8 μm).
122 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir RocksNMR log is the transverse relaxation T2 spectra measured at different depths along a well (Coates
et al. 1999; Dunn et al. 2002).
Figure 6.5 shows an example of an NMR log of a source rock section along a well. A T2 spectrum
at some selected depth is shown on the right. The T2 spectrum is characterized by a bimodal pore
system. The NMR T2 spectrum can be separated into different sections using cutoffs, as illustrated
with the dot-dashed line in Figure 6.5. This cutoff was determined based on data from core meas￾urement. The left and right of this cutoff are attributed to the formation of water and light hydro￾carbons in the formation, respectively, for this formation.
The integration of the normalized NMR spectrum at each depth of the NMR log gives the forma￾tion porosity at depth. Although the studied reservoir produce gas, the phase of the gas in the nano￾pore system in the formations is in liquid state due to the effect of capillary condensation (Chen
et al. 2012, 2013; Barsotti et al. 2016). This makes the normalization of the NMR measurement
easier for this reservoir because the hydrogen density of liquid hydrocarbon is similar to that of
water and the hydrogen index of fluid in this reservoir is thus close to 1 (Hirasaki et al. 2003).
The obtained log results can be compared and validated with laboratory-measured data on retrieved
cores from the same well. Unlike logs, which provide continuous data along a well or a section of a
well, the core measurements are only done on selected sample at certain depths from the well.
Figure 6.6 shows the porosity from NMR log versus the porosity measured from the retrieved cores
using Gas Research Institute (GRI) method in the laboratory (Luffel and Guidry 1992). Company
confidential requirement does not allow disclosure of the specific porosity data, but in Figure 6.6,
the NMR log porosity and the laboratory-measured porosity are distributed quite evenly along
the 1 : 1 dash-dot line. This indicates that NMR indeed provides reliable subsurface porosity
measurement.
The cutoff method of the NMR T2 spectra allows further quantification of partial porosity
occupied hydrocarbon and water from NMR log. In source rocks, hydrocarbon is largely stored
in the pores of organic matter, which can be estimated from 3D FIB-SEM images as shown in

against the porosity in the organic matter estimated from FIB-SEM at the same depth. The dotted
line is a linear fit to the two measurements with a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.974. This indicates
that indeed: (i) pores in the organic matter are occupied by hydrocarbon; (ii) cutoff method is a
reasonable approach to obtain hydrocarbon saturation from NMR log.
6.3.3 Pore Size Distribution in a Shale Gas Reservoir
Determining the pore size distribution in shale gas source rocks is very useful to understand fluids
distribution and flow. As shown in Eq. (6.17), the NMR transverse relaxation T2 is directly related to
the pore size. A geometric mean of the T2 spectrum expressed by Mj

obtained from a sample using FIB-SEM. Figure 6.8 shows a plot of T2 geometric mean against
the average pore radius, which is the mode value of the pore size distribution from FIB-SEM.
The distribution is a largely linear relationship, illustrating that the NMR transverse relaxation time
is indeed a reflection of the pore size distribution for the studied reservoir.
6.4 NMR Measurement of Long Whole Core
6.4.1 Issues of NMR Instrument for Long Sample
Core retrieval, preservation, and analysis are essential to reservoir development. It provides direct
evidence the presence, quantity, distribution, and deliverability of hydrocarbons. The knowledge
gained from cores enhances our ability to predict reservoir performance and to select optimal pro￾cedures to maximize profitable hydrocarbon recovery. Continuous coring is usually most desirable
to obtain complete information of a reservoir section. Cores are collected at the wellsite and
returned to the laboratory for measurement. Typically, at wellsite, drilled cores are sectioned into
1 ft length and wrapped in multiple protective layers to preserve the sample fluid in the samples.
The fluids in these whole cores are a prime target for NMR measurement. NMR has been widely
used in the laboratory to investigate core samples. However, it has only been used to study small
plugs because it has been challenging for NMR to directly acquire data on long whole cores. Here a
newly developed technology is described using NMR to study whole core samples (Chen et al.

6.4 NMR Measurement of Long Whole Core 1252021). The method is especially useful for preserved whole cores from tight unconventional
reservoirs.
The length of an r.f. coil of a standard low-field NMR instrument usually is about 3 in. In typical
NMR measurements of small plugs, the sample is shorter than the coil. The coil is assumed to be
infinite and therefore the r.f. field strength and measurement sensitivity across the sample is
homogenous. The measured NMR data is for the entire sample.
Figure 6.9 illustrates the problems that arise in NMR measurements of long rock samples
(typically 1 ft or longer, such as the whole core) in a short helical r.f. coil used in a typical NMR
instrument. First, the spatial resolution of acquired data is limited by the finite r.f. coil length.
High-spatial-resolution NMR (HSR-NMR) results are often desired because the reservoir, and
therefore the long cores, can be significantly laminated with layers much thinner than 3 in. Second,
the end effect of the finite length r.f. coil causes inaccuracy of the measurement. For a finite coil, the
r.f. field is not homogeneous at the two ends of the coil, as illustrated by the red vectors in Figure 6.9.
The measured signal now includes signals from sample at the two ends of the r.f. coil, in addition to
the homogeneous part of the sample within the coil. In this case, the routine NMR experiments
cannot provide accurate evaluation of the fluid in the samples.
6.4.2 HSR-NMR of Long Core
A method has been developed to overcome these limits and to achieve HSR-NMR measurement of
long cores with a standard r.f. coil (Chen et al. 2021). For example, for a core of length L and a
desired spatial resolution l, the HSR-NMR of the whole core can be expressed as
A =
a1,1 a1,m
ak,1 ak,m
6 28
Each row in Eq. (6.28) represents the complete NMR signal, for example the CPMG echoes, of a
section with length l of the core. In this method, we also need to determine the response map
of the r.f. coil {r1, r2, …, rn} , which is the relative sensitivity of each section of the coil with the same
spatial resolution l. It can be easily measured experimentally (Chen et al. 2021).
In the HSR-NMR method, the data are acquired step wisely by moving the whole core sample
through the r.f. coil with the step size equal to the desired resolution, as illustrated in
Figure 6.10. Specifically, a series of NMR data acquisitions are made, beginning with the top of
the core against the start of the sensitive window of the r.f. probe. This way, the initial scan should
always be a largely noise signal. NMR acquisitions are continued along the length of the core by
moving it through the r.f. coil at the desired resolution. The acquisition continues until the core
completely passes through the sensitive window, once again resulting in a signal which is largely

true NMR signal of the sample.

6.4 NMR Measurement of Long Whole Core 127acquired NMR data include situations where the sample is completely outside of the r.f. coil and
therefore the acquired data only contains noise.
Estimation of NMR fluid distribution A from the measured data S from Eq. (6.2) is an inversion
problem. In order to obtain reliable information of the fluid content from the noisy data and mit￾igate the impacts from the end effects of the measured data, we adopted a robust estimation tech￾nique developed in the geophysical exploration industry to suppress the impacts of the
measurements with large errors (outliers). This is achieved by iterative reweighted least square
(IRLS) approach (Darche 1989; Menke 2018). IRLS estimates the fluid content A from the measured
data S by minimizing the following misfit function
min
A
1
p
RA − S p 6 32
where p is a predefined constant with values reported in [1, 2]. The impact of S on the solution of
Eq. (6.32) varies with the choice of p. When p = 2, Eq. (6.32) gives the LS solution, in which case the
solution to Eq. (6.32) is simply the inversion of the averaged data, which is taken from all the mea￾surements including those with large errors. When p approaches one, IRLS progressively relies
more on the majority of data, which follows the main trend of the fluid content distribution. In
the extreme case of p = 1, IRLS behaves as a median filter. In this particular case, as long as
the number of measurements with very large errors is less than half of the total measurements,
the inversion from IRLS is reliable.
One further inversion is then used on the echo trains ai, j( j = 1, …, m) to obtain the NMR T2
spectrum of each section of the sample.
6.4.3 Application Example
An application example is shown here using the method to acquire HSR-NMR data on an uncon￾ventional organic-rich whole core, 4 in. in diameter and 12 in. in length, as shown in the photo in
Figure 6.11. The whole core was acquired from a carbonate source rock reservoir. The photo clearly
shows a significant difference in color. The darker color shows the section having higher TOC while
the lighter section with lower TOC.
On a whole core NMR 2 MHz spectrometer from Ecotek Corp., the data were acquired step wisely
moving the sample through the r.f. coil with 1 in. steps, as illustrated in Figure 6.10. A series of data
acquisitions were made, beginning with the top of the standard sample flush against the start of the
sensitive window of the r.f. coil, continued along the length of the sample by moving it through the
r.f. coil, 1 in. at a time, until the core completely passes through the sensitive window of the r.f. coil.
At each step, a train of 1000 echoes was acquired using the CPMG method (Section 6.2.7) with an

A total of 20 echo trains were acquired, as shown in Figure 6.12a. The first two and the last two
echo trains were acquired when the cores were outside the r.f. coil. The signals were expressed as

inch of the rock, as shown in Figure 6.12b. Now there are only 12 echo trains. Further inversion of
the echo trains using the method shown in Section 6.2.8 generates the NMR T2 spectra for each inch
of the whole core, shown in Figure 6.12c.
The overall total fluid content of each inch of the whole core is the integration of the T2 spectrum
in Figure 6.12c. In Figure 6.13, the measured HSR-NMR fluid content is plotted again the photo of
the whole core. It clearly shows that higher TOC has higher total fluid in the sample. Considering
that the majority of porosity in source rocks is in organic matter, this result is expected.
6.5 NMR Measurement on Drill Cuttings
Sometimes running an NMR log or collecting cores can be too costly. In this case, drill cuttings can
be used to help characterize a reservoir. When drilling a borehole into a reservoir, the drilling bit
generates small pieces of rock, which are called drill cuttings. These cuttings flow back to the sur￾face with the drilling mud, where they are separated from the excess mud at the shale shaker and
can be collected based on the arrival time and used for petrophysical measurements. The analysis of
the cuttings, and the drilling mud, is often referred to as mud logging (Loermans et al. 2011).
Mudlogging to determine petrophysical parameters has often been considered a valuable resource,

130 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir Rocksespecially in horizontals wells where many traditional logging tools (including NMR) are unavail￾able. This mudlogging done in conventional reservoir commonly includes measurement techni￾ques such as optical microscopy (Vocke et al. 2018), CT (Siddiqui et al. 2005), gamma-ray, XRD,
XRF, porosimetry (Egermann et al. 2002), NMR (Mirotchnik et al. 2004; Kesserwan et al. 2017;
Mitchell et al. 2019), or a combination of these (Loermans et al. 2011). A few studies have also been
done in unconventional reservoir to study cuttings including infrared Fourier transform (Craddock
et al. 2018) and NMR (Fellah et al. 2018; Green et al. 2018; Althaus et al. 2020).
Since drill cuttings are produced regardless of direction, type of mud, or drill bit type, they provide
a more inexpensive method to analyze peterophysical properties of shales compared to logs or tra￾ditional coring. This makes them valuable, especially in well-drilled after the initial exploration
phase. Many measurements can also be done in trailers at the wellsite, making the data near
real-time. Since NMR can often be collected quickly and with little sample shape constraints, it
lends itself well to cuttings analysis. Herein we focus on an NMR method used to study drill cutting
in source rock reservoirs.
6.5.1 Measurement Method
6.5.1.1 Preparation of Drill Cuttings
When drill cuttings are removed from downhole, they are mixed initially with drilling mud. The
excess of drilling mud is removed at the shale shaker before the cuttings are collected and stored in
jars and/or bags based on the arrival time. This arrival time is then used to calculate a depth.
The cuttings are then typically sent to the lab for analysis (or measurements are performed at an
onsite lab). The cuttings still have additional mud and cavings, pieces of rock chipped away from
the drill bit, which should be removed for accurate measurements. The preparation depends on the
type of mud used in drilling. The cleaning fluid is based on solubility where diesel or water would be
used for oil and water-based muds, respectively. This fluid is then used to soak the cutting to solvate
the mud particles, and the mixture is wet-sieved to separate mud, cavings, and clean cuttings. The
type of drill bit does determine the size of the cuttings pieces, but for a PDC bit (currently the most
commonly used) drill cuttings appear to be between the range of 0.5–3 mm, where anything smaller
is most likely mud particles and anything larger may be cavings. Althaus et al. reported that using
sonication and shaking was the most effective method at sieve separating different particles
(Althaus et al. 2020).
After cleaning samples, the cuttings need to be saturated with the fluid of choice. This is some￾times the cleaning fluid, such as diesel or water, but other commonly used saturation fluids such as
dodecane (Fellah et al. 2018) or isopar can be used. It is important to note that after saturation, fluid
will also remain on the outside of the cuttings.
6.5.1.2 Measurements
The challenge of NMR studies on cuttings samples is to separate the fluid in the sample from the
fluid surrounding it. This can be accomplished in different ways. In previous papers, the cuttings
and fluid volumes were determined through an NMR Archimedes technique (Althaus et al. 2020).
In this method, the cuttings are measured on the NMR using CPMG (section 6.2.7) to determine the
T2 and volume. A cutoff was chosen to determine which fluids were inside the cuttings (Vϕ) and
which were outside of the sample (Vl). The sample is weighed in air (mair) and then submerged in
saturation fluid and weighed (mf), see Figure 6.14. These results are combined to determine the
volumes, porosity, and densities.
6.5 NMR Measurement on Drill Cuttings 131The bulk density can be calculated by
ρc = mair − Vlρl
mair − mf − Vlρl
ρl 6 33
where ρl is the density of the liquid.
The grain density can be calculated as
ρm = mair − Vφ + Vl ρl
mair − mf − Vlρl ρl − Vϕ
6 34
The porosity can be calculated as
ϕ = Vϕ
mair − mf − Vlρl ρl

6.5.2 Results
Example results from the NMR-Archimedes technique is discussed here on cleaned drill cutting
and crushed imitation cuttings. Drill cuttings were collected at the wellsite from the shale-shakers
of an organic-rich source rock section of a well. The imitation samples were obtained by crushing
cores collected from the same source rock reservoir. The crushed imitation sample allows compar￾ison with industry-standard GRI measurement.
Real cuttings samples were split into two batches to determine the precision of the measurement
method based on the reproducibility since there is no other data available to verify the results. Rep￾resentative T2 NMR spectra from the cleaned cuttings saturated with diesel are shown in
Figure 6.15. The spectra were then analyzed and for the particular well a cutoff of 44 ms was

porosity.
132 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir Rocksdetermined. The amount of fluid inside the cuttings Vϕ and outside of the cuttings was measured Vl.
These values were then used to calculate the petrophysical properties as described in 6.5.1.2.
Figure 6.16 shows a comparison of the data from the two sample batches for bulk density, matrix
density, and porosity. The density results are in good agreement with less than 5% difference in all
samples. The porosity has slightly more variation, however, most of the samples are within 1 pu
difference. This variation in porosity may be due to the deformation caused by the drilling bit. Over￾all, NMR measurements of cutting have been found to provide reliable data on density and porosity
in unconventional samples (Althaus et al. 2020).
The artificial cuttings were compared to GRI measurements on crushed cores taken from the
same reservoir as the dill cuttings. The bulk and matrix density measurements are compared to
GRI 1 : 1 line in Figure 6.17 on the left. The density measured by NMR is in good agreement with
those done by GRI. On the right in Figure 6.17, the NMR porosity is plotted versus GRI results.
Again, we see fairly good agreement.
6.6 Conclusions
NMR has become a key technology for evaluating unconventional source rock reservoirs because it
directly measures the mobile hydrogen in samples and is largely independent of complex rock
lithology presented in source rocks. An introduction was given to the NMR basics physics and
its measurement concept on samples of formation rocks. Some essential petrophysical parameters
of formation rocks from NMR measurements includes porosity, volume and the distribution of
rock pore space, permeability index, type and quantity of fluid hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbon
producibility.
A downhole NMR logging example was given. The porosity, fractional porosity occupied by
hydrocarbon and water, and capability of NMR log data in estimating pore size distribution was
shown. The log results were validated with retrieved cores.

134 6 NMR and Its Applications in Tight Unconventional Reservoir RocksThe HSR-NMR method to analyze the fluids in large source rock samples was presented. The
method overcame challenges generated by the finite length of the r.f. detection coil and obtained
HSR-NMR data with spatial resolution much smaller than the length of the coil. The measured
results on preserved whole cores demonstrated that the HSR-NMR measurement can provide crit￾ical information about the heterogeneity or lamination of the reservoir.
A method was developed to measure porosity and density from drill cuttings for unconventional
source rock reservoirs. Results were shown to be highly reproducible across a set of samples from
one well. This measurement can be done quickly, with a run time per sample of approximately two
minutes and thus can be easily adopted to wellsite measurement. This allows for real-time man￾agement of the well. Once the cuttings have been measured via the NMR Archimedes analysis, they
can be cleaned with water and surfactants in a similar manner to the diesel cleaning outlined here.
The cleaned cuttings can then be further used for other petrophysical, geochemical, and imaging
analyses.

7.1 Introduction
Permeability is an important parameter for almost all flow and transport processes in the subsur￾face. The laboratory measurement of tight rock permeability is especially relevant to hydrocarbon
recovery from unconventional reservoirs, caprock integrity associated with CO2 geological seques￾tration in saline aquifers, and geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes in tight rock
formations.
Unconventional reservoirs, characterized by low to ultra-low permeabilities, have become one of
the main sources of oil and gas in the United States and worldwide, resulting from the development
of innovative technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In an unconven￾tional reservoir, hydrocarbon flows from rock matrix to a production well through natural and
hydraulic fractures. The low-permeability rock matrix, where the majority of hydrocarbon resides,
is really the bottleneck for hydrocarbon recovery (Ozkan et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2018). Thus, the accu￾rate determination of matrix permeability is critical for predicting hydrocarbon production from an
unconventional reservoir and optimizing the reservoir management process.
To mitigate the global increase in temperature due to climate change, the world needs to limit the
emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide CO2 (e.g. IPCC 2007,
2014). In order to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, several mitigation strategies have
been suggested, including CO2 capture and storage (CCS) that involves capture of CO2 from indus￾trial units (e.g. power plants and cement factories) and then injection of the captured CO2 into
underground reservoirs, such as saline aquifers, for geological storage. The integrity of caprock
overlying the storage reservoir is important for the long-term safe containment of stored CO2
(IEAGHG 2011). For many existing and potential CO2 storage sites, clay-rich shales and mudstones
form the primary caprock with ultra-low permeability. There are two kinds of potential CO2 leak￾age pathways; one through the reactivated faults and newly generated fractures in the caprock
owing to pore pressure increase in the reservoir, and the other associated with slow CO2 flow
and diffusion through the non-fractured portion of the caprock. While the latter leakage is slow,
it is still significant for the long-term safety of CO2 storage because it could happen through the
large contact area between the caprock and the aquifer. The assessment of leakage risk for both
potential pathways requires information on caprock permeability.

© 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2023 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Nuclear energy generates about 20% of the US national electricity that is baseload and carbon￾emission free (NEI 2020). However, a major issue related to nuclear energy development is the dis￾posal of high-level nuclear wastes produced from energy generation. It is well-accepted that the
deep geological disposal of wastes is the preferred permanent disposal option that has been inves￾tigated for many years in several countries worldwide (Besnard et al. 2019). Potential geological
disposal sites generally target tight rocks, such as granite, salt, and shale formations (Nutt et al.
2011). The low permeability of these formations minimizes or even eliminates the risk of nuclear
waste leakage to locations that might impact the health of future generations. Thus, rock perme￾ability is an important parameter for assessing the feasibility to store nuclear wastes in a geological
formation. As will be discussed later, one of the widely used laboratory methods to measure tight
rock permeability was initially developed in the community of nuclear waste management (Brace
et al. 1968; Hsieh et al. 1981).
While the laboratory permeability measurement is largely a trivial task for high-permeability
porous media, the accurate determination of tight rock permeability in the laboratory remains a
technical challenge largely because its value is very low and, in many cases, on the order of
nano-Darcy (nD). The major objective of this chapter is to review the selected recent advances in
developing new methodologies for measuring tight rock permeability in laboratory. The rest of this
chapter is organized as follows. Section 7.2 provides a brief introduction to the commonly used
methods for tight rock permeability measurements in the laboratory to set the stage for further
discussion of the new developments. Sections 7.3 and 7.4 focus on the two key elements of the Aramco
Nano Permeameter (ANP) method developed at the Aramco Research Center, including simultane￾ous measurement of fracture and matrix permeability from fractured core samples and the direct
measurement of permeability-pore pressure function from non-fractured core samples.
7.2 Commonly Used Laboratory Methods
This section briefly presents some most widely used methods for laboratory measurement of tight
rock permeability, including the steady-state flow, pressure pulse-decay (PPD), and Gas Research
Institute (GRI) methods. More detailed reviews of these methods can be found in Cui et al. (2009)
and Sander et al. (2017). The non-reactive gases, such as nitrogen, are generally employed as work￾ing fluids for permeability measurements because they have lower viscosities compared to liquids
and thus can make the permeability measurement faster. As a general note, permeability cannot be
directly measured in the laboratory but is inferred through the linkage between permeability and
directly measurable variables (e.g. flow rate, pressure, temperature, and others). This linkage is
either the known physical laws (e.g. Darcy’s law) or analytical solutions to fluid flow through a rock
sample under the designed test conditions. It is important to keep this in mind for discussing the
currently available methods and the related new developments.
7.2.1 Steady-State Flow Method
The steady-state flow method is the simplest and most straightforward approach to measure rock
permeability in the laboratory (API 1998; Sinha et al. 2013). Figure 7.1 is the schematic experiment
setup for this method. It consists of a core holder, three pumps (upstream, downstream, and con￾fining pumps), and pressure and temperature transducers. During the steady-state flow test, a rock
sample is placed within the core holder, and a confining pump is applied to generate the required
confining pressure using the confining fluid (within the core holder) separated from the core
140 7 Tight Rock Permeability Measurement in Laboratorysample with seals. The inlet and outlet of the rock sample are connected to upstream and down￾stream pumps, respectively. These pumps maintain the required constant upstream and down￾stream pressures and provide flow-rate measurements to and from the pumps. Pressures and
temperatures at the inlet, outlet, and confining pump are monitored with pressure and temperature
transducers. The whole system is placed in an oven with constant temperature to ensure isothermal
test conditions such that the fluid flow is purely owing to the pressure gradient across the rock sam￾ple. When the mass flow rate to the inlet and that out of the outlet are practically identical, the
steady-state flow has been reached.
Then permeability can be estimated with Darcy’s law expressed as
Q = kAρ
μ
Δp
L
7 1
where Q is mass flow rate, k is permeability, ρ is fluid density, μ is fluid viscosity, Δp is pressure
difference between the inlet and outlet of the rock sample, and A and L are the sample’s cross￾sectional area and length, respectively. Volumetric flow rates from the upstream pump and to the
downstream pump are measured. The corresponding mass flow rates are determined by multiplying
the volumetric flow rates with local fluid densities that depend on pressure and temperature.
Since under steady-state flow condition, values for all the parameters in Eq. (7.1), except perme￾ability, are known or measured, permeability can thus be estimated from the equation (Sinha et al.
2013). For stress-sensitive rocks, such as shale, the pressure difference Δp should be small and gen￾erally on the order of few percentages of the average of the upstream and downstream pressures
such that permeability can be treated as a constant along the core sample under the test condition.
7.2.2 Pressure Pulse-Decay Method
While the steady-state flow method is conceptually simple and straightforward to use, it generally
takes a long time to achieve steady-state flow for tight rock samples with extremely low permea￾bility. To overcome this, the PPD method, based on transient flow test conditions, was introduced to
measure permeability of crystalline rocks for nuclear waste disposal (Brace et al. 1968; Hsieh et al.
1981). It was then successfully applied to measure tight rock gas permeability in the oil and gas
industry (Dicker and Smits 1988; Jones 1997).

7.2 Commonly Used Laboratory Methods 141Figure 7.2 shows the experimental setup scheme for the permeability measurement using the
PPD method. The system includes a core holder where a rock sample is located during the test
and subject to confining pressure provided by the confining fluid, and upstream and downstream
reservoirs connected to the inlet and outlet of the rock sample, respectively.
As the first step of the PPD test, the working fluid, used for measuring permeability, is
injected from the inlet and outlet of the rock sample with upstream and downstream pumps
until the pore pressure within the rock sample equilibrates and reaches the desired initial
value. Depending on the permeability value, this equilibrium process can take several hours
or days for tight rocks. Then, the upstream reservoir is disconnected from the rock sample by
closing the valve for the connection (Figure 7.2), and a gas pressure pulse is created in the
upstream gas reservoir by injecting a certain amount of the working fluid. A small pressure
pulse is generally used such that in the upstream reservoir pressure increase is a few percent
of the initial gas pressure (e.g. Dicker and Smits 1988; Jones 1997). This is because the PPD
method relies on the analytical solutions to linear or linearized gas flow equations that require
small disturbances to the test system such that fluid density and viscosity can be approximated
as constants within the rock sample.
After the pressure increase in the upstream reservoir reaches the desired value, the reservoir
is reconnected to the core sample by opening the valve for the connection (Figure 7.2). The gas
then flows from the upstream gas reservoir to the downstream one through the rock sample.
Evolutions of the gas pressures from the two gas reservoirs are monitored as a function of
time. The whole test system is maintained under isothermal conditions during the PPD testing
process.
The permeability is finally determined by fitting the pressure data with the relevant analytical
solution to fluid flow within the test system, with permeability being a fitting parameter. Since fluid
and rock properties could be approximated as constants, the governing equation for working fluid
flow is linear and can be solved analytically. The solution allows the permeability to be related to

where pu and pd are pressures at the upstream and downstream reservoirs, respectively. In Eq. (7.2),
f is a known function of geometry of the rock sample (length and cross-sectional area), rock poros￾ity, and properties of the working fluid (density, viscosity, and compressibility). Fitting the pressure
data with Eq. (7.2) gives the permeability value of the rock sample being tested for the given pore
pressure and confining stress (or pressure).
7.2.3 Gas Research Institute Method
The process to take a rock sample from the deep reservoir to surface can result in significant stress
release for the sample, which, in many cases, generates fractures in it. Fractures can also be induced
during sample transportation and preparation (such as drilling a plug to be used for permeability
measurements with steady-state and PPD methods). Since the tight rock permeability is very low,
these induced fractures can dominate measured laboratory permeability values and make the lab￾oratory permeability measurements irrelevant to the true permeability in the reservoir.
Partially motivated by overcoming the impact of induced features on permeability measurement
in core samples, the GRI method was developed and has been widely used in the oil and gas indus￾try (Luffel et al. 1993; GRI 1996). While it is believed that induced fractures do not exist at very small
scales, the GRI method uses crushed rock samples with a particle size diameter of about 1 mm and
works as follows. The GRI experimental setup includes two cells: a reference cell and a sample cell
(Figure 7.3). The sample cell contains crushed rock particles and the reference cell includes work
fluid only. One should first let equilibrium occur between the gas pressures in the sample cell and
pores in the rock samples and then connect the sample cell to the reference cell with a higher gas
pressure by opening the valve for the connecting tubing (Figure 7.3). The gas pressures within two
cells become equal almost simultaneously, but the gas pressure continues to decline because of the
penetration of the gas into rock particles. Pressure declines more quickly for the rock particles with
high permeability values. The rock permeability is finally determined by fitting the observed pres￾sure decline to the associated analytical solutions with permeability as a fitting parameter. The ana￾lytical solutions were obtained by assuming the diameters of rock particles to be uniform, the
particles to be spherical, and rock properties to be isotropic and homogeneous (Cui et al. 2009).

7.2 Commonly Used Laboratory Methods 143We refer the readers to Cui et al. (2009) for the details of the analytical solutions used in the GRI
method.
While the GRI method has been widely used to measure tight rock permeability in laboratory, it
suffers from several well-known limitations. Firstly, the GRI method is only conducted under the
zero confining stress condition and thus cannot be used for investigating the stress dependency of
shale permeability (Luffel et al. 1993; GRI 1996). Secondly, several researchers (e.g. Cui et al. 2009;
Tinni et al. 2012) reported that GRI permeability measurements have been found to be dependent
on the particle size of crushed samples; larger particles correspond to higher measured permeability
values. Consequently, the representativeness of the permeability measurements at the millimeter
scale can be questioned. Thirdly, the GRI test is generally conducted at small pore pressures that
results in a significant impact of diffusion on the measured permeability values as well (Liu et al.
2018). The diffusion effect will be discussed later in this chapter.
7.3 Simultaneous Measurement of Fracture and Matrix
Permeabilities from Fractured Core Samples
The stress release of a rock sample, when taken from a deep reservoir to the surface, and sample
preparation process may induce artificial fractures within the sample. To overcome the impact of
the induced fractures on laboratory permeability measurements, the GRI method, as previously
indicated, has been widely used in the oil and gas industry for measuring rock permeability with
crushed samples. However, it suffers from several major limitations. To deal with this technology
gap, we have developed a new method, as part of the ANP method, that simultaneously measures
fracture and matrix permeabilities from fractured core samples under different stress conditions
(Zhang et al. 2020). This section discusses this method and its validation.
7.3.1 Estimation of Fracture and Matrix Permeability from PPD Data
for Two Flow Regimes
Our approach is based on the generalization of the conventional PPD method, which assumes that
the core sample being tested is a single continuum, and thus the gas flow is uniform at a given cross￾section along the sample. In the PPD test of a single-continuum sample, the upstream reservoir
pressure goes down, and the downstream reservoir pressure goes up when gas flows from the
upstream to the downstream. As soon as pressures from both reservoirs become identical, they
remain constant and the system (rock core sample or reservoirs) reaches equilibrium.
Figure 7.4 shows the concept of fluid flow in a fractured core sample that needs to be character￾ized as a dual-continuum system, rather than a single continuum. Note that in Figure 7.4, we use
one fracture for the demonstration purpose; our discussion here can be applied to fracture networks
as well. During the early stage of the PPD test, the flow process is dominated by flow in fractures
because fracture permeability is much higher than matrix permeability. Consequently, pressures
from both reservoirs become the same relatively quickly and then flow within the fractures stops.
In this flow regime, we can apply the conventional PPD data analysis method, as previously dis￾cussed, to determine the fracture permeability. At this stage, flow within the rock matrix plays a
negligible role in determining the evolution of reservoir pressures.
As demonstrated in Figure 7.5 for a fractured core sample, reservoir pressures, after becoming the
same (at Point A), will continue to decline because of the gas flow into rock matrix from both reser￾voirs shown in Figure 7.4. The pressures eventually become constant and do not change with time
144 7 Tight Rock Permeability Measurement in Laboratoryany longer, resulting from that the system becomes equilibrium. Recall that for a single continuum
system the equilibrium is reached as soon as the pressures from both upstream and downstream gas
reservoirs become the same. This second flow regime (beyond Point A in Figure 7.5) is dominantly
controlled by flow to and within the matrix. Thus, the pressure data in the flow regime can be used
for estimating matrix permeability, as will be discussed later. We herein ignore the flow from frac￾tures to the matrix for a horizontal core sample, given that matrix permeability along the horizontal
or bedding direction is significantly higher than that in the vertical direction (e.g. Mokhtari et al.
2013; Zhang et al. 2020). The horizontal permeability is of more interest because it is more relevant
to hydrocarbon production from unconventional reservoirs.
To the best of our knowledge, Ning (1992) and Ning et al. (1993) conducted the early work to
estimate both fracture and matrix permeability from fractured core samples by history matching
of pressure pulse decay tests with numerical methods. However, their method needs detailed geom￾etry of fractures within a test sample and ignores anisotropy of matrix permeability. The use of
numerical methods, in many cases, also suffers from the non-uniqueness problem in parameter
identifications. Consequently, their methods have not been widely used in practice.
Some researchers assumed fractures to be completely closed at a certain confining stress in order
to use conventional PPD and likewise for measuring the matrix permeability from fractured sam￾ples (e.g. Gan et al. 2018). As indicated by Liu et al. (2009) and Rutqvist et al. (2002), among others,
fractures cannot be completely closed even at very high confining stresses, as a result of the damage
of cementation between grain particles and other relevant factors. The remaining fracture opening
is called the residual fracture aperture (e.g. Rutqvist et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2009). The residual aper￾ture may not be a significant contributor to fluid flow in conventional rock samples with relatively

7.3.2 Mathematical Model
The measurement of the matrix permeability requires an analytical solution to fluid flow within the
rock matrix under the test conditions corresponding to the second flow regime (corresponding to
Point A and beyond that is shown in Figure 7.5). Like all the other methods used to estimate
permeability in the laboratory, the core sample is considered to be homogeneous. It is a reasonable
treatment, given that the heterogeneity at that scale, if it exists, is insignificant compared with
large-scale heterogeneity. The flow along the core sample is treated as one-dimensional flow. As
previously indicated, flow from the fracture faces to the matrix is negligible because matrix perme￾ability in the horizontal (or bedding) direction is much higher than that in the vertical direction.
Consequently, the flow into the sample in the second flow regime is mainly from the end faces of a
horizontal core sample.
Based on Darcy’s law and the mass conservation, the governing equation of fluid flow in a core
sample, with fluid pressure as the dependent variable, is given as:

∂x2 = cμφm

∂p x, t

where p is the fluid pressure, x is the location (Figure 7.6), t is time, c is the total compressibility
approximated by fluid compressibility herein that is much larger than solid compressibility for the
given test condition, μ is the viscosity, φm is the matrix porosity, km is the matrix permeability, t1 is
the time when the upstream pressure is equal to the downstream pressure or when the second flow
regime begins, and L is the total length of the core sample. Note that the above equation is a
linearized one because the rock properties and fluid viscosity and density are constant.

where A is the cross-sectional area of the core sample and Ve is the total volume including the vol￾ume of the upstream and downstream reservoirs as well as the fractures within the sample. In most
cases, the fracture volume can be ignored compared with the summation of the volumes of
upstream and downstream reservoirs. The symmetry condition also exists in the middle of the sam￾ple (Eq. (7.7)).
The above problem was analytically solved by Chen et al. (2018) using Laplace transformation.
Their solution is expressed in terms of dimensionless time, τ, and pressure, p, that are defined,
respectively, as

where p∞ is the pore pressure when the whole system reaches equilibrium. The volume ratio, ω, is

where Vm is the pore volume in the matrix of a rock sample. Then, the solution to the dimensionless

and the remaining terms can be safely ignored for practical applications. Thus, Eq. (7.11) can be
further simplified as (Chen et al. 2018):

observed data of log pu versus time. Specifically, the matrix permeability is calculated with

determining the matrix permeability herein.
7.3.3 Method Validation and Discussion
Observed pressures from the upstream and downstream reservoirs of a PPD test system, as previ￾ously discussed, are characterized by the two flow regimes. We herein focus on the evaluation of the
method to estimate matrix permeability using data from the second flow regime.
A tight pyrophyllite sample, a metamorphic rock that is quite homogeneous and readily avail￾able from commercial sources (Profice et al. 2016), was used for the validation purpose. We first
performed the PPD test on the sample to measure its permeability which is considered the true
matrix permeability of the sample. We then artificially fractured the sample by cutting the sample
into two pieces and measured its matrix permeability again using our method discussed here.
During the PPD tests, a relatively high pore pressure of 2500 psi in the sample was used as the
initial pressure to minimize the diffusion effect. After the PPD system equilibrated at the initial
pressure, a pressure pulse with a magnitude of around 100 psi was applied to the upstream res￾ervoir and then flow occurred across the sample. The pressures as functions of time were mon￾itored from both the upstream and downstream reservoirs with high-precision pressure
transducers. Nitrogen gas was used as the working fluid in the tests that stopped when gas pres￾sures from both gas reservoirs did not decrease anymore. The pressure decay data were analyzed
with an in-house software written in MATLAB, and the gas adsorption effect was negligible and
thus was not considered.
Table 7.1 shows the comparison of matrix permeability measurements for the pyrophyllite sam￾ple obtained before and after artificial fracturing. Before fracturing, the measured matrix permea￾bility is 232 nD for the pore pressure of 2500 psi and confining pressure of 3500 psi. The matrix
permeability obtained with our method from the artificially fractured core sample is 238 nD for
the same pore and confining pressures. The two matrix permeability values are practically identical
(only 2.6% different).

148 7 Tight Rock Permeability Measurement in LaboratoryThe method has also been used for determining matrix permeability for some unconventional
reservoirs. As an example, Figure 7.8 shows the measured fracture and matrix permeabilities for
a shale sample collected from the Eagle Ford formation at the pore pressure of 2500 psi and differ￾ent confining pressures. For a given differential pressure, defined as the difference between con￾fining and pore pressures, the fracture permeability is about two orders of magnitude higher
than the matrix permeability. Note that the traditional PPD method can only estimate the bulk per￾meability that is essentially the same as the fracture permeability because the core sample was trea￾ted as a single-continuum system, rather than a dual-continuum system. Figure 7.8 also indicates
that the stress dependency of permeability can be fitted by exponential functions for both fractures
and matrix, which is consistent with previous studies (e.g. Liu 2017).
It may be useful to emphasize that our method to estimate both fracture and matrix permeability
is really a generalization of the conventional PPD method. Compared with the latter, our method
has at least three advantages. Firstly, it allows estimating both fracture and matrix permeability
values from fractured core samples under different stress conditions. This is practically important
because we can recover the true matrix permeability even when rock samples contain artificially
induced fractures. Secondly, it is based on analytical solutions to gas flow across the core sample
and thus easier to use in practice than the analysis of the test results with numerical models. The
determination of the matrix permeability with our method involves linear curve fitting only.
Thirdly, it uses the same experimental setup as the traditional PPD method and thus is easily
adopted.

and after artificial fracturing. The PPD and the new method are used for measuring the permeability for

7.3 Simultaneous Measurement of Fracture and Matrix Permeabilities from Fractured Core Samples 1497.4 Direct Measurement of Permeability-Pore Pressure Function
The conventional PPD method is time-consuming for determining the relation between permea￾bility and pore pressure or stress because that requires multiple permeability data points measured
at different pore and confining pressures. For a given confining pressure and pore pressure, one
PPD test run is used to measure one permeability point only. In order to measure core sample per￾meability at a different pore pressure and/or confining pressure, one needs to re-equilibrate the
system under the new test conditions and then do another PPD test run. The re-equilibrium proc￾ess, depending on the permeability, can take a long time (e.g. days) (Jones 1997). Since this proce￾dure needs one test run to measure a permeability point and requires multiple test runs for
determining permeability-pore pressure relation, it is called the “point-by-point” approach by
Liu and Zhang (2020).
The root cause for needing multiple test runs to determine permeability-pressure relationship is
that the “point-by-point” method is based on the linear theory of gas flow within core samples.
Because the theory requires the constant fluid and rock properties (gas density, gas viscosity, poros￾ity, and permeability), only small pressure disturbances (or pressure pulses) are allowed during the
PPD tests. The linear theory would become invalid, if there were significant variations of fluid and
rock flow properties along the core sample during the PPD test run. Consequently, one can only
measure one permeability data point at a given pore pressure and confining pressure condition.
To overcome the inefficiency of the “point-by-point” measurement approach, we have developed
another method, also as part of the ANP method, that can directly measure the pore pressure
dependence of permeability for a non-fractured tight rock sample with a single test run (Liu
and Zhang 2020). Unlike currently available methods, it is based on nonlinear theory of fluid flow
within core samples and not limited by the small pressure disturbance across the test system. This
section is devoted to the discussion of this new development.
7.4.1 Knudsen Diffusion, Slippage Flow, and Effective Gas Permeability
The tight rock gas permeability is a function of pore pressure for several reasons. For a given con￾fining pressure, an increase in pore pressure would enlarge the rock pore size and thus enhance the
rock permeability, as indicated in Figure 7.8. The second mechanism is so-called slippage flow.
Because of the low density for low gas pressures, the gas does not have zero velocity at the pore
walls but has a slippage flow. This makes the measured permeability, or effective permeability, lar￾ger than the intrinsic permeability that is defined under the condition of zero fluid velocity at pore
walls. The above two mechanisms exist for both conventional rocks with relatively high permea￾bility and tight rocks, simply because they are not directly related to the pore size. The third mech￾anism is Knudsen diffusion which becomes significant for extremely small pore sizes and thus is
unique for tight rocks. The relation between the gas permeability and pore pressure for the tight
rocks results from all the above three mechanisms.
The gas diffusion is a result of the thermal motion of gas molecules. The key parameter for
describing the diffusion process at the continuum scale, the gas diffusion coefficient D, is given
in classic statistical physics by (e.g. Javadpour et al. 2014):
D = 1
3
lu∗ 7 15
where l is the mean free path or the average distance for a molecule to travel before it hits other
molecules, and u∗ is the averaged magnitude of thermal motion velocity. They are calculated by
(e.g. Civan 2010; Ziarani and Aguilera 2012; Javadpour et al. 2014)

where kB is the Boltzmann Constant (1.3805 × 10−23 J/K), T is the temperature, p is the pressure,
dc (m) is the collision diameter for gas that is 0.358 nm for N2 (often used as a working fluid to
measure tight rock permeability in the laboratory), and W is the gas molecular weight.
The conventional rocks have much larger pore sizes than the mean free path and thus collisions
mainly occur among gas molecules themselves in rock pores. In this case, fluid flow is dominated by
the viscous flow process owing to collisions among gas molecules, and the diffusion effect on fluid
flow is negligible. In tight rocks, the gas mean free path could be greater than the pore radius on the
order of nm under low pore pressures. In this case, the collisions mainly occur between the pore
walls and gas molecules in rock pores, which reduces the resistance to the bulk movement of gas
molecules compared to the regime of viscous fluid flow that corresponds to the dominant collisions
among gas molecules. This diffusion process for the smaller mean free path than the pore size is
called Knudsen diffusion and characterized by Knudsen number defined as
Kn = l
r
7 18
where r is the pore radius.
When Knudsen diffusion and slippage flow become important, the measured or effective perme￾ability is larger than the intrinsic permeability that is purely determined by pore geometry and has
nothing to do with the working fluid. As an example, Figure 7.9 shows the dependency of enhance￾ment factor of nitrogen permeability, fc, on pore pressure for a microtube with a radius of 5 nm,
which is the typical size of pore throat in shale (e.g. Liu et al. 2018). The enhancement factor herein
refers to the ratio of the effective permeability to its intrinsic value. Note that the factor results from
the effects of both Knudsen diffusion and slippage flow. Beskok and Karniadakis (1999) reported a
mathematical formulation of fc for microtubes:
f c = 1+ αKn 1+
4Kn
1 − bKn
7 19
where b is a constant equal to −1 and α is the dimensionless rarefaction coefficient that can be
empirically determined from the Knudsen number (Civan 2010). The above formulation has been
validated with a large number of numerical experiments and demonstrated to be able to accurately
calculate the enhancement factor for micro-tubes (Beskok and Karniadakis 1999). However, the
development of the corresponding formulation for porous media is much more difficult because
of the complexity of pore geometry in porous media (e.g. Civan 2010; Ziarani and Aguilera
2012; Javadpour et al. 2014). At this point, the experimental method remains the only reliable
way to determine the dependency of tight rock permeability on pore pressure.
The measured (effective) permeability can be much higher than the intrinsic one, as indicated in
Figure 7.9 by the much higher enhancement factor than one at low pore pressures, while gas flow in
an unconventional reservoir is controlled by the effective permeability. This permeability enhance￾ment is desirable for improving gas production rate during the late stage of production when gas
pressure in the reservoir is relatively low, which highlights the importance of accurately measuring
the effective permeability in the laboratory as a function of pore pressure within the context of pre￾dicting the gas production from tight rock reservoirs.
7.4 Direct Measurement of Permeability-Pore Pressure Function 1517.4.2 Methodology for Directly Measuring Permeability-Pore Pressure Function
As previously stated, permeability cannot be directly measured in the laboratory. Instead, its value
is inferred from the link between rock sample permeability and other directly measurable variables.
In many cases, analytical solutions to fluid flow in the core sample play the role of linkage. Thus,
new laboratory methods for measuring rock permeability have often been developed side by side
with the development of new analytical solutions of fluid flow or the new application of the existing
analytical solutions. The limitations of the “point-by-point” methods result from their origin in the
application of the linear theory of fluid flow. Here we present a method that is based on a nonlinear
theory of fluid flow presented by Liu and Zhang (2020).
Based on Darcy’s law and mass conservation, the nonlinear governing equation for one￾dimensional non-reactive gas flow along a rock column is

Equation (7.28) indicates that D(p) can be fully determined with p(λ) being known. More specifi￾cally, if we determine p(λ) in one test run, the function D(p) can be calculated from Eq. (7.28). Given
that the relations among density, viscosity, and gas pressure are known for a given test fluid (e.g.
nitrogen gas), the pore pressure dependence of permeability can then be determined from D(p)
with Eq. (7.27).

7.4 Direct Measurement of Permeability-Pore Pressure Function 153To use the above analytical results to efficiently and accurately measure the permeability-pore pres￾sure function with a single test run, an experimental setup shown in Figure 7.10 was built. The key
hardware elements of the setup are like the PPD or steady-state flow test system, including
upstream and downstream gas reservoirs, core holder, pumps to provide gas pressures and confin￾ing pressure, respectively, and pressure and temperature transducers. However, the major differ￾ence between the current setup and conventional ones is that pressure transducers are used to
measure pressure history at one or more locations along the core sample in order to determine
p(λ) (Figure 7.10). At each location, the x value is known and fixed. Then, the measured p(t) at that
location can be easily converted to p(λ) using the Boltzmann transformation (Eq. (7.24)). In theory,
p(t) from one location is needed only to calculate p(λ) because the latter does not depend on the
location. The transducers were used at three locations in the setup (Figure 7.10) because the com￾parison between measurements from different transducers, as will be discussed later, provides a
powerful way to validate the proposed methodology and setup. Extra care needs to be taken to min￾imize the disturbance of the dead volume of these transducers to the gas flow in the core sample.
The dead volume refers to the volume of open space inside a pressure transducer connected to the
core sample’s pore space. In the setup shown in Figure 7.10, analog pressure transducers are used
because they have almost zero dead volumes (Liu and Zhang 2020).
The test is conducted in an isothermal condition by placing the setup within an oven with a con￾stant temperature. The test also requires a constant confining pressure making permeability only a
function of pore pressure along the core sample. The major steps of the test procedure are as follow.
Firstly, following the initial conditions for the theoretical model discussed above, the setup is ini￾tially equilibrated with a given constant pore pressure pi (Eq. (7.23)). Secondly, to be consistent with
the required boundary conditions, the pressure in the upstream gas reservoir is then increased to p0
(Eq. (7.23)) and kept fixed throughout the test. Since the current method is not limited by the small
pressure disturbance (or pulse) to the test sample, p0 can be much greater than pi. The two pressures
are determined in such a way that their difference covers the pressure range of interest for a given
practical application. Thirdly, let gas flow from the upstream reservoir through a core sample to the

Finally, use the pressure history to calculate p(λ). The latter is further used to determine the
permeability-pore pressure function, as described above.
The analytical solution (Eq. (7.28)) was developed for an infinitely long rock core sample. This
condition can never be met in practice. Liu and Zhang (2020) proposed a concept of critical time
for dealing with this; before the critical time, the gas flow at a given location is equivalent to the flow
occurring in an infinitely long core sample. During the test, the critical times at the inlet and outlet
of a core sample can be determined based on experimental observations. The critical time for the
outlet is when the pressure increase is observed in the downstream gas reservoir. Then the outlet
boundary effect will propagate from the outlet towards to the inlet along the core sample. The time
for the outlet boundary effect to propagate to the given location is called propagation time. The
determination of the critical time at the inlet is based on the accumulative gas flow rate from
the upstream gas reservoir to an infinitely long core sample that is proportional to the square root
of time for the given boundary and initial conditions (Eq. (7.30)). The critical time at the inlet then
corresponds to the time when the above relationship between the flow rate and time, or Eq. (7.30),
does not hold any longer. The difference between the inlet and outlet critical times is the propa￾gation time at the inlet; propagation time at the outlet is zero. Given that the governing equation
for gas flow in a core is mathematically identical to the nonlinear diffusion equation, the propaga￾tion time at a location along the core sample where the pore pressures are monitored (Figure 7.10) is
approximately determined using properties of a diffusion process. Note that the propagation time at
a given location, for a diffusion process, is proportional to the square of the distance between the
location and the downstream boundary. Then the critical time at any location between the inlet and
outlet is the summation of the critical time at the outlet and the propagation time at that location.
Only the pressure data collected before the critical time are used for estimating the permeability￾pore pressure function with Eq. (7.28).
It may be useful to note that the analytical results for the nonlinear diffusive equations have been
used for measuring different flow and transport in several applications. Ludwig Boltzmann, the
father of statistical physics, put forward the Boltzmann transformation (Eq. (7.24)) to solve nonlin￾ear diffusion equations under the boundary and initial conditions defined by Eq. (7.23). Based on
the Boltzmann transformation, Matano (1933) derived an expression for concentration-dependent
diffusion coefficient, similar to Eq. (7.28), for solute transport problems. Bruce and Klute (1956)
then applied the Boltzmann-Matano method to developing a laboratory technique to estimate
soil-water diffusivity that has been widely used in the soil science community. As discussed in this
chapter, we recently applied a similar mathematical technique for directly measuring permeability
– pore pressure function with a single test run (Liu and Zhang 2020).
7.4.3 Experiments
Three-inch long core samples (with a diameter of 1 in.) from Eagle Ford were used for evaluating
the method discussed in Section 7.4.2. These cores were scanned with μ-CT to ensure that they did
not contain fractures. Recall that the proposed method is valid only for non-fractured core samples.
During a test with the setup shown in Figure 7.10, the initial pore pressure was set to the atmos￾pheric pressure for two reasons (Liu and Zhang 2020). To do so, the pressure equilibrium process
that may take a long time can be avoided. This is also useful to investigate the impact of diffusion
that becomes more significant at lower pore pressures. The gas pressure in the upstream gas res￾ervoir was then increased from the atmospheric pressure to 2000 psi and kept constant. When gas
(nitrogen herein) flowed from the upstream gas reservoir through the core sample to the
7.4 Direct Measurement of Permeability-Pore Pressure Function 155downstream gas reservoir, gas pressures as a function of time at three different locations along the
core sample (Figure 7.10) were monitored with three pressure transducers. During the tests, a con￾stant confining pressure of 4000 psi was applied to the core samples. To conduct the tests under
isothermal conditions, the setup was again placed within an oven with a constant temperature.
As an example, Figure 7.11 shows gas pressures for Sample A as a function of time at the inlet or
upstream gas reservoir, outlet or downstream gas reservoir, and from the three pressure transducers
along the core sample. Within the test time periods before the critical times, p(λ) curves were cal￾culated with Eq. (7.24) and the pressure history data collected from the three pressure transducers.
These curves essentially collapse into a single curve, which is consistent with the theory discussed
in Section 7.4.2. For gas flow through a core sample under the initial and boundary conditions given
in Eq. (7.23), gas pressure is only a function of λ, and p(λ) does not depend on the location. The
observed consistency indicates that the test setup works appropriately and p(λ) can be accurately
obtained. Similar consistencies were observed for other two test samples. It is very important to note
that Eq. (7.28) used to calculate the permeability-pressure function is the direct result of combining
the mass balance with the rational that pressure is only a function of λ. Since the mass balance is
always valid and p(λ) can be accurately obtained, the permeability function can thus be accurately
estimated based on Eq. (7.28). As previously stated, the use of three pressure transducers in the test
setup is for the validation purpose discussed above, although only one pressure transducer along
the core sample is adequate for practical applications. Because the pressure transducer closest to the
sample inlet has the biggest pressure range in which the rock sample can be considered to be infi￾nitely long in terms of gas flow, the pressure data from that transducer was analyzed for permea￾bility estimations in the rest of this section.
The pore pressure dependence of effective permeability determined using the observed p(λ) and
Eqs. (7.27) and (7.28) for Sample A at the confining stress of 4000 psi are presented in Figure 7.13.
The complex behavior shown in Figure 7.13 is because of the combined effects of Knudsen
diffusion/slippage flow and mechanical deformation. Within the pore pressure range below
1000 psi, the permeability decreases with increasing pore pressure because of the dominated effect
of Knudsen diffusion and slippage flow at low pore pressures. As shown by the theoretical results
given in Figure 7.9, the enhancement of effective permeability by Knudsen diffusion and slippage
flow becomes less significant at a larger pore pressure. For pore pressures larger than 1000 psi, the
permeability-pressure trend reverses and the permeability increases with increasing pore pressure

156 7 Tight Rock Permeability Measurement in Laboratorybecause the mechanical deformation becomes more important than the diffusion effect. At a given
confining stress, the increase in pore pressure enlarges pore sizes and consequently the
permeability.
The complexity of the permeability – pore pressure function shown in Figure 7.13 is highly rel￾evant to shale gas production in practice because the reservoir is subject to considerable pore pres￾sure changes during production. Our method provides a very efficient way to capture this
complexity. For example, the laboratory test for Sample A only took about 30 minutes to determine
the permeability curve shown in Figure 7.13. Essentially, the method measures a permeability￾pressure curve using the same amount of time as that used to measure a single permeability data
point via the “point-by-point” method. If five data points were needed for a reasonable represen￾tation of the permeability curve in Figure 7.13, the “point-by-point” method would take five times
longer than the current method.
The collapsed pressure curves shown in Figure 7.12, as discussed previously, indicate the validity
of the current method. Further comparisons with the other two methods including the steady-state
and late-time quasi-steady-state methods shown in Figure 7.13 demonstrate the validity of the pro￾posed method (Liu and Zhang 2020). The steady-state flow method was conducted using a short
core sample (0.5 in. long) obtained by cutting Sample A near its inlet, pore pressure of 1000 psi,
and confining pressure of 4000 psi. The obtained permeability is slightly higher, but still close
enough to the permeability value determined using the new method at the same confining and pore
pressures. The slight difference is expected because of the disturbance of rock samples during the
cutting and loading/unloading processes in the sample preparation and the test procedures.
The second method, called late-time quasi steady-state method in Figure 7.13, is to directly use
the late-time test data for estimating a permeability point. At the late time of the test, the
steady-state flow is approximately established between the sample inlet and the first pressure trans￾ducer. By assuming a steady-state flow there, a permeability at the corresponding pore pressure can
be obtained based on Darcy’s law, the measured flow rate into the core inlet and pressure gradient
between the inlet and the first pressure transducer. The estimated permeability is almost identical
to the value from the permeability curve at the given pore pressure.

7.4 Direct Measurement of Permeability-Pore Pressure Function 157As another example, Figure 7.14 shows the observed permeability as a function of pore pressure
for Sample B, which has much lower permeability values on the order of several nD at high pore
pressures than Sample A. Recall that Sample A has permeability values on the order of μD. Knud￾sen diffusion/slippage flow has a much more important effect on permeability at low pore pressures
for Sample B than Sample A (Figure 7.13), as evidenced by a more significant permeability enhance￾ment for Sample B. This is consistent with theoretical expectations because the diffusion effect is
more pronounced for smaller pore sizes corresponding to smaller permeability values. Interest￾ingly, the permeability for Sample B essentially remains unchanged with pore pressure for pore
pressures greater than 800 psi in Figure 7.14. This suggests that the mechanical deformation effect
on permeability is insignificant for Sample B under the test conditions (Figure 7.14). This is a result
of the fact that a lower permeability, or a smaller porosity, corresponds to a stiffer rock sample
(Jaeger et al. 2007).

158 7 Tight Rock Permeability Measurement in Laboratory7.5 Summary and Conclusions
The laboratory measurement of tight rock permeability is important for several related areas. In this
chapter, we briefly reviewed the commonly used laboratory methods for tight rock permeability
measurements, including the steady-state flow, PPD, and GRI methods, and then presented the
two newly developed laboratory methods.
Motivated by the fact that plug-scale tight rock matrix permeability cannot be measured with the
currently available laboratory methods for core samples with artificially induced fractures, we have
developed a method to measure both fracture and matrix permeability from them. These induced
fractures are common for highly laminated tight rocks mainly as a result of the stress release when
the samples are taken from the reservoir to the laboratory. Our method is a generalization of the con￾ventional PPD method and uses the early time data, dominated by fracture flow, to estimate fracture
permeability and the late time data, dominated by matrix flow, to estimate matrix permeability.
To deal with the inefficiency of the conventional methods that are based on linear theories for
fluid flow in core samples, we have also developed a laboratory method to directly measure, with a
single test run, the tight rock permeability as a function of pore pressure from a non-fractured rock
sample. It, unlike conventional methods, is based on a nonlinear theory of fluid flow in a core sam￾ple and can increase efficiency by at least multiple times for measuring the stress dependency of the
permeability.
Both methods were validated with laboratory measurements. The test results indicate that tight
rock permeability can be considerably stress-sensitive, and its stress-dependence behavior could be
quite complex owing to the combined effects of Knudsen diffusion/slippage flow and mechanical
deformation.

8.1 Introduction
The permeability of shales has attracted a considerable amount of research in the last decade.
Laboratory measurements that measure permeability as low as ~1 nD using gas or liquid on core
plugs under in situ stress conditions are now widely published (for example, Dong et al. 2010;
Rosen et al. 2014; Bhandari et al. 2015, 2018, 2019; Chhatre et al. 2015; Ismail and Zoback
2016; Kosanke and Warren 2016; Mckernan et al. 2017). These measurements, made under res￾ervoir stress conditions, remove many drawbacks of the Gas Research Institute (GRI) crushed
rock permeability measurement approach (Luffel and Guidry 1992; Luffel et al. 1993). For exam￾ple, the GRI method does not include the effect of in-situ stress. In addition, there is not a stand￾ard analytical approach, which leads to large measurement variability (Passey et al. 2010);
furthermore, it is not possible to study sample heterogeneity due to millimeter-scale stratigraphic
variation (Sinha et al. 2012). However, laboratory permeability testing on core plugs of clay-rich
lithofacies is challenging, and proper care is needed to understand the variable measure￾ments fully.
It is challenging to extract intact core plugs in clay-rich rocks due to disturbances that may occur
during both coring and sampling. Most core plugs show multiple bedding plane parallel micro￾fractures introduced during core retrieval, core storage, and/or plug extraction from the core. These
micro-fractures (Pluymakers et al. 2017) are considered to be related to dehydration of the core
when it is disturbed and possibly due to the release of stored internal strain energy due to stress
relief (Ougier-Simonin et al. 2016). The width to the length ratio (i.e. the aspect ratio) of such
micro-fractures is <10−2 and ranges between 10−5 and 10−3 (Kranz 1983; Ougier-Simonin et al.
2016). Some researchers (Luffel et al. 1993; Suarez-Rivera et al. 2012) argue that these micro￾fractures will remain partially open even if reservoir stress conditions are applied again in the lab￾oratory. Hence, they dominate the core plug-based measurements, and the measured permeability
may exceed the intact matrix permeability by several orders of magnitude (Luffel et al. 1993; Suarez￾Rivera et al. 2012). Even when the applied stress closes the artificial micro-fractures, the critical
confining stress required for micro-fracture closure is dependent on the rock facies and sample
quality (Suarez-Rivera et al. 2012; Rydzy et al. 2016). Recent results with variable sample quality
from the same lithological unit have shown that with confining stress cycling, the micro-fractures

shales, therefore, can be investigated after reversing the sample damage.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
1) show how permeability evolves with confining stress cycling in three different lithofacies and
illustrate the general realities of sample damage in clay-rich units,
2) infer matrix permeability behavior, and
3) link our lab-measured permeabilities and their stress dependence to the composition and pore
systems in shales.
8.2 Sample Descriptions
We present four samples representing three lithofacies: organic-rich siliceous mudstone (two sam￾ples), siltstone, and matrix-supported conglomerate. The tested core plugs (diameter = 38.1 mm;
length = 16.9 to 19.2 mm) were drilled with their longitudinal axis oriented parallel to the bedding
plane (i.e. horizontal plugs) from preserved vertical cores extracted from the same well. The
organic-rich siliceous mudstone (the most dominant lithofacies in the formation) and matrix￾supported conglomerate samples are from the Wolfcamp operational unit, and the siltstone sample
is from the Bone Spring Formation in the Delaware Basin, West Texas, USA (Ramiro-Ramirez
2022).
Bulk composition analyses of the core plugs’ end trimmings using X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) (Figure 8.1) show the organic-rich siliceous mudstone Samples 1 and 2 are composed of
45–52 vol% quartz and 24–33 vol% clays and have Leco TOC of 4 and 3 vol%, respectively. The silt￾stone has 52 vol% quartz, 13 vol% feldspars, 20 vol% dolomite, ~12 vol% clays, and Leco TOC of 1 vol
%. The matrix-supported conglomerate has 43 vol% content in calcite, 29 vol% quartz, 9 vol% clays,
and Leco TOC of 2 vol%. The vol% given here is calculated from the measured wt% using the density
of the minerals and Leco TOC.
We estimated the total porosity at the “as-received” condition by combining helium porosimetry
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The helium porosity was 4.4% for the
organic-rich siliceous mudstone Sample 1, 6.1% for Sample 2, 7.0% for the siltstone, and 2.0%
for the matrix-supported conglomerate. NMR measurements resulted in 6.3%, 8.3%, 1.8%, and
1.7% liquid-filled porosity, respectively.

.8.3 Permeability Test Program
The permeability test program for the organic-rich siliceous mudstone samples is shown in
Figure 8.2. It consists of one gas (argon) permeability measurement using the pulse decay method
(Brace et al. 1968; Bhandari et al. 2015) at confining stress of 13.8 MPa and then several liquid
(dodecane) permeability measurements using the steady-state method for two confining stress
cycles while maintaining the average pore pressure constant at ~7.0 MPa (see further details of
the steady-state method in the next paragraph): Cycle 1 (Tests 1–9) and Cycle 2 (Tests 9–21).
Due to time constraints, we stopped the experiment at Test 12 in the organic-rich siliceous
mudstone Sample 2.
We followed the same confining stress cycling (Figure 8.2) in the siltstone and matrix-supported
conglomerate samples. However, we did not conduct the gas permeability measurements and omit￾ted several liquid permeability measurements under some intermediate stress conditions. We
directly saturated these samples with dodecane. We measured permeability under stress conditions
for Tests 4–7, 9, 11–12, 14–16, 19, and 21 on the siltstone sample and at stress conditions for Tests 6,
9, 12, 16, 19, and 21 on the matrix-supported conglomerate sample. During these tests, we main￾tained a constant pressure of 6.55–6.81 MPa on the downstream side and first applied a pressure
differential typically of 0.69–0.17 MPa across the core plug (therefore, the pressure on the upstream
side is higher than the pressure on the downstream side, and this pressure difference drives the
flow) to estimate the flow rate. Then, we applied the constant flow rate on the upstream side while
maintaining constant pressure on the downstream side. This way, we maintained the average pore
pressure (arithmetic average of the upstream pressure and the downstream pressure) constant at

8.3 Permeability Test Program 165~7.0 MPa. The total test duration for each sample is ~1 month. The experimental setup and test
procedures are described in detail by Bhandari et al. (2019), Ramiro-Ramirez et al. (2020), and
Ramiro-Ramirez (2022).
Due to the extremely low fluid flow rates involved, measuring the nano-Darcy range permeability
using the steady-state technique in low-permeability rocks is challenging. To accomplish these
measurements, we limited our leaks to usually below 10% of the lowest flow rate required (on
the order of 1 × 10−5 ml/min) and used a high-precision pump with a flow rate resolution of
0.12 nl/min. In addition, we maintained the temperature of the experimental setup stable at
30.0 C (max. deviation <±0.1 C; std. deviation = ±0.04 C) using a temperature control system.
8.4 Permeability Behavior with Confining Stress Cycling
Figure 8.3 shows the effective permeability to dodecane versus the effective stress Pc − Pp for four
samples studied here. The samples behaved differently with the confining stress cycling. The per￾meability of organic-rich siliceous mudstone Sample 1 exhibited the most stress dependence, and
siltstone showed the least stress dependence.
The stress dependence of permeability varied within a narrow range (1.4 × 10−18 m2 − 1.2 ×
10−18 m2
) for the siltstone sample. The permeability decline with increasing effective stress (from
7.0 to 58.5 MPa) is less than 10%. The permeability of organic-rich siliceous mudstone Sample 1
declined by more than three orders of magnitude (from 4.4 × 10−17 m2 to 2.0 × 10−20 m2
) while
increasing the Pc − Pp from 7.0 to 58.5 MPa. It also exhibited significant hysteresis (permeability
decrease during loading was not recovered during unloading) in both cycles. The permeability
of the organic-rich siliceous mudstone (Sample 2) initially at Pc − Pp = 7.0 MPa was 1.6 × 10−19 m2
,
which is considerably lower than that of Sample 1 (compare orange triangles to blue circles,
Figure 8.3). Sample 2 exhibited a relatively small decline from 1.6 × 10−19 m2 to 3.3 × 10−20 m2
during loading and then a slight increase to 5.3 × 10−20 m2 during unloading in Cycle 1. Next, the
permeability decreased slightly to 2.7 × 10−20 m2 at Pc − Pp = 30.3 MPa as we reloaded it in Cycle 2.
The matrix-supported conglomerate sample has a permeability of 5.9 × 10−20 m2 at Pc − Pp =
30.9 MPa, and it increased to 1.0 × 10−19 m2 at Pc − Pp = 6.9 MPa. It decreased slowly to
3.6 × 10−20 m2 (i.e. a 60% decline) upon loading to Pc − Pp = 58.5 MPa, and increased slightly
to 6.6 × 10−20 m2 upon unloading and did not recover fully (in contrast to the siltstone sample).
The initial permeability was 4.4 × 10−17 m2 for the organic-rich siliceous mudstone Sample 1 and
1.6 × 10−19 m2 for Sample 2. This difference in measured permeability may be attributed to the sam￾ple quality. The μ − CT image of mudstone Sample 1 (Figure 8.4a), taken before permeability test￾ing, shows multiple bedding-parallel micro-fractures, whereas Sample 2 is more intact
(Figure 8.4b). The μ − CT images of the samples (voxel size = 24.6 μm) taken after permeability
testing (Figure 8.5a,b) show that these micro-fractures were closed substantially by the testing proc￾ess. Sample 1 had more permeability hysteresis than Sample 2: its permeability declined much more
with increasing stress, and the permeability did not increase as much when the sample was
unloaded. We interpret that the micro-fractures close during testing and do not reopen to their ini￾tial state even after reducing the confining stress to the original condition. The effect is more dra￾matic with Sample 1 than Sample 2 because it is more damaged initially. These results show that it
is important to understand the sample quality before permeability testing to interpret the stress
dependence of permeability correctly.
166 8 Stress-Dependent Matrix Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir RocksThe siltstone and matrix-supported conglomerate samples look intact with no visible micro￾fractures (Figure 8.4c,d) and appear to be relatively free from sampling artifacts (within the voxel
resolution of ~25 μm). These samples have much less permeability hysteresis. Cement, bonding the
grains, may make these samples more intact. Ramiro-Ramirez et al. (2020) reported that the dol￾omitic calcareous sandstone and other carbonate-bearing lithofacies (due to the presence of
cement) showed less coring-induced microfractures than organic-rich siliceous mudstone
core plugs.

sampling depth in the Wolfcamp operational unit (based on 0.67–0.90 psi/ft pore pressure gradient, 0.95–1.05
psi/ft lateral stress gradient, and 1.05–1.075 psi/ft vertical stress gradient) is indicated by the double
arrow sign.
8.4 Permeability Behavior with Confining Stress Cycling 167We interpret that the matrix permeability of the organic-rich siliceous mudstone ranged
from 2.0 × 10−20 m2 to 5.0 × 10−20 m2 as the effective stress increased from 7.0 to 58.5 MPa
(Figure 8.3). For Sample 1, we interpret that the micro-fractures closed after the maximum effective
stress of 58.3 MPa was applied in the second cycle. We also concluded that the permeability of
2.0 × 10−20 m2 to 3.0 × 10−20 m2 measured during unloading (Pc − Pp = 58.3 − 31.4 MPa ) char￾acterize the matrix permeability. There may be partial re-opening of micro-fractures below Pc −
Pp = 31.4 MPa as the permeability increases significantly from the log-linear trend. For Sample
2 (which has a slightly higher clay content, see Figure 8.1), we interpret that the permeability
decline during the first cycle was due to the closure of micro-fractures, and we essentially closed
the micro-fractures at lower effective stress (37.4 MPa). The permeability measured after reloading
the sample ranged from 5.0 × 10−20 m2 to 3.0 × 10−20 m2 as the Pc − Pp increased from 7.0 to
31.4 MPa; these values are likely to characterize the matrix permeability at the in-situ effective
stress (Pc − Pp = 7.0 − 31.4 MPa). These permeability values are consistent with the matrix perme￾ability estimate of 1.0 × 10−20 m2 derived from a dual-time scale pressure dissipation behavior based
on history-matching the initial pulse decay experiment data using argon gas in a fractured core
model (see Bhandari et al. 2019).

168 8 Stress-Dependent Matrix Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir RocksWe showed that sample damage introduced during core retrieval, core storage, and/or plug
extraction from cores can significantly increase permeability under low confining stress conditions,
especially in organic-rich siliceous mudstone. However, after cycling the confining stress to in situ
effective mean stress conditions (Pp − Pp = 7.0 − 31.4 MPa), Figure 8.3) and significantly beyond
them (up to Pc − Pp = 58.5 MPa), we showed it is possible to reverse such sample damage in mud￾stones. Through this approach, we demonstrated how to interpret the matrix permeability of the
rock based on permeability behavior under various stress conditions. We infer that the clays (due to
their higher ductility than other mineral components) play a crucial role in closing these artificial
micro-fractures during stress cycling. In the case of Sample 1, our lower-quality sample, effective
stresses (up to Pc − Pp = 58.5 MPa) significantly higher than the in situ stress (Pp − Pp = 7.0 −
31.4 MPa) were required to completely close micro-fractures. At these stresses, there may be
permanent (plastic) compression of pore throats in the matrix in addition to micro-fracture closure.

8.4 Permeability Behavior with Confining Stress Cycling 169It is possible that this may play a role in the observed permeability versus effective stress response.
However, since the effect of compressibility of the micro-fractures compared to the matrix is
relatively large before micro-fractures closure (Milch et al. 2016; Rydzy et al. 2016), we anticipate
the effect of pore throats contraction on the measured overall permeability to be relatively small.
Figure 8.6 illustrates how micro-fractures and matrix pores contribute to the measured
permeability in mudstones. The micro-fractures closure stress depends on sample quality and
rock facies (composition). Before micro-fractures closure, the micro-fractures dominate flow
significantly. After micro-fractures closure, the matrix pores contribute to flow significantly.
The micro-fractures do not reopen during unloading until the confining stress is lowered to values
much lower than the closure stress.
8.5 Matrix Permeability Behavior
We have shown that it is more challenging to determine permeability in mudstone samples than in
siltstone or matrix-supported conglomerate sample because these samples are more likely to suffer
disturbance. However, we suggest it is possible to infer the matrix permeability and its dependence
on stress, if a comprehensive testing program is conducted over a range of effective stresses (Pc −
Pp = 7.0 − 58.5 MPa).
Figure 8.7 shows the interpreted matrix permeabilities at different effective stresses for our sam￾ples. These permeability values were extracted from the second loading/unloading cycle
(Figure 8.3), i.e. after closing micro-fractures present in the rocks. The matrix permeability of

170 8 Stress-Dependent Matrix Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir Rocksthe siltstone is nearly constant with effective stress and around 1.2 × 10−18 m2
( 1200 nD) for
8 MPa < Pc − Pp < 58 MPa. This is almost two orders of magnitude greater than the matrix￾supported conglomerate and the organic-rich siliceous mudstone. Our mudstone samples have per￾meabilities ranging between 2.0 × 10−20 m2
(20 nD) to 5.3 × 10−20 m2
(54 nD), in accord with other
core-plug-based measurements (Rafatian and Capsan 2015; Mathur et al. 2016; King et al. 2018) and
in situ well testing (Zhan et al. 2016, 2017) reported for Wolfcamp mudstones. We also compared
our liquid permeability measurements with the gas permeability measurements using the GRI
crushed rock method (Figure 8.7). Interestingly, the equivalent liquid permeability for the
organic-rich siliceous mudstone Sample 1 (inverted triangle) is 7.4 × 10−19 m2
( 75 nD) and for
the organic-rich siliceous mudstone Sample 2 (circle) is 8.5 × 10−20 m2
( 86 nD). These GRI mea￾surements were conducted under zero confining stress and at a low gas pressure (0.7 − 1.4 MPa or
100 − 200 psi). We followed the same approach as given in Bhandari et al. (2015) to correct the Klin￾kenberg effect (Klinkenberg 1941). Now we can relate the matrix permeability with the pore space
characteristics. This allows us to identify what controls fluid flow at the pore level and explain the
differences in permeability among lithofacies.

), and k0 is the permeability (m2
) at zero effective stress. We find α of 0.0027,
0.0118, and 0.0128 MPa−1 for the siltstone sample, matrix-supported conglomerate, and organic￾rich siliceous mudstone, respectively. The higher pore throat compressibility in mudstone suggests
the clay and TOC contents play a crucial role in the stress-dependence of permeability.
The matrix permeability at Pc − Pp = 30.9 MPa (Figure 8.7) correlate to pore space characteristics
and pore-throat size distribution observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging
(Figure 8.8) and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements (Figure 8.9). The pore
system of the organic-rich siliceous samples (for example, see Figure 8.8a for Sample 2) is domi￾nated by nanometer-size interparticle pores between clays, quartz, and carbonate grains and nan￾ometer-size pores within the organic matter. In contrast, the pore system in the siltstone is
predominantly composed of micrometer-sized (up to ~15 μm) interparticle pores (Figure 8.8b).
The intraparticle pores are primarily in the nanometer-size range but may occasionally be a few
micrometers (~2 − 10 μm) in size. The mercury injection capillary pressure measurements
(Figure 8.9a) reveal that the peak (i.e. the mode) pore throat radius (Figure 8.9b) is less than
0.01 μm (10 nm) for the mudstone samples (k = 2.7 − 2.9 × 10−20 m2
), slightly larger than
~0.01 μm for the matrix-supported conglomerate sample (k = 6.8 × 10−20 m2
), and ~0.1 μm for
the siltstone sample (k = 1.2 × 10−18 m2
).
8.6 Concluding Remarks
This chapter examined the permeability evolution under cycling confining stress conditions
(14.0–65.5 MPa) of siltstone, matrix-supported conglomerate, and organic-rich siliceous mudstone
samples. We showed that confining stress cycling is crucial to close the micro-fractures in mud￾stones created from sampling disturbance. In addition, we demonstrated approaches to interpret
the matrix permeability behavior and its actual stress dependence.

172 8 Stress-Dependent Matrix Permeability in Unconventional Reservoir RocksWe found the bedding parallel matrix permeability in the siltstone sample (~1.2 × 10−18 m2
) is
two-orders-of-magnitude greater than the matrix-supported conglomerate and organic-rich sili￾ceous samples (~5.0 × 10−20 m2 to 2.0 × 10−20 m2
). These measured values agree with the observed
pore throat radius distributions and pore systems; the organic-rich siliceous samples have smaller
pore throats. In addition, the organic-rich siliceous mudstone matrix permeability exhibited the
highest stress dependence. For instance, the pore throat compressibility coefficient in mudstone
is 0.0128 MPa−1
, five times higher than the siltstone. We attribute this to the greater compressibility
of pore throats primarily situated in the clays and organic matter.
The keys to successfully measuring permeability in unconventional reservoir rocks are select￾ing high-quality samples, completely saturating the core plug with the test fluid, minimizing
leaks in the pore fluid lines, precisely controlling temperature, and cycling the confining stress.
Micro-CT imaging is a valuable tool to select high-quality samples. Stress cycling is crucial to
close the artificial micro-fractures in mudstones, as has been demonstrated previously in other
lithologies. Finally, it is becoming possible to reliably examine layer-to-layer permeability varia￾tions to explore the stratigraphic heterogeneity and better understand the drainage mechanism in
shale reservoirs.

9.1 Introduction
The exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale have become a success over the past
two decades (Curtis 2002). However, the sustainable and economic development of shale resources
is complicated by the wettability characteristics of shales (e.g. Hu et al. 2015). In reservoir engineer￾ing, wettability is commonly described as the preference of a solid surface to be in contact with one
fluid rather than another. Based on the contact angle value between a fluid droplet and a rock
surface, the wettability can be determined as water-wet, oil-wet, and intermediate-wet (Craig
1971; Anderson 1986a). Water- and oil-wet surfaces may co-exist within a single reservoir rock
and cause the rock to be both water- and oil-wet, with such rock called to be mixed-wet
(Salathiel 1973). Such a mixed-wet characteristic was reported for siliceous shale by many research￾ers such as Takahashi and Kovscek (2010). Wettability influences the hydrocarbon accumulation in
reservoir rocks, and consequently the primary or secondary migration of oil and gas within source
or reservoir rocks (Schowalter 1979; Thomas and Clouse 1990). It can significantly affect hydrocar￾bon recovery efficiency from reservoirs (Morrow 1990). For shale reservoirs, wettability controls the
optimal selection of fracturing fluids (Bai et al. 2013; Xu and Dehghanpour 2014). Consequently, it
is quite meaningful to accurately determine the shale wettability (Sharifigaliuk et al. 2021).
Conventional reservoir rocks (e.g. carbonate or sandstone) usually have high permeability and
relatively homogeneous mineral composition (e.g. carbonates consist mainly of different forms
of calcium carbonate). The wettability of conventional reservoir rocks can be determined by the
US Bureau of Mines (USBM) test, the Amott test, and contact angle measurement (Amott 1959;
Anderson 1986b). In contrast, fine-grained (with grain sizes <62.5 μm) shale has extremely low
permeability and contains brittle minerals, ductile clay minerals, and organic matter (OM)
(Chalmers et al. 2012; Loucks et al. 2012; Arif et al. 2021). Clean brittle minerals and clay minerals
are mostly water-wet, while OM is oil-wet (Odusina et al. 2011; Xu and Dehghanpour 2014). As a
result, shale has a mixed wettability at μm-scaled grain sizes. Tight shale requires a very high
displacement pressure due to its ultra-low nano-darcy permeability, which invalidates the usage
of Amott and USBM tests in determining shale wettability (Xu and Dehghanpour 2014). Further￾more, the interaction between OM and minerals over the long geological history could also change

and contamination (Morrow 1990).
9.2 Spontaneous Imbibition Theory
Spontaneous imbibition (SI) is a useful approach to defining the mixed wettability of reservoir rocks
(Anderson 1986b). SI has been extensively applied for shale reservoirs following the successful
shale gas exploitation in North America since 2000s.
SI is a capillary-force driven process, during which a wetting fluid displaces a non-wetting one
under the influence of capillary suction and sometimes additional gravitational force. Eq. (9.1) was
proposed by Handy (1960) to describe the SI process within a water-air system, in which imbibition
occurs vertically upward with a negligible gravitational force:
Q2
w = 2Pckw A2Sw
μw
t 9 1
where Qw is the volume of water imbibed into the sample, Pc is the capillary pressure, kw is the
effective permeability to water, is porosity, A is the cross-sectional area of sample, Sw is fractional
water content of pore space, t is imbibition time, and μw is the viscosity of water.
Handy’s equation can be simplified as,
H = at0 5 9 2
where H is the cumulative imbibition height (cm) which equals Qw/A and a is sorptivity (cm /s−0.5;
Philip 1957).
Handy’s equation (Eq. 9.1) is based on three assumptions: (i) the wetting front moves in a piston￾like manner, (ii) the pressure gradient in the gas phase ahead of the wetting front can be neglected,
and (iii) the gravitational forces are much less than capillary force. Handy’s equation indicates that
the cumulative imbibition height is proportional to the square root of the imbibition time, so that
theoretically an imbibition slope of 0.5 should be obtained if the Log cumulative imbibition height
is plotted versus Log imbibition time. However, three types of water imbibition slopes were reported
in natural rocks by Hu et al. (2012, 2015), which are the theoretical value of 0.5, 0.26, and 0.26
transitioning to 0.5. Percolation theory indicates that the lower water imbibition slope of 0.26 is
an indication of low water-wet pore connectivity (Stauffer and Aharony 1994; Hunt et al. 2014).
The imbibition process is influenced by multiple factors such as fluid viscosity and temperature,
wettability, boundary conditions (e.g. initial saturation), and pore structure of the rock (Zhang and
Austad 2006). The scaling of SI data is deemed to be an effective method to investigate the control￾ling factors of SI process. Mattax and Kyte (1962) presented a scaling equation, which was later
revised by Zhang et al. (1996) and Ma et al. (1997) as Eq. (9.3).

where tD is dimensionless time, t is imbibition time (s), k is absolute permeability (m2
), σ is inter￾facial tension (N/m) between wetting and non-wetting phases, μwe is the viscosity of wetting phase
(Pa/s), μnw is the viscosity of non-wetting phase (Pa/s), and Lc is the characteristic length (m) to be
defined as,
178 9 Assessment of Shale Wettability from Spontaneous Imbibition ExperimentsLc = Vb

i = 1
Ai lAi
9 4
where Vb is the bulk volume of sample (m3
), n is the total number of surfaces open to imbibition, Ai
is the area open to imbibition in the ith direction (m2
), and lAi is the distance that the wetting front
travels from the imbibition face to the non-flow boundary (m).
Imbibition data can be modified to compensate for differences in boundary conditions, interfacial
tension, permeability, and porosity by using Eq. (9.3). However, wettability, the remaining factor, is
not considered when different fluids are used in SI process. As a result, the difference in imbibition
behavior, after scaling the imbibition data using Eq. (9.3), is mainly controlled by sample
wettability.
Due to the possible interaction between imbibing fluids and shale components, the imbibition
slope of the first-time experimental run with imbibition of either water or n-decane (a surrogate
oil phase used to probe the oil-wetting characteristics of the samples) is mainly used to evaluate
the shale wettability (Gao and Hu 2016).
9.3 Samples and Analytical Methods
9.3.1 SI Experiments
During imbibition experiments, shale samples were cut into rectangular prisms. All sides, except for
the top and bottom, were coated with quick-cure epoxy to generate co-current imbibition in the
vertical direction. Hu et al. (2001) presented the SI experimental procedure and data processing
in detail. Before the shale samples were used in the SI experiments, they were oven-dried at 60 C
for at least 48 hours in order to remove the moisture in the collected pore space to obtain a
constant initial water saturation.
The imbibing fluids were water and n-decane, and their physical properties are listed in Table 9.1.
For either liquid, air is always deemed to be the displaced non-wetting phase in SI experiments.
During water imbibition experiments, additional beakers of water were placed inside the imbibi￾tion chamber to minimize the evaporation of fluid (water) reservoir. These beakers of water were
not used in n-decane imbibition experiments. In addition, as the wettability of the shale samples
could be changed by imbibed n-decane, replicate imbibition tests were not conducted on the same
sample during n-decane imbibition.
In order to investigate the effect of layered characteristics of shale samples on SI behaviors, we
carried out SI experiments in two directions by coating the sample surfaces differently (Figure 9.1);
the symbols P or T are used to designate whether the direction of imbibition was either parallel or
transverse to the lamination. In addition to the imbibition tests, vapor absorption tests were carried

9.3.2 Barnett Shale from United States
The Barnett Formation is a Mississippian-age marine shelf deposit present in at least eighteen coun￾ties covering the Fort Worth Basin in north-central Texas. The Barnett Formation is divided into
three members: upper Barnett Shale section, Forestburg Limestone section, and the lower Barnett
Shale section (Loucks and Ruppel 2007).
The location of the Blakely #1 (API 497-33041) well was presented by Loucks and Ruppel (2007).
The average vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of the Blakely #1 well core samples is about 1.35% to fall into
the gas window (Loucks et al. 2009). Four samples from this Blakely #1 well at depths of 7136 ft
(2175.0 m), 7169 ft (2185.1 m), 7199 ft (2194.2 m), and 7219 ft (2200.4 m) were used in this study
(Table 9.2).
The dimensions of all the Barnett Shale samples used in the SI experiments are listed in Table 9.2.
We also conducted mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests to determine the pore-throat size
distribution of these shale samples, following the size-pressure relationship of Washburn (1921).
Micromeritics AutoPore IV 9510 was used to perform MIP tests in this study. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analyses were also performed to obtain the mineralogy information of powder-sized samples
by using a Rigaku Ultima IV XRD.
9.3.3 Silurian Longmaxi Formation and Triassic Yanchang Formation Shales
from China
The Longmaxi Formation contains relatively high TOC content (1.0–4.0 wt.%) and type I kerogen,
and is overmature with equivalent vitrinite reflectance (Requ) value of 2.8–3.0% (Liang et al. 2014).
Yanchang Formation with lower thermal maturity contains two main shale sections of Chang 7 and
Chang 9.
Three Longmaxi Formation Shale samples from different depths in the southeastern Chongqing
area were used in this study. In addition, four Yanchang Formation (Chang 7 with a Ro range of
0.83–1.02%) Shale samples from the Ordos Basin were studied (Xiong et al. 2016). The locations of
the Ordos Basin and Sichuan Basin are shown in Figure 9.2, while the detailed information of all
the Longmaxi and Yanchang Shale samples used in the SI experiments is listed in Table 9.3.

e Water imbibition tests were repeated at least three times on the same cubic sample. When both water and n-decane SI experiments were performed on the same sample, the
n-decane experiment was always carried out after the water ones.The TOC content was measured using a CS-230 carbon and sulfur analyzer (Leco Corp, United
States), and the mineral composition was obtained by PANalytical X’ Pert PRO X-ray diffractom￾eter. Micromeritics AutoPore IV 9510 was used to perform MIP tests to determine pore-throat dia￾meters at macropores (>50 nm) (Hu et al. 2017). Quantachrome Autosorb IQ was employed to
perform N2 physisorption experiments in order to obtain the pore size information of mesopores
(2–50 nm) (Sing et al. 1985). Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) imaging was
conducted to directly observe shale pore structure at two-dimensional shale surface, and the
three-dimensional (3D) pore structures were also reconstructed using focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM.
9.3.4 Jurassic Ziliujing Formation Shale from China
The Jurassic lacustrine Ziliujing Formation from the northeastern Sichuan Basin has a good
potential for shale gas exploitation (Guo 2016). The Da’anzhai Member Shale of the Ziliujing
Formation contains relatively high TOC (>1 wt.%) with mainly type II1–II2 OM and Ro values from
1.05 to 1.82% (Li et al. 2013).
We selected four Da’anzhai Member Shale samples from X Well in northeastern Sichuan Basin,
and Table 9.4 presents detailed information of all the Ziliujing Formation Shale samples used in SI
experiments.
As for other shales, an X-ray diffractometer was used to obtain the mineralogy of these samples.
The TOC content was measured by a CS-230 carbon and sulfur analyzer. Quantachrome PoreMas￾terGT 60 was used to perform MIP tests in order to obtain the pore-throat size distribution of these
Ziliujing Formation samples. In addition, shale samples were Ar-ion-beam milling processed and
then went through FE-SEM tests for pore typing.

), and V is
the sample volume (cm3
). If all the pore spaces are occupied by imbibed fluid, the value of WD
should be 1.
Based on imbibition plots, water imbibition behavior can be divided into four stages with their
own representative slopes (Becker 2019; Hu et al. 2019). Stage I lasts a few seconds and shows the
highest rate of change among all four stages but can have fluctuations resulting from the initial
sample settling. Once the sample has settled, it comes to Stage II, when the sample first imbibes
fluid. Stage II shows the second highest rate of change among all four stages due to the edge￾accessible pores and microfractures being invaded first. Stage III starts when fluid has filled the
edge-accessible pores and begins to enter the inner pore network. Stage III with a nearly linear
and constant slope is used to represent the connectivity of pore networks for the sample. If present,
Stage IV is the last stage when fluid reaches the sample top. The imbibition slope of Stage III,
together with dimensionless imbibed weight, is used to characterize the wettability of our shale
samples.
9.4.1.1 Wettability of Barnett Shale
More oil-wet samples have a higher n-decane imbibition slope than water imbibition, for both P and
T samples (the symbols P or T are used to designate imbibition direction to be parallel, or transverse,
to the lamination). Similar n-decane imbibition behavior was observed for the P and T samples of
B7136 Forestburg Limestone (Figure 9.3a). Both B7136 Pa and B7136 Tb shale samples began to
imbibe n-decane as soon as they contacted n-decane. The imbibing direction had little impact

9.4 Results and Discussion 185on the n-decane imbibition, which indicated that n-decane could move more freely either along or
across the lamination for its better wettability and connectivity. The n-decane and water imbibition
curves of B7136 samples are shown in Figure 9.3a,b, respectively. The water and n-decane imbibi￾tion curves are compared in Figure 9.3c. The slope of n-decane experiments is about 0.43 nearly
twice as large as the slope of water experiments on the same sample, which indicated its more
oil-wet characteristics.
For more water-wet shale samples, P and T samples, which were different samples and from the
same rock, always show different n-decane imbibition behaviors. During the first 10 minutes,
almost no n-decane entered B7169 Ta but a large amount of n-decane imbibed into B7169 Pa
(Figure 9.3d). The results of n-decane vapor absorption experiments for B7169 samples are also
shown in Figure 9.3d, which show a shape similar to the n-decane imbibition curve of B7169
Ta. Because of the more water-wet characteristics of the sample, n-decane did not enter the
T samples during the first 30 minutes. However, during this period, n-decane vapor may fill the
pore spaces to change the sample wettability to a more oil-wet condition. Therefore this would
cause the increased n-decane imbibition in these shale samples. The experimental results of
P samples, however, suggest different controlling factors. The n-decane imbibition curve of
B7169 Pa appears to be much closer to a more oil-wet imbibition plot, which is probably caused
by n-decane migration within some cracks parallel to the lamination. There was no significant dif￾ference between P and T tests of water imbibition (Figure 9.3e). Wetting fluid can migrate freely
along or across the lamination. The water and n-decane imbibition plots of B7169 and B7219 sam￾ples are presented in Figure 9.3f,g, respectively.
B7199 samples showed intermediate imbibition behavior (Figure 9.3h). The water imbibition of
B7199 P and T samples showed different behaviors, and the imbibition slope of P sample was
greater, which was different from more water-wet samples. The P sample imbibed much more
n-decane than the T sample at the beginning of the experiment, similar to the more water-wet sam￾ples. However, B7199 Tb began to imbibe n-decane in a linear fashion at the very beginning (at
about two minutes), which was similar to the more oil-wet sample B7136. The n-decane imbibition
of T samples has a higher slope than the water imbibition, which indicates the oil-wet tendency of
B7199 samples. Consequently, B7199 is considered as mixed-wet.
9.4.1.2 Properties of Barnett Samples and Their Correlation to Wettability
Results of MIP tests are shown in Figure 9.4. The dominant pore-throat sizes of Barnett samples
derived from MIP analyses are less than 0.1 μm (at 70–80%). An appreciable amount of micron￾sized pores were also observed in MIP analyses (Figure 9.4). All of our samples have a similar vol￾ume controlled by pore-throat diameters at larger than 60 μm (Figure 9.4). These large “pores” are
probably related to micro-cracks. Hu et al. (2014) presented the SEM images of B7219 sample,
showing the existence of micro-cracks with widths of several micrometers.
The mineralogical composition of Barnett samples is presented in Table 9.5. The B7136 samples
have much higher carbonate content than other siliceous mudstones. Although the pure calcite
mineral is water-wet, the reaction between carbonates and organic fluids from the maturation
of OM-rich shale could lead to a less hydrophilic wettability (Legens et al. 1998), which could
be used to interpret the more oil-wet characteristics of B7136 samples.
For siliceous samples, OM plays an important role in affecting the wettability. Generally, OM￾hosted pores are oil-wet, and the inorganic pores are water-wet (Odusina et al. 2011). The porosities
of these Barnett samples are positively related with TOC values. The volume fraction of <10 nm
pores increases with an increasing TOC content: 18%, 50%, 53%, and 61% for B7136, B7169,
186 9 Assessment of Shale Wettability from Spontaneous Imbibition ExperimentsB7219, and B7199, respectively (Figure 9.5). Consequently, B7199 sample with the highest TOC
content could contain more OM-hosted pores than B7169 and B7219 samples, which contributes
to their wettability differences. For more water-wet B7169 and B7219 samples, the water-wet pores
are better connected, compared with oil-wet OM-hosted pores, and easier to form continuous
water-wet pathways. While for mixed-wet B7199 sample, OM-hosted nanopores become abundant
and are better connected, which could form continuous (though sparsely) oil-wet pathways in addi￾tion to water-wet pathways.
9.4.1.3 Low Pore Connectivity to Water of Barnett Samples
Our results reported in Table 9.6 show that the water imbibition slopes (around 0.28) of Barnett
samples are much lower than the theoretical 0.5 value, which shows the low pore connectivity
to water for these Barnett samples.

9.4.2.1 TOC and Mineralogy
The main compositional differences between Longmaxi and Yanchang Shale formations are
the TOC and clay minerals (Table 9.7). The TOC contents of Yanchang Shale are much higher
(5–8 wt.%) than Longmaxi Shale (1–4 wt.%). The clay minerals of Yanchang Shale samples are
mainly mixed layer (illite/smectite) clay mineral, while illite is the dominant clay mineral in the
Longmaxi Shale.
9.4.2.2 Pore Structure Difference Between Longmaxi and Yanchang Samples
The pore structure derived from MIP tests is shown in Figure 9.6a. The macropore volume of
Yanchang samples, except for sample Y4, is much greater than the Longmaxi samples. The meso￾pore size distribution obtained from N2 physisorption is shown in Figure 9.6b, and the mesopore
volume of the Longmaxi samples is greater than that of the Yanchang samples.

The representative FE-SEM images are presented in Figur 9.7 for respectfully L1, Y1, and Y2
samples. It can be observed that OM pores (Figure 9.7a), inter-particle pores around calcite
(Figure 9.7b), and intercrystalline pores within pyrite (Figure 9.7c) are the main pore types within
L1 sample. The pores within clay minerals are nearly eliminated because the clay minerals are
strongly compacted during the diagenesis of L1 sample, as shown by Figure 9.7d. However, for

190 9 Assessment of Shale Wettability from Spontaneous Imbibition Experiments(Figure 9.7f,j) and pores within clay minerals (Figure 9.7g,k) are the two dominant pore types, but
the OM pores are poorly developed (Figure 9.7e,i). OM pores with circular shapes could be occa￾sionally found in Y1 sample (Figure 9.7h). Furthermore, some micro-fractures are observed in Y2
sample (Figure 9.7l).
The reconstructed 3D pore network of L1 sample and Y3 sample by FIB-SEM are shown in
Figure 9.8a–c and d–f, respectively. The pore size information extracted from 3D images of L1
and Y3 samples are presented in Figure 9.8g,h. The median pore size (pore diameter corresponding
to 50% of total cumulative frequency) of Y3 sample is about 90 nm, while it is only about 35 nm for
L1 sample.
The average porosity of Yanchang Shale samples is 2.26%, which is greater than 0.73% of the aver￾age porosity of Longmaxi samples (Table 9.8). However, the average BET surface area of Longmaxi
samples is 12.24 m2
/g much greater than the average BET surface area of Yanchang samples, which
is 2.30 m2
/g.
9.4.2.3 Water and Oil Imbibition Experiments
The triplicate imbibition curves of samples L1 T1 and Y1 T1 are presented in Figure 9.9a,b. The
water imbibition slopes of all T samples are listed in Table 9.9. As can be seen, the reported slopes
are less than the theoretical value of 0.5, which indicates the low water-wet pore connectivity of our
samples. The relationship between the 1st water imbibition slope of T samples and MIP porosity is
shown in Figure 9.9c. Although there is no unique relationship in characterizing the imbibition
slope and porosity for these seven samples, linear relationships with high correlations exist in Long￾maxi and Yanchang samples. The first water imbibition slope is positively related to the porosity,
which indicates that the higher the porosity is, the better its water-wet pore connectivity is. As to the
reproducibility and stability of water imbibition experiments, Samples L1 T1 and Y1 T1 with the
highest clay contents exhibit the poorest reproducibility among Longmaxi and Yanchang samples
(Table 9.9). The strong interaction between water and clay minerals changes the pore structure and
finally affects the imbibition behaviors of both Longmaxi and Yanchang Shales.
For convenience, the first water or n-decane imbibition slope is listed together with sample infor￾mation in Table 9.10. The imbibition slopes of three samples (L1 P2, Y2 T2, and Y4 T2) are not
available (too low values) due to the negligible weight of imbibed n-decane in imbibition
experiments.

9.4 Results and Discussion 193Based on the oil imbibition slopes of T samples, Longmaxi samples L2 and L3 show higher oil-wet
pore connectivity, while Yanchang samples Y2 and Y4 show lower oil-wet pore connectivity with
almost no n-decane imbibed. For other samples, the oil imbibition slope of T samples is around
0.26, which indicates the low oil-wet pore connectivity of these samples.
Unlike the high slope of T samples, the water imbibition slope of P samples indeed shows a
weakly positive relationship with porosity (Figure 9.9d), which means that the higher porosity
is also good for the formation of connected water-wet pathway along the bedding planes.

194 9 Assessment of Shale Wettability from Spontaneous Imbibition ExperimentsThe oil imbibition behaviors are quite different between the Longmaxi and Yanchang samples.
The n-decane imbibition slopes of Yanchang T samples are no more than 0.27 and two samples (Y2
and Y4) show almost no n-decane imbibition (Table 9.10). However, the n-decane imbibition slopes
of Yanchang P samples are greater than 0.3 and those reported for T samples. The preferential path￾way of oil migration in the Yanchang samples is probably caused by the developed bedding planes
and more water-wet wettability.
Compared with the Yanchang samples, the Longmaxi Shale T samples show greater n-decane
imbibition slopes (Table 9.10), which is related to the more developed OM-hosted pores in these
Longmaxi samples.

196 9 Assessment of Shale Wettability from Spontaneous Imbibition Experiments9.4.2.4 Wettability of Longmaxi and Yanchang Shale Samples Deduced from SI Experiments
For the Longmaxi samples, the water imbibition slope of P samples is greater than that of the
T samples, and the n-decane imbibition slope of T samples is much greater than the water imbi￾bition slope of T samples (Table 9.10), both of which indicate the more oil-wet property of these
shale samples. In such samples, the migration of water across the bedding planes is restricted, while
the oil phase could move across the bedding planes more easily. The more oil-wet wettability of the
Longmaxi samples largely depends on their pore structure, which is significantly controlled by its
high thermal maturity. The well-developed OM-related pores are easier to form a connected oil-wet
pathway within these Longmaxi samples, as shown in Figure 9.7a,b.
For the Yanchang samples, the transport of oil phase across the bedding planes is more difficult
than its transport along the bedding planes. However, the migration of water across bedding planes
is unblocked. The wettability of the Yanchang samples used here is more water-wet, which is

9.4.3.1 TOC and Mineralogy
Table 9.11 shows the composition of four shale samples from the Ziliujing formation. The TOC
content ranges from 0.97 to 1.72 wt.% with an average value of 1.41 wt.%.
As to the mineralogy of our shale samples, one main characteristic is the high clay content (from
41.3 to 54.0 wt.% with an average value of 46.4 wt.%). The clay minerals of those shale samples
mainly consist of mixed-layer (illite/smectite), illite and chlorite.
9.4.3.2 Pore Structure
The pore-throat size information obtained from MIP is presented in Figure 9.10. All four samples
show bimodal distributions with two peaks around 10 nm and 1 μm. Sample Z1 has the lowest
porosity and smallest median pore diameter (D50), while Sample Z4 has the highest porosity
and the largest D50 (Table 9.12); D50 is the pore-throat diameter corresponding to 50% of total cumu￾lative mercury intrusion. Low specific surface area of Sample Z1 is probably because of the higher
contribution (>40%) of large pores (>100 nm) to the total pore space (Figure 9.10a).
Very few pores are developed in Sample Z1 (Figure 9.11), which is consistent with its lowest MIP
porosity. Due to the lowest TOC content of Sample Z1, OM pores are rarely observed, and inorganic
pores related to clay minerals are the main pore type. OM pores as well as OM-clay interparticle
pores are commonly observed in Samples Z2 and Z4, and inorganic pores are also well developed.
OM pores and OM-clay interparticle pores are the main pore types in Sample Z3, while inorganic
pores are poorly developed.

9.4 Results and Discussion 1999.4.3.3 Water and Oil Imbibition Experiments
The water imbibition slopes are listed in Table 9.13. All the water imbibition slopes are much less
than the theoretical value of 0.5, indicating the low water-wet pore connectivity of these Ziliujing
Shale samples. The relationship between the 1st water imbibition slope and MIP porosity was also
investigated for T samples. Except for Sample Z3Ta with the lowest imbibition slope of 0.05, the first
water imbibition slopes are positively correlated with the MIP porosity (Figure 9.12).

200 9 Assessment of Shale Wettability from Spontaneous Imbibition Experiments9.4.3.4 Wettability of Ziliujing Formation Shale Indicated from SI Experiments and its
Correlation to Shale Pore Structure and Composition
The water and n-decane imbibition slopes of P samples are much higher than those of T samples.
The very low imbibition slopes of T samples indicate that it is difficult to form a connected pathway
for both oil and water across the bedding planes, which is closely related with the less developed
pore spaces (1A and 1B of Figure 9.11). Consequently, the bedding planes work as barriers to limit
the migration of both oil and water within Sample Z1. The wettability of the sample is determined
as slightly more oil-wet because of its higher n-decane imbibition slopes compared with water imbi￾bition slopes for both P and T samples.
For both P and T samples of Sample Z2, the n-decane imbibition slopes are much higher than
water imbibition slopes, which shows a more oil-wet property. Another SI characteristic of Sample
Z2 is the greater water and n-decane imbibition slopes of T samples compared with P samples,
which means that the effect of bedding planes on the fluid migration for this sample is insignificant.
Water and n-decane could transport across the bedding planes more freely due to the better￾connected water-wet and oil-wet pathways in this direction. As shown in Figure 9.11 (2A and
2B), the dominant OM-related pores and widely distributed microfractures are the two main pore
types, which form the better oil-wet and good water-wet pathways, respectively.
The water and n-decane imbibition curves of Sample Z3 are quite different. Water could move
along the bedding planes but could not penetrate the bedding planes easily, which is caused by
the less developed water-wet inorganic pores in Sample Z3 (Figure 9.11). However, the migration
of n-decane within Sample Z3 is less affected by the blockage effect of bedding planes. The abundant
OM pores and OM-clay interparticle pores could build a good oil-wet pore network.
The more water-wet wettability of Sample Z4 is determined by the higher water imbibition slope
of Sample Z4Ta compared with the n-decane imbibition slope of Sample Z4Tb. Unlike Sample Z3,
the bedding planes block the migration of n-decane but not water for Sample Z4. The better￾connected water-wet pathway benefits from the protection of the high quartz content of Sample Z4.
The n-decane imbibition slope of Sample Z4Ta is much higher than that of Sample Z1Tb, which is
closely related to the well-developed oil-wet OM pores and OM-clay interparticle pores within
Sample Z4 (Figure 9.11).
9.4.4 Shale Wettability Evolution Model
The co-existence of oil-wet OM pores and water-wet inorganic pores at nm-μm scales in shale
complicates its wettability at mm-cm scales. The pore structure controls shale wettability.
Simplified pore network model is established for more oil-wet, more water-wet, mixed-wet, and
intermediate-wet shale samples, respectively (Figure 9.13) (Gao et al. 2019). For more oil-wet
(or more water-wet) shale samples, the oil-wet (or water-wet) pores are more developed and better
connected to form an oil-wet (or water-wet) pathway. Both oil and water-wet pores are
well-connected in mixed-wet shale samples, while neither oil-wet pores nor water-wet pores are
well-connected in the intermediate-wet shale samples.
Thermal maturity significantly controls shale pore structure (Mastalerz et al. 2013) and thus
affects shale wettability. The wettability of different shale samples inferred from SI experiments
and thermal maturities are listed in Table 9.14. A new shale wettability evolution model is shown
in Figure 9.14 (Gao et al. 2019) with four stages:
Stage I with thermal maturity 0.5% < Ro < 1.3%: Organic pores begin to form due to the primary
cracking of OM but are not well developed. The primary inorganic pores are eliminated by

Stage II with thermal maturity 1.3% < Ro < 2.0%: The inorganic pores are reduced more due to the
enhanced compaction, while many organic pores are generated by secondary cracking of OM.
However, the development level of inorganic pores and organic pores is complicated, and shale
samples exhibit variable wettabilities (Figure 9.14).
Stage III with thermal maturity 2.0% < Ro < 3.0%: Organic pores are much more developed by sec￾ondary cracking of OM and become the dominant pore type, while inorganic pores are reduced
significantly due to the strong compaction, which leads to the more oil-wet wettability.
Stage IV with thermal maturity Ro > 3.0%: Organic pores are decreased due to the weakened sec￾ondary cracking of OM and the strong compaction, which causes the intermediate-wet

9.4 Results and Discussion 2039.5 Conclusions
The SI experiments were used to determine the overall shale wettability of different formations
from China and United States, which showed the wide applicability of SI experiments in shale wett￾ability evaluation. The effect of pore structure on shale wettability was also investigated in this
study. The co-existence of oil-wet and water-wet pore networks in shale samples was confirmed,
which led to the mixed wettability of shale samples. The dominant oil-wet (or water-wet) pore net￾work determined the more oil-wet shale wettability. In order to show the close relationship
between shale wettability and pore structure, four simplified pore network models with different
wettability were proposed. Also, a new shale wettability evolution model was proposed to show the
wettability change corresponding to the pore structure alteration during thermal maturation proc￾ess. It should be noted that further studies are needed to verify and improve the proposed shale
wettability evolution model.
In summary, SI experiment is a useful way to determine shale wettability, which also reveals the
close relationship between shale wettability and pore connectivity. However, SI experiments are
mainly used to qualitatively characterize shale wettability. A more representative and reliable
quantitative wettability index is still not established and requires further study; recently Wang
et al. (2021) established a wettability classification scheme by considering both contact angle meas￾urement and SI experiments. Finally, the in-situ conditions of shale wettability should be evaluated
by SI experiments in the future.

10.1 Introduction
The role of ultra-low permeability of shales in staunching fluid flow has confounded attempts to
recover hydrocarbons but been a boon to their use for the sequestration of energy wastes. Recent
advances in reservoir completions have improved the economics of shale applications – the most
important two being horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing. These two techni￾ques are used in tandem to reduce drainage path lengths from the shale matrix to the high per￾meability pathways created by the stimulation treatment. The large initial production rates
achieved for new wells result from rapid drainage to the newly created fracture surface area.
The rate-limiting step for long-term production remains the low matrix permeability – apparent
only after well production extends significantly beyond the initial production peak. Similarly,
injection rates into depleted shale reservoirs for enhanced gas production or for carbon seques￾tration must remain low in order to control pressure buildup. This chapter highlights key factors
that control permeability evolution in shale and methods that can be used to promote permea￾bility enhancement through desorption.
10.1.1 Shale Mineralogical Characteristics
Shale is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of clays, silicates, carbonates, and organic matter
(Sone and Zoback 2013). Within the matrix, individual mineral components form thin laminae
separated by fracture planes which allow for greater fluid flow parallel to bedding (Crook et al.
2002; Bandyopadhyay 2009; Bonnelye et al. 2017) than perpendicular to it. These bedding features
are observed to cause brittle failure planes when coring (Lyu et al. 2015; Heng et al. 2020). Porosity
is concentrated between laminae as micro-fissures that create a set of preferential flow paths
throughout the shale (Keller et al. 2011; Yan et al. 2015). Imaging of kerogen in shales shows a
spongelike network of nanopores that create high surface area for sorptive storage (Kang et al.
2011). This arrangement leads to nanoscale diffusion out of the kerogen into micro-fissures and
bedding-parallel fractures during fluid flow (Wu et al. 2016; Fan and Ettehadtavakkol 2017; Liu
et al. 2019b).

kerogen are generally the predominant mineral components, with carbonates, quartz, feldspar,
and pyrite comprising the remainder. Hydrocarbons are predominantly stored within the clays
and organic matter. Organic matter is strongly sorptive, while clays are weakly sorptive (Ross
and Bustin 2009). The other mineralogical components of shale are non-sorptive. The disparate
mineralogy and mineral distribution in shales allow for the creation of porosity via shrinkage of
sorptive components (Wang et al. 2012). Desorptive shrinkage relaxes the solid matrix locally sur￾rounding flow paths that were originally constricted due to adsorptive swelling of clays and organic
matter. This desorption occurs naturally in shales during pressure depletion, which causes an
increase in permeability that competes with permeability reduction due to increased effective stress
(Jia et al. 2018). While flow paths are concentrated in the clays and kerogen, shales with higher
silicate or carbonate contents are also stiffer, such that they lose less permeability with increasing
net effective stress than softer shales (Schwartz et al. 2019a). Understanding controls on permea￾bility evolution due to changes in pore pressure, net effective stress, and adsorption capacity is an
area of active research.
10.1.2 Flow Network
Shale is typified by strongly anisotropic transport
and mechanical properties (Sone and Zoback
2013; Schwartz et al. 2019b). Permeability in shale
can be 10–100 times lower in the bedding￾perpendicular direction than in the bedding￾parallel direction (Bolton et al. 2000; Kwon et al.
2004; Pan et al. 2015). This permeability anisot￾ropy is due to the concentration of porosity
between clay-mineral laminae parallel to bedding
(Ulm and Abousleiman 2006; Horne 2013). Flow
paths parallel to bedding are characterized as
macropores and long micro-fractures that create
a preferential flow network through the shale
(Marschall et al. 2005; Keller et al. 2011; Daigle
et al. 2017). Figure 10.2 shows a schematic of
bedding-parallel ellipsoidal macropores, which

210 10 Permeability Enhancement in Shale Induced by Desorptionare concentrated between laminae in the bedding-parallel direction. Inside each lamina, fluid
transport originates in nanopores and is driven by diffusion (Javadpour et al. 2007). Both parallel￾and perpendicular-to-bedding, storage, and flow occur predominantly in the kerogen and clay com￾ponents (Sondergeld et al. 2010; Curtis et al. 2012).
10.1.2.1 Bedding-Parallel Flow Network
While it remains challenging to image nanopores, the pore volume of the preferential flow network
is sufficiently large that it is readily imaged using numerous techniques (Gu and Mildner 2016;
Curtis et al. 2019; Goral et al. 2019). In all cases, imaging techniques reveal planar micro-fractures
and macropores separating laminae. Figures 10.3–10.5 give characteristic examples of the bedding￾parallel flow network from the literature. In all cases, flow paths can be characterized as long, flat
cracks oriented parallel to bedding and between laminae.
Flow paths comprised of an ensemble flow network of component fractures may be individually
represented by the cubic law to model permeability (Witherspoon et al. 1980; Bai and Elsworth

10.1 Introduction 2112000; Izadi et al. 2011). The cubic law may overestimate the permeability of single fractures due to
the neglect of variations in fracture roughness and tortuosity (Wang et al. 2015). Permeability evo￾lution in fractured, sorptive media is typically cast as an ensemble response to evolving strains (Liu
et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012; Schwartz et al. 2019c), and these strains are often competitive with
each other (Liu and Harpalani 2013). For example, thermally induced permeability evolution in
coals is modeled as an ensemble response to thermal and sorptive strains and dependent on applied
boundary conditions (Qu et al. 2012).
10.1.2.2 Bedding-Perpendicular Flow Paths
Flow paths in the bedding-perpendicular direction are typified as tortuous nanotubes connected
along grain boundaries. Figure 10.6 shows several such pathways in a small section of a shale sam￾ple from Chen et al. (2015). These openings can be so small that Darcian flow (driven by pressure
gradient) is no longer an appropriate representation (Javadpour 2009; Civan et al. 2012). This hap￾pens because of gas slippage at the walls of nano-sized fractures or pores – in contrast to no-slip
boundary conditions for liquid flow as presumed in the cubic or Pouseuille law quantifying Darcian
flow. Conversely, in the case of flow along grain boundaries in the bedding-perpendicular direction,
the diameter of openings approaches the mean free path of gas molecules such that Darcian flow
breaks down. The flow is no longer driven by pressure gradients but by concentration gradients.
This requires flow models based on diffusion and Fick’s law to properly predict fluid transport
(Izadi et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2015).
Because gas flow in shale originates in nanopores and within laminae along clay platelet bound￾aries, gas permeability models must account for the Knudsen diffusion-driven flow that occurs in
these spaces (Cao et al. 2017). As the gas approaches the bedding-parallel flow paths, fluid transport
begins to transition to the Darcian flow regime. Figure 10.7 shows part of the preferential flow net￾work in a shale, which comprises a series of nanotubes connected to larger macropores. Such sys￾tems require dual permeability models that can couple Fickian and Darcian flow when considering
field-scale response (Li and Elsworth 2015). Figure 10.8 shows the multiple scales that may need to
be considered in field applications – in particular, moving from nanopores within organic storage,
nested within the matrix, and draining to adjacent hydraulic fractures. In the laboratory, however,

10.1 Introduction 213shale gas permeability is generally measured individually in either bedding-parallel or
-perpendicular directions using pressure pulse tests (Brace et al. 1968). As a result, measurements
taken in the bedding-parallel direction are measuring the permeability of the system of planar
micro-fractures and macropores that make up the preferential flow network.
10.2 Adsorption in Shales
Shales experience adsorption in the presence of sorptive gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.
Adsorption in the organic matter causes shales to internally swell, constricting flow paths and redu￾cing permeability (Izadi et al. 2011). Concurrently, increasing the pore pressure of any gas causes
poromechanical expansion, leading permeability to increase (Wang et al. 2012). Bulk expansion
due to sorptive swelling is additive to poromechanical expansion, whereas permeability evolution
is competitive due to these strains (Harpalani and Chen 1997; Cui and Bustin 2005; Robertson and
Christiansen 2007; Mazumder and Wolf 2008; Siriwardane et al. 2009). Figure 10.9 shows the range
of permeability responses to sorptive gas at increasing pore pressures.
Sorptive swelling occurs along the surface of the adsorbent. In the presence of any appreciable
amount of gas, swelling is essentially isotropic (Robertson and Christiansen 2006). However,
because shale is a mechanically transversely isotropic material each of the three principal
components of the sorptive strain primarily impacts only one of the two (or three) directional
permeabilities – the permeability effect is directionally decoupled. Conversely, the orthogonal
impact of each component of the sorptive strain is
captured through the Poisson effect – and directionally
coupled. As such, three-dimensional models of perme￾ability evolution in shale can be reduced to two dimen￾sions without loss of model fidelity (Schwartz
et al. 2019c).
10.2.1 Langmuir Theory
Sorptive strain has been shown to follow a Langmuir
curve that is proportional to the fractional coverage
(Robertson 2005). Fractional coverage of adsorption
sites ranges from 0 to 100% and can be cast as
θ = P
P + PL
10 1
or
θ = bP
1 + bP
10 2
where P is the pressure, PL is the Langmuir pressure,
and b is the affinity constant. PL corresponds to 50%
fractional coverage and is readily estimated from labo￾ratory data. Inspection of Eq. (10.1) and Eq. (10.2) also
shows that b is equal to 1/PL. It is also equal to
b = b ∞ e

data and is equal to
b ∞ = α

where α is a sticking (attachment) coefficient, kd∞ is the rate constant for desorption at infinite
temperature, and M is the molecular weight of the gas. For a given gas and solid, the only variable
in Eq. (10.4) is T (Do 1998), such that b∞ varies with T −1/2 linearly as:
b ∞ = b ∞ 0

10 5
where b∞0 is the affinity constant at the reference temperature T0. Sorptive strain is linear with
fractional coverage (Robertson 2005). With the maximum strain occurring at 100% coverage, sorp￾tive strain is defined as:
εs = εL
bP
1 + bP
10 6
where εL is the Langmuir strain at 100% coverage of sorption sites. The Langmuir strain corre￾sponds to the maximum possible sorptive strain for a given gas and solid and is typically estimated
by curve fitting. Figure 10.10b shows standard isotherms for sorptive strain. For a given εL the sorp￾tive strain can be cast as a function of varying pressure and temperature:
εs = εL
b ∞ eQ RTP
1 + b ∞ eQ RTP
10 7
While Figure 10.10a shows the variation of sorptive strain isotherms with pressure, Figure 10.10b
shows sorptive strain along isobars with varying temperatures. Both figures show that desorption
occurs with decreasing pressure (or partial pressure) and increasing temperature.
10.2.2 Competing Strains in Permeability Evolution
There are several strains that arise during desorptive processes. Of particular note are mechanical
strains that occur with changing pore pressures and thermal strains that develop as a result of chan￾ging temperatures. These strains are competitive with sorptive strain, and all three strains must be
accounted for in permeability models (Liu et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012).
10.2.2.1 Poro-Sorptive Strain
Figure 10.11 illustrates that fissure-like elliptical-section pores in shale are concentrated between
bedding planes and can be characterized using pore spacing s, pore aperture b, and pore length a.
Figure 10.11a shows an idealized pore surrounded by matrix rock including organic matter (OM).
With increasing pore pressure, the pore expands due to the traction along the pore boundary
(Figure 10.11b). Increasing pore size also causes bulk expansion of the shale. If the gas species
is sorptive, then an additional deformation occurs as the surrounding organic matter swells
(Figure 10.11c). Because the deformation originates outside of pores, it creates a separate bulk
expansion that concurrently constricts flow paths by causing pore closure. Combining these
mechanisms, increasing pore pressure with a sorptive species causes pore diameter to increase
due to poromechanical expansion and to simultaneously decrease due to sorptive swelling
10.2 Adsorption in Shales 215(Fig. 10.11d). If the injection pressure of a sorptive gas is higher than the equilibrium pore pressure,
poromechanical expansion of the pore space competes with the permeability reduction caused by
sorptive swelling (Liu et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2016). At any given pore pressure, the bulk expansion
from a sorptive gas is larger than that from a non-sorptive gas because the sorptive swelling
causes an additional deformation. The permeability response results from the net change in the
pore aperture.
This ensemble response to sorptive gases can be further illustrated in Figure 10.12. In
Figure 10.12a, strain is plotted against increasing pore pressure with expansion shown as positive
strain. The sorptive strain follows a Langmuir-type curve that grows rapidly at low pore pressures
and slows as it approaches a maximum strain at higher pore pressures. After 100% of the available
adsorption sites are filled, there is no further sorptive strain. Instead, additional pore pressure only

216 10 Permeability Enhancement in Shale Induced by Desorptioncauses additional pore expansion (Wang et al. 2012). The total strain curve would be the sum of the
sorptive strain and the poromechanical strain. Figure 10.12b illustrates that the net pore response
would be positive or negative depending on whether sorptive pore closure is larger than mechanical
pore expansion. At lower pore pressures, the pore closure caused by sorptive swelling is larger than
the pore expansion caused by increased pore pressure. At larger pore pressures, incremental por￾omechanical expansion outpaces incremental sorptive swelling, and the net pore response is expan￾sion. Figure 10.12c translates the net pore response to the net permeability response. At low pore
pressures, permeability decreases due to the dominant effect of sorptive swelling. As the rate of
permeability reduction decreases due to Langmuir swelling, the rate of permeability enhancement
increases due to poromechanical expansion. At higher pressures, permeability can increase beyond

10.2 Adsorption in Shales 217the initial permeability as poromechanical expansion becomes the dominant effect. Therefore,
there is a point at which poromechanical expansion can outpace Langmuir swelling and permea￾bility reduction reaches an inflection point to become permeability enhancement.
10.2.2.2 Thermal-Sorptive Strain
Increasing the temperature of any rock creates thermal strains on the order of ~10−5
/K, which is
measured as volumetric expansion (Robertson 1988). Shales experience traditional (inert and non￾reactive) thermal expansion in the range 300–400 K typical of reservoirs (Gilliam and Morgan
1987), but at ~470 K, they begin to collapse as kerogen undergoes pyrolysis and illitic clays expe￾rience a reduction in spacing between platelets. Thermal expansion of shales comprising multi￾mineralic aggregates is lower than that of its individual mineral components (Robertson 1988)
as pores and cracks reduce skeletal stiffness and reduce aggregate thermal expansion coefficient
to be less than that of the weighted average of its mineral composition (Cooper and Simmons
1977). This difference is due to mineral expansion being distributed partly to bulk volume expan￾sion and partly to pore closure, indicating that thermal strains potentially reduce permeability. The
magnitude of permeability loss depends on the percentage of mineral expansion that contributes to
pore volume reduction. Thermal strain significantly reduces permeability for constant volume
reservoirs (Qu et al. 2010) – one end member behavior for the spectrum of boundary conditions.
However, increasing temperature also causes desorption in sorptive rocks that can both lead to per￾meability enhancement (Sakurovs et al. 2008; Li et al. 2009) or permeability loss (Sinha et al. 2013)
depending on the comparative influence of the competitive thermal and sorptive strains.
The Langmuir model predicts that desorption also occurs with increasing temperature at con￾stant pore pressure. This leads to counterintuitive mechanical behavior in sorptive rocks with
increasing temperature. Rock stiffness in shales tends to decrease upon heating and increase upon
cooling (Closmann and Bradley 1979; Zhu and Arson 2014). Indeed, laboratory tests on European
black shales showed that rock stiffness decreases with increasing temperature in single-stage uni￾axial compression tests (Rybacki et al. 2016). Increasing temperature also leads to a softening of
coals, indicated by a decrease in bulk modulus (Khan and Jenkins 1984). Pore closure causes
the dynamic bulk modulus to increase as the shale becomes stiffer due to decreased porosity
(Schwartz et al. 2019b). The net result is that thermally induced desorption can lead to permeability
enhancement if the change in sorptive strain is larger than the change in thermal strain.
10.3 Permeability Models for Sorptive Media
Shale and coal are both fractured, sorptive media and their responses to sorptive gases are similar
(Kumar et al. 2016). Many permeability models have been developed to capture the effect of sorp￾tion in coals (Seidle et al. 1992; Palmer and Mansoori 1996; Cui and Bustin 2005; Shi and Durucan
2005; Palmer 2009), and permeability evolution in fractured, sorptive media is typically cast in
terms of evolving strains (Liu et al. 2011). These strains occur due to organic material swelling
within the matrix and sorption within flow channels (Li et al. 2017a). In flow channels composed
of sorptive minerals, the layer of adsorbed gas against the flow channel wall directly reduces the
flow channel aperture (Sakhaee-Pour and Bryant 2012). Conversely, the shrinkage of organic mat￾ter during desorption increases pore aperture (Levine 1996; Liu and Rutqvist 2010). The magnitude
of permeability reduction caused by sorptive swelling represents the potential permeability
enhancement in the event of desorption. In coals, methane desorption has been shown to increase
permeability two- to fivefold (Harpalani and Schraufnagel 1990). This has been directly observed in
218 10 Permeability Enhancement in Shale Induced by Desorptionsitu, where permeability increased during depletion as organic shrinkage expanded fractures,
which had a larger effect than the additional compression caused by the overburden stress
(Mavor and Vaughn 1998).
10.3.1 Strain Based Models
Permeability evolution – either permeability loss or permeability enhancement – is due to a change
in the conductivity of the flow network. These changes are often cast as evolving strains that can
originate internal or external to the shale volume and result in a change in the pore structure. Con￾sidering all three strains that can typically arise in a shale reservoir – alternately resulting from
changes in pore pressure, temperature, or fractional coverage of adsorption sites – changes to
the pore structure arise from the net impact of these three strains as:
Δb = λs Δεp + Δεs + Δεth 10 8
where b is the aperture of a macropore or micro-fissure, s is the spacing between pores, and λ is a
boundary condition ranging from 0 for free volume expansion to 1 for fixed bulk volume (no bound￾ary expansion). The three strains – poromechanical, sorptive, and thermal – are shown as positive
values; however, the sorptive strain would be of the opposite sense to, and sign of, both the por￾omechanical and thermal strains. Using the cubic law, the sorptive component of permeability evo￾lution can be isolated as:
k

where we note that the change in permeability from some reference permeability k0 is dependent on
the reference sorptive strain εs0 that exists at k0. It can be readily shown that the sorptive component
of permeability evolution increases when (i) temperature increases or (ii) pressure decreases. This is
also apparent from an inspection of Langmuir isotherms: decreasing pressure or increasing tem￾perature leads to desorption, which dilates flow paths previously constricted by nearby adsorptive
swelling. Therefore, the total permeability evolution in terms of evolving thermal, poromechanical,
and sorptive strains is:

10.3 Permeability Models for Sorptive Media 219where αth is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the shale and K is the bulk modulus. While
Eq. (10.12) can become unwieldy to use, the key insight is that the initial sorptive strain is depend￾ent on the initial pore pressure and initial temperature. Also, if pressure or temperature is constant,
the equation reduces to a simpler form.
10.4 Competing Processes during Permeability Evolution
From the foregoing, it is clear that competing impacts of changes in pressure, effective stress, tem￾perature, and sorption are manifest, in a complex manner, on strains. Here, we resolve the impact of
competing strains on the evolution of permeability observed within an isothermal experiment.
Then, we isolate the sorption component of permeability evolution to understand the permeability
loss associated with adsorption, whether thermally induced or pore pressure induced.
10.4.1 Resolving Competing Strains
We measured the bulk strain of the shale core when injected with either methane or helium gas. We
plotted strain versus pore pressure for both helium and methane in Figure 10.13. The resolution of
the LVDT is 0.1 μm with a smaller displacement rounded to the nearest 0.1 μm. Because the lengths
of our samples are on the order of millimeters, a strain of 10−4 is the minimum resolvable incre￾ment. Strains less than 0.1 μm are automatically bit-limited by the LVDT. We included boundaries
in Figure 10.13 to show the possible range of strains that could be obscured by the limits of reso￾lution of the LVDT. In the case of methane injection, the measured strain is the sum of the por￾omechanical expansion and the sorptive swelling:
εtot = εp + εs 10 13
such that
εs = εtot − εp 10 14
where
εs = εL
P
P + PL
10 15
The strain caused by methane injection includes both εp and εs, meaning it represents εtot with
increasing pore pressure. The helium strain curve represents poromechanical expansion only and is
equal to εp. In order to find εs, we subtracted the helium-induced strain from the methane-induced
strain at each pressure and fit the resulting data to a Langmuir-type strain curve according to
Eq. (10.4). From the plot below, the sorptive strain at 6 MPa is 1.15 × 10−4

to calculate PL and εL.
The Langmuir strain is isolated using Eqs. (10.14) and (10.15). The strain data in Figure 10.13
were used as input into Eq. (10.14) and a Langmuir strain curve was fit to the result using
Eq. (10.15). Results for the isolated sorptive strain are plotted in Figure 10.14. At low pressures,
the lower-than-expected measurements of strain for methane suggest that the core may not have
been fully saturated, although the strain data are within the margin of error for the LVDT. In
Eq. (10.15), a Langmuir pressure PL of 7 MPa and a Langmuir strain εL of 2.75 × 10−4 provided
an excellent fit to Eq. (10.14).

222 10 Permeability Enhancement in Shale Induced by DesorptionWe plotted the permeability data measured via helium and methane against the pore pressure in
Figure 10.15. The data were then used as input into Eq. (10.23) to show the signature of the sorption
component of permeability evolution. We input the sorption data from Eq. (10.15) into Eq. (10.19)
and found the line of best fit for the data from Eq. (10.23) by using s/b0 equal to 1500 and b/a equal
to 7 × 10−3
(where b/a is further constrained by published values for aspect ratios in shale). In
Figure 10.15, the red curve represents the permeability reduction due to the sorption predicted
from Eq. (10.19) and the orange-filled circles are from Eq. (10.23). We found an excellent fit and
good agreement between these two independent methods of solving for sorptive strain and sorptive
permeability evolution.
10.5 Desorption Processes Yielding Permeability Enhancement
There are four methods by which native hydrocarbons can be desorbed from organic matter and
clays in shale matrix: (i) lowering the pore pressure through depletion, (ii) lowering the partial pres￾sure of methane by injecting a non-sorptive or sorptive gas, (iii) injecting a sorptive gas with higher
adsorption affinity, or (iv) increasing the temperature of the shale. The first two are examples of
desorption caused by changing pressure (ΔP), the third causes desorption by changing gas compo￾sition (ΔC), and the fourth by changing temperature (ΔT). We discuss each of these in turn.
10.5.1 Pressure Depletion
During fluid production, the pore pressure of the reservoir reduces, and methane desorbs to remain
in equilibrium with the solid surface. This process has been shown to follow a Langmuir adsorption
model, where fractional coverage can vary between 0 and 100% based on the gas pressure according
to Eq. (10.1).As a reservoir undergoes pressure depletion, Eq. (10.1) shows that fractional coverage
decreases. This is due to the drop in energy associated with the decrease in the pressure of the gas

measurements were made sequentially with helium and then methane. The isolated sorptive permeability
from Eq. (10.23) is in orange. The red regression curve is from Eq. (10.19).
10.5 Desorption Processes Yielding Permeability Enhancement 223(Do 1998). It has been noted in shale and coal reservoirs that permeability can increase almost
20-fold during production (Harpalani and Chen 1997), which is counterintuitive as the effective
stress is typically increasing. In these instances, the permeability gained via desorption is evidently
greater than the permeability lost from increasing effective stress (Li et al. 2017b).
10.5.2 Lowering Partial Pressure
When a second gas species is injected into pore space originally occupied by adsorbed methane, a
binary mixture forms with a net pressure and two partial pressures of the individual species. In
simplest terms, the net pressure is the weighted average of the partial pressures and molar concen￾trations of each gas species:
Pn = X1n1 + X2n2 10 24
where X1 and X2 are the partial pressures of each gas species. Injecting a non-sorptive gas –
commonly chosen to be nitrogen in the field and helium or argon in the laboratory – has the benefit
of not interacting with the solid surface. In the case of non-sorptive gas injection, the only mech￾anism causing desorption is the lowering of the partial pressure of methane (Schwartz and Elsworth
2019). This can be achieved by increasing the pore pressure through gas injection or by injecting a
non-sorptive gas at constant pore pressure. As methane is produced downstream, the non-sorptive
gas maintains the pressure in the pore space. As nitrogen is abundant – air is composed of approx￾imately 78% N2 – and moderately inexpensive, it is the favored choice for field applications.
Figure 10.16 shows the permeability enhancement possible from lowering the partial pressure
of methane during a nitrogen flood. The partial pressure can also be lowered by injecting a sorptive
gas species, with the additional overprinted effect from the injected gas interacting with the solid
surface.

224 10 Permeability Enhancement in Shale Induced by Desorption10.5.3 Sorptive Gas Injection
Aside from changing the pore pressure, desorption can occur with changing the gas composition.
Each gas species of a mixture has its own adsorption affinity, and changing the mixture composition
results in changing adsorbed volumes for each species. The most common sorptive gas considered
for injection is carbon dioxide, as it is highly sorptive to shales and coals and is also a greenhouse
gas. Depending on the mineral composition of the shale, CO2 can have anywhere from 5 to 20 times
higher adsorption affinity to shale than CH4 (Liu et al. 2019b). Injecting CO2 into a pore where CH4
is present creates a binary mixture that lowers the partial pressure of the CH4 in the same way as
with non-sorptive gas injection. However, because CO2 has a much higher affinity to adsorption
than CH4, sorption sites begin to fill with CO2 instead of CH4 as the system moves toward a
new equilibrium. Therefore, CH4 desorbs and is replaced by CO2 on the sorptive surface. This cre￾ates an opportunity for the now gaseous CH4 to be produced from the pore space and to traverse
through the larger flow network within the shale matrix (Luo et al. 2015; Du et al. 2019).
As CO2 has a higher sorption affinity, it creates an additional sorptive strain over the strain
caused by CH4. Practically, this additional swelling is observed as an additional permeability loss
associated with CO2. Whether or not the permeability loss associated with CO2 injection is com￾pensated by the extra CH4 production is an area of active research. Some have proposed injecting
a mixture of CO2–N2, where optimized production can be achieved at some ratio of CO2 to N2 (Li
and Elsworth 2019; Fan et al. 2019).
10.5.4 Desorption with Increased Temperature
The Langmuir equation shows that equilibrium sorption changes with changing pressure or tem￾perature. Figure 10.10b shows that whereas desorption occurs during pressure decrease, it also
occurs during temperature increase. As the gas gains kinetic energy with increased temperature,
it has additional energy to escape from the sorptive surface. While reservoirs are typically consid￾ered as isothermal during production, temperature can be increased in the lab and potentially in the
field. The permeability response to heat is dependent on the magnitude of desorptive shrinkage
compared to the thermal expansion of minerals. Thermal expansion in shale is linear within the
range of temperatures typically experienced in reservoirs: 300–400 K (Robertson 1988). However,
thermally induced desorption is not linear but based on fractional coverage. The competition
between desorption and mineral expansion creates an inverted U-shaped permeability response
with increasing temperature. Laboratory observations suggest that some shales may experience
substantial permeability increase in fracture sets and matrix rock, if subjected to temperatures
of 300–350 K (Schwartz and Elsworth 2021).
10.6 Permeability Enhancement Due to Nitrogen Flooding
Nitrogen is an inexpensive and ubiquitously available gas often used in enhanced oil and gas recov￾ery. As a non-sorptive gas, nitrogen enhances permeability by inducing desorption of methane in
clays and organic matter. As nitrogen infiltrates the sorptive pore space, the partial pressure of
methane is reduced. The equilibrium between adsorbed and free gas is shifted toward the gaseous
phase, and methane can be produced from the pore space together with nitrogen. As desorption
occurs, organic matter loses volume and flow paths dilate. The magnitude of permeability enhance￾ment depends on the sorptive affinity of the solids and the density of pores affected. For a shale with
10.6 Permeability Enhancement Due to Nitrogen Flooding 225high pore density, permeability enhancement would be small compared to a shale with low pore
density. Therefore, a general conjecture is that shales with lower initial permeability should expe￾rience greater permeability enhancement under the same sorptive conditions, although this
remains to be verified. In laboratory measurements of permeability enhancement for samples of
Marcellus shale, injecting nitrogen gas at near-constant pore pressure caused matrix permeability
to more than double in both the bedding-parallel and bedding-perpendicular directions (Schwartz
and Elsworth 2019). Figure 10.17 shows permeability enhancement during nitrogen flooding for
two shale samples in the bedding parallel direction and one sample in the bedding perpendicular
direction. In all cases, permeability more than doubled over the course of two days.
10.7 Discussion
Of the four methods discussed in Section 5 that induce desorption, pressure depletion is the only
one that occurs naturally during production operations. The relationship between desorption￾induced permeability enhancement and concurrent stress-induced permeability reduction during
depletion remains an area of active research. As pore density, pore geometry, mineral distribution,
and sorptive capacity differ between shales, the stress-permeability relationship would also vary
(Zheng et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2019a). Of the other methods discussed, thermal flooding has
recently been demonstrated in the laboratory (Schwartz and Elsworth 2021 but has not yet been
adopted by the industry. Several challenges exist with thermal flooding in shales – in particular,
the energy input required to saturate a shale reservoir would be extensive. While steam flooding
has been successful in heavy oils as a mechanism to reduce fluid viscosity, the low permeability
of shales prohibitively reduces the effectiveness of such techniques.
The other two methods of desorption include lowering the partial pressure of the natural gas via
non-sorptive gas injection and preferential desorption of natural gas via CO2 injection. Since the
beginning of the current shale gas boom, CO2 injection has been proposed as a form of secondary

226 10 Permeability Enhancement in Shale Induced by Desorptionrecovery (Kim et al. 2017; Jin et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2020). CO2 preferentially adsorbs to organic
matter allowing methane to be produced via desorption, and this technique has garnered interest in
the oil and gas industry. The recent expansion of tax credits available for carbon sequestration
through Section 45Q offers additional incentives to operators to attempt CO2 flooding in US gas
shales. However, several challenges exist that must be overcome before CO2 flooding for enhanced
gas recovery (EGR) achieves widescale adoption. The main challenge associated with EGR in gas
shales is that each horizontal well is hydraulically isolated. Since well pads tend to have three to
four laterals in each direction (for a total of six to eight laterals per well pad), some have suggested
refracturing the middle laterals to conduct a horizontal sweep from the leftmost lateral to the right￾most. This would impact an equivalent volume of two wells for three laterals or three wells for four
laterals (Eshkalak et al. 2014). Alternatively, the huff-n-puff method of soaking a hydraulically iso￾lated well and allowing a mixture of reservoir fluids and injectate to be produced could be a more
effective design. The main drawbacks of the huff-n-puff method are that soaking times can be long
and that CO2 is produced and mixed with hydrocarbons. Additionally, CO2 can reduce the perme￾ability of the shale matrix by several orders of magnitude due to swelling. It has been proposed that
mixing N2 with CO2 might allow for successful EGR with permeability loss correspondingly limited
or removed.
The permeability response of shales to CO2-N2 mixtures is an area of active research. CO2 has a
higher affinity to adsorb within the organic pore space of coals and shales, leading to more storage,
larger sorptive strains, and greater permeability loss (Chareonsuppanimit et al. 2012; Li and
Elsworth 2015). Comparatively, N2 flooding has been shown to double the permeability of shales
(Schwartz and Elsworth 2019) and may compensate for the permeability loss due to CO2 adsorp￾tion. Injection of N2 reduces permeability loss via poromechanical expansion and by lowering the
partial pressure of methane. The Langmuir strain is independent of temperature for each gas
species but does change based on the sorption affinity of each species present (Robertson and
Christiansen 2007; Singh and Cai 2018). Whereas carbon dioxide has a stronger affinity to adsorb
than methane, nitrogen is a very weakly sorptive gas. Indeed, it can be treated as a non-sorptive gas
when compared to methane or CO2 adsorption in shales. This creates a complex response as the
CO2–N2 injectate mixes with native CH4. Whereas the adsorption of CO2 lowers permeability by
increasing methane desorption (Pan and Connell 2012; Liu et al. 2017), the permeability evolution
due to the strains induced as a function of changing CO2–N2–CH4 composition remains undefined.
We suggest further study comparing these three gases to determine which of these competing
mechanisms has a larger impact on ultimate recovery.
Another application related to CO2 injection in shales is permanent geologic carbon sequestra￾tion (GCS), with the shale acting as a caprock for saline aquifer injection or as a reservoir in the case
of depleted shale fields. Whereas hydrocarbon recovery during EGR is significantly impacted by the
loss of permeability associated with CO2 injection, permanent GCS does not require that hydrocar￾bons be produced as a result of the injection. In the case of saline aquifer injection, there are
typically no hydrocarbons present in the first place. Injecting CO2 into depleted shale reservoirs
has several advantages over saline aquifers, including adsorptive trapping and sorptive storage.
Whereas leakage and induced seismicity can be large risks in GCS projects (Pawar et al. 2015,
2016), shale reservoirs are supposed to be hydraulically isolated from the surrounding intervals.
Depleted shale fields may also have larger tolerance for pressure buildup, as they are already below
discovery pressure. In these ways, they may represent a reduced level of risk compared to saline
aquifer injection. Moreover, depleted shale fields have the benefit of production data from thou￾sands of wells, making the local subsurface well characterized. This may further reduce the uncer￾tainty when compared with fluid injection in greenfields.
10.7 Discussion 227Shales represent a unique class of subsurface reservoirs, both for hydrocarbon production and for
the sequestration of energy wastes. While much work has been done to understand these sorptive
media, there are several important challenges that future work should address. First, the transition
from Fickian flow through nanopores to Darcian flow within bedding-parallel micro-fissures – and
the roles of each during fluid storage or production – should be better understood. While micro￾fissures make up the predominant flow paths in the preferential pore network of shale, the majority
of storage occurs in the nanoporous, sorptive material between laminae (Sondergeld et al. 2010;
Curtis et al. 2012). The comparative influence of bedding-parallel and bedding-perpendicular per￾meability evolution during desorption should be better constrained. Second, some shales have been
reported to accommodate multilayer adsorption, leading to larger sorptive storage volumes (Yu
et al. 2014, 2016; Zhou et al. 2018). It should be determined if additional layers of adsorbed gas
would further impact permeability by creating an additional sorptive strain or by limiting the mean
free path in transport. Third, the engineering design for gas flooding in shales needs to be opti￾mized. It may be that the huff-n-puff method is the best available option for EGR. However, if that
is the case, then the future of EGR in shale may be limited. Gas injection across parallel laterals
reduces the reservoir volume stimulated by EGR but may have the benefit of higher sweep effi￾ciency. Hydraulically connecting parallel wells through refracturing could provide the injectivity
necessary for large-scale CO2 sequestration via EGR or GCS. Lastly, understanding the complex
response of shale to CO2–N2–CH4 mixtures will be critical to any efforts to convert depleted shale
fields into EGR or GCS assets. While CO2 could be injected alone, the beneficial permeability
enhancement when comingled with N2 is apparent. It has been shown that larger volumes of
CO2 can be sequestered in shale when mixed with 25% nitrogen than when CO2 is injected alone
(Li and Elsworth 2019). This is also critical for developing flue gas (or minimally separated flue gas)
injection methods for GCS, which could forego the significant costs associated with stripping CO2
out of flue gas using amine separation or some other method. Each of these challenges is directly
tied to permeability evolution in shale by desorption processes, and it promises to be an important
field in the decades to come.
10.8 Conclusion
Internal swelling is caused by the sorptive strain that develops during adsorption, which increases
with increasing pore pressure, decreasing temperature, or increasing concentration of a sorptive gas
species. Conversely, decreasing the pore pressure, increasing the temperature, or increasing the
concentration of a non-sorptive gas species will lead to desorption and a reduction of the sorptive
strain. The magnitude of permeability enhancement will depend on the distribution of sorptive
mineral components relative to flow paths, the geometry (aspect ratio) of the flow paths, and
the initial permeability.
Desorption processes in shale represent a critical pathway to permeability enhancement for oil
and gas development, carbon sequestration, and hydrogen storage. The volume of adsorbed gas is
controlled by the pressure, temperature, and composition of fluids in the pore space of a shale. Clays
make up a much larger mass fraction of shales compared to organic carbon but are only weakly
adsorptive compared to the total organic carbon. As flow paths such as macropores and micro￾fractures are concentrated near clays, and organic carbon such as kerogen, quantifying the perme￾ability evolution due to desorptive processes is paramount to understanding flow through porous,
sorptive media.

Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed
Stimulation Fluids and Tight Carbonate Source Rocks
Feng Liang, Hui-Hai Liu, and Jilin Zhang
Aramco Americas: Aramco Research Center—Houston, Houston, TX, USA
11.1 Introduction
Fractured carbonates contain 60% of the remaining oil and more than 40% of gas reserves
worldwide (Beydoun 1998). Acid fracturing and matrix acidizing are the most common ways to
stimulate conventional reservoirs due to the reactivity between carbonates and acids (McLeod
1984, 1989; Olsen and Karr 1986; Bybee 2004). However, acids are not as effective as in stimulating
carbonate-rich tight gas or shale formation due to their significantly low permeabilities
(ranging from nano to micro Darcies) as well as their heterogeneous pore structures (Nelson
2009; Sondergeld et al. 2010; Loucks et al. 2012). The combination of horizontal drilling and prop￾pant fracturing has been proved to be the most effective stimulation technique to produce natural
gas from tight carbonate reservoirs. Because the low permeability of rock matrix bottlenecks the
flow of hydrocarbon fluids, creating complex fractures in the rock matrix is highly desirable to
improve and maintain conductive flow paths for enhancing the production. Baihly et al. (2010)
observed that the gas production rate declines rapidly within the first few months of production
from horizontal wells in different shale gas basins (Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, Woodford
Shale, Haynesville Shale, and Eagle Ford Shale play). They also noted that the early production
rate is affected by the wellbore cleanup conditions since the gas is produced along with water
and the residual fracturing fluids. Wang (2017) conducted a comprehensive study on factors that
control the shale gas production and production-decline trend in fractured systems. These factors
include the petrophysical properties from the reservoir itself, such as existence of adsorption gas,
matrix permeability, rock mechanical properties (e.g. creep and viscoelastic behaviors), clay
content, organic content and its maturity, evolution of shale matrix apparent permeability, and
parameters related to the stimulation process such as simulated reservoir volume, the density,
conductivity, and connectivity of fracture networks. He concluded that regardless of the matrix
permeability, denser fracture networks and larger fracture-surface area inside the stimulated
reservoir volume always leads to higher production.
On the other hand, during hydraulic fracturing, massive amounts of fracturing fluids are pumped
to crack-open the formation, and only a small percentage of the fluids are recovered during the
flow-back process (Cheng 2012; King 2012; Soeder 2017). Despite extensive previous studies of
the interaction between carbonate rocks and fracturing fluid on the core-scale level (Akrad
et al. 2011; Lai et al. 2016), there have been very few microscopic studies documented, including

© 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2023 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.fluid flow pathways and mineralogical changes of the fluid and rock interaction. Given the com￾plexity of the tight organic-rich carbonate source rocks and their high heterogeneity, microscopic
studies on the texture, and the effects of the imbibed fluid on the mechanical, morphological, and
flow properties of tight organic-rich carbonate rocks are very important. Also, since various com￾ponents were exposed to the fracturing fluids under the reservoir conditions, it is important to
investigate whether different laminae are equally exposed to the fracturing fluids and whether frac￾turing fluid travels with any preference to certain laminae of the rock formation in situ. Will the
flow path have any preference when microfractures are present? If there is a preferred pathway,
how much difference is expected among the different flow pathways? What does the fluid do to
the formation? Will mechanical properties change after fluid exposure? Are the morphology and
mineralogy of the formation rock going to change? What changes will there be in terms of flow
property? It is critical to have some answers to the above questions and understand the dual
continuum flow phenomena in tight carbonate rocks in order to design more efficient simulation
techniques for hydraulic fracturing.
In this study, we have designed a few sets of experiments, which were conducted at multiscale
levels including the microscale and core scale to address the above questions. Two sets of tight
organic-rich carbonate rock samples were used. One sample set was a highly laminated lime mud￾stone from a basin in a Middle Eastern field that was used in microscopic studies, such as fluid
uptake pathways, morphological, mineralogic, and micromechanical aspects. The second sample
set was from an outcrop of the Eagle Ford Shale considered to be analogous to the set from the
Middle Eastern field in terms of mineralogy. The sample set was used in core-scale studies on
mechanical and flow properties including permeability and porosity. Correlations between the
observations from multiscale experiment results have been discussed to figure out the factors that
will affect the production rate and production-decline rate.
11.2 Fluid Uptake Pathways
The fluid uptake study was conducted by dynamically capturing the fluid pathway through a highly
laminated tight organic-rich carbonate thin-section sample from the Middle Eastern field using
X-ray radiographic images. The selected sample was composed of two distinguished zones, an
organic matter-rich zone (OMZ) and a calcite-rich zone (Cal-Z). Microfractures were presented
in both zones in the thin section prepared from the as-received sample. Potassium iodide
(KI, 5 wt% in DI water) was added to the treatment fluid to enhance the contrast of the images.
The spontaneous imbibition test was conducted for 100 minutes with one radiograph captured
at every 1-minute interval. The photomicrographs were analyzed and the fluid front movement
in both zones was captured (Liang et al. 2020).
11.2.1 Experimental Methods
11.2.1.1 Materials
11.2.1.1.1 Rock Sample A thin section of the rock sample with dimension of 22 × 11 × 3.3 mm
(length × width × thickness) was used in this study. The total organic carbon (TOC) of the selected
tight organic-rich carbonate rock sample was around 8.7 wt%. The mineral content, determined by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), showed that it was mainly composed of 94.5 wt% calcite, 0.5 wt% dolomite,
2.5 wt% quartz, 0.5 wt% pyrite, 0.6 wt% gypsum, and a minor amount of clay (0.6 wt% kaolinite
236 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluidsand 0.8 wt% illitic clay). The rock surface was further fine-trimmed by a target surfacing trimmer
and polished by a broad triple ion-beam mill.
11.2.1.2 Experimental Procedure
11.2.1.2.1 3D Microscale Visualization of Thin-Section Rock Sample in As-Received State A Nikon
HMXST225 Micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) system was used to image the tight
organic-rich carbonate rock sample at two different resolutions, 5.48 and 2.79 μm, respectively.
The X-ray used in the imaging process was 180 kV with a 2200 × 2200 pixel detector. 3000 projec￾tions were collected and reconstructed with 16-bit precision.
11.2.1.2.2 Dynamic Study of Spontaneous Imbibition Test Ghanbari and Dehghanpour (2015)
reported that liquid imbibition and ion diffusion rates parallel to the lamination are higher than
those in the perpendicular direction. Similarly, our imbibition study was conducted using a 5 wt%
KI solution along the maximum liquid imbibition rate direction, which is parallel to the lami￾nation direction. This is consistent with the fracturing fluid flow direction during hydraulic frac￾turing. The gravity effects on the fluid movement rate along the lamination direction were
minimized by placing the thin-section sample with lamination in the horizontal direction and
the treatment fluid (5 wt% KI solution) on the left side of the sample. In this way, the fluid
imbibition direction was in the horizontal direction. Then, the sample setup was transferred
to an X-ray chamber within 3 minutes and set up for radiographic imaging. The entire spontane￾ous imbibition test was conducted for 100 minutes with one X-ray radiographic image taken at
1-minute intervals. During the acquisition of the images, the sample remained stationary without
rotation. The fluid front of the collected radiographic images was identified by importing them
into an in-house MATLAB program to examine and measure the sudden change of attenuation
along the fluid imbibition direction. Then the distance of the fluid front was measured/calculated
between the sample edge and the fluid front.
11.2.2 Results and Discussion
11.2.2.1 Surface Characterization
Computed X-ray tomography (CT) of the prepared thin-section sample prior to the imbibition test
was performed using 5.48 and 2.79 μm resolution, respectively. The 3D image for each resolution
was reconstructed (Figure 11.1). It was observed that this area was composed of two distinguished
zones, an OMZ, shown as a dark-grey band in the middle of the image, and Cal-Z, shown as a light￾grey color present above and below the OMZ layer in Figure 11.1. The thickness of the OMZ layer in
this sample was approximately 1.2 millimeters (mm).
As documented in our earlier studies (Liang et al. 2018, 2019) with tight carbonate samples from
similar field, Cal-Z zones contain mainly calcite, while OMZs contain less calcite, more alumino￾silicate minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals, and more organic matter (OM) in
comparison to the Cal-Z zones. As shown in Figure 11.1a, at the resolution of 5.48 μm, multiple
microfractures were present in both the OMZs and Cal-Z zones on slices of the reconstructed image.
Microfractures are occasionally seen in Cal-Z zones, and they appear to be parallel to the lamina￾tion. The length of the microfractures can be up to a few millimeters. In Figure 11.1b at the higher
resolution of 2.79 μm, a higher density of microfractures was observed in the OMZs with orienta￾tions in different directions. Some of them were parallel to the lamination direction, while others
were perpendicular to or at high angles with the lamination. Some large irregular shaped micro￾fractures were also observed in the OMZ. It is very difficult to distinguish from images whether
11.2 Fluid Uptake Pathways 237these microfractures were naturally occurring, or induced by the sample preparation processes, or
from desiccation when the rock sample was exposed to air, though extra cautionary steps were con￾sidered/taken in order to minimize the damage during sample preparation. In fact, there is no guar￾antee that there was no induced damage to the prepared sample. Since large numbers of
microfractures are generated during the hydraulic fracturing process, especially with slickwater
treatment, this sample could be treated as the initial state of the formation sample in the far field
during hydraulic fracturing process for the fluid uptake pathway study.
The set of microCT images at the resolution of 2.79 μm was reconstructed and further processed.
In order to overcome the challenges with the large dataset size and the microstructure complexity,
supervised artificial intelligence (AI) was used during the micrograph analysis for fracture segmen￾tation (Howard et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2019). Some features and patterns, which might fail to be

similar data automatically. In this study, fractures and matrix from identified date sets were used in
the training data sets; then automation for recognizing fractures and matrix was conducted for the
rest of the data sets. The analyzed data suggested that there were connected microfracture networks
in the OMZ. Figure 11.2 shows the analyzed results for one area in the OMZ, in which green color
represents the connected fractures and porosity network while blue color represents the discon￾nected porosity.
11.2.2.2 Spontaneous Imbibition Tests
The imbibition study was conducted by placing the thin-section sample with layers in a horizontal
direction and flowing the treatment fluid from left to right. In this way, the fluid flow was along the
maximum fluid imbibition rate direction, i.e. the direction of sample lamination was parallel to the
fluid-imbibition direction. A 5 wt% KI solution was used as the treatment fluid. Due to the high
attenuation of the KI fluid, the zones that contain KI fluid appear to be relatively brighter on
the radiographs highlighting the fluid flow pathways. The first X-ray radiograph was taken at 4
minutes after the start of the experiment and the entire spontaneous imbibition test was conducted
for 100 minutes with one image taken at 1-minute intervals. Figure 11.3a–d show the radiographs of
the fluid-imbibed conditions at the selected experimental times of 4, 10, 30, and 100 minutes. There
are a couple of interesting observations in this series of images. First, the OMZ is relatively brighter
than Cal-Z zone in Figure 11.3, which is completely opposite to the contrast as observed in the orig￾inal state (Figure 11.1a). This indicates that KI fluid transported very fast in the microfracture abun￾dant OMZ and even at the 4 minutes of the imbibition test, the fluid front had already traveled from
the left side of the sample to the right side of the sample. Secondly, some bright strings were
observed in Figure 11.3a, which indicates that the abundant microfractures in Cal-Z zone were
filled with KI fluid in less than 4 minutes. This means that the fluid moved very fast in microfrac￾tures containing Cal-Z as well. Different from the microfracture-dominated areas, the fluid front
progressed very slowly in the Cal-Z matrix. The fluid front is marked in Figure 11.3d at 100 minutes
into the imbibition test.

network; Blue: disconnected porosity.
11.2 Fluid Uptake Pathways 239Figure 11.4 shows the zoomed-in section in the fluid contact side to accurately measure the dis￾tance of fluid front movement in the matrix of the Cal-Z zone at the selected experimental time, in
which 120 μm was determined to be the travel distance at 100 minutes of the imbibition time. The
distance of the fluid front vs. time was plotted in Figure 11.5. Except at the very beginning of the
imbibition test, the fluid front movement rate in the matrix of the Cal-Z zone was calculated to be at
about 72 μm/h.
In summary, the test results indicate that the fluid flow pathways are dominated by the connected
fracture networks. The fluid flow in the matrix is much slower than that in the connected fractures.
11.3 Mechanical Property Change After Fluid Exposure
The structural complexity of these laminated source shales occurs at all scales from macro to micro,
and nanometer highlighting the need for tools that can characterize the fluid flow of this inhomo￾geneous anisotropic porous material on multiple scales when possible (Zeszotarski et al. 2004). In
this section, two sets of experiments were designed and conducted to evaluate the rock property
evolution after fluid exposure, one at the cylindrical core-scale level and the other one at the micro￾scale level. The outcrop from an Eagle Ford Shale was used in this study.

11.3 Mechanical Property Change After Fluid Exposure 24111.3.1 Experimental Methods
11.3.1.1 Materials
11.3.1.1.1 Rock Sample Adjacent cylindrical Eagle Ford core samples were prepared perpendic￾ular to the bedding plan for mechanical testing both at the core scale and microscale. All the core
plugs were 1-in. in diameter, while the lengths were different depending on the type of test. The
length of the core plugs used for the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test was 2-in. The
length of the core plugs used for the Brazilian tensile strength test was 0.4-in. The length of the
core plugs used for the microindentation test was 0.5-in. in length. Core plug surfaces were then
fine-trimmed using a target surface trimmer and polished using an Allied High Tech Multiprep
surface polisher with abrasive discs. The TOC of these outcrop Eagle Ford samples was around
2–4.5 wt%. The mineral content, determined by XRD, shows that it is mainly composed of
76.3 wt% calcite, 1.5 wt% dolomite, 17.5 wt% quartz, 1.8 wt% gypsum, a minor amount of clay
(1.7 wt% kaolinite) and trace amount of pyrite.
11.3.1.1.2 Treatment Fluids for Cylindrical Core Plugs Three fluids were prepared as the treatment
fluids for the cylindrical core plugs mechanical testing. Two different forms of friction reducer were
used in this set of experiments. The friction reducer used in this study was an acrylamide-based
terpolymer composed of acrylamide, acrylic acid, and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid.
Fluid 1 was 2 wt% KI; Fluid 2 was 0.015 wt% friction reducer (CELB-217-063-2, 80% active, product
from ChemEOR, in a solid form) in 2%/KCl; Fluid 3 was 0.015 wt% friction reducer (DP/EM 5015,
30% active, product from SNF, in an emulsion form) in 2% KCl.
11.3.1.2 Experimental Procedure
11.3.1.2.1 UCS and Brazilian Tensile Strength Test The UCS test procedure was based on ASTM
D7012-14 (2014). Two sets of strain gauges were attached to the center of the sample to measure
deformation in both the axial and radial directions. The stress–strain curve was generated during
the UCS test. Young’s modulus was calculated from the linear portion of the stress–strain curve.
The Brazilian tensile strength test was performed to determine the tensile strength of specimens.
The testing procedure was based on ASTM D3967-08 (2008).
11.3.1.2.2 Fluid Treatment for Cylindrical Core Plugs In order to quantify the effects of fluids on
shale mechanical properties, UCS and Brazilian tests were conducted on both “untreated” and
“treated” sample specimens. Untreated specimens refer to cylindrical samples that were tested
in as-received state, i.e. before the fluid treatment. Treated specimens refer to core plugs being
soaked in three days (72 hours) under room temperature.
11.3.1.2.3 Microindentation Testing and Its Mapping Procedure The microindentation instrument
used in this study was a Nanovea PB1000. A core plug was first labeled with 2 cm tape at the bottom
and marked the point 3 mm from the left on the tape as x = 0. Then, the core plug was fixed on the
stage to make sure that the straight line of the label was parallel with the y direction of the stage. We
outlined the measure area with the indenter tip (red dots in Figure 11.6). Figure 11.6 shows the
mapping protocol for microindentation testing. The microindentation of as-received outcrop
Eagle Ford shale was conducted first with the mapped 25 points (0.1 mm apart) labeled as
“untreated.” To shorten the fluid treatment time, deionized (DI) water was used as the treatment
fluid. The entire shale sample was submerged in DI water for 2 hours. The microindentation test of
242 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluidsthe DI water-treated rock sample was then conducted again with the mapped 25 points labeled as
“treated.” For the single-load microindentation, the maximum load is 0.5 N, the loading and
unloading rate are both 1 N/min, when it reaches the max load, the creep time is 7 seconds.
11.3.2 Results and Discussion
11.3.2.1 UCS and Brazilian Test on Cylindrical Core Plugs
The UCS, Brazilian tensile strength, and Young’s modulus of the outcrop Eagle Ford samples,
untreated and treated with three different fluids, are shown in Figure 11.7. The general trend
observed is that the value of all three parameters decreased to various degrees when compared with
the untreated sample. In the case of UCS, the degree of reduction for the treated samples ranged
from 50 to 60%. Although the Brazilian tensile strength of the three fluid-treated samples remained
in a similar range, the failure patterns for Fluids 2 and 3 treated samples were different. Figure 11.8
shows the fracture patterns for these two-fluids treated samples using industrial Computed Tomog￾raphy (CT) scan with a resolution of 20 μm. There was a primary fracture cross-through for the
sample treated with Fluid 2 (Figure 11.8a), which behaved more like a brittle failure. While for
the sample treated with the Fluid 3, there was no primary fracture observed during the failure proc￾ess (Figure 11.8b). This suggests that the sample became more ductile.
11.3.2.2 Microindentation Test
Microindentation and nanoindentation have proven to be great tools tomechanically characterize geo￾logical porous material and, more lately, source rocks (Barsoum et al. 2004; Ulm and Abousleiman
2006; Broitman 2017). Instrumented indentation technique (including both micro- and nanoinden￾tation) is achieved by a high-resolution system that can drive an indenter tip made of diamond into
and withdraw it from a sample material. During the process, the loads and displacements of the tip
are recorded by positional sensors from which the mechanical properties can be derived. Microin￾dentation and nanoindentation testing differ in a couple of ways, but the results are expected to be
able to compare, if the tip geometries used can provide similar strains in the material when testing,
such as the Vickers and Berkovich shaped tips. Both Berkovich and Vickers shaped tips are
commonly used on microindentation, while the Berkovich shaped indenter tip is preferred in
nanoindentation. The difference between the tip shapes is that the Vickers tip is a four-sided pyr￾amid, while the Berkovich tip is a three-sided pyramid. The Berkovich tip is sharper than the

244 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation FluidsVickers tip, but it is more fragile. The Vickers indenter is a safer option for deep surface penetration
when high load indentation (usually a few Newtons or more) is required. Even though the hardness
values are calculated as the peak force divided by the area of contact (Eq. 11.1) for both microin￾dentation and nanoindentation, the definition of the contact area differs between these two
techniques.
Hardness = Peak Force
Contact Area
11 1
For microindentation, the contact area in Eq. (11.1) is the surface area of the tip-faces that are in
contact with the sample, while for nanoindentation the contact area is defined as the projected area
of the contact between the sample and the tip.
Figure 11.9 shows the load-depth curve of the as-received outcrop Eagle Ford sample untreated
(a) and treated (b) with DI water. The depth at the load of 0.5 N ranges from 2.9 to 6.6 μm for the
untreated sample; the depth ranges from 4.4 to 10.4 μm for the DI water-treated sample. The depth
is deeper in general after DI water treatment, which indicates the softening effect by DI water
treatment.
Table 11.1 lists the parameter comparison for the outcrop Eagle Ford sample before and after DI
water treatment. Under the same peak force, the maximum depth for the treated samples is deeper
and the degree of hardness reduction was nearly 30% for the treated sample, which indicates that
the rock sample was softened after DI water treatment.
11.4 Morphology and Minerology Changes After Fluid Exposure
The study on this part of the research is to quantify the morphological and mineralogical changes in
OM rich zones when organic-rich tight carbonate rock samples are exposed to three different types
of aqueous-based treatment fluid.

246 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluids11.4.1 Experimental Methods
11.4.1.1 Materials
11.4.1.1.1 Rock Samples A highly laminated lime mudstone sample from the same basin in the
Middle Eastern Field used for the microCT study was used for the morphological and mineralogic
studies. Three thin-section samples with dimensions 7.5 × 7.5 × 2.5 mm (length × width × thick￾ness) were prepared and glued to a piece of fiberglass. Each rock surface was then fine-trimmed
using a Leica EM TXP trimmer and milled using a Leica EM TIC 3X broad ion beam mill. The
TOC of the bulk sample was around 8.2 wt%. The mineral content of the thin-section sample deter￾mined by XRD showed that it was mainly composed of 92 wt% calcite, 2 wt% dolomite, 3 wt%
quartz, and minor amounts of pyrite (less than 1 wt%), kaolinite (less than 1 wt%), and illitic clay
(less than 1 wt%).
11.4.1.1.2 Treatment Fluids Three aqueous-based treatment fluids (2 wt% KCl, 0.015 wt% fric￾tion reducer, and synthetic seawater, hereinafter referred as Fluid 4, 5, 6, respectively) were
selected in this study to investigate the interactions between the fluids and the tight organic-rich
carbonate source rocks. Fluid 4 was 2 wt% KCl (pH = 7.1), which does not contain any polymers.
Fluid 5 was 0.015 wt% friction reducer (DP/EM 5015, 30% active, product from SNF, in an
emulsion form) in 2 wt% KCl. This fluid was selected because of the common practice of using
slickwater fracturing in stimulating the unconventional fields. Fluid 6 was synthetic seawater.
Seawater was selected because it has been considered as a preferred base fluid for preparing
stimulation fluid for offshore stimulation jobs or some areas where there is a freshwater shortage
issue. Concerns associated with seawater usage mainly derive from its potential negative impacts
to the reservoir formation and downhole tools such as mineral precipitation, corrosion, and scale
formation. Thus, a comprehensive study on the impact of seawater on the formation from micro￾scopic imaging and flow characteristics standpoint is needed. The composition of the synthetic
seawater used in our study was based on the water analysis of the representative seawater sam￾ple from one Middle Eastern region (Table 11.2). The total dissolved solids (TDS) are around
57,000 mg/l.

11.4 Morphology and Minerology Changes After Fluid Exposure 24711.4.1.2 Experimental Procedure
11.4.1.2.1 Surface Characterization using SEM Coupled with EDS The texture and microstructure of
the thin-section rock samples were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images
performed by a Zeiss Sigma HPVP Scanning Electron Microscope. SEM images were taken at
the same locations before and after fluid imbibition to capture the sample’s morphological changes
due to the fluid treatment. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping performed by a
coupled Bruker XFlash 6130 Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy detector was used to investigate the
elemental changes on the thin-section surface exposed to the electron beam before and after fluid
treatment.
11.4.1.2.2 Fluid Treatment Due to the fact that the amount of mineral dissolution is related to
the mass ratio of the treatment fluid to the rock sample, the ratio in this study was chosen to be
the same at 10 : 1 for all three fluid treatments. Each thin-section rock sample was submerged
in a treatment fluid for 48 hours at ambient temperature and then vacuum-dried at 80 C for
24 hours.
11.4.1.2.3 Quantification of Dissolved Ions in the Treatment Fluids The three treatment fluids imme￾diately after preparation were first analyzed as controls using inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
with optical emission spectrometer (OES) technique. After the sample imbibition test, all three
treatment fluids were analyzed to quantify the dissolved ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+, with
the results being expressed in mg/l (or ppm).
11.4.2 Results and Discussion
11.4.2.1 SEM and EDS Mapping of Thin-Section Surface before Fluid Treatment
11.4.2.1.1 Morphology Characterization Before the fluid treatment, multiple SEM images and EDS
maps were acquired at different locations for each of the polished thin-section surfaces at the initial
condition. Figure 11.10 shows one set of SEM images of the representative area on the polished
surface (Figure 11.10a) and their magnified images from the sequenced blue-framed areas
(Figure 11.10b–d). Similar to what we see from the microCT image in Figure 11.1, two distinguished
zones were observed in Figure 11.10a. A Cal-Z, mainly composed of calcite crystals, was shown as
light grey color in image. The OMZ, ranging from 400 to 500 μm in width in this sample, was shown
as a darker gray band in the middle of the image. The texture of the OMZ could be seen in more
details from the magnified images in Figure 11.10b–d. The OM rich areas appeared as black stringers
in layered structures, which was also intermixed with other minerals such as calcite, dolomite,
pyrite, etc. Nanopore structures within the OM were observed in the higher magnified image
(Figure 11.10d). The intra-organic pore was the dominant pore type present in this sample. Hakami
et al. (2016) have reported similar porous OM in a similar basin. Pommer and Milliken (2015) also
reported that the nanopore generated within OM was the dominant pore type in Eagle Ford shale play
in North America.
11.4.2.1.2 Mineral Identification Another representative OMZ from the same thin-section
sample was characterized by SEM image and the elemental mapping from EDS analysis shown
in Figure 11.11. Figure 11.11a was the secondary electron SEM image; Figure 11.11b–d were EDS
maps of Ca, Si, and Al, respectively. The mineral compositions could be semi-quantified using the
pseudo composite mapping, which combines all detectable elements from calcium (Ca), silicon
(Si), aluminum (Al), magnesium (Mg), etc. For example, in Figure 11.11e, the areas where both Fe
248 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluidsand S show high amounts are identified as pyrite; the areas where both Ca and Mg occur are
identified as dolomite; the areas where Ca is high but Mg is undetectable are identified as calcite;
the areas where high Si yet no Al are identified as quartz; and the area where both high Si and
Al are high are identified as clay minerals. This is the way we registered different minerals from
SEM images. In the pseudo-color composite mapping Figure 11.11e, calcite was shown as

250 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluidsmineral crystals (size around 20 × 10 μm) were observed inside the OM rich area. Figure 11.12b is a
magnified portion of the mineral clusters in the blue-framed area in Figure 11.12a. Due to the lami￾nated nature of the OMZs, microfractures that were parallel to the laminations were observed
(Figure 11.12b). Figure 11.12c shows the pseudo-color composite mapping from the EDS analysis
of S, Fe, Ca, and C for the blue-framed area in Figure 11.12b, confirming that the mineral crystals in
Figure 11.12b were mainly pyrite. In this case, calcite crystals showed as bright light blue and OM
showed in dark green (Figure 11.12c).
11.4.2.2 SEM and EDS Mapping of Thin-Section Surface after Fluid Treatment
The SEM and EDS mapping of the thin-section sample surface were performed at the same loca￾tions after the three aqueous-based fluid treatment fluids. Again, Fluid 4 was 2 wt% KCl (pH = 7.1).
Fluid 5 was 0.015 wt% friction reducer (DP/EM 5015, 30% active from SNF in an emulsion form) in
2% KCl. Fluid 6 was synthetic seawater.

OMZ before and after 2 wt% KCl treatment. The pair images (Figure 11.13a,b) were conducted at a
lower resolution than the pair Figure 11.13c,d. In its original state shown in the first pair

11.4 Morphology and Minerology Changes After Fluid Exposure 251(Figure 11.13a), calcite crystals appeared as light gray and pyrite crystals appeared as bright
nearly circular-shaped crystal clusters, called framboids. The upper portion of the image
Figure 11.13a has more calcite present, which was labeled as calcite-rich OMZ. The lower portion
was dominated with stringing-featured, OM-rich gray area, which was labeled as OM-rich OMZ.
Two euhedral rhomb-shaped dolomite crystal showed on this image, and they were also sur￾rounded by OM-rich stringers. In the upper side of calcite-rich OMZ in Figure 11.13b, the surface
of fluid treated sample was relatively rough (high relief ) and appeared more porous. This might
be due to the dissolution of calcite crystals in 2 wt% KCl solution, leaving cavities on the rock
surface. In the lower portion of OM-rich OMZ in Figure 11.13b where silicate and aluminosilicate
minerals are present, fewer cavities were observed except that two dolomite crystals were
detached from the surface. This was probably because less calcite is present in this area and also
the mineral dissolution initiated around the interfaces between the dolomite crystals and OMZ,
then somehow the dolomite crystal was dislodged from its original location. There was no OM
dissolution observed in this pair of images.
In images Figure 11.13c,d, one clay-rich area was located in the center of the OMZ, which was
labeled as clay-rich OMZ. Both top and bottom zones were calcite-rich OMZ. There was one micro￾fracture cross the entire image area in nearly horizontal direction (Figure 11.13c). After the 2 wt%
KCl fluid treatment, the calcite dissolution was more pronounced in calcite-rich OMZ, while rel￾atively less dissolution was observed in the clay-rich OMZ (Figure 11.13d).

and after 2 wt% KCl fluid treatment (b and d). Small calcite crystals were dissolved.
252 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation FluidsAnother feature observed with 2 wt% KCl fluid treatment from the two pairs of SEM images in
Figure 11.13 was the creation and enlargement of microfractures and/or reopening filled fractures.
After 2 wt% KCl fluid treatment, there was one pronounced long fracture crossing the entire image
shown in both Figure 11.13b,d. In their initial state (Figure 11.13a,c), these two microfractures were
not quite as pronounced. This might be due to mineral dissolution from the pre-filled fractures with
the fluid treatment. Since the microfracture had an irregular shape, the apertures of the microfrac￾ture in the paired images were measured at multiple points with the direction perpendicular to
the fracture (Table 11.3). Each individual point n (1 to 11 ) in Figure 11.13b,d corresponded to the
point n (1–11) in images Figure 11.13a,c. In general, for the pre-existing microfractures, the
apertures in the treated rock sample were measured to be 2–7 times larger than the ones in its
original state. For the newly generated microfracture across points 3 , 4 , and 5 due to fluid
treatment, the aperture size ranged from 1 to 2 μm.
11.4.2.2.2 Treatment with Fluid 5 (0.015 wt% Friction Reducer) Figure 11.14 shows three pairs of
SEM images in the OMZ before and after 0.015 wt% friction reducer (in 2 wt% KCl) treatment.
The pair images (Figure 11.14a,b) were conducted at lower resolution than the other two pairs
of images. At its initial condition (Figure 11.14a), the sample surface appeared to be tight and pores
were not visible under this image resolution. There was a partially filled fracture across the image in
the diagonal direction (the direction of lamination). After the friction reducer fluid treatment, mul￾tiple empty spots were shown on the image Figure 11.14b, which indicated that the rock surface
became more porous after fluid treatment.
Figure 11.14c,d are the second pair of SEM images in a calcite-rich OMZ and they were acquired
at higher magnification than Figure 11.14a,b before and after the friction reducer fluid treatment.
At its initial condition (Figure 11.14c), the surface was shown with abundant calcite crystals with
different sizes. There was also one porous OM-rich mass (about 8 μm in diameter) shown on the top
left side of the image surrounded by calcite crystals. After slickwater fluid treatment, some rela￾tively small calcite crystals (less than 5 μm), which were on at the initial state disappeared after

porous OM-rich area and the large-sized calcite crystals (bigger than 5 μm) seemed to remain
unchanged.
Figure 11.14e,f are the third pair of high-resolution SEM images for an area in the OMZ before
and after friction reducer fluid treatment. At its initial condition (Figure 11.14e), there was a large
OM mass (approximately 40 × 25 μm) shown on the surface, which had a microfracture across it.
Some intra- nanopores were observed on the left side of the OM, while relatively fewer were shown
on the right side of the microfracture. Similar to Figure 11.14c, this OM mass was also surrounded

254 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluidsby calcite crystals. After friction reducer fluid treatment, the relatively smaller-sized calcite crystals
(less than 5 μm) were completed dissolved by the fluid treatment (Figure 11.14f ), while for rela￾tively large-sized calcite or dolomite particles (bigger than 5 μm), the mineral dissolution was only
observed on the edge and the surface. The other components such as silicate minerals and OM
remain unchanged after friction reducer fluid exposure.
In order to quantify the changes of the microfracture due to the fluid treatment, the apertures at
multiple points were measured with the direction perpendicular to the fracture for the paired
images (Table 11.4). The aperture of the microfracture remains in a similar range after friction
reducer fluid treatment.
11.4.2.2.3 Treatment with Fluid 6 (Synthetic Seawater) Figure 11.15 shows three pairs of SEM
images in the OMZ before and after the synthetic seawater treatment. The pair images
(Figure 11.15a,b) were conducted at lower resolution than the other two pairs of images. At its ini￾tial condition (Figure 11.15a), there was one open microfracture, which was parallel to the lami￾nation direction observed. Different from 2 wt% KCl and 0.015 wt% friction reducer fluid
treatments, very minimal mineral dissolution was observed since the rock surface after seawater
fluid treatment did not contain many newly generated empty spots. Another observation was that
significant amount of mineral precipitation mainly composed of NaCl was observed covering the
surface of the pre-existing microfracture.
Two more pairs of SEM images (Figure 11.15c,d and e,f ) with higher magnification in two other
areas in the OMZ before and after the synthetic water treatment were presented. Similar to what
was observed in the pair images of Figure 11.15a,b, the rock surface after seawater fluid treatment does
not contain many newly generated empty spots, indicating that the calcite dissolution is very little.
A small amount of mineral precipitation was also observed on the rock surface. The aperture of the

11.4.2.3 Quantification of Dissolved Ions in the Treatment Fluids
From the mineralogy analysis, the main minerals in the Middle Eastern sample were calcite, dolo￾mite, quartz, and minor amounts of pyrite, kaolinite, and illitic clay. Among these minerals, calcite
has the highest solubility in water than other minerals.

Figure 11.15 Three pairs of SEM images from the OMZ of source rock section sample before (a, c, and e)
and after the synthetic seawater fluid treatment (b, d, and f ).
256 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation FluidsCalcite dissolution on the rock surface was observed in all three treatment fluids in the morphol￾ogy study using the SEM coupled with the EDS. A more significant amount of calcite dissolution
was observed for the 2 wt% KCl and 0.015 wt% friction reducer fluids treated sample than the syn￾thetic seawater treated sample. This might be due to the solution difference of these three fluids.
Since seawater contains relatively high concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, lowering the solubility of
calcite. Dissolution or dislocation of dolomite were also observed in 2% KCl fluid treated rock sam￾ple. Other minerals such as quartz and majority of OM remain undissolved in all three aqueous￾based fluids.
The expected majority of dissolved ions in the treatment fluids were Ca2+, Mg2+ along with other
commonly observed cations in carbonate rocks, such as Sr2+. To quantify the changes of the cations,
the concentrations of these three cations for the prepared treatment fluids were analyzed
by ICP-OES as the control. Then the fluids after the rock treatment were analyzed as well.
The difference of these three cations for all three fluids after rock treatment were presented as
the μg dissolution per gram of rock sample for a better comparison (Table 11.5).
The ICP analysis for the treatment fluids further confirms the mineral dissolution observed from
the surface morphology studies. It also quantifies the difference of dissolution capacities among
these three fluids. As shown in Table 11.5, the Ca2+ dissolution was higher for the 2 wt% KCl treat￾ment than that for the friction reducer treatment fluid. 700.9 μg of Ca2+ ion per gram of rock was
dissolved in 2 wt% KCl and 522.7 μg of Ca2+ ion per gram of rock was dissolved in 0.015 wt% friction
reducer treatment fluids. Around 35 μg of Mg2+ ion per gram of rock was dissolved in these two
fluids. The increase of ion concentrations in Ca2+ and Mg2+ verifies the calcite and dolomite crys￾tals dissolution into the treatment fluids. The dissolution of calcite in seawater was lower than that
in 2 wt% KCl and 0.015 wt% friction reducer, which is consistent with our observation from the
surface morphology study. Small amounts of Sr2+ ion increases (less than 14 μg per gram of rock)
were also observed in all three treatment fluids, possibly resulting from the presence of minor or
trace amounts of strontium carbonate or sulfate minerals in this suite of rocks.
11.5 Flow Property Change After Fluid Exposure
To further assess the impacts of morphological change due to aqueous-based fluids treatment in
terms of mineral dissolution and precipitation on flow parameters of rock samples, permeability
measurements with fluid treatment experiments for core plugs were conducted. Due to the lack
of the whole core sample from the Middle Eastern field used in the SEM studies, the analogous
outcrop Eagle Ford core plugs were used to measure the absolute permeability value.

11.5.1.1 Materials
11.5.1.1.1 Rock Sample The TOC of the outcrop Eagle Ford sample was around 5 wt%. The min￾eral content determined by XRD showed that it was mainly composed of 66 wt% calcite, 26 wt%
quartz, 1 wt% dolomite, 2 wt% gypsum, small amount of pyrite (less than 1 wt%), kaolinite
(3 wt%), and illitic clay (1 wt%).
11.5.1.1.2 Treatment Fluids The three aqueous-based treatment fluids used in the flow property
study were the same as the morphological studies in the precious section. Fluid 4 was 2 wt% KCl
(pH = 7.1), which does not contain any polymers. Fluid 5 was 0.015 wt% friction reducer (DP/EM
5015, 30% active from SNF in an emulsion form) in 2 wt% KCl. Fluid 6 was synthetic seawater,
which has the same composition as that shown in Table 11.2.
11.5.1.2 Experimental Procedure
11.5.1.2.1 Fluid Treatment and Flow Characteristics Assessment for Core Plugs The size of the outcrop
Eagle Ford core plugs used in flow properties study was 1.0 in. in diameter and 1.0 in. in length.
Each core plug sample was submerged in the treatment fluid for 72 hours at ambient temperature
and then vacuum-dried at 80 C for 24 hours. The absolute permeability for these core plugs was
measured before and after fluid treatment. The permeability was measured using an AP-608 Auto￾mated Permeameter–Porosimeter from Coretest Systems and the methodology was based on the
pulse decay method proposed by Jones (1997).
11.5.2 Results and Discussion
11.5.2.1 Changes in Flow Characteristics
The absolute permeability measurement under different effective stresses for three Eagle Ford out￾crop core plugs before and after fluid treatment are summarized in Table 11.6. After fluid treatment,
the absolute permeability under different stress conditions was significantly enhanced. The perme￾ability improvement was calculated and listed in the table as well.
The observed permeability increase after fluid–rock interaction is aligned with our expectation
that the mineral dissolution, new microfractures generation, or sealed fractures reopening could
result in the permeability increase. Thirty-five times of absolute permeability increase was observed
under our testing conditions with 2 wt% KCl fluid treatment. Note that the observed absolute per￾meability enhancement considerably depends on the test conditions, such as rock and fluid chem￾ical compositions, temperature, fluid pressure, volumetric solid–fluid ratio and others, while the
test conditions for this work were carefully documented. Caution needs to be taken when applying
the observed values for permeability enhancement to different conditions.
Interestingly, the absolute permeability resulting from mineral dissolution and enlargement of
the microfractures becomes more sensitive to the stress. The stress sensitivity is characterized
by the slope of permeability-effective stress curves shown in Figure 11.16. Using 2 wt% KCl
fluid treatment as an example, the permeability after fluid treatment has a sensitivity factor
of 4 × 10−4 (psi−1
), whereas the permeability before fluid treatment shows a sensitivity factor of
1 × 10−4 (psi−1
). The sensitivity factor increased 4 times after fluid treatment in this case.
This observed stress sensitivity is consistent with what has been reported in the literature, in
which permeability of open microfractures and the alike, rather than sealed/cemented microfrac￾tures are relatively stress sensitive (Khan and Teufel 2000; Laubach et al. 2004; Muralidharan et al.
2004; Abass et al. 2007; Tian 2014; Lavrov 2017).
258 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluids11.6 Conclusions
In this study, we have conducted a multiscale investigation, including the microscale and core scale
tests to study the fluid intake pathways, and their impact on the organic-rich tight carbonate for￾mation rocks in terms of mechanical properties, morphology change, minerology change, and flow
property change. Two sets of organic-rich tight carbonate rock samples were used. One sample set
was a highly laminated lime mudstone from a basin in a Middle Eastern Field that was used in
microscopic studies such as fluid uptake pathways, morphological, and mineralogic aspects. The
second sample set was from an outcrop of the Eagle Ford Shale considered to be analogous to

11.6 Conclusions 259the set from the Middle Eastern Field in terms of mineralogy. The sample set was used in core scale
level studies on rock mechanical and flow properties such as permeability. Below are what we find
from our studies:
• The results from the spontaneous imbibition tests revealed that the fluid traveled very fast and
reached to the other end of the sample in less than 4 minutes in microfractures within both the
OMZs and Cal-Z zones. The water-front progressed very slowly in the Cal-Z matrix. This indi￾cates that the main fluid flow pathways for fracturing fluid could be within the connected fracture
network at different scales, instead of the matrix initially.
• Aqueous-based stimulation fluids significantly lower the mechanical properties including both
the unconfined compressive stress and Brazilian tensile strength of the organic-rich tight carbo￾nate rocks. Microindentation test shows the softening effect by the fluid treatment as well.
• The SEM and EDS results for the fluid-treated source rock samples show that significant calcite
dissolution has been observed in 2 wt% KCl and friction reducer fluid treated sample. In the cases
associated with 2 wt% KCl and friction reducer fluid, reopening of some mineral-filled natural
fractures was observed. The enlargement of microfractures was slightly more noticeable for sam￾ples treated with 2 wt% KCl (2–7 times) than that for fraction reducer fluid treatment at the
micron-scale level. Some NaCl salt precipitation and new microfractures generation were
observed for samples treated with seawater.
• The absolute permeability increases significantly after 72 hours treated in 2 wt% KCl and friction
reducer fluid treatment than synthetic seawater treatment. While more studies are needed under
different test conditions, this study provides experimental evidences that aqueous-based fractur￾ing fluid may potentially have positive effect on gas production from organic-rich carbonate
source rock.
These findings shed a light on the development of an improved hydraulic fracturing treatment by
incorporating the factors that positively affect the production rate while minimizing the factors that
will likely lead to the production rate decline. Below are the factors affecting the production rate in
a positive matter that we should keep in mind when developing new stimulation technologies:
• Enhance connectivity of natural or induced microfractures and keep them open during production.
From the microscopic scale experimental investigation, we have seen the importance of the frac￾tures and microfractures generated by stimulation process as the main fluid flow pathways.
Improving and maintaining the connectivity between the natural and induced microfractures
in the far-field and the primary fracture networks are essential to enhancing the well production
rate in the unconventional fields. These microfractures, besides the primary fracture networks
generated by hydraulic fracturing, should be an important contributor to the high production
rate at the initial production stage. The commonly observed quick production rate decline at least
partially results from the closure of these microfractures. During hydrocarbon production, the
pore pressure declines and accordingly the effective stress increases, resulting in the closure
of these microfractures without proppants during the production. Enhancing connectivity of nat￾ural or induced microfractures and keep them open during production will derive a positive fac￾tor in production.
• Improve dissolution factor and reduce the scale/precipitate formation. Considerable amounts of
dissolutions have been seen with the neutral pH fluid. Enhancing the dissolution factor by acid
fluids for carbonate formation will improve the flow path in a positive way. Addition of the scale
inhibitors or pre-treat seawater could prevent the precipitates or scale formation.
260 11 Multiscale Experimental Study on Interactions Between Imbibed Stimulation Fluids• Minimize softening effects of source rocks. Additives that could be used along with the stimulation
fluid to reduce or minimize the softening effects of the source rocks can potentially reduce the
production rate decline.

Effective Permeability in Fractured Reservoirs
Percolation-Based Effective-Medium Theory

12.1 Introduction
Geologic formations are multi-scale and multi-physical systems. Shale and tight reservoirs, as new
resources of hydrocarbon and energy supplies, are among notable examples (Wang et al. 2017).
However, their low porosity and permeability values make them distinct from other conventional
reservoirs, such as carbonates and sandstones. With recent progress in hydraulic fracturing and
horizontal drilling in the past decade (Friehauf et al. 2009; Malhotra et al. 2014; Saini et al.
2020), unconventional reservoirs became one of the main energy suppliers in the US. However,
modeling fluid flow and transport in such multi-scale systems still requires investigations due to
their complex structures. This is because naturally or hydraulically fractured reservoirs are com￾posed of matrix and fracture networks. The matrix in shale reservoirs consists of pores with sizes
of a few to several hundred nanometers (Nelson 2009; Rijfkogel et al. 2019), while the fracture net￾work may contain fractures of aperture with sizes of a few microns to several hundred microns
(Gale et al. 2007; Olson et al. 2009).
Unconventional reservoir rocks are spatially and temporally heterogeneous at both discrete and
continuum scales (Hyman et al. 2016). At the discrete scale, heterogeneity is due to spatial variation
in pore size, pore connectivity, surface roughness, and mineralogy. At the continuum scale, the
position and orientation of fractures and faults cause spatial heterogeneity. Such small- and
large-scale heterogeneities make the flow and transport modeling challenging in unconventional
reservoirs. In the literature, various approaches, including theoretical (Ebigbo et al. 2016; Fokker
2001; Hunt et al. 2014; Sævik et al. 2013) and numerical (Bogdanov et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2019;
Hyman et al. 2018; Lang et al. 2014) methods, have been developed to model fluid flow and trans￾port in naturally fractured geologic formations or hydraulically fractured reservoirs. In what
follows, we briefly describe two theoretic approaches used to determine effective permeability in
porous media.
12.1.1 Percolation Theory
Percolation theory is a theoretical method from statistical physics to study the effect of heteroge￾neity and connectivity on flow and transport in porous media. Within percolation theory, there
exist two frameworks: insulator-conductor and conductor-superconductor (Stauffer and Aharony
267
Physics of Fluid Flow and Transport in Unconventional Reservoir Rocks, First Edition.
Edited by Behzad Ghanbarian, Feng Liang, and Hui-Hai Liu.
© 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2023 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.1994). In the insulator-conductor framework, a system is composed of insulating and conducting
components with zero and finite conductivities, respectively. In conductor-superconductor frame￾work, however, a system consists of finite-conductivity and infinite-conductivity components.
In percolation theory, a key feature is the presence of a percolation threshold at which an infinite
spanning cluster emerges along with many finite clusters. Below the threshold, all clusters are finite
in size, and there is no spanning (infinite) cluster, while above it, there are still finite clusters along
with the infinite cluster. Above but near the percolation threshold, transport modes, such as effec￾tive permeability, conform to the following power-law scaling
keff p − pc
t
, p > pc 12 1
where p is the occupation probability and pc is the percolation threshold. In very homogeneous
media with negligible local fluctuation in conductivity, the scaling exponent t would be independ￾ent of the structure and geometry of a system, a feature called universality (Hunt et al. 2014). The
universal value of t is 1.3 in two-dimensional and 2 in three-dimensional systems constructed of one
insulating component and one conducting component (Stauffer and Aharony 1994). The value t = 2
in three dimensions incorporates the effects of connectivity and tortuosity (Ghanbarian et al. 2013).
In heterogeneous systems with broad conductance distributions, one should expect t > 2 (Feng et al.
1987). However, in correlated systems, Sahimi (1994) and Sahimi and Mukhopadhyay (1996)
showed that the value of t could be less than 2.
As stated earlier, Eq. (12.1) is theoretically valid in the region above and near the percolation
threshold. However, evidence from experiments and numerical simulations indicate that it is valid
over a much broader region above the threshold (Hunt et al. 2014). To apply Eq. (12.1) to porous
media, such as rocks and fracture networks, one needs to replace p by volumetric fraction of pores
or fractures and pc by critical volume of pores or fractures (Balberg 1987; Hunt et al. 2014).
Within the conductor-superconductor framework, the effective permeability follows a power law
similar to Eq. (12.1). However, its exponent is denoted by s, and its value in three dimensions is 0.76
(Bergman and Stroud 1992). However, a range from 0.37 to 1.30 has been reported in the literature
(McLachlan et al. 2007; Youngs 2002).
It is difficult to address the effective permeability of fractured reservoirs within the context of
percolation theory, either in the insulator-conductor or the conductor-superconductor framework.
In what follows, we briefly review concepts of effective-medium theory, another technique from
statistical physics, that can be used to scale up effective permeability in porous media.
12.1.2 Effective-Medium Theory
Effective-medium theory (EMT) is another technique from statistical physics in which a heter￾ogeneous formation is replaced by a homogeneous one whose effective permeability is the same
as the actual permeability of the heterogeneous formation (David et al. 1990; Doyen 1988; Koplik
et al. 1984). Replacing the heterogeneous system with an equivalent homogeneous one causes
local perturbations because the local permeability is different than the effective permeability.
The effective permeability of a formation can accordingly be calculated by forcing the average
of these local perturbations to be equal to zero (Ghanbarian and Daigle 2016; Kirkpatrick 1973):
k − keff
k +
Z
2 − 1 keff
f k dk = 0 12 2
268 12 Effective Permeability in Fractured Reservoirswhere k is the local permeability, f (k) is the permeability distribution, and Z is the average
coordination number. Eq. (12.2) with Z = 4 in two dimensions and 6 in three dimensions reduces
to the self-consistent approximation.
In a formation composed of two components, e.g. matrix and fracture, Eq. (12.2) reduces to
f m
km − keff
km +
Z
2 − 1 keff
+ 1− f m
kf − keff
kf +
Z
2 − 1 keff
= 0 12 3
where fm and (1 – fm) represent the matrix and fracture fractions, respectively, km is the matrix
permeability, and kf is the fracture permeability.
Results of effective-medium theory are reliable in systems with small variances (Adler and
Berkowitz 2000; Ghanbarian and Daigle 2016; Ghanbarian and Javadpour 2017; Ghanbarian
et al. 2016; Sahimi 2011). Therefore, effective-medium theory is not applicable to highly heteroge￾neous formations with large local permeability variations.
12.2 Objectives
Percolation theory provides a general theoretic framework to calculate the effective permeability in
homogeneous and highly heterogeneous media where the ratio of one component conductivity to
another one is infinitely large (e.g. insulator-conductor or conductor-superconductor systems).
Although effective-medium theory is applicable to systems where more than one permeable
component exists, it is restricted to homogeneous and relatively heterogeneous media with small local
fluctuations. In addition, it is well documented in the literature that power laws from percolation
theory are theoretically valid above and near the percolation threshold (Hunt et al. 2014; Stauffer
and Aharony 1994), whereas effective-medium theory results are accurate far above the threshold
(Sahimi 2003, 2011). The main objectives of this chapter are to (i) present applications of percola￾tion-based effective-medium theory to model effective permeability in matrix-fracture systems and
(ii) compare theoretical estimations of keff with two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations.
12.3 Percolation-Based Effective-Medium Theory
By combining concepts of percolation theory, Eq. (12.1), and the two-component model of effective￾medium theory, Eq. (12.3), McLachlan (1987) proposed percolation-based effective-medium
theory (P-EMT). Adopting his approach for fractured reservoirs composed of matrix and fractures
results in

where ρ is the fracture density, and t is the scaling exponent from percolation theory. ρc is the crit￾ical fracture density below which keff is mainly controlled by the matrix and its permeability km.
Above ρc, however, it is the fracture network that controls keff. Note that if km = kf, then one should
expect keff = km = kf. This criterion is well met by Eq. (12.4) because in such a case the terms
k1 t
m − k1 t
eff and k1 t
f − k1 t
eff would be equal to zero.
12.3 Percolation-Based Effective-Medium Theory 269In Eq. (12.4), keff is implicitly explained in terms of fracture density ρ. Rewriting Eq. (12.4) yields
ρ =

Recently, Sadeghi et al. (2018) proposed an explicit form of the percolation-based effective-medium
theory as follows:

To show the sensitivity of percolation-based effective-medium theory to parameters ρc and t, we
presumed a formation with kf = 10−17 m2 (10 μD) and km = 10−20 m2 (10 nD) and varied the values
of ρc and t. Figure 12.1 shows the effective permeability against the fracture density on both semi￾log and log–log scales for two cases: (i) the critical fracture density ρc (Figures 12.1a and b) and (ii)
12.2 the scaling exponent t (Figures 12.1c and d).
In Figures 12.1a and b, we set t = 1 but varied ρc from 0 to 0.1 (ρc = 0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1).
Figure 12.1b clearly shows that the trend between keff and ρ on the logarithmic scale seems to
be power law at ρ values near 1. Figure 12.1c presents the results for ρc = 0.2 and different t values
ranged from 0.5 to 2 (t = 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2). As can be seen, the shape of the effective permeability
and the slope of the ρc − keff curve over the entire range of fracture density are controlled by the
value of t (Figure 12.1d). The smaller the exponent t, the sharper the variation in keff.
12.4 Comparison with Simulations
In this section, we compare estimations by P-EMT with simulations reported in the literature as
well as those performed in this study. In the following, we first compare theoretical estimations
with two- and three-dimensional simulations of Chen et al. (2019). Next, estimations by P-EMT
are compared with our three-dimensional numerical simulations.
12.4.1 Chen et al. (2019)
In the Chen et al. (2019) study, discrete fracture-matrix networks were composed of lines and ellip￾tical fractures, respectively, in two and three dimensions. Chen et al. (2019) adopted a generalized
lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate fluid flow and to determine the effective permeability
keff in such networks. In what follows, we briefly describe their simulations in two and three
dimensions.
270 12 Effective Permeability in Fractured Reservoirs12.4.1.1 Two-Dimensional Simulations
Chen et al. (2019) represented a two-dimensional matrix-fracture system by a square domain of size
L (= 200 lattices or 4 cm). The domain was initially composed of a matrix only with permeability
km = 10−20 m2 (10 nD). First, two random numbers were generated based on a uniform distribution
to determine the coordinates of two points in the domain. Next, a fracture with the width of one
lattice unit and permeability of 3.33 × 10−9 m2 (3.33 × 103 D; based on the cubic law) was created by
connecting the two points via a straight line. Using the same approach, fractures were added to the
domain until the desired fracture density was reached. In their study, the fracture density was
defined as the ratio of the total fracture length to the entire area of the domain
ρ = Lf
L2 12 7
where L is the domain size, and Lf is the total fracture length.
The matrix permeability was set equal to 10−20 m2 (10 nD), while the fracture permeability kf
varied between 1 × 10−17 m2 (10 μD) and 1 × 10−14 (10 mD). The generalized LB method of
Guo and Zhao (2002), in which the generalized Navier–Stokes equation is solved, was applied
to simulate fluid flow along one direction using a pressure drop of 2 × 10−6 (lattice units).

12.4 Comparison with Simulations 271The implemented pressure drop was low enough to guarantee laminar flow. Chen et al. (2019)
applied the periodic boundary conditions and the Darcy equation to determine keff.
In Figure 12.2, we show two-dimensional simulations from Chen et al. (2019) for four different
matrix-fracture systems with log(kf/km) = 3, 4, 5, and 6. The theoretical estimations of keff by
P-EMT are also presented in this figure. We found that Eq. (12.6) with t = 1 and ρc = 0 accurately
estimates the keff at different fracture densities. The average relative error is less than 23% and
the calculated RMSLE values are smaller than 0.099 indicating well agreement between the
theoretical estimations and the numerical simulations in two dimensions.
The scaling exponent t = 1 is in well agreement with the exponents 0.79 (for log(kf/km) = 3), 0.92
(for log(kf/km) = 4), 0.94 (for log(kf/km) = 5), and 0.95 (for log(kf/km) = 6) derived by Chen et al.
(2019) who fitted a power law to their ρc − keff simulations (ρ > 0.01). We should point out that the

carried out on two-dimensional domains with log(kf/km) = 3, 4, 5, and 6. For theoretical estimations by
percolation-based effective-medium theory and Eq. (12.6), we used t = 1, ρc = 0, km = 10−20 m2
, and kf = 10−17,
10−16, 10−15, and 10−14 m2
. Source: Data adapted from Chen et al. (2019).
272 12 Effective Permeability in Fractured Reservoirsuniversal scaling exponent t = 1.3 in two dimensions from percolation theory (Stauffer and
Aharony 1994) resulted in less accurate estimations of keff than t = 1 (results not shown). Note that
P-EMT (Eq. 12.4) with t = 1 and ρc = 2/Z reduces to the effective-medium theory (Eq. 12.3).
Although having t = 1 is consistent with the effective-medium theory, ρc = 0 means Z = ∞ within
the EMT framework, which is not physically supported. The value ρc = 0 is in accord with the simu￾lations since Chen et al. (2019) included a boundary region around the fractures, so they did not
percolate through the domain.
12.4.1.2 Three-Dimensional Simulations
Chen et al. (2019) generated the matrix-fracture system in three dimensions using the three￾dimensional DFN (Hyman et al. 2014, 2015) based on which individual fractures are represented
as planar polygons. In the DFN approach, fractures are assigned a shape, location, width, and ori￾entation. In the study of Chen et al. (2019), the fracture network was composed of 855 elliptical
fractures. The radius of fractures followed a truncated power-law distribution with lower and upper

Fisher distribution, and the fracture location was uniformly distributed through the domain. Chen
et al. (2019) defined fracture density in three dimensions as the ratio of the total fracture area to the
entire matrix-fracture system volume. After generating the three-dimensional matrix-fracture
systems using the stochastic discrete fracture-matrix networks, the generalized LB method of
Guo and Zhao (2002) was used to simulate fluid flow in the matrix-fracture systems.
Figure 12.3 shows the simulated effective permeability against the fracture density. We also
show the keff estimated by P-EMT. As can be seen, Eq. (12.6) with t = 2, ρc = 0, kf = 1.35 ×
10−12 m2
, and km = 1.35 × 10−20 m2 accurately estimates the effective permeability with
RMSLE = 0.128 and average relative error = −17.19%. Although the negative average relative error
indicates that, on average, P-EMT underestimates the keff, there is good agreement between the
theory and the simulations (Figure 12.3). The exponent t = 2 is consistent with the universal scaling
exponent in three dimensions from percolation theory (Stauffer and Aharony 1994). The critical
fracture density ρc = 0 is also in accord with the two-dimensional estimations by Eq. (12.6) shown
in Figure 12.2.
12.4.2 New Three-Dimensional Simulations
In this study, we generated three three-dimensional matrix-fracture systems using cubic domains of
size of 2 cm and the DFNWORKS software package (Hyman et al. 2015). Within the DFN frame￾work, individual fractures were represented by a single family of planar discs with a constant radius
of 5 m within a 50 m cubic domain, which is different from the three-dimensional simulations of
Chen et al. (2019). The orientation of fractures was sampled from a Fisher distribution with an
intensity parameter of 0.1 that resulted in a uniform covering of the unit sphere and equiprobable
random orientations. We considered networks composed of 50, 100, 200, 267, 300, 400, and 500
fractures. At a count of 267, the fracture network percolated through the domain.

estimated by the percolation-based effective-medium theory (solid line) versus fracture density. Simulations
were carried out on three-dimensional domains with log(kf/km) = 8. For theoretical estimations by
percolation-based effective-medium theory and Eq. (12.6), we used t = 2, ρc = 0, kf = 1.35 × 10−12 m2
, and
km = 1.35 × 10−20 m2
. Source: Data adapted from Chen et al. (2019).
274 12 Effective Permeability in Fractured ReservoirsAfter generating the three-dimensional fracture networks, we created an octree-refined volume
mesh using the upscaled discrete fracture matrix (UDFM) method presented by Sweeney et al.
(2020). In the UDFM, the mesh surrounding fractures was refined for a better representation
of the network and fewer false connections between fractures. The spatially variable mesh
was composed of tetrahedron, but we computed the dual mesh, which is composed of three￾dimensional Voronoi control volumes. If a fracture intersected a control volume, then it was
considered as a fracture cell. If not, then it was tagged as a matrix cell. The value of matrix
permeability varied from one system to another (km = 10−12, 10−14, and 10−16 m2
), while the
fracture permeability was fixed at 10−10 m2
. The outlet flow rate was calculated using the flow
solver PFLOTRAN (Lichtner et al. 2015), which solves the pressure Poisson equation. Pressures
2 and 1 MPa were applied as boundary conditions at the two sides of the domains. The effective
permeability for each network was determined using the Darcy equation and the numerical simu￾lations under steady-state conditions.
Figure 12.4 shows the simulated effective permeability against the fracture density for the three
matrix-fracture systems studied here. We also display the estimated values by P-EMT, Eq. (12.6)
with t = 2, ρc = 0.1, kf = 10−10 m2
, and km = 10−12, 10−14, and 10−16 m2
. As can be seen, there exists
a good agreement between the simulations and the theory. The average relative error ranged
from −50% for log(kf/km) = 6 to 3% for log(kf/km) = 2. We found RMSLE = 0.025, 0.234, and
0.526, respectively, for systems with log(kf/km) = 2, 4, and 6. Although the value of RMSLE
increases from log(kf/km) = 2 to 6, the obtained results are promising. Our keff estimations are
based on first principles from percolation-based effective-medium theory without any ad hoc
parameters.
The value t = 2 is in accord with the universal scaling exponent in three dimensions from
percolation theory (Stauffer and Aharony 1994). It is also consistent with our results obtained
from three-dimensional simulations of Chen et al. (2019) presented in Figure 12.3. Regarding
the critical fracture density, the value ρc = 0.1 is very close to the critical volume fraction
of 0.114 reported by Clark et al. (2020), who investigated the effective permeability in
irregular composite porous media composed of two distinct materials with two different
permeability values.
12.5 Conclusion
We proposed applications of percolation-based effective-medium theory (P-EMT) to model the
effective permeability in fractured reservoirs where the matrix and fracture network contribute
to fluid flow. The proposed model estimates the keff from matrix permeability, km, fracture
permeability, kf, fracture density, ρ, critical fracture density, ρc, and scaling exponent, t. To evaluate
P-EMT, theoretical estimations were compared with two- and three-dimensional numerical simu￾lations. Results showed good agreement between the theory and the simulations. We found that the
scaling exponent t = 1 resulted in accurate estimations of keff in two dimensions, while t = 2 led to
good agreement between the theory and simulations in three dimensions. In contrast to other
empirical and semi-empirical models, our proposed keff model based on percolation-based effec￾tive-medium theory has no ad hoc parameters and is predictive once the parameters t, ρc, km,
and kf are known for fractured reservoirs. Further investigations are still required to better
understand how the scaling exponent t and critical fracture density ρc may vary from one geologic
formation to another.

13.1 Shale Reservoirs with Complex Fracture Networks
Shale oil and gas reservoirs with extremely low porosity and permeability and natural fractures are
located all over the world, as displayed in Figure 13.1. Recently, advances in horizontal drilling and
multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have enabled rapid economic developments of shale gas and oil
reservoirs. It has been reported that shale gas production in 2018 accounted for 70% of total US
natural gas production (US Energy Information Administration 2019). During the hydraulic frac￾turing process, the pre-existing natural fractures in shale might be activated, and a very complex
fracture network might be formed, as shown in Figures 13.2 and 13.3. The created complex fracture
networks will greatly enhance the contact surface area between shale and fractures and help the
extraction of fluid flow from shale rocks (Maxwell et al. 2002; Fisher et al. 2004; Gale et al. 2007;
Warpinski et al. 2009).
Generally, there is high uncertainty in natural fracture distribution and hydraulic fracture geom￾etry, which plays an important role in fluid flow in unconventional reservoirs. Many fracture diag￾nostic techniques, such as microseismic, distributed temperature sensing, and distributed acoustic
sensing, and many fracture propagation models have been widely applied to characterize and pre￾dict the fracture geometries (Olson 2008; Vermylen and Zoback 2011; Weng et al. 2011; Fisher and
Warpinski, 2012; Wu and Olson 2014, 2015; Raterman et al. 2017; Gale et al. 2018; Maity 2018).
Although the understanding of complex fracture networks has been improved, the impacts of nat￾ural fracture on well performance through reservoir simulation are still required to be ascertained.
13.2 Complex Fracture Reservoir Simulation
Accurate reservoir simulation with 3D complex hydraulic and natural fractures is vital to help
evaluate the impact of fracture complexity on well performance. However, it is very challenging
to simulate hydraulically fractured reservoirs due to the complexity of fracture orientation and
geometry. Three traditional numerical methods are often used, including dual porosity dual per￾meability (DPDK) (Warren and Root 1963), local grid refinement (LGR) (Cipolla et al. 2009),
and unstructured grids (Wang 2015). However, the DPDK method is hard to capture large-scale

2004; Bourbiaux 2010; Moinfar et al. 2011). LGR and unstructured girds can model every single
fracture explicitly. However, in real-field applications, it is still limited because of the high complex￾ity in gridding, especially around fracture intersections, and high computational cost (Du et al.
2017; Fumagalli et al. 2017). Hence, the development of a new fracture modeling technology is
necessary.
13.3 Embedded Discrete Fracture Model
In this chapter, a novel numerical fracture modeling method, named the embedded discrete
fracture model (EDFM), which merges the strengths of both dual-continuum models and
discrete fracture models, is introduced. The EDFM method does not compromise the original

13.3 Embedded Discrete Fracture Model 283gridding scheme of the matrix block, even given sophisticated fracture geometries. The discret￾ization of any fracture is performed by detecting the intersection conditions with the matrix
block boundaries. Xu et al. (2017) introduced a new concept of special connections called
“non-neighboring connections” (NNCs) to record flow information between any in-situ fracture
to other reservoir/fracture medium. The flow information is a measure of how easily fluid can flow
with respect to the effective length of flowing path. Four categories of special connections are
established, namely matrix-fracture, intra-fracture segments, inter-fracture, and fracture-wellbore.
The basic governing equations for these connections are listed in Eqs. (13.1)–(13.4), and a physical/
numerical corresponding illustration can be found in Figures 13.4 and 13.5:

is adapted and modified from the Peaceman formulation (Peaceman 1983; Moinfar et al. 2013).
Xu et al. (2017) have also extensively tested the EDFM method through multiple complex fracture
configurations as well as single-flowing phase simulations and validated against the traditional
LGR method. The computational costs and the accuracy of EDFM were proven to have a superior
balance when compared to the LGR. Miao et al. (2018) have also validated the EDFM method with
multi-flowing phase simulations, further confirming the robust accuracy of the EDFM.
Since the EDFM methods rely solely on the connection through boundary concept, it is very
advantageous over the LGR or unstructured gridding method. These traditional methods rely
rather on the refinement/re-griding of the grid blocks in the near-fracture regions. These concepts
are inefficient in both input (model setup) and output (long simulation running time). Further￾more, they face extreme limitations when the matrix medium is represented through complicated
geometry (such as corner point gridding) and when the fracture boundary geometry is intricate and
3D configured (natural fracture with dip angles/non-planar fractures, etc.). More importantly, the
computational cost of the EDFM only increases linearly with increasing number of fractures; but
such costs associated with LGR/unstructured gridding method would increase exponentially. The
profound power of EDFM was illustrated in several recent studies (Moinfar et al. 2014; Panfili et al.
2015; Du et al. 2017).
Another significance of the EDFM method is its non-intrusiveness, which means that it can real￾ize the NNC concepts without accessing the source codes when coupled with a reservoir simulator.
The EDFM has been successfully applied within several in-house and commercial reservoir simu￾lators, which have NNC functionality. With more than 10 years of technical development, EDFM
technology has appeared and assisted in multiple applications within various fields in the petro￾leum industry. Xu and Sepehrnoori (2019) have extended the EDFM method to the corner point
model. To list a few of such applications, sophisticated and dynamic behavior of fracture mechan￾ism can be extensively researched using the EDFM (Tavassoli et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019). Investiga￾tions of well interference and stress interference can be easily performed using the EDFM (Yu et al.
2017; Pei et al. 2020). Novel fishbone technology can also be readily captured by the EDFM method
(Cavalcante Filho et al. 2015). Traditional/new fracture diagnostic tools, such as microseismic and
distributed sensing, can also be cross-validated (Shakiba and Sepehrnoori 2015; Sun et al. 2020).
Through various studies, the EDFM approach has been shown to be a very robust tool for compre￾hensive fracture analysis.
In this chapter, the superior EDFM technology is utilized to study the effect of sophisticatedly
orientated natural fractures on horizontal well performance. In addition, an innovative fracture
connectivity detection tool formulated by Leines-Artieda (2020) is also used to help explore the rela￾tionship between natural fracture connectivity with well performance. Although many works
regarding natural fractures have been carried out, most of them focus on 2D-oriented and simpli￾fied natural fractures with limited numbers. Moreover, nobody systematically researched different
13.3 Embedded Discrete Fracture Model 285aspects of natural fractures (such as dip, azimuth, length, numbers, etc.). The work of Yu et al.
(2019), as shown in Figure 13.6, has initiated the goal to investigate these details of natural fracture
network systematically and holistically on the well performance.
13.4 EDFM Verification
Before utilizing EDFM to study the effect of natural fractures on the well performance, a verification
of EDFM with traditional numerical fracture modeling method, i.e. LGR, is carried out. The reservoir
model considered is based on petrophysical data provided for a real field, with vertical porosity

and 17.4 m in z direction. Number of grid blocks in each of these directions are 125, 120, and 4, respec￾tively. The depth of the reservoir top is situated around 3350 m. The reservoir pressure is 85 mega￾Pascal (MPa), and reservoir temperature is 150 C. Matrix permeability is 50 nano-Darcy (nD),
and initial water saturation is set to be equal to residual water saturation, i.e. 0.3. Specific gas gravity
is 0.677, and water compressibility is 6.18 × 10−7 kPa−1
. The Langmuir isotherm gas adsorption is
also modeled by considering a Langmuir volume of 0.002 m3
/kg, a Langmuir inverse pressure of
0.00029 kPa−1
, and a bulk density of 3560 kg/m3 for shale. A comprehensive list of reservoir proper￾ties is tabulated in Table 13.1.
There is a single horizontal well with 1980 m depth, 100 hydraulic fractures, and a cluster spacing
of 20 m in the verification model. For the fracture geometry, uniform half-lengths of 70 m, uniform
heights of 5 m, and apertures of 0.1 m are designed. Fracture conductivity and fracture water sat￾uration are 10 milliDarcies-times-meter (mD-m) and 0.3, respectively. A well constraint of constant
minimum bottom-hole pressure of 20 MPa is set up. The fracture closure coefficient, which modi￾fies the equivalent fracture conductivity as a function of pressure, is 0.0494. The model of the frac￾ture closure phenomenon is given by Eq. (13.5)

A complete table of fracture properties for the verification model is shown in Table 13.2.
The compaction curve associated with the 0.0494 fracture closure coefficient is given in
Figure 13.7. A severe compaction is designed to mimic the aggravated fracture closure phenomenon
typically observed in this field. The relative permeability curves for water phase and gas phase are
plotted in Figure 13.8. The system is gas (hydrocarbon)-wet, which is typically observed in shale
reservoirs. Figure 13.9 shows the 2D top view and 3D view for the verification model. The well
is situated in the middle of the reservoir.
Figure 13.10 shows a comparison of simulation results using the traditional LGR and novel
EDFM methods. Both gas flow rate and cumulative gas production plots show that the differences
between the two methods are negligible meaning that the EDFM can be accurately and reliably
used to further study the effect of natural fractures on the well performance. We should point
out that only four processing cores were employed in the verification simulation and the rest of
all studies. The CPU time for the EDFM takes about 32 seconds, and 35 seconds for the LGR

pronounced as natural fractures are included, and the EDFM does not require cumbersome re￾gridding work as required by LGR, which could be highly difficult for complex natural fracture
configurations. A more complex well constraint would also magnify the efficiency of the EDFM.
13.5 Well Performance Study – Base Case
Once the verification procedure is completed, a base case scenario for studying the effect of natural
fractures on well performance is set up. The basic reservoir properties are identical to those given in
Table 13.1. However, multiple horizontal wells are placed in the reservoir model. In addition, the
fracture geometrical properties are drastically different from the verification model. Figures 13.11
and 13.12 show the 2D top view, a zoomed-in view, and the 3D view of the base case model. The
half-length and height of each of the clusters are different, but the geometries of hydraulic fractures
along one whole well are copied to the two other wells.
Statistical plots of individual cluster half-length and height are shown in Figure 13.13. As can be
observed in this figure, the half-length within stages changes drastically. This is because such com￾plex fracture geometries are linked to realistic injection rates and sand concentration observed in
the field. Moreover, the uneven distribution of fracturing fluid in each cluster within a single stage
causes the fracture to grow differentially, which is called the “heel bias effect.” However, the height
stays mostly uniform because the fracture is difficult to grow vertically due to gravity. This geometry
is mainly controlled by the stress difference between bedding layers and thus is constrained by layer
thicknesses.
Next, 20-year production-enhanced ultimate recovery (EUR) forecast for the base case reservoir
and fracture model is performed. The well is constrained by flowing bottom-hole pressure trends
typically seen from the field response, shown in Figure 13.14. The bottom-hole pressure decreased
from initial reservoir pressure of 85 to 20 MPa in the first three and half years, then it reached a
constant value afterward. The relative permeability curves and proppant compaction curve, which
simulates the fracture closure phenomenon, are the same as those used in the verification model.

the 2D pressure distribution and 3D drainage volume with hydraulic fractures after 20 years of pro￾duction. It can be seen that pressure distribution is heterogeneous both horizontally and vertically
due to variation of hydraulic fracture geometries. Furthermore, the extent of pressure drawdown
and the drainage volume is limited laterally without natural fractures. We should note that the pres￾ence of natural fractures might extend the drawdown and drainage volume significantly.

13.5 Well Performance Study – Base Case 29313.6 Effect of Natural Fracture Connectivity on Well Performance
First, the influence of natural fracture connectivity is analyzed. The connectivity is defined by the
number of natural fractures intersecting with hydraulic fractures. Parameters controlling natural
fracture discrete fracture network (DFN), such as azimuth, total number, length, set number, and
dip angle, would all affect connectivity in various degrees. The analysis is initiated with the study of
natural fracture azimuth.
13.6.1 Effect of Natural Fracture Azimuth
The effect of two different azimuths of natural fractures on well performance is examined. The
natural fracture azimuth is defined as the angle relative to the horizontal well direction (along
the x-axis). 2D and 3D views of natural fracture distribution with azimuth of 45 –55 and 90
are shown in Figures 13.16 and 13.17, respectively. The natural fracture total number, aperture,
length, height, dip angle, and conductivity are fixed at 2500, 0.01 m, 50 m, 5–10 m, 80 –90 , and
0.1 mD-m, respectively. The additional EDFM fracture cells for natural fracture azimuth of 45 –55
are 40,320, and the CPU time is 355 seconds. The additional EDFM fracture cells for natural
fracture azimuth of 90 are 33,120, and the CPU time is 298 seconds.
Comparisons of gas flow rate and cumulative gas production between two different natural frac￾ture azimuths are shown in Figure 13.18. It can be seen that natural fractures play a positive effect
on gas flow rate and well production compared to the base case without natural fractures. It should
also be noted that there are some inflection points in the gas flow rate curves, which are caused by
the flowing bottom hole pressure reaching the minimum constraint. In addition, we find that
the gas recovery after 20 years of production increases by 69% and 50% corresponding to azimuth
of 45 –55 and 90 , respectively. In other words, natural fractures that are not parallel with
hydraulic fractures can boost well productivity. The numbers of intersections between natural
and hydraulic fractures are 1236 and 45, respectively. Therefore, the azimuth is a highly sensitive
parameter affecting the intersection between natural and hydraulic fractures. Hence, with increas￾ing intersections between natural and hydraulic fractures, there are more connected fracture areas,
resulting in improved well performance.

294 13 Modeling of Fluid Flow in Complex Fracture Networks for Shale ReservoirsComparisons of pressure distribution and drainage volume, which are shown in Figures 13.19
and 13.20, can further explain the effect of natural fracture azimuth on shale gas production.
With more intersections between natural and hydraulic fractures, the drainage area of azimuth
of 45 –55 becomes larger than that of azimuth of 90 . Due to the limitation of natural fracture
length, the drainage area is enlarged mainly near the wellbore region.
13.6.2 Effect of Number of Natural Fractures
Based on the case study with azimuth of 45 –55 in Section 13.6.1, the effect of number of natural
fractures on well performance is investigated. The new number of natural fractures is 5000; the 2D
and 3D view of natural fracture distribution are shown in Figure 13.21. The natural fracture
aperture, length, height, azimuth, dip angle, and conductivity are 0.01 m, 50 m, 5–10 m,
45 –55 , 80 –90 , and 0.1 mD-m, respectively. The additional EDFM fracture cells for 5000 natural
fractures are 70,560, and the CPU time is 520 seconds.
Figure 13.22 compares the gas flow rate and cumulative gas production for different numbers of
natural fractures. It is obvious that more natural fractures can extract more gas from the shale res￾ervoir. In contrast with the base case, the gas recovery after 20 years of production increases by 69%
and 117% corresponding to the number of natural fractures 2500 and 5000, respectively. The reason
behind is that more natural fractures lead to more intersections between natural and hydraulic frac￾tures. In this case, as the number of natural fractures increases from 2500 to 5000, the number of

13.6 Effect of Natural Fracture Connectivity on Well Performance 297intersecting fractures increases from 1236 to 2535. Therefore, more natural fractures would enlarge
the connected area with hydraulic fractures resulting in higher gas recovery.
The 2D pressure distribution and 3D drainage volume with 5000 natural fractures at different
times i.e. 3 years, 10 years, and 20 years are shown in Figure 13.23. Compared to the case with
2500 natural fractures shown in Figures 13.19a and 13.20a, it is clear that increasing the number
of natural fractures mainly increases the drainage area near the wellbore region instead of the far
field region. Because of the limitation of the length of natural fractures, the gas in the far field region
could not be reached by the intersecting fractures. Therefore, there is still a considerable amount of
gas in the far-field region, and additional efforts should be made to further exploit the far-field
region resource by well placement optimization. In the next section, the effect of natural fracture
length on well performance is investigated, especially on the far-field region.
13.6.3 Effect of Natural Fracture Length
As indicated in Section 13.6.2, more natural fractures mainly help to extract gas in the near wellbore
region due to the limitation of natural fracture length, and there still remains a large amount of

performance from the far-field region is investigated. Based on the case study in Section 13.6.1 with
azimuth of 45 –55 and natural fracture length of 50 m, the length of natural fractures is extended
to 100 m; the 2D and 3D view of natural fracture distribution are shown in Figure 13.24. The natural
fracture number, aperture, height, dip angle, and conductivity are 2500, 0.01 m, 5–10 m, 80 –90 ,
and 0.1 mD-m, respectively. The additional EDFM fracture cells for natural fracture length of 100 m
are 64 800, and the CPU time is 547 seconds.
Figure 13.25 shows the simulated gas flow rate and cumulative gas production for different
lengths of natural fractures. As can be seen, more gas is extracted with increasing the natural frac￾ture length. Compared with the base case, the gas recovery after 20 years of production increases by
69% and 96% corresponding to the length of natural fractures 50 m and 100 m, respectively. The
reason for this is quite obvious: the longer natural fractures lead to more intersections between nat￾ural and hydraulic fractures. It can be explained with the help of 2D pressure distribution and 3D
drainage volume at different times i.e. 3 years, 10 years, and 20 years shown in Figure 13.26. The
production at the early stage is mainly dominated by the perforated hydraulic fractures, while the
natural fractures play a key role at the later stage, and well interference can be seen after 10 years of

300 13 Modeling of Fluid Flow in Complex Fracture Networks for Shale Reservoirsproduction. Compared to the case with natural fracture length of 50 m shown in Figures 13.18a and
13.19a, the extended length of natural fractures is indicated to increase the drainage area and vol￾ume beyond the wellbore region. Hence, the longer natural fractures would not only increase the
intersections between natural and hydraulic fractures in the near wellbore region but also increase
the drainage area and volume beyond the wellbore region. To a certain degree, proper well inter￾ference may be beneficial to gas recovery, which needs to be further studied.
13.6.4 Effect of Number of Sets of Natural Fractures
Based on the case study with natural fracture length of 100 m in Section 13.6.3, 2500 natural frac￾tures are divided into two sets, one set with azimuth of 45 –55 (shown in green) and the other one
with azimuth of 135 –145 (shown in yellow) to examine the effect of different sets of natural frac￾tures on the well performance. Each set has 1250 natural fractures perpendicular to each other.
Figure 13.27 shows the 2D and 3D views of the natural fracture distribution. The natural fracture
number, aperture, length, height, dip angle, and conductivity are 2500, 0.01 m, 100 m, 5–10 m,

fractures are the same as that of one set of natural fractures, which are 64,800, and the CPU time is
550 seconds.
Comparisons of the gas flow rate and cumulative gas production for different sets of natural frac￾tures are shown in Figure 13.28. Results show that two sets of natural fractures have higher gas
production than the case with only one set of natural fractures. Compared to the base case, the
gas recovery after 20 years of production increases by 96 and 121% from one set of natural fractures
to two sets of natural fractures. This is because two sets of natural fractures have more intersecting
fractures with hydraulic fractures than one set of natural fractures, despite the fact that the total
number of natural fractures are the same. The intersecting fracture number is 783 and 1672, respec￾tively, for one set of natural fractures and two sets of natural fractures. Once again, as the number of
intersecting fractures increases, there would be more connected fracture areas resulting in more
production.
The 2D pressure distribution and 3D drainage volume with two sets of natural fractures are dis￾played in Figure 13.29. Compared to the case with only one set of natural fractures as given in
Figure 13.26, the increase of the set of natural fractures can increase the drainage area and volume

13.6.5 Effect of Natural Fracture Dip Angle
The effect of the dip angle of natural fractures on well performance is investigated in this section.
Based on the case study with natural fracture length of 100 m in Section 13.6.3, the dip angles are
modified from 80 –90 to 10 and 45 . The 2D and 3D views of natural fracture distribution are
provided in Figures 13.30 and 13.31, respectively. The magnified view of natural fractures with three
different kinds of dip angles is shown in Figure 13.32. It should be noted that the natural fracture dip
angle is defined as the angle relative to the horizontal plane (the X–Y face). The natural fracture num￾ber, aperture, length, height, azimuth, and conductivity are 2500, 0.01 m, 100 m, 5–10 m, 45 –55 , and
0.1 mD-m, respectively. The additional EDFM fracture cells for natural fracture dip angles of 10 and
45 are, respectively, 40, 320, and 58,560, and the CPU time is 337 and 493 seconds.
Comparisons of the gas flow rate and cumulative gas production for three different kinds of nat￾ural fracture dip angles are shown in Figure 13.33. It can be seen that the gas recovery after 20 years
of production increases by 18%, 80%, and 96% corresponding to the dip angle of 10 , 45 , and 80–90 ,
respectively. The gas production of lower dip angle natural fractures (10 ) is far less than that of the
higher dip angle natural fractures (80 –90 ). However, the gas production of middle dip angle nat￾ural fractures (45 ) is close to the higher dip angle natural fractures (80 –90 ). The reason for this is
the decreased intersecting fracture number between the lower dip angle natural fractures and
hydraulic fractures. The intersecting fracture number is 319, 703, and 783 for natural fracture
dip angle of 10 , 45 , and 80–90 , respectively. Figures 13.34 and 13.35 display the pressure distri￾bution and drainage volume of natural fractures with dip angles 10 and 45 after 20 years of pro￾duction. It can be clearly seen that the drainage area and volume of lower dip angle case are less
than those of the middle dip angle case due to the less intersecting fractures between hydraulic and
natural fractures. Comparing Figures 13.34b and 13.35b with Figure 13.26 indicates that middle dip
angle (45 ) natural fractures almost have the same drainage area and volume as of the high dip

13.6 Effect of Natural Fracture Connectivity on Well Performance 305angle case since the intersecting fractures of these two cases are close. Therefore, the dip angle also
shares the same mechanism for increasing the gas recovery with the effect of azimuth, number of
natural fractures, and number of sets of natural fractures on well performance, i.e. with the increas￾ing intersecting fractures, there are more connected fracture area resulting in more production.
13.7 Effect of Natural Fracture Conductivity on Well Performance
In addition to the natural fracture connectivity, the natural fracture conductivity is also a parameter
that plays a key role in the well performance of shale reservoirs. Based on the case study with azimuth
of 45 –55 in Section 13.6.1, the fracture conductivity values are considered to be 0.001, 0.01, 1 , and
10 mD-m. The 2D and 3D views of natural fracture distribution are already given in Figures 13.16a
and 13.17a. The natural fracture number, aperture, length, height, azimuth, and dip angle are
2500, 0.01 m, 50 m, 5–10 m, 45 –55 , and 80 –90 , respectively.
Figure 13.36 compares the gas flow rate and cumulative gas production for different conductiv￾ities. Compared to the base case, the gas recovery after 20 years of production increases by 42%, 54%,
63%, 69%, and 70% corresponding to conductivities 0.001 mD-m, 0.01 mD-m, 0.1 mD-m, 1 mD-m,
and 10 mD-m, respectively. It is noticeable that gas production increases with increasing natural

306 13 Modeling of Fluid Flow in Complex Fracture Networks for Shale Reservoirsfracture conductivity. However, when the conductivity is larger than 1 mD-m, the increase in
conductivity has no influence on the well performance, which means it has reached the infinite
conductivity.
Figures 13.37 and 13.38 further compare the 2D pressure distribution and 3D drainage volume
of two different natural fracture conductivities after 20 years of production corresponding to
0.001 mD-m and 1 mD-m, respectively. Comparatively, the increase of conductivity undoubtedly
increases the drainage area and drainage volume in the near wellbore region.
The sensitivity studies in Sections 13.6 and 13.7 have shown the capability and flexibility of the
EDFM for complex natural fracture simulations. The number of cells including matrix cells, EDFM
fracture cells, and total cells for each case and the corresponding CPU time are summarized in
Table 13.3. In the DPDK model, the number of fracture cells are always equal to the number of
matrix cells. Nevertheless, the EDFM creates less fracture cells than the DPDK model in some cases,

Section 13.6.1, and natural fracture dip angle cases explained in Section 13.6.5. In other cases, such
as the 5000 natural fractures case explained in Section 13.6.2, and 100 m natural fractures length
case described in Section 13.6.3, the EDFM creates more fracture cells than the DPDK model. It is
also found that there exists a linear relationship between the additional EDFM fracture cells and the
CPU time, illustrated in Figure 13.39.
13.8 Conclusions
In this study, the method of EDFM was briefly introduced and benchmarked against the traditional
LGR method, and the effects of complex 3D natural fractures on long-term well performance were
extensively analyzed. Sensitivity on key geometry-controlling parameters, such as natural fracture
DFN azimuth, total number, length, set number, and dip angle were designed, and flow-controlling
parameter such as conductivity was also examined. On the basis of the presented case comparisons,
the following conclusions can be drawn:
1) The accuracy of the EDFM is well benchmarked with the traditional LGR method and is proven
reliable with a cumulative gas production percentage difference of 0.95% at 30 years. The EDFM
can easily deal with complex natural and hydraulic fractures without redefining the gridding
schemes of the reservoir with a complex algorithm. This advantage showcases the EDFM’s supe￾rior efficiency to fulfill multiple instances of sensitivity studies.
2) The difference of connected fractures between azimuth of 45 –55 and 90 is 27.47-fold. Dou￾bling the number of natural fractures from 2500 to 5000 increased the connected fractures num￾ber by 2.05-fold. Doubling the set of natural fractures from a single set to two sets increased the
connected fractures number by 2.14-fold. Modifying natural fractures from high dip angles
(80 –90 ) to low dip angles (10 ) decreased the connected fractures number by 0.4 times. There￾fore, the azimuth is the most sensitive parameter controlling the number of connected fractures
in this study.

13.8 Conclusions 3113) The change of azimuth angle from 90 to 45 –55 increased production by 12.7%. Increasing the
total natural fracture number from 2500 to 5000 improved production by 28.4%. Extending the
lengths of natural fractures from 50 to 100 m enlarged production by 16.0%. Doubling the set
number of natural fractures raised production by 8.2%. Reducing dip angle from 80 –90 to
10 and 45 decreased production by 40.0% and 7.8%, respectively. Therefore, the total natural
fracture number and dip angle are the two most sensitive parameters to improve well
performance.
4) Based on the drainage volume visualization results, it is concluded that the intensity of natural
fractures around the near-wellbore region and in the inter-wellbore region is the contributing
factor to the development of drainage area/volumes and enhancement of well productivity. This
implies that the degrees of overall connectivity may not directly impact well performance but
rather the regional connectivity (near/inter-wellbore connectivity).
5) As the conductivity of natural fractures reached approximately 1 mD-m, or one-tenth of the con￾ductivity of hydraulic fracture (10 mD-m), the infinite conductivity situation was reached mean￾ing further increments of conductivity would not affect well productivity.
6) The accurate and reliable EDFM have proven its practicality in analyzing complex fracture geo￾metries and DFN network, and seamless coupling between numerical fracture modeling and
numerical flow modeling. This application of EDFM unlocks the possibility of further investi￾gate more in-depth fracture-flow mechanism in the future.
7) The number of additional EDFM fracture cells can be either more or less than the additional
fracture cells produced by DPDK model due to different degrees of fracture complexity. How￾ever, the CPU time only increases linearly with the number of fracture cells for EDFM method,
given the total matrix cell number and other matrix properties are kept the same.

14.1 Introduction
During hydrocarbon production from unconventional reservoirs, the largest resistance to
hydrocarbon flow occurs in rock matrix that, at the same time, has the largest storage capacity
for hydrocarbon. This is mainly because the matrix has small pore sizes and thus extremely low
permeability on the order of 10–100 nD, while both natural and hydraulic fractures have signifi￾cantly higher permeabilities. Consequently, the hydrocarbon production rate, to a large extent,
is controlled by matrix permeability among several other factors (e.g. Carratu et al. 2014; Liu
et al. 2016).
Reservoir matrix permeability can be measured or estimated in laboratory or field. The com￾monly used laboratory approach is the pressure pulse decay method that estimates permeability
from a core plug (with a typical size being approximately 1 in.) by analyzing pressure data generated
by transient gas flow through the plug. The laboratory results show that shale matrix permeability is
a strong function of both stress and pore pressure because of the shale stress sensitivity and impacts
of Knudsen diffusion and slippage flow (Sone and Zoback 2013). The upscaling of permeability
obtained from laboratory measurements is generally needed for large-scale reservoir simulations
because of the subsurface heterogeneity (Liu et al. 2018).
Rate transient analysis (RTA) is widely used to estimate field-scale reservoir permeability using
early production data. RTA employs closed-form relationships between the production rate, time,
and related reservoir flow parameters including matrix permeability (that is derived from analyt￾ical solutions to fluid flow in reservoirs) to fit the production data. Although numerical modeling
is more flexible, and thus can avoid certain approximations, RTA is almost exclusively based on
analytical solutions because of its ability to diagnose different flow regimes and provide useful
physical insight into parameter estimation, as well as its ease of implementation in practical
applications.
The majority of analytical solutions used in the RTA are for linear flow equations in which per￾meability is constant, as reviewed by Bello (2009). This is because analytical solutions to linear fluid
flow equations can be relatively easily derived using the Laplace transform and other mathematical
schemes. There is a consensus in the unconventional-reservoir engineering community that the
early production process in an unconventional reservoir is mainly characterized by the so-called
linear flow regime in which hydrocarbon production is controlled by one-dimensional flow from

domain because the penetration depth from the hydraulic fracture, owing to the production proc￾ess, is much smaller than the hydraulic fracture spacing. It is important to distinguish between lin￾ear flow equation and linear flow regime herein. The linear flow regime can correspond to both
linear and nonlinear governing equations for fluid flow process in it. In this study, we focus on
the linear flow regime.
In a stress-sensitive unconventional reservoir, pore pressure is a function of both time and loca￾tion as a result of pore pressure evolution during production. If the total stress in a reservoir is
approximated by the overburden that is a constant, the effective stress, or the total stress minus
pore pressure, can be fully characterized by pore pressure variations. In this case, reservoir perme￾ability would not be constant, but a strong function of time and location because pore pressure is a
function of such factors. Accordingly, the fluid flow equation becomes highly nonlinear. The RTA,
based on analytical solutions to linear flow equations in which permeability is treated as a constant
parameter, is not applicable any longer.
Effort has been made to develop RTA methods for nonlinear flow equations within the linear
flow regime. Two general approaches have been proposed. The first approach is to linearize the
nonlinear flow equation using transformed variables such as pseudo pressure and pseudo time
(e.g. Nobakht and Clarkson 2012; Tobatabaie et al. 2017). After linearization, the governing equa￾tion for flow with transformed variables still contains some coefficients that depend on pore pres￾sure. As an approximation, the coefficients are evaluated at a typical pore pressure, such as the
average pore pressure in the region of influence resulting from production, and then treated as con￾stants in developing analytical solutions (e.g. Nobakht and Clarkson 2012; Tobatabaie et al. 2017).
In other words, this approach ignores the fact that the pore pressure-dependent coefficients are
functions of location.
The second approach directly uses the closed-form relationships among production rate, pseudo
pressure, production time, and reservoir parameters that are obtained from analytical solutions to
the linear flow equation corresponding to constant permeability. Then, the effects of the nonline￾arity are accounted for by introducing a correction factor into the above closed-form relationships.
The correction factor was developed empirically based on numerical simulation results (Ibrahim
and Wattenbarger 2006) or using exact solutions to the nonlinear flow equation for some specific
form of pressure-dependent coefficients in the equation (Qanbari and Clarkson 2013). Both
approaches are important steps to addressing the nonlinearity effects and have been shown to
be useful in practical applications (Ibrahim and Wattenbarger 2006; Nobakht and Clarkson
2012; Clarkson et al. 2013; Qanbari and Clarkson 2013; Tobatabaie et al. 2017; Johnson and
Jamiolahmady 2018). While considerable progress has been made in developing the RTA meth￾odologies based on solutions to the nonlinear flow equation, it is desirable to further investigate
such an important issue.
This chapter presents a new closed-form relationship among the production rate, time, and res￾ervoir properties under both constant and variable pressure drawdown conditions in production
well for stress-sensitive unconventional reservoirs. The relationship of this kind is critical for
the RTA because it can be used for estimating reservoir permeability with production rate as a func￾tion of time. We develop such a closed-form relationship based on an exact integral solution to the
one-dimensional nonlinear flow equation and an approximation of the ratio of fluid flux to that at
the interface between the reservoir and hydraulic fracture. The relationship is compared with
numerical experimental results for validation purposes. The equivalent state approximation
(ESA) approach is then used to extend the analytical solution of production rate from the constant
pressure drawdown condition to the more general variable drawdown condition.
316 14 A Closed-Form Relationship for Production Rate in Stress-Sensitive Unconventional Reservoirs14.2 Production Rate as a Function of Time in the Linear Flow
Regime Under the Constant Pressure Drawdown Condition
It is well documented in the literature that in the linear flow regime with a constant pressure draw￾down, the cumulative production rate is proportional to the square root of production time for the
linear flow equation with a constant permeability (e.g. Bello 2009). In fact, for stress-sensitive
unconventional reservoirs that correspond to nonlinear flow equations, the above relationship
between the production rate and time still holds (e.g. Qanbari and Clarkson 2013). For complete￾ness, this section provides a detailed derivation of the relationship for nonlinear flow equations. It
also serves as the starting point for developing the relationship among the production rate, time,
and reservoir properties in the next section.
As previously indicated, in the linear flow regime, production is controlled by one-dimensional
flow from the rock matrix to hydraulic fractures. Thus, this study focuses on solving the one￾dimensional flow equation under appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The governing
(mass balance) equation for one-dimensional fluid flow is given by
∂ ρφ
∂t = ∂
∂x
kρ
μ
∂p
∂x
14 1
where t is the time, x is the spatial coordinate with zero value at the interface between rock matrix
and hydraulic fracture, k is the permeability that is a function of pressure, μ, ρ, and p are the fluid
viscosity, density, and pressure, respectively, and φ is the porosity.
Letting
m = ρφ 14 2
and considering that m is only a function of pore pressure under the isothermal conditions, we can
rewrite Eq. (14.1) as
∂m
∂t = ∂
∂x
D
∂m
∂x
14 3
where D is so-called “diffusivity” and defined as follows:
D = kρ
μ
dp
dm
14 4
Since D is a function of m (or p), Eq. (14.3) is nonlinear. If D is constant, Eq. (14.3) becomes linear.
In the linear flow regime, the flow can be considered to occur in an infinitely long domain, and
Eq. (14.3) is subject to the following boundary and initial conditions:
m x, t = mi x ≥ 0, t = 0
m x, t = m0 x = 0, t > 0 14 5
m x, t = mi x ∞ , t > 0
Using the Boltzmann transformation
λ = xt − 1

we can transform Eq. (14.5) into
m λ = mi λ ∞

Note that Eq. (14.8) can be much more easily solved than Eq. (14.1), although they are equivalent.
This is because Eq. (14.8) is an ordinary differential equation with λ as the only independent
variable.
Based on the fluid mass balance, we can determine the cumulative fluid flow rate Q(t) getting out
of the reservoir (at x = 0) as:
Q t = Ar

where Ar is the surface area of hydraulic fracture. In the above equation, the integration by parts
is used. Note that the term Ar(m – mi) x is equal to zero for both x = 0 and x = ∞ (or m = mi).
Combining Eqs. (14.6 and 14.9) gives
Q t = At1 2 14 10
where A is a constant and given by
A = Ar
m0
mi
λdm 14 11
As indicated by Eqs. (14.10 and 14.11), the cumulative flow rate is still proportional to the square
root of time in the linear flow regime with a constant pressure drawdown even when the flow equa￾tion is highly nonlinear. Eq. (14.10) can be used for fitting the early production data in order to
estimate the parameter A. As long as the relationship between A and permeability is known, we
can determine the field-scale permeability for the reservoir under consideration.
14.3 An Approximate Relationship Between Parameter A and
Stress-Dependent Permeability
This section focuses on the development of the relationship between the parameter A in Eq. (14.10)
and the stress-dependent permeability by modifying the method of McWhorter and Sunada (1990)
used for developing an integral solution to one-dimensional two-phase flow. Mathematically, there
is a considerable similarity between the governing equation for two-phase flow in rigid porous
media and the governing equations for single-phase fluid flow in stress (or pore pressure)-sensitive
porous media. This work is devoted to the single-phase fluid flow although the obtained results can
be extended to multiphase fluid flow as well.
To derive the relationship between the parameter A and stress-dependent permeability, we first
follow McWhorter and Sunada (1990) to solve the nonlinear flow equation for a flux ratio, F,
defined by
F = q
q0

In the derivation of the above equation, the derivatives with respect to x and t in Eq. (14.15) need to
be converted to the derivatives with respect to λ. Based on Darcy’s law, the mass flux q can be
expressed as
q = − kρ

Then, we solve the above equation for F. Two direct integrations of Eq. (14.19) give

By the definition of F (Eq. (14.12)) and noting that q = 0 at x ∞, we have

14.3 An Approximate Relationship Between Parameter A and Stress-Dependent Permeability 319F = 0 x ∞ or m = mi 14 23b
From these boundary conditions, the constants in Eq. (14.20) can be determined as

C2 = G mi − 1 − G mi

It is the exact integral solution to the nonlinear flow Eq. (14.20). In order to get a unique solution to
the above equation, we need to know the relationship between F and a.
Equation (14.16) leads to
dF
dm

Applying this condition to Eq. (14.26) and noting that (dG/dm) = 0 for m = m0 (from Eq. 14.21),
we obtain (from Eq. 14.26) that G(mi) = 1, which, based on Eq. (14.22), is equivalent to
a2 = 2

This changes Eq. (14.26) to

F can be uniquely determined from Eqs. (14.28 and 14.29) for a given m via an iteration method. For
initial guesses of a and F(m), Eq. (14.29) is solved for F as a function of m. With the obtained F(m),
an updated a is determined from Eq. (14.28). After that, the updated a and F(m) are used in
Eq. (14.29) to determine the new F. The above iteration procedure continues until F does not
change significantly between two adjacent iterations for a given m.
After F(m) is obtained, the relationship between parameter A and pore pressure-dependent
permeability (included in D) will be given by Eq. (14.28). Inserting Eqs. (14.2 and 14.14) into
Eq. (14.28) yields

where p0 is the pressure at x = 0 (or the interface between hydraulic fracture and matrix), pi is the

The application of Eqs. (14.30 or 14.32) is not convenient in practice because F needs to be deter￾mined through iterations. This work will construct an approximate relation between F and p such
that the iterations are not needed. The constructed relationship needs to satisfy the conditions
defined in Eqs. (14.23 and 14.27) that still hold when m is replaced by p. These conditions are
F = 0 for p = 0 and F = 1 for p = 1. The simplest function satisfying those conditions is
F = p 2 − p 14 34
Obviously, there are many other mathematical functions satisfying the conditions defined in
Eqs. (14.23 and 14.27). We chose Eq. (14.34) mainly because it is simple and behaves well math￾ematically. The accuracy of this approximation will be evaluated in the next section.
Inserting Eq. (14.34) into Eq. (14.32) gives the following closed-form relationship between A and
stress or pore-pressure dependent permeability:
A = Ar pi − p0 2

14 35
The integration in the above equation can be interpreted as a weighting average of Ctkρ/μ for the
pressure range between the bottom-hole pressure in a production well (p0) and the initial reservoir
pore pressure (pi). A large p(corresponding to a location close to the hydraulic fracture surface) will
give a relatively large 1 2 − p and therefore a relatively large weight. In other words, Ctkρ/μ (espe￾cially permeability k that is generally more pore-pressure sensitive than any of Ct, ρ, and μ) from
locations near the hydraulic fracture surface plays a more important role in determining A than that
at a location away from the fracture surface. This is expected because the production rate is more
sensitive to reservoir permeability near the hydraulic fracture. Finally, it is important to emphasize
that Eq. (14.35) is determined based on Eq. (14.13) obtained for a constant pressure drawdown.
Thus, Eq. (14.35) is applicable to that case only.
14.4 Evaluation of the Relationship Between Parameter A and
Stress-Dependent Permeability
This section is devoted to evaluating Eq. (14.35). To do so, we first compare Eq. (14.35) with an exact
result obtained when the one-dimensional flow equation is linear. Note that Eq. (14.35) was devel￾oped for the nonlinear flow equation including the linear equation as its special case. Thus,
Eq. (14.35) is applicable to the linear flow equation as well.
When Ct and kρ/μ are constants, the flow equation that is linear and under the constant pressure
drawdown condition has the exact solution to the fluid flux at the interface between hydraulic frac￾ture and rock matrix as (Crank 1975; Bello 2009).

14 38
The ratio of A value obtained from Eq. (14.35) to that obtained from Eq. (14.36) is ( πln2/2) ≈ 1.04.
Thus Eq. (14.38) is a very good approximation of the exact solution given in Eq. (14.37). To ensure
that Eq. (14.35) reduces to Eq. (14.37) when the flow equation becomes linear, we multiply
Eq. (14.35) by a correction factor close to one ((2/πln2)1/2) such that the modified Eq. (14.35)
becomes

Equation (14.39) is our final relationship between A and the related parameters.
While we have demonstrated that Eq. (14.39) (or Eq. (14.35)) is practically identical to the exact
solution to the fluid flux for the linear flow equation, we next examine the validity of Eq. (14.39) for
the more general and nonlinear flow condition. However, a general and closed-form analytical
solution to the nonlinear flow equation does not exist, which is the major motivation for developing
the approximate relationship given in Eq. (14.39). Numerical modeling is then used for examining
the validation of Eq. (14.39) in the rest of this section.
The implicit finite difference method is used to numerically solve the one-dimensional nonlin￾ear partial differential equation for fluid flow (Eq. 14.1). The one-dimensional flow process is
schematically demonstrated in Figure 14.1. While the details of the numerical model were pub￾lished previously (Liu et al. 2019), we briefly discuss it here. The boundary and initial conditions
used in the numerical simulations are consistent with those used in the development of

322 14 A Closed-Form Relationship for Production Rate in Stress-Sensitive Unconventional ReservoirsEq. (14.39). In other words, initial pore pressure (pi) is uniform along the rock column, and the
pore pressure at x = 0 changes to p0 and does not vary with time. The length of the one￾dimensional rock column (l) is large such that the pore pressure at x = l does not change during
the simulation, which ensures that the simulated flow is in the linear flow regime. In this study,
we consider natural gas to be pure CH4, which will not impact our evaluation results that depend
on the degree of nonlinearity of the flow equation rather than specific fluids. The gas compress￾ibility factor is calculated with the Peng-Robinson equation (Starling and Savidge 1992). The gas
viscosity can then be calculated as a function of gas density and temperature (Selim and Sloan
1989). The numerical code was validated by comparing its simulation results with an analytical
solution to the one-dimensional diffusion problem; they were found to be essentially identical
(Liu et al. 2019). Note that for the gas flow equation with constant fluid and rock properties,
the equation is mathematically equivalent to the well-known mass diffusion equation with a con￾stant diffusion coefficient that has analytical solutions.
For stress-sensitive unconventional reservoirs, the reservoir permeability is a strong function of
pore pressure. Following previous studies (e.g. Bhandari et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2015; Liu 2017), we
express the pore pressure dependence of permeability in an exponential function form
k = ki exp α p − pi 14 40
where ki is the reservoir permeability under the initial reservoir pressure and α is the pressure￾sensitivity factor for permeability. A larger α value corresponds to a higher degree of permeability
sensitivity due to the change in pore pressure. From Eq. (14.40), α is expressed as
α = 1
k
dk
dp
14 41
Thus, the physical meaning of the pressure-sensitive factor α can be interpreted as the relative
change in permeability for a unit change in pore pressure. Our numerical simulations focus on rel￾atively large pore pressures and thus the effects of diffusion/slippage flow on permeability can be
ignored (Liu et al. 2019). Furthermore, the fundamentals regarding the exponential relationship
between permeability and pore pressure (or effective stress) can be found in Liu (2017).
The numerical simulations were performed for pi = 8000 psi and 4000 psi, respectively, and for
different pressure drawdowns at the inlet of the one-dimensional flow domain. The temperature in
the domain was 190 F, and permeability was 100 nD. The values for pressure-sensitivity factor (α)
for permeability ranged from 4.0 × 10−5
/psi to 1.0 × 10−3
/psi. This covers the typical α values for
shale reservoirs that are generally on the order of 1.0 × 10−4
/psi (e.g. Bhandari et al. 2015). The
simulated cumulative gas mass production rates are fitted to obtain A values. In the simulations,
we set the cross-sectional area (Ar) to be equal to one.
As previously stated, the key assumption in the derivation of the relationship for parameter A
(Eq. (14.39)) is the connection between flux ratio (F) and normalized pressure (p given in
Eq. (14.34). Figure 14.2 presents the comparison of the simulated flux ratio F with the analytical
one (Eq. (14.34)) against the normalized pressure p for pi = 8000 psi, pressure drawdown pi −
p0 = 1000 psi, and α = 4 × 10−4
/psi. As can be seen, they match fairly well. Figure 14.3 compares
the simulated cumulative production rate with the analytical one as a function of time for the same
case shown in Figure 14.2. The analytical curve determined from the closed-form relationship
(Eq. (14.39)) lays on top of the simulation curve, indicating that Eq. (14.39) gives very accurate
results. However, Eq. (14.34) exhibits certain errors as demonstrated in Figure 14.2. This is largely
because Eq. (14.34) is in the integral form that is not very sensitive to the small error in F(p).
14.4 Evaluation of the Relationship Between Parameter A and Stress-Dependent Permeability 323To further investigate the accuracy of the closed-form relationship given in Eq. (14.39), we define
the relative error of parameter A determined from Eq. (14.39) by
δ = A − Anum
Anum
14 42
where Anum is the A value determined from the simulations and considered to be the true value
here. Tables 14.1 and 14.2 show the relative errors determined for the parameter A for simulation
cases where pi = 8000 psi and 4000 psi, respectively, and for different pressure drawdowns and pore
pressure sensitivity factors. Clearly, a greater pressure drawdown and/or a greater pore pressure

the nonlinearity of the flow Eq. (14.3) results from D only. For a constant D (corresponding to a
linear problem), Mn is zero. A greater Mn corresponds to a higher degree of nonlinearity and thus
to a greater relative error in the estimation of parameter A from Eq. (14.39) that gives accurate
results for linear problems.
Figure 14.4 shows the relative error as a function of Mn from the data given in Tables 14.1 and

326 14 A Closed-Form Relationship for Production Rate in Stress-Sensitive Unconventional ReservoirsWhen Mn is beyond the above range, the iteration method, discussed in the above section, should be
used to accurately determine the value of A. Since our focus here is on the closed-form relationship
between the parameter A and stress-dependent permeability, further discussion of the iteration
method is beyond the scope of this chapter.
14.5 Equivalent State Approximation for the Variable Pressure
Drawdown Conditions
All the above discussions were relevant to the case where the pressure drawdown is constant. In
practice, the pressure drawdown often varies with time. In this case, the relation of the production
rate for the constant pressure drawdown cannot be directly applied and needs to be modified. Liu
et al. (2022) proposed a principle called ESA (equivalent state approximation) to develop approx￾imate solutions to fluid flow in porous media with variable boundary conditions from those with
constant boundary conditions.
ESA includes three steps. Firstly, reformulate the solution for the constant boundary conditions
such that it is expressed without explicitly using time as a variable. Secondly, assume the mathe￾matical form of the reformulated solution to be applicable to variable boundary conditions as well.
Thirdly, acquire the final solution by incorporating the variable boundary condition into the result
obtained from the second step. It is important to note that the practical usefulness of the ESA
approach has already been independently demonstrated in several different areas, although the
ESA has not been clearly and systematically defined in those studies. For example, Warrick
et al. (2005) reported that a solution to water infiltration into soils with variable water ponding
depth on the soil surface can be adequately approximated by the solution with a constant ponding
depth for the same cumulative infiltration depth of water. Blasingame et al. (1991) demonstrated
that the production rate as a function of time for the variable drawdown can be well approximated
by that with a constant pressure drawdown as long as the time in the latter case is represented with
so-called materials balance time or the ratio of cumulative production to the production rate. Both
results can be easily obtained by the ESA principle. Next, we demonstrate how to use ESA to obtain
an approximate relation between production rate and time for a variable pressure drawdown case.
To apply ESA, we first need to reformulate the result for the constant pressure drawdown.
Eq. (14.13) can be rewritten as:
q0Ar = dQ
dt = 1
2
At − 1 2 14 45
Eliminating time by combining Eqs. (14.15 and 14.45) yields
Qq0Ar = 1
2
A2 14 46
Clearly, the above equation does not explicitly include time t as a variable. According to the ESA,
the equation, although derived for the constant pressure drawdown case, can approximately hold
for the variable pressure drawdown case. While A is still expressed by Eq. (14.39) in the latter case, it
is not constant any longer, but a function of the bottom hole pressure in the production well, p0,
which is a temporal variable.
Finally, we use Eq. (14.46) to derive the production rate as a function of time by incorporating the
variable pressure drawdown. Inserting q0Ar = (dQ/dt) into Eq. (14.46) gives
dQ2
dt = A2 14 47
14.5 Equivalent State Approximation for the Variable Pressure Drawdown Conditions 327Then, we obtain the cumulative production as

Liu et al. (2022) demonstrated that the above equation gives acceptable results for some problems of
practical interest, while more investigations are still needed to determine the general validity range
of the ESA.
14.6 Discussions
For stress-sensitive unconventional reservoirs, the conventional RTA needs to be modified or
improved, because in these reservoirs, as previously discussed, the flow equation may become
highly nonlinear, while the conventional RTA is mainly based on solutions to linear flow equations.
Several efforts have been made to deal with this challenging issue (e.g. Ibrahim and Wattenbarger
2006; Nobakht and Clarkson 2012; Clarkson et al. 2013; Qanbari and Clarkson 2013; Tobatabaie
et al. 2017; Johnson and Jamiolahmady 2018). The major difference between our method and
the previous ones is that we directly solve the nonlinear flow equation.
The key assumption to derive the relationship for the parameter A (Eq. (14.39)) is the connection
between the flux ratio (F) and normalized pressure (p . Eq. (14.34) likely gives the simplest form of
the relationship between F and p. There is considerable room to improve the current work with
different ways to deal with this assumption. Firstly, it is possible that other mathematical forms
of the relationship may give more accurate results, while the current treatment gives satisfactory
results under certain conditions. Secondly, a correction factor may also be introduced in Eq. (14.39)
for Mn > 0.45 to extend the applicable range of the current work. As demonstrated in Figure 14.4,
the accuracy of Eq. (14.39) is mainly determined by the parameter Mn that is a measure of the non￾linearity. Thus, the correction factor should be fully characterized by Mn for practical applications.
Thirdly, we can also develop an efficient iteration method to solve Eqs. (14.28 and 14.29) for param￾eter A such that we can accurately estimate A without using any assumption regarding the rela￾tionship between F and p. However, the closed-form relationships are always preferred because
they are relatively easy to use and can provide useful physical insights. We will leave all these
options to future studies.
Our closed-form relationship for the production rate in stress-sensitive unconventional reservoirs
(Eqs. 14.10 and 14.39) can be easily used with the production data from the linear flow regime to
estimate reservoir permeability under ambient conditions (ki in Eq. 14.40) as long as we know the
stress sensitivity parameter α. Liu et al. (2018) theoretically demonstrated that the large-scale α for a
heterogeneous reservoir is simply the average of its small-scale (or core scale) values. It is worth
noting that applying the conventional RTA to a stress-sensitive reservoir would underestimate
the reservoir permeability under the ambient condition (ki), as explained below. The conventional
RTA assumes a constant permeability during production and, thus, estimates an effective perme￾ability that is a weighted average of permeability in the reservoir zone influenced by the production.
Since permeability values within the zone are always smaller than the permeability under the ambi￾ent condition owing to the stress effect, the latter is always larger than the estimated effective
permeability.
328 14 A Closed-Form Relationship for Production Rate in Stress-Sensitive Unconventional ReservoirsThe closed-form relationship for production rate in stress-sensitive unconventional reservoirs
(Eqs. 14.10 and 14.39) was developed for single-phase flow and can be extended to multiphase flow
conditions by ignoring the capillary pressures between different phases. This is because the govern￾ing partial differential equation of multiphase flow in terms of total mass for all the phases is anal￾ogous to Eq. (14.3). In this case, both m and D in Eq. (14.3) need to include contributions from all
the phases. If assuming no changes in the composition of different phases, we then can approxi￾mately consider m and D to be dependent on pore pressure only. Thus, the mathematical derivation
procedure discussed in this work can still apply. More details of this extension can be found in the
literature (e.g. Saleh and Stewart 1992; Heidari and Gerami 2011; Behmanesh et al. 2017).
14.7 Concluding Remarks
In this study, we developed a relationship linking the production rate to reservoir and fluid proper￾ties as well as time for the one-dimensional flow process in a stress-sensitive reservoir. This rela￾tionship is the key element of the RTA for estimating field-scale permeability based on early
production data from an unconventional reservoir. Our approach provides a new method to incor￾porate the effects of stress sensitivity of permeability into the RTA framework.
We presented an exact integral solution to the one-dimensional and nonlinear flow equation
for single-phase fluid flow in the linear flow regime. An approximate and closed-form relationship
for the production was then obtained by introducing an approximate relationship between the fluid
flux ratio and a normalized pressure to the integral solution. The closed-form relationship was
demonstrated to return results very close to the exact results when the flow equation becomes lin￾ear. Numerical simulations are performed to further validate our relationship for different initial
reservoir pressures, pressure drawdowns, and pressure sensitivity factors for permeability. Satisfac￾tory comparisons between analytical and numerical results are achieved in most cases under con￾sideration. The validity range of the developed relationship among production rate, reservoir and
fluid properties, and time is also provided in terms of a measure of the nonlinearity. Room to further
improve this work has been discussed. The ESA approach is used to extend the analytical solution
of production rate from the constant pressure drawdown condition to the variable drawdown
condition.

15.1 Introduction
The oil and gas industry has explored different ways to produce oil and gas from shales for several
decades (Glaser et al. 2013). However, the production became economic only when the horizontal
drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing were applied, especially after the successful develop￾ment of the Barnett and Haynesville shales in the United States. In addition to the available tech￾nologies of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal-well drilling, the identification of so-called sweet
spot has played an important role in the successful development. The sweet spot referrers to loca￾tions of shale formations that are favorable for economic production.
There are many countries where unconventional resources have not been characterized and
developed mainly because of the lack of technology and infrastructure that allow for exploration
and characterization in the known territory. The first step to develop such resources is to learn from
the success in other countries by case studies and adapt them to each situation. Following this
premise, it is pertinent to develop a practical method to identify sweet spots in shale formations
with available data over there (Liu and Wang 2016). Thus, this chapter will briefly review the cur￾rent available methods for sweet spot identification.
The generic term “shale” refers to a wide range of fine-grained, low-permeability lithologies,
including fine-grained carbonates, clay-rich shales, and mudstones (Zou et al. 2012). The identifi￾cation of sweet spot relies on the reliable characterization of shale properties related to hydrocarbon
in place, hydrocarbon flow process, and the easiness of hydraulic fracturing. They include thick￾ness, thermal maturity, lithology, porosity, natural fractures, formation depth, rock traceability,
kerogen content, permeability, hydrocarbon fluid properties, and rock mechanical properties
(Kinley et al. 2008; Glaser et al. 2013). A number of researchers have developed methods for iden￾tifying the sweet spot based on some of the above-mentioned data types obtained from different
sources such as seismic survey and well logs. Sweet spot identification is essentially a part of the
reservoir characterization, although the sweet spot may be further refined with more data available
during the field development process after the characterization.
The objective of this chapter is to review the currently available methods of sweet spot identifi￾cation in unconventional or shale reservoirs and to identify the related challenges and gaps to guide
further research activities in the area.

This section briefly discusses the reservoir characterization that plays a vital role in oil-field devel￾opment, reserves estimation, crude oil production, reservoir development, and management, while
more information on the reservoir characterization and the associated activities generally con￾ducted in the oil and gas industry is available in the literature (e.g. Chopra and Michelena 2011;
Varga and Wellmann 2016; Al-Amri et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2015; Abdel-Fattah et al. 2020). As pre￾viously indicated, sweet spot identification is essentially a part of the reservoir characterization.
Sweet spot locations are crucial for placing the wells on the oil and gas fields.
Reservoir characterization involves estimating and predicting reservoir properties such as rock
permeability, porosity, water saturation, identification of lithofacies, reservoir pressure, and tem￾perature (Chaki et al. 2015). A shale formation can be separated into individual layers that have
different minerals (such as kaolinite, quartz, and dolomite) and organic material compositions
(Glaser et al. 2013). The mineral and organic compositions for each layer depend on the history
of geologic conditions through time in the area (Neal et al. 1993; Aplin et al. 1999). Consequently,
the composition differences among the layers result in different reservoir properties men￾tioned above.
During the reservoir characterization, data is collected from different sources, including core
analysis (or laboratory measurement of rock properties with core samples), wireline logging from
wells, and seismic survey. Core data is used for calibrating the well-log data and relatively accurate
understanding of the sedimentary process/history. Well-log data provides petrophysical parameter
values that are used for a quantitative lithofacies modeling to discover subsurface lithofacies
(Loucks and Ruppel 2007; Jia et al. 2016). The seismic data can be used for three-dimensional facies
modeling that maps lithofacies and improves the detection, characterization, and development
strategy for shale resources (Woo et al. 2020). Logging and seismic data can be combined to identify
the sweet spots, as will be discussed later. Geological analysis, structural interpretation, logging
evaluation, and attribute calculation constitute the prerequisites for the successful prediction of
multiple shale oil and gas sweet spots. Seismic attributes mainly include amplitude, frequency,
phase, and attenuation; during the reservoir evaluation, hundreds of attributes are generally
available.
15.3 Sweet Spot Identification
The sweet spot identification is a complex process that can vary significantly among different shale
reservoirs because each shale is unique. Giles and Tennant (2014) further classified sweet spots into
simple ones, determined by a single factor, and composite sweet spots, determined by multiple fac￾tors. Herein, we are more interested in the latter because they are more common in practical
applications.
In general, a sweet spot, a three-dimensional volume of a reservoir, should have (i) enough hydro￾carbon in place for recovery, (ii) relative easiness for the gas and/or oil recovery (e.g. relatively high
permeability) after the stimulation, and (iii) relative easiness for reservoir stimulation or hydraulic
fracturing. Some economic factors, such as the cost for transportation, may also need to be consid￾ered (Giles and Tennant 2014). Consequently, sweet spot identification includes quantifying lith￾ological formation properties and depositional characteristics such as total organic carbon (TOC),
maturity, hydrocarbon saturation, and porosity (Glaser et al. 2013; Tandon and Heidari 2018).
334 15 Sweet Spot Identification in Unconventional Shale ReservoirsSweet spots generally correspond to high brittle mineral content, high organic matter and gas
contents, and large shale thickness (Liu and Wang 2016).
Clearly, there is not a universal method applicable to all shale formations. Thus, this chapter
attempts to provide general guidance for sweet spot identification with different data types and indi￾cators by discussing several typical methods available in the literature, although overlapping exists
in these methods.
15.3.1 The Method Based on Organic, Rock and Mechanical Qualities
Aldrich and Seidle (2018) proposed a method for sweet spot identification based on so-called
organic quality (OQ), rock quality (RQ), and mechanical quality (MQ), as shown in Figure 15.1.
A sweet spot is then identified as reservoir location where all these three Qs are high and corre￾spond to the area where the three circles intersect (with high OQ, RQ, and MQ, respectively) in
Figure 15.1.
The OQ is used to characterize the ability for a shale reservoir to generate hydrocarbons. The
parameters for OQ include the TOC, maturity, kerogen type, and storage capacity. TOC represents
hydrocarbon-generation potential in a source rock. Shales are defined as organic-rich if their TOC is
greater than 2% by weight (Boyer et al. 2006). The preservation richness of organic matter depends
on the relative rates of its production, dilution, and destruction (happening in bacterial consump￾tion) (Bohacs et al. 2012). According to Aldrich and Seidle (2018), the sweet spot may have TOC
from 3 to 12% by weight (Table 15.1). Kerogen is the main source of organic matter and its type
and maturity determine the fluid types (e.g. wet gas and dry gas). The storage capacity for shale
gas includes capacity to store free gas in pore space and adsorbed gas on the kerogen surface. Sweet
spots with kerogen-rich locations generally contain large volumes of adsorbed gas and are stored on
kerogen surfaces (Boyer et al. 2006; Pan et al. 2016). However, the adsorbed gas cannot be easily
produced unless the bottom hole pressure is very low because only at very low pore pressures a
significant amount of absorbed gas can be released from the kerogen surface and become part
of free gas in pore space during the production.
The RQ characterizes the ability for a shale reservoir to store and transport hydrocarbon. The
parameters for RQ mainly include formation thickness, porosity, and permeability. For a produc￾tion well, a larger formation thickness is expected to correspond to a larger amount of hydrocarbon
in place and likely to larger hydraulic fracture height and thus a potentially larger fracture surface
area for the production. According to Aldrich and Seidle (2018), the thickness of the producing zone
larger than 100 ft is preferred for identifying the sweet spots (Table 15.1). High matrix porosity

15.3 Sweet Spot Identification 335contains a significant amount of free hydrocarbons and allows for a rapid payout of a horizontal
well (Glaser et al. 2013). Aldrich and Seidle (2018) proposed that for sweet spots the porosity should
be larger than 8% (Table 15.1). During production, the permeability determines how easily the
hydrocarbon can be produced from the reservoir. A larger reservoir permeability generally gives
a larger production rate when all the other conditions (such as bottom hole pressure) remain
the same. Also, permeability is positively correlated with porosity for a given shale reservoir.
Aldrich and Seidle (2018) suggested that the sweet spot permeability should be 1 μD (or 0.001 mD)
or higher. The suggested permeability value seems to be on the high side, while Aldrich and Seidle
(2018) acknowledged that their suggested values for different parameters can only be served as guide￾lines, not hard rules. We believe that 100 nD may be a more realistic permeability cutoff for the sweet
spots based on our experience. Again, this is not a hard rule either. As we previously indicated, every
shale is unique in many ways.
MQ is an indicator for reservoir stimulation with hydraulic fracturing. The major purpose of
hydraulic fracturing is to enhance the reservoir contact area by artificially inducing fracture sur￾faces in the reservoir such that the hydrocarbon can be economically produced. Aldrich and Seidle
(2018) indicated that the MQ parameters may include clay content, Poisson’s ratio, Young’s mod￾ulus, and pressure regime (Table 15.1), with the first three ones being related to so-called brittleness
index (BI). Formations with high brittleness are more susceptible to fractures. During hydraulic
fracturing process, complex fracture networks that are preferable for hydrocarbon production tend
to form for brittle rocks because complex networks give relatively large fracture areas. Different BI
formulations have been proposed and recently reviewed by Mews et al. (2019), Jin et al. (2015), and
Holt et al. (2015). A larger fraction of the brittle minerals (generally including silicate minerals,
carbonate minerals, and pyrite) corresponds to a larger BI. Ductile minerals include clay and
organic matter. Thus, Aldrich and Seidle (2018) suggested that sweet spots should have clay con￾tents less than 40%, and the TOC is less than 12% by weight (Table 15.1). The Young’s modulus is
the ratio of tensile or compressive stress to the corresponding elastic strain and often served as an
indicator of rock stiffness. The Poisson’s ratio is defined as the ratio of transverse to longitudinal
strains under uniaxial stress condition. As indicated by Mews et al. (2019), a higher BI corresponds

336 15 Sweet Spot Identification in Unconventional Shale Reservoirsto a lower Poisson’s ratio and higher Young’s modulus, which has a more significant impact on BI
than Poisson’s ratio. Consequently, Aldrich and Seidle (2018) reported that as guidelines, sweet
spots may have Poisson’s ratio less than 0.2 and Young’s modulus larger than 5.0 × 106 psi
(Table 15.1). It is also preferred for a sweet spot to be in the over-pressure regime in which pore
pressure is larger than the hydrostatic pressure. This is because in the over-pressure regime, the
effective stress, defined as overburden minus pore pressure multiplied by Biot coefficient (that is
a positive constant between zero and one), is relatively small and the tensile failure (or hydraulic
fracturing) easily occurs.
It is important to note that MQ in Table 15.1 focuses on parameters related to BI. Several recent
studies indicate that BI alone cannot sufficiently characterize the fracability (or the easiness of
hydraulic fracturing), and some reservoirs with high BI values are still difficult to fracture
(Daniel et al. 2011; Bai 2016). In addition to brittleness, the fracability is related to rock structures
(e.g. mechanical weakness and natural fractures at different scales), fracture toughness, and in-situ
stresses as well. As previously indicated, these additional factors clearly determine how easily a rock
can be fractured in an unconventional reservoir.
To determine MQ and its spatial distributions in practical applications, it is desirable to have a
geomechanical model for the reservoir, including the depth profiles of vertical stress, maximum
horizontal stress, minimum horizontal stress, pore pressure, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio,
and fracture toughness, and the direction of the maximum or the minimum horizontal stress.
All the mechanical properties mentioned above, if available, should be included for determining
MQ because they may all contribute to the fracability. As an example, a workflow for geomecha￾nical modeling in a hydraulic fracturing study is presented by Rahman and Gui (2016). They also
showed that the mechanical properties, such as Young’s modulus, pore pressure, and in-situ stress,
can vary considerably with location.
15.3.2 Methods Based on Geological and Engineering Sweet Spots
A framework to identify sweet spots based on OQ, RQ and MQ was discussed in Section 15.3.1.
Comprehensive data sets from the reservoir characterization are needed for determining these
quality indicators. During the exploration phase of the unconventional resource development, well
logging and seismic data are obtained. Thus, some frameworks for sweet spot identification are
developed mainly using well logging and seismic data. One typical example is based on so-called
geological sweet spot and engineering sweet spot, which has been widely used in China (e.g. Chen
et al. 2017; He et al. 2020). The geological sweet spot essentially is the zone with high OQ and RQ.
The engineering sweet spot is the zone with high MQ that allows for the generation of desirable
hydraulic fracture networks. Final sweet spots are areas that are both geological sweet spot and
engineering sweet spot.
Chen et al. (2017) reported a workflow to identify the sweet spots for the lower Silurian Longmaxi
formation of Sichuan basin in China using interpretations of well logging and seismic data (includ￾ing gamma rays, density, P-wave, and S-wave logs) as shown in Figure 15.2.
Rock physics analysis aims at locating shale gas sweet spots and defining shale petrophysical
properties using logging data (Figure 15.2). Chen et al. (2017) used reservoir thickness, TOC content
and gas content to determine the geological sweet spot. The Longmaxi shale geological sweet spot is
defined to be zones with the thickness larger than 30 m, TOC content above 3%, and gas content
above 2.5 m3
/t. The reservoir thickness and porosity were estimated with the inverted P-velocity
and the relationships derived from rock physics analysis. The TOC content was determined based
on the density data, and gas content was calculated with multivariate regression method.
15.3 Sweet Spot Identification 337The detailed procedures to determine these parameters for the geological sweet spot are available in
Chen et al. (2017).
Chen et al. (2017) also used high rock brittleness, formation pore pressure, and abundance of
natural fracture to define the engineering sweet spot. The brittleness was estimated with rock
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio that were derived from prestack simultaneous inversion
on seismic data (Figure 15.2). The formation pressure, the driven force for hydrocarbon migration
and accumulation, was calculated with Fillippone (1982) method that assumes overpressure
to cause the interval velocity drop. They used curvature attributes derived from the seismic
data to characterize the abundance of natural fracture. Larger curvatures may correspond to more
fractures because bending stress tends to generate fractures.
To test the usefulness of their workflow, Chen et al. (2017) compared gas production rates from
six wells within the identified sweet spots and those from six wells within regions that are either
geological sweet spot or engineering sweet spots, but not both. The former rates, on average, are
about six times higher than the latter rates, convincingly demonstrating the successful application
of the workflow to the reservoir under consideration. Thus, the workflow of Chen et al. (2017) may
be used as a guidance to identifying sweet spots in other areas as well, although as previously indi￾cated, there is not a universal method applicable to different shale formations.
Most recently, He et al. (2020) further extended the method of sweet spot identification based on
the concepts of geological sweet spot and engineering sweet spot, when they identified the sweet
spots in the basin-margin transition zone of southeastern Chongqing that is also located in Sichuan
basin. Their method includes 13 key indicators and 11 auxiliary indicators (Table 15.2). In addition
to geological sweet spot and engineering sweet spot, the so-called economic sweet spot (that will be
discussed later) is also considered. The final sweet spot is the area that is geological sweet spot, engi￾neering sweet spot, and economic sweet spot as well.

15.3 Sweet Spot Identification 339For identifying the geological sweet spot, He et al. (2020) divided the indicators into two groups
related to resource evaluation and shale gas preservation conditions, respectively (Table 15.2). The
major parameters for the resource evaluation include shale thickness, organic matter abundance,
shale distribution, and resource abundance, while the thermal evolution or maturity (measured
with vitrinite reflectance value) is considered as an auxiliary indicator. A geological sweet spot
should have relatively high values of these parameters. The major parameters for the preservation
conditions were selected by considering the tectonic evolution and transformation as well as the
shale gas accumulation mechanism and conditions. They include formation pore pressure, poros￾ity, and gas content, while the auxiliary parameters are the distance to the denudation boundary,
fault conditions, distance to the open fault, specific surface area of the shale, and pore size.
A geological sweet spot should not be close to open faults and the denudation boundaries and have
relatively high values for other parameters associated with the preservation conditions. The specific
ranges of parameter values for the geological sweet spot are given in Table 15.2. Some of these
ranges are similar to those reported in Chen et al. (2017).
He et al. (2020) selected parameters for the engineering sweet spot by considering the tectonic
stress field and rock mechanical properties that are relevant to the existence of natural fractures
and generation of hydraulic fractures. The major parameters include the tectonic style, burial
depth, stress conditions, and curvature while the silicon content, clay content, BI, and Poisson’s
ratio were the auxiliary parameters (Table 15.2). As previously indicated, the curvature can serve
as an index for the density of natural fracture that generally enhances the shale gas production. The
stress difference is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stres￾ses. The small stress difference allows for generating more complex hydraulic fracture networks,
which is beneficial to the hydrocarbon production. It is particular of interest that the in-situ stress
conditions were considered by He et al. (2020), although they did not mention the details regarding
how these conditions were determined in their study. As previously indicated in Section 15.3.1, the
conditions are related to the fracability. All the auxiliary parameters are related to rock brittleness.
The specific ranges of parameter values and descriptions of nonnumerical parameters for the engi￾neering sweet spot are given in Table 15.2.
He et al. (2020) also proposed parameters for the so-called economic sweet spot for the reservoir
under their consideration, including surface conditions and water resources. An economic spot
should have a flat surface with open terrains that are convenient for transportation. It also should
be close to rivers or lakes with sufficient water supply for drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The
major purpose for He et al. (2020) to propose the concept of economic sweet spot was to minimize
the pre-drilling engineering costs. However, the parameters of the economic sweet spot could be
significantly different among different reservoirs.
The method to identify sweet spot with the concepts of geological and engineering sweet spots
and the alike have been widely used in Chinese unconventional community. We discussed the stud￾ies by Chen et al. (2017) and He et al. (2020) herein as examples including detailed lists of the related
parameters and value ranges of them (or descriptions of nonnumerical parameters) for sweet spots.
We also refer the readers to the related references cited in these two studies for more applications of
the method.
15.3.3 Methods Based on Other Quality Indicators
Sections 15.3.1 and 15.3.2 present two systematic approaches to identify sweet spots based on OQ,
RQ, and MQ, and the concepts of geologic and engineering sweet spots, respectively. Since the
importance of sweet spot identification and the varieties of shale formations in terms of geological
340 15 Sweet Spot Identification in Unconventional Shale Reservoirsconditions and data availability, many methods using different quality indicators or indices
are available in the literature, although all the methods have the same goal to identify
reservoir zones or locations that have high hydrocarbon in place and relative easiness for hydro￾carbon flow (or recovery) and reservoir stimulation. In this section, we briefly review some
selected methods that are based on other quality indicators or indices than those discussed
in Sections 15.3.1 and 15.3.2, while the similarities between them and those previously dis￾cussed may exist.
Partially motivated by the sweet spot identification, Gamero-Diaz et al. (2013) introduced a
mineralogy-based mudstone classification system called sCore that is based on a ternary diagram
with clay content, QFM (quartz, feldspar, and mica), and carbonate content as the three corner
points. Sixteen mudstone classes can be classified by sCore diagram. The system alows for deter￾mining correlations between reservoir mineralogy and parameters associated with reservoir quality
(RQ) and completion quality (CQ). The definition of the RQ in sCore is not exactly the same as that
in Table 15.1 and its parameters include rock porosity, TOC, matrix permeability, and hydrocarbon
saturation. The CQ, similar to previously discussed MQ and engineering sweet spot, is used for pre￾dicting the successful reservoir stimulation through hydraulic fracturing. Its parameters include
minimum fracture closure stress and rock brittleness. Gamero-Diaz et al. (2013) found that there
is a good correlation between mineralogy and CQ in most US shale plays, but the correlation
between mineralogy and RQ is not as strong. Nevertheless, sCore allows for identifing lithofacies
with the best RQ and CQ, or sweet spots, using minimal processing and no interpretation of the
mineralogy data (including those from logs, cores, and cuttings) and provides a common metric
for the comparison of such reservoirs worldwide.
Rojas et al. (2016) proposed a method to identify sweet spots for cases in which data are available
only for determining rock brittleness and TOC as RQ indicators. One may argue that brittleness and
TOC are the major parameters for MQ and RQ, respectively, as discussed in Section 15.3.1. Rojas
et al. (2016) provided workflows to estimate the brittleness based on either mineralogy data or rock
mechanical property data and indicated that fracturing fluid also plays an important role in deter￾mining the sweet spot. They did not provide a detailed criterion in terms of the brittleness and TOC
to determine the sweet spots, but gave parameter values of sweet spots from several formations that
may serve as references for quickly and roughly identifying the sweet spots with limited informa￾tion (Table 15.3).
Glaser et al. (2013) reported case studies to identify sweet spots using specific seismic attributes
only as quality indicators. For a Woodford Shale in the Arkoma basin of southeast Oklahoma,
United States, it was found that a seismic frequency attribute at certain frequencies corresponded
to high gas production areas. It was interpreted that the frequency anomalies likely represent areas

15.3 Sweet Spot Identification 341with increased porosity and microfracture density, and thus resulted in high production. The sim￾ilar observations were also made in some locations in the Delaware basin, United States. In a study
area of Bakken Formation, it was found that the seismic anisotropy was closely related to the first
90 days of production from the wells in the area. A larger degree of anisotropy corresponds to a
better production. One speculation is that a large degree of anisotropy generally results from highly
layered organic matter with well-connected pores and/or the existence of horizontal fractures in
reservoirs. Both help the enhancement of hydrocarbon flow and thus the production. Since the seis￾mic data is generally available for the reservoir characterization, the results from the above case
studies are practically useful. However, the relations between the sweet spots and the discussed
seismic attributes are empirical and likely reservoir specific. More studies on limitations of the
use of these seismic attributes and potential generalization to different cases are required with data
from different reservoirs.
Avanzini et al. (2016) proposed a method to identify sweet spots using so-called static RQ and
dynamic RQ as quality indicators. The former is characterized by lithology and fluid content data
and the latter reflects geomechanical behavior associated with hydraulic fracturing. Essentially,
they are similar to RQ and CQ used by Gamero-Diaz et al. (2013), respectively, although the para￾meters used for defining the related RQ indicators are somewhat different in Avanzini et al. (2016)
and Gamero-Diaz et al. (2013). Petrophysical data analysis was performed from core measurements
and well-log data and geomechanical data analysis was done based on well-log data (Figure 15.3).
Cluster analysis was employed to determine geomechanical facies and petrophysical facies. The
sweep spot was then identified with those facies with both favorite static RQ and dynamic RQ.
In many cases, the data available for identifying sweet spots from a reservoir is purely from core
measurements and well logs (e.g. Avanzini et al. 2016). Since sweet spots are three-dimensional
(3D), the 3D distributions of rock properties are needed for sweet spot identification. To deal with
this issue, Ismail et al. (2020) recently proposed a color transformation overlay method. It consists of

342 15 Sweet Spot Identification in Unconventional Shale Reservoirsthree steps. The first is to determine distributions of reservoir petrophysical properties and mechan￾ical properties along wells where the well logs data are available. The second step is to determine
the 3D distributions of the reservoir properties based on geo-statistics methods. Different color
maps are used for representing these distributions. The third step is to determine sweet spots by
identifying overlapping zones of favorite reservoir properties with so-called color transformation
overlay. With the currently available computational and visualization capabilities, the method is
practically useful when the parameter value ranges of the associated quality indicators used for
defining the sweet spots are given. However, the method is largely dependent on geo-statistics
methods for 3D interpolations, while the uncertainty associated with the geo-statistics methods
can be significant when the number (or spatial coverage) of the data points is limited. Thus, the
usefulness of the method needs to be further evaluated especially when multi-dimensional seismic
data is available.
15.3.4 Methods Based on Data Mining and Machine Learning
In Sections 15.3.1–15.3.3, we reviewed the typical methods for sweet spot identification while keep￾ing in mind that these methodologies may serve as useful guidelines for readers in their practical
applications. All these methods are based on different RQ indicators (e.g. OQ, RQ, and MQ), with
each indicator being characterized by a group of parameters, although the differences among these
indicators, under different names, may not be significant in reality. Then the sweet spots are deter￾mined by empirically defining the ranges of the related parameters. These rule-based methods,
however, have one major limitation that they all ignore the complex interactions among these para￾meters. Take TOC as an example. TOC is an important parameter for RQ and can be important for
MQ as well for shales with small clay contents, but not for shales with large clay contents. This is
because the rock brittleness can be determined by TOC in the former case but mainly by the clay
content in the latter case. Therefore, there are different TOC ranges for sweet spots in the two cases.
One method to potentially overcome the above limitation is machine learning and/or data min￾ing method that has become increasingly popular in the oil and gas industry because of their cap￾abilities in efficiently re-cognizing hidden patterns in extremely complex, nonlinear, and
multivariate data. Sweet spot identification is a supervised learning problem. For a machine learn￾ing and/or data mining method, parameters used for the model input are called features (such as
seismic attributes), and entities to match during the model training are called target(s) (such as
sweet spot or its properties). After model training, the trained model (or algorithm) is then used
to predict sweet spots based on feature values in a reservoir of interest. As will be demonstrated
later in this section, the challenge in applying machine learning and/or data mining method is
how to appropriately define the target.
Hauge and Hermansen (2017) reported a study on the use of machine learning methods for sweet
spot identification. They used and compared several machine learning methods for their study,
including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest. Note
that the focus of this chapter is on the methodology of sweet spot identification. We refer readers to
elsewhere (such as textbooks for machine learning) for the details of machine learning methods.
Hauge and Hermansen (2017) used seismic attributes as features, including P-wave velocity, S-wave
velocity, density, acoustic impedance, 4D residuals of prestack time migration, and average mag￾nitude of reflectivity. They defined the sweet spot with certain ranges of gamma ray and TOC and
trained the machine learning models to match the observed gamma ray and TOC data. The
trained model was then used for identifying the sweet spots. However, their definition of sweet
spot in terms of gamma ray and TOC only is arguable for different practical applications.
15.3 Sweet Spot Identification 343Tahmasebi et al. (2017) presented a machine-learning approach to estimate rock TOC and brittle￾ness with well-logs, X-ray diffraction data and core measurements. However, they did not touch on
how to identify sweet spots with TOC and brittleness values, while they are obviously related to
sweet spot identification. Tandon (2019) discussed integration of machine learning into sweet spot
identification mainly based on numerical simulation results. Using large number of numerical
simulations, Tandon (2019) developed a machine-learning model to map the rock mechanical prop￾erties (including shear modulus, Poisson’s ratio, fracture coefficient of friction, maximum horizon￾tal stress, fracture toughness, fracture closure stress, shear dilation angle, and initial hydraulic
fracture aperture) as features to the simulated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) as target. The
SRV was used to define sweet spots that correspond to zones with large SRVs. The usefulness of
the method, however, needs to be further investigated because it is difficult, if not impossible,
to get spatial distributions of those mechanical properties in practice.
The machine learning and/or data mining method works best when the production data are
available from certain number of wells in the reservoir under investigation. This is because the tar￾get (or sweet spot) can be easily and reliably defined with the production data. Furthermore, com￾pletion parameters and their impacts can also be considered. There are many studies in the
literature on the production prediction with machine learning and/or data mining methods for
shale reservoirs (Liu et al. 2021). These studies can be viewed as part of identification and/or refine￾ment of sweet spots. Herein we only discuss several selected ones as examples. Ketineni et al. (2015)
reported an approach to identify sweet spots using artificial neural network (ANN) model for field
development planning. They used various seismic attributes and well logs (including gamma ray,
neutron porosity, total porosity, bulk density, and deep resistivity) as features and the production as
the target. With the trained machine learning model, they were able to identify 100 sweet spots for
potentially drilling production wells.
Luo et al. (2018) discussed production prediction using machine learning in Bakken shale. They
selected approximately 2000 horizontal wells from Mid Bakken Formation with detailed comple￾tion records and initial production rates during 2013 and 2014 and targeted on the prediction of
first-year production. The eight features (or model input variables) include the total thickness
of the formation, the average volume of proppant per stage, formation depth, porosity, number
of stages, the average volume of fracturing fluid per stage, average stage length, and water satura￾tion. The trained ANN model correctly predicts 61% of the variance in well performance on the
wells that were not involved in model training. The study also indicates that the average volume
of proppant per stage is the most important completion feature impacting the well production.
Liang and Zhao (2019) presented a machine-learning study on production from Eagle Ford shale
formation. The study was based on production, petrophysical, and completion data from 4000 wells
and had three major components. Firstly, a multivariate linear regression model was created to
predict the overall EUR (estimated ultimate recovery). Secondly, the spatial autocorrelation anal￾ysis was carried out to identify whether spatial variables could affect the accuracy of the multivar￾iate regression model. Thirdly, the Random Forest Regression models were trained to examine their
reliability in predicting EUR with spatially autocorrelated data. The trained model correctly pre￾dicts about 60% of the variance in EUR from the wells. The key variables to predict Oil EUR are
PVT window, well depth, X coordinate, Y coordinate, lateral length of horizontal well, resources
density (the product of hydrocarbon saturation, porosity, and formation thickness), formation
thickness of lower Eagle Ford, and hydrocarbon saturation. The top 10 key predictors for gas
EUR are PVT window, Y coordinate, vitrinite reflectance equivalent, well depth, gross thickness
of shale formation, API, pressure gradient, the product of hydrocarbon saturation, porosity and for￾mation thickness, X coordinate, and TOC.
344 15 Sweet Spot Identification in Unconventional Shale ReservoirsCrnkovic-Friis and Erlandson (2015) used geology data only to estimate EUR and GOR (gas oil
ratio) for a region in Eagle Ford shale formation. The geological parameters include formation
thickness, porosity, bulk density, vitrinite reflectance, water saturation, TOC, and brittleness. Data
from over 800 wells were used for training and testing their deep-learning model. They also divided
the study region into three parts. Data from one part were used for training, while the data from the
other two parts were used for validation and testing, respectively. The mean absolute percentage
error for predicting the EUR is about 30% and shown to be smaller than the type-curve-average
method.
Bowie (2018) reported the use of an ANN and multiple linear regression for optimizing well per￾formance from Duvernay formation around Fox Creek, Alberta, Canada. The Duvernay is an upper
Devonian source rock in the Western Canadian Sedimentary basin. The Duvernay ranges in ther￾mal maturity from dry gas to black oil. Data from 262 wells were used for developing the ANN
model. There were 21 model input variables (features) that are almost all related to well completion
except the initial condensate yield; the geological and petrophysical data were not available for the
model development. The developed machine learning model seems to have relatively high predic￾tive power, correctly predicting 78% of the variance in well performance on 52 wells that were not
involved in model training. This implies that the performance for the studied wells there are largely
driven by well completion parameters for the formation. Key conclusions from the study include
that the total proppant amount is a key driver of well performance, and the more expensive fractur￾ing procedures, such as using ceramic or resin-coated proppant, do not provide significant benefit to
the well performance for Duvernay formation. The study by Wang and Chen (2016) also indicates
that the average proppant placed per stage is the most important parameter contributing to the well
production from Duvernay formation.
15.4 Discussion
Section 15.3 presents commonly used methods for sweet spot identification. In this section, we dis￾cuss the related challenges and gaps to guide further research activities in the area of sweet spot
identification.
Because of its complexity, sweet spot identification has been largely relied on empirical
approaches. Consequently, it is important to demonstrate how these approaches actually work
in terms of the observed production rates from wells located in the identified sweet spots when
the rate data is available, such as the study of Chen et al. (2017). However, studies on the evaluation
of the sweet spots identified in the reservoir characterization stage in terms of the production data
available in the field development stage are relatively rare in the literature. More studies on such
evaluation activities will provide significant insight into the advantages and limitations of different
methodologies for sweet spot identification.
It is well known that natural fractures play an important role in determining well productions
that generally prefer more natural fractures corresponding to larger reservoir permeability and con￾tact areas. However, the natural fractures have not been considered in some methods for sweet spot
identification (e.g. Aldrich and Seidle 2018 or have been considered only qualitatively in other
methods (e.g. Chen et al. 2017). The key technical challenge is how to characterize natural fractures
reliably and accurately by interpreting and analyzing core measurements, well logs, and especially
the seismic data. More studies to address this challenge and develop ways to quantitatively incor￾porate information on natural fractures into sweet spot identification are desirable.
15.4 Discussion 345Most methods for sweet spot identification use rock brittleness to characterize the fracability,
or the easiness of hydraulic fracturing. As previously indicated, it is not sufficient to use rock
brittleness alone for characterizing the fracability, and some reservoirs with high BI values are
still difficult to fracture (Daniel et al. 2011; Bai 2016). In addition to brittleness, the fracability is
related to rock structures, fracture toughness, and in-situ stresses as well. The future studies on
sweet spot identification need to consider more factors impacting the fracability in addition to
the brittleness.
While most methods for sweet spot identification are rule-based, machine learning methods
provide new ways for the identification and can overcome the limitation of the rule-based meth￾ods that are not able to consider the nonlinear interactions among different parameters used to
calculate RQ indicators. They, however, generally need the well production data as their targets.
For the newly developed unconventional resources, the production data is limited. Liu et al.
(2021) call the prediction of well production for this case as a gray-box problem with incomplete
understanding of physics and certain amount of data. They also indicated that the most effective
way to deal with the gray-box problem is to develop and employ gray-box approaches that com￾bine the strengths of physics-based models and machine learning that is used for dealing with
certain components of the prediction where physical understanding is poor or difficult. More
studies on the gray-box approaches for sweet spot identification, including case studies, are highly
desirable.
15.5 Conclusion
The success of developing unconventional resources is largely determined by identifying the so￾called sweet spots, or locations of shale formations that are favorable for economic production.
Sweet spot identification is an important part of reservoir characterization and seeks reservoir
zones that have enough hydrocarbon in place for recovery, relative easiness for the gas and/or
oil recovery (e.g. relatively high permeability) after the stimulation, and relative effectiveness for
reservoir stimulation or hydraulic fracturing. Some economic factors, such as the cost for transpor￾tation, may also need to be considered for sweet spot identification.
While we acknowledge that there is not a universal method applicable to different shale
formations, this chapter intends to provide a state-of-art review on the currently available methods
used for sweet spot identification, including the method based on organic, rock, and mechanical
qualities, the method based on geological and engineering sweet spots, the method based on other
quality indicators, and the method based on data mining and machine learning. Efforts are made
to present parameter-value ranges (when available) used to define the sweet spots in these methods
such that the chapter can serve as a guidance for future improvement and applications of these
methods.
To motivate future researches on sweet spot identification, this chapter also discusses the related
challenges and gaps, including the needs of more studies on the evaluation of the sweet spots iden￾tified in the reservoir characterization stage in terms of the production data available in the field
development stage, the technical challenge for characterizing natural fractures reliably and accu￾rately by interpreting and analyzing core measurements, well logs and especially the seismic data,
consideration of more factors impacting the fracability in addition to the brittleness, and the further
development of gray-box approaches that combine the strengths of physics-based models and
machine learning for well performance production.
