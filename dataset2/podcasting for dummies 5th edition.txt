Foreword
I
t’s been 20 years since podcasting became a thing, and we’ve come a long way, 
baby. For the first 10 years, “What’s a podcast?” was what everyone said when 
you told them you were starting a podcast. For the last 10 years, the question 
has shifted to “How much money do you make with your podcast?” or “Do you 
know Joe Rogan?” Both questions make me sad, but for very different reasons that 
I don’t have time to get into in my triumphant return to the world of Podcasting For 
Dummies.
So much has changed since Tee and I put pen to paper in late 2004 to help early 
adopters navigate the world of podcasting. I’ll be honest — we made most of it up 
as we went along, because we and other pioneering podcasters from that time 
were inventing the medium as we were publishing to it. That was a lot of fun — 
and sometimes a lot of sheer terror. Back then, it was literally possible to break 
podcasting in a variety of ways.
As 2025 looms on the horizon, today’s crop of budding podcasters — I’m looking 
at you — have it both easier and harder than we did back in the day. The technol￾ogy that enables podcasters to create and distribute their shows to your ears is 
robust and about as bulletproof as things can get online. Over those 20 years, 
we’ve developed and adhered to standards that ensure that listeners have the best 
experience with our content, as well as paved the way for more ways for podcast￾ers to express themselves and, sometimes, get paid.
When I started podcasting in 2004, there were 40 podcasts. Today, Podcast Index 
(https://pfdbook.link/stats) tracks well over 4 million podcasts — not count￾ing the myriad video channels, private feeds, and other shows that people call 
podcasts that don’t have an RSS feed. By this time next year, that number could 
double. Such growth is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you have more 
competion than ever before, and breaking away from the pack could be a chal￾lenge. On the other, there are more people listening and watching than ever 
before. Tee and Chuck are here to help.
I’m still bullish on podcasting. Heck, it’s been my only source of income since 
2016 and has been every bit of feast and famine as you might imagine. It’s taken xiv Podcasting For Dummies
me quite literally around the globe, and I’ve no plans to exit the industry anytime 
soon. And while I can’t promise you that reading this edition of Podcasting For 
Dummies will get you inducted into the Podcast Hall of Fame in 20 years, I can 
assure you that you’ll be better equipped to navigate the ever-changing world of 
change in podcasting.
Enjoy your podcasting journey. You’re in good hands with my two friends, Tee and 
Chuck. Jump in!

Introduction
The funny thing about podcasting — outside of comedy podcasts, of course — 
is that it isn’t that hard to do. You just need someone to point the way and 
illuminate your path.
You don’t need to be a techno-wizard or a super-geek. You can take a thought or 
an opinion, create original audio or video expressing that thought or opinion, and 
distribute your idea worldwide. You can capture the attention of a few hundred — 
or a few thousand  — people around the world through MP3 players hiding in 
computers, loaded on smartphones, strapped around biceps, bouncing in pockets, 
or hooked up to car stereos.
You can do podcasting, from recording to online hosting, on a variety of budgets, 
ranging from frugal to Fortune 500. You can podcast about literally anything — 
including podcasting for its own sake. Blogging gave the anonymous, famous, 
almost-famous, and used-to-be famous a voice in politics, religion, and everyday 
life. Podcasting adds volume and tone to that voice.
About This Book
Podcasting For Dummies, 5th Edition provides the answer to the question, “How do 
I podcast?” We take you through the always-evolving technological movement 
encompassing the internet, digital communications, education, and entertain￾ment. By the time you reach the end of this book, the basics will be in place to get 
you, your voice, and your message heard around the world — and you can even 
have fun along the way.
This book was written as a linear path from the conceptualization stages to the 
final publication of your work. However, you don’t have to read the book from 
page one. If you’ve already gotten your feet wet with various aspects of podcast￾ing, jump around from chapter to chapter and read the sections you need. We 
provide plenty of guides back to other relevant chapters when the going gets 
murky.2 Podcasting For Dummies
Podcasting For Dummies should be the following to all who pick up and read it:
» A user-friendly guide for how to listen to, produce, and distribute podcasts
» A terrific reference for choosing the right hardware and software to put 
together a sharp-sounding podcast
» The starting point for the person who knows nothing about editing, recording, 
hosting blogs, or turning a computer into a recording studio
» A handy go-to think tank for a beginning podcaster who’s hungry for new 
ideas and fresh points of view
» A fun read
We don’t claim to answer all possible podcasting queries, but we do present the 
building blocks and first steps for beginning a podcast. As with any Dummies book, 
our responsibility is to give you the foundation on which to build. We did our level 
best to bestow upon you the enchanted stuff that makes a podcast happen.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you have a computer, a lot of curiosity, and a desire to podcast. 
We couldn’t care less about whether you’re using a Mac, a PC, Linux, Unix, or two 
Dixie cups connected with string. (Okay, maybe the two Dixie cups would be a 
challenge; a computer is essential.) We’re here to describe the tools for creating a 
podcast, regardless of what OS you’re running.
If you know nothing about media production, this book can also serve as a fine 
primer on how to record, edit, and produce audio and video on your computer, as 
well as accessorize your computer with mixing boards, professional-grade micro￾phones, and media-engineering software.
With everything that goes into podcasting, there are some things this book is not 
about. Here’s the short list:
» We don’t try to make you into an übergeek in RSS or XML (but we give you all 
you need to make things work — and even get you Spotify-ready).
» We figure that if you get hold of Audacity, you can take it from there (but we 
give you an overview of the program and a few basic editing examples).
» We don’t teach you how to get rich quick by podcasting. Although we teach 
you how to produce a podcast, there’s no magic formula for making the next 
Serial or Welcome to Night Vale.Introduction 3
If you’re looking for a terrific start to the podcasting experience, then — in the 
words of the last knight guarding the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade — “You have chosen wisely.”
Icons Used in This Book
So you’re trekking through the book, making some progress with developing your 
podcast, when suddenly little icons leap out, grab you by the throat, and wrestle 
you to the ground. (Who would have thought podcasting was so action-packed, 
like an MCU movie, huh?) What do all these little drawings mean?
Glad you asked.
When we’re in the middle of a discussion and suddenly have one of those “Say, 
that reminds me” moments, we give you one of these tips. They’re handy extras 
that are good to know and might even make your podcast sound a little tighter 
than average.
If the moment is more than a handy little nugget of information and closer to a 
“Seriously, you can’t forget this part!” factoid, we mark it with a Remember icon. 
You’re going to want to play close attention to these puppies.
Sometimes we interrupt our train of thought with a “Time out, Sparky” moment — 
and this is where we ask for your undivided attention. The warnings are exactly 
that: flashing lights, ah-ooga horns, dire portents, or your local DM saying “roll 
for initiative.” They’re reminders not to try this at home because you’ll definitely 
regret it.
These icons illuminate the “So how does this widget really work?” moments you 
may have as you read this book. The technical stuff icons give you a deeper under￾standing of what the wizard is doing behind the curtain. If you want to skip the 
nitty-gritty details, that’s perfectly fine.
Beyond the Book
In addition to what you’re reading right now, this book also comes with a free 
online cheat sheet offering quick reference points you’ll want to have on hand 
when you’re working on your first podcast or your first production on location. To 
get the cheat sheet, simply go to www.dummies.com and search for Podcasting For 
Dummies Cheat Sheet in the Search box.4 Podcasting For Dummies
This book also comes with a companion podcast, Podcasting For Dummies: The 
Companion Podcast. Go to https://pfdbook.link/home and follow the instruc￾tions to get free weekly audio commentary from Tee Morris and Chuck Tomasi 
about concepts in this book explored in greater detail, such as the difference 
between good and bad edits, when to tone down the reverb, and the variety of 
methods you can use to record a podcast.
Where to Go from Here
At this point, many Dummies authors say something snappy, clever, or even a bit 
snarky. We save our best tongue-in-cheek material for the pages inside, so here’s 
a more serious approach.
We suggest that you head to where you’re planning to record your podcast or plant 
yourself in front of a computer. Then start with Chapter 1, where you’re given a 
few links to check out and some suggestions on applications for downloading 
podcasts. You also find out about Tee’s and Chuck’s (many) podcasts as well as 
other podcasts that can educate, inspire, and enlighten your ears with original 
content.
Where do we go from here? Up and out, friends. Up and out.1

Getting the Scoop 
on Podcasting
Sometimes the invention that has the biggest effect on our daily lives isn’t an 
invention at all but the convergence of existing technologies, processes, and 
ideas. Podcasting may be the perfect example of that principle — and it’s 
changing the relationship people have with their media player of choice, music 
collections, books, education, and more.
The podcasting movement is a spinoff of another communications boom: blogs,
short for web logs. Blogs sprang up in the early 2000s, providing anyone with a 
desire to share their thoughts a clean, elegant interface that left many on the 
technology side wondering why they hadn’t thought of it sooner. Everyday people 
could chronicle their lives, hopes, dreams, and fears and show them to anyone 
who cared to read. And oddly enough, people did care to read — and still do.
Many blogs offered something called an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed, which 
is basically a text file with blog articles and images along with metadata such as 
the author and publish date. RSS feeds liberated the reader from the mundane task 
of periodically checking their favorite blog sites for new content. Using an app, the 
reader could subscribe to a site and the app would automatically bring them the 
information.

Then in 2003, former MTV VJ Adam Curry started collaborating with programmer 
Dave Winer to improve RSS so that it allowed you to share not only text and images 
but also media attachments, including compressed audio and video files. Soon 
after, Curry released his first podcast-catching client. Thus launched the media 
platform of podcasting.
Podcasting combines the instant information exchange of blogging with audio 
and video files that you can play on a computer or portable media device. When 
you make your podcast publicly available on the internet, you’re exposing your 
craft to anyone with a computer or mobile device and a connection capable of 
streaming data. To put that in perspective, some online sources report that the 
global online population is more than 5.3 billion users. In the US alone, more than 
300 million people own some kind of mobile device or portable media player and 
every one of them is capable of playing your content!
This chapter is for the consumers of the content (the audience) and those who 
make the content (the podcasters) alike. We cover the basic steps to record an 
audio podcast and lay out the basics of what you need to do to enjoy a podcast on 
your media player.
If you’re starting to get the idea that podcasting is revolutionary, groundbreaking, 
and possibly a major component of social upheaval, great. Some podcasts have 
made their mark in society, or reignited the desire for listening to stories, or shone 
a spotlight on criminal injustices. But not all podcasts are so deep. In fact, many 
are passion projects inviting you to join in on the experience!
Deciding Whether Podcasting Is for You
Technically speaking, podcasting is the distribution of specially encoded multime￾dia content to subscribed devices via the RSS 2.0 protocol. Whew! Allow us to 
translate that into common-speak: Podcasting allows you to listen to and watch 
what you want, where you want, and when you want.
Podcasting, which is often referred to as time shifted media, turns the tables on 
broadcast schedules, allowing the listener to choose not only what to listen to but 
also when. And because podcasts are transferred via the internet, the power to 
create a program isn’t limited to those with access to a transmitter.
The simplest reason to podcast is that it’s just plain fun! We’ve been podcasting 
since the beginning, and we’re still having a blast, getting messages to our world￾wide audiences and challenging ourselves with new tricks and techniques for cre￾ating captivating media. So, yeah, for the fun of it? Heck of a good reason.CHAPTER 1 Getting the Scoop on Podcasting 9
The following sections cover other reasons podcasting might be for you.
You want to build your brand
Whether you are someone who owns a company and are looking to promote your 
products or services, an author looking to get their story told, or an individual 
with the desire to be recognized as a subject matter expert, a podcast is a great 
way to get your message out there and to be seen and heard. Unintentionally, this 
is what happened to Chuck at his day job. He put on a bow tie and started creating 
content for the community related to his day job  — and before long people 
regarded him as the face of a multibillion dollar company. It’s a great story until 
Chuck finds himself at a conference in a hurry to get to his next speaking session 
only to be stopped by one more adoring fan for a selfie.
WHAT’S IN A NAME, WHEN THE 
NAME IS PODCASTING?
As with most words that make their way into the conventional lexicon, the precise ori￾gins and meaning behind podcasting are clouded. Although the domain podcast.com
was registered back in 2002, Ben Hammersley suggested podcasting and many other 
terms as possible names for this new technology in February 2004 (https://pfdbook.
link/guardian), it’s generally accepted in the podcast community that the first person 
to use the term as a reference to the activity we now know as podcasting was Dannie 
Gregoire on September 15, 2004. Some voices in tech asserted that the term held con￾notations to Apple’s popular player of the time, the iPod. Regardless of the intentions, 
the term was backronymed (that is, treated like an acronym and applied to a variety of 
plausible existing meanings) even with alternative names defiantly offered . . . but to no 
avail. The term podcasting became part of everyday vocabulary.
Content creators who set up YouTube and Twitch livestreams and tell the world 
“Check out my podcast!” used to make us weep. We were purists, telling people “You 
can’t call it a podcast if you don’t have an RSS feed!” However, on finding our own 
place in streaming, we understood that times change, technology evolves, and even 
these old dogs can learn new tricks. We now realize that the term podcast no longer 
represents the specific technology linked to RSS; it’s more about making your con￾tent available to a global audience delivered automatically or streaming on-demand. 
For that reason, we include Chapter 16 to help get you started streaming and seam￾lessly work it into your podcast’s workflow.10 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
You want to deliver media 
on a regular basis
Sure, you can include audio, video, and PDF content in a blog. Many bloggers cre￾ate special content and insert it as links in the text of their blogposts. Readers then 
download the files at their leisure. However, this approach requires manual selec￾tion of the content that blog hosts want readers to download.
Podcasting automates that process. A listener who subscribes to your podcast is 
subscribed to all your content, whenever it’s available. No need to go back to the 
site to see what’s new! Once listeners subscribe to your podcast, the content is 
delivered to them in the same way as when they subscribe to a print magazine. 
This is why many apps call it subscribing to a podcast.
You want to reach beyond the boundaries 
of broadcast media
In all types of radio except satellite radio, the number of people who can listen to 
a show is limited by the power of the transmitter pumping out the signal. Broad￾cast television has similar limitations, depending on whether you are using an 
antenna, cable, or a satellite dish to receive programming. Podcasting doesn’t rely 
on or utilize signals, transmitters, or receivers — at least not in the classic sense. 
Podcasts use the internet as the delivery system, opening up a potential audience 
that could extend to the entire planet.
No rules exist (yet, anyway) to regulate the creation of podcast content. In fact, 
neither the FCC nor any other regulatory body for any other government holds 
jurisdiction over podcasts. If that seems astounding, remember that podcasters 
are not using the public airwaves to deliver their message.
Just because the FCC doesn’t have jurisdiction, you’re not exempt from the law 
or — perhaps more importantly — immune to lawsuits. You’re personally respon￾sible for anything you say, do, or condone on your show. Additionally, the rules 
concerning airplay of licensed music, the distribution of copyrighted material, and 
the legalities of recording conversations all apply. Pay close attention to the rele￾vant sections in Chapter 5 to avoid some serious consequences. When it comes to 
the legalities, ignorance is not bliss.
You have something to say
As a general rule, podcasters produce content that likely holds appeal for only a 
select audience. Podcasts start with an idea, something that the podcaster has the CHAPTER 1 Getting the Scoop on Podcasting 11
desire and knowledge, either real or imaginary, to talk about. Add to that a bit of 
drive, do-it-yourself-ishness, and an inability to take no for an answer. The point 
is to say what you want to say, to those who want to hear it.
Podcasts can be about anything and be enjoyed by just about anyone. The topics 
covered don’t have to be earth-shattering or life-changing. They can be about 
do-it-yourself projects, sound-seeing tours of places you visit, or even your 
favorite board games. A few rules and guidelines are common, but at times you 
may find it necessary to bend the rules. (That can be a lot of fun in itself!)
Some of the most popular podcasts are created by everyday people who sit in front 
of their computers or phones once a week and just speak their mind, heart, and 
soul. Some are focused on niche topics; others are more broad-based.
You want to hear from your listeners
A perk of podcasting is accessibility. On average, most audiences have a direct line 
of contact between themselves and the podcast’s host or hosts. Podcast consum￾ers are more likely to provide feedback for what they listen to or watch, probably 
traceable to the personal nature of a podcast. Unlike popular talk shows that fol￾low strict formulaic approaches, podcasts offer their audiences — and the creators 
behind the production — control, options, and intimacy that traditional broadcast 
media cannot. This appeal has attracted to podcasting major production studios 
such as NPR, ESPN, Disney, CBC, and HBO, who were early adopters and continue 
podcasting today. The connection of podcasting with audiences paved the way for 
streamers, and now podcasting and streaming are synonymous.
When you ask for feedback, you’re likely to get it — and from unusual places. 
Because geography doesn’t limit the distance your podcast can travel, you may 
find yourself with listeners in faraway and exotic places. And this feedback isn’t 
always going to be “Wow, great podcast!” Listeners will be honest with you when 
you invite feedback.
Creating a Podcast
The two main schools of thought when creating a podcast are the “I need the lat￾est and greatest equipment to capture that crisp, clear sound of the broadcasting 
industry” school, and the “Hey, I have a phone with a microphone and I can 
record my voice wherever I am” school. Both are equally valid positions, and lots 
of secondary schools are in-between. The question is how far you’re willing to go.12 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
But allow us to dispel a few misconceptions about podcasting right off the bat: 
You’re not reprogramming your operating system, you’re not hacking into the 
Internal Revenue Service’s database, and you’re not setting up a wireless com￾puter network with tinfoil from a chewing gum wrapper, a shoestring, and your 
belt, regardless if MacGyver showed you how. Podcasting is not rocket science. In 
fact, here’s a quick rundown of how you podcast:
1. Record audio or video and convert it to a download-friendly format.
2. Write a description of what you just created.
3. Upload everything to a host server.
Yes, yes, yes, if podcasting were that simple, why is this book so thick? Well, we 
admit that this list does gloss over a few details, but a podcast  — in its most 
streamlined, raw presentation — is that simple. The details of putting together a 
single episode start in Chapter 2 and wrap up in Chapter 8; Chapters 9 through 12 
walk you through all you need to make the media you create into a podcast.
So, yeah, podcasting is easy, but there’s a lot to it.
Looking for the bare necessities
You need a few things before starting your first podcast, many of which you can 
probably find on your computer. For these beginning steps, we focus on audio:
» A microphone: Take a look at your computer. Right now, regardless of 
whether you have a laptop or a desktop, Windows or Mac, your computer 
probably has a built-in microphone — or a USB port for plugging in a micro￾phone. Yes, even your mobile phone has a microphone, or it wouldn’t be 
much of a phone, would it? Many earbuds even include a microphone.
Position the microphone in a comfortable spot on your desk or table. If 
you’re using a laptop, it should be somewhere on your desk that allows 
for best recording results without hunching over the computer like Young 
Frankenstein’s Igor. (That’s EYE-gor.) Check the laptop’s documentation to 
find out where the built-in microphone is located in the unit’s housing. For 
a mobile phone, hold the device as if you’re making a call, the way it was 
intended. Holding the device any other way can degrade the audio quality. If 
you’re using a microphone earbuds set included with the phone’s purchase, 
you may need to do some experimentation.
Usually the built-in microphone in a laptop is located close to the edge of the 
keyboard or near the laptop’s speakers.CHAPTER 1 Getting the Scoop on Podcasting 13
» Recording software: Check out the software that came with your computer. 
You know, all those extra applications that you filed away, thinking, “I’ll check 
those out sometime.” Well, that time has arrived. You probably have some 
sort of audio-recording software loaded on your computer, such as Voice 
Recorder (PC) or GarageBand (Mac).
If you don’t already have the appropriate software, here’s a fast way to get it: 
Download the version of Audacity for your operating system (at https://
pfdbook.link/audacity). Audacity, which is shown in Figure 1-1, is free. 
Good news! We get in-depth with Audacity later in this book.
» An audio interface: Make sure your computer has the hardware it needs to 
handle audio recording and the drivers to run the hardware — unless you 
have a built-in microphone.
Some desktop computers come with an elementary audio card built into the 
motherboard. Before you run out to your local computer vendor and spring 
for an audio card, check your computer to see whether it can already handle 
basic voice recording.
See Chapter 2 for tips on choosing the right mic and audio accessories. Chapter 3 
covers all the software you’ll need.
FIGURE 1-1:
Audacity allows 
you to record and 
edit audio and 
create MP3 files.14 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Recording your first podcast
When you have your computer set up and your microphone working, it’s time to 
start recording. Take a deep breath and follow these steps:
1. Jot down a few notes on what you want to talk about.
Nothing too fancy — just make an outline that includes remarks about who 
you are and what you want to talk about. Use these bullet points to keep 
yourself on track.
Checking your computer, jotting down notes, and setting up your recording 
area is called preshow prep. This topic is discussed in depth in Chapter 5 by 
other podcasters who have their own set ways of getting ready to record.
2. Click the record button in your recording software and talk for as long as 
it takes for you to get through your notes.
We recommend keeping your first recording to no more than 20 minutes. That 
may seem like a lot of time, but it will fly by.
3. Give a nice little sign-off and click the stop button.
An example of a sign-off is “Take care of yourselves! See you next time.”
4. Choose File  ➪   Save As and give your project a name.
Now bask in the warmth of creative accomplishment.
Compressing your audio files
Portable media devices and computers can play MP3 files as a default format. 
While many other audio formats are available, MP3 is the preferred format for 
podcasting because so many digital devices and operating systems recognize it. If 
your recording software can output straight to MP3 format, your life is much 
simpler.
If your software can’t export directly to MP3, it should be able to save to a WAV 
(Windows) or AIFF (Mac) file, which is raw, is uncompressed, and can get large. 
In this case, save your raw file from your first software package and then use 
Audacity to import the file and export it as MP3. We get into those details in 
Chapter 3.
Congratulations — you just recorded your first audio podcast! Easy, isn’t it? How￾ever, this is merely the first step into a larger world, as Obi-Wan once told Luke.CHAPTER 1 Getting the Scoop on Podcasting 15
Uploading your audio to the web
An audio file sitting on your desktop, regardless of how earth-shattering the 
content may be, is not a podcast. Nope, not by a long shot. You have to get it 
on the internet and provide a way for listeners to grab that tasty file for 
later consumption.
If you already have a web server for a blog, company website, or personal website, 
this process can be as easy as creating a folder and transferring your newly cre￾ated audio file to your server.
If that last paragraph left you puzzled and you’re wondering what kind of mess 
you’ve gotten yourself into, relax. We don’t leave you hanging out in the wind. 
Chapter 10 covers everything you need to know about choosing a web server for 
your podcast media files.
A podcast media file can be any type of media file you want. Three popular types 
are audio, video, and PDF. While our primary attention is on audio, you can use all 
the tips we give here to handle other types of media.
After you upload your episode, you need to have an RSS (Really Simple Syndica￾tion) file generated to deliver it. (The RSS file is generated automatically on a 
blog.) RSS describes where to find the media file you just uploaded. Nearly all 
blogging software (called blog engines) support RSS, but not all support podcasts. 
As you look at blogging software options, check closely for podcast support. If it’s 
not included natively, you may be able to add a plug-in, a downloadable extension.
With blog software and podcast support, generating the RSS file becomes a simple 
affair. This generated RSS file is your podcast feed. People who listen to your 
podcast can subscribe to your show by placing a link to the podcast feed in their 
podcast application, such as Apple’s Podcast, Overcast (shown in Figure 1-2), or 
Spotify. All these apps are looking for your podcast’s RSS, and list it in their 
directory, which is exactly what it sounds like  — a digital catalog of podcasts 
available to you.
Yes, we know — this sounds complicated. But we assure you that it’s not. Some 
hosting companies, such as LibSyn (https://pfdbook.link/libsyn), specialize 
in taking the technological bite out of podcasting so that you can focus on creating 
your best-sounding show. With LibSyn (shown in Figure 1-3), moving your file to 
a web server is as simple as clicking a few buttons; the RSS 2.0 podcast feed and 
even the accompanying web page are created automatically.16 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Grabbing listeners
With media files in place and an RSS feed ready to be recognized by your podcast 
app of choice, you’re officially a podcaster. Of course, that doesn’t mean a lot if 
you’re the only person who knows about your podcast. You need to spread the

content as

interactive PDFs.

word to let others know that you exist and that you have something pretty darned 
important to say.
Creating show notes
Before you pick up a bullhorn, slap a sandwich board over yourself, and start 
walking down the street (virtually, anyway), describe the contents of your show to 
casual online passersby in hopes of getting them to listen to what you have to say. 
The blog post is where show notes take form and give people a rundown of what 
you’re talking about. The blog post should be descriptive enough to captivate 
those who reach it.
You can glance at a blog and easily get the gist of a conversation, but an audio file 
requires active listening to understand and is difficult to skim. In effect, you’re 
asking people to invest time listening to you talk, read a story, or play music. You 
need some compelling text on a web page to hook them.
Show notes quickly showcase or highlight the relevant and pertinent contents of 
the audio file itself. A verbatim transcript of your show isn’t always necessary, but 
we do recommend more than simply saying “a show about my day.” Chapter 11 
discusses ways to create show notes and offers tips and tricks to give them 
some punch.
Getting listed in directories
When you have a final media file and a solid set of show notes, you’re ready to 
take your podcast message to the masses. You can get listed on some directories 
and podcast-listing sites, such as Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Amazon Podcasts, and 
Blubrry. Potential listeners visit dozens of websites as they seek new content, 
and getting yourself listed on as many as possible can help bring in more new 
listeners to your program.
A huge listener base is a double-edged sword: More demand for your product 
means more demand on you and the resources necessary to keep your podcast up 
and running. We recommend working on your craft and your skills, as well as get￾ting a good handle on the personal and technological requirements of podcasting 
before you embark on a huge marketing campaign. When you’re ready, turn to 
Part 4 for details about marketing. You discover various ways to attract more lis￾teners to your show and to respond to the ideas and feedback that your listeners 
inevitably provide. Many podcasters are surprised at the sheer volume of com￾ments they receive from their listeners — but they shouldn’t be considering how 
personal podcasting is (compared to traditional forms of media distribution).18 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
There’s an App for That
You have the media file, an RSS feed, and accompanying show notes. You’re all 
set, but ask yourself, “How do podcasts get from the web to my device so I can 
watch or listen?” To access all this great new content, you need a podcatching cli￾ent, or podcatcher, an application that looks at various RSS feeds, finds the new 
stuff, and transfers it from the internet to your computer or mobile device auto￾matically. In this section, you look at some of the different podcatching apps 
available for your listening and viewing needs.
This section is just a starting point for getting access to podcasts. Podcasting con￾tinues to grow in popularity, and new podcasting apps are coming out all the time. 
Any attempt at a comprehensive list would be obsolete almost instantly. And 
remember, you can listen to podcasts on all sorts of devices besides computers — 
smartphones, tablets, AppleTV, Roku, and more!
The old-timer: Apple Podcasts
With iTunes launching its own podcast directory and a podcast-ready version of 
its player in June 2005, podcasting went from what the geeks were doing in the 
MAKING MONEY FROM PODCASTS
This book covers the basics to get started creating a podcast. However, a common 
question we get from many new podcasters is, “How can I make money from my show?” 
After all, who doesn’t want to get paid for their work? We don’t cover monetization, but 
we do want to point out that many factors are involved in monetizing a show, such as 
the size of your audience, the topics you cover, how you market or sell your show, and 
how you plan to generate revenue (listener contributions, advertisers, or using the show 
as a lead generation for your products or services). A wealth of resources are available 
in print and online to help you understand and implement these concepts. Check out 
the Podcasting subreddit at https://pfdbook.link/reddit for a list of books, pod￾casts, and websites on monetization.
Revisit the reasons for creating a podcast, and ask yourself, “Why am I podcasting and 
do I need to make money?” If you’re doing this as a hobby, you may lose motivation if 
you turn it into a job. Do your research and consider your options, skills, costs, and time. 
Monetizing your podcast could be lucrative, but it could also give you gray hair at an 
early age.CHAPTER 1 Getting the Scoop on Podcasting 19
basement of the science building to the next wave of innovation on the internet 
(which was, of course, developed by the geeks in the basement of the science 
building). Plenty of contributing factors helped make podcasting mainstream, but 
iTunes introducing a push-button subscription method was a huge step forward.
As always, such a step into the mainstream market dismayed some original 
podcasters, who found themselves overshadowed by larger media entities. Now, 
recognizable giants such as NPR, The New  York Times, ESPN, and BBC dominate 
Apple’s podcast directory (shown in Figure 1-4). What about the indie podcasts — 
the ones that started it all? Would they be forgotten? Go unnoticed? Languish unsub￾scribed? Well, at first, it seemed that many of the groundbreakers that the podcasting 
community knew and loved (Comedy4Cast, Evil Genius Chronicles, Coverville, Grammar￾Girl) might get lost in the stampede. But they haven’t yet, as it turns out.
With the upgrade to macOS X (10.15) in 2019, the monolithic iTunes app was 
replaced with a separate Podcasts app (along with another for music and a third 
for shows and movies). As for the Windows edition, fear not — as of this writing, 
you can still get iTunes for Windows (at https://pfdbook.link/itunes). 
Whether using Apple Podcasts or iTunes on your desktop, the software lends an 
automatic hand to people new to podcasting, showing them where to find blogs 
that host podcasts and which podcast directories list the shows that fit their needs 
and desires.
FIGURE 1-4:

Subscribing to podcasts using Apple Podcasts is easy. Just follow these steps:
1. Open the Podcasts app.
2. Find the podcast of your choice:
• Browse a list of podcasts by clicking the Browse option on the left side of the 
screen.
• View popular podcasts by clicking the Top Charts option (below Browse).
• Search for a podcast by typing in the Search box in the upper left.
3. When you find a show that interests you, click the image to get to the 
podcast page and then click the Follow button.
After your podcast finishes downloading, you can find new episodes by going to 
the Listen Now section in the left column of the podcasts app, or get specific 
shows or episodes from the Downloaded section (also on the left).
Podcasting on the go: Pocket Casts
As smartphones and tablets became more prevalent, the demand of having “an 
app for that” grew. Finding and subscribing to podcasts in the early days was pos￾sible on a mobile device but a bit clunky. The stage had been set for a new kind of 
interface that was just as easy and elegant to use on your mobile device as it would 
be on a computer.
Enter Pocket Casts (https://pfdbook.link/pocketcasts), an app available for 
iOS (iPhone and iPad), Mac, Windows, and Android that debuted in 2010 and 
quickly became a go-to podcast app. Pocket Casts, shown in Figure 1-5, enables 
you to quickly find new podcasts, subscribe, and see your subscriptions in a list or 
grid. The player allows you to jump ahead 30 seconds or back 10 seconds with a 
tap. The app also features a number of useful configuration options, such as 
adjusting playback speed and the space between pauses as well as the ability to 
start and end at a certain time in each episode for all shows or individual shows — 
many of these features have been added to the Apple Podcasts and Spotify apps 
over the years as well. Additionally, the app automatically syncs across platforms 
so you don’t lose your place.
Finding a podcast for your personal feed is only a few taps away:
1. Download and install Pocket Casts either from the Apple App store (iOS 
devices) or Google Play (Android devices).
2. Launch Pocket Casts on your mobile device.CHAPTER 1 Getting the Scoop on Podcasting 21
3. Sign in with Apple or Google, or sign up for a free account.
4. Find the podcast of your choice in one of the following ways:
• Tap the Discover icon at the bottom of the screen.
• Swipe up through the offered feeds on your front page.
If you still can’t find the podcast, go to the podcast’s website and copy the RSS 
URL. Then tap the magnifying glass at the top, and paste the RSS URL it in the 
search field.
5. When you find something you like, tap the show’s image.
6. To subscribe, tap the Subscribe button.
The show appears in your Podcasts list (see Figure 1-6). Tap any episode to listen 
right now.
Pocket Casts is a terrific option because it’s available on a variety of platforms, 
including playback through your browser, and interfaces seamlessly with many 
makes and models of automobiles. The app recognizes when you plug your smart￾phone into your car’s USB port, and your car’s media center can then pick up 
where you left off.

The 800-pound gorilla: Spotify
For nearly a decade, the king of podcasting apps was Apple Podcasts (formerly 
iTunes), but like all technology, the crown must get passed. When you say “Spo￾tify,” most people think of streaming music, but in 2015 it added support for 
podcasts, which were originally available only to music artists and broadcast 
media productions. In 2018, however, Spotify simplified its application and 
screening process and now brings podcasting to millions of listeners worldwide 
(see Figure 1-7). Once installed, log in or create a free account.
Installing and finding podcasts with Spotify is a simple matter. Here’s how to do 
it from a mobile device.
1. Install the Spotify app from the Apple App Store (for iOS devices) or 
Google Play (for Android devices).
2. Create a free account.
3. Tap the magnifying glass on the bottom and enter the podcast name in 
the Search box.
Or start browsing by tapping Podcasts.

• Click the play icon to listen to the podcast immediately.
• Click the plus-in-a-circle icon to save the podcast to your episodes for later 
listening.
• Tap the podcast image, and then tap the Follow button.
• Click the three-dot menu (next to the gear icon) and choose Follow to subscribe 
to the podcast.
Now you can quickly find the podcasts you follow by tapping Your Library in the 
bottom toolbar and then tapping Podcasts. New Episodes contains episodes from 
podcasts you follow that you haven’t listened to. Your Episodes lists any that you

YouTube podcasts
YouTube, which until recently was for videos only, now has podcasts. A YouTube 
podcast is a great way for people with an audio-only podcast to reach a new audi￾ence. And if you already have video content on YouTube, try out a podcast as a new 
medium for your current audience.
To check out YouTube podcasts, do the following:
1. Open a web browser on the desktop (or the YouTube app on a mobile 
device) and navigate to your favorite YouTube channel.
The ServiceNow Community channel is shown in Figure 1-8. Just below the

n Chapter 1, you become effectively hip as to what podcasting is all about. In 
this chapter, you start building a studio. Studios can come in a variety of shapes, 
sizes, and price tags. Podcasting is like any hobby you pursue. A modest setup 
with little to no investment is ideal if you want to see whether you like podcasting. 
However, if you find yourself tapping into a hidden passion or a hidden talent, you 
might want to upgrade to audio gear that’s bigger, better, and badder than the 
basics.
If you’re going with a simple setup, your next step is to pick up a digital recorder, 
read the instruction manual, and download some free audio-editing software. If 
you want an upgraded setup, it’s time to soundproof a room (watch HGN or the 
Magnolia Network for tips) and check out industry-standard equipment, which 
might require some homework to master.
In this chapter, we discuss the options, advantages, and disadvantages of each 
setup. We focus on audio and call out video where needed. (For more on setting up 
a video studio, see Chapters 15 and 16.)

Finding the Right Mic
Making your computer podcast-capable is easy and affordable. Your first order of 
business is to find the right mic. If you already have a microphone built into your 
laptop (and you don’t mind starting with the basics), just download Audacity 
(described in Chapter 3) and take advantage of the fact that it’s free. That’s all 
there is to it! For starters, anyway.
However, if your desktop computer didn’t come with a mic or you’re just not 
happy podcasting Quasimodo-style, you need to shop for a microphone. First, 
consider the following:
» What’s your price range? You get what you pay for in quality of construction 
and range of capabilities. You want the most affordable model of microphone 
that will do the job for you and your podcast.
» Do you plan to use the mic primarily in the studio or on location? A high-end 
shock-mounted model isn’t the best choice for a walk in the park, and a wireless 
mic may not provide the quality of sound expected for an in-studio podcast. 
Before you purchase your mic, consider your podcasting location needs.
Many different types of microphones and microphone connections, or jacks,
are available. Some mics plug into mixers, and others connect directly to your 
computer’s USB port. If you start with an inexpensive mic, understand that 
you may not be able to plug it into an upgraded rig later. Similarly, if you 
upgrade to an XLR microphone (described in the next section), you may have 
to upgrade more than just your mic.
» What do you want the mic to do? Pick up sound? Yeah, okay, but what kind 
and in what surroundings? Some mics offer ease of handling for interviews, or 
are good at snagging specific outdoor sounds, or are better at capturing live 
music. You might need to consider multipurpose mics, guest mics, and 
on-location recording devices.
If you’re considering doing a video podcast, viewers may forgive bad video but 
are less tolerant of bad audio. When planning your budget, be sure to allocate 
enough for a good microphone.
Even after narrowing your options, so many microphones are on the market that 
the manufacturers, makes, and models might give you that kind of brain-freeze 
you get when you eat ice cream too quickly. In this section, we give you the low￾down on the mic that’s right for your budget and even make a few sound recom￾mendations along the way. Sound recommendations! Heh, Dad humor.
Did you know there’s a companion podcast for this book? Yeah, it’s Podcasting For 
Dummies: The Companion Podcast. In Season 5, Tee and Chuck talk at length about 
microphones, including testing several makes and models, comparing and 
contrasting the sound of each. To find out more about microphones, gadgets, and CHAPTER 2 Getting the Gadgets to Produce a Podcast 29

A beginner’s guide to mics
Over the years, the microphone market has seen the universal serial bus (USB) 
microphones go from a trendy tech gimmick to a state-of-the-art innovation that 
changes the way we record audio. While some hardcore audio pros still dismiss 
these devices for a variety of reasons, one consistency has remained concerning 
USB microphones: You simply plug it in and start recording. That’s it.
If you want to search for USB microphones online, be sure to include USB in your 
search terms because a search for just microphones can bring up many more alter￾natives, including video cameras, high-end mics (which we talk about next), and 
other devices that may be way out of your budget.
When it comes to reliability and versatility with USB mics, we’re all about the 
Logitech G microphones (https://pfdbook.link/logitechg). The Yeti GX, pic￾tured in Figure 2-1 and priced around $150, is a standout, providing crystal-clear 
audio in both monitoring and recording. It has everything you need for a starting 
microphone, including a desktop stand.
Once you plug in your mic or headset into a USB port and set up your audio prefer￾ences in your recording software, you’re all set for recording.
FIGURE 2-1:
The Yeti GX 
comes with its 
own stand (left) 
and special 
options for the 
Compass boom 
arm (right).30 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Most mic stands sit on the desktop and the mic rises up to meet your mouth, 
whereas a boom arm typically clamps to the desk and presents the mic from above. 
Figure 2-1, right, shows the Yeti GX attached to the Logitech G Compass boom 
arm. A boom arm is not only better for your posture but also clears up desk space 
for notes or additional devices. Find out more about this and other accessories at 
the end of this chapter.
USB microphones are quick and easy to set up, and are ideal for solo podcasters. If 
you’re planning to have your best friend as a co-host or in-studio guests, you’ll 
need a mixer (covered later in this chapter) or the free RØDE Connect software 
(https://pfdbook.link/rodeconnect), which supports up to four USB mics.
Investing in a high-end mic
For a rich, professional sound, you need to invest in an XLR microphone. XLR mics 
start at just under $100 and reach up to $20,000! (No, that’s not a typo.) So what 
defines a microphone? Price? Manufacturer? Look?
What truly defines a microphone is how you sound using it and how it reproduces 
the sound coming in. Plenty of high-quality microphones can pick up nuances and 
details and still remain affordable.
When you purchase a higher-end microphone, you probably will not receive cables 
for hookup, a jack that fits into your computer, or a stand. That’s because you’re 
upgrading to professional equipment, and the manufacturer assumes you want 
the flexibility to choose different bells and whistles, whatjamajigs, and extra doo￾dads to make the mic work. For the lowdown on what accessories you need to hook 
up your new mic to your computer, check out the “Accessorize! Accessorize! 
Accessorize!” section, at the end of the chapter.
Remember those three questions a few pages back? Question #2 — Do you plan to 
use the mic primarily in the studio or on location? — helps narrow your search even 
more for the microphone that’s the right investment for you. When working with 
broadcast-industry-standard equipment, people talk about two kinds of mics: 
dynamic mics and condenser mics. More on those next.
Dynamic mics
Dynamic mics are what you see everywhere from speaking engagements to rock 
concerts. In fact, when someone mentions the word microphone, the image that 
comes to mind is probably a dynamic microphone.
These mics work like a speaker in reverse. Sound entering a dynamic mic (by 
speaking directly into it) vibrates a diaphragm (a small plate) attached to a coil. 
The coil is located near a magnet, and the vibrations made by this Wile E. Coyote 
setup create a small electric current. When the signal runs through a preamp or CHAPTER 2 Getting the Gadgets to Produce a Podcast 31
mixer, the original sound is re-created. A dynamic microphone is designed to help 
get rid of background noise. As such, it requires a lot of volume from you to pro￾duce audio clearly. Some models are ruggedly built so they can be manhandled, 
making dynamic mics exceptional for outdoor recording.
If you’re working in-studio, consider one of Shure’s SM7B models. The original 
SM7B mic (see Figure 2-2, left) is a professional standard used in recording booths 
and many podcasts and live streams today around the world. This model offers a 
clean, rich sound and picks up incredible detail for a dynamic microphone. We’ve 
been using the SM7B for almost two decades, and it’s hard to imagine improving 
a microphone this good, but Shure did just that with the SM7dB (see Figure 2-2, 
right). This upgrade offers podcasters a built-in preamp providing up to +28 dB of 
gain while maintaining the original SM7B’s frequency response. If your current 
interface doesn’t need that extra kick, you can easily bypass the pre-amp with a 
flick of a switch.
Condenser mics
When podcasting happens in-studio and you’re looking for the subtleties and 
nuances of the human voice in your recording (the more detail you get, the 
better!), you may want to shop for a studio condenser microphone. In a condenser 
microphone, the diaphragm is suspended in front of a stationary plate that 
conducts electricity. As a signal enters the microphone, the air between the dia￾phragm and the plate is displaced, creating a fluctuating electrical charge. Once 
given a bit of phantom power (explained in the upcoming sidebar), the fluctuation 
becomes an electrical representation of the incoming audio signal.
This setup sounds delicate, doesn’t it? Guess what — it is! This is why condenser 
mics are transported in padded cases and are not built for handheld use. While 
dynamic mics can be used indoors or outdoors, condenser mics are best used for 
in-studio recordings. If manhandled or jostled, the plates can be knocked out of 
alignment or damaged, causing problems in the pickups.
FIGURE 2-2:
The Shure SM7B

industry, and the 
SM7dB (right) 
capture both high 
and low audio 
ranges, giving 
your podcast a 
polished edge.32 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
The advantage to this delicate setup is that condenser mics (such as the MXL 990, 
shown in Figure 2-3) are far more sensitive to sound and pick up a wider spectrum 
of audio. These microphones are so sensitive to noise around them that some 
come with shock mounts  — spring-loaded frames that suspend the mic when 
attached to a microphone stand, providing better stability while reducing noise or 
vibration from the stand. Think of a shock mount as a shock absorber for your mic.
THE PHANTOM (POWER) OF THE PODCAST
Some microphones require an extra boost called phantom power. Their connection to a 
mixer or pre-amp provides them with all the power they need to pick up and capture 
audio. Phantom power supplies a constant boost to microphones, unlike the battery in 
a battery-powered model, which begins to lose recording capability when the batteries 
start to die. (If you’re using a battery-powered microphone, a word to the wise: Always 
keep fresh batteries on hand and check your mic’s battery level before you record. 
Similar considerations about your batteries should be taken when you’re using a 
portable recorder as a pre-amp, covered in Chapter 4.)
FIGURE 2-3:

Tee is a big fan of MXL microphones (https://pfdbook.link/mxlmics). His first 
in-studio microphone was an MXL 990, a model he still uses. In addition to being 
affordable, reliable, and popular, MXL microphones often are included with pod￾cast bundles (described in the upcoming “Bundling Up” sidebar). Online vendors 
such as BSW, Adorama Camera, Sweetwater Sound, and Zzounds offer podcast 
bundles with a mic, a stand, cables, headphones — and sometimes a mixer.
Although dynamic microphones are marketed more for on-location recording and 
condenser mics are considered best for in-studio recording, these aren’t hard￾and-fast rules. Podcasters occasionally use condenser mics in outdoor settings, 
and some podcasters prefer the sound of dynamic mics in the studio. When choos￾ing a microphone, you want a mic that not only suits your needs but also makes 
you sound good. Really good.
For multi-mic podcasts in the same location, consider dynamic microphones. If 
you plan to have a studio with a few friends over as guests, the sensitivity of sev￾eral condenser microphones can be a liability and will degrade the overall sound of 
your podcast. The sound from one person’s voice will be picked up not only on 
their mic but also on the other mics as a distant sound. Overall, it will sound like 
everyone is talking into a single microphone across the room, like one of those bad 
conference room calls with the mic in the center of the table. Listeners will find if 
very distracting.
With the microphones just described, podcasters have options to record studio￾quality audio with or without an additional audio card, a mixer, or any of the go￾betweens once considered essential for connecting audio gear to a computer. With 
some of these options, your podcast production can also become portable. (Mobile 
options are given a closer look in Chapter 4.)
BUNDLING UP
While many microphones offer a single-purchase solution for podcasters, the 
microphone itself is not the only thing you need. Maybe you need a stand? What about 
a longer cable to accommodate your home studio? You could put together a list of 
accessories that you need, or you could follow the lead taken by a few audio vendors 
and look at the bundles they offer.
Logitech G offers the Yeticaster (https://pfdbook.link/yeticaster) as a complete 
solution when you’re ready to upgrade to a professional line of USB mics. The Yeticaster 
features the Yeti microphone (a terrific model with various pickup options and yielding 
clean, crisp results), a Radius III shock mount designed for Yeti models, and the

Podcasts Well with Others: 
The Mixing Board
If you want to have co-hosts on your podcast, connect additional audio input 
sources, or entertain guests in your home studio, you need more than just a single 
good microphone. More people or devices in a podcast call for more audio inputs, 
Compass microphone boom arm (refer to Figure 2-1, right), with hidden-channel cable 
management.
MXL has put together the Overstream bundle (https://pfdbook.link/overstream), 
available in either Blaze (red) or Blizzard (blue) options. The bundle includes the MXL 
990, a shock mount with integrated pop filter, a Mic Mate Pro (described in the 
“Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!” section, at the end of the chapter), and a boom 
arm ready for mounting on a table or desk. With the Mic Mate Pro, the 990 can be either 
a USB mic or an XLR mic, depending on your needs.
Take a look at the different bundles that vendors are now putting together for 
microphones, headphones, and mixers. You may find that one purchase will be all 
you need to get started.
(continued)CHAPTER 2 Getting the Gadgets to Produce a Podcast 35
as well as full control over these additional sources. You’ll want to invest in a mix￾ing board, which increases your recording options (such as multiple hosts or 
guests) and enables you to incorporate acoustic instruments or prerecorded audio 
segments as well as balance sound to emphasize one voice over another or balance 
both seamlessly.
You see mixers at rock concerts and in behind-the-scenes documentaries about 
the film and recording industry. Mixers give podcasters more versatility in what 
and how they record, and they come in a variety of sizes and costs. You might see 
a mixer small and compact enough to fit on the corner of a desk, and then you see 
a mixer like Chuck Tomasi’s TASCAM DM-4800 in Figure 2-4, where the mixer 
board is the desk and can beam Captain Pike and his Away Team back onboard the 
Enterprise in case of any surprise Gorn attacks.
Before you take your mixer out of its packaging, make sure you have room for it 
on the desk or general area where you intend to podcast. Consider how close you 
want to be to the mixer; an ideal reach for your mixer is a short one. Whether 
you’re recording yourself or balancing the levels of those around you, clear off a 
section of your desk within a relaxed reach. You’ll be happier because of it.

The anatomy of a mixing board
The easiest way to understand what a mixing board does for your podcast is to 
think of it as a way to partition your computer into different recording studios. But 
instead of calling them studios, these partitions are called channels.
A mixing board provides mono channels and stereo channels, and you can use any 
of these channels for the input or output of audio signals. No matter the make or 
model, mixing boards are outrageously versatile. If you’re podcasting with a few 
friends, you can hook up multiple mics through a mixer so you won’t have to hud￾dle around the same microphone or slide it back and forth as you take turns 
speaking. And the mixer enables you to adjust the audio levels of multiple inputs 
independently so the sound is even.
You may be wondering about all those wacky knobs on a mixing board. Some 
knobs deal with various frequencies in your voice and can deepen, sharpen, or 
soften those qualities, and perhaps even help filter out surrounding background 
noise (which is the sound of an empty room because even in silence, there is 
noise). The knobs that are your primary concern are the ones that control your 
volume, or levels, as the board labels them. The higher the level, the more input 
signal your voice gains when recording. If one of your channels is being used for 
output, the level dictates the loudness of the playback through your headphones.
Heavy-metal legend Spinal Tap may prefer sound equipment that “goes to 11,” but 
cranking your mixing board way up and leaving it that way won’t do your podcast 
much good. The best way to handle sound is to set your levels before podcasting. 
That’s what’s going on when you see roadies at a concert do a mic check. The oh￾so-familiar “check one, check two, check-check-check” is one way of setting your 
levels, but a better method is just rambling on as if you were podcasting and then 
adjusting your sound levels according to your recording application’s volume unit 
(VU) meter. For more on setting levels, hop to Chapter 7 for all the details.
ANALOG VERSUS DIGITAL
If you go shopping for a mixer, you’ll see many types starting at roughly $70 and others, 
some with the same number of inputs, at five to ten times the cost. What gives?
Before rushing off and making a purchase you may regret later, you should 
understand the two major types of mixers: analog and digital. Analog mixers have 
the benefit of being simple to set up, configure, and in the case of those with USB 
interfaces — yes, analog mixers can have digital outputs — easy to connect. The 
drawback is that their configuration is hard-wired and any additional signal 
processing must be done with additional hardware.CHAPTER 2 Getting the Gadgets to Produce a Podcast 37
Hooking up a mixer to your computer
Now that you have cleaned your desk (mind the dust bunnies!) and have decided 
where to put the mixer, it’s time to set it up. The mixer we work with in this book 
is a podcaster’s bestest buddy. The mixer makes sure you have a place to crash if 
you’re too tired to drive home after a marathon of horror movies. The mixer is 
your producer, handling all the tech stuff so you can focus on content and the tal￾ent. The mixer always has your back, no matter what.
What kind of processing, you ask? Compression may be needed to bring up low spots 
and dampen loud spots, or you might need a gate that can set a threshold (a minimal 
noise level) before audio gets through to the mixer. These features help clean up the 
audio but are not mandatory.
Digital mixers take the input from a microphone, instrument, or other device and turn it 
into a digital signal inside the mixer. Digital mixers often have on-board compressors 
and gates for each channel and complex input and output routing configuration. Most 
podcasters don’t need this level of sophistication, but Chuck Tomasi isn’t most people. 
He currently uses a Behringer X32 rack-mounted mixer (shown here) to free up desk 
space and control remotely with an iPad.
In the case of mixers, you get what you pay for. Inexpensive mixers often have inferior 
audio output because of cheap pre-amps or other components. They are often poorly 
constructed and don’t last as long. For something that sits on the desk, it’s amazing how 
much abuse a mixer can take. When considering how much to spend, use the same rule 
with mixers as with computers — get as much as you can afford. Having a professional 
microphone with a low-end mixer can put your overall quality at risk.38 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Can you tell we really love this mixer?
The RØDECaster Pro II (https://pfdbook.link/rodecaster2) from RØDE, pic￾tured in Figure 2-5, is a mixer board with plenty of add-ons to take your podcast 
in a plethora of directions, including video. You may do a double take at its price 
tag ($700), but consider that the RØDECaster is a
» 9-channel mixer ($250-$500)
» Stereo headphone amplifier ($35-$80)
» Sound effects board ($30-$125)
» Control board for optional scene changes ($130-$250)
Even on the lower end of features, the Rødecaster performs the job of four com￾ponents in one sleek device.

Once you unpack your RØDECaster, make sure you have the following in front 
of you:
» USB mixer
» Power supply
» USB-C fast data transfer cable
If you are in need of a USB-C cable, whether to replace the one you got with your 
mixer or because your setup requires a longer cable, make sure to pick up a USB-C 
cable that can transfer 20-40GBps of data. Because we’re working with audio (and 
potentially video), fast data transfer is essential.
USB mixers, be they RØDECaster or another make and model, have a similar setup. 
Regardless of where you fall in the Mac versus PC debate, you should be able to 
follow these steps to hook up your mixer board:
1. Connect the power supply to the back of the mixer and to an available 
wall socket or power strip.
2. Plug your mixer-appropriate cable into an available USB-C port on your 
computer.
If your computer’s ports are maxed out, we recommend investing in a card 
that gives your computer additional USB ports. Don’t run a digital mixer 
through a hub; doing so will affect the audio quality or you may not have 
enough power to run the mixer.
To find USB adapters that can handle the transfer of data from your mixer, 
check places that sell electronics accessories. Check the documentation to 
confirm that the cable and USB port you’re using are built for high-speed data 
transfer.
3. Plug the other end of the USB-C cable into the back of your mixer.
4. Connect your input devices (microphones, headphones, monitors, and 
the like) to the mixer.
5. Power up your mixer by turning on the main and phantom power 
switches.
6. Follow any steps to update and install the drivers and manufacturer’s 
software that your USB mixer needs.
Once up and running, the RØDECaster will automatically check for any 
necessary downloads (drivers, upgrades to firmware, patches, and so on) to 
keep your mixer up to speed.40 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
7. Set up your audio-editing software to recognize your mixer as your audio 
input and output.
For example, in Adobe Audition, you can set the input of individual channels 
to pick up signals from your RØDECaster’s individual channels, as shown in 
Figure 2-6.
And that’s it! You’re ready to mix and record with your USB mixer. With head￾phones on and some toying around, you can set levels, grant priority to one 
incoming signal, and create a balanced audio stage for your podcast.
Getting a grasp of how things work on your mixer makes you a better podcaster, 
so keep online user guides bookmarked and reference manuals close by. Set aside 
a few pockets of time to get to know how your mixer works. By doing so, you’ll 
understand options such as Mix to Control Room rather than “that button that 
needs to be down when I record.”

Listen Up: Headphones
Whether you’re flying solo or will have other people joining your podcast, head￾phones are essential, perhaps even more important than the microphone. When 
Tee entered the podcast arena, he was advised to “Get good headphones before 
you get a good microphone.” More than 15 years later, that is still sage advice. 
Good headphones help you monitor yourself as you speak, and by hearing your 
voice, you can catch any trip-ups, slurred words, or missed pronunciations before 
playback. You can also pick up unwanted sounds and remove them from the 
recording space.
The best noise reduction and elimination happens before and during recording, 
not afterward.
Another advantage of good headphones is better sound reproduction. Regardless 
of the quality of your speakers, internal or external, headphones will always reveal 
more detail. In this section, we look at three different sets of headphones. Whether 
you purchase one of these models or something else, the following features should 
be present:
» Closed-back or over-ear design: Some headphones rest on the outside of 
your ears. Or in the case of earbuds, the speakers are inside your ears. 
Closed-back or over-ear headphones encompass your ear, offering a better 
representation of what open-air listening will be while allowing you a chance 
to catch any audio hiccups or unwanted background noise.
» No noise-cancelling option: Higher-end stereo headphones promise the 
highest quality for audio listening. Note that we say listening — not recording 
and editing. Noise-cancelling headphones are terrific for listening to audio, but 
are not the best option for recording and editing because you want to be able 
to hear the noise that these headphones cancel out so you can eliminate it 
before a word is recorded. So for best results, avoid noise-cancelling features.
» Wide frequency response: Here’s where we dip our toe into the technical 
weeds. When it comes to frequency response, the wider the better. The 
average audio range of a set of headphones — the range of loudest to 
softest sounds and base, treble, and mid-range audio — lands between 
20Hz to 20 kHz.
So, what options are out there for podcasters?
The SRH440A headphones from Shure are a fantastic investment for a starting or 
experienced podcaster because they offer all the audio quality you would expect 
from Shure but at an affordable price of $99. (Remember, Shure makes the banger 
SM7dB microphone mentioned earlier in this chapter.) Offering an impressive 42 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
frequency response with accurate audio for podcasting and content creation, the 
SRH440As, shown in Figure  2-7, left, makes monitoring and editing easy and 
comfortable, even after wearing them for hours at a time. A detail like comfort 
matters, especially if you’re like Tee, who loses track of time when editing or live 
streaming.
Tee is happy with his SRH440As, but the RØDE NTH-100 leveled up his headphone 
game. Priced at $149, the NTH-100 (see Figure 2-7, right) yield audio quality on 
par with Shure’s SRH440As, but little details make a difference. For example, the 
NTH-100 has two cable jacks, one on the left and another on the right, so Tee no 
longer has a cable running across his lap. Plus, after hours of both audio and video 
editing, Tee got up for a stretch and forgot he was wearing headphones; he had 
never worn headphones that featured Alcantara cushions with CoolTech gel. 
Sounds indulgent? Maybe, but now he shares these with only his wife . . . and 
that’s because he has to.
FIGURE 2-7:

SRH440As (left) 
and the RØDE

both share ideal 
characteristics for

headphones.
WHAT ABOUT BLUETOOTH?
When Tee and Chuck discussed the possibility of working with Bluetooth headphones, 
they were concerned about latency. There should be no lag between when you speak 
and when the computer (or mixer) processes the speech and the connected head￾phones monitor the speech in real time (you are monitoring yourself, right?). Even 
hearing your voice a half second after you speak can short-circuit your brain. Trying 
to talk when hearing your thoughts on delay is a whole new level of irritating.
Tee put this concern to the test by using the Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed headset, 
shown here, alongside its hardwired counterparts. With a Bluetooth transmitter 
plugged into his RØDECaster Pro, Tee had the headset paired up and ready to go. 
Myth confirmed: Latency in Bluetooth headphones is a feature, not a bug. Deeper CHAPTER 2 Getting the Gadgets to Produce a Podcast 43
Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!
A microphone (or microphones), a mixing board, and a good set of headphones 
serve as the foundation of your studio. You now need to add the final touches, as 
Martha Stewart and her bestie, Snoop Dogg, would no doubt tell you if they were 
helping with this process. When it comes to accessories, Martha might make sug￾gestions like a doily for the mic stand or a sweet, hand-knitted cover for that 
RØDECaster. Snoop might offer up a killer brownie recipe, but we digress . . .
When we talk about accessories, we have something different in mind. Here are 
some optional add-ons that can help you produce a rock solid podcast:
» Cables: Your newfangled microphone may arrive without cables, and buying 
the wrong cable can be easy if you don’t know jack (so to speak). So check the 
mic’s connector before you buy.
research revealed that all Bluetooth headphones face a latency problem when 
recording and monitoring in real time and are best avoided.
So when it comes to listening to audio, the Pro X 2 Lightspeeds are very nice. For 
recording? Not so much. Stick with those hardwired options.44 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
With many high-end mics, the connectors are usually a three-prong connection 
called a three-pin XLR plug. To plug a microphone into your mixer, you want to 
specify a three-pin XLR-to-XLR male-to-female cord. The female end connects to the 
mic, and the male end connects to the mixer. These cables begin at $9 and work 
their way up, depending on the cord length and the quality of the inputs.
» Adapters: If you go with a mic that has an XLR connection and want to plug it 
directly into your computer (as opposed to going through a mixer), you’ll need 
an XLR-to-USB adapter. You have options from cables to dedicated boxes to 
all-in-one adapters. Prices range from $13 for a simple cable to thousands of 
dollars for dedicated hardware. For quality and compactness, our favorites 
are the Shure MVX2U (around $130) and the MXL Mic Mate Pro (around $100).
» Microphone stands: On receiving a microphone and possibly its shock mount, 
you may notice an attachment for a mic stand but no mic stand (unless you 
bought the Logitech G Yeti GX). A desktop mic stand (see Figure 2-8, left) is the 
most basic setup and costs about $10. Another way to secure your mic is the 
boom mic arm such as the Rode PSA1 boom arm (see Figure 2-8, right), which 
costs about $100. While the boom mic arm is more expensive, it frees up desk 
space and helps you avoid bad posture when recording. (Yes, posture does 
matter in the studio.) If you’re on a tight budget in the beginning, though, a 
basic desktop stand will provide a stable base for your microphone.

» Pop filters and windscreens: You can go to any music store and ask for a 
windscreen (see Figure 2-9, left) and a pop filter (see Figure 2-9, right), accesso￾ries that will help in capturing clean audio. Both devices can help soften 
explosive consonants (percussive ones such as B and P) during a recording 
session. A windscreen can also reduce ambient room noise. These mic 
accessories may seem like an indulgence, but they really make a difference 
in recording.
DIY tutorials on YouTube and elsewhere show how to make pop filters with a 
stick and pantyhose. Just remember: You get what you pay for. With the time, 
experimentation, and jury-rigging to save $10-$20, it’s less stress to just go 
and pick up a proper pop filter.

Building Your Podcast’s 
Digital Workstation
After you have your recording equipment in place, plugged in, and running, 
it’s time to take a look at audio-editing software packages. These applica￾tions help you take that block of audio marble and chisel the podcast hid￾den within.
If you want to podcast video, check out Chapter 16, where we cover streaming 
content and how it fits into the podcasting workflow.
As with digital photo editors, video-editing software, and word processors, digital 
audio workstations (DAWs) come in all sizes and all costs, ranging from free to 
roughly an entire paycheck (or three). Like any software package, the lower the 
cost, the simpler the product and the easier it is to understand, navigate, and use 
for recording. However, as the software grows more complex (and expensive), the 
features that offer professional-level results become abundantly clear. In this 
chapter, we run down some of the audio-recording and audio-editing software 
that may be right for you.

Budget-Friendly (aka Free) One-Size￾Fits-All Software: Audacity
Whoever said “You can’t get something for nothing” didn’t know about podcast￾ing. It’s amazing what kind of production you can create with little or no mone￾tary investment.
Audacity (https://pfdbook.link/audacity), shown in Figure 3-1, was designed 
by the open-source community, who simply wanted to give back something cool 
to the internet. The software quickly became a podcaster’s best friend. It’s easy to 
see why: It is free, simple to use, and safe to download, and it provides a common 
starting point for new podcasters.
Audacity has earned a reputation as the must-have tool for recording voice straight 
off a computer. You can use it to import, export, mix, and edit audio. It’s also com￾patible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. (We want to send a big thank-you to the 
volunteers who went out of their way to show that software can be made available 
for any platform, provided the creators are driven enough to make it happen!)
What exactly can Audacity do for free? Quite a bit, actually:
» Record live audio through microphones or mixer channels
» Record up to 16 channels at once
FIGURE 3-1:
Audacity is an 
open-source 
application that 
allows you to edit 
audio and create 
MP3 files.CHAPTER 3 Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation 49
» Import various sound formats for editing and remixing
» Export final projects to WAV, AIFF, MP3s, and many other audio formats
» Grant the user unlimited undo and redo commands
» Create an unlimited number of audio tracks
» Remove static, hiss, hum, and other constant background noises
» Provide a wide variety of effects to manipulate your audio (and these effects 
are expandable via third-party plug-ins)
» Record at an audio quality up to 384 kHz
Audacity is an excellent piece of software for the basics, and now the creators offer 
a new suite of options for your audio content. Muse Hub (https://pfdbook.link/
musehub), which is shown in Figure 3-2, is a free desktop app for macOS, Win￾dows, and Linux that brings together Audacity alongside MuseScore 4 and Tone￾bridge. While Audacity offers the basics of audio editing, Muse Hub opens the door 
for more creative options, all available from one location:
» Free looping sound clips, all podcast-safe and stream-safe for your productions
» Muse FX plug-ins, including reverb, delay, and many more extras not found in 
the base version of Audacity
» Premium-level sampled instruments, including piano, strings, brass, wood￾wind, percussion, choirs, and genre beds ranging from country to rock to EDM
FIGURE 3-2:
Muse Hub is your 
single location for 
everything you 
need to create 
incredible audio 
compositions.50 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
The open-source teams behind Audacity and Muse Hub plan to include more 
functionality and features, so expect continued support and innovations. Between 
the easy audio-editing features of Audacity and Muse Hub’s original, royalty-free 
audio samples, it’s a breeze to set your own themes and special effects.
Creating your own music is a lot of fun but can easily soak up free time that you 
would normally dedicate to recording. If you need to get in touch with your inner 
Mozart, set aside a good-size pocket of time to put together your desired riffs. You 
have many options to choose from; as with podcasting, it’s best not to rush the 
process.
Commercial Audio Software
If you’re lucky enough to have a bit more budget to build your podcasting studio, 
this section on software is for you. A majority of podcasts use a bare-bones plan, 
and so far the investment in the hardware and software we’ve recommended (in 
Chapter 2) is for a budget under $500. However, if you have higher goals for doing 
a podcast for your business or perhaps podcasting is your business, we offer some 
higher-end commercial options for your audio-editing software to get the best 
possible sound quality.
You may hear podcasters say “Content is king,” meaning it doesn’t matter how 
good you sound if you don’t have anything to say. There’s a second part to that 
phrase “and quality is queen,” meaning it doesn’t matter what you say if no one 
can understand you.
For a corporate entity, government agency, or professional organization ventur￾ing into podcasting, sound quality is crucial because the public is assessing their 
reputation. Commercial podcasting demands nothing less than the best in audio 
quality, and that is what investments in professional software bring to your pro￾duction. From noise reduction to production parameters required for services such 
as Audible and Spotify, high-end audio software gives you full control over every 
aspect of the audio you’re recording.
Adobe Audition
At one time, a favorite software application was CoolEdit. But when Adobe 
Systems purchased it and repackaged the software as Adobe Audition (shown in 
Figure  3-3), it got even better. Audition (http://pfdblook.link/audition) is 
offered as a standalone product for $22.99 per month or as part of the Adobe 
Creative Cloud membership for $59.99 per month.CHAPTER 3 Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation 51
Audition’s features are nothing short of awesome:
» Makes up to 128 tracks available to the user
» Records up to 32 different sources simultaneously
» Supplies 50 digital sound effects to enhance your audio tracks
» Provides 5,000 royalty-free loops that can be easily edited and compiled to 
create your own music for your intro/outro, background music, transitions, 
and other branding
» Supports Surround Encoder for 5.1 surround-sound mixing for audio only or 
integration with an Adobe Premiere Pro project
» Offers audio restoration tools such as click and pop eliminators and noise 
reduction that can restore recordings from vinyl and cassette recordings, 
remedy pops, hisses, and hums, and fix clipped audio
What makes Audition so appealing is how the app grants you full control over 
pitch, wavelength, time stretching, background-noise removal, and Dolby 5.1 
stereo output, making this DAW a staple in the digital audio industry. Available for 
Windows and Mac platforms, Adobe Audition offers your podcast a professional 
polish. If you’re ready to make the investment and the jump to higher-grade soft￾ware, Audition may be the option for you.

Apple Logic Pro X
Apple Logic Pro X (https://pfdbook.link/logicpro) is another software pack￾age carving out a place for itself with professionals. Designed to be the next step 
after GarageBand, Logic Pro X has features built for Mac-based podcasters:
» Supports multitrack recording.
» Displays multiple audio takes in a single window. After you select your desired 
takes, Logic Pro X compiles them — complete with crossfades (the simultane￾ous fading from one audio source into another) — for seamless playback.
» Copies audio effects and EQ settings from another clip — setting them on an 
audio clipboard for quick access and application or saving them as a preset 
for future use.
» Features specific functions for producing podcasts, such as ID3 tagging.
» Outputs multitrack audio projects into 5.1 surround sound.
» Offers multiple audio formats for export, including WAV, AIFF, and 
many others.
Logic Pro X offers incredible options for the audio professional and the 
up-and-coming podcaster. For $200 from the App Store, you can accomplish a lot 
with it.
Gluing It Together with RSS
The hardware (mics and mixer) and the software (such as Audition or Audacity) 
are necessary to record audio and create a podcast media file. That’s the fun and 
creative part. But to make your recording a podcast, you need to get your hands 
dirty on the tedious and technical parts and add one more three-letter acronym to 
your vocabulary: RSS.
Since the first edition in 2005, we’ve helped a huge number of podcasters get 
started  — and in nearly every case, the RSS step is the biggest source of 
confusion.
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a file format built on XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language), which is a markup language like HTML (the building blocks of the 
internet). XML enables systems such as computers, network devices, and other 
gadgets to exchange information in a structured format. The RSS file is a bit of 
information that the podcaster publishes so others can use their podcatching 
software to check for new content automatically.CHAPTER 3 Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation 53
If that somewhat technical explanation doesn’t do it for you, try this old-school 
analogy about deliverable content. Consider journalists for publications such as 
The Washington Post, The New York Times, Vanity Fair, or Wired Magazine as authori￾ties on what’s happening in life. Whether the subject matter covers Apple com￾puters, the Boston Red Sox, or Taylor Swift, you know that these journalists are 
trusted experts in their field or maybe fellow fans.
Good journalists create new and unique content with every issue or publication. 
And to get that content, you can check the newsstand or subscribe and have the 
content delivered. In this example, media created by the podcaster replaces the 
magazine or newspaper, and RSS is the delivery mechanism for those that 
subscribe.
As a podcaster, your job is to make sure you keep the RSS updated and current 
each time you post a new podcast media file. Lucky for you (and us too), plenty of 
software solutions make this step a breeze.
If you’re looking to spend the least amount of time hand-coding an RSS feed, a 
blog is a great way to include information about each episode and the audio file 
itself. Easy to set up and often free, blogs make the process of generating and 
updating RSS feeds insanely easy by doing it automatically.
You can choose from dozens of blog software packages (also called engines), each 
with a variety of bells and whistles designed to make your updates (including your 
RSS feed) as easy and customizable as possible. For a crash course in how blogs do 
SPLITTING HAIRS: WHAT DEFINES 
A PODCAST
Some people think that if they post media on a blog or a website and add a podcast
graphic, they’re podcasting media. Others think that if they record a snappy show about 
a favorite topic and post it on YouTube, they have a podcast. Then there are the old￾timer podcasters who shake their fists at a passing cloud, screaming “If it doesn’t have 
RSS, it’s not a podcast!”
The tricky thing about this ongoing debate is that podcasting has evolved. Streaming 
content can be consumed on mobile devices, laptops, and desktop computers and then 
circulated through blogs, communication apps such as Discord, and various social 
media platforms. The lines that define a podcast are blurring. For the sake of this book, 
we define a podcast as a delivery of media from your studio to a consumer by using 
RSS. A podcast happens when you have these three elements in place: a website or 
blog, some form of media, and an accompanying RSS feed to deliver said media.54 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
what they do, check out Blogging For Dummies, 7th Edition, by Amy Lupold Bair. 
Her book can help you choose which blog engine might be right for you. Mean￾while, here are a few options we prefer:
» WordPress (https://pfdbook.link/wordpress): Perhaps the most popular 
blogging solution, WordPress has many advantages over other free blogs. Not 
only is it easy to install and get running, but it also supports podcasting out of 
the box. When you incorporate the PowerPress plug-in (https://pfdbook.
link/powerpress), you’re provided with a new level of user-friendly options. In 
addition, you can use thousands of WordPress and user-developed templates 
as-is or customize them to fit the look and feel for your podcast. And it’s free.
To make incorporation into your website seamless, many hosting companies 
such as DreamHost (https://pfdbook.link/dreamhost) and GoDaddy 
(https://pfdbook.link/godaddy) offer packages with WordPress preinstalled 
or installed with a one-click option. Figure 3-4 shows the WordPress signup page.
If you choose to go the WordPress route, pay particular attention to the 
web address. There’s Wordpress.org and Wordpress.com. The .org flavor 
IT’S ALL ABOUT THE <ENCLOSURE>, BABY
If you have a blog, you’re already generating an RSS feed. Although podcast apps can 
read your RSS feed, the feed needs to include the <enclosure> tag for podcasting 
to work.
Dave Winer invented the <enclosure> tag in early 2001 to embed in an RSS feed links 
to large audio, video, or other rich media elements. At the time, Dave and Adam Curry 
were trying to solve the click-and-wait problems inherent in big files such as audio and 
video. Back then, if a user clicked a link to a 30MB file, several minutes would drag by 
before the file was downloaded to the user’s hard drive and made available. Not a good 
user experience, regardless of what’s in the file.
With the advent of the <enclosure> RSS element, users could subscribe to places 
where they expected large files regularly and move the file downloading to the early 
hours, when they were snug in bed and a 10-minute download was no big deal.
However, users back then had to be technically savvy to take advantage of this new RSS 
element. It wasn’t until the summer of 2004 that Adam Curry wrote what most consider 
the first podcatching client — a simple, user-friendly desktop program that extracted 
enclosed media files from RSS 2.0 feeds. And behold! Podcasting was born.CHAPTER 3 Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation 55
is where you can download the software and install it on your server of 
choice — this option involves a bit of technical work. The .com site has the 
software already installed and you just configure it; however, the configura￾tion options are more limited.
You have two basic options regarding where to put your blog, and prices and 
products vary from vendor to vendor. In a nonhosted model blog, you get to 
choose the blog engine, a great option if you want to use a specific engine. 
However, setting up and maintaining the blog involves more work. The other 
option, the hosted model, keeps things simple and chooses the blog engine for 
you. The trade-off for flexibility is ease-of-use.
» LibSyn (https://pfdbook.link/libsyn): Don’t be surprised if LibSyn 
(Liberated Syndication) turns up a lot in this book. Still going strong after 
launching in 2004, LibSyn is a combined blog/hosting company designed for 
podcasting. Although it may not address all your needs, its ease of use and 
all-in-one nature should not be dismissed. Some podcasters use LibSyn as 
their hosted solution; others use it to store their podcast files while their blog 
is on a non-hosted solution somewhere else. Either way, we think LibSyn’s 
pricing is quite reasonable, starting at $5 per month.

» Podbean (https://pfdbook.link/podbean): Another popular all-in-one 
option with the added support of a podcast directory optimized for mobile 
devices, Podbean combines online hosting packages, podcast publishing 
tools, and crowdfunding services. Podbean, both in its website and mobile 
app, offers a user-friendly interface integrating feed and media management, 
syndication, and analytics, along with promotion through popular social 
media platforms such as Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). All this is available 
through affordable, flat-rate hosting plans. If you want to start with baby steps 
and take a deeper dive into podcasting later, Podbean is the right option for 
you and your podcast.
When you have software and hardware in place, test your setup to make sure 
everything works. Take a look at your application’s preferences so that your sound 
input and output are going through your mixer, bring up the volume on the chan￾nel on the mixing board that your microphone is connected to, and then listen to 
yourself through your headphones. Just make sure everything is running as 
expected so you can jump right in and get recording.
Podcast Management 101
Unless you already have hosting taken care of, you’re going to need a place on the 
web to put your podcast media files, RSS feed, and show notes. You also need a 
way to get them there.
Finding hosting providers is a breeze, with hundreds of companies all vying for 
your precious, hard-earned money. The good news is that this competition has 
brought down the cost of hosting packages significantly. The bad news is that you 
have to go through a lot of clutter to reach the right selection.
This section covers the basic needs for most beginning podcasts and mentions 
a few pitfalls. In Chapter  10, we get into the process of moving your files to 
your host.
Don’t rush into a hosting agreement just yet. We suggest reading the rest of this 
chapter as well as Chapter 10 before forking over your credit card. We cover lots of 
good information that can help you narrow your choices.
When you’re comparing hosting plans, try not to get bogged down in the number 
of email addresses, MySQL databases, subdomains, and the like. As a podcaster, 
you have only two worries: how many podcasts the site can hold and how much 
bandwidth you get.CHAPTER 3 Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation 57
Size does matter
Podcast media files are big. Unlike bloggers, podcasters eat up server space. Where 
simple text files and a few images take up a relatively small space, podcast media 
files tend to be in the 5MB to 50MB range. And that’s just for audio.
Here some suggestions for zeroing in on what you need for storage space:
» Think about how many podcasts you want to keep online and plan accord￾ingly. However, if your plan has unlimited storage space, you don’t need to 
worry about it.
» Consider the amount of server space you’ll need to host your blogging 
software, databases, text, and image files. For example, if Tee wants to keep 
all episodes of The Shared Desk, The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences, and Happy 
Hour from the Tower online, he will easily need several gigabytes of space, as 
one of these shows first went online in 2010.
Podcasters should look for hosting plans that include at least 3GB of storage space. 
As of this writing, several host providers charge less than $10 per month for at 
least that much space.
Bandwidth demystified
Of equal importance to storage space is bandwidth, an elusive and often￾misunderstood attribute of web hosting that is critical to podcasters. Bandwidth
refers to the online space needed to handle the amount of stuff you push out of 
your website every month. The bigger the files and the more requests for the files, 
the more bandwidth consumed.
For instance, the bandwidth for Chuck Tomasi’s Technorama can be over 100GB a 
month — that’s impressive. Why so huge? Chuck and his co-host Kreg just cele￾brated their 750th episode. They’ve been podcasting since the beginning. At their 
launch, the amount of information exchanged (read: downloads) and the demands 
on bandwidth were modest, but both have increased with the rise in the show’s 
popularity (thanks to top-shelf interviews with people in the science and enter￾tainment industries). In situations like this, web hosts must consider when it’s 
time to upgrade to a larger bandwidth package to handle a show — and that means 
more cash outlay.
And therein lies the double-edged sword of success. Most podcasters want more 
listeners, and that means more podcatching clients requesting the podcast media 
files. Bottom line: The more popular your show gets, the more bandwidth will be 
consumed every month.58 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
To simplify, pretend that you produce one show each week, and your show requires 
10MB of bandwidth. You publish the show on Monday, and your 100 subscribers 
receive your show that evening. You’ve just consumed 1000MB of bandwidth (100 ×
10MB) for that week. But next week, more people have found out about your amaz￾ing show, and now you have 200 subscribers. Next Monday, your bandwidth 
increases to 2000MB, which gets added to your previous week’s total to bring you 
up to 3000MB. The new listeners were so happy, they also download the previous 
week’s show, tacking on an extra 1000MB.  You’ve just consumed 4000MB (or 
4GB) of bandwidth for the month. You still have two weeks to go in the month, and 
if your numbers continue to climb like this, you’ll be burning through bandwidth 
(and your web host budget) quickly!
As a general rule, the longer your podcast episodes, the more bandwidth you’ll 
need. If you find a plan that offers unlimited bandwidth, the problem is solved. 
Otherwise, find a plan that’s high in the gigabytes. If you have a podcast that’s 
both long and popular, start looking at plans that offer 1TB (terabyte) or more.
You have ways to avoid the issue of bandwidth or at least make it less of a concern 
even if you have large ambitions. Chapter 10 talks about some podcast-specific 
and advanced hosting options. Even if you don’t think you’ll have to worry about 
bandwidth, pay close attention to this topic because you’ll likely be more popular 
and perhaps wordier than you think.CHAPTER 4 Go, Go, Power Podcasters! 59

Up to this point, you’ve been building your podcast studio with a home 
computer as the center of the digital audio workstation. You should have a 
mixer with a few mics plugged in and the software up and running. Or 
maybe you have a USB mic hooked up to a desktop computer (directly, not through 
a USB hub), and Audacity primed and ready to go. Welcome to your new recording 
studio. If “What about the video components?” just popped to the forefront of 
your brain, stand by. We cover this topic in Chapter 15.
In this chapter, we spend some quality time talking about portability: packing up 
your studio and podcasting on location.
When you work remotely, test your setup to make sure everything works. Look at 
your system settings to ensure that you’re working with the proper sound input 
and output sources, check that your levels are solid, and run a quick sound check 
through your headphones. Then, when you know that everything is running as 
expected, you can jump right in and start recording.

Podcasting with Your Laptop
In Chapter 2 we talk about creating a simple podcast rig by connecting a USB mic 
to your laptop. That’s a good start, but if you want to create a podcast with studio￾quality sound and you have more than one microphone and want some control over 
the levels, it’s time to invest in a preamplifier, or preamp for short. To understand 
what a preamp is, you need to learn a few technical details about microphones.
Microphones, be they condenser or dynamic, record their signals at mic level,
which is the signal created when the internal diaphragm moves back and forth 
against a magnet in a wire coil, generating an electrical signal. It’s a clean signal 
but very weak. The best audio is recorded not at mic level but at line level. Line￾level is the strength of an audio signal used to transmit analog audio between 
components such as CD and DVD players, television sets, audio amplifiers, and 
mixing consoles. To boost a weaker mic-level signal to the line-level signal, you 
need to give it a swift kick in the pants. The preamp, either a separate unit (that 
connects back to your laptop) or built into a mixer board or a microphone, pro￾vides that kick without adding noise to the original signal.
Now that you know what a preamp is, how about a few options to consider?
Shure MVi
Shure, a name we introduce in Chapter 2, is no stranger to setting the bar for 
audio engineering and recording. With podcasting now an established platform, 
Shure found it natural to create gear that captures quality sound. Their MVi (shown 
in Figure 4-1) is a compact, USB-powered preamp ready to power your micro￾phone (or microphones, if you employ a splitter) accordingly.
FIGURE 4-1:
Shure’s MVi, 
part of the 
MOTIV series of 
audio gear, is a 
preamp designed 
with desktop 
computers and 
mobile devices 
in mind.CHAPTER 4 Go, Go, Power Podcasters! 61
The MVi offers a podcaster-on-the-go the following:
» USB connectivity for easy plug-and-play with optional iOS connectivity with 
iPhones and iPads
» Touch-sensitive panel for control over five different DSP presets, headphone 
volume, and more
» Built-in headphone jack for real-time monitoring
» XLR connection offering a 48V phantom power option
The Shure MVi can serve as a preamp, powered by USB. With a compact design, 
the MVi makes your portable studio even more so.
If you want to record on location, you could use a studio condenser mic, which due 
to its sensitivity will pick up a lot of the background, setting a nice ambiance for 
your podcast. Depending on your environment, though, there might be too much 
ambiance, which is why dynamic mics are preferred for most on-location set￾tings. You’ll still get some background noise, but it won’t be as pronounced as 
when using a studio condenser mic.
RØDE Streamer X
You may be wondering why we bring up the RØDE Streamer X when we address 
streaming in Chapter 16? Legit question. Brace for the awesomeness pictured in 
Figure 4-2!

While not marketed as portable but definitely portable on account of its tight, 
compact design, Streamer X offers all the power and reliability of a mixer, includ￾ing a preamp designed to power an XLR microphone. Add to this a 3.5mm input 
for connecting headsets (which can act as a second mic) and a ¼-inch headphone 
output, and you get zero latency when monitoring live recordings.
Streamer X also offers podcasters the following:
» XLR connection delivering 48V phantom power
» Integrated wireless receiver for connecting RØDE wireless microphones, 
including the Wireless PRO, Wireless GO II, and Wireless ME
» Support for a headset with a mic
» Two USB-C connections for connections to other computers or gaming 
consoles
» Up to 4K30 video capture and 4K60 passthrough via HDMI
Podcasting with Your Mobile Devices
With cloud computing becoming more prevalent, mobile devices — smartphones 
such as iPhone and Samsung Galaxy and tablets such as iPad and Surface — are 
quickly becoming the new alternative to portable computing. Mobile devices have 
reduced portability to a single pocket and a connection to the internet.
Now audio gear is being designed to provide the portability and connectivity you 
expect from smartphones and tablets. Why smartphones? Particularly when con￾ducting interviews where sitting isn’t an option (such as a press conference or a 
person-on-the-street interview), you need your recording rig to be even more 
compact than a tablet. This is where your smartphone transforms faster than an 
Autobot (or a Decepticon, depending on your Transformer of choice) to become 
your recording studio on the fly.
Most mobile phones include a recording app, such as Voice Memos for iOS or Voice 
Recorder for Android. These should provide you with the basics for capturing 
audio on-the-go. However, you might want to look in your mobile app store for 
other apps for features to improve quality and workflow and provide a better user 
experience.CHAPTER 4 Go, Go, Power Podcasters! 63
RØDE VideoMic Me
The RØDE VideoMic Me series, priced between $59 and $79, upgrades your on￾board smartphone microphone to higher-quality audio. The Video Mic Me-L is

Instead of that tinny quality found in most phone conversations and smartphone 
recordings, the VideoMic Me picks up a far wider range and frequency, while 
focusing the direction of the mic, yielding audio of a much higher quality. The 
accessory also comes with an optional mount for better mic stability, an audio jack 
for real-time monitoring with headphones, and a windscreen to cut down on any 
weather elements you might encounter.
The various models are designed for connecting to the different devices as follows:
» VideoMic Me-L: Lightning connector for Apple devices
» VideoMic Me-C: UBS-C connector for mobile devices
» VideoMic Me: 3.5mm audio connector for mobile devices
In turning smartphones into portable recording devices, you may find your 
recording riddled with intermittent static called RFI, or radio frequency interference.
RFI occurs when a disturbance in frequency is generated by an external source — 
for example, other nearby electronic equipment — causing signal degradation.

Static. You could try recording with your device in airplane mode, but this pre￾vents you from doing mobile streaming and even then is no guarantee. As always, 
test your mobile rig before trying to capture that once-in-a-lifetime recording!
RØDE also offers Vlogger Kits that come with a VideoMic Me model, tripod, small 
light, and smartphone mount to help you set up and strike your production with 
ease. Have a look at these Vlogger Kits as all-in-one solutions for your mobile 
podcast.
smartLav+
For the podcast that’s more about the host or for an interview where the interview 
host is edited out of the final show and only the subject’s voice remains, check out 
smartLav+. At a cost similar to VideoMic Me, smartLav+ offers broadcast-quality 
audio for a modest investment. The smartLav+ is a lavalier mic, meaning it’s not 
held by or pointed at the subject but worn on the lapel or collar of a host or guest.
The smartLav+ connects directly into a smartphone or tablet headset jack and 
records using your media-recording app of choice. A small windscreen is included 
to cut down on both wind noise and percussive vocal elements.
The smartLav+ also features the following:
» Kevlar reinforced cable that protects your mic connection from unexpected 
stretching or fraying
» High-quality omnidirectional condenser mic design
» Standard frequency range between 20 Hz and 20 kHz
Many modern smartphones are doing away with headphone jacks, so you might 
need an adapter to make accessories like the smartLav+ with its 1⁄8-inch (3.5mm) 
jack operate properly. Before purchasing any audio recording gear for your smart￾phone, check out how the accessory connects to your smartphone model.
Two for the Røde: The Wireless PRO
Lavalier, or lav, mics such as smartLav+ (described in the preceding section) are 
appealing because you don’t have the pressure of recording in front of a visible 
mic, you no longer need to project your voice, and your hands are free for presen￾tations (in case you add a video component to your podcast). The only downside 
to working with a lav mic are those annoying cables. Watch early episodes of CHAPTER 4 Go, Go, Power Podcasters! 65
Jack Osborne and Katrina Weidman’s Portals to Hell, and you’ll see producers feed￾ing mics and their respective cables underneath people’s clothing, which makes 
for awkward moments of closeness.
Wireless microphones have made serious advancements, and RØDE’s Wireless PRO, 
shown in Figure 4-4, is an upgrade that will level up your podcast production. 
Unlike other lavalier mics that are connected to a receiver base station or a record￾ing device, the Wireless PRO mic connects to a small receiver via Bluetooth. After 
pairing the transmitter(s) and receiver, you can set levels, capture audio (as well 
as a backup recording) on your desired mobile device or video camera, and use 
either the transmitters or included lavalier mic as your wireless microphone.
Let’s run through the setup of a pair of Wireless PROs, connecting them to a 
smartphone:
1. Unpack the two Wireless PRO cases. Find the case that has your 
transmitters and the receiver.
The case will have a USB-C plug in the back. This case doubles as a charger for 
the two transmitters and one receiver; the devices work up to seven hours 
when fully charged.
2. Remove the receiver from its far-right slot in the charging case, and then 
remove the first transmitter from its far-left slot in the charging case.
Once removed from the case, the transmitter and the receiver should pair up 
immediately, as shown in Figure 4-5.

3. If you have a guest or a co-host and want to use a separate microphone 
for their audio, remove the second transmitter.
The second transmitter will sync with the receiver automatically.
4. Using a USB-C-to-USB-C cable, connect the receiver to your smartphone.
Make sure the USB-C cable is optimized for fast data transfer. The cables that 
come with the RØDE Wireless PRO are built for high-speed transfer, but you 
can find this type of cable wherever tech accessories are sold.
5. Clip your transmitter on your shirt, a comfortable distance from your 
mouth. Have your guest do the same if you’re using two transmitters.
6. Connect the receiver to your mobile device with the cables provided per 
RØDE’s instructions.
Make sure the receiver is secured to your device — not flopping around on the 
end of the cable. We recommend looking at various options to secure the 
RØDE Wireless PRO receiver to your mobile device (again, wherever tech 
accessories are sold).
7. Launch your phone’s recording app and start recording.
Alternatively, you can use the RØDE Capture app for recording.
And that’s it! You’re working wirelessly with your smartphone.
FIGURE 4-5:

Working wirelessly with a podcast can open up options for you and your co-host, 
but what if your podcast is more of an interview type of production? Again, RØDE 
is here to help. If you would prefer not to get awkward with your interview subject 
or continuously pause your recording to record random subjects on location, pick 
up RØDE Interview Go, an adapter for your second Wireless PRO mic that turns it 
into a handheld microphone.
The setup for the Interview Go is easy:
1. Follow Steps 1 — 3 of the preceding exercise to begin the setup of your 
Wireless PRO mics.
2. Clip the first transmitter somewhere on your shirt, a comfortable 
distance from your mouth.
3. Plug the second transmitter into the end of RØDE Interview Go, and cover 
the transmitter with the windscreen.
4. Launch your phone’s recording app and start recording.
After a quick sound check, you are now ready for your interview. Good luck!
Podcasting with Portable Recorders
You’ve learned about podcasting with laptop computers, wireless podcasting, and 
podcasting with mobile devices. In this section, you take everything you need to 
record and reduce it to a fully contained recording studio that fits comfortably in 
the palm of your hand.
Zoom-zoom-zoom: The Handy Recorder line
In 2006, Zoom Technologies (https://pfdbook.link/zoomcorp) introduced 
Handy Recorders, its own series of recorders that raised the bar for digital record￾ers. With each new model, Zoom upped its game, and it now offers an entire line 
of lightweight, unobtrusive, all-in-one solutions for portable podcasting. Wel￾come to the new standard.
Zoom H1essential
The H1essential Handy Recorder is the smallest and sleekest of the Handy Recorder 
series. Along with ease of use, it offers the following:
» Onboard X/Y microphone configuration
» Recording to WAV format in different bit rates and varying quality68 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
» Built-in reference speaker
» 1⁄8-inch external mic input and 1⁄8-inch stereo line output
» Capability to record directly to up to 32GB capacity on microSDHC cards and 
1TB on microSDXC cards
» Up to 10 hours of operation on two AAA batteries
Zoom H2n
The H2n Handy Recorder is the next step up, and you may be surprised at what it 
can do. With the H2n in the palm of your hand, you have a surround-sound 
recorder, a spatial audio recorder for virtual reality (VR) projects, and a micro￾phone that can be used as your desktop computer’s audio interface. The H2n 
makes portable recording a piece of cake with the following:
» Five built-in mic capsules offering multiple recording modes, including 
mid-side (MS) stereo, 90° X/Y stereo, and two-channel and four-channel 
surround sound
» Recording formats that include both WAV and MP3 in different bit rates and 
varying quality
» Built-in studio-grade emulators that include low-cut filter, compressor/limiter, 
auto gain, tuner, normalize, and surround mixer
» 1⁄8-inch external mic input and 1⁄8-inch stereo line output
» Capability to record directly to MicroSD and SDHC cards up to 32GB capacity
» Up to 20 hours of operation on two standard AA batteries
Zoom H4n Pro
The H4n Pro Handy Recorder sets a new standard for portable podcasting, delivering 
a wide array of features that build on previous models. With the H4n Pro, you get
» Four-channel audio recording, capable of recording in stereo or mono
» Two XLR/TRS combo connections with both 24V and 48V phantom power options
» Two-input/two-output USB audio interface
» Recording formats that include both WAV and MP3 in different bit rates and 
varying quality
» Built-in studio-grade instrument effects and emulators

» Capability to record up to 140 dB SPL
» Capability to record directly to SD and SDHC cards up to 32GB capacity
» Up to 5.5 hours of operation on two AA batteries
Zoom H5 and H6
If you need more than the H4n Pro offers, look at Zoom’s H5 and H6 Handy Record￾ers (shown in Figure 4-6). Both of these portable recorders offer all the function￾ality and features found in the previous models (as you would expect), as well as 
more options for your on-the-go studio:
» Interchangeable input capsules that can be swapped out as easily as the lens 
of a camera
» Multichannel and stereo USB audio interface for PC, Mac, and iPad
» Capability to run off 2 AA batteries (15 hours for the H5, 20 hours for the H6) 
or provided AC adapter
» Four-channel (H5) or six-channel (H6) audio recording
» Two (H5) or four (H6) XLR connection ports with various phantom power 
options
» Capability to record directly to SD and SDHC cards up to 32GB capacity (H5) or 
SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards up to 1TB (H6)
» Mountable to DSLR or camcorder with optional HS-01 Hot Shoe Mount 
adapter (H5)
Portable recorders have established themselves as reliable, durable, and afford￾able options for field and on-location recording. Depending on what you need for 
your podcast, you no longer have to worry about remaining tethered to a studio. 
Portable recorders can make your podcast happen just about anywhere!
Before recording, always check that you have enough storage on your recording 
device. Most portable recorders have an indicator that shows how many hours or 
minutes of storage remain. For mobile phones, go to the system settings and 
ensure that the phone has approximately 1MB available for each minute of audio 
you want to record (much more for video). Chapter 9 gets into the nitty-gritty 
about settings and storage considerations.
As noted, RFI can be a downer when recording. Even with portable recorders, 
make sure that the smartphone is at least 10 feet (or 3 meters) from your record￾ing device. Radio, data, and cellular signals can leave a telltale buzzing or beeping 
noise and ruin your recording.70 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
From Cloud to Computer: Portable 
Audio Workflow
Now that you know how portable you want your podcast to be, how will the work￾flow differ from your usual editing work in a studio? In this section, we describe 
several approaches to working portably to get audio from your mobile device to 
your studio’s digital audio workstation (DAW.)
FIGURE 4-6:
The Zoom H6 
is a versatile, 
portable recorder

standard for 
recording 
on-the-go with 
its incredible 
options for 
podcasters.
IT’S A PREAMP! IT’S A RECORDER! 
KIDS . . . IT’S A PREAMP AND A RECORDER!
The preamp is a terrific way to get studio-quality sound while recording portably. If you 
want to work on a laptop and still have the ability to take your studio on the go, the 
Zoom Handy Recorders have you covered.
The H4n Pro, H5, and H6 models can all operate in the field as recording devices, and 
you can easily plug in an XLR microphone and conduct the interview on the spot. 
However, if you have an on-location spot secured and want to set up more micro￾phones for a round-table discussion, you can easily plug these Zoom recorders into 
an available USB port to serve as a preamp for your laptop.
And if that isn’t versatile enough, you can attach any of the Handy Recorders to a USB 
port and use it as a dedicated microphone.CHAPTER 4 Go, Go, Power Podcasters! 71
Getting audio from your portable recorder
After you finish recording with your portable recorder, the audio is sitting in your 
recorder’s internal memory card. How do you get it from the recorder to the com￾puter where you’ll be editing the podcast?
You’ve already done the hard part: getting great audio for your podcast. Getting 
the audio to the computer? In the words of brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin at 
the Bridge of Death: “That’s easy!” Do the following for Zoom devices (the process 
for other devices will be similar):
1. Connect the portable recorder to an available USB port.
Recorders should have an included USB cable that physically attaches the 
device to your computer, as shown in Figure 4-7. If you lack such a connecting 
cable, your local electronics store should have what you need.
Recent computers are transitioning from USB to USB-C ports. Adapters can 
convert standard USB plugs to connect with USB-C ports, or provide additional 
ports for other devices such as HDMI and native USB-C devices.
FIGURE 4-7:
Portable 
recorders, when 
connected to 
your computer 
via USB, appear 
on your desktop 
as an external 
drive.72 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
2. Choose Storage ➪ SD Card Reader, or an option indicating the device’s 
storage device.
Typically, the device can be set to one of two modes when connected to 
USB. One mode gives you access to the device’s storage (for example, SD card) 
and other mode is for using your portable recorder as a USB microphone or 
preamp for your computer. In storage mode, the portable recorder (and the 
SD card inside it) mounts to your desktop as an external drive.
Your system will present the portable player as a new drive available to your 
computer.
3. Once your portable player is available, select your new drive and then 
select the folder where your recordings are stored (such as FOLDER01).
Depending on the model of portable recorder, you may see folders labeled 
based on the device’s recording modes. Use that as your guide to locating 
your audio files. Most recorders save the files with a sequential number 
(ZOOM0001.WAV, ZOOM0002.WAV, and so on) or with a date and time stamp 
(such as REC20240401_132546.WAV).
4. Drag your latest recording (the highest number or latest dated filename) 
to the location on your computer’s hard drive where you store your audio 
sessions.
Whether you’re working with an internal drive, an external drive, or cloud 
storage, you’ve copied your audio file source from the recorder to your 
workspace. You can now begin the post-production process.
It’s usually quicker to transfer files from your portable recorder to your computer 
directly rather than use USB. If your computer has an SD card reader, you can 
remove the SD card from your portable recorder and place it in the SD card reader 
for faster copying. Just make sure you properly eject the media before pulling the 
SD card out of the computer and returning it to your portable recorder!
Getting audio from your mobile device
The process of getting audio from a smartphone or tablet is a little different than 
getting audio from a portable recorder. Instead of a hard drive or an SD card, 
smartphones and tablets have internal flash memory that will quickly fill up if 
you’re saving audio or video files directly on the device. To work with audio 
recorded on a mobile device, you first need to transfer the audio to a cloud storage 
service.CHAPTER 4 Go, Go, Power Podcasters! 73
The workflow we have created here is built around the following services, soft￾ware, and hardware:
» Cloud Service: Dropbox
» Portable device: iPad
» Audio recorder: GarageBand for iOS
If you are using other devices or services, it should be easy to incorporate your 
own setup and adapt it for this easy-to-follow workflow:
1. Before transferring audio, check to make sure that your cloud service’s 
app is loaded, updated, and synced with your mobile device.
2. Launch GarageBand for iOS.
If you’ve been working on a project, GarageBand for iOS displays the last 
project you were working on or defaults to an audio recording interface.
3. If you’re in a project, tap the save file icon in the top-left corner (and 
shown in the margin).
4. Tap and hold down on the desired project that has your audio ready for 
export and then tap Share from the menu that appears.
GarageBand for iOS offers three ways to share a project: as a Song (the final 
mixdown), a Ringtone (to personalize your iPhone), or a Project (taking your 
work to the Cloud for further editing).
5. Select Song from the menu, and then edit any options or information for 
the export.
The information (including a cover image, which is artwork representing your 
podcast) you offer here is part of your podcast’s ID3 tags. We cover ID3 tags in 
Chapter 9 and provide tips for good cover images in Chapter 10.
6. Tap Share in the top-right corner of the window.
The Share function (shown in Figure 4-8) accesses apps that can share the 
media you are about to export. Swipe left across the offered apps to find your 
cloud storage service.
If you can’t find the app you want to share with, tap the More option (at the 
end of the connected apps) and then find your cloud service app.74 PART 1 Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
7. Tap your cloud service app.
8. After your podcast is exported, select its destination and then tap the 
Save To or Upload option.
The audio is now on a cloud service, and you can either fine-tune the audio directly 
from the cloud or repeat the preceding process to upload other audio files, making 
the cloud service a storage bin for resources needed in a current or future project. 
Adjust this workflow accordingly if you want to finish producing an episode on a 
laptop or desktop computer.
This workflow can make your production process more efficient if you want to do 
all your editing and production on mobile devices, allowing your podcast — either 
the production or the final format itself — to happen wherever you are.
Although you can record and export audio to MP3, don’t make an MP3 from 
another MP3. Doing so is the audio equivalent of making a compressed JPEG image 
from another JPEG image. Editing a compressed file and compressing it again in 
the saving and exporting process will deteriorate the audio quality. Always strive 
to record, edit, and export from raw, uncompressed formats such as AIFF or WAV 
files. It takes more space initially but produces better results.

Chapter 5
Before You Hit the 
Record Button
When you hear people talk about finding your voice in broadcasting, it 
means finding a connection with what the average audience desires 
and, to some degree, expects when arriving at a specific channel. A 
classical station (and when we refer to classical, we mean Beethoven and Haydn, 
not the Beatles and Hendrix) features on-air personalities speaking slowly and 
articulately, mellowed and relaxed by the melodic creations of greats such as 
Mozart, Wagner, and Joel. (Yes, Billy Joel has a classical album — a pretty good 
one, too!) Pivot now to the on-air personalities of wacky Morning Drive guys who 
sound as if they’re on their eighth cup of espresso. Both stations understand their 
audiences and their expectations.
This chapter helps you develop the voice and personality you want to convey when 
podcasting. After you discover your voice, you find out how to prepare for a smooth 
and easy podcast that will be glitch-free during the recording process. Show prep 
is essential in making a feed worth catching. Even the most spontaneous podcasts 
follow a logical progression and general direction, remaining focused on the pod￾cast’s intent.

Choosing a Topic
Podcasting isn’t all about being number one in your chosen podcast genre. Instead 
of worrying about analytics and accolades, think about what will make your pod￾cast uniquely worth your effort and your listeners’ time. What do you have to say 
about your chosen topic?
According to Oberlo (http://pfdbook.link/oberlo), there are currently two 
million active podcasts as of January 2024. Once upon a time, launching a podcast 
was all about being original and unique. However, in the podisphere of the 2020s, 
you need to grab someone’s attention, even for a split-second, and then maintain 
interest. Sounds easy, but it’s not. Here are some suggestions:
» Identify your audience. Understand who your audience is and their interests 
or issues. Talk to like-minded people online and in real life. Consider partici￾pating in a Facebook group or other online community related to your topic. 
Remember, your podcast is all about the audience — your content and 
delivery is for them, not you. Always keep their interests in mind.
» Study other podcasts. Subscribe to a few podcasts that are related to yours 
and that pique your curiosity. Listen to them for a few weeks and jot down 
what you like and don’t like about them. Remember that listening to other 
podcasts should be educational and constructive, not fodder for your own 
show to criticize someone else’s work. Then ask yourself, “What would I like to 
hear? What can I add to this conversation?”
Don’t steal another podcast’s content, special effects, or unique segment (like 
Technorama’s “On This Day in History” or Tee’s “The Five Minute Paranormal”). 
It’s okay to be inspired, as long as you don’t make your podcast a carbon copy 
of your inspiration. Make your podcast your own! Stay on the pod-sitive side.
» Choose a topic you know. Whether the topic is, say, music, religion, or 
technology, the best way to make your podcast unique is to find an angle 
you’re comfortable with (such as Polka: The Misunderstood Music, Great 
Travesties of Sports History, or Forgotten Greats of Science Fiction). Who knows? 
Your initial show might inspire an additional angle so different from the 
original that you’ll have to start another podcast to address that audience.
» Speak confidently. Don’t apologize for being “yet another podcast on . . .” 
or point out what you’re doing “wrong” compared to others. What makes a 
podcast fun is the passion and confidence you exude when the mic is hot. 
Address your topic with authority and energy, and enjoy your time recording 
(see Figure 5-1). If you have a blast making a podcast, your audience will enjoy 
it along with you. That confidence might even inspire others to create a 
podcast.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 79
Regardless of the genre, the content you bring to a podcast is unique because it’s 
your voice, your angle, and your approach. Provided you maintain a high confi￾dence level, focus on the intent of an episode’s topic, and genuinely enjoy what 
you’re doing, people will tune in as well as talk to other listeners about what 
you’re podcasting.
Finding Your Voice
The broadcasting industry might not want to admit to this, but podcasting and 
commercial radio have a lot in common. In the early days of what is now a major 
radio genre, talk shows were reserved for National Public Radio and news stations. 
In general, they were dry and lackluster, bringing their listeners the news, the 
weather, and daily topics that affected the world  — but nothing particularly 
unusual or exciting.
Then a guy named Howard Stern came along and changed everything in this 
once-tiny niche! You can love him, you can hate him — you can claim to hate him 
when secretly you love him — but Stern turned around what was considered AM￾only programming. Now talk radio is big business. Some personalities are out to 
entertain, other hosts deep dive into lifestyles and subjects of interest, and still 
others voice their political viewpoints.

A majority of podcasting is just that: talk radio. Each podcast has a different per￾sonality and appeals to a different market. Finding your voice is one of the most 
challenging obstacles to clear. Even if your podcast’s aim is entertainment, you 
have a message you want to convey. That message will influence the voice you 
adopt for your podcast. If you’re podcasting an audio blog about life, its chal￾lenges, and the ups and downs you encounter, maybe a soft tone — relaxed and 
somewhat pensive — would be appropriate. But if you decide to go political — say 
you’re the Angry Young Man who’s fed up with the current business on Capitol 
Hill —it’s time to fine-tune the edge in your voice.
After you discover the passion your podcast is centered on (see the preceding sec￾tion for tips), here are some ways to find your voice:
» Record your voice and then listen to what it sounds like. It astounds us 
how many people hate listening to their recorded voice. It’s a fear akin to 
getting up in front of people and speaking. When finding your voice, though, 
you need to hear what your current voice sounds like. Write a paragraph on 
your show’s subject. Then read it aloud a few times and find a rhythm in your 
words. Expect the following:
• Talking too fast
• Swallowing small, one-syllable words such as to and in
• Saying pause words or stop words like um, ah, y’know, and right
• Ignoring commas, thereby creating one long, run-on thought
• Lip-smacking, and heavy breathing.
You can edit out some of these problems (see Chapter 8), but you should 
grow accustomed to hearing your own voice because you’ll hear yourself 
again and again during the editing process. The more familiar you are with 
how your voice sounds, the easier time you’ll have editing your podcasts 
before publishing them online.
» Play around with the three Ps: pitch, power, and pace. You don’t have to 
be an actor to podcast, but you can apply some acting basics when you’re 
recording. Using the same monotone throughout your podcast is likely to 
drone your listener to sleep. Not what you want especially if they’re on their 
morning commute. Try varying the pitch. If you’re excited or passionate about 
a topic, raise the pitch above your normal speaking tone. You might also 
increase the volume (or power) a bit. And when you want to make a point, 
slow down the pace to make an impact. Experiment with pitch, power, and 
pace to add variety and to find the sweet spot between deadpan and overly 
melodramatic (unless your show is based on those characteristics, of course).CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 81
» Speak clearly. Another simple trick from the acting world is to open your 
mouth wider. Many people talk with their mouths mostly closed, but you gain 
clarity by opening your mouth more.
» Speak with confidence. Yes, we’re saying this again because it bears 
repeating: Speak confidently about your topic. (And this won’t be the last time 
we repeat ourselves.) No one is going to believe in what you say if you don’t 
believe in yourself. It may take a few podcasts to find a groove, or you might 
hit the ground running and have a podcast that immediately takes off. Just 
speak with conviction and allow yourself to shine.
» Develop your podcasting personality. After you know what you sound like 
when you record, it’s time to develop your podcasting personality. Will your 
persona be light, fun, and informal, or something a little edgy or jaded? Is your 
message potentially more controversial, discussing topics such as sports, 
politics, or religion? Or are you podcasting a love of music, science, or your 
Mac? Your persona should match the theme of your show. If you’re doing a 
show on classical music, a persona of a morning radio DJ isn’t going to work. If 
you’re taking a lighthearted look at politics, you want a little more levity in your 
tone and pace than a funeral director. Make sure your tone and delivery are 
consistent with your podcast’s theme.
Finding Your Collective Voice
What if your podcast is not a solo effort? One of our favorite ways to podcast is 
with co-hosts or in-studio guests, where more than one voice gets on mic. While 
there’s something to be said for in-depth monologues or one-on-one interviews, 
a show’s dynamic changes when several people are gathered over a favorite topic. 
For one thing, it’s a lot easier to carry on a conversation! And with the right 
dynamic between hosts, an energy is created that subscribers can see and hear in 
every episode.
Along with the guidelines described in this and other chapters, be aware of the 
following when doing a show with multiple guests.
» Use a mixer with enough channels. In Chapter 2, we talk about gear. 
Remember the mixer? The mixer becomes a crucial piece of equipment when 
co-hosts become part of the production. For the best sound and optimal 
control, each person needs their own microphone, so you need multiple XLR 
connections for microphones. Two hosts, and you’ll need two channels. Four 
hosts, four channels. And you may want a few extra inputs for music, sound 
effects, and more.82 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
» Make sure all contributors can hear. You wear headphones when you 
record, so each guest should have a set of headphones, especially if drop-in’s 
are included in your recording. Before you run out and get a cheap Y cable to 
split the signal, realize that the audio signal degrades with each split. To keep 
the investment economical, invest in a stereo headphone amplifier like the one 
in Figure 5-2 (about $70), which splits the headphone signal (while boosting) to 
four channels. Then pick up a five-pack of Audio-Technica headphones from 
online audio vendor BSW (https://pfdbook.link/ATheadphones) for you 
and your co-hosts or guests.
» Do your prep work. Even after all the years we’ve been podcasting, our audio 
systems still have gremlins. We can record on Saturday afternoon and come 
back Sunday morning to find that audio levels have been adjusted. Okay, it 
could be the cats playing with the mixer settings in the middle of the night, but 
it never hurts to check your audio and video settings before each recording.
» Assign one director. The director is the person in charge of your show’s flow 
and timing and, in some cases, coming up with clever segues from one topic 
to the next. It’s the director’s job to keep the energy up, the conversation 
going, and the episode on track. The director is usually the person at the 
mixer but might instead be someone off mic (or camera) giving hand signals.

involved.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 83
Sometimes, the role of director passes from person to person in the cast. Find 
what works best for your group.
» Give everyone air time. The director should also make sure that everyone 
has a chance to talk. Different people bring different things to your show. 
Some people may be passionate and outspoken (and an unstoppable train) 
while others don’t want to interrupt so they wait their turn. Encourage guests 
to play fair and give everyone a share of the air time. We recommend 
discussing this among regular co-hosts before it becomes a problem.
» Give guests most of the air time. Both Chuck and Tee have seen and heard 
their fair share of interviews gone bad. It can be something as horrific as hosts 
not knowing (or caring) to research anything about the guest. We are talking 
about basic research, such as not knowing how long a science fiction author 
has been writing or an AI engineer’s stance on artificial intelligence. When a 
guest is on the docket, remember that the episode is no longer yours. It’s 
theirs. Do the prep work. Research them. And when possible, share interview 
questions with your guests to see if there’s anything you might be missing. For 
more on interview techniques, look at Chapter 6.
» Orient your guests. Before recording, let guests know the format and flow of 
your show. You don’t need to go into all the details, but give them a general 
idea of when they can start talking, how long the show runs, and if you want 
them to hang around after recording for any post-show requests such as 
recording identification drops, quick audio or video bumpers where your guest 
reminds people what they’re listening to. (“Hi, this is Tee Morris of Podcasting 
for Dummies, and you are listening to Technorama.”)
» Make sure everyone has clear sight lines. As much as 93 percent of 
communication between co-hosts is nonverbal. Twirling fingers at your 
co-host (“Wrap it up”) or raising a hand (“I want to ask the next question”) 
makes an interview or an episode recording flow. (However, if video is 
involved, you might not have the luxury of non-verbal communication.) If 
you’re not in person, use Google Meet, Discord, Zoom, or another videocon￾ferencing program to see each other — yes, even for an audio podcast! The 
ability to read a co-host or guest will help you gauge how well the conversa￾tion is going.
To keep your show length consistent, include fewer topics than usual when your 
show includes guests. Part of Chuck’s Saturday ritual for building out the Sunday 
night episode is to find out how many people are coming over so he can add or 
remove topics accordingly. Tee coordinates with his co-hosts on who will take the 
lead on a specific topic. Breaks offer a moment for anyone to tell him “Mind if I 
take the lead in the second half?” If you don’t care about length, just realize that 
more guests will make for a longer show and plan accordingly.84 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Deciding Whether You Need 
an Outline or Script
Some writers prefer to use an outline when putting together a story; others merely 
take an idea, a few points, and a direction, and then let their fingers work across 
the keyboard. What method will work best for you when podcasting? A full script 
and hours of prep time, or a single notecard and two mouse clicks  — one for 
record and another for stop? Both approaches work, depending on the podcaster’s 
personality.
If you decide to work with a script, invest some time in preshow prep, a simple 
preparation for what you’ll say and how you’ll deliver it. Depending on your pod￾cast, prep time may vary. Here are a couple of examples of how dramatically dif￾ferent prep time can be for different podcasting situations:
» For his podcast Don’t Turn Around with Phil Rossi (see Figure 5-3), Phil does 
some basic research on the next guest joining him online or in the studio — 
usually just enough to get some basic facts about the paranormal aspect they 
want to cover. After minimal orientation with the guest, he’s ready to record.
» On the other side of the spectrum is one of the original podcasts, The Radio 
Adventures of Doctor Floyd, a 10-minute show in the style of old-time radio with 
a modern, educational, comedic spin. From 2004–2010, Grant Baciocco and 
Doug Price carefully scripted every show, spending one to three hours on 
preshow prep. That thorough scripting came in handy when Doctor Floyd
featured celebrity actors playing a part in the show.
Preshow prep can range from jotting a few notes on a napkin to writing a com￾plete script with full sound effects — regardless of show length. So how far should 
your prep go? That depends on what your podcast needs. Outlines and scripts can 
serve as roadmaps that move the conversation smoothly from topic to topic.
Whether you’re a napkin scribbler, a script writer, or someone in between, the 
secret to efficient preshow prep can be boiled down to three disciplines:
» Habit: Many podcasters, especially those emerging from corporate offices, 
prepare for podcasts as they do for business presentations. They jot down 
the essential points to keep the podcast on track. You can easily apply your 
organizational skills from the workplace to the podosphere. Whatever you 
do for your preshow prep, make it a habit.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 85
» Talent: Some podcasters are truly the Evel Knievels of podcasting, firing up 
their mics and recording in one take. These podcasters tend to have back￾grounds in live entertainment, deciding in a moment when a change of 
delivery is required. For most, a talent for quick thinking must be developed 
with time.
» Passion: With a majority of podcasters, passion is a driving force that keeps 
their podcasts spur-of-the-moment. With enough drive, inspiration, and 
confidence in their message, they keep their prep time to a minimum because 
podcasting isn’t a chore but a form of recreation.
Determining a Length for Your Show
If you’ve been using this chapter to develop your podcast, you’ve made serious 
progress at this point in completing your preshow prep. Now you’re ready to pod￾cast, right?
FIGURE 5-3:

Well, no. Have you thought about the length of your show’s episode? Podcast 
length is the subject of a much-heated debate. Some say that your podcast 
shouldn’t be longer than 30 minutes because that’s the time of an average 
commute. (Chuck has received listener feedback asking “Can you make your show 
the length of my commute?”) Tee’s response hasn’t changed since 2005: 
“Obviously, you don’t live in the Washington, D.C. Metro area, do you?”
Even if the average commute is 30 minutes, that shouldn’t be a set-in-stone tem￾plate for podcast length. Some shows are 60 seconds, others go on for hours 
(thank you to the person who invented the Pause button!), and still others vary in 
length. When you decide the length of your podcast, remember that you always 
have the option for super-sized episodes if a juicy conversation might happen. For 
this discussion, though, we consider a sweet spot for a podcast to be around 
30 minutes.
The value of the short podcast
On average — and this is more like an understood average, not a scientific, detailed 
study of all the podcasts out there — podcasts runs 20 to 30 minutes per episode. 
However, many podcasts run 10 minutes or less. Hosts deliver their message and 
sign off moments after you thought they signed on. So, what about these quick￾and-simple productions? Does size matter? Does time matter? (Woah. Deep.) Is 
there such a thing as too short a podcast?
Here are some advantages to a brief podcast:
» Shorter production time: Production time may be reduced from a weeklong 
project to a single afternoon of planning, talking, editing, and mixing. With a 
quick and simplified production schedule, delivering a podcast on a regular 
basis is easier.
» Faster downloads: Your podcast subscribers will always have fast and 
efficient downloads — no matter how you compress your audio.
» Easier to stay on target: If you limit yourself to a running time of 10 minutes 
or less, it’s easier to stick to the intent (and the immediate message) of your 
podcast. There’s no room for in-depth chat, spontaneous banter, or tangents. 
Shakespeare said, “Brevity is the soul of wit.” Ol’ Bill would host a short 
podcast if he were alive today.
Nothing’s wrong with keeping a podcast short and sweet. In fact, you might gain 
more subscribers who appreciate your efficiency.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 87
A little length won’t kill you
Now with that quote from the Bard about brevity, you might think, “Shakespeare 
said that?! Before or after he wrote Hamlet?” That’s a good point because a number 
of his characters did say, “My lord, I will be brief” and then launched into a mul￾tipage monologue.
So what if Shakespeare’s podcast ran over 10 minutes? Would he lose sub￾scribers? What if he broke the 60-minute ceiling? Would the Podcast Police shut 
down his show?
Some podcasts can easily fill two or even three hours. You’ll know if you have a 
beefy podcast on your hands after you record a few episodes. Huge productions 
have the following advantages:
» If the show is an interview, you’ll have anywhere from two to three 
hours with an authority. Your podcast becomes something like having a 
one-on-one consultation. When a really good interview takes place, you can 
rest assured your podcast will go a little longer. Allow the interview to run its 
course, and then you can judge how many episodes you have from an 
unexpectedly long recording session.
Shows and interviews that ramble run the risk of losing the audience’s 
attention. We talk more about good interview practices in Chapter 6.
» You have verbal breathing room. A discussion stretching past the 30-minute 
mark allows you and your co-hosts or guests to break off into loosely related 
banter, widening your podcast’s focus and sparking a conversation that can 
lead in other directions.
Podcasts longer than 30 minutes have additional bandwidth and file storage costs. 
See Chapter 3 for more on bandwidth demands on your server and the associated 
financial expense.
Finding a happy medium
Is there such a thing as a middle ground in the length of a podcast? How can you 
find a happy medium if podcasters can’t agree on a standard running time?
The happy medium for a podcast comes down to expectancy and consistency. For 
example, in Tee’s award-winning podcast Tales from the Archives, the running time 
for each episode is across the board  — the shortest clocking in at just over 88 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
30 minutes and the longest weighing in at over 60 minutes. His audience, how￾ever, understood this was a podiobook, an audiobook presented in a serialized for￾mat. Readers expect that chapters and short stories vary in length, so it was not a 
surprise when Tales from the Archives followed suit and had various running times 
for episodes.
In the case of Technorama, Chuck and Kreg have a lot to geek about, but they are 
able to focus their passions and keep the show length close to an hour. Sure, they 
may have a special episode that runs long (a visit to the Hoover Dam operations 
center or backstage at The Star Trek Experience in Las Vegas), but Technorama
remains consistent for the majority of episodes.
Give yourself time to develop your show, your voice, and your direction. If you 
build consistency and expectation for your audience, it’s easier to introduce a little 
variation or even a happy medium into your running time.
Mark Your Calendar: Posting Schedule
You have a format for your show. You have an idea about its running time. Now 
you have to figure out when episodes will go live. What is the best posting pace to 
set for your podcast? What are the advantages to posting frequently versus post￾ing on occasion?
You can post whenever you have an episode ready, but setting a consistent podcast 
schedule will help you establish trust with your audience. Subscribers like to know 
when they can expect your next episode. There are several options for posting 
schedules: daily, weekly, Mondays and Fridays, biweekly, monthly, and so forth.
To figure out the posting schedule that works best for you, sit down and brain￾storm show topics. If you rattle off several ideas, rapid-fire, you might have 
enough content for a more frequent schedule. If your content relies on current 
events, you’ll want to have a workflow that is best suited for quick episode drops. 
If you’re struggling to get ideas on paper, you’ll want more time between 
episodes.
Posting daily
The demands of podcasting — recording, editing, and posting — can be daunting, 
but daily podcasts are still out in the podisphere and prospering. Some podcasters CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 89
achieve a daily schedule by minimizing production with raw and unedited record￾ings. In rare cases where budget includes a post-production crew, a host will 
record and then rely on the staff to take on the editorial workflow. An advantage 
with daily podcasts is that these productions do not necessarily follow a linear 
path. Listeners don’t have to go back to the first episode to understand the flow 
and atmosphere of later episodes. Just jump in and enjoy!
Regardless of your intended schedule, life sometimes deals an unexpected hand. 
Just let your audience know. They’ll understand. Most podcasters have a day job, 
family that needs attention, and a host of other responsibilities, scheduled or oth￾erwise. You don’t have to reveal personal details if it’s not appropriate, but be 
polite and send a quick message to your audience.
Similar to the preceding tip, you might also consider having seasons for your pod￾cast, similar again to television schedules, to prevent burnout or to better fit your 
content. For example, in Tee’s steampunk podcast, Tales from the Archives, seasons 
are defined by 10 to 12 short stories. Again, if a break is coming up in your produc￾tion, make sure to let your audience know.
Posting weekly
The most common schedule we have seen for podcasts is weekly posting, much 
like popular television shows. Making a commitment to producing new content 
once a week might not seem like much of a demand, but it may surprise you how 
quickly “posting day” comes around when running a weekly schedule.
Make sure the content is recorded, polished, and ready to schedule before you 
launch a podcast. Record a few episodes and work with them to develop a work￾flow that makes your production and posting schedule more efficient. For exam￾ple, gaming podcasts such as ADHD D&D (https://pfdbook.link/adhddnd), 
shown in Figure 5-4, and So Many Levels (https://pfdbook.link/somanylevels) 
record gaming sessions that can last for an hour (or longer). The editors of these 
podcasts create several episodes from these gaming sessions, and then present 
them in a serialized format.
With a buffer of previous gameplay, you’re assured of enough content to meet the 
demands of a weekly podcast. Be consistent with the day of the week for your pod￾cast because listeners or viewers will be expecting your next episode. However, as 
with many things, there are exceptions. If you’re creating a podcast about news or 
other current events, it’s not possible to record in advance.90 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Posting biweekly (or fortnightly for our 
friends in the Commonwealth)
Say you have a reasonable amount of content, but not a lot of free time. Or maybe 
you want to podcast frequently but are concerned that you’ll burn through the 
content before you can come up with new ideas and directions for your show. A 
biweekly posting schedule is a comfortable alternative to the regular demands of a 
weekly production. A biweekly podcast such as The Topic Is Trek (https://
pfdbook.link/thetopicistrek) finds a good life-work-podcast balance. How￾ever, a biweekly podcast may have less audience engagement and won’t be as 
timely compared to a more frequent posting schedule.
Posting monthly
One of the biggest benefits of a monthly podcast is a more relaxed production 
schedule. Another appealing aspect of a monthly podcast schedule is that you can 
have longer-than-usual running times on topics inspired by the recent weeks’ 
headlines. Such is the case with shows like Reset with Liz Tran (https://pfdbook.
link/reset) and The Art Monthly Talk Show (https://pfdbook.link/artmonthly), 
where the hosts enjoy the conversation, tangents and all, recording episodes of an 
hour or more.
And because you have so much time to prep for a monthly podcast, you can gather 
plenty of resources and backstories as well as your thoughts. So if you have a 
FIGURE 5-4:
The ADHD D&D
weekly podcast 
has an audio 
archive of 
adventures, so 
they can post 
consistently week 
after week.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 91
subject that needs time for research and discussion, posting monthly may be a 
better option for you.
However, building and nurturing a community with content that occurs only once 
a month can be difficult. Additionally, creating a podcast with a timely topic is 
impossible when commenting on news or events that occurred weeks before the 
recording session.
If you find yourself with an intermittent schedule, don’t apologize for the absence. 
Over the years, we’ve listened to a number of podcasts with random schedules. 
When we finally do hear from these wayward podcasters, we’re excited. It would 
be a letdown if their first words were “Sorry for not producing the show as fre￾quently as I would like.” Instead, consider telling us how glad you are to be back. 
Or don’t mention it at all; get right in and start your delivery as if nothing hap￾pened. We forgive you!
I Hear Music (and It Sounds 
Like Police Sirens!)
To give your show an extra punch or a shot of personality, add music. Although 
our tastes range from classical to jazz to rock ’n’ roll, and our skills in music com￾position are far from the level of composer, we both appreciate and understand 
the power of music and what it can bring to a podcast. A soundtrack can bring a 
lot to a production, so we encourage you to find a solid score for your podcast.
We also understand and appreciate the law, so read on and find out more about 
what not to do with music in your podcast. Although you may think it’s cool to 
thumb your nose at corporate America, there are serious rules to follow when 
featuring your favorite song as your podcast theme.
We are podcasters, not lawyers. We can tell you about the law as it pertains to 
podcasting and can provide a few simple definitions, but we aren’t giving legal 
advice. If you need a legal call on a matter concerning your podcast — whether it 
concerns the First Amendment, copyright issues, or slander  — please consult 
a lawyer.
The powers that be
The government still regards the internet as a digital Wild West, an unknown ter￾ritory that’s avoided regulation for many years, granting those who use it a true, 92 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
self-governed entity where ideas, cultures, and concepts can be expressed without 
filtering or editing, unless it comes from the users themselves.
Does this mean we podcasters are free to do as we please? No, not by a long shot. 
Even podcasters must follow rules and regulations as well as pay attention to cer￾tain organizations and their influence on the podisphere. It will be to your benefit 
to understand how their legislation, activities, and actions can affect you.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC (https://pfdbook.link/fcc), is 
the watchdog of anything and everything that gets out to the public through mass 
communications. The FCC keeps an eye on technology development, monopolies 
in the telecommunications industry, and regulating standards for telecommuni￾cations in the US and its territories. It is most commonly known for enforcing 
decency laws on television and AM/FM radio.
For podcasters, the FCC can’t regulate what is said (yet) because it doesn’t con￾sider the internet a broadcasting medium. However, given existing legislation to 
reduce spam (junk email) and the ever-growing popularity of podcasting among 
mainstream broadcasters (such as iHeartMedia, NPR, and ESPN), it may not be 
long before the law catches up with the technology.
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
Shawn Fanning. Does that name ring a bell? Fanning lost his battle against the 
Recording Industry Association of America, or RIAA (https://pfdbook.link/riaa), 
when he contested that his file-sharing application, Napster, in no way infringed 
on copyright laws and was not promoting music piracy. The RIAA led the charge 
in shutting down the original Napster and continues to protect the property rights 
of its members — as well as review new and pending laws, regulations, and poli￾cies at the state and federal level.
The RIAA will have a definite say as to why you can’t use a selected piece of music 
for your podcast. Simply put, it’s not your music. Sure, you downloaded that 
album from Apple Music, but you listen to that music with the condition that you 
use it for listening purposes only. (Didn’t realize there were conditions involved, 
did you?) You can’t use it as a personal introduction that people will associate with 
you. And, no matter how appropriate your favorite song, you can’t use it as back￾ground music. Unless you are granted a license and pay a fee to the record label 
and artist, you’re in copyright violation when playing music without permission.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 93
One way of getting music for themes, bed music (low volume background music), 
and segues is to check out podsafe music, which is professionally produced music 
from independent artists offering their works for podcasting use. The demand for 
podsafe music has been so high that several sites have been launched, offering a 
wide array of genres, artists, and musical works:
» Free Music Archive (see Figure 5-5): https://pfdbook.link/fma
» Neosounds: https://pfdbook.link/neosounds
» Sound Stripe: https://pfdbook.link/soundstripe
» Sync or Stream: https://pfdbook.link/syncorstream
Visit these sites to find out more about podsafe music, the conditions of using it, 
and how it can benefit your podcast.
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
In addition to the big dogs who pass laws and legislations to restrain your pod￾casting capabilities, a group is looking out for you, the podcaster, with science 
fiction author and tech activist Cory Doctorow stepping forward as one of its more 
outspoken members. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, or EFF (https://pfdbook.

of the individual; to educate the media, lawmakers, and the public on how tech￾nology affects their civil liberties; and to uphold said civil liberties if they’re 
threatened.
A good example of EFF’s mission is its involvement in various legal cases con￾cerning URL domain registration and cybersquatters (individuals who buy desired 
domains and do nothing but hold onto these web addresses, waiting to sell them 
to the highest bidder). The EFF stands for the rights of legitimate website owners 
who own a domain that a larger corporation wants to use.
Provided you have a strong case to contradict the findings of the RIAA and the 
FCC, the EFF will stand up for you and give your voice a bit of power against 
the corporate legal machine. Find out how by visiting their site and looking at the 
information and services they provide.
Creative Commons (CC)
Copyright protection is a double-edged sword for many. On the positive side, your 
work is protected so that no one can steal it for personal profit. Also, if someone 
claims that you’re ripping off their work, your copyright is proof that your egg 
came before their chicken. The downside of this protection is that people must go 
through channels to feature your work. Although you’re given credit for the fea￾tured property, there’s still a matter of approvals, fees for usage, and conditions 
that must be met. Also, many contributors just want to share their work with oth￾ers on no other terms but to contribute and share with the world. Copyrights com￾plicate this.
Enter Creative Commons, or CC (https://pfdbook.link/creativecommons), a

like the RIAA. CC, shown in Figure 5-6, is dedicated to drafting and implementing 
internet licenses granting fair use of copyrighted material.
In the case of the podcaster, if you want to offer your audio content to everyone, 
CC can provide you with licenses that aid you in letting people know your podcast

same licenses to artists and musicians who don’t mind if you use their music for 
your podcast.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 95
CC licenses are made up of the following permissions:

I can name that tune . . . I wrote it!
Using anyone else’s music for your podcast can be an open invitation for the RIAA 
to shut it down, primarily to protect the artist’s rights. Think about it — how 
would you feel if you were producing a popular podcast and receiving praise from 
all over the world, and while you’re thinking about ways of taking the podcast to 
the next level, you turn on your radio and hear your podcast being broadcast on a 
top-rated radio station. Soon, your podcast is all the rage on the broadcasting 
airwaves — and you haven’t made dollar one.
The same can be said for artists and their music. They work hard to produce their 
work, and now podcasters are using their music to brand their shows, not bother￾ing to compensate the artists for their efforts.
So how can you use a piece of music without suffering the wrath of the RIAA or 
FCC? Ask permission of the artist? Only if the artist owns all rights to the music 
and the recordings. Otherwise, you need to get written permission from vocal art￾ists, musicians, record labels, producers, and more.
The best way to avoid the legal hassles is to avoid copyrighted material that is not 
your own.
If you want to use published pieces that aren’t royalty-free, ask the artist directly 
(if you can) for permission to use that music on a regular basis. Compensation to 
the artist may come in the form of a promotion at the beginning of the podcast, 
the end, or both. As long as you have written permission from the artist and the 
artist has the power to grant it (that is, they haven’t signed the power over to their 
label or publisher), you should be able to use their work to brand your show or 
feature them on your podcast. (If you’re not sure whether you have the appropri￾ate permission, you may want to consult an attorney.) Acknowledgement of the 
music artist is usually acceptable with independent artists because, in many cases, 
they also own the record label. Confirm these details with the artists. Otherwise, 
you run into the same legal issues if you were to use music recorded by Queen, Dua 
Lipa, or U2.
You can always offer your podcast as a venue for the musician to sell his or her 
work. Such is the case for George Hrab (shown in Figure  5-7) of The Geologic 
Podcast (http://pfdbook.link/geologic). George made an impression on pod￾casters and listeners attending Dragon Con, and his irreverent humor, critical 
thinking, and love of music made The Geologic Podcast an instant hit. George is also 
a mega-talented musician, and The Geologic Podcast serves as a viable platform for 
his music, which you can hear before it goes live on Spotify and Apple Music.CHAPTER 5 Before You Hit the Record Button 97
I’ll take the First: Free speech 
versus slander
Words can get you in as much trouble as music. The legal definition of slander is a 
verbal form of defamation or spoken words that falsely and negatively reflect on 
one’s reputation.
So, where does podcasting fit into this? Well, the internet is a public space. Before 
you begin a slam-fest on someone you don’t like in the media or at work, remem￾ber that your rant is reaching MP3 players around the world. Cite your sources and 
make certain those sources are not only reliable and authentic but also confirmed 
by other credible sources. By citing your sources, you tell your listener that you’re 
not making this stuff up and you drive traffic to the referenced website. When 
expressing opinions — jaded, constructive, or otherwise — have evidence to back 
up what you say.

Your freedom to express yourself comes with responsibility and consequences. 
Your words carry weight, and if you go after others in your professional circles or 
in your community, there is no guarantee your listeners will back you. You may 
picture your fans rallying around you and your show but find yourself working 
damage control instead. Before wrapping yourself in the First Amendment (which 
doesn’t apply unless the government is spamming your comments section), 
remember freedom of speech is a right, not a privilege.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 99

Podcasting is empowering. There’s something about a microphone in your 
hand that instills courage. Suddenly, you’re not afraid of anything. Oh yeah, 
you’re “running with the big dogs” now, and like Paula Zhan, Stephen 
Sackur, or Anderson Cooper, you’re finding out what makes your guest tick.
What sets you apart from those big dogs, though, is skill. The late, great Anthony 
Bourdain made it look easy on Parts Unknown, as people opened up to him over a 
local dish or an original culinary experience — but that was the magic of the per￾fect setting, the best dish, and the charm of Bourdain. He clicked with people. (His 
interview with Danny Trejo is a favorite of Tee’s.)
Make no mistake: Interviews are not easy. Hosting an interview is a skill, and 
hosting a great interview is an art. The good news is that these luminaries blessed 
with the gift of gab had to start somewhere. Podcasting is an excellent venue for 
developing and honing these skills, but you need a solid foundation on which to 
build your skill set.
In this chapter, we provide tips for making a successful interview request. After 
you land the interview, we’re here to help you get ready by showing you how to

both ask good questions to keep the conversation lively and engaging and avoid 
bad questions. You also discover some tried-and-true hardware and software for 
recording your interview. Finally, we impart those always-valuable behind-the￾scenes technical tips to make the interview go smoothly.
I’ll Have My People Call Your People: 
Interview Requests
The courage to submit an interview request comes simply from your interest in 
the interview subject. Compose an email to ask your favorite author, actor, sports 
celebrity, streamer, podcaster, or whomever you want for an interview. You may 
need to submit the request multiple times, and sometimes you might work 
through numerous people simply to get “no” as your final reply. But for every 
“no,” you’ll find others who will enthusiastically say “yes.”
Keep the following in mind when working on your interview request:
» Market yourself and your show. A successful podcast requires a lot of 
marketing. Your interview request should sell your services to the prospective 
interviewee. If you’re part of a podcasting network, be sure to mention that 
fact because large listenership numbers are always helpful. If you’ve con￾ducted other interviews, do some name dropping. If not, a good place to start 
might be to interview other podcasters, who also want to increase their 
listenership.
» Figure out what can you do for the interviewee. The person (or the 
person’s agent) is going ask, “What’s in it for me (or my client)?” Does the 
person have a new book coming out or are they about to launch a special 
product? In 2008, Chuck and his co-host Kreg went to the Hoover Dam for an 
on-site interview for their Technorama Podcast; they had a genuine interest in 
the science and the history behind the engineering achievement. That pitch 
granted them an incredible behind-the-scenes look at the famous dam (see 
Figure 6-1). Find an angle and work with it.
» Be flexible. Remember, you’re asking for their time. There may be restrictions 
in your schedule and theirs. You might be asked to record an interview right 
on the spot, or within 24 hours, or weeks or months later. You might have to 
take time off from your regular job, rearrange other plans in your week, or 
cancel previous arrangements, just like the interview subject who is taking 
time out of their day to chat with you.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 101
Don’t assume that the person reading your interview request is going to know 
your podcast. Provide a brief overview of your show. Your tag line is a great place 
to start. Having a ready-made “elevator pitch” (a 20- to 30-second description) 
is particularly helpful.
FIGURE 6-1:

Technorama crew 
got an exclusive

request for an 
interview.
THE INTERVIEW REQUEST
One of the easiest ways to make an interview request is via email. It’s time to put 
your marketing hat on top of your public relations hat and consider how you want to 
represent your show when sending queries. First, putting words like Interview request or 
Podcast interview request in the subject tells the reader what you want before they even 
open the message. Use a warm greeting: “Hello” followed by the recipient’s name is 
always a good start. Remember, you may not be sending the message to the inter￾viewee directly but rather have to work through their agent or handler.
In the body of the message, use the BLUF — bottom line up front — rule. The first line 
of your message body should include something like “I am requesting an interview with 
Brent Spiner for The Topic is Trek podcast.” There’s no doubt about what you want. We 
(continued)102 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
know it’s tempting to dive into the show details after you mention it by name, but don’t. 
This query is about the interview subject. Don’t go into great detail about your show yet.
Explain why you want to speak with that person. Do they have any upcoming or recent 
books, movies, or appearances they are interested in promoting? Also mention how 
much time you’re asking for: 2 hours is a much different consideration (and easier to 
say no to) than 15 minutes.
Next, describe your show but don’t drone on — a sentence or two and perhaps some 
notable names of people you have interviewed is all you need. This is where a well￾polished tag line is useful. Something like “The Topic is Trek is a show about Star Trek
news, episodes, and thought-provoking questions in a fun and energetic tone.” In some 
cases, you won’t need to explain your show if its title explains what the show is about. 
For example, “We would love to host an interview with Shohreh Aghdashloo in an 
upcoming episode of Happy Hour from the Tower: A Destiny Podcast.” You’ve just made 
the request, identified the show, and described what it’s about. If you have an audio 
file or a video file that describes your show, include a link to that as well.
Close with a respectful yet positive salutation, such as “I look forward to hearing back 
from you.” Remember, most people are busy and may not respond right away, so you 
might need to follow up periodically. It took Chuck two years of polite reminders to get 
an interview with Dr. Robert Ballard (the man who discovered the Titanic), but it was well 
worth the effort. Here’s an example of how that might look:
Hello agent name,
I would like to request an audio interview with guest full name for our podcast 
Technorama (link below). As fans, we’d love to talk to guest first name, and we’re 
sure our listeners would love to share in the experience. Our phone interviews 
are typically 30 to 45 minutes long.
Kreg and Chuck would like to talk about guest first name’s story and any other projects 
they have coming up. Chuck has just finished reading book name and absolutely loved it!
About our show: Technorama is a weekly podcast about tech, science, and sci-fi, with 
pop-culture references and other geek humor. Along with our standard weekly show, 
we also have special interviews. Some of our guests included:
• Dr. Robert Ballard, scientist and discoverer of the Titanic and Bismarck
• Adam Savage and Grant Imahara from the Discovery Channel’s MythBusters
• Astronomer David Levy, discoverer of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
• Dean Haglund from The X-Files
(continued)CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 103
Don’t forget to exchange contact information with your guest after your interview 
is confirmed. Will you be calling their phone or will you be using Facebook Mes￾senger, Zoom, or Discord? The means of contact will have an effect on what you 
need to record the call (covered later, in the “Recording Interviews” section).
Preparing for Interviews
Have a plan. All great interviewers, be they Barbara Walters or Stephen Colbert, 
plan which questions garner the best responses.
Asking great questions
A podcast interview isn’t like a job interview. In podcasting, interviews are inter￾personal, casual chats that can become thought-provoking or downright contro￾versial, depending on the podcast’s subject matter. Whether you did all the 
pre-interview prep or are simply a mouthpiece for someone else’s questions, here 
are a few tips to take to heart so you can hold a good, engaging interview:
» Know who you’re talking to and what to talk about. When guests appear 
on your show, at the very least you should know the subject matter. For 
example, suppose you’re interviewing an author who has written a popular 
• Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer
• Dr. Michio Kaku, theoretical physicist
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to scheduling a time when 
we can speak to guest first name.

series. Finding time to read the entire series would be difficult, so go online 
and research it instead. Also find websites relevant to the topic of the series. 
If the series is steampunk, dig up information about the Victorian era. If the 
series follows a snarky, sentient robot, look up artificial intelligence. You’ll be 
able to ask better questions. These same rules apply for nonfiction authors 
and really any guests. You don’t have to be an expert on their subject matter, 
but you should be familiar with it so you know in what direction to take the 
interview.
If your guest has a website and is on social media, check out those venues 
as well.
» Make sure your questions follow a logical progression. Say you’re 
interviewing a filmmaker who is working on a horror movie. A good 
progression for your interview would be something like this:
• How did you get started in filmmaking?
• Who inspired you in this genre?
• In your opinion, what is the most challenging film you ever made?
• I found your character Anabel particularly intriguing. Was she based on 
someone you know?
• Do you have any upcoming projects?
These questions are all based on filmmaking and focused on your guest’s 
work. We start with a broad question, then get more specific, and conclude 
with a potential promotion for their upcoming work. Most interviews should 
follow a progression from specific to broad or vice versa, where you start with 
a very broad question and slowly become more specific to the guest’s 
expertise.
» Ask open-ended questions. To understand open-ended questions, it’s 
simpler to explain closed-ended questions. Close-ended questions are the 
kind that give you one-word answers, for example, “How many years have you 
been studying plate tectonics?” Don’t be surprised if your interviewee comes 
back with “Seven.” And then . . . silence. Close-ended questions make the 
process harder than it needs to be. Instead, rephrase your question as “So 
what got you interested in plate tectonics?”
» Prepare twice the number of questions that you think you’ll need. Some 
interviews grind to a halt because the interviewer thought that the guest’s 
responses would be longer. You’re in for a bumpy ride if you ask a guest, “Tell 
the listener a little bit about your experience at WidgetCo,” and the guest 
replies, “It was a lot of hard work but rewarding.” (Yeah, this is going to be 
painful.) This is why you should always have far more questions than you 
think you’ll need.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 105
If you figure that every question merits a 2-minute answer on average and the 
interview will last 20 minutes, have 15 to 20 questions ready to ask. However, 
your guest could go on for 10 minutes in response to the first question, so 
prioritize your questions so you ask the main ones you think your audience 
will love — and be prepared to do some editing!
Also be ready with a closing question to let your guest know it’s time to wind 
down. For example, “Thank you for your time today. Before we go, can you let 
the listener know how to contact you?”
» Don’t worry about asking an obvious question. When asking questions 
that may sound obvious or frequently asked, remember that your audience 
has probably never heard them answered before. Okay, maybe a writer has 
been asked time and again, “Where do your ideas come from?” or a steam￾punk, as shown in Figure 6-2, has often heard, “So, how long did it take you 
to make this prop?” When you have a guest present for a podcast, there’s no 
such thing as an obvious (or stupid) question; what’s really dumb is to not ask 
a question that you think isn’t worth the guest’s time. The person may be 
champing at the bit in hopes you’ll ask it.
FIGURE 6-2:
While interview￾ing steampunks 
at DragonCon, 
Chuck never

asking “How long 
did these props 
take you to 
make?” because 
the often-asked 
question is 
welcomed by 
makers, 
cosplayers, and 
other creatives.106 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Leave room for spontaneous questions. Listen to your guest’s answers and see if a 
new path has opened up. They may be tense while answering the same questions 
for the 50th time, but if you strike a chord and stumble on a piece they are pas￾sionate about, abandon the questions for a bit and follow the trail! Doing so can 
lead to interesting conversations and stories.
Avoiding inappropriate questions
Before you start dreaming up a few questions based on the preceding tips, stop 
and think about the interviews you’ve listened to where things suddenly went 
awry. Usually, the interviewer knows nothing about the guest and is expected to 
interview the person on the fly, or the host ambushes the guest with questions 
that dig into something out of the guest’s scope or are none of the interviewer’s 
business. In this section, we pile up the typical gaffes in a prime example of a good 
interview gone bad.
The following blunders will turn a pleasant conversation sour faster than the run 
of an Uwe Boll movie:
» Asking inappropriate questions. Keep in mind that your podcast is not 
60 Minutes, HardTalk, or even Judge Judy. If you want to fire off hard-hitting, 
tell-all, mudslinging questions, think about who you’re talking to and whether 
the person can answer honestly and openly. If not, an awkward moment may 
be the least of your worries. Inappropriate questions can also be irrelevant, 
wacky, off-the-wall, and far-too-personal questions for your guests. “Who 
was the rudest person you’ve ever worked with on a set?” could put a stunt 
performer’s career into jeopardy if answered earnestly. “What’s the worst 
book you’ve ever read?” could drop a writer into hot water with their col￾leagues. Asking athletes, “You’re in fantastic shape. Do you sleep naked?” 
could easily derail an interview. Maybe these wild card questions work for 
shock jocks, but when you have an opportunity to interview people you 
respect, do you really want to ask them something like, “Boxers, briefs, or 
none of the above?”
» Continuing to pursue answers to inappropriate questions. If a question 
has been deemed inappropriate by a guest, don’t continue to ask it. Move on 
to the next question. Podcasts are not an arena for browbeating guests into 
submission until they break down in tears and cough up the ugly, sordid 
details of their lives.
And news flash: They’re not going to.
Are there exceptions? Yes, depending on the content of your podcast. Say 
after reading — and enjoying — Podcasting For Dummies, you decide to take 
on the risk of asking inappropriate questions and become the next Zach CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 107
Galifianakis from Between Two Ferns, complete with foliage for a backdrop. We 
warned you and wish you all the best. (And yes, we had this format in the 
early years of podcasting with Kent Nichols and Douglas Sarine’s Ask a Ninja,
archived at https://pfdbook.link/askaninja.) Of course, if you’re after 
irreverent material for your show and push that envelope as far as you can, 
your guests may not want to play along — especially if they don’t get the joke. 
If that’s the case, expect your guests to get up and walk away. Even in the 
most idyllic situations, guests can (and do) reserve the right to do that.
» Turning the interview into the Me show. Please remember that the 
spotlight belongs to your guest. Tee recalls a podcast where — no kidding — 
the three-person crew invited a guest on their writing podcast to talk about 
their books and their writing methodology, only to launch into a 15-minute 
discussion between themselves on an unrelated topic, leaving the guest on 
the other side of their mic. Silent. For 15 minutes.
Yes, it’s your podcast, but when a guest is introduced into the mix, you’re 
surrendering control of the show to that person. Let guests enjoy the 
spotlight; your audience will appreciate them for being there, which adds a 
new dimension to your feed. One way to avoid the “me factor” is to think of 
yourself as a liaison for the listener. Ask yourself, “As a listener, what ques￾tions would I ask or what information would I be looking for from the guest?”
» Being disrespectful to your guests. It has happened to Tee, both as an 
interview subject and as an interviewer. He’s answered some questions that 
made him uncomfortable, and then requested the podcasters to please edit 
out the question and related awkward response. In most cases, his request 
was respected. The others who didn’t edit their podcasts? Well, he no longer 
fields queries from them. Tee extends the same courtesy to his guests. 
Interview subjects talk to their friends and you want them to speak positively of 
you and your podcast. Show them respect, and your guests will do the same.
Consider sharing your list of questions with the interviewee before the recording 
session. This gives your guest time to prepare their thoughts and might save you 
a lot of editing later.
Feelin’ the synergy
One final note on preparing for interviews: We’ve heard some guests say, “I’m 
doing these interviewers a favor by going on their show.” And we’ve been told by 
other show hosts, “We’re doing you a great favor with this chance to showcase 
your work on our show.” Both opinions are subjective.
The host and the guest are working together to create a synergy. The interviewer 
has a chance to earn a wider audience and display mastery of journalistic 108 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
techniques. The guest has a chance to get in the public eye, stay in the public eye, 
and talk about the next big thing coming in sight of said public eye. The host and 
the guest form a seamless promotional machine for one another. And if you’re 
lucky, the interview subject might take complete control of your show, which is 
what actor Lani Tupu did with Tee in a recording session captured in Figure 6-3. 
This interplay reflected the trust as well as the fun that the Farscape actor was 
having alongside Tee.
If your format allows it, ask your guest for an ID that you can drop in from time to 
time. You’ve probably heard these before on radio stations “Hi, this is Rex Kramer, 
danger seeker. You may remember me from such films as Airplane and Kentucky 
Fried Movie. You’re listening to the Shameless Self-Promoting Podcast.” If the 
interview guests want to be creative, let them. These IDs are a great self-promotion 
tool, a lot of fun, and a way to remind your listener of previous accomplishments. 
Remember to ask politely, and be aware that not everyone will (or can) comply.
Recording Interviews
Unless you’re conducting an interview in person, your podcast just got more com￾plicated technically. You need to have the appropriate hardware and software to 
record your interview. Software solutions typically cost less and are not as 
FIGURE 6-3:
If a synergy is

and host, you can 
ramp up the fun

complex to set up and use as hardware solutions. However, a software solution 
can put more load on the computer’s CPU, and if the CPU is too busy, it can affect 
the quality of the recording. We cover both software and hardware options in this 
section.
There are legal restrictions concerning the recording of telephone calls and video￾conferencing calls (such as Zoom), and these restrictions vary from country to 
country, state to state, and region to region. A quick web search for terms such as 
regulations for recording conversations should turn up several useful results. 
Compliance with these laws is the responsibility of the podcaster. Before record￾ing a call, ask for permission or, better yet, get it in writing (search for recording 
consent form).
Recording using Zoom
One of the most popular options for making calls and recording interviews is Zoom
(https://pfdbook.link/zoom), which is available for Windows, Mac, iOS, 
Android, and Linux. Zoom can be run as a downloadable client or from their web￾site. However, if you want to record your interview, you need to install the client 
on Windows or Mac.
Check your recording settings on the Zoom website under Settings ➪ Recording 
before starting Zoom. If you’re using a corporate Zoom account, you be able to 
record in the cloud but not locally.
Recording a Zoom call is simple:
1. Download and install the Zoom client at https://pfdbook.link/
zoomdownload.
2. Launch Zoom on your device. Create an account or sign in if you haven’t 
already.
Zoom offers free accounts but limits the meeting length to 40 minutes. If you 
need more time, want to record to the cloud, or need other advanced features, 
investigate the paid tiers.
3. Click the Schedule button and enter the details of your meeting (see 
Figure 6-4):
a. In the Topic field, give your meeting a meaningful name.
b. In the Date & Time fields, enter the start and end date/time for your meeting. 
Additionally, set the time zone to avoid confusion.
c. In the Attendees field, enter your guest’s email. For now, you can skip over the 
options in the sections labeled Meeting ID, Security, and Encryption.110 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
d. In the Video section, choose the appropriate options to determine whether you 
want the video on or off for you (Host) and your guest (Participant). Scroll down 
for more options.
e. Leave the Audio section as-is with the setting Telephone and Computer Audio.
f. In the Calendar section, choose which calendar type you want to send the 
invite to.
4. Click Send.
Congratulations, you’ve scheduled the meeting and sent a calendar invite to 
your attendee(s). Now sit back and wait for the momentous occasion to arrive.
5. When the meeting time arrives, click Start on the main Zoom screen.
6. Click the Record button, located on the bottom toolbar.
Your guests will be greeted by a message indicating that the session is being 
recorded.
FIGURE 6-4:
Scheduling a 
Zoom meeting is 
a simple matter 
of a few details.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 111
7. At the end of your session, click the red End button in the lower-right 
corner and then click End Meeting for All.
If you don’t see the toolbar at the bottom, move your cursor over the Zoom 
window and it should appear.
After you’ve ended the session, Zoom’s servers may take a few minutes to save 
your recording (if you have recorded to the cloud). You’ll get an email when 
your recording is available.
8. To retrieve your recording, follow these steps:
a. Log in to the Zoom home page (https://pfdbook.link/zoom).
b. From the menu on the left, click Recordings.
c. In the list of recordings, click the meeting name.
d. Hover your cursor over the Audio Only list entry.
e. Locate and click the download icon (downward-pointing arrow), which appears 
between Audio Only and the file size. Optionally, if you want the video, 
download the Speaker view or Gallery view files.
9. Open the recording and verify it worked.
The recording is available in your computer’s Downloads directory. The video 
file is saved in the MP4 format and the audio file is saved in the M4A format.
Having each meeting attendee recorded on their own track enables you to adjust 
volume levels independently and mute unwanted background noises (such as your 
dog barking while your guest is talking). Zoom’s paid subscribers have an option 
under Settings ➪ Recordings to record each attendee to their own track. This can 
be configured only by logging into the Zoom website and is not available in the 
desktop client. Just be aware that the files are M4A files and may need to be con￾verted to work with your software.
Recording using StreamYard
If you’re thinking of not only recording your podcast but also live streaming it, 
look at StreamYard (https://pfdbook.link/streamyard). (For details on live 
streaming, see Chapter  16.) StreamYard is a website that allows you and your 
guest to talk face-to-face, share computer screens, record, and stream to many 
popular sites such as YouTube, Twitch, X, Facebook, and LinkedIn.112 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
To get started with StreamYard, follow these simple steps:
1. Go to the StreamYard website (https://pfdbook.link/streamyard) and 
create an account.
StreamYard offers a free tier to get you started. However, video recording is 
limited to 720p, the storage limit is five hours of recording time, and you have 
to live with the StreamYard (duck) logo in the upper-right corner. If you want 
more flexibility and quality in your production, look into the monthly or yearly 
subscription, which is available on the main page’s top-right menu under My 
Account.
2. On the main screen, click the Create button. In the pop-up window that 
appears, click Recording.
3. Enter an appropriate title for your masterpiece and then click the Create 
Recording button.
4. If prompted, allow StreamYard access to your mic and camera.
5. Identify yourself and test your equipment, as shown in Figure 6-5.
Enter your name in the Display Name field and optional subtitle in the 
Headline field (commonly used for job titles). The display name lets viewers 
know who is in each window. (The display name and headline can be turned 
on and off in settings once you enter the studio.)
This is also a good time to verify that your microphone and camera are 
working. Say a few words and watch the green meter go up and down, as 
shown in Figure 6-5. If needed, adjust your camera and audio settings with 
the on-screen controls.
FIGURE 6-5:
Make sure your 
audio and video 
are working in 
StreamYard 
before entering 
the studio.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 113
6. Click Enter Studio.
7. Invite your guests:
a. Click the Invite button on the bottom toolbar.
b. Follow the instructions on copying the link or sending it directly to your guests.
c. When you’re finished with the invites, close the pop-up.
8. Add yourself and your guests to the stage.
After you and your guests are signed into StreamYard and are in the studio, 
the bottom of the screen displays thumbnails of you and your guests, waiting 
in a sort of green room. When you hover your cursor over a thumbnail, the 
Add to Stage button appears. Click the button and that person appears on the 
screen. Have fun trying the different layouts displayed just below the main 
view screen to see which you prefer.
9. Click Record twice and start chatting.
When you click Record a second time, the Record button becomes the End 
Recording button.
10. When you’ve completed your interview, click End Recording twice.
11. Click Return to Dashboard in the upper right.
12. Review your recording, if you want, and then download it:
• To download: Click the three-dot icon next to the name of the recorded 
stream, and then select Download.
• To review and download: On the home screen, click the Past tab under the 
Streams and Recordings heading. Then click View to review your recording. 
When you’re finished, click the Download button.
After you click Download, download the video and audio (MP4 format) files or 
audio only (MP3 format) file from the pop-up that appears.
You can set up the StreamYard meeting but record at a later time, if you want. 
After inviting your guests in Step 8, click Leave Studio in the bottom toolbar. Your 
settings are saved, and you can return to this recording session later from the 
main StreamYard screen by locating your session in the list, clicking Enter Studio, 
verifying your camera and mic, and clicking Enter Studio again.
Recording using hardware
If recording using software has your head spinning, using hardware, such as a 
physical mixer, may simplify things. The input source can be a microphone, a 114 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
computer, an MP3 player, an electronic keyboard, or just about anything with an 
audio output to feed into the mixer.
Some mixers, such as the RØDECaster Pro II and RØDECaster Pro Duo (see 
Chapter 2) even have Bluetooth so you can pair your phone without a wired con￾nection! If your mixer doesn’t include a Bluetooth option, you’ll need to use a 
technique known as mix-minus. Mix-minus enables you to use your audio mixer 
to create a second audio-output mix containing all sources except the connected 
computer providing the call to your guest(s). That second audio-output mix is 
then sent back to your guest(s). The mix is everything minus one source  — 
theirs — hence the name. With this approach your guests don’t hear an echo of 
their voice. For a short video tutorial, go to https://pfdbook.link/mixminus.
As shown in Figure 6-6, your input as the interview host comes from the micro￾phone while your guests’ audio comes from a computer running meeting software 
such as Zoom. The output needs a destination, such as a recording device like the 
Zoom H4n.
Figure 6-6 looks a bit challenging, but it’s not that complex. Whether you have a 
basic four-channel mixer or something the size of a cruise ship, most mixers have 
the same basic layout and features. Plugging in a microphone to a single audio 
channel is straightforward. Adding the stereo output of a destination device (a 
second computer, a digital recorder, and so on) is also simple, provided you have 
the right connecting cables.
FIGURE 6-6:
To prevent your 
guests from 
hearing an echo 
of their voice, you 
need a mix-minus 
setup.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 115
The real fun begins when you need to get your output back to the call-in computer 
and the recording device. To do so, you need to take advantage of your mixer’s Aux 
Send (sometimes called Effects End) port, which is an output port that you will feed 
back to your call-in machine. So the question now becomes, how do you get your 
microphone input sent out the Aux Send?
Most mixers have the capability to create multiple mixes. The main mix is what 
you typically record, but often hidden mixers, called buses, let you create an alter￾native mix. How cool is that? You thought you were just buying one mixer, and 
you get another one (or more) for free! To make use of this additional output mix, 
locate the row of (often red) knobs on your mixer labeled Aux. (If your mixer has 
more than one row of Aux knobs, each row corresponds to a separate Aux Send 
channel.) These knobs are the volume controls for your Aux Send. If you turn up 
the volume on your microphone, whatever is connected to listen to the Aux Send 
output will hear it. By turning the input for the call-in computer on Aux all the 
way down, your guest will hear you clearly but won’t hear themselves.
Prepping Your Green Room for Guests
A podcast guest could be your dad, your mother-in-law, your best friend, or a 
person on the street. It could be the friend of a friend who can get you on the 
phone with your favorite author, actor, or athlete. Regardless of who the guest is, 
you have a second party to worry about when you conduct an interview.
Removing the technical difficulties element means taking the show to the guests 
or bringing the guests to the show. This kind of interview not only is the most fun 
to do but also gives you direct contact with the subject so you can observe body 
language, facial expressions, and reactions to questions and answers.
Welcoming in-studio guests
When guests visit your facility — which is probably a spare room in your house — 
make them feel at home. Offer them something to drink. Take them on a tour of 
your humble abode. Introduce them to your family. The point is to be polite. You 
don’t have to cook dinner for them, but offering a hint of hospitality, be it a glass 
of water (or a beer, if you’ve ever worked with Chuck or Tee), is a nice touch.
It’s also a good idea to get your home and yourself ready to receive guests. Sure, 
Tee has recorded quite a few podcasts in his pajamas, but because he’s working 
with his wife or recording short stories for his podcast, he’s allowed. If fantasy 
and science fiction authors Elizabeth Bear and Scott Lynch ever come over to his 116 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
house for an interview, he wouldn’t be greeting them in his Avenger jammies and 
Stone Brewery slippers.
Okay, maybe he would greet them wearing the Stone slippers, but he would be 
bathed and dressed and have his teeth brushed and hair combed. The key word 
here is guest. Treat them as such. Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. And if you’re a 
guest on someone else’s podcast, the same rules apply. Don’t prop your feet on the 
furniture, don’t demand hospitality, and don’t be a jerk.
The in-studio visit is an audition for both guest and host. If the guest is abrasive, 
abusive, and just plain rude, chances are good that the guest will never be invited 
back. If a host asks unapproved questions, continues to pry into personal matters 
that have nothing to do with the interview, or seems determined to take over the 
interview spotlight as if trying to impress the guest, said guest may never return.
Meeting guests on their own turf
Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. These same rules apply when you take your podcast 
on the road. You may find yourself at a person’s home or place of business, or 
some neutral place. If your meeting was not prearranged, you’re now practicing 
guerrilla journalism. Ambushing unsuspecting people with questions that may not 
strike you as hard and probing but could be to people who don’t expect them. 
Respect your guests, wherever you are when the interview takes place.
One approach for getting good interviews is to ask for permission to interview 
them, whether they’re passersby or experts at their place of business. Shoving a 
microphone in someone’s face and blurting out a question is hardly a great way to 
introduce yourself and your podcast to the world. If the guest you want to inter￾view has a handler or liaison, it’s good protocol to follow the suggestions and 
advice of the guest’s staff.
If you start out with a warm, welcoming smile and explain what you’re doing and 
why, most people open up and are happy to talk.
When interviewing people on the street or in the moment, it’s helpful to identify 
yourself. Michael Butler of The Rock and Roll Geek Show (https://pfdbook.link/
rnrgeek) uses a mic cube around his microphone, also called a mic flag (see 
Figure 6-7). The classic cube usually has a logo identifying the network, show, or 
organization affiliated with the interviewer. You can find mic cubes online 
(unprinted) starting around $25.CHAPTER 6 Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper 117
Whatever your setup, test your equipment before recording an interview. You’re 
out of the controlled environment of your home studio and have to deal with 
ambient noise and uncontrollable background variables. Set up your equipment; 
power up your laptop, mixing board, and mics; and record a few words. Then play 
back your tests and set your levels accordingly.
Ensuring Trouble-Free Recordings
When it comes to recording conversations, here are a few points to keep in mind 
before asking the first question:
» Get permission to record conversations, even if the interview is prear￾ranged. Laws (both federal and state) prohibit the recording of conversations 
without permission, and further restrictions limit broadcasting these conver￾sations. If you plan to record and publish a conversation, get the subject’s 
consent for both beforehand, both verbally and in written communication 
(even email) to make sure your legal issues are covered.
» Test the calling equipment. If you’ve arranged an interview with someone 
for your podcast — say, a favorite musician or politician — prepare for the 
interview. Run a sound check and make sure the recording setup works and 
sounds good.
The bandwidth demand increases the more people you conference through 
your computer. Reception will be affected, so if you know more than one 
person will be involved in the interview, test how many people you can 
FIGURE 6-7:
A mic flag is a 
great way to 
show your brand, 
either on camera 
or on the street, 
when interview￾ing people.118 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
effectively conference. Off-loading the recording to a cloud service such as 
StreamYard can be beneficial.
» Check your batteries. If you’re using a portable recorder (such as the Zoom 
H4n Pro), make sure the batteries are charged and you have spares. (Check 
the spares, too.) Similarly, when recording at home, if you live in an environ￾ment with periodic electrical problems, consider picking up an uninterrupt￾able power supply (or UPS) in case your main power cuts out.
» Check your storage space. Hard drives and solid state devices are getting 
bigger and cheaper, but they don’t have infinite storage space. Audio files can 
be big — especially if you’re recording to a raw format such as WAV or AIFF. If 
you run out of space in the middle of recording an interview, you waste time, 
interrupt the pace, and lose face with your interviewee. If you’re recording 
to a portable recording device, it’s basically the same idea. Know how much 
storage you have, in megabytes or gigabytes, and how long you can record 
at your current bit rate. (We talk more about bit rates in Chapter 9.)
This may sound pessimistic, but be ready for things to go wrong. A guest might 
not show up for an interview. Your new high-tech toy or other technology, if not 
given a proper pre-interview shakedown, may not come through. Prepare to have 
plenty of topics to discuss on your own. Have another recorder running as a sim￾ple backup. Plan for the worst, and you can celebrate like a pro when that incred￾ible interview goes off without a hitch.
After you’ve finished your recording, and perhaps completed your editing, let your 
guest preview the episode before it goes public. This courtesy prevents issues 
later, if a guest wants you to delete some bits. Offer guests a few days or weeks to 
say “Can you make one more change?” or “I love it!”CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 119
Chapter 7
So What Are You Waiting 
For? Record, Already!
Okay, you’ve most likely checked out the hardware and software gadgets 
mentioned in Chapters  2,  3, and  4. In this chapter, we make the bold 
assumption that you’ve purchased your hardware, hooked it up according 
to the supplied documentation (you did read the documentation, right?), down￾loaded your software, and have everything ready to record. This is it! A micro￾phone is pointing in the direction of your mouth, and you are eagerly waiting to 
begin podcasting.
Okay then. What’s stopping you?
Perhaps you have no clue how you sound on your recording equipment, or maybe 
you’re trying to understand why your smooth and sultry voice sounds like you just 
finished a dozen espressos. The problem could be in your audio application’s 
sound settings. Too much pep in the voice, and you sound like Rob Zombie croon￾ing a goth’s delight. Too little amplification, and you’d be better off going to your 
front porch and shouting your podcast’s content.
Before the podcast gets underway with a click or touch of the record button, you 
must set levels. That’s a fancy-schmancy way to say “fiddling with knobs and slid￾ers” on your mixing board or your audio-editing software. Setting levels ensures 
that the signal you’re sending through the microphone is loud and clear. Once the 
technical side is running smoothly, you need to give some thought to timing and

enunciation because how you say your message affects the listeners’ interest in 
what you’re saying.
In this chapter, you learn how to set audio levels, modify your environment 
to capture the best sound. You also find out about pacing, clock management, 
and more.
Did Your Sound Check Clear the Bank?
If you show up early enough for a rock concert, you’ll see roadies setting up 
microphones, playfully waving to the crowd as they speak quickly into a micro￾phone “Check one, check two, check-check-check!” It’s a staple for rock ‘n’ roll￾ers to do a mic check because the fans expect a good performance.
With podcasting, your own mic check should be more involved than saying the 
same word a few times. We recommend that you perform an audio diagnostic just 
to assure yourself (and, if applicable, your guests) that the equipment is working 
and sound is, in fact, reaching your computer. The goal is not only to confirm that 
your mic is picking up sound but also to check the volume of the voices — yours 
and that of whoever else is involved in the podcast.
To test your audio levels, say words that you plan to say in your episode as you 
would actually say them. Also play the sound effects or music that you will use. If 
you have guests, have them do a bit of their introduction. Don’t settle for “how’s 
this?” Get more! Be sure to take your equipment for a test drive before every 
podcast.
Understanding dB levels
Setting levels is easy, provided you know where the decibel (dB) input levels are 
displayed in the software. The decibel unit expresses the intensity of sound, begin￾ning at −9 dB for the least perceptible sound to approximately 130 for an intensely 
loud sound level. Your readout measures how hot you are (in this instance, that’s 
the power of your voice, not how good you look) on the microphone. Audio signal 
strength (measured in decibels) is the amount of power that goes into the signal, 
which affects how clearly it can be heard and how hard it hits the ears. “Loud and 
clear” is good; too much signal strength causes distortion, and that’s a pain to 
listen to.
In vintage radio and audio equipment, a dB signal was represented in a volume unit
(VU) meter — the little needle that bounced in response to your voice. Later, the 
needle was replaced by lights that react to your voice or to sounds around you, CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 121
going from green to yellow to orange to red. What the lights represent is easy to 
translate:
» Green: Well, I can hear you, but wow, are you quiet!
» Yellow-orange: You’re coming in loud and clear.
» Red: You’re in danger of hitting the distortion level (clipping).
» Red with double bars: Your audio will sound distorted.
Volume meters appear differently in different hardware and software (Figure 7-1 
shows the volume meter display for Audacity), but they all serve the same 
purpose: to make sure your content is heard clearly. Your aim, as you speak and 
monitor the volume meters, is to have peak maximum dB levels in the high level 
(low red) without lighting up the double bars. When you attain that average, your 
voice is rising and falling within a good balanced dynamic range. The optimal 
upper range for your voice is in the yellow and orange range — with only the high 
points (when you raise your voice) going into the red occasionally. You can always 
bring up the low spots with some simple post-production tips (described later in 
this chapter).
Because microphones, audio-capture cards, and mixing boards all work at differ￾ent sensitivity levels, it’s best to test the level of your voice before you record. If 
your levels are in the green, you’re loud enough to be heard by your equipment but 
still so soft that people will have to crank up the volume on their computer or 
mobile device, consequently blowing out their eardrums when they listen to a dif￾ferent podcast or playlist.
FIGURE 7-1:

If your recording is too loud (or hot), it tends to cause problems. Listeners have 
their players set for a pleasant, comfortable volume — and suddenly your show 
begins with guns blazing and bagpipes blaring. As your levels reach deep into the 
red, listeners fumble for their players and try to turn down the sound so the pro￾gram can be understandable through its own distortion. Sadly, the modulation is 
such a problem that your voice crackles and growls as it tramples the volume 
limits of your recording equipment, even at the lower volume. Even worse, some 
programs and microphones will cut the signal from the mic for a second, leaving 
you with chunks of missing audio — and you may not discover this until after 
your precious recording is over!
You want to avoid clipping to prevent that distorted sound. Clipping occurs when 
you’re feeding too much signal to your equipment. It can come from many sources, 
including incorrect settings on a microphone or other audio input, incorrect set￾tings on a mixer, or your software preferences. Once audio is clipped, you can’t get 
the original (or intended) quality back.
In achieving a balance in your audio, you could spend the day setting and resetting 
those levels in quest of dB nirvana. That’s time spent but not well spent. It makes 
more sense to practice till you get a pretty good sense of your best working level, 
and then get comfortable speaking into a mic at that level. Time to go mano-a￾mano with setting the levels.
Setting your levels
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to keep your levels in the neigh￾borhood of 0 dB, dipping and spiking when necessary. For podcasting, consistency 
is key. Make sure the mixer, if you have one, is turned on, the mic is plugged in 
and turned on, and the software is running. Now follow these steps to check levels:
CALLING IN THE CREW
It’d be great to set your levels so your lights remain at 0 dB, but recording is a real-world 
activity. Sometimes your meter may never reach yellow, and other times it might hit the 
double red bars. If your goal is to maintain perfect levels from the beginning to the end 
of a recording session, an audio crew can work with you in rehearsal and performance, 
adjusting levels when you go loud and when you go soft.
The downside of hiring a crew is the added expense to producing your podcast. Even 
if the crew is a collection of audio geek friends, you’ll still have to pay for all that pizza 
every time you record.CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 123
1. Begin talking into the mic about your podcast topic or plans.
You can do a scripted test read or talk off the top of your head, but be sure to 
speak in the manner and mood of your podcast.
Instead of speaking to thin air in the vague direction of the mic (or the person 
next to you), speak in the exact direction of the mic (as shown in Figure 7-2). 
Even if the mic is omnidirectional (meaning it picks up sounds from all 
directions at once), it can pick up your voice better this way.
If needed, adjust your microphone stand or boom mic arm so you can address 
your mic at the optimal angle. Boom mic arms, like the one included with MXL’s 
Overstream bundle, tend to be the easiest to adjust.
If you speak directly into the microphone, you might hear some sounds — 
particularly ps and bs — causing an effect known as popping. This issue can be 
fixed with an investment of less than $20 in a windscreen or pop filter, a foam 
or nylon filter that stops the wind made by your mouth from hitting the 
microphone’s diaphragm and causing distortion.
2. While you’re talking (or if you’re monitoring by playing back your test 
takes), keep an eye on your dB levels on the computer screen and adjust 
them as necessary.
If the levels are spiking into the red or double-red area or remaining in the 
green, check your input volume settings on your mixing board or audio-editing 
software. This might require a bit of multitasking on your part — continue to 
adjust the input levels and the distance of your mouth to the microphone while 
talking and watching the input meters.

but far enough to

3. Re-record your voice at the new settings.
Try to speak in the same manner and inflection as you did on the first 
recording.
4. As you review the second take, watch the dB input levels and adjust 
accordingly.
When in doubt, err on the side of caution. Record your volume a little low. You 
can always correct it in post-production. One way to increase the volume later, 
using Audacity, is to select your audio and use the Effect ➪ Amplify feature to 
bring it up.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you’re happy with the results.
After you set your levels, make a note of the settings somewhere, such as in a doc￾ument on your computer, in a notes app on your smartphone, or on its retro 
ancestor — a legal pad and pen. Having a backup copy is useful in case your pref￾erences are lost or fiddled out of whack by someone’s child or best friend playing 
spaceship in your studio. (Yes, even adults enjoy playing spaceship with 
super-cool-looking equipment!) That way, you’ll always have your last known 
settings to reference.
THERE’S A RIGHT WAY AND 
A WRONG WAY . . .
Time for a confession.
When Tee got his MXL990, it was his first studio condenser microphone. He was so 
excited about this microphone that he failed to check the small slip of paper included in 
the package that told him how to talk into it. Perhaps it was the excitement of venturing 
into new frontiers of creativity that made him hook up the equipment without reading 
the directions. Maybe it was a bold assumption that he knew what end to talk into with 
a mic. Whatever the reason, Tee was speaking into the microphone incorrectly (left 
image). His friends in the podosphere, on seeing Tee in action, didn’t have the heart 
to tell him so — or didn’t know any better themselves.
Fortunately, Evo Terra (https://pfdbook.link/evo) is a heartless evil mastermind. 
He told Tee he was doing it incorrectly as any heartless evil mastermind would — on a 
podcast, naturally.CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 125
Noises Off: Capturing Ambient Noise
Part of the charm that is podcasting is just how varied the content is, as well as 
how spontaneous the shows tend to be when the record button is pressed. Some 
podcasters believe that in a true podcast (whatever that is!), the podcaster must 
record everything in one take and deliver the content unedited. This supposed 
mark of authenticity includes any background noise (also called ambient noise) 
you happen to capture while recording — from comforting sounds like rustling 
trees and birdcalls to the more grating ones like pounding car stereos and 
jackhammers.
Hey, if that’s the style of your show, great. However, if you’re trying to take 
listeners to a place in their imagination, read on to find out how to reduce or 
eliminate ambient noise.
All microphones do not behave the same, and condenser microphones work best when 
speaking into them properly, from the side (right image). Tee, reflecting on Evo’s “kind” 
advice, positioned the mic accordingly and continues to do so. When hooking up micro￾phones, refer to the enclosed documentation for additional and essential information 
on getting the best sound out of your microphone.
In short, understand whether your microphone is end addressable, where you talk into 
the end opposite the cable, or side addressable, where you speak into the side. Then you 
can avoid the embarrassment (caught forever) that published photographs may deliver 
upon you . . . regardless of how good your content is. And when in doubt, read any doc￾umentation included with your new gear. It might save you some aggravation and a lit￾tle embarrassment.126 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Identifying ambient noise
As we discuss in Chapter 8, how much you edit depends on what kind of content 
you’re presenting. For example, if you’re doing an off-the-cuff, off-the-wall 
podcast about your life and a typical day in it, you might just grab the VideoMic 
Me-C, plug it into your mobile phone, and head out the door, recording every step 
along the way. This kind of podcast can be (note we said can be) the easiest to 
record. You’re podcasting a slice of Americana, or Britanniana, if you’re in the 
United Kingdom, or Kiwiana if podcasting from the land of hobbits, championship 
rugby, and pavlova. Especially if your goal is to capture the look and feel of your 
culture, ambient noise is not only welcomed but desired — up to a point.
Some podcasters cringe at the mere mention of ambient noise — ambient noise 
like . . . well, what was in Tee’s first podcast. When he podcasted MOREVI: The 
Chronicles of Rafe & Askana back in 2005, he worked to create a magical setting with 
voice, story, music, special effects — a world that was shattered by real-world 
interference such as school buses, kids at recess, UPS trucks, the Virginia com￾muter rail system, and air traffic from two nearby airports. Even if you love the 
source of the ambient noise, sometimes it just doesn’t fit what the podcast is try￾ing to do.
The best noise reduction happens in pre-production. If your podcast could do 
without input from the outside world, strategically schedule recording sessions. 
Pay attention to your environment and record when it’s quiet. You might find that 
the best time is late at night, when traffic is lighter, the kids are in bed, and con￾struction crews aren’t working. For others, the best time is mid-day, when noisy 
neighbors are away at their day jobs. Being attentive and adapting your recording 
sessions can add up to less ambient noise and fewer takes on the mic.
Minimizing ambient noise
Some creativity is in order if you want to reduce the intrusion of the outside world, 
record anytime during the day, and still maintain a budget.
There isn’t an easy solution to podcasting in a noisy world. One not-so-cost￾effective answer is to rent a studio and record your podcast there. Unless you have 
a sponsor who bankrolls the costs, your hobby could easily max out credit cards 
and cast a hungry eye on your nest egg. (Let’s not even go there.)
A somewhat-less-expensive option is to soundproof your home-based recording 
room. This may sound simple, but it can involve a lot of home improvement before 
you have one room where you can be sure the only sound is yours. In 2021, Chuck 
converted a bedroom into a home studio for audio and video podcasting.CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 127
First, he purchased blackout (room darkening) window shades to ensure that he 
could light the room and the people in it directly from the studio lights — even on 
cool winter mornings when the sun is trying to blast straight at the camera. Next, 
to control the ambient sound, he installed wall-to-wall carpeting. It’s amazing 
how much sound is absorbed simply by adding carpet to a room. If you love your 
hardwood floors, buy area rugs instead to at least dampen the echo.
However, the floor isn’t the only place that reflects sound. Chuck also covered the 
ceiling (see Figure 7-3) in soundproofing foam tiles. If he had been doing audio￾only podcasts, he would have covered all the walls as well. Instead, he treated the 
walls off-camera with a combination of soundproofing foam and cloth — don’t 
underestimate the value of simply hanging a duvet on the wall.
Sometimes the simplest option is the best. If you’re a solo audio podcaster, an 
easy way to dampen room echo is to put a blanket over your head and mic while 
you record. It’s a cheap DIY solution provided you can still keep an eye on things 
such as your audio levels.
Renovation, especially if you’re a fan of DIY projects, makes this kind of home￾built studio a possibility, but may not be a practical solution for all homeowners. 
And this kind of aggressive home improvement is seriously frowned upon if you’re 
renting an apartment.
You can keep this type of home renovation affordable and within your lease agree￾ment terms with the following:
» Stuff towels under the door. It decreases the amount of sound inside your 
house that can filter into your recording area.
FIGURE 7-3:

» Keep the microphone as far away from your computer as possible. If the 
computer’s fan is audible, it can be a noticeable distraction and take away 
from the ambiance you’re trying to create.
» Turn off any ceiling fans, floor heaters, air conditioners, or room 
ionizers. With fewer appliances running, you have less chance of additional 
ambient sound being created.
» If you encounter ambient noise that you don’t want in your podcast, 
wait a few moments. Pause until the noise subsides, and then pick up your 
podcast a few lines before the interruption. That’s for the sake of post-production: 
With a substantial gap in your podcast activity, you can easily narrow down 
where your edits are needed.
When noise interferes with your podcast, leaving gaps of silence so you know 
where to edit isn’t a foolproof method. Always set aside enough time to listen to 
your podcast — and really listen, not just play it back while you clean the office or 
call a friend. Make sure the levels are even, no segments are repeated, and the 
final product is ready for uploading and posting.
When recording a podcast on location, make sure the ambiance  — be it a 
particularly busy crosswalk at a street corner, a frequented bar, or backstage at a 
concert  — doesn’t overwhelm your voice. Background noise belongs in (well, 
yeah) the background. Its intent is to set a tone for the podcast, not to become the 
podcast itself. If possible, do a few test recordings in the space to see how much 
volume you’ll need and how close you should be to the mic.
Take Your Time and Hurry Up: Pacing 
and Clock Management
Podcasts, whether short and sweet or epic and ambitious, all share something in 
common: the need for pacing. As a rule, you don’t want to blurt out the aim or 
intent of your podcast in the opening 5 minutes and then pad the remaining 10 or 
15 with fluff. Nor do you want to drone on and on until suddenly you have to rush 
into why you’re podcasting on this particular day about this particular topic. Give 
yourself ample time to set the mood comfortably and competently and make it to 
the intent of the podcast without dawdling. Respect your listeners’ time and don’t 
overstay your welcome.
The trick in pacing is to understand how much time you have to get your message 
across. Where to start?CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 129
Find a clock, watch, or stopwatch and for 1 minute (and only 1 minute) sit quietly 
and do nothing, say nothing, and remain perfectly still. That 1 minute will feel like 
a short eternity. Now imagine that 1-minute times 15. (No, no, no — do not repeat 
this exercise for 15 minutes. There’s a fine line between an exercise and a 
complete waste of time.) You can see that 15 minutes gives you ample time to get 
to the message of your podcast. The journey you take your listeners on doesn’t 
necessarily have to occupy all that time — be it 15, 20, or 30 minutes — but you 
have time to play. That’s the most important thing to remember as you set your 
best podcasting pace.
Take the potato out of your 
mouth and enunciate
It isn’t out of the ordinary to fire up the mic and launch into your podcast with 
enough energy and vitality to power a small shire in England. Nothing wrong with 
that — until you go back and listen to yourself. Your words, phrases, and thoughts 
will be running together and forming one turbulent, muddy stream-of-thought. 
You’re having a tough time understanding what the podcast is about and what the 
podcaster is saying — and you’re the podcaster!
One way to get a grip on pacing yourself through a podcast is by enunciating — 
pronouncing your words distinctly, explaining your topic clearly — and there’s no 
better way to do that than to slow your speech slightly and listen carefully to cer￾tain consonants (for example, the t, s, and d sounds). Proper enunciation can help 
you set a comfortable pace and keep you from rushing through your presentation. 
In fact, it isn’t a bad idea to over-enunciate. In the excitement of recording, over￾enunciation forces you to slow down, clean up your pronunciation, and make your 
voice easily understandable. If you think you’re speaking just a little too slowly, 
you’re probably going just the right speed. (However, if a rapid pace is part of your 
presentation, stick with it.)
PODCASTING GOES PRO
Broadcasting networks such as CNN, FOX News, BBC, and others often take to the 
podosphere as a way to market their shows and reach a worldwide audience. Along 
with talk-radio personalities, other major players in broadcasting such as NPR, ESPN, 
Disney, and ABC use podcasting as a way to reach audiences that may have missed 
their original broadcasts. One of Chuck’s favorites is a show from “the other ABC,” the 
Australian Broadcasting Corporation, called Dr. Karl on TripleJ. Tee enjoys NPR’s Note to 
Self and Mike Rowe’s The Way I Heard It, both of which were recommended to him by his 
podcasting app. Thanks to podcasting, all of us can learn more about bee stings, double 
rainbows, and tidal waves on our own schedules.130 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Speaking a few tongue-twisters before going on mic helps your enunciation and 
warms up your voice. Here are some easy ones that emphasize the problem con￾sonants that are lost when speaking too quickly:
» Toot the tin trumpet, Tommy, in time.
» Pop prickly pickles past the peck of parsley.
» See sand slip silently through the sunlit seals.
» The sixth sheik’s sheep is sick.
» Will Wendy remember wrecking the white rocker?
If you perform a search online for tongue twisters, you can find a wide variety of 
classic and original warm-ups for the voice. Or compose your own.
And now let’s take a break for 
station identification
Ever notice that certain podcasts suddenly break in with a show ID or take some 
other marked break and then play their sponsors’ spots (if they’re lucky enough 
to have sponsors)? They’re trying to emulate — and maybe make themselves eas￾ily syndicated by  — conventional radio. You know, the broadcasting industry. 
Clock management is the careful, standardized interruption of a typical radio 
broadcast — usually every 15 minutes in a 1-hour slot — for such necessities as 
station identification, show identification, public-service announcements (PSAs), 
and (of course) commercials.
Another nice bonus of following clock management is that you have several points 
in your show to give a quick show ID (something like “You’re listening to Tech￾norama with Chuck and Kreg") to let people know who you are. Chuck and Kreg 
like to collect audio clips from celebrities for their show IDs because, as seen in 
Figure 7-4, astronauts are cool! This show ID is a great way to catch the attention 
of people who may be tuning in to the middle of your podcast. Although show IDs 
are usually expected at the top of the hour and on the half-hour, you can drop in 
a show ID anytime you want.
The following is a good general timetable for clock management for a 30-minute 
show format:
» :00: Programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, advertisements
» :10: Programming break, PSAs, advertisements
» :20: Programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, advertisements
» :30: Programming break, PSAs, advertisementsCHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 131
These breaks vary in length but can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. No 
surprise that this is where the old-school podcasters get a bit restless. They find 
clock management and show ID redundant, if not frivolous. Why bother with a show 
ID or clock management? People have downloaded your feed specifically. They know 
what they’re listening to, so what purpose does clock management serve?
It all comes back to what you see for your podcast’s future. If you intend to remain 
in the podosphere, it comes down to your format, your way. No constraints from 
the FCC. It’s just you, the microphone, your listeners, and throwing caution to the 
wind. However, if you set your sights on taking your passion project to the air￾waves, — AM, FM, satellite radio, or online streaming — you have to format your 
show to fit the standards.
Think about the possibilities of your podcast and where you see yourself with it 
several months (or years) down the road. Maybe a bit of management and organi￾zation will aid your podcast in jumping to the airwaves.
Concerning Tangents and Their 
Val — Oh, Look, a Butterfly!
It’s hardly surprising that broadcasters who have no experience in broadcasting 
tend to stray from their topic once the microphone goes hot, and then lose them￾selves in the thickets and thorns of tangents. Defensive podcasters claim that’s 
FIGURE 7-4:

ID for his podcast

2012.132 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
part of the charm of podcasting, but that charm fades as the topic gets closer to 
serious. If (for example) you launch a podcast dedicated to The Witcher series but 
wander into a discussion of the growing concern of television violence, don’t be 
surprised if your audience wanders away.
It’s worth repeating: Stay focused on the intent of your podcast. Remaining true 
to your podcast’s subject matter isn’t just about staying within your running time; 
it also makes clear to your listeners that, yes, you have a message and will deliver 
it. Your listeners have expectations based on your show’s published description or 
the verbal intro at the top of the episode. When people listen, you want them to 
feel assured that what they hear is what you’ve described.
Read on to find out how you can make tangents work and how to smoothly get 
back on topic after you’ve taken your side trip.
“Say, that reminds me of something . . .”
A tangent can be a creative opportunity. You don’t necessarily treat tangents as 
strictly verboten in podcasting. If your tangent is related to, or benefits, your topic, 
it can be effective and engaging.
Say your commentary begins with “Anyone notice how smartphones are no longer 
just phones but tiny personal digital assistants that can be easily monitored and 
hacked into?” You cover that for a bit, and then break off on a tangent about phone 
etiquette and the lack of manners it brings out in people. This tangent will keep 
your listeners engaged, which can count as much as staying on topic.
What if your podcast isn’t so structured, though? Nothing’s wrong with hitting 
record and forging ahead into the great unknown of the next 15 or 20 minutes, as 
long as you have an idea of where you want to go. Tangents are terrific in moder￾ation, but keep them at least (well, yeah) tangentially related to the subject matter 
of your podcast. If, say, your podcast is about movies but your review of Doctor 
Strange suddenly goes into the decline of the comic book industry (regardless of 
the onslaught of comic-books-to-film productions), you still have a sense of 
focus. However, if your review of Doctor Strange wanders into how your cat is 
throwing up hairballs every time you podcast or your car’s sunroof chose to stop 
working, your audience may grow frustrated enough to stop listening.
“But getting back to what 
I was saying earlier . . .”
When you’re podcasting for 15 or 20 minutes (or longer), it’s okay to take the 
scenic route with your discussion, but make sure you return to the point you CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 133
wanted to make in this installment. The listener’s delight in podcasts is often the 
revelation that individuals who (in many cases) have never set foot in a recording 
studio can produce entertaining and even informative shows. Sometimes mean￾dering back to the point is part of that delight.
For instance, a podcast might begin with something in the headlines — say, a new 
marketing strategy launched by Apple for the iPhone to reach a wider client base. 
This can lead to a variety of topics in the discussion, such as the following:
» Smartphones that begin extending into other functionality, such as playing 
games on the PlayStation Network or providing Wi-Fi hotspots
» Costs for iPhone services from AT&T, Sprint, and other carriers
» Ways that carriers could bring down the costs of services
» Continued shortcomings and disappointments from the smartphone industry
But in the last 5 to 10 minutes, a simple segue like “So, to recap our thoughts on 
this bold marketing strategy from Apple” can successfully steer you, or you and 
your co-hosts, back to the aim and intent of your podcast. When you return 
deliberately from a tangent, your listening audience returns too and knows the 
destination as well as the scenery they went through to get there.
When it comes to staying on track, a script has a distinct advantage over an out￾line. (We hit on the topic of using a script versus an outline in Chapter 5.) And 
during an interview (see Chapter 6), having a list of questions is important, but 
don’t be afraid to ask impromptu questions — you can always go back to your 
prepared list.
THE NAME SAYS IT ALL
Unless you’re an established brand such as Joe Rogan or Dave Ramsey, your show 
name is your calling card. For example, with the Astronomy Cast podcast (https://
pfdbook.link/astronomycast), the name tells you right away what the show covers: 
galaxies, stars, gravity, black holes, and extra-solar planets. Once you have a topic for 
your show, the name should convey what the show is about.

Getting Started with Audacity
Now it’s time to put that planning and practicing into action. To show you how to 
get started recording, we use Audacity (https://pfdbook.link/audacity). This 
free popular software package, which we introduce in Chapter  1, is shown in 
Figure 7-5.
FIGURE 7-5:
Audacity is 
popular among 
podcasters 
because it’s free 
and it makes it 
easy to get start 
recording.
(continued)CHAPTER 7 So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already! 135
To record a podcast in Audacity, follow these simple steps:
1. Make sure that your microphone is plugged in.
The microphone has to be plugged in if you want Audacity to recognize it.
2. Download and install Audacity for your computer’s operating system 
(Windows, macOS, or Linux) from https://pfdbook.link/audacity.
3. Start the Audacity app.
4. Set your output and input devices:
a. Click the Audio Setup button and choose Playback Device from the menu that 
appears, and then choose the device to use to listen to your audio. This device is 
commonly your built-in speakers or headphone jack.
b. Click the Audio Setup button again and choose Recording Device. Then choose 
the input device you will use to record. The input device is usually your USB 
microphone or audio mixer. Note that other devices might have micro￾phones, such as webcams.
If you don’t see your audio device under Playback Device or Recording Device, 
double-check your connections and power to make sure everything is con￾nected. After you’ve inspected connections, click the Audio Setup button and 
select Rescan Audio Devices to see if the devices appear where you expect.
5. When you’re ready to record, click the red record button in the upper left.
Audacity creates a track and begins recording. As you speak your words of 
wisdom to the world, the meters move and a waveform is created.
Audacity comes with a terrific noise reduction function that attempts to 
digitally identify offending noise and remove it from the recording. To do this 
effectively and efficiently, though, Audacity needs to have a clean sample of the 
room’s natural audio (or background noise), called the noise floor (or “room 
tone”) in professional settings. At the beginning or end of your recording, 
record 5 to 10 seconds of your recording environment, leaving the mics open 
but saying nothing. Later, when you’re doing post-production (discussed in 
Chapter 8) you can use this sample with Audacity’s Noise Reduction feature (in 
the Effects menu). This method can reduce (if not completely remove) your 
background noise.
6. When you’re finished, click the square stop button in the upper left.
And just like that, you’ve recording a podcast. Now you know why so many pod￾casters love Audacity.CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 137
Chapter 8
Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8!
Although a high-tech activity like podcasting doesn’t qualify as quaint, the 
charm of podcasting — whether produced by a major studio or by friends 
with a microphone and a laptop — is its inherent, homespun quality. Steve 
Jobs once described podcasting as the Wayne’s World of radio. (No kidding, he said 
that on ABC in 2005; go to https://pfdbook.link/jobs-podcasting.) Podcasts, 
much like the classic Saturday Night Live sketch depicted, are often done on a 
shoestring budget and recorded in one take with no editing. All the trip-ups and 
tangents are captured for posterity and sent to MP3 players everywhere. These 
unpolished moments are part of the grassroots appeal that podcasting is not only 
known for but prides itself on nurturing as new and innovative podcasters enter 
the podosphere.
It’s been our experience that many top-rated podcasting hosts know nothing 
about the editing process. However, it’s worthwhile to understand the ins and 
outs of a podcast production. Taking time to review and polish your podcast can 
make the difference between a listenable podcast and an incoherent mess of audio. 
For example, you might want to eliminate the sound of a train going by or silence 
a cough that would otherwise distract your listeners from a brilliant riposte. This 
chapter shows you how to use editing to shape your podcast while retaining its 
natural atmosphere, how to add depth to that atmosphere with music, and how to 
give the final touch to your podcast’s format with an introduction and an exit.

podcast
» Introducing intros and outros138 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
A Few Reasons to Consider Editing
Take a serious look at the mood you want to convey with your podcast. From 
there, you can judge how intense your editing workload will be. The following list 
covers several cases where you should consider adding editing to your podcast 
production workflow:
» Elevate your production quality. You can’t always get everything right on 
the first take — and sometimes not even on the second or third. Editing 
makes it sound as though you got even hard-to-pronounce names and 
tricky tongue twisters right on the first try. What’s more, you can drop in 
pre-produced clips with just the right amount of space before and after 
to give your podcast that polished feel.
» Remove boring material. You’ve probably watched a live show or listened 
to live audio in which the content gets dull or everyone runs out of things to 
say. The only thing worse than aimless rambling are deafening seconds of 
dead air. Listeners can fast forward, change the channel, or just turn it off. 
Podcasters can avoid this situation with editing. However, while taking out 
the boring bits, make sure you maintain continuity.
» Correct ambient noise. As we explain in Chapter 7, ambient noise is the 
natural and spontaneously occurring noise picked up when recording a 
podcast. If you’re recording a story or setting the stage for a historic drama 
and a passing siren or the rumble of a garbage truck makes it into your 
recording, that noise can distract the audience. Therefore, you should 
control and minimize ambient noise.
» Adjust the running time. Suppose that you just wrapped up your latest 
podcast with a great interview, but you have 90 minutes of interview for 
a 30-minute podcast. You could run the whole thing, unedited, but that 
might test the patience of your audience (as well as your bandwidth and file 
storage). Or you could split the interview into two 45-minute interviews — or 
three 30-minute interviews. In this approach to editing, everyone wins. Editing 
can increase your productivity by rescuing discussions and content that would 
otherwise be hard to shoehorn into one podcast.
» Clean up scripted material. Some podcasters argue that the true podcast is 
done in one take, but as podcasting matures as a medium, audiences become 
more demanding. Expectations for a podcast change when it includes scripted 
material. Unlike the option of elevating your production quality in the first bullet, 
editing is a necessity in these situations. With dramatic readings and productions, 
moments of “ah” and “um” should be edited out to maintain the clarity of the story 
as well as maintain the mood or atmosphere established in your reading.
With the popularity of storytelling in the podcast universe, professionalism 
and performance are the keys to a good product — and usually that means CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 139
(yep!) editing. Lots of it. If you feel that editing would mar the spontaneity 
of your podcast — but still want to present literature or other scripted 
material — ask yourself how good you think Avengers: Endgame would had 
been if Josh Brolin and Robert Downey, Jr. did that moment in one take. 
Imagine their dialogue sounding like this:
• Thanos: I am . . . uuuhhhhhh . . . inevitable. Yeah.
• Tony Stark: Ummm . . . and I *sneezes suddenly — sniffle sniffle* . . . am Iron 
*ahem* Man.
Not what we would call riveting. With scripted material, editing is a must.
Do you want to throw the book across the room, screaming “These jerks just 
spoiled Avengers: Endgame”? Come on, it came out in 2019.
Editing with Audacity
Editing out breaks, stammers, and trip-ups may sound easy, but there’s a science 
to it. If you cut off too much from a clip, one word comes right on top of another, 
and you sound unnatural. If you don’t cut off enough, pauses last too long between 
thoughts.
When you’re editing audio, the key is to review, review, review. When you’ve 
completed your first pass of edits, play the episode again. Listen without distrac￾tion, and keep an ear out for any odd edits or spots that might need attention.
You can choose from many audio applications, each with its own way to edit 
stumbles, bumbles, and moments of silence to honor a lost thought. For all these 
applications, you should follow the same general steps:
1. Find the unwanted content.
2. Give your clip about a half second of silence between edits.
3. Review the edit, making sure it sounds smooth and natural. An effective edit 
doesn’t sound like an edit. Any change to the audio should be unnoticeable.
But instead of reading about it, how about doing it? In this section, we cover basic 
editing skills using Audacity (https://pfdbook.link/audacity). Audacity is a 
popular audio-editing software package in podcasting due to its availability on 
many platforms and (let’s be honest) its price (free). With the open-source com￾munity behind it, this digital audio workstation (DAW) offers you many incredible 
options, some of which we will cover here. If you’re using another audio-editing 
software package, the steps are similar enough for you to apply to your own project.140 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
At this point, we assume you have just finished recording something awesome 
with Audacity (see Chapter 7 for instructions) or have opened a saved project. If 
you have an audio file from another source, such as a portable recorder, you can 
import it by choosing File ➪ Import. Now follow these steps to make a basic edit:
1. Find the segment that you want to edit.
To view the entire timeline of your project, click the fit project in window icon 
(labeled in Figure 8-1).
You can easily navigate between the selected segment of your timeline and the 
project timeline as a whole with the fit project in window and fit selection in 
window icons.
2. Click the selection icon (labeled in Figure 8-1) and then click and drag 
across the unwanted segment.
The unwanted segment is highlighted, as shown in Figure 8-2.
This is a good time to click the fit selection in window icon and double-check 
that the selection border doesn’t go into the recorded content you want to keep.
FIGURE 8-1:

tools at the top of

FIGURE 8-2:

content in the 
timeline.CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 141
3. Click the segment between your two cuts and then press the Delete key 
(Mac) or the Backspace or Delete key (Windows).
To remove the unwanted segment, you can also choose Edit  ➪   Cut or you can 
press ⌘ +X (Mac) or Ctrl+X (Windows).
Do not use the Trim command. (Here’s the command not to use: Edit  ➪   
Remove Special  ➪   Trim Audio or ⌘ +T for Mac and Ctrl+T for Windows.) You 
may think you’re trimming unwanted content, but it does the opposite — 
leaving you with only the content you wanted to edit out. Ack!
4. Review the clip.
5. If the edit doesn’t sound natural to you, undo the changes by choosing 
Edit  ➪   Undo Change of Position Region or by pressing ⌘ +Z (Mac) or 
Ctrl+Z (Windows), and trying again.
You’re allowed multiple undos in Audacity, so you can go back to the beginning 
point of your editing in case you aren’t happy with the sound of the edit.
Making Your Musical Bed and Lying 
in It: Background Music
A few podcasters like to add atmosphere in their individual podcast with bed 
music — a background soundtrack. Sometimes the bed music lasts only a minute 
or so until the hosts return from a break. Other times, the soundtrack is looped 
and plays throughout the podcast, fading out if the hosts bring in another source 
of audio (voice mail, other podcast promos, ads, and so on).
HATE EDITING? GET REAL
Is it an absolute rule that you must edit your podcast? Certainly not! Some would argue 
that a performance is at its best when your actors are stammer-free, but back in 1938 
there was a radio drama chock-full of trip-ups, stutters, and stammers. With all this 
going against its production, the Mercury Theatre terrified a nation with its adaptation 
of H.G. Wells’s War of the Worlds, arguably the first reality-based entertainment (well, a 
realistic simulation of reality, anyway) unleashed on America. The ubiquitous mistakes 
intensified the illusion of reality. If your podcast is entertainment anchored in reality, 
you can probably avoid the arduous editing process. Again, it depends on the content 
you’re podcasting.142 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Regardless of the length of the loop, you must obtain permission from the artists 
to use their music and also give them audible credit at the beginning or end of 
your podcast. If you’re using shareware music, such as that from Freesound 
(https://pfdbook.link/freesound), giving audible credit is one of the condi￾tions you must agree to. Other options include using music loops found in Garage￾Band, Audition, or Logic Pro.
Finding the right balance
As you add bed music, incorporate sound effects, and bring in prerecorded audio 
from other sources (such as H4n Pro recordings or a Zoom call), the sound of your 
podcast gets more complex. Balance becomes not only harder but more essential. 
(Note, for example, the various volume levels of the multiple tracks in 
Figure 8-3.)
Bed music can add atmosphere to your podcast, but you must find a proper bal￾ance between talking and the soundtrack.
If your looped music is too soft, it could be mistaken as unwanted ambient noise 
or some kind of technical difficulty such as a stray signal bleeding into the pod￾caster’s wireless microphone. Music too indistinct to hear can be a distraction, 
particularly during quiet moments or pauses in the conversation.
When bed music is too loud, your voice is lost in the melody. Music, especially 
classical music and selections that rise and fall in intensity (like any good Queen 
FIGURE 8-3:
Adding multiple 
tracks is easy, 
but balancing 
them can be 
challenging.CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 143
album), can be tricky to mix into a conversation. The background music shouldn’t 
be so loud that you have to pump up your voice track to be heard. Your bed music 
should remain in the background as a setting.
Applying bed music the right way
When you’re setting audio levels, you want to find the best blend of music and 
voice. Both tracks should work together and not struggle for dominance.
Always listen to the podcast using headphones and your computer speakers before 
uploading to the internet — review, review, review, (as we said earlier) and find 
that balance.
To avoid music that’s too soft or too loud, keep the following points in mind:
» Experiment with levels for the music before you record voice. Watch your 
decibel level meter and set your music between −11 and −16 dB, depending 
on the music or sound effects.
» When you’re comfortable with the bed’s level, lay down a voice track and 
see how your project’s overall levels look on the decibel level meter.
Remember, your aim is to keep your voice in the 0 or red area without 
over-modulating. With the music bed now behind your voice, it’s much 
easier to hit the red without effort.
» Avoid uneven music, or music that suddenly dips low or has moments 
of intensity. The best music-bed-friendly loops have an even sound (whether 
driving and dramatic or laid-back and relaxed) and an even level.
» Experiment with putting your music in strategic places. Rather than playing 
music throughout the podcast, consider using it as an intro or outro. You might 
even use a short version of your music as you transition to and from ads or 
promos to give listeners an auditory clue of the upcoming change in content.
Setting volume levels for bed music
Each audio application has its own way to change volume dynamically, but the 
basic process is the same. In this section, you use Audacity to bring music into 
your podcast at full volume and then balance it to be just audible enough in the 
background:
1. Click the selection tool (labeled in Figure 8-1) and then click at the 
10-second mark of your timeline, placing an edit line there.144 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
2. Move the cursor to the Track Name until it becomes a hand, as shown 
in Figure 8-4.
The hand icon is the time shift tool, which takes an entire track of content and 
places it elsewhere along the project’s timeline.
3. Click and drag your audio to the edit line you created in Step 1.
4. Import the music file you want to use as bed music:
a. Choose File  ➪   Import  ➪   Audio.
b. Browse for and select the music file you want to use.
c. Click Open to begin the import process.
Although you can import MP3 files directly into Audacity when you’re editing, 
you shouldn’t be working with compressed files. It’s just too easy to lose quality 
along the way.
5. Zoom in to the opening of your audio.
The envelope icon (labeled in Figure 8-1) allows you to dynamically control the 
audio levels over a timeline.
6. Click anywhere in the track of recently imported music.
The left side featuring the audio track name becomes highlighted in blue.
FIGURE 8-4:
Use the hand 
cursor to control 
when audio starts 
in your timeline.CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 145
7. Click the envelope icon on the toolbar.
Blue bars appear at the top and bottom of your audio timeline, indicating that 
the envelope tool is selected.
8. Click the blue bar at the top of your timeline at the beginning of the 
music and a second time farther in the timeline, for example, at the 
15-second point.
The two points indicate the transition from maximum audio to minimum audio 
(such as 15 seconds).
9. Click and drag the second set of points to the 0.5 dB mark, as shown in 
Figure 8-5.
You now have a fade-down of the music that maintains its subdued volume 
behind the voiceover.
10. Click the selection icon (labeled in Figure 8-1), click at the beginning of the 
timeline, and then click Play to review your podcast.
Now you can change the levels as needed to set the music at a level you think 
works best.

Making an Entrance: Intros
Now that your podcast has a solid lead-in and a cue to fade out — or you have a 
loop throughout your podcast that sets a tone — your podcast is beginning to 
solidify. Be proud of the way your podcast is maturing.
But when the microphone comes on, do you know the first words you’ll say? For 
some listeners, you’re about to make a first impression. What do you want that 
first impression to be? Are you looking for something spontaneous every time, or 
do you want to create a familiar greeting that makes listeners feel like old friends?
You can make a first impression with your listeners with an intro, which is the first 
thing the listener hears. Consider the ten simple words that became the signature 
introduction for George Lucas’s Star Wars saga:
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away
Or from another science fiction franchise, this time with only four words:
Space. The Final Frontier.
Even if you’re not vying to be the next George Lucas or Gene Roddenberry, a good 
first impression is important. Something with an original flair and panache is 
going to make a far more lasting impression than “Yo, what’s up? It’s [insert web￾lebrity’s/influencer’s name here].” No matter who you are, this is a moment that 
can establish your podcast as something that people will enjoy and eagerly await 
from episode to episode. You want the first impression to be unique, lasting, and 
positive.
Consistent, iconic intros have a subtle flair of professionalism. You’re announcing 
to your audience that the show is on the launchpad, you’re ready, and the journey 
is about to begin.
Theme music
How about a catchy theme? Just as television and motion picture themes establish 
a thumbprint in pop culture, an opening theme — be it a favorite song (used with 
permission!) or an original composition — can be just the right intro for your 
podcast. Perhaps you have a friend in the wide world of podcasting who can help 
with audio production. Ask — you might be surprised how willing other podcast￾ers are to assist.CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 147
Software applications such as GarageBand, Audition, and Logic Pro offer royalty￾free loops that you can easily edit into your own podcast intro. Other great free 
music sources include Freesound (https://pfdbook.link/freesound) and the 
YouTube Audio Library (https://pfdbook.link/youtubemusic), which also 
includes sound effects. If you have a little cash in the coffers, check out a mem￾bership with Envato Elements (https://pfdbook.link/envanto) for an astound￾ing collection of royalty-free music, jingles, and sound effects.
Royalty-free means you’re free to use the audio clip without paying a license fee. 
You may still need to purchase the audio.
Intro greeting
Some podcasters use quick, snappy intro greetings for their podcasts. When Adam 
Christianson produced his long-running podcast, The MacCast, he opened every 
show with a heavy rock riff and the salutation “Hey, Mac geeks, it’s time for the 
MacCast, the show for Mac geeks by Mac geeks.” Other podcasts, such as Tales 
from the Archives (https://pfdbook.link/mopo), create an imaginative setting as 
the producers create a more complex intro with music, sound effects, and original 
dialogue. Whether elaborately produced or just a simple welcome, a consistent 
greeting serves to bring listeners into your corner of the podosphere.
In a spoken introduction, include the following elements:
» Show’s name
» Names of the hosts
» Location of the podcast
» Tagline identifying the show
Brainstorm a few ideas on how to introduce your particular podcast. For example, 
try these approaches on for size:
» “Good morning, Planet Earth! You’re listening to My Corner: A Slice of 
Cyberspace, and I’m your host, Tee Morris.”
» “From Washington, D.C., welcome to My Corner: A Slice of Cyberspace.”
» “With a perspective on politics, technology, and life in general, it’s Tee Morris 
with the My Corner podcast.”
As you see in these examples, you can mix and match the elements to drop into an 
intro. Come up with what feels right for you and your podcast and stick with it. 148 PART 2 The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
After you’ve put together your greeting, you can either record it and use it as a 
drop-in (an isolated audio clip that you can use repeatedly), or you can script it and 
record it with each session. Whatever method you choose, a greeting is another 
way of bringing your audience into your podcast.
Regardless of your episode’s overall length, try to keep your introduction short. 
For over a decade, Chuck had a 90-second intro full of music and audio clips to set 
the mood, but it was 45 seconds before he would jump in live with “Welcome to 
Technorama.” After some good advice from friends, he shortened the music to 
10 seconds to get the audience to the intro and the content as quickly as possible. 
Branding is one thing, but try not to go overboard — 10 to 15 seconds is a good 
guideline.
Exit, Stage Left: Outros
Now that you’ve reached the end of your message or time limit, what do you do? 
Do you just say “Thanks, everyone; see you next time” or a basic “Bye”? Or do you 
want to go out with a bit of fanfare? Whatever you decide, an outro is much like an 
intro — as simple or elaborate as you want to make it. Your outro is your final 
word, closing statement, and grand finale (at least for this episode).
Putting together an outro is the same as putting together an intro except you’re 
doing it at the end, so review the earlier suggestions for intros. You can keep it 
simple by saying “Until next time” and switching off. But before taking a shortcut 
to the end, check out this section for some ways to spiff up your outro.
Leave the audience wanting more
Your outro can be the final word from the host, and it should be your bow during 
the curtain call. A signature farewell is a classy way of saying “This podcast is a 
wrap. Thanks for listening.” On Technorama, Chuck and Kreg have a signature 
sign-off that starts with Chuck saying, “And until next time, a binary high five.” 
To which Kreg always responds, “1–0–1.” It has become such a well-known piece 
of the show that listeners writing or calling to leave feedback close their pieces 
with the same tag.
If you’ve edited your show and removed some mistakes, consider using those in a 
short series of outtakes (or bloopers) at the end. Chuck does this for his work pod￾cast Break Point (https://pfdbook.link/breakpoint). Outtakes humanize the 
host and entertain listeners — while keeping them listening right up to the end.CHAPTER 8 Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 8! 149
If you can’t think of anything overly clever, a consistent exit such as, “This has 
been my podcast, protected by a Creative Commons license. Thanks for listening” 
works, too.
Another possibility for your outro could be a scripted list of credits: websites 
where past shows can be downloaded, resources can be endorsed, and special 
thanks can be given to various supporters.
When listing credits, take care that your thank-you’s and acknowledgments don’t 
ramble for too long. Some podcasters reserve a full list of end credits for special 
podcasts, such as an end-of-the-season or even final episode. One minute is a 
good length for ending credits, providing plenty of time to mention relevant web￾sites, tuck in the obligatory “Tune in next week” statement, and ask for com￾ments and endorsements on your favorite podcast directory.
Coming soon to a media player near you
Just as television shows drop teasers of what will be coming up next week, pod￾casters can give hints as to what is planned for future podcasts. Montages of what 
is coming in the next episode give listeners a quick synopsis of what is to come.
Previews for future podcasts can be difficult to plan, mainly because of the spon￾taneous nature of podcasting that the medium prides itself on. Many podcasters 
have no idea what will be on the agenda for their next show until a short time 
before recording. However, if you can provide a glimpse of what’s to come, this 
kind of outro serves as a commitment to the audience that more content is on 
its way.
As mentioned with intros, your outro can use one of these approaches or combine 
them. Find what best fits your podcast and stick with it. The more consistency 
your podcast has, the more professional it will sound.3

Shrink That Puppy and 
Slap a Label on It
You’ve finished your final edit. (And if you think we’re skirting blasphemy 
whenever we use the e word, trust us — creativity sometimes demands a 
sacrifice.) At last you’re ready to compress your mondo-super-sized AIFF 
or WAV file to the format that invokes traumatic memories from RIAA representa￾tives everywhere: MP3.
The MP3 format was designed to reduce the amount of data (via compression) 
required for digitized audio while retaining the quality of the original recording. 
MP3 files are the best way to keep audio small enough to make it a quick-and￾easy download, and it’s this format that podcasting uses to get content efficiently 
from podcaster to podcatching client. Although creating MP3s is a simple enough 
process, you do need to make some tradeoffs between quality and compression.
In this chapter, we help you understand the technical details involved in turning 
your raw recording into an MP3 file for distribution.

compression

rates
» Dissecting ID3 tags154 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
A Kilobit of Me, and a Whole Lot 
of You: Understanding Kbps
The compression process begins with proper bit rate setting, measured in Kbps 
(kilobits per second). Bit rate is a method of measuring data transmission from 
one point to the next. The higher the Kbps value, the more data being transferred 
between two points. The more data being transferred per second, the better the 
quality of information. With each rate of data transfer offered by recording appli￾cations, you can digitally reproduce the various qualities of audio:
» 8 Kbps matches the vocal quality of a telephone conversation.
» 32 Kbps yields audio quality similar to AM radio.
» 96 Kbps yields audio quality similar to FM radio.
» 128 Kbps matches audio CD quality and is the most common Kbps setting 
used for MP3 compression of music.
» 192 Kbps is a higher quality Kbps setting and is used for MP3 music compres￾sion. You get better audio sound but larger data files.
You aren’t married to this listing of Kbps by any stretch of imagination. Tweak ’til 
you find the Kbps best suited for your podcast.
The higher the bit rate, the larger the file size, but the smaller the bit rate, the 
lower the audio quality. A good idea is to experiment. Compress your podcast 
using one bit rate, save it that way, and then change your bit rate to something 
higher (or lower), save it, and play back each clip to compare sound quality and 
file size. When you find that happy medium between quality and compression, 
stick with that. If you want to skip experimentation, refer to the suggested com￾pression settings outlined on the cheat sheet available online. (See the Introduc￾tion for details on the cheat sheet.)
Changing bit rates in Audacity is easy:
1. Import your audio (a WAV or an AIFF of your edited and polished audio 
file) into Audacity by choosing File  ➪   Import  ➪   Audio, locating and 
selecting your audio file, and then clicking Open.
After you’ve imported the audio into Audacity, it’s simply a matter of exporting 
it with new settings.
2. Choose File  ➪   Export Audio.
3. In the File Name field, name your file.CHAPTER 9 Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It 155
4. In the Folder field, make sure you’re saving your audio in the correct 
location.
If you want to save to a different folder, click Browse and navigate to the folder 
where you want to save your file.
5. In the Format drop-down box, select MP3 Files.
6. In the Audio Options section, set Channels to Stereo.
7. Make sure that Sample Rate is set to 44100 Hz and Bit Rate Mode is 
set to Preset.
These settings, which are the default when you install and launch Audacity, are 
the best for your audio.
The Bit Rate Mode field has four values: Preset, Variable, Average, and 
Constant. Preset, as noted, is the recommended setting. A variable bit rate 
attempts to do a bit of compression — for example, the bit rate of a complex 
music sample would take more space than a spoken piece with several pauses. 
Although variable length audio sounds good, the actual playback time may be 
incorrect, causing a problem when listeners pause a long podcast. Average is 
similar to Variable in that it provides some fluctuations to the bit rate. However 
it’s not quite as “variable” as takes an average across the entire file and, as 
such, may not create files as small as a variable bit rate. A constant bit rate
ensures that the bits are output at a steady (constant) rate despite the type of 
audio (such as music, talking, or silence).
8. Click the Quality drop-down menu and choose a setting, as shown 
in Figure 9-1.
A setting higher than Standard makes a difference only if you’re using higher￾end (professional-grade) headphones for listening.
Saving at the Extreme or Insane setting preserves any faults and hiccups in 
your audio. If you edit and review your audio on pro-level equipment, you’re 
more than okay exporting your podcast’s MP3 at the Standard setting.
9. Set Export Range to Entire Project.
10. Click the Edit Metadata button at the lower left, and fill out your ID3 tags 
(see Figure 9-2).
For more on ID3 tags, see the section on ID3 tags at the end of this chapter.
11. Click the Export button.
After you set the bit rate for this file, it’s one-and-done — your settings are auto￾matically applied to other MP3 files created from this point.156 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
Care for a Sample, Sir? (Audio 
Sample Rates)
When you have a grasp of bit rates, you’re ready to move on to sample rates. This 
may strike you as a tad redundant, particularly when you see the list of common 
audio-sample rates. A strange déjà vu makes you wonder whether you’re in the 
FIGURE 9-1:

your podcast 
to MP3.
FIGURE 9-2:

real world or exist merely as part of The Matrix. No biggie — sometimes technol￾ogy is redundant.
As we discuss in the preceding section, bit rate is a measurement of how much 
audio data is transferred between two points, such as the computer and your 
headset. The sampling rate determines the maximum sound frequency that can be 
reproduced  — the value you set is twice the frequency value. For example, a 
44.1  kHz sample rate can reproduce sounds up to 22.05 kHz, which is slightly 
above the range of human hearing.
Here are a number of audio sampling rates in MP3 encoders:
» 8,000 Hz/8 kHz matches the audio quality of a telephone conversation.
» 22,050 Hz/22 kHz matches an audio quality similar to AM radio.
» 32,000 Hz/32 kHz matches an audio quality similar to FM radio.
» 44,100 Hz/44 kHz matches audio-CD quality.
» 48,000 Hz/48 kHz matches digital TV and film audio, and the maximum sound 
quality on professional-grade audio/video recordings.
As with your audio-recording applications, you have a range of sampling rates 
available — and you can also enter a custom sampling rate.
Using different sample rates in a compressed audio file doesn’t affect the file 
size — only the bit rate and duration affect file size. A high sample rate at a low 
bit rate can result in poor signal representation and thus poor quality, but if you’re 
using at least 64 Kbps (bit rate), there’s no good reason to use anything except 
44,100 Hz as the sample rate.
Be careful when using a sample rate other than a multiple of 11. Choosing a sample 
rate other than 11,025 Hz, 22,500 Hz, or 44,100 Hz can produce an effect similar 
to the voices of Alvin and the Chipmunks. It might be funny at first, but most lis￾teners won’t stick around to hear your entire message.
Changing or customizing the sample rate to your podcast’s needs is simple. Fol￾low these steps to customize sample rates in Audacity:
1. Choose Audacity  ➪   Preferences (Mac) or Edit  ➪   Preferences (Windows).
The Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Audio Setting option, and locate the Quality section on the right, 
as shown in Figure 9-3.158 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
3. In the Project Sample Rate and Default Sample Rate drop-down menus, 
select your desired bit rate.
You can instead enter a custom sampling rate by scrolling to the bottom of the 
list, selecting Other, and entering a number in the field to the right of the Other 
value.
If you’re entering a custom sampling rate, make sure you enter the rate in 
hertz (Hz), not kilohertz (kHz). For example, if you decide your sampling rate is 
44.1 kHz, you have to enter 44100, not 44.
4. Click OK.
Is it soup yet? Not quite yet. The final step is including ID3 tags, the subject of the 
next section.
ID3 Tags: The 411 of Podcasting
ID3 tags matter. They tell other podcasters who you are, tell listeners what your 
podcast is all about, give a quick overview of the current episode, and showcase 
the podcast’s artwork.
Including ID3 tags is the final step before you upload the podcast to your website. 
However, some experienced podcasters from the early days still refuse to tend to 
this detail. While the rebel in us admire their nonconformity, we as long-time 
FIGURE 9-3:

audio sampling 
rate in Audacity, 
make sure you 
match settings to 
avoid playback 
problems.CHAPTER 9 Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It 159
podcasters have something to say to those who defiantly refuse to tend to this 
final detail: Enjoy netcasting, you nimrods.
When you don’t add ID3 tags, your listeners can’t effectively organize the pod￾casts in a computer’s media player and drivers can’t be reminded of what they’re 
listening to on their commute. The bigger platforms, such as Spotify and Apple 
Podcasts, now insist that you complete ID3 tags.
Tell me about yourself: All about ID3 tags
Created in 1996, ID3 tags were added to audio files so that the artist, album, and 
track title could be displayed in a computer’s MP3 player when the file was played 
back. Current ID3 tags now include composer, bit rate, album art, and even genre.
Why would a podcaster want to bother with ID3 tags?
Look at a podcast you’re listening to, whether you’re old-schooling it on a porta￾ble MP3 player or listening through your desktop computer. Your podcast app 
probably organizes your various feeds by the date downloaded. Each individual 
podcast has an episode title, an artist, and a podcast (show) title. If the podcaster 
working with the ID3 tags is particularly savvy, artwork associated with your 
show is also displayed.
Now hop from podcast to podcast, and you can tell which people care — or don’t — 
about identifying their shows. Some podcasts use obscure numbers. But with the 
podcasts that have ID3 tags in place, you can look at your player and get an idea of 
exactly what you’re listening to.
When you add ID3 tags to your podcast, you set individual podcasts apart from one 
another, making each one unique but keeping it grouped with your podcast show.
IDentity crisis: Making ID3 tags 
work for podcasting
Some ID3 tags don’t apply to podcasting. Album? Track number? Composer? 
You’re podcasting, not producing music. However, you can redefine some tags to 
make them relevant to the podcasting medium:
» Artist name: You’re the artist behind this podcast, so let people know who 
you and your group are. Put in your name (or at least the pseudonym you’re 
using as a podcaster) or the name of your podcasting team. For example, 
Philippa Ballantine, August Grappin, and D.J. Steve Boyett.160 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
» Track title: This tag is the name or number of your episode. Examples are 
Show #19, Episode 3: One of Those Faces, BOOK THREE: Chapters 39 & 40.
» Album title: Enter the name of your show, your show’s website, or your 
network if you are part of a podcast network, such as Don’t Turn Around, 
Technorama, or Podrunner.
» Track number: Purely optional, this ID3 tag allows you to make sure your 
podcasts remain in some kind of sequential order. For podcast novelists, 
track numbers coincide with the chapter numbers. If podcasts follow a 
season of multiple episodes, the track number tag coincides with the 
episode in that season.
» Year: Enter the year you produced the podcast episode.
» Genre: Select Podcast, if it’s available.
When using Audacity, if you don’t see the Podcast genre, you can manually 
type Podcast in the field.
» Comments: Similar to comments you leave in XML, you can give a quick two 
or three lines of show notes for your podcasts. This field is a great place to put 
in any Creative Commons notices, websites for more information about the 
show and its hosts, and special dedications.
If you’re using another app for your ID3 tags, you may also be asked to complete 
the following additional tags:
» Album artist: Many times left blank, this tag can be tricky. You can use it 
to refer to the artwork artist, the production studio, or the creator of the 
podcast. Examples are Imagine That! Studios and Time Magazine.
» Composer: You can use this tag to feature the name of your producer, head 
editor, engineer’s name, or the studio where the show is produced. For 
example, The Shared Desk artist is listed as Imagine That! Studios but the 
composers are Tee Morris & Pip Ballantine because the show is co-produced 
and co-hosted.
» Grouping: You can leave this tag blank until you’re affiliated with a network or 
distribution hub. For example, QuickAndDirtyTips.com is where podcasting 
superstar Mignon Fogarty leads a team of podcasters who offer sound advice 
and quick life hacks.CHAPTER 9 Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It 161
» BPM: If you’re into staying fit and are producing a workout podcast, you want 
to fill in this ID3 tag as BPM, for beats per minute. BPM is also good if your 
podcast is a house music–dance mix podcast. For example, a podcast showing 
off BPM is any one mixed by D.J. Steve Boyett (https://pfdbook.link/
podrunner).
On playback, ID3 tags appear on the listeners’ interfaces, offering a quick glance 
at the content of the podcast. Figure 9-4 shows a blast from the past, as it appears 
on the dashboard of Tee’s car.
A peril in working with ID3 tags is spelling errors. Audacity and other tag editors 
do not have a spellchecker. Some editors will create quick-fill databases to help 
you fill in the ID3 info. If you make a typo, the database also includes the 
misspellings going forward. Because many directories, search engines, and play￾ers rely on ID3 tags to organize and properly display your show, make sure to 
double-check the spelling of the show’s title, the names of people involved, and 
any other text you’ve added.

Creating and editing ID3 tags
Audacity lets you set up a template for the ID3 tags applied when MP3 files are 
created. To generate this template, open Audacity, import a file or a project ready 
for ID3 compression, and follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit ➪ Metadata Editor from Audacity’s main menu.
The Edit Metadata Tags (ID3 Tags) window opens (refer to Figure 9-2).
2. Fill in these fields:
• Artist Name: The podcaster or name of the podcasting crew.
• Track Title: The episode name or number or both.
• Album Title: The show’s name or website.
• Track Number: This field is optional, unless numerical order is a priority in 
your podcast.
• Year: The podcast publication’s year.
• Genre: Type Podcast in this field.
• Comments: Type or paste into this field the following, replacing the italic 
text with your details: title of your podcast is produced by producer or 
AUTOMATING WITH AUPHONIC
Post-production is one of the least favorite parts of podcasting. After you stop record￾ing, the temptation is to upload and move on with your life, but instead you need to 
edit, tag, upload, ugh!
One of the best ways to keep your podcasting enthusiasm from fading is to automate 
wherever possible. Enter Auphonic (https://pfdbook.link/auphonic). This online 
service takes your audio or video files and automates the post-production with tem￾plates to reduce the time it takes to do all those tasks, including tagging, adding an intro 
(for example, your show’s starting theme music) and an outro (your show’s ending 
theme music), and adding artwork. It can even upload your final production to your 
server, Dropbox, LibSyn, or Amazon’s S3 server (see Chapter 10). The free service offers 
two hours of processing per month. Depending on your show length and frequency, 
you may find it worthwhile to invest in a paid subscription to save time.
Auphonic supports a mobile app that enables you to literally press record, talk, stop, and 
have it do its thing. You simply write the blog entry to get your RSS feed updated. Chuck 
uses this as his mobile rig quite a bit when he’s on the road doing his slice-of-life podcast.CHAPTER 9 Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It 163
production studio and is protected by a Creative Commons 3.0 license. 
You can find out more about this license at www.creativecommons.org. 
Please visit our website at podcast website for more information.
3. After proofreading your ID3 tags, click the Save button.
The Save button appears in the Template section of the Metadata Tags 
window.
4. In the pop-up window that appears, give your metadata template a name 
and a location on your computer.
Make the name of your template an acronym from your podcast’s full title. For 
example, the ADHD D&D podcast is ADHDDnD and Don’t Turn Around with Phil 
Rossi becomes DTA2024.
5. Click the Save button to create the template.
6. In the Edit Metadata Tags window, click the OK button.
And that’s it! When Audacity generates your MP3, your show is tagged and ready 
for uploading.
Then when it comes time to export your next project, do the following:
1. After you finish editing and saving a new project, choose Edit  ➪   
Metadata from Audacity’s main menu.
2. Go to the Template section of the Metadata Tags window and click 
the Load button.
3. Find and select the XML file with the name of the podcast you’re 
working on.
4. Click the Open button and load a previously saved template.
5. In the Edit Metadata Tags window, update the Track Title field to reflect 
the subject matter of the current episode.
6. Click the OK button to save your tags and complete the export process.
After you tag everything properly, there’s one more piece of identity to apply to 
your spectacular creation — artwork. We cover artwork in Chapter 10, where we 
describe how to move files to your server.
If you use Audacity only to edit and export a single show, consider using the Set 
Default option in the Edit Metadata Tags window. This option makes the current 
tags the default for all files exported going forward, saving you the time it would 
take to load the template file for each episode.CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 165

You’ve figured out what you want to say and said it, you’ve gone through 
the trials and tribulations of editing, and you’ve faithfully employed 
ID3 tagging. That’s great, but no one is going to hear your contribution to 
the podcasting world until you put your files on the web.
In Chapter 1, we cover the process of selecting a hosting provider. In this chapter, 
we look at transferring your files to your hosting provider, including how to 
appropriately name and organize your files.
You have several options for uploading files. Many hosting providers have 
browser-based drag-and-drop file transfer utilities built into their service. 
Although this easy-to-use method might be all you need to get your files onto 
your server, we also dig a little deeper to ensure that you also know about other 
options in case you need to maintain files for multiple shows or multiple hosting 
providers.

Show Art: Getting Graphic 
with Your Podcast
A big piece of successful podcasting is marketing, and a big part of marketing is 
branding. Your podcast logo, or show art, is an important part of your branding. A 
large percentage of listeners use apps where show art is prominently displayed, 
both in directories and in playback modes.
Apple requires show art if you want to register your podcast with its directory. So 
when getting ready to launch your podcast, you need to have a good look for your 
production, like those featured in Figure 10-1.
FIGURE 10-1:
Show art is a 
podcaster’s way 
to brand a show 
and give episodes 
a slick final touch 
when played back 
on various media 
devices.CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 167
Show artwork, commonly seen in many media players, is a nice option for pod￾casters who want to brand a podcast with a logo. Mur Lafferty’s Parsec-winning 
I Should Be Writing logo is a classic broadcast microphone with a sticky note slapped 
on it and a pencil, sharpened and ready for use. Then you have The Onion Radio 
News’s trademark onion with a globe ghosted behind it, the stamp of quality jour￾nalism at its funniest. These icons are associated with their shows, and this kind 
of branding is becoming more and more common in podcasting.
Because the details of uploading and referencing your artwork file vary greatly 
between hosting providers, the following steps are only a guide. Please check your 
hosting provider’s documentation for the exact instructions:
1. Design your show art to the following specifications:
• Format: JPEG (.jpg) or PNG (.png) format
• Color mode: 8-bit channel, RGB mode
• Resolution: 72 dpi
• Size: 1400 × 1400 pixels (minimum) or 3000 × 3000 pixels (maximum)
2. Use a file transfer application or web page to upload your art to 
your web server.
If you’re using a service such as LibSyn, drag and drop the artwork file the 
same way you would upload an episode. If you’re hosting the podcast on your 
own, you can use Cyberduck or FileZilla to upload it on your server. For details 
on uploading files to a server, take a look at the “Uploading your files” section, 
later in the chapter.
3. Use your browser to navigate to your artwork file, and then copy its URL.
Once you’ve copied the show art URL (for example, https://www.yourpodcast.
com/images/artwork.png), write down the URL because you may need it when 
registering your show with various directories. Some hosting providers take care 
of this for you, but others require you to fill it in yourself (as in the next step.)
4. If your hosting provider requires the artwork’s URL, follow the instruc￾tions to paste it.
Many WordPress users install a plug-in (add-on software to extend the 
functionality of the base application) called BluBrry PowerPress to help 
manage podcasts for their blog. Figure 10-2 shows us entering the artwork’s 
URL in PowerPress. Other podcast plug-ins are available with similar 
functionality.
If you do a makeover of your show art, you can upload a new image to replace 
the old one.
5. Save your changes.168 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
Adopting an Effective File-Naming 
Convention
In Chapter 9, we talk about the importance of ID3 tags. Equally important is how 
you name your podcast media files. A good podcast naming convention accom￾plishes the following:
» Easy sequential ordering: Files should not appear at random in your 
directory. They should line up — first, second, third, and so on.
» “At a glance” recognition for you and your listeners: Calling a podcast 
media file my media file doesn’t help much. Calling it Bob’s Fencing Podcast
certainly does.
Here’s an example of a well-named podcast media file, if we do say so ourselves:
Tech_Ep735_20240121.mp3
Although the structure may not be obvious, this filename adheres to both rules 
and even adds one:
» Tech: This abbreviation stands for Technorama. Starting the filename with 
these four letters organizes the files together in the media folder. Listeners 
FIGURE 10-2:
With the 
PowerPress 
podcast plug-in 
from BluBrry, you

your show’s 
artwork in the 
Podcast Artwork 
section.CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 169
who can see only the filename on their MP3 player or computer can quickly 
recognize that files starting with these four letters belong to a particular show. 
Pretty much everyone listens to podcasts through some podcatching applica￾tion, but don’t discount the small segment of people who like to download 
files to their hard drive.
» Ep735: This file is Episode 735 of the show. Referring to each show with a 
sequential number is a good idea, giving you and your fans a common 
reference point that is easier than “Remember when you did that show with 
that one guy who said that funny thing? Man that was great!” Having the 
episode number right after the name also ensures that the files stack up 
correctly in the media folder, as well as in your listeners’ MP3 players. You may 
want to consider adding some leading zeroes so episode 8 (008) comes before 
735. Add more leading zeroes if you plan on doing more than 999 shows.
» 20240121: This is the date the file was posted, in year-month-day order. By 
using 01 instead of 1, dates from October (10), November (11), and December 
(12) don’t intermingle with January (1). True, in this case the files were already 
sorted by episode number, but you may choose to go with the date first.
Finally, an underscore (_) provides a clear distinction of each part of the filename.
Don’t use spaces or special characters in your filenames. Stick with A–Z, 0–9, 
hyphen, and underscore. Slashes (/, \), hash mark (#), ampersand (&), and other 
characters can cause problems when creating RSS 2.0 files or when FTP applica￾tions are handling the file. To separate elements, use an underscore or a hyphen 
(for example, use PFD_S05E01.mp3 or PFD-S05E01.mp3 instead of PFD Season 5 
Episode 1.mp3).
The following examples are from well-respected podcasters who all follow these 
guidelines:
» NMS-2017-04-01.mp3
» scienceontriplej20181006.mp3
» AC_EPISODE_021.mp3
» TSD-075.mp3
Note how each of them identifies the name or abbreviation of the podcast and 
provides a sequential way of ordering the files. If you leave out the episode num￾ber, as in the case of the Science on Triple J file, the year of the podcast before the 
month and day also ensures that all the files for a particular year are grouped 170 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
together. If the podcaster had used the month first, as people traditionally think 
of dates in the United States, files would be mixed based on the month they were 
released, regardless of the year.
If thinking about the date that way seems too strange for you, do what Chuck 
does — stick a sequential episode number in front of your date, and don’t worry 
about it.
Making Your Connection with 
an FTP Application
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the method by which you can transfer files from 
one destination to another over the internet. You likely transfer files every day, 
such as images from your phone to your photo library, or an email message to 
your desktop, or a media file from a podcast server to your podcast app.
Transferring your podcast files to and from the internet isn’t much different, at 
least on the surface and even at any depth necessary for podcasters to ply their 
trade. Lucky for you, specialty software makes the process as simple as dragging 
and dropping.
Some podcast hosting services, such as Liberated Syndication, or LibSyn (https://
pfdbook.link/libsyn), mentioned earlier in the chapter, make this simple 
process even simpler by providing a web form that handles podcast file uploads, 
as described in the last section in the chapter, “Uploading to a Podcast￾Specific Host.”
However, many experienced podcasters need more flexibility than the limited 
functionality a browser-based upload process allows. Regardless of what soft￾ware, forms, or other assistance you use to move files around, the concept of FTP 
is the same. FTP has been around for quite a while now, along with its archaic 
terms, such as the following two computer systems involved:
» Local host: The local host is the computer you are sitting in front of and 
initiating the file transfer from. If you’re using a laptop to connect to your 
web server, your laptop is the local host. If you’re at work and logged in from 
a workstation, your office computer is the local host. The local directory, or 
local path, is the folder on your local host that contains the files you want to 
transfer. You can change local directories at will, but most FTP programs 
have a default starting place.CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 171
» Remote host: The remote host is the computer or web server to which you’re 
connected. It’s likely the spot where you’re trying to get your MP3 files to go to 
allow others to download them. Not surprisingly, the remote host has its own 
remote directory (the folder on the remote system where you drop your files). 
Again, you can change or navigate through remote directories just as you can 
change file folders on your computer.
You need three pieces of information to initiate an FTP connection:
» IP address or hostname of your remote host
» Login name
» Password
Your hosting company should have provided this information to you. If you don’t 
have it handy, you need to find it because you’re not going any further without it.
All FTP programs do the same job but have slightly different methods of going 
about it. After you grasp the concept, using just about any FTP application is a 
simple process. Here are the general steps to follow to set up a connection in any 
FTP application (specific instructions for two popular FTP applications are avail￾able in the following sections):
1. Launch your FTP application and create a connection.
Because this step is what FTP applications are designed to do, they usually 
make this process simple.
2. Enter the IP address or hostname of your web server, your username, 
and your password.
This step identifies the remote system and shows you have access to the files 
and folders it contains.
3. Connect using either a button or a menu option.
The connection is established in a matter of seconds.
The following sections show you how to use Cyberduck (https://pfdbook.link/
cyberduck) and FileZilla (https://pfdbook.link/filezilla) to transfer your 
file from your computer to your hosting server. Both apps are free and available 
for Windows and Mac. You can find many FTP programs as freeware, shareware, 
and shrink-wrapped software, for every brand of up-to-date operating system. 
We chose these two for their ease of use and streamlined approach, but you can 
use the FTP program of your choice.172 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
Step-by-step (or quack-by-quack) 
setup for Cyberduck
Download the Cyberduck program from https://pfdbook.link/cyberduck to 
your computer and follow the installation instructions. After installation, follow 
these steps (for both Windows and Mac) to set up an FTP connection:
1. Click the Open Connection button on the top toolbar.
The Connect dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-3.
2. In the Server text box, enter the name of your server.
Depending on the requirements of your ISP, this name can be in the format of 
ftp.mydomainname.com or perhaps simply my_domain_name.com, replacing 
the italic text with the name or IP address of your web server.
3. In the Username and Password boxes, enter your username and pass￾word, respectively.
The hosting company should have provided this information.
If you’re using a Mac and want to store your username and password for the 
next time you connect, select the Add to Keychain option.
4. Click the Connect button.
If you entered things properly, you see the file folders on your remote web 
server. If you didn’t, you get an error message or a login failed dialog box. 
Check your server, username, and password, and then try it again.
FIGURE 10-3:
A properly 
configured 
Cyberduck FTP 
connection.CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 173
When your connection is established, choose Bookmarks ➪ New Bookmark. Give 
your newly created connection a catchy name and simply double-click the given 
name the next time you need to reconnect quickly.
Step-by-step setup for FileZilla
FileZilla (https://pfdbook.link/filezilla) operates much the same as 
Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, allowing you to drag and drop files between 
your PC and your FTP server. When you’ve downloaded the FileZilla program, 
follow these steps:
1. On the Login toolbar (shown in Figure 10-4), enter your host name, 
username, and password.
Leave the port blank. (It defaults to 21.)
2. Click the Quickconnect button on the toolbar.
3. When FileZilla presents a prompt asking if you want to save your pass￾word, select the option that you feel most comfortable with.
If you entered something wrong, you get an error message in red text in the 
upper window. Correct your mistakes and try it again.
FIGURE 10-4:
A properly 
configured 
FileZilla 
connection.174 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
If you entered everything correctly, a lot of text scrolls by in the uppermost 
window and content from your web server appears in the right window, labeled 
Remote Site. Congratulations; you’re now connected to your web server.
From here, you can navigate through the folders on your web server much as you 
do on your computer’s hard drive. You can move up or down the file system, find￾ing the spot where you want to drop your podcast files.
Did you notice the Port field in Figure 10-4? A network port is similar to a television 
channel. On the internet, applications may use a specific port; for example, your 
browser typically uses port 80 (unsecure) or port 443 (secure). On the other end, 
severs are listening to these ports for instructions so they can send the appropri￾ate response. By default, FileZilla uses port 21, which is an unencrypted (not 
secured) port. Depending on how your network is configured, you may get an 
error when you try to connect. A common quick fix is to go to the Port field in 
FileZilla and enter port 22, which is secure. You may also see port 22 in reference 
to FTPS (file transfer protocol secure).
A place on your web server for your stuff
Logging in to your web server for the first time can be an intimidating process. In 
this section, we show you how and where to place your podcast files so you can 
easily create links to them.
Don’t be intimidated by the odd directory names on your web server. The only one 
you really need to know is Public_html. Other hosts may call the directory www 
or simply html. If you don’t have one of those three, poke around until you find 
one that has a bunch of files that end in .html.
Look, but don’t touch. Going into folders doesn’t hurt anything, but doing silly 
things such as deleting, renaming, and moving files you know nothing about is a 
bad idea. All those strangely named folders do something, and they’re likely nec￾essary to make your website work correctly. Remember the proverb “’Tis best to 
leave functioning web servers lie.”
You may see lots of different files and a few folders. We show you how to add even 
more files to this system, so now is a good time to think about organizing and 
housekeeping.
Start by creating a special place to keep your podcast files. Making a new folder 
exclusively for your podcast media files not only separates your podcasts from 
your other critical web server files but also allows you to easily maintain the files 
in the future, including making backups and cleaning up obsolete files.CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 175
In your root directory (the top-level folder usually denoted with a forward 
slash, /), create a new folder called media. With Cyberduck, choose File ➪ New 
Folder, and enter the name in the resulting dialog box. On FileZilla, right-click the 
window with the details (date, size, permissions) on the remote file server and 
choose Create Directory.
After you create the new media folder, double-click the name of the folder to open 
it. You’re now inside your totally empty media folder and are ready to load it with 
your podcast media files.
Uploading your files
After you set up a folder for your podcast media files and decide on a file-naming 
convention, you’re ready to move your freshly named files to the web server. Both 
Cyberduck and FileZilla support drag-and-drop file transfers. If you’re new to FTP, 
the FTP program interface may be easier for you to use.
For Cyberduck, follow these steps:
1. Choose File  ➪   Upload.
2. Browse your system to find and select the podcast media files or folders 
you want to upload.
3. Click the Upload button.
UNMETERED AND UNLIMITED EXPLAINED
Okay, time for a few more terms you’ll want to be familiar with when dealing with your 
files and your hosting provider:
• Unmetered bandwidth refers to the policies of certain hosting companies that 
don’t base their monthly charges on the number of files transferred (podcasts 
downloaded) each month, such as LibSyn.
• Unlimited server space means you can host as many podcast media files as you 
want on the web server for the same flat fee. We don’t know of any hosting com￾pany offering unlimited server space currently, but you can get close. Many hosts 
offer gigabytes for a cheap price — sometimes even hundreds of gigabytes — 
which is effectively unlimited.176 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
For FileZilla, here’s what you do:
1. Navigate to the desired folder using the Local Site window on the left.
2. Select one or more files or folders or both from the window directly 
below the Local Site window.
3. Drag the selected files to the Remote Site window on the right.
Depending on the size of your file and the speed of your internet connection, the 
file transfer will take a few seconds or minutes. When the transfer is complete, the 
file appears in your FTP application and is ready to be linked in your show notes 
and RSS 2.0 feed.
Uploading to a Podcast-Specific Host
Podcast-specific hosting companies significantly simplify the uploading process. 
Many include web-based forms that take the place of additional computer pro￾grams to handle the uploading process. They also take care of archiving, RSS 2.0 
creation, and even ID3 tagging.
USING YOUR BLOGGING SOFTWARE TO 
UPLOAD
Many popular blogging tools allow podcasters to upload files without the need for spe￾cial FTP software. However, podcast media files often exceed the file size requirements 
for these services. For this reason, we recommend not using conventional blogging soft￾ware to handle your podcast media file uploads.
Consider that blogs are primarily used to communicate text. Although you can easily 
extend the functionality of a blog to support a podcast, the site management tools are 
designed for text and images. WordPress (https://pfdbook.link/wordpress) does 
allow file uploads, but the file size depends on system parameters that are often set by 
the web host and can’t be changed by the individual. You can upload, but it takes a sig￾nificant amount of work that exceeds the scope of this book.
Instead, we recommend using blogging software to manage the posting of your content 
after your file is uploaded to the server. In WordPress, you can do this easily by using 
the PowerPress plug-in (https://pfdbook.link/powerpress).CHAPTER 10 Move It on Up (to Your Web Server) 177
Although this web-based uploading process is simple, we prefer the flexibility of 
using an FTP application — or better yet a command-line interface. Okay, we’re 
old school.
For the purposes of illustration, we use an account with LibSyn in this section. 
Sign up with LibSyn (https://pfdbook.link/libsyn) and create your own 
account (if you haven’t already).
LibSyn offers up to a free month with the promo code podcast411, so you can get a 
feel for how it works before you fork over your hard-earned cash. Not that the 
inexpensive monthly fees will break you, but it’s nice to know how your future 
home might work.
Then follow these steps:
1. On LibSyn’s home page, click Login in the upper right. On the next screen, 
enter your email and password and click the Login button.
2. Click the New button in the upper right and select Episode.
The New Episode page appears, as shown in Figure 10-5.
3. Drag and drop a file to the Add Media File block.
You can instead click Add Media File, browse for and select your file, and then 
click Open.
FIGURE 10-5:

account doesn’t

application.178 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
The system takes a few minutes to upload and process your file. When it’s 
finished, a player appears.
4. Do one of the following:
• If you’ve used proper ID3 tags on your podcast and want to import them: Click 
the Populate Form with ID3 Tags button to save some time. The descrip￾tion may need some additional formatting because the importer doesn’t 
recognize paragraph breaks. Also check your title and description for 
encoded characters. You may need to do touch-ups, such as replace &amp;
with the & character.
• If you don’t want to import the ID3 tags or didn’t use them in your podcast:
Enter the episode details in the form, including the title, description, 
author, and what category you want it placed in. Only the title is required 
(and you can always come back and change it later).
5. If you want to schedule your podcast for later, do the following:
a. Click the Availability drop-down list at the bottom left and select 
Schedule Episode.
b. In the Start Date field, enter the start date.
c. (Optional) In the End Date field, enter an end date. This field is usually left empty.
d. In the Media Availability field, select an option. The most common setting is 
Always Available.
6. Click Publish.CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 179
Chapter 11
Providing Show Notes
Show notes are brief summaries of each podcast episode. Show notes can take 
the form of an outline, a detailed bulleted list, or just a few sentences of text. 
In this chapter, we show you how to effectively use show notes to enhance 
your listeners’ experience and bring additional traffic to your podcast through 
search engines.
And where do listeners find these show notes? Simply enough, on the podcast’s 
website.
Additional traffic means additional bandwidth consumption, which can cause 
issues. Flip to Chapter 10 for tips on reducing the load on your server and for info 
about optional hosting plans that don’t charge for additional bandwidth.
Show Note Etiquette
Several schools of thought exist on how to approach show notes. Some podcasters 
say you should be brief, using notes only to hold URLs and other pieces of impor￾tant offline data that your listeners may not have had time to write down as the 
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Understanding good show note 
etiquette
» Using images effectively
» Posting with WordPress and LibSyn
» Posting with searchers in mind180 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
show was playing. Others suggest that show notes should be filled with informa￾tion on each and every concept touched upon in the show. Whether you prefer a 
more moderate approach or a deeper dive, your personal tastes and style go a long 
way in determining what is right for you.
Setting aside the level of detail you want to explain, you need to follow some basic 
rules of etiquette:
» Use intriguing and informative titles. In general, and to keep things simple, 
the title of your show notes should match your episode title. Your title is your 
pitch; you’re a huckster competing for the attention of listeners. Some 
listeners may know all about you; others could be seeing something from you 
for the first time. Include keywords in your title that accurately and specifically 
represent the contents of the episode. Your keywords should also generate 
some excitement and make the episode sound interesting and intriguing to 
potential listeners.
There’s a fine line between “intriguing and informative” and “clickbait” when it 
comes to titles and headlines. Avoid headlines that could come across as 
accusatory, toxic, or sensational.
» Include links to resources mentioned in the podcast. If you’re talking 
about a trip to the local museum, provide a link to the museum’s main site in 
your show notes. If you mention another podcast, link to it. If you mention a 
news story or an opinion piece, drop that URL in your show notes. Don’t forget 
about music credits and affiliate or sponsor links too! Good linking brings 
good karma, and it may provide some interesting “Hey, you linked to me!” 
comments and potentially helpful links from others.
» Think about being concise versus being complete. Show notes can be as 
simple as a bullet list of topics or as detailed as a word-for-word transcript of 
your show. It’s up to you. If you’re already scripting your podcast, it’s no extra 
trouble to post the script, but be aware of the length. A transcript for a 
3-minute show is easy for someone to read on their browser, but a reader 
might not want to go through a 45-minute transcript.
In Figure 11-1 Kreg composes his show notes for Technorama (https://pfdbook.
link/technorama). Each episode includes links, embedded videos, and bullet 
points about the topics covered. Is it a lot of work? It can be, but the result is a 
guide that listeners can follow easily.CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 181
Planning the Post
The amount of time you spend planning your show notes is inversely proportional 
to the amount of time you spend doing your show prep (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7). 
If you forgot everything from your high school math class, allow us to paraphrase: 
The more you prepare for your show, the less time you’ll spend working on the 
show notes — and vice versa.
Examine the notes you used when you recorded your podcast. Did you talk about 
any websites? Find the URLs and make sure you spelled them right by testing 
them. We recommend the copy-and-paste technique for URLs rather than relying 
on your typing skills, especially for lengthy URLs.
FIGURE 11-1:
Technorama show 
notes implement 
a range from 
simple links to 
embedded videos 
related to the 
conversations.182 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
If you recorded or edited your show hours or days before you started this notation 
process, replay the media file with pen and paper at the ready. Listen for need-to￾know moments and jot them down as the show plays. After it finishes, use a 
search engine to find additional, relevant URLs to provide to your listeners.
It’s all in the details
Now is a good time to figure out what level of detail you want to employ in your 
show notes. Several factors can influence your decision, and audience expectation 
and personal choice are among the more important.
Here’s a good rule: The deeper you dive into a single topic on your podcast, the 
less detailed your notes need to be. That may sound counterintuitive, and please 
keep in mind this is only a general rule. For example, if your podcast episode fea￾tures a 20-minute interview with theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku on his 
book Physics of the Impossible and how applicable those ideas are to the Star Wars
Universe, you likely won’t have much more than links to buy the book and rent the 
movie.
Show note details serve a couple purposes:
» Act as a table of contents for the episode
» Allow listeners to skip ahead if they so choose
As the podcaster, you can decide how much or how little you embrace these pur￾poses. Here are some approaches that other podcasters have adopted:
» Add a time stamp on segment or topic changes. Some podcasters include 
a time stamp whenever they change topics, which can be frequently depend￾ing on the show’s format and its host. Time stamps help your listeners find a 
particular topic when your podcast covers a range of them. Many podcast 
apps recognize the time stamps in the text and turn them into clickable links, 
enabling the listener to jump to a specific point in your episode. Consider 
adding them to your podcast description and ID3 tags. Keep in mind, though, 
that time stamps take a few extra minutes to create. Yes, it’s a terrific touch, 
but it’s a commitment.
» Write in complete sentences and paragraphs. Taking cues from the world 
of blogging, many podcasters, such as Michael J. Rigg in The Steamrollers 
Adventure Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/tsap), write show notes in prose, 
using complete sentences and paragraphs in place of bullet points and time 
stamps. This approach gives potential readers a flavor of the show without 
having to listen but can make key elements difficult to find. The prose CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 183
approach works best for fiction-driven and role-playing game (RPG) podcasts 
or for short, quick podcasts designed for business.
» Create a simple one-line summary. Some podcasts, such as The TED Radio 
Hour (https://pfdbook.link/tedradiohour), take a minimalist approach 
and post simple one-liners or a few sentences that quickly sum up what the 
show will cover. We suggest that new podcasters not follow this lead because 
it doesn’t do much for helping attract new listeners. Many shows that take a 
quick summary approach enjoy a wider distribution method — for example, 
The TED Radio Hour is part of the NPR network and the TED brand carries a lot 
of weight.
Detailed show notes improve your search engine rankings and enable curious 
Google visitors to determine the value of an episode before listening. Show down￾loads and subscriptions can spike whenever your episode touches on hot topics 
because these keywords appear in show notes as well as blogpost tags. This spike 
in subscriptions demonstrates how powerful show notes can be.
A picture is worth a thousand words
You can also include a representative image or two in your show notes (refer to 
Figure 11-1). While random graphics serve only to increase your bandwidth con￾sumption and risk cluttering your page, well-selected images can add flavor and 
dimension to your show notes.
Before you add an image to your post, keep in mind these three considerations:
» Is the image protected by copyright? Simply grabbing an image off the 
internet can land even the most well-meaning podcaster in a heap of legal 
trouble. Here are a few options to help avoid copyright issues:
• Use your own images. No issues here because you own the images and can 
use them any way you like.
• Use Google Images (https://pfdbook.link/googleimages). When you 
search, choose Tools  ➪   Usage Rights and select Creative Commons 
license. Companies and personalities make these images available for 
public use.
• Identify the owner and ask for permission. Most people are eager to get their 
images displayed and are happy to say yes, provided they get credit.
» Can you link directly to the image, or do you need to copy it to your 
server? Some sites, such as Amazon.com, allow you to link directly to images 
from the source website. These sites have a huge technology infrastructure 
and can handle remote hosting images that appear on other sites. But many 184 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
smaller and personal sites can’t handle the load a popular podcast can put on 
their system if they allowed direct linking to their stored images. In these 
cases, copy the image to your own server before adding it to your page. If 
you’re going to do this, it’s good karma to provide an “image courtesy of” link 
to the original site. Again, this assumes you’ve received the appropriate 
permissions to copy the file. When in doubt, don’t.
Stay on topic. If you record a podcast about audio gear, for example, and use 
images of the latest Beats headphones, that’s fine because the images are 
directly related to your show. However, if you’re using images of Dr. Dre to 
promote your baseball podcast (dropping speech bubbles on Dre saying, 
“When I’m not creating my next hit record, I’m waiting for the next Full Count
podcast!”), you’ve crossed a line.
» Does the image fit on your page? Images too small or too large aren’t doing 
your listeners any favors. Make sure the image you select is the right size. You 
can add width=”x” height=”x” declarations to your image tags to control 
the size or use your blog engine’s editing presets to resize the image (better to 
go larger-to-smaller than the opposite direction), but keep in mind that this 
might distort the image. Previewing your post with resized images is a must.
Posting Your Show Notes
If you’ve planned and prepared, posting your show notes is easy. And if you’ve 
decided on the quick-and-dirty approach or don’t care to use show notes, this 
process can go quickly as well because there’s nothing to do, right?
In this section, we show you how to enter your show notes using WordPress and 
LibSyn. If you use another tool to make your posts, or if you create your notes by 
hand, you still get value out of these examples because we include things you 
should consider along the way.
Posting in WordPress
WordPress (https://pfdbook.link/wordpress) is free, easy-to-use blogging 
software that also works well for podcasters. Many hosting providers have a 
single-click installation, or you can choose to download the software and install it 
yourself (check out WordPress For Dummies, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson).
Before creating your show notes, you need to install a plug-in, such as Blubrry’s 
PowerPress interface (see Figure 11-2).CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 185
Follow these steps to post show notes for a self-hosted WordPress site. Just be 
aware that these steps may vary slightly if you are posting on WordPress.com:
1. Log in to your website’s site administration page.
You can typically find a login link on any WordPress page. If you’ve already 
provided credentials, the link may say Site Admin. In most instances, the URL 
looks something like the following
https://www.your_domain_here.com/wp-admin
2. Choose Posts  ➪   Add New Post from the menu along the left of your 
browser window, as shown in Figure 11-3, to start a new posting.
You can also choose +New ➪  Post from the menu across the top of your 
browser window. The Add New Post page appears, where you will fill in the 
details of your new posting. Although this screen displays a lot of items, you 
don’t need to use them all to get started.

3. In the Title text block, enter the title of your podcast episode.
WordPress uses blocks to manage your blogposts. The blocks offer a variety of 
options for you:
• Title
• Paragraph (Text)
• List
• YouTube
• Image
When you launch WordPress, every post begins with a title block and a text 
block. You build your post from here.
4. In the text block offered, enter your show notes, adding URLs to any 
websites you mention.
Follow a chronological order and list the various topics covered in your show, 
one on each line.
To create a link, highlight the text you want to link and then click the link icon 
(chain) in the text block’s interface, shown in Figure 11-4. Copy and paste the 
full URL — including the https:// part — and then press Enter or Return.
FIGURE 11-4:

in the Text block’s 
menu and paste 
the URL in the 
field provided.CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 187
5. Connect your podcast file to the blog.
Your media file should be on your server (covered in Chapter 10), so paste the URL 
to your file here, and then click the Verify button to ensure that you got it right.
What if you want to feature a podcast you were on? What is the best way to 
share that experience with your audience? Well, this is when you syndicate an 
episode. The episode appears in your feed, but the statistics go back to the 
original podcast creator. Podcast plug-ins like Blubrry’s PowerPress make 
syndication easy. Instead of hosting the media on your server, it resides on a 
remote server. Go to your plug-in and use the entire URL of the podcast where 
you’re featured, such as
https://theotherpodcast.com/episodes/path_to_your
interview.mp3
6. In the Categories section, select the appropriate category for your 
podcast.
The category feature keeps your various posts organized. It’s not uncommon 
to have one category for text and blog entries and another for podcasts. For 
example, you can have a Podcast Episodes category and a Latest News 
category for blog entries unrelated to your podcast.
7. When you’ve finished entering your show notes, click Save Draft.
You don’t want to take any chances of losing your masterpiece.
8. Proof your post:
a. Make sure the links work properly, including the link to your podcast file.
b. See how your post will appear by clicking the Preview button in the Publish pane 
on the right. A new browser tab appears displaying your post in 
preview mode.
c. Test thoroughly before releasing a new episode.
9. Return to the post editor by closing the preview browser tab, and then 
make any necessary adjustments to your show notes.
Repeat Steps 8 and 9 until you’re satisfied.
10. If you want to schedule the publication of your show notes, do the 
following:
a. In the Publish pane on the right, click Edit next to the Publish Immediately field.
b. Use the time and date fields to determine when your post goes live.
c. Click OK to save your results.
WordPress displays the date and time your post is scheduled to be released.188 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
11. When you’re satisfied with your show notes, click Publish (or Schedule if 
you scheduled publication for later).
12. To preview your post, click the Permalink URL just below the title.
Visiting your web page is a good idea to make sure everything looks as you 
expected it to. If it doesn’t, simply edit the post and save your changes.
Many podcasters with detailed show notes use the <!--more--> tag in their Word￾Press postings, as shown in Figure 11-5. Any text above the more link is displayed 
on the main page. Those who want to view the detailed content can click the link. 
If you have lots of show notes in your post, you can keep your front page tidy with 
a few bullet items for each episode, using a more tag to hide the longer list.
Posting on LibSyn
Because LibSyn (https://pfdbook.link/libsyn) is a dedicated podcast hosting 
provider, the steps for posting show notes are intuitive but a bit different than 
those in blogging software.
Follow these steps to post your show notes on LibSyn:
1. Log in to your LibSyn account.
2. Click the New button in the upper right and choose Episode.
FIGURE 11-5:
When creating 
show notes in 
WordPress, 
incorporating a 
more tag can 
help create a tidy 
main page.CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 189
LibSyn also allows text-only posts, which is great when you want to simply say, 
“I’m on vacation for the next two weeks.”
3. Click the green box labeled Add Media File Link.
A window appears so you can browse your local hard drive.
4. Locate and select your episode file and then click Choose.
Alternatively, you can drag and drop a file from your computer to the same 
green box.
5. In the Episode Details section, enter a title for the episode.
Simply enter a basic description of what this episode is about, such as Classic 
Car Auction.
6. In the Description box, enter the detailed show notes.
Follow a chronological order and list the various topics covered on your show, 
one on each line. Be sure to add URLs to any websites you mention.
To insert a URL in your show notes, click the link icon. In the pop-up window that 
appears, enter the URL and the text to display for the link. Optionally, in the Title 
file, enter text that will appear when the reader hovers a cursor over the link. 
Finally, click Save. Congratulations! You’ve made a link to another page on the web!
In the Open Link In field, select New Window. When the reader clicks your link, 
the new page will open in a new browser tab rather than navigating away from 
your page. Now the reader can return to your show notes by switching 
browser tabs rather than by using the back icon or browser history.
7. In the Optional Details section, fill in the information for Apple Podcasts 
Optimization.
The key items to fill in are the Episode Type (usually Full), Episode Number, 
Apple Podcasts Title, Explicit, and Author.
8. In the Category drop-down list, choose a category for your podcast.
Categories on LibSyn work like they do in most blogging applications. To keep 
this simple, choose General. However, you can also create a new category. 
LibSyn tools, such as its web page, media player, and smartphone apps, use 
the category to help you organize your episodes.
9. If you don’t want to use the default artwork for your podcast, go to the 
Artwork section and upload the custom episode-level artwork (if you 
have any).
Periodically save your work by clicking Save as Draft. If you want to get a 
preview of your episode, click the View button in the top right. Figure 11-6 
shows how your post looks on LibSyn before it’s posted.190 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
10. In the Publish section (at the bottom of the form), use the Availability 
field to determine if the post will be available immediately or if you want 
to schedule it for a later date.
If you make your episode available later, fill in the date and time fields that 
appear.
11. Click Publish.
That’s it! You’ve made your first post with show notes. If there are any errors, a 
message will be displayed and the fields where you need to make corrections 
will be highlighted.
As part of the running dialog in your show, mention that you have show notes. For 
example, in the middle of recording, say “We found a great deal on those at 
Frobozco. We’ll have a link in the show notes on our website.” Or at the end of the 
show, mention the show notes with contact information, as in “Don’t forget to 
stop by our website at www. . ., where you’ll find links to everything we men￾tioned in the show notes, information on how to contact us, and much more.”
Boosting Search Engine Rankings
One tangible benefit of quality show notes is the effect they can have on your list￾ings in search engines. Traditional search engines can’t scan and index the con￾tents of your podcast media files (yet). As such, you need to provide text for search 
engines to examine and evaluate for index inclusion.
FIGURE 11-6:

Podcasters can pick up a lot of tips and tricks from bloggers and other website 
owners on how to boost search engine rankings, including changing the position 
of elements, using headings, meta tags, and image tags correctly, and back￾linking. That conversation is far beyond the scope of this book, so grab a copy of 
SEO For Dummies, 7th Edition by Peter Kent if you want to make a bigger splash.
In this section, we show you some best practices you can implement right away to 
make your notes (and podcast) more accessible to search engines  — and 
ultimately search engine users.
Loading up your titles
Search engines (and searchers) pay close attention to titles. You should consider 
the title of your individual podcast episodes every bit as important as the title of a 
given web page.
Some podcasters struggle to write effective titles. The biggest problem comes 
from confusing titles with descriptions. If your title starts with “In this episode,” 
stop right there. You’re writing the description, not the title. A title is a string of 
well-chosen and crafted words that has no room for baggage.
The best titles come from a re-examination of your show notes. If you haven’t 
made your notes yet, you may find coming up with a solid title tough. Here’s the 
process we suggest:
1. Read your show notes and create a bullet list of the key elements, 
thoughts, or themes covered in the show.
Let’s say you have a podcast on a classic car auction. In your show notes, you 
covered the following:
• Sleeping in the Seattle airport while the flight was delayed
• An interesting discussion during the flight with an 80-year-old man who is a 
car restorer
• Delving under the hood of the 1965 Ford Mustang
• Custom headers and exhaust systems
• A short interview with the owner of a 1972 Chevy Nova
• Taking a 1957 Chevy Belair for a cruise
• Listener feedback request: What’s your favorite classic car?192 PART 3 You’ve Recorded Your Voice: Now What?
2. Boil down each element to a single word or phrase, if possible.
Think about the people who might be interested in the contents of your show 
and pick common words they’re likely to search for. Following are potential 
episode titles from your bullet list:
• Sleepless in the Seattle Airport
• The Old Man and the Chevy
• Two Decades of Driving
• Making a Classic Your Own
These all make solid titles, giving searchers a good tease about what they can 
expect. What kind of title do you want for your episode? One with humor? 
Alliteration? Something more literal? Whether your audience is casual or, in the 
case of our classic car auction podcast, serious collectors and restorers, select 
the key points from your show notes and condense them.
Note how the title doesn’t cover everything. That’s the job of the description, 
where you can go into greater detail about those elements plus the many other 
things you talk about on the show.
Titles also carry keywords likely to be of interest to your audience. Think about 
how people will search and write your titles for that. Keep titles short, don’t try to 
cover everything, and employ more detailed descriptions to carry the rest of your 
story.
Soliciting backlinks
Backlinks are the Holy Grail of search engine optimization. A backlink is simply a 
link from someone else’s website to yours as opposed to a link from your site to 
another. In this case, you’re looking for outside locations to link back to your own 
site. Sites that have a lot of backlinks pointing to them are considered more 
important to the computers that control where your site shows up on a search 
engine. To get backlinks from others, you have to create links to their websites in 
your show notes.
Before you post your show, contact other podcasters, bloggers, and perhaps nota￾ble websites to see whether they’re interested in linking to you (and you to them) 
to generate interest in your podcast, rather than to a specific show. Many sites 
have a section for related sites, which can be an effective tool for drawing people 
to your site and your podcast. You can also find people who might want to backlink 
to particular episodes.CHAPTER 11 Providing Show Notes 193
When you’re soliciting backlinks from sources, make each email personal, provide 
the exact link you want them to use, and tell them why you think it’s important 
for them to link it.
You’ve posted your show and put your show notes online. It’s time to start solicit￾ing backlinks to individual episodes:
» Company backlinks: Write to the company that manufactures the products 
you covered to explain that you’re posting a review. Getting big companies to 
link to you can help your rankings.
» Courtesy backlinks: If someone helped you with part of your podcast and 
you mention it in your episode, let that source know. For example, send an 
email to the agency that booked your trip.
» Backlinks from fellow podcasters: If other podcasters cover topics related 
to your episode, let them know about it because they might be willing to spare 
you a backlink. It takes only a few moments of your time and is information 
they may welcome.
A fine line exists between asking for backlinks and spamming. If you can’t think 
of a good reason why a site should link to you, don’t ask for a link. Otherwise, just 
mention what your show is and what you’ve covered that might be of interest and 
let them decide whether they want to provide a backlink.4

Chapter 12
Speaking Directly 
to Your Peeps
Communication can be defined in a multitude of overly complex ways. For 
the sake of argument (and not to copy each and every dictionary entry we 
can find), we define the term this way:
The exchange of information between two points.
Note that last part — between two points. To us, this implies a bidirectional flow 
of information, to and from both parties.
If you’ve had the pleasure of attending any productivity or team-building semi￾nars (note how well we can say that with a straight face), the presenters drive the 
message home: Effective communication is not a one-way street.
Over the past few years, podcasting has evolved into a more effective communica￾tion method than traditional media (such as radio or television). We all have com￾munication tools at our disposal — email, websites, phone lines — so why do 
podcast listeners seem to get more involved with podcasting? Two simple reasons:
» There seems to be a closer bond between podcast consumer and podcast 
producer. The simple fact that anyone can do this makes the producer seem 
more like a real person than a personality and, therefore, easier to relate to.
IN THIS CHAPTER

» Starting a discussion group online
» Finding conversations on the web
» Handling listener feedback, good 
and bad198 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
» The podcasters are asking for feedback — and getting it. Audience size doesn’t 
matter. We’ve seen some instances of shows with a couple hundred loyal 
followers where the podcaster has to spin off a second show just to handle 
the listeners’ feedback.
In this chapter, we show you some real-world examples of how to foster com￾munication between you and your audience, touching on a variety of methods and 
venues.
Gathering Listener Feedback
It must be a natural human reaction to fear the opinions of others. Perhaps it’s 
insecurity, but we think it has more to do with our culture’s constant reinforce￾ment of the “How are you?” — “I’m fine. You?” — “Fine.” meaningless chatter 
that precedes most of our conversations.
That cultural crutch, however, is left next to Tiny Tim’s seat when it comes to 
podcasting. Listeners, for whatever reason, are compelled to give real and mean￾ingful criticism. And podcasters, for the most part, take to heart those responses.
Of course, we’re speaking in general terms. Yes, flamers and trolls are out there 
with less than helpful opinions at the ready. Podcasting can’t change basic human 
nature for the ill-evolved, unfortunately.
You can foster good communication with your listening audience in a multitude of 
ways, such as
» Allowing and responding to comments on your blog
» Creating and visiting online discussion groups and forums
» Responding to listener email
» Participating in online social networks
» Leveraging voicemail (see Figure 12-1)
So let’s get cracking on how we make these methods of reaching out and touching 
someone work for your podcast.CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 199
Fostering Comments on Your Blog
In an ideal world, all communication, feedback, rants, and raves about your show 
would take place in a neat little box, keeping things nice and tidy. But because that 
won’t happen, your best bet is to build a website that both enables and encourages 
communication in your own backyard.
In Chapter 11, we demonstrate how adding show notes can improve reaching new 
audiences on account of SEO (search engine optimization). Well, here’s one more 
reason show notes are important to your podcast — they serve as mechanisms for 
interaction.
In the world of blogs, this interaction is referred to as comments. Visit just about 
any blog, read a post, and you’re likely to find a small Comments link at the bot￾tom. Some podcasters get dozens of responses per episode. Some get none. 
Although the size of your listening audience and the frequency of your podcast 
affect the number of comments you’re likely to receive, it really has more to do 
with the connection users have with your podcast.
If you’re already using a blog, you usually don’t have to do anything special to 
turn on the comments feature because most software programs accept comments 
by default. If you decide comments are not for you or your podcast, turning off 
that capability is simply a matter of selecting the right option.
FIGURE 12-1:

Much like two co-workers chatting about last night’s The Late Show with Stephen 
Colbert, two or more listeners using your website to talk to each other about your 
show speaks to the attachment they feel to what you have to say (or play). From 
the first moments of attachment, you can nurture a community around your pod￾cast. Here are some simple ways to foster your following:
» Mention that you have comments on the blog as part of the intro, 
outro, or break.
» Include a one-line promotion of your podcast in your email signature.
» Ask questions during the show and direct listeners to your blog to leave their 
comments or opinions.
» Actively respond to received comments.
Communication will also develop among the listening community itself. Rather 
than talking to you, listeners will start talking to each other, and the 
conversation — and sometimes, the community — will take on a life of its own.
Sometimes, comments that take on lives of their own mutate into hostile take￾overs, and the conversation is lost amidst an onslaught of personal attacks either 
to other posters or to you, the podcast’s and blog’s host. Neither your community 
nor you need this kind of conversation. You may want to consider moderating blog 
comments. People can still post comments, but you get to approve those com￾ments for public consumption. When someone posts a comment, you get an email 
and, with a few mouse clicks, can chose whether to approve the comment. You 
have to do a little more work, but moderating ensures that all comments meet 
your quality standards.
You may find your name or podcast mentioned in other places on the internet via 
search engines (discussed both in this chapter and Chapter 11). We recommend 
that you get engaged with those discussions as well. Be sure to check back in a 
couple days for additional follow-ups — or if you’re responding to a blog com￾ment or forum, check to see if they have an option to alert you to replies.
Focusing on Online Forums
An online forum allows individuals to post their thoughts and ideas on a variety of 
topics — of their own choosing. Through a concept known as threading, multiple 
discussions can exist independently of all the others. Topics can get buried quickly 
in email discussions. Forums work differently, keeping all threads and topics 
available for clutter-free commenting at any time.CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 201
As easy as it is to create places for these types of conversations, someone else may 
have already done it. Spend some quality time searching the internet for your 
name and your show. Maybe a devoted fan has already done the not-so-heavy 
lifting for you.
Using a hosted forum, like a hosted blog, takes away much of the burden of down￾loading, installing, and configuring the software. On the other hand, you don’t 
have quite the flexibility with a hosted solution as you would with a package you 
host yourself. One of the easier hosted forums is Tapatalk, shown in Figure 12-2. 
To get started, just follow these steps:
1. Browse to https://pfdbook.link/tapatalk.
2. Log in or click the Sign Up button and create an account.
Click either Google or Facebook to log in with one of those accounts, or click 
Continue with Email to create an account using your email. If you choose the 
last option, check your email to validate the email address.
3. Create a group:
a. In the Start Your Own section, click the Start New link.
b. Enter a group name (your podcast name). The short name is filled in 
automatically.
c. Provide a short description of your show, choose a color, and optionally upload 
a background image.
d. Validate that you are not a robot and click Continue.
FIGURE 12-2:

4. Configure your group.
On the home page under Groups, locate your group, click the three vertical 
dots, and modify the group settings to your needs.
5. Send invitations.
Using the same etiquette as a distribution list, let the world know your forums 
are available. You can send an email or announce it on your podcast.
Keep in mind that some people might see invitations as spam.
That’s it! You can now customize your forum, start new posts, and spread the 
word about your newly created forum. Much like a discussion group, a forum can 
be promoted by
» Posting the address on your website
» Adding the address to your email signature line
» Mentioning the forum on each of your podcast episodes
You can find plenty of hosted forums options by running a Google search. Most are 
supported by web ads or voluntary donations. Moderating a forum takes three to 
four hours a week for troubleshooting, answering user requests, and keeping 
spammers and forum troublemakers at bay. Four hours is a modest investment 
considering the return is a strong community.
However, keep in mind that forums and communities take time to build steam. Be 
persistent, post every day, and constantly encourage your listeners to interact 
with you and your podcast in this manner. Above all, be patient!
Remember when we said podcasting has an element of marketing? Here’s another 
opportunity to take your name to the people. Developing a public forum means 
your information becomes available to a lot of potential listeners. They may find 
your forum and become interested in your podcast, rather than the other way 
around.
Like blog comments, you might find your name or podcast being thrown around 
other forums. We highly suggest you sign up and participate in the discussion. 
Respond to the comments — positive or negative. (See the section about dealing 
with negative comments later in this chapter.)CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 203
Socializing with Social Media
Social media has become an integral part of our lives, whether you want to admit it 
or not. Online communities built around social media platforms are made up of 
profiles, posts, pages, instas, and threads for people of all ages and backgrounds. 
They can serve as one-stop shops, or combine popular forms of communication 
into a hybrid that gives you all the best features. Some platforms have been online 
longer than podcasting has been around, but podcasters rely on these platforms as 
a way to reach new audiences.
In this section, we cover several of the more popular networks. Yes, there are more 
than the ones highlighted here, but these are the ones getting a lot of the attention.
Find the networks that can get the word of your listeners back to you, help you 
create a better show, and make you a better podcaster.
Facebook
The house that Zuckerberg built, Facebook (https://pfdbook.link/facebook) 
has evolved from the “alternative to MySpace” (yeah, remember when MySpace 
was a thing?) to a one-stop shop offering a blog, a bulletin board, an online scrap￾book, video streaming, and a forum, all in one convenient location.
Registered users can create online Groups where comments can be circulated 
across others’ networks as well as your own Facebook connections. You can also 
establish a Page where you control the message being sent out to the public and 
boost posts that will appear in Facebook Feeds around the world. Facebook pro￾vides your listeners a quick interface through your computer and mobile device to 
not only offer feedback on what just went live but also preview what’s coming up 
next. You can also use your Group and Page to solicit voicemail or offer polls that 
serve as instant content for your show.
Facebook also offers Facebook Live (as we describe in Chapter 16), a video stream￾ing service where your mobile device’s camera captures where you are and what 
you are doing. While you’re filming, comments and reactions are shared with you 
and your audience. If you’re sharing video in your podcast feed, you can easily 
download your video and drop it into your feed. If you would prefer not to offer 
video, extract the audio from your Facebook Live segment and use it as a new pod￾cast episode. Facebook Live can be used as either a promotional device for your 
podcast or as content for upcoming episodes.
For more information on Facebook, pick up a copy of Facebook For Dummies, 8th 
Edition, by Carolyn Abram and Amy Karasavas.204 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
X (the platform formerly known as Twitter)
X (https://pfdbook.link/x) — although users defiantly still refer to it by its 
original name, Twitter — continues to be a fantastic and instantaneous way of 
beginning conversations, garnering feedback, and getting word out about your 
podcast while not becoming the distraction and productivity time-sink that Face￾book tends to be. Through its website or its mobile app, X lets you direct people to 
your blog when a new episode is available. Listeners can post what they’re listen￾ing to and comment on it. From X, the topics created on your blog or forum can be 
cited, and quick announcements can reach a wide variety of listeners in moments.
X delivers the instant gratification of posting content. However, it limits the char￾acters for each entry, preventing drawn-out announcements. The system is based 
on the premise of answering the question “What’s happening?” If you find some￾one is listening to your podcast, ask them for feedback. Good or bad, begin a 
simple chat and ask for the opinions of others in your X network. Use X to post 
teasers on upcoming episodes, ask for validation from comments found else￾where, and post relevant links either you or your listeners provide that tie back to 
your most recent episode’s topic.
Pinterest
Known more as a haven for DIY projects or slow cooker recipes, Pinterest 
(https://pfdbook.link/pinterest) is waiting for you and your podcasting 
street team to take full advantage of it. Think of the social network as a visual bul￾letin board — every time you post a new show, you go to your virtual bulletin 
board and post an image relevant to your show. That image could be your show art 
or a picture from your show notes. When your fans go to this board and click the 
image you just posted, they find themselves on your podcast’s site. That’s how 
boards on Pinterest work.
Create a podcast board for your show and then, when putting together show notes, 
incorporate relevant images for whatever you’re talking about. When you create a 
post — Pinterest calls this a pin — Pinterest will ask where to pull images from. 
Use your latest episode’s URL and then pick an image to represent the new 
content. Others in your Pinterest network can now interact easily with your pin 
by either leaving a comment or re-pinning it to their boards, reaching a whole 
new network.
YouTube
“My podcast is audio-only. What possible use could I have for YouTube?” Yeah, 
that’s what many new podcasters think, particularly as the challenge is that CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 205
YouTube (https://pfdbook.link/youtube) doesn’t allow MP3 files to be 
uploaded. Everything has to be a video.
So why bother?
Billions — and that billions with a big ol’ b — of people are on YouTube, looking 
for content. For example, when people search for paranormal investigation (like Tee 
and Phil’s show, in Figure 12-3) on Google, the search results include YouTube 
content. Since YouTube is part of the Google’s algorithms, YouTube is one of the 
biggest distribution channels for your podcast. Getting your podcast on YouTube 
is another way of making yourself as visible as possible.
But how do you add video to an audio production? It’s not a big leap to use some￾thing like iMovie, Premiere Elements, or Zencastr to add video to your audio 
recording, especially if you’re hosting an interview. You can also take a fully pro￾duced audio track, drop a static image on a video track, and create a video ready to 
post on YouTube. Take a look at Chapter 16 for more about working with video in 
your podcasting production.
Instagram
Instagram (https://pfdbook.link/instagram) may not come to mind as a pro￾motional platform or communication channel for your podcast, but with some

ingenious approaches, the image-exclusive platform can give your podcast an 
exciting way to let people know that new episodes are live and how to send feed￾back through voicemail.
After your latest episode goes live, do the following to post from your 
smartphone:
1. Email your show art to your smartphone, and save the art in phone’s 
photo library.
2. Pull up the URL of your show in your smartphone’s browser, find the new 
episode’s URL, and copy it to your phone’s clipboard.
3. Launch Instagram and tap your profile icon in the lower-right corner.
Your Instagram profile appears.
4. Tap the Edit Profile option, and then tap the Links option.
The Links page appears.
5. Tap the Add External Link option.
6. Paste the episode’s location in to the URL field, and then give this episode 
a title. Then tap the checkmark in the upper-right corner.
You can use the main URL for the podcast, but the individual episode’s URL will 
take your audience directly to the new episode.
7. Tap the Back option (twice) in the upper left to return to your profile.
8. If you have more than one link under your profile’s bio, tap the Link icon 
to review them, as shown in Figure 12-4.
9. Tap the + icon at the bottom to create an Instagram post with your show 
art as the featured image.
This is the same process as posting any other image to Instagram. Be sure to 
include in the post “Follow the URL in my Instagram profile . . .” so people know 
where to find the new content.
URLs are not active in Instagram posts.
If you’re creating an Instagram profile just for your podcast, you do not want an 
Instagram account that is nothing but images of your show art. Create Instagram 
show art that features images relevant to your podcast’s content or post other 
content that may be in tune to your interests or even the show’s interest. Repost￾ing the same image over and over again could get your account reported as spam 
and shut down.CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 207
Now that you have your podcast featured on Instagram, how about giving your 
listeners an easy way to leave you voicemail? They’re already on their phones. 
How can you make that happen?
1. Launch Instagram, and then go to your Instagram profile.
Tap your profile icon in the lower-right corner of the app’s Options.
2. Tap the Edit Profile button to access the Account Options menu.
3. Scroll down and tap the Switch to Professional Account option. Follow the 
steps to identify yourself as a Digital Creator account.
You can identify as one of several categories. While Podcaster is not yet one of 
the categories, we recommend you choose Digital Creator as a close second.
4. Return to your profile screen.
Several new settings appear at the bottom of the screen.
5. Tap the Page option to connect your profile to a new or existing Facebook 
page, and then click Done.
6. Tap the Contact options and enter an email address and phone number 
so your audience can easily reach you.

7. Click the check mark on the Edit Profile screen to return to the profile 
screen.
Note that your Instagram profile now has a Contact button. By tapping this 
button, visitors to your Instagram profile can directly reach out to you, as 
shown in Figure 12-5.
Threads
When Twitter became X, those who did not believe in the future of the rebrand 
began looking at alternatives. Meta, the people behind Facebook and Instagram, 
answered the call with Threads (https://pfdbook.link/threads), a throwback 
to the early days of Twitter but with a nice addition: When making a post, an 
option is automatically offered allowing the user to add another post attached to 
the original, creating a thread.
This new player in social media grants users access through a website or mobile 
app, and allows you to incorporate images, GIFs, video, and active URLs in 
your posts.
Approach Threads like Twitter in its early days, and enjoy the platform. It’s a solid 
option worth incorporating in your social media schedule.

Social media offers you these options and a whole lot more. These platforms are a 
breeze to set up, but you know what else is easy-peasy to set up? Voicemail. If you 
have a smartphone and if you can navigate through Google, you’re only a few 
clicks away from your own voicemail account.
Using Voicemail
One of the strengths of podcasting is that the content is so portable. Plenty of 
people listen to podcasts during their commute to work or on road trips. If your 
listener is away from a computer while listening to your podcast, interaction is 
difficult. How do you get comments from those listeners? Simple: Have them call 
in. Many podcasters set up a number through Google Voice (https://pfdbook.
link/googlevoice), shown in Figure 12-6, so people can call and leave a message.
To set up a listener line, follow these steps:
1. Sign up for a free Gmail account (https://pfdbook.link/gmail) if you 
don’t already have one.
2. Go to https://pfdbook.link/googlevoice.
3. Click the gear icon in the upper right.
4. Click Account in the menu to the left.
5. In the Account section, click the Get a Number button.
6. Review the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and then click Continue.
FIGURE 12-6:

7. Enter the city or area code for which you would like to get a free 
phone number.
Note: This number doesn’t have to be in your area.
Choose a phone number that is easy to remember (such as 1234) or has a 
mnemonic (a memory pattern), such as a number containing 8735 (TREK) if 
you’re doing a Star Trek podcast.
8. Click Next to link your Google voice number with your mobile number.
Enable the Do Not Disturb option for your Google Voice number to send callers 
straight to voicemail. You can find this setting in the upper right by clicking the 
Receiving Calls drop-down.
9. When Google sends you a verification code, enter it on the screen 
presented and then click Verify.
10. Click Finish.
You can now tell the world about an easy way to leave you a voicemail. When 
someone leaves you a message, you’ll get an email notification!
Okay, Google Voice is fine and dandy if you’re calling from the United States, but 
let’s not forget that podcasting can reach anyone anywhere. How do you get in 
touch with listeners from Australia, South Africa, or Tierra del Fuego? You can 
encourage your international audience to leave you a voice memo through Face￾book Messenger or take advantage of WhatsApp. Their audio can come from any￾where in the world for free.
You may find yourself with so much voicemail that you’ll have to create a separate 
show for listener feedback. Listeners, including your authors, often get a kick out 
of hearing their comments aired to the world.
Building a Community with Discord
Discord (https://pfdbook.link/discord), which is available as a smartphone 
app, tablet app, website, and standalone desktop client, hosts millions of daily 
users and hundreds of millions of messages a day. While Discord is associated 
with console gaming, eSports, and streamers (something we touch on in 
Chapter 16), podcasters are turning to the platform to build a community. Discord 
is part online forum and part social media.
By establishing a server on Discord, you offer one location for your listeners or 
viewers to meet. Once on your server, you and your audience can keep in touch CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 211
through text channels and voice channels, designated by hashtags, as shown in 
Figure  12-7. Discord enables you to not only develop and build a community 
around your podcast but also keep the conversation rolling in real time, offering 
fans a special online kaffeeklatsch (a German term that translates to coffee and gos￾sip, or friends getting together at someone’s house for a good old-fashioned chin 
wag) in a special meeting room.
And with the right apps and consent from those attending, you can record the 
Discord gatherings and offer them as podcasts themselves. Think of these shows 
as live feedback roundtables.
In this exercise, we assume that you have set up a Discord account, server, and 
channel. (If you need to help, check out Tee’s Discord For Dummies.) In the follow￾ing, we make a post about our latest podcast episode:
1. Go to and select your #general channel.
2. In the Message field, enter the following text:

3. Press the Enter key or select the send icon to post your message.
This quick message lets members of your server know that your latest episode 
is now live and ready. Sure, if listeners are subscribed to your podcast, they’ll 
be notified by their podcast app of choice, but a little reminder in Discord 
doesn’t hurt.
Discord offers a terrific opportunity to build a community around your podcast. 
Check it out through your own server, or participate on other Discord servers and 
see whether this platform would work for you in connecting with listeners.
Seeking the Comments of Others
There’s an old saying about the best-laid plans of mice and men (and how they 
often go awry). That adage can be applied to when podcasters pick up a walking 
stick, throw a haversack over their shoulders, and proclaim, “I’m going on an 
adventure!” It’s a certainty that listeners, both fan and foe, will talk about your 
show to others in a variety of formats and on platforms where you have no control.
Forums, chat rooms, and social media threads exist that already deal with your 
podcasting topic. At some point, those people will find out about your show and 
start listening. Current research shows that these people will post reviews faster 
than Ken Miles’s now legendary 1966 Le Mans race. In fact, uneducated opinions 
on the internet stand as the only things faster than Miles’s legendary Ford GT40.
Welcome to the internet community.
You can keep your eyes and ears on these groups in a variety of ways to find com￾ments regarding your podcast. Doing so will give you valuable, direct feedback 
from listeners and let you respond quickly and easily. But before you set off on 
that journey, consider the warning passed on to Indiana Jones before setting off 
on an archeological quest: Be careful what you unearth.
Trying a general search
Is it just us, or do most people do a Google search for their own name at least twice 
a week? That’s a great way to see whether people are talking about you. Google has 
a gazillion pages in its search database and constantly crawls a good percentage of 
the web, finding interesting tidbits and adding more data with each pass.
When you search, try various combinations. If your name is a common one, such 
as John Smith, you’re probably going to get a lot of unrelated hits. Try adding the CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 213
topic of your show to the search for more relevant results. For example, if 
your name is John Smith and you’re podcasting about underwater basket weaving, 
type John Smith underwater basket weaving in the Google search box. If your 
show name is unique or at least uncommon, try using the name of your show as a 
search term.
We realize that there are other search engines besides Google. Yahoo! and Bing 
produce fine results, as do a few others. If you have neither the time nor the incli￾nation to experiment with a dozen search engines, we suggest these three. They 
syndicate their results to other lesser-known (but equally valid) search engines.
Searching on a site, blog, or 
social media platform
As extensive and cool as search engines are, they can’t cover everything on the 
internet. Not only are there physical limitations as to how wide an area spiders 
and bots can cover, there are also self-imposed limitations set up by website own￾ers that inhibit a good indexing of the site. Take forums, for example. Some are set 
up in a manner that renders their internal pages invisible to the spiders and bots 
of even the best engines.
But most forums have an internal search engine that you can use to find the con￾tent in the forum — though you may be required to register with the forum to 
access its search engine. Blogs, forums, and even social media platforms have 
search features built in.
Dealing with Negative Comments
First, don’t panic.
Second, don’t respond. Not yet.
Third, let your blood pressure come down to a normal level.
Let’s face it. Anytime someone has a critical comment about us, we get an emo￾tional reaction. We call that being human, and it’s perfectly understandable and 
impossible to suppress. Following the impulse to reply right away leads you to 
discover the two reasons why it’s called a knee-jerk reaction: It’s a reflex to clash￾ing viewpoints, and you come across like a real jerk when you don’t think about 
your response before riding the emotional roller coaster. (The classic wooden ones 
like the Rebel Yell, Beast, or Grizzly. Yeah. Roller coasters. Cool.)214 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
When you’ve calmed down and are feeling more detached, reread the comment 
and plan your course of action. Here are some suggestions:
1. Reflect on the comment.
What does the comment say, really? Does the person make a valid point? Is 
there an area of improvement you should make? If the comment was specific, 
re-listen to the show in question. Did you say what the person said you did or 
stumble as bad as the person made it out to be? You may need a different 
perspective, so feel free to get someone else involved.
2. When you fully understand the criticism, decide whether or not 
you want to respond.
One option is to not respond. If you do choose to respond, consider taking the 
high road — do it respectfully. You can often disarm an inflammatory remark 
by politely accepting the comment with something like “Thank you for your 
feedback. I’ll take it in to consideration.” You may want to ask questions, get 
clarification, or propose a course of action.
3. Consider sending an email.
There’s no guarantee that the person will keep your email private. In fact, count 
on your email getting posted alongside the negative comment. Whatever you 
say in a private email should be something you would be willing to say in 
a more public forum. Keep your rebuttal rational, civil, and, above all, 
professional.
Consider negative comments as constructive feedback and an opportunity to 
improve.
AVOID THE BAITING GAME
After watching a scene in Bull Durham where an umpire goads Kevin Costner into insult￾ing him, Tee commented, “That’s so Hollywood.” His dad, a highly respected umpire in 
college and semi-pro baseball, said, “Actually, that’s not. That’s baiting. I’ve played that 
game too many times.” Although you may not think baseball umpires and podcasters 
share a common trait, they do: playing the Baiting Game.
Some people live to pick fights. Commonly referred to as trolls, they could be listeners of 
your podcasts or even other podcasters looking for a thrill in bucking the community. 
Usually the feedback from baiting contains personal attacks, misconstrued facts, flawed 
reasoning (if there’s any reason present), and a healthy dose of verbal insults akin to CHAPTER 12 Speaking Directly to Your Peeps 215
Negative feedback is never an easy thing to stomach, but look at the positive 
aspect: People are listening. And now they’re talking, blogging, and podcasting 
about you. Don’t rush out and say something irrational simply to drum up contro￾versy, but do realize that people will disagree with you now and then. You need to 
be ready to face that tough love when it comes your way.
More than anything, grow from the experience. Understand that anything you say 
in your podcast will be heard by a variety of people, with different backgrounds, 
experiences, and expectations. We’ve been on both sides of this and can count 
many times where the negative comments we received turned out to be some of 
the best feedback. We think we’re better podcasters for it.
punching someone in the ear and then running away. When this happens, don’t reply. 
Ever. By not replying, the words sent to you are a waste of time and effort on the 
sender’s part, not yours.
Not replying isn’t a guarantee that the baiter will simply disappear. You may need to 
moderate your blog to make sure people don’t post comments that you deem inappro￾priate. And as you moderate comments, continue to delete the trolls’ comments, so 
they never see the light of day.
The high road has a better view than the low. In some cases, like the Baiting Game, the 
best response is none at all.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 217
Chapter 13
Fishing for Listeners
There are hundreds of thousands of podcasters. By some estimates, the num￾ber of subscriptions exceeds one billion. However, those numbers pale in 
comparison with the potential audience, which is somewhere in the billions 
of people worldwide with a broadband internet connection. Although the audience 
is large, the options for listeners are legion. How do you attract an audience to 
your podcast?
In this chapter, we show you a variety ways to get a larger listener base. Some cost 
money; others cost time. By using these methods, you can expose your podcast to 
the right people at the right time.
Getting Your Podcast Ready for Promotion
Whether you’ll be spending money or energy, you need to do some prep work 
before you start your campaign. Don’t rush a promotional campaign — take the 
time to carefully plan and execute it. Otherwise, you not only waste time and 
money but may also turn off potential listeners to your show, making it many 
times more difficult to attract them back for a second chance.
Polishing your presentation
New podcasters need a few episodes under their belt before they hit their stride. If 
you’re on podcast episode number three, you likely haven’t fleshed out your show. 
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Getting your podcast ready for 
advertising
» Using paid advertising
» Taking advantage of free advertising
» Generating buzz about your podcast218 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Sure, you may have been planning your podcast for months, or had experience 
behind the mic on another medium, or nailed it from the beginning. But give 
yourself at least five full episodes to find the sweet spot. Experiment with show 
segments, running times, and the overall content flow to discover your strengths 
as well as your weaknesses.
Checking your bandwidth
In Chapter  10, we introduce you to the concepts of unmetered bandwidth and 
unlimited space. Each new listener consumes more of your precious bandwidth. 
For podcasters with limited bandwidth, getting more listeners can be an expen￾sive proposition.
If you’re using the services of LibSyn (https://pfdbook.link/libsyn) or 
another podcast-hosting company with unmetered bandwidth, you don’t have 
to worry about your bandwidth and can safely skip ahead to the next section. 
See Chapter  10 for more information about this and other affordable hosting 
services.
Many podcasters start out using a standard web-hosting service to host their 
podcast files and are quickly surprised when they run out of bandwidth. We’re 
more surprised about their poor math skills. Suppose your site is allowed 100MB 
of monthly transfers. On the 10th of July, you log in to your bandwidth stats page 
and see that you’re already at 60MB for the month. Will you make it? Here are the 
formulas to figure this out:
Bandwidth consumed / number of days so far this month = daily bandwidth rate
Daily bandwidth rate × 31 (maximum total number of days in the month) = total 
bandwidth needed
Now plug in your numbers to find out your daily bandwidth rate:
60MB / 10 = 6MB
Your site is consuming about 6MB per day. Now multiply 6MB by the number of 
days in the month (31) to get the total bandwidth you need for the month:
6MB × 31 = 186MB
You’re not going to stay within your 100MB limit. You will be roughly 86MB over 
your 100MB plan.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 219
That sounds — and is — simple. As a real-world example, Chuck checked his 
bandwidth usage on July 18 and found that he had used 256.65GB in the first 
17 days. First, he finds out his daily bandwidth:
256.65GB / 17 days = 15GB average daily transfer rate for July
Then he finds out his total bandwidth for the month:
15GB × 31 days = 465GB
As you can see, he needs 465GB of bandwidth to get through the month, assuming 
his traffic stays steady and doesn’t increase. If his bandwidth ceiling was 500GB, 
he’d need to think twice before starting an advertising campaign because he’d 
likely hit that ceiling, and his hosting provider would likely shut down access to 
all those brand-new podcast listeners he just worked so hard to get. Not a good 
way for anyone to spend their time.
You should be using less than 50 percent of your monthly allotment of bandwidth 
before starting an advertising campaign. If you’re using more than that, you’ll run 
out of room and will have to seek alternative hosting options before proceeding. 
We cover some of these alternative options in Chapter 10.
Figuring out your USP
USP, or unique selling proposition, is a message that sells your podcast to potentials 
listeners. Although you probably aren’t charging money to listen to your podcast, 
make no mistake that you need to sell it to potential listeners if you’re considering 
advertising.
Why should a potential listener listen to your podcast? And more importantly, 
how can you, as the party advertising the podcast, present a message that makes 
a potential listener want to listen?
Plenty of books, websites, seminars, and post-graduate degree programs are 
dedicated to the subtle nuances of marketing and advertising. We’re not suggest￾ing you go that far. But we do suggest that you take a good, hard look at what you 
produce every week and come up with a concise and consistent message to pro￾mote your show.
For example, when Chuck was looking at advertising for his Technorama podcast, 
he found that the tech podcast market was saturated. Several dozen shows repur￾posed the same news about Microsoft, Google, and Apple. So Chuck chose to spot￾light the strange, bizarre, and unusual items that are typically passed via email 
from geek to geek — the steam-powered Nintendo DS, the motorcycle that folds 220 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
into a briefcase, and the device made of wood that adds binary numbers. Here is 
the USP for Technorama: Technorama takes a lighthearted look at the world of tech, 
science, sci-fi, and all things geek.
Sometimes calling in help from the outside is a good idea. Ask friends, family, and 
even listeners to tell you why they listen to your show. We’re talking about not a 
catchy slogan or jingle from a Madison Avenue marketing firm but a plain￾English (or your language of choice) way to tell interested people what your show 
is about and why they should be listening.
We can’t give you a step-by-step outline for this one. Spend a few days on it. Try 
it out on some folks first. When you find a message that fits, you’re ready to 
proceed on your advertising quest.
Exploring Various Advertising Options
You can advertise to give your podcast exposure to a larger audience in many 
ways, but no surefire solution exists. Although we’ve been podcasting since the 
early days, we still find the advertising process daunting. However, that doesn’t 
mean we can’t take a chance or two and see what happens, right?
If you’re interested in making money on your podcast, the first thing you’ll want 
to consider is ROI, or return on investment. Now we’re starting to sound more like 
Advertising For Dummies, so bear with us. Simply put, is the money you spend on 
advertising going to generate additional . . . anything? It doesn’t make sense to 
spend $5 or $5,000 if you won’t get more of something — listeners, advertisers, 
sponsors, money — in return. This is ROI in a nutshell.
IS ADVERTISING RIGHT FOR YOUR 
PODCAST?
Before launching your advertising campaign, apply some Jurassic Park logic. In that 
movie, Jeff Goldblum’s character chastises the dinosaur-resurrecting mogul with “Your 
scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think 
if they should.” Good advice for podcasters and mad scientists alike.
For many, podcasting is a labor of love and not a money-making proposition. As such, 
spending too much money or time on advertising may make a passion seem a heck of a 
lot more like a job — and you probably already have one of those.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 221
Give me a boost, Facebook
Still the largest of social media platforms, Meta’s Facebook is a good place to con￾sider a modest financial investment to reach a larger group people with hopes of 
converting them into loyal listeners. This is the same reason your Facebook feed 
has ads for shaving razors, car batteries, or pillows to help you stop snoring. 
Someone wants you to see what they have to offer and somewhere in their mas￾sive collection of data, you fit their targeted profile — so why not turn the tables 
and start reaching people who fit your profile?
For a price, boosts allow you to expose your Facebook post on the timelines of 
people who don’t directly follow you or those who may have shared your content 
in the past. The price is determined by how many people you want to reach.
Let’s assume you’ve already set up a Facebook Page for your podcast as one of the 
many ways you and your listeners can stay in touch. As you post a new episode, 
you mention it on your podcast’s Facebook Page, which has 30 followers. You 
want to reach more people, so you share your post to the 500 followers on your 
personal account (mostly family, friends, and co-workers) in hopes that some of 
them will share it.
How do you reach people that you haven’t already met to let them know about 
your podcast? A boost is the Facebook equivalent of going to a party and shaking 
hands and introducing yourself and your show. When you boost, you determine 
the amount to spend and define who you want to target.
For years, Dave Slusher’s Evil Genius Chronicles (https://pfdbook.link/evilgenius) 
has been vocal about not advertising and not working toward a huge listener base. 
Dave makes a podcast for one person — Dave Slusher. If other people hear about the 
podcast and decide to listen, great, as long as they enjoy it and don’t expect him to be 
something he’s not. Fame — even the moderate fame a popular podcaster can 
achieve — is a double-edged sword. Before long, emails and voicemails are flying in 
with ideas, suggestions, and even mandates for how you can make the show better for 
the listeners. Don’t forget that fan is short for fanatic, and fanatic people don’t always 
behave rationally.
Choose this path with caution. “Doing it for the love” probably means you can (and 
should) forgo advertising your podcast. Advertising is not a fast way to get more listen￾ers, but it is a fast way to burn through money without a lot to show for it.222 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Boost a post containing your episode, not your page. People will be more interested 
in hearing your breakthrough research on stopping telomere breakdown to extend 
a cell’s lifespan than just knowing about your science research show.
You should have no problem finding your post to boost. Facebook practically 
pushes it in your face when you view your own timeline. Chuck found it odd at 
first to see Technorama ads with the latest post on his timeline. Then he looked 
closely at the top of the ad and discovered the text “Only you can see this preview 
until you run this ad” and a blue Boost Post button. When you click the Boost Post 
button, the window shown in Figure 13-1 appears.
Facebook gives you a few ways to choose the target audience for your ad. Scroll 
through the UI featured in Figure 13-1, and you’ll find many options to consider 
for targeting your ad, the duration of the ad campaign, and so on.
On the Boost Post page, scroll down to the Audience section for the options relat￾ing to who should see your ad. We suggest you focus on the following details:
» People You Choose Through Targeting: When you click this option, note the 
pencil icon, which allows you to choose a specific gender, age range, location, 
and detailed targeting (based on demographics, interests, and behaviors). 
FIGURE 13-1:
The Facebook 
Boost Post 
feature lets you 
target Facebook 
users with 
interests that 
align with your 
show’s content.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 223
Think of detailed targeting as your way to match keyword searches with 
people. If you just did an episode with a noted independent horror film 
director, you might include interests such as independent movies, horror 
movies, and movies.
» People Who Like Your Page: This option doesn’t sound like it’s going to get 
you anything more than people who already like your page and are likely to 
see your content, but thanks to Facebook’s magical algorithms, it also targets 
people who like other pages similar to yours.
» People Who Like Your Page and Their Friends: This option lets you place 
your ad on the timeline of not only people who already follow your page but 
also their friends. It’s almost like paying everyone to share your link for 
you — does that make you feel dirty too?
» Create New: This final option is similar to the first one but enables you to 
create groupings of targets to save and use on multiple ads. This feature is 
handy if your show has a variety of topics on a regular basis. For example, if 
you have a science podcast, you might set up one group that targets people 
interested in space exploration, NASA, and Mars, and a second group for 
those interested in DNA, gene sequencing, and genetic mutations. That way, 
when you finish the interview with the rocket technician, you can target the 
right group and repurpose that group weeks or months later when you air the 
tour at JPL.
Of course, there’s always the subject of money. How many people can you reach 
and how long do you run the ad? Fortunately, you can choose a budget that works 
for you, starting with just a few dollars and running for as little as a day. The more 
you spend, the larger the potential audience. The pop-up window has a special 
section that helps you calculate the cost before you commit. No surprises here that 
will force you into a second mortgage, thank goodness. You can make your pay￾ment by credit or debit card, PayPal, or an online banking account.
If you’re like most podcasters, you’re working on a budget, so save it for special 
shows. If you do a music podcast and just landed a spectacular interview with 
Alice Cooper, that’s a good candidate to boost!
Be sure to read the Facebook Advertising Policy (https://pfdbook.link/
fbpolicies) before launching your campaign. Yes, it’s a lot of text, but it can save 
you from a nasty surprise that gets your ad rejected. Chuck learned this on his first 
attempt when he discovered that images on boosted posts must not contain 
more than 20 percent text — frustrating.
While Facebook is a major player in social media, this may change over time. We 
encourage you to look into other avenues for ad campaigns such as PayPerPost 
(https://pfdbook.link/payperpost).224 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Insta-traffic with Instagram
In Chapter 12, we walk you through the process of switching your Instagram pro￾file from a personal account to a business profile. With a business profile, you can 
offer your listeners and viewership quick and easy access to your podcast’s email 
and voicemail — and you can also boost your posts. Take one of your images and 
turn it into a sponsored post, reaching beyond your own network to Instagram￾mers who may not be following you but share interests relevant to your podcast.
When you activate your (free) business profile, Instagram connects to either a 
Facebook account or a Facebook Page that you manage. Along with the option to 
go to a profile and tap a Contact button, all your posts will offer you the option to 
promote that post. When you promote a post, your Instagram post — the image 
and its accompanying text — appears in the feeds of the audiences you target. If 
this sounds similar to what happens when boosting Facebook posts, it’s because 
you’re working with the same audiences you are building with Facebook. Remem￾ber, Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram.
And promoting a post on Instagram is just as easy as on Facebook:
1. Launch your Instagram app.
2. Create a post pertaining to your podcast or find a post about your 
podcast in your Instagram profile.
3. Tap the Boost Post button in the lower right.
If prompted, decide whether you want to proceed with or without a Facebook 
Ad account. Your Instagram business account should also be activated to 
complete these steps; see Chapter 12 for details.
4. On the Goal page, choose an option under the What Do You Want People 
to Do heading.
We recommend selecting Visit Your Website to set this promotion for a specific 
episode. Don’t tap Next yet.
5. Edit your website URL:
a. In the Visit Your Website section, tap the Edit option. The Visit Your Website 
option is called an action item — what you want your audience to do when 
they see your ad. Most of the time, you want your audience to visit a URL.
b. Enter the website URL. We recommend that you paste a link to the episode 
you want to promote.
c. Tap the checkmark in the upper right, and then tap Next to continue.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 225
6. Select your audience, and then tap Next to continue.
You can choose an audience you’ve built on Facebook, build your own 
audience, or have Instagram build an audience for you.
When you sync your Instagram business account with your Facebook Page, 
the audiences you’ve defined on Facebook are automatically carried over to 
Instagram.
7. Using the sliders, set the total budget and duration for the ad campaign. 
Then tap Next to continue.
8. Review the details of your boosted post before finalizing the transaction, 
as shown in Figure 13-2.
If you want to make changes before finalizing your ad, tap < (back) at the top 
left of your screen.
9. To begin your campaign, tap Boost Post.
Instagram (like Facebook) reviews your post and notifies you when the promotion 
goes live. The platform provides analytics on your post that tell you the amount of 
traffic, the CTR (clickthrough rate), and the remaining budget. Instagram’s analyt￾ics on a boosted post are separate from the analytics of the original post. In other 
FIGURE 13-2:
Before you 
submit an 
Instagram post 
for promotion, 
you can review 
your order.226 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
words, you’ll see that some people who like your boosted Instagram post do not 
add numbers to the original post. This is Instagram’s way of keeping organic traf￾fic separate from paid traffic.
When you set up a boosted Facebook post, you can simultaneously run a boosted 
post on Instagram, provided the post is an image (not just a text post) with an 
appropriate resolution of 1080 x 1350 pixels. Make sure you use an image that 
looks good on a laptop as well as a mobile device.
It falls on you to decide, based on your budget, how many people you want to 
reach, how long to run the ad, and if you need to change the demographic. Pres￾ently, Instagram’s budget suggestions for posts are modest, if not humble. Choose 
a budget that works for you, starting with just a few dollars a day and having it run 
for a week. As with Facebook, the larger your budget and the longer you run it, the 
larger your potential audience.
You can’t make active links in Instagram (yet). Before posting your show’s art or 
the image related to your episode, go into your Instagram profile and paste the 
URL of your latest episode into the featured URL field. Once you have the episode’s 
URL in place (see Figure  13-3), compose a post that includes the text, “Visit 
the URL in our Instagram’s profile.” This way, people can reach your podcast 
through Instagram easily.
FIGURE 13-3:
Dropping the 
URL into your

offers your 
audience a way 
to reach your 
podcast through 
the app.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 227
The Facebook requirement that images on boosted posts contain no more than 
20 percent text does not apply to Instagram posts. Therefore, show art like the 
one shown previously in Figure 13-1 is more than okay to use, provided it’s at a 
good resolution, preferably a minimum width of 1080 pixels and an aspect ratio 
of 1.91:1 or 4:5.
Writing press releases
Some podcasters have enjoyed enormous success attracting new listeners with 
press releases. On the positive side, you have a lot of room in a press release to talk 
about your show. On the negative side, you have no guarantee who — if anyone — 
will pick up and run your press release.
Writing an effective press release is an art form. It has to appeal both to the man￾aging editor of the publication considering your release as well as to John Q. Pub￾lic. Here are some ideas to help you write a good press release:
» Hook them early. This is also known as BLUF, or bottom line up front. 
Whatever you have to say, be sure to say it first and grab their attention.
» Tell a story. Your press release should convey what you want to say in a 
short, concise manner. Start with the basics of good journalism: who, what, 
when, where, and why. Three or four paragraphs made up of two or three 
sentences each is a good guideline to follow. Try to answer the most common 
questions people will have about your announcement.
» Target the press release. Write a press release suitable to your target 
audience and send it to those likely to run it. You’ll likely have to write more 
than one version. A story about “hometown boy writes successful book on 
podcasting” is more likely to get published in the college alumni school paper 
than USA Today.
» Include the tag line. Use your USP (unique selling proposition). This is the 
perfect place to give someone that 30-second pitch about your show.
» Add some quotes. Include a few lines from the people involved. Keep the 
quotes positive and upbeat.
» Provide appropriate URLs. Don’t forget to provide links to your site or sites. 
Sometimes you may get so wrapped up in the wording of a press release that 
you forget the point of the press release: to get people to come to your site 
and try your content.228 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Read a number of press releases to get a feel for the marketing aspect.
If you know people who have written press releases in the past, see if they can 
lend some help — if not, reach out. Remember that the podcasting community 
can be a helpful network.
PR Newswire
PR Newswire (https://pfdbook.link/prnewswire) is the cream of the crop 
when it comes to online and offline distribution of your press release. PR News￾wire has the capability to send your press release to thousands of media outlets, 
ranging from newsprint, radio, websites, television, and more.
The company also provides editorial services for your press release as well as tips 
on how to write a release that’s more likely to get results. If you’re serious about 
getting the maximum exposure for your show and are thinking about using 
a press release as part of your strategy, PR Newswire is worth considering. 
However, many independent podcasters find the cost (around $300 to start) 
prohibitive.
PRWeb
PRWeb (https://pfdbook.link/prweb), shown in Figure 13-4, offers paid and 
donation-based services, and it boasts a good number of media outlets. The main 
difference between the two services is the means of the distribution. PRWeb works 
to put your press release in front of thousands of online media outlets. Offline 
media sources may subscribe as well, but the primary distribution is online. Using 
mostly online distribution isn’t a bad thing. After all, your podcast is an online 
service, and you’re likely most effective reaching an audience who is already 
online. We’ve had various write-ups in online and offline media, and we’ve always 
received more traffic and attention to our websites from the online sources.
For $99, PRWeb distributes your press release (among many other things) in 
search engines and news sites. Additionally, press releases at this level are 
reviewed by the PRWeb editorial team, providing valuable feedback on ways to 
make your release more meaningful and more likely to be picked up by various 
other news organizations around the internet.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 229
Promoting Your Podcast
Before you start throwing money toward an advertising campaign, consider all the 
ways you can spread the word about your podcast without a financial investment. 
You should probably be doing these things even if you plan on tossing out 
some cash.

In Chapter 11, we give you several tips on how to make show notes more appealing 
to search engines. You can employ similar methods to your entire website so that 
it receives the maximum exposure and visibility to search engines.

Submitting promos to other podcasts
Podcasting has been called a great hall of mirrors because many podcasts spend at 
least some time talking about other podcasts! This feeling of community adds to 
the distinctiveness that is podcasting and is, for the most part, accepted by the 
general podcasting audience. The podcasting landscape continues to grow and is 
so fractured that many listeners look to their favorite podcasters for help finding 
other podcasts.
The majority of corporate podcasts see other podcasts as competition and are as 
likely to talk about another podcast as a traditional broadcaster is to talk about 
another station across town. Even some independent podcasters make a point not 
to talk about other podcasts, simply because they don’t want to add to the hall of 
mirrors effect.
One of the more widespread ways podcasters talk about other podcasters is with a 
promo, which is an audio clip that describes your show. Other podcasters insert 
this clip into their shows — play it on the air, so to speak — thereby presenting 
your message to their subscribed and downloading audiences.
Promos are a great way to let other people know that your podcast exists. Listen 
to other podcasts to find a few that play promos. Note the average length of the 
promos they play and the type of content being presented. Is it all serious busi￾ness, or is more light-hearted humor involved?
Query other podcasters and offer your promo. In exchange, offer to play a promo 
for those podcasters gracious enough to play your promo. Some podcasters are 
good at making promos and even offer to make promos for free for other 
podcasters.
One final note about sending out promos: Ask. Unless the show specifically says 
“Submit your promos to us at . . .,” be a good podcasting citizen and send the 
podcasters a note asking whether they’d like to run your promo. Requests that 
start off with “I listen to your show every week because you . . .” are likely to get 
a better response than those starting (and ending) with “Please run my promo.” 
Consider taking a reverse approach, as well. If you listen to a podcast and want to 
run their promo on your show, ask if they have a promo and offer to play it. Most 
podcasters are more than happy to contribute and reciprocate.
Recording your promo
You’ve done the hard work by figuring out what makes your podcast special; 
now you need to sit down and record your promo. Doing so isn’t difficult. We tend 
to enjoy the ones that come from the voice of the podcaster the most. Here are a 
few tips:CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 231
» Write your script. Or don’t. Some folks are happy flying off the cuff. But in 
the interest of time, we recommend putting some thoughts down on paper 
and running through them out loud to see how long it takes. Most promos 
are under a minute long.
Keep your promo between 30 to 90 seconds long. Anything over 90 seconds 
may be a hard sell to get other podcasters to run it.
» Add effects and music from your podcast. If you use the same music in 
your show each week (see Chapter 8) or have some special sound effects that 
brand the show as yours, include them in your promo. Effects are a great way 
to tie in your promotion to your show, giving new listeners assurance that 
they’ve subscribed to the right place.
» Don’t forget your website URL! Too many podcasters provide the link 
to their podcast feed. Useless, in our opinion. Instead, repeat the URL of 
your website, where it should be painfully simple to subscribe to the RSS 
feed for your podcast. Now here’s hoping you picked an easy-to-remember 
domain name!
» Include a link to the promo on your website. Recording a promo and sending 
it out to a few podcasts is great, but what about all the other people who you 
inspire to make their own podcast? Chances are good that if you put a direct link 
to your promo or create a web page featuring your promo (or promos), other 
podcasters will grab that file and include your promo in their shows.
» Speak clearly and enunciate! You know the name of your show very well, 
so you might say it so quickly that it doesn’t come out as clearly as it should. 
When you introduce your show to someone who has never heard the show 
name before, slow down. Say your podcast’s title as if you were introducing 
yourself to someone new. While researching for this book, we listened to 
several promos where the podcaster said the name of the show so fast that 
it reminded us of those misheard lyrics in a song. Was that Jimmy Hendrix 
podcast actually called “Kiss this guy dot com”? If it weren’t for a printed URL, 
we wouldn’t have any idea what their show was called or where to find it.
When you send other podcasters your promo, save some email bandwidth 
and send the link on your website rather than the file itself. Make it easy to 
download the promo file from your site!
Giving interviews
Podcasting is the fastest growing medium we’ve seen . . . ever! If your podcast 
covers a new area of the world or addresses an underserved market, people are out 
there who want to talk with you about it.232 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Contact the publications, websites, and other media outlets that cover the 
industry your podcast covers or that might take an interest in you, as Tee and Phil 
did when reaching out and landing an interview with their alma mater (see 
Figure  13-5). Send them your press release, along with a personalized note 
telling them about your show and stating that you’re happy to do an interview.
Most interviews today are conducted over the phone or using a videoconferencing 
platform such as Google Meet or Zoom. A handful are conducted via email. Prep￾aration can make the difference between a poor interview that never sees publica￾tion and a well-delivered interview that keeps the audience  — as well as the 
interviewer — engaged and entertained.
FIGURE 13-5:

Rossi and 
Tee — both 
graduates of

University —

their alma mater.CHAPTER 13 Fishing for Listeners 233
Here are a few tips to make your interview go swimmingly:
» Eliminate the BS factor. If you have only a passing interest in the subject for 
which you’re trying to pass yourself off as an expert, you’ll quickly be discov￾ered, thrashed repeatedly, and left out for the buzzards. The people who are 
interviewing you are probably experts in their fields, so don’t try to come off 
as something you aren’t. Be open and honest about your experience and 
focus on why you’re doing the podcast. Even if you’re considered a subject 
matter expert, remember that your listener may not be. You might want to 
consider simplifying things on behalf of the listeners new to the subject. Of 
course, this depends on your listeners and the subject being covered.
» Mention your website over and over. Remember that the listeners, readers, 
or viewers you are being interviewed in front of have no idea who you are and 
what you are about. This is your chance to sell yourself and your podcast. If 
your interviewer is good, you’ll be given ample opportunity to mention your 
website and podcast. If not, it’s up to you to find chances to drop your 
podcast’s name and URL.
» Stay positive. If the interviewer knows anything about podcasting, they’ll likely 
ask questions on the future of podcasting, the death of radio, amateur versus 
professional, and all sorts of other controversial topics. Unless your podcast is 
about podcasting, we recommend rising above the din. This conversation 
doesn’t serve you or the audience. Point out how your podcast addresses the 
issue and resist the temptation to get into an argument — unless your podcast 
is about arguing with interviewers. In that case, go right ahead.
Generating buzz
All the processes we outline in this chapter are geared toward one thing: generat￾ing buzz for your podcast. The more folks you can get talking about your show, the 
better. We don’t buy the “any publicity is good publicity” line, but we do think 
“Hey have you heard about?” conversations are the best form of advertising 
you can get.
Sometimes, you need to take the message to the masses. Find a discussion group 
or an online forum germane to your podcast’s area of interest and start posting. 
When you post, follow standard forum and community etiquette — don’t start out 
with “Hey, I’m new to the group and have this great podcast!” Instead, listen in 
on the conversation, comment on a few threads, and get people used to your voice 
before you hit them with the come-listen-to-my-podcast pitch. In fact, the best 234 PART 4 Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
way to pitch your podcast is to never utter those words. Instead, offer up things 
like “Last week on my podcast, I covered the very thing you were talking about, 
Jill.” It shows you’re paying attention to the conversation and not just looking to 
spam a newsgroup or mailing list with your podcast URL.
A fine line exists between tasteful self-promotion and outright spamming. Gen￾erating buzz isn’t the same as advertising. Advertising has its place, but most 
forums don’t welcome it. If you can’t decide whether your post contains too much 
advertising, it probably does.5

Chapter 14
Podcasting and AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) covers a lot of ground. There’s ML, LLMs, DSPs, 
VAEs, and so many other acronyms they could turn alphabet soup into a 
seven-course meal. In this chapter, we focus on generative AI and machine 
learning (ML), and how they can streamline your podcast workflow from audio 
and video editing to your blog posts to social media.
Machine learning has been around for a few years, but generative AI (GenAI) 
broke into the public consciousness in late 2022 with ChatGPT, which we cover 
later in the chapter. The race began as software companies, AI developers, and 
entrepreneurs looked for ways to tap AI’s potential to save time, produce more, 
and work more efficiently. Podcasters were no exception in benefitting from this 
innovation. As we discovered while researching this chapter, a lot of cool stuff is 
available that can save you time and help you work not only efficiently but 
ethically.
Until recently, the way most people thought about editing a podcast was to import 
the recorded audio into an app such as Audacity or Adobe Audition and edit the 
waveforms (those squiggly lines representing the audio). Those days may be 
numbered as new apps apply AI and make it even easier to import your audio (or 
video), generate a transcript, edit the transcript, and change the related audio. 
You can even update the text and have AI create new audio so you don’t have to 
re-record!

Editing Made Easy with Hindenburg PRO
The Hindenburg PRO app enables you to import audio and create a text transcript 
(or manuscript, as they call it). Then, as you edit the text, the audio is updated. For 
example, suppose you were talking about an upcoming date in your recording and 
said, “Join us for our live event coming up in June — no wait, that should be July. 
Join us for our live event coming up in July.” Much like editing a document, simply 
select and delete the text you don’t want. When you export your creation, the June 
mistake is gone.
When you’ve finished editing the text, you simply export the audio. If you prefer, 
you can still access the waveforms and edit them in a more traditional fashion, 
while the software keeps the manuscript up to date.
Hindenburg PRO also offers multi-track editing, automatic leveling as you import 
audio files, and a free 30-day trial. Follow these steps to get started with Hinden￾burg PRO:
1. Get the software:
a. Navigate to the Hindenburg website at https://pfdbook.link/hindenburg.
b. Create an account and set up a service level to suit your needs (or use the free 
30-day trial.)
c. Click the Buy button in the Hindenberg PRO section or the Trial button at the top 
of the page for Hindenburg PRO.
d. Download the software, and then follow the standard installation instructions 
for your computer.
e. Open the Hindenburg PRO app, and enter your username and password. If you 
purchased the software, also enter your license key.
2. On the left side of the Hindenburg PRO screen, click the track labeled 
Speak. Then import your audio:
a. Choose File  ➪   Import or click the import icon on the toolbar.
b. In the window that appears, navigate to and select the audio file on your local 
hard drive.
c. Click Open.CHAPTER 14 Podcasting and AI 239
Hindenburg PRO automatically sets the audio levels, saving you time by raising 
the lows and bringing down the loud spots.
If you have music in addition to your spoken words in the imported recording, 
go to Hindenburg PRO’s settings (choose Hindenberg PRO  ➪   Settings), click 
the Advanced tab, and deselect Perform Automatic Leveling after Import and 
Record. As your music fades in or out, automatic leveling may try to bring up 
those low spots, thus making the fade ineffective.
3. Click the header on the audio track (the part with the name of your audio 
track), and choose Tools  ➪   Transcribe to create the manuscript.
4. If your audio track has multiple speakers, select the Multiple Speakers 
option in the Transcribe popup window that appears.
Hindenburg PRO automatically recognizes and labels the speakers in the 
manuscript. By default, each speaker has a name, such as F2 S1. To change the 
speaker name, click the first label and rename it. All instances of that speaker 
are updated. Repeat this for each additional speaker to make it easier to 
determine where to make edits.
5. When prompted, click OK to download the transcription services, 
allowing you to work offline if needed. When the download completes, 
click OK again.
This prompt appears only the first time you use the transcribe tool.
6. Click OK in the Transcribe popup window.
The manuscript appears in the bottom half of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 14-1. When the transcription is complete, Hindenburg PRO displays 
the text in the Manuscript box.
7. Click Close to close the Transcribe pop-up and complete the process.
8. Edit the manuscript in the bottom half of the screen.
Use your cursor to select text in the manuscript; the corresponding section of 
the waveform above will be selected as well. You can do the reverse: Select 
parts of the waveform and the corresponding text in the manuscript will be 
highlighted.
• Once the text is selected, use basic editing operations such as cut, copy, 
paste, and delete.
• If the text is incorrect in the transcript, use ⌘ +Enter (Mac), or Ctrl+Enter 
(Windows) to edit the text. Just note that changing the text does not affect 
the audio because Hindenburg PRO does not have text-to-speech 
capabilities.240 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
9. After you have completed your edits, click anywhere in the audio section 
(top half of the screen.)
The audio track labels are now selected and the manuscript section is dese￾lected. This is important because the next step is to export. If you were to leave 
the manuscript section selected, you would export the manuscript.
10. Export the file:
a. Choose File  ➪   Export, or click the export icon on the toolbar at the top of the app.
b. Provide a name for your file and identify the file format. If you plan to continue 
editing in another app such as Audacity or Audition, export the file as 
WAV. If your production is complete, export to MP3. For most cases, you’ll 
be fine using Med Quality (Stereo, 128kbps) for the Encoding setting. Check 
out Chapter 9 for more information on bit rates and file sizes.
c. Click Save.

Getting Descript-ive
Descript (https://pfdbook.link/descript) is a software application similar to 
Hindenburg PRO that enables you to import audio, create a transcript, and edit the 
text to affect the audio. In addition, it can automatically remove filler words and 
FIGURE 14-1:

offers team collaboration. Descript is subscription-based and offers several plans, 
including a limited free trial.
Our favorite feature of Descript is that you can create content that wasn’t in the 
original recording. Let’s say you have imported your latest Pasta-Cast episode 
and, as you review the transcript, realize that you said “vermicelli” when you 
meant to say “angel hair” — gasp! One can only imagine the flood of negative 
comments you’d get from the Pastafarians. (Look up Church of the Flying 
Spaghetti Monster if you missed that one.) No worries — just edit the text and 
have Descript generate new audio in your voice!
Let’s look at how you can do some basic operations with Descript.
1. Get and set up the app:
a. Go to https://pfdbook.link/descript and create an account.
b. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the Descript app.
c. Open the Descript app.
d. Using the account credentials you created on the website, sign in to the app. The 
screen in Figure 14-2 appears, displaying a number of features.
e. Choose the features that are right for you and then click Continue.
f. If you’re planning to collaborate with other team members, add them now.
Now that the setup is done, you’re presented with a workspace.
FIGURE 14-2:

2. From the Descript menu, choose File  ➪   New  ➪   Project to create a new 
audio (or video) project.
For the remainder of this example, we work with an audio project.
3. In the field at the top, give your project a name, such as Event Promo or 
Episode 16.
4. Upload your audio:
a. Click Add File.
b. Use the popup window to navigate to the file on your local hard drive.
c. Click Open.
After your file is imported, Descript creates a transcript of your audio. Isn’t AI 
wonderful!
You could use Descript to type (or copy and paste) the text and generate the 
audio, but we’re going to use prerecorded audio to demonstrate transcription.
If your recording uses a separate audio track for each person, choose 
Actions  ➪   Add New Layer  ➪   Files, and add each file individually. Just be sure 
that all files start at the same place; otherwise, the transcript could have words 
out of order and your editing process won’t work.
5. Place your cursor at the beginning of the text and then click the play icon 
in the bottom center. As the audio plays, read and review the transcript 
to see where corrections are needed, as shown in Figure 14-3:
• To delete any bits of your recording, select the text and press the Delete 
key. Just like a word processor. How simple!
• Unlike a word processor, if you need to make changes, select the text, and 
click C (correct) in the menu bar that appears above the text, change the 
text, and click C again. The text color changes to indicate the correction. 
Note that this step updates only the text; the audio is unaffected.
• To create audio, also known as an overdub, select the text and choose 
Replace  ➪   Overdub (D). Type the new text, click Enable Speech Generation, 
and follow the instructions to upload an audio sample of your voice. (You 
need to enable speech generation only the first time you use it.) The button 
changes to Overdub and the text turns to speech. Again, AI to the rescue!
6. Export your file:
a. After your edits are complete, choose File  ➪   Export.
b. In the Export field, select Current Composition.
c. Select your file format. If your production is complete, export to MP3. If you 
plan to continue editing in another app such as Audacity or Audition, export 
as WAV. If you export to MP3, you can also set some of the metadata fields 
(ID3 tags). For more information on ID3 tags, see Chapter 9.CHAPTER 14 Podcasting and AI 243
Instead of deleting mistakes, consider cutting and pasting them at the end of the 
transcript as outtakes. Some shows, such as ServiceNow’s Break Point podcast, 
include outtakes (or bloopers) at the end of each episode as a way to keep listeners 
engaged until the very end.

SPEAK UP, SOUND OFF: GenAI AND THE 
HUMAN VOICE
Having software re-create your voice for quick corrections is incredibly cool. Your 
podcasting authors can speak of a time when pickups — the time when speaking 
mistakes — would slow down production. Now tools such as Descript can do the heavy 
lifting, turning a hiccup into the perfect take. But when AI reads an entire paragraph or 
an entire passage, something really cool becomes incredibly unsettling.
Descript is classified as a large language model (LLM), a subset of deep learning (DL). 
The AI learns by listening to samples of your voice, studying details such as cadence, 
pitch, tone, and emphasis. When provided with a few words here and there, LLMs can 
easily re-create a single word. Offer an LLM hours of your voice (and yes, creating hours 
of your voice is easy to do when podcasting) and the AI service can produce more 
robust results. ElevenLabs (https://pfdbook.link/elevenlabs) has its own 
generative voice AI service that can create an uncanny reproduction of your voice 
reading pages of content. With such a timesaver, why bother recording?

Adding ChatGPT to Your Toolbelt
Now we get to the application both revered and reviled. ChatGPT (https://
pfdbook.link/chatgpt) exploded on the scene in late 2022. Since then, millions 
of people have typed their questions and commands (known as prompts) and 
the chatbot has given its GenAI-based answers.
ChatGPT is a juggernaut of innovation, allowing you to get a head start on various 
writing projects. ChatGPT is not always perfect, but it continues to evolve. It’s also 
controversial, with students and professionals alike being called out for acts of 
plagiarism.
Depending on how you apply it in your podcast production, ChatGPT can serve as 
an incredible timesaver in your podcasting workflow. Imagine that you’ve just 
finished recording your podcast and have used one of the applications mentioned 
earlier in this chapter or perhaps another tool to create a transcript. You can ask 
ChatGPT to create a show summary or social media entry based on the transcript 
text, as shown in Figure  14-4. Within seconds, you have an accompanying 
blogpost and several posts for Threads, Facebook, and Instagram ready to go. 
ChatGPT, thanks to a simple prompt, allows you to quickly get on with life!
Well, almost.
Remember that part about not always being perfect? Think of ChatGPT as an 
assistant — a very new assistant. We recommend that you review anything AI￾generated before making it public.
In the following steps, you create a social media post based on the transcript of 
your latest episode:
1. Create a transcript of your audio.
You can use one of the applications mentioned earlier in this chapter or 
another tool.
Well, LLMs can’t get right certain things: variety of inflection, intent, and — in many 
cases — pronunciation. Where AI excels in efficiency and productivity, it lacks in cre￾ativity and originality. The human voice is still essential in creating quality audio con￾tent. There is also a matter of authenticity, which will only grow in value the more AI 
emerges into this field.
(continued)CHAPTER 14 Podcasting and AI 245
2. Copy the text of the transcript.
3. Navigate to ChatGPT’s site at https://pfdbook.link/chatgpt.
4. In the text box at the bottom, type the following command (also referred 
to as a prompt):
Summarize this podcast transcript for a social media post explaining what was 
talked about.
5. Paste your transcript after the colon and press Enter.
In a few seconds, ChatGPT produces a few lines of text based on your 
transcript.
6. Carefully review ChatGPT’s response.
If you don’t like what you see, repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you get something 
close.
7. Copy the text from the browser window, and paste it into your blog 
software, social media site, or elsewhere.
8. Edit the text to make it sound like your own voice and to fix errors.
9. Save, post, or publish the final content.
When in doubt, return to Step 8. Read and re-read what ChatGPT creates from 
your prompt, and then craft the result to how it would sound if you were to read 
it out loud. Although ChatGPT learns your style based on its interactions with you, 
this type of intimacy doesn’t happen right away. Watch those early responses to 
your prompts carefully. Then, after a few podcast seasons are under your belt, 
watch those responses to your prompt carefully. (Yes, we’re repeating ourselves. 
You’ll find out why as you keep reading.)

Having a transcript of your podcast not only helps ChatGPT when composing 
show notes and social posts but also adds a layer of accessibility to your audio and 
video production. Now, with a clean and accurate transcript attached to your 
show, deaf and hard-of-hearing folks can follow along with the show. Addition￾ally, posting the episode’s full transcript online can help with SEO because that 
text would be highly searchable.
Experiment with different ChatGPT prompts to get different results. For example, 
if your summary was good for a blog post but too long for social media, try adding 
something like in four sentences.
PUT YOUR HAND IN THE (BLACK) BOX, 
YOUNG ATREIDES: UNDERSTANDING 
HOW ChatGPT LEARNS
While exploring the world of artificial intelligence, you might come across the term black 
box technology. In simplest terms, it’s how a majority of AI innovations are described in 
how they work. A group of computers make up a layer, where data is entered and pro￾cessed and a result is generated. These layers are referred to as the following:
• Input: Where the data is entered.
• Hidden: Where the data is run through a set of routines and processes. Basically, 
this is where the “magic” happens; and the more hidden layers you have, the more 
intense the processing and the better the results.
• Output: The results of your data being processed.
With ChatGPT, it’s unclear exactly what happens in those hidden layers. Even AI devs 
sound like The Doctor, describing what’s happening at this point as a “timey-wimey￾wibbly-wobbly” process. Hidden layers are a secret wrapped in an enigma, smothered 
in special sauce.
But as far as how ChatGPT writes its results, what we know is about as dangerous as 
the Gom Jabbar at Paul Atreides’s neck.
First, ChatGPT looks at your various prompts to learn your style of writing. The more you 
interact with it, the closer the results will sound as though you wrote them. Many AI bros 
out there will encourage you to have conversations with the app to teach it your writing 
voice. This is one way ChatGPT learns how to write desired content from your prompt.CHAPTER 14 Podcasting and AI 247
Helping AI Generate the Best Results: 
Prompt Engineering
AI works with you to create content. The AI can’t generate good content unless 
you offer the model a good prompt. Your request should be clear, concise, and as 
close as you can get to what you want, either textually or visually. To get the most 
out of your GenAI experience, you need to understand prompt engineering, an 
approach where you structure your prompt with the following elements: 
» Main subject: Is the focus of the content an object, a person, or a location? 
Lead your prompt with the main subject.
» Scene description: Is the scene indoors or out? Are you in the wilderness or 
in the Great Hall? You can be creative in setting the scene, but keep your 
description simple and concise.
» Emotional tone or atmosphere: Happy, sad, mysterious, dark? Here’s where 
you add depth to your work.
» Styles: If you’re dealing with text, you might stipulate SEO-ready or AP style. If 
you’re working with visuals, you might specify anime, photo-realistic, or a Van 
Gogh painting.
» Additional elements: For text, you might set a word limit or ask for a bulleted 
list related to your topic. Visual elements might include a lighthouse in the 
background, a storm in the distance, or a sunny day.
» Perspective: First or third person? Close-up or wide shot?
» Action: An example of a textual action is asking for a depiction of climbing a 
mountain. A visual action is walking a dog or driving a car.
» Context: Are you experiencing a dream? Are you lost in New York City? Is 
everything happening at an amusement park? The more context you can 
offer, the better.
The other way it learns how to write content for you is by scouring the internet for previ￾ously published content — content written by other people — and then generating it in 
your voice. No citations given, no sources credited, opening the door for accusations of 
plagiarism. Even if these accusations never make it to a courtroom, your reputation can 
be damaged.
If you are using ChatGPT for anything beyond simple prompts (“Write me a 200-word 
description based on this transcript. Make the summary optimized for search engines.”), 
be ready to edit, be ready to rewrite, and be ready to give credit where credit is due.248 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!

drop in keywords like video games, Destiny 2, Mass Effect, Halo, Guardians.
To practice prompt engineering, in this section you work with Leonardo.AI 
(https://pfdbook.link/leonardoai). This online app is free to the public and a 
favorite location for GenAI. You too can offer your work to the home page display 
of users’ AI-generated creations. Perhaps you can create show art for your podcast 
and its host blog.
To get started using Leonardo.AI, follow these steps:
1. Get the app:
a. Go to https://pfdbook.link/leonardoai and either create an account or 
use Google, Microsoft, or Apple to activate your account. Along with the 
browser version, mobile versions are available for iOS and Android.
b. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your username and get started. The 
screen shown in Figure 14-5 appears.
2. In the left sidebar, click Image Generation to enter creation mode.
3. In the Type a Prompt area, enter the following and then click the 
Generate button:
Space Warriors defending Earth from aliens
If you hover your cursor over the Generate button, you’ll see “This Will Use 20 
Tokens.” When you first sign up to Leonardo.AI, you start with 150 tokens. Each 
AI generation will cost you 20 tokens, but within 24 hours, your credits will

refresh to 150. You can purchase credits for more image generations and for 
other features such as image resolution changes, re-rendering, and other cool 
features.
4. Go back to the prompt field, enter the following, and then click the 
Generate button:
Space Guardians from the video game Destiny 2, standing in a post-apocalyptic 
Earth-city, armed with advanced machine guns and mystical swords, on patrol as 
hostile aliens lurk in the shadows, gritty, sunset, photorealistic, wide-shot, cinematic, 
epic, science fiction, science fantasy
5. Compare the different results from the two prompts.
The result from the original prompt, shown in Figure 14-6, left, is a simple, basic 
interpretation of your basic prompt. Not bad. However, in Figure 14-6, right, the 
result offers atmosphere, depth, and detail absent from the first prompt.
There’s also a delightful nod to Bungie’s legacy — before the game studio made 
Destiny 2, they created Halo. So yeah, we see what you did there, Leonardo.AI.
You can’t master prompt engineering overnight. You have to work with the 
prompts and their composition to unlock the potential of what AI can create in 
text, images, and — if you’re looking ahead to impressive visuals for upcoming 
productions — video and audio.
The examples in the community gallery in Leonardo.AI include the prompts that 
were used. Study these prompts and keywords to refine your attempts at prompt 
engineering. You might find a cadence and pattern to follow that will help you tap 
into what GenAI can do for you and your podcast.

The Ethics of AI
We saved the best part for last. Buckle up.
In the time it took us to write this edition, artificial intelligence has evolved into 
something better. And by the time you read this, its capabilities, efficiencies, and 
benefits will have expanded exponentially. If you ever wondered about a good fit 
for “The genie has escaped” analogy, look no further than AI.
AI can be a polarizing topic, especially in creative circles. While AI enthusiasts (or, 
as Tee calls them, AI bros) beat their chests and proclaim, “You can’t stop the 
future, Luddites!” and artists go on strike over studios considering AI as a poten￾tial solution for script generation, video production, and even actors-on-demand, 
developers continue to push boundaries without fear or forethought. Sora from 
OpenAI is the disruptor-of-the-moment at the time of this writing.
We talk a bit about Sora later.
Innovation is a beautiful thing, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of ethics. Ethics,
in its most basic definition, consists of the standards of conduct whose authority 
is determined by reason rather than custom. Practical concepts that you might 
encounter when looking at ethics include the following:
» What is good for me, and what is considered the overall social good?
» What is the relationship between what is good for me and what is good for 
society on a whole?
» What is my moral obligation to a certain concept (in this case, AI)?
» How does the free will come into play here?
» What is the real worth of positive morality in regards to innovation?
Bet you didn’t expects concepts this deep in a For Dummies book. Let’s stay on 
brand, lighten the mood, and look at the ethics of AI as it applies to one of our 
favorite episodes of the original Star Trek. Captain Kirk and Mister Spock are 
evaluating the latest creation from Dr. Richard Daystrom: the M-5 computer. 
Daystrom, who created the original computers of the Enterprise (and all the other 
vessels in Starfleet), believes he has created the next step in space exploration. 
Spock shares his evaluation of this game-changing technology with his captain:
Spock: The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have maneuvered 
her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in 
computer control.CHAPTER 14 Podcasting and AI 251
Kirk: Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. Might even be practical.
Spock: Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent 
and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them.
This is from “The Ultimate Computer” (Season 2, Episode 24), written for televi￾sion by award-winning science fiction author D.C. Fontana. It premiered in 1968, 
nearly a month before 2001: A Space Odyssey opened at the box office.
Let that marinate for a moment.
While we open the door for ribbing by summarizing our thoughts on ground￾breaking technology referencing the same series that brought us some of the most 
cringe-worthy moments in science fiction (“Miri” and “Spock’s Brain” — we’re 
looking at you), Star Trek gets it right with this episode. “The Ultimate Computer” 
is prophetic in not only the motivation behind M-5 but how Kirk questions 
whether M-5 is the good thing that Daystrom and Starfleet make it out to be. Even 
Forbes (https://pfdbook.link/forbes) pointed out in 2011 how well the episode 
dealt with the implications (and potential dangers) of AI.
Ethical AI, though, is not drawing proverbial lines in the technological sand. It’s a 
discipline and an approach to AI that asks difficult questions, and what makes it 
even more difficult to implement is that everyone involved in an AI-driven project 
must be on board with how AI is applied and how far it’s implemented.
For example, suppose you’re using Hindenburg PRO with your podcast. Is it 
unethical to have Hindenburg PRO create a manuscript from your podcast? 
Certainly not. While it does replace the work a human would undertake as a 
transcriber, you still need someone to review it for accuracy. What about the easy 
corrections when unexpected mistakes pop up? Is there a breach of ethics in edit￾ing the text and updating the audio without the voice artist being present? Nope. 
It’s all good and aboveboard, provided the voice actor understands that pick-ups
(the quick re-recording of certain lines if a mistake occurs) are covered. If 
everyone involved is good with that, you’re still ethically solid.
But let’s say Chuck, without Tee’s permission, fed ElevenLabs hours of Tee’s voice 
and then created a bumper for Technorama, saying “This is Tee Morris, and when 
it comes to podcasts, nothing beats Technorama!” Hey, it’s not even 30 seconds 
and Tee’s a friend of both the podcast and Chuck. No big deal, right? Well, the fact 
that it was without Tee’s permission is a double-whammy of unethical applica￾tion, even if it turned out that Tee would have agreed to it. Another consideration 
is that Tee didn’t record a word of it, but it’s his voice. What else could we get Tee 
to say? What if, using ElevenLabs, Chuck writes an essay or an editorial and feeds 
their AI Tee’s voice to create a full podcast with his voice?
This is when the slope gets particularly slippery.252 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
COME WITH ME AND YOU’LL BE IN 
A WORLD OF AI GENERATION!
In February 2024, an ambitious special-events vendor calling itself The House of 
Illuminati announced their premiere of Willy’s Chocolate Experience. The website (now 
offline) featured GenAI artwork (like the one pictured here) promising a fully immersive 
experience of fun and imagination for the entire family. Much in the same vein of 
Doctor Who, Harry Potter, and the works of Vincent Van Gogh, audiences would lose 
themselves in the wild and wonderful world inspired by Willy Wonka, Golden Tickets, 
and (of course) chocolate.
The event opened and, shortly after, went viral. For all the wrong reasons.
The event — much like its marketing — featured GenAI in every aspect. Photo opportu￾nity backdrops were the same surreal GenAI artwork as featured on the website. The 
scripts, according to Paul Connell, cast as the Wonka-inspired lead Willy McDuff, were 
“15 pages of AI-generated gibberish” (https://pfdbook.link/wce). Actress Kirsty 
Paterson, the sad oompa-loompa photographed in an ill-equipped candy lab, told 
Vulture, “When I got the script the night before I was like, ‘Oh, this is not . . .’ I kind of CHAPTER 14 Podcasting and AI 253
AI is a helpful tool for detecting errors and making minor corrections, creating a 
transcript from your production, and drafting a summary of your podcast and its 
many episodes. AI is a fantastic timesaver for leveling audio, detecting sync points 
in video, assisting you in creating a multicamera setup, and generating SEO key￾words that you can use to help your podcast appear in the top results of search 
engines. Can AI create an entire episode based on a script and a voice sample you 
give it? Yes. But remember, just because you can do a thing, doesn’t mean you 
should do a thing  — especially without permission. Using your own material 
wherever possible is best, but creating content with AI comes at a severe risk 
because AI learns by using other people’s material as its source. Ethics should 
always be regarded when AI is utilized in content creation.
Particularly unsettling are the AI innovators themselves barreling forward while 
AI bros cheer them on from the sidelines and boardrooms where deals are made. 
In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, the chief technology officer of 
OpenAI, Mira Mirati, was more than happy to celebrate the rollout of Sora, a GenAI 
app that could create high-resolution video from a simple prompt. The interview 
(https://pfdbook.link/sora) was progressing at a good pace, and it looked like 
Mirati and OpenAI had achieved another amazing milestone — until WSJ’s Joanna 
Stern asked a more-than-fair question:
Stern: What data was used to train Sora?
Mirati: We used publicly available data and licensed data.
Stern: So, videos on YouTube?
Mirati: I’m actually not sure about that.
Stern: Okay. Videos from Facebook, Instagram?
thought it was AI-generated” (https://pfdbook.link/vulture). While House of 
Illuminati’s sole proprietor, Billy Coull, insisted that GenAI was not used for the event’s 
script, the BBC discovered in 2023 that Coull had listed 17 self-published novels on 
Amazon, all released within the same month. An Amazon review described one of his 
titles as having “all the hallmarks of being written by AI.”
And to top off all this: Not a bit of chocolate to be found anywhere.
If you want a look at unethical AI in practice or AI without regulations or restrictions, the 
stories surrounding Willy’s Chocolate Experience offer a case study. Without ethics in 
place, AI is no longer an innovation disrupting business as we know it but a train wreck 
of great ideas in the hands of people who have no clue how to see a creative work to its 
final release. It’s essential to regard AI as less of a creative resource and more as a tool 
to help creative people fine-tune what they’ve made from inspiration to fruition.254 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
Mirati: You know, if they were publicly available, publicly available to use, there 
might be the data, but I’m not sure. I’m not confident about it.
Stern: What about Shutterstock? I know you guys have a deal with them.
Mirati: I’m just not going to go into the details of the data that was used, but it was 
publicly available data or licensed data.
Publicly available data covers a lot of ground. How ethical would it be to train an AI 
model using several YouTube podcasts? How would you feel if you — a content 
creator — saw an AI-generated advertisement featuring your face? Did you give 
permission for this? While your video is available to the public on YouTube, does 
that mean anyone can re-create your likeness for their production without your 
permission or without compensation to you?
With concerns of deep fakes, misinformation, and misrepresentation online, 
ethics is not a luxury but a necessity. Mirati saying that she is not sure about the 
details in the data used to train AI doesn’t satisfy those whose ethics could 
potentially be violated — and it isn’t a good look, especially when your title is 
chief technology officer.
Ethics will always ask the tough questions when it comes to AI. When those blindly 
pushing AI state, “AI solutions will free up time for creative tasks” it will be the 
ethical folks who ask, “What exactly does that mean?” or “Like what?” We’ve 
heard that AI will allow us humans to engage in more interesting pursuits. We’ve 
also heard that sentiment before, just phrased a little differently:
“You’re frightened because you can’t understand it. I’m going to show you. 
I’m going to show all of you. It takes four hundred thirty people to man a 
starship. With this, you don’t need anyone. One machine can do all those 
things they send men out to do now. Men no longer need die in space or on 
some alien world. Men can live and go on to achieve greater things.”

Podcasting on YouTube
I
n its first year, podcasting established itself as an exciting audio option. It was 
truly “The People’s Radio” for your computer, promising a fresh alternative to 
cookie-cutter corporate radio. A few innovative podcasters, though, took a 
closer look at the way RSS 2.0 worked and thought, “Wait a second — if we can do 
this with audio, what about video?” These brave few decided to put moving 
pictures to their podcasts, and video podcasting came to be.
With YouTube now recognizing podcasts and even offering their own directory for 
podcasters, video might be a viable platform for your show. Working with video 
isn’t easy but can be just as rewarding as working with audio. In this chapter, you 
learn about the video component that podcasting offers producers everywhere, set 
yourself up on YouTube, and work with an editing program to create your first 
video podcast.
A Hostile Welcome: The Demands of Video
“A Hostile Welcome” might come across as an imposing title for this section, but 
after working with video for three decades and some change, we can state that it’s 
accurate. While video presents incredible possibilities for podcasters of all levels,

anyone new to the medium discovers quickly that video production is not easy. At 
all. Following are some of the challenges to working with video:
» The learning curve: Despite what the commercials for laptops insinuate, 
editing video is not and never has been a push-button technology. A lot goes 
into video, even at the most basic level. And even with years of content 
creation, you can still learn about other essential skills, such as adjustment 
layers, multicam editing, and opening title templates from third-party vendors.
» More production resources: With audio, the aim is to create the cleanest, 
most polished auditory experience. When you work in video, as shown in 
Figure 15-1, you have a lot more to contend with than just unwanted noise 
pollution. Now you wrestle with lighting, camera angles, wardrobe, make-up, 
and more. Editing also proves more difficult because timing now has a visual 
aspect. In YouTube videos, jump cuts (going from one scene or camera angle 
to another without a transition) are common and the technique is a timesaver 
while editing. But is it professional? Debatable, at best. Video demands time, 
attention, and patience.
FIGURE 15-1:
Video production 
entails working 
with factors such 
as lighting, 
wardrobe, 
location, and 
camera angles.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 257
» Episode frequency: The added demands of production make posting new 
content a challenge. Even a biweekly posting schedule poses an incredible 
undertaking with casting, pre-production, filming, editing, and post-production — 
while maintaining a day job that is probably financing your ambitious production. 
And if your cast and crew are volunteers, even a monthly posting schedule 
can be daunting. Count on your editing crew in the early stages of your video 
podcasting to be a crew of one: You. If you’re not proficient in editing, producing 
an episode may take longer than you think.
A buffer of episodes you’ve already edited and have ready to post is essential 
when working with video. Before launching your podcast, have two to three 
months’ worth of video episodes in the can, ready to post. While that might 
sound extreme, you’ll find that cushion valuable when working with video.
» Audio or nothing: Some apps and platforms will not approve your feed if you 
feature video episodes. Spotify syndicates only certain video podcast feeds. 
(Think the top of Spotify’s podcasting food chain, and you’ll understand what 
certain entails.) So while video is tempting in many ways, you may create 
content that goes unseen.
OH, YOU TEASE!
We don’t deny that video can take a lot longer to record, edit, and upload than its 
audio-only counterpart. But you can also make quick, short videos to promote your 
podcast, whether it’s audio or video! Many podcasters have turned to services like 
Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts to make short vignettes, or teasers, to promote 
a show with a larger production. While at your favorite convention, expo, or weekend 
event, you may find yourself gathering interviews or some other footage for your regu￾lar show. Take a few minutes to tell your audience what you’re working on. Grab your 
mobile phone and do a quick broadcast, or put together a 1-minute moment that offers 
a sneak peek as to what you have planned for your next creative project (like this con￾versation Tee is having with his studio mascot, Benedick the GamerCat, during a tense 
moment in The Last of Us).

for 1 minute of HD video. And you want to create a 15-minute video episode. 
“How do I get my file size smaller?” podcasters ask on various discussion 
boards about video. The reply — “Make a shorter episode” — may come 
across as snarky, but it’s the only solution. The saying “You can’t fit 25 pounds 
of sugar into a 5-pound bag” applies to video production, as well.
» Bandwidth demands: Bandwidth, especially if your podcast is 500MB per 
episode (and remember, that’s 10 minutes of video), can be costly. If you 
launch a podcast with 1,000 listeners, for example, you’ve gone through 
50GB of bandwidth for that one episode. If you find an additional 2,000 
subscribers in your second week, you’ll potentially burn well over 1TB of 
your monthly bandwidth within your first two weeks. What about the 
weeks — and the listeners — to come? What does your web host offer, 
and can it handle this kind of traffic for your podcast?CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 259
A majority of video podcasting still manages to occur in various resolutions, run￾ning times, and production quality levels, most of them backed by major studios 
or production houses with healthy budgets. Some innovative filmmakers are cre￾ating amazing productions with shoestring budgets, but these podcasts are few 
and far between.
YouTube: We’re Here to Help
In 2005, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim founded what was to become 
the home of video content on the internet: YouTube. From the humble beginnings 
above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California, YouTube 
started with user clips limited to 100 megabytes and 30 seconds of footage. By 
December 2005, within the year of their official launch, the site received 8 million 
views a day. In 2024, nearly 20 years later, YouTube was receiving an estimated 
5 billion views a day, generating nearly $30 billion in revenue per year.
If you were wondering why there’s a chapter in this book about podcasting on 
YouTube, there it is.
YouTube is now powered by Google, and when you couple the world’s largest 
resource for video content with the most powerful search engine on the internet, 
you have an incredible ally for you and your desire to add a video component to 
your podcast.
In July 2022, YouTube introduced a podcast directory in response to user feedback 
and the growing popularity of podcasters who add video to their once audio-only 
production. This dedicated page for podcasts is shown in Figure 15-2. Podcasting 
as a platform was now media being delivered to you on a (usually free) subscrip￾tion system. When people subscribe to a podcast, they receive a notification on 
their computer, mobile device, or media center that new episodes are ready.
If you have a Gmail account, good news: You have a YouTube account. But more 
importantly, does your podcast have a YouTube account? If not, follow these steps:
1. Go to https://pfdbook.link/google and click the Create Account 
button.
2. Click Personal.
You have two options for creating an account: Personal and Business. The 
business account requires that you set up a business profile. You can choose 
to do this later. For now, keep it simple and create a personal account on 
Google.260 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
3. For the account contact, enter your name or your podcast’s title.
This is a personal preference.
4. For the account username, enter your podcast’s title.
5. Create a password or a passphrase and confirm it.
While passwords should be difficult to crack but easy to remember, passphrases 
are now recommended by cybersecurity experts as upping the difficulty level for 
being hacked. Passphrases involve more characters, so if you take something easy 
like “I am a podcaster” and rework it as “!am@p0dcasteR” for your password field, 
you’ve created a very strong passphrase that meets the criteria of many platforms.
6. Enter a phone number, preferably a mobile number.
If you need to verify your login to your Gmail or YouTube account, your phone 
will be an option for receiving notifications from Google. This is to be sure that 
only you or your trusted associates are logging into the account.
7. After reviewing the terms of service and the privacy policy, click Next to 
complete the process.
You’ve set up a Google account, which automatically sets up your YouTube account. 
You can personalize your account with a profile picture (preferably your podcast’s 
logo), personal details, and additional safeguards to protect your data.
You can now go to YouTube (https://pfdbook.link/youtube) and start filling in 
the blanks of your account, more commonly referred to as a channel. Create a 
sharp-looking banner across the top, fill in the details behind the profile, and lay 
down the foundations of your YouTube channel like the channel featured in 
Figure 15-3. To find out how to make a channel feel more personal, read YouTube 
Channels For Dummies by Rob Ciampa, Theresa Go, Matt Ciampa, and Rich Murphy.

Setting yourself up on the YouTube Podcasts directory is easy. However, now you 
need to upload some content.
Adding the Video Element: Creating 
a Podcast for YouTube
Now that you’ve created your YouTube channel, you have to decide how you 
will bring video into your audio-centric podcast. For now, all you need are the 
following:
» A video-editing program, such as DaVinci Resolve, Blender, Apple iMovie, 
or Adobe Premiere Pro
» A plan
Keeping it simple: Introducing video 
to an audio podcast
The entry-level approach for podcasts on YouTube is to place your show’s logo on 
the video track from beginning to end, and use that as your video component. 
Easy, simple, and . . . dull as ditchwater.
FIGURE 15-3:

Yes, it’s the easiest way of getting your audio on YouTube, but this quick-and￾dirty approach will have a limited shelf-life with a YouTube audience. It would be 
nice to have something to look at. So let’s go and give this video some extra flair:
1. Launch your video-editing software.
Many applications are available to help you edit and produce video. For this 
chapter, we work with Adobe Premiere Pro. These steps might be a little 
different if you’re not using Adobe Premiere, but the basics should be 
the same.
2. Create a project, and import your podcast episode and a folder of several 
images related to your project.
In Chapter 8 we talk about royalty-free music for your podcast. Membership to 
services such as Envato Elements may also offer access to royalty-free images 
(and video!) that you can use in your video.
3. Drag the podcast audio from your Project window to your timeline 
window, and release it on the audio track.
For this exercise, we use a 16-minute episode.
4. Go to the folder of images you imported and drag-and-drop one of the 
photos to the beginning of the video track.
Your video editor should offer ways for you to scale your photo to fill the 
screen, if necessary.
5. Grab the end point of the photo you just dropped onto the video track, 
and drag it.
To follow along with the example, drag the end point so that the duration of 
the photo is close to 3 minutes, as shown in Figure 15-4. Different video editors 
have different ways of lengthening a still image or a block of text, but many 
support a simple drag-and-drop process.
FIGURE 15-4:
You can lengthen 
the running time 
of a clip to a 
duration you 
need for your 
project.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 263
6. Go to the folder of images and drag another photo to the end point of the 
previous photo.
7. Grab the end point of this new photo, and drag it so the duration of the 
photo is close to 3 minutes.
8. From the Transitions folder, click and drag Dissolve to the meeting point 
of the two images.
Dissolve (or fade) is a simple transition from one image to the other. You 
should have a variety of transitions at your disposal. Feel free to play around 
with them accordingly.
9. Repeat Steps 4 to 8 until you reach the end of your podcast.
The last image of your podcast should be the show’s logo.
10. Choose File  ➪   Save to save your work.
11. Choose File  ➪   Export  ➪   Media to create your video content.
You now have a video track of related images running the length of your 
podcast. Kind of cool, huh?
You’ve added a basic video component to your podcast and are ready to upload the 
episode to your YouTube account. But what if you want to do something with a bit 
more polish? Something that puts you right up there with the professionals? That 
requires a little more planning and a lot more resources. But the result will be 
incredibly awesome.
Pro-level video podcasting: Working with 
a multicam setup in Adobe Premiere
To see a multi-clip, or multicam, setup, look at Ghosts & Grit with Jack Osbourne. 
Jack Osbourne, the son of the Prince of Darkness himself, Ozzy Osbourne, has an 
incredible story to tell. On Ghosts & Grit, he shares that story: a passion for mixed 
martial arts, mental health awareness, pop culture, and what he is now known 
for  — paranormal investigation. It’s a simple setup: one camera on Jack and 
another on his guest. While Ghosts & Grit is available as a podcast on various plat￾forms such as Spotify and Apple, it’s also on YouTube.
How hard is it to make a podcast that looks like this? Here’s what you need: 
» Two cameras, preferably the same make and model
» Adequate lighting for you and your guest
» A clean(ish?) set264 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
» Both you and your guest looking presentable (nice wardrobe, hair styled, and 
so on)
» A digital recorder or a mixer to record the mic audio from your host and guest
Don’t worry about syncing camera and audio. You do that shortly. At the end of 
your recording session, you should have the following:
» Camera 1 (host) with audio and video
» Camera 2 (guest) with audio and video
» Master audio of both host and guest, balanced if possible
Now launch Adobe Premiere Pro. It’s time to get to work:
1. Create a new project and import your podcast from camera 1, camera 2, 
and the master audio.
2. In the Project window, select the camera 1 clip, the camera 2 clip, and the 
master audio.
3. Do the following:
a. Right-click any clip and select Create Multi-Clip Camera Source Sequence. You 
will then see the Create Multi-Camera Source Sequence window, seen in 
Figure 15-5.
b. Set the Sync Point to Audio — Track 1.
c. For Camera Names, select Enumerate Cameras.
The Multi-Clip Camera Source Sequence uses an artificial intelligence algorithm 
to sync your master audio with the video of your two cameras. If this is the first 
time you’re taking advantage of the multicam feature of Premiere, congratula￾tions on using AI in your production. To read more about AI and podcasting, 
see Chapter 14.
4. Go to the Program window and make sure the toggle multicam view icon 
(shown in the margin) is on.
5. Go to the Project window and find the multicam clip you just created. 
Right-click the clip and select New Sequence from Clip from the menu.
The sequence created from the multi-clip appears as one track of video and 
one track of audio. As shown in Figure 15-6, the left side contains the available 
sources for your sequence. The right side is your sequence-in-progress, where 
you can see which camera you’re currently trained on.
6. Begin the playback of your podcast by clicking the play icon in the 
Program window.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 265

7. When you’re ready to change camera angles, click the desired camera in 
the left section of your Program window. When you want to change 
angles again, click the other offered camera.
If you click between camera angles and then stop playback, the moments you 
clicked appear in the timeline window as edit points in the sequence.
You can fine-tune the timing of any edit point by using the rolling edit tool 
(shown in the margin), which allows you to move an edit point earlier or 
later in a sequence.
8. Repeat Step 7 until you’ve finished reviewing the podcast.
Your sequence is now roughly edited.
If you find out that you’re on an angle you don’t want to be on, right-click in the 
sequence on the clip featuring that unwanted camera angle, and locate the 
Multi-Camera option in the offered menu. Select the camera you want to jump 
to, and the clip will switch to the desired angle.
9. Save you work by pressing Ctrl+S (Windows) or ⌘ +S (Mac).
10. To process your video for presentation, press Ctrl+M (Windows) or 
⌘ +M (Mac).
Multicam editing takes your production to a professional level and is an incredible 
timesaver when working with multiple camera sources. It may take some practice 
before you become proficient, but it’s worth the effort.
GET ON MY LAWN: THE EASE OF 
PODCASTING WITH STREAMYARD
When we describe recording a video element to your podcast, we make the bold 
assumption that everyone involved in your podcast — your co-hosts or potential 
guests — is in your home studio. However, some guests, especially subject matter 
experts, might not be able to come to your place and record.
Enter Streamyard (https://pfdbook.link/streamyard), which captures incom￾ing audio from the sources you establish on their website. You and the contributor 
at the remote location connect your video and audio settings with the Streamyard 
server. Although Streamyard sounds no different than a Zoom call, it enables you to 
brand content with logos, incorporate pre-recorded clips (such as intros, outros, and 
segues for segments in your podcast), separate audio files (for post-production mix￾ing), and create automatic recordings made available immediately for downloading. 
Streamyard offers many of the perks of in-studio recording with the capability to 
connect anywhere in the world, Wi-Fi permitting.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 267
You can see a two-camera setup and its results in Jack Osbourne’s paranormal 
podcast, Ghosts & Grit. Being able to jump from angle to angle breaks up the mono￾tony of a single-camera setup and can even increase the pace of your podcast.
For additional camera setups and ideas, look at the three-camera setup in Viva la 
Dirt League’s We Were Told We Should Do a Podcast. Each host has their own camera, 
and the editing in this podcast is quick, clean, and polished. Video productions, 
though, are not always limited to two or three cameras. VLDL’s other YouTube 
channel, Viva la Dirt League D&D, features Adventures in Azerim and The Misfits. In 
their gaming productions, VLDL’s setup includes the following:
» Camera 1 (Robert Hartley, Dungeon Master)
» Camera 2 (one side of the table, featuring two actors)
» Camera 3 (another side of the table, featuring two actors)
» Camera 4 (elevated camera focused on the gaming table)
» Camera 5 (wide shot of table, DM, and all actors)
» Master audio (the DM and party members are all mic’d)
The results are incredible, and time flies by as you watch the players’ reactions to 
whatever Rob throws at them.
With each additional camera, keep in mind the additional demands for lighting 
and sound. Start simple with your video and then see how you can improve your 
production.
If you decide to work with a multicam setup, make sure your cameras are the same 
make and model. Mixing different models will result in varying results because 
not all camera optics are the same. Are there ways to correct this in post￾production? Possibly, but it may not be perfect and will require more time.
You may notice that the longer your podcast, the longer it takes for your video 
editor to process the video. The amount of RAM and processing power dictate how 
quickly the processing will take. Tee’s laptop, for example, is running a 2GHz 
Quad-Core Intel Core i5 and 16GB of RAM. If he’s creating a 5-minute video, the 
processing time can take between 30 and 60 minutes. Processing a 30- to 
40-minute production, with multiple tracks of video and audio and incorporated 
effects, can take 3 to 4 hours. When it comes to your usual posting time, remem￾ber to allocate time for the processing of video.
Now that your file is processed and ready for posting, it’s time to make your 
podcast happen on YouTube.268 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
Crossing the Finish Line: Taking Your 
Podcast to YouTube
YouTube channel all polished and prepared for visitors? Check. Media created for 
uploading? Check.
Now, here’s the thing to know about uploading and walking away from a video on 
YouTube. You really can’t do that anymore. A good amount of work goes into let￾ting people know something about your podcast.
Tell us about yourself: The Details window
You’re about to upload your video file to the YouTube servers. Once it’s there, it 
has to be processed for both standard and high-definition playback. This process￾ing is unlike the processing we did in Adobe Premiere. In YouTube, the processing 
creates a uniform format that people can play on any computer from any location.
And that’s okay because as your video processes, you’re going to work through 
other details that need attention. For each post on YouTube, you should complete 
the following:
» Title
» Description
» Thumbnail promoting your video
» Which playlist will feature your video
» Tags for search engines
» Category for your video
» Scheduling time for your video to go live
The better you complete these details, the easier it will be for Google and YouTube 
to find your production.
You begin the process by uploading your video and walking through the various 
steps needed to make sure you appear properly in YouTube.
1. Go to YouTube (https://pfdbook.link/youtube), single-click the create 
icon, located in the upper-right corner (and shown in the margin), and 
select Upload Video.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 269
2. Either drag-and-drop your video to the window, or click Select Files and 
find and select your media on your computer.
The Details window appears.
3. In the Title field, replace the file title with the title you want for your 
podcast episode.
You can reuse the podcast title for your YouTube entry or create a more 
SEO-friendly title. For organization and consistency, it’s best to use the same 
title here as you used for the audio-only entry.
4. In the Description field, enter a brief description of your episode (seen in 
Figure 15-7).
To be consistent, use parts of your show notes here.
Many of the fields in the Details window have character limitations, so if your 
original entry has too many characters, you may have to edit it to fit. URLs 
relevant to your podcast episode are best shared here.
We skip the Thumbnail option for now. Later, we describe the details to 
consider when creating a thumbnail.

5. Under Playlists, choose Select  ➪   New Playlist  ➪   New Podcast.
The Create a New Playlist dialog appears.
6. Enter your podcast’s title, its description, and even its show art here.
7. Click Create to create this playlist and place your episode in it.
Podcasts are designated by a special tag in the listing of playlists on your 
channel.
8. In the Audience section, determine whether or not the podcast is 
appropriate for kids, and then click Show More.
9. Under Tags, come up with search terms (tags) relevant to your podcast 
episode.
When you’ve typed one tag, press Enter before creating the next. Repeat 
this process until you are close to or have reached the limit, which is 
500 characters.
Tags are the terms you expect YouTube users to enter when searching. Tags 
are one of the most important details about your podcast to complete.
Coming up with good tags can be difficult, so we recommend turning to 
ChatGPT to suggest keywords. To find out how ChatGPT can help you with 
relevant keywords as well as episode summaries and more, see Chapter 14.
10. Under Category, choose the option appropriate to your podcast.
11. Review the screen for additional details to add. When you’re ready, click 
the Next button.
One page down. You’ve completed the toughest part of the YouTube listing. Next, 
you simply copy and paste the show notes portion of your podcast into YouTube.
Adding more to your podcast: 
Video elements
With the Details screen completed, you’re taken to the Video Elements screen. 
Video elements are little additions to your video that help people navigate your 
channel or invite them to visit other relevant podcasters on YouTube. On this 
screen, you can add the following to your video production:
» Subtitles: YouTube can provide automatic closed captioning for your 
production. If the quality of the subtitles aren’t to your liking, you can edit 
them or provide your own. The subtitles can be presented in another 
language but you’ll want to make sure any foreign language translation is 
using the proper grammar.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 271
» End screen: Many YouTube creators end their productions as shown in 
Figure 15-8, with a subscribe button and a suggested video where people can 
find out more about their channel or interests. The end screen option here 
offers a few templates as well as action items for viewers.
» Cards: If someone is viewing YouTube on a desktop or laptop computer, a 
card can slide out at the top corner of the screen, encouraging the viewer to 
see what you, the video producer, recommend for further viewing. If you want 
to offer your audience a few action items while viewing your podcast, consider 
using cards. And after you do, click Next to move on.
Making sure you’re above board: Checks
From their first year online to the present, YouTube has tangled with creators over 
the issue of copyright. Who has permission to share comedy, music, and charac￾ters and settings? Even lawyers on YouTube (like the Legal Eagle himself) have 
stepped into this discussion and explained repeatedly what is and is not protected 
under satire, fair use, and other arguments.
YouTube is not taking any chances. The next window you see after clicking Next is 
the Checks window. The algorithms at YouTube and Google check that your video 
content is being used correctly and with permissions in place. Sometimes, you 
may receive a warning stating that you’re using content for which the artist grants 
FIGURE 15-8:

permission. Other times, there may be a copyright that prevents you from mon￾etizing the video. Investigate the issue and decide whether you want to re-edit the 
video, re-upload the fixed video, and re-enter all that you’ve just entered. (Oye!) 
Or, if you’re not interested in monetizing this video, you can let it slide.
This is YouTube’s final check to make sure that you (and the platform) are doing 
everything in your power to abide by copyright laws.
If everything looks good here, click that Next button one more time.
Drop it like it’s HAWT: Publishing your video
You’re one click away from making your podcast live on YouTube. At the bottom 
right of the Visibility window, the Next button now reads Publish. When you click 
that, you’ll be all set (because, at this point, your video has probably finished pro￾cessing). YouTube will list your podcast in their directory, and your content will be 
available as a video component.
We know you want to click that Publish button, but give us just a few more ticks.
The Visibility window is more than just going live with your episode. This is where 
you set up whether you want your video to be seen immediately or go live at a later 
date. Here’s a breakdown of what Visibility offers:
» Private: If you’re working with a group of people who have a say in how your 
final podcast runs, you might want to let them review the podcast before 
making it live to the public. Setting a video to private restricts who can view it. 
You must manually enter email addresses to generate invites to the people 
for whom you want to grant access to your video.
» Unlisted: Setting the visibility to unlisted prevents the public from knowing 
the podcast is there. Invites are not required — you can share the link to 
anyone you like. Just keep in mind that they can also share the link.
» Schedule: If you’ve followed our advice and built a buffer of video content, 
you may want to time the release of your audio and video podcasts simulta￾neously. In the Schedule section, you can time both your audio and video 
media to go live at the same time. Before the video goes public, it will remain 
private, meaning only you and your crew can watch it before it goes live.
» Set as Premiere: This option is a fantastic dipping-of-the-toe into the waters 
of going live with a studio audience. Set a date and time a week or two in 
advance to give people notice that you’re hosting a premiere. You can also set 
up your premiere with a countdown clock, building the hype to the video’s 
launch. Build anticipation for the premiere by circulating a link that takes CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 273
people to the video on YouTube, as shown in Figure 15-9. YouTube automati￾cally uses the thumbnail you created for the video as poster art. From here, 
viewers can be notified when the video is about to go live. When it does, a 
chat window appears to the right of the video so you can interact with others 
during the premiere.
And then, of course, there’s the option to make your video public, right here and 
right now. But before you make your video live, look at Figure 15-9 again. See the 
artwork? Hold on a minute! Your thumbnail is still set on the default that YouTube 
thought you’d want to use, right? Yeah. We should have a look at that.
Grabbing attention: The art 
of the thumbnail
In this section, we describe what goes into creating an eye-catching thumbnail. 
Rather than simply choosing a freeze frame from the episode, you should think 
about what your thumbnail says at a glance about your YouTube video. Although 
the value of thumbnails continues to be a subject of speculation and debate by 
YouTube legends, we’ve noticed that these same people still put a lot of thought 
into their thumbnails. So as passionately as some argue that thumbnails don’t 
matter, we believe that spending a little time with this final detail is worthwhile.
FIGURE 15-9:
Setting up a 
premiere allows 
you to hype your 
upcoming video.274 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
The real question on everyone’s content-creating mind is what makes a good 
thumbnail?
» Size: Low-resolution images do not cut it for thumbnails. A thumbnail must be 
1280 x 720 pixels. The image can’t exceed 10MB for podcasts, so try to keep 
the image compression as economical and efficient as possible.
» Formatting: Your thumbnail should be a JPG or PNG. GIFs are allowed but 
rarely resize properly. For your podcast playlist, the thumbnail should have an 
aspect ratio of 1:1; your episodes can still be the 16:9 aspect ratio used in 
YouTube players and previews.
» Faces: Apparently, the lizard part of the brain reacts positively to faces. We’ve 
seen thumbnails that go for subtlety, and we’ve seen some that resemble the 
animations of Chuck Jones. We’re still working on this aspect of creating a 
solid thumbnail.
» Stunning scenery: It helps to have an eye-catching background. Are you 
chatting about specific celebrities in your podcast? They can be in the 
background or the foreground, with your face looking from the side. Or you 
can go for atmosphere. If you’re talking about historic events, find a public 
domain image, but then apply a filter to give the photo a mysterious glow.
» Brevity is the soul of wit: Keep the text on the thumbnail brief and simple. 
Grab your audience with a catchy headline and a typeface that’s chunky 
enough to pop against your backdrop.
» Scalability: Your thumbnail should look balanced from a design point of view 
in its full size but also readable and discernible when scaled down for mobile 
devices and smaller resolutions, such as the sidebar directories featured 
throughout YouTube.
The secret sauce behind a good thumbnail is subject to debate and subject to 
change. Tee found a good amount of traffic on his Five Minute Paranormal with the 
thumbnail featured in Figure  15-10. Having KallMeKris and CelinaSpookyBoo 
flanking his own skeptical expression helped, as did following the preceding tips.
Using the preceding list as a guide, create something in your favorite graphics 
program that you think best captures the mood and the feel of your video episode. 
The examples in Figures 15-9 and 15-10 might provide an idea of the direction 
you’ll want to follow in making a thumbnail for your video.CHAPTER 15 Podcasting on YouTube 275
You’ll quickly decide if you love or hate working with video. For us, video is a rich, 
deep, and incredibly cool playground where an idea takes form in front of us. Sure, 
that happens when working with audio. And it can sometimes be a lot easier to 
explore the galaxy or dive into the depths of a dungeon with audio alone. But with 
practice, you can expand your creative reach with video and put together amazing 
projects. Start by keeping it simple, and then challenge yourself.

One Giant Leap for 
Podcasting: Live 
Streaming Content
Mutation: It is the key to our evolution. It has enabled us to evolve from a 
single-celled organism into the dominant species on the planet. This process 
is slow, and normally taking thousands and thousands of years. But every few 
hundred millennia, evolution leaps forward.
— PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER, X-MEN (2000)
When you read the preceding quote, you can hear Sir Patrick Stewart’s 
voice, right? Or is that just us?
We open with that prologue to the original X-Men film because the same thing can 
be said about podcasting as well as streaming, the topic of this chapter. To under￾stand how streaming affects podcasting, it helps to look at how podcasting first 
dabbled with video, including live podcasting.

Going Live
Live podcasting in the early years (pre-2010), audio or video, was unreliable and 
dependent on your computer’s processing power. Even with cutting-edge hard￾ware, results were not always as expected. Live events on the internet were 
reserved for production companies with deep pockets, and only those with high￾performance computers could watch and interact with the hosts. It was, for a 
time, a technology only for the elite.
Then, in the summer of 2011, Emmett Shear of Justin.tv led a spin-off of the plat￾form focusing on video games, allowing gamers to broadcast their gaming live on 
the internet. This spin-off was called Twitch (https://pfdbook.link/twitch), 
pictured in Figure 16-1, and remains the go-to definition of streaming, where data 
compression rates, bandwidth, and ISP upload and download rates strike a bal￾ance and offer an opportunity for anyone to stream live content. Today, Twitch is 
returning to its roots with streams featuring everyday life, special events, cooking 
classes, and yes — podcasting.
A less technical definition of streaming is a platform offering consumption or 
broadcasting of content, either time-shifted or in real time, on a global platform. 
(Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?) With the development of broadband and technology 
able to handle robust data streams, streaming services now offer audiences and 
content creators broadcast-quality entertainment online. In recent years, other 
streaming platforms have gone live and are now popular with content creators of 
all backgrounds:
» YouTube (https://pfdbook.link/youtube): Powered by Google, YouTube
was the original hub for creative video works. As discussed in Chapter 15, with 
FIGURE 16-1:
Twitch.tv offers 
podcasters a 
platform to 
connect with 
listeners and 
interact with 
them in real time.CHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 279
the capability to stream either directly from your smartphone or mobile 
device, or from a studio in your home or office, YouTube made streaming 
original content (including a recording of your podcast) possible.
» Facebook Live and Facebook Gaming (https://pfdbook.link/facebook):
In August 2015, Facebook launched Facebook Live, a streaming platform fully 
integrated with the largest social media platform in the world. Facebook Live 
notifies your network when you go live, offering a tiny inset video in the lower 
corner of your app or browser window that takes you to the stream with a 
single click. Facebook Gaming, a variation of Facebook Live, grants viewers the 
ability to interact with gamers, similar to Twitch.
» Instagram Live (https://pfdbook.link/instagram): Known for its 
“captured in the moment” photo galleries, Instagram launched their live video 
platform in August 2020. Fully integrated with the app, IG Live sends a quick 
notification that you are live and streaming to everyone in your Instagram 
(and Facebook) network.
You may want to launch a streaming channel to introduce a live element to your 
podcasts, or you may want to introduce a video component to your production. 
The simplest reason to stream content, though, is that it’s just plain fun! 
Tee began his own Twitch channel in September 2017 (https://twitch.tv/
theteemonster), and through all the breaks, changes, and modest numbers he’s 
seen since, he still relishes the moment he goes live, as shown in Figure 16-2.
All this is interesting, you’re probably thinking, but this is a book on podcasting. 
What does livestreaming have to do with podcasting? Well, after years of working 
in content creation, we’ve found a relationship between podcasting and 
FIGURE 16-2:
Tee takes his love 
of ghost hunting, 
cooking, and 
video gaming 
(especially with 
friends like Steve 
Saylor) to his own

streaming, especially in how you can streamline your workflow in creating an 
episode. So how do you stream content? More importantly, how do you record a 
podcast on a stream?
Good news: If you’re streaming, you already did most of the hard work.
Setting up a Streaming Account
In this chapter, we make the bold assumption that you have set up your podcast￾ing studio and are ready to record video. To get started on this adventure in 
streaming content, you need the following:
» Camera (or multiple cameras) installed
» An active account on a streaming platform
» Audio-recording software installed
» Streamlabs installed
If you’re thinking “Wait, what?” we recommend that you pick up a copy of Tee’s 
Twitch For Dummies, which goes into detail on what you need to make a livestream 
happen, such as cameras, streaming gear, and additional computer upgrades.
If you’re set up on a streaming account, good on ya for being ahead of the curve! 
If you aren’t, don’t worry because in this section you set up an account on Twitch. 
The steps here are Twitch-centric but are easily applied to other platforms such 
as YouTube or Facebook:
1. Go to http://twitch.tv and select Sign Up in the top-right corner.
You can watch Twitch streams without being signed up with the platform. 
However, if you want to take advantage of the chat features, you need an 
account.
2. Come up with a username.
Your username, which appears in chat, can be a nickname, a play on words, 
your own name, or almost anything. Just make sure that you don’t violate the 
terms of service when you create it. (For more on Twitch’s TOS, visit https://
www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/.)CHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 281
3. Create a password or a passphrase and confirm it.
While passwords should be difficult to crack but easy to remember, pass￾phrases are now recommended by cybersecurity experts. More characters are 
involved in passphrases. For example, you can take something easy like “I am 
a podcaster” and rework it as “!am@p0dcasteR” for your password field, as 
shown in Figure 16-3. This very strong password meets the criteria of many 
platforms.
4. Enter your birthday.
The date you enter, which is based on an honor system, verifies your age 
to make sure that you’re 13 or older.
5. Enter a mobile number or an email.
The email you use here is where all notifications and any news from 
Twitch are sent.
6. After reviewing the terms of service and the privacy policy, click Sign 
Up to complete the application.
Congratulations! Your Twitch account is now active.
FIGURE 16-3:
Setting up a 
Twitch channel 
takes only a few 
minutes and 
is free.282 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
You have a place on Twitch, but the state of your account is a lot like the state of an 
X (formerly Twitter) account newly launched, where the profile and bio are blank. 
Take some time to complete your profile and set up a channel with all the bells and 
whistles needed to make the best first impression when people show up. (For details 
on how to do this — again! — see Twitch For Dummies.) With a basic account up and 
running, we recommend taking a tour of Twitch by visiting live streamers running 
your favorite video game, hosting an open chat session, or recording a podcast.
Next up, you install a component from RØDE that will make streaming incredibly 
easy (and yes, fun!) on a PC or a Mac.
Setting the Stage: Working with RØDE 
Streamer X and Streamlabs
In Twitch For Dummies, Tee talks in depth about Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS
(https://pfdbook.link/obs), and Streamlabs (https://pfdbook.link/stream
labs), two video-broadcasting applications that turn your computer and any 
audio-video components connected to it into a broadcast studio. In this section, 
you get a quick look at Streamlabs.
Before you start, however, you need a capture card to enable your computer to go 
beyond its built-in video card. We want to flex a bit here, so we bring in RØDE 
Streamer X, an all-in-one solution that lets you podcast and stream anywhere.
Streamer X is the hardware you need to stream, and Streamlabs is the software 
you need to go live online.
Streamer X: Livestreaming 
wherever you are
Do you recall our best friend in podcasting, the RØDECaster Pro II mixer (dis￾cussed in detail in Chapter 4)? Streamer X is RØDECaster’s little brother and your 
best friend in livestreaming. Streamer X is a video capture card, an audio inter￾face, and a control bay, all contained in a compact and durable design that is also 
portable.
Streamer X’s inputs and features include the following: 
» Two HDMI ports (one THROUGH, one IN)
» Two USB-C ports for connecting to two computers or consolesCHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 283
» Two headphone ports (one 3.5mm for gaming headsets, one ¼ inch for 
headphones) offering zero latency monitoring
» Input for XLR or ¼-inch jacks with a built-in ultra-low-noise, high-gain preamp
» Audio and video control for devices attached to Streamer X
» Fully customizable control pads for audio effects, voice effects, and MIDI 
commands
This device, shown up close in Figure 16-4, might seem like a hefty investment at 
$399, but it’s an impressive addition to your podcast production that offers you so 
many streaming options. Streamer X can make your livestream happen anywhere 
you and your computer happen to find yourselves.
Streamer X can run off your computer’s power supply from the USB-C 1 port, 
offering a lot of opportunity for podcasting and live streaming on-the-go. How￾ever, Streamer X may tap into resources your computer needs to livestream, 
affecting the overall quality of your production. We recommend that you use an 
independent power supply with your first few streams to take full advantage of 
what the device can offer. When you’re comfortable with Streamer X, start testing 
its limits when running off your computer’s power supply.
FIGURE 16-4:
Streamer X is 
your all-in-one 
solution for 
streaming on a 
Mac or a PC.284 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
With Streamer X out of its box and an idea taking form in your head for your first 
stream, let’s get your studio set up. For this exercise, you set up Streamer X for 
streaming video games — the default setting for livestreaming. However, during 
this setup, we also provide non-gaming content options:
1. Plug Streamer X into a power supply.
2. Plug one end of a USB-C high-speed data transfer cable into Streamer X’s 
USB-C 1 port and the other end into your computer.
Streamer X’s included USB-C cable is made for high-speed data transfer. If you 
are looking to upgrade or replace your USB-C cables for this device, make sure 
you purchase USB-C cables that support high-speed data transfer.
3. Plug an XLR microphone into the mic input port.
4. Plug a pair of headphones into the headphones jack.
5. Plug a gaming console into the HDMI IN port.
While we feature a gaming console here, this input can be used to connect any 
device you’re capturing, such as a video camera or another computer.
6. Plug an external monitor into the HDMI THRU port.
The external monitor, which supports up to 4K60 high dynamic range (HDR) 
video, enables you to view the feed coming into the HDMI IN port during 
capture.
For full 4K support, use HDMI 2.0 (or above) cables for the connections 
between HDMI devices.
Now, with Streamer X connected, you can create a scene in Streamlabs resembling 
Figure 16-5. So let’s keep pushing forward and set up Streamlabs.
Streamlabs: Your livestreaming 
control board
Now that you have the hardware in place, it’s time to set up the software. Stream￾labs allows you to set up different scenes, such as Livestream Starting Soon or Be 
Right Back, alongside a main scene where you feature the content you’re actively 
producing. The application also provides overlay templates in different themes, 
moods, applications, and colors.
With just a few clicks, your stream can be transformed from basic to breathtaking. 
And, if you have the processing power, your overlays and widgets can be ani￾mated, adding an even more dynamic look to your channel.CHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 285
The best attribute of Streamlabs is how insanely easy it is to get cracking with it:
1. Download and install Streamlabs at https://pfdbook.link/streamlabs.
2. Double-click the Streamlabs icon to launch Streamlabs.
3. Log in with Twitch, YouTube, or the streaming service of your choice.
The Streamlabs application, with your credentials, syncs with the various 
streaming platforms.
4. In the top-left section of Streamlabs’ screen, click the themes icon (shown 
in the margin).
The screen shown in Figure 16-6 appears.
5. Find and select a theme for your stream.
You can search through the various templates or use the Scene Themes 
category, located in the top left. Click a template’s preview image to see a 
full-screen preview of it. While some themes are part of a paid subscription 
to Streamlabs, many themes are free.
You can use the Game Category filter to narrow the search parameters. Filters 
make the decision process a little easier.
For non-gamers reading this, don’t let the Game Category menu throw you off. 
You can still find incredible themes for your livestream in the various catego￾ries featured in Streamlabs.
6. When you find a theme you like, click the Install Overlay button at the 
top-right side of the template’s preview.
You now have a template in place. Yeah, it’s that easy.
FIGURE 16-5:

you can connect 
multiple audio 
and video 
sources to your 
computer, which 
you can then 
manage with 
Streamlabs.286 PART 5 Podcasting the World of Tomorrow . . . Today!
After you have a template, you need to populate it with the video and audio sources 
coming from Streamer X. Again, Streamlabs makes the process easy:
1. In the top-left corner of Streamlabs, click the editor icon (shown in the 
margin).
The template you’ve applied should offer a Starting Soon scene, usually an 
introduction screen. Under the name of the template, you see other items or 
scenes listed, as shown in Figure 16-7. Scenes are the various stages of your 
stream. From introduction images to intermission placards, Scenes should 
follow the progress from “Stream Starting Soon” to “Stream Ending” for your 
Twitch channel.
2. Click the Live Scene scene (or what the template calls the scene where 
your stream will happen) to edit it.
3. In the Sources window, select the Background source.
The background image becomes surrounded with a bounding box.
FIGURE 16-6:
The Themes 
section offers a 
variety of moods, 
looks, and 
atmospheres for 
your stream.CHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 287
Sources are exactly what they sound like: sources of audio and video needed 
to make your stream happen. Instead of the console managing it, you and 
Streamlabs are managing all sources independently of one another and using 
Streamlabs like a mixer.
4. Click + to add a source to this Live Scene scene.
The Add Source window appears.
5. Select the Video Capture Device option, and then click the Add Source 
button.
6. In the Add New Source field, type Host Camera for the name of the source, 
and then click the Add New Source button.
You see the Properties window, which tells Streamlabs where the signal source 
is coming from. You can adjust preferences for your devices here.
7. From the Device drop-down list, select your web camera, and then 
click Done.
When Streamlabs detects a signal, it drops the source directly into your scene’s 
layout. You can adjust this placement in the next step.
8. Click and drag the bottom-right handle of the video to resize it.
9. In the Sources window, click and drag Host Camera to the top of the list 
of your sources.
10. To incorporate any additional cameras and audio sources, repeat Steps 5 
through 9.
If you’re using Streamer X, you would have Streamer X (or your mixer) as the 
incoming audio source.
FIGURE 16-7:

In planning for your stream, you should have an idea of how to customize this 
overlay template. Personalize it by editing the labels provided, tinker with various 
elements to bring more depth to your productions, and design a flow from begin￾ning to end. The more you dive into Streamlabs, the more possibilities there are 
for you.
And You’re Live! Podcasting in the Moment
After your stream is set up in Streamlabs, you’re ready to go live. If you’re 
working with friends, either remotely or in your studio, make sure everyone is 
ready 15 to 30 minutes before your scheduled go time so you can run the final 
audio and video checks. Your pre-show prep should also cover any notes you or 
others in your show want to talk about.
With everything agreed upon, questions answered, and equipment checked, it’s 
time to hit your Go Live button:
1. Launch your audio recording software and start recording.
Part of your pre-show prep should also be making sure your DAW (digital 
audio workstation) is recording and ready to go.
2. Go to Streamlabs and confirm that you’re in your Starting Soon scene.
3. Click the Go Live button in the lower-right corner of the app.
Instead of starting a stream at the scheduled time, streamers tend to launch a 
stream a few minutes before to give people time to receive notification and 
arrive at your channel. Tee usually starts his Stream Starting Soon reel (a 
collection of clips from previous streams) 15 minutes before appearing live in 
front of the camera.
4. Begin your podcast, making sure to check your chat window during the 
show for comments or questions.
5. When you sign off on your podcast, wish your chat audience farewell and 
thank them for hanging out on your live stream.
6. End your stream and stop your recording software.
Welcome to the streaming workflow that includes podcasting. You have an audio 
recording of your podcast, but you also have a video stream that can be down￾loaded and edited either as a special video episode or stripped of its audio and 
edited as a backup recording.CHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 289
It’s a Stream! No, It’s a Podcast. No, 
It’s a Stream and a Podcast!
So what does streaming the recording of your podcast bring to your production? 
Why is going live with video essential to an audio podcast?
» Live interaction with your audience: A live audience adds a level of 
excitement and energy to your production. Something you or one of your 
co-hosts say can spark audience commentary. A special guest with a shared 
interest (gaming developer, fantasy author, voice actor) may inspire questions.
» A platform for a new audience to find you: New visitors to your chat may 
want to catch up with previous shows, find out how your show began, and are 
SERIOUSLY? A SELFIE STICK?
The much-maligned selfie stick has been a source of ridicule or, for those really lost in 
their own narcissism, embarrassing moments of clumsiness. But when it comes to film￾ing on your smartphone, a selfie stick saves your arm from cramping and offers your 
video a bit of stability. With the right angle and leverage, your selfie stick can become a 
collapsible gimbal and provide better options for capturing people and even activity. For 
additional polish to your self-shot video, you can also employ any model of the DJI 
Osmo Mobile Gimbal, a gimbal solution for your smartphone.
Just remember to be well aware of your surroundings. Getting the best shot for your 
podcast will not matter one bit if you are recovering in a hospital (or worse). And yes, 
Tee (on the right) was being very careful with the vintage steam train slowly advancing 
behind him.

curious as to what your podcast is all about. Bringing an audience into a show 
is a great way to attract new listeners.
» Videos featuring bonus content: Once your stream is concluded, streaming 
platforms offer options for exporting streams to other locations like YouTube 
or Vimeo. You can offer these uploads as embedded videos in your show 
notes. You can also edit and isolate footage not found in the final podcast, 
offering these clips as incentives for your audience to attend a live stream or 
to support your podcast on a membership-supported platform like Patreon.
» Automatic backup recording: We know all too well that redundancies are a 
beautiful thing. Wonderful once-in-a-lifetime interviews and engaging 
discussions with co-hosts are lost when a recording fails. By incorporating 
streaming into your podcast’s workflow, you automatically create a backup 
recording ready for production.
You can use the audio from your stream as your podcast file as well. To retrieve 
audio from your stream, do the following:
1. Go to your streaming platform and access your directory of previous 
broadcasts.
On the Twitch platform, you go to the Video Producer section. Note that Twitch 
erases broadcasts from its servers after two weeks.
If you make your account a Twitch Turbo account ($11.99 a month), previous 
broadcasts are removed after 60 days.
2. Find your podcast stream and select the option to download the episode 
to your computer.
In Twitch, go to the Video Producer section and select your podcast stream 
to download, as shown in Figure 16-8.
FIGURE 16-8:
Twitch offers 
content creators 
the option to 
download 
streams in the 
video directory.CHAPTER 16 One Giant Leap for Podcasting: Live Streaming Content 291
3. Import the episode into a media player or video editor.
QuickTime is a common media player available as a free download for both 
Windows and Mac.
4. Export the podcast stream as audio only from the media player or video 
editor.
For QuickTime, this process is as simple as opening the episode in the app and 
choosing File  ➪   Export As  ➪   Audio Only.
5. Import the stream audio into your digital audio workstation (DAW).
To review how to import audio into your DAW, see Chapter 8.
6. Edit and save your podcast.
Streaming platforms make working with live video less like a leap between medi￾ums and more like a logical and seamless addition to your workflow. And much 
like your early steps with podcasting, upgrades to enable streaming don’t have to 
break the bank.

Ten Things We Wish We 
Had Known When We 
Started Podcasting
Oh, the things we’ve seen (and done) in the last 20 years! There’s an old 
expression that says, “experience is the comb that life gives you after 
you’ve lost all your hair.” The contents of this chapter are a collection of 
lessons we’ve learned by things we’ve done or not done as well as what we’ve 
observed from other content creators. We’re firm believers of the philosophy that 
when you get a new role or responsibility, seek out a mentor. Let this chapter be 
your Yoda, Luke. For a Jedi podcaster, soon you will be, hmmm?
Use Your Mic Effectively
We love the saying “Content is king and quality is queen. If the queen isn’t happy 
then nobody is happy.” That is to say, if nobody can hear you clearly, they won’t 
be coming back. Using one or more microphones properly is a key component to 
quality content. Yes, we’ve already covered loads of information about micro￾phones in Chapters 2 and 7 (including an embarrassing tale by your authors — we 
wish someone would have told us how to use the mics properly sooner).
IN THIS CHAPTER
» Suggestions for getting started
» Lessons learned when doing 
interviews
» Tips on lighting and video296 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Beyond the technical details, however, we have a few tips for looking and sound￾ing your best without going into debt: 
» Know how to use your mic. Earlier in the book, we share the classic tale of 
how Tee was speaking into the end of a side-addressable mic. Knowing how 
to use your microphone may not seem as simple as you first thought. For 
example, did you know that nearly all side-addressable mics also have a front 
and back? One morning, Chuck was speaking with a co-worker via video 
conference and recognized that the person’s audio was low despite the fact 
that he was close to the mic and addressing it properly from the side — but it 
was the wrong side. Chuck suggested rotating it 180 degrees to address the 
front of the mic, not the back, which solved the problem. His co-worker, who 
shall rename anonymous to protect his reputation, was appreciative.
» Have one mic per guest. If you’re doing a podcast with multiple guests, be 
sure everyone has their own microphone. Passing a single mic around can 
cause noise. Placing a single mic in the center of a table means not everyone, 
if anyone, is close enough to be heard — and are probably not addressing it 
from the correct side or angle. We know that having extra mics is a particular 
challenge when going on the road, so do your best to plan accordingly with 
equipment and environment.
» Test your audio. Go beyond the classic “check one, check two” test to ensure 
that the audio is being picked up. Recently, Chuck was watching a high-quality 
4K video, but the audio quality was poor. The person in front of the camera 
was wearing a lavalier mic clipped to their shirt, but it was clear that the audio 
wasn’t from that mic but from the mic on a phone several feet away. As a 
result, the audio was very low, sounded distant, and was full of room echo. 
A simple test recording and playback would have revealed the failure and 
resulted in an easy remediation for this situation. Try saying a few words and 
playing it back to make sure everything is in order. In many cases, you won’t 
get a second chance to re-record.
Make Sure Others Can See Your Screen
At some point, you may have the opportunity, desire, or requirement to share 
content on your screen as part of a video. Make sure everyone can clearly see what 
you’re displaying. This tip is for podcasters and anyone who shares their screen 
during a video conference.
Sure, you have an ultra-wide monitor with super-high resolution and the infor￾mation on your screen looks good to you. But when you share it, consider whether CHAPTER 17 Ten Things We Wish We Had Known When We Started Podcasting 297
someone watching on a tablet or phone can make out what’s on your screen. Here 
are a few tips to help with that:
» Use a large font and few words. We won’t get into tips for putting together a 
presentation slide deck because that could be another book in itself. However, 
if you stick with a few basic tips, you’ll ensure that your presentation 
can be seen:
• Use a font size that can be seen. Make it big — 24pt or larger is always welcome.
• Reduce the number of words on the slide. If you increase the font size, you’ll 
reduce the number of words you can get on the screen, but that’s fine. 
Remember, your slides are visual aids. They should consist of short 
thoughts like “Drive costs down” or “Humans return to the moon.” If you 
have more than seven words for any bullet item, it’s time to think of a 
shorter way to say that thought.
• Consider using more images and fewer words. A picture is worth a thousand 
words. Why not let the visual aid support your idea rather than simply be a 
transcript of what you’re going to say.
» Zoom in. When the viewer can’t read the very tiny text, icons, and graphs on 
a shared screen, often the problem is that the podcaster is using a large 4K 
(or higher) monitor. They share their entire screen but the content on the 
screen is too tiny for most viewers to read. When sharing your screen on a 
1080p HD display, open your browser and start by zooming in to 125 percent 
(see Figure 17-1). The higher the resolution of your display, the more you’ll 
have to zoom in. You might need to zoom in to 200 percent or more on some 
high-res displays.
FIGURE 17-1:
Ensure that 
everyone can see 
your screen 
clearly.298 PART 6 The Part of Tens
» Share just an app window or tab. Instead of sharing your entire display, 
check your software (such as Zoom or StreamYard) to see if you can share just 
the app or tab. For example, Microsoft PowerPoint has a window mode (check 
out the Slide Show menu under Set Up Slide Show). With this option, you can 
run PowerPoint in a window, share that with your viewers, and still see other 
things on your screen such as notes, chat, or people raising their hands. The 
key here is to plan what you’ll be sharing. If you’re sharing only a single 
browser tab and your app opens another tab, you’ll see the new browser tab 
just fine but your audience will be stuck viewing the original browser tab — 
and you’ll have to back up, stop sharing, and re-share the new tab (or revert to 
the entire screen; see the preceding tip). Awkward!
» Confirm that everyone can see the screen clearly. Just because you can 
see things clearly doesn’t mean everyone else can. Just like testing your audio, 
test your sharing too. If possible, test before you go on the air. A co-host or 
producer is always useful for providing feedback. If you don’t have one of 
those, try joining your broadcast with a second device and see how it looks. 
Or go with the old tried-and-true method: Ask your audience if they can see 
clearly and adjust accordingly.
Have a trackpad? Use the pinch-zoom gesture with your browser window to zoom 
in to what you want to show your audience. This directs the viewer’s attention 
where you want it and away from any potential distractions.
Do your best to remove distractions. Some of your viewers love looking at things 
like what plug-ins you have installed, how many unread emails you have, or what 
apps are currently running rather than looking at your presentation. Keep their 
attention focused where you want it.
Share Your Podcast the Right Way
While reading this book, you may have become slightly overwhelmed by the num￾ber of file formats. Fear not. When it comes time to export your masterpiece for 
distribution, we’re here to help keep it as simple as possible. For audio, try to 
import and edit raw files (WAV) and then export as MP3. Nearly every audio player 
works well with MP3. While the landscape is ever-changing and some players may 
have others features, MP3 is your best common denominator. For video, import 
and edit files that are as high resolution as possible (raw) and then export to MP4. 
Much like MP3 for audio, MP4 for video is a commonly recognized format.CHAPTER 17 Ten Things We Wish We Had Known When We Started Podcasting 299
Some hosting providers will convert your file format when you upload it. For 
example, you can upload MOV video files to YouTube and it will play them just 
fine. If you download the same video from YouTube, you will get an MP4 file, but 
the settings may not be the quality you expect. Check with your hosting provider 
to see if they have any special recommendations or provisions.
Some options can significantly affect the quality of your audio and video. For 
example, compression (see Chapter 1) greatly affects the quality and size of your 
podcast file. The higher the compression, the smaller the file and the lower the 
quality — but also the lower the cost if you’re paying for bandwidth from your 
hosting provider (see Chapter 10). For MP3 audio files, a good place to start is a 
44,100Hz sample rate, a 128bps bit rate, and joint stereo. If you drop the sample 
rate or bit rate any lower, your audio quality could suffer. For MP4 video files, our 
recommended starting settings are H.264 encoding, 30 frames per second, and a 
1000 kbps data rate.
And as always, we suggest you test, test, test. Review your video on different 
devices to see how it looks and sounds, and then adjust as necessary. As with the 
audio, lowering the frame rate or data rate lower may lower your file size but may 
also make the video jittery or blurry.
Have a Plan
Way back in the early days of podcasting, the two of us would come up with an 
idea, slap together a website, and start recording. This approach often resulted in 
several challenges, including coming up with new topics for each episode, lining 
up guests, delivery consistency, and even getting the co-host to show up. The lack 
of a plan meant struggles, and when production was a struggle, the show often 
didn’t last long.
By contrast, when Chuck’s team at his day job suggested he start a podcast in 
which he interviewed people in his software developer ecosystem, management 
wanted to know that the time and money invested would provide a return to the 
company and the audience. The project was given a green light only after Chuck 
presented a plan outlining the title, tag line, objective, proposed episode length, 
social media plan, costs, and  — the tricky part  — episode topics for the first 
six months.
The new show’s format was quite different from his past shows, which relied on 
recent news stories for their content. The effort involved in scheduling, recording, 
editing, and delivery was greatly reduced because of the work done up front. 300 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Several years have passed, and the show is still humming along with a pipeline of 
upcoming content. Depending on your plan and your show’s format, you may be 
able to record episodes in advance (or out of order), which gives you the opportu￾nity to take a vacation now and then while maintaining a consistent delivery 
schedule.
The bottom line is to have a plan. Think about the show’s format, delivery sched￾ule, and time commitment.
Create Five to Ten Episodes 
before Going Live
You have a great idea for a show and are eager for the world to hear your message. 
It’s all so exciting! We know, we’ve been there (more than a few times). However, 
we recommend that you pull back on the reins a little and create five to ten epi￾sodes before publishing them publicly. Think of these as rehearsals to not only see 
how easy it is to create new episodes but also to get an idea of the workflow and 
what the result should be.
These rehearsal episodes enable you to solicit feedback from others and are an 
opportunity to learn about your show’s format and perhaps discover a few handy 
options in your software and hardware that can save you time and frustration. You 
may even decide to throw out one or more of those early episodes. Many experi￾enced podcasters have said, “Wow, were we awkward back then!” The episodes 
that pass the test can become your buffer.
We know you want an audience and are excited to get started. However, you never 
get a second chance to make a first impression. Why not offer your audience the 
best experience by practicing a few times before going out on that big podcasting 
stage?
Don’t Rubber Stamp Your Next Podcast
After you have your first podcast show up and running, you may be considering 
another. Hey, why not? It’s fun and perhaps profitable and you’ve already gone up 
the learning curve to launch your first show. A common trap is thinking “I’ve 
done this before. I have all this experience. I’ll make my new show much like my 
last one.”CHAPTER 17 Ten Things We Wish We Had Known When We Started Podcasting 301
Not so fast!
Each show has its own signature, vibe, personality, or whatever you want to call 
it. Rubber stamping your new show stifles your creativity and potential. Podcast￾ing has a lot in common with acting. After all, both are performances. For exam￾ple, the character that actor Tom Hanks played in Forrest Gump was the life of the 
entire movie. In comparison, the same actor as Colonel Tom Parker in Elvis had a 
different vibe. Different makeup, different clothing, different personality. That’s 
how you need to think about your performance as well as other show elements, 
such as artwork, music, website, and your voice.
Going from a solo show to having a co-host is a major change. Going from a news 
podcast about molecular research to audio drama is a really big change! While the 
experience you’ve gained with hardware, software, social media, and perhaps 
even bringing your own knowledge of molecular research to a thrilling fictional 
story is all useful, the essence of the show should be different.
Control the Environment for 
Audio and Video
In Chapter 7 we discuss ambient noise and how you may want to include or exclude 
it depending on your show’s format. This section builds on that by giving you 
some suggestions on how to best control the environment of your recording space 
and avoid pitfalls that may not be evident until after the recording:
» Silence your studio as much as possible. The more you can reduce 
background noise while you record, the happier you’ll be. Computer fans, 
air conditioning units, and other noises you normally ignore can add up to 
humming or buzzing on your podcast. Control what you can and work around 
the rest. For example, ask your landscaper to send a text before arriving with 
the loud trimmer and leaf blower, and adjust your recording schedule 
accordingly.
» Keep out the light. Unwanted light in a video podcast can be worse than 
errant sound in audio. Perhaps the lighting in your studio is fine — until the 
winter, when the sun comes directly in the windows and hits the camera lens. 
A simple solution is to use light-blocking (honeycomb) blinds.
» With video, every detail matters. Obviously, the clothing you wear on an 
audio podcast is of little consequence, but add a camera and venture into the 
wonderful world of video and your wardrobe is the first element you need to 302 PART 6 The Part of Tens
consider. Here are a few general rules as you talk to the camera. Different 
rules may apply to different situations:
• Stay away from all-black, all-white, plaid, and striped clothes. They can cause 
contrast issues and moiré effects in your video.
• Avoid a distracting background as well as a completely neutral background. In 
some of Tee’s early video offerings, he was filming against a blank, neutral 
background. A void, if you will. And it was dull. A coat of paint, a variety of 
flat decorations, and a Litra Beam LX from Logitech G later, Tee’s video 
productions leveled up and offered a bit of balance and personality to his 
productions, as shown before and after in Figure 17-2. Even something as 
simple as a curtain makes for a good background.
Here’s a neat lighting trick: Shine colored lights onto a simple black curtain 
behind you. By having the lights close to the curtain, you can create a 
simple, illuminated background for your video.
• Lighting is essential. Try to reduce shadows on your face. You may have to 
get creative with your lighting. Consider using a ring light or multiple lights 
from different angles.
Be aware of reflections if you or your guest wears glasses. You may have to 
adjust the angle of the camera or lighting to reduce the reflection from the 
lenses.
» Don’t sit between the camera and a bright light source. Sitting in front of a 
bright light source such as a window with daylight pouring in puts the camera 
in conflict. You’ll look like a silhouette. If you try to change the camera settings 
so you can see your face, the background light will be very intense. If possible, 
move the camera and your workspace so that the daylight from the window is 
behind the camera and lighting your lovely face.
FIGURE 17-2:
Simple applica￾tions of lighting, 
color, and 
decorations, as

evolution of his

of a podcast.CHAPTER 17 Ten Things We Wish We Had Known When We Started Podcasting 303
Your Guests’ Audio Should Sound 
as Good as Yours
Here’s a situation we’ve run into over the years: You’re using Zoom, StreamYard, 
or some other software to record an interview, but your guest doesn’t sound good. 
Here are some tips to help you close the gap on differences between their audio 
and yours:
» Do a tech check. Before the interview starts, guide them through a few tasks 
to try to improve their audio. It’s helpful to study the options of your recording 
rig. Here are some tips for your tech check that take only a few minutes and 
can result in a better listener experience (if only just a little):
• Have your guest move as close as possible to the microphone.
• Check their input device. We’ve experienced plenty of people who were not 
using their USB microphones properly. Either the software was configured 
to the incorrect audio input or they were not addressing the microphone 
properly (see Chapter 7). If your guest doesn’t have a fancy USB micro￾phone, look for alternatives to the built-in microphone. For example, if they 
have earbuds paired with their computer, have them try those and see if 
the earbuds are an improvement to the audio.
• Check their audio levels in the software. A common problem with remote 
guests is that the audio is too low (or too high.) Spend a few minutes with 
them going over the software settings to adjust their input level. Some 
apps or websites have an automatic gain control (AGC) setting, which tries 
to automatically adjust the input level instead. Sometimes this works well 
but other times it can be nothing but trouble.
» Take care of audio levels in post-production. If you’ve done what you could in 
the tech check but your guest’s audio is still quieter than yours, the only way to 
fix it is in post-production. A tool such as Auphonic (https://pfdbook.link/
auphonic) might help by leveling, or bringing the high spots down and the low 
spots up in your audio. Chuck has been using Auphonic to do a final clean up on 
his Technorama podcast for years. Auphonic processes up to two hours per 
month for free; if you need more capacity, you have to get a paid subscription.
» Realize that your guest doesn’t have a great setup. You’re a podcaster now 
and have cool gear. Your guest is probably talking into a built-in mic on a 
laptop at arm’s length. Don’t stress trying to have everyone sound as though 
they’re in the same room speaking into high-end equipment. When you’re 
listening to a podcast and the host sounds great but the guest sounds as if 
they’re calling in from a phone halfway around the globe, you recognize and 
accept it. Your listeners will too.304 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Check your software and hardware to see if you can record each guest on a sepa￾rate audio track (or channel.) This allows you to adjust for different audio levels 
in post-production. Zoom and StreamYard offer this feature with a paid 
subscription.
Don’t Wing It with Interviews
Find out as much professional and personal information you can about your guest 
before heading into the interview. You may discover potential tangents to explore 
or something you have in common to help drive the conversation and create a 
friendly atmosphere. Remember, you’re there on behalf of your listeners. In some 
cases, your listeners will know more about your guest than you do. (In Chapter 6, 
we cover interview skills and techniques in detail.)
Chuck tried doing an unprepared interview one time, and let’s just say it was an 
interesting experiment. He was at the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) 
fly-in in Oshkosh Wisconsin in 2006. While Chuck finds airplanes fascinating and 
is a passenger quite a bit as part of his day job, he’s not a pilot. So when Chuck’s 
friend Steve spotted the Honda Jet with its interesting wing design, Steve sug￾gested that Chuck go do a quick interview. Why not? Holding a microphone builds 
courage in Chuck for some reason! He has a standard series of questions and this 
wasn’t the first interview at the convention, so he was feeling pretty good. How￾ever, the interview was short and lacked depth because he didn’t have expertise in 
this field, and the lack of planning was obvious very quickly after the standard 
questions were used up. Fortunately for him, the interview was targeted more at 
general geeks rather than aviation enthusiasts.
Tee had a similar situation, when someone recommended an author whose books 
had been banned from certain libraries. The desire to feed the content machine 
kept Tee from his usual research. Within the first five minutes, Tee discovered 
that the banned book was a misunderstanding and the author was not only fea￾tured but was doing a signing that weekend. The interview descended into a sur￾real series of name drops, hard-to-confirm accomplishments and accolades, and 
awkward pauses. At the end of the day, Tee remained without a presentable 
episode.
Better preparation in both these circumstances would have made for better 
interviews.CHAPTER 17 Ten Things We Wish We Had Known When We Started Podcasting 305
Look at the Camera, Not Your Screen
Here’s another one for the podcasters with video. Maintain eye contact with your 
camera as much as you can. Looking at the camera is a hard skill to learn and not 
natural. As humans, we would rather look at another human face than a dark hole 
into the abyss. Nevertheless, looking directly at the camera makes a big difference 
to the viewer. It means you’re talking to them, not distracted by something off 
screen. It makes them feel like they’re part of the conversation rather than a 
bystander. Even if your camera is sitting on top of the monitor, focus your eye 
contact on the camera!
We’ve seen podcasts and webinars where the host is looking a few degrees left, 
right, or down, and it feels disingenuous. “What are they looking at? Why aren’t 
they talking to me? Don’t they like me? Is there something more interesting over 
there?” No, they’re just looking at the interview guest, their notes, or the produc￾tion software on their screen.
However, don’t give a creepy death stare to the camera during the entire recording 
or livestream. You may need to make the occasional eye contact with your in￾studio guest, switch between screen layouts, or share a screen image as part of 
your production. After all, you have a lot to do as a podcaster. The occasional 
interruption is understandable. Just make sure to return your gaze to the camera 
as much as possible. If you want a good example of this, study the people deliver￾ing the news.
Chuck puts googly eyes on the webcam sitting atop his monitor to help him focus 
there. Another idea is to use a sticky note with the words Look here!CHAPTER 18 Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out 307

No pressure.
Where to begin? Where to begin? With each edition of Podcasting For Dummies, your 
humble authors sit down and put together our own top ten lists of podcasts, and 
here’s what we’ve noticed: There are a lot of podcasts out there. While some of our 
listening habits have remained steady and constant as the Northern Star, our taste 
can sometimes shift into unexpected offerings; if you listen to Astronomy Cast
(https://pfdbook.link/astronomycast), you’d know that Polaris is not that
constant. We listen to a solid cross-section of types of podcasts, not just in the way 
of genres but in production values. So with a quick edit of the outline and a change 
of mindset, this chapter offers you Ten Types of Podcasts to check out.
With these ten kinds of podcasts as a starting point, you can easily begin to fill

recommend or delve into the many directories out there, some of which offer sug￾gestions based on your listening habits.
Always check podcasting directories to see how active these shows are before you 
subscribe. The podcasts in this section are constantly changing. They were actively 
producing content when we wrote this book, but printed material is never as up to 
date as a good podcast directory.
Tech Podcasts
If you’re thinking about podcasting, you likely have a comfortable knowledge of 
computers, the internet, and blogging. But regardless of how technologically 
savvy you are, like any aspect of life, you should never stop learning. That’s why 
you should subscribe to at least one tech podcast.
The agenda for a tech podcast is (surprise!) technology. All geek, all the time. Geeks, 
nerds, wizards, and tech help gurus sit behind a microphone and pull back the 
curtain on how your computer works, how a podcast’s RSS feed can be better, and 
how to make your time behind the keyboard more efficient.
Tech podcasts come delivered to you in a variety of skill levels and on a variety 
of topics:
» Macs: Some excellent podcasts for Mac users include the Macworld Podcast
(shown in Figure 18-1 and available at https://pfdbook.link/macworld) 
and the iMore Show (https://pfdbook.link/imore), covering the latest 
developments coming from Cupertino, recent product reviews, and the odd 
opinion or two on the direction of Apple.
» PC and general computing news: Many tech podcasts, such as This Week in 
Tech (or TWiT, as it is lovingly referred to by its hosts and listeners, available at 
https://pfdbook.link/twit) or Daily Tech News Show (https://pfdbook.
link/dtns), are generic in their approach to operating systems, following a 
mindset that a computer is a computer and the rest is mostly bells and 
whistles.
» Technology perspectives: Computer Talk Radio (https://pfdbook.link/
ctr) and Technorama (https://pfdbook.link/technorama) give personal 
and (in many cases) light-hearted perspectives on technology in society and 
go beyond the geek-speak, addressing issues on how technology can affect 
just about everything.CHAPTER 18 Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out 309
Whichever podcast you feed into your podcatching client, find a tech podcast 
that’s right for you and allow yourself to grow into your geekdom. There’s a lot to 
learn about computers, smartphones, the Internet of Things, and other cool James 
Bond gadgets available at your local electronics store. When you have the basics 
down, these podcasts allow you to unlock the potential of these devices and go 
beyond your expectations.
Independent Media Podcasts
Media mavericks are alive and well and doing just fine in the 21st century, finding 
a new promotion channel with podcasting.
Independent labels, where the artists also work as promoters, producers, and 
holders-of-all-rights, have control over where their music plays, how often it is 
played, and how much it will cost you. Many indie musicians who are having 
trouble getting exposure and radio airplay will grant permission for podcasters to 
use their music. What does this cost the podcaster? A few moments of time and a 
spot or two, such as, “This music is brought to you by . . .” and “Visit this band 
online at w-w-w-dot .  .  .” In return, the musician is exposed to a worldwide 
audience.
Musicians such as The Gentle Readers, Michelle Malone (both featured on Evil 
Genius Chronicles at https://pfdbook.link/egc), George Hrab, and Rubber Band 
FIGURE 18-1:

Banjo (both featured on Tee’s Parsec-winning podcast Billibub Baddings and The 
Case of the Singing Sword) have enjoyed the benefits of associating themselves with 
a podcast. Catching wind of this, indie artists of all backgrounds are turning to 
podcasts to spotlight their independent works, which might go against the corpo￾rate entertainment industry’s notion of what the public wants. Here are a few 
such podcasts you may want to check out:
» Welcome to Night Vale (https://pfdbook.link/wtn): Best described as A 
Prairie Home Companion meets The Twilight Zone and known for its quirky, 
sometimes sinister storytelling, the popular podcast has proven itself a 
fantastic platform for independent label music. Whenever Cecil announces 
the Night Vale weather report, listeners are treated to music from artists such 
as Anais Mitchell, Robin Aigner, daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra, Destroyer, Daniel 
Knox, Toys and Tiny Instruments, and Eliza Rickman.
» Irish and Celtic Music Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/celtic): Celebrated 
musician Marc Gunn hosts The Irish and Celtic Music Podcast. It’s all in the title. 
Marc offers his podcast as a spotlight for the best in Irish and Celtic culture 
and sound; and with over 20,000 downloads per episode, multiple wins for 
“Best Podsafe Music” from the People’s Choice Podcast Awards, and a 
consistent spot in iTunes’ “What’s Hot” directory for music podcasts, The 
Celtfather shows no signs of stopping.
» Making Movies is HARD!!! (https://pfdbook.link/mmih): The independent 
film industry — particularly with the popularity of video podcasting, YouTube, 
and other online video providers — is embracing podcasting platforms as not 
only a place to promote but a place to educate. Making Movies is HARD!!!, hosted 
by Timothy Plain and Alrik Bursell, discusses independent filmmaking, but not 
just shooting and editing a film. Timothy and Alrik deep dive into all aspects of 
filmmaking. Writing. Producing. Directing. Even how you take care of your cast 
and crew. Timothy and Alrik also cover the downsides of making movies: hours 
of investment, rejection, lost opportunities, self-doubt. It’s all here.
Science Podcasts
The approach to science made popular by Bill Nye the Science Guy, Mr. Wizard, 
and the Mythbusters is rampant in the podosphere. Here are some science pod￾casts that we recommend:
» Astronomy Cast (https://pfdbook.link/astronomycast): If you’ve always 
wondered what’s really going on beyond our atmosphere, take a listen to a 
podcast descendant of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos concept. For those who would CHAPTER 18 Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out 311
never leave the planet without their attitude, Fraser Cain and Dr. Pamela Gay 
dubbed the show Astronomy Cast.
» Hidden Brain (https://pfdbook.link/hiddenbrain): This podcast explores 
questions about why we do what we do and its effect. Shankar Vendantam 
and his pantheon of knowledgeable experts use storytelling to help us 
understand ourselves better. He covers everything from snap judgements to 
how to prevent being manipulated. This is truly a wonderful show to improve 
your wellbeing.
» The Brain Science Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/brainscience): When 
it comes to the human brain and its mechanics, Dr. Ginger Campbell, MD, 
knows her way around it. The Brain Science Podcast (shown in Figure 18-2) 
features the latest books about neuroscience as well as interviews with 
leading scientists from around the world. You might think that neuroscience 
would appeal to a niche audience; but with over 7.5 million downloads, 
Dr. Campbell’s podcast continues to educate the world about how our 
brains work.
» Therapy for Black Girls (https://pfdbook.link/tfbg): Hosted by Dr. Joy 
Harden Bradford, Therapy for Black Girls focuses on making mental health 
topics more relevant and accessible for Black women. Dr. Bradford taps into 
pop culture to illustrate psychological concepts to overcome the stigma 
surrounding mental health issues. This podcast aims to make mental health 
topics accessible and relevant.

Science shows are good for you — like vegetables, only better. Not only can you 
learn something new or broaden your scope in a field you may regard as a hobby, 
but you can marvel at how the hosts demystify concepts once comprehensible 
only to PhDs.
Self-Development Podcasts
Why not broaden your horizons — personal or professional — with podcasting? 
For example, say you’ve always wanted to learn Spanish. You could shell out some 
bucks for the “Teach Yourself Spanish” series, or you could listen to the free 
SpanishPod101 podcast (https://pfdbook.link/spanish101). SpanishPod101 is a 
podcast that is part of a multiple-device approach across PDFs, online forums, 
and smart devices that culminate into a survival guide for a new language. With 
its podcast as the first step, SpanishPod101 helps you navigate situations at the 
restaurant, at the bank, or if your car breaks down.
Here are just a few examples of subjects offered in the podosphere:
» Education: Podcasts can be like your favorite class after the bell has rung, 
offering material devoted to what you might not have heard while in middle 
and high school. Stuff You Missed in History Class (https://pfdbook.link/
symihc), hosted by Tracy V. Wilson and Holly Frey, offers details behind Lady 
Jane Grey, Executive Order 9066, and comedians Abbott & Costello, each 
episode an in-depth look at events from our past. Or if you’re working on your 
language skills using the Duolingo (https://pfdbook.link/duolingo) app 
(it’s a blast learning a language this way!), you can increase your immersion 
with the Duolingo Podcast, specific to what language you’re learning.
» Career development: Cathy Heller, author, business, and life coach speaks 
with successful authors, celebrities, entrepreneurs, spiritual leaders, and 
everyday heroes about how they transformed their lives and ways you can do 
the same on The Cathy Heller Show (https://pfdbook.link/cathyheller). 
And when it comes to incredible visionaries — Bill Gates, Norman Lear, and 
Michelle Obama, to name a few — the TED Talks podcasts (https://pfdbook.
link/tedtalks) offer all kinds of great career advice from those who shape 
the world.

health and philosophy peppered with a bit of Bruce Lee, dive deeper into a 
martial art you study (or are thinking about studying) with whistlekick Martial 
Arts Radio (https://pfdbook.link/wkmar).
» Money management: If you’re looking for advice on managing your money, 
check out Money Girl (https://pfdbook.link/moneygirl). Or if you’re trying 
to manage finances after you have made the ultimate life investment (Hint: It 
involves the words “I do” or a variant of that), try His & Her Money Podcast
(https://pfdbook.link/hisandhermoney), which focuses on joint financial 
plans and their balance in a strong, marital relationship.
Whether you’re tuning in to one of numerous podcasts sponsored by universities 
and colleges or to an enthusiast who wants to share and swap resources with you, 
all this continuing education is available online, in audio, and at no charge.
MANAGER TOOLS, TAKING A PODCAST 
FURTHER
This section wouldn’t be complete without mentioning Manager Tools (https://
pfdbook.link/mt) and its spinoff, Career Tools. Whether you are a manager or 
an individual contributor, you’re sure to find something of value in each episode. 
Working from home, resumes, communications, they’ve got it all. Manager Tools, the 
company, began a weekly podcast in June 2005 targeted at giving managers specific, 
actionable information. Shortly thereafter, Career Tools was launched as a spinoff for 
individual contributors with the same goal. Both shows are free and became very 
popular. One of your authors has been a loyal listener since the beginning.
However, the podcasts themselves are not the end game. The Manager Tools teams use 
them as lead generation to their courses, workbooks, and conferences, which pay the 
bills. Additionally, you can purchase a personal license to access the complete archive, 
written show notes for each episode, a roadmap on how to roll out their tools, and their 
online interview tool (which alone is worth the price).

Comedy Podcasts
Sometimes you just need a good laugh. A bonus with comedy podcasts is having 
those good laughs categorized, digitized, and waiting for you, only a tap or click 
away.
Humor, though, is in the eye of the beholder and the ear of the listener. Perform￾ing a search on comedy podcasts will offer you many, many choices, ranging from 
kid-safe comedy to performing arts to adults-only discussions with an irreverent 
approach. Comedy covers a lot of ground, but straight-up comedy podcasts are 
not intended to do anything other than entertain.
The way these podcasts make you laugh covers a wide spectrum of how humor is 
defined. Here are a few comedy podcasts that we enjoy:
» Comedy4Cast (https://pfdbook.link/c4c): The unpredictability from 
Comedy4Cast’s host, Clinton Alvord, is one of the elements that adds charm to 
the show. Sometimes you get a tongue-in-cheek review of an electronic 
gadget; another time you hear a parody of another popular podcast, or 
Clinton could be offering a comedy serial. Whatever is on the menu provided 
(continued)CHAPTER 18 Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out 315
by cast and crew, Comedy4Cast has but one goal: having you pull over to the 
side of the road so you don’t drive into the ditch, or setting the hot coffee 
aside so as not to spit it on your keyboard. Disclaimer: Comedy4Cast is not 
responsible for damages incurred while listening.
» The FuMP (https://pfdbook.link/fump): The FuMP stands for “The Funny 
Music Project” and features a cavalcade of comedy musicians that include

» Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend (https://pfdbook.link/ariynbf):
This podcast began as an online talk show, streamed from journalist Alison 
Rosen’s Brooklyn apartment. This window into a comic writer’s life evolved 
into interviews that center on people’s genuine struggles, both in her back￾yard and around the world. Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend has been 
described as a marriage between Seinfeld and Charlie Rose, but Rosen 
considers her podcast a chronicle of daily life and how we tend to laugh 
at what we as humans deal with.
» The Geologic Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/geologic): No, wait, The 
Geologic Podcast is a podcast featuring the music of musician and author 
George Hrab! Hold on — The Geologic Podcast is a scientific and skeptic 
podcast featuring the musings of musician and author George Hrab! 
Actually . . . yes, The Geologic Podcast is all this and a comedy podcast guaran￾teed to get you thinking, all while rocking your socks off. A lot happens in this 
podcast, so best hold on to something when you dive in.
Slice-of-Life Podcasts
Comedy is prevalent in all the various genres of podcasting, especially with the 
podcasts that just take a look at life and give it a perspective. Sometimes you need 
humor to deal with loved ones, life’s unexpected pitfalls, or just the world as a 
whole. Slice-of-life podcasts offers audiences a chance to laugh at the headlines, 
to slow down with an in-depth look at a specific topic, or to look at a lifestyle. The 
subjects covered are varied, but the podcast serves as a window into the hosts’ 
world. True, most podcasts are; but in these podcasts, it’s about the moment, the 
here and now, and what is happening in their lives. From this casual and candid 316 PART 6 The Part of Tens
approach comes a podcast that might make you laugh, might make you cry, and 
just might make you look at something with a whole new perspective.
» C’est La Me (https://pfdbook.link/cestlame): Hosted by Amelia Rose 
Zimlich, C’est La Me (This Is Me) offers itself as that friend who is always there 
to celebrate your victories, listen to your gripes, and help you improve. As you 
listen, have your notepad ready. Amelia has insightful questions for you to 
answer on your own.
» The Way I Heard It with Mike Rowe (https://pfdbook.link/twihi): Mike 
Rowe, best known for his snarky-but-sincere approach to America’s working 
force in Dirty Jobs, brings all his dry wit and endless charm to The Way I Heard 
It. This podcast tells new and slightly unexpected stories of celebrities, history, 
and icons of culture, passed on from person to person, generation to 
generation. It’s a quick listen — usually under ten minutes per episode — 
and is guaranteed to make you smile.
» The Creative Solutions Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/creativesolutions/):
Produced by author, speaker, and entertainer Izolda Trakhtenberg, this podcast is 
a weekly talk show with business leaders, entrepreneurs, and creatives on tapping 
into innovation and problem-solving strategies through creativity. You learn how 
the show’s guests discover solutions by thinking outside the box. The Creative

As it goes with slice-of-life podcasts, the general content can go in any way: G, 
PG-13, to “What did they just say?” Always check the podcast’s listings (in direc￾tories or on their websites) for an Explicit tag to see how playfully blunt these 
podcasts can get.
Gaming Podcasts
You might think that podcasts about games and gaming would be better suited for 
the slice-of-life, geek, or comedy category. But long-form and serialized produc￾tions of friends gathering to crawl through a dungeon, claim the title of King of 
Tokyo, or share strategies and the latest news from World of Warcraft or Minecraft
stand in a class all their own. Gaming podcasts are quite popular, and the skill 
levels featured on these podcasts range from the professionals appearing on the 
circuit to the novices purely in it for the fun:
» What’s Good Games (https://pfdbook.link/whatsgood): Join Andrea 
Rene, Brittney Brombacher, and Riana Manuel-Peña as they analyze the 
week’s video game news, give hands-on impressions of upcoming titles, 
discuss your questions, and have a little bit of off-topic conversation. With 
over 30 years of video game industry experience, the conversation is sure 
to be passionate but never takes itself too seriously.
» Esports Insider Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/esi): This podcast site has 
the world of esports covered with two different brands in one feed. Esports 
Today offers short digests from the world of esports news, and The Industry
podcast brings you longer conversations with industry notables and key 
stakeholders. If you’re curious about what sponsors look for in funding an 
esports event or what effect virtual reality will have on esports, you’ll enjoy 
Esports Insider Podcast.
» The Steamrollers Adventure Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/tsap):
Michael J. Rigg loves to write. Michael J. Rigg loves role-playing games. Michael 
J. Rigg loves steampunk. When Mike wrote his debut novel, Clockwork Looking 
Glass, he wanted to delve even deeper into his world but also invite his friends 
along for the ride. This inspired Mike to design a d20-style role-playing game 
around his steampunk universe. The Steamrollers Adventure Podcast (shown 
in Figure 18-4) is an immersive RPG experience for its audience because 
Mike provides music and sound effects associated with events in-game. 
“Storycrafter Mike” keeps the action going as he pulls his friends and 
special guests deeper into a wonderland of his own making, with a lot 
of inappropriate humor peppered throughout.318 PART 6 The Part of Tens
» Critical Role (https://pfdbook.link/critrole): This podcast began as 
many role-playing campaigns did, with a bunch of nerdy friends playing 
Dungeons & Dragons in each other’s living rooms. Critical Role is now the 
must-listen-to RPG podcast, attracting over a half million viewers every week. 
With dreamy Matthew Mercer as your dungeon master in their third cam￾paign storyline, popular voiceover actors and special guests take on impossi￾ble challenges while enjoying a few laughs along the way.
Podcasts of the Pen
Tee stepped into podcasting with an idea no author had set out to do: serialize a 
novel in podcasts. When the podcast of MOREVI ended for Tee in the summer of 
2005, he looked at the audio equipment he had and asked himself, “So . . . what do 
I do now?” By this time, a few writerly podcasts were out there talking about the 
craft of writing, but there were no active podcasts on the business of writing books. 
To fill this void, Tee launched The Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy in September 
2005, a podcast about the everyday operations of a writing career.
The last episode of The Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy aired in 2009, but many 
more podcasts have appeared that cover all aspects of writing from the business

» The Creative Penn Podcast (https://pfdbook.link/tcp): New York Times
and USA Today bestselling thriller author Joanna Penn has developed quite a 
reputation with The Creative Penn, a podcast (and companion blog) that goes 
into all aspects of writing. Business. Creative demands. Time management. If 
you have questions about the writing industry, Joanna is a one-stop shop of 
knowledge. Her podcast also features interviews with authors of all back￾grounds and all genres, so if you’re looking for help in your writing career or 
creative project, The Creative Penn may be your first stop.

Hugo-winning podcast featuring seven professional authors and a huge 
collection of interviews, advice, and back-and-forth banter, Writing Excuses is a 
fast-paced weekly podcast for writers and by writers. They like to say, “Fifteen 
minutes long because you’re in a hurry and we’re not that smart,” but if you 
get them going, the show may run a little longer. Writing Excuses wants to help 
their audience become better writers, regardless if the end goal is writing 
professionally or writing for the soul.
» The Everyday Novelist (https://pfdbook.link/everydaynovelist):
J. Daniel Sawyer has penned over 25 books and over 30 short stories. While 
working on his next work-in-progress, Dan hosts The Everyday Novelist, a daily 
writing podcast about taking your writing passion to the next level. Within a 
few minutes, The Everyday Novelist tackles a new topic presented by Dan, a 
special guest, or his listeners. It’s a podcast that serves as your daily affirma￾tion for what you want to accomplish as a writer.
Geek Podcasts
If you’ve ever attended a Comic Con or a science-fiction-fantasy-horror conven￾tion, you may have witnessed firsthand passionate individuals who love to talk 
about their favorite movie, television show, or game. Or maybe you caught a live 
interview with an actress or writer that you love, and heard that Nathan Fillion is 
a comic book nerd or that Erin Grey is big into Tai Chi. Truly one of the joys of 
podcasting is capturing good laughs between friends, luminaries, and a room full 
of fellow geeks attending a con and riffing on the mics.
This is the joy you hear in these podcasts. A love and a passion for all things geek. 
(There it is again! The P word — passion.)320 PART 6 The Part of Tens

The photo shows Tee Morris and Jack Mangan interviewing Battlestar Galactica’s Richard 
Hatch in February 2006 at Farpoint, a science fiction convention in Baltimore, Maryland. 
You’ll notice that Richard is wearing a coat. He wasn’t cold. He had a plane to catch, but 
he made time before leaving to sit down and talk on the mic about his experience 
between the BSG of the 1970s and of the 2000s. With Battlestar Galactica being a hot 
property once again, it was a real treat for Tee and Jack, two fans of both renditions of 
the epic space opera, for Richard to give them time, but how did they do it? How did two 
podcasters — at a time when podcasting was still a new media — land an interview with 
one of BSG’s regular players?
Simple: Tee asked.
We go into more detail on approaching people about interviews in Chapter 6, but some￾times opportunities present themselves in the moment. Nothing is wrong with asking 
celebrities, subject matter experts, and special guests relevant to your podcast if they 
have a few minutes to talk. The worst thing a potential guest could say to you is “No.” 
(And if they do, they’re not being jerks. They have somewhere to be or a pocket of time 
to get something to eat.) But if they say “yes,” be ready to go with solid, intelligent 
questions.

Podcasts about . . . Podcasting
It may sound redundant and feel a little odd to listen to a podcast about podcast￾ing. It would be like having an electrician come over to another electrician’s house 
to fix faulty electric wiring. But why not?
» The Feed (https://pfdbook.link/thefeed): When it comes to podcast tutors, 
you want to work with people who have trustworthy track records (and thank you 
for trusting us!). And when it comes to trustworthy track records, Elsie Escobar, 
Rob Walch, and LibSyn are responsible for many podcasts available today. The 
Feed (shown in Figure 18-5) is LibSyn’s official podcast, covering podcast strategy, 
tips, media hosting, and all things LibSyn. (See Chapter 3 for more.) The Feed is a 
community-driven show, so their topics go beyond getting a podcast off the

Ten Original Podcasters
Most readers are likely new to podcasting and missed out on the trials and 
tribulations that went along with first huge growth spurt between 2004 
and 2005. It was truly undiscovered country not only for Chuck and Tee 
but also for the people listed in this chapter, recognized as some of the original 
voices who have stood the test of time. While some of these OPs (original podcast￾ers) may not still have their original shows, they continue to produce content. (We 
regret that we couldn’t include in this chapter all the other talented OPs, and we 
want to acknowledge their hard work, persistence, and content, which continues 
to find subscriptions in podcast client apps everywhere.)
As you read these names, try to remember that these are regular people like the 
rest of us. True, some of them may seem larger than life, but all of them put their 
pants on one leg at a time — unless they’re wearing kilts.
A future podcast star would do well to listen to the wisdom, information, and 
rants put forth by this group. Often controversial and usually informative, each 
has a unique outlook on the world of podcasting. We’ve found them to be helpful

Mignon Fogarty
Mignon, better known as “Grammar Girl” to her listeners, is a master. Her deliv￾ery and experience are why Chuck and Tee asked her to kick off the third edition 
of Podcasting For Dummies. She has taken the topic of English grammar, something 
most would find mundane — and many think they have mastered only to find 
they learn something new in every episode — and turned it in to a podcast empire.
Trivia time! What was Mignon Fogarty’s first podcast? If you said Grammar Girl,
you ’ve chosen poorly. She had a podcast in 2005 called Absolute Science co-hosted 
with Adam Lowe. That show ran for about eight months and taught her some val￾uable lessons.
Mignon’s breakout show, Grammar Girl’s Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing
(https://pfdbook.link/grammargirl), started in 2006 and received numerous 
acclaims and recognition, such as reaching #2 on iTunes’s most recommended 
podcasts list. As she describes it, “It will help you improve your writing and 
delight you with the quirks of language.” Her grammar show has since turned into 
a Quick and Dirty Tips network featuring topics such as productivity by the “Get-It￾Done Guy,” Steve Robbins; money and finance by the “Money Girl,” Laura Adams; 
and even parenting by the “Mighty Mommy,” Cheryl Butler. Mignon even got her 
old co-host, Adam Lowe from Absolute Science, back to be the original “Modern 
Manners Guy.” She’s been featured in the Wall Street Journal and on The Oprah Win￾frey Show and The Today Show. Twice.
Like many podcasters, Mignon’s audience is not contained to the United States — 
take that, terrestrial radio! She receives feedback from all over the globe, again not 
unusual but always appreciated. Many of the comments are from teachers using 
her episodes to teach English as a second, third, or fourth, language.
Her podcast gave birth to the book Grammar Girl’s Quick and Dirty Tips for Better 
Writing (Holt) in 2008, which reached number 9 on the New York Times Bestseller 
List. In 2020, her Grammar Girl Presents the Ultimate Writing Guide for Students was 
Macmillan’s No. 1 bestselling nonfiction book at Barnes & Noble, and in 2023 the 
Grammar Girl podcast celebrated 18 years of podcasting with close to 1,000 
episodes produced.
When asked why she continues to podcast, the unsurprising answer is, “I really 
love it. I get to learn new things along with the listeners, and it’s always great 
when I hear how I helped someone. That happens almost every week. What could 
be better than that?” Mignon Fogarty is one of the lucky few who get to earn a 
living by podcasting.CHAPTER 19 Ten Original Podcasters 325
Adam Curry
In 1987, your authors were finishing school and MTV (the icon of the generation 
that remembers when they played music videos) hired a new VJ named Adam 
Curry. Decades later, despite life experiences, diplomas, and other strange changes 
and artistic ventures, it’s still baffling to think that the same guy who was intro￾ducing the latest Madonna video is now referred to as “the Podfather.”
Adam Curry’s importance to the craft might be the single best example to illus￾trate the just-do-it nature of podcasting. It was Adam Curry, not some highly 
trained programmer, who hacked together the first podcatching client program to 
harness the power of the recently created enclosed-media files in RSS 2.0 feeds — 
and made them downloadable during the computer’s off hours.
Since that time, Adam has become the most recognized (and arguably the most 
popular) podcaster around. While his first podcast, Daily Source Code, has pod￾faded, Curry continues to produce No Agenda (https://pfdbook.link/noagenda), 
co-hosted with John C.  Dvorak. No Agenda listeners never know quite what to 
expect: a tour of Adam’s kitchen, the latest round of talks in a business venture, 
or a discussion with a content partner that could change the shape of podcasting. 
Everything and anything is possible.
Mur Lafferty
Mur Lafferty (https://pfdbook.link/murlafferty) or “The Grand Dame of 
Podcasting,” as we refer to her with great affection, began her podcasting career 
with Geek Fu Action Grip, a show that was an ongoing commentary about what was 
going on in her life, what games she was playing, and what bands she was listen￾ing to. Each episode of Geek Fu ended with an original essay regarding something 
that struck her funny bone. This podcast spawned I Should Be Writing, the 2007 
Parsec-winning podcast documenting her own tests and trials in getting her first 
novel published. As proof of her talent, she has been a finalist or a Parsec Award 
winner in 2008, 2010, and 2011. She was a finalist for a Hugo Award in 2012 and 
won a Hugo award in the category of John W. Campbell award for Best New Writer 
of 2013. In 2018 she was again nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine 
as editor of Escape Pod.
Keeping many of her podcasts to the basics, Mur produces quality content from 
both sides of the brain: the analytical (I Should Be Writing) and the creative (The 
Heaven series, Playing for Keeps). Mur raises the bar for other creative podcasters, 
inspiring many to podcast their own fiction and even return to a writing passion 
they had stepped away from for many years.326 PART 6 The Part of Tens
It’s hard to listen to podcasts and not hear the name Mur Lafferty. It’s harder still 
to subscribe to any Mur Lafferty podcast and not be completely taken by her. Her 
personality shines in every episode, with every work, and with every show.
Steve Boyett
Like many featured in this chapter, Steve Boyett’s background was not in radio, 
broadcasting, audio engineering, or even computers. Instead, Steve’s early inter￾ests were in writing; he boasts several books, short stories, and novellas to his 
name. Go look him up at https://pfdbook.link/steveboyett! Several years 
ago — okay, maybe more than several — he started composing electronic music 
for fun and began DJing at parties, which he refers to as “straight-up crack.”
Almost like the proverbial accidental invention, Steve stumbled on to his fate. 
“Because I’m a writer, I was considering a fiction or interview podcast. Doing a 
music podcast hadn’t occurred to me.” On a whim, he asked his girlfriend, an 
aerobics instructor and runner, if she thought anyone would be interested in some 
of the mixes he was producing. Her response was something like this: “Are you 
kidding? Do you know how much I used to pay for this as an aerobics teacher? It’s 
perfect!” So he launched Podrunner (https://pfdbook.link/podrunner), a regu￾lar, hour-long dose of fixed-tempo music for walkers, joggers, and runners, from 
beginner to competitor. There were plenty of music podcasts at the time, but Steve 
was the first to do a music series specifically for workouts.
At first he thought he might attract 50 people or so. Talk about underestimating 
your audience! iTunes featured his podcast a few days after it was listed, and his 
website crashed within days of Podrunner’s debut. It became so popular that it shot 
up and stayed in the Top 10 for about a year. That’s when he gave some serious 
thought to legitimize it or kill it. Thankfully, he chose to invest and continue.
At its height, Podrunner was commanding over 600,000 downloads a month, 
receiving sponsorship from Timex and the United States Navy. The podcast still 
produces new and original mixes, but for Steve, the benefits do not stop at the 
success of his BPS-bending compositions. “I have met people that I wouldn’t have 
otherwise met. A listener reached out to me and asked me if I’d be interested in 
DJing for a group of fire dancers at the annual Burning Man Festival, where they 
had sound-activated flame cannons, a 30-foot stage, and on and on. I said, ‘You 
had me at sound-activated flame cannons.’”
But the biggest reward he receives is from hearing how he helped people. Almost 
every week he gets a note about someone who lost 100 pounds thanks to his music, 
or a chemotherapy patient who said, “This got me out of my house and on the way CHAPTER 19 Ten Original Podcasters 327
to recovery.” And since the first edition of Podcasting For Dummies, Tee still takes 
Podrunner with him on 5K runs, 10K runs, and the odd half-marathon. Steve con￾tinues to make the finish line appear that much sooner for Tee.
When asked why he continues to podcast after all this time, at first Steve jokingly 
said, “I’m in complete denial about its influence on my life,” but later admitted, 
“It’s what I do. The thought of giving it up really bothers me, and when I do think 
about it, I think of those listeners whom I’ve helped.”
Adam Christianson
All superheroes have their origin story. Adam Christianson, the Clark Kent of Pod￾casting, is really the Superman who brought us Maccast (https://pfdbook.link/
maccast) for over 18 years. His story starts with a degree in printing. (That’s right, 
kids, the paper-and-ink kind of printing that came before the internet.) Adam has 
always nurtured an interest in Apple computers, dating to their introduction, and 
it just so happens that’s what his printing company was using. He became the de 
facto — and eventually official — IT guy. In the mid-90s, he discovered HTML 
and found himself interested in web development while learning all he could 
about Macs.
In late 2004, he was listening to some of the early shows and thought, “I need to 
find a Mac podcast to help pass the time on my hour-long.” Sadly, he found out 
that there were no Mac podcasts at the time.
(Insert screaming sound effects here.)
Inspired by The Dawn & Drew Show (https://pfdbook.link/dawnanddrew), Adam 
recognized how easy podcasting could be when he discovered that his favorite 
podcast was powered by a Logitech USB microphone and GarageBand. Adam 
thought, “I’ve got GarageBand — I’m halfway there!” On December 13, 2004, the 
Maccast was revealed to the world. As he states at the beginning of each episode, 
this was “the show for Mac geeks, by Mac geeks.”
That last part, “by Mac geeks,” is important to note because his intent was to cre￾ate a five- to ten-minute daily news show about all things Mac. Remember, this 
was before the days of the iPhone and iPad. Macintosh computers and early iPods 
were about all Apple had going at the time! What amazed Adam was that after his 
first episode, a listener emailed him with a technical question. This may not seem 
too crazy today, but in those days he wondered, “How did this guy even find my 
show?!” Back then, you generally found new shows by word of mouth — other 
podcasters or listeners mentioning you. It was as if he sent a message in a bottle 
and got a response back from across the ocean.328 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Later, Adam expanded the stories he covered to include a wider range of Apple 
products, but he still kept the name and tag line the same — mostly by listener 
request. The audience had also grown considerably, allowing Adam to be his own 
boss, splitting time between podcasting and web development — with the bulk of 
revenue coming from Maccast.
After talking to Adam, one quickly gets a sense of his humility. He’s not concerned 
with being perceived as the authority on Macs or having millions of listeners. His 
main motivation for doing the show is the sense of community and the feedback 
it generates. He considers Maccast a global user group where he does just as much 
learning as educating.
In December 2023, Adam retired his one-man Mac show to focus on family, but he 
hasn’t disappeared completely. As he was planning to retire Maccast, he was asked 
to be a third co-host on the Mac Geek Gab podcast (https://pfdbook.link/
macgeekgab). Keep up the great work, Mac of Steel!
Dave Slusher
Dave Slusher is one of those lucky individuals who happened to be at the right 
place at the right time. As he describes it, “I started podcasting partly out of con￾venience and dumb luck.” In 2004, he had been following the latest advancements 
of transferring and listening to audio files on the internet, but it wasn’t until 
Adam Curry’s first podcatching client written in AppleScript that things started to 
heat up for him. “It was only a matter of time before someone put it all together. 
The pieces were all there and sooner or later it was going to happen,” says Slusher. 
Once that happened, Dave got out the gear from his former radio gig and started 
Evil Genius Chronicles (https://pfdbook.link/egc) in late August 2004 — one day 
after Adam Curry started his Daily Source Code — which is now one of the three 
longest continually running podcasts.
When asked to describe his show, Dave’s response was, “It’s about music, tech￾nology, and culture — but I know that doesn’t sound too compelling.” Dave may 
not be the best at marketing with a description like that, but if you give a listen, 
you’ll realize his personality and perspectives on topics are what make Evil Genius 
Chronicles work. He conveys situations that affect him, digs for the deeper mean￾ing, and articulates it in a way that matters to the listener.
Another interesting aspect about EGC is that you never know what you’re going to 
get in each episode. Dave seems to fly in the face of convention and make the most 
of it. Remember when we advised you (in another chapter) to not shake up your 
show format too much or you’ll confuse your listeners? Well, let’s just say Dave CHAPTER 19 Ten Original Podcasters 329
has a four-letter response to that, but it may not work for everyone. One episode 
may be a combination of music and monologue, the next could be an interview 
with a comic book artist, and another could be a panel discussion with friends. It’s 
how he rolls and how his podcast thrives.
When asked why he continues to podcast, he said, “I can do whatever I want 
unfettered. My show, my format, my content. I’ll keep doing it while it’s still fun. 
Besides, as long as I continue, I still have the status of one of the longest running 
podcasts. When I stop, I’ll just become a footnote to history  — and nobody 
wants that.”
Scott Sigler
When it comes to the early days of podcasting fiction, Tee has been described as 
epic classical music like Wagner. Mark Jeffrey could be compared to Dave 
Brubeck’s style of jazz music. Then you have Scott Sigler (https://pfdbook.
link/scottsigler). He’s Metallica. The Black Album.
“I podcast because it’s the perfect vehicle for serialized fiction,” Sigler says of his 
decision to podcast his debut novel, Earthcore. He seeks not only to hook listeners 
with the format but also to keep them in suspense until next week’s episode: “My 
novels are long, with cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. That’s designed to 
keep you turning the page. With podcasts, you just have to wait for the next 
episode.”
Scott’s nostalgia for radio-style serials is not the only motivation behind his pod￾casts. “The amazing reaction I get from the listeners is the motivation,” he adds, 
acknowledging his loyal fan base, also known as Junkies. The fans showed Scott 
(along with print publishers Dragon Moon Press and Crown Publishing) how 
hooked they were when the podcast of Ancestor premiered in print. The book shot 
up Amazon charts to hit #1 in both Horror and Science Fiction. That was enough 
for Crown to approach Scott with a contract for another one of his podcasts, Infec￾tion (which the publisher retitled as Infected).
Scott has also achieved a spot on the coveted New York Times Bestseller List. He 
continues to deliver high-octane fiction crossing many genres, one podcast at a 
time, as part of Empty Set Entertainment. “To know that my fiction has enter￾tained thousands of people, helped them escape from their day-to-day lives, and 
just plain have some fun means the world to me. Is it a power trip? Sure! But 
knowing that I’ve delivered a great story and entertained someone is a fantastic 
feeling.”330 PART 6 The Part of Tens
Michael Butler
Original — that’s the word that comes to mind when talking to Michael Butler, 
host of the Rock and Roll Geek Show (https://pfdbook.link/rnrgeek). Before 
meeting Michael, you might have visions of a hard rockin’, loud-mouthed, swag￾gering, crazy man, only to find he’s a humble down-to-earth guy. He states, “I 
don’t listen to any other music podcasts because I don’t want to be influenced by 
them. I’d rather just do my own thing.”
Michael earns his place in this chapter because he’s somewhere in the first ten or 
so podcasters who immediately followed Adam Curry. He started in early 
September 2004 and hasn’t stopped since. At the time, he was playing in a band 
called American Heartbreak and running a blog for them. He came across Adam 
Curry’s audio blog and was inspired by what Adam was doing. Like many 
podcasters just dipping their toes in, he started with modest technology, talking 
into the built-in microphone on his laptop. Shortly afterward, he upgraded to a 
USB microphone and eventually got a mixer and a bit better recording equipment.
Michael describes his show as “A guy talking about music, playing music, review￾ing albums, and doing interviews.” Michael is very well known in the podosphere 
not because of the popularity of his show but because of his humbleness and quick 
wit. In fact, contrary to his on-air personality, he’s a quiet and shy person, often 
stating when he’s at social events, “I’m the quiet guy in the corner.” Get to know 
Michael Butler and you discover his resume includes working full time for Adam 
Curry and collaborations with many other podcasters, including Dave Slusher.
Despite the popularity of the Rock and Roll Geek Show, Michael doesn’t care about 
the numbers. In fact, he states, “My fans are probably some of the most loyal I 
have ever encountered.” Hardly an episode goes by where he doesn’t do a segment 
called “Opening Butler’s Mail” to find anything from cash to special hunting 
arrows that Ted Nugent uses. That’s some serious fandom! He continues to pod￾cast largely because of the fans and “It’s just fun to do.”
Rock on, Mr. Michael Butler! Rock on!
Dr. Pamela Gay
Let’s just go on record here — we think science is cool. Like Mignon Fogarty, 
Dr. Gay brought academics to the podcasting world with the right blend of educa￾tion and entertainment. Also like Grammar Girl, Dr. Gay’s hugely successful show 
Astronomy Cast (https://pfdbook.link/astronomycast) was not her first dip in CHAPTER 19 Ten Original Podcasters 331
the podpool. The birth of Pamela’s podcast universe started when she was on the 
way to a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in early 2005 and her 
friend Aaron Price said he was reading about this new thing called podcasting. He 
told her about some evangelicals doing a show to convert people, to which she 
replied, “We can convert people to science!” Within a week they had the first epi￾sode of Slacker Astronomy online. The show ran for about 18 months until life 
intervened, taking the show’s hosts in different directions.
Not one to let her podcasting passion sit idle, she quickly connected with colleague 
Fraser Cain and started Astronomy Cast, “A weekly facts-based journey through the 
cosmos where we help you understand not only what we know, but how we know 
what we know.” Great tag line, by the way!
Astronomy Cast, and its cousin podcast, 365 Days of Astronomy, have been finalists or 
winners of Parsec Awards from 2007 to 2012, and now Dr. Gay can be seen on 
occasion in episodes of The Universe explaining such topics as how the universe 
ends. She has also been a speaker at science and sci-fi conventions. Both on her 
podcast and in real life, Dr. Gay does not shy away from being a fan as well. “I was 
talking to Richard Hatch, the actor who played Apollo on the 1970s series Battlestar 
Gallactica, about the meteor that struck the Earth’s atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, 
Russia in 2013,” she recalls. “I was happy to share with him his intersection 
between science and science fiction. The meteor’s origins were from an Apollo 
asteroid.”
And she’s still not finished trying new things. In 2024, she’s collaborating with 
Tee on Spectres & Science. Tee brings his paranormal pursuits to the same table 
where Pamela offers science, and they find an unexpected common ground. 
“Here’s where the fun begins,” as Han Solo puts it so eloquently.
The “Dr.” in her title is her PhD in Astronomy from the University of Texas, so 
yes, she knows what she’s talking about. What’s even better is that her passion 
makes physics fun and interesting to listen to.
Brian Ibbott
We put Brian Ibbott in this list for two reasons: He’s one of the original music 
podcasters, and you might be thinking of starting your own music podcast. (Hey, 
lots of us wanted to be DJs when we were kids.) “It’s weird hearing my name 
associated with the word ‘original,’” jokes Ibbott. More importantly, Brian is a 
music podcaster who is doing it right — the legal way.332 PART 6 The Part of Tens
As we mention in Chapter 5, podcasting licensed music legally is a challenge. With 
his podcast Coverville (https://pfdbook.link/coverville), Brian works directly 
with ASCAP, BMI, musicians, and other organizations that hold the rights to 
major-label music and songs. Although many music podcasters are just a process 
server away from a major lawsuit, Brian is sitting pretty.
Brian also serves as an example of how to create a niche podcast out of the music 
you love and fill a void not covered by traditional outlets. Brian has a passion for 
cover songs and has built a show completely around songs that fit that bill. “I 
wanted to create a radio show that I always wanted to listen to,” he states. He took 
this concept a step further by featuring groups of cover songs sharing a common 
thread, thereby producing themed episodes of his podcast. He’s even started his 
own record label! Simply brilliant — we don’t know of any radio stations or pro￾grams that provide this service.
Brian also has a charitable heart. Each year on the last Friday in November (known 
as Black Friday to many) he does a 24-hour live-streaming marathon of cover 
songs, known simply as Cover-thon, to raise money for Alzheimer’s research.
And Coverville is still producing episodes to this day. What a legend, this guy!
Before you rush out to make the next hot music podcast, consider the legal rami￾fications. And while you’re pondering that, also ask whether your future podcast 
sounds like the same stuff people can listen to over their radios. Follow Brian’s 
lead and give the world something different with your podcast.Index 333

D.C./Virginia/Maryland metro area and an award-winning author of science￾fiction and fantasy. Tee’s 2002 historical epic fantasy, MOREVI: The Chronicles of

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Due to the complexity of the issue and the incredible growth in the community, it 
would be impossible to properly express our thanks to all the parties who were of 
great help with this book. So with that . . .To our wives, Donna and Pip: Thanks for not strangling us for our constant “Oh! 
We’ve got to add that to the book!” and “Come on, honey, we have to record this 
for the book!” moments. We deeply appreciate the averted gazes of death when we 
answered that no, unfortunately, we would not be coming to bed. No, we forgot to 
scoop the litter boxes because we had one more chapter to write. Yes, we did 
realize it was 3 o’clock in the morning.
To the podcasters who provided not only inspiration but also camaraderie and 
friendship along the way. Through listening to you all and talking to many, you 
served as a constant reminder of why we were pouring our hearts and souls into 
this text.
A huge thank you to Rob Walch, vice president of podcaster relations at LibSyn and 
host of the podcasts The Feed and Podcast 411. Not only did you keep us in the loop 
concerning recent changes and updates at LibSyn, but you continue to be a 
constant supporter of the podcasting community. You are a friend and an ally we 
can count on.
Finally, a special nod to Michael R. Mennenga for passing along an email back in 
2004 that opened a door to a world of time-shifting, kick-ass mystic ninjas, 
podiobooks, and science-fiction and fantasy geeks around the world interested 
in what we have to offer.Publisher’s Acknowledgments
