xixPreface
This edited book describes the “novel nanostructured materials for biosen￾sing applications.” At present, biosensors are the most useful device for
biomedical, industrial, food, agricultural, and environmental monitoring.
The chapters cover comprehensive information of new nanostructured
materialbased biosensors, from basic to real-time utilization. It gives a
complete account of nanostructured materialbased biosensors, recent
innovations, practical applicability, and so on, which will be helpful for
industrial sector, researchers, professors, and engineers.
This book includes the modification of electrochemical biosensors
with improved analytical properties and its real-world utilization has been
a hot topic today. The technology of developing the biosensor devices
has been increased in various fields including clinical diagnosis, food qual￾ity control, and environmental monitoring. Nanostructured materials have
provided great impact as an electrode material as they hold features such
as rich surface chemistry, strong absorption capacity, rapidity of response,
selectivity, and robustness. The nanostructured materials provided the
opportunities in creating the new innovations. Hence, they are widely
used as the electrode material in various sensors. Nanostructured materials
include inorganic, organic, carbon, and biomass-derived materials and
composite nanostructures. As there are numerous applications, the poten￾tial of bulk and surface modification is significant in the area of modern
analytical chemistry. Chemically modified biosensors have enthralled by
applying different modified materials due to their characteristics of getting
fast response times, amplified output, high sensitivity, and feasibility of
miniaturization.

1.1 Introduction
1.1.1 Nanomaterials and nanotechnology
Richard Feynman first explained the term nanotechnology in his classic
talk “There are plenty of rooms at the bottom” in 1961 (Feynman, 1992).
The Feynman vision projects the development of nanomaterials and
nanomachines with atom-by-atom control. Norio Taniguchi’s first use of
the word “nanotechnology” was at the International Conference on
Precision Engineering (ICPE) in 1974. His description indicated “produc￾tion technology to obtain extra high precision and ultrafine dimensions,
that is, accuracy and fine length of 1029 m on the order of 1 nm (nano￾meter)” (Whatmore, 1999). The materials whose components dimension
is less than 100 nm are called nanomaterials, and they exist in the form of
zero-, one-, two- and three-dimensional forms. Quantum dots, thin films,
nanowires, and nanotubes are the different forms of nanomaterials.
In science, nanotechnology is an important branch which deals with
designing, developing, producing, and applying nanomaterials in devices.
Various research-specialized fields are established, namely, nanomedication,
nanobiotechnology, nano-optics, nanoelectronics, and nanosensing. The list
of applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology varies from bucket to
rocket science. Interestingly, various applications attracted the researchers, as
the nanomaterials possess special properties which include dust-resistant paints,
sensors for humidity stabilization, and toxic gas detection sensors (Pratibha &
Chethan, 2022; Pratibha et al., 2020; Pratibha, Chethan, et al., 2020).
The grain size plays a major contribution in the nanomaterials exhibiting
some exotic and exciting material properties. The shape, size, and dispersal of
the atoms in nanomaterials also have a greater impact on the material

All rights reserved.properties (Feynman, 1992; Mishra et al., 2007; Whatmore, 1999; Vollata,
2013). The surface area and volume of the atom change in proportion to the
particle’s shrinking size. Therefore the ratio of surface to volume is high; as a
result, a more number of atoms are accumulated on the surface of the mate￾rial. Consequently, a greater number of atoms are directly exposed to the
externally induced effects which greatly affect the chemical and physical
properties of the nanomaterials (Salah, 2011). Appropriate regulation of the
properties and the reaction of the nanomaterials lead to novel devices and
technologies. The variation in physical, chemical, and optical properties with
variation in size, shape, and distribution of particles has developed the keen
interest of researchers in the field of nanomaterials and their applications
(Pushpanjali et al., 2020; Raril & Manjunatha, 2018).
For the last three to four decades, technologists are trying to apply these
nanomaterials in the field of science, technology, medical, biological, and
environmental applications due to their excellent physical and chemical prop￾erties such as electrical, magnetic, thermal, optical, and mechanical properties
(Amrutha et al., 2019; Charithra & Manjunatha, 2019, 2021; Hareesha et al.,
2021; Manjunatha, 2019). The day-to-day applications of nanomaterials are
optical telecommunications, image processing, digital memory storage, pho￾tonics, logic circuits, bio-photonic, magnetic data storage, magneto-electronic
devices, biotechnology, and medicine (Begum et al., 2022; Pratibha,
Chethan, et al., 2020; Pratibha et al., 2022; Pratibha & Chethan, 2022;
Pratibha & Dhananjaya, 2023; Yashaswini et al., 2021). Also, flat-panel dis￾plays with low-energy excitation sources, cathode ray tubes, bio-labeling,
solar energy converters, optical amplifiers, as catalysts, thermoluminescence
dosimeter (TLD), phosphors, sensors, coating materials and miniaturization of
devices, limiting the emission of pollutants, cleaning up contaminants in soil
and water, sunscreen lotions, automotive, etc., are some of the major appliac￾tions of nanomaterials. (Ditcovski et al., 2010; Lakshminarasimhan &
Varadaraju, 2008; Rodriguez-Viejo et al., 1997; Shea., 1998; Snyders et al.,
2006; Yang et al., 1998).
The inorganic nanomaterials, like semiconductors, insulators, poly￾mers, composites, etc., exhibit fascinating size- and shape-dependent
properties like high crystallinity, conductivity, structural constancy, promi￾nent luminescence, lower melting, and boiling point because of their
quantum confinement effect (McKittrick et al., 1999). Therefore the size￾and shape-dependent properties of the nanomaterials have made the
researchers think about the development/preparation of the
nanomaterials.
4 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsNanomaterials possess two major properties:
• Size impact: The bulk material has continuous energy levels
(extended periodicity of lattice) that will get altered by a set of distinct
energy levels (quantum confinement effect).
• The surface/interface-generated effects: The ratio between sur￾face and volume gets increased as the dimensions get reduced leading
to the availability of a significant number of atoms on the surface with
different chemical environments compared to the bulk material.
The surface plasma resonance (SPR) phenomenon allows the metallic
NPs to reveal the size-dependent optical properties same as that of semicon￾ducting quantum dots (QDs). This effect is because of the mutual oscillations
of the conduction band electrons and further protuberant in the case of noble
metals Ag and Au NPs (Barnes et al., 2003). The incident light excites the
electrons, and the related oscillations interact with the electromagnetic radia￾tions producing an improved electromagnetic field leading to the scattering
and absorption of light (Klabunde & Richards, 2009).
1.2 Classification of nanoparticles
Nanomaterials are classified into various types based on their morphology,
size, and chemical and physical properties. Carbon-based nanomaterials,
polymeric nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles, semiconductor nanomater￾ials, ceramic nanomaterials, and others are just a handful of them. The
inorganic solids that make up ceramic nanomaterials are oxides, carbo￾nates, phosphates, carbides, and other compounds. These nanoparticles
have high thermal resistance and chemical inertness (Prinith et al., 2019).
The classification of nanoparticles based on their size, shape, composition,
and surface properties, which can affect their properties and applications, is
briefed as follows:
1. Size-based classification:
Nanoparticles can be classified based on their size, typically into the
following categories:
• Ultrafine particles or nanoparticles (between 1 and 100 nm),
• Nanocrystals (between 2 and 100 nm), and
• Nanoclusters or quantum dots (between 2 and 10 nm).
2. Shape-based classification:
Nanoparticles can be classified based on their shape, which can affect
their properties and applications. Some common shapes include:
• Triangular nanoparticles,
Fundamentals of nanostructured materials and synthetic routes 5• Octahedral nanoparticles,
• Rod-shaped nanoparticles,
• Spherical nanoparticles, and
• Cube-shaped nanoparticles.
3. Composition-based classification:
Nanoparticles can be classified based on their composition, which can
affect their properties and applications. Some common types of nanoparti￾cles include:
• Carbon nanoparticles (e.g., fullerenes, carbon nanotubes),
• Magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., iron oxide),
• Semiconductor nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots), and
• Metal nanoparticles (e.g., gold, silver, platinum).
4. Surface-based classification:
Nanoparticles can also be classified based on their surface properties,
such as their charge or functional groups. This can affect their interaction
with biological systems and their ability to bind to specific molecules.
Some examples include:
• Anionic nanoparticles (negatively charged),
• Cationic nanoparticles (positively charged),
• Functionalized nanoparticles (with specific functional groups), and
• Neutral nanoparticles.
1.3 Synthesis of nanoparticles
As discussed earlier, nanoparticles are extremely small particles, measured
in nanometers (nm). One nanometer (1 nm 5 1029 m) is one billionth of
a meter. They can be found in both natural and artificial forms. They are
bigger than atoms but smaller than solid particles. As a result, they exhibit
Brownian motion rather than following quantum theory. They have uses
in a variety of fields, including pharmaceuticals, catalysis, engineering,
environmental remediation, industrial manufacture, etc. (Hasan, 2015;
Khan et al., 2019; Liu, 2006; Manjunatha, Nagabhushana, Adarsha, et al.,
2019; Manjunatha, Nagabhushana, Raghu, et al., 2019; Saravanan et al.,
2021), due to their small size and huge surface area. Nanoparticles are
complex in nature and are mainly constituted of three layers:
• The core layer: This is the most important and fundamental component
of the nanoparticle and exhibits all of its exceptional characteristics.
• The shell layer: This sandwiched layer, unlike the core, is composed
of separate chemical constituents.
6 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications• The surface layer: This is the top layer, can function in the presence
of polymers, metal ions, and tiny molecules, and is the layer that is
most exposed.
The primary factor determining a nanomaterials’ physical characteris￾tics and potential uses is its fabrication process. So picking the appropriate
synthetic pathway for designing nanomaterials is what motivates many of
the recently developing methodologies. This sparked the creation of
numerous adaptable and effective techniques for making nanomaterials.
When using different techniques to create nanoparticles, there are two
basic strategies that are used. Fig. 1.1 explains the two synthesis
techniques.
1.4 Top-down approach
Top-down approaches involve the reduction of bulk materials into nano￾particles using mechanical, chemical, or thermal methods. The
mechanical-physical particle manufacturing process is another name for
this technique. In this technique, a large particle is crushed into smaller
particles that can be used as nanoparticles by applying a lot of force. These
top-down methods often produce nanoparticles with a wide size distribu￾tion and limited control over particle shape. For example, ball milling,
crushing, grinding, milling, lithographic cutting methods, chemical vapor
deposition, and physical vapor deposition can all be used to achieve this.
The creation of ceramic and metal-based nanoparticles is accomplished
using this method.
Figure 1.1 Approaches involved in nanoparticle synthesis. Strategies used in differ￾ent techniques of nanoparticle synthesis.
Fundamentals of nanostructured materials and synthetic routes 71.5 Bottom-up approach
The building-up process is another name for this approach. This process
involves creating larger particles from smaller particles, such as atoms, mole￾cules, and nanoparticles. This is based on the creation of a complex particle
through the assembly of a number of tiny particles. This approach often
involves the use of chemical or physical methods to control the size, shape,
and composition of the nanoparticles. Common bottom-up methods includ￾ing spinning, chemical vapor deposition, solgel synthesis, electrochemical
synthesis, and biological synthesis can all be used to accomplish this.
Nanoparticles produced using green and biological processes are economical
and environmentally beneficial. Metal oxide nanoparticles and metal nano￾spheres are made using this method. Table 1.1 briefs about different examples
of nanoparticles prepared using different methods.
According to the literature, metal ion interaction kinetics and adsorp￾tion processes have a significant impact on various morphological features,
such as size, shape, and stability. In order to build or scale up a new syn￾thesis method, it is now important to do so by manipulating the physico￾chemical parameters. There are numerous approaches to creating
nanoparticles. A few of the numerous synthesis techniques which are
most preferred by the researchers are discussed as shown in Fig. 1.2.
Also, the synthesis of nanoparticles is classified into two types based on
the medium used while preparing nanoparticles.

8 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications1.5.1 Wet chemical methods
Wet chemical methods are a common and widely used approach for syn￾thesizing nanoparticles. These methods involve the use of a liquid
medium, typically water or an organic solvent, to dissolve or disperse the
precursor materials and induce nucleation and growth of nanoparticles.
Here are some examples of wet chemical methods.
1.5.1.1 Solgel process
A bottom-up strategy is employed in the solgel process, a technique for
creating colloidal nanoparticles. This method involves the preparation of a
solution of metal salts, which is then hydrolyzed to form a gel. The gel is
then heated to form nanoparticles. This method is versatile and can be used
for various materials. The solgel method involves the preparation of a sol (a
colloidal suspension of nanoparticles in a liquid) followed by gelation to form
a three-dimensional network. The gel is then dried and calcined to form
nanoparticles. Alkoxides and alkoxysilanes must be used as metal ion precur￾sors in order to do this. Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and tetraethoxysilane
(TEOS) are the two precursors that are utilized the most frequently. This
method is particularly useful for producing ceramics, glasses, and metal oxides.
It has many uses, including the manufacturing of injectable nanocomposites
like plasminogen activator entrapped in alumina, protective nanoparticle coat￾ings, optical and refractory ceramic fiber fabrication, nanoscale powders, and
sintered ceramic nanomaterials (Bokov et al., 2021).
Figure 1.2 Nanoparticle synthesis methods. Different methods of synthesis.
Fundamentals of nanostructured materials and synthetic routes 91.5.1.2 Solution combustion synthesis
Solution combustion synthesis (SCS) is an important technique for the
synthesis and processing of nanomaterials. It is an exothermic reduction
and oxidation reaction involving an oxidizer and a fuel in a controlled
way. At a very high temperature, the reaction occurs by ejecting huge
heat making the reaction system self-sustained (Pratibha et al., 2023). It is
the more economical, easy, and relatively fast phenomenon of preparing
highly phase pure nanopowders involving comparatively simple instru￾ments than other methods. The stoichiometry, structural composition,
and homogeneity of the end products are controllable. Also, it is easy to
scale up the yield. The limitations of the SCS method include the
agglomerated end products, the enormous release of toxic gases during
the usage of organic fuels, and the poor control over the exothermic reac￾tion the explosion may occur. Different parameters, such as water content,
fuel, the release of gaseous products, and flame temperature during the
combustion process influence the SCS reaction (Pratibha et al., n.d.;
Pratibha, Chethan, et al., 2020; Pratibha et al., 2020a, 2020b; Pratibha
et al., 2019, 2020a, 2022).
1.5.1.3 Green and biological synthesis
Emerging methods for more efficient nanoparticle production should be
less expensive, easier to make, and environmentally benign. Therefore
biosynthesis and green synthesis are the preferable manufacturing methods
for them. Plants and plant extracts appear to be a decent alternative
among all the biological options because they are readily available, need￾less upkeep, and are less expensive to produce. This method of synthesis
involves the use of natural resources such as plant extracts, microorgan￾isms, enzymes, microbes, protists, and algae as biological agents that can
be exploited to synthesize nanoparticles. The size and shape of the nano￾particles can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as
pH and temperature. This method is eco-friendly, cost-effective, and does
not require toxic chemicals. This process involves mixing a metal salt with
plant extract and letting it sit for a few hours at room temperature. This
causes the metal salt to dissolve into the appropriate nanoparticles. Green
synthesis can produce nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and shapes,
and the properties of the nanoparticles can be tailored by selecting differ￾ent natural resources with lower purity or control over size and shape
(Begum et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2022; Pratibha et al., 2020).
10 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications1.5.1.4 Solvothermal/hydrothermal method
This method involves heating a precursor solution in a sealed vessel at
high temperature and pressure, inducing rapid nucleation and growth of
nanoparticles. The size and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled
by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as solvent type, temperature,
and pressure. The solvent’s boiling point is raised by the pressure that is
created in the vessel as a result of solvent vapors. Solvents including etha￾nol, toluene, water, and other substances are frequently used in solvother￾mal processes. Water pressure, temperature, reaction time, precursors, and
other variables can be changed during the synthesis of nanocrystals to
maintain a high nucleation rate that results in the creation of particles
with a homogeneous size distribution. The high temperature, high pres￾sure created during the reaction, and lack of flexibility for managing the
nucleation and growth processes are the key drawbacks of this approach.
This method can produce nanoparticles with high purity and controlled
size but may require specialized equipment (Liu et al., 2022).
1.5.1.5 Chemical reduction
In this method, metal ions are reduced to form nanoparticles using a
reducing agent. This method is simple, but it may require toxic chemicals.
Chemical reduction is one of the most commonly used methods for syn￾thesizing metal nanoparticles. In this method, a reducing agent is added to
a solution of metal ions to reduce them to form nanoparticles. The size
and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the concen￾tration of the reducing agent, the pH of the solution, and the reaction
time (Daruich De Souza et al., 2019).
1.5.1.6 Electrochemical synthesis
In this method, metal ions are reduced at the surface of an electrode to
form nanoparticles. This method is simple and can produce a large quantity
of nanoparticles. Electrochemical synthesis involves the use of an electric
current to reduce metal ions at the surface of an electrode to form nanopar￾ticles. The size and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting
the potential, current, and pH of the electrolyte (Yan et al., 2021).
1.5.1.7 Microemulsion method
In this method, a microemulsion of water, oil, and surfactant is used to
form nanoparticles. This method is useful for producing nanoparticles
with a narrow size distribution. The microemulsion method involves the
Fundamentals of nanostructured materials and synthetic routes 11use of a microemulsion, which is a stable, transparent, and isotropic liquid
system consisting of water, oil, and surfactant. The microemulsion acts as
a reaction medium for the synthesis of nanoparticles. This method can
produce nanoparticles with narrow size distribution and high stability
(Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2019).
1.5.1.8 Microwave-assisted synthesis
This method involves using microwave radiation to heat a reaction mix￾ture and induce rapid nucleation and growth of nanoparticles. The size
and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the micro￾wave power and reaction time. This method is relatively fast and efficient
but may require specialized equipment (Kheradmandfard et al., 2021).
1.5.1.9 Emulsion polymerization
This method involves dispersing monomer droplets in an aqueous
medium containing a surfactant and initiator, which are then polymerized
to form nanoparticles. The size and shape of the nanoparticles can be con￾trolled by adjusting the monomer concentration and reaction conditions.
This method can produce nanoparticles with high purity and controlled
size but may require specialized equipment (Jenjob et al., 2019).
1.5.2 Dry chemical methods
Dry methods are another group of techniques for synthesizing nanoparti￾cles. These methods do not involve a liquid medium and instead rely on
gas-phase reactions or solid-state reactions to form nanoparticles. Here are
some examples of dry methods.
1.5.2.1 Mechanical grinding/ball milling
The mechanical milling method is a top-down strategy where large struc￾tural particles are broken down into coarse particles using grinders. It
involves milling a mixture of precursor powders in a ball mill to induce
solid-state reactions that form nanoparticles. The size and shape of the
nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the milling parameters, such
as ball size, milling speed, and reaction time. This method can produce
nanoparticles with high purity and controlled size but may require long
milling times. Mechanical, thermal, and centrifugal forces are all used in
this process. This technique produces broad-sized nanoparticles with sizes
between 10 and 1000 nm. They are used to create bulk materials with
nanoscale grains and nanocomposites. For this procedure, a variety of mills
12 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsare available, including vibrating ball mills, attrition mills, planetary ball
mills, high-energy mills, and mills that use low levels of energy (Krishna.
& Patel, 2019).
1.5.2.2 Laser ablation
A high-beam laser is used in the laser ablation process to remove layers of
solid metals. The metal surface is exposed to radiation by the laser beam,
which irradiates it. It also employs the top-down method, which entails
utilizing a laser beam to vaporize the metal’s surface. The wavelength,
intensity, and pulse length of the laser beam all affect how things break
down (Rafique et al., 2019).
1.5.2.3 Electro-explosion
Another top-down strategy is electro-explosion, which involves passing a
strong pulsed current over a thin metal wire, which causes the metal ions in
the wire to explode. Using a pulsed discharge mechanism, a significant
quantity of heat is transferred into the wire, melting the metal ions and ion￾izing them. Basically, this process is utilized to make metallic nanopowders.
Electrochemical synthesis involves the reduction of metal ions at the surface
of an electrode to form nanoparticles (Hashemzadeh et al., 2020).
1.5.2.4 Chemical vapor deposition
Solid metal is deposited on another hot metal surface utilizing a separate
chemical reaction in the vapor or gas phase in a process known as chemi￾cal vapor deposition (CVD), which is a bottom-up method. CVD
involves the decomposition of a precursor gas to form nanoparticles on a
substrate. This process needs extra activation energy to start the chemical
reaction, which a high temperature (1000°C) can deliver. A gas supply
system, a deposition chamber, and an exhaust system make up the bulk of
the CVD device. In the creation of nanocomposites, CVD is useful
(Saeed et al., 2020).
1.5.2.5 Physical vapor deposition
Physical vapor deposition (PVD) involves the evaporation of metal atoms
in a vacuum, which then condenses on a substrate to form nanoparticles.
This method is useful for producing nanoparticles with controlled size and
shape. PVD involves the use of high-energy physical processes such as
thermal evaporation, sputtering, or laser ablation to deposit metal atoms
onto a substrate to form nanoparticles. This method can produce
Fundamentals of nanostructured materials and synthetic routes 13nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution and precise control over the
shape and composition of the nanoparticles (Jamkhande et al., 2019).
1.5.2.6 Solvent-free synthesis
This method involves mixing dry precursor powders and inducing solid￾state reactions to form nanoparticles. The size and shape of the nanoparti￾cles can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as tem￾perature and pressure. This method can be used to synthesize a wide
range of materials, including metals, oxides, and sulfides. The process typi￾cally involves mixing dry precursor powders and heating the mixture to
induce solid-state reactions. The temperature, pressure, and duration of
the reaction can be controlled to produce nanoparticles of different sizes
and shapes. Solvent-free synthesis can be a cost-effective method for
large-scale nanoparticle production (Landge et al., 2018).
1.5.2.7 Photochemical synthesis
This method involves using light to induce chemical reactions that form
nanoparticles. The size and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled
by adjusting the light intensity and wavelength, as well as the reaction
conditions. This method can produce nanoparticles with high purity and
controlled size but may require expensive light sources (Jara et al., 2021).
1.5.2.8 Ion implantation
This method involves using ion beams to implant atoms or ions into a
substrate material, forming nanoparticles in the substrate. The size and
shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the ion
energy and implantation dose. This method can produce nanoparticles
with unique properties but may require specialized equipment
(Stepanov, 2010).
1.5.2.9 Flame spray synthesis
This method involves spraying a precursor solution into a high￾temperature flame, causing rapid nucleation and growth of nanoparticles.
The size and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the
spray conditions, precursor concentration, furnace, and flame temperature.
This method can produce nanoparticles with high purity and controlled
size but may require specialized equipment (De Iuliis et al., 2019).
14 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications1.5.2.10 Electrospinning
This method involves spinning a polymer solution through an electric
field to form nanofibers, which can then be processed into nanoparticles.
The size and shape of the nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the
spinning parameters, such as solution concentration and electric field
strength. This method can produce nanoparticles with unique properties
but may require specialized equipment.
Dry methods offer several advantages over wet chemical methods,
including higher purity and control over nanoparticle morphology.
However, they may require specialized equipment and may be limited in
the types of materials that can be synthesized. Additionally, dry methods
are often more expensive than wet methods due to the cost of equipment
and energy consumption (Zhang & Yu, 2014).
1.6 Conclusion
In summary, there are many methods for synthesizing nanoparticles, each
with its advantages and disadvantages which involves a combination of top￾down and bottom-up approaches to control the size, shape, and composition
of nanoparticles. The choice of method depends on the desired properties
such as surface chemistry and stability of the nanoparticles, as well as practical
considerations like cost, scalability, and environmental impact.

2.1 Introduction
Electrochemical analysis, in comparison with other disclosure
approaches such as chromatography, luminescence, and spectroscopy, is
a simple and profitable approach with advantages in terms of usability,
precision, and steadiness for determining the amounts of electroactive
species in a solution, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Analytical
methods engaged include cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse vol￾tammetry, chronoamperometry, linear sweep voltammetry, and strip￾ping voltammetry. They are completely useful electroanalytical
procedures when they have been refined for the best electrochemical
response. The type of the analyte held down examination, the kind of
electrode utilized, and the electrolyte employed can all influence these
processes. The area and structure of the electrode, as well as the
method of fabricating, can affect the system’s voltammetric response.
Electroanalysis processes take into account the chemical-physical
properties of electrode surfaces, as well as the consequence of the
exerted potential, adsorption, and coverings utilized to the electrode
surface to improve sensing. Carbon compounds are often accustomed
to electroanalytical inspection due to their chemical passivity, compara￾tively vast potential window, poor background current, and adaptabil￾ity for diverse modes of evaluation. Other electrode constituents, such

Chandra, 2018).
2.2 Neurotransmitters, neurochemicals as biomolecules
Biological beings are made up of a variety of macromolecules and small
molecules. Micromolecules include metabolites, fatty acids, neurotransmit￾ters, amino acids, vitamins, and hormones, while supermolecules include
proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and enzymes. Biomolecule research
contributes to a better understanding of their basic physiological functions
in the human body’s healthy growth and development. Endogenous and
exogenous biomolecules are involved in a wide range of biological prac￾tices, including loading and diffusing genomic evidence, controlling bio￾logical/neurological activity, conveying lesser molecules/hormones, and
catalyzing biochemical reactions.
Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemical messengers that operate as
signal transducers between neurons and nonneuronal somatic cells, allow￾ing information to travel all over the brain and body via chemical synap￾ses. These vital substances are generated by several secretors, including the
pituitary, pineal, and adrenal glands. Before clumping together at neuronal
terminals, NTs are naturally maintained in vesicles. NTs are released from
synapses and proceed over the festering gap, where they join to acceptors
on the surface of neighboring neurons or cells, activating them. As a
result, the neurite end of the other neuron is activated, similarly releasing
NTs in order to form a connection with the following neuron. As a
result, neurons respond biologically, setting off a complex cascade of
events (Mele et al., 2010).
The first neurotransmitter was discovered in 1921, and myriads of
chemical transporters involved in colligation communication were discov￾ered after that. Among the several NTs, biogenic amines such as dopa￾mine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, as well as amino acids
such as tyrosine and acetylcholine, may play a role. Essential nervous sys￾tem functions such as behavior and cognition were mediated by NTs.
They control and regulate muscle tone, heart rate, slumbering, under￾standing, cognizance, rumination, appetite, and temperament (Baranwal &
Chandra, 2018).
Changes in NTs amounts in the central nervous system (CNS) have
been linked to Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s disorders, as well
22 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsas schizophrenia, epilepsy, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, glaucoma,
thyroid hormone deficiency, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), anxiety,
and depression. Because extracellular quantities of neurotransmitters are low
and concentrations can change quickly, in vivo measurements are difficult
(Kurian et al., 2011). Many other electroactive neurochemicals, in addition
to neurotransponders, exist in the brain and can intrude with neurotrans￾mitter investigation. As a result, quantifying NTs concentrations in human
fluids is crucial for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic interven￾tions. Some of the most common methods for determining the NT con￾centrations include fluorimetry, chemiluminescence, chromatography, mass
spectrometry (MS), and capillary electrophoresis (CE).
The majority of the treatments discussed have been demonstrated to
be time-consuming and exorbitant, with complex pretreatment steps; yet,
they have strong sensibility and specificity, as well as low limit of detec￾tion (LOD). Furthermore, for on-site monitoring studies, these solutions
are ineffective. Electrochemical detectors are propitious for surveilling
neurotransmitters or neurochemicals because they provide great selectivity
and fast responsiveness, as well as high precision and reproducibility. They
also provide a broad array of linear reactions, little sensing limitations, and
apparent time assessment that produce data quickly, as well as the ability
to detect two or more chemicals at the same time. Furthermore, in thera￾peutic and diagnostic research, this type of sensor can be used for on-spot
determination and can be incorporated with powerful, handy, or micro￾scopic tools.
Beyond CNTs, the latest study gained concentration on employing a
variety of novel forms of carbon nanostructured materials. Reduced gra￾phene oxide, carbon nanohorns, graphene nanofoams, graphene nanorods,
and graphene nanoflowers, as well as crystalline diamond and diamond￾like carbon, are nowadays progressively popular for sensors. Carbon
nanostructures, including graphene, have outstanding electrochemical
properties, leading to their widespread use. The unique carbon-derived
nanostructures have features not present in bulk materials; therefore, their
potential in sensing applications is clear. As a result, they can operate with
greater sensitivity and selectivity across a larger temperature and dynamic
range, not just in harsh environments. Previously, a range of materials,
including platinum, gold, and several types of metals, have been utilized
as electrode materials for electrochemical sensing (Dresselhaus et al., 2004;
Wang & Liu, 2012). In the recent years, carbon polymorphs including
graphene, carbon nanotube, and diamond have become popular as
Material-based electrochemical biosensing systems 23electrode materials for electrochemical sensing. The analytes in this chap￾ter included neurotransmitters and neurochemicals including dopamine,
ascorbic acid, and serotonin, as well as hydrogen peroxide, proteins like
biomarkers, and DNA.
2.2.1 Carbon nanotubes
Formerly, Sumio Iijima has discovered carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in 1991
(Ko et al., 2006; Brian, 1991). CNTs are graphene cylinders that have been
folded up. The number of cylinders stacked into each other, as well as the
specific sp2 hybridized carbon lattice, governs their properties (Mele et al.,
2010). Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (MWNTs) are two structural types of CNTs that have usages in
a variety of areas, including composite materials, nanoelectronics, energy
research, and biomedicine. CNTs have photosensitive and electrical features
that make them ideal for detecting biomolecules. SWNTs exhibit semicon￾ducting properties and resonant Raman scattering, creating them ideal for
application as biosensor nanoprobes. SWNTs can operate as transistors; in
this scenario, the particles that fix to the nanotubes’ surfaces act as gating
molecules, changing the conductance of semiconducting SWNTs. As an
amperometric biosensor, MWNTs grown on a platinum substrate were
employed. CNTs are an intriguing class of 1D NMs that have been inten￾sively studied in biosensors, prognosis, tissue technology, cell tracing, and
labeling, delivering a drug, and natural molecules.
Manjunatha et al., reported that, through an electrochemical oxidation
process, a novel modified multiwall carbon nanotube paste electrode with
sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant (SDS) was created. Using cyclic vol￾tammetry (CV) and differential voltammetry (DPV), this electrode was
used to electrochemically detect dopamine (DA), ascorbic acid (AA), uric
acid (UA), and their mixture (Manjunatha et al., 2014).
Motsaathebe and Fayemi stated that detection of serotonin (5-HT) in
tomatoes was made using MWCNT-AONP nanocomposite on screen￾printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) to detect. When compared to other
electrodes investigated, the SPCE-MWCNT-AONP-modified electrodes
demonstrated superior electronic conductivity and improved current
approach whenever it pertained to detect 5-HT. SPCE-MWCNT￾AONP (84.13μA) . SPCE-fMWCNTs (33.49 μA) . SPCE-AONPs
(24.40 μA) . SPCE-bare (2.89 μA) was the current response. Employing
SWV, the sensitivity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification
24 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications(LoQ) for the SPCE-MWCNT-AONP-modified electrode toward 5-HT
detection were 0.2863 μA μM21
, 24.6, and 74 nM, respectively, with lin￾earity from 0.016 to 0.166 μM (R2 5 0.9851). The observed LOD value
for the envisaged sensor was superior to that of other chemically altered
electrodes reported in the literature. Additionally, the proposed sensor
showed an excellent consistency and anti-interference performance. The
average RSD (percent) value of 2.57 (n 5 3) was found in real-sample
analysis of 5-HT in tomatoes, with recoveries ranging from 91.32% to
108.28%. The studies clearly indicate that the suggested new sensor can
be used to diagnose and treat diseases at the point of care (Motsaathebe &
Fayemi, 2021).
The very first carbon nanotube paste electrode for cyclic voltammetric
dopamine detection was developed by Britto et al., (1996). Carbon nano￾tube (CNT) yarn electrodes have also been developed for in vivo neuro￾chemical detection. A CNT yarn is a CNT macrostructure made up of
several parallel CNT filaments. Carbon nanotube filaments and yarns have
also been made via electrospinning. Carbon nanotube filaments and yarns
have also been made via electrospinning (Ko et al., 2006). Schmidt et al.
employed FSCV to create CNT yarn disk-shaped (CNTy-D) electrodes
for electroactive neurotransmitter detection (Schmidt et al., 2013).
Tigari & Manjunatha reported a novel sensor fabrication using anionic
surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate-modified carbon nanotube and pencil
graphite composite paste electrode (SLSMCNTPGCPE shows a linear
current response to a diverse concentration of RF in 0.20.8 and
15 μM with a low detection limit of 1.16 3 108 M by applying differ￾ential pulse voltammetry (DPV)) (Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020).
The EPPGE-SWCNT composite was manufactured by Adekunle
et al., and the EPPGE-SWCNT-Fe electrode was created by electro￾chemical deposition of Fe NPs. The DA detection response of EPPGE￾SWCNT-Fe2O3 was sevenfold higher than that of bare EPPGE and two￾fold higher than that of EPPGE-SWCNT. DA had a sensitivity of 3.44
μA μM21 and a LOD of 0.36 μM21
. Bala et al., looked into the electro￾catalytic properties of Fe3O4, ZnO NPs doped with phthalocyanine (PC)
and 2,3-naphthalocyanine (Nc) functionalized MWCNTs placed on
GCE. MWCNT/Fe3O4/2,3-Nc-, MWCNT/Fe3O4/29 H,31HPc-,
MWCNT/ZnO/2,3-Nc-, and MWCNT/ZnO/29 H,31H-Pc-modified
electrodes had corresponding LODs of 1.77, 1.35, 2.34, and 0.75 μM,
respectively. The MWCNT/ZnO/29 H, 31H-Pc-modified electrode has
the lowest LOD for DA, as can be observed from the results. The better
Material-based electrochemical biosensing systems 25electron accepting capacity of 29 H, 31H-PC than 2,3-Nc in facilitating
electrochemical oxidation of DA could be related to its higher vulnerabil￾ity and lower unfilled energy level (Bala et al., 2019). The effectiveness of
high density carbon nanotube fiber (HD-CNTf) transverse sections called
rods (diameter B69 μm and length B40 μm) as an extremely sensitive
substrate for the screening of typical neurotransmitters was reported by
Gupta et al., The open-end CNTs of HD-CNTf rods microelectrodes are
accessible at the interface with electrolytes and cells, and they have a low
resistance value of 1050 Ω. Dry-spun CNT fibers were wrapped in an
insulated polymer to retain inherent morphology and orientation during
the manufacturing process. Employing square wave voltammetry (SWV)
and cyclic voltammetry, the researchers used the clusters of HD-CNTf
rod microelectrode to detect neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA),
serotonin (5-HT), epinephrine (Epn), and norepinephrine (Nor-epn)
(CV). They display strong linearity across a wide linear range (1 nM to
100 M) and have a high limit of detection (32, 31, 64, and 9 pM for DA,
5-HT, Epn, and Nor-epn, respectively) (Gupta et al., 2020). They exhibit
positive linearity over a wide linear range (1 nM to 100 μM) and have a
high limit of detection (32, 31, 64, and 9 pM, respectively) for DA, 5-
HT, Epn, and Nor-epn. The detection of DA in human bodily fluids and
real-time tracking of dopamine release via living pheochromocytoma
(PC12) cells were performed to illustrate the practicability of HD-CNTf
rod arrays (Gupta et al., 2020).
Kruss et al., reported that application of a new technique, corona
phase molecular recognition (CoPhMoRe), to identify adsorbed polymer
phases on fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that
allow for the selective detection of specific neurotransmitters, including
dopamine. They functionalized and suspended SWCNTs with a library of
different polymers (n 5 30) containing phospholipids, nucleic acids, and
amphiphilic polymers to study how neurotransmitters modulate the result￾ing band gap, near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence of the SWCNT. We iden￾tified several corona phases that enable the selective detection of
neurotransmitters. Catecholamines such as dopamine increased the fluo￾rescence of specific single-stranded DNA- and RNA-wrapped SWCNTs
by 58% 2 80% upon addition of 100 μM dopamine depending on the
SWCNT chirality (n,m). In solution, the limit of detection was 11 nM
[Kd 5 433 nM for (GT)15 DNA-wrapped SWCNTs] (Kruss et al., 2014).
Chang et al., created composite electrodes with a portion of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) exposed to the sample and the rest encapsulated in
26 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationspolymer micropillars and the sensor base. In a 7-day impedance test, the
partial implantation arrangement, in combination with the microchannel
array design, offers the electrodes with a persistent coating and minimal
conductivity loss. After a 2-hour fouling experiment, cyclic voltammetric
investigations demonstrated that dopamine behaves in a quasireversible
manner, with a signal retention of 93%. It has a detection limit of
0.77 nM, a quantitative limit of 2.34 nM, and a sensitivity of 0.453 nA
nM21 when measuring dopamine using differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV). When detecting dopamine with and without extra uric acid,
ascorbic acid, or glucose, all of which are frequent interfering bioactive
substances, clearly differentiated DPV peaks were found (Chang et al.,
2021).
For the first time, Yang et al., produced carbon nanotubes on niobium
substrates. Instead of using a flat metal surface, metal wires with a width
of only 25 μm were employed as CNT substrates, which have the poten￾tial to be used in tissue applications due to their little tissue damage and
good spatial resolution. After chemical vapor deposition, aligned CNTs
are produced on metal wires, as seen by scanning electron microscopy.
CNT-coated niobium (CNT-Nb) microelectrodes have a higher precision
and lesser ΔEp value than CNTs grown on carbon fibers or other metal
wires, according to fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. CNT-Nb microelec￾trodes have a detection range for dopamine of 11 6 1 nM, which is about
two times lower than naked CFMEs. Adsorption processes were simulated
using a Langmuir isotherm, and other neurochemicals such as ascorbic
acid, DOPAC, serotonin, adenosine, and histamine were observed. With
great sensitivity, CNT-Nb microelectrodes were performed to analyze
induced dopamine release in anaesthetized rats. This research shows that
CNT-grown metal microelectrodes, particularly CNTs grown on Nb
microelectrodes, are beneficial for neurotransmitter monitoring (Yang
et al., 2016).
The increased current responsiveness of the modified electrode to DA
and AP was attributed to its significant adsorptive ability, high aspect ratio,
and unique structure of the MWCNT (125 mV peak difference). The
MWCNT-modified GCE yielded LODs of 0.8 and 0.6 μM for DA and
AP, respectively, while also ensuring adequate sensibility against DA in
the presence of elevated concentration of AP and vice versa (Elugoke
et al., 2020).
Swamy and Venton explored the codetection of dopamine and seroto￾nin in vivo using carbon-fiber microelectrodes made with single-walled
Material-based electrochemical biosensing systems 27carbon nanotubes. S/N ratios for neurotransmitters significantly elevated
after nanotube coating, according to fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Fast￾scan rates did not reveal the electrocatalytic activity of nanotubes, whereas
delayed scanning revealed quicker kinetics. After being exposed to seroto￾nin, nanotube-modified microelectrodes showed much less fouling than
naked electrodes. After administering a serotonin artificial precursor to a
sedated rat, the nanotube-modified electrodes were applied to measure
stimulated dopamine and serotonin levels simultaneously in the striatum.
Because of their heightened susceptibility and resistance to fouling,
nanotube-coated microelectrodes can be employed with the rapid imag￾ing modalities and are ideal for in vivo evaluation of neuromessengers
(Swamy & Venton, 2007).
The organic phase (DNA sequence) encircling SWCNTs was modi￾fied to construct detectors with variable sensing properties for catechol￾amine transporters, according to Florian et al. Although the majority of
DNA-functionalized SWCNTs responded to catecholamine neurotrans￾mitters, the dissociation constants (Kd) and detection limits were strongly
reliant on functionalization (sequence). Kd value varies from 2.3 μM
(SWCNT-(GC)15 1 norepinephrine) to 9.4 μM (SWCNT-(AT)15 1
dopamine), with high sensitivity often in the single-digit nM range.
Interestingly, various SWCNT symmetric sensors display distinct fluores￾cence increases. Furthermore, at low concentrations, certain sensors (e.g.,
SWCNT-(GT)10) may discriminate between distinct catecholamines,
such as dopamine and norepinephrine (50 μM) (Mann et al., 2017).
2.2.2 Carbon-based quantum dots and graphene-based QD’s
QDs are a type of semiconductor NP with a diameter of 110 nm with
the elements from the periodic groups IIVI or IIIV. In reality, QDs
have been classified as quasizero dimensional nanomaterials, with three
dimensions measuring less than ten nanometers in each direction, limiting
internal electron transport to nanoscale size in each direction. Because of
their improved quantum efficiency and good optical properties, semicon￾ductor QDs (SQDs) and tiny organic fluorescent dyes (OFDs) are gaining
popularity in biomedical and biotomography. However, they have signifi￾cant drawbacks that have restricted their use, including increased lethality,
poor bioactivity, cost, and chemical inertness. In a water-based environ￾ment, these materials have a limited dissolution rate/bioavailability.
Several ways for improving QD solubility have been proposed, including
28 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsplacing them in a shell such as silica, using a persistent surfactant layer,
and substituting polar functional groups on the OFDs surface; however,
most modifications are made in organic solvents. Carbon-based QDs,
such as GQDs and CQDs, are typically classified as zero-dimensional
compounds with fluorescence properties. However, after the discovery of
CQDs, GQDs, it has been discovered that they are significantly more effi￾cient than semiconductor QDs due to lesser toxic effects, better bioactiv￾ity, tolerable chemical resistance, and dispersion.
According to the study, graphene QDs were discovered to be modi￾fied versions of graphene or graphite and other graphitic three￾dimensional materials utilizing upper edge synthetic approaches.
Multilayer topologies with lateral diameters of up to 100 nm are common
in G-QDs. Carbon dots, on the other hand, are decided to make utilizing
bottom-up synthetic methods and also have a spherical morphology with
a radius of up to 10 nm. Carbogenic dots or carbon nanodots are other
names for these particles. In addition, the GQDs have physicochemical
properties that are identical to graphene. The GQDs were assumed to be
small graphene layers with transverse sizes less than 10 nm that contributed
up the final particle in terms of size. Due to the prevalence of edge inter￾actions with CQDs, quantum size effect, tiny sizes, and bioactivity, a
number of CQD characteristics branched from graphene characteristics,
enabling them to be acknowledged as effective drug carriers, permitting
simultaneous observation of the releasing kinetics. They can be used in a
number of biomedical field due to its special physicochemical and catalytic
features (Liu et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2015).
Huang et al., designed a simplified, responsive, and credible system
(CDsCS/GCE) using CDs and chitosan (CS) hybrid sheet altered glassy
carbon electrode (GCE). In addition, when contrasted to GCE responses,
this CDsCS/GCE displayed appropriate electrochemical replies for sens￾ing DA under ideal conditions. As a result, at dosages ranging from 0.1 to
30.0 mM, the DA oxidation peak current (Ipa) was linear, with a LOD of
11.2 nM (3 S/N). This has also been claimed that this CDsCS/GCE has
been successfully employed to identify DA levels in an injectable DA
solution (Huang et al., 2013).
Cernat et al., used a GCE modified by Au@CDs(Au@CDs)chitosan
(CS), Au@CDsCS/GCE, to identify DA in another study published in
2013. The Au@CDsCS/GCE showed a greater catalytic activity in
opposition to DA oxidation than the bare GCE, CDsCS/GCE, and
CS/GCE. In optimum conditions, a LOD of 0.001 M (3 S/N) was
Material-based electrochemical biosensing systems 29recorded for DA critical determination within the linearity range of con￾centrations of 0.01100.0 M (Cernat et al., 2020).
In 2014, Hu et al. developed and characterized a novel DA biosensor
on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-CD composite film with improved
specificity, stability, and sensitivity. The rGO-CDs (GCE) had more ade￾quate electrochemical responses for detecting DA than the plain GCE,
CDs/GCE, and GO/GCE. Furthermore, with a LOD of 1.5 nM (3 S/
N), a continuous relation was established between the DA oxidation peak
current and its dosage in the areas of 0.01000450.0 M. Eventually, it
was discovered that the rGO-CDs/GCE were fairly effective in suppres￾sing ambient current induced by large uric acid (UA) and ascorbic acid
(AA) (Hu et al., 2014).
Cui and Zhang’s GR/Au nanocomposite-modified glassy carbon elec￾trode (GR/Au/GCE) demonstrated high selectivity in the sensing of epi￾nephrine (EP). On this modified electrode, EP oxidation occurred at lower
positive potentials than on bare GCE. EP concentrations between 5.0108
and 8.0106 mol L21 (L.O.D. 5 7.0109 mol L21
) were shown to be
proportional to anodic peak current. Furthermore, EP and ascorbic acid
(AA) oxidation peaks were separated by around 180 mV. As a result, the
GR/Au nanocomposite-modified electrode successfully differentiates
between the signals of the two analytes. GR/Au nanocomposite-modified
glassy carbon electrode (GR/Au/GCE) produced by Cui and Zhang
showed a remarkable sensitivity in the detection of epinephrine (EP). It was
discovered that oxidation of EP occurred at lower positive potentials on
this modified electrode than on bare GCE. The anodic peak current was
found to be proportional to EP concentrations between 5.0 10 8 and 8.0
10 6 mol L21 (L.O.D. 5 7.0 109 mol L21
). Furthermore, the oxidation
peaks of EP and ascorbic acid (AA) were separated by roughly 180 mV. As
a result, the GR/Au nanocomposite-modified electrode satisfactorily distin￾guishes between the two analytes’ signals. GR/Au nanocomposites also
showed the outstanding electrocatalytic properties toward a range of many
microbiomolecules (including dopamine, b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleo￾tide, and uric acid), hinting that they may be used to construct biosensors
(Cui & Zhang, 2012).
In order to conduct an electrochemical examination of riboflavin (RF)
in a 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution with a pH of 7.0 and the presence
of ascorbic acid, Varun et al. reported the development of a functionalized
carbon nanofiber and carbon nanotube composite paste electrode (Varun
et al., 2021).
30 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsJiang et al., created an NCQDs that they adjusted on the GCE and uti￾lized to voltammetrically quantify DA. According to the study, NCQDs
were created utilizing a hydrothermal process. NCQD-modified electrodes
demonstrated an improved electrochemical sensitivity to DA. With linear
ranges spanning from 0 to 1.0103 M and a lower LOD of 1.0109 M at
a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, the NCQDs displayed a good electrochemical
behavior for the detection of DA. On the other hand, the NCQDs aug￾mented electrode had known for its anti-incumbrance for perceiving DA in
the environment of UA and/or AA. Finally, inorganic ions were reported
to have no effect on the tracking of DA (Jiang et al., 2015).
Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant was used to create and apply
a novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphite mixture paste electrode
(SDSMCNTGMPE) for sensitive electrochemical detection of resorcinol
(RS), according to the study of Manjunatha (2017).
Manjunath et al., reported that using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and dif￾ferential voltammetry, a modified graphene paste electrode (SDSMGPE)
prepared by electrochemically immobilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate sur￾factant (SDS) on a graphene paste electrode was used to simultaneously
determine dopamine (DA) in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric
acid (UA) (DPV). Using the CV method, the modified electrode exhibits
a high electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of DA, AA, and UA as
well as three clearly defined voltammetric peaks at approximately 167, 12,
and 303 mV (Shankar et al., 2009).
2.2.3 Nanodiamond
Nanodiamond (ND) is a type of carbon nanomaterial with a core of cova￾lently bonded sp3 carbon molecules and a surface decorated with sp2
-
hybridized carbon atoms through boundary defects or loading. In the last
decade, new type of carbon nanomaterial called nanodiamonds (NDs) has
demonstrated the sufficient contact area and electrocatalytic activity
toward NTs. Merely very few electrochemical ND-based NT sensors are
now developed, which is interesting.
In a solution of 0.1 mol L21 phosphate buffer pH 7.4 on B/C 4000
ppm follicular electrodes with increasing BDD growth period, Simona
produced boron-doped diamond exhibited the minimum detection limit
of 2107 mol L21
, except any stimulation done between the various sur￾veys. Furthermore, increased specificity for dopamine detection over
common interfering chemicals such as uric acid, ascorbic acid, and
Material-based electrochemical biosensing systems 31paracetamol was achieved for chosen porous electrodes (Baluchová
et al., 2019).
Recent electrochemical tests revealed that the transference rate in the
[Fe3 (CN)6]
32/42 redox system rises as the film thickens. The specificity
and susceptibility results for DA blended with AA analysis demonstrate
that the 8h-BDD and 12h-BDD electrodes have well-separated oxidizing
maxima of DA and AA, and the 12h-BDD electrode has ideal sensibility
until the DA concentration drops to 1 μM (Qi et al., 2016).
Shahrokhian and Khafaji have announced the fabrication of a unique
customized pyrolytic graphite electrode containing nanodiamond/graph￾ite. In the presence of ascorbic acid, the produced modified electrode
works as a very precise sensor for collateral investigation of EN and UA
(AA). The electrode has a catalytic expression for analyzing EN and UA
peaks, and it fully suppresses the AA interfering effect. The electrical
behavior of the electrode was found to be linear with EN and UA levels
in the ranges of 0.0110 and 0.0160 μM, correspondingly. Both com￾pounds have a detection range of 3 nM as a consequence of these experi￾ments. For the detection of EN in human serum samples, urine, and the
equivalent injection samples, this sensor demonstrated an excellent repeat￾ability, consistency, and specificity (Shahrokhian & Khafaji, 2010).
Ramos et al., presented a biofilm of graphite, nanodiamonds, and gold
nanoparticles tethered in casein as a minimal cost electrode susceptible to
serotonin measurement. The conductive nanoparticles were anchored to
the GCE using a casein biofilm. Differential pulse voltammetry was used
to make the observations, which revealed a linear relation with an LDR
of 0.33.0 μmol L21
, a LOD of 0.1 μmol L21
, and a tolerance of
0.18 mA L mol21
. The sensor was used to measure serotonin in artificial
urine samples that had a high recovery rate (91.4%103%). As a result,
the suggested electrode used a moderate rate biofilm to enhance the per￾mittivity and electron transfer rate of the pristine electrode, which may be
used in electrochemical biosensor applications (Ramos et al., 2020).
Shahrokhian and Bayat have created a pyrolytic graphite electrode
(PGE) with a thin film of graphite/diamond nanomixture on the surface
(NGD). The electrode has been demonstrated to be competent in electro￾chemically sensing TRP and 5-hydroxytryptophan (HTRP). The inclu￾sion of the NGD film caused a significant increase in pulse duration and
wave quality, enabling nanomolar TRP and HTRP levels to be detected.
Using cyclic voltammetry, the potential scan speeds, solution pH, aggre￾gation conditions, and modifying quantity were all optimized. TRP and
32 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsHTRP were determined using direct sweep voltammetry with detection
limits (S/N 5 3) of 30 nM (TRP) and 6 nM (HTRP) with optimal accu￾mulation time and open circuit operation (HTRP). The electrode is sim￾ple to manufacture, has greater precision, sharp peaks, sustained stability,
and excellent voltammetric consistency and repeatability, and is easy to
use. The sensor’s features make it ideal for detecting TRP and HTRP in
pharmaceutical and therapeutic formulations (Shahrokhian & Bayat,
2011).
2.3 Conclusion
The recent progress in the material design and synthesis, particularly nano￾materials, has resulted in very reliable electrochemical sensing devices with
better analytical performance. Carbon nanoparticles are one among them
and exhibit extraordinary sensitivity and surface conductivity. Carbon
nanomaterial-based modified electrodes have also proven their capacity to
serve as anchors for various neurotransmitters. As a result, carbon nanopar￾ticles are attracting a lot of attention of electrochemists. The researchers
are using different varieties of carbon materials such as CNTs, graphene,
carbon dots, and carbon diamond as a modifier to determine dopamine,
ascorbic acid, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These types of electrodes
show high chemical inertness, biocompatibility, and antifouling
characteristics.

3.1 Introduction
Nanostructured materials exist in 1D, 2D, and 3D configurations having
average size between 1 to 100 nm (Cheng, 2014; Kreyling et al., 2010).
Combining different hybrid metal oxide nanomaterials and their use in
engineering, physics, biology, chemistry and bionanotechnology for the
development novel devices like biosensors, nanomedicines, etc. (Adimule
et al., 2021; Bellah et al., 2012). For the conversion of accurate biological
transformation into useful signals, an analytical device (Hareesha &
Manjunatha, 2020; Manjunatha, 2018) in biosensor makes recognition of
elements in direct contact with the transduction element (Nasrollahzadeh
et al., 2019). On the other hand, nanostructured (NS) materials with a
hybrid combination of inorganic and organic metal nanonetworks
(Adimule et al., 2021; Adimule, Nandi, et al., 2021; Adimule et al., 2021)
showed extraordinarily physiochemical properties such as thermal and
electrical properties, optical scattering, and significantly greater perfor￾mance as compared with their bulk counterparts (Huang et al., 2006;
Noah, 2019). The combination of oxide metal inorganic and organic
structures in hybrid nanomaterials (Adimule et al., 2021; Adimule et al.,
2021) enabled its enhanced performance in energy storage devices
(Adimule et al., 2021, 2022; Reddy et al., 2012), structural strength, and
antimicrobial applications as well as sensor properties (Jain & El-Sayed,
2007). A wide range of different dimensions of NS exists such as 1D NS
like nanorods and nanowires, 2D NS like nanosheets, and 3D NS like
polymorphic crystals (Jain et al., 2008). The diversified features of the

tunable properties like optical scattering and PL (Shashanka, Chaira, &
Kumara Swamy, 2015; Shashanka, Kumara Swamy, 2020a,b). These
properties are directly dependent on their aspect ratio (Logeswari et al.,
2013) and the nature of the oxides in coatings (Makarov et al., 2014).
Further, C-nanomaterials attracted much attention from the researcher
due to their exceptional properties like thermal, mechanical, electrical,
electronics, etc., in developing applications in the area of energy storage
(Manjunatha, 2018b, 2020), sensors, FETs, and nanoscale electronic com￾ponents (Noah, 2019; Verma & Mehata, 2019). Different physical and
chemical methods have been developed for the fabrication of the NS
(Muhammed, 2003; Yu et al., 2013). In addition, the use of metal oxide
inorganic and organic hybrid NS improvises the biosensing properties and
addresses the key challenges in the development of biosensors such as sen￾sitivity, selectivity, interaction of the analyte with biosensor surface, and
reduced response time (Stern et al., 2007, Shashanka et al., 2015, 2016).
In the present investigation, the synthesis of metal oxide hybrid NS by
simple precipitation method, various NS fabrication procedures, classifica￾tion and varieties of biosensors, their types, possible fabrication or immo￾bilization, and applications are discussed in detail.
3.2 Experiment
3.2.1 Typical synthesis of inorganic and organic
nanomaterials
In a typical process, metal nitrate (Mx (NO3)2) was dissolved in requisite
quantity of demineralized water (DM), added with pinch of cetyl tri￾methyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) or triethanol amine (TEA) and
heated to reflux; after completion of the reaction, reaction mixture was
cooled to room temperature (RT); NH4OH/NaOH solution was added
dropwise; and precipitate formed was filtered, washed with cold water
and ethanol/acetone, dried at 100°C200°C, and calcinated at 750°C
800°C.
3.2.2 Fabrication of the inorganic/organic nanostructures
3.2.2.1 Lithography
In order to fabricate the NS, in lithography, photons, electrons, and ions
are employed (Venkatesan & Bashir, 2011). During the lithography pro￾cess, it transfers the patterns on the mask to the substrate surface and is
38 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationswidely used technique in the microelectronics industries (Biswas et al.,
2012; Baglin, 2012). In photolithography, ultraviolet radiation was used
to transfer the substrate on a photosensitive layer on the semiconductor
surface (Kawata et al., 2001). Upon exposure to the radiation of a specific
wavelength, the substrate undergoes changes in its composition and is sub￾sequently transferred by the etching process (Qiao et al., 2007). Maskless
approaches include ion-beam lithography and laser ablation methods
(Fabre et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013) which generate high-energy ions and
multiphoton for adsorption in the photochemical process (Fig. 3.1).
3.2.2.2 Chemical vapor deposition process
In chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, the substrate is exposed to
the volatile precursor, gets deposited on the substrate, and is obtained as
thin-film coatings (Prasad Yadav et al., 2012). Wide varieties of NS with
different physical and chemical properties were produced by changing the
experimental conditions such as nature of the substrate, composition of
the gas mixture, temperature, etc. (Asmatulu, 2012). CVD involves

positive photoresist.
Inorganic and organic nanomaterials role in biosensing 39number of processes such as the generation of active reactants in gaseous
form, delivering the precursors, adsorption, decomposition, migration,
and nucleation of the atoms. CVD process is used to develop dielectrics,
conductors, epitaxial layers, microelectronics, 2D nanosheets, metal oxi￾des, and borophenes (Oliveira & Machado, 2013; de Oliveira Sousa Neto
et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019) (Fig. 3.2).
3.2.2.3 Solgel nanofabrication
Solgel fabrication process involves the production of gelation network
by inorganic nanomaterials and the existence of a colloidal liquid form to
produce 3D NS (Prasad et al., 2018). Solgel involves metal precursors in
solution deposited over the substrate, and then, heat is transferred to form
final products. The technique has been widely used in the fabrication of
metal oxide NS due to the superiority of chemical reaction and improves
the chemical homogeneity of the final products (Praveena et al., 2016).
Suitable capping agents provide easy chemical modification during the
synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials. Nanocomposites of SiO2 and octadecyl
amine with polypropylene were achieved by solgel techniques (Fig. 3.3)
(Ayinde et al., n.d).
3.2.2.4 Green synthesis
The process of green synthesis involves reducing agent obtained from the
plant products to reduce the metal ions in the solution. The plant-obtained
reducing agents provide greener pathways for the reduction of metal ions
and their chemical composition. Ag and Mg NPs exhibit antimicrobial

40 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsproperties (Sani et al., 2017). For example, reduction of Ag1 from AgNO3
involves plant extract Clitoria ternatea. Some of the other substrates that sup￾port the synthesis of Ag NPs include cellulose fillers, ceramic fillers, chito￾san, etc. (Turner, 2013; Bandara & Weerasinghe, 2005).
3.3 Results and discussion
3.3.1 Characterization
Special techniques are required for the characterization of the NS as they
have small size, shape, and morphology (Rahman et al., 2010). Various
imaging techniques were employed for the characterization of the NS.
Crystallite size, phase, and particle size are determined by X-ray diffrac￾tometer (XRD) spectral investigation. The size modulation of the NPs is
directly dependent of the concentration of the dopant, temperature, and
synthetic parameters. Changes in the synthesis of NS, doping concentra￾tion, and its effect can be studied by Raman spectral investigation. The
microstructural orientation and size of the NPs were confirmed by scan￾ning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) techniques (Fig. 3.4). The atomic composition of the elements
and inner architecture of the NS were examined by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The NS pore size, pore volume, and the available
specific areas were studied by BET studies. The presence of various func￾tional groups and their characteristics such as stretching and bending
vibrations were confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopic investigation.
3.3.2 Characteristics of biosensors
The commercial utility of the biosensors depends on the specific
static and dynamic requirement which is effective in modulating the
Figure 3.3 A schematic representation of solgel synthesis.
Inorganic and organic nanomaterials role in biosensing 41biosensor devices. The following are the few characteristics of bio￾sensor systems.
1. Selectivity and sensitivity: Particular target molecule can be identified
and detected by bioreceptors in the analyte, and the minimum amount
of analyte in low concentration is responsible for the effective detec￾tion of the molecules.
2. Linearity and response time: Time taken for obtaining 95% of the
results which also comprises high degree of linearity.
3. Stability and reproducibility: The precision and accuracy of the bio￾sensor depend on the effectiveness of the detection in low concentra￾tion (Manjunatha, 2020; Manjunatha, 2020) of the analyte. Stability
determines the extent of vulnerability inside and outside the environ￾ment in the detection of the molecules (Manjunatha et al., 2015,
2013).

42 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications3.3.3 Classification of biosensors
The construction of biosensor device depends on the bioreceptors.
Various criteria are taken into consideration while classifying the biosen￾sors. Biosensor classification is a diverse and multidisciplinary field. The
flowchart of the classification of the biosensors is displayed in Fig. 3.5.
3.4 Nanomaterials-based biosensors
Advancement in nanotechnology enables exploring various types of nano￾materials such as metal oxide nanostructures, carbon nanotubes, quantum
dots, nanowires, etc., which provides improved detection by controlling
the size and morphology.
3.4.1 Electrochemical biosensing of inorganic nanomaterials
Various metal oxides are widely employed in the field of electrochemistry,
catalysis, and sensors because of their diversified physical, chemical, and
biological properties. Most of the NPs possess high electrocatalytic perfor￾mance (Raril et al., 2020; Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020), low cost, can
attract the organic molecules, and are therefore used widely in the
Figure 3.5 A schematic representation of the top-down and bottom-up approaches
for the fabrication of nanostructures.
Inorganic and organic nanomaterials role in biosensing 43effective detection of bioreceptor and biosensor device fabrications
(Muhammed, 2003). Some examples of oxide-based biosensors and their
typical characteristic features are enlisted below.
1. P-type semiconductors with superparamagnetic and super￾antiferromagnetic NiO NPs find applications in the field of electroca￾talysis, sensors, thermistors, etc. (Naresh & Lee, 2021).
2. Ni/Cu metal oxide biosensors are effective in the detection of glucose
biosensors in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (Purohit et al., 2020).
3. Co3O4 NPs possess diversified properties such as optical, sensor,
lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, chemical sensors, etc. (Malhotra
& Ali, 2017).
4. Fe2O3 NPs are the best-known NMs because of their bioanalytical
and faster electron transfer rates.
Properties of the electrochemical biosensors, especially for the metal
oxides, are directly dependent on the electrochemical properties
(Manjunatha et al., 2012; Raril & Manjunatha, 2018) of the analyte and
transducers. Metal oxides which are inorganic in nature when used in bio￾sensor device fabrication exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, and capability
for the detection. The biosensors are responsible for the generation of
detectable signals on the surface of transducers in terms of voltage, cur￾rent, and capacitance (Grieshaber et al., 2008; Shanker et al., 2014).
Based on the transduction nature of the analyte, electrochemical sen￾sors are classified into:
1. Potentiometric,
2. Amperometric,
3. Impedimetric,
4. Conductometric, and
5. Voltammetric.
The inorganic metal oxide NS, especially metal oxides like Y2O3,
ZnO, Co3O4, Gd2O3, CuO, Mn2O3, etc., can detect the biological spec￾imen effectively by either potentiometric or voltammetric determinations.
3.4.2 Potentiometric biosensors
The potentiometric biosensors work on the principle of the amount of
charge accumulated on the surface of the transduction materials. The
inorganic oxide possesses a commonly dopant element which makes the
conduction of current/voltage either by electrons or hole transportation
inside the NS (Rajesh et al., 2009). The oxygen vacancies created in the
44 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsNS are responsible for the migration of charge density, thus enhancing
the electrochemical efficiencies. The analyte and receptor develop effec￾tive interaction at the working electrode as compared with the reference
electrode whose initial current is set to zero. In common, in order to
transform the biochemical reaction signal into potential output, ion￾selective electrodes and ion-selective field-effect transistors are used
(Chaubey & Malhotra, 2002; Pisoschi, 2016). The pictorial representation
of the electrochemical biosensors is shown in Fig. 3.6A.
3.4.3 Voltammetric determinations
Organic metal oxides when placed in the aqueous solution show a large
change in the current gain as the applied voltage is increased. The voltam￾metric biosensor detects the analyte by measuring the current when increasing
the large applied voltage. The detection of the analyte in small concentration,
high accuracy, and simultaneous detection of multiple analyte samples are
possible in voltammetric determination (Hangarter et al., 2010).
3.4.4 Electrochemical biosensing of organic nanomaterials
Organic nanomaterials used for the biosensing device fabrication work on
the mode of field-effect transistor (FET) transduction. A large number of
organic molecules are used for the effective biosensing of various biomole￾cules such as CNTs (SWCNTs and MWCNTs), graphene, various con￾ducting polymers, and other heterocyclic molecules largely used in the
biosensing applications. Future transistor technology involves “nanoelectro￾nics” in which the active surface of the device probe consists of nanometer￾sized molecules. The integration of especially 1D NMs into functional elec￾tronic devices has received considerable attention due to their diversified
biological applications as effective sensitive tools. High-throughput engi￾neered probes are created by using NS with compatible, suitable bioen￾zymes like antibodies, transport proteins, enzymes, etc. The dimension of
the molecules shrinks to nanoscale, thus enhancing the effect of biochemical
changes at the surface of the receptor. Organic NMs containing biosensor
devices provide a unique facility by changing the local chemical environ￾ment, changes in the sensitizing layer, and transducer actions.
Conducting polymeric NS provides an attractive alternative to the rest
other class of organic NS due to their low cost (Xia et al., 2010), light￾weight, and easy processing (Rajesh et al., 2009). The crucial factor
responsible for the development of conducting polymeric NS biosensor
Inorganic and organic nanomaterials role in biosensing 45device fabrication is to provide a selectively sensitive surface over the NS
to provide contact resistance variation in the liquid phase containing ana￾lyte and receptor molecules. In common, functional monomers contained
in the polymeric molecules integrate into the co-polymeric scheme and
provide the site for effective interaction between the analyte and the bior￾eceptor molecules (Yoon et al., 2008, 2009) (Fig. 3.6).

46 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications3.4.5 Electrochemical biosensing of hybrid (inorganic and
organic) nanomaterials
Hybrid NMs containing inorganic and organic structures appropriately
doped into the nanomatrix provide effective interaction sites in the
liquid phase containing analyte and bioreceptor molecules in biosen￾sing. In the case of fabrication of the organic and inorganic molecules,
flexible electrochemical sensors are produced as a result of sandwitch￾ing 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D NS over the surface of the organic mole￾cules. The organic molecules provide effective interaction sites and
establish a strong bond between the dispersed analyte and the biore￾ceptor molecules. Usually, acid functional groups present in the
organic polymeric NS provide effective interaction sites between the
dispersed 1D and 2D NMs and form stable contact between the elec￾trode materials (Yoon et al., 2009). Thrombin, glucose (Tolani et al.,
2009), and human serum albumin (Lee et al., 2015) are used as organic
bioreceptor molecules for the device fabrication process (Yoon et al.,
2008) (Fig. 3.7).
Inorganicorganic hybrid nanoflowers were synthesized by using Cu
(II) ions from copper(II) sulfate solution and bovine serum albumin (BSA)
in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution. The synthesis was performed by
adding BSA into the PBS solution, and Cu(SO4)2 solutions were added
and incubated at room temperature for 3 days. A micrometer-sized NM
having blue color was obtained. Different protein components as shown
in Fig. 3.8 are used such as carbonic anhydrase, trypsin, alpha-amylase,
glucose oxidase, etc. The flower-shaped hybrid NMs show significantly
enhanced electrochemical performance higher than the other counterparts
and significantly high possessing stability (Cui et al., 2016). Mass transfer
rate becomes insignificant as a result of flower-shaped morphology and
effective confinement of enzyme molecules (Lee et al., 2017).
Similar to the Cu(II) ions, Ca(II) ions from CaSO4 incorporated into
the alpha-analyze enzyme showed significantly enhanced sensitivity and
stability as compared with free enzymes due to the strong interaction
between alpha-amylase and Ca21 ions in PBS solution. Ca21 ions are also
incorporated for differentiating enzymes such as lipase, chloroperoxidase,
etc. (Fig. 3.9).
The strategy for developing multiple enzyme molecules is incorpo￾rated with metal ions for the development of multifunctional orga￾nicinorganic hybrid NS.

horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for the effective detection of glucose mole￾cules (Yoon et al., 2008). The schematic representation of the fluorescent

Inorganic and organic nanomaterials role in biosensing 493.5 Conclusion
In summary, in the present context, various inorganic metal oxides, organic
molecules, and hybrid NS biosensor requirements and their characteriza￾tion and classification were discussed in detail. Further, the importance of
inorganic, organic, and hybrid NS electrochemical biosensing mechanisms,
their characteristics and properties like electrical conductivity, transduction,
sensor performances, and comparison of the effectiveness of the biosensor
performances of various inorganic, organic, and hybrid NS were presented
in detail. The inorganic, and organic, based nanostructures are the promis￾ing pathway for the development of efficient biosensors which can detect
biomolecules in very low concentration and in shorter time intervals. The
hybrid structures thus develops strong interaction between analyte and
transducers with high rate of reproducibility of the results.

4.1 Introduction
By producing signals proportional to the concentration of an analyte in
the reaction, a biosensor is a device that detects biological or chemical
processes (Bhalla et al., 2016). Since Lel and Clark created the first oxygen
biosensor in1962, researchers from a variety of disciplines have created a
number of biosensors for use in food, drink, environmental and agricul￾tural applications, medicine, biotechnology, and protection against bioter￾rorism (Malhotra et al., 2005). A growing field of multidisciplinary study
is biosensors. In order to detect different kinds of targeted biomolecules,
several biosensor types are combined with various transducers, each of
which has its benefits and limits. In nanobiotechnology, aptamers,
DNAzymes, aptazymes, and PNA are common examples of nucleic acid
components (Kim et al., 2008; Singh et al. 2009, 2010).
In organic chemistry, various reagents and metals are used to construct
different scaffolds for biological applications (Chandrashekharappa et al.,
2018; Khedr et al., 2018; Sandeep et al., 2016; Uppar et al., 2020;
Venugopala et al., 2020). For a variety of reasons, nanostructures are uti￾lized in the construction of biosensors today, and this has produced impor￾tant advancements in this field (Abedini & Zhang, 2021; Zhang et al.,
2021; Zhao et al., 2020). The goal of incorporating nanomaterials into bio￾sensor structures is to raise the level necessary to stabilize biomaterials,
which will increase sensitivity, catalyze the reaction, enable reactions to
occur at low potentials, and speed up the transfer of electrons from the
active reaction center to the electrode surface (in electrochemical nanosen￾sors) (Alam et al., 2020a, 2020b; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The

All rights reserved.development of third-generation biosensors depends heavily on the elimi￾nation of chemical intermediates of electron transfer, which may be accom￾plished by using nanomaterials in the construction of biosensors (Guo et al.,
2014; Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013; Zhang & Wang, 2019).
Nanoparticles have a significant role in the surface adsorption of biomole￾cules due to their high free surface energy and large specific surface area
(Freeman et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). An essential class
of chemical sensors called electrochemical biosensors uses electrodes as
transducers to transform biological data into electrical signals (Zhang et al.,
2019a). Electrochemical sensors have been the subject of in-depth research
up to this point, and in some cases, the sensors produced by these studies
have even been commercialized and found wide use in a variety of clinical,
industrial, environmental, and agricultural domains (Gholipour et al., 2019;
Sun et al., 2018; Zhang & Ou, 2015).
4.2 Principle of biosensor
The transducer transforms the information from this contact into a quantifi￾able impact whereas the biological layer is in charge of the specific interaction
with the analyte (Wang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). For instance, mechani￾cal transducers translate the analytebioreceptor interaction into changes in
bending or resonant frequency; optical transducers typically translate this
occurrence into changes in light frequency or intensity; electrochemical trans￾ducers translate it into changes in current, potential, and so on. Finally, the
reading system counts the amount of these changes. Fig. 4.1 shows the bio￾sensor process schematically. The reading system counts the effects of the
encounter on the physical world (Jiang et al., 2017; Öhlén et al., 2016). A
good reading system can monitor resonant frequency changes, bending
changes, changes in electrochemical parameters like current and potential,
and changes in optical characteristics, among other physical events (Feng
et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
4.3 Nanotechnology
Due to the rising demand for controlling desirable molecules found in the
human body and environment, nanomaterials have lately attracted a lot of
attention (Long-Term, 2008). A nanomaterial is made up of nanoparticles
(NPs) that are at least 100 nm in one dimension smaller than that. When
referring to materials that are sub-nanometers or several hundred
58 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsnanometers in size, the term “nanotechnology” is used (Balzani, 2006;
Tansil & Gao, 2006). Higher electrical conductivity, nanoscale size, the
ability to amplify desired signals, and compatibility with biological mole￾cules are all features of the designed nanomaterials (Colvin, 2003). Carbon
materials, for instance, can be used to conjugate biomolecules (enzymes,
antibodies, DNA, cell, etc.). According to research, the inclusion of nano￾materials may improve the performance of biosensors, particularly their
sensitivity, and lower limit of detection by many orders of magnitude.
4.3.1 Classification of nanoparticles
Nanomaterials were divided by size and dimensions. There are four types
of nanomaterials as shown below.
4.3.1.1 Zero-dimensional nanomaterials
In these zero-dimensional nanomaterials, materials with all three dimen￾sions exist in the nanoscale, for example, NPs such as gold, platinum, sil￾ver, palladium, or quantum dots. The shape of NPs is spherical and size
with a diameter of 150 nm. It has been found that some polygon and
cube shapes constitute zero-dimensional nanomaterials.
4.3.1.2 One-dimensional nanomaterials
These one-dimensional nanomaterials have one dimension in the range of
1100 nm, and the other two dimensions can be in the macroscale.
Nanotubes, nanofibers, nanowires, and nanorods are examples of one￾Figure 4.1 Biosensor principle.
Organometallic and biomass-derived nanostructured materials for biosensing applications 59dimensional nanomaterials. Some metals (Au, Ag, Si, etc.), metal oxides
(ZnO, TiO2, CeO2, etc.), quantum dots, and others can provide one￾dimensional nanostructures.
4.3.1.3 Two-dimensional nanomaterials
In this class of nanomaterials, two dimensions are in the nanoscale and
one dimension is in the macroscale. Nano-thin films, thin-film multi￾layers, nanosheets, or nanowalls are two-dimensional nanomaterials. The
area of these nanomaterials can be several square micrometers keeping the
width always in the nanoscale range.
4.3.1.4 Three-dimensional nanomaterials
In three-dimensional nanomaterials, all dimensions are in the macroscale,
and there are no dimensions in the nanoscale. Bulk materials are three￾dimensional nanomaterials that are fixed with individual blocks which
may be in nanometer scale (1100 nm) or more.
4.4 Gold nanoparticles
Due to their biocompatibility, optical, and electrical characteristics, as well
as their comparatively simple manufacture and modification (Biju, 2014),
gold nanoparticles are the most commonly utilized noble metal nanoparti￾cles for biosensor applications (Zhu, 2016). Au may quickly shed its
unpaired electron from the s-subshell and reach a stable state because of a
fully occupied d-subshell. A direct and unrestricted electronic transition
between the electrode materials and electroactive substances is made possi￾ble by this activity of Au. Small-scale, highly active Au NPs enable
stable immobilization of large biomolecules without impairing their struc￾ture or function. The Turkevich procedure, a straightforward and
repeatable chemical method, is the method used the most frequently to
create Au NPs (Kimling et al., 2006).
Sodium tri-citrate is used as a reducing agent to reduce gold from a
mono-salt precursor (HAuCl4) to its zerovalent form (Au 1 ). NPs with
different optical responses may be created in a variety of sizes and forms
depending on the stoichiometry between HAuCl4 and sodium tri-citrate.
Based on the aggregation state, size, and shape of Au NPs, red-to-yellow
color changes are suggested to represent different interaction regimes with
distinctive molecular geometries (Aldewachi et al., 2018). Au nanostruc￾tures are also frequently employed as signal amplification linkers in a
60 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsvariety of biosensors due to their excellent biocompatibility, catalytic,
conducting, and light scattering capabilities. As a result, these varied prop￾erties of Au NPs serve as effective instruments for identifying a variety of
biomarkers, such as DNA/RNA, proteins, amino acids, pathogens, and
others (Chaicham et al., 2018; De La Escosura-Muñiz et al., 2016; Lee
et al., 2015). For improved detection signal and analyte response, Au NPs
have been used in several publications, either alone or in conjugated form
with other materials. Shan and colleagues revealed amino phenylboronic
acid-modified Au NPs for detecting T cell biomarkers of lymphoblastic
leukemia (CCRF-CEM) in one such investigation (Shan et al., 2014).
Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) transduction, gold nanoparti￾cles have shown their benefits in bioanalysis. The detection of the analyte
can be recorded in several ways, such as changes to the angle, intensity, or
phase of the reflected light, and is often predicated on a change in the
dielectric constant of the propagating surface plasmons’ surroundings of
gold films (Guo, 2012; Wijaya et al., 2011). A clear SPR signal amplifica￾tion may be produced when using gold films and gold nanoparticles in
the same configuration, in addition to the usage of a pure gold
nanoparticle-based SPR transduction substituting the gold film (Pedersen
& Duncan, 2005). In reality, in addition to the immobilized bioreceptor
unit and the recognized analyte, the surface plasmons on gold nanoparti￾cles cause a disruption of the gold film’s evanescent field.
Gold nanoparticles offer exceptional visual qualities in addition to the
capacity to transmit electrons between a variety of electroactive biological
entities and the electrode. In redox enzyme biosensing, where the biore￾ceptor unit catalyzes the oxidation or reduction of the analyte, this
approach is mostly employed. The generated species are oxidized or
reduced by the electrode in traditional electrochemical enzyme biosensor
setups, producing the electrochemical signal. This method’s drawback is
that observable molecules must diffuse to the electrode, where a sizeable
portion of the solution is wasted. In order to regenerate this biocatalyst,
gold nanoparticles can contact the enzyme’s redox center by transporting
the electrons engaged in the redox reaction to the electrode. This is
known as acting as electron shuttles. An obvious enhancement in the
electrochemical signal is anticipated since such wiring of enzymes elimi￾nates the requirement of enzymatically generated redox species that have
to reach the electrode surface. Using enzymes when metal ions are
involved in the catalytic redox process, as they are for horseradish peroxi￾dase (HRP), might result in very efficient wiring (Xu et al., 2006).
Organometallic and biomass-derived nanostructured materials for biosensing applications 614.5 Magnetic nanoparticles
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which can have a metallic or nonmetallic
background, have lately garnered a lot of attention for biological sensing
in relation to pathogens and nanoscale resolution bio-interactive stimuli
via altered ligandreceptor proximities. MNPs set themselves apart from
their bulk counterparts due to their significantly different magnetic sensi￾tivity (with a high residual magnetism). MNPs might be categorized as
paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, or supra-magnetic depending on their align￾ment in or without an external magnetic field and their 3d-subshell
unpaired electrons (Kolhatkar et al., 2013).
In biosensor devices, magnetic nanoparticles are a viable replacement
for fluorescent labels. Because there are fewer magnetic domains (regions
of parallel-oriented magnetic moments created by interacting unpaired
electrons of an atom) in nanosized magnetic nanoparticles than in their
bulk material, these particles exhibit unusual magnetic behaviors, known
as superparamagnetic behavior. In the absence of an external magnetic
field, magnetization appears to be zero on average and can randomly
change direction within a very short period of time (Neel’s relaxation
time). By using an external magnetic field to align the magnetic moments,
these temperature-dependent phenomena were eliminated. The magnetic
susceptibility of superparamagnets is substantially greater, even though this
effect seems to be identical to that of conventional paramagnetic materials
(Bishop et al., 2009). Therefore, as long as there is no external magnetic
field applied, this superparamagnetic property inhibits attractive or repul￾sive interactions between the magnetic nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparti￾cles used for various applications are shown in Fig. 4.2.
4.6 Metal oxide nanoparticles
Metal oxide nanoparticles (MO NPs) are considered suitable as engineer￾ing biosensors due to their improved biocompatibility, robust absorption,
electronic, catalytic, optical properties, electron transfer kinetics, chemical
stability, and cost-effective preparation (Hahn et al., 2012). Similar to their
metallic counterparts, the form, size, and surface modification of MO NPs
have a significant impact on how effective they are as biosensors (Yi et al.,
2017). The nano-dimensions of metal oxides give a high sensitivity and
selectivity with equivalent metal sensitivity through improved biochemical
interactions with biomedical devices. Significant opportunities for binding
62 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsthe various disease-specific antigens and infection-promoting chemicals
are indicated by the MO NPs’ size-dependent tunneling response. MO
NP sensors have quick signal transduction and analyte sensing tuning
time. Through electrochemical, optical, magnetic, and electrical processes,
a number of MO NPs, including ZnO, TiO2, CeO2, SiO2, NiO, and
Fe3O4, are employed for biological sensing (Yuan et al., 2019). For
screening their unique signaling responses, their size-dependent physico￾chemical characteristics with regulated effects of capping gents are essential
(Ahmad et al., 2018; Luqman et al., 2019; Tripathy et al., 2016). A stron￾ger biological response compared with bare ZnO NPs was made possible
by further modifying their surfaces with dendrimer cages (Gupta et al.,
2019). For improved performance and increased detection specificity in
the biosensing setups, several applications combine numerous MO NPs
(Cai et al., 2015; Tripathy et al., 2016).

Organometallic and biomass-derived nanostructured materials for biosensing applications 63large specific surface, biocompatibility, and simple functionalization,
carbon-based nanomaterials have become more and more prevalent in the
design of sensors and biosensors (Manjunatha et al., 2021; Manjunatha,
2020; Pushpanjali &, Manjunatha, 2020). The unifying strategy used by
the various described approaches for optimizing the (bio)sensor design is
modifying the (bio)sensor surface (Morais, 2021).
Because of their advantageous characteristics, nanostructured carbons like
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Hareesha et al., 2021; Manjunatha Charithra &
Manjunatha, 2020; Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020a; 2020b) and graphene are
frequently utilized as electrical or electrochemical transducers in biosensor
devices (Valentini et al., 2013; Vamvakaki & Chaniotakis, 2007). In particu￾lar, carbon nanotubes have an exceptional fusion of electrical (Manjunatha
et al., 2010), biocompatible, and nanowire morphological features (Battigelli
et al., 2013). As a result, CNT interfaces provide obviously expanded capabil￾ities, such as the ability to approach a redox enzyme’s active regions and con￾nect it to the bulk electrode. Additionally, their simple and well-documented
organic functionalization (Ménard-Moyon et al., 2010) gives nanostructured
electrodes novel features like specialized biomolecule docking sites or redox
mediation of bioelectrochemical interactions. Additionally, CNT films have
high electroactive surface areas as a result of naturally occurring, extremely
porous, three-dimensional networks that are excellent for anchoring a large
number of bioreceptor units, producing high sensitivities (Le Goff et al.,
2011; Wang, 2005).
Due to their distinctive mechanical, electrical, and magnetic character￾istics, CNTs are one of the most common 1D nanomaterials and have
been employed in the past to create a variety of high-performance sensors
and biosensors (Barsan et al., 2015; Meyyappan, 2016). Additionally,
CNTs are excellent candidates to be used in the construction of chemical
and biological sensors with great sensitivity and selectivity because of their
high surface area and strong adsorption capacity toward diverse mole￾cules/biomolecules (Tables 4.1 and 4.2).
According to reports, a number of CNT-based biosensors can screen
the glucose index by immobilizing glucose oxidase through a variety of
ways. These glucose sensors work on the basis that glucose oxidase pro￾duces H2O2 when glucose is present. HRP, which is coupled to an elec￾trode to provide an electrical signal, then reduces the peroxide species. A
glucose oxidase-modified biosensor with hydroquinone acting as a redox
mediator was created in a 2016 study by immobilizing cytochrome C on
the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Eguílaz et al.,

(2017)2016). For this sensor, a minimum glucose detection limit of 8 M was
reported; nevertheless, efficiency was thought to be compromised by the
bound protein on the VTs surface. It was suggested that a lesser degree of
protein immobilization would negatively impair repeatability; as a result,
signal amplification might be provided by crosslinking additional enzymes
on the surface of CNTs. When graphene oxidase was first covalently con￾nected to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the work by
Kwon and colleagues, additional glucose oxidase was then crosslinked
over the covalently attached molecules using glutaraldehyde as a crosslin￾ker (Kwon et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012).
Although graphene-based biosensors are demonstrably more
advanced than CNT-based biosensors (Yang et al., 2010), interest in
this two-dimensional material for bioanalytical applications is steadily
rising. A large variety of graphite-based bulk materials are also referred
to as graphene, in addition to the fabrication of real monolayer gra￾phene sheets from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by
mechanical cleavage using a scotch tape to exfoliate one sheet, by
CVD on metal foils, or using epitaxy techniques where the graphene
layer is formed out of silicon carbide (Bonaccorso et al., 2012).
According to the Hummers and Offeman approach, these compounds
are often produced by mechanical exfoliation (Coleman, 2013; Paton
et al., 2014) or chemical oxidation of graphite (Hummers & Offeman,
1958). This initially called graphitic oxide is now generally known as
graphene oxide and allows obtaining soluble carbon oxide sheets of
undefined layer composition and sizes. The electric conductivity of this
isolating material can be reestablished by chemical, thermal, or electro￾chemical reduction (Kuila et al., 2011). Even when the exceptional
conductivity of real monolayer graphene cannot be obtained, reduced
graphene oxide has other beneficial properties in high-performance
biosensor devices. As for CNTs, graphene-based materials are mostly
used in electrochemical biosensors (Kuila et al., 2011; Ratinac et al.,
2011) where graphene is principally used as electrode material with
enhanced specific surface. In optical or colorimetric biosensor config￾urations, graphene materials can potentially function as the transduc￾tion component itself. For DNA, aptamer, immuno, or protein sensors
(Ma et al., 2012), very effective graphene-based fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) biosensors were created in conjunction with
modified receptor units for organic dye (Li et al., 2010) or quantum
dots (Dong et al., 2010).
66 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications4.8 Conclusion
Nanomaterials have enhanced biological moiety sensing capabilities,
which can be linked to improvements in electron microscopy and quan￾tum mechanics as well as their increased sensitivity. The current state of
better sensing using nanomaterials is quite positive, reducing time,
resources, people, and energy requirements. Without a question, the
healthcare industry continues to be a valuable source of resources, but the
careful monitoring of evolving pathogenic components in infections and
diseases calls for the referral of databases and standardized replies.
Researchers have thoroughly investigated the usage of nanomaterials in
point-of-care applications for biosensor technology. The use of nanoparti￾cles in biosensors significantly enhances their sensitivity, selectivity, quick
response, and low-cost capabilities.
Future perspectives
The goal of biosensor research is to combine electrical and biological sys￾tems to create devices that are quicker, smaller, more affordable, and
more effective. The combination of biosensors with cutting-edge inte￾grated circuits with downsizing, cost-effectiveness, and wireless technol￾ogy may be the future trend. Prior to making a decision to start a new
research development, greater consideration should be given to analytical
chemistry, interactions between biomolecules and nanomaterials, and
technology viability. A new generation of biosensor technologies may be
created by combining nanostructured materials with biosensor transducers
in a number of creative ways. The development of nanomaterials-based
biosensors in recent years has the potential to advance the disciplines of
biosensor research and technology due to their superior mechanical, opti￾cal, magnetic, and electrochemical capabilities. There are, however, a lot
of obstacles to be overcome.

5.1 Introduction
Biosensors belong to the class of electrochemical sensors that can be
obtained by immobilization of different biological species such as proteins,
antigens, antibodies, genetic materials, and amino acids onto or inside
other (nano)materials as goals to provide specific electroactive characteris￾tics to determine specific biological species (Anusha et al., 2022; Krishnan
et al., 2022).
However, it is essential to emphasize that another class of electrochem￾ical biosensors can also be formed only by nanostructures, formed by the
combination of different (nano)materials, called nonenzymatic biosensors,
for also being able to determine biological species in real samples. These
electrochemical biosensors are highly sensitive and specific, have fast
response, easy to operate, have miniaturization possibility, and can be used
for real-time monitoring in different media and point-of-care devices
development (Trojanowicz, 2016).
Nanotechnology is a branch of science that makes it possible to obtain
nanomaterials, materials with at least one dimension with a diameter of less
than 100 nm (1029
m) with applications in different areas such as electronics,
catalysis, nanofiber, medicine, cosmetics, battery, environmental, and biosen￾sors, among others (Ali, 2020; Bhushan, 2017; Christian et al., 2008; Titus
et al., 2019), in addition to allowing the development of tools that will
enable the understanding of the structural properties and physicochemical of
these nanomaterials (Toma, 2016). Nanomaterials are a lot reactive because
they have many surface atoms which can form 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D struc￾tures in the function of atoms arranged. Zero-dimensional (0D) nanomaterials

that no size is outside the nanometer scale. They are part of this classification
group, for example, the quantum dots (QDs), nanoparticles, coreshell, and
nanospheres.
One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have two dimensions on the
nanometer scale and a one-dimensional geometric shape. Therefore “1D”
means that only one size is outside the nanometer scale. They are part of
this classification group, for example, nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods,
and nanoribbons.
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have only one of their dimen￾sions at the nanometer scale. Therefore “2D” means that two of its
dimensions are outside the nanometer scale. They are part of this classifi￾cation group, for example, graphene and thin films.
Three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterials do not have any of their
dimensions on the nanometer scale. Therefore they are called bulk
(Thanh et al., 2014; Tielas et al., 2014).
Each nanometric dimension has energies as a function of the state den￾sity that has an energy related to the mobility capacity of the confinement
effects that give rise to each of the above classifications. From 3D to 2D
material, one of its axes is confined, increasing the mobility of the particle
since the possibility of locomotion of space that was previously three￾dimensional and is now two-dimensional is reduced. The same happens
between 2D1D material and 1D0D (Jayawardhana & Gamalath,
2017). Through nanotechnology, hybrid nanomaterials and nanostructures
can be obtained.
Hybrid nanomaterials can be obtained by the intrinsic combination
(covalent or van de Waals forces) of different nanomaterials resulting in a
single nanomaterial with physicalchemical properties superior to start
materials that can be applied in other areas, mainly in developing electro￾chemical sensors (Canevari, 2022). Nanostructures can be defined by
combining different structures with at least one dimension between 1 and
100 nm favoring the applications in other areas, mainly in electrochemis￾try, due to improving mass transport besides the high number of active
sites on the surface (Centi & Perathoner, 2009). The electrochemical bio￾sensors based on metallic nanostructures have multifunctionalities and var￾ious applications compared to isolated nanomaterials and other materials
with high dimensions (1026 m) and in bulk form. The main route to pro￾ducing metallic nanostructures can be used in the electrochemical
80 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsbiosensors construction which is classified into two approaches, designated
top-down and bottom-up (Abid et al., 2021).
Top-down (from top to bottom) produces nanomaterials from struc￾tures of larger scales, that is, macro-scales, usually through physical pro￾cesses. Force is applied until smaller particles are obtained, carrying out a
method of material fragmentation. A counterpoint is that the material
obtained generally has low granulometric homogeneity due to the
demand for high control of the process variables to refine the particles.
Some examples of processes are evaporation techniques, milling, lithogra￾phy, high-pressure homogenization, ultrasound emulsification, and mem￾brane emulsification.
Bottom-up is a synthesis approach in which atoms and molecules form
nanostructures by controlling chemical reactions under thermodynamic
control based on molecular properties of self-organization. In other words,
the nanostructure is formed by joining atom by atom or molecule by
molecule. Some examples of processes are supramolecular formation,
nanoparticle formation, monolayer autoaggregation, direct autoaggrega￾tion, and probe lithography, among others. According to Table 5.1, some
of the main methods employed for synthesizing nanoparticles and nanos￾tructure can be divided into bottom-up and top-down processes.
It is essential to say that supramolecular chemistry contributes signifi￾cantly to the formation of nanostructured material (Atwood, 2017;
Richard, 2018; RSC & Goddard, 2007) obtained by the bottom-up syn￾thetic route. Supramolecular chemistry is based on forming van der Waals
bonds, mainly hydrogen bonding, favoring the formation of large nanos￾tructures functionalized with excellent electrocatalytic properties that are
constantly employed in the construction of biosensors (Cao et al., 2021;
Khalil-Cruz et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Qian et al., 2022).
Table 5.1 Some of the main methods employed for synthesizing nanoparticles and
nanostructure can be divided into bottom-up and top-down processes.

Wet route Solid route
Fabrication routes for metallic nanostructured electrochemical biosensors 81The methods encompass solid, gaseous, or liquid processes and can
form different types of metallic nanostructure (MN) with different shapes,
sizes, and stabilities.
These different synthetic routes can be employed to obtain metallic
nanostructures used by electrochemical biosensors construction by modi￾fying the surface of glassy carbon and screen-printed electrode with each
other (Hareesha et al., 2021; Manjunatha et al., 2013; Manjunatha, 2018;
Manjunatha et al., 2018; Nambudumada et al., 2020; Raril & Jamballi,
2020; Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020). The metallic nanostructured electro￾chemical biosensors have been employed for the electrochemical determi￾nation of different biological species in real samples.
5.2 Bottom-up process
5.2.1 Solgel method
The solgel method is commonly used to obtain different nanostructures
which are used in other areas (Sanchez et al., 2010), mainly in the con￾struction of electrochemical (bio)sensors (Walcarius, 2001; Yang et al.,
2006). The main advantage of the solgel method is its versatility.
Through the variation of reaction parameters, such as type of metallic pre￾cursor, pH value, type of solvents, and use or not of structural drivers,
they directly impact the morphology: structure, porosity, active sites on
the surface, and mass transport of metallic nanostructures. The solgel
process consists of three steps: hydrolysis of molecular precursors, conden￾sation, and polymerization (Dunn & Zink, 2007), with the condensation
and polymerization steps co-occurring.
Yang et al. (2006) synthesized a Pt-CNT-silicate metallic
nanostructured-based electrochemical biosensor by solgel method. HR￾TEM has probed Pt-CNT-silicate metallic nanostructured formation, and
this nanostructure has been used to incorporate glucose oxidase enzyme.
A Pt-CNT paste-based biosensor has been constructed. The glucose bio￾sensor has shown good electrocatalytic response, in pH 6.98 phosphate
buffer, with a sensitivity of 0.98 μAm M21
cm22 and a linear range from
1 to 25 mM.
Canevari et al. (2011) prepared a SiO2/SnO2/Sb2O5 metallic nanos￾tructured ceramic material, by solgel method, that had been used as a
matrix for immobilization of Meldola’s blue (MB) cationic dye. The XPS
technique and N2 isotherms have characterized the formation of metallic
nanostructured material. This nanostructured material presented porous
82 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationswith a diameter of less than 20 nm and has been employed in constructing
an electrochemical biosensor to determine the cofactor NADH. The
working electrode has been formed through a homogeneous mixture of
the SiO2/SnO2/Sb2O5/MB with graphite (99.99%) and pressed in disk
format. The biosensor presented a good response in the NADH determi￾nation, in the potential of 20.05 V in 1 mol L21 KCl aqueous solution at
pH 7.3. The detection limit calculated was 1.5 3 1027 mol L21
.
Dopamine and ascorbic acid have not shown significant interference in
detecting NADH on this biosensor.
Cincotto et al. (2015) prepared the reduced graphene oxide-Sb2O5, a
metallic nanostructured material, by solgel method, that had been used
as a matrix for the immobilization of laccase enzyme. The XPS technique
and HR-TEM have characterized the formation of metallic nanostruc￾tured material. An electrochemical biosensor for estriol has been con￾structed on a glassy carbon electrode by immobilizing laccase onto
reduced graphene oxide-Sb2O5, a metallic nanostructured material. The
biosensor has shown an excellent response at estriol determination with
high sensitivity (275 mA/M) and a limit of detection of 11 nM. The
estriol determination by biosensor has been performed using thionine as
mediator (1 mM) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.
5.2.2 Chemical vapor deposition
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique is widely used in con￾structing metallic nanostructures for developing biosensors because it can
form thin films of metals and inorganic solids. Good results are achieved
through the choice of suitable molecular precursors. This technique
involves introducing the volatile molecular precursor into a reactor con￾taining the metallic nanostructures onto a metallic substrate in which they
will be electrically heated. In this way, after cooling, a thin film will be
formed on the nanostructure, which may include a thin layer or multiple
layers (Housecroft & Sharpe, 2013).
Gunes et al. (2022), by CVD technique on the nickel metallic surface,
prepared the metallic graphene foam/hematite (GF/α-Fe2O3) nanostruc￾ture. The graphene foam/hematite (GF/α-Fe2O3) nanostructure was
used to build a glucose biosensor by modifying an ITO electrode. SEM,
XPS, Raman, and electrochemical techniques characterized the metallic
nanostructure. Measurements employing the biosensor were performed in
PBS buffer, with pH 7.4. The biosensor showed an excellent response for
Fabrication routes for metallic nanostructured electrochemical biosensors 83glucose determination using the chronoamperometry technique with a
detection limit of 71.6 μM. An interference study was performed by
introducing ascorbic acid (B0.1 mM), mannose (B0.055 mM), and
galactose (B0.032 mM). The ITO/HNC/CS/GOx enzyme electrode
shown to be highly specific to glucose can be employed for glucose deter￾mination in real samples such as human blood, food, and other biological
samples.
Kim et al. (2020) developed a polyallylamine (PI)-based metallic
nanostructured MoS2 2 Au 2 PI through the CVD plasma technique used
to construct a biosensor to determine endocrine hormones: PTH, T3, and
T4. The formation of MoS2 was proven through the XPS technique in
which the binding energies of the Mo41 3d obtained were 229.2 and
233.0 eV, which correspond to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, and the binding
energies of the S2 2 2p peaks showed 163.1 and 164.2 eV. The electro￾chemical biosensor has been fabricated using the ELISA procedure that is
a lot used to produce biosensors taking into account basic immunology
concepts (antigen binding to its specific antibody), allowing the detection
of tiny quantities of antigens, such as antibodies, hormones, proteins, and
peptides, in a real sample. The biosensor showed an excellent response for
PTH, T3, and T4 determination of hormones with a detection limit of
pg mL21
.
5.2.3 Wet route: solvothermal and hydrothermal processes
The wet route is one of the most used synthesis methods to obtain metal￾lic nanostructures in solution because it allows a specific synthesis control
(Tan & Zhang, 2015). Many solvents are used (Liang et al., 2021) in
which various reducing agents are added to form metallic nanoparticles,
such as ascorbic acid, hydrazine, citric acid, ethylene glycol, N,N￾dimethylformamide, borohydride, hydrogen peroxide, and carbon dots,
among others (Lu et al., 2015; Rodrigues et al., 2018). The solvent greatly
influences obtaining metallic nanoparticles, mainly in size and stabilization.
The use of particle directing agents, ionic or neutral, directly influenced
the crystalline form of the nanoparticle (nanostructure) formed (Chen
et al., 2018), in which the nanostructures that show a more excellent sym￾metry present the more minor the energy split of the confined energy
levels.
The hydrothermal and solvothermal methods are part of the wet
route, in which the solvents used are, respectively, water and a solvent
84 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsother than water. In this route, metallic nanoparticles are obtained by
employing high pressure and high temperature using an autoclave (Abid
et al., 2021), favoring homogeneous metallic nanoparticles. Thus the wet
route, including the solvothermal and hydrothermal route, is widely used
to obtain metallic nanostructures in developing (bio)sensors (Cesana et al.,
2020; Han et al., 2016; Povedano et al., 2017).
Povodeno et al. (2017) developed an RhNPs/rGO/Sb2O5 metallic
nanostructure in which rhodium nanoparticles were obtained in situ in
the matrix through the wet route. RhNPs were reduced by adding
sodium borohydride in a rhodium chloride solution. The metallic nanos￾tructure RhNPs/rGO/Sb2O5 has been used as a matrix for developing a
biosensor to determine endocrine interference estriol by laccase immobili￾zation enzyme cross-linking of the enzyme laccase with glutaraldehyde
(Fig. 5.1). The formation of RhNPs was confirmed by HR-TEM
(Fig. 5.1B), with an interplanar spacing of 0.234 nm in agreement with
rGO and 0.613 nm referring to the RhNPs.
The glassy carbon modified with nanostructure metállica Lac-RhNPs/
rGO/Sb2O5 showed an excellent response of the 17β-estradiol with high
sensitivity of 25.7 Am M21
cm21 and a low detection limit of 0.54 ppm
(Fig. 5.2). The measurements have been performed with 17β-estradiol

Yang et al. (2022) prepared a metallic nanostructure containing
reduced graphene oxide/CdS using the hydrothermal method which was
used as a matrix to build a biosensor for hydrogen peroxide by modifying
the surface of the glassy carbon electrode. The metallic nanostructure was
characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X￾ray diffraction (XRD). The biosensor was formed by immobilizing hemo￾globin in the reduced graphene oxide/CdS metallic nanostructure. L￾cysteine was used as a facilitator of hemoglobin anchoring in the matrix,
giving rise to the rGO/Hb/CdS biocomposite. The biosensor showed
good electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide determination with a
detection limit of 6 3 1027 M.
Tarlani et al. (2015) prepared a metallic nanostructure of ZnO/
MWCNTS through a solvothermal process, in which a solution of L￾lysine, L-cysteine (cysteine), and L-arginine (arginine) dissolved in water-
ethanol (1:1 v/v) was used as guides of ZnO nanostructures. SEM and
XRD confirmed that different morphologies had employed this synthetic
route, such as cube, sphere, rod, powder, particle, and candy-like rock.

the ZnO/MWCNT nanostructure supported on a glassy carbon elec￾trode, in which spherical ZnO showed a better response in the determi￾nation of glucose, in PBS, pH 7, and potential of 0.12 V, in comparison
with the other structures with a detection limit of 0.82 mM and sensitivity
of 64.29μA cm22 mM21
. This biosensor was used for glucose determina￾tion in real samples.
5.2.4 Electrochemical process
The electrochemical method is widely used to obtain nanomaterials
because it is a versatile method, in addition to allowing control of the size
of the nanomaterials obtained as a function of the distance between the
electrodes, reaction time, and applied potential (Deng et al., 2014). The
electrochemical method is the bottom-up process when solvents are used
as precursors (Ramimoghadam et al., 2014). The top-down is used when
an electrode containing the material is obtained from the nanoparticles
(Ming et al., 2012).
Thus carbon nanoparticles, also known as carbon dots, commonly
obtained by electrochemical means and other methods, have been used as
catalysts and reducing agents for the construction of metallic nanostruc￾tures that are used as a matrix in the construction of electrochemical bio￾sensors (Wang et al., 2021).
Canevari et al. (2017) prepared a metallic nanostructure based on mag￾netite/carbon quantum dots (MagNP/C-dots), in which carbon dots
were previously prepared through the bottom-up electrochemical route.
As shown in Fig. 5.3, the MagNP/C-dots metallic nanostructure was
characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high￾resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) techniques.
The metallic nanostructure based on magnetite/carbon quantum dots
(MagNP/C-dots) was kept on the surface of a printed carbon electrode
with a magnet connected to the outside, allowing for better dispersion of
MagNP/C-dots on the surface. The glassy carbon electrode modified
with MagNP/C-dots was used to determine the coenzyme NADH,
which showed an excellent response at pH 7.0, with a detection limit of
20 nM as shown in Fig. 5.4. Another essential piece of information is
related to the electrode’s ability to determine NADH in serum and not
suffer significant interference from other species, such as dopamine, ascor￾bic acid, and uric acid.
Fabrication routes for metallic nanostructured electrochemical biosensors 875.3 Top-down process
5.3.1 Plasma sputtering
The plasma sputtering method is widely used in the formation of nanos￾tructured thin films of different compositions, which are applied in the
production of catalysts, coating of automotive parts, and the construction
of support for the development of electrochemical (bio)sensors. The
plasma sputtering method is widely used in constructing nanostructured
films because it is a nonthermal vaporization process performed under low
pressures (Abegunde et al., 2019). Generally, the plasma equipment used
to form nanostructured films consists of a sputtering source, gas supply,
substrate holder, evacuated chamber, and electrode. The eject particles of
elements that will form the nanostructure are formed by discharge sources
by applying an electric potential in the electrode, in a gas phase, and in a
low-pressure environment. The electrons accelerated will collide with gas
particles, emerging called plasma. These plasma-containing ions are the
source of sputtering (Maqbool et al., 2007; Nguyen & Yonezawa, 2018).
Ogurcovs et al. (2022) developed a biosensor by modifying the metal￾lic nanostructured film obtained through the plasma sputtering technique.
The Al:ZnO thin film of nanostructured material was prepared on the
polyimide substrate surface. The chemical composition and morphology

Then, the biosensor was formed by immobilizing single-stranded OPE-01
DNA primers onto a polyimide substrate modified with Al:ZnO thin film
of nanostructured material. The biosensor showed an excellent response
in DNA determination.
Tang et al. (2022) developed the metallic nanostructure NiCo￾LDH@Cu hetero-nanosheet array by plasma magnetron sputtering that
served as a nonenzymatic biosensor for glucose determination in human
serum. The NiCo-LDH@Cu nanofilm was characterized by X-ray dif￾fraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelec￾tron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high￾resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and atomic force
microscopy (AFM). The biosensor showed a detection limit (LOD) of
157 nmol L21
.

Fabrication routes for metallic nanostructured electrochemical biosensors 895.3.2 Milling
The milling process is a mechanical method that produces nanoparticles
or metallic nanostructures through friction, mainly through direct contact
between the bead mining and the sample. The nanostructure mill and ball
size are highly influenced by ball mass, mass size and magnitude, sample
quantity, and sample shape. It is a technique widely used to complement
the different metallic nanostructures (Caicedo et al., 2020; Lobo et al.,
2019; Moghaddam, et al., 2018; Otis et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2020).
In this sense, Li et al. (2021) prepared a two-dimensional Mo2C/
Mo2N nanostructure by ball milling at high temperature (800°C under an
H2 1 N2 gas atmosphere) that has been used as a support for the construc￾tion of the chlorpyrifos aptasensor (CPF). The glassy carbon electrode
modified with the nanostructure was decorated with gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) and then was modified with a ferrocene (Fc) probe via AuS
bonds. The aptasensor constructed with oligonucleotide DNA showed an
excellent limit of detection of 0.036 ng mL21 being applied to determine
CPF in real samples.
Zhang et al. (2015) prepared a metallic nanostructure by combining
graphene nanosheets, chitosan, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The graphene/
chitosan nanostructure was obtained using a ball mill and then decorated
with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. AFM confirmed the formation of the metallic
nanostructure, and XPS confirmed the presence of functional groups such
as N-carboxylic acid. The biosensor was obtained through the immobili￾zation of glucose oxidase (GOx) via covalent linkage due to the presence
of carboxylic groups from chitosan. The biosensor showed a good glucose
detection response with a detection limit of 16 μM and sensitivity of
5.658 mA cm22 M21
.
5.3.3 Laser ablation
The laser ablation method is widely used in the production of metallic
nanostructures because it takes into account the incidence of high￾intensity lasers on the surface of different solid materials, most commonly
metals, immersed in other solvents, ripping off molecules and atoms,
which will form the nanostructures (Huang et al., 2019; Mintcheva et al.,
2018; Ravi-Kumar et al., 2019).
In this sense, Kalita et al. (2012) developed a metallic nickel nanostruc￾ture by applying the laser ablation technique, which was used to modify
the surface of the ITO electrode. The NiNPs/ITO electrode was
90 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsmodified with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene carbodiimide
(EDC) to create functional groups for covalent immobilization of anti￾aflatoxin (a-AfB1) monoclonal antibodies. The formation of NiNPs was
confirmed by HR-TEM. This biosensor AfB1/DMSO/RnNi-film/ITO
was used to determine toxins in food showing good electrocatalytic
response with a detection limit of 32.7 ng dL21 and sensitivity of 0.59 LA
ng21 dL21
. Electrochemical measurements were performed in phosphate
buffer, pH 7.
5.4 Conclusions
This work has demonstrated different synthetic routes to obtain metallic
nanostructures that will serve as a substrate for developing other electro￾chemical biosensors used to determine other species in real samples. As
can be seen, each synthetic route, bottom-up and top-down, confers dif￾ferent physicochemical properties that allow the constructed biosensors to
present excellent electrocatalytic responses due to the improvement in the
electron transfer process. This allows other biosensors containing metallic
nanostructures to be built through different routes, making electrochemi￾cal biosensors increasingly present in medical centers and self-analysis
because they are easy to use, have quick response, and can be used with￾out the need for advanced training.

6.1 Introduction to sensors
A receptortransducer sensor device is used to convert a biological response
into an electrical signal. The design and development of biosensors have
attained a greater interest nowadays because biosensors find widespread
applications in the medical field, diagnosis of the disease, ecology monitor￾ing, and maintaining the quality of food, drug, and water. The biosensing
devices attained a greater demand and face many challenges to fabricate
the sensing device with better sensitivity, a lower limit of detection, good
stability, quick response time, reduced device size, and simple operation.
These challenges can be fulfilled by the interphase of chemical and mor￾phological properties of the nanomaterials with the sensor technology. The
nanomaterials from zero to three dimensions are having advantageous prop￾erties like high surface area, enhanced conductivity, and tunable electrical
and mechanical properties making these nanomaterials potential candidates
to fabricate biosensors. Among the nanomaterials, nanoparticles, nanowires,
and nanorods find advantageous properties because of their high stability,
high carrier capacity, high detection limit, large surface area, active sites,
and more thermal conductivity. The ferrites, polymers, metal, metal oxides,
carbon-based materials, and their composites are widely used in the fabrica￾tion of biosensors. In this chapter, the evolution of the sensors, types of
sensors, and biosensor types are discussed deliberately. This chapter provides

biosensors using nanomaterials.
In this modern world, as awareness of man increased to lead a sophisti￾cated life, the need for science and technology has gained momentum
(Amrutha et al., 2021; Chethan et al., 2019; Gleiter, 2000; Hareesha &
Manjunatha, 2021; Hareesha et al., 2021; 2021; Manjunatha et al., 2014;
Pal et al., 2011; Pushpanjali et al., 2021; Tigari & Manjunatha, 2019;
Manjunatha, 2020). Nowadays civilized people depend more on the gad￾gets like computers, Xerox machines, air conditioning, cell phones, televi￾sion, smoke detectors, and refrigerators. Many of these gadgets work with
the help of sensors. The term sensor refers to a device or module that
assists in detecting changes in physical quantities, such as pressure, heat,
humidity, movement, force, and an electrical quantity like current, and
then turns these physical quantities into signals that can be monitored and
analyzed. Sensors are the brains of measuring systems. An ideal sensor
should have the following qualities: high resolution, reproducibility,
repeatability, range, drift, calibration, sensitivity, selectivity, and linearity
(Chethan et al. 2022, 2023; Chethan et al., 2018; Chethan Ramana et al.,
2019; El-Denglawey et al., 2021; El-Denglawey Manjunath et al., 2021;
Manjunatha et al., 2019; Pratibha & Chethan, 2022; Pratibha et al., 2020;
Ravikiran & Chethan, 2022; Rupashree et al., 2021; Shanawad Chethan
et al., 2023; Shanawad et al., 2023; Sunilkumar et al., 2023).
Today, we benefit from science and technological advancements that
make our lives run more smoothly. We frequently rely on various devices
that help us to interact with the physical environment, such as television
remote controls, smoke detectors, infrared (IR) thermometers, lamp switches,
and fans. Due to numerous applications, including environmental and food
quality monitoring, medical diagnostics and health care, automotive and
industrial manufacture, as well as space, defense, and security, the advance￾ment of sensor technology has assumed increasing significance (Dincer et al.,
2019; Ensafi et al., 2011; Ensafi, 2019; Theavenot et al., 2001).

Depending on the physical quantity and analyte to be measured, sensors
can be broadly categorized into a number of categories, which include:
(1) energy source, (2) physical contact, (3) comparability, (4) analog and
digital sensors, and (5) signal detection. Based on these quantities, sensors
are broadly classified as follows (Khanna, 2012; White, 1987).
98 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsEnergy source: Two types of sensors are employed based on energy
sources:
1. Active and passive sensors: Active sensors, such as microphones,
thermistors, strain gauges, and capacitive and inductive sensors, require
an external energy source. These kinds of sensors are known as paramet￾ric sensors (the output depends on the parameter). Thermocouples, pie￾zoelectric sensors, and photodiodes are examples of passive sensors that
produce signals without requiring external energy. These sensors are
referred to as self-generating sensors.
2. Physical contact: Based on physical contact, sensors can be classified as
contact or noncontact.
3. Contact and noncontact sensors: Contact sensors, like temperature
sensors, need to make physical touch with their stimulus, whereas
noncontact sensors include optical, magnetic, and infrared (IR)
thermometers.
4. Comparability sensors can be either absolute or relative.
5. Absolute and relative sensors: Thermistors and strain gauges are
examples of absolute sensors. Relative sensors, such as a thermocouple
that measures temperature differences and a pressure gauge that mea￾sures pressure, relative to atmospheric pressure, perceive the stimulus
in relation to a fixed or changing reference.
6. Analog and digital sensors: Sensors come in two varieties: analog
and digital. An analog sensor converts a measured physical quantity
into an analog form (continuous in time). This group of analog sensors
includes thermocouples, strain gauges, and resistance temperature
detectors (RTDs). Pulses are the output that a digital sensor produces.
Encoders fall under the category of digital sensors.
7. Signal detection:
The basic classification of sensors based on signal detection and trans￾formation of information is as follows:
a. Physical sensors: A physical quantity is measured by a physical sen￾sor, which then transforms into a signal that the user can recognize.
The force, acceleration, rate of flow, mass, volume, density, and pres￾sure are just a few of the environmental changes that these sensors
can identify. The use of physical sensors has increased significantly in
the biomedical industry, especially with the development of novel
measurement technologies and the improvement of microelectrome￾chanical system technology for the creation of more precise and smal￾ler sensors.
Design of nanostructured biosensors based on organic and other composite materials 99b. Thermal sensors: A thermal sensor is a device that measures the
temperature of an environment and converts the measured data into
electronic data for recording or monitoring temperature change sig￾nals. Thermistors, RTDs, and thermocouples are a few types of tem￾perature sensors.
c. Biological sensors: Biological sensors keep an eye on biomolecular
interactions like those involving antibodies and antigens, DNA and
enzymatic reactions, or cellular communication. The abbreviated form
of the term “biosensors” refers to biological sensors.
d. Chemical sensors: The International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry defines a chemical sensor as a device that converts chemical
information into an analytically useful signal ranging from the concen￾tration of a particular sample component to total composition analysis.
Chemical sensors are used to keep an eye on the quantity or activity
of the relevant chemical species in the gaseous or liquid phase. In
addition, they are used to monitor assays for organophosphorus che￾micals, food and drug analyses, and environmental pollution. They
can be utilized for clinical diagnostic applications as well.
6.1.2 Biosensor
A biosensor is a tool or probe that combines an electronic component
with a biological element, like an enzyme or antibody, to produce a
quantifiable signal. Information about a physiological change or the pres￾ence of different chemical or biological components in the environment is
detected, recorded, and transmitted by the electronic component.
Biosensors are available in a variety of sizes and designs, and they have the
ability to measure and detect even very low quantities of certain diseases,
harmful chemicals, and pH values. Certain static and dynamic require￾ments are required to develop a highly effective and capable biosensor sys￾tem. These requirements allow for the optimization of the biosensors’
performance for commercial applications.
6.1.2.1 Constituents of biosensors
The main constituents of biological sensors comprise of:
1. Analyte: A material of interest whose components are being deter￾mined or detected is an analyte. The biological constituents may be in
the form of glucose, lactose, ammonia, and glucose (Bhalla et al., 2016).
2. Transducer: One crucial component of a biosensor is the transducer
which is a device that converts energy from one form to another.
100 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsIt transforms the biorecognition event into an electrical signal that is
quantifiable and connected to the quantity or the presence of a chemi￾cal or biological target.
3. Bioreceptor: Bioreceptors are biological components such as
enzymes, cells, aptamers, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and
antibodies that are capable of recognizing the target substrate.
Biorecognition is the process of producing a signal when a bioreceptor
and an analyte interact.
4. Electronics: To get the signal ready for the display, it is processed.
Amplification and digitalization take place on the electrical signals col￾lected from the transducer. The display unit quantifies the signals that
have been processed.
5. Display: The display unit is made up of a user interpretation system,
such as a computer or a printer, that provides the output so that the
user can read and understand the appropriate response according to
the end-user requirement.
6.1.2.2 Evolution of biosensors
Leland Charles Clark Jr., the father of the biosensors, reported about the
components of the biosensors in this work in the year 1956. He fabricated
the electrode which is possible to determine the oxygen content in the
blood. Later in 1962, Clark reported about the amperometric enzyme
electrode for glucose detection. In the upcoming year 1967, Updike and
Hicks modified the Clarks work and find out the first functional enzyme
electrode for oxygen sensor. After, in 1969 Guilbault and Montalvo
depicted the first urea detection sensor based on potentiometric enzyme
electrode. In the year 1973, Guilbault and Lubrano fabricated the hydro￾gen peroxide detection sensor based on the lactate enzyme sensor. In this
way, many researchers have fabricated many biosensors in these years.
6.1.2.3 Characteristics of biosensors
There are some static and dynamic conditions that must be met to create
a highly effective and powerful biosensor system. These requirements
allow for the performance of the biosensors to be enhanced for commer￾cial applications which are as follows.
Selectivity: When choosing a bioreceptor for a biosensor, selectivity
is an important attribute to be taken into account. A bioreceptor may
identify a specific target analyte molecule in a sample that contains unde￾sired pollutants and admixture compounds.
Design of nanostructured biosensors based on organic and other composite materials 101Sensitivity: It is defined as the smallest amount of analyte that can be
accurately detected or recognized in the fewest steps at low concentrations
(ng mL21 or fg mL21
) to confirm the presence of analyte traces in the
sample.
Linearity: Linearity helps ensure that the findings of measurements
are accurate. The substrate concentration can be detected at higher levels
when linearity (straight line) is increased.
Reproducibility: Reproducibility is defined by precision (similar out￾put when the sample is measured multiple times) and accuracy (the ability
of a sensor to generate a mean value that is more closely related to the
actual value when the sample is sampled multiple times). When the same
sample is analyzed more than once, the biosensor’s ability to produce the
same results is what matters.
Stability: One essential quality in biosensor applications where ongo￾ing monitoring is necessary is stability. Stability is the degree to which the
biosensing equipment is vulnerable to environmental perturbations both
inside and outside. The affinity of the bioreceptor (the degree of analyte
binding to the bioreceptor) and bioreceptor degradation with time are the
variables that determine stability.
Response period: It is playing a very crucial role in selecting the
best sensor which is having short response time and recovery time factors
which implies its effectiveness.
6.1.3 Classification of biosensors based on bioreceptors
Bioreceptors are regarded as the key element in the development of bio￾sensors, as it was previously discussed. Enzymatic biosensors are the most
prevalent type of biosensor. Other types include immunosensors, which
have high specificity and sensitivity and are particularly useful in diagnosis,
aptamer- or nucleic acid-based biosensors, which have high specificity for
microbial strains and nucleic acid-containing analytes, and microbial or
whole-cell biosensors.
The second division is based on the transducer, and the sensors are
divided into the following groups: electrochemical (which is further
divided into potentiometric, amperometric, impedance, and conducto￾metric groups), electronic biosensor, thermal biosensor, optical, and mass￾based or gravimetric. Bioreceptoranalyte combinations fall under a
different group and are few. Various classifications are made based on the
technology (nano, surface plasmon resonance [SPR], biosensors-on-chip
102 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications[lab-on-chip], electrometers, and deployable) and the detection sensor sys￾tems (optical, electrical, electronic, thermal, mechanical, and magnetic).
According to the quantity of interactions between analyte and biorecep￾tor, transducers produce visual or electrical signals. The working principle
divides transducers into the following major categories: electrochemical,
optical, thermal, electronic, and gravimetric transducers. Depending on
the input, the output may take the form of a figure, numerical, graphic, or
tabular result.
Catalytic and affinity/noncatalytic biosensors are two categories of bio￾sensors that fall under the biorecognition principle. Analytebioreceptor
interaction leads to the creation of a novel biochemical reaction product
in a catalytic biosensor. Enzymes, microbes, tissues, and entire cells are all
a part of this biosensor. An irreversible binding between the analyte and
the receptor occurs in the case of affinity (noncatalytic) biosensors, and no
new biochemical reaction product is produced as a result of the contact.
The detection targets for this sort of sensor include antibodies, cell recep￾tors, and nucleic acids.
6.1.3.1 Enzyme-based biosensors
Enzymes are typical biocatalysts that are effective at accelerating the rate
of biological reaction. An enzyme-based biosensor’s operation is based on
the catalytic reaction and binding properties for detecting the target ana￾lyte. The process of recognizing analytes involves a number of potential
mechanisms: analyte concentration is correlated with decreased enzymatic
product formation because
1 The analyte is metabolized by the enzyme.
2 The analyte activates the enzyme.
3 The enzyme concentration is tracked by monitoring the change in
enzyme characteristics.
Because enzyme-based biosensors have a long history, different biosen￾sors can be created based on the specificity of the enzyme. Improving the
sensitivity, stability, and flexibility of the enzyme structure is costly and
difficult due to the exceedingly sensitive nature of the enzyme structure.
For enzyme-based biosensors, electrochemical transducers are most fre￾quently employed. Glucose and urea biosensors are the most used
enzyme-based biosensors. Due to the long history of enzyme-based bio￾sensors, many biosensors can be developed depending on the specificity of
the enzyme (Schroeder & Cavacini, 2010).
Design of nanostructured biosensors based on organic and other composite materials 1036.1.3.2 Antibody-based biosensors
Affinity biorecognition elements like antibodies have been in use for
more than 20 years due to their broad variety of applications and potent
antigenantibody interactions. Immunoglobulins (Ig) have a “Y” shape
with two heavy and two light polypeptide chains joined by disulfide
bonds, and antibodies have this structure as well. Immunosensors are bio￾sensors that rely on the interaction between an antibody and an antigen
or that incorporate antibodies as ligands.
There are two types of immunosensors:
1 Nonlabeled and
2 Labeled.
To precisely identify the antigenantibody complex, nonlabeled
immunosensors are built by calculating the physical alterations brought on
by the formation of the complex. An easily detectable label is added in
the case of labeled immunosensors (Bhardwaj et al., 2021).
6.1.3.3 Aptamer-based biosensors
The synthetic single-stranded nucleic acids known as aptamers can fold
into two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures and can
bind to target molecules in a selective manner. Because there is less spatial
blocking and more surface area on the targets in 2D or 3D structures,
their binding efficiency is high. Aptamers are nucleic acid molecules,
which makes them physically and functionally stable throughout a wide
variety of temperatures and storage conditions. Aptamers may be chemi￾cally synthesized, are stable in the pH range of 212, and have some
thermal refolding properties, in contrast to antibodies, which must be pro￾duced by biological systems. Aptamers also have the advantage of being
chemically altered to meet the detection requirements for the target mole￾cule. Fluorescent nanoparticles, like QDs, offer significant advantages over
conventional fluorescent dyes for tracking biological systems in real time.
AptamerQD conjugates were employed to pinpoint targets, including
cancer cells, bacterial spores, and proteins (He et al., 2021).
6.1.3.4 Whole-cell-based biosensors
Since microbes (bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, and viruses) have the
potential to serve as biorecognition components, they are used in the con￾struction of whole-cell-based biosensors. They can manufacture recogni￾tion components, such as antibodies, on their own and without the need
104 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsof extraction and purification. Whole-cell-based biosensors are simple to
use and are developing quickly compared to animal or plant cells.
The whole-cell-based biosensor principle states that the cells may inter￾act with a wide range of analytes, display the electrochemical response
that a transducer can detect, and communicate. These biosensors were
effectively used in environmental monitoring, food analysis, pharmacology,
heavy metals, pesticides, detection of organic pollutants, and drug screening
due to their high selectivity, good sensitivity, and capability of detection
(Riangrungroj et al., 2019).
6.1.3.5 Nanoparticle-based biosensors
A new class of bioreceptor nanomaterials have recently been proposed in
addition to the ones mentioned above. Numerous nanomaterials have
been used as bioreceptors as a result of advances in nanotechnology and
nanoscience. In terms of biosensing applications, nanoparticles offer a
wider variety in both transducers and bioreceptors. For instance, nanoma￾terials based on cerium oxide show catalytic activity that is bioreceptor￾friendly and mimics biological processes. Many inorganic materials,
including graphene- and CNT-based nanomaterials, noble metal nanopar￾ticles, and quantum dots, have been successfully used as transducers
because of their effective transduction capabilities.
6.1.4 Emerging nanomaterials used in the fabrication of
biosensors
Through specific self-assembly techniques nanomaterials are synthesized. These
nanomaterials have many distinct properties including electrical, mechanical,
optical, and magnetic. Nowadays, many nanomaterials are used in drug deliv￾ery, bloodless surgery, multifunctional device fabrication, and the fabrication of
biosensors. Nanomaterial-based biosensors have attained advanced properties
compared to conventional biosensors. These nanobiosensors got epitome sensi￾tivity, stability, and selectivity for the detection of various biomolecules.
Advanced nanomaterials are broadly classified into two types: 2D tran￾sition metals and 2D organic polymers.
6.1.4.1 Two-dimensional transition metals
Transition metals are those elements in groups 411 in the periodic table.
Due to its intriguing characteristics, including a significant surface area and
an ultrathin planar structure, transition metal nanomaterials can be used to
create biosensors.
Design of nanostructured biosensors based on organic and other composite materials 1056.1.4.1.1 Transition metal chalcogenides
The transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are a class of 2D graphene
cognate/nanosheets that are considered to be advanced. They are typically
represented by the formula MX2, which stands for a hexagonal layer of a
transition metal (M) and two layers of chalcogen (X). They can be made
using a variety of techniques, such as mechanical cleavage, epitaxial
growth, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
Recently, a hybrid structure of blue phosphorene (BlueP)/TMDCs, gra￾phene, and AgAu bimetallic sheets was used to create a surface plasmon
resonance (SPR)-based biosensor. The study’s findings showed that com￾pared to traditional biosensors, the monolayer BlueP/MoS2 and graphene
structure significantly increase the biosensor’s sensitivity by 19.73%.
A photoelectrochemical immunosensor for the detection of carci￾noembryonic antigen was made using tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanosheets
in a different investigation. According to the performed investigation, the
photoelectrochemical responses of WS2 combined with GNPs were
improved (Singh et al., 2020). To achieve photoelectrical immune sensing
of the antigen in clinical samples, the nanocomposite was coated onto a
glass surface, and then, antibodies specific to carcinoembryonic antigens
were immobilized. Additionally, 2D TMDC-derived quantum dots have
demonstrated their value in the optical detection of neurotransmitters
without the use of antibodies.
6.1.4.1.2 Advanced transition metal oxides
Comparable to TMDCs, transition metal oxide displays a variety of dis￾tinctive qualities, such as electrocatalytic and magnetic capabilities, which
make them a fantastic choice for use in the construction of biosensors.
Due to their distinctive electrical, optical, and chemical properties in com￾parison to other transition metal oxides (TMOs), manganese oxides are
the most widely employed advanced materials in sensing applications.
TMOs and 2D transition metal carbides were combined in a recent work
to create a biosensor.
For the separation and purification of proteins, a biosensor based on
molecularly imprinted polymers has been developed. In this study, the
surface of tubular carbon fibers with carboxyl modifications was grown
with MnO2 nanosheets. The outcomes demonstrated that the develop￾ment of MnO2 shells increases the quantity of protein-imprinting sites.
An electrochemical biosensor was created to detect hydrogen peroxide
using a MnO2graphene nanosheet nanocomposite on a glassy
106 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationselectrode. The findings of this study showed that TMOs’ electrocatalytic
activity is beneficial in the oxidation of H2O2, which results in the
catalytic activity of the biosensor at extremely low concentrations.
Metalorganic gels were utilized to create copper oxide nanoparticles,
another TMO that can mimic peroxidase activity and be used to detect
cholesterol and glucose. To create diverse nanostructures for drug deliv￾ery, therapy, and the monitoring of various diseases, 2D organic polymers
are utilized. These polymers have the ability to mimic a wide range of
biomolecules. These sensors have promising applications in clinical medi￾cine, food analysis, environmental analysis, and other fields.
6.1.4.2 Two-dimensional organic polymers
Due to their exceptional qualities, including great flexibility and tunabil￾ity, ultrathin structure, and adaptability, organic polymers have been
employed extensively which are still in demand. Modified metalorganic
frameworks and polypeptides are the two organic polymers in this group
that are most frequently employed, and they have become the preferred
materials for making biosensors.
6.1.4.2.1 Metalorganic frameworks
Inorganic and organic crystalline porous hybrid materials are arranged in
metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) to form a cage-like structure.
Typically, positively charged metal ions are surrounded by organic linker
molecules. A MOF’s hollow structure provides an incredibly large inter￾nal surface area which greatly increases its utility. Photodynamic treat￾ment for tumors can be performed with organic polymer-based MOFs.
By using platinum nanoparticles to magnify the signals, a MOF-based
biosensing device has also been created for the detection of neurotrans￾mitters. A MOF containing 2D palladium nanosheets, doxorubicin, and
polydopamine was used to create a theranostic nanoplatform to improve
biocompatibility. The application of this mixture as a medication deliv￾ery component resulted from its impressive photothermal conversion
and optoacoustic properties. As a result, these nanoparticles can be used
successfully in applications for sensing, imaging, and drug delivery when
combined with other materials. They can also be employed for both
treatment and bacterial eradication. A biosensor for augmented anti￾infective therapy has been created using 2D carbon nanosheets generated
from MOFs.
Design of nanostructured biosensors based on organic and other composite materials 1076.1.4.2.2 Black phosphorous
The most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus is called black
phosphorous (BP). Phosphorene, also known as BP, offers important
characteristics as a nanomaterial, including strong electroconductivity, an
ambipolar field effect, high carrier mobility, and an adjustable bandgap.
For the purpose of creating biosensors for the diagnosis and treatment of
various diseases in recent years, numerous researchers have employed BP.
The application of a 3D BP nanoscaffold for recovering neurogenesis was
the subject of a revolutionary work which is presented in the year 2020.
For instance, cellulose hydrogels were used in the construction of 2D
BP nanosheets (BPNSs) for photothermal therapy against cancer. These
hydrogels and BPNS 3D networks have improved stability, strong photo￾thermal responsiveness, and flexibility. The clinical study demonstrates the
unique applications of this nanoplatform which is also 100% safe and bio￾compatible. In another fascinating study, BP was used to construct a 3D￾printed scaffold that participates in bone regeneration and is intended to
be used in the photothermal ablation therapy of osteosarcoma. As a result,
researchers frequently use BP to create nanodevices for the treatment of
diseases due to their photothermal characteristics. A 2D fingerprint nanop￾robe based on BP has been used to demonstrate an enhanced fabrication
method for biological surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) charac￾terization. This work created flake-shaped BPgold nanoparticle nanohy￾brid theranostic nanoplatforms for phototherapy, bioimaging, and drug
delivery. Genome editing, antibacterial effectiveness, photodynamic anti￾cancer therapy, imaging, and cancer theranostics have all utilized BP￾containing biosensors.
6.1.5 Distinct platforms in the fabrication of advanced
biosensor devices
In these decades, more advanced biosensing devices are fabricated using
different device fabrication techniques. These biosensors are fabricated by
many more techniques, viz., ion beams, microfluidics, near-field electro￾spinning, lab-on-a-chip, and chip calorimetry. Fabrication of the inte￾grated biosensing device for local and real-time sensing applications got
epitome scope. Micro- and nanoscale patterning on the surface of the sen￾sor enhances the sensing performances by getting over the surface-based
limitations. Miniaturization in device fabrication has helped to get remark￾able sensing performances in biosensors. Several types of biosensors based
108 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationson the different fabrication techniques are made, and they depicted better
sensitivity and little limit of detection. Nowadays, versatile biosensors are
being fabricated to detect various biomarkers or diseases, namely, cancer,
cholesterol, bacterial infection, and exosomes.
6.1.5.1 Focused ion beam technique
This technique is usually used for the deposition of nanomaterials. These
days, this technique has got widened the scope for the fabrication of the
biosensing device. The probe attached to the ion beam is used for the fab￾rication of the biosensing devices. This technique is the more consistent
way of preparing biosensing devices. Many more modifications are applied
to the focused ion beam (FIB) technique to fabricate more reliable nano￾biosensor devices. The FIB-made biosensors are compact, less costly, and
can be used as a refractive index for various chemical and biological sens￾ing applications (Erdman et al., 2019).
Principle: High- and low-gallium ion-beam focusing is used for site￾specific sputtering in this technique.
Advantages: Multiple specimens are formed in a small area and are
time efficient, and beam strength can be adjusted.
Disadvantages: The use of gallium may contaminate the samples,
and physical and electrical properties can be affected.
6.1.5.2 Electrospinning
This is the oldest technique used by researchers for many decades.
According to their convenience, the researchers have made many modifi￾cations to this technique for the fabrication of biosensors. By decreasing
the electrode gap distance, one can successfully deposit the nanomaterials
on the sensing device. Through the electrospray technique, this technique
has evolved. M13 bacteriophage microfabrication has been achieved with
this technique (He et al., 2017).
Principle: By decreasing the spinning gap, controllable deposition can
be achieved.
Advantages: This method is simple and cost-effective, and large-scale
processing is possible. All polymers (high molecular weight) can be easily
processed by this method.
Disadvantages: This method is not suitable for 3D structures, and
synergistic porosity for achieving good biosensing is unable to be achieved
by this method.
Design of nanostructured biosensors based on organic and other composite materials 1096.1.5.3 Paper-based microfluidics
This technique is based on the principle of fluid action. The paper-based
devices are easy to fabricate and of less cost. Usually, cellulose paper is
used for the fabrication of the device followed by computer-based print￾ing. The printing can be performed through different methods, namely,
wax printing, laser printing, and conducting inkjet printing. Among these
printing techniques, wax printing is widely used because it is effective,
easier, and cost-effective. These paper-based microfluid devices will per￾form better sensitivity than other techniques. The paper-based CMOS
photodiode biosensor is used to detect and diagnose sepsis (Hu et al.,
2020). By using this paper-based sensing device, biomarkers are formed to
detect glucose and lactate in human serum. A 3D paper-based sensing
device with glucose detection has been developed to detect silver ions
(Xiao et al., 2019).
Principle: This method is mainly based on fluidic actuation.
Advantages: This method is of low cost, easily desirable, simple, pos￾sibility of rapid detection, flexible substrate, easily degradable, and eco￾friendly.
Disadvantages: This method is limited to multiple detections, it is
not operable at room temperature, and extra heating is very much neces￾sary for proper sensing.
6.1.5.4 Microelectromechanical systems
Microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs), nanoelectromechanical systems
(NEMSs), and bio-nano-electromechanical systems (bio-NEMS) are the
major biosensing fabrication techniques used for micro- and nanoscale
device fabrication. For the detection of biochemical components, MEMS
fabrication techniques are widely used (Bryzek, 2005). Bio-NEMS tech￾nique is majorly used to detect highly complex biochemical components.
Moreover, the MEMS techniques are used in biosensors for diagnosis of
diseases, therapeutics, and monitoring ecosystem and human health. To
detect genome bacteria and viruses, a miniaturized silicon-chip biosensor
has been fabricated by the MEMS technique (Battaglia et al., 2019).
Principle: This method is mainly based on capacitive piezoresistive
resonant thermoelectric principle.
Advantages: Industrial production is possible, cost-effective, and low
power consumption is possible for device fabrication.
Disadvantages: For the production of a single unit, it is too expen￾sive, especially during the initial developmental stage.
110 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications6.1.5.5 Surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor
Using incident light to stimulate the electrons at the interfaces of the
material is the basic technique of the SPR technique. An SPR biosensor
is used to detect the gluten in the urine samples of people to detect celiac
disease. A highly sensitive biosensor to detect microRNA was developed
(Wei et al., 2020).
Principle: The incident polarized light falls on the metal film at the
interface of the media with varying refractive index (RI).
Advantages: Miniaturized devices can be prepared with this method,
and the devices prepared through this method are highly sensitive.
Disadvantages: Calibration has to be done for a long time.
6.1.5.6 Whispering-gallery-mode biosensors
Whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) biosensing devices are very much sen￾sitive to biomolecules and chemical ions. Usually, this technique is used
for the examination of the modifications occurring on the surface of the
material. For the ultrasensitive detection of the biomolecules, this method
is preferable. For the detection of the grapevine virus, an optical immuno￾sensor device was fabricated using the WGM resonator technique (Fu
et al., 2020; Tereshchenko et al., 2020).
Principle: It works on the principle of the wave that travels on the
concave surface.
Advantages: Q-factor is high, low mode volumes, small size, easy to
integrate with the chip, and high tenability.
Disadvantages: Bending loss and evanescent coupling loss are
observed.
6.2 Conclusion
In these decades, tremendous improvements happened in the fabrication
of biosensor devices for better management of health. These days, many
more opportunities are opening for the development, implementation,
and acquisition of versatile properties of nanomaterials in the fabrication
of biosensors. The use of advanced 2D transitional materials and organic
polymers has attained better sensitivity, selectivity, and stability in biosen￾sors. The biocompatible nature, enhanced conductivity, and good sensing
response of the nanomaterials and their composites made it easier
to develop biosensing devices. Using nanomaterial composites leads to
fabricating the sensing devices with less detection limit. These types of

7.1 Introduction
Electrochemical sensors create an electrical signal that is proportional to
the concentration of the analyte. A sensing electrode (also known as the
working electrode) and a reference electrode are typically found inside an
electrochemical sensor. Electrochemical biosensors’ relative simplicity is
among their main advantages. Simple circuits and cheap electrodes could
be combined to quickly perform tests in portable systems that are easy to
use and are miniature systems. For diagnosing diseases, condition monitor￾ing, and environmental monitoring (Bakker & Telting-Diaz, 2002), trying
to decide the analyte within a complicated specimen at the juncture and
close to living time is very appealing (Zhu et al., 2008).
For minimal, easily-to-use, tiny gadgets for a variety of applications,
including pollution management and clinical issue, biosensors hold out a
lot of potential (Guth et al., 2009). As a result of their extensive use in
diabetes management, potentiometric instruments have taken the lead
among the many biosensing approaches. Due to the need for diabetic
patients to check their blood sugar levels many times per day, sugar bio￾sensing actually accounts for around 70% points of the biomarker indus￾try, making it an interesting market for businesses (Privett et al., 2008,
2010).
Due mostly to sugar tracking, electrochemical biosensors represent
some of the most popular biosensors on the market. Electrochemical bio￾sensors are perfect for point-of-care uses because they can be readily
reduced, were naturally cheap, and only necessitate basic electronics for
conditioning and readout. Amperometric biosensors, which frequently

by electroactive species. Some of the most promising electrochemical sen￾sors for systems with clearly defined charges, such as DNA, are based on
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Merkoçi, 2007). Due to the
exceptional characteristics of nanoparticles like carbon nanotubes and
graphite, electrical nanobiosensors with incredibly low detection limits are
currently being produced (Wang et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2009).
Since the introduction of nanoscale and nanostructure techniques, the
latter has expanded quickly, turning even a basic cellphone into a potent
and full electrochemical base for (bio)sensing activities (Kang et al., 2010).
7.2 Biosensors
The word “biosensor” is short for “biological sensor.” It is made up pri￾marily of a transducer and an identifying component such as genetic code,
antibodies, enzymes, or other physiological body (Maduraiveeran et al.,
2018). The basic idea of the biological sensor is to identify analytes using
a transduction system and recognition element, and it helps in identifica￾tion via multiple techniques such as visual, electrochemical, and mechani￾cal mechanisms. The biorecognition component communicates with the
substance under test (Hareesha et al., 2021; Manjunatha Charithra &
Manjunatha, 2020; Manjunatha, 2020a).
The initial biological sensor was developed more than a century ago—
a device that shows the presence of blood elements employing electro￾chemical processes—and is currently developing the need for an hour—a
lightweight, simple-to-operate rapid evaluation kit for biosensors detec￾tion. Our journey has truly traveled a long distance (Manjunatha et al.,
2020; Manjunatha, 2020b; Manjunatha & Hussain, 2022; Prinith et al.,
2021; Pushpanjali & Manjunatha, 2020; Pushpanjali, Manjunatha, &
Srinivas, 2020). As previously stated, biological sensors are versatile tools
that can be applied to any field of application, but this was not the case a
decade ago.
When choosing an enzyme receptor for a biosensor, selection is a sig￾nificant consideration to think about. A bioreceptor may identify a partic￾ular analyte component of an object that contains a variety of species as
well as foreign substances. It will only yield beneficial outcomes when the
target molecule interacts with the bioreceptor. In biological sensors have a
high rate of false-positive results and poor selectivity because biological
specimens are complicated and contain a variety of components.
120 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications7.2.1 Types of biosensors
While this involves identification, biological sensors protect a wide range
of uses. Beginning with blood sugar identification, biological sensors have
advanced significantly, creating new avenues for researchers to capitalize
on their many benefits. Biosensors have been a boon to avoid major harm
through their effective detection capacity, if in medical care, water quality
monitoring, or agriculture (Arlett et al., 2011; Raril & Manjunatha, 2020;
Raril, Manjunatha, Ravishankar, et al., 2020). In the market, many types
of biosensors are available, and usage is highly required for daily life as
listed given below (Bahadır & Sezgintürk, 2015).
• Electrochemical biosensor (Abe et al., 2014).
• Nanoparticles-based electrochemical biosensor (Graditi et al., 2016).
• Graphene-based electrochemical biosensor (Grabowska et al., 2014).
• Aptamer-based electrochemical biosensor (Citartan et al., 2013).
• Dendrimer-based electrochemical biosensor (Clark & Clark, 1973).
• Carbon-nanotube-based electrochemical biosensors (Guo, 2013).
• Graphene-based electrochemical biosensors (Kunzelmann et al., 2014).
• Hydrogel-based electrochemical biosensors (Harris et al., 2013).
7.3 Recent trends in biosensors
From recent studies, oxidoreductase-related applications have traditionally
used dendrimer-based electrochemical biosensors most. This is perhaps
because dendrimers naturally have the ability to have a more advantageous
orientation, superior biocompatibility, and a high density of active sites
for the immobilization of enzymes. Additionally, it can be seen that the
hybrids created by combining dendrimers with metallic nanoparticles,
redox probes, and carbon materials have a range of uses in electrochemical
biosensors (Lee et al., 2017).
Biosensors are expected to have used in food evaluation, protection of
the environment, medical identification, pharmaceutical, and growing
crops sectors, among others, due to their accuracy, flexibility, straightfor￾wardness, high level of sensitivity, ability to perform a real-time and on￾site examination, speed, and inexpensive cost (Li et al., 2011).
Furthermore, biosensors provide exciting possibilities for a wide range of
decentralized clinical applications, including emergency room screening,
home self-testing, and alternative site testing, as well as continuous and
real-time in vivo monitoring. A new generation of biosensors is emerging,
Current electrochemical biosensors in market, trends, and future reliability: a case study 121bringing together new biological receptors with an ever-increasing num￾ber of transducers (Lu et al., 2008).
Biofabrication of mechanical components improves the performance
of mass-based biosensors. In fact, both electrical and optical biosensors use
this type of technology to create better biosensors. Major advancements
in micro- and nanofabrication technologies allow for the creation of
mechanical gadgets with tiny components that move (Erden & Kılıç,
2013; Fracchiolla et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2008). The capacity to create
these types of structures using semiconductor manufacturing processes
connected biological physics and biological engineering principles, allow￾ing for the development of practical micro- and nano-electromechanical
biosensors that can be mass-produced. Plenty of obstacles stay in weight￾based detectors because of capturing agents for manufacturing at the
nanoscale by using microelectronic production for high quantities evalua￾tion. In this regard, it is important to highlight the enormous usage possi￾bilities of semiconductor components and quantum dot technology.
However, no biosensor technology can perform simultaneous, real-time
quantitative assays on large arrays, but the fabrication of micro- and nano￾scale cantilevers may make it possible (Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020; Tigari
& Manjunatha, 2020).
7.4 Future reliability
We are certain that nanomaterials, downsizing, and the construction of
multimodal arrays for evaluation in biomedical activities are the driving
forces behind the advancement of electrochemical biosensors. Although
the research listed above can explore the use of electrochemical biosen￾sors, there are still few research articles that have used these approaches in
miniature systems. A number of different approaches involving several
domains, from chemical analysis and semiconductors to molecular genet￾ics, are apparently required to enhance the application of tiny electro￾chemical biosensors. It is also crucial to emphasize that there are still
difficulties in examining new protocols and approaches for these applica￾tions. More substrates and electrochemical methods should be used in
these systems, and this will enable the development of electrochemical
biosensors for use in devices (Kumar & Rani, 2013).
The advancement of biosensing for usage in technologies would be
made possible by the use of additional materials or electrochemical techni￾ques in such systems. Electrochemical sensors have garnered a lot of
122 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsattention in recent years as among the most key techniques, with consid￾erable potential for use in a variety of fields, including healthcare and
environmental monitoring (Khimji et al., 2013).
Quick patient monitoring techniques have become a key problem in
the modern era, and as we have seen in this chapter, biosensors play a sig￾nificant part in their development by offering high specificity, mobility,
and quick analysis. To improve the use of nanoscale electrochemical bio￾sensors, a variety of strategies involving multiple fields, such as chemical
analysis (Liu et al., 2014), semiconductor, and cell biology, appear to be
necessary. It is also essential to emphasize that testing new protocols and
methods for all these applications often presents challenges.
Graphene and nanoparticles, which seem to be popular types used in
electrochemical sensors and biosensors, are relevant in this situation for
use in care assessment, particularly when combined with biological mole￾cules and other equipment that have complementary properties to
increase sensitivity, specificity, and stability. Therefore, in addition to the
detection approach used, which must have been accepted for evaluation,
one of the essential factors that determine the effectiveness of biosensing
instruments seems to be the combination of material with biomolecules
for a given application (Su et al., 2016).
An electrochemical sensor that is being tested with developments with
high-throughput techniques focusing on identification limit, evaluation
time, and accessibility enabled massive consumer demand for cheap sugar
and pregnancies using known to inhibit human chorionic gonadotropin
immobilization removal with oblique flow technological advances (Lai &
Haile, 2005).
Optic-based biological sensors are the next major biological sensing
technological advances including fiber-optic chemistry. Because of its high
capacity for load and hydrophobic nature, nanogel-based linkage is ideal
for just one molecule recognition, such as DNA or peptide. Recent
advances in molecular optoelectronics have even enabled the develop￾ment of optical biometric recognition systems (Bailera et al., 2017).
Contemporary approaches to biosensor discovery include combined
approaches that use various methods such as electrochemical, electrome￾chanical, and fluorescence-cum-optical-based biosensors, as well as geneti￾cally engineered microbes. As the demand and need for using biosensors
for rapid analysis at a low-cost increase, biofabrication will pave the way
for identifying cellular to whole animal activity with a detection limit of
high accuracy for single molecules. The biosensors should then be
Current electrochemical biosensors in market, trends, and future reliability: a case study 123designed to operate under multiplex conditions. In that case, both 2D and
3D detection with sophisticated transducers is required for targeting and
calculating smaller analytes of fascination.
7.5 Conclusion
Biosensors have demonstrated their effectiveness, performance, and excep￾tional recognition for different substances in biomedical, agricultural, food
safety, and water surveillance applications. Glucometer, as the first-ever
biosensor, offers a wealth of concepts regarding future scientific research
and the use of biosensors in our daily lives. Wearable technology may
identify the existence of small bacteria and diagnose the individual’s medi￾cal limitations. Additionally, the development of artificial biological sci￾ence that uses bacteria as sensors will be crucial for detecting the
environment and meeting energy demand. The writers of the paper
emphasized the significance of using bacterial fuel cells in the develop￾ment of a water treatment technique and sources of energy for sensors
that monitor the environment. In general, we emphasized the type of
biosensors, which has possible uses and features such as identifying analyte
capacity, evaluation time, mobility, expenses, and modification.

8.1 Introduction
The introduction of biosensors into the literature is not far from today but
coincides with the middle of the 19th century (Heineman et al., 2006).
Leland L. Clark and Lyons developed an oxygen electrode in 1950, and the
first amperometric enzyme sensor was developed for glucose determination
in 1962, thus introducing the term biosensor to the scientific world (Clark &
Lyons, 1962; Heineman et al., 2006). In 1975, such biosensors were intro￾duced to the market as “Model 23 A YSI analyzer” (Yoo & Lee, 2010). A
biosensor is a self-contained integrated device that can provide quantitative or
semiquantitative analytical information, directly using a biochemical receptor
(Lee, 2005). It is most simply defined as an analytical device capable of con￾verting a biological response into a signal (Bollella & Katz, 2020). From the
time of its discovery to the present, endless biosensors have been developed
in the fields of biology, chemistry, and materials science. Moreover, due to
the biosensors’ extraordinary specific and selective properties, they can be
used in medicine, agriculture, and pharmacy. Studies have gained momentum
in the last two decades due to the great advantages of biosensors, such as low
detection limits, short analysis times, low cost, no preprocessing, portability,
and miniaturization potential. Especially nanomaterials such as metals, con￾ductive polymers, biopolymers, composites, molecularly imprinted polymers
(MIPs), antibodyaptamer, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carbonaceous
materials and metalorganic framework (MOF) contributed significantly to
the development of biosensors.
Indeed, scientists are looking for new analytical methods that are on-site,
online, and portable that can get quick answers. There is a need for a

All rights reserved.sensitive and selective analyzer set that will provide very fast results, especially
in the detection of defense and health problems. Not only these problems
but also the analysis of these samples is extremely important, as food analyses
and environmental analyses directly or indirectly affect human health.
Contrary to traditional methods, electrochemical biosensors have been and
are an inspiration to the scientific world in this sense. Moreover, all factors
such as widespread use of electrochemical methods, increase in sensor diver￾sity, and development of new and unique materials enable the production of
biosensors with extremely excellent properties. It is understood from the great
acceleration in the sensor studies conducted in the last 5 years that these
developments do not mean that new sensors will not be produced.
Moreover, specific, selective, and sensitive electrochemical sensors for analyte
determinations are increasing day by day. In particular, the discovery of new
materials means new horizons in the world of sensors for the analysis of all
analytes defined as substances. The development of biosensors, their analysis
in samples such as medicine, food, and the environment, and the develop￾ment of portable, body-integrating sensors are not considered impossible.
The weak points of biosensors such as stability and shelf life are being
improved day by day. For this, hybrid materials are built from different mate￾rials. Moreover, scientific studies are continuing at full speed for biosensors to
take place in our daily lives. The main reason here is that the events on the
sensor surface are not fully and clearly understood. It is the full elucidation of
electrochemical processes with new, superconducting, and catalytic materials
produced in parallel with the developing technology today. Biosensor
manufacturing baselines are well established, and material development and
analytical method improvement are intensively researched by scientists.
8.2 Design and principle of biosensors
The world of biosensors has not been too far from the present but has
become important in the last two decades. The main reason here is that
the events on the sensor surface are not fully and clearly understood. It is
the full elucidation of electrochemical processes on the surface of biosen￾sors with new, superconducting, and catalytic materials produced in paral￾lel with the developing technology today. Biosensor manufacturing
baselines are well established, and material development and analytical
method improvement are intensively researched by scientists.
A typical biosensor includes (a) an analyte, (b) a bioreceptor, (c) a
transducer, (d) electronics, and (e) a display (Fig. 8.1) (Bhalla et al., 2016),
130 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationswhere analyte: the relevant substance to be determined in the samples
(e.g., the amount of glucose in the blood or the determination of lactose
in milk); bioreceptor: a biological element and substance that can sense or
recognize an analyte, for example, enzymes, aptamers, and antibodies.
Biorecognition expresses chemical changes such as light, heat, pH, charge,
or mass during the interaction between the bioreceptor and the analyte.
Converter is the part of the biosensor that converts energy from one form
to another. This process transforms the change of a chemical or biological
target as a result of bioreceptor interaction into a measurable signal (elec￾trical). They are classified as electrochemical, optical, electronic, thermal,
and gravimetric converters according to their working principle.
Electronics: The converted signal is processed to prepare the image. The
electrical signals obtained from the converter are amplified and converted
into digital images. Imaging: The imaging unit consists of a computer or
printer-connected system that produces output so that the corresponding
response can be interpreted. The output can be in the form of numerical
data, graphical, or table containing data.
A biosensor is a system that detects physical or chemical changes that
occur between the analyte and the bioreceptor as a result of
Figure 8.1 Basic components of biosensors.
An overview of stability and lifetime of electrochemical biosensors 131biorecognition procedures. It is possible to classify biosensors according to
the bioreceptor layer in the biorecognition process. According to this clas￾sification, the enzyme is divided into cell-based, affinity biomolecule￾based, aptamers, and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) biosensors.
Biosensors are classified according to the bioreceptor layer [Najeeb
MA, Ahmad Z, Shakoor RA, Mohamed AMA, Kahraman R. A novel
classification of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biosensors based on trans￾ducing elements] (Najeeb et al., 2017; Phumlani et al., 2021). Transducers
are needed to make the changes between the analyte and the bioreceptor
measurable. Sometimes this change is in terms of current, and sometimes
it happens based on the mass. It is possible to separate different types of
biosensors depending on the transducer elements. Biosensors can be
grouped under the main heading of electrochemical, optical, electronic,
thermal, and gravimetric.
8.3 Electrochemical biosensors
In recent years, the development of electrochemical methods due to their
stability, superior selectivity, portability, and miniaturization has led to the
opening of new horizons for the scientific world. In this respect, due to
the unique properties of biosensors, the development and applications of
electrochemical biosensors have gained great importance, and studies have
increased rapidly in the last two decades.
The basic working principle of electrochemical biosensors is that the
electrical potential difference between the analyte and the bioreceptor is
proportional to the active concentration of the substance. Biomaterials
such as enzymes, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), antibo￾dyaptamer, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are used as receptors in
electrochemical biosensors (Gui et al., 2018). In addition, metal-modified
composite electrodes on carbonaceous material surfaces are preferred. In
this system, the current or potential difference from the system as a result
of the redox behavior of the analyte is used for the quantitative analysis of
the target analyte in the sample. Conductimetric-, amperometric-, vol￾tammetric-, potentiometric-, and impedimetric-based biosensors are used
for measurement depending on the analyte and bioreceptor process.
8.3.1 Interface of biosensor
Creating the interface to interact with the analyte is the most challenging
process in biosensor design. This interface structure, which will provide
132 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsextraordinary selectivity, must be unique to the target analyte even in a com￾plex matrix environment. In addition, the biomolecule located in the biore￾ceptor must be in an immobile structure on its surface. Highly active
biomolecules such as enzymes should be the interface layer between the
denatured bioreceptors and the surface of the electrodes (Song et al., 2021).
Sometimes a solid surface such as silicon is used as this interface, while some￾times a series of substrates such as glass, paper, and polymer are made of dif￾ferent materials. The interface, also called biocompatible surface, directly
affects the stability, shelf life, selectivity, and sensitivity of the biosensor.
Therefore one of the most important steps in biosensor development is to
build a high-stability interface. In addition, the coupling enthalpies, entropies,
and thermodynamics of the interface can be said as other parameters that
affect the stability of the biosensor (Visalakshan et al., 2019).
8.3.2 Materials of biosensor interfaces
Due to both the application area and sensitivity of biosensors, they have
been successfully used in qualitative and quantitative analyses of numerous
pesticides, drugs, and organic substances with superior selectivity. The
most basic factor here is that it is formed from different materials seen in
the bioreceptor. It is possible to classify these materials as metallic nano￾materials, carbon-based nanomaterials, polymer, and metalorganic
frameworks.
8.3.2.1 Metal-based nanomaterials
In recent years, advances in nanomaterials due to technology have made a
positive contribution to the production of biosensors (Song et al., 2021).
These nanomaterials, which have particularly large surface areas and cata￾lytic properties, contribute positively to the development of the biorecep￾tor. Moreover, by increasing the stability of the biosensor, sensors with
longer life and high repeatability have been developed. In particular,
nanomaterials are ideal immobilization materials in bioreceptors due to
their excellent conductivity, large surface area, outstanding catalytic activ￾ity, and excellent biocompatibility. The metal-based interface used in the
production of biosensors varies widely. These nanomaterials are nanoparti￾cles such as Au and ZnO, Fe3O4, MnO2 and TiO2, MoS2 semiconductor,
bimetallic nanocrystals Ni/ZrO2, microporous structure, and microrod
structures. In addition, noble metal- and alloy-based nanomaterials are
widely used in biosensor production due to their catalytic and biocompat￾ible properties.
An overview of stability and lifetime of electrochemical biosensors 1338.3.2.2 Carbon-based nanomaterials
Carbonaceous materials come to the fore in the use of electrochemical
sensors due to their large surface area and unique properties such as excel￾lent conductivity, stability, and durability (Inagaki & Kang, 2016).
Nanostructures such as single- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes, nano￾porous carbons, graphene-based nanomaterials, and carbon nanofibers are
important materials as bioreceptors. They are the most applied materials
due to their large surface areas, stability, stability between biomolecules
and the surface, unmatched conductivity, and catalytic effects. It also has
superior properties such as film-forming ability, modification with nano￾materials, and biocompatibility. Treatment with nanoparticles, polymers,
and heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus improves the
electrocatalytic activity, stability, and resistivity of carbonaceous materials.
Considering all these features, it can be said that carbon sensors are the
most important material in the production of biosensors.
8.3.2.3 Polymer
Polymers are extremely sensitive materials used in making bioreceptors in
biosensors. It is frequently preferred as an interface, especially because it is
easy to process and its chemical and physical properties can be adjusted as
necessary. It develops polymers specific to the analyte target and has
gained an important position in the production of biosensors. The poly￾mers used in the construction of bioreceptors can be divided into conduc￾tive polymers and nonconductive polymers. Conducting polymers are
coated on the electrode surface, increasing the sensitivity of the sensors
which use to detect numerous analytes in real samples. Nonconductive
polymers, on the other hand, are preferred to immobilize certain receptors
in the sensor device. Until now, a large number of polymer-based biosen￾sors have been produced for the determination of various target sub￾stances. Various polymers such as chitosan, polyethylene glycol, agarose,
and hydrogel have been widely used in these sensors.
8.3.2.4 Metalorganic framework
In the last decade, the new and porous metalorganic framework (MOF)
is an interesting hybrid material in the production of electrochemical sen￾sors. Metal ions and organic ligands are formed, which are bound together
by strong coordination bonds. Unlike inorganic nanomaterials, MOFs are
biocompatible compounds with a natural degradability process. Therefore
MOF-type sensors have been applied for the determination of several
134 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsbiological agents such as DNA, RNA, and enzymes. MOFs with porosity
show both outstanding catalytic activity and excellent affinity as biorecep￾tor. MOF constitutes an important class in electrochemical biosensors due
to its advantages such as unique lattice structure, large surface area, and
different metal central atoms.
8.4 Reproducibility and lifetime
The repeatability of electrochemical biosensors is a measurement of scat￾tering and drift in observations and findings, such as the repeatability of
analytical equipment. When assessing sensitivity under storage or opera￾tional circumstances, biosensor stability may also be calculated as a devia￾tion. Drift detection is particularly important for biosensors that have been
studied over a relatively short period and are slow to evolve.
Repeatability is determined for analyte concentration within a usable
range. For example, in studies on some biosensors, it has been reported
that the biosensors can be used for more than 1 year in laboratory condi￾tions, but their practical life is either unknown or may be limited to days
or weeks when incorporated into biological tissue, like industrial processes
or in vivo implanted glucose biosensors (Turner, 1993). The procedures
for evaluating biosensors’ behavior for several days after entering industrial
reactors are much more involved and challenging to handle, even though
it is relatively simple to determine the laboratory stability of biosensors
while they are operating, both in storage and in the presence of the ana￾lyte (Thévenot et al., 2001). Storage state, like dry or wet, atmospheric
composition, such as air or nitrogen, pH, buffer composition, and the
presence of additives are crucial factors in determining storage stability.
The operational stability of a biosensor response can vary significantly
depending on sensor geometry, preparation method, and applied receptor
and transducer.
Additionally, the limiting factor, such as a substrate’s internal or exterior
diffusion or biorecognition reaction, has a significant impact on the response
rate. Finally, depending on the operating environment, it might vary
greatly. We advise taking into account the analyte concentration, continu￾ous or sequential interaction of the biosensor with the analyte solution,
temperature, pH, buffer composition, presence of organic solvents, and
sample matrix composition when determining operational stability
(Section 3.3). In bench or industrial, whether the useful life is storage (shelf)
or working (use) life is determined by storage, operating conditions, and
An overview of stability and lifetime of electrochemical biosensors 135substrate concentrations. Biosensor rate-limiting step or factor information is
particularly important for understanding its stability characteristics. The life￾time evaluation mode, i.e., initial precision and calibration curve, should be
specified relative to the upper limit of the linear concentration range for
accuracy or repeatability. For accuracy in the linear concentration range,
the definition of life in tL is recommended as the required storage or oper￾ating time for a 10% (tL10) or 50% (tL50) reduction. To determine the
storage life, the sensitivities of different biosensors derived from the same
production batch with different storage times under the same conditions
should also be compared (Thévenot et al., 2001).
Both shelf stability and operational stability are significant factors; how￾ever, shelf stability is more critical in some circumstances than operational
stability, such as when producing disposable biosensors for glucose (Hill
et al., 1997). In some circumstances, both types of stability may be
required, particularly with multipurpose carbon paste biosensors. The
majority of the paste, however, is not in direct contact with the analyte
solution, necessitating shelf stability. However, if the instrument is to be
used repeatedly, the tip, where the measurement takes place, needs to be
operationally stable.
8.4.1 Definition of stability
The degree to which sensor qualities hold true over time is referred to as
stability. Aging of components, a decline in sensitivity of components,
and changes in signal-to-noise ratio can all lead to changes in stability,
also known as drift (Gibson, 1999). Therefore it is crucial to establish the
various categories of stability right away. When enzymes are immobilized
in solution, as a dehydrated powder (e.g., lyophilized), or on a substrate
such as the surface of a biosensor, they can be stabilized to increase shelf
life or operational stability.
8.4.2 Shelf stability
When an enzyme, protein, diagnostics, or gadget is maintained under cer￾tain circumstances after creation, its shelf stability may be described as an
increase or improvement in the activity retention of the product. The
commercialization of unstable materials that deteriorate over time depends
on this characteristic. In the food business, where products are stamped
with expiration dates on the packaging, shelf stability is demonstrated fre￾quently. Pharmaceuticals use a similar technique, and producers of
136 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsenzymes frequently include an expiration date on their protein goods.
One of the key determinants of a biosensor device’s commercial success is
frequently the stability of the labile biomaterial used in it.
8.4.3 Operational stability
One of the most important aspects of the functioning of a biosensor is
operational stability. Operational stability is the capacity of a protein or
enzyme to maintain its activity while being used. This factor, which has
to do with a device’s usability and operating longevity, is the most fre￾quently referenced one in biosensor literature. When analyte monitoring
is frequently necessary or reusable sensors are used in the measurement
process by an analytical instrument, the lifespan of a sensor can sometimes
be important.
The signal at a certain concentration of the measured analyte degrades
as a result of biosensor aging. Temperature, processing or usage, and time
all affect how something ages. According to the Arrhenius theory, increas￾ing the latter speeds up aging (McAteer et al., 1999). These experiments
are adequate for disposable sensors and do not provide anything about
aging characteristics for long-term usage. Because there are many different
types, labeling, and manufacturing procedures for biosensors, the data
reported here may not be applicable to all biosensors. However, different
enzyme biosensors and biosensing approaches can be used with the sug￾gested methodology, processes, and models to assess sensor deterioration
utilizing high temperatures accelerating aging (Panjan et al., 2017)
(Fig. 8.1).
Various biosensor-based wearable devices are being developed that
require high operational stability of biosensors. The development of wear￾able sensors has led to significant growth and change across a wide range
of sectors, including healthcare, informatics, communications, and biologi￾cal sciences. This revolution is primarily being driven by the newly dis￾covered capability to continually observe and evaluate patients’ physiology
in their natural surroundings. Most of the technologies available on the
market are focused on electrophysiological, electromechanical, or acoustic
measurements. Traditional challenges in biochemical sensing, such as reli￾ability, repeatability, stability, and slippage, have an important place in
wearable sensing systems due to variations in the operating environment,
sample/sensor usage, and motion artifacts (Sonawane et al., 2017)
(Figs. 8.2 and 8.3).

138 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsAs mentioned, in any application, stabilization is a very important part
to consider. The primary obstacle to creating functional biosensors is the
stabilization of enzymes and other proteins. All items, however, need to
be stable on the shelf and in use. The majority of the biological reactions
generated by sensors require at least 1 2 years of shelf stability in storage,
although operational stability depends on the kind of biosensor used.
Operational stability can last anywhere from a few seconds to several
months (Thévenot et al., 2001). The practical lifetime of the biosensor is
either unknown or limited to days or weeks when incorporated into
industrial processes, a biological sample, or implanted in vivo ( Tierney
et al., 2000). To create a more effective biosensor, the transducers must
be in the precise state where they produce the required acute biological
responses. During the manufacturing process, the enzyme manufacturer
must also take solution stability into account.
Most wearable biosensing applications use enzymatic biosensors as they
offer pure catalytic activity when in contact with the analyte ( Grieshaber
et al., 2008). The analyte and the bioreceptors interact to produce a bio￾logical reaction, which the transducer subsequently transforms into an
electrical signal. In this interaction, the enzyme must be in a state to pro￾duce acute biological responses ( Chaubey & Malhotra, 2002). The sensor’s
response can be strongly impacted by the biofluids ’ pH and ionic
strength/viscosity variations. Recently, it was suggested to decrease the
size of electrochemical sensors and boost the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
in order to counteract this impact. The concept suggests that the signal
can be increased by using numerous enzyme tags. Additionally, compared
to other biorecognition components like antibodies, nucleic acids, cells,
and microbes, enzymatic biosensors have more precise binding capacities
and biocatalytic activity. Enzymatic biosensors are more effective than
cell-based ones due to their specificity because an enzyme ’s diffusion paths
are shorter because there are no cell wall barriers, producing quicker
responses ( Panesar et al., 2010 ). Enzymes are extremely sensitive to their
surroundings, making it crucial for them to be stable so they can avoid
erroneous signals. To increase the biosensor ’s overall shelf life and opera￾tional stability, enzymes can be stabilized.
It has been reported that using a single immobilized enzyme (glucose
oxidase) system for glucose and a multienzyme system (invertase, mutaro￾tase, and glucose oxidase system, including lysozyme for sucrose) during
the immobilization process considerably increases the operational stability
of a biosensor. The immobilized single- and multienzyme system ’s
An overview of stability and lifetime of electrochemical biosensors139improved operational stability also improves the biosensor ’s operational
cost-effectiveness ( Gouda et al., 2002).
Many different materials have been used in many studies to improve
biosensors’ stability. A study conducted in 2021 focused on the fact that
graphene-like titanium carbide (Ti 3C2) nanolayers have a strong propen￾sity for interlayer aggregation ( Zhu et al., 2021), which can significantly
impair their electrochemical characteristics. In particular, it has been dem￾onstrated that adding carbon nanotubes to Ti3C2 is an efficient technique
to enhance electrochemical performance and boost electrical conductivity
while also stabilizing the layer-to-layer structure ( Zheng et al., 2018).
In a study that created a highly sensitive dopamine electrochemical
sensor based on the two-dimensional transition metal carbide Ti 3C2,
Ti3C2/nitride (MXene) was obtained by engraving the Al layer from
Ti3AlC2 MX and improved stability and electrochemical properties. It
evolved with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (G-MWCNTs), and the
inclusion of zinc oxide (ZnO) further improved the electrochemical and
catalytic properties of Ti 3C2/G-MWCNT composites. Ti3C2/G￾MWCNTs/ZnO/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) are formed by the syner￾gistic effect of the three materials; compared to several dopamine electro￾chemical sensors that have been previously described, the sensor ’s
sensitivity and detection performance are much superior ( Ni et al., 2022).
The carbon nanotube (CNT) solgel biocomposite glucose oxidase sen￾sor for precise determination of glucose showed remarkable performance
with good reproducibility, remarkable stability, and fast response.
Compared to biosensors created with many modified composite-based
materials, the amount of enzymes and CNTs required for the electrode is
less (Lawal, 2016).
The CNTs are one of the important materials in electrochemical sen￾sor technologies due to their chemical, physical, and electrical properties,
that is, high surface-to-volume ratio, advanced electron transfer properties,
and high thermal conductivity. The integration of CNTs with materials
containing a functional group provides an ideal and robust support mate￾rial for the immobilization of enzymes and has made CNTs to attract con￾siderable attention in biosensing and electroanalysis ( Lawal, 2016; Scheibel
& Schrlau, 2017). An overview of stability and performance of CNT￾based glucose biosensors formed by the synergistic effect of different mate￾rials is given inTable 8.1. The stability, linearity range, sensitivity, and
detection performance of the composite electrodes formed by the integra￾tion of CNT with many materials containing functional groups show

(2020)differences. GC/CNT/HRP-GOx/Nafion composite electrode has the
lowest detection limit of 0.5 μM, and its stability was determined as 97%
after 1 week. CoPcMWNTs/GC composite electrode shows approxi￾mately 93% stability after 90 days, while PtNWCNTCHIT has 85%
stability (Table 8.1). The linear range, detection performance, and stability
of the composite electrodes differ depending on the choice of materials
used to form composites with CNT. These results emphasize the impor￾tance of choosing the composite material to be used in electrode design
with suitable and ideal performance (Table 8.2).
An important goal of analytical chemistry is to create fast, easy, and
small analytical systems for the detection of potent toxic nerve agents.
The studies present the results of developing a high shelf life and func￾tionally stable cholinesterase biosensor for nerve gas detection (Arduini &
Palleschi, 2012). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) recovered from electric eels
in various forms and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) derived from horse
serum were immobilized on screen-printed electrodes chemically modi￾fied with electrochemical medium Prussian blue (PB) to evaluate various
types of immobilization (PB-SPEs). In order to measure the quantity of
the enzymatic product thiocholine, PB-SPEs exploited the enzymatic
activity of immobilized enzymes at 1200 mV in amperometric mode
against the substrates acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine. The glu￾taraldehyde, bovine serum albumin, and Nafion-immobilized BChE bio￾sensor demonstrated a shelf life of more than 6 months and operational
stability of up to 10 hours under dry circumstances at room temperature
(Arduini & Palleschi, 2012).
In another study, they reported using a new porous activated carbon
(Vamvakaki & Chaniotakis, 1996) to immobilize polyelectrolyte-stabilized
enzymes for the construction of biosensors with high operational and stor￾age lifetimes. This is done by physically adsorbing the combination of
enzyme and polyelectrolyte into the electrode pores without the need for
chemical coupling agents, which prevents unneeded denaturation. The
acquired stability of glucose and hydrogen peroxidase biosensors is shown
using the polyelectrolyte diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) as
an enzyme-stabilizing polyelectrolyte. The use of positively charged poly￾electrolytes in conjunction with porous activated carbon has great promise
for the development of diverse biosensors with long operating stability,
high repeatability, and quick reaction times (Gavalas et al., 1998).
The good operational stabilities can be attributed to the fact that there
are strong interactions between polyphenol oxidases and tissues, which

stability and performance to biosensors (Sarioglu et al., 2009). Another
recent study demonstrated the use of very stable single-molecule enzyme
nanocapsules (SMENs) as a biorecognition component in enzyme-based
biosensors in place of the conventional natural enzyme. This study’s pri￾mary goal is to address the biggest obstacle and problems in the field of
biosensors, such as thermal stability, organic solvent tolerance, long-term
operational stability, etc., in order to overcome the inadequate stability of
enzyme-based biosensors. Additionally, it describes research using nGOx
SMENs as extremely reliable nano(bio)sensors for point-of-care diagnostic
uses. The development and use of biosensors in point-of-care diagnostics,
biomedical sensing, wearable technology, implantable equipment, and
biofuel cells may be aided by the proposed SMEN-based nano(bio)sen￾sors, which have strong stability in the changeable operating environment
(Dhanjai et al., 2020).
Alkane thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) continue to see wide￾spread use in electrochemical biosensors. But their usefulness reflects a poten￾tially important compromise. Although effective electron transport is favored
by shorter SAMs, they are poorly packed and relatively unstable. Although
longer SAMs are more stable, their electron transfer efficiency suffers, which
impairs sensor performance. In their study, Phares et al. compared the signal￾ing and stability of biosensors made with a short, six-carbon monothiol with
those made using one of two commercially available trihexylthiol anchors
using the electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensor platform. They claim that
despite the gain, specificity, and selectivity of all three anchors are practically
identical, they all successfully enhance effective electron transfer and E-DNA
signaling. The three anchors’ stabilities, however, differ greatly from one
another. The flexible trithiol-fixed sensors exhibit enhanced stability, preserv￾ing 75% of their original signal and maintaining excellent signal properties
after 50 days of storage in the buffer. Likewise, these sensors exhibit excellent
temperature stability and robustness against electrochemical interrogation.
The stability of sensors made using rigid trithiol fixation is comparable to that
of monothiol, although both exhibit significant ( . 60%) signal loss upon wet
storage or thermal cycling. When making SAM-based electrochemical bio￾sensors, it may be possible to use a flexible trithiol anchor to increase sensor
robustness without reducing electron transfer efficiency and adversely affect￾ing sensor performance (Phares et al., 2009).
The maximum repeatability, consistency, and stability in contemporary
biosensors are now shown by label-free affinity electrochemical biosensors￾An overview of stability and lifetime of electrochemical biosensors 149built electrodes made using semiconductor manufacturing technology (SMT)
and a streptavidin biomediator. The point-of-care (POC) requirements are
still not met by such biosensors in terms of these three factors, though. The
goal of this study was to find a solution to the repeatability and accuracy
restrictions brought on by issues with biosensor manufacturing in order to
create a platform that can create products that go above and beyond POC
requirements. A biosensor with remarkable repeatability, impressive precision,
and great stability was created utilizing optimized SMT manufacturing para￾meters and an innovative, beyond-example binder. This shows that biosen￾sors may be validated for POC development (Chen et al., 2020).
One of the most crucial elements in the development of electrochemi￾cal immunosensors is the great stability of the redox signal. Redox-active
species, on the other hand, typically exhibit low stability and weak con￾ductivity, which prevents their use in electrochemical immunosensors.
The conductive polymer poly(indole-5-carboxylic acid) (PIn-5-COOH)
possesses ultrahigh redox stability, according to a study on stability. In
contrast to earlier reports, where the redox signals only remained above
90% after 50 cyclic voltammetric cycles (CV), the redox signal of PIn-5-
COOH may remain 96.03% after 500 CV cycles in pH 6.2 buffer solu￾tion. The ultrahigh redox stability of PIn-5-COOH should be due to its
stable nature, according to mechanism studies. For the detection of alpha￾fetoprotein, electrochemical immunosensors made with the PIN-5-
COOH/MWCNTs-COOH nanocomposite demonstrated a broad linear
range from 0.001 to 100 ng mL21 and a low detection limit of
0.33 pg mL 2 1
. The development of electrochemical immunosensors
with incredibly stable redox signals is now possible because of this study
(Yang et al., 2019). The PIn-5-COOH/MWCNTs-COOH nanocompo￾site demonstrated good selectivity, wide linear range, low detection limit,
ultra-stable redox signal, long-term stability, and reproducibility in elec￾trochemical immunosensors (Yang et al., 2019).
Due to their high potential for preserving the stability of the biosensor,
enzyme immobilization, physical adsorption, capture technique, covalent
bond method, chemical crosslinking method, electrochemical polymeriza￾tion, and capture method are all of considerable interest (Lee et al., 2020).
The polymers used to maintain the enzyme’s activity can provide a bio￾compatible microenvironment that helps increase the stability of biosen￾sors. More importantly, it is possible to further increase the efficiency of
developed biosensors by trapping negatively charged enzymes in positively
charged polymers. This is due to the unique interaction between
150 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationspositively charged polymers and negatively charged enzymes, resulting in
stronger binding to increase stability (Lee et al., 2020) (Fig. 8.4).
In a recent study, polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) were used to develop
and create an AChE@PILs@AuNPs composite with a coreshell struc￾ture. PILs served as both enzyme immobilizers and modifiers in this build,
resulting in the first amperometric AChE electrochemical biosensors. PILs
served as the intermediate layer, while fused AuNPs served as the outside
layer. AChE was kept in PILs to serve as the inner core. The developed
electrochemical detection platform AChE@PILs@AuNPs/GCE has
shown remarkable sensitivity for the detection of carbaryl and dichlorvos
due to the charge property of PILs and the electron transport channel of
AuNPs (DDVP). AChE@PILs@AuNPs/GCE further showed good sta￾bility, including thermal and long-term stability (Wan et al., 2022)
(Fig. 8.5A).
A delicate, reproducible, interference-free, inexpensive “off-the-shelf”
H2O2 detection device was created by combining a financial carbon ink
of an SPE with a sample of glassy carbon particles modified with Prussian
blue (PB). Studies on these probes’ storage stability have also demon￾strated that the PB modification process can offer long-term stability for
PB activity and probe robustness. It has already been shown how to create
PB, bulk-modified screen-printed electrodes utilizing activated PB micro￾particles (,38 μm) combined with carbon ink in a recent paper
(O’Halloran et al., 2001). Results show a significant increase in stability
over this study’s findings when compared to SPEs, which exhibited a 50%
decline in H2O2 signal after 4 hours (Fig. 8.5B). Due to their promising

An overview of stability and lifetime of electrochemical biosensors 151qualities, the sensors were later employed as supports for the immobiliza￾tion of enzymes like glucose and lysine oxidase, producing a lysine and
glucose biosensor. Furthermore, sensitivity, LOD, linearity range, storage
stability, and operating stability all exhibited remarkable results. Recovery
experiments on the probes’ usage to assess the amount of glucose in
drinking samples produced positive outcomes. The sensors are an easy-to￾use, affordable, and mass-producible probe for glucose detection due to
the lack of any enzyme immobilization or agent modification, following
the cheap cost and the printing process of the sensors. Additionally, the
excellent stability shown throughout a complete day qualifies these probes
for “in situ” continuous investigation. Additionally, the fact that no high
temperatures were present throughout the printing process is encouraging
for the use of different oxidase enzymes (Ricci et al., 2003; O’Halloran
et al., 2001).

152 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications8.5 Conclusion
Indeed, biosensors will be the most remarkable analysis kits of the near
future. The main reason for this can be shown as factors such as fast analysis
time, preprocessing required, high accuracy and sensitivity, outstanding selec￾tivity, portability, and on-site analysis. In addition to these factors, biosensors
have gained vital importance with the addition of extremely important fac￾tors such as stability and shelf life. Due to the incredible and unique proper￾ties they exhibit, the usage areas of biosensors are expanding day by day. It
has application in a wide spectrum of areas such as health, food, defense, and
engineering. The commercialization processes of biosensors, patents, and
articles are increasing with a huge trend. In this chapter, the stability and
shelf life of biosensors were discussed. The shortcomings and advantages of
biosensors were examined in detail. It was understood that the stability and
shelf life of biosensors were improved with advanced nanomaterials.
However, although this issue remained in the background of scientific stud￾ies, it was understood that scientists should concentrate on the stability and
shelf life of biosensors. It has been determined that these two factors are
effective in taking place more in our daily lives. It was understood that this
required the correct use of technology and the discovery of new materials.
As a result, in this chapter, it is understood that in addition to factors such as
the development of numerous biosensors and the determination of analytes,
the stability and shelf life of biosensors, which are a little weak, should be
further improved for them to be commercialized, included in routine analy￾ses and to be more involved in our daily life.

9.1 Introduction
Antioxidants play a valuable role in human health in the diet. Present in
various types of beverages such as wines, juices, teas, and coffee drinks,
the antioxidants can occur naturally or are intentionally added to delay or
inhibit the onset of oxidation reactions, keeping their sensory characteris￾tics unaltered (Karadag et al., 2009). Their daily consumption contributes
to numerous benefits to the human body: They boost immunity, reduce
the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease, provide defense against many
diseases, and combat cellular aging due to the action of excess free radicals.
In the broadest sense, an antioxidant molecule can be defined as a sub￾stance capable of preventing or delaying the action of free radicals and
other molecules that can induce oxidation in molecules with reactive
properties (Karadag et al., 2009; San Miguel-Chávez, 2017).
Free radicals are constantly produced by the human body. They are
products formed during the conversion of food nutrients into energy.
Although they are essential for health, in excess, free radicals begin to oxi￾dize healthy cells such as proteins and lipids (Zhong & Shahidi, 2015).
These species have a single electron, are free to bond with any other elec￾tron, and are therefore highly reactive.
Consumption of foods rich in antioxidants helps to delay, control, or prevent
oxidative processes caused by excess free radicals in the body that lead to the
development and propagation of degenerative diseases. In this context, recent
advances in medicine and nutritional science have emphasized lifestyle changes
and approaches based on diet and nutrition. As a result, the consumption of

human health has increased significantly.
The human antioxidant defense system consists of enzymatic (endoge￾nous) and nonenzymatic (exogenous) systems. The enzymatic system is
formed by a series of enzymes that the human body produces naturally.
However, the efficiency that stimulates the production of this system
decreases over the years. Therefore it is important to maintain the quality
of the nonenzymatic defense system by taking antioxidants, which include
a variety of substances of dietary origin, such as carotenoids, flavonoids,
other phenolic compounds, vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C (ascorbic acid),
vitamin E (tocopherol), and minerals (copper, selenium, and zinc)
(Gulcin, 2020; Kumar et al., 2017; San Miguel-Chávez, 2017).
Beverages such as wines, juices, teas, and brewed coffee drinks are
sources of antioxidants. These compounds not only have beneficial effects
on human health but can also influence the nutritional and physicochemi￾cal properties of each beverage. Therefore it is of paramount importance
to control the quality of beverages containing natural antioxidants.
Enzyme biosensors offer simple, fast (real-time analysis), and cost￾effective analytical approaches for this purpose. Moreover, biosensors
developed by coupling enzyme recognition with electrochemical transdu￾cers based on nanostructured materials play an important role in the
detection and determination of antioxidant compounds in beverages due
to their sensitivity, stability, and selectivity (Pohanka & Skládal, 2008;
Turner, 2013). Generally, the antioxidant compounds in beverages occur
at low concentrations, and the enzymatic biosensors can detect or deter￾mine them due to their high sensitivity. Furthermore, these analytical
devices have high selectivity and stability for more than 200 measurements
(Gomes et al., 2020; Salamanca-Neto et al., 2020). This useful lifetime
and reusability are due to the numerous efforts made in the search for
suitable microenvironments that help to maintain the biological activity of
the enzyme, either using nanostructured materials (Liu & Ju, 2003) or
polysaccharides (Coelho et al., 2019; Mattos et al., 2019). In industry,
electrochemical enzymatic biosensors are valuable for beverage quality
control because these devices are selective, sensitive, have a low cost of
construction and storage, and also offer the potential for miniaturization/
automation and rapid continuous monitoring (Freire et al., 2002; Rotariu
et al., 2016).
In this brief review, we present the electrochemical enzymatic biosen￾sors developed with nanostructured materials for the determination of a
162 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsspecific antioxidant or total antioxidant content in real beverage samples
(wines, juices, teas, blueberry syrup, and brewed coffee beverages) con￾taining these compounds. The data collection was conducted for the last
decade (201222) and considered scientific papers in which the applica￾tion was specifically in beverages, with carbon- and metal-based electrodes
made/modified from nanostructured materials, and that use the electro￾chemical reduction process to quantify or estimate antioxidant capacity. A
total of 19 scientific articles presenting these specifications were used in
this review.
9.2 Reference analytical methods employed for the
determination of antioxidants in beverages
Antioxidant capacity or total reducing power is defined as the ability of
certain molecules to act as electron donors or proton receptors in oxida￾tionreduction reactions. All antioxidants present in the sample represent
the antioxidant capacity, while the total phenolic content refers to the
phenolic compounds, which are a group of antioxidants (Karadag et al.,
2009; San Miguel-Chávez, 2017).
It is a fact that a variety of methods are available today for the evalua￾tion of antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content in beverages.
However, a single technique does not guarantee the determination of the
different types of antioxidant compounds present in a complex sample.
The most commonly used analytical methods for determining antioxidant
capacity in beverages are based on colorimetric methods monitored
by UV-vis spectrophotometry, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), which use
the 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid reagent (ABTS).
Total phenolic content (total phenols and polyphenols) is another impor￾tant parameter of total antioxidant capacity, and the FolinCiocalteu assay
is the well-known method for this purpose (Munteanu & Apetrei, 2021;
San Miguel-Chávez, 2017). These colorimetric methods, on the other
hand, are time-consuming, have low sensitivity, require a large number of
samples, and use reagents that are not environmentally friendly.
Determination of total antioxidant activity by DPPH is based on elec￾tron donation by the antioxidants to neutralize the DPPH radical, which
is accompanied by decolorization of the purple color measured at
515 nm. This method is based on the assumption that the antioxidant
activity is equal to the electron-donating capacity or so-called reducing
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 163power (Zhong & Shahidi, 2015). DPPH is a radical and an oxidizing
agent at the same time. Methanol must be used for this test because
DPPH is soluble only in this medium. In addition, several antioxidants
react very slowly or not at all with DPPH due to steric hindrances, and
there may be interference from other molecules that have absorption in
the same wavelength range as DPPH, such as the anthocyanins
(500550 nm), which may interfere with the results and make them diffi￾cult to interpret (San Miguel-Chávez, 2017; Zhong & Shahidi, 2015).
The ABTS assay measures the ability of antioxidants to scavenge the
highly stable chromophore cation radical ABTS, either by direct reduction
via electron donation or by radical quenching via hydrogen atom dona￾tion, and the balance of these two mechanisms is generally determined by
the structure of the antioxidant and the pH of the medium. Thus, in the
presence of an antioxidant, there is a discoloration of the bluegreen
color of the cation radical ABTS, tending to be colorless, which is quanti￾fied as a decrease in absorbance at 734 nm (San Miguel-Chávez, 2017;
Zhong & Shahidi, 2015). Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchro￾man-2-carboxylic acid) is used as an antioxidant standard. A disadvantage
of the ABTS method is that the radical must be generated before the test
is carried out and the reaction is only completed after 16 hours
(Amarowicz & Pegg, 2019).
The FolinCiocalteu method is based on the reduction of the
FolinCiocalteu reagent by phenolic compounds under alkaline condi￾tions. This reagent consists of a mixture of phosphomolybdic acid
(H3PMo12O40) and phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40). In the presence
of phenolic compounds, these two acids are reduced to molybdenum
oxide (Mo8O23) and tungsten oxide (W8O23), respectively, resulting in a
bluish color that absorbs in the visible range with a maximum wavelength
at 725 nm (Zhong & Shahidi, 2015). This reduction occurs in an alkaline
medium, and the most suitable reagent is sodium carbonate. The result of
the total phenolic content in the sample is expressed in gallic acid equiva￾lents using an analytical curve. Ferulic acid, catechin, tannic acid, and sina￾pic acid were also used as standard compounds (Amarowicz & Pegg,
2019). The disadvantage of this method is that the FolinCiocalteu
reagent may also react with other nonphenolic substances present in com￾plex samples, especially with any readily reducible components present in
the test mixture, such as ascorbic acid (Amarowicz & Pegg, 2019). Other
compounds that may interfere are ascorbic acid, sugars, organic acids, aro￾matic amines, proteins, and also some inorganic substances such as iron
164 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssulfate, potassium nitrite, sodium phosphate, and manganese sulfate, lead￾ing to an overestimation of the total phenolic compounds.
Despite these considerations, the use of enzymatic biosensors to evalu￾ate a specific antioxidant or its total content in beverages makes sample
preparation simpler, can be miniaturized, is time-saving, requires minimal
sample pretreatment, and reduces costs (Hoyos-Arbeláez et al., 2017;
Rotariu et al., 2016). In addition, they provide high sensitivity with very
good detection limits and selectivity for electrochemical measurements of
antioxidants in complex samples. Their use avoids the interference in the
analysis by the presence of some compounds such as ascorbic acid, which
can mask the presence of other organic acids at lower concentrations, or
the high content of anthocyanins, which can interfere with direct spectro￾photometric measurements (Lino et al., 2014; Sousa et al., 2004).
9.3 Oxidoreductase enzymes used in the development of
electrochemical biosensors for the determination of
phenolic compounds (antioxidants)
An enzymatic biosensor can be defined as an analytical device consisting
of an immobilized enzyme in close contact with a suitable transducer
(Fatibello-Filho & Capelato, 1992; Thévenot et al., 2001; Turner, 2013).
Generally, oxidoreductase enzymes are used for the determination of phe￾nolic compounds (antioxidants) in beverages (Rotariu et al., 2016), with
tyrosinase, laccase, and peroxidase being the most widely used in the last
decade because of their ability to catalyze a wide range of redox reactions.
Antioxidants can be determined directly on the surface of electro￾chemical sensors by exploring their oxidation process. However, this
determination is associated with a high overvoltage, the contribution of
interfering species, and parallel reactions with the formation of polymeric
products that can passivate the sensor surface, whereas electrochemical
biosensors containing an oxidoreductase enzyme can overcome these
inconveniences (Rosatto et al., 2001; Siraj et al., 2021).
The use of the biosensor assembled with this class of enzymes leads to
the formation of species that can be electrochemically reduced in an elec￾trode surface to detect/determine the phenolic compounds at a conve￾nient low potential (at potentials close to 0.0 V vs SCE) (Rosatto et al.,
2001). The measured reduction current is proportional to the concentra￾tion of the antioxidant (phenolic compound) in the solution. The stage of
catalysis of the phenolic compound by the enzyme oxidoreductase
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 165(catalytic oxidation) leads to high concentrations of the oxidized species in
the solution, which consequently leads to a larger signal of the current
intensity resulting from the electrochemical reduction (Rosatto et al.,
2001). For this reason, the reduction signal of the oxidized species is used
to quantify the phenolic compound. In addition, there are other ways to
monitor the concentration of phenolic compounds, such as detecting the
consumption of O2 or the consumption of H2O2.
Tyrosinase (monophenol monooxygenase; EC 1.14.18.1) and laccase
(benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) belong to the
enzyme family of multicopper oxidases because they have copper atoms
distributed between the bonding sites (Rosatto et al., 2001). They are
widely distributed in some plants, animals, and microorganisms and
exhibit different substrate selectivity and mechanisms. Although laccase
and tyrosinase are copper proteins that catalyze the oxidation of phenolic
compounds, their specificities and mechanisms are different.
Tyrosinase enzymes catalyze reactions of mono- (except ferulic acid)
and diphenols, such as p-cresol, catechol, and levodopa, which are first
hydroxylated to the ortho position to form o-diphenols and further oxi￾dized to o-quinones, while the enzyme is oxidized back to its native form
by reduction of molecular oxygen (Rosatto et al., 2001). This enzyme
shows no significant activity in the oxidation of p- and m-benzenediols
and their substituted derivatives (Bucur et al., 2021). Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2)
represent the two successive phases of the action of the enzyme tyrosinase
in the catalysis of phenolic compounds involving molecular oxygen.

Laccases catalyze the oxidation of a variety of substrates such as phenol,
ortho-, para- and meta-benzenediols and their substituted derivatives, aro￾matic amines, and heterocyclic compounds with the concomitant four￾electron reduction of oxygen to water [Eq. (9.3)], without the intermedi￾ate formation of hydrogen peroxide (Arregui et al., 2019; Brugnari et al.,
2021; Rodríguez-Delgado et al., 2015; Rosatto et al., 2001).

166 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsAnother oxidoreductase enzyme used for the determination of pheno￾lic compounds and, consequently, the antioxidant capacity related to
them is the peroxidases (hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase; EC 1.11.1.7).
These enzymes are hemeproteins (cofactor: Fe31 protoporphyrin), and
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is the most commonly used peroxidase
enzyme, mainly because of its high stability over long periods at room
temperature and because it is commercially available. Its response to phe￾nolic compounds is based on the mechanism of double displacement by
two substrates, H2O2 and the electron-donating phenolic compounds.
The enzyme is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to form a first intermediate
[HRP-I; Eq. (9.4)]. The enzyme is then reduced to its native form (HRP
[Fe31]) in two steps, with the phenolic compound being oxidized in each
step [Eqs. (9.5) and (9.6)]. AH2 and AH are the reducing substrate and its
oxidized radical species, respectively. The oxidized form of the phenolic
compound can be reduced on the electrode surface [Eq. (9.7)] and used
for its quantification in a real sample. Another way to quantify the pheno￾lic compound is to correlate H2O2 with phenolic compound content (Hu
et al., 2008; Krainer & Glieder, 2015; Rosatto et al., 2001; Veitch, 2004).

The enzymatic biosensors developed for the determination of antioxi￾dants can be set up in two different main configurations: the addition of
the enzyme to a carbon paste modified with nanostructured materials by
procedures similar to those used to prepare the solid graphite electrode or
immobilization of the enzyme by physical or chemical means on the sur￾face of a solid electrode modified with nanostructured materials
(Munteanu & Apetrei, 2022). This one was most commonly used because
of its better sensitivity, and the enzyme does not leach into the solution
during analysis. On the other hand, it is easy to prepare, versatile and
offers the possibility to immobilize cofactors and mediators when
necessary.
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 1679.4 General aspects of the construction of electrochemical
enzymatic biosensors
When designing a biosensor, it is very important to have a sensor (trans￾ducer) that has high redox currents and lower redox overpotential relative
to the target analyte, as this ensures better biosensor performance, such as
sensitivity, stability, and selectivity (Abdulbari & Basheer, 2017; Malhotra
& Ali, 2018; Turner, 2013). This is achieved by preparing the sensor that
is to receive the enzyme with nanostructured materials, either carbon￾based or metal nanoparticles. The shape and size of the nanomaterials pro￾vide an increase in electrochemical activity compared to that of the corre￾sponding raw material (Luo et al., 2006).
Carbonaceous structures, present on a nanoscale of 1100 nm, show
new properties due to their dimension, which are completely different
from those of the bulk material and improve the sensitivity of the sensor
(Bezzon et al., 2019), and for this reason, it has been widely used in the
development of different sensors (Hareesha et al., 2021; Manjunatha,
2020; Prinith et al., 2021; Raril & Manjunatha, 2020; Scremin et al.
2021, 2022; Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020). In addition, the high reactivity
of various carbon structures allows functionalization, which can increase
the selectivity for the desired analysis or enable the immobilization of
enzymes on their surface to obtain biosensors (Bezzon et al., 2019).
Metal nanoparticles are structures of pure metal (e.g., gold, platinum,
and titanium) or their compounds (oxides, sulfides, and hydroxides) with
dimensions (length, width, and thickness) in the size range of 1100 nm.
At such small sizes, many metals have improved the analytical perfor￾mance (sensitivity and selectivity) of the bare electrode used for surface
modification (Barsan & Brett, 2016). This is due to their large surface￾area-to-volume ratio, which immensely increases the contact area
(Campbell & Compton, 2010; Jamkhande et al., 2019; Kumar et al.,
2018; Mody et al., 2010).
In the last decade, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene, and metallic
nanoparticles have been used as nanostructured materials for the develop￾ment of biosensors to detect/determine antioxidants. By exploring the
properties of nanomaterials and their dimensions at the nanoscale, biosen￾sors can detect low concentrations of the analyte of interest (Malhotra &
Ali, 2018). In addition, some metallic nanoparticles can allow proteins to
maintain their biological activity upon adsorption by providing a microen￾vironment similar to that of redox proteins in native systems (Barsan &
168 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsBrett, 2016; Liu & Ju, 2003; Luo et al., 2006). Thus enzymes can be con￾veniently immobilized on existing functional groups on these nanomater￾ials used to modify the surface of electrodes commonly used in
electroanalysis (glassy carbon, graphite, metallic) and still retain their bio￾activity efficiently.
Immobilization of the enzyme on the surface of the sensor must be
considered to obtain a stable device with a long useful life (several mea￾surements without surface renewal or loss of enzyme activity). Different
methods are used for the immobilization of the enzyme on the surface of
electrodes modified with nanostructured materials. Physical adsorption,
entrapment, and crosslinking have been the main methods used in the
development of biosensors for the determination of antioxidants
(Fernández-Fernández et al., 2013; Sassolas et al., 2012).
Physical adsorption is a simple and inexpensive immobilization method
in which the enzyme is attached to the electrode surface by hydrophobic
and ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals forces, by
amino acid groups of the enzyme and the groups present on the surface
of the electrochemical sensor (Sassolas et al., 2012). Entrapment is another
method of enzyme immobilization in which the enzyme can be entrapped
in a porous matrix (polyacrylamide, collagen, alginate, or gelatin), retain￾ing the enzyme in a physical form and allowing the passage of the sub￾strate and products. In the crosslinking method, the enzyme is
immobilized on the surface of the electrochemical sensor with a chemical
bi- or multifunctional reagent; that is, the chemical molecule has at least
two reactive ends that bind to specific groups of amino acids on the
enzyme surface via chemical bonding. Glutaraldehyde, epichlorohydrin,
and 1-ethyl-3-(3-[dimethylamino] propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC) are commonly used as chemical agents for protein crosslinking.
Although this method is more difficult and expensive than adsorption, it
can provide a more stable immobilized enzyme. In this method, the
immobilized enzyme is better protected from the environment and is not
easily leached into the solution during measurements because the strength
of the chemical bond is greater than in the physical adsorption or entrap￾ment methods (Fernández-Fernández et al., 2013; Sassolas et al., 2012).
Fig. 9.1 shows a schematic representation of a carbon- or metal-based
electrode modified with nanostructured materials to enhance the analytical
signal. After this modification, an oxidoreductase enzyme is physically or
chemically immobilized on the surface of the nanomaterial to detect and
identify antioxidants in beverages. This figure also shows the
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 169electrochemical cell used in the measurements, which consists of three
electrodes: reference, working (biosensor), and auxiliary, all inserted into a
supporting electrolyte. The potential signal applied to the surface of the
working electrode is measured in relation to the fixed potential of the ref￾erence electrode and the current flow between the working electrode and
the auxiliary electrode. In amperometry, the current generated by the
chemical reaction of the oxidized species (which occurs during enzymatic
oxidation) on the surface of the transducer is measured while a constant
potential is applied. In contrast, in voltammetry, the potential is varied
during the measurement of the reduction current (Haddad & Haddad,
1990).
9.5 Application of enzymatic biosensor for the
determination of a specific antioxidant or its total content
in beverages
In the last decade, polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and
gallic acid were the exogenous antioxidants that emerged as targets deter￾mined in beverages using electrochemical enzymatic biosensors. Catechol,
guaiacol, and Trolox were used as antioxidant molecules to measure the
total content of the antioxidant in beverages employing enzymatic biosen￾sors. Other exogenous antioxidants that were determined using biosensors
were tyrosol, rutin, catechin, and quercetin.

and auxiliary electrodes immersed in a supporting electrolyte (buffer solution); (B) a
carbon- or metal-based electrode modified with nanostructured materials (carbon
nanostructured material, metal nanoparticle, and both nanostructured materials in the
same modification) employed for the immobilization of an oxidoreductase enzyme.
170 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsNext, the analytical methods described in the literature for the deter￾mination of antioxidants in different types of beverages using electro￾chemical enzymatic biosensors are presented. These were distinguished
according to the type of nanostructured material used in the modification
of the sensor for the immobilization of the enzyme, namely carbon-based
nanomaterial (single-walled carbon nanotubes [SWCNTs], multi-walled
carbon nanotubes [MWCNTs], reduced graphene oxide [rGO], and car￾bon black), metal nanoparticle (AuNPs, PtPd bimetallic alloy NPs,
PtNPs, and PdNPs), carbon-based nanomaterial/metal nanoparticle
(CNTs/AuNPs, fullerene/AuNPs, rGO/PtNPs, graphene nanoplatelets/
AuNPs, and graphene quantum dots [GQDs]/molybdenum disulfide
[MoS2] nanoflakes).
9.5.1 Carbon-based nanomaterials
Table 9.1 presents the enzymatic biosensors reported in the literature
employing carbon-based nanomaterials. The antioxidant, the base elec￾trode used to prepare the biosensor, and the nanostructured material used
to modify the base sensor are presented. In addition, this table shows the
potential used for the quantification of the antioxidant and also the LOD
value.
Polyphenol compounds were determined in green tea employing the
tyrosinase biosensor developed using a carbon screen-printed electrode (C￾SPE) modified with SWCNTs and iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) (Apetrei
et al., 2012). Tyrosinase was immobilized by glutaraldehyde crosslinking
technique, and the analytical determination was based on the catechin
reduction peak at about 10.15 V (vs Ag/AgCl) by amperometry. The
FePc was used in the modification to provide an increase in the peak cur￾rent, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the biosensor. Catechin was used
in this study to relate the content of polyphenol compounds in green tea;
however, a study of interferences possibly present in this type of samples or
of other phenolic compounds was not realized. Catechin presented a linear
response range for 5.0250 μmol L21 in 0.01 mol L21 phosphate buffer
solution (pH 7.0), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.89 μmol L21
.
Infusions of green tea were prepared and analyzed by the Tyr/SWCNTs￾FePc/C-SPE biosensor and the FolinCiocalteu method, showing a good
relationship between the results of the total content of polyphenols.
Tyrosinase biosensor based on nanostructured carbon materials was
also developed for the determination of caffeic acid in beers (Wang et al.,

cvs Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21 KCl).2013). The GCE was modified with SWCNTs dispersed in chitosan.
Then, tyrosinase was immobilized on the SWCNTs with the EDC
reagent. After, polyaniline was dropped onto this surface to obtain the
final biosensor, with tyrosinase enzyme embedded into SWCNTs and
polyaniline (PANI/Tyr-SWCNTs/GCE). This material offered a porous
microstructure with numerous cavities, promoting a highly accessible sur￾face area for the reaction between enzyme and substrate. The developed
biodevice was evaluated every 3 days, and after 24 days, its response was
about 90% of the initial, showing relatively good stability, which the
authors justified by the biocompatible microenvironment provided by
polyaniline for the protection of the enzyme-specific ability.
Amperometric measurements of caffeic acid at 0.1 V (vs SCE) were
recorded in 0.1 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5), and a linear
concentration range was obtained between 0.25 and 470 μmol L21
, with
LOD of 0.06 μmol L21
. The authors did not present studies of possible
interfering compounds in the developed biosensor response. Before the
analysis, beer samples were degasified by centrifugation and diluted five
times in the supporting electrolyte. In this work, the authors did not use
the spectrophotometric method to compare the results obtained. The
analyses were carried out by the standard addition method and presented
recovery percentages of 100.2%102.2%.
Another example of a nanostructured tyrosinase biosensor based on
amperometric measurements of the Trolox molecule (a water-soluble
derivative of vitamin E with antioxidant properties) was reported by Sýs
et al. for the determination of the equivalent antioxidant capacity in red
and white wines. To obtain this biosensor, the surface of a carbon paste
electrode (CPE) was modified with MWCNTs dispersed in N,N￾dimethylformamide (Sýs et al., 2015). Then, the tyrosinase enzyme was
immobilized on this surface with Nafion, named Tyr/Nafion/
MWCNTs/CPE. Wine samples were directly transferred to the electro￾chemical cell containing 0.1 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0),
and the amperograms were registered by the reduction process of Trolox
at 0.25 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21 KCl). The authors compared
the results obtained using the biosensor with those obtained using the
official spectrophotometric method based on DPPH, emphasizing that the
use of the biosensor avoids the use of solutions with unstable radicals.
Another biosensor for quantifying the total content of polyphenols in
wines and black tea was constructed by modifying a GCE with activated
MWCNT-COOHs dispersed in the choline-phenylalanine [Ch][Phe]
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 173ionic liquid (Zappi et al., 2018). Enzyme immobilization was performed
by mixing laccase in MWCNTs-COOH/ionic liquid suspension and fur￾ther crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The biosensor response decreased
by 10% after 10 days and 33% after 20 days. This stability was attributed
to the antifouling properties of the ionic liquid and the high enzyme load￾ing, which were effectively immobilized. The proposed biosensor was
coupled with flow injection analysis (FIA) for the amperometric detection
of gallic acid at 0.1 V (vs SCE). This antioxidant exhibited a linear
behavior in the concentration range of 6.0300 μmol L21
, with LOD of
6.0 μmol L21 in 0.5 mol L21 acetate buffer solution (pH 5.0). Gallic acid
was used to relate the amount of polyphenol compounds in red wine,
white wine, and black tea. The analyses made by the GCE/MWCNTs/
[Ch][Phe]/Lac biosensor and the FolinCiocalteu method were com￾pared, and the differences between the obtained results by both methods
were justified by the lack of specificity from the spectrophotometric
method. Additionally, according to the authors, the determination of
polyphenols performed by the biosensor did not show interference from
reducing sugars, and the low work potential prevented the interference of
ascorbic acid and quercetin.
Vlamidis et al. developed two biosensors, a laccase, and a tyrosinase
biosensor, both based on the immobilization of the enzyme on the GCE
surface modified with MWCNTs and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) dis￾persed in N,N-dimethylformamide (Vlamidis et al., 2017). The graphene
oxide was electrochemically reduced after drop-casting onto the GCE
surface. According to the authors, MWCNTs combined with rGO pro￾vided better electrode sensitivity than when used separately. The enzyme
was immobilized immediately after the electrochemical reduction of gra￾phene. The laccase biosensor was prepared by the immobilization with
bovine serum albumin reticulated with glutaraldehyde (Lac/rGO￾MWCNTs/GCE) and operated in a 0.1 mol L21 acetate buffer solution
(pH 4.5), whereas the tyrosinase was immobilized with chitosan (Tyr/
rGO-MWCNTs/GCE) and used in 0.05 mol L21 phosphate buffer solu￾tion (pH 6.5). Storing the biosensors in buffer solutions proved to be a
better alternative when compared to storage under dry conditions. The
biodevice composed of laccase maintained 93.3% of its original response
after 1 month, whereas the tyrosinase biosensor showed less stability and
lost its initial response at about 50% after 2 days of use.
Chronoamperometric measurements at 0.0 V and 0.1 V (vs SCE) of var￾ious catechol concentrations showed linear responses in the range of
174 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications1.0300 and 1.0340 μmol L21
, with LOD values of 0.3 and 0.5 μmol L21
,
respectively, for the laccase and tyrosinase biosensors. The authors noted
that the tyrosinase biosensor showed higher sensitivity compared to the
laccase biosensor and that this increase in sensitivity was not related to the
higher activity of the biomolecule, as the tyrosinase enzyme lost some of
its activity even when it was very well immobilized. In addition, the
tyrosinase biosensor also responded to gallic acid and rutin. Benzoic acid
and 2,3-di-hydroxybenzoic acids act as inhibitors because they block elec￾tron transfer from the electrode to the Cu ions. The poor response of the
tyrosinase biosensor to other analytes tested (pyrogallol, dopamine, epica￾techin, catechin, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid) was attributed to the
lower activity of the immobilized enzyme. Nevertheless, the two biosen￾sors were used in the determination of total polyphenol content in com￾mercial juices. The samples were centrifuged, filtered, diluted in the
appropriate buffer solution, and immediately analyzed by the two biosen￾sors. The results obtained for the antioxidant capacity of the samples using
both biosensors were compared with the ABTS spectrophotometric
method, showing differences between these results. In addition, two of
the analyzed samples showed higher values of antioxidant capacity. The
authors suggested that this is related to the known high content of carote￾noids and ascorbic acid in these two samples. However, the analytical
response of biosensors was not studied separately for these compounds.
The total content of phenolic compounds was analyzed in herbal teas
using an amperometric laccase biosensor (Boujakhrout et al., 2016). For
this purpose, the CGE was modified with a nanohybrid material based on
glycol chitosan (GC)-rGO, and the enzyme was immobilized on this
modification by the crosslinking technique with glutaraldehyde. Through
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the authors demonstrated
the high conductivity of the nanohybrid material and the high enzyme
loading on the biosensor surface. Better stability of the biosensor was
achieved when stored under wet conditions (0.5 mol L21 phosphate
buffer solution [pH 5.5]) at 4°C, which promoted the maintenance of the
full performance of the biosensor. Catechol was used as a standard mole￾cule to determine the total phenolic content in herbal teas. Its reduction
process, measured at 0.15 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21 KCl),
showed a linear behavior at concentrations of 0.215 μmol L21
, with
LOD of 0.076 μmol L21
, in 0.1 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH
5.5). An interference study was performed for D-glucose, fructose, D￾galactose, NO3
2, 17β-estradiol, 17α-ethinyl estradiol, bisphenol A, uric
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 175acid, and ascorbic acid. With the exception of ascorbic acid, which caused
an increase in the cathodic current of about 17%, the other compounds
did not affect the catechol response. The samples were prepared by infus￾ing red fruit tea, peppermint tea, and green lemon tea with boiling water.
The total phenolic content was determined in the samples by the Lac/
GC-rGO/GCE biosensor and the FolinCiocalteu method, and the
results correlated linearly.
Carboxymethyl-botryosphaeran (CMB) was used to covalently immo￾bilize laccase in an aqueous solution using EDC and N￾hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Gomes et al., 2020). A sufficient aliquot of
this solution was then layered on the surface of the carbon black paste
electrode (CBPE). This solution containing laccase immobilized on CMB
can be used to prepare various biosensors. The CBPE/CMB-Lac biosen￾sor was evaluated in terms of its stability, and after 30 days of experiments,
the RSD of its response was calculated at 3.24%. This result was justified
by the effective immobilization of the enzyme in the CMB, which pre￾serves the biocatalytic activity of the enzyme and ensures the long-term
stability of the biosensor. The cathodic peak resulting from quercetin
reduction at the electrode surface at 10.23 V (vs Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21
KCl) was monitored by SWV in 0.5 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution
(pH 6.0) and showed a linear response in the concentration range of
0.04980.794 μmol L21
, with LOD of 0.026 μmol L21
. Other phenolic
compounds such as epinephrine, dopamine, paracetamol, guaiacol, and
catechol did not cause significant interference in the cathodic response.
The constructed biosensor was used for the quantification of quercetin in
red wine, apple juice, lemon juice, and green tea. Samples were trans￾ferred directly to the electrochemical cell without any sample treatment,
and analyses were performed using the standard addition method. In this
work, the authors used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
to compare the results obtained. They found that the results obtained by
both methods were statistically equivalent at a 95% confidence level.

cvs silver pseudo-reference electrode.Sánchez-Obrero et al. used a tyrosinase enzyme-based biosensor for
the determination of phenolic compound content in wines (Sánchez￾Obrero et al., 2012). The biosensor was prepared by immobilizing the
tyrosinase enzyme in a colloidal gold nanoparticle (AuNPs)-tetrathiafulva￾lene-tetracyanoquinodimethane-PVC (AuNPs/TTF-TCNQ/PVC) com￾posite electrode by the crosslinking technique. The enzyme was added to
the composite by the drop-casting technique, and after drying, it was
immersed in a glutaraldehyde solution for 40 min. The authors mention
the good electrochemical properties of the biosensor but did not present
studies about it. The analytical curve was obtained using FIA with amper￾ometric detection at 0.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl [3.0 mol L21 KCl]) and showed a
linear concentration range between 0.6 and 10 μmol L21 and a LOD of
0.643 μmol L21 in 0.05 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The
wine samples (white, rosé, and red) were properly diluted in the support￾ing electrolyte and analyzed in terms of the polyphenolic compound con￾tent by extrapolating the analytical curve, with the results expressed in
catechol. The authors declared that the proposed biosensor has good sta￾bility for 2 weeks and recommend replacing it after 34 weeks. The
results obtained using the biosensor were significantly different from those
obtained by the FolinCiocalteu reference method. The methods are
based on different principles. The reference method consists of a redox
reaction of phenols, and the biosensor is based on an enzyme reaction,
which depends on the applied potential. Using the biosensor, different
fractions of total polyphenols are obtained by changing the reduction
potential, obtaining with the biosensor results corresponding to the “anti￾oxidant fraction.” This indicates that proper selection of method or a com￾bination of methods is important for a valid evaluation of total antioxidant
content in beverages.
Tyrosinase was also used as a biorecognition element in the biosensor
developed for the determination of catechin (Singh et al., 2013). The
enzyme was entrapped in the matrix of the composite of AuNPs and poly￾pyrrole (PPy) electrodeposited in a platinum disk electrode, resulting in
the Pt/AuNPsPPy/Tyr biosensor. EIS and cyclic voltammetry studies
showed that the presence of the AuNPs in the composite matrix enhanced
the electrochemical response and led to an increase in conductivity, current
intensity, and diffusion coefficient. The voltammetric profile of catechin
showed three electrochemical processes: the oxidation of the catechol moi￾ety to o-quinone at 10.24 V, the reduction of o-quinone to catechin at
10.14 V, and a small peak at 10.62 V (vs Ag/AgCl) corresponding to
178 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsthe oxidation of the hydroxyl group present in the central ring of catechin.
The current intensity of the reduction process was monitored by cyclic
voltammetry in the presence of different concentrations of catechin, and a
linear range was observed from 0.001 to 0.01 μmol L21 with LOD of
0.0012 μmol L21 in 0.05 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0).
The authors suggested that the better analytical features obtained in this
study compared to other studies reported in the literature might be due to
the incorporation of gold nanoparticles. Packed apple juice samples were
analyzed using the Pt/AuNPsPPy/Tyr biosensor and chromatography,
and the catechin concentration was calculated by correlating the analytical
signal with the respective analytical curve. For the chromatographic mea￾surements, methanolic extracts of each sample (5%) were prepared from
apple juices filtered twice through filter paper (0.2 μm), while no sample
preparation was mentioned for the amperometric measurements. The
obtained results differed from each other by up to 9.2%. Moreover, the
long-term stability study of the biosensor showed 85% of its initial sensitiv￾ity in 70 days.
Cerrato-Alvarez et al. developed a simple biosensor based on glutaral￾dehyde crosslinking immobilization of tyrosinase on a C-SPE modified
with AuNPs (Tyr/AuNPs/C-SPE) and its application in the determina￾tion of total phenolic content in commercial beers (high fermented, low
fermented, and nonalcoholic) (Cerrato-Alvarez et al., 2019). This content
in beers was expressed as mg L21 of tyrosol since this is the main phenolic
compound in this beverage type. The analytical curve was obtained by
amperometry at 0.2 V (vs silver pseudo-reference electrode) in the range
of 2.540 μmol L21 in 0.1 μmol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0),
with LOD of 1.7 μmol L21
. Sample preparation was simple, the beers
were degassed, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1 mol L21 phos￾phate buffer solution. This biosensor showed an RSD of 1.7% for 29
measurements. The analyses performed by the FolinCiocalteu method
showed higher concentrations of phenolic content in the beer samples.
The authors commented that this occurred because of the nonselectivity
of this method compared with the biosensor, which has the advantage of
being restricted to the detection of phenolic compounds that are substrates
of tyrosinase. It should be noted that the authors did not perform a study
of interferences for the developed biosensor in the sample types analyzed.
In the construction of a biosensor for polyphenol quantification in
green coffee and yerba mate beverages, the HRP enzyme was immobi￾lized by electrostatic forces on nanohydrogels composed of laponite (Lap),
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 179AuNPs, and a vinylbenzyltriethylammonium polycation copolymerized
with vinylbenzylthymine groups (Lap/{[(VBT)(VBA)4]
41}  25/AuNPs/
HRP) (Tulli et al., 2018). The AuNPs incorporated into this matrix
caused an improvement in conductivity, resulting in a reduction of the
charge transfer resistance. This biosensor was air dried at 25°C and
immersed in 0.1 mol L21 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) for 45 min￾utes for the swelling step before use. The mechanism of this biosensor was
to monitor the reduction process of the oxidized polyphenol by ampero￾metry at 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21 KCl), which was previ￾ously formed from the enzymatic oxidation of the phenolic compound in
the presence of H2O2. The assay for polyphenolic content was based on
the use of chlorogenic acid, and the linear response was obtained up to
4.2 μmol L21 with LOD of 2.7 nmol L21
, in 0.1 mol L21 phosphate
buffer solution (pH 5.0), containing 600 μmol L21 H2O2. According to
the authors, typical substances present in plant tissues, such as glucose,
ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid, were investigated as possible
interfering compounds, and none of them caused a significant change in
the chlorogenic acid response. Furthermore, this biosensor maintained
95% of its initial response after 7 days of storage in the buffer solution at
8°C. The samples of green coffee and yerba mate were prepared by add￾ing an appropriate amount of each one in water at 80°C, shaking for
10 minutes, and then filtering. The results of the analyses using the bio￾sensor and the FolinCiocalteu spectrophotometric method showed that
the analytical methods were not statistically different at a 95% confidence
level.
Pusch et al. reported the development of a biosensor based on the
modification of CPE with platinum (Pt)palladium (Pd) bimetallic alloy
nanoparticles dispersed in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluoropho￾sphate ionic liquid (Pt-Pd-BMI.PF6) together with peroxidase (PO)
enzyme immobilized on the nanoclay matrix (PO/BMI.PF6Pt0.5-Pd0.5/
CPE) by physical adsorption (Pusch et al., 2013). The nanostructured
materials added to the graphite paste led to an improvement in the analyt￾ical response of the caffeic acid. The reduction process of this phenolic
compound at 10.22 V (vs Ag/AgCl [3.0 mol L21 KCl]) was used for the
determination of caffeic acid in white wines by SWV in 0.1 mol L21
ace￾tate buffer solution (pH 5.0). Linearity was observed in the concentration
range of 2.722 μmol L21
, with a LOD of 0.37 μmol L21
. Moreover,
the biosensor showed 80% of its initial response after 80 days (over 600
measurements; renewed surface as necessary), demonstrating excellent
180 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsstability. The authors observed that chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, querce￾tin, and catechin showed peaks at very close potential values, suggesting
the lack of specificity of the PO/BMI.PF6Pt0.5-Pd0.5/CPE biosensor, but
its selectivity for this group of phenolic compounds. An interference study
showed that ascorbic acid, glucose, and sucrose did not cause significant
changes in the biosensor response, even at 10-fold excess; nonetheless, sul￾fite and bisulfite (1:10 molar ratio) caused a change in the cathodic current
of caffeic acid of about 50%. The wine samples were acidified with
hydrochloric acid and bubbled with nitrogen to eliminate the interfering
species before analysis. The proposed biosensor was used in the determi￾nation of polyphenols in white wines from five different grape varieties
and showed good recovery percentages (95.5%108.3%). Additionally,
the samples were also analyzed by the FolinCiocalteu method, and
despite the higher results, the methods showed good correlation
(r 5 0.990).
A laccase biosensor was constructed by Salamanca-Neto et al. for the
determination of chlorogenic acid in coffee beverages. Employing a sta￾tistical mixture designer, the optimum ratio of the biosensor content was
established as 1:6:1 of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), exopolysaccharide
botryosphaeran (BOT), and laccase (Salamanca-Neto et al., 2020). The
layers of each material were sequentially deposited on the CPE previ￾ously prepared with graphite oxide (Lac/PtNPs/BOT/CPE). The
response of the biosensor decreased by 6.42% after 150 measurements
were performed over 30 days. The analytical curve for chlorogenic acid
was constructed based on the 5-o-caffeoylquinic acid response, the major
constituent of the caffeic acid group in coffee, by SWV in 0.1 mol L21
phosphate buffer solution (pH 4.0) using the reduction process at about
10.42 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21 KCl). It increased linearly with
concentrations in the range of 0.567.3 μmol L21
, with a LOD of 0.18
μmol L21
. An interference study was performed for species commonly
present in coffee such as ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, caf￾feine, and glucose. Biosensor response variations were calculated to be up
to 4.5% for an equal molar ratio and up to 6.3% for a 1:10 molar ratio.
Traditional and specialty coffee beverages were analyzed by the biosen￾sing method and by chromatography. The results showed relative errors
lower than 6.42% and high correlation (r 5 0.975). The authors con￾cluded that this laccase biosensor can serve as a selective method for the
determination of chlorogenic acid for the quality control of brewed cof￾fee beverages.
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 181Mattos et al. immobilized laccase on the photoactive material hematite
(α-Fe2O3) decorated with palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) to develop a
biosensor for the highly sensitive determination of the flavonoid rutin in
green tea and red wine (Mattos et al., 2021). Laccase was immobilized on
PdNPs decorating α-Fe2O3-faceted microcubes by the physical adsorption
technique. EIS demonstrated that the nanomaterial caused an increase in
the electron transfer rate in the electrochemical system. The combination
of the photoelectrochemical process with the biocatalytic oxidation by
enzymes was explored to quantify this flavonoid based on the resulting
cathodic signal at 10.33 V versus Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L21 KCl) by SWV.
The analytical curve showed linearity in the concentration range of
0.08300 nmol L21
, with a LOD of 0.084 nmol L21
. Other phenolic
compounds such as epinephrine, dopamine, paracetamol, guaiacol, cate￾chol, hydroquinone, phenylamine, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, ferulic
acid, gallic acid, coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and quinic acid were evalu￾ated as potentially interfering species, but none of them caused a signifi￾cant effect in the rutin response, even at 10-fold excess. Green tea and red
wine were analyzed directly by the Lac/(αFe2O3.PdNPs)/GCE biosensor
without prior sample treatment. The determined rutin concentrations
were compared to those obtained by the HPLC method and showed no
statistical difference at the 95% confidence level. The biosensor was used
for 30 days with an RSD of the cathodic signal of 2.8%. These results
demonstrate that the immobilization of the enzyme on the PdNPs,
although performed by physical adsorption, proved to be efficient, indi￾cating that the enzyme activity was maintained over several analyses with￾out renewing the surface.

employing carbon-based nanomaterials and metal nanoparticles. The anti￾oxidant, the base electrode used to prepare the biosensor, and the nanos￾tructured material used to modify the base sensor are presented. In

antioxidant and also the LOD value.

enzyme with glutaraldehyde. An enzymeBSA solution was applied to
the electrode surface, and after 30 min, a glutaraldehyde solution was also
added and dried at room temperature. Gallic acid was used as a standard
for the electroanalytical studies of the GCE/CNT-NH2/AuNPs/Lac-BSA
biosensor. The evaluation of total phenolic content was based on the
reduction process of gallic acid at 0.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 mol L21
citric buffer solution (pH 6.0). Using the FIA system with amperometric
detection, the gallic acid concentrations showed a linear behavior in the
range of 3.060 μmol L21 and LOD of 0.71 μmol L21
. The infusions of
jasmine and mulberry were analyzed by the proposed amperometric bio￾sensor and the classical FolinCiocalteu spectrophotometric method, and
the results showed that the methods significantly agreed with each other.
Another nanostructured laccase-based electrochemical biosensor was
developed by Lanzellato et al. (2014). These authors coupled two differ￾ent nanomaterials (AuNPs and fullerenes); first, functionalized AuNPs
were immobilized on a gold screen-printed electrode (Au-SPE) surface
modified with a self-assembled monolayer of suitable thiols, and then, the
polyhydroxy fullerene was linked to the AuNPs-modified electrode,
where the laccase enzyme was finally immobilized by using EDC and
NHS reagents (Au-SPE/AuNPs-fullerenols/Lac). Characterization studies
showed that the nanostructured materials improved the electrochemical
performance of the Au-SPE in terms of electroactive area and electron
transfer kinetics. Using gallic acid as the polyphenol standard, the biosen￾sor was operated in the FIA system with amperometric detection at
0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and showed a linear concentration range of
30300 μmol L21
, with a LOD of 6.0 μmol L21 in 0.1 mol L21 acetate
buffer solution (pH 4.5). The sensitivity of the biosensor was 87% after
120 days of preparation and about 53% after 240 days. The authors did
not present a study of the biosensor response in the presence of other
antioxidant compounds, since these compounds and others may be pres￾ent in beverages. Samples of white and red wines were diluted 10 and
100 times, respectively, in the buffer solution before the analysis. The
polyphenol content was determined by the described biosensor and
FolinCiocalteu method, and the results agreed with each other.
Zrinski et al. also reported the use of C-SPE to obtain a biosensor to
evaluate the phenolic antioxidant capacity in wine and blueberry syrup
samples (Zrinski et al., 2020). The surface of this electrode was modified
with AuNPs and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPl), and the laccase enzyme
184 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationswas immobilized on gold nanoparticles with Nafion (Lac/AuNPs/GNPl/
C-SPE). They observed that both nanomaterials improved the electrical
conductivity of the biosensor. Furthermore, the presence of AuNPs
caused a homogeneous distribution of the enzyme, due to the preferential
adsorption of the enzyme to gold rather than to carbon, since in graphene
nanoplatelets the authors reported that there was an agglomeration of the
enzyme in small platelet-like structures. The biosensor showed stability
over 5 days after preparation, with no significant decrease in the current
response. The electrochemical reduction of the enzymatic oxidation prod￾uct of hydroquinone was monitored by chronoamperometry at a fixed
potential of 0.05 V (vs Ag/AgCl [3.0 mol L21 KCl]) in 0.1 mol L21
phosphate buffer solution and presented linear response in the range of
4.0130 μmol L21
, with a LOD of 1.5 μmol L21
. The authors carried
out a very detailed study on compounds that could interfere with the
evaluation of phenolic antioxidant capacity. Ascorbic acid and other com￾pounds that can be electrochemically oxidized at low potentials and glu￾cose were tested as possible interferents. In the presence of these
compounds, the biosensor showed low interference ( . 10%). On the
other hand, in the presence of caffeine, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, sina￾pic acid, syringic acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and phenol, a
response .23% was obtained. The total phenolic antioxidant capacity
was determined in red wine and blueberry syrup by the proposed biosen￾sor, and the results agreed with those obtained from the conventional
spectrophotometric method using ABTS.
Eremia et al. modified a C-SPE with PtNPs and rGO to immobilize
laccase by the adsorption method and stabilized it on a Nafion membrane
(Eremia et al., 2013). The authors highlighted that a better analytical
response was obtained when the rGO and PtNPs were used together in
the modification of C-SPE, due to the synergistic effects of both nanoma￾terials, which played an important role in facilitating electron transfer.
The C-SPE/PtNPs/rGO/Lac/Nafion biosensor was stored on a silica gel
layer at 4°C and preserved its initial response for 2 weeks, but after 6
weeks it showed a decrease of 12.6% in its response. Amperometric mea￾surements at 0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) of different concentrations of caffeic
acid revealed linear response in the range of 0.22 μmol L21
, with a
LOD of 0.09 μmol L21 in 0.1 mol L21 acetate buffer solution (pH 5.0).
Infusions of the teas (blueberry, lime, forest fruits, and exotic fruits) were
prepared in hot water (80°C) and diluted before the analysis. Total poly￾phenolic content, expressed as molar equivalents of caffeic acid, was
Electrochemical enzymatic biosensors 185determined in these samples by the developed biosensor and compared to
the results from the FolinCiocalteu method. The higher values obtained
in the spectrophotometric method were justified by this nonspecific reac￾tion; consequently, the method is affected by chemical interferences from
the other compounds present in the matrix. Additionally, they comment
that some fruit infusions may have a high content of anthocyanins that
contribute to the reduction of phosphomolybdate ions in the
FolinCiocalteu reagent.
A C-SPE was also used to fabricate another laccase biosensor
(Vasilescu et al., 2016). The surface of this electrode was modified with a
nanocomposite formed by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes and
graphene quantum dots (GQDs). The immobilization of the enzyme
occurred through electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged
laccase and the positively charged GQDs. The synergic interaction
between GQDs and MoS2 sheets improved the electrochemical perfor￾mance due to the increase in the electroactive area and conductivity
caused by the nanocomposite. The C-SPE-MoS2-GQDs-Lac biosensor
maintained 85% of its initial response after 4 weeks stored at 4°C. Caffeic
acid was used as a standard for the total polyphenolic content assays, and
its electrochemical reduction was detected by chronoamperometry at a
work potential of 0.05 V (vs silver pseudo-reference electrode) in
0.1 mol L21 acetate buffer solution (pH 5.0). Linear responses were
obtained in two concentration ranges: 0.3810 and 10100 μmol L21
,
with a LOD of 0.32 μmol L21
. Ethanol was evaluated as an interfering
agent due to its presence in the wine matrix, but it did not cause any
change in the biosensor response. The red wine samples were properly
diluted in acetate buffer solution (pH 5.0) and analyzed by the laccase
biosensor and the FolinCiocalteu method. The total polyphenolic con￾tent in the red wine determined by both methods agreed, except for two
samples, but the statistical test applied to these divergent results showed
no significant difference. However, the authors did not carry out studies
of other phenolic compounds with the biosensor, since they may be pres￾ent in red wine samples, as well as sugars, vitamins, and flavonoids.
9.6 Conclusion
In view of this, it can be concluded that the modification of the base elec￾trode (transducer) with nanostructured materials is very important to
improve the conductivity and consequently to obtain a better
186 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsperformance (sensitivity) of the devices, as well as to support the immobi￾lization of the enzyme. Furthermore, this brief review showed that it is
important to investigate different phenolic compounds and other inor￾ganic compounds or ions in the analytical response of the biosensor to
evaluate the selectivity and effect of the concomitant and/or other antiox￾idant compounds in the sample. It may be that not all phenolic com￾pounds show the same reduction potential value on the surface of a given
biosensor. In addition, other inorganic compounds or ions may have an
inhibitory effect on the enzyme used in the construction of the biosensor.
It was also observed that some results obtained by classical methods for
determining antioxidant activity or total antioxidant content differed from
those observed when electrochemical enzymatic biosensors were used. In
the classical spectrophotometric method, all antioxidant compounds are
computed in the final result, introducing interference with the results and
their interpretation. The biosensor is based on an enzyme reaction that
depends on the applied potential and gives results corresponding to the
“antioxidant fraction.” Therefore it is important and necessary to investigate
concomitant compounds in the biosensor response, as well as other anti￾oxidant compounds. Finally, the use of electrochemical enzymatic biosen￾sors represents an alternative or complementary method for the
determination of a specific antioxidant in beverages, which is very promis￾ing for use in industries, such as quality control, benefiting the general
population. This trend in the use of biosensors is due to their selectivity,
stability, and sensitivity in determining a wide range of antioxidants and
other compounds in complex matrices. In addition, they present low cost,
can be miniaturized/automated, and allow rapid continuous monitoring.

10.1 Introduction
Nanotechnology is the nanoscale phenomena applied in the field of science
and engineering where materials at a nanoscale are utilized to design, char￾acterize, and produce the desired structures for making devices and systems.
Nanotechnology is the most promising technological field for the various
research fields. Nanoparticles (NPs) are utilized as antioxidants and antire￾flectants cosmetics and sunscreens industries. NPs are engineered through
physicochemical and biological routes to use for commercial applications.
These NPs can attach firmly to the surface, so that causing health issues and
the risk of detachment are lesser. NPs have found broad applications in
commercial products right from personal care products to paints. The haz￾ardous effects of other NPs present in consumer products are unknown and
are still under research.
Nanostructured materials (NMs) have a microstructure that is characterized
in terms of length scale of the range of a few nanometers (110 nm)
(Boverhof et al., 2015). The properties of NM change compared to single
crystals/coarse-grained polycrystals with the same chemical composition. This
deviation is due to the fact that there will be a reduced size/dimension of
NM (Boverhof et al., 2015). The prominence of NM in the development of
technology is due to their enhanced physicochemical and biological properties
compared to that of bulk materials (Marques et al., 2021). The development

minute amounts of toxins, pathogens, volatile compounds, and many organic
compounds in body fluids and in various environmental samples, which are in
turn use full in areas such as food processing, monitoring of diseases in
humans, detection of bioterrorism agents, and assessing effectiveness of reme￾diation process. In agriculture, using pesticides a variety of pests can be con￾trolled to increase the crop production and its efficiency. Biosensors are used
to estimate the pesticide contents in food samples to ensure the safety of food
consumption (Rani et al., 2021). Though, the over dose of pesticides in agri￾culture will damage the environment as well as consumers’ health due to the
high pesticide residues in food (Sikora et al., 2020). The harmful pesticide resi￾dues left out in the surrounding environment or the use of polluted food
causes severe health issues especially irritation of eye or skin, problems
on neurodegenerative diseases, and reproduction and even leads to cancer
(Nahhal & El-Nahhal, 2021). For instance, in humans, most common pesti￾cides are organophosphates and carbamates, which hinder the enzyme acetyl￾cholinesterase, which is accountable for many biological and chemical
reactions (Pope et al., 2005). The most common techniques used to detect
these pollutants in the low concentration levels are high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spec￾trometry (Aquino et al., 2020, 2010). These conventional routes have several
limitations such as requiring costly equipment, pretreatment operations, and
highly skilled professionals. A sensor can be used as an alternative to find the
presence of an analyte in a sample and estimate the amount of analyte. The
sensor comprises a detection system called a receptor, a transducer, and a
reader (Walcarius et al., 2013). The intention of utilizing nanomaterials in the
biosensors is to enhance the stabilization of electrochemical biosensors, thereby
augment the sensitivity, catalysis process, and required low potentials, and help
to transfer the electrons rapidly from the active center to the surface of the
electrode in nanostructured electrochemical biosensors (Zhu et al., 2020;
Zhang et al., 2020; Alam et al., 2020; Zhang & Mousavi, 2020).
In this framework, biosensors can be utilized as a possible alternative
for sensing the amount of pesticides in the food contents which are low￾cost and highly efficient devices (Zamora-Sequeira et al., 2019). Biosensor
is a device composed of bioreceptor (biological component) and trans￾ducer (detector). The function of the bioreceptor is to identify the target
analytes and the transducer detects the component and in turn converts
into a measurable signal. The types of biosensors being used are tissue￾based, DNA biosensors, enzyme-based, thermal biosensors, piezoelectric
196 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsbiosensors, and immunosensors. Electrochemical biosensors are defined as
the type of biosensors that utilize an electrochemical transducer to carry
out their functions. In today’s world, various electrochemical biosensors
are developed for sensing the pesticide and insecticide levels. These elec￾trochemical biosensors are extremely sensitive, quick, valid, and easy to
employ. An overview of conventional methods developed for the diagno￾sis of pesticides has been discussed. The chapter describes the detection of
some common pesticides present in food and environment samples such
as malathion, chlorpyrifos, parathion, carbaryl, and paraoxon using elec￾trochemical biosensors. An electrochemical biosensor is employed to
detect the two most commonly used vegetable crop insecticides such as
methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos, which are described in detail.
High-performance electrochemical biosensors have been designed by
using nanomaterials due to their large surface to volume ratio and excel￾lent electrical properties. The importance of nanostructures in the electro￾chemical biosensors is to fill the gap between the converter and the
bioreceptor, which is at the nanorange. The nanostructures have been
employed to develop an electrochemical biosensor, which provides sealing
between the converter and bioreceptor at the nanoscale dimension. The
promising electrochemical biosensors have developed using carbon nano￾tubes (CNTs) as a base material due to their high resistance (Reta et al.,
2018). In addition, CNTs reveal the excellent properties such as chemical
stability and conductivity, high sensitivity, good biocompatibility, and
easy function with any desired chemical samples (Gupta et al., 2018).
Nanostructure metal oxide (Zn, Cu, Ni, Ti, and Fe)-based sensors are
advantageous due to their low range of limit of detection, wide linearity,
reproducibility, and stability. Copper oxide (CuO) nanomaterials are
advantageous in terms of their accurate surface area, magnificent electro￾chemical activity, and the capacity to stimulate electron transfer reactions
at low potential values (Pushpanjali et al., 2020; Prinith & Manjunatha,
2020; Raril & Manjunatha, 2018; Balliamada Monnappa et al., 2019).
Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructured materials are attractive due to their
high electrical conductivity, nontoxicity, cost-effectiveness, and chemical
steadiness properties (Pushpanjali et al., 2020; Edwin et al., 2021).
Electrochemical biosensors are classified as catalytic and propulsion types
based on the nature of the biomaterial detection process. The general
electrochemical sensor techniques are potentiometric analysis, chronome￾try measurement, voltammetry, impedance measurement, and field effect
transistor (FET) (Hareesha et al., 2021).
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for pesticides and insecticides 197This chapter provides an extensive structure of the efficient NM
electrochemical biosensors useful for pesticide identification and
detection in food matrices and insecticide levels. The NM utilized to
develop the electrochemical biosensors will be thoroughly deliberated.
The shortcomings of the developed electrochemical biosensors to sense
the pesticide and the future scope afford us with a broad route map for
the probable future.
10.2 Properties of nanostructured electrochemical
biosensors
The properties of nanostructured electrochemical biosensors are as follows:
• Rapid detection.
• Accurate measurement.
• Easy to operate.
• Low response time.
• High sensitivity and reliability.
• Proper functional materials for the electrode.
10.3 Fabrication of nanostructured electrochemical
biosensors
Till now, remarkable studies have been carried out in the electrochemical
sensor field and the sensors developed are extensively commercialized and
found extensive applications in many industrial, clinical, and agricultural
fields (Bukkitgar et al., 2020). Fig. 10.1 depicts the fabrication of
Figure 10.1 Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors.
198 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsnanostructured electrochemical biosensors. The fabrication of electro￾chemical biosensors requires the essential elements, which are electrodes
that serve various purposes such as aptamers and target recognition and
binding. It also acts as a carrier to convert biological signals into electrical
signals. The most used electrochemical biosensors among many electrodes
are the disk electrodes (DE) and screen-printed carbon electrodes
(SPCEs). The advancement in the field of NM, sensing electrodes are
modified by increasing the number of nanocomposites such as multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), metal nanoparticles (MNPs), graphitized
MWCNTs, Au nanoparticles, or glass carbon electrodes that are adopted
to it (Kazemi & Khajeh, 2011). Also, the spongy carbon nanospheres,
multifunctionalized composites of graphene (Naderi Asrami et al., 2018),
nanoribbon-structured reduced graphene oxide with a covalent organic
framework (Jiménez-Rodríguez et al., 2021), and carbon nanofiber-gold
nanoparticles (CNFs-AuNPs) (Shetti et al., 2019) are used. These nano￾composites are useful to amplify the electrochemical signals and improve
the sensing performance due to a larger surface to volume ratio, extremely
good conductivity, and improvisation of the aptamer biocompatibility.
10.4 Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors fabricated
for the detection of pesticides and insecticides
Electrochemical biosensors fabricated using nanostructured materials are of
much importance owing to their small size, transportability, quick mea￾surements, and small sample size. The most commonly found insecticides
are organophosphates (OPs), which are the esters of phosphoric acid, indi￾cated by a general formula O P(OR)3. They are called a class of syn￾thesized chemicals that are developed to kill insects. These are widely
utilized worldwide for agricultural fields and residential purposes including
gardens (Huang et al., 2021). The OPPs are extremely toxic to insects
and animals including amphibians, birds, and mammals. In agriculture,
OPPs are well received ascribed to their broad-spectrum effect, high effi￾ciency, and proper persistence. Generally, there will be meticulous inhala￾tion and ingestion of OPPs seen when someone is exposed continuously
to polluted soil, water, and food. Carbamates are known as esters of N￾methyl carbamic acid, which are normally employed as insecticides. Some
derivatives of carbamic acid such as thiocarbamide acid and dithiocarbamic
acid are used as herbicides. In agriculture, there exist more than fifty
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for pesticides and insecticides 199chemical compounds identified as carbamates that are used as insecticides
(Gholipour et al., 2020). A major concern for many countries is the
amount of pesticide residues in food and environmental samples. Accurate
detection of pesticides in food samples and environment is very important
to avoid viable hazards to organisms to prevent human health complica￾tions. The pesticides that are responsible for severe pollution in water and
food are malathion, profenofos, phorate, isocarbophos, omethoate, etc.
Biosensors have been developing as a latest area to detect and provide
high-sensitive immunosensors, higher specificity, and reproducibility to
the system. The basic structure of an electrochemical biosensor consists of
a transducer, a biorecognition element, and a signal amplifier. The trans￾ducer converts the chemical information into an electrical signal, the bior￾ecognition element selectively binds to the target analyte, and the signal
amplifier amplifies the signal for detection. The requisites of these biosen￾sors consist of systems with two or three electrodes (Yi et al., 2020).
When target material interacts with the recognition element, there will be
generation of the electrical signals (Jiao et al., 2017). These biosensors
have been recognized as the most attractive sensors for the detection of
pesticide. These are a widely used type of biosensors that make use of the
surface of the electrochemical transducers for the detection of analytes
in biological and nonbiological matrices. Some of the recent studies on
the development of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of pesti￾cides are tabulated in Table 10.1. In general, the principle of detection
includes the generation or consumption of electrons in a biological
reaction as reported in enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Yao et al., 2020).
Electrochemical biosensors can be categorized into two types such as
amperometric sensing, potentiometric sensing, and impedimetric sensing.
In the case of amperometric sensing methods, the sensing will be
performed based on the measurement of electrochemical oxidation and
current reduction where the current depends directly on the density
of electroactive species. Potentiometric sensing technique involves the
measurement of difference in potential (generally pH electrode or ion￾selective electrode). Impedimetric detection method involves the imped￾ance generation for measuring the resistance and capacitance values.
Electrochemical biosensors are extremely attractive and persistent biosen￾sors for many years and have continuously manifested substantial potenti￾ality over the years by giving an extent of advantageous properties such as
procedure involved in the measurement, short range of response time,
adequate sensitivity, and selectivity (Feagin et al., 2018).

29 nM (6.4 ppb) - Cui et al. (2019)There are many nanomaterials that have been known for their significant
applications in the detection of pesticides. Some of them are as follows:
1. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs): These materials have high surface area
and very good electrical conductivity, which benefits them as a good
sensing material. They can act as a functionalized material with specific
molecules that bind to pesticides and enable the detection of pesticides.
2. Nanoparticles: There are numerous types of nanoparticles, which
include Au, Ag, Mg, Fe, etc. used for pesticide detection. They can be
functionalized with specific ligands to detect specific pesticides.
3. Graphene: The high surface area and excellent electrical conductivity
of graphene useful for sensing applications can be bound well to pesti￾cides and helpful to detect various pesticides.
4. Quantum dots (QDs): QDs are semiconducting nanomaterials that
exhibit unique electrical and optical properties. The high sensitivity
and specificity make them a good candidate for pesticide detection.
5. Nanowires: Nanowires display a high aspect ratio and extremely
good electrical properties which are helpful in sensing applications.
6. Mesoporous silica: It has a higher surface to volume ratio and can
have the ability to functionalize with specific molecules for pesticides
detection.
7. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs): These are suitable for pesti￾cide detection applications, which have the ability to capture and
detect the levels of pesticides due to the high surface area.
The important element required for making electrochemical biosensors
is the electrodes, which perform various purposes such as recognition of
aptamers, aptamer binding, and targets and also employed as a carrier to
convert signals of biological information into electrical information.
Among all, disk electrodes (DEs) and screen-printed carbon electrodes
(SPCEs) are the most useful electrodes in electrochemical biosensors. The
development of nanomaterials made use of more and more nanocompo￾sites, which are being considered to reconstruct the electrodes for sensing
applications. They are metal nanoparticles, multiwalled carbon nanotubes,
modified graphene multiwalled carbon nanotubes, AuNPs/glass carbon
electrodes (Ehrich, 2005), porous carbon nanospheres, multifunctional
graphene composites (Gupta et al., 2011), reduced graphene oxide nanor￾ibbons with a covalent organic framework (Moon et al., 2018), and car￾bon nanofiber-gold nanoparticles (CNFs-AuNPs) (Uniyal & Sharma,
2018). These nanocomposites are being used to amplify electrochemical
signals and improve the sensing performance due to a larger surface area.
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for pesticides and insecticides 203This could also enhance conductivity and improve the biocompatibility of
the aptamer. Electrochemical biosensors based on the inhibition of AChE
(acetylcholinesterase) are attractive to detect pesticides. The AChE biosen￾sor was fabricated by Cui et al. by doping Au nanorods on the composite
material of mesoporous SiO2 and TiO2-chitosan gel which leads to the
enhancement of the electrical conductivity. Using this electrochemical
biosensor, the OPP was detected with the limit of detection of the two
pesticides such as dichlorvos and fenthion which were 5.3 and 1.3 nM,
respectively (Sassolas et al., 2012). AChE-based amperometric biosensor
was developed by Zhang et al. to detect the amount of trichlorfon and
malathion OPPs with the help of silver-rGO-NH2 nanocomposite. This
is conjugated by polymer 4, 7-di (furan-2-yl) benzo thiadiazole electro￾chemically. The limit of detection was estimated for malathion and tri￾chlorfon, respectively, as 0.032 and 0.001 μg L21
. This biosensor
exhibited higher conductivity, catalytic activity, good stability, and repro￾ducibility to inspect OPPs (Verma & Bhardwaj, 2015). Hou et al.
reported a SPE-based biosensor to detect OPPs in real samples that uti￾lized nanocomposites to stimulate the transfer of electrons such as meso￾porous carbon chitosan and antimony tin oxide-chitosan. Methamidophos
and chlorpyrifos were utilized as model OP compounds and limits of
detection were 0.01 and 1 μg L21
, respectively (Yi et al., 2020).
Furthermore, AChE-based biosensor was developed by incorporating
smart nanomaterials, 3D graphene, and copper oxide nanoflowers to
make available high aspect ratio and slow down AChE loading. It was
observed that there was a remarkable pesticide detection displaying good
stability and selectivity with a detection limit as less as 0.92 pM (Jiao
et al., 2017). In order to detect malathion in the food matrix, an ultrasen￾sitive fluorescent method was set up by Bala et al. by designing a nanop￾robe consisting of quantum dots (QDs) to assemble FRET-based QD
sensors, quencher (N-(3-guanidinopropyl) methacrylamide, PGPMA), and
an aptamer as a recognition element (Yao et al., 2020). The presence of
malathion revealed the quenching effect of fluorescence of the
CdTe@CdS quantum dots by the target-aptamer complex. This method
resulted in an excellent sensitivity and the successful malathion detection
with a limit of detection as 4 pM, due to the remarkable properties of the
QDs (Feagin et al., 2018). Furthermore, the existence of malathion level
in food and soil was reported by the authors with a very low limit of
detection 0.5 pM, which was significantly lower compared to the other
methods, considering the malathion aptamer and silver nanoparticles as a
204 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsnanoprobe. In the presence of malathion, due to electrostatic interactions,
the disengaged cationic hexapeptide caused the AgNPs to aggregate, mak￾ing the system solution turn orange. Conversely, in the absence of mala￾thion, the aptamers would interact with the peptide to remain yellow
(Cui et al., 2019). One more sensor was developed for the analysis of mal￾athion contents based on a label-free aptamer using SERS. Nie et al. cus￾tomized Ag nanoparticles with positive spermine for the detection of
malathion, which could bind with the targets by absorbing the aptamer
considering the negative phosphate backbone. The results showed that
the presence of malathion leading to the absorption of the malathion￾aptamer complex on the AgNPs@Spermine exhibited the increased peak
intensity (Zhang et al., 2019). An electrochemical aptasensor was used to
detect another type of organophosphate chlorpyrifos. In this method,
electrode was fabricated by Xu et al. using copper oxide nanoflowers
(CuO NFs) and carboxyl-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube
(c-SWCNT) nanocomposite to increase the surface area of the electrode
to enhance the performance of sensing. The assessment was done by
recording the reading of the change in the digital pulse voltammetry to
estimate chlorpyrifos. It was reported that the maximum current of meth￾ylene blue was reduced with an increase in the amount of chlorpyrifos
(Hou et al., 2019). For isocarbophos detection, Wang et al. developed a
dual-modal aptasensor, which is based on the AuNPs (Au nanoparticles)
including the effect of inner filtration between along with the inner filter
effect between persistent luminescence nanorods (PLNRs) and AuNPs. If
the isocarbophos is not present then inner filter effect between the conju￾gation of aptamer-AuNPs and PLNRs make to quench their phosphores￾cence and the presence of isocarbophos in the solution showed that the
AuNPs get aggregated, leading to decrease in the phosphorescence. The
developed sensor showed the superior sensor performance and selectivity
detection of isocarbophos with a lower limit of detection of 7.1 and
0.54 μg L21 in colorimetry and phosphorescence mode (Bao et al., 2019).
Some of the recently developed nanostructured electrochemical biosensors
for pesticides detection have been provided in Table 10.1.
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors are known to be a prom￾ising candidate for the detection of pesticides and insecticides. These
biosensors utilize nanostructured materials, such as carbon nanotubes,
graphene, and metal nanoparticles, to enhance the sensitivity and selec￾tivity of the sensor. In the case of pesticide and insecticide detection, the
biorecognition element is typically an enzyme that is specific to the
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for pesticides and insecticides 205target analyte. When the target analyte binds to the enzyme, an electro￾chemical signal is generated, which can be measured and quantified.
There are many ways to improve the performance of the electrochemi￾cal biosensors using nanostructured materials. Surface area can be
increased by using nanostructured materials which act as a good candi￾date for binding the biorecognition element to increase the sensor
sensitivity. The kinetics of electron transfer can be increased between
the biorecognition element and the transducer to enhance the selectivity
and response time of the sensor. Finally, one can understand that the
nanostructured electrochemical biosensors are a promising technology
to detect pesticides and insecticides owing to their good selectivity,
high sensitivity, specificity, and quick response time. These sensors are
potential candidates for improving the food safety and environment
monitoring by providing a quick and precise technique for the detection
of harmful chemicals.
Some of examples of the nanostructured electrochemical biosensors
for the detection of pesticides are as follows:
1. Graphene-based electrochemical biosensors utilize graphene as a base
material for detecting different pesticides. Organophosphate pesticides
present in fruits and vegetables can be detected by using graphene and
gold nanoparticle-based biosensors.
2. Carbon nanotube (CNT) electrochemical biosensors use CNT as a
sensing element for pesticides detection. Multiwalled CNTs have been
developed to detect pesticides carbamate present in the food samples.
3. Metal oxide electrochemical biosensors employ a sensing element as a
metal oxide nanoparticle for detecting pesticides. ZnO nanoparticles
based biosensors are useful in detecting organophosphate pesticides
present in the food matrix.
4. Quantum dot (QD) electrochemical biosensors are used to detect pes￾ticides using quantum nanodots as sensing material. CdS quantum dot￾based biosensors are helpful to detect carbamate pesticides.
5. Magnetic nanoparticle electrochemical biosensors can be employed to
detect pesticides utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as sensing elements.
Iron oxide nanoparticles exhibit magnetic properties and have benefi￾cial effects in detecting organophosphates present in food samples.
6. Apart from these, many nanostructured electrochemical biosensors
have been fabricated to detect pesticides. Every biosensor has its
unique properties, which are advantageous and limitations as well. The
applications of these electrochemical biosensors depend on the specific
application and the target pesticide.
206 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications10.5 Applications of nanostructured electrochemical
biosensors
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors are of interest to integrate phys￾ics, engineering sciences, chemistry, and biology. The performance of the
sensors such as the sensitivity, efficiency, and response time can be increased
by utilizing nanostructures in the development of electrochemical biosen￾sors. Nanostructured materials are synthesized and applied in electrochemi￾cal biosensors for food safety, medical diagnostics, environment protection,
and treatment of wastewater. These electrochemical biosensors are also
utilized for monitoring various biological target species such as proteins,
glucose, DNA bases, peptides, cell-based chips, and viruses.
10.6 Importance of electrochemical biosensors
• The electrochemical biosensors signify a potential tool for measurement
of real-time data which includes clinical diagnostics and food technology.
• Electrochemical biosensors are embedded with a high surface to vol￾ume ratio owing to smaller size of the nanoparticles, which can lead to
high sensitivity.
• These sensors are known to exhibit excellent electrical or optical prop￾erties. These can be utilized as the extraordinarily sensitive transducers
in biosensors.
• Other important aspects of electrochemical biosensors are their excellent
limit of detection, strength, easy miniaturization, and capacity to be used
in turbid biofluids with optical absorption and fluorescent compounds.
10.7 Challenges
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors are developed to enhance the
selectivity, specificity, and rate of pesticide detection, although there are
many challenges that need to be addressed for development and imple￾mentation of these biosensors for various applications.
Achieving high specificity is one of the major challenges in pesticide
detection. It is important that biosensors should be designed to detect spe￾cific pesticides without interfering with the other chemicals present in the
sample. The complexity of the sample matrix and the probable cross￾reaction with other substrates makes it difficult. Sensitivity is another chal￾lenge to achieve for the target pesticide. The detection limit of the sensor
must be smaller than the maximum reduction limit set by monitoring
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for pesticides and insecticides 207agencies. Achieving high sensitivity would be challenging owing to lower
pesticide concentrations in the environment. The biosensors that have been
developed should maintain their stability and performance over time to
make reliable and accurate measurements. Stability can get affected by cer￾tain factors such as sample matrix, electrode fouling, and environmental
conditions. Reproducibility is one of the important challenges because the
biosensors developed must give consistent results across various samples and
users. The optimization of the biosensors is required in terms of designing
and fabrication process. Biosensors must be integrated with material synthe￾sis techniques and analysis of the data to furnish a complete analytical solu￾tion. This needs collaboration among the experts in chemistry, biology, and
engineering. Ultimately, the developed biosensors must be cost-effective.
There are many electrochemical biosensors available for the detection of
pesticides such as Au Nps polypyrrole nanowires, ZrO NPs-modified
screen-printed electrodes, MWCNT GCE, and Au-MWNT-modified GC
electrodes, etc. The drawback of using these mentioned electrodes is the
leakage of enzymes into the electrode and process of pretreatment. Overall,
the nanostructured electrochemical biosensors developed for pesticide
detection need a multidisciplinary approach and considering the specific
challenges in the detection of pesticides.
10.8 Future scope
This chapter describes the current advancement to design and apply electro￾chemical biosensors for pesticide and insecticide detection in the food
matrix. Also, it emphasizes briefly the fundamental idea of different electro￾chemical biosensors, which have been developed to detect food contamina￾tion. Nanostructured electrochemical biosensor devices could be used for
pesticide detection with more accuracy owing to their high aspect ratio,
highly stable, and extremely good contact between the biocatalysts.
Magnetically bioconjugated nanomaterials have also been used. CNT can
be used for chemical and biological sensing applications. They are hollow
graphitic tubes. They have a faster rate of electron transfer and also possess
electrocatalytic effect. FeO are unique because of their magnetic and electric
properties and can therefore be used in pesticide detection.
10.9 Conclusion
Nanomaterials are of great interest due to their unique electrical, chemi￾cal, and physical properties. Initially, we have provided a broad overview
208 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationson organophosphate pesticides and its detection by using various nanos￾tructured electrochemical biosensors. The method of detection affords a
significant reference for monitoring food safety. We have discussed it
successfully. The nanostructured electrochemical biosensors have been
utilized significantly for pesticide detection in food samples owing to their
fast response time, high sensitivity, and low cost. Furthermore, the appli￾cations of different nanomaterials with surface modifications have been
reported for enhancing the sensitivity of the electrochemical biosensors
for pesticide detection. In nanostructured electrochemical biosensors, vari￾ous nanomaterials are used in different electrochemical techniques for the
detection of pesticides and insecticides. The most commonly used electro￾chemical techniques in sensor technology are potentiometry, corona
amperometry, voltammetry, impedance measurement, and FET. The
designing/engineering of the electrode surface plays a vital role in sensor
efficiency in terms of decomposition. In nanostructured electrochemical
biosensors, metal nanoparticles improve the receptor surface area and thus
enhance the sensor sensitivity. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic effect of
metal nanoparticles aids the quick transfer of electrons. This rapid transfer
of electrons minimizes the response time and maximizes the efficiency of
the electrochemical sensor. AChE-based biosensors have been developed
using carbon nanomaterials such as CNTs and graphene. Using these, one
can observe that the biosensors have responded well for the detection of
pesticides, primarily because two nanostructured electrode materials are
used to transduce the signal to mediate current flow. Most of the existing
limitations of the nanostructured electrochemical biosensors could be
directly related to the selectivity in multicomposite mixtures and complex
matrices and the inability of identifying a specific pesticide. Simultaneous
use of the nanostructures and electrochemical techniques made it advanta￾geous to develop the sensors with high sensitivity and decomposition
power. Apart from the advantages of electrochemical biosensors, some of
the issues to be considered about the detection of analytes, there will be a
chance of leakage of the sample on the electrode surface.

11.1 Introduction
Since the recent century, with the continual improvement of dyeing and
printing industrialization processing, huge amounts of dyes are discharged
into the environment. Dyes and pigments are fundamental per diem
chemical matters and are widely utilized in different industries to color
their products like paper, leather, printing, textiles, rubber, plastics, print￾ing, dye manufacturing, pulps, wood, food, cosmetic, pesticides, pharma￾ceuticals, etc. (Hareesha, Manjunatha, Amrutha, Pushpanjali, et al., 2021;
Sriram et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2019).
Dye molecules and their metabolites in environmental matrix and
food chain cause carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and teratogenicity dys￾function of human beings’ liver, kidney, brain, central nervous, and repro￾ductive systems (Zhou et al., 2019). Thus, there is a requirement to
advance novel and selective analytical methodologies for the effective
determination of toxic dyes (Manjunatha, 2019).
Different analytical methods for the determination of toxic dyes have been
noticed in the literature, particularly UV-vis spectrophotometry, liquid chroma￾tography (LC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chroma￾tography (GC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), capillary electrophoresis,
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), immunoassay techniques such
as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and some methods based on
mass spectrometry such as laser desorption/ionization (LDI)-Ms, real-time
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-TOF-Ms), matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI), liquid microjunction surface sampling probe
mass spectrometry (LMJ-SSP Ms), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spec￾trometry (TOF-SIMS) (Hareesha, Manjunatha, Amrutha, Sreeharsha, et al.,
2021; Pushpanjali et al., 2020; Shahid et al., 2019). Among these techniques,

All rights reserved.spectrophotometric groups have been generally employed for the routine
quantitative detection of dyes. These techniques involve different spectrophoto￾metric analytical methods such as the H - point standard addition method,
derivative spectrophotometry, and cloud point extraction method (Vladislavic´
et al., 2018). In recent years, electroanalytical methods appear to be very
encouraging due to their great simplicity, short response time, sensitivity, selec￾tivity, low operating costs, and ability to simultaneously detect many different
analytes at the same time (Prinith & Manjunatha, 2020).
Biosensors and chemical sensors are recognized as trustworthy and
generally transportable apparatus for quick and cost-effective detection
of analyte species that have wide range from metal ions to inorganic
and organic compounds, proteins, pollutants, antigens, viruses, fungi,
bacteria, deoxyribonucleic acids, and others. So biosensors are utilized
in different areas like pharmacy, medicine, drug development, food
industry, crime detection, quality control, environmental analysis, etc.,
thanks to their unique properties. “Biosensors” are electroanalytical
appliances similar to chemical sensors, nevertheless incorporating bio￾logical molecules for accurate and rapid determination of target species
(Sanati et al., 2019; Zare-Shehneh et al., 2021). In this way, we have
reviewed the recent studies in detecting toxic dyes using electrochemi￾cal biosensors by focusing on the biosensor architecture, selected elec￾trochemical method, linearity range, selectivity, sensitivity, and their
application areas.
11.2 Dyes and pigments
Dyes and pigments are extensively utilized as colorant components in dif￾ferent industrial and production activities such as plastic, textile, leather,
printing, paper, rubber, tannery, cosmetics, and food sectors (Ozturk &
Silah, 2020). In some cases, the nonaqueous or aqueous solutions of dyes
are eventually discharged into various water sources and generate undesir￾able colored and unpleasant odors in wastewater, causing environmental
pollution. The colored wastewater has poor light absorption capability so
these waters cause delayed photosynthesis in various herbs. In addition,
these polluted waters are inconvenient and extremely disgusting for per￾forming assorted human activities (Hassan et al., 2015). Taking into con￾sideration both the volume of water discharged and the contaminant
content, the wastewater composed by the textile industry is categorized as
the most polluting among all industrial lines. Consequently, it is
216 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationscompulsory for scientists to discover ways for accomplishing the matters
related to industrial water effluents loaded with dye pollutants (Hayat
et al., 2022).
Dyes are generally classified into two classes, such as synthetic and nat￾ural dyes. The natural dyes are pricey and are typically extracted from nat￾ural sources like plants, minerals, animals, fruits, and so on. Additionally,
they are not deleterious to the environment. In comparison, synthetic
dyes have taken more caution in many industries because of their ease and
convenience of synthesis, low cost, and wide range of colors. But, syn￾thetic dye molecules are extremely toxic (Sriram et al., 2022). Synthetic
organic dyes and pigments are the major class of all coloring matters, and
it is predicted that more than 100,000 synthetic organic dyes are existing
commercially worldwide in a universal manufacturing volume of over
1,000,000 tons annually. The enormous amount of dyes manufactured
and their extensive-ranging implementation areas form a great volume of
colored wastewater and various kinds of postproduction contaminants and
waste. Especially, the textile sectors are significant resource of water pollu￾tants: throughout diverse dyeing operations, dye wastage is between 5%
and 50%, depending on the kind of dye and fabric. Because of all these
reasons, nearly 200 billion liters of colored effluents are created annually
(Tkaczyk et al., 2020).
Also, there are two primary dye classification systems in the literature
where one is based on their chromogen groups involving diphenyl￾methane, acridine, azo, anthraquinone, azine, indigoid, oxazine, methine,
nitroso, nitro, phthalocyanine, triphenylmethane, thiazine, and xanthene
dyes and the others are based on their implementation objectives (includ￾ing basic, acid, direct, fiber, disperse, reactive, mordan, and vat dyes)
(Tkaczyk et al., 2020).
Some synthetic azo dyes, particularly those coexisted with some other
drugs or azo dyes, have mutagenic effects and may have important poten￾tial of genotoxicity. Azo dyes are more mutagenic after the breakage of
the azo bonds by azoreductase enzymes, which are synthesized in the
intestinal cells, which outcomes in colorless aromatic amine compounds
(Rocha et al., 2016). So these dyes cause some health problems such as
widespread digestive disorders involving gastroesophageal reflux disease,
irritable bowel syndrome, cancer, hiatal hernia, lactose intolerance, urti￾caria, diarrhea, angioedema, and also some allergic symptoms such as nasal
congestion, rhinitis, itching, bronchial asthma symptoms, dizziness, head￾aches, etc. (Vladislavic et al., 2018 ´ ).
Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 217Food colorants are separated into two groups, synthetic and natural.
Natural colorants are ensured from colorful plants and animals in the
nature. But since natural colorants are unstable to alterations in preserva￾tion situations such as pH, temperature, humidity, and light, they break
down readily when subjugated to changes in preservation conditions
(Tabanlıgil Calam & Ta¸skın Çakıcı, 2023). Synthetic dyes have been
commonly applied, especially in the food sectors for nearly 40 years
because of their expressive usefulness such as greater stability, bright color,
lower cost, and an extensive range of tones compared with natural color￾ants. One of the most common synthetic colorants is the azo dye group
which constitutes approximately 70% of synthetic colorants. Tartrazine,
furthermore called as Food Yellow 4, Acid Yellow 23, and E102, is an
azo dye in lemon yellow color utilized for color jams, confectionery, ice
cream, jellies, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, and other similar foods
(George et al., 2023).
Monitoring ultratrace or trace amounts of toxic dyes in various foods,
natural, environmental, biological, clinical, and other real samples is very
considerable, because the exposure of these dyes can cause toxicosis,
affecting first the liver and then the central nervous system, eyes, kidneys,
and skin (Manjunatha, 2018).
Dye molecules are primarily formed of two key components. One of
these is auxochromes that involve many functional groups like -OH,
-SO3H, -COOH, and -NH3, which not only acquaint the chromophore
group but also improves the fiber affinity for color and reduce the water
solubility either by removing or donating electrons. The second is chromo￾phores which occurred from atomic groups and involve diverse functional
groups such as carbonyl (-C 5 O), nitro (-NO2), and azo (-N 5 N-), and
these chromophore groups are principally accountable for dyeing the fabric
(Sharma et al., 2021). So dyes and their metabolites are complicated organic
matters with auxochromic and chromophore groups, which can be electro￾chemically reduced or/and oxidized; this causes the base of their electro￾chemical determination.
11.3 Electrochemical biosensors
Electrochemistry is a considerable qualitative and quantitative analysis method
for analyzing assorted biochemical molecules, like metabolites, proteins, neu￾rotransmitters, electrolytes, drugs, pesticides, phenols, dyes, heavy metals, and
so on, pointing spacious implementations in public health, personal health,
218 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsfood safety, clinical diagnosis, industrial applications, and environment analysis
(He et al., 2023). Electrochemical biosensing systems submit myriad superior￾ities, involving straightforward fabrication, cost-effectiveness, sensitivity, selec￾tivity, portability, low power necessities, and compatibility for in situ analysis
(Prinith, n.d; Hara & Singh, 2021).
Biosensors and chemical sensors based upon microelectromechanical
system technologies have been improved to sit in for costly and compli￾cated analytical appliances in various fields with compact and broadly
employed sensors proposed for healthcare, environmental, and industrial
applications (Arakawa et al., 2022). Biosensors have a purpose for robust
and innovative analytical appliances, including biological sensing elements
called bioreceptors, with an extensive range of implementations, like bio￾medicine, diagnosis, drug discovery, food processing and safety, environ￾mental control and monitoring, defense industry, and security (Vigneshvar
et al., 2016). Especially, environmental control and monitoring is one of
the most significant applications wherein biosensor technologies are neces￾sary for speedy recognition of contaminants and their residues to avoid
health ventures (Vigneshvar et al., 2016).
The term “sensor” has its origin from the Latin word “sentire” which pri￾marily means “to identify” anything (Ali et al., 2017). Sensors are generally
classified into diversified groups depending on the physical quantity (sub￾stance) or analyte to be survived, like (1) energy source (passive and active
sensors), (2) physical contact (noncontact and contact), (3) comparability (rela￾tive or absolute sensors), (4) digital or analog sensors, and (5) signal determi￾nation (chemical, physical, biological, and thermal) (Naresh & Lee, 2021).
Biosensors are electrical apparatus that measure biological or biochemi￾cal signals and transform them into electrical signals. A biosensor is an
electroanalytical appliance that detects or determines the existence of an
analyte species in the sample medium of interest (Chadha et al., 2022).
Since biosensors were acquainted in 1962 by Leland C. Clark Jr.,
known as the father of biosensors, the improvement of electrochemical
biosensors has taken much notice from investigators; therefore investiga￾tions on electroanalytical biosensors have incremented in the last three
decades. The capability of electrochemical biosensors to grant a charming
replacement for pricey and cumbersome analytical apparatus induced
investigators to discover the area thanks to experimental and theoretical
studies, involving other kinds of biosensors, such as magnetic, thermomet￾ric, optical, piezoelectric, and combinations of more than one kind.
Electrochemical biosensors own other superiority over other kinds of
Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 219biosensors. One of the most significant is the capability to actuate at ambi￾ent temperatures without an exterior heating system, which supposes very
low to no power for totally self-powered electrochemical biosensors
(Abdulbari & Basheer, 2017).
The electronic supplementary determines, records, and transfers
knowledge concerning a physiological alteration or the existence of
assorted biological or chemical species in the environment. Biosensors are
developed in various sizes and shapes and can determine and measure
even low amounts of particular chemicals such as drugs, pesticides, food
additives, dyes, phenols, microorganisms, bacteria, pathogens, and different
toxic chemicals (Naresh & Lee, 2021). The main components of biosen￾sors are their bioreceptor (bioelement), transducer, and electrical circuit,
which are displayed in Fig. 11.1. A biological recognition element or
bioreceptor is a biological asset such as enzymes, aptamers, hormone
receptors, cells, tissues, antibodies, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that
reacts peculiarly with the analyte species to generate a measurable signal.
A transducer is an apparatus that transforms energy from one form to
another (Chadha et al., 2022).

220 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsAn ideal biosensor must have some features such as: (1) the bioreceptor
employed in the construction of the sensor must be devoted fully to the
aimed analytical objective. (2) The selected biocatalyst has high stability at
experimental conditions. (3) The biological reactions must be uncommit￾ted of alterations in experimental conditions like temperature, pH, etc. (4)
The response of the developed electrochemical sensor must be correct,
accurate, repeatable, and also have a wide analytical concentration range.
(5) The biosensor must ensure a fast and momentary response (Zare￾Shehneh et al., 2021).
The electrochemical biosensors are a private kind of biosensors where
a biological species or biological reactions are determined by transforming
the knowledge into the electrical signal, for example, current, voltage,
impedance, conductivity, resistance, etc. (Singh et al., 2021). The elec￾trode material is the most significant component of an electrochemical
biosensor as it controls the flow of bioagents and electrons. Different elec￾trochemical biosensor systems have been developed based on amperome￾try, voltammetry, impedimetry, and potentiometry (Singh et al., 2021).
Conventional electroanalytical sensing systems are formed of electrochem￾ical reaction cells, standard sensing electrodes, and bulky electrochemical
workstations, which suppose specialized staff, restricting their convenient
implementation, particularly in less advanced fields. Recently, with the
refinement of integrated circuits, printed electronics, and intercommunication
technologies, many wearable or transportable electrochemical sensing systems
with cost-effectiveness, small size, and easy operation have evolved.
Transportable electrochemical sensors generally are comprised of a reusable
electronics apparatus and a portable electrode. The electrodes can be changed
after the determination of analytes. Different analyte species could be deter￾mined by handling various electrodes with the same electronic apparatus.
Miniaturized electrochemical potential and impedance detection analog front
ends have been combined by utilizing D/A conversion chips, A/D conver￾sion chips, impedance analysis chips, operational amplifiers, and other circuit
moduli (He et al., 2023).
To improve highly efficient and competent biosensor systems, specific
static and dynamic requirements such as high sensitivity and selectivity,
wide linearity range, short response time, high precision and accuracy,
reproducibility, and stability are essential. The yield of the biosensor can
be developed for various trading applications (Naresh & Lee, 2021). The
primary approach in contravention of the electrochemical biosensors is to
augment the conductivity of the electrode surface to achieving high
Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 221electron transference between the analytes and the electrode surface. For
this reason, it is indispensable to employ conductive materials in the con￾struction of electrochemical biosensors (Khanmohammadi et al., 2020).
In electrochemical biosensor systems, immobilization of molecular or
ionic identification probes is the most important step to maintain the bio￾activity and to control the inducement and conformation of biomolecules.
The degree of holding biomolecules in their active forms will directly
influence both the reproducibility and stability of the developed biosensor.
Some molecules such as proteins and enzymes directly retained via
adsorption on an unmodified (bare) electrode such as gold, platinum, or
carbon are tended to denature, leading to fouling of the electrode surface.
So a covalent attachment on various functional groups or a polymer
matrix was generally exploited as the entrapment reagent. Different bio￾logical molecules (e.g., DNA, enzyme, cell, and antibody) can be immo￾bilized on the active surface of the electrode via various immobilization
methods such as direct adsorption, covalent attachment, layer-by-layer
assembly, and intercalation (Li et al., 2011).
Affinity-based biosensor systems are imitating a native biological
occurrence, using the interactions of the target analyte species with a bio￾logical recognition element (bioreceptors) like antibodies, proteins, apta￾mers, and synthetic DNAs, or molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs).
The ensuing interaction will be carried to a signal by linking to a trans￾ducer. These sensors subscribe to a diversity of determination implementa￾tions involving especially diagnosis of noninfectious and infectious
diseases, cancers, etc. (Sanati et al., 2019).
Electrochemical investigation of DNAsmall molecule interactions
has lately taken great notice because of the utilization of simpler, low￾cost, and smaller appliances with respect to spectroscopic techniques.
Moreover, the explication of electrochemical information can subscribe to
clarification of the mechanism by which DNA is interacted with small
molecules like drugs and dyes in an approach to the real behavior that
occurs in living cells in vivo (Heli et al., 2004).
DNA is a concerning biomaterial that, has lately drawn much notice due
to its ability to bind small ligand molecules with high specificity and affinity.
The small molecules interact with DNA by covalent bonds (chemical modifi￾cation of different DNA constituents) and reversible noncovalent bonds
(groove binding, electrostatic, and intercalation) (Rezaei et al., 2016).
Electrodes covered with a film of DNA polymers, which are called
DNA-modified electrodes, generally in a solution/film/substrate layout,
222 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationshave been utilized in the researches on DNAsmall molecule interactions,
accumulation of trace analyte molecules involving dyes, drugs, pesticides,
food additives, and potential contaminants (Heli et al., 2004).
Among the diverse kinds of electrochemical sensors, impedimetric immu￾nosensors present a group that merits private attention. These sensors can be
highly sensitive and selective, because of the specificity of antibodyantigen
interactions, and their application in integration with the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method makes possible the progress of label￾free assays. Genesis of the immunocomplex alters the impedance reply of the
system, compared to the reply previous to the immunoaffinity reaction,
ensuring the basis of the electroanalytical methodology and removing the
usage of indirect measurements. This process provisions the electrochemical
sensor as more straightforward and inexpensive because the assay requests
fewer steps. Additionally, the EIS technique is a nondestructive method that
consents to consecutive measurements to be made handling the same elec￾trode (Rocha et al., 2016).
Nucleic acids present analytical techniques as a vigorous tool in the
identification and monitoring of many different considerable compounds
and other species. Ions and molecules interact with DNA in three remark￾ably distinct ways involving groove binding, electrostatic, and intercala￾tion. These interactions alter the structure of DNA and its base sequence,
causing perturbation of DNA replication. Among them, electrostatic
interactions are generally nonspecific and involve binding along the exte￾rior of the double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) helix. Groove-binding inter￾actions include direct interaction of the molecule or ion with the edges of
the base pairs in the minor or major channels of ds-DNA, expanding to
fit over many base pairs. They have a very superior sequence specificity.
In intercalation, another type of DNAmolecule interaction process
includes attaching planar or almost planar aromatic ring systems between
the base pairs, reasoning separation, and unwinding of base pairs. The
structure of the electrochemical DNA biosensors is based on the immobi￾lization of the nucleic identification layer over an electrochemical trans￾ducer. The alterations in the DNA structure in the course of intercalation
with DNA-binding molecules are determined by nucleic acid identifica￾tion (Ensafi et al., 2012).
In genosensors, the bioreceptor (recognition element) is a group of
nucleic acids, which are unbranched polymers that comprised four single
units called nucleotides. These units include three components, that is,
sugar, phosphate, and nitrogen-containing nucleobases. The nucleotide
Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 223groups are different in the sequence of their bases. Usually, nucleic acids
are classified into two primary categories, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The difference between DNA and RNA
monomers gets from the difference between their sugars where DNAs
contain deoxyribose sugar and RNAs have ribose sugars. Also, DNA
includes guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), and cytosine (C),
whereas, in RNA molecules, the uracil (U) base has been replaced by thy￾mine base (Khanmohammadi et al., 2020).
Enzyme-based biosensors, one of the most widely developed electro￾chemical sensors, employ enzymes as a biorecognition element (biorecep￾tors), and the analysis of the sample is based on the inhibition of
enzymatic activity (Munteanu & Apetrei, 2022). Enzyme-based biosensors
own different benefits, with the inclusion of high sensitivity, specificity,
availability, selectivity, and diversification of functions, and are classified as
either indirect or direct mode. In direct mode, the enzymatic biosensor
analyzes target analyte concentration or product genesis during enzymatic
reactions. But, in indirect mode, biosensors determine enzyme inhibition
because of contact with the target analyte (Hara & Singh, 2021). In this
process, after the enzyme inhibition molecule is exposed to a particular
inhibitor for a definite duration of time, qualitative and quantitative deter￾minations of the analyte species are carried out by analyzing the correla￾tion between the enzyme inhibition rate and that of the inhibitor
concentration (Munteanu & Apetrei, 2022).
Enzyme-linked biosensor systems have some supremacies apper￾tained to the nature of the enzyme used. Enzymes are highly selective
for a specific substrate molecule, and for a large number of substrate
molecules, biological reactions can be catalyzed by a solo enzyme
molecule, ensuing in a magnification of the impact and an increment
in sensitivity. The enzymes generally used in designing biosensors
belong to the hydrolase, oxidoreductase, or lyase groups (Munteanu
& Apetrei, 2022).
Antibodies are protein molecules generated by the immune system
and include antigen-recognition sites, which connect to their specific
related antigens by noncovalent interactions with relatively high affinity.
The interaction of antigenantibody is the most considerable event in
immunosensor systems. Among various kinds of immunosensors, elec￾trochemical immunosensors are sensitive, specific, and can present real￾time determination of plural targets in an automated sample platform
(Sanati et al., 2019).
224 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications11.4 Determination of toxic dyes based on electrochemical
biosensors and their applications
Electrochemical biosensors have been employed for toxic dyes due to
their superiorities such as perfect sensitivity with very low detection limits,
rapid analysis times, simultaneous detection of several analytes, etc.
Selected determination methods of toxic dyes using electrochemical bio￾sensors are given in Table 11.1.
Recently, researchers have investigated the practicality of biological
methods to determine the existence of several dyes in various sample
matrices. Biological matters such as proteins and enzymes, in addition to
several crosslinking reactions, have prosperously shown a meaningful and
trustworthy detectability of dyes (Okeke et al., 2022).
Among the several types of electrochemical sensors, impedimetric
immunosensors stand out as highly selective methods due to the specificity
of antigenantibody interactions. Moreover, the use of these methods
together with the EIS technique allows the development of more eco￾nomical and simple label-free assay methods (Magar et al., 2021).
In their study, Rocha and coworkers designed and characterized a label￾free impedimetric immunosensor for the detection of the textile azo dye
Disperse Red 1 (Dr1) in treated water samples. As shown in Fig. 11.2, a glassy
carbon electrode (GCE) was polished with alumina powder and washed with
ethanol and water, respectively, and dried completely. Then, GCE was sub￾jected to electrooxidation process (11.5 V for 15 s) in a solution containing
nitric acid and potassium dichromate to form carboxylic groups on the GCE
surface. Immediately after rinsing the electrode, the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylami￾nopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide solution was incubated. In the
next step, anti-Dr1 antibodies (Ab anti-Dr1) were incubated using Ab anti-Dr1
solution to the electrode surface and the electrode dipped in phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound weakly bound antibody molecules.
The surface was incubated with ethanolamine and dipped in PBS so that the
prepared immunosensor was ready to interact with the Dr1 dye. This process
was carried out to block the activated carboxylic groups on the surface. As the
immunosensor surface was incubated with increasing Dr1 concentration, a cali￾bration curve was established according to the changing RCT values of Fe
(CN)6
32/42 depending on the reaction between antigen and antibody. After
characterization studies using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS methods, a lin￾ear range of 8.40100 nM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.52 nM was
achieved with increasing Dr1 concentration under optimal conditions.

was assessed, and an acceptable recovery of 98.5% was obtained (Rocha et al.,
2016).
Carbon paste electrodes are widely used in electrode preparation and sensor
applications in electrochemistry studies (Amrutha et al., 2019; Raril and
Manjunath, 2018). In another study, Manjunatha prepared a biosensor based
on a poly(glycine)-modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) and investigated the
determination of indigo carmine (IC) by both CV and differential pulse vol￾tammetry (DPV). In this study, the design of the biosensor was based on coat￾ing the bare CPE surface with a poly(glycine) film. For this purpose, the bare
electrode surface was immersed in PBS (pH 5.7) containing glycine, and 10
cycles of CV were applied at a potential range of 5001800 mV at
100 mV s21
. The number of cycles for electropolymerization, the effect of dif￾ferent pH, scan rate, and concentration were optimized. The results demon￾strated that, under optimum conditions, biosensor exhibited extraordinary
electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of IC. The developed sensor showed
remarkable electroanalytical performance in the linear ranges
(23 1026
13 1025 M) and (1.5 3 1025
63 1025 M) with a LOD of
11 3 1028 M. Moreover, real sample applications of the developed sensor
using indigotindisulfonate injection demonstrated the applicability of the sensor
with satisfactory recovery values (Manjunatha, 2018).
In their study, Yang and coworkers developed a simple label-free
impedimetric immunosensor design for the determination of the textile

Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 229dye Disperse Orange 1. To form amino groups on the surface of the
working electrode, the bare electrode was immersed in 1,12-diaminodo￾decane (DADD) and 1,7-diaminoheptane (DAH) solutions, respectively,
and the surface was modified by the CV technique. The obtained mono￾layer film layer by using these two diaminoalkanes of different lengths
provided the appropriate surface for efficient immobilization of the anti￾body in the next step (Fig. 11.3). In this study, the effect of scan rate on
modifying DADD and DAH on the electrode surface and the effect of
the dilution of antibody and Disperse Orange 1 were both investigated to
enhance the performance of the developed immunosensor. Under optimal
conditions, the linear range for the Disperse Orange 1 was found to be
linear in the range of 5.0 nmol L21 to 0.5 μmol L21 with LOD of 7.56

230 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssuch as large specific surface area and high conductivity. In recent studies,
nanomaterials have been generally utilized as modifiers for constructing
electrochemical sensors and biosensor systems employed for environmental,
clinical, industrial, and pharmaceutical analyzes (Uslu, n.d.). In particular,
metal-based nanomaterials are frequently preferred materials to improve the
catalytic performance of sensors (Bozal-Palabiyik et al., 2021). In their
study, Zhu and coworkers developed a sensitive immunosensor based on
cobalt hydroxide and gold nanoparticles (Co(OH)2Au NPs)-modified
electrode for the determination of rhodamine B. When the surface of the
bare electrode was coated with Co(OH)2Au NPs, the impedance value
of the modified electrode increased compared to the bare electrode. While
this increase was due to the fact that Co(OH)2 is a poorly conductive mate￾rial, it can significantly increase the specific surface area of the electrode.
Moreover, when Co(OH)2 and Au NPs were used combined, the conduc￾tivity increased significantly. These increases indicated that in the next step,
antigen and antibody molecules can be successfully immobilized on the
electrode surface. After the nanomaterial-modified electrode was immobi￾lized with blocking reagent, antibody and rhodamine B, respectively, anti￾gen concentration, dilution factor for antibody, the interaction rate of
cerium oxide used as signal amplification with the antibody, and the reac￾tion time of antibody and rhodamine B were optimized. Under optimal
conditions, the developed immunosensor exhibited a linear range of
0.0110000 ng mL21 with LOD of 0.89 pg mL21
. In addition, the devel￾oped immunosensor was successfully used for the determination of rhoda￾mine B in red pepper and capsicol samples (Zhu et al., 2022).
One of the most important factors in the preparation of biosensors is
the choice of biorecognition elements that directly affect the selectivity of
the biosensor. As protein catalysts that accelerate biochemical reactions,
enzymes are of great interest due to their superior catalytic properties
(Kurbanoglu et al., 2020). In 2017, for the first time, a biosensor developed
for the determination of azo dye tartrazine in the study of Mazlan and cow￾orkers utilized the laccase enzyme, which is frequently used in the design of
biosensors for the determination of various phenolic substances. In this
study, the immobilization of enzyme on functionalized methacrylate￾acrylate microspheres and Au nanoparticles (Au NPs)-modified electrode
served as the design for the developed biosensor. The interaction reaction
between tartrazine and laccase can be catalyzed by the laccase, and the
DPV method was used to detect the current change. The obtained results
showed that the methacrylate-acrylate microspheres and Au NPs-modified
Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 231electrode increased the efficiency of the electrode surface reaction for tartra￾zine detection. After optimizing the experimental conditions, the anodic
peak current showed linearity in the range of 0.214 μM with LOD of
0.04 μM versus increasing tartrazine concentration. In addition, tartrazine
content in candy coated with chocolate and mango juice samples was suc￾cessfully determined using the developed biosensor (Mazlan et al., 2017).
In another study, the laccase-based electrochemical enzyme biosensor was
developed by Rozi and coworkers for the determination of Sunset Yellow. In
this study, first of all, the surface of the working electrode was modified with a
poly(acrylamide-co-ethyl methacrylate) (poly(AAm-co-EMA)) membrane using
a one-step photopolymerization technique to enable more efficient immobili￾zation of laccase. For the electrochemical behavior of the developed biosensor,
the bare working electrode, poly(AAm-co-EMA)-modified electrode, and
laccase-modified electrodes were investigated by the CV method. While there
were no oxidation or reduction peaks in the bare and poly(AAm-co-EMA)-
modified electrodes in the buffer solution containing Sunset Yellow, both oxi￾dation and reduction peak currents were observed in the laccase-modified elec￾trode. These results showed that the developed biosensor showed significantly
improved performance for Sunset Yellow determination. In order to determine
the optimum conditions for the developed biosensor, different pH values, lac￾case enzyme loading, accumulation time, and stability were evaluated. When
the DPV responses were examined, with increasing Sunset Yellow concentra￾tion, the current responses of the developed biosensor showed linearity
between 0.08 and 10.00 μM with a LOD of 0.02 μM. In addition, the
amount of Sunset Yellow in soft drink samples was successfully determined
using the developed biosensor (Rozi et al., 2018).
Biosensors, in which nucleic acids are used as biorecognition elements,
provide high stability, easy preparation, and the formation of surfaces
suitable for reuse. Unlike antibodies and enzymes, biosensors modified with
DNA sequences shorten the detection time and simplify the detection
method (S. Kurbanoglu et al., 2016). In their study, Ensafi and coworkers
prepared a ds-DNA-based biosensor and evaluated the determination of
chrysoidine in food and textile wastes based on the interaction between chry￾soidine and ds-DNA. In this study, the interaction mechanism between chry￾soidine and ds-DNA was investigated by monitoring the oxidation currents
of both DNA’s electroactive bases guanine and adenine and chrysoidine in
DPV. First, the surface of the activated bare pencil graphite electrode (PGE)
was modified using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-poly(diallyl￾dimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) for more efficient immobilization of
232 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsds-DNA molecules to the surface. Next, the modified surface was incubated
with ds-DNA for use in the detection of the chrysoidine as shown in
Fig. 11.4A. Morphological examination of the prepared electrode surfaces
was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In Fig. 11.4B, the
graphite layers of the bare working electrode are clearly visible, while SEM
images of the MWCNTs-PDDA (Fig. 11.4B)-modified surface showed a
homogeneous coating. The obtained changed SEM image after incubation of
the modified surface with ds-DNA also confirmed the immobilization of ds￾DNAs to the surface. In addition, electrochemical characterization results
using EIS also showed the accuracy of the preparation steps of the biosensor
(Fig. 11.4C). In general, the surface impedance decreased as a result of the
modification of the bare electrode with nanomaterials, while the impedance
value increased as expected as a result of incubation of the surface with ds￾DNA. After the optimum experimental conditions were determined, a linear
range of 0.0515.00 μg mL21 with LOD of 0.03 μg mL21 was obtained by
using the developed DNA-based biosensor for the determination of chrysoi￾dine. Moreover, using this biosensor, the chrysoidine content of ketchup
tomato sauce, chili tomato sauce, fish, and industrial waste samples could be
accurately determined (Ensafi et al., 2014).
The integration of biorecognition elements with synthetically pre￾pared MIP enables the preparation of more selective and sensitive
bioimprinted polymer-based sensors. In their study, Rezaei and cowor￾kers developed a DNA- and MIP-based bioimprinted sensor for Sudan
II determination using a one-step electropolymerization method. In this

Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 233study, a poly-(o-phenylenediamine)-based surface was obtained on the
electrode surface by CV technique using a mixture containing ds-DNA,
Au NPs, o-phenylenediamine, and Sudan II (Fig. 11.5A). While the sur￾face characterization of the bioimprinted polymer was successfully per￾formed by CV and EIS methods, the surface morphology was also
investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in
Fig. 11.5B and C, the roughness changes of AFM images of the treated
PGE and the bioimprinted polymer confirmed that the surface was suc￾cessfully coated. For the successful determination of Sudan II, the num￾ber of scan cycles for electropolymerization, the composition of MIP,
concentration of Sudan II, pH, incubation time, and removal time were
optimized. Linear ranges in the range of 1.020.0 nM and
20.0500.0 nM with LOD of 0.3 nM were obtained using square wave
voltammetry (SWV) under optimum experimental conditions.
Furthermore, the developed sensor has been successfully applied to the
determination of Sudan II in hot pepper and ketchup sauces with satis￾factory recovery values (90%107%) (Rezaei et al., 2016).
Aptamers, which have come to the fore as biorecognition elements in
recent years, are single-stranded oligonucleotide molecules (either DNA￾or RNA-based) that can bind to target molecules with high specificity
and affinity. Aptamers are simple to make and flexible enough to be mod￾ified with various chemical tags without losing their affinity. Due to their

234 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsseveral binding characteristics, aptamers provide a novel, quick, and effi￾cient platform for the detection of a broad range of target compounds
such as heavy metal ions, proteins, peptides, drugs, and small molecules
(Ravalli et al., 2016). In 2019, Wang and coworkers designed a label-free
electrochemical aptasensor for the sensitive and selective determination of
malachite green. This aptasensor design was based on modifying the bare
GCE surface with Au NPs, graphene quantum dots (GQDs), and tungsten
disulfide nanosheets (WS2). As shown in Fig. 11.6A, first, the GCE surface

50 mV s21 A. Source: From Wang, Q., Qin, X., Geng, L., & Wang, Y. (2019). Label-free

(2). https://doi.org/10.3390/nano9020229.
Electrochemical biosensing for determination of toxic dyes 235was modified with GQDs-WS2 and Au NPs, respectively. The modified
surface is then modified with aptamer and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH)
to prevent specific binding. In the last step, the aptasensor surface was
incubated with increasing concentrations of malachite green, and DPV
signals were followed. The prepared GQDs-WS2 surface exhibited super￾ior electrocatalytic properties for more efficient modification of Au NPs,
while the aptamers were more efficiently immobilized on the surface
covalently via AuS bonding when the surface was modified with Au
NPs. Results from EIS (Fig. 11.6B) and CV (Fig. 11.6C), which were
found in agreement with one another, showed that the developed apta￾sensor can be used successfully in the determination of malachite green.
Using this developed label-free electrochemical aptasensor, linearity was
achieved between increasing malachite green concentrations in the range
of 0.0110 μM and DPV responses. Also, the LOD value was found as
3.38 nM in fish samples (Wang et al., 2019).
11.5 Conclusion and future perspectives
It is a significant topic to determine dyes, pigments, and their metabolites
directly and accurately in environmental monitoring, food control, public,
and health all the time. But a deficiency of appropriate and efficient deter￾mination techniques makes it arduous to apply rapid in situ determination
of dyes in the sample matrix. Electrochemical sensors have extensive
implementation probabilities in environmental monitoring and other
areas. Despite remarkable improvement being made, there are certain lim￾itations and difficulties in the design of electrochemical sensors.
• Although electroanalytical biosensors are extremely sensitive, selective,
and low cost, there is yet a requirement to advance their electrochemical
performance. It is probable that search will proceed into the modification
of electrode surfaces with assorted nanoparticles, quantum dots, conduct￾ing polymers, nanomaterials, etc., with regard to the development of
selectivity, sensitivity, and the response of electrochemical biosensors.
• The sensitivity, selectivity, and stability of electrochemical sensors will be
cultivated by designing novel nanoelectrode compounds and materials.
The use of new advanced conductor and semiconductor nanomaterials
demonstrates well the electrochemical efficiency and high performance,
displaying encouraging potential for electrochemical sensors. So, recently,
investigators in the field of biosensors are studying the improvement of
236 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsnovel nanostructured nanocomposites, which ensure an appropriate mate￾rial for binding of biological sensing layers.
• Since the electrochemical biosensor systems have readily fabricated designs
for the detection of toxic dyes in the environmental, industrial, and food
matrices, commercializing them with low-cost methods is a significant topic
that must be taken into notice. Also, the implementation of the electro￾chemical biosensor systems in real sample areas such as textile wastewater
ponds for the determination of toxic dyes should be improved.
• Another significance that charms lots of researchers concerning the
exploitation of this special area for discovery is its versatility. Biosensor
technology is a multidisciplinary technology and includes the collabo￾rative endeavors of chemistry, engineering, biology, physics, microbi￾ology, biotechnology, electrical, electronics, and so on. As a result,
future developments in biosensors will be possible with the coopera￾tion of these branches of science.

12.1 Introduction
Food and water cleanliness are significant factors for the food industry.
Pathogenic microbes in water and food have the potential to cause serious
illnesses with both public health and economic consequences (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2019). With an increase in the eating of
fresh produce, ready-to-eat products, and fruits that have not been sub￾jected to an important bacteria-kill step, such as cooking, the risk of con￾suming foods containing infection pathogens has increased. Many disease￾causing microbes, such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses, present in water and
food endanger animal production and the supply of food, resulting in
severe economic inferences. Ingestion of insecure food products contami￾nated by viruses, bacteria, chemicals, or parasites causes foodborne illnesses
and is one of the main problems in public health worldwide, hindering
socioeconomic progress.
According to the World Health Organization, contaminated water
and food containing destructive parasites, bacteria, chemical substances, or
viruses cause over 200 infections ranging from diarrhea to cancer. Each
year, a predictable 600 million people fall ill after consuming contami￾nated food, and 420,000 deaths occur, resulting in a loss of 33 million
infirmity-adjusted life years (DALYs). Foodborne microbes are extremely
varied in nature and continue to cause the main public health issues
worldwide. As a result, food security is a critical problem for both

technological advancements, as well as economic development, have been
incapable of efficiently controlling the spread of foodborne illnesses,
which are on the rise (Lawrence, 2018).
Pathogen-caused foodborne illnesses are known to cause periodic
intestinal swelling, joint problems, mental retardation, impaired vision,
chronic kidney infections, and even death (Hoffmann et al., 2015).
Diseases caused by foodborne pathogens are classified into four types. The
first type is food poisoning, which refers to acute or subacute illnesses that
happen after consumption of food contaminated with toxic ingredients
(Inoue et al., 2018); the second type is hypersensitive illnesses related to
food (Hose et al., 2018); and the third type comprises infective illnesses
(dysentery) (Berhe et al., 2019). Without a doubt, foodborne illnesses
have become a worldwide public health issue that affects everybody.
Numerous water-based toxins can be fatal to fauna if inhaled.
Waterborne disorders, such as diarrhea, systemic illnesses, and gastrointes￾tinal, are worldwide problems that kill millions of people each year
(WHO, 2015). The most common waterborne pathogens are Vibrio choler￾ae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia
coli (Huang, Hsu et al., 2016; Huang, Liu et al., 2016). Pathogens in food
and water can pass through contaminated water and food. As a result, it is
critical to identify pathogens in water and food before they enter the
body and cause a severe outbreak (Chattaway et al., 2011). Such organ￾isms mainly include Acinetobacter spp., C. perfringens, Clostridium difficile,
Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter koseri, Citrobacter freundii, B.
cereus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Enterobacter
cloacae, E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Khan et al.,
2010).
Viruses are also accountable for a wide range of infections that kill
thousands of people every year (WHO, 2015), including influenza
(Bitton, 2014), Ebola (Zhao et al., 2014), Middle East respiratory syn￾drome (MERS) (Rhoden et al., 2021), HIV/AIDS (Alhamlan et al.,
2015), and more recently, coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19).
Recently, the global health and economic impact of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has intensified
focus on the essentials for low-cost viral disease finding and preparedness
for future outbreaks. Foodborne diseases caused by fungi, parasites, viruses,
or bacteria are spread through the consumption of contaminated water or
244 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsfood. Norovirus (58%), C. perfringens (10%), Campylobacter spp. (9%),
S. aureus (3%), and nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (11%) cause the majority
of illnesses. Nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. (35%), Norovirus (26%),
Campylobacter spp. (15%), Toxoplasma gondii (8%), and E. coli (STEC)
O157 (4%) were the important reasons for hospitalization. Campylobacter
spp. (6%), T. gondii (24%), norovirus (11%), nontyphoidal Salmonella
spp. (28%), and L. monocytogenes (19%) were the leading causes of death
(Scallan et al., 2011). Nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. accounted for 90% of
the total economic loss (Hoffmann et al., 2015).
Conventional and official techniques for the detection and identifica￾tion of disease-causing pathogens mainly rely on particular molecular and
cultural approaches. Using traditional microbiology and molecular biology
methods such as staining or microscopy, cell culture, PCR, membrane fil￾tration, Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA), and microarray
(Pashazadeh et al., 2017) increases the efficiency of pathogen detection in
food and water. Cultural methods are very effective and sensitive, but
they are expensive and time-consuming. Most of these techniques still
necessitate steps such as bacterial culture purification and enrichment. The
methods described above are considered reliable, but they have several
drawbacks, particularly in the bacterial context, such as the need to con￾centrate the bacteria through membrane filtration of huge amounts of
water, long lag times for progress (up to 72 hours), and the necessity for
skilled staff. There are currently some disadvantages to immunological
methods, such as time consumption process complications (56 days) and
incomplete information, specifically the inability to differentiate species
(Inbaraj & Chen, 2016). The conventional method is incapable of meet￾ing the demands of food safety management and rapid pathogen detection
(Cam & Oktem, 2019). As a result, there is still an essential need for fast,
low-cost discovery and identification methods with high sensitivity and
selectivity (Vidic et al., 2019). As a result of their high specificity and sen￾sitivity, nucleic acid-related methods based on deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) probes have become extensively established.
Demand for faster detection of food and waterborne pathogens con￾tinues to rise to prevent infectious diseases, ensure food safety, and protect
public health. Conjugated nanomaterials, integrating biological sensing
elements, and electronic signal transducers on a single platform have
acceptable diagnostic device advancements (Liu et al., 2019).
In recent years, investigators have made significant advances in patho￾gen detection using chromatography, mass spectrometry, fluorescence,
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 245and electrochemical approaches. Electrochemical methods, for example,
are among the most promising methods for detecting pathogens in a
highly sensitive, low-cost, and selective way (Hasan et al., 2018).
Electrochemical approaches have increased in popularity due to their ease
of fabrication, suitability for miniaturization and biomolecule incorpo￾ration, and, most importantly, their appropriateness for infield use by
unskilled operators. Electrochemical biosensors can operate as standalone
units that can be reduced in size, permitting direct measurement of liquid
media (Singh et al., 2016). Because of the direct transduction of definite
binding of targets to electrons without the requirement for photons, the
sensitivity of the electrochemical assessment is integrally greater than that
of most detection approaches (Grieshaber et al., 2008). Electrochemical
biosensors are at the forefront of analytical devices due to their specificity,
high sensitivity, and low manufacturing cost, and emerging devices for
observing microbes and pathogens in drinking water are extremely needed
(Wu & Ju, 2012).
As a result, recent research has concentrated on the alteration of elec￾trodes, the use of nanomaterials, and the incorporation of other
approaches to increase detection sensitivity. Electrochemical sensors are
made up of two major components: a transducer and a receptor. Many
biological elements, such as enzymes, phages, aptamers, whole cells, anti￾bodies, DNA, and receptors, are used in biosensors (Kurbanoglu et al.,
2020). Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) placed on the electrode
surface, on the other hand, serve as selective recognition units (Leibl
et al., 2021). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic vol￾tammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), linear sweep vol￾tammetry, square wave voltammetry (SWV), amperometry, alternating
current voltammetry, polarography, and conductometry are among the
electrochemical biosensor schemes used to detect pathogens.
Electrochemical sensing is typically carried out with two electrodes (refer￾ence and working electrodes) or three electrodes (reference, working
electrodes, and auxiliary) (Michael Immanuel Jesse et al., 2015).
Numerous working electrodes, including laser-induced graphene,
screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE), and microarray electrodes, have
been used to identify foodborne pathogens (Soares et al., 2020). Moreover,
the use of DNA and amplification reactions may increase the sensor's sensi￾tivity (Cai et al., 2021). Unlike voltammetric measurement, amperometric
detection includes measuring current at a constant voltage and recording
the current as a function of time (Amine & Mohammadi, 2019).
246 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsIn a two-electrode system, potentiometry sensors measure the possible
difference between the indicators and counter electrodes (Aragay &
Merkoçi, 2012).
Voltammetric techniques can be altered to include a step that precon￾centrates the target on the electrode surface (Manjunatha et al., 2010;
Manjunatha, 2020c). The preconcentrated target is then stripped from the
surface using an electrical potential. A negative potential is used in anodic
stripping voltammetry (ASV) to preconcentrate metal ions onto the elec￾trode surface.
Numerous electrode types used in electrochemical biosensors are
described below. Gold's unique properties (such as conductivity, stability,
and biocompatibility) have encouraged its use as an electrode in electro￾chemistry. The sensitivity and functionality of gold electrodes can be
improved by altering their surface with appropriate molecules and poly￾mers (Manjunatha, 2018). Furthermore, gold nanoparticles (NPs) were
used in the electrochemical biosensing field not only because of their high
conductivity and compatibility but also because of their high surface-to￾volume ratio (Xiao et al., 2020). Carbon has been identified as one of the
most widely used electrode materials in electrochemical biosensing.
Carbon paste, carbon nanotubes, glassy carbon, and graphene electrodes
are the most common forms of carbon used as electrodic materials; all of
these carbon materials are less expensive than noble metals. Carbon-based
electrodes have numerous advantages, including low background current,
low cost, regenerability, and a wide range of operating potentials.
Nevertheless, apart from their high price, glassy carbon electrodes require
a perfect pretreatment process, which constrains their use in many electro￾chemical uses (Curulli, 2021).
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit a variety of properties related to
their functionality, structure, morphology, and flexibility. They are cate￾gorized as single-walled nanotubes, double-walled nanotubes, and multi￾walled nanotubes based on the number of graphite layers (Charithra
et al., 2020; Manjunatha et al., 2020). Functionalized CNTs have been
used in a variety of applications (Hareesha et al., 2021; Manjunatha
Charithra & Manjunatha, 2020; Manjunatha, 2020b; Prinith et al., 2021;
Pushpanjali & Manjunatha, 2020; Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020a,b).
Chemical functionalities for biosensing applications can be easily consid￾ered and altered by modifying the tubular structure. Graphene is a widely
used nanomaterial in the sensing field. Many procedures have been used
to create various graphene-based materials (for example, electrochemically
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 247and chemically modified graphene) (Manjunatha, 2020b; Pumera, 2010;
Raril & Manjunatha, 2020).
Graphene has properties like high conductivity, which speeds up elec￾tron transfer, and a large surface area, which are much related to the cor￾responding properties of CNTS, so it is a good applicant for collecting
sensors to detect multiple target particles. Screen printing technology pro￾vides numerous benefits for electrochemical biosensor assembly, compris￾ing an extensive variety of geometries, disposability, portability, and mass
production (Smart et al., 2020). These characteristics are critical for com￾mercializing biosensors by analyzing the choice of support material, ink
composition, and methods of surface alteration or functionalization
(Hughes et al., 2016).
12.2 Label-based electrochemical detection
Enzymes and NPs are commonly used as labels for electrochemical detec￾tion (Siangproh et al., 2011). Enzymes are typically used to catalyze a
reaction that results in the formation of an electroactive product or the
deposition of particles on an electrode surface, resulting in variations in
electrical parameters. The ability to amplify the signal is one of the most
significant benefits of using labels in electrochemical findings. When very
low concentrations of bacterial cells are bound to the electrode surface, a
signal amplification step is usually required. By conjugating nanomaterials
to antibodies, they can be used as labels to bind target bacteria on the
electrode surface. The acceleration in electrical resistance that results can
then be calculated. Enzyme labels for electrochemical discovery were usu￾ally added to a sample's intercellular matrix.
Label-free electrochemical methods depend on the direct detection of
electrical property variations caused by a biochemical response on an elec￾trode surface (Daniels & Pourmand, 2007). The immobilization of media￾tors and conductive materials on the electrode surface is required for
electrochemical detection.
Because bio-recognition elements such as phages and antibodies are
frequently essential to be fixed onto an electrode surface, the protein
immobilization process is critical to the progress of both label-based and
label-free electrochemical biosensors. Adsorption, covalent binding,
entrapment, and molecular linkers can all be used to immobilize proteins
on a sensor surface (Kim & Herr, 2013). When developing enzyme-based
detection, the number of proteins that can be immobilized on electrodes
248 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsmust be considered. Immobilization techniques should be stable and
maintain enzyme activity after the procedure. A common method for
providing the most stable immobilization is the development of covalent
bonds among the functional groups of protein and the electrode surface
(Wong et al., 2009).
Redox cycling is an important signal amplification technique in the
improvement of electrochemical discovery to attain ultrasensitive findings.
Enzyme labels can help with signal amplification, but they are not contin￾uous enough to detect low concentrations of bacteria. To overcome this
issue, numerous methods of signal enhancement, such as enzymatic ampli￾fication and redox cycling, may be required. Likewise, electrochemical
biosensors (potentiometric, amperometric, impedimetric, and conducto￾metric) use voltage, current, capacitance, or impedance measurements to
detect receptor target binding, which changes the biochemical response
into a determinate electrical signal. Impedance biosensors use biomolecule
connections with a conductive or semiconducting transducer surface to
measure the resultant current (Knopf & Bassi, 2018). Electrochemical,
optical (UV, fluorescence, bioluminescence, etc.), micromechanical trans￾ducers, thermometric, piezoelectric, and magnetic are the most commonly
used signals.
Potentiometry, conductometry, and EIS are used by electrochemical
sensors to detect the analyte of interest. Electrochemical sensing has
become popular due to its incorporation into point-of-care testing
(Kaushik et al., 2021). Furthermore, the incorporation of various nanoma￾terials with rapid sensitivity, specific detection response, miniaturization,
and integration capabilities, such as CNTs, metal oxide, silica NPs, and
metallic NPs, into point-of-care testing (Mahari & Gandhi, 2022).
Furthermore, when compared to CNTs, silica NPs, metallic NPs, and
metal oxide sensors with only molecular probes, antibodies, or peptides,
the use of different NPs, such as organic NPs, increases the discovery limit
(Naresh & Lee, 2021).
12.3 Electrochemical detection of microorganisms
Pathogens are disease-causing microbes that play an important role in the
health of animals, humans, and plants, food safety, and ecological toxicity.
Early findings of these microbes can save lives and resources, as well as
pave the way for better disease control policies in a variety of industries
(Sun et al., 2021). Biological water contamination is caused by living
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 249microbes such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and algae and is
typically caused by contaminated water and poor hygiene practices.
Throughout their growth, these microbes can release toxins and other
harmful materials into their extracellular surroundings (Razmi et al.,
2020), contaminating food and water materials and leading to a diversity
of foodborne and waterborne infections. Foodborne pathogens not only
endanger people's lives and health, but they also cause enormous financial
losses (Bosch et al., 2018). As a result, food safety has become an increas￾ingly important issue (Zhang, Zhou, Du, 2019; Zhang, Zhu, He et al.,
2019). Food poisoning, allergic diseases, and infectious diseases are some
of the health issues caused by foodborne pathogens (Sun et al., 2021).
Bacteria are single-cell prokaryotic organisms with a wide range of
shapes. Soil, air, water, and other biological species are among their habi￾tats. They reproduce asexually through binary division, which explains
their rapid propagation in infections (Gupta, 2000). Bacterial infections
are one of the foremost causes of death worldwide; nevertheless, develop￾ing fast, cost-effective, and reliable pathogen detection approaches remains
difficult. Due to their increasing competitive sensitivity, electrochemical
sensing techniques have improved care in recent years for the discovery of
pathogenic bacteria.
12.3.1 Electrochemical detection of Escherichia coli
In most cases, the contagion is developed through the fecal-oral route by
consuming contaminated and raw food, such as various leaf vegetables,
unpasteurized milk, beef, and water. It should be noted that E. coli-related
food/waterborne diseases are among the leading causes of illness in many
developing countries (Kim et al., 2013), causing gastroenteritis and other
diseases with dire consequences (Kaper et al., 2004). Humans are more
likely to become infected with E. coli after drinking contaminated water
or eating underripe fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, a person with
poor cleanliness may become diseased through human transmission or by
consuming feces-contaminated food (Guo et al., 2019). As a result,
detecting E. coli in our diet is critical for our health.
E. coli is one of the most common bacteria related to foodborne and
waterborne illnesses. The need to deal with outbreaks, such as a spinach￾activating event, prompted scientists to create analytical tools (Linman
et al., 2010). The approaches have concentrated on identifying elements
of the bacterial surface. Aptamers and antibodies were used in the
250 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsmethods to achieve immobilization on NPs. Microfluidic device with a
coplanar waveguide for discriminating between live and heat-killed E. coli
cells in culture media using microwave signals with frequencies ranging
from 0.5 to 20 GHz. Researchers have developed a centrifugal microflui￾dic automatic wireless endpoint-finding method combined with LAMP
that can perform 30 reactions at the same time (Sayad et al., 2018).
Similar studies have used the LAMP method to evaluate microfluidic
devices (Trinh et al., 2019). Using gram-positive B. subtilis and E. coli as
reference pathogens, Yeung et al. (2006) defined the design and imple￾mentation of a multipathogen microdevice for microorganism monitoring.
Cesewski and Johnson (2020) evaluated some biosensors based on EAT
for the discovery of E. coli and other pathogens. Amperometry with a
graphene-based FET was used to identify E. coli in nutrient broth diluted
with phosphate-buffered saline solution (Wu et al., 2016). Pandey et al.
(2017) created an immune electrode using graphene-wrapped copper (II)-
assisted cysteine hierarchical structure (rGO-CysCu), which established
that E. coli O157:H7 cells could be distinguished from nonpathogenic
E. coli and other bacterial cells. Huang, Liu et al. (2016) and Huang, Hsu
et al. (2016) established a simple, label-free, and low-cost electrochemical
biosensor based on rolling circle amplification (RCA) and peroxidase
mimicking DNA enzyme amplification for extremely sensitive findings of
E. coli. Xu and colleagues studied the progress in developing electrochem￾ical biosensors for the fast detection of E. coli, explaining the several bio￾sensor configurations and sensing methods (Xu et al., 2017).
One of the most capable approaches for the quick and dependable
finding of pathogenic bacteria is the electrochemical genosensor (Abdalhai
et al., 2014). A gold electrode was used to immobilize complementary
DNA on a SAM, which was then hybridized with an exact fragment of
the pathogen gene to form a sandwich structure. The MWCNT embed￾ded in chitosan with a bismuth layer adapted a GCE for sensor perfor￾mance discovery. Chen et al. (2014) discovered E. coli at a LOD of 13
CFU mL21 using stripping voltammetry with a polymer-CNT compos￾ite-based electrode. There are several reports of electrochemical biosensors
for finding E. coli in foodborne pathogens (Zhang et al., 2018). He et al.
(2012) established that by using Pt and Ag/AgCl gate electrodes, FETs
based on PEDOT:PSS organic electrochemical transistor electrodes
enabled the finding of E. coli in KCl solutions.
In DPV detection, the biocomposite was used to capture E. coli
O157:H7 and methylene blue (MB) as electrochemical indicators
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 251(Zhang, Zhou, Du, 2019; Zhang, Zhu, He et al., 2019). Arora et al.
(2007) reported an electrochemical DNA biosensor for E. coli detection.
Arreguin-Campos et al. (2021) proposed using MIP/(diamine functiona￾lized polyurethane-urea)/aluminum chip a stimulating label-free E. coli
determination with EIS and the heat transfer method, a developing food
examination technique. Huang, Liu et al. (2016) and Huang, Hsu et al.
(2016) created a label-free electrochemical biosensor based on a novel 3D
Ag nanoflower. When E. coli O157:H7 was taken by the biosensor, the Fe
(CN)6
32/42 was used as a redox probe to notice resistance changes.
12.3.2 Electrochemical detection of Salmonella spp
Salmonella is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium with over 2650 sero￾types (Kipper et al., 2019), the most dangerous of which are Salmonella
typhimurium and Salmonella paratyphi A. The most common Salmonella
serotype that can cause systemic infection is S. typhimurium (Pandey et al.,
2014). Salmonella spp. is one of the most common causes of foodborne ill￾ness and a public health concern. Salmonella infection can be fatal in
young children (especially those below the age of 5), the elderly, and peo￾ple with compromised immune systems (Scallan et al., 2011). The two
most common causes of human contagions are Salmonella enteritidis and S.
typhimurium. Although the definitive culture media method is the gold
standard testing technique, it is time-consuming and requires 25 days to
confirm an analysis. Numerous researchers have focused on meat, dairy,
vegetable, and beverage cultures. Efforts were made to develop a com￾bined microfluidic sensor that produced detailed results through image
examination using a smartphone application (Zhang, Zhou, Du, 2019;
Zhang, Zhu, He et al., 2019).
In milk, a micronanotechnology technique was used (Papadakis et al.,
2018). After a preenrichment stage, this acoustic biosensor captured cells
using magnetic beads and antibodies.
For the finding of S. enteritidis, a pathogen assessment system based on
microfluidics and a simple film was obtainable (Park, 2018). Dong et al.
(2013) reported an electrochemical impedance immunosensor for the detec￾tion of S. typhimurium in milk samples. The fluorescence could be quanti￾fied using a smartphone app. The biosensor had a revealing limit of 58
CFU mL21 and a dynamic range of 1.4 3 102 to 1.4 3 106 CFU mL21
.
Antibodies immobilized on magnetic beads were used in another method
of findings (Vinayaka et al., 2019). A detection limit of 2 CFU mL21
was
252 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsfound in a range of samples comprising egg yolk, vegetable salad, minced
pork meat egg white, and whole egg. Wang et al. (2019) reported an online
Salmonella detection process. To increase specificity, the device concentrated
bacteria with immune magnetic NPs. The immune fluorescent microspheres
were used to label the magnetic bacteria, resulting fluorescence emission.
Muhammad-Tahir and Alocilja (2003) identified an electrochemical sand￾wich immunoassay as well as a reader for signal measurement. Kuang et al.
(2013) described a fluorescent probe based on QDs antibodies for
Salmonella detection with a sensitivity of 500 CFU mL21
. Using two
monoclonal antibodies that recognize Salmonella surface epitopes, they cre￾ated antibody-coated magnetic NPs and QDs-antibody conjugates.
12.3.3 Electrochemical detection of Listeria monocytogenes
L. monocytogenes, an opportunistic foodborne pathogen, is commonly
found in ready-to-eat foods like milk, seafood, and heat-treated meat pro￾ducts (Vizzini et al., 2019). One of the most common food pathogens is
L. monocytogenes. Pregnant women, the elderly, immunocompromised
people, and neonates are more likely to contract the infection. L. monocy￾togenes has the potential to cause septicemia, abortion, stillbirth, meningo￾encephalitis, and meningitis, placing human health in danger (Liu et al.,
2018). For the first time, Saini et al. (2020) described an electrochemical
DNA biosensor based on the plcA gene (a virulent gene) for L. monocyto￾genes discovery using CV and EIS. Long et al. (2011) recommended a
technique for identifying the hly gene in L. monocytogenes that combined
HRCA (hyper 260 branching RCA) with a magnetic bead-based electro￾chemical method.
Chemburu et al. (2005) suggested biosensors out of greatly detached
carbon particles that could detect L. monocytogenes using antibodies
immobilized on stimulated carbon particles labeled with HRP￾conjugated antibodies. Colorimetric biosensor strips made of peptides
immobilized on a gold chip were also described to detect L. monocytogenes
in milk and meat samples with an LOD of 2.17 3 102 CFU mL21
(Alhogail et al., 2016).
The immobilizing HRP antibody against L. monocytogenes onto the
surface carbon nanotube fibers created an amperometric immunosensor
with a LOD of 1.07 3 102 CFU mL21 (Lu et al., 2016). The Gomes
group established an advanced Listeria aptasensor using platinum￾interdigitated microelectrodes (Sidhu et al., 2020). Chiriacò et al. (2018)
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 253created a miniaturized biochip with an array of interdigitated antibodies
and functionalized electrodes for L. monocytogenes detection in medical
and on-site settings. Wang et al. (2017) used urease-modified AuNPs to
amplify the signal of impedance biosensors applied with magnetic NPs for
the finding of L. monocytogenes in microfluidic impedance sensors made of
different IDAM materials. Sun et al. (2012) defined electrochemical DNA
biosensors made from GR and nanogold using electrodeposition methods
to create Au/GR nanocomposite film-modified CILE. Gao et al. (2010)
defined the electrochemical indicator toluidine blue for DNA electro￾chemical biosensors with diverse redox behavior on dsDNA and ssDNA￾altered electrodes. Yang et al. (2017) tested magnetic beads to detect L.
monocytogenes using the ECL detection technique in 269 other latest
descriptions. Zhu et al. (2015) suggested a magnetic nanocarrier made of
Fe3O4/Vancomycin (Van)/PEG for effective sample enrichment and in
situ nucleic acid preparation of pathogenic L. monocytogenes for following
gene sensing. Sitkov et al. (2022) used the microfluidic impedance of ITO
interdigitated array microelectrodes to detect Listeria. Wu et al. (2010)
described a new hybridization biosensor for the electrochemical discovery
of LLO toxin gene PCR amplification products in food and the pathogen
without labeling the target DNA.
12.3.4 Electrochemical detection of Vibrio spp
Vibrio spp. is a genus of gram-negative bacteria found in numerous aqua￾cultures and marine habitations; these are the most common and severe
pathogens in shellfish and fish aquaculture around the world (Chatterjee
& Haldar, 2012). Around 12 species of Vibrio spp. cause human conta￾gions, which can be separated into cholera (by V. cholerae) and noncholera
Vibrio infections (by V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, and V. vulnificus)
(Baker-Austin et al., 2018). Numerous species, including V. vulnificus,
Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio anguillarum, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, and
Vibrio salmonicida, affect mass death and vibriosis (contagion of skin and
other organs) in cultured fishes (Ina-Salwany et al., 2019). V. cholerae is
the pathogen accountable for human cholera, which is an older and more
prevalent epidemic infection. Numerous epidemics around the world
have been caused by V. cholerae, which is characterized by diarrhea, water
loss, severe vomiting, and high death rates (Huang et al., 2013). As a
result, it is included in international quarantine classifications of communi￾cable illnesses. Cholera is accountable for 21,000143,000 deaths and
254 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications1.34.0 million cases globally each year (Ali et al., 2015). The techniques
were tested on seafood, meat, dairy products, and bacterial cultures.
Sharma et al. (2006) described the first V. cholerae electrochemical bio￾sensor based on disposable SPE to adsorb V. cholerae polyclonal antibodies
(PAb). To capture the targets, a one-step label-free biosensor for V. choler￾ae finding was established by means of antibodies covalently immobilized
on a CeO2 nanowire-modified microelectrode. Zhao et al. (2007) devel￾oped a screen-printed graphite-based electrode for electrochemical detec￾tion of V. parahaemolyticus. Teng et al. (2017) reported an electrochemical
sensor based on an antibody aptamer for the ultrasensitive discovery of V.
parahaemolyticus. Laczka et al. (2014) described an analogous amperometric
biosensor for the discovery of V. cholerae using a biotinylated PAb immo￾bilized on a neutral vidine-altered surface of SPE. Park et al. (2017) devel￾oped a collective system that included a rotary microfluidic method
suitable for the extraction of DNA, LAMP, and a colorimetric lateral flow
strip.
12.3.5 Electrochemical detection of Streptococcus spp
Streptococcus spp., compared to other bacteria, is a main cause of human
and veterinary illness and death worldwide. Streptococcus detection using
biosensors has been suggested for water and milk samples. Magnetically
labeled specific peptides and antibodies improved specificity (Duarte et al.,
2016). The detection encompassed SPR (Bouguelia et al., 2013), an
impedance array (Lillehoj et al., 2014), a cytometer, and an electrical sen￾sor. Streptococcus mutans electrochemical detection was achieved using
printed circuit board (PCB) electrodes (Dutta et al., 2019). The thiolated
primary antibody was immobilized to the electrode surface in this novel
PCB-based electrochemical biosensor, and bacteria detection was accom￾plished using EIS. Ferreira et al. (2018) used electro polymerization to
modify the graphite electrode surface. DPV analysis was used to track the
current responses of EB in the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae
(Ferreira et al., 2018). Khan et al. (2018) used to optimize the detection
limit and response time for the finding of bacterial species within a single
sensor chip.
12.3.6 Electrochemical detection of Bacillus spp
Bacillus species come into contact with humans and can cause food poi￾soning (Nwaru & Virtanen, 2017). Many foods, particularly improperly
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 255refrigerated left-overs, can cause this type of diarrhea (Xie & Zhou,
2018). B. cereus causes vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which are
very similar to C. perfringens indications (Wang et al., 2017). As a result,
the emergence of a correct discovery technique for B. cereus in our food is
quite significant. Hu et al. (2014) termed an electrochemical DNA bio￾sensor to study B. subtilis 16SrDNA using a target-induced strand displace￾ment mechanism and nicking endonuclease signal amplification. Yeung
et al. (2006) described the design and implementation of a multipathogen
microdevice for the monitoring of microorganisms, using gram-positive
B. subtilis and E. coli as reference pathogens.
Raveendran et al. (2016) described a sensitive electrochemical DNA bio￾sensor for finding pathogenic Bacillus anthracis. Based on EIS measurements,
Andrade et al. (2015) developed a detection assay using CNTs and clavanin
A to identify Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, B. subtilis, and E. coli.
Velusamy et al. (2011) described an electrochemical DNA biosensor for the
detection of B. cereus DNA. To immobilize DNA, the gold electrode surface
was altered with polypyrrole, and then an immobile potential of 0.8 V was
applied for 600 seconds to improve immobilization efficacy and constancy.
Kang et al. (2013) defined an electrochemical immunosensor for B. cereus dis￾covery in milk samples by means of chronoamperometry (Kang et al., 2013).
Liang et al. (2010) described a novel B. cereus electrochemical sensor
that used monoclonal antibodies immobilized on double-layer AuNPs to
capture the target and chitosan to connect the sensing element to the
GCE. The sensor established quick recognition, long-term constancy, and
high sensitivity to bacterial contamination. Kang et al. (2013) created a
microfluidic impedance sensor for B. cereus detection using a double￾layered gold nanoparticle and chitosan. The use of double-layer AuNPs
improved antibody immobilization and retained antibody activity. Ait
Lahcen et al. (2018) described a label-free electrochemical biosensor, and
Izadi et al. (2016) created a B. cereus electrochemical biosensor based on
DNA-based AuNPs-adapted pencil graphite electrodes (PGEs). The target
was captured by a sensing element composed of AuNPs self-assembled
with single-stranded DNA of the nheA gene immobilized with a thiol
linker on the AuNPs modified PGE.
12.3.7 Electrochemical detection of Staphylococcus aureus
S. aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause severe purulent infec￾tions in humans, including pseudomembranous colitis and even systemic
256 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsinfections like sepsis, pneumonia, and pericarditis (Wang et al., 2018). It
can secrete enterotoxin and cause food poisoning with symptoms of diar￾rhea, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration under the right conditions. S.
aureus is also the most common cause of furunculosis (Abdalhai et al.,
2014). Furthermore, mutations in the S. aureus gene sequence could result
in the production of drug-resistant strains (methicillin-resistant S. aureus￾MRSA) as well as additional resistance to β-lactamases (Xu et al., 2018).
Bekir et al. (2015) used impedance spectroscopy to detect S. aureus by
observing the alteration in resistance before and after the S. aureus, recog￾nized by anti-S. aureus, was immobilized on a gold electrode using ferri/
ferro cyanide as a redox probe. The biosensor established was then used
to identify stressed and resuscitated microbes. An electrochemical biosen￾sor for S. aureus was detected using a triple-helix molecular switch that
can control the transfer of electrochemical signals (Cai et al., 2021). Cui
et al. (2019) developed an ultrasensitive magnetic fluorescence aptasensor
based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer for the isolation and find￾ing of S. aureus. They improved S. aureus aptamers on the surface of
Fe3O4 and carbon dots when cDNAs were hydrogen bonded into nano￾dimers. Jia et al. (2014) used impedance spectroscopy to report an electro￾chemical sensor for S. aureus detection that used single-stranded DNA as
an aptamer linked to reducing graphene oxide-AuNPs nanocomposite.
Nemr et al. (2019) combined a magnetic capture unit and an electro￾chemical discovery unit in a microfluidic platform. Because penicillin￾binding protein 2a (PBP2a) causes methicillin resistance, anti-PBP2a
antibodies functionalized magnetic NPs to definitely detain MRSA. Kurt
et al. (2016) used aptamer-functionalized QDs and up conversion NPs to
identify foodborne pathogens, S. typhimurium, and S. aureus.
12.3.8 Electrochemical detection of Clostridium perfringens
C. perfringens is the most common type of Clostridium in clinically genital
gangrene pathogens. The bacterium was called C. perfringens because it can
form a capsule in the body (Saitoh et al., 2015). C. perfringens can break
down sugar in muscle and connective tissue and then release a large amount
of gas, causing a large area of tissue necrosis, causing severe tissue emphy￾sema, and affecting blood supply. The DPV electrochemical signal could
be detected using a “sandwich” reaction. Wang et al. (2018) defined an
electrochemical biosensor for identifying the DNA of C. perfringens based
on CeO2/chitosan-altered electrodes by observing impedance changes.
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 257C. perfringens electrochemical detection is primarily due to its DNA. Jiang
et al. (2014) published an electro-chemiluminescence sensor for detecting
C. perfringens DNA using RCA, similar to that reported by Zhao et al. (2016).
12.4 Electrochemical detection of viruses
Viruses are accountable for affecting many various diseases that lead to
hundreds of thousands of deaths each year (Saylan et al., 2019), including
influenza (Webster et al., 1992), Ebola (Feldmann & Geisbert, 2011),
MERS (Zumla et al., 2015), HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) (Mellors et al., 1996), and,
more recently, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease, 2019). Viruses are
regarded as one of the most transferrable pathogens in food manufacturing
because of their increased resistance to treatment and the lesser doses nec￾essary to cause infection. These are some of the smallest pathogenic agents
known to man, with only a limited number of genes encased in a proteic
capsid and a lipidic envelope (Ryu, 2017a). Norovirus, hepatitis A and E,
sapovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus are pathogenic viruses that cause food￾borne diseases. About 58% of viral gastroenteritis, winter diarrhea, and
acute nonbacteria gastroenteritis are caused by noroviruses.
Only the apparatus of the host cell can translate such genes, which are
used by the intercellular parasite to synthesize millions of fresh viral particles
(Cohen, 2016), which will act similarly, resulting in severe consequences
rapidly (Ryu, 2017b). In this situation, quick and exact identification of viral
illnesses is significant for improving clinical results and encouraging doctors
to take suitable actions. There are works in the literature that report on the
use of electrochemical techniques for virus detection and quantification, pri￾marily in blood and other biofluid spread and respiratory transmission
(Ribeiro et al., 2020). Biosensor technologies, with less difficult sample prep￾aration stages, have been planned as a more exact and faster approach to viral
detection. These sensors can detect and count intact viruses, viral proteins,
and nucleic acids, but the direct discovery of whole virus particles has the
benefits of operational simplicity and cost-effectiveness in viral diagnostics
(Cheng et al., 2012). Zhao et al. (2020) established an aptamer-based biosen￾sor in a sandwich structure for the discovery of hepatitis B virus (HBV) by
DPV, combined a geomagnetic assay with DPV detection for HBV analysis.
A nanostructured gold electrode conjugated with concanavalin A was
used to create an electrochemical biosensor (Hong et al., 2015). Ribeiro
et al. (2020) described a comprehensive list of biosensors designed for the
258 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsdiscovery of respiratory viruses, containing an electrochemical detection
method. Hong et al. (2015) reported a sensitive (35 copies/mL), selective
(98%), and fast (1h) electrochemical biosensor for norovirus discovery.
Bhardwaj et al. (2019) used aptamers to create a label-free electrochemical
biosensor capable of distinguishing among influenza A H1N1 virus sub￾types. Bai et al. (2018) published an EIS aptamer-based biosensor for
detecting the deactivated H1N1 virus. Initially, the SELEX method was
used to generate aptamers with great binding affinity to deactivated
viruses. The candidates were then tested in a direct enzyme-linked oligo￾nucleotide assay (ELONA), with the best ones chosen for a sandwich
ELONA and electrochemical aptasensor production. Veerapandian et al.
(2016) developed a voltammetric immunosensor for simultaneous discov￾ery of influenza A H1N1 and H5N1 viruses using MB as a redox probe.
Through indirect opposition between the free virus in the sample and
immobilized MERS-CoV protein S1 or a stable concentration of anti￾body additional to the sample, the electrode array enabled multiplexed
identification of various strains of CoVs. Dielectrophoretics remains a
promising tool for manipulating, separating, and detecting viruses
(Nakano et al., 2013). A carbon electrode containing a viral capsid￾specific aptamer conjugated with graphene AuNPs was used to capture
the virus. Haji-Hashemi et al. (2019) reported an electrochemical immu￾nosensor for mosaic virus (FMV) discovery using CV, DPV, and EIS.
Changes in biological recognition actions, such as viral antigens bind￾ing to specific antibodies placed on the bioreceptor, are detected by elec￾trochemical biosensors and transformed into a quantitative amperometric,
potentiometric, or impedimetric signal. A combined automatic electro￾chemical immunosensor array has been intended to detect the presence of
hepatitis viruses. Que et al. (2019) described a new electrochemical nano￾biosensor for detecting Epstein-Barr virus DNA. An electrochemical
immunosensor lab-on-chip immobilized with five hepatitis virus antibo￾dies (A, B, C, D, and E) was established for the simultaneous finding of
five hepatitis virus antigens in a one-step capture format.
According to Brazaca et al. (2021), the technology derived from the
use of electrochemical POCs would be the solution for the development
of quicker, miniaturized, and more sensitive systems. Specific influenza
using SELEX, a mini-hemagglutinin protein, was used to generate apta￾mers with great binding affinities, permitting the discovery of the pre￾ferred virus subtypes (seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1). The
competitive assessment of an array of carbon electrodes altered with
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 259AuNPs detected it (Layqah & Eissa, 2019). Electrochemical DNA biosen￾sors for bacteria and virus detection are now extensively used due to their
increased sensitivity, low cost, simplicity, portability, and smaller sample
size (Huang et al., 2022; Mei et al., 2022).
A novel idea was implemented by combining miniaturized microelec￾tromechanical methods and an aptamer to create a portable electrochemical
sensor (Kitajima et al., 2016). To bind with the virus, a specific aptamer
for norovirus was immobilized on a gold working electrode and measured
using CV and fluorescence observation. Cajigas et al. (2022) described an
electrochemical biosensor capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 and distin￾guishing it from SARS-CoV, MERS, and human coronavirus homologs.
Fani et al. (2020) reported an electrochemical DNA biosensor for identify￾ing Human T-lymphotropic Virus-1 using DPV (Fani et al., 2020).
Reduced graphene oxide was used to alter SPCEs. Tan et al. (2019) devel￾oped yet another label-free immunosensor for the identification of HBV.
AuNPs-based electrochemical biosensors have been effectively used for
virus identification (Layqah & Eissa, 2019). For example, one of the vastly
causing viral pathogens, the MERS-CoV, was revealed to contaminate
dairy products (van Doremalen et al., 2014). Ilkhani and Farhad (2018)
described an electrochemical DNA biosensor for Ebola virus identification
with DPV for the first time. First, gold-screen-printed electrodes with thio￾lated single-strand probes were immobilized. Karimi-Maleh et al. (2021)
identified that electrochemical DNA biosensors are based on the principle
of base complementarity, which effects variations in concentration, energy,
and other aspects, and this alteration can be changed into visual electrical
signals through suitable conversion. A poly-dimethylsiloxane microfluidic
chip with SPCE was used in a study to identify norovirus (Chand &
Neethirajan, 2017). AuNP-based electrochemical biosensors have been
effectively used for virus identification (Layqah & Eissa, 2019). For exam￾ple, one of the very pathogenic viruses, the MERS coronavirus (MERS￾CoV), was revealed to contaminate dairy foods (van Doremalen et al.,
2014). Virus antibodies were immobilized on an electrochemical sensor
array in the device, which took antigens from the solution.
12.5 Electrochemical detection of protozoa
Protozoa are unicellular, heterotrophic, and eukaryotic organisms.
Furthermore, protozoa have an enormous generative potential, resulting
in a large number of pregnancies and short generation periods. It has been
well established in recent decades that parasites of protozoa play a
260 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssignificant role in the beginning and development of various kinds of ill￾nesses in humans (Dawson, 2005). Protozoa are commonly transmitted
from one human to another via arthropod vectors, person-to-person
interaction, food, water, sand fly, or mosquito bite (Fletcher et al., 2012).
They have a high capacity to replicate in cells, which allows them to live
and also allows dangerous contagions to grow from a single organism
(Hutchison et al., 2000). Several reports have shown that the extent and
occurrence of parasites in protozoan illnesses are influenced by a range of
influences, comprising parasite spread mode, host population spatial struc￾ture, and host mass (Altizer et al., 2000). The protozoan life cycle is
divided into phases that vary in action and structure (Cox, 2002).
Foodborne disease in developing countries can be caused by economic
and health issues, and parasites such as Toxoplasma and Giardia play impor￾tant roles in these issues (Pires et al., 2015). Giardia, T. gondii, and
Cryptosporidium are the most common developing foodborne parasites
(Fletcher et al., 2012). Giardia is a major foodborne parasite that causes
diarrhea in children below the age of five in developing countries (Kotloff
et al., 2013). Giardia infection causes death or disease in humans by increas￾ing pathophysiological consequences in the host entrails via parasite pro￾ducts (Einarsson et al., 2016). Since Giardia causes fatal disease and has
nonspecific symptoms, suitable diagnostic approaches are essential
(Flanagan, 1992). T. gondii is another type of foodborne protozoa parasite.
Toxoplasmosis is the third most common foodborne infection that requires
hospitalization (Vaillant et al., 2005). Furthermore, T. gondii contaminates
up to one-third of the global population (Goldstein et al., 2008).
Toxoplasmosis is difficult to detect in some people because it is asymptom￾atic. As a result, it is important to accurately identify toxoplasmosis and dis￾tinguish it from other diseases caused by this protozoan (Shieh et al., 2017).
Malaria is a potentially fatal infection caused by Plasmodium parasites
(Ragavan et al., 2018). Malaria prevalence has decreased in recent years
because of the development of effective investigative and treatment
approaches, but it has not been extinct (Soraya et al., 2019). The presence
of nonpathogenic (asymptomatic) plasmodium parasites and small concen￾trations of antigen in blood samples of patients, indicate the asymptomatic
transmission of the pathogens. Cryptosporidium spp. is the most common
waterborne parasite and an important cause of death related to gastrointes￾tinal infections affected by water contamination. Importantly, depending
on the kind of electrochemical technique used, the pathogen’s size could
have an important effect on the performance of a certain electrochemical
biosensor. Pathogens, for example, can be three orders of magnitude in
Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 261size. Norovirus has a diameter of 27 nm (Robilotti et al., 2015), whereas
G. lamblia oocysts have a diameter of 14 m (Adam, 2001). Electrochemical
biosensors for the identification of protozoa-based pathogens are an area
that needs more research. Protozoa, as large pathogens, attain lower elec￾trode analysis than small pathogens, resulting in a lesser influence on
charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte line. Currently, Cryptosporidium
parvum is the most commonly identified protozoa by means of electro￾chemical biosensors (Iqbal et al., 2015).
Electrochemical assays based on aptamer sensing stages are more popu￾lar than those described previously due to their higher sensitivity, thermos
ability, robustness, and selectivity (Hassan et al., 2021). Luka et al. (2019)
investigated the effectiveness of a label-free capacitive biosensor in quanti￾fying Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Anti-cryptosporidium antibodies
were used, which allowed for accurate differentiation of various numbers
of taken cells and masses on the surface of the biosensor regardless of the
size of Cryptosporidium oocysts (5 m in diameter) (Jain et al., 2019). Ilkhani
et al. (2019) reported a LOC device based on a three-dimensional TAS
microchip for extremely selective and fast Cryptosporidium identification
using DPV-EAT and EIS-EAT.
Another report by Aguilar and Fritsch (2003) was an identification test
with very good results in the determination of C. parvum in water samples.
The target DNA was recovered with a LOD of 2 μg mL21 over a linear
range of 550 μg mL21
. Laczka et al. (2013) used an ELISA electrode￾based device and potentiometric method to achieve an LOD of 500 C. par￾vum oocysts/mL in an hour. The flagellated protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi is
the most common source of CD infections, accounting for approximately
30% of infected people. As a result, the use of electrochemical approaches
to elucidate diagnostic problems is growing. Sleeping sickness, African try￾panosomiasis, and CD are major Trypanosoma species complaints, and ini￾tial the discovery of these illnesses using optical sensors can assist in
reducing disease rates and providing safer treatments. The EIS is a sensitive,
label-free method for studying varying surface phenomena in bulk attri￾butes. EIS can deliver direct identification of Abs or Ags by immobilizing
biological apparatuses on a working electrode (Katz & Willner, 2003).
According to Carneiro et al. (2019), the Ni (II), Pd (II), and HFedtc
complex can decrease in vitro trypanocidal action. Leishmaniases affect
more than 98 nations and are a major communal health problem, with an
increasing problem over the past decade. Leishmania multiplies in tissues
such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, and the immunocompromised
state can result in disease or death if not treated. The VL and CL are two
262 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationscommon kinds of Leishmaniasis contagion that occur in organs. VL Ags
immobilization on a carbon electrode altered with AuNPs can be a bene￾ficial electrochemical means for identifying anti-Leishmania Abs in patient
serum (Martins et al., 2020). EIS is a low-cost, quick-application electro￾chemical tool with high specificity and sensitivity. Diniz et al. (2003) pre￾pared gold and platinum electrodes for EIS adsorption of T. cruzi flagellar
repetitive Ag and cytoplasmic repetitive Ag. Several drugs can be
decreased in the nitrogen group if they contain nitroaromatic groups
(Alvarez et al., 2010). The antiprotozoal nitrofuran drugs were evaluated
using the CV method.
The SPEs are miniature electrodes used in the EIS method (Yamanaka
et al., 2016). The sulfuric acid and 3-mercaptopropionic acid can trigger
the useful groups of the SPE electrode, permitting L. infantum Ag to be
easily immobilized on an electrode with SH-NH bonds. In less than 30
minutes, the EIS immunosensor identified anti-VL Ab in human and dog
serum (Cordeiro et al., 2019). A novel detection method for Leishmania
DNA is DNA hybridization in tissue samples. The definite Leishmania
DNA probes are directed into the genosensor, which is made of various
materials. Moradi et al. (2016) organized an Au electrode altered with Au
nanoleaves and immobilized a Leishmania DNA probe on it. Mobed
et al. (2020) used electrochemical CV and SWV techniques to measure
the target DNA after designing this electrode. The NS-AuNPs were used
as an Au electrode surface transformer in the biosensor intended by
(Nazari-Vanani et al., 2018) and DPV amounts were effectively accepted
for the identification of synthetic L. infantum target sequences.
Protozoa parasites like Giardia, T. gondii, and Cryptosporidium can spoil
vegetables and soil and are the most common developing foodborne para￾sites. The severe phase of toxoplasmosis, or Giardia contagious, is usually
asymptomatic, and medical symptoms are insufficient to distinguish this
contagion from other diseases. Biosensors, which are subtle and specific
identification approaches, are thus extremely necessary. Chiwunze et al.
(2019) observed that the biosensor was improved with MWCNTs and
polymerized methyl orange, and the electrochemical evaluation of AQ was
simple and highly subtle. Specific IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies are impor￾tant markers for detecting toxoplasmosis using electrochemical sensors.
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been shown to improve surface area,
electron mobility, and electric conductivity. Gokce et al. (2016) reported a
voltammetric device in which the T. gondii capture probe was immobilized
on a PGE, and the hybridization of the probe and target gene was
recorded by means of DPV at a LOD of 40 mg mL21 (Table 12.1).

Electrochemical detection of pathogens in water and food samples 267Alves et al. (2017) described a genosensor that noticed T. gondii DNA
hybridization with 100 ng mL21 of genomic DNA. The high discrimina￾tion of microchip fabrication recovers the system's use in POCs (da Silva
et al., 2022). Laczka et al. (2013) also described the development of an
ELISA electrode-based potentiometric sensor for the identification of C.
parvum oocysts. Similarly to the bacteria section, POC devices could play
a significant role in local protozoa measurement/finding, as a protozoon is
one of the foremost causes of deaths in children under the age of five
worldwide (Hassan et al., 2021) (Fig. 12.1).

13.1 Introduction
Especially in recent years, the standard of human life has improved due to
the development of society and technology. However, there is growing
concern about the following environmental issues. Containments released
by industries, modern factories, and farms threaten the health of humans
and even upset the natural ecosystem. The emissions from industries, par￾ticularly gases emitted from the burning of petroleum products, coal, fossil
fuels, and automobile exhausts (Li et al., 2012), are the major sources of
toxic gases, including oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, hydrogen sul￾fides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Trivedi et al., 2018; Wei
et al., 2018). Toxic gases released into the air pollute the environment
and threaten the health of living organisms. These pollutants lead to the
occurrence of acid rain, photochemical smog, and respiratory complica￾tions in living organisms. A variety of gas sensors have been developed for
the detection of toxic gases. Among these, electrochemical sensors are
commonly used for detecting toxic and harmful gases since they are easy
to miniaturize, inexpensive, linear, repeatable, and stable over long
periods.
There has been widespread use of electrochemical sensors to detect
trace amounts of heavy metals in natural waters (Batley, 1983), carcino￾gens (Barek et al., 2001), gas pollutants (Wan et al., 2018), and organic
pollutants (Yang et al., 2018). An electrochemical gas sensor measures the

detecting principle, thereby distinguishing the composition of the gas and
detecting its composition. Electrochemical biosensors have gradually
emerged by integrating biorecognition elements and electrochemical sen￾sors. The biorecognition element of biosensors provides strong selectivity,
allowing them to be used in multicomponent detection without compli￾cated sample processing. This makes the electrochemical biosensor highly
suited for environmental pollution analysis in the laboratory as well as on￾site-based. Considering the highly efficient usage of electrochemical bio￾sensors in detecting toxic gases, a detailed discussion of their role in sens￾ing NO2, SO2, H2S, and NO is covered in this chapter.
13.2 Biosensors
In today’s world, many inventions make our lives easier. We rely on
plenty of gadgets that help us interact with the physical environment, like
air conditioners, mobile phones, and smoke detectors, which are quite
possible due to sensors. A sensor is a primary measurement system that
detects physical and electrical changes, like heat, pH, pressure, current,
etc., and converts these signals to detectable forms (Ensafi, 2019). The
transducer does the conversion of signals from one form to another.
There are a variety of sensors categorized based on the form of signals
they detect, such as physical, chemical, thermal, and biological (Khanna,
2012; White, 1987). This chapter will mainly focus on biological sensors,
commonly known as biosensors.
Cammann coined the term “biosensor” (Cammann, 1977), and it is
defined as a device that comprises a biological sensing component incor￾porated with a physicochemical transducer (Thvenot et al., 1999). The
biological sensor includes enzymes, antibodies, and cells, interacting with
the analyte and initiating a measurable signal. The biological signal gener￾ated is converted into an electrical signal by the transducer. Hence, a bio￾logical sensor consists of (1) a biological sensing device to measure analyte
concentration, (2) a transducer to convert biological signals into electrical
signals, and (3) electronics and displays. The first biosensor invented was
Clark’s oxygen electrode (Heineman et al., 1918), and since then, various
researches have been done to improve the sensor’s sensitivity, selectivity,
reproducibility, and stability. Some other examples of biosensors include
glucose sensors (Guilbault & Lubrano, 1973) (for blood glucose monitor￾ing), lactate sensors (Rathee et al., 2016) (to measure the concentration of
288 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationslactate in the blood), urea sensors (Guilbault & Montalvo, 1969), immu￾nosensors (North, 1985), etc. Biosensors have wide applications in food
monitoring, the medical field, the fermentation process, biodefense, sus￾tainable food safety, forensic investigation, and environmental detection
(Luong et al., 2008), as shown in Fig. 13.1.
13.2.1 Components of biosensors
A typical biosensor comprises mainly (1) an analyte, (2) a bioreceptor, (3)
a transducer, and (4) electronics, as shown in Fig. 13.2. Modifications in
receptors, transducers, and electronic parts are done to improve the effi￾ciency of biosensors and make them more user-friendly.
1. Analyte: Target molecules whose constituents need to be identified
and whose concentration is to be measured, like glucose, alcohol, lac￾tate, urea, etc.
2. Bioreceptor: A molecule or biomolecule that aims to identify the
analyte using a biochemical mechanism. They bind the analyte of
interest to the surface of the biosensor, leading to signal production.
This process of generation of signals when an analyte interacts with
the bioreceptor is called biorecognition. Examples of bioreceptors
include enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, cells, and aptamers.
3. Transducer: A transducer is an apparatus that converts one form of
energy into another. The interaction of the analyte with the biorecep￾tor produces biochemical reactions converted into some other
Figure 13.1 Applications of biosensors in different domains.
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring 289measurable form of signals by a transducer. This process of energy con￾version is called signalization. The detectable or measurable form of
signals can be optical, electrical, electrochemical, mass change, calori￾metric, or magnetic. Biosensors can be classified into various types
depending on the signal generated by the transducer, among which
electrochemical transducers are the best based on their portability, sen￾sitivity, cost-effectiveness, and user-friendly interface.
4. Electronics and display: The electronic signal is amplified by the
electronics and is displayed in digital form. The display shows the out￾put in a readable format, generally in the form of numerical graphs,
tables, or figures.
13.2.2 Characteristics of biosensors
The requirements to develop a highly efficient biosensor are as follows
(Turner, 2013):
1. Selectivity: In a mixture of samples, selecting a particular analyte to
be measured is crucial.
2. Sensitivity: Biosensors must be ultrasensitive to analyze the trace ele￾ments, which leads to the detection of analytes of very low concentra￾tion in a minimal number of steps.

types of bioreceptors and transducers. Source: From Naresh, V., & Lee, N. (2021). A

290 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications3. Accuracy: Accurate results are expected from a biosensor after each
time use. This property makes a biosensor ideal to be used widely.
4. Response time: A biosensor’s response time is the time required to
acquire 95% of the results—the lower the response time, the better
the sensor.
5. Stability: Stability is a principal characteristic of a biosensor related to the
lifetime of a biosensor and its affinity power toward an analyte. Stability is
affected by the internal and external environmental conditions of a biosensor.
13.3 Nanomaterial-based biosensors
Biosensors have a wide and diverse way of classification based on different
types of bioreceptors and transducers used. Among all the classifications,
nanomaterial-based biosensors have hogged the limelight due to their vast
range of usage in biosensing owing to their large surface area, high electri￾cal conductivity, adsorption, and modifiable chemical and physical proper￾ties (Dolez, n.d.). Another reason for such advancement is their
multidisciplinary use of dimensionality. There are four types of nanoma￾terials: 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D (Dolez, n.d.) as shown in Fig. 13.3. In zero￾Figure 13.3 Classification of nanomaterials based on dimensionality and the synthe￾sis of different nanobiosensors. Source: From Naresh, V., & Lee, N. (2021). A review on
biosensors and recent development of nanostructured materials-enabled biosensors.
Sensors, 21(4), 1109. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041109.
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring 291dimensional nanomaterials (nanoparticles [NPs], quantum dots [QDs]), the
material is nanoconfined from the x, y, and z directions. These types of
nanostructures can be utilized for increasing the surface area and the active
sites. One-dimensional nanostructures (nanowires, nanotubes) are nano￾confined from any two directions and are used for providing
stable passage for electron transfer. Two-dimensional nanostructures
(nanofilms, nanosheets) are confined from one direction and used to pro￾vide a stable surface for immobilization. Lastly, three-dimensional struc￾tures (dendrimers, nanoclusters, nanoflowers, etc.) do not have
confinement from any direction ($100 nm) and are considered for their
geometric volume. Nanobiosensors have advantages over macro/micro￾biosensors due to (1) calculating the concentration of nanoscopic particles
(cell organelles and biomolecules), (2) measuring the ultralow concentra￾tion of potentially harmful substances, and (3) determining properties of
regions that are hard to reach (Abdel-Karim et al., 2020).
13.3.1 Zero-dimensional nanobiosensors
In zero-dimensional nanostructures, the materials are of the nano-range
(,100 nm) from all three directions (x, y, and z). These materials are
highly used for the detection of very small-sized analytes of nano-range.
Nanoparticles and quantum dots are the materials that come under 0D
nanostructures.
13.3.1.1 Nanoparticles-based biosensors
NPs are used in biosensors due to their small size and alterable physical
and chemical properties, which help them bind to the target molecule
efficiently. These particles are used to provide excellent selectivity and
sensitivity in electrochemical biosensors. Some metal oxide nanoparticles
(MONPs), developed as nanoenzymes, act as catalysts in biochemical reac￾tions on biosensors. Some noble metals are also used as part of biosensors
due to their electron transfer ability, easy functionalization, facile synthesis,
and nonreactive nature. Examples of metals and MONPs include gold
(Au), palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), TiO2,
SnO2, ZnO, etc. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent optical, magnetic,
catalytic, and electrochemical properties for applications in various fields
like drug delivery, imaging, health diagnosis, food safety, and environment
(Niu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015).
292 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications13.3.1.1.1 Metal nanoparticles
Gold (Au) nanoparticles have been extensively used for biosensing owing
to their chemical stability, simple synthesis procedure, extensive electro￾chemical potential, and high catalytic activity (Vidotti et al., 2011). These
are utilized for the electrochemical detection of arsenic ions (As31) (Chen
& Huang, 2014), uranyl in natural water (Shi et al., 2021), and mercury
(Hg) (Ratner & Mandler, 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). A novel nonenzy￾matic glucose sensor was developed by Ghasemi et al. based on AuNi
bimetallic nanoparticles, demonstrating a low glucose detection limit
(0.063 uM) (Amiripour et al., 2021). Silver is used for biosensor prepara￾tion because of its excellent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
and catalytic activity. SERS is a very sophisticated and selective technique
for the detection of biological samples and single molecules by enhancing
the weak Raman scattering by a factor of 10101011. Ag nanoparticles
embedded in various matrices are used for the detection of nitrobenzene
(Kariuki et al., 2016), influenza virus (Mahmoudian et al., 2015), and
Fe21, H2O2, and glucose sensing (Basiri et al., 2018).
Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles show excellent electrochemical and cata￾lytic properties. These are used in the preparation of highly sensitive
H2O2 sensors (Lebègue et al., 2015), trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection
(Zhang et al., 2015), hydrogen gas sensors (Jung et al., 2018), and Hg21
detection (Mahmoudian et al., 2016). Palladium (Pd) nanoparticles have
an advantage over other noble metals (Au and Pt) due to their natural
abundance, making them a cost-effective substitute for biomaterial synthe￾sis. They also possess high catalytic and sensor abilities, and their electrodes
have superior electroanalytical ability, making them desirable for use as
electrochemical biosensors (Phan et al., 2020). They are utilized for the
detection of hydrazine to a detection limit of 0.007 μM (Zhang et al.,
2017), for H2 detection (Mohammadi et al., 2020), nitrate sensing
(Mahmoudian et al., 2015), and the determination of anticancer drug
pemetrexed to a detection limit of 0.33 nM (Afzali et al., 2019).
13.3.1.1.2 Metal oxide nanoparticles
MONPs have the advantage of a wide range of usage in varying physical
and chemical environments, along with ultrahigh surface area, low pro￾duction cost, and appreciable absorptivity. They are used for sensing gases
with commending sensitivity and selectivity. The most often used
MONPs are zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2), copper oxide
(CuO), tin oxide (SnO2), nickel oxide (NiO), molybdenum oxide
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring 293(MoO3), iron oxide (Fe2O3), manganese oxide (MnO2), cobalt oxide
(Co3O4), and cerium oxide (CeO2) (Shi et al., 2014). These MONPs also
possess optical and electronic properties due to suitable bandgap. Various
studies have been reported on the application of MONPs-based nanobio￾sensors, some of which are glucose (Wang et al., 2021) and formaldehyde
(Maduraiveeran & Jin, 2017) sensing by NiO, detection of glutamate (Hu
et al., 2020), urea (Ali et al., 2015), and miRNA-141 (Zhao et al., 2021)
by Co3O4, sensing of anticancer drugs by Fe2O3 (Devkota et al., 2014),
CO gas sensing by ZnO (Hjiri et al., 2020), etc.
13.3.1.2 Quantum dots-based biosensors
These 0D nanostructures of the range 110 nm are mainly used for
manufacturing optical biosensors due to their appreciable photochemical
stability, excellent optical properties (e.g., broad excitation), cost￾effectiveness, miniature size, specificity, and narrow size-tunable emission
spectra (Dewan et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2018). These detect pharmaceutical
analytes, organic molecules, and biomolecules like enzymes, carbohy￾drates, neurotransmitters, etc. (Vashist et al., 2012). Certain developments
that are made using quantum dots are constructing electrochemical sensors
for the detection of Cu(II) (Wang, Zhao, Li, et al., 2017), ultrasensitive
lung cancer cell biomarkers (Kalkal et al., 2020), and sensors for detecting
circulating tumor cells (Cui et al., 2019).
13.3.2 One-dimensional nanobiosensors
These nanostructures are mostly in the form of wires, rods, and tubes.
Due to their structure, shape, chemical, and physical properties, they pro￾vide an excellent passage for electron transfer, which can be utilized to
manufacture highly sensitive, robust, and selective electrical biosensors.
Nanowires are very thin structures whose diameter is comparable to the
biological species. Their outstanding transducing properties can be verified
by their tunable conducting nature and their capability to bind analytes to
their surface (Patolsky et al., 2006), and they can be highly sensitive at a
very low ionic concentration of the analytes. Some research utilizing
nanowires’ properties include plasmonic biosensing (Kim et al., 2019) and
direct genome detection (Leonardi et al., 2018). Among the 1D nanos￾tructures, nanotubes are capsule-shaped structures that are majorly used
for the electrochemical detection of molecules like glucose and H2O2.
Carbon nanotubes, one of the forms of nanotubes, are extensively used
due to their excellent tensile strength (like steel), high conductivity (like
294 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationscopper), and outstanding electrocatalytic performance. They are “rolled”
graphene sheets in cylindrical form and have unique features like high
surface-to-volume ratio, low overvoltage, high chemical and thermal
properties, and minimal surface fouling (Simon et al., 2019; Sireesha et al.,
2018). Studies have been done to determine lactate (Luo et al., 2018),
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Janssen et al., 2019), toxic phenolic com￾pounds (nitrophenol, catechol, p-cresol) (Young & Lin, 2017), and vari￾ous environmental pollutants (Ramnani et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016).
13.3.3 Multidimensional nanobiosensors
Graphene, a two-dimensional sp2 hybridized carbon nanosheet, is known
to be an ideal material for the fabrication of electrochemical sensor elec￾trodes due to its chemical and electrical properties. These are known for
their high surface area (twice those of CNTs), high thermal and mechani￾cal strength, and excellent charge carrier mobility (Zhang et al., 2016).
The functionalization of graphene provides better sensitivity to it, improv￾ing its property as a sensor. Certain studies for graphene-based sensors
include the development of an electroanalytical tool for nitrite and carci￾nogenic hydrazine detection (Luo et al., 2015), sensing of TNT (an envi￾ronmental ticking bomb) in seawater (Goh & Pumera, 2011), detection of
NO gas (Li et al., 2011) and various heavy metals (Dai et al., 2016), and
as biomarkers for prostate cancer proteins (Xu et al., 2019). Dendrimers
are macromolecules of the size of protein that are hyperbranched and
consist of surface functional groups in high density. Dendrimers are uti￾lized for their sensitivity, selectivity, specificity, and high surface area.
Dendrimeric biosensors can be used to detect proteins, DNA, biomole￾cules, etc. Recent works suggest dendrimeric biosensor’s use in the detec￾tion of glucose, cDNA (Benters et al., 2001), dengue (Mustapha Kamil
et al., 2019), TNT (Singh et al., 2009), etc.
13.4 Electrochemical biosensors
Electrochemical transducers are used in biosensors because of their low
cost, ease of use, mobility, and simplicity. Due to their high sensitivity to
biomolecules, electrochemical sensors are widely used in many industries
(Charithra & Manjunatha, 2020; Thévenot et al., 2001). Typically, an
electrochemical process results in a detectable current (amperometry), a
measurable charge accumulation or power (potentiometry), modification
of the conductive characteristics of the substance between the electrodes
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring 295(conductometry), and measurement of reactance and resistance in the bio￾sensor (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy). Electrochemical mea￾surement is independent of a reaction volume; therefore measurements
can be made with a small sample size. Electrochemical sensors are
employed at low detection limits and with great sensitivity (Ronkainen
et al., 2010).
13.4.1 Amperometric biosensors
Amperometric biosensors measure the concentration of analytes in sample
matrices by converting biological recognition events brought on by elec￾troactive species at the surface of the sensor into a current signal. Despite
its simplicity, amperometric detection occasionally produces low LOD. In
amperometry, which is employed in biocatalytic sensors, the current signal
is produced by the reduction or oxidation of an electrical substance, meta￾bolic product, or intermediate on the surface of a working electrode. An
amperometric transducer examines the charge transfer between phase
interfaces, such as between two electrodes separated by an electrolyte.
Amperometric biosensors track variations in the current flowing through
the working electrode due to redox species being reduced or oxidized
during a biological reaction that is linearly correlated with analyte concen￾tration. Continued addition of analytes typically results in an amperomet￾ric signal response with relatively easy-to-distinguish beginning and final
currents for each acquisition. One of the drawbacks of amperometry is
the formation of charging currents (i.e., the current necessary to apply the
potential to the system) at the beginning of the measurements
(Ronkainen & Okon, 2014). For use in healthcare, the environment, and
industry, amperometric biosensors are affordable, appropriate, and very
sensitive. Tucci et al. created an amperometric biosensor for the detection
of herbicides using cyanobacteria, namely Anabaena variabilis (Tucci et al.,
2019). The target herbicides used for the detection are diuron and atra￾zine. In the biosensor, the photocurrent is generated due to the oxidation
of water depending upon the herbicides’ concentration. As the concentra￾tion of the herbicides rises, the current begins to fall. The biosensor’s sen￾sitivity toward atrazine is reported to be 24.6 mAm M21
cm22 with a
limit of detection (LOD) of 0.56 mM. Fig. 13.4 shows the herbicides
inhibition mechanism in Anabaena variabilis cyanobacteria.
296 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications13.4.2 Potentiometric biosensors
It assesses the potential differences between the reference and the working
electrode, and the measured signal demonstrates the behavior associated
with concentration. A gas-sensitive or selective ionic electrode is fre￾quently used as the potentiometric transducer (Bobacka et al., 2008). The
selectivity and the selection of the chosen electrode of the target species
in the system are crucial for the sensitivity and selectivity of potentiomet￾ric biosensors. However, potentiometer application in microbial biosen￾sing is constrained by the necessity and importance of maintaining a
steady reference electrode. Mishra et al. fabricated a biosensor for the
detection of G-nerve agents using potentiometry (Mishra et al., 2018).
The design of the biosensor was in the form of a skull, with one eye as a
working electrode and the other as a reference electrode. Fig. 13.5 illus￾trates the conceptualization, design, and printing of potentiometric bio￾sensors and their application on human skin.
13.4.3 Conductometric biosensors
It is a method for measuring the electrical conductivity change of the solution
as a result of the creation or consumption of ionic species, such as the
Figure 13.4 Graphical representation of herbicides inhibiting the process of photo￾synthesis. Source: From Tucci, M., Grattieri, M., Schievano, A., Cristiani, P., & Minteer, S.

10.1016/j.electacta.2019.02.007.
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring 297metabolic activity of microorganisms. Most conductometric biosensors contain
enzymes whose charged by-products enhance ionic strength due to conductiv￾ity. In biosensors, conductivity is a diagnostic method that has been applied to
both clinical and environmental analyses. Microbial biosensors are appealing
because conductometry measurement is quick and accurate under new syn￾thetic analytical techniques. The fact is that conductometric biosensors do not
require the usage of a reference electrode and are made of an insulating sub￾strate embedded with stainless steel, platinum, graphite, or other metallic sens￾ing components. They can be quickly shrunk and integrated using inexpensive
thin-film standard technology, are light-insensitive, and frequently function at
low-amplitude alternating voltages, which avoids Faraday processes on the elec￾trodes. One drawback of this approach is that the signal-to-noise ratio is less
than 2%, so the buffer concentration and other components must be added to
balance such issues. The method’s sensitivity is reduced when nonreacting ions
are present in the solution. However, until the signal-to-noise ratio is good,
low ionic strength buffers can be employed to assess low concentrations
(Dzyadevych & Jaffrezic-Renault, 2014). To sum up, the accuracy and sensitiv￾ity of conductometric sensors are less than other sensors.

298 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsmeasured, monitored, and reported via an output electrical impedance
signal, which is inversely proportional to the activity of an analyte.
Impedance biosensors are electrochemical devices that employ impedance
variations for the detection of biological entities or analytes. The most
commonly used technique is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS). EIS makes it simple to determine the characteristics of the bulk
electrode and the processes occurring at the electrode interface (Maalouf
et al., 2007; Manjunatha et al., 2020). The signal’s amplitude varies in the
EIS with incredibly small variations.
Additionally, since the biosensor uses components like antibodies,
enzymes, bacteria, viruses, etc. (Helali et al., 2006) to monitor a biological
event, the measurement of impedance is independent of the presence of
redox couples (Elshafey et al., 2013). The impedimetric biosensors aim to
create amino acid groups, carboxyl groups, and similar other groups on
the surface of the electrode to capture the antibodies. This step is crucial
when creating an impedimetric biosensor since it guarantees the sensor’s
durability and repeatability. Additionally, nanomaterials have been applied
for such purposes. The resistance to electron transfer often rises when the
antibody is discovered utilizing antigens, ultimately reducing the capaci￾tance (Sharma et al., 2021).
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as entrapping antibodies, which
do not affect their activity or effectiveness (Chullasat et al., 2011).
Similarly, the impedimetric technique was utilized to detect HER-3
(Canbaz et al., 2014) and to estimate the number of bacteria in a labora￾tory fermentor (Kim et al., 2009). Ankan et al. examined the use of an
antigenantibody binding mechanism in the detection of E. coli bacteria
(Chowdhury et al., 2012). A study using EIS was done to examine the
sensitivity and efficacy of the sensor, which has an antibody covalently
bonded to the surface of the polyaniline film. It was tested and noted that
the impedance changes as the bacterial concentration increases; moreover,
the biosensor has a high sensitivity toward E. coli. The EIS technique was
developed to identify MCF-7 cancer cells by Seven et al. (2013). The
study shows that the anti-c-cerbB-2 was captured on a polypyrrole-NHS
electrode by covalent linkage. Besides, the sensor successfully identified
cancer cells with a sensitivity range from 100 to 10,000 cells per mL.
Rushworth et al. created a biosensor to detect amyloid-beta oligomers
related to Alzheimer’s disease (Rushworth et al., 2014). The binding of
the oligomer increases with increased current flow through the biosensor,
resulting in a decrease in the impedance. Fig. 13.6 depicts the effect of Aβ

shows an increase in the surface conductivity of the biosensor upon oligo￾mer binding.

pollutants. Many health problems are known to be caused by poor air
quality, which can occasionally necessitate expensive and potentially life￾Figure 13.6 The effect of Aβ oligomers (AβO) on the surface of the biosensor and

300 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsthreatening medical assistance. As a result, reliable toxic gas sensing will
significantly improve both industry and everyone ’s daily life. One of the
most prevalent harmful air pollutants is nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). Nitrogen
dioxide is a reddish-brown, irritating, poisonous gas with a distinguished
pungent, harsh aroma. The predicted LC 50 (lethal concentration for the
exposed 50%) after a 1-hour NO2 exposure in humans is 174 ppm. The
primary sources of toxic gas are the burning of fuels like some types of
coal and oil (Anenberg et al., 2017), the burning of biomass as a result of
intense lightning during thunderstorms ( Boleij et al., 1989), and the fixing
of nitrogen by microorganisms as a result of fertilizing agriculture
(Robinson & Robbins, 1970). The effects of NO2 on the respiratory sys￾tem are significant for causing airway inflammation, lowering lung func￾tion after extended exposure, and raising the risk of respiratory diseases
(Bauer et al., 1986). The detrimental effect is followed by increased sensi￾tivity to allergens and involvement in the production of ground-level
ozone and fine particulate matter (PM), both of which harm human
health and involvement in the production of acid rain, which damages
structures, vegetation, and lakes and streams by increasing their acidity
(Genc et al., 2012).
The most prevalent air pollutant is sulfur dioxide (SO 2), primarily a
combination of sulfur oxides (SOx). It has an unpleasant, harsh scent and
is an invisible gas. According to estimates, 50 100 ppm is the maximum
value for SO2 exposures lasting 30 minutes to an hour. The primary
sources of SO2 are the combustion of fossil fuels (namely, coal and petro￾leum) in power plants, oil refineries, extensive industrial facilities, automo￾biles, and home boilers ( Guo et al., 2015). It comes from natural sources
like raging forest fires and active volcanoes. When sulfur-containing min￾eral ores are treated, SO2 is also released into the environment. Too
much SO2 exposure harms the throat, lungs, and eyes ( Nisar et al., 2013).
Some plants are toxic to it, and as a result, they exhibit apparent damage
and have lower yields. Acid rain disturbs the natural balance of ecosystems
such as soil, lakes, and rivers, further causing harm to wildlife and flora.
The culprit of such is SO2, which rapidly dissolves in the water droplets
in clouds. Similarly, some building materials gradually deteriorate when
SO2 gas and air moisture are present (e.g., limestone).
The gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is poisonous, foul-smelling, and
unpleasant. According to estimates, 170 300 ppm is the maximum con￾centration of H2S that can be exposed for 1 hour without severe conse￾quences. The primary sources of H 2S gas include sewage treatment
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring301facilities, sulfur deposits, natural gas, volcanic gas, and decomposing
organic compounds (Zeng et al., 2011). Olfactory nerve paralysis and
nose/eye irritation are caused by even low levels of H2S gas exposure. A
moderate dose may result in pulmonary edema, chest tightness, kerato￾conjunctivitis, sore throat, and cough. Overexposure can result in head￾aches, confusion, loss of judgment, convulsions, coma, and even death
(Wiheeb et al., 2013).
Electrochemical sensing is the most widely used approach for monitor￾ing toxic gases. This technique is superior to other detection methods like
optical (Levitsky, 2015), acoustic (Hök et al., 2000), and gas chro￾matographic methods (Li et al., 2010). Electrochemical detection has sev￾eral significant benefits over other techniques, including lower cost, low
output energy, good selectivity and consistency, and highly accurate
detection technique up to ppm level (Yunusa et al., 2014). Although elec￾trochemical sensors have a short shelf life and are extremely sensitive to
temperature changes, the working temperature should be kept as constant
as possible for optimum sensor performance. High-temperature sensors are
typically used in industrial and space applications. Many studies have
recently been conducted on appropriate materials for toxic gas sensing of
NO2, SO2, and H2S gases. We have reviewed current developments in
electrochemical sensors to detect toxic gases, emphasizing NO2, SO2, and
H2S gas sensors.
13.5.1 NO2 sensing
Recently, epitaxial graphene was employed to detect NO2 gas up to ppb
levels, and it was discovered that monolayer graphene had a better carrier
concentration response than bilayer graphene (Melios et al., 2018). For
the creation of Pd-SnO2-RGO hybrids as sensing materials for NO2 gas,
Wang et al. combined SnO2 and Pd NPs on a nanosheet made up of
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Wang et al., 2018). Accordingly, the
image of Pd-SnO2-rGO obtained from high-resolution transmission elec￾tron microscopy (HR-TEM) shows that rGO nanosheets have been
coated with 35 nm NPs. A sensitivity of 3.92 was observed for the
response time of 13 s when the nanosheet was exposed to 1 ppm of NO2
gas at ambient temperature, which is superior to rGO nanosheet and
SnO2-rGO nanosheet hybrids as shown in Fig. 13.7. The addition of Pd
NPs caused the recovery time (105 s) to be slower though. The primary
factors improving the sensing efficacy include preferred NO2 adsorption
302 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssites, high conductivity, and Pd NPs ’ catalytic capabilities. The same
group conducted experiments using reduced graphene oxide nanosheets
embellished with SnO2 NPs in which oxygen vacancies (OVs) were
added (Wang, Zhang, Han, et al., 2018 ). By enhancing the adsorption of
O2 molecules, OVs improve the adsorption of NO2 molecules on SnO2
NPs. The SnO2-rGO-OVs-based sensor displayed a sensitivity of 3.80
with a good response as well as recovery time after exposure to 1 ppm of
NO2 gas. A hydrothermal treatment-based rGO/Au nanocomposite￾based NO2 sensor was reported by Zhang et al. It has a speedy response
and recovery process and sound sensitivity ( Zhang et al., 2016).
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in two dimensions (2D)
have a semiconducting nature, high surface-to-volume ratio, and atom￾ically thin layer structures that are necessary for being a convincing sensing
material (Manzeli et al., 2017). An effective chemiresistor was built on a
MoS2 nanowire (NW) network with high selectivity for NO2 over vari￾ous other dangerous and flammable gases ( Kumar et al., 2018). The MoS2
NW network was created using the CVD method. MoS 2 NW network
has good sensitivity and a detection limit of 4.6 ppb NO 2. Response and
recovery times for 5 ppm NO2 exposure were determined to be 16 and
172 s, respectively, at the operating temperature of 60°C. AgNW functio￾nalization on 2D WS2 removes 2D TMDC gas sensors ’ drawbacks such as
low response, poor recovery, and insufficient selectivity ( Ko et al., 2016).
When exposed to acetone and NO2, the pristine WS2 gas sensor exhibits
a strong reaction, but its recovery from NO2 sensing is insufficient.
Because of the catalytic impact and n-type doping effect from AgNW
functionalization, NO2 sensing responsiveness was improved by 12
(667%). With a recovery rate of more than 90%, the NO 2 sensing

Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring303recovery is greatly enhanced, providing dependability and sustainability.
Therefore the AgNW functionalization on 2D WS2 can be a flexible
remedy for the low NO2 sensing performance.
13.5.2 SO2 sensing
The study by Zouaghi et al. showed the vertically aligned carbon nano￾tube (VACNT)-based gas sensors scanned by THz radiation (Zouaghi
et al., 2018). The group used a water-enabled chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) technique to create VACNT on a Si substrate covered in SiO2
and doped with boron. The vertically oriented CNTs show a thickness of
95 μm. In the vicinity of 0.2 THz, the maximum relative transmittance
was attained. When SO2 gas was added, the maximum transmitted elec￾tromagnetic field amplitude of the Si/SiO2/VACNT sensor declined to a
stable value with a short response time of 23 minutes. The recovery
time of the materials was more than 70 minutes. It has been hypothesized
that the high SO2 gas sticking coefficient caused the system’s poor recov￾ery to steel walls. Physical adsorption between the carbon nanotube and
sulfur dioxide molecules was seen after the preparation of a cholesteric￾nematic mixture intercalated with CNT walls (Petryshak et al., 2017).
This adsorption process changes the conductance of the CNTs, which
produces a signal that could be used to detect SO2. A study was done by
Zhang et al. on TiO2/graphene film, made from scratch utilizing the layer
self-assembly method for SO2 detection (Zhang et al., 2017). The sensor
was subjected to 1, 50, 250, and 1000 ppb of SO2 gas to examine the
response and recovery behavior. The sensor responsiveness rises as the gas
concentration increases, while the response and recovery time lengthened.
The increase in response and recovery times is thought to be caused by
the vast interspace as shown in Fig. 13.8.
At an ambient temperature, the TiO2-rGO nanofilm sensor demon￾strated a much greater sensing ability to 1 ppm SO2 gas. Liu et al. created
Ru/Al2O3-catalyzed ZnO nanosheets and combined them with a micro￾sensor for detecting SO2 gas (Liu et al., 2018). The prepared ZnO 2D
nanosheet is uniform, and its thickness was 1.5 nm. Ru/Al2O3/ZnO sen￾sor responses were studied after exposure to various SO2 gas concentra￾tions and related resistance responses. It was found that resistance
significantly decreased upon exposure to SO2, and sensitivity increased
linearly with respect to SO2 concentration. The measured response and
recovery times at 25 ppm of SO2 were 1 and 6 minutes, respectively. The
304 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationscatalyst Ru/Al2O3 was found to split SO2 molecules into readily observ￾able SO• species. Molybdenum binary and tungsten ternary oxide nano￾films were made by Ciftyürek et al., tested, and then used for sulfur
species sensing ( Çiftyürek et al., 2016). It was discovered that nano￾SrMoO4, which is hydrothermally generated, shows the best sensitivity
out of all the manufactured oxide films. The SrMoO 4-based sensors can
be used for gas monitoring in industries since they can function at high
temperatures (over 600°C) without losing their sensing abilities.
Tyagi et al. created a SnO2 thin film using the sputtering approach
(Tyagi et al., 2016). The film was functionalized with NiO nanoclusters￾based catalysts on the surface. To evaluate the response at different operat￾ing temperatures, 500 ppm of SO2 gas was subjected to a metal oxide
NiO nanocluster placed on SnO2. Due to the spillover effects from the
NiO nanocluster toward SO2 and the increase in adsorbed oxygen species
sites at the porous SnO2 layer, NiO/SnO2 materials exhibit a maximum
sensitivity of 56% at 180°C. Similarly, in reaction to 500 ppm of SO 2 gas
at 180°C, the NiO/SnO2 sensor’s response and recovery times were cal￾culated to be 80 and 70 seconds, respectively. Under SO 2 exposure, the
sensor displayed better selectivity and reproducibility. Das et al. reported

Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring305the BiFeO3 strong SO2 selectivity toward butane and CO ( Das et al.,
2015). Additionally, it was discovered that sonochemically produced
BiFeO3 offers superior sensing capabilities compared to conventionally
generated BiFeO3.
Schottky diode-based Al 0.27Ga0.73N/GaN sensors for the detection of
SO2 gas were created synthetically by Minh Triet et al. (2017). The
Schottky barrier separating the rGO and AlGaN layers alters due to gas
exposure. As a result, the reverse saturation current is modified alongside
thermionic emission carrier transport. Due to the electron-withdrawing
nature of SO2 molecules, the resistance response in the instance of SO 2
detection increased with increasing gas concentration. The partial recovery
of rGO-ZnO NRs as sensing material is to blame for the nonlinearity in
response to SO2 gas. In this case, gas molecules in the SO 2 react with the
contact sites, causing sluggish gas molecule diffusion within the rGO mul￾tilayer structure.
Li et al. used SERS to detect SO2 using headspace sampling (HS) and
paper-based analytical devices (PADs), as shown in Fig. 13.9(Li, Duan,
et al., 2018). Gold nanorods (GNRs) treated with 4-mercapto-pyridine
(Mpy) and rGO were created as hybrids. The rGO-MPy-GNRs hybrids
were then vacuum-immobilized onto cellulose-based filter sheets together
with iodine starch complex and anhydrous methanol. This procedure
encourages the development of a thick coating of blue color on the filter
paper. The blue tint on the produced rGO-MPy-GNRs-SIC paper faded
in a matter of minutes when exposed to SO 2.

306 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications13.5.3 H2S sensing
In recent years, H2S detection has been the subject of extensive research
employing carbon nanofibers, rGO, and graphene. Ovsianytskyi et al. sug￾gested an Ag nanoparticle- and charged impurity-functionalized gra￾phene-based H2S gas sensor ( Ovsianytskyi et al., 2018). Using the CVD
approach to create the graphene, Ag NPs and other contaminants were
added using a wet chemical process. After being submerged in an
AgNO3/Fe(NO3)3 solution, the image captured in the scanning electron
microscope indicates the presence of many uniformly distributed nanopar￾ticles (10 100 nm) on its surface. Responses to exposure to 500 parts per
billion of H2S gas for 400 seconds to graphene in its natural state,
graphene-doped Fe(NO3)3 solution, graphene-doped AgNO3 solution,
and graphene-doped mixAgNO3/Fe(NO3)3 solution were compared.
The graphene that had been doped with the combined solution
responded most strongly. H2S adheres to silver due to its interaction with
the adsorbed oxygen species because silver is less electronegative than gra￾phene. Then, graphene accumulates the liberated electrons from the
breakdown of H2S. This mechanism lowers the concentration of gra￾phene holes, increasing the resistance of Ag-doped graphene. Zhang, J
et al. created a robust sensor with good H 2S detection capabilities utilizing
ZnO-C nanofibers (with 30.34 wt.% carbon) ( Zhang et al., 2018). It was
discovered that carbon protection increases the stability of ZnO, enabling
better sensitivity.
Due to their stable nanostructures, metal oxides such as SnO 2, WO3,
ZnO, and -Fe2O3-based sensors displayed improved sensitivity toward
H2S gas (Hosseini et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Shukla & Bhatnagar, 2014 ).
Zhang et al. used a solvothermal approach to report an -Fe2O3
nanosheet-based H2S gas sensor ( Zhang et al., 2019). It was discovered
that the samples’ morphology is not constant at low temperatures. Since
the nanostructure contains both-Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxides, a uniform
shape cannot be achieved at 160°C. It was observed that as the working
temperature rises,-Fe2O3 sensor response to H2S diminishes. The recov￾ery period is prolonged at low temperatures; hence, 135°C was deter￾mined to be the ideal operating temperature by factoring in sensor
responsiveness, response time, and recovery time. Compared to other H 2S
gas sensors, the response time and recovery time were predicted to be
shorter than 10 and 45 seconds, respectively. The variation in the electric
resistances was insignificant for the sensor to 50 ppm acetone, ethanol,
Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring307methanol, and H2 gases at 135°C. However, under the same conditions,
the sensitivity to H2S was quite large, demonstrating the excellent selec￾tivity toward gas, as shown in Fig. 13.10.
Li et al. created ZnOCuO nanotube arrays for detecting H2S gas at
low operating temperatures (Li, Qin, et al., 2018). It was found that the
nanotube frameworks encouraged gas with several active sites among H2S
molecules and oxygen molecules to diffuse and adsorb. As a result, they
helped to attain good sensitivity and quick response time. It was discov￾ered that porous In2O3 nanoparticles offer significant pore volumes and
surface areas, which generate many active sites for producing active oxy￾gen species (Li et al., 2019). With a 1 ppb detection limit, these sites sig￾nificantly increase H2S gas sensing, as shown in Fig. 13.11. Additionally, a
dense array of intrinsic ZnO NWs for H2S detection via a sulfura￾tiondesulfuration reaction mechanism has been disclosed (Huang et al.,
2015).
Mesoporous materials typically have pores with a diameter of
250 nm. They provide effective gas detection because of their vast sur￾face areas, open porosity, small pore sizes, and capability to cover the
exterior of the mesoporous structure with additional compounds. Quang
et al. disclosed a mesoporous Co3O4 nanochain-based H2S sensor (Quang
et al., 2018). First, hydrothermal synthesis of (Co(CO3)0.5(OH)11H2O)
nanowires was carried out. After that, a 5 hours thermal treatment in air
at 600°C created mesoporous Co3O4 nanochains with a rough surface.
The ideal operating temperature was identified as 300°C by examining
gas responses versus working temperatures. Co3O4 nanochains showed
sluggish chemical activity, leading to weaker reactions at lower operating
temperatures than the optimum.

308 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsAdditionally, due to enhanced activation at a higher temperature,
adsorbed H2S molecules begin to escape from the Co3O4 surface. The
manufactured sensor demonstrated rapid reactions and recovery to 1100
ppm H2S at 300°C. The response and recovery times were calculated to
be 46 and 24 seconds, respectively, for 100 ppm H2S. Compared to other
harmful gases, the nanochain structure’s specified surface area, smaller pore
size, and high number of mesopores make the manufactured sensor appro￾priate for H2S detection. Table 13.1 shows the nanostructured materials
that are used for toxic gas detection.
In the sections mentioned above, there have been no studies con￾ducted on biosensors used in the detection of toxic gases but rather
reports on sensors used to detect toxic gases. Besides, there are reports on
biosensors for detecting pesticides, the food industry, biological activity,
and water monitoring. There is scope for researchers to study biosensors
to detect toxic gases. However, some reports on the detection of nitric
oxides (NO) are mentioned in the next section.
13.5.4 Biosensing of nitric oxides
NO has been in an intense study because of the denitrification pathway’s
significance for the ecosystem (Canfield et al., 2010) and its role in

been reported to be 515 seconds. It is because NO reacts quickly with a
variety of biological compounds, including thiols (such as cysteine resi￾dues, glutathione), heme proteins (such as hemoglobin), O2, and other
radicals (such as the superoxide anion radical) (Wood et al., 2017).
Additionally, NO is found in a broad range of significant quantities, from
pM to μM. These characteristics of NO make detecting and analyzing it
especially difficult. As a result, suitable analytical methods for studying
NO should have a broad operating range and quick response times
(Schreiber et al., 2012). For these studies of NO metabolism and homeo￾stasis, both in vitro and in vivo, electrochemical biosensors are the pre￾ferred method for direct, real-time, selective, and sensitive measurements
(Qi et al., 2006).
A highly specific nitric oxide biosensor was created by merging micro￾peroxidase (MP) onto poly(terthiophene carboxylic acid) (MWCNT￾PTTCA) nanocomposite (Abdelwahab et al., 2010). On the probe catalase
(CA) surface, superoxide dismutase (SOD) was immobilized to successfully
protect from the interference of biological compounds such as H2O2 and
O2
2. Gold nanoparticle (AuNP) was electrodeposited on the glassy car￾bon surface to improve the sensing of the probe. Excellent results were
obtained from the CAS/SOD/MP/MWCNT-PTTCA/AuNPs probe in
the electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide. The detection limit for NO
analysis was 4.3 6 0.2 nM, with a dynamic range of 1.040 μM, as illus￾trated in Fig. 13.12.
Similarly, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), chitosan (CS), and mercapto￾propionic acid (MPA) were fabricated to form CS-MPA-AuNPs nano￾composite based on the cytochrome C (Cyt c) for the detection of nitric
oxide (Pashai et al., 2018). The interference from ascorbic acid (AA) and
NO2
2 was eliminated by a coating of Nafion. The analyzing techniques
such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry
(CV), and chronoamperometry were utilized to examine the electro￾chemical response of the resulting Nafion-Cyt c-CS-MPA-AuNPs gold
electrode. The findings demonstrate that the nanocomposite offered a
suitable environment for the biological activity of its components and the
passage of electrons between Cyt c and the surface of the gold electrode.
The modified electrode was discovered to have perfect electrocatalysis
toward NO. Likewise, the gold nanoparticle on a quaternized cellulose
(Au@QC) and poly(ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether) (PEGDGE) was
made for the immobilization of hemoglobin (Hb), and the direct electron
312 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationstransfer between hemoglobin and electrode (Li et al., 2014). Moreover,
Au@QC-PEGDGE nanocomposite film retains the bioactivity of hemo￾globin. Thus the modified film could provide a suitable microenvironment
for the immobilization of hemoglobin and improves the direct electron
transfer between hemoglobin and gold surface electrode. The results show
excellent catalytic activity toward NO reduction with a low detecting limit
and strong affinity.
A nitric oxide biosensor was fabricated based on Cyt c, a heme pro￾tein, onto a nanostructure conducting polymer (Alvin Koh et al., 2008),
as shown in Fig. 13.13. To avoid the interference of biological com￾pounds, namely, oxygen, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, Nafion
coating was introduced. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry
were used for the study to determine nitric oxide with the Cyt c-bonded
poly-TTCA electrode based on the direct electron transfer of Cyt c. The
nitric oxide biosensor was successfully injected into the rat striatum for
the NO determination after the administration of cocaine.
Likewise, the solubilization of MWCNT is done by functionalizing it
with azocarmine B (ACB). The functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT￾ACB) forms a film through electropolymerization to obtain polymerized

Electrochemical biosensors for toxic gases monitoring 313ACB (PACB), and an MWCNT/PACB nanofilm is formed. The
obtained hydrophilic MWCNTs-ACB and PACB were utilized to make
biosensor that offers additional active sites for the electrochemical oxida￾tion of nitric oxide (Zheng et al., 2008). The biosensor provides excellent
sensing response and selectivity, a broad linear range, strong stability,
reproducibility, and a low detecting limit. The obtained biosensor mea￾sures the nitric oxide released from the rat liver cells. The results indicated
that the biosensor might be used in NO monitoring systems, as shown in
Fig. 13.14.
In this study, the myoglobin (Myb) and multiwalled carbon nanotube
(MWCNT) were fabricated to form the Myb-MWNT nanocomposite.
The Myb-MWCNT-modified GC electrode is designed as an unmedi￾ated biosensor to detect NO, based on the electroreduction of NO
(Zhang et al., 2005). The electrode’s electrochemical activity showed that
MWCNTs could increase the rate of e2 transfer between Myb and the
electrode. The biosensor created by integrating Myb on MWNTs exhibits
superior selectivity when compared to MWNT alone since the

314 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsmeasurement based on electrochemical reduction of NO eliminates the
potential influence of oxidizable chemicals, such as dopamine, ascorbic
acid, nitrite, etc. The biosensor has strong stability, superior selectivity,
and is simple to fabricate, making it useful for quickly determining traces
of NO in an aqueous solution. Likewise, hemoglobin (Hb) is trapped in a
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium montmorillonite (NaMMT) clay
multiassembly that is immobilized on a pyrolytic graphite (plG) electrode
for the measurement of NO (Pang et al., 2003). Experimental findings
show that direct e2 transfer to the protein is accomplished in this multias￾sembly. MMT improves Hb’s ability to transport electrons and effectively
catalyzes NO reduction. This biosensor performs well in selectivity, stabil￾ity, and moderate sensitivity. The nanostructured materials for toxic gas
biosensing are mentioned in Table 13.2.

The data discussed above make it abundantly clear that electrochemical bio￾sensors’ success in the future depends on developing cutting-edge technolo￾gies at the micro- and nanoscale and on in-depth contributions from the
fields of electronics, materials science, biochemistry, and physics. Globally,
environmental contamination in many forms is a severe health hazard.
Therefore designing and creating biosensor-based measurement techniques
that can accurately identify different toxic pollutants from a wider spectrum
are also crucial. However, there are several downsides to biosensors for envi￾ronmental monitoring, such as (1) reaction time, (2) sensitivity, (3) selectivity,
(4) compatibility, (5) affinity, (6) stability, and (7) lifetime, among others.
These restrictions must be overcome for a competitive analytical tool to be
successfully implemented on-site. It is very important to note that using this
approach in creating such structures allows researchers to test out different
electrochemical reactions of various structured arrays of sensors.
The demand for rapid detecting biosensors will rise in the near future
due to growing public health worries about environmental contamina￾tion’s effects on the ecosystem. Despite much past and present research
into the development of electrochemical biosensors, it is still challenging
to develop better, more reliable tools to prevent experimental drift. In
this regard, comprehensive research is necessary to present the future
trends in the biosensor industry and other associated domains like bioelec￾tronics and bionanotechnology that will ultimately and significantly
impact the creation of new biosensing techniques in the future.

14.1 Introduction
It is possible to think of neurochemicals (NCs) as the words that are used
in the neuronal language. NCs are chemical messengers in the brain and
nervous system that play a role in regulating various physiological and
behavioral processes (Moon et al., 2018). Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
Huntington’s disease, autism, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis￾order, and other neurodegenerative diseases have all been linked to abnor￾malities in the concentration and dysfunction of NCs in the central
nervous system (Tjahjono et al., 2022). Psychotic diseases like schizophre￾nia, depression, dementia, and others have also been linked to these
abnormalities (glaucoma, arrhythmias, thyroid hormone shortage, conges￾tive heart damage, sudden infant death syndrome, dejection, anguish,
etc.). To diagnose and treat psychiatric problems, it is therefore particu￾larly important to understand the subtleties of neurochemical communica￾tion. Neurotransmission happens quickly (in milliseconds) and in a few
main steps. Initially, the transmitter is produced by presynaptic mechan￾isms. Ca21-initiated exocytosis is used to release neurotransmitters from
the presynaptic cell into the synaptic space. After being delivered, the
transmitter either binds to receptors on the postsynaptic cell or to autore￾ceptors on the presynaptic cell (Shirane & Nakamura, 2001). Finally, the
signal is ended by transporter reuptake into the presynaptic cell, followed
by intracellular catabolism or direct extracellular catabolism.
The characteristics of NCs include their mode of action (fast or slow
acting), their mode of formation (amino acid group, biogenic amines, or

All rights reserved.soluble gases), and their mode of function (excitatory or inhibitory). The
majority of NTs are challenging to categorize using the criteria listed
above. Moreover, in the determination of neurological illnesses, there are
yet no conclusive diagnostic techniques based on the number of biomar￾kers (Ou et al., 2019). As a result, unfortunately, effective treatments can￾not be developed. The complex chemical structure of the brain and the
neurotransmissions occurring in the brain for seconds are the main reasons
why it is difficult to determine brain biomarkers. Thus researchers are
interested in identifying chemical biomarkers of brain disorders in order
to better diagnose and treat neurological diseases (Matys et al., 2020;
Mirza et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022) (Fig. 14.1).
Several different techniques were utilized for the qualitative and quan￾titative determination of NCs, such as high-performance liquid chroma￾tography (Olesti et al., 2019; Jha et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020), gas
chromatography (Aragon et al., 2017; Maccarrone et al., 2001; Perry
et al., 2009), capillary electrophoresis (Huang et al., 2006; Kennedy et al.,
2002; Tuma, 2021 ˚ ), mass spectroscopy (Lee et al., 2018), fluorescence
spectroscopy (Migliorini et al., 2020; Sargazi et al., 2022), and Raman
spectroscopy (Eremina et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2022; Moody & Sharma,
2018; Vander Ende et al., 2019). However, most of these techniques have

on the right are postsynaptic cells. Neurotransmitters are represented by blue
spheres. Postsynaptic receptors are depicted in purple and autoreceptors in orange.
332 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssome disadvantages in the detection of NCs due to expensive instruments,
complex sample preparation procedures, and sophisticated operations. For
example, Aragon et al. developed the detection of serotonin (5-HT) in
zebra fish (Danio rerio) by using gas chromatography. In order to get gas
chromatogram data, a two-step sample derivation method had to be
applied (Aragon et al., 2017). Thus both sample preparation and analysis
were time-consuming methods with expensive instruments. Moreover,
fluorescence or Raman spectroscopic methods had limited neurochemical
sensing applications in in vivo studies and available studies of the literature
due to the interference effect of tissue absorption or autofluorescence. On
the other hand, in the last few years, electrochemical-based neurochemical
sensing approaches were one of the trending research topics in the clinical
and diagnostic field due to their fast responses, high sensitivity, the possi￾bility of real-time in vivo monitoring, portable and miniaturized sensor
size (Dinu & Apetrei, 2022; Lakard, 2020; Lin et al., 2022). However,
due to the trace concentration of NCs and interference from other bio￾chemical materials affecting biological matrices, electrochemical measure￾ment of NCs was a complex analytical procedure when bare electrodes
were used. To solve the problem, modification of electrodes with
nanostructured-based materials has been successfully implemented for
electrochemical biosensing of NCs (Cernat et al., 2020; Chauhan et al.,
2020; Karimian & Ugo, 2019; Lakard, 2020; Lin et al., 2022; Liu et al.,
2019).
Moreover, carbon nanostructured materials and noncarbon nanostruc￾tured materials are two categories of nanostructured materials utilized in
electrochemical sensing. Carbon-based nanostructured materials include
graphene, nanotubes (Pemmatte et al., 2020), carbon fiber, and fullerene
while noncarbon nanostructured materials include metallic/metal oxide
nanoparticles (Taheri et al., 2018), quantum dots, polymers, molecularly
imprinted polymers (MIPs), and metalorganic frameworks. As a conse￾quence, the focus of this chapter of the book is on the most recent devel￾opments and trends in neurochemical electrochemical detection methods
as well as the significance of nanostructured modification in electrochemi￾cal sensor research for NCs analysis. In-depth descriptions and discussions
are provided for the composition and structure of nanostructured materials
used in the research of NCs. To describe the benefits, difficulties, and pro￾spects of modification in electrochemical sensor research for both in vitro
and in vivo detection, the advantages, limitations, and prospects of nanos￾tructured materials-modified electrodes in NCs analysis are discussed.
Determination of neurochemicals 33314.2 The properties of some neurochemicals most
commonly studied by electrochemical methods
14.2.1 Serotonin
One of the monoamine neurotransmitters that are often present in our
bodies is serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (ST or 5-HT),
which is produced in the brain, stomach, and spinal cord. Many basic
behaviors and physiological processes we perform daily depend on the
proper functioning of 5-HT (Yin et al., 2021). Sudden infant death syn￾drome (SIDS), carcinoid syndrome, abnormal hemostasis, blood clots,
depression, anxiety, and migraines can all be caused by low levels of 5-
HT, but 5-HT syndrome, which is caused by excessive amounts of 5-HT,
can have serious toxic consequences and can be deadly. Given the above,
it is employed as a biomarker in the diagnosis of several diseases, and the
detection of 5-HT is necessary to comprehend the function of 5-HT in
several neurological disorders (Sharma et al., 2018).
14.2.2 Dopamine
Dopamine (DA) is one of the catecholamine neurotransmitters that play a
vital role in the operation of the mammalian central nervous system in the
brain, such as the kidney, hormone, and cardiovascular systems. DA irreg￾ularities are linked to neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and
Parkinson’s disease. Managing and monitoring DA levels are essential to
maintaining awareness of the analytical processes of the human brain
(Yang et al., 2015).
14.2.3 Epinephrine
Epinephrine (EPN) assists individuals in handling their stress and fear. EPN
is utilized in the treatment of cardiac arrest and anaphylaxis. The normal
level range of EPN in biological samples is 0140 pg mL21 (764.3 pmol
L21
) (Moon et al., 2018; Santos-Fandila et al., 2013).
14.2.4 Nor-epinephrine
Nor-epinephrine (Nor-EPN) plays a role as “alertness,” in the body’s fight￾or-flight response, body mobilization, which guides the brain in times of
danger. Blood pressure is raised by Nor-EPN, which further treats septic
shock. An acceptable level range of Nor-EPN in biological samples is
701700 pg mL21 (413.810048.7 pmol L21
) (Ribeiro et al., 2016;
Zhang & Beyer, 2006).
334 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications14.2.5 Glutamate
Glutamate (GLu), the precursor to GABA, the primary inhibitory neuro￾transmitter, is the main excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurological diseases
such as autism, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression
arise from deficiencies in the behavior of neurological pathways that use
GLu and its receptors. GLu is a key component of cellular metabolism, as
it is a very important step in the breakdown of amino acids and is related
to the transamination that occurs during deamination. For this reason, it is
essential to evaluate the amount of GLu in biological fluids
(Arumugasamy et al., 2020; Ye, 1987).
14.2.6 Tyrosine
Tyrosine (TYR) is an indispensable amino acid, a precursor of thyroxine,
DA, EPN, and Nor-EPN. Its level is normally in the range of
30120 μM in human plasma. Low levels of TYR may cause depression,
hypochondria, and physical and mental exhaustion. High levels of TYR
provoke poor liver and kidney function and intellectual disability
(Arumugasamy et al., 2020; Dinu & Apetrei, 2022).
14.2.7 Tryptophan
Tryptophan (TRYPN), also known as 2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl) propio￾nic acid, is a necessary amino acid that the body requires to create pro￾teins. TRYPN is an important neurochemical precursor involved in the
biosynthesis of 5-HT and melatonin (Prinith & Manjunatha, 2020). The
acceptable range of TRYPN concentrations in the human body is
2.055.15 mg L21
. Several types of depression and sleeplessness are
brought on by TRYPN concentrations below normal ranges, whereas ill￾nesses of the central nervous system, such as manicdepressive psychosis
with delirium and schizophrenia, take place when TRYPN concentrations
are above the upper limit value (Arumugasamy et al., 2020; Dinu &
Apetrei, 2022).
14.2.8 β-casomorphin-7
β-Casomorphin-7 (BCM-7) is a type of peptide with opioid properties. It
is thought to be associated with autism because it is found in higher con￾centrations in the urine of autistic children (Shahdost-fard & Roushani,
2020b).
Determination of neurochemicals 33514.2.9 Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine (ACh) is one of the key neurotransmitters that is produced by
cholinergic neurons. It is responsible for the transmission of neural
impulses and may be found in both the peripheral and central nervous
systems. It is possible for irregular ACh synthesis and dissociation to take
place when cholinergic neurons are not functioning properly. This has
the effect of inhibiting brain signaling. Changes in ACh concentration are
linked to the existence and progression of a wide variety of disorders of
the neurological system, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
myasthenia gravis, and other conditions of a similar nature (Bodur et al.,
2021; Khan et al., 2013).
14.2.10 Amyloid beta
Amyloid beta (AβO) refers to peptides of 3643 amino acids that are the
main components of amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with
Alzheimer’s disease. AβO molecules can form flexible, soluble oligomers
that can exist in a variety of forms. The oligomers are toxic to nerve cells.
It is even thought that these oligomers may cause misfolding of Tau pro￾tein, another important Alzheimer’s-related biomarker (Erkmen et al.,
2022).
14.2.11 Thrombin
A multifunctional serine protease known as thrombin (TB) is essential for
blood coagulation. It has the potential to directly participate in the trans￾formation of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, hence prompting
blood aggregation. In some studies, it is considered to be associated with
neurological diseases because it is found in abnormal levels in the blood of
Alzheimer’s patients (Konari et al., 2021; Negahdary & Angnes, 2022).
14.3 The significance of integrating nanostructured
materials for electrochemical neurochemical sensing
NCs are present in biological fluids at ultralow levels, and highly sensitive
detection techniques are required (Cho et al., 2020). Therefore, while
developing sensors, researchers apply various modification techniques to
make the sensor sensitive, selective, stable, and accurate. In this context,
the use of nanomaterials in electrode modification comes into prominence
(Balliamada Monnappa et al., 2019). A wide variety of nanomaterials
336 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsranging in size from 1 to 100 nm which are optically, electrically, and
mechanically superior to their bulk forms are used in NCs analysis, such
as metal/metal oxides, magnetic nanoparticles, graphene, carbon nano￾tubes (CNTs), polymers, and metalorganic frameworks (Kaya et al.,
2019).
The bare electrodes are chemically inert and have a low rate of oxida￾tion. For the electrochemical determination of neurotransmitters, these
electrodes have been modified using a variety of polymers. Due to the
components’ complementary impacts, the development of conducting
polymers aims to preserve each component’s beneficial features while also
enhancing their sensitive properties (Manjunatha, 2019). In NC determi￾nation, polymeric films not only increase the efficiency of the sensors
through their integration between the electron transfer mechanism on the
electrode surface and the subsequent charge transfer along the polymer
backbone but also ensure that interferences such as ascorbic acid and uric
acid are eliminated by electrostatic repulsion (Moon et al., 2018).
With a two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms organized in a
honeycomb-shaped network, graphene is an allotrope of the carbon fam￾ily (Hareesha et al., 2021). Due to its exceptional and innovative charac￾teristics, including its high active surface area, excellent electrical
conductivity, robust mechanical strength, and remarkable chemical stabil￾ity, graphene has garnered a lot of attention. Some graphene-modified
NC sensors have been published (Liu et al., 2019).
Several special properties of CNTs related to fast electrode transfer
kinetics, high surface area, and a large edge are widely used in electro￾chemical sensor studies. CNT has compositional heterogeneity and offers
ballistic conductivity and structural rigidity (Pushpanjali et al., 2020).
Therefore they are ideal for the development of microelectrodes for cell
and tissue sensors. In addition, making biodegradable CNTs for wearable
NCs sensor studies is an extremely interesting research topic (Wang et al.,
2020).
Various metals, such as gold, silver, copper, platinum, cobalt, nickel,
and iron, have been used in neurotransmitter sensing. However, the
greater preference for gold NPs (AuNPs) in versatile NC sensor applica￾tions is strongly associated with their easy chemical and biological modifi￾cations. In particular, the high affinity of thiols for the surfaces of noble
metals also facilitates the biofunctionalization of these metallic nanostruc￾tures by exploiting the widely developed metals. Another important rea￾son for the preference is that well-defined gold NPs have organic surface
Determination of neurochemicals 337chemistry for biological modification (Liu et al., 2019; Rawtani et al.,
2018).
Nowadays, nontoxic magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, which have a
large surface area and the ability to adsorb proteins, have attracted a lot of
attention. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been used to generate
biosensors based on aptamers, proteins, and enzymes with reported
enhanced detection limits, sensitivity, and response times. These platforms
were nontoxic, stable in high concentrations, and exhibited chemical
groups to allow additional coupling with biomolecules (Baig et al., 2021;
Hasanzadeh et al., 2015).
14.4 Application of a nanostructured electrochemical
sensor for neurochemical detection
In this section, the determination of NCs has been explained in detail
including how electrochemical sensors were applied. First, the determina￾tion of NCs with a nanobiosensor-based electrochemical sensor was
reviewed. Then, new trends in neurochemical sensing methods were
investigated by nanobiosensor-based electrochemical methods. Also,
Table 14.1 indicates selected studies based on the aptasensor for neuro￾chemical detection.
14.4.1 Immunosensor-based nanobiosensor for
neurochemical detection
The molecular recognition of antigens (often the target analyte) by an
antibody on a transducer surface defines the family of biosensors known as
immunosensors. Immunosensor-based electrochemical detection is a desir￾able technique for many NCs due to the unique selectivity and high sen￾sitivity that specific antigenantibody interactions enable immune sensors
(Felix & Angnes, 2018; Kondzior & Grabowska, 2020).
According to a recent study, Chaudhary et al. developed a label-free
nano-immunosensor based on molybdenum disulfidereduced graphene
oxide (MoS2-rGO) nanocomposite for the determination of 5-HT in sera
samples. First of all, MoS2-rGO nanostructured materials were synthesized
via the hydrothermal method. Then, another step included the functiona￾lization of MoS2-rGO nanostructured materials with 3-aminopropyl tri￾methoxy silane (APTES). Following that, the monoclonal antibodies
(anti-5-HT) were covalently linked to the APTES/nMoS2-rGO/ITO
electrode utilizing N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N0
-ethylcarbodiimide

overcoming nonspecific interactions, bovine serum albumin was dropped
on a modified ITO electrode. After the sensor surface was characterized
with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron micros￾copy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, the
obtained linear range value with the offered method for determination of
5-HT was 15000 nM, and the detection limit was 1 nM. The developed
electro-immunosensor was reported to remain stable for up to 8 weeks.
Also, the proposed method was applied to 5-HT-spiked sera samples
(Chaudhary et al., 2020).
Zeynaloo et al. designed a nonenzymatic electrochemical biosensor for
direct GLu detection. For this purpose, a nonenzymatic electrochemical
biosensor was created by covalently immobilizing a genetically altered
periplasmic GLu-binding protein (GLuBP) on gold nanoparticle-modified
screen-printed carbon electrodes (GLuBP/AuNPs/SPCEs). As shown in
Fig. 14.2, the response of the electrode was tested after each phase of bio￾sensor manufacturing by scanning the potential from 0.2 to 1.0 V at a
scan rate of 50 mV s21 in PBS (pH 7.4). When measuring under the
same conditions with the electrodes modified with AuNPs, gold oxide
formation was observed on the electrode surface at a peak potential of
10.57 V. Then, the immobilization of GLuBP, which carries two
cysteines at its C-terminus and allows the formation of thiol bonds
between the gold and protein, was achieved on the electrode surface, in
order to bind the Au nanoparticle-coated surface. Finally, a decrease in
the peak current recorded through the CV of the modified electrode was
found when the GLu selective protein was bound to the gold surface
because the presence of nonconducting protein on the electrode surface
limited the active surface area of the AuNPs. Also, this change in the
Figure 14.2 Electrode response of each phase of GLu biosensor. From Zeynaloo, E.,

344 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationselectrode surface was confirmed by using electrochemical impedance spec￾troscopy. When the analytical performance of the GLu biosensor is exam￾ined, the sensor responded to changing GLu concentration with a linear
response ranging from 0.1 M to 0.8 μM (Zeynaloo et al., 2021).
In another study, Adumitrachioaie et al. investigated a novel immuno￾sensor platform based on graphene oxide and chitosan (GO-chitosan) for
the effective detection of 5-HT. GO was chosen because the antibody
units contain carboxylic groups that form covalent bonds with terminal
amine groups. Thus it was used to achieve the immobilization of the bio￾component on the electrode surface. GO is negatively charged in water as
a result of the ionization of carboxylic acids and hydroxyl groups, while
chitosan contains amino and hydroxyl groups that can be protonated in
an acidic environment. Thus strong interactions between these two sub￾stances are possible, resulting in an increase in the stability of the nano￾composite film formed on the electrode after solvent evaporation.
A linear range of 10 nM100 mM and a limit of detection of 3.2 nM
were obtained for 5-HT detection. The proposed sensor was successfully
utilized for the determination of 5-HT in human serum, saliva, artificial
tears, and urine samples, as well as in the presence of different interfer￾ences (Adumitrachioaie et al., 2019 ˘ ) (Fig. 14.3).
14.4.2 Enzyme-based nanobiosensor for neurochemical
detection
Electrochemical analyses are preferred for the determination of important
NCs because they are fast, selective, and economical. However, some
important NCs are not electrochemically active. In this context, biosen￾sors with enzyme-modified sensing interfaces provide significant improve￾ments in measurement sensitivity as well as making neurologically
important but non-electroactive species measurable.
For example, Park et al. designed novel polyaniline-grafted reduced
graphene oxide field-effect transistors (FETs) for sensitive enzymatic ACh
biosensors. In this research, polyaniline was used to modify the rGO￾modified surface because it enhances local pH sensitivity and electrostatic
ACh enzyme immobilization. As compared to bare graphene-FET, with￾out any pH hysteresis, the grafted polyaniline (PG) increases pH sensitivity
(2.68%/pH) and offers adequate electrostatic binding sites for enzyme
immobilization. They report that they have developed the polyaniline￾grafted reduced graphene oxide field-effect transistors (PGFETs) as a sens￾ing capable sensor for ACh detection, with a nanomolar detection limit
Determination of neurochemicals 345and significantly increased sensitivity (103%) in the concentration range of
108 nM2 mM. Moreover, they demonstrated that PGFET can be used
as a real-time drug screening platform by observing the inhibitory effects
of rivastigmine on enzyme reactions (Park et al., 2022).
In another recent study, a flow-through biosensor with enzymes
immobilized in a disposable reactor constructed of poly(lactic acid) was
described using 3D printing technology for the analysis of uric acid and
TYR. When the analytical performance parameters of the enzyme biosen￾sor were examined, it was found that the TYR concentration was linear
between 2.0 and 10 μM and that the LOD of TYR biosensor was
0.08 μM. Also, the stability of the enzyme biosensor was examined by
continuously measuring the current for a 10 μM TYR transition. The
enzyme biosensor signal value showed a modest fluctuation of roughly 5%
in the first 2 hours and remained constant after 6 hours (Stoikov et al.,
2022).

346 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsBodur et al. designed for the determination of the amount of ACh, a
bienzymatic biosensor system containing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
choline oxidase (ChO) was prepared with a carbon paste electrode modi￾fied with synthesized dendritic macromolecule. In recent years, dendri￾mers have been used for enzyme immobilization due to their high
stability and low variability. As a result, graphite powder, nujol, and
PAMAM-Sal were mixed to create carbon paste electrodes. Then, a mix￾ture of 1.0 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA), 60.0 μL buffer solution,
10.0 μL AChE (200.0 units mL21
), 200 μL ChO (10.0 units mL21
), and
30.0 μL glutaraldehyde (2.5%) was dropped on this carbon paste electrode.
Moreover, the effects of glutaraldehyde concentration as a crosslinker, pH
of the buffer solution, and temperature of the ACh solution on the sensor
response were investigated to obtain the optimum enzyme biosensor for
detection of ACh. Under optimized condition, the bioenzyme sensor has
two linear ranges, 1.0 3 1028
1.0 3 1027 M and 1.0 3 1027
1.0 3
1025 M, and LOD of bioenzyme sensor was 5.0 3 1029 M (Bodur et al.,
2021).
In another study, Erkmen et al. designed an amperometric electro￾chemical nanoenzyme sensor based on tyrosinase enzyme immobilization
in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanoparticles-decorated
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) platform crosslinking with glutaraldehyde
for multicomponent detection of catechol (CAT), EPN, and Nor-EPN.
After optimizing the amount of PEDOT, GQDs, tyrosinase amount, tem￾perature, and pH parameters using each substrate, CAT, EPN, and Nor￾EPN, enzyme biosensor pharmaceutical dosage forms of EPN and Nor￾EPN were successfully applied in CAT analysis from serum samples. The
range of NCs determined under optimal settings was 0.00511 μM for
CAT, 0.212 μM for EPN, and 0.12.5 μM for Nor-EPN. The limit of
detection values for CAT, EPN, and Nor-EPN were reported to be
0.002, 0.065, and 0.035 μM, respectively (Erkmen et al., 2021).
Santos et al. described the design and implementation of an electrobio￾sensing platform for the detection of dopamine in environmental and bio￾logical fluid samples based on a carbon paste electrode (CPE) and AuNPs
modified with laccase enzyme (LaE) and glutaraldehyde (Glut). The
amperometric approach was used to employ the biosensor under ideal cir￾cumstances, revealing a linear concentration range of 80.00.62 mM with
a limit of detection of 0.6 nM. The capacity of the offered biosensor to
execute repeated tests over a lengthy period is a significant characteristic,
as is the ease with which the electrode surface can be cleaned and
Determination of neurochemicals 347regenerated by replacing it with LaE and Glut. The biosensor stored in
the refrigerator was found to retain 85% of the biosensor signal after 10
days (Santos et al., 2022).
14.4.3 Aptamer-based nanobiosensor for neurochemical
detection
A noteworthy and popular research field today is the use of aptamers as
target analysis capturers in neurochemical biosensing applications.
Aptamers are single-stranded, short oligonucleotides that typically range in
length from 20 to 100 bases (Erkmen et al., 2022). The aptamers were
artificially designed and synthesized by a high-throughput in vitro selec￾tion method called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrich￾ment (SELEX) (Geng et al., 2021). Also, aptamers have a 3D structure
that allows specific binding of the target analyte. The interaction between
an aptamer and its target analyte could occur in a variety of ways such as
noncovalent, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces. As a result of the dif￾ference in this type of interaction, different stems create 3D configurations
such as loops, hairpins, or G-quad structures (Arshavsky-Graham et al.,
2022). In the last decade, aptamer-based electrochemical sensors have
come to the fore in neurochemical analyses with their cheaper, more
robust, scalable production and superior selectivity due to their nature.
For example, Shen et al. developed a highly selective aptamer-based
electrochemical sensor for the determination of DA with a combination
of MIP and aptamer. In this research, they showed how each modification
step improved the sensor selectivity, as shown in Fig. 14.4, and the best
improvement was obtained on the electrode surface where aptamer and
MIP were combined. In addition, they modified the electrode surface
with AuNPs and reduced graphene for more stable and sensitive integra￾tion of the aptamer and polymeric structures. Moreover, in this study, the
selectivity of the produced sensor was examined using acetic acid (AA), uric
acid (UA), EPN, and catechol (CC) as coexisting compounds or structurally
related molecules. As shown in Fig. 14.4, regardless of the interference,
the dual recognition-based sensor consistently had the lowest current ratio
when tested in MIP/aptamer/AuNPs/rGO/GCE, demonstrating its
superior anti-interference performance. The developed MIP/AuNPs/
rGO/GCE sensor exhibited a linear range of 5.0 3 1028
1.0 3 1025 M
and a LOD of 4.7 3 1028 M for DA under optimized experimental con￾ditions (Shen & Kan, 2021).
348 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsWang designed a switchable electrochemical sensor for ultrasensitive
detection of amyloid-β oligomers, the main pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
disease, using a hybrid metalorganic framework decorated with AuNPs
and an aptamer specific to the target molecule after electrochemically
coating palladium on the glassy carbon electrode surface. In this study, the
effect of unlabeled anti-amyloid-β oligomers aptamer and tagged aptamers
with double helix switches on sensor performance was compared to form
triple helix switches (THSs). In this study, it has been proven that the
addition of another nucleotide chain to the double helix switches can be
used as a direct label signaling displaced probe, finding that it improves
the THS sensor signal, and is a feature that simplifies the process and
increases the detection efficiency in the analysis of amyloid-β oligomers.
The developed nanomaterial-decorated aptamer-based electrochemical
switchable sensor exhibited excellent selectivity and sensitivity for AβO
determination, with a linear range from 0.5 to 500 fM and a detection
limit of 0.25 fM. Also, recovery studies were successfully applied to the
artificial cerebrospinal fluid by utilizing a developed aptasensor (Wang
et al., 2021).

Determination of neurochemicals 349Jin et al. developed ratiometric electrochemical aptasensors for DA
detection by modifying a glassy carbon electrode with rGO, Nile blue,
and AuNPs complexes. As internal or external variables, such as sensor
concentration, ambient conditions, and instrument efficiency, may
readily affect the signal intensity of traditional sensors with single-signal
output, measuring it is challenging. Hence, the ratiometric aptasensor
strategy was applied to solve this general problem. The ratiometric
aptasensor measurement mechanism is based on the gradual decrease in
the Nile blue peak current density with the addition of DA, while the
peak current density of DA increases. Hereby, the proposed ratiometric
aptasensor demonstrated an excellent relation between lg (peak inten￾sity of DA/peak intensity of Nile blue) and the logarithm of DA con￾centration ranging from 10 nM to 0.2 mM via LOD of 1 nM (Jin et al.,
2018).
14.4.4 The last trends in electrochemical systems for
neurochemical detection
Understanding the origin of neurological disorders requires the simulta￾neous measurement of certain NCs. It has been demonstrated, for
instance, that DA and 5-HT can affect one another’s release (Shirane &
Nakamura, 2001). Hence, it is crucial to measure both DA and 5-HT at
the same time in order to understand how drug usage affects the release
of these neurotransmitters and how the body behaves with regard to
neurotransmitter levels. Zhang et al. developed a 3D biosensor con￾structed with consecutive adenine (CA) DNA on GO and deposited on
the AuNPs composite surface since in previous studies CA adsorbed gold
with a higher affinity for gold as shown in Fig. 14.5. Since mercapto
unlabeled DNA chains were used to generate 3D biosensor in this study,
production was both easier and more cost-effective. Moreover, they also
designed for the first time a micro-capacity electrolytic cell to adapt
microdialysis to an electrochemical system (Fig. 14.5). At the same time,
they were able to successfully integrate microdialysis into the electro￾chemical system while dynamically monitoring the changes in DA and
5-HT levels. Peak currents of DA and 5-HT at concentrations of DA
ranging from 9.0 1027 to 7.0 1025 M and 5-HT concentrations ranging
from 6.0 1027 to 4.0 1025 M were linear. The detection limits for
5-HT and DA were 7.0 1029 and 5.6 1028 M, respectively (Zhang
et al., 2019).
350 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications14.4.4.1 Smartphone-based nanostructured sensor
In a newly published paper, a smartphone-assisted electrochemical sensor
for sensitive TYR detection was described, including a screen-printed
electrode modified with carbon black nanomaterial and a commercially
available smartphone potentiostat (Fig. 14.6). Although they developed a
very simple and easily applicable nanosensor in this study, the wide oper￾ating range of the smartphone-based sensor was found to be 30500 μM
with LOD of 4.4 μM. In addition, before analyzing TYR from biological
materials, the sample was preprepared using various extraction cartridges
to eliminate the interfering impact of TRYPN (Fiore et al., 2022).
14.4.4.2 Microfluidic device-based nanostructured sensor
Besides the sensitivity of electrochemical sensors, the most important dis￾advantages are the difficulties encountered in multicomponent analysis.
However, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices, which are the mini￾aturized version of capillary electrophoresis amperometric detector sys￾tems, have been one of the more interesting electrochemical sensor topics

Determination of neurochemicals 351in recent years due to the detection of multiple analytes at once with high
sensitivity.
For instance, Roychoudhury et al. fabricated a paper-based fluid capil￾lary electrophoresis amperometric detector (CE-AD) microchip for the
simultaneous determination of chemicals such as DA, EPN, and 5-HT
(Fig. 14.7). Three therapeutically important neurotransmitters (DA, EPN,
and 5-HT) were separated and detected with the microchip used in this
study in 650 seconds, utilizing a modest sample volume of just 2 μL. To
perform the CE-AD method, 2 mL of sample containing equimolar
(0.150 mM) concentrations of DA, EPN, and 5-HT was added to the
sample reservoir after achieving a stable baseline signal in PBS. In the
simultaneous detection of three analytes, the limits of detection (LOD) for
DA, EPN, and 5-HT were found to be 2.39, 3.59, and 4.56 mM, respec￾tively (Roychoudhury et al., 2020).
14.4.4.3 Wearable nanostructured sensor for neurochemical detection
Wearable sensors have revolutionized the field of healthcare by enabling
continuous monitoring of various physiological and environmental para￾meters. In recent years, nanostructured sensors have gained significant
attention due to their exceptional sensing capabilities and ability to minia￾turize devices (Pereira da Silva Neves et al., 2018).
Thanks to their enormous potential for individualized healthcare diag￾noses and therapies, wearable biosensors have garnered a great deal of
interest. The primary driving force behind this interest is the enhancement

352 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsof peak separation and sensitivity in wearable electrochemical sensors
modified with nanomaterials (Lin et al., 2022). In addition to these bene￾fits, its quick and immediate data gathering offers a significant advantage
in the investigation of NCs. The fabrication of wearable nanostructured
sensors involves the integration of various materials, such as nanomaterials,
polymers, and metals, onto a flexible substrate (Ates et al., 2020;
Campuzano et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022). The use of nanomaterials, such
as carbon nanotubes and graphene, as sensing elements, allows for
increased sensitivity and selectivity. The integration of these materials
onto a flexible substrate, such as polyimide, allows for the creation of a
wearable device that can conform to the shape of the body. The detection
of NCs using wearable nanostructured sensors involves the use of specific
receptors that can selectively bind to the target analyte. These receptors
can be integrated into the sensing element, such as a carbon nanotube, to
create a functional sensor. The binding of the analyte to the receptor
results in a change in the electrical or optical properties of the sensing ele￾ment, which can be measured using a readout device.
For instance, Liu et al. produced a wearable sensor modified with
indium oxide (In2O3) nanoribbon and high-affinity nucleic acid aptamers
on the implantable sensor for the real-time detection of 5-HT and DA
(Liu et al., 2020). As shown in Fig. 14.8, after spin-coating each 3-inch

A PDMS adhesive layer was applied to each Si/SiO2 substrate. Subsequently, a PET
film with a thickness of 1.4 μm was applied as a lamination layer on top of the PDMS
material. The In2O3 nanoribbons were fabricated by employing a sputtering technique
onto the PET layer using a shadow mask. A titanium (Ti) adhesion layer with a thick￾ness of 1 nm was applied, followed by a gold (Au) layer with a thickness of 50 nm.
These layers were deposited using a distinct shadow mask technique in order to cre￾ate patterns for the electrodes of the source, drain, gate, and temperature sensor.
Subsequently, the biosensor film underwent delamination from the inflexible carrier
wafer. (B) Photograph depicting the array of devices in their original, unaltered state.

microscope image depicting a solitary device. The image showcases several compo￾nents, including the Au common-gate electrode, four In2O3 nanoribbon FETs enclosed
within a dotted blue box, and an Au resistive temperature sensor positioned from top
to bottom. The reduced contrast observed in the In2O3 nanoribbons can be attributed
to their inherent transparency. The scale bar shown in the image has a length of 500
μm. (D) The versatility of a sensor array is demonstrated by its ability to conformally

mm polyethylene terephthalate films were then bonded to polydimethyl￾siloxane via van der Waals interactions. To boost sensitivity and attain the
low LOD required for in vivo research, biocompatible In2O3 nanoribbons
with radio frequency sputtering were utilized to mimic the polyethylene
terephthalate layers using a shadow mask. Finally, aptamer was applied to
the determination of 5-HT and DA in artificial cerebrospinal fluid after
the aptamer field-effect transistor base was prepared. The working range
of the sensor for both NCs was linear from 10 fM to 1 mM, and the
LOD was 10 fM. The response time of the developed sensor is 5 seconds;
however, this time depends on the semiconductor analyzer and its soft￾ware (Liu et al., 2020).
14.5 Challenges and conclusion
The symptoms of many neurological diseases are similar; even when
symptoms appear, the disease is very advanced. In this very complex sit￾uation, since neurological diseases cannot be fully demonstrated in treat￾ment methods, treatments are aimed at stopping the progression of the
disease rather than eliminating the disease. Effective and reliable neuro￾chemical analysis methods are needed for the implementation of more
successful treatment processes, the prevention of the disease, and a
clearer understanding of the causes of the disease. The two main chal￾lenges encountered in the analysis of NCs are the rapid occurrence of
neurochemical processes and the overlap of electrochemical signals
belonging to NCs. We consider that the first challenge can be solved by
focusing on the development of real-time analysis methods and wearable
electrobiosensing methods. The use of a wide variety of different struc￾tures of nanoparticles and studies that do not cover selective surface
enhancement strategies may be the solution to another electrobiosensing
challenge.
In this section, we have discussed nanostructure-based electrobiosen￾sing techniques for the measurement of NCs to help establish fast, reliable,
and selective electrobiosensing processes. Moreover, in this chapter, we
have provided details about the most commonly analyzed neurochemical
by electrochemical biosensing methods. Then, we gave information about
nanomaterials used in bioelectrochemical analysis of NCs and explained
their importance. Finally, we shared information about biosensing strate￾gies and application examples when analyzing a neurochemical.

15.1 Introduction
Fundamental abiotic resources like air, water, sunlight and soil are
required for life's existence. Contaminating these abiotic factors by toxi￾cants affect the quality of life of all living beings. Toxicants are either
plant-origin, microbial-origin or anthropogenic (human), etc., lead food
toxicity. Fertilizers, food additives, dyes, and pesticides are examples of
anthropogenic toxins that adulterate food substances. The use of anthro￾pogenic toxins for various purposes, including industrial and agricultural
purposes, affect the quality of food substances, like cereals, pulses, grains,
coffee, wines, fruits, feed, and other products (Bansi D. Malhotra et al.,
2014). Natural toxicants also contaminate food substances, naming a few,
cyanogenic glycosides (several plants), solanine (green portions of pota￾toes), biogenic amines (fish), and fungi toxins (Bansi D. Malhotra et al.,
2014). These toxicants, enter the food chain through abiotic factors,
which leads to bioaccumulation and in turn, biomagnification. Eventually,
these toxicants in human affect hepatocytes, renal, and the immune sys￾tems (Bansi D. Malhotra et al., 2014). They also alters the detoxification
system, blood pressure, neurotransmission, etc. Consequently, the toxica￾tion process enhances mortality (death) and decrease natality (birth).
Biosensors are devices that combine a biological component to detect
an analyte and a physicochemical component to provide a measurable sig￾nal (Fig. 15.1). Toxins are detected by analytical methods such as chroma￾tography (HPLC, thin-layer chromatography, and liquid chromatography),

All rights reserved.ELISA, polymerase chain reaction, etc. (Gupta et al., 2021). These analyti￾cal methods are expensive and time-consuming, and the instruments are
not portable. Nanostructured biosensors are portable and inexpensive and
give precise and accurate results in short time. These portable devices can
be used for onsite detection and are widely used to examine dietary toxi￾cants and nutrition quality. They are also used for various other purposes
like examining air quality, pulse rate, pregnancy tests, identifying genomi￾cally altered organisms, etc. (Lim & Ahmed, 2016). These nanostructured
biosensors are used for both qualitative and quantitative purposes and dif￾ferent field experts like biologists, chemists, physicists, and pharmacologist
using this technology.
Using a bioreceptor (monoclonal antibody, RNA, DNA, glycan, lec￾tin, enzyme, tissue, or entire cell) and an immobilized sensing element, a
biosensor may detect a toxic component. The bioreceptor due to their
biochemical characteristics guarantee the high sensitivity and selectivity in
biomarker, detection, which also enable the avoidance of interference
from other bacteria or chemicals in the tested sample. The transducer
transforms the biomarker and bioreceptor's precised biochemical interac￾tion into a quantifiable signal (Fig. 15.1). Therefore, signal recording and
presentation enable the qualitative and quantitative toxin detection (Vidic
et al., 2017) (Fig. 15.2).

368 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications15.2 Types of toxins in foods
15.2.1 Bacterial toxins
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are the most prevalent nonprotein toxins along
with bacterial protein and peptide toxins which play an important role in
causing toxicity in living being. As many bacterial toxins are big, multipart
proteins with several binding sites or epitopes that may be recognized by
aptamers or antibodies. This is the most popular design to functionalize
the nanomaterials with antibodies or aptamers specific to the toxin. The
enzymatic activity of some toxins, such as botulinum toxin (BT), or par￾ticular receptors, such as the ganglioside GM1 receptor for cholera toxin
(CT), can be used to specifically identify the bacterial toxins in addition
to employing antibodies or aptamers as molecular identification element
(Sutarlie et al., 2017). An example, a simple sensor can be developed to
identify cholera toxin (CT) from solution using the red-to-purple colori￾metric shifts which brought on by the aggregation of gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) in solution. The CT B-subunit binds to simple saccharides such
as lactose that resemble the GM1 ganglioside receptor because of its high
affinity for that receptor. Thiol-modified lactose-coated AuNPs aggregate
and change color from red to purple by interacting to CT, with a detec￾tion range of 3122 g mL21 (Schofield et al., 2007). Bacterial toxins can
be detected via sandwich-binding with fluorescent probes since they con￾tain many antibody-binding epitopes due to the massive size of the major￾ity of bacterial protein toxins. Among them, the technique uses a
sandwich-binding approach for detection of CT, Shiga-like toxin, and
streptococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), using colored antibody-functionalized
Figure 15.2 Classification of the pesticide’s sensors (Saeed Ba Hashwan et al., 2020).
Real-time utilization of nanostructured biosensors for the determination of food toxins 369Quantum Dots (QDs) and an antibody-functionalized microtiter plate
well. The three toxins could all be found using this approach at concen￾trations between 300 and 1000 ng mL21
. Ribulose Bisphosphate doped
silica nanoparticles (RuBpy-SiNPs) on a microarray are employed in
a similar sandwich-based technique with a detection range of
0.11 ng mL21 to identify CT and SEB (Lian et al., 2010).
15.2.2 Fungal toxins
Mycotoxins are significant toxins predominantly found in food and enters
through the mouth, nose, epithelial contact, etc. Aflatoxin is an example
of a fungal toxin that mainly attacks the detoxifying organs. It is of four
types: aflatoxin B, aflatoxin G, aflatoxin M, and aflatoxin Q (Gupta et al.,
2021). Aflatoxins are insoluble aromatic molecules that exist in crop pro￾ducts and cannot be destroyed during cooking because of their rigid struc￾ture (high boiling point).
Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by fungi, and they
can potentially cause cancer, mutagenesis, teratogenicity, immunotoxicity,
and estrogenic effects in both humans and animals. Consequently, the
requirement for the appropriate regulation of food items and feed ingredi￾ents has been acknowledged. The study by Goud et al. (2018) overviews
the current advancements that have been made in electrochemical sensors
and biosensors that are used for the detection of mycotoxins. A compre￾hensive discussion is given on the fundamental features of the toxicity of
mycotoxins as well as the implications of their identification. Additionally,
various molecular recognition elements and nanomaterials are required to
detect mycotoxins (such as portable biosensing systems for point-of-care
analysis). In another study by Nirbhaya et al. (2021), an effective electro￾chemical biosensor based on graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets was
developed to detect the food toxin AfB1. Using a polycondensation reac￾tion, graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets were functionalized by a non￾toxic thionin (phenothiazine) redox dye. In addition, anti-AfB1 is
covalently attached to the Thn/g-C3N4/ITO electrode by employing
(1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide)-N-hydroxysuccinimide
(EDC-NHS) cross-linkers. The electrochemical biosensor that is fabricated
for detecting the AfB1 food toxin with a sensitivity of 4.85 lA log (ng21
mL) cm2 and an ultra-sensing lower limit of detection of 0.328 fg mL21
in a wide concentration range from 1 fg mL21 to 1 ng mL21
. In addition,
the newly created biosensor exhibited high repeatability and had a shelf
370 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationslife of 7 weeks. This method can also be applied to identify additional
mycotoxins, such as ochratoxin and citrinine, among others, using antibo￾dies specific to those mycotoxins (Sophiya et al., 2022).
15.2.3 Marine biotoxin
Toxins found in marine environments appear to rise in many parts of the
world. In recent years, palytoxin (PlTX), one of the most potent marine tox￾ins, is prevalent in many types of seafood. This has given rise to a new con￾cern in the Mediterranean Sea. PlTX has a great potential for toxicity to
humans; hence, there is a strong and urgent need for sensitive approaches
toward its detection and quantification. Zamolo et al. (2012) has developed,
an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence-based sensor to detect PlTX. This
sensor has excellent conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the specificity
provided by anti-PlTX antibodies, and the excellent sensitivity achieved by a
luminescence-based transducer. The sensor emits a concentration-dependent
light signal, allowing PlTX to be quantifiable. Biosensors are effective screen￾ing instruments that can be used in conjunction with confirmatory instru￾mental analytical methods to produce extremely specific, sensitive, and rapid
regular monitoring of developing marine toxins.
15.2.4 Phytotoxins
The term “phytotoxins” refers to harmful compounds that are produced
by plants. They include secondary metabolites which are hazardous in a
dose-dependent manner as well as allergens that are capable of causing ana￾phylactic shock in persons who are sensitive to them. The identification of
phytotoxins in food is becoming an increasingly pressing concern. The tra￾ditional methods for detecting phytotoxins are not sensitive enough and
are not user-friendly enough to be practical. Assays that are based on nano￾materials have demonstrated a high level of competence in both the rapid
and precise sensing of trace chemicals. When the analytes are anticipated
to exhibit considerable photoluminescent features, quantum dots (QDs)
have been used for a variety of scientific purposes. For the detection of
phytotoxins, it is employed. Quantum dot (QD)-based biosensors exhibit
significant promise for a diverse range of applications, encompassing both
qualitative and quantitative measurement of various physiological para￾meters such as blood glucose levels, pH levels, electrolyte concentrations,
blood gas composition, plasma enzyme activity, cholinesterase activity, and
erythrocyte characteristics. Biochemical characteristics play a crucial role in
Real-time utilization of nanostructured biosensors for the determination of food toxins 371clinical toxicology cases involving living patients, when prompt identifica￾tion of the poison is imperative (Ravi & Ganesan, 2021).
15.2.5 Heavy metals
Heavy metal contamination is one of the most important environmental
issues threatening world sustainability. Due to pollution, excess mining,
industrial disposal, and pesticides, there is a chance of heavy metal contam￾ination in water and food. Contaminated water (heavy metals) used in
food production processes has an adverse impact on human and animal
health. In cereals, salt, and other food products, metals (iron) are added for
nutritional purposes (Dharmappa, 2022). If its concentration is extreme, it
is toxic to mankind. However, in our body, metal concentrations are lim￾ited, and a high concentration may lead to toxic effects rather than normal
ones. The toxicity or cytotoxic effects of heavy metals are determined
using nanostructured biosensors. Al, Na, Ca, Mg, and K are not considered
heavy metals because their densities are lower than 5 g cm23
. Fe, Cu, Zn,
Mn, Au, and Ag are considered heavy metals because their densities are
greater than 5 g cm23
. They either activate or inactivate the enzymes
inside the cell, which leads to switching on or off the particular pathway.
They also produce ROS by interfering in the electron transport chain
(Odobaˇsic et al., 2019). Many efforts have been undertaken to develop ´
portable sensors for environmental heavy metal monitoring. Using nano￾particles and nanostructures in sensors improves device performance
regarding sensitivity, selectivity, multiplexed detection capabilities, and
mobility. Furthermore, as molecular recognition probes, tiny molecules,
DNA, proteins, and microorganisms have been combined with inorganic
materials to bind heavy metals selectively (Leonardo et al., 2016). This
study examines recent developments in optical, electrochemical, and field￾effect transistor sensors for the heavy metal detection. Colorimetric, fluo￾rescent, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, and surface plasmon reso￾nance devices are the primary optical sensors are used to detect the heavy
metals (Ba Hashwan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2013). Nanostructured biosen￾sors help to assess the quality of drinking water, waste water, etc.
15.2.6 Chemicals
15.2.6.1 Pesticides
Agricultural pollutants are unfavorable elements that endanger the ecol￾ogy, the environment, animals, and human health. It is necessary to create
372 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationspreventive and detection systems with high sensitivity and selectivity in
order to prevent their exposure (Yılmaz et al., 2022).
Therefore, it is necessary to design detection platforms that can offer
onsite detection via miniaturized and high-throughput devices. Surface￾enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a technique that combined with
portable spectrometers and detecting devices, may offer distinctive infor￾mation about the presence of plasmonic nanostructures. Chen et al.
employed an AuNP-dropped tape to extract pesticides from the fruit skins
in order to remove them from meals. When parathion-methyl, thiram,
and chlorpyrifos were sprayed on the cleaned food peels, they first put
25 nm AuNPs on the tape, which was known as SERS-tape, and then
pasted it on the apples, oranges, cucumbers, and green vegetables. The
sample surface's tape was taken off before SERS analysis with a transport￾able Raman spectrometer. Commercial adhesive tapes are compared for
their ability to remove pesticides and interfere with the SERS signal.
They chosen the “3 M transparent adhesive tape” out of the five com￾mercial tapes because it had a stronger SERS signal and less background
fluorescence noise (Ba Hashwan et al., 2020; Yılmaz et al., 2022).
15.2.7 Dyes
Food colors that are harmful include quick green and metanil yellow.
Using cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochem￾ical impedance spectroscopy, the developed nanosensor (calix8/Au NPs/
GCE) are evaluated for its capacity to sense. To improve the settings and
elicit the optimum reaction from the target analytes, the impact of a variety
of factors was examined. The calix8/Au NPs/GCE nanocomposite are
shown to greatly improve the signals of the chosen food dyes in comparison
with bare GCE due to the synergistic action of calix arene and Au nanopar￾ticles. Metanil Yellow and Fast Green Limits of Detection at the Calix8/Au
NPs/GCE are reported to be 9.8 and 19.7 nM, respectively, under optimal
circumstances. The created sensing platform are showed merit when they
are used to detect food colors in samples. Additionally, the developed elec￾trochemical platform's superior repeatability, reproducibility, and stability
showed that it may be used for actual sample analysis (Shah, 2020).
15.2.8 Plastics
Plastics are not compostable and can be found in everything, including
soil, water, and food. It is now one of the most common food adulterants.
Real-time utilization of nanostructured biosensors for the determination of food toxins 373In the past few years, people have heard a lot about plastic rice and plastic
eggs being found in food and sometimes stored hot foods and boiling water
in plastic containers. As a result, plastics are released at the nanoscale. It is
divided into two sorts based on its size, for example, microplastics (5 mm)
and nanoplastics (less than 1 μm). Because of their small size, microplastics are
eliminated from the body. However, nanoplastics are not expelled; instead,
they are retained in the organs. Furthermore, tons of micro- and nanoplastics
are dumped yearly into the ocean, and it leads to toxic environment and
contamination in the sea food (Yılmaz et al., 2022). The procedures that
have been used in the past to determine the presence of microplastics in
food are not reliable and also expensive. Because of this, the detection of the
food toxin via biosensors is becoming increasingly important in the current
context. Nowadays, three approaches are commonly employed to identify
microplastics. Both the hot needle test and fluorescent dyeing procedure are
extensively used to measure microplastics. Microspectroscopy is another way.
Microplastics can be quantified and classified using this technology.
However, to reduce interferences, microspectroscopy requires expensive
equipment and sophisticated sample pretreatment. As a result, the approach
cannot be used to acquire real-time data. Otherwise, the light source beam
width is wide in the microspectroscopy method. In the study of Huang et al.
(2021), they discovered the small microplastic detection using surface plas￾mon resonance biosensors based on the bio-affinity-induced particle reten￾tion and biosensor-based detection able to detect each small minute particle
(Ba Hashwan et al., 2020; Blake et al., 2001).
15.3 Conclusion
In conclusion, this chapter has explored the real-time utilization of nanos￾tructured biosensors for the determination of food toxins. The develop￾ment of efficient and reliable detection methods is crucial for ensuring
food safety and protecting public health. Nanostructured biosensors have
emerged as promising tools due to their unique properties, including high
sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response. Throughout this chapter, we
have discussed various types of nanostructured biosensors, such as nano￾wires, nanoparticles, and their applications. These biosensors have shown
excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and real-time
monitoring capabilities. Their ability to detect a wide range of food toxins,
including pesticides, heavy metals, bacterial and mycotoxins, is crucial for
ensuring the quality and safety of food products. The integration of nano￾materials with biological recognition elements, such as enzymes, antibodies,
374 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsor DNA probes, has enhanced the specificity and selectivity of nanostruc￾tured biosensors. The use of advanced nanofabrication techniques has
allowed for the precise control of sensor properties, leading to improved
detection limits and reduced interference from complex food matrices.
Real-time monitoring of food toxins is essential for timely intervention
and preventing the consumption of contaminated food. Nanostructured
biosensors offer the advantage of rapid detection, enabling quick decision￾making and mitigation strategies. Their miniaturization and compatibility
with portable devices facilitate on-site analysis, reducing the need for costly
and time-consuming laboratory procedures. However, there are still chal￾lenges that need to be addressed in the field of nanostructured biosensors
for food toxin detection. These include standardization of detection proto￾cols, validation of biosensor performance, and addressing the potential for
false-positive or false-negative results. Additionally, ensuring the long-term
stability and reproducibility of nanostructured biosensors is crucial for their
practical application. In summary, the real-time utilization of nanostruc￾tured biosensors holds great potential for the determination of food toxins.
Their high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response enable an efficient
monitoring of food safety. With further advancements in nanotechnology,

16.1 Introduction
Bringing biosensors to the literature is not far away. The first biosensor
dates back to the middle of the 19th century (Heineman & Jensen, 2006;
Sridharan et al., 2022). Leland L. Clark and Lyons brought an oxygen
electrode to the literature in the 1950s. Another later work was done in
1962, and in this study, he developed the first amperometric enzyme sen￾sor for glucose determination, and the word biosensor took its place in
the literature (Clark & Lyons, 2006; Heineman & Jensen, 2006). In 1975,
such biosensors were named “Model 23 A YSI analyzer” (Yoo & Lee,
2010). The general definition of a biosensor is a self-contained integrated
device that can provide quantitative or semiquantitative analytical infor￾mation directly using a biochemical receptor (Lee & Mutharasan, 2005).
In its simplest form, it is an analytical device capable of converting a bio￾logical response into a signal (Bollella & Katz, 2020; Hammoud et al.,
2022). Countless biosensors have been built for the determination of vari￾ous analytes in the fields of medicine, pharmacy, biology, chemistry, and
materials science, up to now. Moreover, biosensors are used in almost all
multidisciplinary fields due to their wonderful, specific, and selective
properties. Biosensors have low detection limits, short analysis times, and
cheapness. They have many advantages such as no processing required,
portability, and miniaturization potential. In addition, various biosensors
have been fabricated with nanoparticles, hybrid nanomaterials such as
conductive polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), and carbo￾naceous composite sensors which exhibit extraordinary behavior in terms

preferred for the determination of drug analytes with superior selectivity
even in complex matrix environments such as blood and urine. Therefore
electrochemical sensors, which have been constructed with nanostructure
materials, are widely used in the determination of extremely important
analytes such as pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, etc.
Today, scientists need new analytical methods that are on-site, online,
and portable, with rapid responses, to provide diagnostics. There is a need
for a selective and sensitive biomedical analyzer system that will serve very
quickly, especially in determining the factors that directly affect human
health. In addition, food analysis and environmental analysis are extremely
important, and fast analyzer systems are needed. Although chro￾matographic or spectroscopic methods are widely preferred for the single
and simultaneous determination of the analyte or analytes, these methods
have some drawbacks. These drawbacks can be listed as long preproces￾sing, too much solvent requirement, expensive equipment, and need for
expertise. Contrary to traditional methods, electrochemical techniques
and nanostructured sensors are used to inspire the world of science. As
they are fast, portable, selective, and sensitive, electrochemical techniques
are used for the determination of a wide range of analytes such as pharma￾ceuticals, pesticides, and inorganic and organic substances (Demir & ˙Inam,
2014; Inam et al., 2020; Isildak et al., 2018; Silah et al., 2021). In recent
years, all factors such as the widespread use of electrochemical methods,
the increase in sensor diversity, and the production of unique new materi￾als have produced analyte targets with excellent properties. Especially in
the last two decades, it is understood that sensor studies for the analysis of
drugs, food, and other agents in the field of electroanalysis have gained
great momentum. Moreover, more specific, selective, and sensitive elec￾trochemical sensors are needed for the detection of numerous analytes in
the complex matrix environment. In particular, the discovery of each new
material means a new horizon in the world of sensors for analyte analysis.
The production of new types of biosensors, their portability, and the
development of body-integrated sensors have become possible with
advancing technology. Moreover, the poor stability and short shelf life of
biosensors are improving day by day. For this, different nanomaterial bio￾sensors are being developed with hybrid materials. In addition, scientific
studies are continuing at full speed so that biosensors can be integrated
into human health in our daily lives. The main reason here is to provide
an early diagnosis with fast-response nanostructured sensors and to
380 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsintervene as soon as possible. Therefore online and portable sensors have
gained great importance. In addition, new superconducting and catalytic
materials and electrochemical processes produced in parallel with the
developing technology are examined in detail. In other words, the funda￾mentals of biosensor fabrication are well established, and scientists are
focusing on nanostructured biosensor building and analytical performance
improvement. As a result, it is inevitable to produce sensors that provide
more sensitive, selective, and on-site analysis possibilities in the next few
years. As a result, the nanostructured biosensor will be an indispensable
part of human life, the environment, and even the industry.
Biosensors generally consist of (1) an analyte, (2) a bioreceptor, (3) a
transducer, (4) electronics, and (5) a display. In its simplest form, we can
say that it occurs in the analyte, bioreceptor, and transducer, as shown in
Fig. 16.1, where analyte: the substance to be determined in the samples;
bioreceptor: a biological element or substance capable of sensing or rec￾ognizing a chemical change such as light, heat, pH, charge, or mass during
the interaction between the bioreceptor and the analyte; and converter:
the part of the biosensor that converts energy from one form to another.
According to the working principle, it can be divided into five main clas￾ses, namely, electrochemical, optical, electronic, thermal, and gravimetric
converters. Electronic: The converted signal is processed to prepare the
image. The electrical signals obtained from the converter are amplified

It is possible to make different classifications of nanostructured electro￾chemical biosensors built for the determination of organic substances such
as drugs. In particular, different groupings are made on the main compo￾nent such as analyte, transducer, and bioreceptor. In this chapter,

382 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationselectrochemical biosensors are classified according to the bioreceptor layer
in the biorecognition process. According to this classification, types such
as cell-based, affinity, aptamers, molecularly imprinted polymers, carbon
nanostructures, metal or metal oxide nanoparticle supported biosensors
and rarely preferred nanomaterials used in enzyme production are taken as
basis.
16.2 Electrochemical biosensors
Electrochemical methods are used in the qualitative and quantitative
determination of unlimited substances due to their extraordinary selectiv￾ity, excellent accuracy, and precision, requiring pretreatment, using very
few organic solvents, working with few samples, and being portable.
Moreover, due to its integration into combined systems, it enables the
development of binary analyzer sets. In addition, there are many superior
aspects of electrochemical sensors such as the development of flexible
electrodes, the production of miniature sensor kits, and the possibility of
field analysis. Among the electrochemical sensors, biosensors are known
to be a stand-alone multidisciplinary field. It has a place in different appli￾cation areas such as health applications, the defense industry, food analysis,
and pesticide detection. Moreover, with the unique properties of biosen￾sors, the development, commercialization, and new application areas of
electrochemical biosensors have gained great importance. In particular,
when the literature is examined, biosensor studies have increased with
great momentum in the last two decades (Figs. 16.4 and 16.5).
Figure 16.4 Systematic representation of nanostructured electrochemical biosensor
using quantum dots for the analysis of amoxicillin antibiotic (Wong et al., 2020).
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for estimation of pharmaceutical drugs 383The basic working principle of electrochemical biosensors is that the
electrical potential difference between the analyte and the bioreceptor
depends on the active concentration of the analyte. It consists of bioma￾terials such as enzymes, aptamers, MIP, and DNA as a bioreceptor. In
addition, carbon materials and new-generation nanosensors modified to
these material surfaces are also being developed. In this device, the current
or potential difference resulting from the redox behavior of the analyte is
used to determine the analyte in the sample. We can group biosensors
into five classes according to their working principles: (1) electrochemical
biosensor, (2) mass-based biosensor, (3) biological element, (4) optical bio￾sensor, and (5) metal oxide biosensor. Electrochemical biosensors are clas￾sified into five main techniques, namely, conductometric, amperometric,
voltammetric, potentiometric, and impedimetric (Figs. 16.6 and 16.7).
The construction process, stability, and shelf life of interfaces are the
most challenging processes in biosensor design. The interface structure,
which provides exceptional selectivity, must be specific to the target ana￾lyte, even in the complex matrix environment. In addition, the nanoma￾terials in the bioreceptor must be in an inert structure on the surface.
There is a need for an auxiliary layer between the biomolecules denatured
bioreceptors and the surface of the electrodes, where the biological ele￾ments are considered to be highly active. Different nanomaterials can be
created at this interface. Sometimes it is used on a solid surface such as sili￾cone, and sometimes it is made from a number of different substrate
Figure 16.5 Electrochemical oxidation of amoxicillin on graphene-based nanosensör
(Pollap et al., 2018).
384 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsmaterials such as paper or polymers. On the basis of these materials, it
plays an important role in increasing the stability of the interfaces, making
them more sensitive, extending the shelf life, and improving selectivity.
Therefore building a unique new interface is seen as one of the most
important steps in biosensor development. For this, applications are made
Figure 16.7 Production of nanostructured electrochemical sensors using porous
organic polymer (POP) (Yuan et al., 2021).
Figure 16.6 The quantitative determination of carbamazepine was performed with
polymer-supported nanostructured mipedot/GCE biosensor (Hammoud et al., 2021).
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for estimation of pharmaceutical drugs 385to nanostructured materials, and new types of biosensors are produced
every day. Moreover, due to the superior selectivity and excellent sensi￾tivity of biosensors, there are countless applications for both qualitative
and quantitative analysis of substances such as pesticides, drugs, and organ￾ics. The most basic factor here is the variety of biosensors that are formed
by combining different nanostructured materials or several nanomaterials
seen in the bioreceptor. It is possible to classify these nanostructured
unique materials as metallic nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials,
polymer, and metalorganic frameworks (Fig. 16.8).
16.2.1 Metal nanostructured biosensors
In recent years, the development of nanostructured materials depending
on technology has made a positive contribution to the production of bio￾sensors (Song et al., 2021). In particular, these nanomaterials with large
surface area, incredible catalytic properties, and excellent conductivity
allow the development of more sensitive, stable, and selective biosensors.
While sensors such as gold (Au), platinum (Pt), and silver (Ag) are used
directly as the main biosensors, more sensitive biosensors are sometimes
developed by creating electrochemical synergistic effects with different
nanostructures. Not only metal sensors but also metal oxide nanoparticles
(TiO2, ZnO, MnO2, Fe3O4, Bi2O3, La2O, VO2, and V2O5), semicon￾ductors (Se, Si), bimetallic nanocrystals (Ni-Fe2O4, Ni-ZrO2, NiCo2O4,
Figure 16.8 Metalorganic framework (MOF)-supported nanostructured biosensors
for the analysis of galantamine (Zhang, & Qiao, Cai, et al., 2021).
386 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsNi-SiO2), and different metal-based sensors are produced as nanostruc￾tured electrochemical biosensors. In addition to these materials, biosensors
with microporous structures and microdots (C-dots) have also been pro￾duced for the analysis of drugs in real samples. In addition, noble metal￾and alloy-based nanomaterials have been rare nanostructured materials
encountered in the literature, where they are used in the production of
biosensors due to their catalytic and biocompatible properties. In the stud￾ies carried out so far, nanostructured biosensor production has been
observed by coating different materials on the gold (Au) electrode surface,
while at the same time, more sensitive, selective, and stable biosensors
have been developed by modifying materials such as metal nanoparticles,
metal oxides, and bimetallic on the carbon electrode surface. Techniques
such as electrodeposition, drop drying, annealing, and physical mixing
have been applied in the development of nanostructured electrochemical
biosensors (Table 16.1 and 16.2).
Cao et al. in their study in 2018, an AuE-based nanostructured elec￾trochemical biosensor was developed for the sensitive, selective, high
accuracy, and precise determination of chloramphenicol (Cao et al.,
2018). Aptamer-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs-Apt) were
coated on the AuE surface. Surface morphology produced by scanning
electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT￾IR), and zeta potentials were elucidated. Then, electrochemical measure￾ments were made with cyclic voltammetry (CV), and they determined
the working range as 510,000 μg L21
. They also calculated the LOD
value as 1 μg L21
. In addition, the interference effects of some organic
substances were examined to examine the selectivity of the method they
developed, and they found that they had less than 12% effect on the
chloramphenicol determination. Finally, chloramphenicol determination
was successfully performed with MNPs/Apt/AuE biosensor in real sam￾ples such as milk and water (Table 16.3 and 16.4).
In their research, Neda Jazini and colleagues developed a composite
nanostructured biosensor for the determination of acetaminophen drug
substance known as an anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic medi￾cine (Jazini et al., 2020). The carbon paste electrode (CPE) surface was
coated with deoxyribonucleic acid (ds-DNA) and chitosan nanocompo￾sites/TiO2 nanoparticles as a double layer. Here, TiO2 nanoparticles have
developed a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive sensor, in which polymers
and biological materials are used together. Then, with differential pulse
voltammetry (DPV), they determined the dynamic working range of
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for estimation of pharmaceutical drugs 387Table 16.1 Metal-based nanostructured biosensors.

140 nM. In addition, to examine the selectivity of the method they devel￾oped, the interference effects of some inorganic and organic substances
were examined, and acetaminophen was determined with high recovery.
Finally, acetaminophen determination was successfully performed with
chitosan NCs/TiO2-DNA/CPE biosensor in real samples such as serum
and pill (Table 16.5 and 16.6).
16.2.2 Carbon-based nanomaterials
Carbon-based biosensors have an important place in electrochemical fields
due to their unique properties such as excellent conductivity, large surface
area, and stability. They are the most used nanostructured materials in
biosensor studies for many reasons such as large surface areas, stability, sta￾bility between biomolecules and the surface, unique conductivity, and
catalytic effects. While these materials are sometimes used as direct nano￾sensors, sometimes hybrid biosensors have been developed with different
materials. These carbonaceous materials include nanostructures such as sin￾gle- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphite, glassy carbon,
porous carbons, graphene, and carbon nanofibers. In addition, these car￾bonaceous materials have superior properties such as the ability to form a
film on the other electrode surface, the ability to be modified, and
biocompatibility. Moreover, it can be treated with nanoparticles, poly￾mers, and heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus to increase
the electrocatalytic activity of carbonaceous materials. Due to these
unique properties of carbon nanomaterials, it can be said that it is the
most important material in the production of biosensors. It is not only the
basic building block of biosensors but also the most remarkable nanoma￾terial in electrochemical study fields. Therefore, in the last two decades,
numerous studies using carbonaceous materials have appeared in the
literature.
Kummari et al., in their study published in 2019, developed a plain
functional group multi-walled CNT (f-CNTPE) nanosensor for the anal￾ysis of methotrexate drug, known as the chemotherapy agent (Kummari
et al., 2019). They illuminated the surface morphology of the proposed f￾CNTPE biosensor with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at different
magnifications. They found the linear working range of 0.11.5 μM for
the determination of methotrexate with the square wave voltammetry
(SWV) technique, and the LOD value was calculated as 2.9 nM. The

(2018)interference effect was investigated in the presence of organic molecules
such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine, and serotonin. No serious
effects were observed in the determination of methotrexate. Finally,
in vitro analysis of methotrexate was successfully performed in artificial
urine and diluted serum samples.
Nataraj et al., in their study in 2021, developed an effective, sensitive,
selective, and reproducible hybrid sensor for the anti-inflammatory drug
5-amino salicylic acid (5-ASA) (Nataraj et al., 2021). For the hybrid mate￾rial, the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface was first modified with a
multi-walled CNT. They then built the Ni-ZrO2/MWCNT/GCE com￾posite electrode using Ni-doped ZrO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Characteristics
such as electrode surface morphology and bonding type were examined
with advanced analysis techniques of XRD, FT-IR, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS). Afterward, they successfully carried out analytical validation stud￾ies. For this, the working range for the quantitative determination of 5-
amino salicylic acid with the DPV technique was calculated as
0.001500 μM. Based on the calibration chart, they found the LOD
value as 2.9 nM. They examined the selectivity of the recommended elec￾trochemical method in the presence of some inorganic and organic sub￾stances and determined that there was no obstacle to the determination of
5-amino salicylic acid. Finally, the precision and accuracy tests of the
method were performed in complex matrix environments such as human
blood, human urine, and tablets.
16.2.3 Polymer-supported nanostructured biosensors
The more important the polymers have in our daily lives, the more cru￾cial they are in the production of electrochemical nanosensors. It is one of
the most commonly used materials in the construction of bioreceptor.
The main reason for this is that they are easy to process, flexible and sta￾ble, and have unique physical properties. In addition, conductive polymers
contribute greatly to the development of nanostructured sensors. Natural
biopolymers such as chitosan have a wide range of uses in the production
of analyte-specific biosensors. It shows not only the conductivity of the
polymers but also the catalytic effect. In addition, it has an extraordinary
effect on the stability of electrochemical biosensors. Considering all these
incredible properties, polymers in almost all fields emerge as unique mate￾rials for nanostructured sensors. To date, numerous polymer-supported
414 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsbiosensors have been developed for many different analytes. In these sen￾sors, many polymers such as chitosan, levan, polypyrrole, and polyaniline,
especially polyethyleneimine, poly(bromophenol blue), poly-(3-amino-5-
hydroxypyrazole) (poly-AHP) are preferred. In addition to these, many
polymers that provide extraordinary sensitivity and molecular imprinting
polymers (MIPs), which are highly selective, are also included in the
nanostructured biosensor system.
In a very up-to-date article published by Hammoud et al. in 2022,
they developed a polymer-supported biosensor. In the first step, they
developed a molecular imprinting polymer as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio￾phene) (PEDOT) (Hammoud et al., 2021). Then, the MIPEDOT nanos￾tructure was coated on the GCE electrode surface by the CV technique.
The surface morphology of the sensor developed with scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was examined. The MIP structure is explained by
ultravioletvisible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. They determined the working
range of the active ingredient carbamazepine, which is used for the treat￾ment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain, as 050 mg L21 with the cyclic
voltammetric technique. The LOD and LOQ values were calculated as
2.04 and 6.2 mg L21
, respectively. They examined the interference effects
of valproic acid and phenytoin substances in the determination of carba￾mazepine and performed the analysis of the analyte with high recovery.
As a result, sensitive, selective, and reliable quantitative determination of
carbamazepine was performed with polymer-supported nanostructured
MIPEDOT/GCE biosensor.
In their study published by Mohamed et al. in 2019, a nanostructured
pencil graphite electrode (PGE) biosensor was developed using pyrrolidi￾nium acid sulfate (PAS) as an ionic liquid, containing lepidocrocite nano￾particles (γ-FeOOH) dispersed in N-chitosan carbon nanosheets
(N@CCNS) (Mohamed et al., 2019). The physical properties of the
recommended hybrid electrode are explained using Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scan￾ning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectroscopy methods. The CV, DPV, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) determinations of rivastigmine (RIV), an acetylcholin￾esterase inhibitor, were carried out using three different methods. For the
analytical performance of rivastigmine with DPV, they found a dynamic
operating range of 0.0030.09 μM and a LOD of 0.9 nM. The interfer￾ence potentials of guanine and adenine substances in the determination of
RIV were examined, and they were determined that they did not have a
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for estimation of pharmaceutical drugs 415serious effect. Finally, the polymer-supported γ-FeOOH/N@CCNS/
PAS/PGE nanostructured sensor and capsule and human serum have suc￾cessfully performed the determination of RIV in real samples and demon￾strated the precision and accuracy of the method with the analytical
application.
16.2.4 Metalorganic framework
In the last decade, a new porous metalorganic framework has been
developed. This substance of interest is formed by the strong coordination
coupling of metal ions and organic ligands. Due to the incredible catalytic
properties of these nanostructured materials, they have come to an impor￾tant position in the development and application of electrochemical sen￾sors. Moreover, unlike inorganic nanomaterials, MOFs are naturally
degradable and biocompatible compounds. Therefore nanostructured sen￾sors with MOF support are being built for the determination of numerous
biological agents such as DNA, RNA, and enzymes. It also shows excel￾lent affinity ability with the analyte due to its large surface areas and out￾standing catalytic properties. Like 3D chiral Ni-MOFs, it has advantages
such as structure-specific lattice structure, large surface area, and being
able to have different metal central atoms. Due to all these incredible
properties, it has emerged as an important sensor material in recent years.
The number of MOF-supported nanostructured sensors is increasing day
by day and creating new working areas for themselves.
16.2.5 Biological materials
They are mostly enzyme-based nanostructured sensors that make up an
important part of biosensors. Biological nanostructures such as deoxyribo￾nucleic acid (DNA), aptamer, cytochrome, and hemeproteins are pre￾ferred in the construction of these sensors. Enzyme-assisted biosensors are
used in the determination of numerous analytes due to their high selectiv￾ity and sensitivity. Moreover, biosensors using redox enzymes are the
most preferred nanostructure due to their catalyzing ability. In addition,
these sensors allow the simultaneous determination of multiple analytes
with two or more enzymes. Although it has advantages such as selectivity,
sensitivity, and accuracy, there are stability problems due to the activity of
enzymes. In addition, this situation affects the shelf life of enzyme-based
nanosensors. Stability and shelf-life improvement studies can be done
with other nanostructured materials. As a result, the sensitive, precise, and
416 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsaccurate determination of many analytes using biological materials is quite
successful. Enzyme biosensors have gained an important place in the liter￾ature and the scientific world.
16.2.6 Rarely used nanostructured biosensors
Nanostructured hybrid biosensors are produced by treating electrode sur￾faces such as fluorine tin oxide (FTO), carbon ionic liquid electrode
(CILE), carbon ceramic electrode (CCE), boron-doped diamond elec￾trode (BDDE) with metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, poly￾mer, MOF. In addition, nanostructured sensors based on platinum
electrode and nickel foam (NF) have also been built for drug-active sub￾stance determination. A PVC-coated potentiometric biosensor has also
been developed. With the developed nanosensors, different drug sub￾stances were determined with sensitivity, selectivity, and high recovery. A
new sensor was developed for tamoxifen determination by treating the
CCE surface with metal oxide with multi-walled CNTs. They found the
LOD of this sensor to be 0.132 nM. This value has a sensitivity that can
compete with traditional analytical methods.
16.3 Conclusion
Biosensors constitute an important part of drug analysis systems. On top
of that, it will be one of the most important analyzers shortly.
Nanostructured biosensors with fast analysis time, no preprocessing
required, high accuracy, and sensitivity is finding new fields of study in
different disciplines day by day. In addition, factors such as the extraordi￾nary selectivity, portability, and on-site analysis exhibited by biosensors
have gained an important position in drug analysis. In addition, hybrid
biosensors have been developed with materials with unique properties
such as metal or metal oxides, polymers, carbonaceous materials, 2D or
3D structures, biological materials such as enzymes and DNA, and MOF.
Due to the superior selectivity and excellent sensitivity of these hybrid
and nanostructured biosensors, the usage areas of biosensors are expanding
day by day. Biosensor analyzer sets are emerging in new applications in
large industrial areas such as food, defense, and engineering, especially in
the pharmaceutical industry. These systems, which allow on-site analysis,
are seen as promising developments that can be commercialized and pat￾ented. In this chapter, nanostructured materials used in the development
of biosensors were classified. Validation parameters such as the method
Nanostructured electrochemical biosensors for estimation of pharmaceutical drugs 417used for drug analysis, working range, and detection limits were exam￾ined. Analytical applications and interference types were explored in
detail. However, it has been recognized that more concentration is
required for biosensors to be included in routine analysis. The correct use
of this technology and the discovery of new nanostructured materials will
have a positive impact on the development of more sensitive and repeti￾tive biosensors. As a result, in this section, pioneering studies on nanos￾tructured materials in the production of a large number of biosensors for
drug determinations are discussed in detail.

17.1 Introduction
Biosensing technology is an outstanding detection tool that has received
popularity in recent decades due to its several advantages. Biosensors help
in developing the treatment of several health problems (Rodovalho et al.,
2015). There are different types of biosensors; among them, electrochemi￾cal biosensors are one of the special sensing tools which provide electrical
signals from a biological entity. The electrical signals can be current, volt￾age, and impedance. Based on electrical signals, there are four types of
biosensors such as amperometric biosensors, impedimetric biosensors, vol￾tammetric biosensors, and potentiometric biosensors (Kurbanoglu et al.,
2020; Singh, Sharma, et al., 2021). Clark fabricated an electrochemical
biosensor for the first time to monitor the level of glucose in the blood
serum of humans (Wang, 2001). The electrochemical biosensors have
been designed to detect numerous biological entities such as proteins,
enzymes, antibodies, viruses, illicit drugs, microorganisms, and toxic sub￾stances. Moreover, electrochemical biosensors have become more popular
in the field of clinical and forensic analysis with a more significant number
of relevant applications. Besides, electrochemical biosensors provide alter￾native methods to the diagnosis of viral antigens or viral nucleic acids and
can contribute to the development of point-of-care (POC) challenging
(Bahadır & Sezgintürk, 2015; Kudr et al., 2021). The use of POCT
approaches is valuable due to the prospect of immediate diagnosis and
treatment of the patients within minutes or 1 h at the clinical and forensic
levels (Alemu & Alemu, 2022; Quesada-González & Merkoçi, 2018;
Wang, 2006).

All rights reserved.Electrochemical biosensors have been fabricated by integrating biologi￾cal recognition elements with electronic transduction elements, as shown
in Fig. 17.1. The electrode is a critical component in this type of sensor as
it controls the bioagents and flow of electrons. The association of nano￾technology with biosensors increases sensibility since nanoparticles (NPs)
improve electrochemical reactions and provide signal amplification (Da
Silva-Junio et al., 2022). Because nanomaterials have a large surface area
which increases the loading capacity and improves the mass transport of
reactants to achieve high performance in terms of sensitivity, on the other
hand, the biorecognition layer contributes to the high selectivity of the
biosensors due to specific recognition of biomolecules (Hai et al., 2020;
Magner, 1967; Thévenot et al., 2001). These advantages make the elec￾trochemical biosensors to be used in various fields such as food safety,
environmental monitoring, toxicological analysis, etc.
People have been fascinated for years by the beauty of the 400 CE
Lycurgus Cup and the power and beauty of a Damascus steel blade, but it
has only been recently that we have learned the secret behind these
incredible ancient artifacts: nanomaterials (Mahbub & Hoque, 2020).
A substance is referred to as a nanomaterial if it has at least one dimension
in three dimensions or if its composition has been scaled down to the
nanometer scale (1100 nm) (Wu et al., 2014). Richard Adolf
Zsigmondy coined the phrase “nanometer” for the first time in 1914. In
1959, during his speech at the annual meeting of the American Physical
Society, American physicist Richard Feynman proposed the specific idea
of nanotechnology (Abu-Salah et al., 2010; Pandey et al., 2008; Pérez￾López & Merkoçi, 2011; Santamaria, 2012).
Nanomaterials have become quite popular due to their superior per￾formance over their bulk equivalents and tunable qualities (e.g., physical,
Figure 17.1 Electrochemical biosensors and their signal transduction principle. From
Kim, T. H. (2021). Toward emerging innovations in electrochemical biosensing technol￾ogy. Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11(6). https://doi.org/10.3390/app11062461.
430 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationschemical, biological, etc.). This is mostly due to their surface effect, rela￾tively small size, and quantum confinement effect (Chen et al., 2016). It is
essential to classify nanomaterials so that their characteristics and uses may
be thoroughly investigated. To identify nanomaterials, however, a num￾ber of aspects can be taken into account, including their physical and
chemical characteristics, manufacturing methods, dimensionality, homoge￾neity, composition, and so on (Pandey et al., 2008; Pérez-López &
Merkoçi, 2011; Sudha et al., 2018). According to the perspective of this
chapter, we divide nanomaterials into four groups depending on their
chemical makeup: (1) carbon-based, (2) organic-based, (3) inorganic￾based, and (4) composite-based nanomaterials (Sudha et al., 2018).
17.2 Nanostructured materials
17.2.1 Carbon nanotubes
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are made from graphene nanofoils that have
hollow coils of atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Single-layered
CNTs and multilayered CNTs have diameters as small as 0.7 and 100 nm,
respectively, and lengths that typically range from a few micrometers to
several millimeters. The ends may be closed with half-fullerene molecules,
or they may be hollow (Jana et al., 2021). They resemble the structure of
a graphite sheet sliding over one another (Song et al., 2018). The rolled
sheets are known as single-walled, double-walled, or multi-walled carbon
nanotubes because they can have one, two, or numerous walls (Rubianes
& Rivas, 2005; Stankovich et al., 2006; Yaragalla et al., 2018).
The CNT is typically divided into two varieties, achiral and chiral, as
is customary practice. Whereas achiral tubules have a cylindrical symmetry
and are further classified into two varieties, chiral tubules have a screw
symmetry. Two of each hexagon’s edges parallel the cylinder axis in one
of the achiral CNT variants. They are referred to as zigzag nanotubes.
The other variety of achiral CNTs, dubbed “armchair nanotubes,” has
two of each hexagon’s edges perpendicular to the cylinder axis (Justino
et al., 2013; Zaporotskova et al., 2016). The structures of eight allotropes
of carbon are shown in Fig. 17.2.
The CNT has several exceptional qualities, including high strength
due to its hexagonal structure, unique electronic properties due to the
free electron made available after sp2 hybridization, and ease of functiona￾lization with various organic molecules, which enables selective interac￾tion with various analytes (Huang et al., 2011). CNTs can be employed
Advanced nanostructured material-based biosensors in clinical and forensic diagnosis 431as probe tips in various chemical and biological applications due to their
simple functionalization (Mahbub & Hoque, 2020). One of the most
advanced applications of CNT is the usage of sensor devices. These sen￾sors are recognized to be the next-generation building block for selective
and sensitive biosensing systems (Zaporotskova et al., 2016). CNTs with
field-effect transistors (FETs) and antibodies were used to fabricate label￾free ultrasensitive biosensors to detect immunoglobulin G (HIgG)
(Maehashi & Matsumoto, 2009). In another study, CNTs coupled with
metalsemiconductor FET showed a more sensitive result than CNTs￾FET biosensors to detect amyloid-β in human serum for early-stage diag￾nosis of Alzheimer’s disease (Oh et al., 2013).

org/10.1016/j.arabjc.2010.08.022.
432 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsMoreover, CNTs are modified with other nanomaterials to develop
more reliable biosensors to target clinically significant biomarkers for the
diagnosis of various diseases. CNTs-AuNPs-graphene and antibodies Ab1-
based biosensors have been used to determine human chorionic gonado￾tropin clinically (Lu et al., 2012). An immunosensor based on CNTs￾AuNPs and horseradish peroxidase was successfully employed to detect
HIgG in the clinical laboratory (Cui et al., 2008). Furthermore, Si/SiO2/
CNTs/anti-SARS-Cov-2 S1 biosensor has been used to detect SARS￾Cov-2 S1 from patients’ saliva (Zamzami et al., 2022). A CNTs-based
biosensor can also be used to diagnose dengue fever for medical applica￾tions. Dengue antibody is immobilized on the surface of AuNPs/CNTs
nanocomposite to target dengue virus 2 NS1 (Palomar et al., 2020). The
literature review exhibited that the CNTs and modified CNTs with other
nanomaterials have broad and efficient clinical and forensic diagnosis
applications (Amrutha et al., 2019; Hareesha et al., 2021; Prinith &
Manjunatha, 2020; Pushpanjali et al., 2020).
17.2.2 Nanowires
Nanowires are gaining interest from people seeking to exploit
nanoscience and nanotechnology. Nanowires have one unconfined direc￾tion for electrical conduction and two quantum-confined approaches.
Nanowires are anticipated to display markedly different optical, electrical,
and magnetic properties to their bulk 3D crystalline counterparts due to
their distinct density of electronic states (Dresselhaus et al., 2010). The
manufacturing of nanowires has traditionally been separated into top￾down and bottom-up methodologies (Hobbs et al., 1975).
Vaporliquidsolid, frequently utilized in semiconductor research, is the
primary method to accomplish bottom-up approaches. This technique
might provide small, high-quality nanowires with sizes as small as 10 nm
(Jia et al., 2019). This method still has several drawbacks, such as metal
contamination, random orientation, and the inability to integrate with
COMS technology, which could result in a lower fabrication yield and
inadequate device uniformity.
In contrast, top-down production is CMOS-suitable and can create
nanowires with extreme precision in their dimensions, with the potential
to scale down to 3 nm and beyond (Noroozi et al., 2017; Radamson
et al., 2017). The top-down strategy might offer better alignment at the
nanoscale. Top-down technologies employ nanofabrication, which
Advanced nanostructured material-based biosensors in clinical and forensic diagnosis 433includes lithography, cleaning, functionalization, passivation, and metalli￾zation, to create NW arrays (Akbari-Saatlu et al., 2020).
Nanowires can be divided into semiconducting, metallic, and dielectric
types based on electronic characteristics and chemical composition.
Metallic and dielectric nanowires are suitable for photonic and plasmonic
waveguiding applications, while semiconducting nanowires show promise
for applications in sensing and light generation (Dasgupta et al., 2014; Li
et al., 2018; Quan et al., 2019).
17.2.3 Nanoparticles
A new strategy for reliable real-world applications of sensors uses nanopar￾ticles (NPs) with sizes between 10 and 100 nm (Xiao et al., 2012).
Nanoparticles that are smaller than a nanometer now exhibit distinctive
and noticeably different chemical, physical, and biological characteristics
from their macro-sized counterparts owing to their large surface-to￾volume ratios. In light of this, extensive study has been done on these
nanoparticles (Abou El-Nour et al., 2010; Geng et al., 2022).
Several scientists have developed a variety of physical and chemical
processes to produce nanoparticles that can be used in a wide range of
applications. Physical nanoparticle synthesis methods include a photo, ion
beam, electron (Chen & Pépin, 2001; Voldman et al., 1999), dip-pen
lithography (Piner et al., 1999), electrochemical synthesis, microcontact
printing, and nanoimprint lithography (Mandal et al., 2006). The first step
in all chemical reactions is the reduction of metal ions to metal atoms,
which is then followed by a regulated atom mass (Sotiropoulou et al.,
2008). Most of the chemical and physical processes used to synthesize NPs
are quite expensive (Boroumand Moghaddam et al., 2015). Biological
techniques of NP synthesis involving microbes, enzymes, fungi, and plants
or plant extracts are eco-friendly alternatives to chemical and physical
approaches (Hasan, 2015; Islam et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Various
techniques used for nanoparticle synthesis are shown in Fig. 17.3.
Among the various uses, the utilization of nanoparticles for biosensing
is gaining more attention in several fields, including clinical diagnosis and
forensic applications (Agasti et al., 2010). The trendiest subjects in nano￾technology currently are nanoparticles’ roles in proteins, DNA, and even
cell sensor technology (De la Escosura-Muñiz et al., 2010). Various NPs
such as Ag, Au, ZnO, Pt, and Cu have been used to develop biosensors
for clinical and forensic applications (He et al., 2022; Umar et al., 2009;
434 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsYu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2011). NP-based biosensors will be an admi￾rable alternative for the detection and diagnosis of disease biomarkers.
ZnO NPs and CoFe2O4 NPs with DNA showed excellent efficiency in
detecting miRNA in clinical and medical analysis. Au and CNTs linked
with acetylcholinesterase and glucuronyl transferase were used to detect
AB-Fubinaca and AB-Pinaca (Brenes et al., 2022). Moreover, the Ag
nanocluster and hybridization chain reaction-based biosensor has been
designed to determine sex by targeting the DYS14 marker located on the
Y chromosome (Bazzi et al., 2023). NP-based biosensors were found to
be a promising tool for the determination of postmortem interval in
forensic studies (Cordeiro et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2020).
Hepatitis B virus is a big challenge worldwide, which needs a sensitive
method to detect this virus to treat and prevent it. In this regard, a biosen￾sor based on multi-cross displacement amplification-linked polymer NPs
has been used to diagnose HBV in blood samples (Jiao et al., 2019).
Figure 17.3 Various techniques used for nanoparticles synthesis.
Advanced nanostructured material-based biosensors in clinical and forensic diagnosis 435Multi-cross displacement amplification coupled with NPs has potential clinical
application to the diagnosis of IS6110 and IS1081 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Chen et al., 2021). A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification linked with NP-based biosensor assay has been successfully devel￾oped for rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 in the first-line field, pub￾lic health, and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challenged regions
(Zhu et al., 2020). Furthermore, magnetic NP-based biosensors have been
designed to detect cancer biomarkers (Koo et al., 2021). A biosensor based on
TiO2 and MoS2 NPs and decorated with acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibitor
is designed to detect organophosphorus pesticides in forensic visceral samples
(Singh, Balayan, et al., 2021). Gold NP-based DNA probes are used for detect￾ing specific DNA sequences (Zhang & Jiang, 2012). AgNPs decorated with
antihuman albumin antibodies have been employed to detect albumin in the
urine sample from preeclampsia patients. This method opens a new way for
clinical analysis applications (Lai et al., 2010). In addition, bimetallic NP-based
biosensors are a burgeoning field for real-world clinical applications (Kannan &
Maduraiveeran, 2022; Mao et al., 2022). Literature studies revealed that
nanoparticle-based biosensors hold great promise for the application of NPs to
detect biomarkers in clinical and forensic analysis.
17.2.4 Fullerenes
Fullerene C60 was produced initially via laser evaporation of graphite in
1985 (Kroto et al., 1985). Fullerenes are carbon-based molecular allotrope
composed of a three-dimensional closed cage constructed of six- and five￾membered rings with varying numbers of hexagons and 12 pentagons,
depending on the size of the fullerenes (Shetti et al., 2021; Troshin &
Lyubovskaya, 2008; Zaghmarzi et al., 2017). The C60 has a total of 240
electrons, of which up to 180 are required to form the three sigma bonds
between each carbon atom and its neighbors. These electrons are far less
energetic than the Fermi level (Forró & Mihály, 2001). These electrons
do not actually generate conduction; instead, they tend to stabilize the
structure. The remaining 60 electrons in the molecule are distributed
evenly among its orbitals due to the less compact carboncarbon p orbi￾tals, which are almost identical to the p orbitals of the graphene plane
(Afreen et al., 2015; Shetti et al., 2021).
There are presently numerous methods for creating C60, including
combustion, laser irradiation (Heath et al., 1987), chemical vapor deposi￾tion, arc discharge, and carbon sources vaporization (Mojica et al., 2013).
436 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsIn addition to C60, other fullerenes, such as C80, C70, C20, and even
larger molecules, were also identified following C60 (Felfli & Msezane,
2018). Fullerenes have received a lot of attention in developing biosensors
owing to their increased electron transfer kinetics, high surface-to-volume
ratio, and biocompatibility (Sutradhar & Patnaik, 2017). Drugs, DNA,
glucose, ATP, and many other biological substances can all be detected
using nanocomposites based on fullerenes or, more specifically, C60
(Bezzon et al., 2019).
17.2.5 Carbon dots
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), often known simply as carbon dots
(CDs), are tiny, luminous carbon nanoparticles with diameters less than
10 nm (Du, Guo, 2016; Namdari et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2006; Yulong &
Xinsheng, 2016). Based on their fundamental structures and morpholo￾gies, CQDs can be divided into two types in terms of their structure. The
core structure can be either amorphous or crystalline, and the surface shell
can contain various polar or nonpolar groups, from short atomic chains to
large functional groups (Sciortino et al., 2018). They have garnered much
interest in recent years because of their outstanding chemical stability,
strong conductivity, luminescence, and broadband optical absorption
capabilities (Namdari et al., 2017).
Photoluminescence characteristics of carbon dots provide clear routes
for sensing applications. Many applications of carbon dots in bio- and
chemical sensing are suggested by well-known fluorescent system dynam￾ics, including energy transfer, fluorescence quenching, and fluorescent
spectra sensitivity to molecular surroundings (Lim et al., 2015). The viabil￾ity of employing CQDs in sensing applications for monitoring environ￾mental pollutants, including biomolecules, cations, anions, and tiny
organic contaminants, has been extensively researched (Lim et al., 2015).
Carbon dots-based compositions are ideal for the visual enhancement of
latent fingerprints, affording improved contrast against multicolored and
patterned backgrounds (Verhagen & Kelarakis, 2020). Fingerprint scrutiny
has played an important role in criminal inquiry for more than a long
period and is also crucial in distinguishing victims of disasters and the most
extensively employed technique of biometric ID (Milenkovic et al.,
2019). Carbon dots and other quantum dots are helpful in expanding the
forensic toolkit because these dots, in the form of powders or spray, can
combine with fingerprint residue and increase visibility (Hazarika &
Advanced nanostructured material-based biosensors in clinical and forensic diagnosis 437Russell, 2012). Furthermore, they are not only an ideal fluorescent probe
or biosensing platform but also can be employed as a unique label for
bioimaging for clinical purposes (Jiang et al., 2021; Pirsaheb et al., 2019).
CD biosensors exhibited good reproducibility, consistent stability, and
acceptable precision; therefore they can provide many potential applica￾tions for detecting tumor makers in clinical research (Wu et al., 2013).
17.3 Applications of nanobiosensors in clinical and forensic
diagnosis
The trace-level detection of illicit drugs is a big challenge in forensic anal￾ysis because the abuse of illicit drug addiction is a worldwide social and
public health problem (Akgönüllü et al., 2020). Therefore reliable tools
for detecting drug abuse are critically important for the current society.
Conventional techniques are used to analyze illicit drugs, but these meth￾ods have some disadvantages, such as being time-consuming, expensive,
and inconvenient for on-site analysis and long-term sample preparation
prior to analysis. On the other hand, electrochemical nanobiosensors offer
highly attractive analytical tools due to their multiple specificities, low
cost, on-site analysis, and speed (Leong et al., 2022; Majeed et al., 2020).
In other words, it can be said that affinity-type biosensors have emerged
as creditable platforms for the detection of illicit drugs for forensic and
clinical purposes.
In addition, electrochemical biosensors are also employed to detect
toxic substances and microorganisms in clinical and forensic samples such
as water, foodstuffs, and biological samples (Gupta et al., 2021). The most
common toxic metals, such as arsenic in the form of arsenate(V) and arse￾nite(III), can affect the environment and accumulate in the body through
the food chain, significantly menacing human health due to their carcino￾genicity and hypertoxicity. Different studies have been reported to detect
these toxic metal ions in several samples; such as the CeO2-DNA nanop￾robe was successfully fabricated to detect arsenic(V) in water samples
(Yang et al., 2020). In another study, AuNPs were modified with
Alcaligenes faecalis bacteria to analyze arsenic(III) with LOD of 0.66 and
1.84 μM in pH 5 7.0 and pH 5 12, respectively, in the Loa river water
sample (Nunez et al., 2021) (Fig. 17.4).
In another work, the calibration curve ranged linearly between 10 and
104 nM, and a LOD of 5 nM was obtained with AuNPs immobilized
with arsenite oxidase on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
438 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications(Tabibi et al., 2022). Moreover, an aptasensor based on AuNPs and CNPs
modified with 100-based thiolated arsenic(III) aptamer has been designed
to detect arsenide(III). The designed nanoprobe can detect the arsenide
(III) at a low level of 0.092 ppb in the presence of other interfering metal
ions such as Cu, Cd, and Hg (Mushiana et al., 2019). Several biosensors
were fabricated to detect mercury ions due to their toxicity; such as Ag
nanowire, chitosan, hydroxymethyl propyl, and urease-modified screen￾printed carbon electrode (SPCE) have been reported. Under optimum
conditions, the designed probe exhibited exceptional performance for the

Advanced nanostructured material-based biosensors in clinical and forensic diagnosis 439analysis of Hg(II) ions, with a linear sensitivity range of 525 μM. The
LOD was found to be 3.94 μM (Saenchoopa et al., 2021).
In the same way as studied, 3D graphene oxide (GO) and polyaniline
were immobilized with a sensitive layer of DNA for determination of Hg
(II) ions within a concentration range from 0.1 to 100 nM with LOD of
0.035 nM (Yang et al., 2015). Another electrochemical biosensor based
on thymine (T)-rich stemloop (hairpin) DNA probe was used to obtain
a LOD of 0.08 nM which is much lower than the 10 nM (the US
Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] limit of Hg21 in drinking water)
within a concentration range of 0.55000 nM (Xiong et al., 2015). Dual￾responsive magnetic hyperbranched polyamide with heparin biosensor has
been reported to detect Hg21 ions in blood samples (Xiong et al., 2015).
The designed biosensor showed good results within the range of
0.54.8 3 103 pM for fluorescent analysis and 1.54.8 3 103 pM for
electrochemical analysis, with a LOD of 1.0 pM for fluorescent study and
4.4 pM for electrochemical study for blood lead, opening the potential
application for blood lead determination in the future (Fig. 17.5).
Hydroxyapatite nanowire linked with chitosan and horseradish peroxi￾dase has been exploited to detect cyanide, with a LOD of 0.6 ngM

440 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications(Wang et al., 2010). Cyanide has been detected by another electrochemi￾cal biosensor in which formate dehydrogenase (FDH, EC 1.2.1.2) and
cyanidase (EC 3.5.5.1) were employed to design biosensors. The LOD
was found to be in the low micromolar range in the linear range of
0.7800 μM (Ketterer & Keusgen, 2010).
Furthermore, a biosensor based on CRISPR/Cas12a linked with
immuno-rolling circle amplification (immuno-RCA) was fabricated to
target Escherichia coli O157:H7, a pathogenic bacterium. Under ideal
environments, the fabricated probe offered a broad dynamic detection
range from 10 to 107 CFU/m with a detection limit of 10 CFU/m
(Chen et al., 2021). Recently, a sandwich-type biosensor was developed
for selective and sensitive detection of E. coli O157:H7. The biosensor
was based on Cu3(PO4)2 and methylene blue and antimicrobial peptide
specific to E. coli O157:H7. The developed method displayed admirable
performance within the linear range of 102
107 CFU/m and a LOD of
32 CFU/m. The developed approach also has the ability to sense patho￾genic bacteria in clinical diagnostics (Bu et al., 2020). Staphylococcus aureus
has been detected by an electrochemical biosensor within the range of
303 3 108 CFU/m, with a LOD of 8 CFU/m. The biosensor is
employed for the analysis of Staphylococcus aureus in tap water, lake water,
and honey samples, demonstrating that the biosensor has considerable
practicability (Bu et al., 2020). Another biosensor based on cognate pair
of aptamers (primary aptamer SA37 as a capturing moiety and secondary
aptamer SA81 as a signaling aptamer), which was linked to the target
Staphylococcus on a screen-printed gold electrode, was purposed. The
LODs of 414 and 39 CFUs in spiked tap water and buffer samples,
respectively, were found. In addition, Au-MoS2-PANI nanocomposite
immobilized with antibodies specific to bacteria has been successfully
employed to detect E. coli with LOD of CFU/mL.
Furthermore, the designed biosensor showed good practical efficacy in
urine sample studies (Raj et al., 2021). All these studies revealed that
nanomaterials-based electrochemical biosensors could efficiently and reli￾ably be implemented in clinical and forensic analysis.
Aptamer-based biosensors have been used to detect cocaine. The apta￾sensor was designed with carbon dots (CDs) AuNPs and immobilized
with DNA on the surface of the ITO electrode. The target DNA could
be combined with CDs coupled with thionine to give a reduction/oxida￾tion probe to monitor the analyte. Under optimized conditions, the
designed biosensor displays a wide linear range of 1070 pM with an

was developed by modifying the 50
-disulfide-functionalized end of an
aptamer sequence on the surface of nanoporous Au electrode followed by
the conjugation of its 30
-amino-functionalized end to 2,5-dihydroxyben￾zoic acid as the redox probe. The aptamer enhanced the electron transfer
efficacy on a conformational change from an open unfolded state to a
closed conformation, which reduces the distance between the electrode
surface and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The concentration ranges of
0.0535 μM, with LOD of 21 nM, were found under the ideal experi￾mental conditions (Tavakkoli et al., 2019). Furthermore, single-chain
antibody fragments and cobalt oxide NP-based electrochemical biosensor
have been reported for the detection of cocaine. The biosensor exhibited
an excellent linear range of 5.0250 ng mL21 and a LOD of 3.6 ng
mL21
. The outcomes were compared with outcomes attained from Q￾TOF/Ms where four different mediums (saliva, sweat, serum, and urine)
were spiked with 100 ng mL21 cocaine and were studied by both
approaches (Q-TOF/Ms and biosensor). The higher performance of the
biosensor was seen as compared to traditional approaches (Sanli et al.,
2020). Studies using nanomaterials-based biosensors for illicit drug detec￾tion and other compounds in clinical and forensic analysis have also been
reported and are given in Table 17.1.
17.4 Conclusion
The development of electrochemical biosensors has been a big achieve￾ment in recent years due to their specialty and vast applications in clinical
and forensic analysis. Because treatment is frequently dependent on con￾crete levels of clinical markers, therefore high accuracy and selectivity are
needed. In this regard, nanomaterials play an essential to increase the
properties of electrochemical biosensors. Nanomaterials have several prop￾erties that make them ideal for sensing applications, such as large surface
area, high reactivity, easy dispersibility, and rapid fabrication. The design
and use of electrochemical biosensors made of nanostructured materials
are important in the determination of biological molecules, in the diagno￾sis of disease, and especially in the analysis of drugs of abuse in forensic
sciences. In clinical and forensic diagnostics, POC diagnostic platforms can
offer significant advantages by providing rapid, sensitive, user-friendly, and
selective analytical tools for detection. For a diagnostic device to reach the
market, traditional biological testing formats must be scaled down to the
Advanced nanostructured material-based biosensors in clinical and forensic diagnosis 447size of a portable device that requires low volumes of samples and reagents
while providing specific and sensitive multi-analyte analysis with high
throughput. It operates with a small sample volume, responds in seconds,
enables instrument-free on-site diagnostics, and cost-effective, specific,
and sensitive detection.
Because more sensitive and portable analytical tools provide a perspec￾tive for the better applications of electrochemical biosensors at the com￾mercial level, this chapter summarizes some important nanoparticles and
their contribution to preparing more reliable and sensitive analytical tools
for clinical and forensic applications. The goal is to highlight recent
advances in highly sensitive and flexible nanomaterial-based electrochemi￾cal biosensors that have the potential to be developed as next-generation
field-ready analytical tools.

18.1 Introduction
Heavy metals are a broad phrase that refers to a class of metallic elements
and metalloids with atomic densities of more than 4000 kg m23
(Edelstein & Ben-Hur, 2018). Even at low metal ion levels, almost all
heavy metals behave as toxic to humans (Hemavathy et al., 2019; Li
et al., 2019; Miao et al., 2023). Toxic metals are naturally present hazard￾ous elements with high atomic weight and density. Heavy metal poison￾ing can result in death and disability (Xiao et al., 2022). Soil pollution,
wastewater, mining operations, industrial and sewage wastes, pesticides
used in agriculture, and automotive exhaust emissions all conduce to the
total metal freightage. Heavy metal poisoning has recently become a sig￾nificant risk worldwide, affecting 235 million hectares of cropland world￾wide (Lin et al., 2022). Cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), arsenic
(As), boron (B), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), strontium (Sr),
tin (Sn), vanadium (V), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), mercury (Hg),
and lead (Pb) are some examples of toxic metals. Because of the complex
nature of toxic metals and biological interactions, the detrimental health
impacts of heavy metals such as As, Pb, Cr, Hg, Cd, and Cu have become
more complicated and problematic for the globe. The principal metals
researched for their high toxicity levels include Pb, As, Cr, Cd, and Hg
(Akoury et al., 2023; Tchounwou et al., 2012). Some toxic metals remain
detrimental even at parts per billion (ppb) levels because of their great

All rights reserved.binding affinity for N, O, and S atoms in biomolecules, which inhibits
biological activities and disrupts physiological processes (Buhari, Faillace,.
2019). Metal poisoning significantly reduces the catalytic activity of certain
enzymes following Hg21 or Cu21 binding. Excessive heavy metal con￾sumption is also linked to several disorders, including Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, metal are
more stable in many conditions than organic substances. As a result,
detecting and removing environmentally toxic metals are critical to eco￾logical security (Liu et al., 2023).
Although metals’ mechanisms of action differ, the only approach to
assist the body in dealing with the toxic metal burden is to remove toxic
metal from the body and limit or decrease the potential of reexposure.
They can sometimes behave as phantom body elements and even interfere
with metabolic processes. Some metals, such as aluminum (Al), may be
eliminated by elimination processes, but others accumulate in the body
and food chain, demonstrating chronic toxicity. Several public health
strategies have been used to manage, prevent, and treat metal toxicity at
multiple levels, such as exposure to toxic metals, accidents, and environ￾mental causes. Metal toxicity is determined by the absorbed dosage and
the length of exposure, which can be acute or chronic. This can result in
various diseases and excessive damage owing to oxidative stress caused by
free radical production (Jaishankar et al., 2014). It is hypothesized that
using biomarkers to detect early harm to the cardiovascular system caused
by low levels of toxic metal exposure may be advantageous. Besides, the
patient’s clinical state can be doubted by finding long-term low levels of
human exposure to dosages experimentally used to produce cardiotoxicity
(Sevim et al., 2020).
Modern life, the world’s fast population growth, and the rapid devel￾opment of agriculture have all led to increased exposure to heavy metals
through respiration and food intake. Toxic metals are often used in
manufacturing and can infiltrate biological systems through industrial
waste (Rabee & Abd El-Salam, 2023). Toxic metals are abundant in the
environment but may bioaccumulate in living creatures. Even though
metals enter the body in diverse ways, they accumulate in various tissues,
eventually reaching the toxicity threshold after bioaccumulating (Ghanim
et al., 2023). The pervasiveness of metal dispersion in nature poses a risk
to all creatures. Environmental exposure occurs by breathing contami￾nated air, growing plants on heavy metal-laden soil, or water runoff into
drinking water. The harmful effects of toxic metals with various
464 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationstransmission paths vary depending on the metal’s characteristics since not
all are removed when taken up into the body and can impact different
organ systems. Due to their varied routes, toxic metals can induce various
illnesses (Palma et al., 2023). Because of industrial activities, toxic metals
are transported by runoff water, damaging water supplies. All living things,
including plants, animals, and bacteria, require water. Toxic metals can
attach to the surface of microbes via bioaccumulation, and they can even
penetrate the cell and be chemically changed when the microbe consumes
food materials via biochemical processes.
Most toxic metals, such as Cd, Hg, As, and Pb, are linked to pollution
and hazardous risks, especially when dissolved. Because of their toxicity
and mobility, these poisonous metals in high concentrations are dangerous
to individuals and can interfere with various earthly advantages.
Additionally, cleaning becomes more challenging because these hazardous
metals are nonbiodegradable (Kapahi & Sachdeva, 2019). Consequently,
assessing, analyzing, and regulating toxic metal contamination in nature
are critical.
18.2 Toxic metals
18.2.1 Cadmium
Cadmium (Cd) has many applications, including batteries, ceramics, metal
refining, electrolytic industries, dyes, petroleum, textiles, television
screens, metallurgical industries, synthetic chemicals, and photography
(Rahimzadeh et al., 2017). Increased Cd concentrations in air, soil, and
water occur near industrial sources, particularly nonferrous mining and
metal handling operations. Cd is a very toxic metal that, even at low con￾centrations, may accumulate in the body and can cause irreparable injury
to many biological systems (Genchi et al., 2020).
Given the increased toxicological impact of Cd and the widespread
contamination accumulation in the environment from many sources, it is
critical to determine and eliminate Cd ions even at ultra-trace concentra￾tions (μg L21
) (Zhang et al., 2023). Among the numerous harmful toxic
contaminants, divalent Cd has been warned to cause several hazardous
conducive effects to the environment as a result of its massive discharge
activities discovered following its widespread use in industrial product
manufacturing such as tobacco industry, textile dyes, corrosion-resistant
agents, electroforming, fertilizers, and rechargeable batteries (Noh et al.,
2017). As a result, it is critical to develop a unique technology for swiftly
Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 465detecting Cd ions both sensitively and selectively among other coexisting
ions (Srinivasan et al., 2023). Toxic metal contamination is one of the
most severe environmental problems, posing health hazards and challeng￾ing to remedy. Given these health risks, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) recommends a maximum permitted level of just 5.0 μg
L21 of Cd in drinking water (Ghanei-Motlagh & Taher, 2017). The
allowable limit of Cd (0.2 ppm) in grains for human consumption is rela￾tively low, necessitating constant monitoring and preventative actions.
Because of the hazardous implications of excessive Cd pollution, a qualita￾tive and quantitative assessment of Cd in the environment is critical.
Existing approaches for determining Cd include atomic absorption and
atomic emission spectroscopy, the analysis of neutron activation, induc￾tively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and others. Even though these
procedures are used to determine Cd, they have some drawbacks, such as
the need for specialized staff, high maintenance costs, large sample
amounts, longer reaction times, and a high cost per sample, among others
(Bhanjana et al., 2015).
Because of the comprehensive properties of nanomaterials, as well as
the possibilities for modifying them with different functional groups,
nanomaterial-based electrochemical sensors achieve high sensitivity and
specificity, enhanced conductivity, the lowest detection limit, and the
shortest response time (Kumar et al., 2015). Because Cd is an electroactive
species, it may be identified effectively by electrochemical detection
(Gupta et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2013; Song et al., 2019).
18.2.2 Mercury
Rapid industrialization has increased the amount of Hg21 on the planet,
posing health risks to humans through ingesting Hg-contaminated foods.
As Hg21 is one of the harmful toxic metal ions found primarily in water
and living marine life, it enters the human body indirectly by consuming
living marine foods. The general population is predominantly exposed to
Hg through food, with fish being a significant source of methyl Hg expo￾sure and dental amalgam. Several experiments have revealed that Hg
vapor is emitted from amalgam fillings, and chewing might enhance the
release rate (Järup, 2003). Hg intake can result in nausea, severe gastroin￾testinal discomfort, renal damage, kidney problems, neurological disorders,
and other side effects (Kim et al., 2016).
466 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsAs a consequence, detecting Hg21 in water is critical for protecting
both human health and the environment (Sonowal & Saikia, 2023).
Inorganic pollutants from hazardous toxic metal contaminants in water
resources are a worldwide environmental concern, mainly due to indus￾trial development and inappropriate discharge operations that damage
humans and other living organisms directly or indirectly (Järup, 2003).
The degradation process cannot eliminate it, but it may be transferred and
accumulated in the human body via the food chain, and traces of Hg can
harm the central nervous system (Rashid et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022).
As a result, the WHO and EPA have set maximum levels of Hg in drink￾ing water at 30 and 10 nM, respectively (Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020). Biological Hg poisoning symptoms include depression, memory
difficulties, tremors, tiredness, headaches, hair loss, and so on (Jaishankar
et al., 2014). As a result, efficient detection technologies for sensitive and
precise detection of Hg in an environment and live cells are in high
demand (Wang et al., 2020).
18.2.3 Lead
Pb exposure occurs mainly by inhaling Pb-contaminated dust particles or
aerosols and consuming Pb-contaminated food, drink, and paints
(Enogieru & Momodu, 2023). Pb exposure can occur through food, soil,
polluted air, and water. According to reports, occupational Pb exposure
accounts for around 94% of Pb exposure, and as a result, it represents a
public health problem (Shaffer & Gilbert, 2018). Because Pb is very harm￾ful, its usage in many items, such as paints and gasoline, has been signifi￾cantly curtailed (Saidur et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). Pb has also been
linked to carcinogenic consequences in humans and animals (Dotaniya
et al., 2022; Enogieru & Momodu, 2023). Soil and water conditions in
nature impact Pb, oxides, hydroxide ions, oxoanionic complexes, and
their chemistry (Dotaniya & Nagar, 2023). Pb-contaminated irrigation
water collected a substantial quantity of Pb in the soil and influenced plant
nutrient patterns in the ground and microbial biomass carbon; pollution
in the food chain may induce various adverse effects in human and animal
bodies (Meena et al., 2019). Industrial Pb exposure has been associated
with neurological impairment, reproductive problems, hepatotoxicity,
cancer, and hypertension (Collin et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2020). As a
result, detecting Pb at trace levels is critical.
Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 467Pb has been detected using various methods, including inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry,
ultravioletvisible spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectrometry,
and others (Bang Njenjock et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Wu et al.,
2022). Although these approaches have been practical and extensively
used, numerous shortcomings remain, like long analysis times, a restricted
linear range, an inability to concurrently evaluate many components, and
challenging sample preparation (Khan et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2020).
Electrochemical detection methods, on the other hand, such as electro￾chemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and square￾wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), demonstrated the ease of
operation, high sensitivity, quick analysis, good selectivity, and the ability
to detect multiple elements simultaneously (Guo et al., 2017; Dong &
Zhang, 2017; Hu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2019).
18.2.4 Arsenic
Pollution has garnered significant global attention in recent years owing
to the possible health dangers linked to the environment (Wang et al.,
2020). As a result of its usage in insecticides, actual mining, and proces￾sing, a significant contaminant in wastewater occurs (Sharma & Sohn,
2009). As a recurring chemical in drinking water with quantities exceed￾ing the WHO threshold values (10 μg L21
) (Moreira et al., 2021), pro￾longed exposure to arsenic causes cancer and various other disorders
(Yang et al., 2018). There are extremely few As complexes in nature;
mostly arsenic is found in nonferrous metal ores as sulfides (Wang et al.,
2019).
The primary goal of arsenic pollution remediation is to prevent arsenic
from leaching into soil and water (Sullivan et al., 2010). Arsenic should be
removed and recycled as much as possible from the natural environment
(Ma et al., 2023). Modern methods for removing As from waste rely pri￾marily on chemical precipitation techniques such as lime, ferric salt, and
sulfide precipitation, which have been extensively researched in laboratory
and commercial settings (Chai et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2015; Lakshmanan
et al., 2010). This process necessitates much alkali consumption, and acids
cannot be recovered. Furthermore, arsenic-containing residues formed
following precipitation treatment are hazardous wastes that become
unstable during stacking, potentially resulting in secondary contamination
(Gutiérrez et al., 2010).
468 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsConsequently, it is very desirable to develop efficient analytical techni￾ques for the detection and monitoring of As (Zhuang et al., 2023).
Electrochemical methods have various advantages, including simple and
quick processes, low cost, and the ability to do on-site tests with
portable equipment and sensing devices (Dinu et al., 2022) (Fig. 18.1).
18.3 Nanomaterials that are used as a detection platform
In nanosensor design to detect various analytes, carbon nanotubes, fuller￾enes, nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, and quantum dots, several types
of polymers are generally utilized (Hareesha, Manjunatha, Amrutha,
Pushpanjali, et al., 2021; Hareesha, Manjunatha, Amrutha, Sreeharsha,
et al., 2021; Prinith & Manjunatha, 2020; Pushpanjali et al., 2020; Raril
& Manjunatha, 2018). Nanostructured materials are generally used to
construct sensors using conjugated polymers and quantum dots for detect￾ing toxic metals. Conjugated polymers (CPs) have to alternate σ and π
bonds in the polymer backbone. These bonds allow π-electrons to delo￾calize on conjugated polymers and provide valuable electronic properties
to be used in a variety of electronic devices, that is, photovoltaics
(Coakley & McGehee, 2004), field-effect transistors (Yang et al., 2018),
and biosensors (Sengodu, 2022). Among the broad extent and ample con￾jugated polymer family, typical early examples of conjugated polymers
were mainly based on polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene. Their
bulk properties usually do not satisfy the needs of physical, optical, and
electronic requirements (Zhao et al., 2017). Thus size confinement is a
meritorious way to meet the requirements of various applications. The
Figure 18.1 Schematic representation for electrochemical detection of toxic metals.
Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 469specialties and fruitful benefits of these opened a new perspective in sci￾ence that nanosized entities of polymeric materials are designated as
nanostructured conjugated polymers (NCPs) (Ghosh et al., 2016). NCPs
can provide superior electrical conductivity, higher and in the case of 1D,
2D, or 3D (D 5 dimension) directional carrier mobility, unique electro￾chemical activity toward specific targets, improved optical properties, and
good biocompatibility owing to their well-defined nanostructures with
larger surface areas (Xue et al., 2020). The rapid development of NCPs in
recent decades is directly associated with three significant developments in
the field. The first one is unfolding the more profound insights into
charge transport processes and transfer mechanisms, as well as physico￾chemical properties and interactions at interfacial boundaries (Fahlman
et al., 2019). The next one is simply developing more pathways, conve￾nient methods, and easy procedures to convert, synthesize, and produce
nanostructured conjugated polymers (Ghosh et al., 2016). The third one,
but not the least important and probably the most effective contributor, is
the curiosity of scientists to discover. These three forces unfold the NCP’s
excellent properties and extend NCPs to nanoparticles (Novio, 2020),
nanospheres (Liao et al., 2010), nanorods (Martín et al., 2012), nanostars
(Lee et al., 2013), nanowires (Tatum & Luscombe, 2018), nanofibrils (Ma
et al., 2021), nanosheets (Yano et al., 2019), etc.
CPs are excellent materials for biosensor applications due to their
decent electrical properties and ease of modification to possess various
functional groups and surface properties. These unique characteristics of
CPs make them a suitable matrix for an enzyme for biosensor applications
(Sengodu, 2022). Since morphology and surface features are essential para￾meters in biosensor electrodes, size confinement (from a few nanometers
to hundreds of nanometers) with increased surface area affects conductiv￾ity and physicochemical parameters beneficial to the performance of bio￾sensors (Ji et al., 2020). Size confinement resulted in higher surface areas
and, in specific cases, introduced a porous structure, increasing the surface
area. The increased surface area provides more electrodeelectrolyte sites
for enzyme deposition or electrochemically active sites for nonenzymatic
sensors. Thus the sensing capability and performance of biosensors are
increased accordingly.
NCPs are well known and widely studied, and there is an abundant
amount of literature reviews (Correa et al., 2014; Tuncel, 2019) and
books (Ghosh, 2021; Yoon, 2021); here, the synthesis of NCPs is not
covered in detail but gives a few examples in various applications to the
470 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsselected synthetic routes for two different approaches: top-down and
bottom-up. First, it should be clarified that the top-down method can be
divided into two. The lithographic techniques work physically, and the
chemical vapor-mediated processes work chemically in the top-down sys￾tem. The production of NCPs via top-down physical methods and lithog￾raphy provide a bed for the conjugated polymer to be generated, placed
in, or forms the bulk of conjugated polymer into the shape of nanostruc￾tures. On the other hand, some methods used in the bottom-up approach
include plasma arcing, chemical vapor deposition processes, metalorgan￾ic decomposition, laser pyrolysis, molecular beam epitaxy, solgel
method, wet synthesis, and self-assembly processes.
Another family member of nanostructured materials is quantum dots.
In this group, the two family members—organic and inorganic—always
have competition with one another. In general, quantum dots (QDs) pos￾sess unique optical/electrooptical properties with excellent chemical stabil￾ities (Ding et al., 2022; Farzin & Abdoos, 2021). Extended fluorescence
lifetime with high quantum yields, confined emission spectra with broad
excitation range, and adjustable particle size with adjustable particle geom￾etry are some of the indispensable features of QDs that make QDs scarcely
used in various fields such as pharmaceuticals and real-time monitoring
(Jahangir et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Suo et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2017),
material science (i.e., photovoltaics (Hu, Zhao, et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,
2020)), and, of course, biosensors, which is our main discussion in this
chapter. However, due to highly toxic heavy metals like cadmium, inor￾ganic QDs are intrinsically inconvenient to keep in touch with a live
environment (Zhang et al., 2020). Thus this intrinsically restricts inorganic
QDs from participating in biomedical applications.
Carbon dots (CDs), in the family of quantum dots (QD), are assumed
to be zero-dimensional (diameter less than 10 nm) carbon-based nanoma￾terials. Xu et al. (2004) discovered CDs by chance while purifying single￾walled carbon nanotubes synthesized by the electrophoresis route. Since
then, CDs have become rapidly famous in material science. It is worth
noting here that there are distinctions in CDs based on the nature of the
carbon source, core structure, and quantum effect. Subcategories can be
titled as graphene quantum dots—of course, two-dimensional—(GQDs),
carbon nanodots (CNDs), and carbon quantum dots (CQDs) (Cayuela
et al., 2016). As presented in the name, GQDs are mainly generated by
cutting large graphene sheets into smaller parts possessing π-conjugated
disk-shaped nanostructures. CNDs have a quasi-sphere shape that lacks
Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 471quantum constraints and include an amorphous structure ( Ji et al., 2020).
On the other hand, CQDs are spherical quantum dots with quantum
confinement possessing crystal structures ( Ji et al., 2020).
Over time, parts of QDs have been categorized into 2D quantum dots
covering hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) ( Kim et al., 2012), black phos￾phorus (Chen et al., 2018), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) (Zhang
et al., 2012), MXene (Urbankowski et al., 2016), transition metal dichal￾cogenides (TMDCs) ( Huang et al., 2014), and transition metal oxides
(TMOs) (Yang et al., 2019). When covalently, coordinately, or ionically
bonded atoms in the separate layers of bulk materials connected with
weak van der Waals forces are reduced to below 100 and typically less
than 10 nm in lateral dimension, a strong quantum confinement effect is
generated since 2D quantum dots generally refer to quantum dots derived
from materials composed of two-dimensional sheets/layers in their bulk
form.
Carbon-based quantum dots can be obtained similarly through either
top-down or bottom-up approaches. In the former, source materials, for
example, graphite ( Gu et al., 2018), carbon soot (Tian et al., 2009), car￾bon nanotubes ( Xu et al., 2004b), fullerenes (Yang et al., 2018), or bio￾mass (Abbas et al., 2020) are processed in harsh conditions. Laser ablation
(Santiago et al., 2016), electrochemical exfoliation ( Tan et al., 2015), and
arc discharge ( Arora & Sharma, 2014) can be counted in this category.
Expensive source materials, high energy-consuming experimental setups,
harsh reaction conditions, and longer reaction times are major drawbacks
of this approach. However, there are some techniques like ultrasound
exfoliation (Sharma & Das, 2019) of graphene and MoS2 as a moderate
condition for production. The latter approach covers synthesizing carbon
or quantum dots through“decompositionpolymerization carboniza￾tion.” In general, carbon sources (urea derivatives ( Miao et al., 2018),
citric acid (Zeng et al., 2016), synthetic polymers—such as polyethylene
glycol (Peng et al., 2020) or polythiophene (Ge et al., 2015)—biomass
(Abbas et al., 2020), carbohydrates ( Peng et al., 2020), etc.) are processed
through pyrolysis, solvothermal (Arias Velasco et al., 2021), hydrothermal
carbonization (Zhu et al., 2022), and microwave (Zhu et al., 2009) or
ultrasonication (Das et al., 2019). Crosslinking the monomers or linear
polymers in the bottom-up methods to obtain carbon dots can be classi￾fied into a new type of polymer dots (PDs) ( Zhu et al., 2015).
Because there are several classification types, how to produce them,
how many dimensions they possess, from which source they are
472 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssynthesized or processed, and other unlisted parameters, it is hard to draw
a solid line between them. So, NCPs, CQDs, QDs, CNDs, and 2D quan￾tum dots are considered whole nanostructured materials.
One bottom-up strategy to obtain nanostructured CPs is template base
synthesis. In this approach, there is a template within which monomers
can react to form CPs. The advantage of this method is that when the
template is removed, the integrity of nanostructured materials can be
maintained. One example of rigid template synthesis demonstrates the
synthesis of polythiophene-conjugated polymer nanowires (Ambade et al.,
2017). In this study, Lee et al. found that hollow titanium dioxide (TiO2)
nanotubes (TNTs) provide an exciting mechanism for polymerizing thio￾phene. It is likely to nucleate and grow polymerization deep inside the
hollow TNT because of the higher surface energy of TNTs, and subse￾quently, formed nanowires inside the TNT are extruded while polymeri￾zation progresses. Another typical production method of sheet-like (2D)
conjugated nanostructured polymers is ice-templated synthesis. In this
method, the ice surface provides a large two-dimensional area for the
instant polymerization of monomers along the airwater interface.
Barpuzary et al. (2019) demonstrated the synthesis of sheets like PEDOT:
PSS films with a thickness of ca. 30 nm in 5 minutes. Ice-templated
PEDOT:PSS films were investigated in photoelectrochemical and photo￾voltaic studies. They revealed that the spin dominates ice-templated one￾coated PEDOT:PSS through excellent photoelectrochemical features and
superior power conversion efficiency in P3HT:PCBM solar cells with
higher conductivity values.
Although ultrasound is generally used to exfoliate bulk materials (the
top-down method will be exemplified soon), an extraordinary study
revealed the usage of ultrasound for bottom-up method. Jasuja et al. (Das
et al., 2019) found an unexpected transformation of acetonitrile into QDs
during ultrasonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation. These QDs are
formed in a 2D shape (Fig. 18.2) and are fluorescent. They found a tradi￾tionally unknown perspective on the effect of ultrasonication on organic
solvents. The solvent itself can act as a carbon source and generate (fluo￾rescent) quantum particles upon being irradiated with ultrasonic energy.
Contrary to bottom-up, top-down methodology covers separating,
disassembling, or shaping bulk materials into nanosized structures. Once
more, among various chemical and physical approaches in top-down
methodology, ultrasound exfoliation is widely used in weakly bounded
layered materials in their bulk form. For example, atomically thin sheets
Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 473of MoS2 (Stengl & Henych, 2013 ˇ ), h-BN (Stengl et al., 2014 ˇ ), WS2
(Stengl et al., 2015 ˇ ), and g-C3N4 (Zhang et al., 2016) were obtained by
using ultrasound exfoliation. Chen et al. (Gong et al., 2021) used ultraso￾nication to form hybrid sheets with abundant GQD/MoS2 van der Waals
heterojunctions (Fig. 18.3), which were utilized for electrochemical catal￾ysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction. As-formed hybrid sheets outper￾formed the bulk or microsheets of MoS2 and provided promising features
for other applications such as electrochemical and photocatalysis, opto￾electronics, energy conversion, and storage.
Although there is a health concern due to heavy metals in inorganic
quantum dots, numerous studies (Gupta et al., 2022; Jamei et al., 2021;
Liang et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2022; Pourghobadi et al., 2018; Wang
et al., 2020) exist. Thus, in the last example here, it must be emphasized
that Shi et al. (Xu et al., 2020) extraordinarily used a biosynthetic method
in which Phomopsis sp. XP-8 (an endophytic filamentous fungus isolated
from Eucommia ulmoides) is a bioreactor to synthesize CdSxSe12x QDs.

the fluorescence quenching in the linear range from 3.13 to 500 μg L21
with a detection limit of 0.89 μg L21
.
18.4 Applications of toxic metals detection using
nanostructured platforms
In the literature, there are many studies on the detection of toxic metals
using nanostructured platforms. Some of them are tabulated in
Table 18.1. In research by Li et al., a direct pyrolysis method with a 69%
mass yield was used to make fluorescence N-doped carbon dots NCDs,
and due to their optical characteristics, a luminescence mechanism was
investigated with the NCDs. As a fluorescent probe, it shows high selec￾tivity for the detection of iron(III) in water samples in the presence of a
Tris-HCl buffer system, which plays an essential role in the formation of
ferric hydroxide colloid and forming a hydrogen bond between NCDs
and ferric hydroxide that will help in specific recognition by NCDs.
Correspondingly, satisfactory recoveries and a wide linear range were
obtained from 0 to 400 μM with a detection limit of 0.703 μM for NCDs
(Li et al., 2021). In another article related to heavy metals detection,
authors designed an optical sensor based on (N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphy￾rin toluene sulfonate (TMPP) in an aqueous medium with different
organic solvents, THF, and water. Many techniques were utilized to char￾acterize the samples, such as UVvis absorption, fluorescence stopped
flow, and cyclic voltammetry. The results showed the formation of an
aggregated form in water approved by fluorescence quenching. In the
presence of the cationic CTAB micelles, the CMC value was found to be
5.7 3 1025 M, much lower than the anionic SDS, which was found to be
1.0 3 1024 M. After applying the optical sensor to detect the toxic heavy
metal, an observed reversible interaction with TMPP was obtained for
Cd21, Ag21, and Cu21 and irreversible interaction for Hg21, Pb21,
Ni21, and Co21 (Sallam et al., 2020).
Another study recommended a new design of an electrochemical sen￾sor based on nanocomposite, and the authors proposed a glassy carbon
electrode covered with a layer of zinc oxide-doped iron oxide (Zn/Fe)
nanocomposite. It was utilized for the simultaneous and individual detec￾tion of Cd21, Pb21, and Cu21 in water samples.

and under the optimized conditions, it exhibited high sensitivity with a
low detection limit of 0.140, 0.70, and 0.040 mg L21 for Cd21, Pb21,
and Cu21, respectively. Thus the proposed electrode was approved for its
efficiency and quickness in detecting heavy metals, its simplicity and
reproducibility, and its predictable future in environmental monitoring
(Bakhsh et al., 2021). Another application for using electrochemical sen￾sors for simultaneous detection and quantification of the heavy metals by
using a carbon paste-modified electrode, Niu et al., exhibited a fern-leaf
shape MOF(V) and MIL-47(as) by hydrothermal interaction, and charac￾terized by cyclic voltammetry. Then, under optimized conditions like pH,
deposition potential, and deposition time, the electrode was applied to
detect the ions Pb21, Cu21, and Hg21 using a differential pulse voltam￾metry technique. The results showed a wide linear range between 1 and
10 mM and a low detection limit of 0.029, 0.087, and 0.067 μM, respec￾tively. The proposed electrode shows good stability and repeatability for
detection, and they reported that there is no effect of the interference
(Niu et al., 2021) (Fig. 18.5).
In order to develop a new type of electrochemical sensor for heavy
metal ions, Jyoti et al. designed a modified graphene oxide electrode based
on the hydrothermal interaction between 2-(anthracen-9-yl)benzothiazole
(ABT) and nickel ferrite (NF@rGO) for the individual and simultaneous
detection of Cd21, Cu21, and Hg21 ions. The proposed electrode gave a
wide linear range between 0.05 and 1250 nM with an excellent detection
limit of 123, 54.1, and 86.6 pM by utilizing anodic stripping voltammetry
technique to simultaneously determine Cd21, Cu21, and Hg21 ions,
respectively. As a result of their studies, the electrode shows high selectiv￾ity, sensitivity, good repeatability and reproducibility, and anti￾interference. Due to its good characteristics, it can be used in various
applications, such as cosmetics and water (Jyoti et al., 2022). In another
work, an efficient electrochemical probe was successfully synthesized by
Yamuna et al., where the Co3O4 nanocube (Co3O4-NC) electrode was
hydrothermally prepared and utilized to determine highly toxic heavy
metals Pb21, Cu21, and Hg21. The electrode characteristics were investi￾gated via XRD, Raman, XPS, FESEM, and HRTEM analyses. The
Co3O4-NC/SPCE revealed good sensitivity, high selectivity, and good
recoveries for the detection of the metals by differential pulse voltamme￾try technique in the tap water and pond water samples, and the limit of
detection was found to be 4.1 6 0.2, 0.9 6 0.04, and 0.1 6 0.005 nM for
Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 483Pb21, Cu21, and Hg21, respectively. Consequently, the Co3O4-NC/
SPCE can be used in on-time monitoring apparatuses (Yamuna et al.,
2021).
In this recent study by Zhang et al., a sensitive electrochemical
method based on Fe3O4@SiO2 has been developed for detecting the hea￾vy metal ions Cd21, Pb21, Cu21, and Hg21 individually and simulta￾neously, an electrostatic force formed between the modified electrode’s
negative charge and the heavy metal’s positive charge. The proposed elec￾trode for detecting the heavy metals in milk samples was analyzed using a
differential pulse stripping voltammetry technique. It exhibited a wide lin￾ear range between 1 and 100 μM with detection limits of 56.1, 16.5,
Figure 18.5 (A) DPV curves for Pb21, Cu21, and Hg21 in different pH values; the rela￾tion of current on (B) pH value; (C) preconcentration potential; and (D) preconcentra￾tion time on the voltammetric response of the MIL-44(as)/CPE (unadjusted pH value
is used). All data were obtained by DPASV for 20 μM Pb21, 100 μM Cu21, and 20 μM
Hg21. From Niu, B., Yao, B., Zhu, M., Guo, H., Ying, S., & Chen, Z. (2021). Carbon paste

484 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications79.4, and 56.7 nM for Cd21, Pb21, Cu21, and Hg21, respectively. Also,
it showed excellent sensitivity, selectivity with a recovery range of
96.0%104.3%, and a predictable future due to its simplicity, low cost,
and fast pretreatment process (Zhang, & Xia, Deen, et al., 2023)
(Fig. 18.6).
New electrochemical sensors designed by Huang et al. can identify
heavy metal ion toxicity levels in food, with good electrochemical
responses to Cd(II) and Pb(II), with sensitivities as low as 0.459 and
0.509 A M21
cm
2
. Therefore developing novel electrochemical sensors
that can accurately detect the different toxicity levels of heavy metal ions
in food is of great significance. They effectively synthesized boron and
nitrogen co-doped carbon (BCN). A square-wave anodic stripping vol￾tammetry technique was applied to the proposed modified electrode
BCN-Nafion/GCE. Under optimal conditions, the SWASV response
showed an extensive linear range from 1 to 50 mM with a low limit of
detection around 0.41 μg L21 for Cd(II) and 0.93 μg L21 for Pb(II).
Therefore this study provides a simple, effective, and environmentally
friendly method for synthesizing sensors. It also offers fresh perspectives
on creating metal-free materials for electrochemical detection generated

Detection of toxic metals using nanostructured biosensing platforms 485from MOFs (Huang et al., 2023). For individual and simultaneous elec￾trochemical detection of Pb(II) and Hg(II) metals, recently by Lei et al., a
simple, effective way to prepare X-manganate nanocomposite (X-Ni, Zn,
and Cu) was found via hydrothermal reaction. Three nanocomposites
were prepared and characteristically compared, (NMO-GR), (ZMO￾GR), and (CMO-GR). As a result, NMO-GR revealed an excellent
response via square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). A
wide linear range was exhibited around 1.47.7 μM for Pb(II) and
0.76.7 μM for Hg(II), with the lowest detection limits of 0.050 μM for
Pb(II) and 0.027 μM for Hg(II) in comparison with ZMO-GR and
CMO-GR. So the electrode shows stability, good reproducibility, and
promising applications for detecting heavy meals, especially in environ￾mental pollutant fields (Lei et al., 2022). In another study, a novel electro￾chemical sensor based on ZIF-8 nanocomposites (Ag/ZnO/ZIF-8) was
created to assess the detection of mercury ions (Hg21). The Ag ions can
increase the electrochemical properties of ZIF-8 by enhancing conductiv￾ity and selectivity, and Ag has localized surface plasmon resonance proper￾ties. The composite ZIF-8 sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity for
detecting mercury ions (Hg21). It had a high sensitivity and a low detec￾tion limit of 40 nM with an extensive linear range of 0.5140 nM cov￾ered. Moreover, with good sensitivity, the real-time applications of the
ZIF-8 composite sensor were examined in a variety of samples by using
square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Therefore Ag/ZnO/ZIF-8
had improved electrocatalytic behavior for mercury identification with
good sensitivity for real-time applications (Arabbani et al., 2023). Some
selected studies about toxic metals detection with nanostructured sensors
and biosensors are tabulated in Table 18.1.
18.5 Conclusion
Heavy metal contamination is a critical issue threatening public health and
the environment. Using biosensors and nanosensors as monitoring systems
is a promising future for detecting and controlling toxic metals, and using
nanostructured materials, such as NCPs and QDs, as biosensor detection
platforms has shown promising potential in various biomedical and envi￾ronmental applications. However, the toxicity of heavy metals in inor￾ganic QDs, such as cadmium, limits their use in biomedical applications.
CDs, as a subcategory of QDs, offer a safer alternative for biosensing
applications because of their zero-dimensional carbon-based structure. It is
486 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationscrucial to continue research and development in biosensors to enhance
the detection and removal of environmentally toxic metals for ecological
security. The high sensitivity and small size characteristics of nanobiosen￾sors offer tremendous promise for usage in the near future for biodiagnosis
and other medical procedures. They can be easily inserted into a variety
of medical equipment because of their small size. The potential for using
nanobiosensors for heavy metal detection purposes is unsurpassed. Future
environmental and medical procedures will be outpaced by using nano￾biosensors, enabling more accurate, faster, and more sophisticated patient
monitoring equipment for heavy metal identification. Furthermore, public
health strategies must be in place to manage, prevent, and treat metal tox￾icity at multiple levels. With continued advancements in biosensor tech￾nology, we can take steps toward a cleaner and safer environment,
protecting both human health and the natural world.

19.1 Introduction
Hormones are broadly classified depending on the cell it acts upon as
endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and intracine. Endocrine hormones are
the group of hormones which acts on the target cells upon being secreted
by endocrine glands and circulate through the bloodstream; paracrine hor￾mones act on the neighboring cells upon release; autocrine hormones act
on the cells secreted by it; and intracine are hormones utilized by the cells
synthesizing it upon activation of signal transduction pathway.
Endocrine hormones are further classified depending on the solubility
of water and lipid-soluble. Water-soluble hormones (peptides/amino acid
derivatives) are transported readily whereas lipid hormones (steroids) form
ligandprotein complexes along with carrier plasma glycoproteins through
the circulatory system to target cells.
Water-soluble hormones act on the target cell surface by binding to
specific receptor proteins in the target cell resulting in the activation of
the signal transduction pathway via secondary messengers that activates
gene transcription in turn expressing the target protein in target cells.
Lipid hormones pass through the plasma membranes of target cells and act
directly in the nuclei of the target cells.
Hormones are responsible for the physiological functioning of the
human body by regulating a variety of metabolic processes and psycholog￾ical behaviors (Farkas et al., 2020; McHenry et al., 2014).

All rights reserved.Changes in levels of hormones cause hormonal imbalance, and signifi￾cant or rapid change diagnosed indicates the possibility of disease and dis￾ease condition (Adegoke et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). Thus early
detection by measuring the level of hormones has a significant role in the
identification of human diseases.
The traditional analysis methods of hormone include high￾performance liquid chromatography (Ozgocer et al., 2017), liquid chro￾matographymass spectrometry (Xu et al., 2021), and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Yuan et al., 2019) which are time-consuming, high
cost, and requires technical expertise for analysis.
Electrochemical biosensors offer benefits over conventional analytical
techniques, due to their quick response time, simplicity of use without tech￾nical expertise, cost-effectiveness, intrinsic sensitivity and selectivity which
have attracted a lot of attention for use in point-of-care diagnosis (Bian et al.,
2022; Chen et al., 2009; Mazloum-Ardakani et al., 2010; Shiraishi et al.,
2007; Stoytcheva et al., 2019; Xiao-bo et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2010).
19.2 Principle of electrochemical biosensors for detection
of hormones
19.2.1 Generally, an electrochemical biosensor consists of
three components, including biometric components, sensors,
and electronic systems
Electrodes are often modified with nanomaterials to amplify the detection
signal. Biosensor uses immobilized biosensitive materials (antibodies,
enzymes, aptamers, nucleic acids, etc.) as biometric elements to recognize
the required target molecule. The sensor thus converts the concentration
of analytes to electric signals proportionally (Hareesha & Manjunatha,
2020a; Manjunatha, 2017; Ronkainen et al., 2010).
Typically in electrochemical sensor, the electric signals are directly
proportional to the reaction under investigation which either generate a
measurable current at a constant voltage (amperometric) (Amine &
Mohammadi, 2018; Kasemo, 2002; Kubán & Hauser, 2015 ˇ ), a measurable
current over a potential change (voltammetric) (Goud et al., 2021; Yadav
& Sharma, 2019), a measurable potential difference or charge accumula￾tion (potentiometric) (Aragay & Merkoçi, 2012), and measurably altering
the conductive properties of a medium (conductometric) between elec￾trodes or impedance, both resistance and reactance, (impedimetric)
(Benson, 2005; Charithra & Manjunatha, 2019; Farma et al., 2013;
506 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsHareesha & Manjunatha, 2020b; Hareesha et al., 2019; Jg, 2017; Katz &
Willner, 2003; Manjunatha et al., 2014; Manjunatha, 2018; Manjunathaa
et al., 2014; Pushpanjali et al., 2019; Tigari et al., 2019).
19.3 Electrochemical detection of hormones
Hormones are categorized into different types depending on the biomo￾lecular nature of the hormone.
19.4 Amino acid derivatives
Amino acid hormones are hormones derived from amino acids, mainly
tyrosine. Examples of amino acid hormones are adrenaline or epinephrine
and noradrenaline or epinephrine released by the adrenal glands.
Triiodothyronine and thyroxine are released by the thyroid gland, mela￾tonin is released by the pineal gland, and dopamine is released by the sub￾stantia nigra. Amino acid hormones act as a neurotransmitter and
neurohormone in the mammalian central nervous system. The detection
of these hormones is based on the affinity of the hormone.
19.5 Adrenaline or epinephrine and noradrenaline or
norepinephrine
Adrenaline or epinephrine and noradrenaline or norepinephrine, which
are released by the adrenal glands, are important catecholamine neuro￾transmitters in the mammalian central nervous system (Nikolajsen &
Hansen, 2001). Epinephrine and norepinephrine regulate the blood pres￾sure, immune system, heart rate, lipolysis, and glycogenolysis.
Abnormal levels are observed in Parkinson disease. Epinephrine con￾centration levels are altered in conditions like orthostatic hypotension,
stress, and thyroid hormone deficiency, while norepinephrine concentra￾tion levels may lead to the occurrence of conditions such as ganglia neu￾roblastoma, ganglion neuronal, and paraganglioma.
Carbon paste electrode modified with single-walled carbon nanotube
(SWCNT) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) comprising
tyrosinase and Nafion membrane based on catalyzing property of oxida￾tion of epinephrine is used for the voltammetric detection and quantifica￾tion of epinephrine (EP) without the interference of ascorbic acid and
Nanostructured materials-based electrochemical biosensors for hormones 507uric acid (Apetrei & Apetrei, 2013; Babaei et al., 2011; Patrascu et al.,
2011; Zare & Nasirizadeh, 2010).
MWCNT modified with chitosan electrode through electrocatalytic
oxidation is also used as electrochemical sensor for the detection of epi￾nephrine (Chen et al., 2015; Ghica & Brett, 2013; Koteshwara Reddy
et al., 2017; Reddy et al., 2020). The electrochemical behavior of a multi￾walled carbon nanotube paste electrode modified with 2-((7-(2,5-dihy￾drobenzylideneamino) heptylimino)methyl)benzene-1,4-diol (DBHB)
(Beitollahi et al., 2018), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
(Rajabi et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016), bromothymol blue (BTB) (Pradhan
et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2014), vinyl ferrocene (VF) (Beitollahi et al.,
2014), nickel hydroxide nanoparticles (Babaei et al., 2015; Tsele et al.,
2017), and metal oxide nanoparticles (Figueiredo-Filho et al., 2014;
Kumar Gupta, 2017).
For detection of noradrenaline or norepinephrine, carbon paste elec￾trode (CPE) sensor modified with 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde-2,4-dini￾trophenylhydrazone (DDP) and CNT is used for voltammetric detection
and quantification (Huang et al., 2010; Queiroz et al., 2018; Salmanpour
et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2002).
19.6 Melatonin
Melatonin, chemically N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, an indoleamine
derived from L-tryptophan is a neurohormone released by pineal gland
responsible for the wake and sleep cycle (Zhao et al., 2019). Single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)- and multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs)-based sensors have been tested for the detection and quanti￾fication of melatonin (MT) (Babaei et al., 2013; Gomez et al., 2015; Qu
et al., 2005).
19.7 Triiodothyronine and thyroxine
Thyroxine (T4) is a thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.
Triiodothyronine (T3) is converted to thyroxine in target cells. Thyroxine
plays vital roles in the normal growth, metabolism, development of the
body, and in the maturation of sexual organs. MWNTDHP film-coated
GCE has been investigated for the detection and quantification of thyrox￾ine by electrochemical characterization (Wu et al., 2004).
508 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications19.8 Dopamine
Dopamine (DA) is an essential neurotransmitter in the nervous system of
humans responsible for activities such as motor control.
CNTs modified with overoxidized polypyrrole (OPPy) have been tested
for the detection and quantification of DA (Eom et al., 2019). Similarly,
MWCNTs modified with AgAu nanoparticles (Balasubramanian et al., 2020)
and graphene quantum dot have been tested and reported (Cesarino et al.,
2014; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2003).
19.9 Steroids and eicosanoids
Steroids are a group of hormones derived from cholesterol. Sex hor￾mones, estradiol and testosterone, and stress hormone, cortisol, are few
examples. Quantification of steroid hormones is mainly used for early
diagnosis of diseases, pregnancy, food toxicity, and pollution levels (Kelch
et al., 2020; Lenard, 1992).
Eicosanoid hormones are derived from lipids, prostaglandins, prostacyclin,
leukotrienes, and thromboxane that belong to this group of hormone. They
regulate pathological processes in female reproductive function
(Niringiyumukiza et al., 2018), inflammation, and tissue repair (Rael, 2016).
19.10 Testosterone
Testosterone is the most essential steroid released by testicular stromal cells
whose levels are related to many hormonal disorders in men and cardiovascu￾lar diseases (Gugoasa & Staden, 2018). Carbon paste electrode modified by
glutaraldehyde-fixed testosterone antibodies on phenylenediamine￾benzodithiophene polymer (pBDBT) (Bulut et al., 2020) and CNT has been
tested as the biosensor for testosterone detection in various body fluids (Goyal
et al., 2010; Gugoasa et al., 2015; Serafín et al., 2014).
19.11 Estrogen
Estrogen is a naturally occurring steroid hormone essential for the female
reproductive cycle, menstrual cycle, and growth (Nameghi et al., 2019).
Multiple electrochemical sensors are reported for the detection of 17β￾estradiol (Ahirwar et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018a, 2018b), a natural estrogen
secreted by humans (Pu et al., 2019). Estrogens at abnormal levels lead to
Nanostructured materials-based electrochemical biosensors for hormones 509obesity and infertility. Higher levels of estrogen are observed in the case
of breast cancer especially in initial tumor formation (Uliana et al., 2018).
Detection of 17β-estradiol using NiFe2O4-mesoporous carbon
(NiFe2O4-MC) nanocomposite (Tanrıkut et al., 2020), carbon dots, and
polyaniline composite (Supchocksoonthorn et al., 2021), screen-printed
carbon electrode with 17β-estradiol-imprinted poly(aniline-co-metanilic
acid) and tungsten disulfide (Lee et al., 2020) and screen-printed carbon
electrode with 4-carboxyphenyl radical (HOOC-PheSPCEs) (Ojeda
et al., 2015) has been tested.
Detection of estrone using glassy carbon electrode modified with mul￾tiwalled carbon nanotubes functionalized with carboxylic groups has been
tested (Okina et al., 2021).
19.12 Cortisol
Cortisol is a major glucocorticoid that reflects the stress state in the human
body. Abnormal levels of cortisol levels have the potency to cause hyper￾tension and damage to muscle tissue and immune system.
For noninvasive monitoring of stress level, detection of cortisol in
human saliva and sweat have been tested, an aptamerantibody sandwich
sensor modified with multiwalled carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon,
and silver nanoparticles (Yu et al., 2016), glassy carbon electrodes coated
with tin disulfide nanoparticles, cortisol antibody (C-Mab), and bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (Rajabi et al., 2016), polydimethylsiloxane thin
films layered with carbon nanotubes deposited with silver nanoparticles or
poly(GMA-co-EGDMA) (Eom et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Moreno￾Guzmán et al., 2013; Naik et al., 2022).
19.13 Progesterone
Progesterone is the most common biomarker for pregnancy (Goh et al.,
2016; Kanninen et al., 2019; Polat et al., 2020). Monitoring of progester￾one is helpful in the detection of autoimmune disease and reproduction
monitoring (Chang & Wang, 2020; Cui et al., 2021; Yu & Maeda, 2017).
Glassy carbon electrode modified using multiwalled carbon nanotubes,
AuNPs, and poly-L-serine (Naderi & Jalali, 2020), screen-printed carbon
electrode modified with graphene quantum dots, NiO-Au hybrid nanofi￾bers in combination with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Arvand &
510 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsHemmati, 2017), and label-free electrochemical progesterone aptasensor
have been tested for progesterone analysis (Samie & Arvand, 2020).
19.14 Calcitriol
Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin; vitamins D2 and D3 are the main
forms of vitamin D, and it is an immunomodulatory hormone (Binkley &
Wiebe, 2013; Charoenngam & Holick, 2020; Farrell & Herrmann, 2013).
GCE modified with composite material based on polyanili￾nepolypyrrole (PANI-PPY) copolymer doped with silvercobalt (Co￾Ag) and ionic liquid (IL) (Anusha et al., 2021) and graphene nanocompo￾site sensor (Thangphatthanarungruang et al., 2020) has been tested for the
measuring of vitamin D.
19.15 Proteins/peptides
Peptide or protein hormones are made of a chain of amino acids; exam￾ples include adiponectin, oxytocin, and insulin. These hormones bind to
intracellular receptors through an intracrine mechanism or they are packed
in vesicles and transported through the membrane.
19.16 Adiponectin
Adiponectin is a protein expressed in white adipose tissue; it is an anti￾inflammatory adipocytokine involved in glucose and lipid metabolism
(Thanakun et al., 2014). Adiponectin is a biomarker for obesity, insulin
resistance, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. CNTs functionalized by
treatment with 4-aminobenzoic acid in the presence of isoamylnitrite, fol￾lowed by oriented binding of anti-APN, have been tested for the mea￾surement of adiponectin levels (Ooi et al., 2014).
19.17 Follicle-stimulating hormone
Follicle-stimulating hormone is a gonadotropin secreted by basophils of the
anterior pituitary gland which can promote human reproduction and devel￾opment (Fan et al., 2021; Haller-Kikkatalo et al., 2012). Follicle-stimulating
hormone in combination with luteinizing hormone promotes the generation
and secretion of sex hormones. In men, the hormone promotes the produc￾tion of sperm, whereas in women the hormone promotes follicle
Nanostructured materials-based electrochemical biosensors for hormones 511development and maturation to produce estrogen and causes ovulation
(Pritchard et al., 1995; Santi & Simoni, 2014). High FSH value is observed
in the conditions such as ovarian agenesia and primary amenorrhea.
Conversely, low FSH value leads to polycystic ovarian syndrome (Robertson
et al., 2021). Quantification of the FSH level has an important clinical value
for the diagnosis and treatment of endocrine diseases and infertility.
Immunosensor based on a screen-printed electrode modified with
reduced graphene oxide, multiwalled carbon nanotubes, thionine, and
gold nanoparticles composite with anti-FSH for the detection of FSH has
been tested (Fan et al., 2021).
19.18 Human chorionic gonadotropin
Human chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein secreted by placenta tro￾phoblast cells that functions as a diagnostic biomarker for pregnancy and is
also a tumor marker.
Immunosensor based on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with
carbon nano-onions, gold nanoparticles, and polyethylene glycol compos￾ite and sensors based on the modified carbon macro- and microelectrodes
immobilized with anti-hCG antibodies to detect hCG have been reported
(Damiati et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2012).
19.19 Insulin
Generally, diabetes patients are reliant on the intake of adequate and accurate
amounts of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin is the hormone
which regulates the intake of glucose, glycolysis, and glycogenesis in the liver
and muscle and lipids and the synthesis of triglycerides in adipocytes.
Screen-printed electrode Nafionmultiwalled carbon nanotubes mod￾ified with nickel oxide nanoparticles (Rafiee & Fakhari, 2013), glassy car￾bon electrode coated with films of chitosan and multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (Wang & Musameh, 2004; Zhang et al., 2005), and carbon
fiber microelectrode modified with nickel nanoparticle and carbon nano￾tube (Lu et al., 2018) have been tested for the measurement of insulin.
19.20 Leptin
Leptin is a hormone related to obesity, vascular function, regeneration,
inflammation, and immunity (Carbone et al., 2012; Onger et al., 2017).
512 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsSWCNT functionalized with chitosan has been tested for the measure￾ment of leptin (Zhang et al., 2018).
19.21 Prolactin
Prolactin hormone is produced by lactotrope cells of the anterior pitui￾tary; it plays an important role in the stimulation of lactation and regulates
the growth and differentiation of the mammary gland and reproduction.
The immunosensor was composed of a carbon nanotube modified
with polyethylene dioxythiophene along with gold nanoparticles and
polypyrrole propionic acid on which the corresponding antibodies were
immobilized for prolactin estimation (Serafín et al., 2014; Serafín
Martínez-García et al., 2014; Sun, 2017).
19.22 Conclusion
Overall, current electrochemical biosensors for hormone use antibodies
and aptamers as recognition elements. The usage of the point-of-care
determination of hormones is limited to lateral flow assay, and measure￾ment is not as popular as other biomarkers. The use of functionalized
nanomaterials and analytical technologies for the development of electro￾chemical sensor and biosensor platforms with more selectivity and sensi￾tivity can be suitable for portable wearable sensors.

20.1 Introduction
Conventional item has been supplanted by advancements in nanomaterials
during the preceding 10 years, as has the development of biosensors that
are economically practical. To speed up the diagnosis process, point-of￾care biosensor-based testing is necessary as a detection strategy for the
consequences of the current epidemic. Instead of using ultrasensitive
label-free biosensors, integrating biosensors with nanostructures may boost
sensing and allow for downsizing. Notably, next-generation biosensors
might speed up the detecting process. In-depth descriptions of the various
functionalized nanomaterial types and their synthetic characteristics are
provided. Ultrasensitive label-free biosensors may have competition.
Notably, next-generation biosensors might speed up the detecting process.
In-depth descriptions of the various functionalized nanomaterial types and
their synthetic characteristics are provided (Bhalla et al., 2016; Lowe,
1984).
The virus is typically found via serological tests and real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) screening. Because the conventional methods for
detecting infectious diseases are so complicated, competent personnel is
needed. The currently known recorded traditional processes are expensive,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive (Kissinger, 2005). The application of
nanotechnology can aid in the diagnosis of viral infections. Nanotechnology
has recently supplanted conventional therapy (Tigari, Manjunatha, 2020;
Tigari, Manjunatha, 2020). There has been a tremendous increase in the

since they are determined to be fast, simple, responsive, and precise
(Hareesha et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2015).
Lowering the size of nanoparticles to the nano-range, or 1100 nm,
may boost their usefulness since they offer shrinkage and an improved sur￾face area, which have attracted a lot of attention. The surface-to-volume
ratio increases due to their nanoscale, allowing for efficient interactions
between the sensor and the analyte (Rahman et al., 2010). By fostering
effective interactions between analyte and biosensor, NM-based biosensors
have found broad usage in the detection of biomolecules and the diagno￾sis of illnesses (Jayanthi et al., 2017).
20.2 Biosensors
By producing signals proportionate to the concentrations of an analyte in
the interaction, a biosensor is an instrument that detects biological or
chemical processes. Signal transduction is the basis for how biosensors
work (Mun’delanji et al., 2015). A biotransducer, a biorecognition ele￾ment, and an electrical system made up of a screen, microprocessor, and
amplifiers are among these elements. The biorecognition component,
which functions as a bioreceptor, is permitted to communicate with a par￾ticular analyte (Yoo & Lee, 2010).
Leland C. Clark Jr., regarded as the “father of biosensors,” created the
first instrument to quickly ascertain the level of glucose in the blood. For
self-monitoring, many of the 18.2 million Americans with diabetes today
still use Clark’s initial glucose sensor idea. Biosensors have a number of
advantages when paired with nanomaterials, such as real-time analysis,
detection with a smaller sample, high-throughput screening, label-free
detection, and low limit of detection (Eggins, 2013; Turner et al., 1987;
Turner, 2013).
Nanostructures and nanomaterials study the properties of materials
utilized for numerous applications through downsizing. Innovative
therapeutic modalities at the nanoscale can be generated by fusing med￾ical research and nanotechnology (Pushpanjali, Manjunatha, 2020). NPs
can be utilized as a vehicle to deliver the drug-like molecule to the
desired location. These are made up of a variety of chemical and struc￾tural components, allowing them to have unique physicochemical
properties and creating new possibilities for a variety of biological appli￾cations (Zhu et al., 2021). Surface modification can help functionalized
526 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsNMs perform better as biosensors. They stand for the subsequent
generation of smart materials and have several uses. The following sec￾tion explores designed and synthesized NM-based biosensors with
biomedical applications (Rahman et al., 2010; Schultz, 1982; Yoo &
Lee, 2010).
20.2.1 Metal- and metal oxide-based biosensors
Infected mice were treated with the Env plasmid DNA vaccine using PEI
f-Au nanorings and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride, or PDDA),
according to Yu et al. (NRs). The seed solution of CTAB-AuNRs was
made by combining AuNRs with a precursor, and this mixture was then
used to make f-AuNRs. After that, poly(styrene sulfonate) was applied to
CTAB-Au, resulting in the development of negatively charged AuNRs.
To create f-AuNRs, these NRs were then subjected to a reaction with
PDDA or PEI. AuNRs were coated with contrasting surfaces as vaccina￾tion adjuvants, which caused the formation of an Au-Env complex
(Ansari et al., 2010; Kaushik, et al., 2009).
Flexible materials and metal oxides exhibit broadband gap semicon￾ductors, a high surface-to-volume ratio, and light excitation. They can
readily be included in the development of biosensors. Metal oxide-based
biosensors have recently been developed for a number of applications,
such as the detection of H2O2, urea, glucose, and even cancer cells and
viruses. In the instance of enzyme-immobilized biosensors, the configura￾tion of the enzyme’s matrix-binding conformation was unaltered by the
immobilization of an enzyme on the surface of nanostructured metal
oxide (NMO)-based electrodes. Biosensors are hence more reliable and
efficient in signal transmission (Zhang et al., 2011).
In order to create a range of biosensors, NMO-based immobilizing
matrices are currently gaining a lot of attention. NMOs are nontoxic and
biocompatible among their many other attributes. A recent study found
that NPs and NMOs can be coupled to enhance the characteristics of bio￾sensors. The extraordinary properties of NMOs may offer a variety of
avenues for the design of biosensing devices to satisfy future demands for
diagnostic equipment, owing to the substantial surface-to-volume ratio,
adsorption potential, and other unique characteristics (Raril &
Manjunatha, 2020). Selecting the right NMO is essential for the develop￾ment of a successful biosensor since the binding between the NMO and
the biomolecule determines the performance of the biosensor. This
Safety, health, and regulation issues of nanostructured biosensors 527binding is crucial for fostering a hospitable environment since the biomol￾ecule activity is rather constant. This creates opportunities for the creation
of low-cost, extremely sensitive, long-lasting, and LOD-low biosensors
(Nguyen et al., 2019).
20.2.2 CNT-based biosensors
Zhang et al. used polyethylene glycol to show functionalization (PEG).
On the surface of SWCNTs, a functional group termed -COOH was first
added, and subsequently, SOCl2 was added to create a group called
COCl. It was also coupled with PEG to produce PEG-SWCNTs, which
reduced cytotoxicity, caused less membrane damage, and enhanced
biocompatibility. The growth of the SWCNTs in the cell membrane and
their subsequent transfer to the cytoplasm were made easier by their
unique surface chemistry and fibrous structure. The nanotubes interacted
with the mitochondria of the PC12 neuronal cell, regulated a gene
involved in metabolism, and improved drug delivery (Prinith et al., 2021;
Pushpanjali et al., 2020; Pushpanjali, Manjunatha, & Srinivas, 2020).
Singh et al. demonstrated the use of ammonium-functionalized
MWCNTs (f-MWCNTs) for effective gene transport. f-MWCNTs con￾densed DNA in a manner similar to that of f-SWCNTs. MWCNT￾NH 1 , one of these three functionalized CNTs, condensed more DNA
than the other two due to its larger surface area for DNA binding. Tao
et al. described using poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) f￾MWCNTs in a metal template. Nitric acid was used to synthesize
MWCNTs, which then interacted with it to produce a carboxyl group at
the surface. Moreover, it reacted with hydroxyl-functionalized dendrons
via an ester linkage to produce their acid chloride derivative, which was
subsequently coupled with thionyl chloride to produce PAMAM￾MWCNTs. Yu et al. presented their research on DNA condensing and
improved genetic transformation using polyethyleneimine (PEI)-triggered
MWCNT heterojunctions. The heterostructure was produced when
MWCNTs interacted with acid to coordinate the carboxylic group, then
with PEI with the aid of the EDC/NHC coupling that covalently bound
MWCNTs (Borisov & Wolfbeis, 2008; Ronkainen et al., 2010).
20.2.3 Polymer-based polyphosphoric acid biosensors
The high surface energy of the SiO2 NPs tends to cause them to form
aggregates. Inappropriate dispersion into the polyurethane (PU) matrix
528 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationscomes from this. Gao et al. treated the SiO2 NP surface with poly(propyl￾ene glycol) phosphate ester to get around this (PPG-P). The esterification
of polyphosphoric acid with PPG produced PPG-P.Thef-SiO2 NPs
showed a decrease in surface energy, increase in stability, no aggregation,
and uniformly distributed SiO2 NPs into the PU matrix. To improve the
mechanical strength, thermal stability, and gas permeability of the polymer
material, Naka et al. published the organic form of SiO2 NPs as 3-
aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane
(MPTMS), phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS), and vinyltriethoxysilane
(VTES). The f-SiO2 NPs are denoted as SNP, AP-SNP, MP-SNP, P￾SNP, and V-SNP, respectively (Sun et al., 2018).
20.2.4 Enzyme-based biosensors
The foundation of an enzyme biosensor is a biochemical reaction
between an analyte and a biocatalyst placed on a suitable substrate. With
the creation of a new generation of biosensors in which active enzyme
sites are directly coupled to an NMO electrode, resulting in direct elec￾tron transfer between the enzyme and NMO and better biosensing capa￾bilities, nanostructured metal oxides show strong possibilities for bridging
biological recognition events with electronic signal transduction.
Nanostructured electrodes made of metal oxides provide a biocompatible
electroactive surface for the immobilization of enzymes with improved
form, orientation, and biological activity (Amine et al., 2006). A lot of
oxido-reductases, for instance, contain protein shells that electrically
shield their redox centers. Enzymes cannot be reduced or oxidized at the
electrode surface at any voltage. The possibility for direct electron trans￾fer between enzymes and the NMO-based electrode surface, which may
eliminate the need for co-substrates or mediators and enable efficient
transduction of biorecognition events, may aid in the development of
improved reagent-less biosensing devices. A redox site frequently finds it
challenging to get close to an electrode without delivering a sizable
overpotential, which could contaminate the electrode surface and lead to
enzyme denaturation. Direct electron transfer can be enhanced by coat￾ing an enzyme or electrode with a mediator or a nanoparticle (Sun et al.,
2016).
To improve biosensing performance in a variety of applications, many
strategies have been used to create biosensor components, particularly in
the domain of NMO-based immobilizing matrices and transducers
Safety, health, and regulation issues of nanostructured biosensors 529(electrochemical and optical). Numerous synthetic methods, including
doping nanomaterials and creating organic/inorganic nanocomposites,
have been used to create nanostructured metal oxides with important
optical, electrochemical, and molecular characteristics. Particularly, it has
been discovered that NMOs with tailored shape, size (for biocompatibil￾ity), functionality, adsorption capability, and high biomolecule loading
capacity provide improved electron transfer between biomolecules and
electrodes. An NMO’s microenvironment allows an enzyme to maintain
its shape while retaining its full biological activity, improving signal trans￾mission and biosensor stability. Surface plasmon resonance has been used
to create sensitive and selective biosensors; however, creating such com￾plicated systems takes a lot of effort, money, and knowledge (Raril &
Manjunatha, 2020). On the other hand, simple electrochemical methods
like cyclic voltammetry can be used to produce biosensors quickly and
inexpensively. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) can be used to
enhance the properties of an electrochemical biosensor. Recently used for
signal transduction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a
nondestructive electrochemical analytical technique that has been particu￾larly helpful in elucidating the mechanisms of charge transfer resistance
arising from electron transport between a biomolecule and the electrode
surface. Many biomedical and environmental applications hold consider￾able potential for electrochemical devices because of their benefits in
terms of size, cost, detection limit, response time, long-term stability, and
power requirements. Numerous electrochemical biosensing devices with
enhanced sensitivity and selectivity have been created using nanostruc￾tured metal oxides with a variety of surface designs.
20.3 Recent development in nanostructured biosensors
The evolving field of biomedical diagnosis is continuously influencing the
development of NBBD. Lab-on-a-chip is the result of advancements in
miniaturization, microfluidics, and the integration of all assay procedures
and/or reagents onto a miniature device. By combining sensors, fluidics,
and signal processing circuits, nanotechnology will enable the continued
shrinking of bioanalytical systems, enabling the large-scale integration of
many biological reactions on a single platform (Turner et al., 1987;
Turner, 2013).
Integrated lab-on-a-chip devices are still being developed, and numer￾ous nanotechnology components will be used. In the past 10 years, the
530 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsdomains of in vitro diagnostics, imaging, and therapies have seen an
extensive application of NMs. They have made it possible to simulta￾neously identify several disease biomarkers and to diagnose diseases at an
extremely early stage. They have also made it possible to investigate the
detection of ultra-trace concentrations of target analytes and have pro￾duced ultrasensitive, quick, and economical assays that only require a
small amount of sample. The most promising options for the creation of
high-throughput protein arrays are thought to be the NMs. The neces￾sary materials with precise absorptive, emissive, and light scattering capa￾bilities can be created by adjusting the size, shape, composition, structure,
and other physical/chemical features of NMs. Additionally, the bioconju￾gated NPs have been used for assays and other biomolecule recognition
events that need signal amplification. However, point-of-care diagnostics,
which will allow patients and primary-care doctors to conduct assays in
their various settings, will be the most promising area of nanotechnology
use. In addition to their brightness and sharp bandwidth, NPs’ long-term
stability will be crucial for developing novel techniques for the identifica￾tion, validation, and application of ultrasensitive biomarkers in clinical
settings. The utilization of nanostructures (nanopores, nanowires, nano￾pillars, and nanogaps)-based devices can further give the single-molecule
detection capabilities. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be used to identify
the genetic sequence in a sample. The NMs-based imaging agents pro￾vide extra information relevant to the physiology and function apart
from the anatomical information, which enables more accurate and early
illness diagnosis, such as the very sensitive identification of early-stage
cancer, consequently leading to improved therapy. Similarly, it is possible
to track treatment effectiveness more promptly and precisely. Targeted
treatments will use plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and drug delivery, and
the initial applications will undoubtedly be in the treatment of cancer.
The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of medicines are enhanced by
the use of NPs (Manjunatha & Hussain, 2022; Manjunatha, 2020). By
avoiding the exposure of healthy tissues, they deliver the medications
directly to the disease-causing locations in the body, increasing their
availability at the target site and lowering the treatment dose. These
nanotechnology advancements will be very helpful in converting from
late-stage diagnosis (including expensive and socially demanding therapy)
to early-stage diagnosis (relatively less expensive and less invasive). The
following is a description of the most popular NMs in NBBD
(Jeevanandam et al., 2018).
Safety, health, and regulation issues of nanostructured biosensors 53120.4 Issues: safety
Different heavy metal ions, such as Pb2 1 , Hg2 1 , Ag 1 , Cd2 1 , and
Cu2 1 , are present and come from a variety of sources. These ions have
a dangerous impact on people and their surroundings. The continuous
growth of agricultural and industrial achievements, together with the
insufficient discharge of heavy metal ions from wastewater and residential
emissions, all contribute to the accumulation of heavy metals in various
settings (Sun et al., 2015, 2016). The ferreting out of the trace heavy
metal ions by skillful procedures is therefore highly wanted to ensure the
security of the environment as well as the health analysis (Alocilja &
Radke, 2003; Mantecca et al., 2017).
20.5 Issues: health
Bionanomaterials may also be linked to risk factors despite their benefits.
Bionanomaterials have the potential to harm many human organs and tis￾sues and are linked to a number of illnesses. Neurological problems may
be accelerated by nanoparticle exposure (e.g., Parkinson’s disease and
Alzheimer’s disease), lung (asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and cancer),
and cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, arrhythmia, thrombosis, and
hypertension). Nanoparticle exposure can also result in additional skin
issues such as urticaria, dermatitis, and skin irritation. The exposure time
and dose are two main elements that affect how harmful the various
nanomaterials are. By dividing the molar concentration of nanoparticles in
the media by the exposure period, the exposure dose can be calculated.
The toxicity of the nanoparticles may, however, also be influenced by
additional variables (such as aggregation and concentration effects). For
example, some nanoparticles can group together. The toxicity of these
aggregates (in the micrometer range) may be reduced since they may not
easily enter the body. The size of the nanoparticles also affects their toxic￾ity because smaller nanoparticles, such as those less than 10 nm, can pass
through cell membranes and may be more dangerous than bigger ones
(Siegrist et al., 2019). The toxicity of nanoparticles is also influenced by
their shape, and this toxicity may vary depending on the aspect ratio. For
instance, smaller asbestos fibers can cause mesothelioma and asbestosis
while larger asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer. The nanoparticles effect
is thus directly related to surface area and inversely proportional to nano￾particles size. The crystal structure can also have an impact on oxidative
532 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsprocesses, subcellular localization, and cell uptake. For instance, a compar￾ison of two polymorphous TiO2 NP structures revealed that one oxidizes
DNA damage but not the other. Through oxidation and translocation
mechanisms, the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles can potentially
contribute to their hazardous effects (Leggiadro, 2000; Verstrepen et al.,
2004).
20.6 Issues: food
Only foods that are fresh and devoid of pollutants and contaminants are
fit for consumption. It is indeed difficult to find food contaminants and
adulterants at low levels with standard detection systems. As a result,
nanoparticles were investigated for their high sensitivity in detecting
harmful substances and bacteria (Manjunatha Charithra & Manjunatha,
2020; Ping et al., 2012). When food items are stored over their expiration
date and are exposed to air and moisture, they typically deteriorate.
Individual packets cannot be tested for food deterioration in a lab.
Instead, spot indicator-based nanoparticles are sensitive and simple to label
on individual shipments (Griesche & Baeumner, 2020; Singh et al., 2011).
A category of poisonous and cancer-causing substances known as afla￾toxins are present in food that has been tainted with Aspergillus flavus and
Aspergillus parasiticus. For the detection of aflatoxin B1, bifunctional nano￾particles using antiaflatoxin antibodies have been employed. Aflatoxin M1
has also been found in milk using superparamagnetic beads carrying antia￾flatoxin M1 antibodies and gold nanoprobes (Amine et al., 2006; Thakur
& Ragavan, 2013).
The antioxidants and vitamins included in food products are easily
broken down. Vitamins in food items have been detected using nanopar￾ticles. Anemia, cancer development, and heart attacks can all result from
folic acid deficiency. It has been claimed that MWCNT and
SWCNTionic liquid nanocomposites can detect folic acid in wheat
flour, fruit juices, and milk samples. NiO NPs have been used for the
identification of vitamin and ascorbic acid (Wang et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2022).
20.7 Issues: agriculture
The significant concerns from scientists about the detrimental effects of
agricultural production on biodiversity have reassured green initiatives
Safety, health, and regulation issues of nanostructured biosensors 533toward sustainable agricultural practices. To avoid the harmful conse￾quences of soil pollutants and/or toxins, quick identification is necessary.
In particular, the community of nanobiosensors values the achievements
of nanotechnology. Additionally, the significance of biosensors was noted
in the environmental and/or soil health assessment. Due to their outstand￾ing characteristics, nanostructured metal alloys satisfy this requirement,
particularly those made of carbon nanotubes, graphene (Kosynkin et al.,
2012), and photothermal conversion nanoparticles, and have a promising
future in the field of microbial detection in soil (Velasco-Garcia &
Mottram, 2003).
Along with the rapidly diminishing amount of land and rising produc￾tion costs, the growing global population and the depletion of natural
resources are among the main obstacles to the sustainability of the agricul￾tural and food industries (Silva et al., 2019). The efficient use of natural
resources is based on the application of nanosensors. In particular, nano￾biosensors have a wide range of uses in the agri-food chain, including the
detection of soil conditions, the management of severe infections, the
detection of crop diseases brought on by pests and pathogens, and the use
of diagnostic tools for pest detection during storage and final quality assur￾ance (Griesche & Baeumner, 2020).
In order to give both academic and industrial researchers insightful
information, the benefits and limitations are also explored.
Additionally, new patents have been highlighted in order to give the
agri-food business the most recent developments in biosensors and
ensure sustainable development. Due to their wide range in the hered￾itary and physiological domains, biomaterials have become desirable
identification instruments in the worldwide industry. They are able to
calculate the behavioral, immune, and metabolic reactions of cattle
and fishery animals (Manjunatha Charithra & Manjunatha, 2020). To
examine the different aspects influencing the environment and the
physiology of animals, innovative biosensing techniques proposed
extremely customized monitoring systems. Such devices provide a
quick analysis of the monitoring parameters and are dependable, sim￾ple to use, extremely sensitive, and selective. Nanobiosensors have sig￾nificant applications in the management of livestock, including the
monitoring of health, the detection of infectious disease-causing agents
and reproductive cycles, health status, animal feeding, and grazing
behavior, antibiotic side effects, and the living conditions of animals
(Tothill, 2001).
534 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications20.8 Regulations
Strong chemical bioactivity and reactivity, the ability to permeate cells,
tissues, and organs, and improved bioavailability are all characteristics of
nanomaterials. NMs are excellent in biomedical applications due to their
unique characteristics (Jantzen et al., 2016). These benefits, however, can
come with a toxicity risk. As a result, a number of government organiza￾tions have implemented controls through laws, statutes, and rules to lessen
or completely eradicate worries about NMs. Toxicology testing, environ￾mental impact assessment, and production, handling, and labeling stan￾dards, protocols, or legal definitions are all lacking in detail on the
worldwide level.
The USA and the European Union (EU) currently have strong regula￾tory frameworks and directive legislation to reduce any hazards associated
with NMs. NMs are expressly mentioned in a number of technical
recommendations and EU laws that the European Commission has issued.
To guarantee regulatory uniformity and that an NM used in one sector
would have been regarded similarly when it was used in others, this rule
has indeed been applied inside the EU. The requirements of the products
and substances meet the requirements of the European Chemical
Agency’s (REACH) and the European Classification and Labelling of
Chemicals’ (CLP) substance definitions, making the provisions of these
regulations relevant. In order to calculate the hazards related to NMs, the
EU has also established the Scientific Committee on Emerging and
Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
20.9 Conclusion
Approaches for making synthetic and organic carbon nanoparticles safer￾by-design primarily focus on lowering risk and preventing the release of
bionanomaterials into the surroundings. In reality, the emphasis on dan￾gers is frequently on hazardous situations or portions of said total dangers.
Inadequate toxic information, discrepancies between experimental nano
and those that individuals or cells are exposed to in real life, and barter
between usefulness and safety are significant barriers to safer-by-design.
The management of size, doping, loading, regulating form and crystallin￾ity, and lowering the amount of chemicals at the surface of nanoparticles
which lead to danger are a few of the suggested methods for reducing the
risk for bionanomaterials.
Safety, health, and regulation issues of nanostructured biosensors 535Nanomaterial releases could be minimized by isolating nanomaterial
production and processing, improving the integrity and toughness of
nanocomposites, designing products to be disassembled, and effectively
recycling materials. When creating nanocomposites, one may try to dis￾charge less dangerous pieces into the environment during the use stage.
However, once in the environment, such pieces released from nanocom￾posites can become more dangerous.

21.1 Introduction
Nanotechnology is the branch of science associated with the synthesis of
nanosized materials and their use in various applications. Nanoparticles
can be defined as materials with sizes between 1 and 100 nm. As the size
of the substances decreases, the surface area increases. The very small size
of the nanoparticles provides a high surface-to-volume ratio. Increasing
this ratio makes the nanoparticles more chemically reactive. They have
different and enhanced magnetic, optical, electrical, physical, biological,
chemical, and mechanical properties compared to macrosized materials
(Rajapaksha et al., 2021).
Nanoparticles can easily penetrate the cell, reaching the cell
nucleus and mitochondria. Oral, dermal, or respiratory exposure of
humans to nanoparticles can lead to a variety of toxicological effects,
such as DNA damage and oxidative stress (Kumar Das et al., 2022;
Marouzi et al., 2021).
Several physical and chemical approaches can be used to create nano￾particles, but both have drawbacks. For example, the chemical method
uses hazardous materials and requires long, expensive synthesis processes,
whereas the physical method uses expensive machinery and high energy
requirements (Campuzano et al., 2021). In recent years, researchers have
led to a green synthesis approach, which is an environmentally friendly,
less costly, and efficient nanoparticle synthesis method, to reduce these
negative effects. The green synthesis method is an approach to reduce the
carbon footprint, thus avoiding the climate change problems that have
increased in recent years (Garner & Keller, 2014). Natural resources such
as microorganisms and plants are extremely valuable because of their
accessibility and affordability, and the compounds they contain can serve

green chemistry with nanotechnology to generate harmless materials, is a
crucial step in preventing adverse impacts on both human health and the
environment (Aarthye & Sureshkumar, 2021; Agarwal et al., 2017).
Electrochemical biosensors attract great attention from researchers due
to their simple and convenient design, high sensitivity, and miniaturization
and are suitable for the development of portable devices (Maduraiveeran
et al., 2018). In recent years, with their rising popularity and advances in
science, electrochemical sensing platforms have also made great advances.
In electrochemical biosensors, gold, silver, platinum, glassy carbon electro￾des (GCEs), carbon paste electrodes (CPEs), pencil graphite electrodes
(PGEs), and screen-printing electrodes (SPEs) are used to generate
analyte-dependent signals (Balliamada Monnappa et al., 2019; Hareesha,
Manjunatha, Amrutha, Pushpanjali, et al., 2021; Hareesha, Manjunatha,
Amrutha, Sreeharsha, et al., 2021; Manjunatha, 2019; Pushpanjali et al.,
2020; Prinith & Manjunatha, 2020; Prinith et al., 2019; Raril &
Manjunatha, 2018). Electrodes that have not been modified with any
nanomaterial may pose limited sensitivity and stability problems. In addi￾tion, factors such as pH and ionic strength during the immobilization or
incubation stages of biological molecules in the sensor affect the responses
of important biosensor classes such as immunosensors (Grieshaber et al.,
2008). For this reason, these negative effects can be prevented by using
nanomaterials (carbonaceous materials, metal, metal oxides, bimetallic,
etc.) in the creation of these biosensor platforms. The concept of green
chemistry is also reflected in the designs of these platforms (Zhang & Wei,
2016). With the acceleration of green nanotechnology studies, the work￾ing electrodes used in electrochemical biosensors have begun to be modi￾fied with natural-origin nanomaterials. The use of these nontoxic green
nanoplatforms is of great interest as they increase the sensing properties of
the biosensor.
In this chapter, the types of nanomaterials produced by the green syn￾thesis method, green chemistry, their advantages in terms of human
health, and current electrochemical biosensor applications using these
nanomaterials are discussed. The advantages of nanoplatforms prepared
using naturally sourced consumables for enzyme-based biosensor, immu￾nosensor, and aptasensor applications in terms of parameters such as detec￾tion limit, detection range, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity are
discussed. In conclusion, possible challenges and solutions in building
green nanoplatforms and future prospects are given.
542 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications21.1.1 Green nanomaterials
Green synthesis of nanoparticles is simple, cost-effective, and eco-friendly,
allowing them to be produced in a minimum time and with less effort,
hence obtaining highly functional products with low toxicity.
Green synthesis is one step ahead of other synthesis methods because it
does not require the use of toxic and carcinogenic substances that threaten
human health. The use of renewable chemicals has facilitated the work of
researchers in the laboratory and has been a response to their needs. Thus
the toxicological effects that will occur from human exposure are elimi￾nated (Kumar Das et al., 2022). This method also offers researchers a sus￾tainable, promising alternative by reducing the possibility of
environmental hazards (Dönmez, 2020). Synthesis can be carried out in
one step using biological organisms such as bacteria, yeasts, algae, and
plants. Using this method, nanoparticles of the desired size and shape can
be synthesized and easily characterized. Microorganisms can also be used
to produce nanoparticles, but the rate of synthesis is slow, and only a lim￾ited number of sizes and shapes are suitable for this method compared to
synthesis methods involving plant materials (Alsaiari et al., 2023; Khan
et al., 2018), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Zaynitdinova et al., 2018) and
Escherichia coli (Hassan & Mahmood, 2019) are examples of bacterial spe￾cies most used to obtain green nanoparticles.
Plants are the most commonly used materials in the green synthesis
method. Various parts of plants such as leaves, roots, latex, fruits, seeds,
and stems are used. During the processes of biological synthesis that take
place, secondary metabolites belonging to these parts of plants are consid￾ered the active component of the synthesis process. These metabolites are
phytochemicals used as reducing agents, such as terpenoids, flavonoids,
carotenoids, alkaloids, vitamins, tannins, saponins, and phenolic acids.
They can be used as a reducing and a capping agent for the synthesis and
stabilization of nanoparticles (Hayrunnisa et al., 2017; Noah & Ndangili,
2022). Using various plant extracts, carbon-based such as carbon quantum
(Chellasamy et al., 2022; Rezaei et al., 2018; Rooj et al., 2018), carbon
nanotube (Sivasakthi et al., 2020), graphene (Chinnaraj et al., 2021; Singh
et al., 2016) nanomaterials can be synthesized, as well as metal
(Basavegowda & Rok Lee, 2013; Khalilzadeh & Borzoo, 2016) and metal
oxide nanoparticles (George & Mathew, 2020; Zheng, Huang, Shi, Fu,
2019). In the literature, many studies have been carried out using different
plants in obtaining nanoparticles, and the number of these studies is
Advances in green synthesis of nanostructured biosensors 543increasing today. For example, there are a number of studies using various
parts of plants such as Camellia japonica leaves (Karthik et al., 2017), Citrus
sinensis peels (Masibi et al., 2020), Zingiber officinale roots (Dönmez, 2020),
and Annona squamosa seed (Singh et al., 2021) extracts. Fig. 21.1 shows
the stages of metal nanoparticle synthesis from plant extracts. These nano￾materials are used alone or with different carbon, metal, and metal oxide
nanomaterials in the construction of green biosensors.
Moussa et al. performed for the first time a new one-step synthesis of
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) decorated with silver nanoparticles
(rGO-AgNPs) using Allium sativum (garlic) extract, which is both cost￾effective and environmentally friendly. For the preparation of garlic
extract, which is used as a reducing agent in green synthesis, first garlic
cloves were washed and cut into small pieces. About 80 g of crushed
garlic was added to 200 mL of distilled water and mixed in a magnetic
stirrer at 80°C for 1 hour. The obtained extract was used as a green
reducing agent in the synthesis of nanoparticles. The resulting rGO￾AgNPs were successfully integrated with molecularly imprinted polymer
(MIP) to selectively and sensitively detect lactic acid, an important agent
in cancer cell screening. In this study, high selectivity and high sensitiv￾ity were obtained by replacing expensive enzymes with molecularly
imprinted polymers. At the same time, the study has advantages over
other reported methods such as simplicity and cheapness thanks to green
approaches (Ben Moussa et al., 2022).

544 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsChinnaraj et al. produced a low-cost and environmentally friendly
AgNPs/GO nanocomposite using Goniothalamus wightii (G. wightii)
leaves as a reducing and stabilizing agent. G. wightii was washed thor￾oughly with distilled water, cut into small pieces, and then dried. The
dried leaves (25 g) were finely ground and pulverized. The extract was
prepared by keeping 2 g of biomass (G. wightii leaves) in a 250-mL coni￾cal flask with 100 mL of distilled water for 24 hours. As a result of the
addition of 10 mL of G. wightii leaf extract to 90 mL of silver nitrate
aqueous solution, Ag ions were reduced, and as shown in Fig. 21.2, the
color of silver nitrate has changed from colorless to brown. The
obtained nanomaterial-modified GCEs were used as sensitive sensors for
the quantification of antiprotozoal and antibiotic metronidazole (MIZ).
The AgNPs@GO nanocomposites have successfully detected MIZ in
pharmaceutical tablets, making them more suitable for applied applica￾tion (Chinnaraj et al., 2021).
In another study, Shivakumar et al. obtained AgNPs by green syn￾thesis method using Eucalyptus extract. Hemicellulose is used as a reduc￾ing agent in green synthesis of AgNPs. GCE modified with NPs was
used for nitrobenzene determination using differential pulse voltam￾metric technique (DPV). The study has shown that metal nanoparticles
produced by green synthesis can be useful as components of sensors
(Shivakumar et al., 2020).
Khan et al. used Astragalus membranaceus extract as a reducing and
capping agent to stabilize the metal and prevent the aggregation of

modified with ZnO nanoflowers was used in the determination of 4-
nitrophenols. In the determination made using the cyclic voltammetry
(CV) method, the lower limit of the determination was obtained as
0.08 M. Phenolic compounds from Astragalus membranaceus not only
provided a low detection limit but also facilitated electron transfer
(Khan et al., 2021).
Green nanomaterials have properties such as insulator, optical, antimi￾crobial, antioxidant, anti-metastasis, biocompatibility, stability, and manip￾ulability. Furthermore, biosynthesized nanoparticles are used in many
different applications such as targeted drug delivery (Memon et al., 2020;
Zamarchi & Vieira, 2021), cancer therapy (Sharifi et al., 2019), antibacte￾rial agents (Sharmila et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2016), and sensors—biosen￾sors (Dayakar et al., 2018; Thenrajan et al., 2022). The green synthesis
method has attracted an increasing amount of interest due to the need for
the development and production of biosensors (Lu et al., 2013; Rawtani
et al., 2020). Analytical applications of green nanomaterials include cata￾lytic application and used as a component of sensors.
21.1.2 Electrochemical biosensors
Sensors are systems that can translate changes in an environment into
detectable signals. Biosensors allow a biological event to be converted into
an electrical signal. The primary purpose of the biosensor is to provide
fast, accurate, and reliable information about the analysis. Biosensors are
the result of the reaction of a biological component that selectively inter￾acts with the substance to be analyzed into a meaningful signal and then
used with a mechanism that transmits this signal (Chakraborty & Hashmi,
2021; Kim et al., 2023).
Biosensors consist of the following basic components. These biologi￾cal elements called analyte-specific bioreceptors (e.g., enzyme, DNA
probe, antibodies, aptamers) and transducer segments are used to convert
the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biore￾ceptor into an electronic signal. Bioreceptors contain a selective recogni￾tion mechanism because they have a biomolecular structure. They are
highly sensitive biological structures that selectively interact with the
substance to be analyzed. This specific interaction prevents the interfer￾ence of signals from other substances with the desired biosensor signal
(Rezaei et al., 2018).
546 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsThe signal is amplified via a signal processor and presented as digital
data. Transducers are the part that converts the biological reaction of bior￾eceptors into a meaningful, measurable electrical signal. These can be of
various types such as optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, calorimetric,
and thermal. Electrochemical methods are frequently used in biosensors
today because of their low cost, simple design, and minimizable features
(Dolatabadi et al., 2011; Maduraiveeran et al., 2018). Nowadays, electro￾chemical biosensors are widely used in the analysis of biomarkers, vita￾mins, drug substances, enzymes, chemical residues, and foodstuffs
(Grieshaber et al., 2008).
21.2 Fabrication of electrochemical nanobiosensors
For the effective development of biosensors, parameters such as stability,
fast response time, and low limit of detection (LOD) should be considered
for the selective detection of analytes. The following problems can be
overcome with the use of nanomaterials in the fabrication of electrochem￾ical biosensors.
• Stability: vulnerable to atmospheric and environmental degradation.
• Slow response time: by weakly binding analyte-specific bioreceptors.
• Low LOD: low sensitivity.
• Poor reproducibility: low accuracy.
Thanks to the more stable surfaces obtained after nanomaterial modifi￾cation, it provides reproducible platforms to be obtained. The use of
nanomaterials and biorecognition elements of the biosensor, such as
DNA, RNA, aptamers, enzymes, and antibodies, is placed on the trans￾ducer surface with high stability and stability. As a reflection of nanotech￾nological developments, the developed nanobiosensors contribute to new
technologies such as lab-on-a-chip and wearable sensors, which are inte￾grated into the smartphone and provide bedside analysis.
The use of nanomaterials exhibiting unique physical, chemical, and
optical properties in electrochemical biosensor platforms leads to increased
sensitivity and selectivity. These nanomaterials can be modified to the sen￾sor surface by physical adsorption using electrostatic force, van der Waals
forces, and hydrogen or ionic bonds. With the chemical method, modifi￾cation is carried out using strong chemical bonds, such as covalent bonds,
between the functional group of the biological recognition element and
the surface of the converter (Sandhyarani, 2019; Sassolas et al., 2012).
Advances in green synthesis of nanostructured biosensors 547Surface functionalization of nanomaterials increases their binding affin￾ity, which could be useful in the development of nanobiosensors that can
detect analytes. Also, surfaces of nanomaterials can be coated with surfac￾tants, biomolecules, and other agents. Nanomaterials have been shown to
be particularly beneficial for the construction of nanobiosensors because
they have a large surface area, a porous structure, a high loading capacity,
and can bind selectively to the analyte (Nayak et al., 2022).
21.2.1 Use of green nanomaterials in electrochemical
nanobiosensors
Green nanomaterials can be used as components of biosensors with their
biocompatible structures, low pollutant waste consumption, and easy syn￾thesis, providing unique properties to the electrochemical biosensor sur￾face. These nanomaterials have important effects on the analytical
properties of biosensors such as stability, selectivity, reproducibility, and
sensitivity. Improving the mentioned features of biosensors at lower cost
allows them to be used in many different areas. Table 21.1 summarizes
the information on electrochemical biosensor platforms created with vari￾ous green nanomaterials.
21.2.1.1 Green nanostructures in enzyme-based biosensors
Electrochemical converters are frequently used in enzyme-based biosen￾sors, which are based on quite old enzymes. Enzymes immobilized on the
nanobiosensor platform help to determine various analytes according to
the catalytic reaction rate that occurs with biological mechanisms. The
mode of action for enzymatic measurement may be from the rate of ana￾lyte metabolized by the enzyme, the rate of activation/inhibition of
enzymes by the analyte, or the rate of change in enzyme change by the
analyte (Sassolas et al., 2012; Soylemez & Kurbanoglu, 2021). Current
studies show that the development of green synthesis nanostructures for
use in various biosensor applications is a relatively new field.
There are not many studies available on the use of green synthesis
nanomaterials in amperometric biosensors. Gayda et al., discovered the
properties of extracellular biological reduction of Cr(VI) through Cr(V) to
Cr(III) by some yeasts, including baker’s yeast as well as nonconventional
yeasts (Candida guilliermondii, Ogataea polymorpha, etc.). In the previous
study of the same group, green gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthe￾sized by the yeast Ogataea polymorpha. Different sizes (2040 nm) and
shapes have been synthesized, from triangular nanoprisms to nearly

In this study, different green metallic nano￾particles such as AuNPs, AgNPs, Cr2O3NPs, PdNPs, and PtNPs were
synthesized by using extracellular metabolites of Maya Ogataea polymorpha
as reducing agents. They investigated the inhibition properties of laccase
and alcohol oxidase enzymes of these synthesized green metallic nanopar￾ticles. According to the results obtained with various characterization
techniques such as X-ray microanalysis (SEM-XRM), AFM, and FTIR,
PdNPs with the most effective results were selected for the enzyme bio￾sensors to be created (Gayda et al., 2019).
These enzyme-based amperometric nanobiosensors were prepared
with green PdNPs. The graphite working electrodes (GE) were modified
with green PdNPs by the drop-casting method. Then, enzyme biosensors
were obtained by dripping laccase, alcohol oxidase (AO), and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) enzymes onto modified GE/PdNPs. For the stability of
the biorecognition element, a mixture containing 1% chitosan and 0.5%
polyethyleneimine solutions (1:1, v/v) was used on the biosensor surfaces.
The analytical properties of laccase/GE and PdNPs-modified laccase￾gPdNPs/GE were studied by chronoamperometry to show their activities
against two known laccase substrates, bisphenol A (BPA) and 2,2'-azino￾bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Laccase-gPdNPs/GE
was found to have a 1.5 times smaller sensitivity but a 1.2 times wider lin￾ear range compared to laccase-GE. Similarly, AO/HRP-gPdNPs/GE has
a 1.6-fold wider linear range for methanol than results obtained by chron￾oamperometry of unmodified AO/HRP/GE and modified AO/HRP￾gPdNPs/GE against substrate methanol. found. As a result, according to
the results obtained with different enzyme biosensors, green PdNP came
to the forefront with the advantages of being less sensitive to substrates
but with both a wide linear range and high stability (Gayda et al., 2019).
In another study, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) embedded with
nitrogen-doped carbon sheets (ZnONPs@NDCSs) were synthesized and
used in biosensor design for glucose determination by Muthuchamy and
coworkers. In this study, while ZnONPs@NDCS composite was synthe￾sized using a simple hydrothermal method, peach extract precursor was
used to obtain ZnONPs (Fig. 21.3). After washing and drying the GCE
surface used as the working electrode, it was modified using
ZnONPs@NDCS. Afterward, the glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme was
immobilized on the modified surface, and the enzyme biosensor was used.
Both CV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results
showed that the developed GCE/ZnONPs@NDCS/GOx biosensor
554 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsprovided a more efficient electron transfer path between the electrode
and glucose. While designing the biosensor, some parameters including
applied voltage, GOx loading, pH, and temperature were optimized to
achieve maximum amperometric performance. A linear working range of
0.212 mM was achieved when optimal conditions were set. Moreover,
using the developed biosensor, glucose determination in human serum
samples was successfully performed with a LOD level of 6.3 μM
(Muthuchamy et al., 2018).
By using green nanomaterials, different analytes can be determined
without using enzymes (Dayakar et al., 2017; Erkmen et al., 2021). Ilgar
et al. developed a nonenzymatic biosensor for dopamine determination
with CuO NPs synthesized from maca extract (MaE-CuONPs). MaE￾CuONPs synthesized simply by the green method were characterized by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX),
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. According to the characterization
results, while the surface area of MaE-CuO NPs is 344.645 m2
g21
, they
have a regular spherical shape with an average diameter range of
1020 nm, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 21.4. It has also been
found to have antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus brasi￾liensis (Ilgar et al., 2022).

Advances in green synthesis of nanostructured biosensors 555By developing a dual smartphone electrochemical and colorimetric
detection platform based on a three-electrode system with MaE￾CuONPs, nonenzymatic measurements were performed. With this devel￾oped green nanoplatform, dopamine was determined with a detection
limit of 16.9 nM in the linear concentration range of 0.6255 μM.
Various advantages of green synthesis nanostructures such as increasing the
sensitivity of the sensor by providing high surface area, synthesis from
plant extract without creating harmful waste for the environment, and
easy and fast synthesis have come to the fore. Ultimately, the combined
use of these multifunctional MaE-CuO NPs and smartphone technology
enabled rapid, selective determination of dopamine with high sensitivity
of 667 μA μM21
cm22 (Ilgar et al., 2022).
Although enzymes are widely used biorecognition elements due to
their high catalytic activity and substrate specificity, they have disadvan￾tages such as high cost for preparation and purification, low operating sta￾bility, the sensitivity of the catalytic activity to environmental conditions,
and difficulties in recycling and reuse. To overcome these limitations, as
an alternative to enzymes, novel molecules that can mimic the catalytic
properties of enzymes and the synthesis of complexes or nanoparticles
have attracted attention in recent years (Erkmen et al., 2021). In 2022,
novel green-synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) were

556 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationssynthesized by Youcef and coworkers, and this material was used for non￾enzymatic glucose determination. In this study, NiO NPs were synthe￾sized using seed extract of Nigella sativa. Briefly, after the surface of the
working electrode was mechanically cleaned, NiO NPs were dripped
onto the surface and dried and made used for measurement. While no
anodic or cathodic peaks were observed in the cyclic voltammograms
recorded using bare GCE, electrical signal was obtained on the NiO NPs￾modified surface. The glucose oxidation process was effectively catalyzed
by the electrically generated Ni(III) species on the modified electrode.
After determining the optimum conditions and the oxidation mechanism,
linearities in the range of 50600 μM and 110 mM with LOD of
3.2 μM were obtained according to the amperometric measurements. In
addition, glucose determination from serum samples was successfully per￾formed using the developed nonenzymatic sensor (Youcef et al., 2022).
As can be seen from the previous study mentioned above, more sensitive
results can be obtained using nanomaterials-based sensors that mimic
enzymes without using enzymes.
21.2.1.2 Green nanostructures in immunosensors
Immunosensors are biosensing platforms based on strong interactions and
affinity between antibody and antigen (Mollarasouli et al., 2019).
Antibodies, which can be classified as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM accord￾ing to the distinctive heavy chains of their immunoglobulins, are attached
to the electrochemical converter. A signal is generated by the detection
platform for the detection of target biomarkers. To date, important studies
have been carried out on the development of sensitive, fast, and selective
sensors for the rapid diagnosis of various diseases with antibody-based sen￾sors (Chen et al., 2021; Roda et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2017).
Immunosensor platforms created using various nanomaterials are fre￾quently encountered in the literature. With the rise of nanoplatforms syn￾thesizing green approaches, green nanomaterial-based immunosensors have
also begun to be developed in recent years. For example, Darvishi et al.
developed an immunosensor platform using both biopolymers obtained
from quince seed mucilage and AgNPs and AuNPs obtained from
Calendula officinalis L. extract. Quince seed gum has a special polymeric
structure due to the cellulose and polysaccharide components it contains
(Darvishi et al., 2021). Therefore this immunosensor platform has helped to
create platforms with high detection capability thanks to the
stable immobilization of nanomaterials and antibodies on the electrode
Advances in green synthesis of nanostructured biosensors 557surface and bioactive negatively charged components in surface modifica￾tion. Secondary metabolites of Calendula officinalis L. extract are used as a
reducing agent for metal ions. Due to the functional groups of this biopoly￾mer and synthesized green AgNPs and AuNPs, they detected prostate￾specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker of prostate cancer, with an unlabeled
immunosensor platform on the GCE surface (Darvishi et al., 2021).
CV and EIS techniques were used for the electrochemical characteri￾zation of the developed immunosensor platforms. In this study, Nyquist
plots are given in Fig. 21.5A, where quince seed berry-modified GCE
(mucilage/GCE) (b), green AuNPs- and AgNPs-modified mucilage/GCE
(c and d), both green AuNPs- and AgNPs-modified mucilage/GCE (f),
antibody incubated-modified electrode (g), and PSA-incubated modified
electrode (h) were given. The decrease in the diameter of the semicircle
electron transfer resistances (Rct) compared to bare GCE (a) demonstrates
a successful modification of biopolymer and green nanomaterials and
increased electrode conductivity, as well as increases in post-modification
Rct values, evidence of adequate and successful incubation of antibody
and PSA. As shown in Fig. 21.5B in studies with CV, in the presence of
Fe(CN)6
32/42 redox probe, AgNPs and AuNPs increased the surface area
of GCE, while mucilage increased the stability of the antibody thanks to
the covalent bonds between it and the antibody. In this way, it was possi￾ble to easily bind and detect PSA to the antibody-coated surface. As a
result, PSA determination was performed in the linear concentration
range of 0.1 pg mL21
100 ng mL21 with a low detection limit of
0.078 pg mL21 by the EIS method under optimum conditions. The
developed green immunosensor is biocompatible and environmentally
friendly, which can be used for the detection of PSA in clinical analysis
(Darvishi et al., 2021).
Sangili et al. using a green nanoplatform detected the deadly dengue virus
of type E-protein (DENV-E protein), the source of dengue fever. L-cysteine
(L-cys) was used as the green source in this green immunosensor platform
design. L-cys is a nontoxic, natural proteinogenic amino acid with sulfur,
amino, and carboxyl groups. In this way, it provides stable binding of biomo￾lecules such as antibodies when used in nanomaterial synthesis. Therefore
they prepared L-cys-based, environmentally friendly, and nontoxic AuNPs￾decorated heteroatom-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites
(AuNPs/NSG) for use in the immunosensor platform. The strong binding of
AuNPs/NSG nanocomposite with antibodies with strong amide bonds pro￾vides a significant advantage in terms of the stability of the developed
558 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsimmunosensor. Under optimum conditions, DENV-E determined a wide
linear working range of 0.01100 ng mL21
, with a low detection limit of
1.6 pg mL21 and high specificity. The sensor showed a wide linear operating

. In addition, the researchers used the immuno￾sensor platform they developed to detect viral E-protein contents in serum
samples collected from patients. It is envisaged that the AuNPs/NSG immu￾nosensor could be a green and reliable potential tool in clinical diagnostic
applications in the future (Sangili et al., 2022).
In another green nanostructured immunosensor study, Zhou et al.
synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (FeNPs) by green synthesis method
to detect anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP), a bio￾marker of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoimmune disease. FeNPs from
durian plant extract were used in an interdigitated electrode (IDE) modifi￾cation developed with aluminum and silicon dioxide (SiO2) as the base.
Green FeNPs were characterized by field emission scanning electron
microscopy and field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE￾SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. High immobiliza￾tion of cyclic citrulline peptide (CCP) and amine-aldehyde surface chem￾istry formed by aldehyde-amine linkers on the green FeNPs IDE surface
was achieved. The detection limits of the developed immunosensor and
anti-CCP in the linear range between 8 and 250 pg mL21 were found to
be 8 and 15 pg mL21
. Anti-CCP levels in biological fluid will be found
using this green immunosensor nanoplatform to diagnose RA (Zhou
et al., 2022).
21.2.1.3 Green nanostructures in aptasensors
Compared to other biological molecules, aptamers are highly stable over
wide temperature and pH (B49) ranges without losing their activity.
They can be produced easily and cheaply and also can be stored at room
temperature. Moreover, they can be synthesized in high quantity and
purity. Aptamers are important as very useful molecules for in vitro and
in vivo therapeutic, diagnostic, imaging, and analysis uses of many mole￾cules, such as drugs, proteins, and pesticides. This is because of their spe￾cial recognition properties of molecular targets (Erkmen et al., 2022). In
the design of electrochemical aptasensors, the development of biocompat￾ible, easily prepared, and low-cost label-free aptasensors has attracted the
attention of many researchers. In their study, Shahdost-fard and Roushani
developed a label-free aptasensor for the determination of β-casomor￾phin-7 (BCM-7) using a nanocomposite-modified electrode consisting of
quantum dots (QDs) and AgNPs. In the study, AgNPs were synthesized
using a very simple green method with less chemicals. As shown
in Fig. 21.6A, the bare GCE was modified with QD and AgNPs by
560 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationslayer-by-layer method, respectively. Then, the aptamers were immobi￾lized to the modified surface at the optimum incubation time. In the last
step, increasing concentrations of BCM-7 were immobilized to the sur￾face, and the aptasensor was made ready for measurement. At each modi￾fication step of the aptasensor, the electrochemical responses of rutin
(RU) as a redox probe were investigated by following CV (Fig. 21.6B)
and EIS (Fig. 21.6C). Compared to bare electrodes, the decrease in cur￾rent signals and increase in impedance values in modified electrodes with
QD, AgNPs, aptamer, and BCM-7, respectively, confirmed the character￾ization of the developed aptasensor. Under optimum conditions, linearity
was obtained in two different ranges of 1 pM20 nM and 20
nM1.3 μM with LOD of 32 fM against reductions in the current signals
of the RU using the DPV method. Moreover, the determination of
BCM-7 in urine and blood serum samples was successfully performed
using the label-free aptasensor (Shahdost-fard & Roushani, 2020).
In another study, Shahdost-Fard and coworkers prepared a spongin￾based nanocomposite and used this nanocomposite in the aptasensor
design developed for the detection of S. aureus. As shown in Fig. 21.7,

Advances in green synthesis of nanostructured biosensors 561first the sponge obtained from the sea sponge was modified with copper
tungsten oxide hydroxide. In the next step, sponge copper tungsten oxide
hydroxide was functionalized by AgNPs and used as a modification agent
for the design of the label-free electrochemical aptasensor. When the sur￾face of the bare working electrode was coated using the synthesized nano￾composite, both electron transfer was enhanced and the electroactive
surface area was increased. In addition, AgNPs in the nanocomposite pro￾vided more efficient immobilization of the thiol functional aptamer to the
surface. After examining the surface characterization of the electrodes, the
incubation time of S. aureus on the aptasensor was optimized. Under opti￾mal experimental conditions, a linear concentration range of 10108
colony-forming units per milliliter with a LOD of 1 colony-forming unit
Figure 21.7 The aptasensor fabrication procedure for Staphylococcus aureus detection.
562 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsper milliliter was obtained for S. aureus detection using the developed
label-free aptasensor. Furthermore, the determination of S. aureus in
human serum samples, which are real samples, was successfully applied
with acceptable recovery values (Shahdost-Fard et al., 2023).
The use of sandwich-based methods in sensor designs, unlike label￾free methods, significantly increases sensitivity and selectivity. In their
study, Tabrizi and coworkers designed a flow-injection electrochemical￾based aptasensor for the detection of adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cancer
cells when hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was present. The measurement
principle in this study was based on the preparation of a sandwich-based
aptasensor with amperometric measurements. To enhance the electroac￾tive surface area to immobilize primary thiolated aptamers and enhance
the electrode’s ability to transfer electrons, the bare surface of the SPE was
modified by multiwalled carbon nanotube decorated with gold nanoparti￾cles (MWCNT-Aunano). Afterward, the surface was incubated with pri￾mary aptamers and subsequently bovine serum albumin (BSA) to prevent
specific binding. In the next step, increasing concentrations of AGS cells
were immobilized on the surface. In the last step, labeled secondary apta￾mers synthesized using gold core and silver shell (Au@Ag) nanoparticles
(NPs) were immobilized to the surface. Thyme leaf extract was used as
green reducing agent for the synthesis of used AuNPs. Morphological
examination of synthesized nanoparticles and electrode surfaces was char￾acterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EDX meth￾ods, while all preparation steps of the apatsensor were characterized using
CV and EIS. The electrocatalytic activity of Au@Ag nanoparticles toward
the reduction of H2O2 caused the selective interactions between aptamers
and AGS cells to improve the response of aptasensor for the determination
of AGS cancer cells in the presence of H2O2. Under optimum conditions,
the developed sandwich-type amperometric aptasensor exhibited a linear
response to the logarithmic value of AGS cancer cells in the concentration
range of 1 3 101
5 3 105 cells mL21
, with a low LOD of 6 cells/mL21
.
Moreover, the developed aptasensor was used to determine AGS cancer
cells in a sample of human blood (Amouzadeh Tabrizi et al., 2017).
21.3 Conclusions and future perspectives
It has opened new doors in nanoscale material synthesis, drug delivery,
electronics, food, cosmetics, and sensors. The application of the green
chemistry approach to these areas is aimed to reduce resource and energy
Advances in green synthesis of nanostructured biosensors 563consumption, preventing environmental pollution, safe production for
human health, and economically low costs.
The rapid growth of the world market of nanomaterials causes a high
amount of waste and health safety problems. Therefore the use of
environmentally friendly and safe materials is an issue that needs urgent
attention. Nanoparticles of various shapes and sizes can be synthesized
using physical, chemical, or biological means. Utilizing physical and
chemical means leads to high energy consumption, low efficiency, high
cost, and environmental damage through the use of harsh reducing agents.
The biological green approach is carried out with the use of microorgan￾isms (bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae, etc.) or plants. The green synthesis
approach comes to the fore today with its advantages such as its contribu￾tion to recycling, not containing toxic chemicals, affordable costs, and
easy synthesis.
The increase in the use of nanoplatforms consisting of green-sourced
nanomaterials in biosensor applications in the last decade draws attention.
As a result of the studies, it is seen that green nanoplatforms can be used
to detect various disease biomarkers, biochemical substances, pathogens,
and enzymes. Green nanoplatforms bring advantages such as sensitivity,
low waste consumption, and low cost to electrochemical biosensors. The
size and morphological properties of nanoparticles used for the modifica￾tion of the sensor surface in electrochemical biosensors affect the sensor
efficiency. However, the shape and size controls of nanomaterials synthe￾sized from biological sources and the effect of the natural source used on
the synthesis mechanism are not clearly understood. Therefore there is a
need for further research and also large-scale production of these environ￾mentally friendly nanomaterials and synthesis methods. In addition, the
use of nontoxic solvents, low amount of samples, and energy consump￾tion, which are the subjects brought by the green chemistry perspective,
are among the topics researched in the field of electrochemical biosensors,
apart from these nanomaterials.
In this chapter, green electrochemical nanobiosensor applications
developed in recent years are mentioned. It is seen that the origin of
nanomaterials used in the developed biosensor platforms is mostly plant
origin rather than microbial origin. In addition, green nanoplatforms
continue to be developed in aptamer-based biosensors, known as new￾generation antibodies, with their frequent use in enzyme- and antibody￾based biosensors. While electrochemical biosensors serve sustainable world
goals such as low sample and waste production, their ability to be
564 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsdownsized with developed technologies, their integration into chip tech￾nology, and the establishment of platforms that can be formed from recy￾clable materials such as paper bring additional advantages in this regard.
Therefore green nanoplatforms, which combine green nanotechnological
approaches with developments in the field of electrochemical biosensors,
hold promise for a sustainable environment in the future.
As a result, new green nanomaterials have many applications for a sus￾tainable world. It is predicted that its applications in the field of biosensors
will continue to gain momentum. Therefore these environmentally
friendly, safe, and low-cost nanomaterials are produced in high quantities,
and their use in green nanotechnological developments and nanobiosensor
platforms is supported.

22.1 Biosensor
If the word “biosensor” is divided into “bio” and “sensor,” it will be eas￾ier to understand what they are. A biosensor is an analytical tool that
combines a biological element with a physicochemical detector to be uti￾lizd in the detection of chemical substances. Biological samples can be
sensed using biosensors, which are bioanalytical devices. They are com￾pact, effective tools that can examine biological materials to determine
their content, function, and structure. By transforming a biological signal
or response into a quantifiable response, this is accomplished. Leland C.
Clark created the first biosensor, also referred to as the “Clark electrode,”
in 1956 to measure oxygen levels. He was known as the “father of bio￾sensors” for his contributions to the field of biosensing. Yellow Springs
Instruments created the first biosensor for use in industry in 1975.
Biosensors include devices like pulse oximeters, smartwatches, and
glucometers. This technology is not only useful in the healthcare industry.
They can monitor the quality of the environment, soil, water, and food
and are essential for the development of new medications and the preven￾tion of disease. They are also employed in biodefense and metabolic engi￾neering to monitor the proper operation of prosthetic devices (Fig. 22.1).

All rights reserved.22.2 Types of biosensors
The biosensors can be categorized as invasive or noninvasive depending
on how the necessary biological analyte is applied.
1. The use of the transduction mechanism and the kind of biological rec￾ognition element. DNA, an antibody, an enzyme, a phage, tissues, cell
receptors, and microbial entire cells can all serve as the recognition
component of a biosensor (Manjunatha & Hussain, 2011).
2. There are three different types of transducers that can be utilized to
create biosensors: optical biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, and
mass-based biosensors.
a. Optical fibers are essential to the operation of optical biosensors
because they detect biological analytes based on their fluorescence,
absorption, and scattering of light characteristics. The measurements
are based on changes in the refractive index, and they are not electrical
in nature.
Figure 22.1 Various types of nanomaterials used in biosensor 1.0.
576 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsb. Electrochemical biosensors are electrical in nature and include interac￾tions between the sample analyte and the recognition component or
sensing molecule. The electrical signal generated is frequently inversely
correlated with the analyte concentration (Manjunatha et al., 2020;
Manjunatha, 2020b).
c. Electrical biosensors called mass-based biosensors provide electrical sig￾nals in direct proportion to the mechanical or acoustic (sound) vibra￾tions of the molecules that are being detected.
22.3 Nanowire-based biosensors
Biomedical sensors’ main function is to identify chemical and biological
species for use in everything from drug discovery to illness diagnosis.
These fundamental biomedical activities are easily accomplished using
nanomaterials (e.g., nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and nanoparticles) with
different optical, magnetic, and electrical properties (Kurkina &
Balasubramanian, 2012). The most suitable alternative for biomedical sen￾sors that have high sensitivity, homogeneity, reproducibility, and scalabil￾ity with a reasonably easy fabrication technique is hence nanostructures
made by nanowires (Hareesha et al., 2021; Zhang & Ning, 2012).

Nanowire sensors can be used to find certain DNA and RNA sequences
(Zhang et al., 2008). PNA single-stranded sequences are arranged on the
surfaces of silicon nanowires so that they can serve as DNA receptors (Wu
et al., 2009). Nanowires can be used to detect the bonding between pro￾teins and DNA in addition to the identification of individual DNA strands
(Yang & Zhang, 2014). Similar to PNA or DNA, nanowire devices can
be functionalized to create RNA sensors. The application of nanowire￾based DNA sensors for cancer diagnosis and treatment is made possible by
their ability to monitor different cancer indicators at the DNA level,
including telomerase and carcinoembryonic antigen (Lu et al., 2014;
Zheng et al., 2005).
22.5 Receptor for viruses
Many harmful viruses, including dengue, influenza A H3N2 (Zhang
et al., 2010), H1N1 (Kao et al., 2011), and HIV (Inci et al., 2013), have
Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical biosensors 577been detected using Si nanowire sensors. Antibodies that precisely bind to
the target viruses are functionalized onto the nanowire sensor surface,
which alters the conductivity of the nanowire (Tigari & Manjunatha,
2020). For instance, an EBC sample containing up to 29 flu viruses/L and
an Ebola VP40 matrix protein could both be detected by a Si nanowire￾based biosensor (Ibarlucea et al., 2018).
22.6 Nanorod-based biosensors
TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO are common semiconductor materials used in bio￾sensor construction (Kong et al., 2009). When it comes to sensitivity and
the lower limit of GOx, TiO2-based biosensors have excelled. TiO2 has
a poorer charge mobility than SnO2 and ZnO, for this reason. Due to
ZnO nanostructure’s favorable isoelectric point, it produces remarkable
results in glucose biosensors (IEP). Nanorods, among other ZnO nanos￾tructures including nanowires, spheres, belts, rings, and nanoneedles, are
of particular study interest because they have promising electrical charac￾teristics for biosensors (Lu et al., 2008).
A composite semiconductor-based biosensor significantly boosts the
device’s effectiveness. Recently, biosensors based on carbon-decorated
ZnO (C-ZnO) nanostructures have increased efficiency with lower glu￾cose detection thresholds. For immobilization, the C-ZnO nanowires
directly interact with GOx (Ahmad et al., 2010). The hexagonal face of
ZnO nanowires, which is more sensitive to GOx because of the higher
IEP of ZnO nanowires, is where enzymes or GOx interact. Furthermore,
for the immobilization of GOx, hybrid platinum-fullerene-like ZnO
nanospheres (50200 nm) are placed on glassy carbon electrodes to form
highly sensitive GOx biosensors. This biosensor has better sensitivity and
higher stability (Lu et al., 2008). For the application of DNA immobiliza￾tion, composite sensors made of carbon nanotube and zinc oxide have
been developed. The electrical response of carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
whose electrical conductivity is substantially greater, is crucial to the sensi￾tivity of the biosensors (Tigari & Manjunatha, 2020).
The lower limit of GOx and other enzymes for immobilization is
reduced as a result of this increase in biosensor sensitivity (Wang et al.,
2010). The researcher’s attention has also been piqued by ZnO nanorod￾based biosensors with high surface-to-volume ratios and simple growth
processes (Lu et al., 2008). The most straightforward and affordable way
of manufacturing is hydrothermal ZnO growth, which significantly
578 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsreduces the cost of fabrication when done in batches. The biosensors
made of comb-shaped ZnO nanorods were produced in a batch using tra￾ditional photolithography (Lu et al., 2010) (Fig. 22.2).
22.7 Carbon nanotubebased biosensors
The field of electrochemical biosensing has made substantial use of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) (Najma et al., 2018). CNTs are made up of one or
more layers of carbon-based needle-like cylindrical hollow structures with
high aspect ratios (Rivas et al., 2007). MWCNTs are multiple rolled
assemblies of SWCNT, whereas SWCNTs are nanometer diameter
wrapped sheets of sp2-bound graphene (Iijima, 1991; Odom et al., 1998).
Due to their active involvement in speeding electron transfer, CNTs have
the potential to be used in the field of electrochemical detection of bio￾molecules (Wang, 2005). Highly sensitive and appropriate for detecting
nucleobases are CNT-modified electrodes (Wang et al., 2006). A large
number of nucleobases may be adsorbed on the CNT-modified GCE sur￾face in comparison to the naked GCE surface, and this appears to improve
the oxidation signals (Wu et al., 2003). Additionally, this is a low-cost and
Figure 22.2 Constructing ZnO nanorod array photoelectrodes for highly efficient
quantum dots sensitized solar cells clicking.
Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical biosensors 579effective technique for detecting oxidative DNA damage. The exceptional
oxidation signal sensitivity of CNT serves as a catalyst for the electro￾chemical detection of Gua and 8-hydroxyGua (Goyal et al., 2011).
22.8 Carbon nanotubemodified electrodes
Utilizing CNTs, biosensors with new modified electrode architectures
were created for the measurement of glucose. They increase the electro￾des’ electroactive surface area, which improves charge transfer and con￾ductivity. They can thereby facilitate charge transfer between
biomolecules and electrode surfaces and catalyze biological reactions
(Barsan et al., 2015). Polybenzimidazole and carboxylated MWCNTs
were utilized to create a three-dimensional composite, which was then
used to modify a gold electrode for hydrogen peroxide detection (Hua
et al., 2011). With the aid of microwave energy, graphene oxide nanorib￾bons were created, and a glassy carbon electrode modified with
MWCNTs and GONR was created to detect ascorbic acid, dopamine,
and uric acid (Sun et al., 2011). When compared to either CNTs or poly￾mer materials alone, composites made of CNTs and conducting polymers
are mechanically stronger, more conductive, and less prone to heat deteri￾oration (Ghica & Brett, 2010). Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
and polyazine redox polymers, such as poly(neutral red) or poly(brilliant
cresyl blue), have been combined in various ways to create biosensors on
glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) (Yogeswaran & Chen, 2008).
22.8.1 Quantum dot-based biosensors
Nanomaterials with zero dimensions are called quantum dots. They are
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs), both
of which have been utilized in bioimaging and biosensing. They have spe￾cial electrochemiluminescent, fluorescent, photoluminescent, chemilumi￾nescent, and electronic features (Li et al., 2019). An efficient platform for
screening, monitoring, early diagnosis, and disease surveillance is provided
by the quantitative detection of cancer biomarkers with greater accuracy
and sensitivity (Lu et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2012). The fluorescent turn￾on biosensor, which uses biofunctionalized graphene quantum dots as the
energy donor and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the energy acceptor, was
used for the ultrasensitive detection of small cell lung cancer (Manjunatha
Charithra & Manjunatha, 2020; Manjunatha, 2020a).
580 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing ApplicationsFor the purpose of detecting neuron-specific enolase, a label-free and
effective fluorescent biosensor based on nanosurface energy transfer
between anti-NSE/amine-N-GNOs and AuNPs has been created.
Fluorescence response experiments of anti-NSE/amine-N-GNOs at
AuNPs nanoprobe performed in response to NSE antigen showed quick
response, a broad linear detection range, and astonishingly low detection
limit. Additionally, the fluorescent biosensor performed superbly with real
samples (Kalkal et al., 2020).
22.8.2 Dendrimers-based biosensors
Due to their three-dimensional structure and internal void space, dendri￾mers, which are ideal for monodisperse macromolecules with highly
branching and regular architectures, are regarded as acceptable host mole￾cules for accommodating guest molecules (Bosman et al., 1999).
Dendrimers are ideal matrices for biomolecule immobilization because of
their promising properties, which include high chemical and mechanical
strength, adjustable size, globular geometry, hydrophilicity, high surface
functionality, homogeneity, and biocompatibility (Hasanzadeh et al.,
2014). These characteristics help biosensors to be more stable, sensitive,
capable of collecting targets, and selective. Since PAMAM contains a lot
of terminal amino groups that facilitate the attachment of biomolecules, it
can be employed in biosensor applications in particular, as highly
branched dendritic macromolecules (PAMAM) (Demirci et al., 2012).
Dendrimers’ use in biosensors is nonetheless restricted by their low con￾ductivity and greasy nature. Dendrimers can be fixed on a solid-state car￾rier, such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or nanoparticles,
to function efficiently and get around these issues (Kavosi et al., 2014).
MWCNT-PAMAM dendrimer-modified glassy carbon electrode and
methylene blue redox indicator make up an electrochemical microRNA
biosensor. Here, PAMAM dendrimers are chosen because of their suitabil￾ity for immobilizing the capture probe due to their highly branched poly￾meric structure and MWCNTs because of their outstanding
electrochemical performance for methylene blue electrochemistry
(Li et al., 2015). The polypyrrole film was wrapped around MWCNTs
during the electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole on a gold electrode,
resulting in the MWCNTspolypyrrole nanocomposite. Due to the high
number of amine groups on the dendrimer surface, which led to
improved sensitivity and a lower detection limit, this nanocomposite layer
Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical biosensors 581was modified with PAMAM dendrimers in order to offer association with
a broad number of bioreceptors (Pushpanjali & Manjunatha, 2020;
Pushpanjali, Manjunatha, & Srinivas, 2020).
22.9 Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical
biosensor
22.9.1 Gold nanoparticles
It is possible to dissolve captured gold nanoparticles with or without
preenlargement to produce gold(III) ions for electrochemical measure￾ment. Dequaire et al. measured the released gold(III) ions using anodic
stripping voltammetry on screen-printed carbon electrodes after dissolving
the trapped gold nanoparticles in a solution of hydrobromic acid (1 M)
and bromine (0.1 mM). Goat immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection had a
dynamic range of 0.5100 nanograms per milliliter (ng mL21
), with a
detection limit of 0.5 ng mL21 (Dequaire et al., 2000).
Liao and Huang autocatalytically deposited gold on gold nanoparticles
using formaldehyde/Au31. The extra Au31 was removed, and the
expanded gold nanoparticles were then dissolved using a solution of bro￾mine and hydrobromic acid. Then, using square-wave stripping voltam￾metry, the amount of gold placed on the electrode was determined. With
a detection limit of 0.25 picograms per milliliter (pg mL21
), this resulted
in a linear dynamic range (semilog plot) of 1500 pg mL 2 1 of rabbit
IgG (Liao & Huang, 2005).
22.9.2 Gold nanoparticles with silver deposition
A sandwich immunoassay based on silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles
was described by Chu et al. in 2005. To precipitate silver on the gold
labels, the immunocomplexes were treated with hydroquinone and silver
nitrate. Nitric acid was then used to dissolve the silver that had been
deposited, and anodic stripping voltammetry was used to identify the
metal ions. According to estimates, the detection threshold for human
IgG is 1.0 ng mL21 (6 pM) (Chu et al., 2005). To create electrochemical
signals proportional to human and mouse IgG on dual working electrodes
using anodic stripping voltammetry, Lai et al. employed gold nanoparticles
functionalized with an antibody and labeled with alkaline phosphatase
(Hareesha et al., 2021; Prinith et al., 2021).
For human and mouse IgG, respectively, detection limits of 4.8 and
6.1 pg mL21 were obtained when enzyme and gold nanoparticles worked
582 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationstogether to catalyze silver deposition (Lai et al., 2011). Shim et al. likewise
employed silver deposition and stripping to produce an analytical signal,
but in this instance, sandwich immunocomplexes were functionalized
with a cysteaminesilver complex by interacting the free amine group of
cysteamine with gold nanoparticles on the detecting antibodies (Noh
et al., 2011). The limit of detection was reported to be 0.4 femtograms
per milliliter (fg mL21
), and the amount of cysteamine attached was pro￾portionate to the amount of IgG present. In a similar manner to Lin
et al., detection antibodies were assembled on gold nanoparticles con￾nected to poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) microbeads, whereas capture anti￾bodies were assembled on a graphene-coated glassy carbon electrode.
With a limit of detection of 0.12 pg mL21
, silver stripping using linear
sweep voltammetry responded linearly to the logarithm of CEA concen￾tration in the range of 0.5 pg mL21
0.5 ng mL21 (Lin et al., 2012)
(Figs. 22.3 and 22.4).
The schematic for an immunoassay uses magnetic beads and silver
nanoparticles starting at the top left: in the first step, an antigen is exposed
to magnetic beads conjugated to an antibody to create antibodyantigen
complexes linked to the magnetic beads; in the second step, silver nano￾particles conjugated to a second antibody are added to the reaction mix￾ture to create conjugates containing the antigen linked to both the
magnetic beads and the silver nanoparticles; in the third step, a magnet is
used to capture the magnetic beads while unbound materials (including
unbound silver nanoparticles) are washed. Moreover, ammonium thiocya￾nate is added to the trapped conjugates in the fourth stage to disintegrate
them and stabilize silver. The silver nanoparticles are finally determined
by (1) electrochemical dissolution to produce silver ions, (2) silver nucle￾ation on the electrode surface, (3) silver accumulation on the electrode

beads.

measurably large stripping charge.
22.9.3 Silver nanoparticles
Similar to gold nanoparticles but with less aggressive reaction conditions,
captured silver nanoparticles can be employed to provide an electrochemi￾cal signal with or without preenlargement. To test myoglobin using
ammonium thiocyanate to dissolve the trapped silver nanoparticles using
stripping voltammetry to provide a dynamic range spanning 0.220 ng
mL21
, Szymanski et al. combined magnetic beads and silver nanoparticles
that were each tagged with antibodies (Szymanski et al., 2010; Szymanski
et al., 2011). An immunoassay without the need for silver nanoparticle
dissolution before measurement was published by Hao et al. (2011).
Glutathione was used to activate the silver nanoparticles, and glutaralde￾hyde was used to conjugate them to goat antihuman IgG. Preadsorption
of IgG to screen-printed carbon working electrodes was done, and the
functionalized particles were treated with the IgG. Unbound materials
were removed by washing, and differential pulse voltammetry was used to
strip the remaining silver metal-labeled immunocomplexes. The limit of
detection was 0.4 ng mL21
, and the dynamic range was 11000 ng mL21
.

584 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applications22.9.4 Graphene nanomaterials used in electrochemical
biosensor fabrication
For the construction of electrode matrices for sensing and biosensing, gra￾phene and its derivative structures (graphene oxide, graphene platelets,
and graphene nanoflakes) have gained popularity (Ambrosi et al., 2010).
All graphitic forms, such as three-dimensional graphite, one-dimensional
carbon nanotubes, and zero-dimensional fullerenes, are descended from
graphene (Rao et al., 2009). Undoubtedly, the material that is being
examined the most in-depth at the moment is graphene, which is
described as a single-layer, two-dimensional, sp2
-hybridized carbon.
The world’s thinnest, stiffest, and strongest material is a single carbon
atom thick sheet that is arranged in a honeycomb pattern. It also conducts
heat and electricity very well (Georgakilas et al., 2012). It is sometimes
divided into three categories according to how many layers are stacked:
single layer, few layer (210 layers), and multilayer, also known as thin
graphite. The use of graphene should ideally be restricted to single- or
few-layer geometries to preserve its unique features (Raril & Manjunatha,
2020; Raril, Manjunatha, Ravishankar, et al., 2020). Due to its distinct
electrical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties,
graphene is receiving a lot of attention as a next-generation electronic
material. Graphene can be used to achieve molecular sensing since it has
excellent low-noise electrical properties (Artiles et al., 2011).
A wide electrochemical potential window, low electrical resistance in
comparison to glassy carbon (GC), atomic thickness, and two well￾defined redox peaks linearly aligned with the square root of the scan rate
magnitude make graphene appealing for electrochemistry. This suggests
that the material’s redox processes are primarily diffusion-controlled. Its
apparent electron transfer rate is orders of magnitude higher than that of
GC, and peak-to-peak values under cyclic voltammetry are low, implying
rapid electron transfer kinetics. The formation of particular surface func￾tional groups has been demonstrated to greatly increase this rate of elec￾tron transfer, which is surface-dependent. Numerous electrochemically
active sites are provided by the graphene’s high density of edge-plane
defect sites. Due to its 2D form, which exposes its full volume to the
environment, it is particularly effective in detecting molecules that have
been adsorbed. The increased surface area of graphene-based electrodes
results in significant enzyme loading as well. This can therefore help with
high sensitivity, some enzymes’ outstanding ability to promote electron
Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical biosensors 585transfer, and many macromolecules’ excellent catalytic behavior (Bao
et al., 2012). In addition to having the necessary biocompatibility,
graphene-based devices are suitable for in situ biosensing.
Similar to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene has a large surface area
(2,630 m2
g21
) and a small unit size. It also has some additional advan￾tages, such as low cost, two external surfaces, ease of fabrication and mod￾ification, and the absence of metallic impurities, which can produce
unintended and uncontrolled electrocatalytic effects as well as toxicologi￾cal risks. Additionally, it has been noted that graphene sheets’ edges
include a range of oxygenated species that can facilitate effective electrical
wiring of numerous metalloproteins with heme-containing redox centers
to the electrode and also improve molecule adsorption and desorption
(Bao et al., 2012).
Graphene-based nanomaterials can be categorized based on how they
were made. They can be made through mechanical exfoliation of graph￾ite, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) development, or exfoliation of
graphite oxide. Neither graphene created by CVD nor graphene exfoli￾ated mechanically has significant amounts of flaws or functions. For exam￾ple, sono-assisted exfoliation of graphite oxide to graphene oxide (GO),
which can then be further reduced chemically or electrochemically, and
thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide to produce a material known as
thermally reduced graphene (GO) are typical methods used to prepare
bulk quantities of graphene-based nanomaterials. Chemically reduced GO
(CRGO) or electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) are common names
for the end products. The TRGO is drastically different from pure gra￾phene, which has a flawless honeycomb lattice structure and has a lot of
flaws. Due to severe damage to the sp2 carbon network, the GO’s struc￾ture is not entirely planar. It has a lot of oxygen-containing groups, which
can help with functionalization when biomolecules are used to trigger
biorecognition events during biosensing.
Reduced versions of GO still contain some fraction of oxygen￾containing groups despite having a partially recovered sp2 lattice. To select
the appropriate type of graphene for the application and transduction pro￾cess, one may need a big graphene “toolbox”. The majority of graphene
used in electrochemistry is graphene made from GO chemical/thermal
reduction, also known as functionalized graphene sheets or chemically
reduced GO. This type of graphene typically has a large number of struc￾tural flaws and functional groups, which is advantageous for electrochemi￾cal applications. It has been shown that ERGO performs significantly
586 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsbetter for electrochemical applications than CRGO. Furthermore, Chua
and Pumera (2013) research showed that not all graphene materials are
useful for lab-on-chip device detection. Their research may offer impor￾tant new information on the potential practical applications of graphene
materials in the future. Future development of electrochemical graphene￾based nanobiodevices should be based on a better understanding of some
electrochemical details, such as the function of defects and oxygen￾containing groups at graphene sheets’ edges, the mechanism by which
biomolecules interact with graphene surfaces, and the function of doping
heteroatoms in graphene. It is also vital to note that inventive techniques
for carefully monitored graphene manufacturing and processing should be
created. Although graphene has been created using a variety of techni￾ques, the cost-effective, high-yield production method is still not publicly
accessible.
22.9.5 ZnO nanostructures used in the fabrication of
electrochemical biosensors
As immobilizing matrices for the creation of better electrochemical bio￾sensors, nanostructured metal oxides (NMOs) based on metals like zinc,
iron, cerium, tin, zirconium, copper, titanium, and nickel have recently
attracted a lot of interest. They have been discovered to have intriguing
nanomorphological, functional, biocompatible, nontoxic, and catalytic
properties. As a result, they offer an efficient surface for immobilizing bio￾molecules with the desired orientation, better conformation, and high
biological activity, which improves biosensing characteristics. The NMOs
with the requisite capabilities and surface charge characteristics offer
intriguing platforms for integrating transducers for signal amplification
with biorecognition components. Additionally, these materials have better
electron transfer kinetics and robust adsorption properties, which create
favorable microenvironments for the sustained immobilization of biomo￾lecules and boost biosensing capabilities.
Selecting an NMO that is appropriate for the immobilization of the
intended biomolecule is essential for the fabrication of an effective biosen￾sor. It is well known that the interface created as a result of the binding of
an NMO and a biomolecule has a major impact on the performance of
the biosensor. The nature of the NMO determines the formation and
characteristics of a nanobiointerface; factors influencing the formation of a
biointerface include effective surface area, surface charge, energy, rough￾ness and porosity, valence/conductance states, functional groups, physical
Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical biosensors 587states, and hygroscopic nature (Solanki et al., 2011). Among NMOs,
ZnO nanostructures have distinct physical and chemical advantages. These
include a high surface-to-volume ratio that allows for greater enzyme
loading, a favorable microenvironment that can maintain the activity of
the immobilized biomolecules, nontoxicity, chemical stability with a high
isoelectric point (9.5), electrochemical activity, high electron communica￾tion features, and high ionic b. In fact, enzymes with insulated redox cen￾ters can benefit from direct electrochemistry because of ZnO
nanostructures’ excellent electron transfer rate, which can bring forth the
biomolecules’ hidden electrochemical capabilities. With improved confor￾mation, strong biological activity, and binding of biomolecules in the
appropriate orientation they have demonstrated, the features of sensing
have improved (Zhao et al., 2010).
They also make good candidates for tiny integrated biosensor devices
due to their interoperability with complementary metal oxide semicon￾ductor technology for building integrated circuits. They are among the
most promising materials for intracellular electrochemical measurements
and biosensing applications because of all these beneficial features. These
nanostructures can be designed to have a diameter that is equivalent to
the size of the chemical and biological species being sensed, which makes
them good primary transducers for generating electrical signals. It is inter￾esting to note that ZnO may be grown to form highly anisotropic nanos￾tructures on a variety of substrates, such as sapphire, glass, silicon, and
conductive surfaces with diverse morphologies (such as indium-tin-oxide
[ITO] and gold). Additionally, the many options for fabricating ZnO and
their various growth settings have produced a pretty diverse array of
nanostructures in the ZnO nanoworld. The production of nanostructured
materials using ZnO’s polymorphism properties presents a significant
opportunity for fundamental research into the functions of dimensionality
and size-based physical features. ZnO-based matrices are a viable founda￾tion for low-cost biosensors due to their simplicity in synthesis employing
inexpensive techniques that can produce a variety of nanostructures
(Yakimova et al., 2012).
A wide variety of ZnO nanostructures have been reported by
researchers for use in biosensor applications, including nanowires
(ZnONWs), nanorods (ZnONRs), nanowalls, nanobelts, nanonails, nano￾needles, nanotubes (ZnONTs), nanocombs, nanoforks, nanofibers
(ZnONFs), nanoflakes, nano-waxberries, nanobundles, and nanospheres
(ZnONSs). ZnO films that are nanoporous and nanostructured have also
588 Novel Nanostructured Materials for Electrochemical Bio-sensing Applicationsbeen applied to biosensor applications. After an enzyme is immobilized,
these nanostructures lead to the creation of various structures with a vari￾ety of characteristics, which may further affect the microenvironments.
For instance, compared to ZnONW arrays, tiny dimensional ZnONT
arrays offer a greater effective surface area, subsurface oxygen vacancies,
and a higher surface-to-volume ratio, enabling sensors with higher sensi￾tivity (Ali et al., 2011). A prickly ZnO/Cu nanocomposite’s nanostructure
offers significant advantages over ZnONRs in terms of facilitating direct
electron transfer, according to comparative studies that also show that
nanosheet-based ZnO microspheres are more effective than solid ZnO
microspheres at facilitating the electron transfer of immobilized enzymes.
22.10 Conclusion and future prospects
In this review article, we have covered several biosensor designs and
working principles based on transducers, such as electrochemical, electri￾cal, optical, gravimetric, and acoustic sensors, as well as receptors like
enzymes, antibodies, entire cells, and aptamers (gold nanoparticles, Ag
nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and
dendrimers). In the disciplines of engineering and technology, medicine
and biomedicine, toxicology and ecotoxicology, food safety monitoring,
medication delivery, and disease progression, biosensors have a wide range
of applications. The use of nanomaterials in biosensors has caused the field
of biosensing technology to advance quickly in the last 10 years. This is
due to the use of new biorecognition components and transducers,
advancements in the design, manufacture, and miniaturization of nanos￾tructured devices at the micron scale, and novel methods for the synthesis
of nanomaterials, all of which unite the fields of engineering, technology,
and life sciences. The use of nanoparticles has increased the sensing tech￾nology’s adaptability, durability, and dynamic nature. The use of various
nanomaterials, each of which has unique properties within biosensors
(such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, carbon nanotubes, quantum
dots, and dendrimers), has significantly improved the transduction mecha￾nism (like greater sensitivity, faster detection, shorter response time, and
reproducibility). Although the usage of nanostructured materials in bio￾sensor applications has significantly improved, there are still a few restric￾tions that prevent these applications from progressing to the next level.
For instance, the use of CNT-based gas sensors in CNT-based systems
is limited by the lack of selectivity. However, by joining CNTs with
Nanostructured materialbased electrochemical biosensors 589other substances, this difficulty can be solved. These sensors also have pro￾blems with the production of nanostructures, the sustainability of nanos￾tructures in sensor applications, and the toxicity, which varies depending
on the physical characteristics of the material type. While developing new
nanostructured materials for use in biosensors, these problems should be
looked at and addressed. The majority of nanobiosensors used in biomedi￾cal applications need a big sample to be detected, which could result in
false-positive or false-negative results. Apart from electrochemical glucose
sensors and lateral flow pregnancy tests, very few biosensors have achieved
commercial success on a global scale. Additionally, there is a need for
user-friendly, economical nanostructure-based biosensors that provide
findings quickly and accurately (Wildöer et al., 1998). For multiplexed
clinical diagnostics, nanomaterials should be coupled with a micro-biochip
(lab-on-chip) for sample handling and processing. More study is needed
in this area, and we anticipate that companies will soon translate the cur￾rent academic research into prototypes that are practical from a commer￾cial standpoint.
Electrochemical biosensors can be built using platforms based on gra￾phene and ZnO nanostructures as immobilization matrices for the detec￾tion of physiologically significant analytes. These novel bioplatforms open
up new possibilities for novel functions with a range of crucial medical
diagnostic applications. They enable the development of numerous new
signal transduction technologies in biosensors due to the submicrometer
dimensions that can be used for quick and easy in vivo analysis. These
electrochemical miniaturized sensors’ exceptional performance paves the
way for the execution of biologically significant measurements inside liv￾ing cells. Some of these biosensors have also proven to perform excep￾tionally well in FIA tests. By utilizing such platforms, it will be possible to
create point-of-care systems for clinical analysis and commercially viable
electrochemical biosensors.
