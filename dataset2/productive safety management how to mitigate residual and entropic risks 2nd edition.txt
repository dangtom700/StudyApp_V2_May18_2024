Productive Safety Management
This book discusses the realm of operational risk management, exploring the 
 intricacies of managing safety, production and quality simultaneously. It offers a 
fresh perspective on the dynamic and complex nature of risk, highlighting the 
ever‑changing landscape that organisations must navigate. The reliance on current 
understandings of residual risk is deficient, particularly as systems of production are 
prone to degradation over time. This degradation leads to an increase in ‘entropic 
risk’, resulting in losses in daily production that, if left unchecked, could culminate 
in catastrophic consequences.
Productive Safety Management, second edition utilises practical experience to 
offer context and application to the concepts surrounding risk that are introduced. It 
explores the residual and entropic risks present in production systems before shifting 
focus to the same risks within organisational elements such as leadership, competen‑
cies, management systems and resilience. The degradation of these factors can lead 
to a toxic enterprise culture. Traditional risk management methods have resulted in 
the creation of functional silos. This book advocates for a multidisciplinary approach, 
positioning it as essential reading for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this era, the 
ability to effectively manage risks and capitalise on opportunities will be crucial for 
operational success.
This comprehensive title is designed for operational managers and supervi‑
sors, and risk‑related professionals in engineering, OSH, environment and quality 
management.
Tania Van der Stap spent the last 20 years since writing the first edition of Productive 
Safety Management in managerial and technical positions responsible for safety, 
health and environmental management. Having experience in staff and contractor 
roles means she understands how to achieve results, whether within the organisation, 
owners’ team, project team or as an external technical expert. The industries and 
organisations she’s worked in have been diverse – gas, mining, exploration, construc‑
tion, rail transport, engineering, agribusiness, professional organisations and regu‑
latory authorities. She has in‑depth knowledge of different strategies according to 
each organisation’s level of maturity, leadership capability, resource availability and 
most importantly, the operational reality of the enterprise. Tania’s qualifications are 
in commerce, which has throughout her career resulted in a business lens on opera‑
tional performance. She is an unequivocal advocate of a risk‑ and opportunity‑based 
approach to HSE, production and quality.Productive Safety

by codeMantraI’d like to dedicate this edition to the people in industry 
operations whom I’ve worked with in the last 20+ years since 
writing the first edition of Productive Safety Management.
Both support and criticism have motivated my professional 
journey. I’m particularly grateful to those who trusted me 
by sharing their successes, challenges and frustrations 
with managing safety and operational risks. This edition 
is a culmination of what I’ve learned about achieving a 
safe, productive, quality job in numerous industries.
My hope is that readers will make a transformation from 
‘silo‑ based thinking’ to ‘risk‑based thinking’ 
at work and as a life skill.vii

Foreword
As an engineer in the occupational safety and health profession for several multina‑
tional energy businesses and later business owner employing people in the manu‑
facturing of ultrasonic equipment and in agriculture operations, my 40 plus years of 
education, professional development and experiences impressed upon me the awe‑
some accountability for managing risk safely as a pre‑requisite to achieving produc‑
tion output goals and quality work. The ever‑present business decision and execution 
requirements demanded an awareness and balance for all stakeholders’ perspec‑
tives, their motivations towards risk acceptance and rewards. So it is my privilege 
to introduce this second edition of Productive Safety Management: How to Mitigate 
Residual and Entropic Risks as a must read.
This book represents the author’s decades of cumulative education and work expe‑
riences, focusing on practical application as needed by business owners and opera‑
tional leaders as opposed to purely academic theory and teachings, gleaned from 
her perspective working with a myriad of business owners, operations managers and 
risk‑related professionals. She takes further steps forward from the first edition of 
Productive Safety Management. In this second edition, one can find a voice that’s 
operational, not academic, and much more than a slogan, ‘Safety First’. The author 
seeks a transformation from ‘safety‑ based thinking’ to ‘risk‑based thinking’ at work 
and as a life skill for owners, engineers, front‑line supervisors, employees, contrac‑
tors and others having a stake in the enterprise, in their communities in which they 
work and for their families.
The book and its contents are organised and succinctly presented in a manner 
well‑suited to those that can make a difference in terms of risk and reward while 
cognisant of the legislative and bureaucratic regimes that can be viewed as barriers in 
businesses today. Contained in the chapters, one can sense the call to action for reas‑
sessment of commonly accepted views of risk assessment and mitigation and how 
processes, technology, the physical work environment and people all come together 
and sometimes collide in their intents, to sustain a successful operation. Here in this 
second edition are presentations on topics with discussions, challenges and poten‑
tially, revelations.
The author brings forward for consideration of the Entropy Model and offers 
strategies for management. Not to be overlooked is a spot‑on need to understand 
the impact of organisational maturity and the will and ability to mitigate risk. In 
other chapters, the discussions turn to processes and technologies, both never static, 
but always in a dynamic state of change, and thus presenting ever‑shifting probabil‑
ity and frequency of risk and acceptance. Coupled with the physical environment 
impacting operations, we see risks, sometimes called ‘Acts of God’, that can be more 
challenging and can enable excuses by owners and leaders for failure to act on risk.
The author provides a view to risk quantification and management strategies dis‑
pelling assumptions, providing case studies and offering residual risk management 
(RRMS) and entropic risk prevention strategies (ERPS). Even the most successful 
businesses are subject to continual and accompanying risk in the ever‑changing xvi Foreword
dynamics of leadership and organisation capacity for risk decision management. As 
businesses plan for and sustain a high‑reliability organisation (HRO), existing and 
new risks continually “creep” into systems, processes, equipment, the work environ‑
ment and people, the development and implementation of a fit‑for‑purpose business 
model addressing residual and entropic risks become ever more urgent.
The early chapters focus on the residual and entropic risks associated with systems 
of production, whilst the latter chapters propose that organisational factors such as 
leadership, competencies, management systems and resilience also carry these risks. 
Collectively, these determine an organisation’s capacity to manage risks and exploit 
opportunities. Of great concern is the tendency towards cultural degradation which 
has been the case prior to many catastrophes. The book covers more than disaster 
prevention and talks pragmatically about operational failures. On a day‑to‑day basis, 
operations can experience losses such as safety incidents, production downtime and 
quality deficiencies, because of poorly managed risks, so the book provides strategies 
for timely intervention and business improvement.
The author is to be commended for writing this second edition. This book is more 
than theory and management; rather, it is a practical instruction to assess actions 
in recognition of ever‑changing risks in business and operations. This is a book for 
anyone genuinely interested in the protection of our greatest asset, human life, whilst 
concurrently achieving production output and quality work. For the above‑stated 
aspiration and intent, this book is a must read and application.

About the Author
Tania Van der Stap has spent the last 20 plus years since writing the first edition of 
Productive Safety Management in various management and technical roles covering 
the disciplines of occupational safety and health (OSH) and environmental manage‑
ment. Her positions have included both staff and contractor engagement models, giv‑
ing her an insight into being part of the organisation, owners’ team, project team and 
external technical expert.
Likewise, the industries she’s worked in have been diverse, including oil and gas, 
mining, exploration, project development, construction, rail transport, engineering, 
agribusiness, professional organisations and regulators. This exposure has resulted 
in a deep understanding of the need for different strategies according to each organ‑
isation’s level of maturity on the risk management journey, leadership capability, 
resource availability and, most importantly, the operational reality of the enterprise.
In 2023, Tania was engaged by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health 
(IOSH, UK) to write textbooks for their degree‑level course in OSH Leadership 
and Management. This work, like this edition of Productive Safety Management, 
is a culmination of extensive experience as well as contributions to thought leader‑
ship since the first edition. Tania has written several journal articles as referenced 
throughout and “Chapter 29: Risk Leadership: A Multidisciplinary Approach” for the 
American Society of Safety Professionals book Safety Leadership and Professional 
Development.
Tania started her consulting business, Align Risk Management based in Western 
Australia, in 2003, following the global publication of the first edition. She wrote the 
book considering several fatalities in the mining industry in the 1990s and concerns 
about the impact of production pressure on workers’ safety. These concerns remain, 
balanced with contemporary challenges of the over‑bureaucratisation of OSH and 
operational risk management systems. Tania has extensive practical experience in the 
development of right‑sized, risk‑based OSH and operational management systems, in 
collaboration with risk owners with a focus on ‘needs’ not ‘wants’.
Perhaps ironically, Tania’s university qualifications are in Commerce not OSH, 
which has throughout her career provided a business lens on the organisation and 
been the basis of how she operates in the work environment. For these reasons, she is 
an unequivocal advocate of a risk‑ and opportunity‑based approach.Introduction
“An idealist is essentially risk‑loving with respect to the achievement of the ideal” 
(Cambridge Dictionary, 2024a). The hook of the quote is ‘risk‑loving’ which is a 
counter‑intuitive opening for a book that on face value may appear to be just another 
publication about workplace health and safety. The author is unashamedly an advo‑
cate of embracing risk (and opportunity) as a realistic and essential element of human 
industrious endeavour. This has unfortunately been lost by the occupational safety 
and health (OSH) profession in which the author has worked for over 20 years since 
writing the first edition of Productive Safety Management (PSM1).
In workplaces, there are too many conversations about what can’t be done for 
safety reasons as opposed to what can be achieved – safely, productively and with 
a quality result worth celebrating. The good work done by many OSH professionals 
has become overshadowed by a reputation as ‘nay sayers’, ‘wet blankets’ and obstruc‑
tors of production. From experience, this has resulted in having to earn and sustain 
credibility on every new contract, of which there have been many across various 
industries during a 20‑year career.
Credibility is a high value commodity, especially in hazardous industries.
Without it, a working person may be perceived as inept and vulnerable. At the profes‑
sional level, reasonable success is dependent on being a realist – “a person who tends 
to accept and deal with people and situations as they are” (Cambridge Dictionary, 
2024b). Great success needs more. It needs belief and vision. This book is a blend of 
realism with idealism applied to the management of risk, particularly in operations, 
for good reason.
The overarching objective of this book is to pursue health, safety 
and environmental (HSE) performance concurrently with production 
output and quality work.
‘Production’ is target‑driven, for instance, X number of widgets off the processing 
line or Y tons of ore from a mining operation. Throughout this book, it has equiva‑
lents across different industries. For instance, in the public sector, production equated 
to ‘productivity’. In construction, it is likened to ‘schedule’. In the food and beverage 
industry, it’s customer service and satisfaction. In health services, it relates to patient 
care. Fundamentally, ‘production’ is core business.
Realism is essential to understand risks associated with production, whether you’re 
an engineer, operations manager, supervisor or from support services such as OSH, 
environment, quality, procurement, contractor management and so on. In PSM1, it 
was explained that society’s current approach to risk management is deficient due to 
the failure to recognise and address the tendency of systems of production to degrade 
DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-1 12 Productive Safety Management
(Mol, 2003). This flawed perspective still prevails. The topic will be explored in 
depth in PSM2 together with pragmatic solutions to improve capacity to manage risk 
and workplace practices Operations have the most tangible risk profile. How well this 
is managed greatly influences the performance of the enterprise and in particular, its 
ability to mitigate losses.
A shift from ‘safety‑based’ thinking to ‘risk‑based’ thinking is needed to opti‑
mise performance and pursue potentially conflicting organisational objectives con‑
currently, such as production targets and incident prevention. Idealism is also vital to 
embrace and enable human potential – to adopt a mindset of what can be achieved 
and to provide a working environment for capacity building. The journey described 
in PSM1 from ‘safety’ to ‘risk’ as the driver of a multidisciplinary enterprise strategy 
is mapped in PSM2 with contemporary application and the benefit of a wealth of 
operational experience.
Stepping away for a moment from the workplace and looking more broadly at 
community, the essence of human existence that captures our imagination is the need 
to survive and the desire to thrive. These themes permeate history and continue to 
underpin society’s storytelling. We’re attracted to and in fact rejoice when events of 
intense human adversity are overcome such as when the 12 boys from the Wild Boars 
football team were rescued from Tham Luang Cave in Thailand after being trapped 
by heavy rains and floods in June 2018 (BBC News, 2018).
Our appreciation of human endeavour is warmed by great achievements. We won‑
dered years ago when world records at great sporting events would no longer be 
attained and yet, previous best times continue to be broken. Our everyday lives are 
being transforming by technological innovation and advances. The need to survive 
and the desire to thrive are enduring qualities, and of course, we each have many 
examples to draw on personally and professionally.
In today’s organisations, these fundamentals are framed to some extent by ‘sus‑
tainability’ and ‘resilience’. From a humanistic perspective however, there’s a short‑
fall in any semblance of collective rejoicing in many workplaces. The question 
should be asked, “Is something missing?” Does an experience at work have to be 
grandiose to be worth celebrating? From experience, this is an area of management 
that’s lacking. It can’t be simply glossed over with an end of project dinner or a team 
golf day. More positive experiences should be happening day‑to‑day for managers 
and workers which might be described as “Felt Success”. Modern workplaces seem 
to be desolate of heartening human endeavour and the OSH profession has some 
accountability for this. The growth of ‘safety’ as an industry has a downside that has 
become the modus operandi of the profession.
Bureaucratisation of safety and the culture of risk aversion is a disservice 
to the workforce (managers and workers alike) and to progress.
In recent years, the philosophical movement away from complex OSH management 
systems and processes has gained traction amongst safety professionals, led by emi‑
nent academics in the field. This has focused attention on “Work as Imagined” (WAI) 
as opposed to “Work as Done” (WAD) thanks to Sidney Dekker and others. WAI 
represents the development of OSH processes by those who aren’t directly involved 
in the work but may be considered subject matter experts in risk management such Introduction 3
as OSH professionals. WAD is the operational reality in which OSH and other risks 
must be managed to prevent injuries and incidents. It’s generally agreed that there’s 
a gap that can render OSH paperwork inefficient and ineffective. The distinction 
between WAI and WAD is not new as evident in Barcock v Brighton Corporation
[1949] KB 339. Hilbery J noted:
a system of work is not devised by telling a man to read the regulations and not to break 
them
It is no use for a master to say in court ‘I discharged my common law duty because 
I put down on paper a safe system and put it into the hands of the man if for years they 
showed him by the action of those who were his superiors that the work was not done 
in that way, need not be done in that way; and could be done in another way which 
involved danger.
(Lawinsider.com, 2023)
This is a very powerful quote in the context of OSH management. With the gap 
between WAI and WAD now accepted as problematic, a new dilemma has emerged 
for organisations who’ve invested heavily and embedded their OSH and operational 
management systems. How can they firstly, close the gap and secondly, remove pro‑
cesses that are of low value in terms of risk mitigation? As explained in this book, the 
over‑reliance on additional administrative controls as corrective actions following 
incidents may have created greater complexity for the supervisors and workers who 
must implement and comply with these rules and procedures. It’s little wonder that 
“Felt Success” is so elusive.
The reduction of onerous processes presents a very real challenge for corporate 
and operational managers. How can they justify the removal of existing safety pro‑
cesses or layers of risk assessment and/or controls, to achieve simplification hav‑
ing been the instigators of such bureaucracy? This is in the context of increasing 
corporate accountability and also, in some jurisdictions, exposure of individuals to 
risks of penalties and potential jail sentences from OSH legislative duties imposed 
on enterprise ‘officers’. OSH management systems and practices have developed to 
both protect workers from harm and the organisation from statutory penalties and 
reputational damage. Both guard against these negative outcomes and perpetuate a 
culture of risk aversion.
Does this mean that organisations are stuck with a status quo of burdensome OSH 
systems? Improvements in productivity and minimisation of waste are paramount in 
today’s economy in which positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) out‑
comes are expected of corporations. The question to the OSH profession is how will 
they adapt to deliver assurance based on prescribed legislative requirements as well as 
add to productivity improvements? The implication is the need for change which means:
The OSH Profession needs to loosen their grip on risk aversion and 
‘what‑if’ stories told to justify outdated, redundant approaches to OSH 
management that border on fearmongering.
Whilst there’s general agreement of the need for transformation in the OSH profes‑
sion, the missing piece is ‘How’. The primary aim of this second edition is to explain 
how to take a risk‑ and opportunity‑based approach to ‘The Work’ to pursue HSE 4 Productive Safety Management
performance, continuity of production and quality outcomes concurrently. That aim 
requires a realist’s approach to risk management. Essentially, this includes tackling 
the following issues:
• Challenging cultural rhetoric such as ‘Safety First’ and ‘Zero Harm’;
• Acknowledging that risk is dynamic not static so today’s risk review is 
likely irrelevant tomorrow;
• Disciplinary silos and their respective approaches to risk management are 
creating blind spots that can lead to losses including catastrophic events;
• Adding lower order controls such as administrative procedures may be 
increasing complexity that raises rather than reduces operational risks in 
the flawed belief that the new risk level is ‘as low as reasonably practicable’ 
(ALARP); and
• Residual risk defined by ‘ALARP’ doesn’t clearly consider the fact that 
 systems of production tend to degrade.
PSM1 was written considering several fatalities in the mining community where 
the author resided. It was apparent that across the industry in the 1990s (and prior 
to then) that production pressure was a challenge to manage and often presented 
a hindrance to effective safety management. The problem was how to overcome 
the conflict between safety and production. PSM1 proposed that production, safety 
and quality aren’t ends in themselves but outcomes of effective risk management. 
Consequently, the sub‑title of PSM1 was, “A strategic, multidisciplinary manage‑
ment system for hazardous industries that ties safety and production together”.
At the time, it wasn’t common practice to integrate human resource management 
(HRM) strategies such as leadership, competency training and development with 
safety management. This was a significant gap attributable to the immaturity of both 
professions. For example, HRM was in many organisations only just emerging from 
personnel management which was primarily concerned with the employment pro‑
cess and payroll. OSH was also rudimentary and non‑strategic, focused on tasks and 
fault‑finding at the operational level. To overcome the gap, PSM1 integrated OSH, 
HRM, quality, environmental management and engineering to provide a whole busi‑
ness approach to effective risk management.
There were two key models that underpinned the management system presented 
in the previous edition. The first, ‘The Entropy Model’, which is explained in detail in 
Chapter 1 of this edition, illustrates that there are two types of risk – residual risk and 
entropic risk – that can lead to losses in production, HSE and/or quality performance. 
It also provides a four‑step risk management strategy for mitigating these risks that 
can be applied strategically and operationally.
The second model, the “Strategic Alignment Channel”, presented again in Chapter 
2, explains the need for the enterprise to achieve alignment across three areas. These 
are firstly, of the organisation to the external environment, secondly, internally of the 
enterprise’s physical, financial and human capital, and thirdly, internally between 
organisational and workforce values. The original “Channel” in many ways pre‑dated 
today’s approach to ESG frameworks. It’s the Entropy Model however that has 
emerged from initial publication in 2003, as having significant relevance to today’s Introduction 5
OSH profession and other risk‑related disciplines. As explained in Chapter 2, the 
organisation continues to require the input of multiple functions such as engineering, 
HRM, OSH, quality, environmental and operational management to achieve effec‑
tive risk mitigation and opportunity exploitation across the enterprise and throughout 
its lifecycle phases.
The second primary aim of this edition is to establish a renewed ideal for the 
management of risk and opportunity in organisations that enables great outcomes 
for people by transforming some entrenched bad habits and instilling good ones. The 
first one of these is blame. Other authors including Dekker (books including ‘Just 
Culture’ and ‘Stop Blaming’) have covered this topic from a psychological and socio‑
logical perspective in relation to OSH practices that result in blaming the worker 
(unsafe acts) for accidents. In this book, the fallibilities and capabilities of human 
beings are discussed from an objective risk‑based perspective. Human resources are 
one of four systems of production that entities employ to achieve outputs (products or 
services). This systems‑driven approach reduces biases.
Shifting blame to management is also unconstructive. Managers and supervisors 
might want to promote employees’ ideas and create an open, honest culture but may 
not be empowered to act on the input from their team or they may feel compelled 
to adopt a short‑term outlook to work (Sherf et al., 2019). Organisational conditions 
such as these were explained by the Alignment Fallacy in PSM1 and will be revisited 
in this edition. The second bad habit addressed in PSM2 is under‑valuing people but 
with a caution.
Catchcries such as ‘Our people are our Greatest Asset’ are as superficial 
as ‘Safety First’ when tough decisions must be made about resourcing 
levels and production targets.
Throughout this edition, where there’s rhetoric in current industry language, it will be 
called out. This pragmatic approach coupled with an objective risk‑based approach 
to HR risks is balanced with humanistic values and high regard for managers and 
workers alike. The author honours the many people worked with over the years but 
more importantly, it feels true to self. After all, most people are doing the right thing 
for the right reasons.
The rest of this introduction addresses how these aims will be delivered. Chapter 
1 will provide a more detailed explanation of why the Entropy Model has increased 
in relevance plus the contents of more recent republications including the American 
Society of Safety Professionals’ (ASSP) book, Safety Leadership and Professional 
Development (2018), ‘Chapter 29 Risk Leadership: A Multidisciplinary Approach’. 
In 2020, the model was expanded to address organisational and leadership factors 
in the ASSP’s Professional Safety Journal, Safety and Entropy: A Leadership Issue
(Grieve and Van der Stap, 2020).
More broadly, there has been a shift towards a risk‑based overview involving inte‑
gration of disciplines. The overlaps of OSH and HRM are now recognised including 
leadership and culture as part of human capital development. The work of numerous 
subject matter experts (Klussmann, 2009; Kymal et al., 2015; Pardy and Andrews 
2009) have acknowledged the benefits of integrated management systems (IMS). 6 Productive Safety Management
These include cost and resource savings with improved financial performance. From 
a risk management perspective, there’s better risk prioritisation, positive corporate 
reputation, improved communication and efficiencies in business operations into a 
single business management system.
The recent changes to International Standards have directed organisations to 
this risk‑based approach as evident in ISO 31000 Risk Management, ISO 45001 
OSH Management Systems, ISO 14001 Environmental Management and ISO 9001 
Quality Management. The standards previously didn’t prescribe the need for oppor‑
tunity analysis and stakeholder needs considerations as part of enterprise strategy 
development. Many segments of industry are receptive to this concept of a fully inte‑
grated risk management methodology addressing systems risks however, they don’t 
necessarily know how to best achieve this. This topic will be discussed in Chapter 2 
and developed throughout subsequent chapters. Overall:
It’s a necessity that businesses balance potentially conflicting objectives 
such as production, quality, OSH performance and cost to ensure 
short‑term viability and longer‑term sustainability.
In the context of conflicting goals, there are numerous qualitative and quantitative 
tools used to drive risk‑based decision‑making to seek optimal outcomes. The poten‑
tial struggle between safety and production must be addressed to achieve safe, effi‑
cient, quality‑driven work and decision‑making from the board to the operational 
level. There remains, however, a gap between high‑level risk management principles 
(societal and enterprise) and operational practice. This is most evident in high‑risk 
industries where fatalities, serious injuries and debilitating industrial illnesses con‑
tinue to have the greatest rates. The fundamental questions are: ‘What is this concept 
of alignment?’ ‘Is alignment being achieved in organisations in relation to safety and 
production? ‘If not, why not?’
The impact of this emerging risk‑based approach is that for implementation to 
be effective, discipline silos within organisation need to be broken down. Hollnagel 
(2021) reinforced this and highlighted the negative impact on culture with the 
potential for conflict over safety versus quality versus production versus reliabil‑
ity cultures. The resulting confusion and intra‑disciplinary non‑alignment require 
a broader understanding of what connects failure and success in each and all disci‑
plines. According to the principles of the Entropy Model:
The key issue that management should be worried about is evidence of 
losses. Production downtime, quality deficiencies and safety incidents are 
all losses connected by ineffective risk management.
Discipline‑based silos can impede the enterprise from seeing the operational reality 
with the risk of being dominated by the loudest voice which is usually core busi‑
ness (production). Within disciplines, the focus can be too narrow. For instance, the 
OSH profession’s primary work method is to identify ‘hazards’, assess the risk and 
advise on suitable controls, then to monitor the work to ensure that such controls are Introduction 7
effective. The problem is that work is dynamic and therefore ‘hazards’ emerge then 
disappear and new ‘hazards’ cycle through. An example is the arrival of building 
materials on a construction site and the production of waste, both of which constrain 
the active footprint. This may then have effects on access and egress around the 
work area. Construction involves multiple tasks by different contractors and some 
of these activities being undertaken simultaneously (SIMOPS) may be incompatible, 
for instance, overhead crane operations adjacent to construction crews working at 
ground level. These dynamic, complex and ever‑changing risk profiles are discussed 
in detail in this edition.
Updates to ISO standards, legislation in some jurisdictions and industry‑driven 
practical planning, are struggling to shift the obsession with ‘hazards’ to broadened 
‘hazard and risk’. More needs to be done to expand the risk perspective.
The Work is dynamic not static. The focus needs to be on risk not 
simply hazards.
There may be known ‘hazards’ that need to be mitigated but it’s the changing interfaces 
between human resources, processes, technologies, and the physical work environment 
that can fluctuate and result in injuries (from an OSH perspective) but also losses (from 
an operational perspective ‑production, quality, cost). These are all part of normal 
working situations and don’t need to be extraordinary to result in a negative outcome.
The Entropy Model will be used in Chapter 3 to discuss processes (how the 
work is done) and these constantly moving parts that affect organisational perfor‑
mance across functional areas. An important element will be the impact of com‑
plexity. Adding further rules and procedures because of an incident investigation 
may increase rather than reduce the risks that contributed to the undesirable event. 
This will challenge current assumptions about ‘as low as reasonably practicable’ 
(ALARP). Are enterprises being realistic about their residual risks when they’re rely‑
ing heavily on procedural controls to manage these risks? Such controls depend on 
human performance which is known to be fallible.
Traditional risk assessment processes factor in exposure. This isn’t simply dura‑
tion. It’s a sum of a complex set of variables associated with systems of production. 
This will be discussed in depth and used to question current incident investigation 
processes that place too much emphasis on human error. Case studies will be used 
to analyse the combinations of risk sources that can lead to losses and explain where 
human error fits within the total risk profile of the workplace.
Chapter 3 will touch on some key definitions within OSH legislation and explain 
why these present opportunities for businesses. The cases for minimal compliance 
and beyond compliance will be presented. The latter will introduce the concept of 
a Principal Risk and Opportunity Strategy proposing that it may enable enterprises 
to adopt the behaviours of high‑reliability organisations (HROs) and thereby pursue 
improvements across multiple functions.
In many industries, OSH procedures have become increasingly complex, so a 
sense‑making framework is needed to right‑size management systems, documents 
and tools.8 Productive Safety Management
Risk‑based management systems should be designed to ensure safe, 
efficient, quality‑driven work which concurrently protects operations from 
chaos and complexity.
A case study from the utility industry will be used to evaluate four categories of 
intervention and how these can be applied. These are ‘simple’, ‘complicated’, ‘com‑
plex’ and ‘chaotic’. Traditional OSH risk management practices will be challenged in 
terms of the application of ALARP. The ‘ALARP Assumption’ explains that opera‑
tions can inherit deficiencies in design because of project cost pressures. A warn‑
ing is provided against low‑value thoroughness – adding further layers of low‑order 
controls with diminishing return on risk reduction, and the potential for complexity 
to make risk rise as workers become overwhelmed by rules. This organisational risk 
aversion may introduce risk transfer where increased thoroughness, which is time 
consuming, results in unforeseen consequences such as production pressure and a 
negative impact on the workplace culture.
In Chapters 4–6, the other systems of production residual and entropic risks will 
be explored in detail. Chapter 4 covers those risks associated with technology, which 
includes plant, equipment and tools (both hardware and software). The discussion 
will go back to the basics of engineering decisions that affect safety in design, the 
quality of components and standards of construction. The aim of ALARP should be 
to minimise the residual risks inherited by operations and the potential entropic risks 
(caused by degradation) that will develop through the technology’s lifecycle.
It will be proposed that high‑risk industries have an unacknowledged predisposi‑
tion to failure because entropic risk prevention is not part of the language of current 
organisations. As a solution to this gap, the five principles of HROs will be intro‑
duced with particular focus on their preoccupation with failure. Although there are 
numerous disasters from which the industry should have learned and attained deeply 
embedded and practised risk management capabilities, catastrophic losses continue 
to occur. This points to the need for greater learning across industries supported by 
global communication capacity to prevent disasters. Historic case studies will be 
referenced to support this argument.
The chapter on technology wouldn’t be complete without an exploration of the 
rate of change in society. This calls for transformation on several fronts. The first is 
professional adaptation.
Risk‑related professionals should be enlisted out of their narrow discipline 
to a 360‑degree perspective of their organisation.
This is required to better understand the impact of these technological changes. 
In this mix, in relation to both traditional and future systems of production, is the 
human‑technology interface and the interdependencies that cause risk to be dynamic 
and complex. Secondly, some of the key issues in managing technological risk that 
currently face operations remain highly relevant. These include supply chain rela‑
tionships, standardisation where possible and both in‑house and outsourced mainte‑
nance. The benefits and disadvantages of various strategies are considered from an 
operational risk perspective.Introduction 9
Thirdly, the extent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be visualised with 
a particular emphasis on the impact this will have on operational risk manage‑
ment. Whilst the pervasiveness of this revolution is difficult to fathom, there are 
some key themes that have emerged. The input of a specialist researcher in artifi‑
cial intelligence was sought to complete this section of Chapter 4. The trends that 
will be discussed include human‑machine cooperation; the balance of power in 
human‑machine systems; nonlinearity of complex machine adoption; trust between 
agents and reliability of the whole system; and privacy versus efficiency. The revo‑
lution is revisited in the subsequent chapters about the physical environment and 
human resources.
To close out Chapter 4, the efficacy of traditional enterprise risk management 
practices is contested. The solution proposed is a shift towards ‘sense‑making’ as the 
foundation of risk‑based decision‑making. This provides a baseline for later chapters 
that explore choice selection at the leadership, supervisory and worker levels.
Chapter 5 covers the residual and entropic risks associated with the physical envi‑
ronment system of production. The key theme of HSE in design is followed up from 
the technological discussion in Chapter 4. The impact of engineering for HSE begins 
with minimising the residual risks inherited by operations and the potential entropic 
risks that will develop through the facility or site lifecycle.
Current organisations struggle to consider the wider risks to their business units 
that arise from the natural physical environment. There are significant constraints in 
risk assessment which can lead to ‘black swans’. These are unknown unknowns and 
result from incomplete data, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that 
caused the Fukushima nuclear accident. In this mix, there is continuing confusion 
and the re‑emergence of terminology acknowledging that some risks aren’t within 
human control. If the worker or the manager can no longer be blamed, must God be 
the blame?
It’s critical that the concept of ‘Acts of God’ in risk management practices 
including OSH is clarified.
When does a root cause of an undesirable event become an ‘Act of God’ compared 
to a system deficiency? These ‘Acts of God’ are sometimes used to explain catas‑
trophes and extensive fatalities so, as explained in Chapter 5, the management of 
physical environment risks must include fatal risk controls. Monitoring regimes and 
emergency response capability are critical on the preventative and recovery sides of 
a bow‑tie risk assessment, respectively. Operationally, these two mitigation strategies 
contribute to and demonstrate tangible organisational capacity.
The fundamentals of residual risk management will be explained in relation to 
the physical workplace. Poor initial site design is a major long‑term contributor to 
sub‑optimal productivity, safety, environment and quality performance and poten‑
tial lost opportunities when modifications are made, for instance, when existing 
infrastructure creates a constrained footprint for expansion. In many organisations, 
there are avenues to leverage practices used by industry leaders. For instance, small 
to medium enterprises (SMEs) can apply improvement strategies such as the Lean 
Production Principle of 5S within the physical workplace.10 Productive Safety Management
Practical benefits of Lean Production are explained along with a 
cautionary word about being too pedantic about ‘compliance’ during 
day‑to‑day operations.
The concept of the physical workplace having a ‘saturation point’ where chaos 
transitions from supporting efficiency to becoming inefficient will be explained. In 
this context, the current approach to undertaking workplace safety inspections is 
challenged.
The truth is that ‘organised chaos’ is a natural characteristic of how work 
gets done. Operational personnel will often use this term to describe the 
reality of day‑to‑day work.
Chapter 5 will conclude with a visualisation of the physical workplace changes result‑
ing from the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the impact these will have on opera‑
tional risk management. This considers what constitutes the workplace currently and 
into the future. The characteristics of the gig economy are particularly interesting 
as is the rise in home‑based work since COVID‑19. Autonomous technologies are 
removing some workers from the hazardous environment. The final topic covered in 
this area is the adaptation of the workplace for an aging labour force.
The final chapter (Chapter 6) on systems of production will talk about human 
resources residual and entropic risks. The confusion which abounds in the OSH pro‑
fession calls for a shift to a systems approach to HR risks and move beyond the 
human as hero or hazard. This will be contextualised along with the psychosocio‑
logical lens currently being applied to OSH and operational risk management. It’s 
important to step away from associating the technical process of assessing HR risks 
and confusing this with any form of discrimination. The objective is to protect peo‑
ple from harm and enable productive work, not to treat them unfairly or downplay 
moral and ethical principles.
Chapter 6 will introduce the influence of mathematics on human performance 
that supports the concept of rising entropy as a risk. Analysis is enabling more objec‑
tive HR risk assessment. Applied mathematics including Shannon’s Entropy Method 
results in better assessment of failure modes and effects. It looks at the degree of dis‑
order in the system (of which a human may be a part) to identify unexpected trends 
that may present risks. Human fallibility is accepted as a fact and doesn’t interfere 
with the evaluation methodology.
In PSM1, the highest risk group identified were young, inexperienced workers. 
This is still the case at the society level but the increase in incidents and injuries 
in older workers as evidenced by statistics suggests that this demographic requires 
specific risk management strategies. This becomes an important consideration in 
Chapter 7 in which a semi‑quantitative risk assessment method is proposed to evalu‑
ate the residual and entropic risks of each of the systems of production including 
human resources (as described later in this introduction).
In Chapter 6, some of the traditional OSH‑related human risks are discussed 
such as fatigue, mental ill‑health and stress. A table of residual and entropic risks Introduction 11
with applicable risk management strategies will be provided to avoid replicating the 
detailed discussion in PSM1. In this edition, the commentary turns to clarifying those 
risks that are an organisational accountability versus those that are the individuals’ 
accountability. Chapter 6 also introduces the concept of leadership degradation.
A significant gap in current management approaches is the failure to 
monitor and to act effectively to support personnel in influential leadership 
positions through phases of degraded job performance, 
using a risk‑based approach.
Recent changes to some OSH legislations have included psychosocial hazard man‑
agement but these are insufficient from a holistic perspective. Degradation in the 
leadership ranks can have a ripple effect to peers and subordinates which should trig‑
ger corrective action by senior management and a ‘maintenance’ strategy to assist the 
affected person to improved job performance.
A further area that requires an objective risk‑based approach is the clarifi‑
cation of what constitutes a ‘safety violation’. This will be considered within a 
 production‑driven organisational culture and strategies will be suggested to ensure 
fair outcomes with optimal individual and enterprise learning. Violations are behav‑
iours that are a clearly defined subset of HR risk that need to be evaluated within a 
systems approach. In practice, what constitutes a ‘violation’ can’t simply be dismissed 
as intent. However, a warning is also given against unclear boundaries of account‑
ability and responsibility. These may result in unexpected cultural consequences.
An individual or group in collaboration mustn’t be able to blame the 
‘system’ or ‘production‑pressure’, as a means of avoiding accountability for 
a violation that is supported by objective evidence.
Chapter 6 which is the last of the series on systems of production risks will raise 
some of the key developments in personalised technologies emerging in the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution. The dialogue includes the use of exoskeletons for biomechani‑
cal support and the integration of wearables into OSH and operational management 
systems. The benefits and disadvantages will be presented along with social issues of 
privacy and misuse of data for individual performance monitoring.
Much of the contents of Chapter 7 will cover risk quantification and management 
strategy taken from PSM1; however, this will be refined with the benefit of 20 years 
of operational experience. From an academic perspective, the proposed methodol‑
ogy is yet to be tested empirically so the reader is encouraged to consider the logic 
which has been applied. The purpose of the approach is to promote healthy cynicism 
towards current risk assessment methods, particularly, reliance on risk matrices, and 
to provide an alternative. From practice as a risk workshop facilitator, participants’ 
discussions can drift into debate and personal stories of incidents through their indi‑
vidual perception of what they consider to be acceptable versus unacceptable risk. 
The skilled facilitator must bring the group back to the purpose of ranking risks 
relative to each other. Most operational risk assessments using the matrix generate 12 Productive Safety Management
a risk register which is primarily ‘work‑as‑imagined’. The semi‑quantitative risk 
assessment method in Chapter 7 will break risk down into its component parts using 
real‑work scenarios. This aims to provide a more pragmatic understanding of the 
complexities and interdependencies between systems of production than applying the 
risk matrix to ‘what if’ scenarios.
The deficiencies of risk matrices will be presented, and a case put forward for a 
mental model for assessing residual and entropic risks of the four systems of produc‑
tion, using eight risk scorers. These will factor in primary risk parameters and risk 
modifiers. For instance, for process residual risk, the energy level is proposed to be 
the primary risk parameter. The complexity of the process is the key determinant 
of the process entropic risk. The method that will be presented has been named the 
‘Dynamic Combinations Risk Method’ (DCRM) to acknowledge that operational 
risks are dynamic and combinations of systems of production including the inter‑
faces between these systems.
In this edition, the ‘ALARP Assumption’ will be added. This will be revisited in 
Chapter 7 to re‑emphasise serious concerns about the organisational habit of sim‑
plistic corrective actions following incidents. Do more procedures and rules really 
reduce the risk or only make the work more difficult to achieve efficiently? Are there 
any subsequent negative consequences for the culture and operational buy‑in?
The ‘ALARP Assumption’ suggests that as operations mature, there’s a 
tendency after incidents to add more low‑cost, lower order procedural 
controls that may actually increase the risk rather than reduce it.
In Chapter 7, DCRM will be applied to the case study of the BP Refinery Explosion 
and Fire that occurred in Texas in 2005. The residual and entropic risks that were 
present prior to the disaster will be identified using the regulator’s report and ana‑
lysed to consider how these contributed to the catastrophic event. Figures 7.2 and 
7.4 will illustrate the scoring of the residual and entropic risks, respectively. The 
eight risk scorers (residual and entropic risks for each of the four systems of produc‑
tion) include risk modifiers which either increase or decrease the risk. For instance, 
simplification and standardisation are proposed to reduce process entropic risks, in 
other words, lowing potential for deviation from well‑planned activities that might 
otherwise introduce degraded states.
It will be proposed that a risk assessment team would better understand the key 
strategies for residual risk management and entropic risk prevention if the primary 
risk parameters and risk modifiers became part of analysis discussions. These could 
then be used to identify more effective risk management strategies than the current 
practice of listing controls in the Risk Register then ascribing a residual risk score 
after controls are in place. It will be proposed that if DCRM is a valid risk assess‑
ment approach, then it would follow that the Total Risk Profile of an operation would 
comprise the sum of risks of the activities undertaken.
Chapter 8 will introduce the Entropy Model applied to the less tangible factors 
that determine capacity. These will be identified as capacity builders – leadership, 
competencies, management systems and resilience with resourcefulness. It will Introduction 13
be explained that such factors have residual risks and can suffer from degradation 
that can lead to organisational losses. Many of the disasters that will be discussed 
throughout this edition are of organisations that had serious deficiencies in leader‑
ship and culture leading up to their catastrophic events. From experience, part of 
the problem lays in leadership expectations and how these are framed compared 
to how leadership is delivered in the workplace. Perhaps, there’s such a thing as 
‘Leadership‑as‑Imaged’ versus ‘Leadership‑as‑Done’?
Some of the rhetoric about appropriate leadership that is articulated in 
operational environments is debunked using a continuum of leadership 
styles, from assertive to collaborative, as it relates to the level of risk and 
urgency.
‘Hard’ or ‘soft’ leadership may be required depending on the type of work being done 
and the risk profile of the systems of production used to do the work. The construc‑
tion industry will be given as an example of the suitability of command‑and‑control 
project delivery. This will be supported by a discussion about some cultural fac‑
tors that hinder risk‑based decision‑making including groupthink and stereotypes. 
A significant mindset transformation is overdue, especially for the OSH profession. 
Chapters 8 and 9 home in on being realistic about leadership.
There’s no such thing as ‘Safety Leadership’, only ‘Leadership’.
Otherwise, there also must be ‘Environmental Leadership/Stewardship’, 
‘Quality Leadership’, ‘Production Leadership’ etc.
Apart from inadequate understanding of the nature of risk, the biggest gap in cur‑
rent risk management strategies is the lack of criteria on which to drive consistent 
risk‑based decision‑making at various levels of the organisational hierarchy. PSM1
introduced the ‘Reasonableness Test’. In Chapter 8, this will be adapted. It will 
describe a process that includes a Risk Ethos to test the suitability of decision choices 
and ensure the desired enterprise culture is sustained. Managers and supervisors 
should be taught how to apply the test in their work to balance short‑term demands 
with longer‑term objectives. This would shift timeframes, for instance, from achiev‑
ing today’s production target to continuity of safe production as an outcome of collec‑
tive effort. The Reasonableness Test is specifically designed to eliminate unhealthy 
internal competition amongst managers and supervisors who are responsible for core 
business targets. This is achieved by ensuring that serious safety and maintenance 
issues aren’t dismissed for perceived short‑term production gains by one shift super‑
visor forcing the next shift supervisor to make the same decision. Will the ‘weakest 
link’ take responsibility for the escalating risks or will issues continue to be ignored?
The discussion will explain that the Risk Ethos is the backbone of the organisa‑
tional culture defining how work is done towards common objectives. When supervi‑
sors make sound risk‑based decisions, there should be greater consistency, confidence 
and earned credibility with peers and subordinates. Operational leadership needs to 14 Productive Safety Management
be adapted to situational variables and the current risk profile, whilst also being 
transparent and trustworthy. The latter can’t be achieved if supervisors, because of 
production demands, compromise serious safety and/or maintenance risks. One poor 
decision can erode previously earned credibility.
The dialogue will turn to examples of how frontline supervisors can lead their 
team confidently through practical risk assessment exercises thereby earning trust 
and developing the competencies of their subordinates. There are issues within cur‑
rent OSH management systems that stifle practical approaches to risk management 
and prevent operational managers and supervisors from leading competently. Much 
of this stems from methods designed from an office perspective such as the use of 
spreadsheets or databases rather than something more meaningful to operational 
personnel, such as photographs and notes.
If head office needs collated risk information for business analytics, then 
the relevant function (OSH, quality, environment) should do this work 
rather than expecting operational managers to be masters of everything. 
They should be busy managing the operational risks not satisfying 
the ‘system’.
Another important part of the operational manager’s and supervisor’s role is to keep 
their subordinates engaged with the work. The need for frontline leaders to effectively 
communicate with their team, particularly during onboarding of new personnel and 
whenever management of change is required, will be described. This is needed to 
prevent cultural degradation. Workplace conversations can revert to technical mat‑
ters and social topics rather than supporting the team members’ confidence and moti‑
vation especially through times of ‘change fatigue’. This discussion will draw on the 
work of Grieve and Van der Stap who published, ‘Safety and Entropy: A Leadership 
Issue’, in the American Society of Safety Professionals’ journal in 2020.
The chapter will close with an invitation for OSH Managers to scrutinise the man‑
agement system to differentiate ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ with the view to ‘right‑sizing’ the 
system and making it more inclusive of operational input. A clear explanation will be 
provided of how to shift from centralisation to decentralisation of the system whilst 
maintaining the capacity to deliver governance and assurance requirements for the 
Executive.
Chapter 9 builds on leadership development and turns to individual behaviours. 
People make decisions about whether to take risks or manage risks every day. 
This is normal behaviour. The issue at work is defining what level of risk, in other 
words, what are the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable risks from 
an organisational (collective) perspective. The ‘system’ is supposed to define that 
but the intangible elements of that system such as the unspoken enterprise culture 
may be counteracting the overall strategy. It’s important therefore to understand the 
relationship between risk‑taking versus risk‑managing and how these depend on 
 decision‑making processes, acceptance of behaviours, and the organisational cul‑
ture. The Risk Behaviour Model (first published in 2008) will be updated to explain 
the interdependencies that connect individual behaviours, culture and learning out‑
comes within an operational context.Introduction 15
Fortunate technical, management and supervisory professionals get to work with 
a variety of different enterprises in diverse industries. This gives them exposure to 
the challenges of being engaged within divergent levels of maturity in terms of busi‑
ness risk appetite, production‑centricity, and decision timeframes. Different strate‑
gies are required for these entities which for the purpose of the discussion will fall 
into the categories of ‘The Good’, ‘The Bad’ and ‘The Simply Irresponsible’. At an 
organisation level, there can be distinct attitudes that determine risk‑taking versus 
risk‑managing as the preferred status quo. The new incumbent OSH or Operations 
Manager needs the competencies to readily identify where the enterprise sits on 
this continuum of non‑compliance, to compliance, to beyond compliance because 
that will influence how they go about their work. Will they operate and maintain 
the current system with incremental adjustments or need a detailed gaps analysis to 
undertake a longer‑term planned improvement strategy (the ‘Good’ and the ‘Bad’ 
respectively)? Have they walked into a business that needs a significant strategic 
overhaul including management’s appetite for risk (‘The Simply Irresponsible’)? It 
should be borne in mind that ‘compliance’ isn’t limited to OSH. It could include 
employment laws, taxation laws, company governance requirements, client contrac‑
tual obligations etc.
These maturity categories differ at the fundamental level of organisational val‑
ues. Unfortunately, personnel in operations seldom get the opportunity to consider 
and articulate their values and the impact these have on their behavioural decisions. 
These lay at the heart of developing risk management as a life skill. Too many train‑
ing programmes are classroom‑based and don’t firstly, allow workers to develop 
practical in‑field risk assessment competencies, and secondly, to understand their 
primary motivations for taking risks.
A key question is whether personnel are having an internal dialogue that 
prompts the question, ‘Is it worth the risk?’
In Chapter 9, further practical strategies will be provided for supervisors to effec‑
tively lead day‑to‑day work and support subordinates to keep them engaged and 
practising risk management as a life skill. It’s not an onerous strategy to increase the 
levels of operational participation and ownership of critical risk controls. Workplace 
Champions can be developed using a decentralised implementation plan by aligning 
critical control verifications with those who already have the subject matter expertise 
in the relevant area, for instance, electricians reporting on the operability of residual 
current devices. Others may be enlisted by providing essential training and develop‑
ment, for instance, fire wardens conducting drills but also verifying drill frequency 
against the plan for such activities and the follow‑up on corrective actions.
In PSM1, there was extensive discussion on building organisational capacity. This 
was illustrated using the ‘Capacity Reservoir’ which will be adapted in this edition 
and shown in Figure 9.4. This is the collective competencies of the workforce for 
which there are numerous inputs. Capacity leads to an overflow of resourcefulness 
and resilience – qualities needed for continual improvement, optimisation of systems 
of production and the ability to cope with crises and threats. The process of building 
capacity will be illustrated beginning with an effective recruitment and selection 16 Productive Safety Management
process. Many inputs focus on enhancing human capital value such as accelerated 
learning using on‑the‑job competency development. Other areas requiring attention 
will be covered. These include right sizing the integrated management system, moni‑
toring external and internal risks and opportunities, and developing a deep under‑
standing of operations through data analytics to detect anomalies and trends.
Figure  9.4 which will illustrate the process of building organisational capacity 
includes expected outputs. These cover better review of systems of production, clear 
roles and accountability of risk owners, and a culture centred on loss prevention and 
exploitation of opportunities across multiple functions. Effective leadership contin‑
ues as a key requirement for success. Further strategies will be provided to enhance 
the culture using affective, intellectual and action‑oriented competencies. Throughout 
Chapters 8 and 9, the focus of professional development will be on managing risks and 
pragmatic, activity‑based participation that enables managers and supervisors to lead 
in ways that are natural to the work, themselves and the team environment.
In Chapter 10, the discussions within previous chapters will be tied together, 
culminating in greater understanding of the principles applied by HROs. Aspiring 
enterprises can achieve business improvement be adopting these according to their 
unique circumstances. Some organisations, however, that considered themselves to 
be HROs, failed as evident by catastrophic events. This highlights the pitfalls of 
ignoring degraded systems of production and organisational factors such as cultural 
and leadership decay.
Operations need more practical approaches than simply following the principle 
of preoccupation with failure. They need to focus on day‑to‑day incremental losses 
that constitute waste. This ties back to the Entropy Model and the rising entropic 
risk curve with losses evident as production downtime, HSE incidents and quality 
deficiencies. These should draw management’s attention, well ahead of escalation 
towards an inevitable catastrophic event, such as a fatality, force majeure, environ‑
mental disaster or loss of a key customer due to failure to meet quality requirements.
In Chapter 10, operations are provided with a reason to be sceptical about ALARP 
and the residual risk they inherit from design, construction and commissioning 
phases of their facility or site. Cost minimisation at the project front‑end engineer‑
ing and design phase can start a process by which sites inherent higher levels of 
residual risk and vulnerability to entropic risks (degradation) than appear on paper 
in the risk register. This warrants extreme or chronic wariness depending on the 
extent of HSE in design deficiencies within operation’s infrastructure and technolo‑
gies, and the processes by which these generate production. The discussion points 
to potential unknown unknowns (black swans) in the build that operations receive 
at handover after commissioning. New ways of looking for unknown unknowns are 
required. This may be aided by mathematical analysis of entropy and by challenging 
the accepted level of ALARP; effectively going back to the ‘drawing board’.
Chapter 10 concludes by proposing ten strategies to move organisations towards 
high levels of reliability based on the Entropy Model and other tools discussed in this 
edition, in combination with adaptive HRO principles. These include the case for 
developing risk management as a life skill, which may be an opportunity to reduce 
the costs and training by silo‑driven disciplines, where there’s currently duplica‑
tion and competing messaging, such as ‘safety leadership’ versus ‘environmental 
stewardship’. This holistic approach should focus on building capacity towards Introduction 17
multidisciplinary risk‑ and opportunity‑based, enterprise leadership and culture 
development. Much of the waste in current organisations is a by‑product of func‑
tional silos each driving their own agenda.
The ten strategies are diverse and will apply to various industries and enterprises 
in different ways. This means that critical thinking should be used when reading this 
edition. The final chapter consolidates some of the key themes developed throughout 
which include:
• honesty in assessing the identity of the enterprise;
• understanding risk not as a singular concept but involving residual and 
entropic risks that are dynamic, complex and ever‑changing;
• caution in relation to current risk management practices and accepted bases 
for ALARP;
• better ways of managing risk day‑to‑day that lead to higher levels of partici‑
pation, consultation and ownership; and
• having longer‑term strategies to develop capacity and ways of working 
collaboratively.
A transformation from silo‑based thinking to risk‑ and opportunity‑based thinking 
is the critical mindset change needed for organisations to be successful in the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution. The reader, regardless of their professional background, is 
invited to make this transformation.

THE NATURE OF RISK
Over the years, safety culture branding has morphed into mythology and rhetoric. 
This is despite many supervisors and workers struggling to make heartfelt commit‑
ments to concepts such as ‘Zero Harm’ or ‘Safety First’. Why? Realistically, there’s 
no such thing as zero incidents or zero injuries simply because risk can’t be elimi‑
nated. The straightforward task of pruning the roses is an example. It’s a good out‑
come to complete the job without a scratch but chances are that despite gloves and a 
long‑sleeved shirt, there will be at least one minor injury as the day’s work goes on. 
Likewise, it’s easy for ‘Safety First’ to be followed when there’s no production pres‑
sure. Once deadlines or targets are looming, the incentive to expedite the work by 
taking shortcuts increases. Hollnagel referred to this as the Efficiency‑Thoroughness 
Trade‑Off (Hollnagel, 2023).
The gap between ‘zero’ and ‘ouch’ is probably as wide as WAI and WAD. The 
managerial motivation for investing in branding probably came from well‑meant 
intentions to articulate commitment to the health and safety of workers. There is to 
a degree a logical argument behind this; however, it’s the operational implementa‑
tion that lacks credibility. Specifically, the stance that is taken to ‘Zero Harm’ is 
that if we, as an organisation, don’t espouse zero, then we must be saying that inju‑
ries are acceptable. In the workplace, it’s difficult to explain to workers that ‘zero’ 
is an ideal or aspirational goal because workers think practically not idealistically. 
Examples such as this will be expanded in Chapter 2 which discusses the ‘Alignment 
Fallacy’ – why safety policy and strategy doesn’t consistently become operational 
reality, especially in the context of strong core business drivers.
To challenge the delusion of zero, PSM1 presented the Entropy Model to redefine 
risk. This will be illustrated later in this chapter. Risk management practices con‑
tinue to rely solely on reducing residual risk (the remaining risk after all controls 
have been implemented). The Entropy Model, however, introduced the concept of 
‘degradation’ of systems with a resulting rising ‘Entropic Risk’. From the outset, the 
model proposed:
There’s no such condition as ‘zero’ risk so therefore ‘Zero Harm’ is a 
fallacy as is nil incidents and injuries. Debate about ‘Zero’, philosophically 
or statistically, is noise that the original Entropy Model (Mol, 2003) 
sought to silence.
Many companies embraced branding and some companies continue to advertise 
vacancies for a ‘Zero Harm Manager’. It would be a brave incumbent who puts hand 
18 DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-2The Entropy Model and Systems of Production 19
to heart to that commitment! Imagine making the claim that my role is to deliver on 
our Zero Harm Policy. Step one: Remove all roses (and other thorny matters) from 
the site.
The original Entropy Model in PSM1 was republished by the American Society 
of Safety Professionals in 2018 in the book, Safety Leadership and Professional 
Development, “Chapter 29 – Risk Leadership: A Multidisciplinary Approach”. This 
chapter provides a more detailed description of the phases of the original model 
through a series of illustrations that didn’t appear in PSM1. In this edition, there are 
also further iterations of the model to provide different methods to which it may be 
applied.
WHAT IS ‘ENTROPIC RISK’?
‘Entropy’ was originally a term used in thermodynamics which explains the ten‑
dency of the system to move to a state of disorder or randomness. In PSM1, this was 
defined more clearly as systems degradation with these systems being inputs to the 
production process. These are the process (how the work is done), technology (plant, 
equipment etc. used to undertake the work), the physical environment (the workplace 
where the work is done) and human resources (the person/people doing the work). 
Each of these factors tends to degrade resulting in a rise in the level of risk, referred 
to as ‘Entropic Risk’. Systems shift to a state of loss of control or chaos.
Since PSM1, this concept has been widely accepted. For instance, Hollnagel 
(2021) supports the concept explaining:
The purpose of controlling a system can be seen as an attempt to reduce entropy, which 
means to reduce disorder and lack of predictability.
Further:
Waste can be seen as entropy, as in Lean. Lack of quality can be seen as entropy, as in 
statistical quality control or Kaizen. Accidents can be seen as entropy, as in Safety‑I.
(Hollnagel, 2021)
Hollnagel also discusses “anthropogenic entropy” which refers to
the increasing disorder and decreasing predictability that are due to our fragmented 
understanding of the world and hence the inadequate steps that are taken to restore order 
and the inaccuracy of the interventions that are made. In the case of socio‑ technical 
systems, the surroundings – the external forces – are themselves socio‑technical sys‑
tems. These are never stable or constant but always develop and change for better or 
worse. Anthropogenic entropy to a large extent exists because of the psychological 
reasons for fragmentation. Because we can never completely comprehend the whole 
situation, and because of the limitations in how far we can look ahead and how thor‑
ough we can be in considering alternatives, there is a need for constant adjustments and 
corrections that, because they are always approximate, become a source of entropy.
The concept of entropy has also been adopted in security management. Interestingly, 
security and OSH have many parallels including the primary objective of preventing 
losses or failures by identifying the risks, assessing those risks, and implementing 20 Productive Safety Management
adequate controls. Such sufficiency is characterised by depth of defences whereby 
multiple controls are implemented to prevent failure. A study by Coole (2010) found 
that:
within a systems approach to physical security there is a complex interrelationship 
between the built environment, physical controls, technology, people and management 
processes as they achieve the elements of Defence in Depth. Within this complex inter‑
relationship the study indicated that decay occurs at the constituent level, and if left 
undetected expands to affect the sub‑system in which it is located……
The study suggested that security decay theory is primarily concerned with manag‑
ing the natural entropic processes/pressures occurring against commissioned levels of 
effectiveness within PPS. In addition, the study indicated that in order to maintain PPS 
at their commissioned levels of effectiveness during their life cycle, they need to be 
managed in accordance with their commissioned designed specifications.
*PPS is Physical Protection System
There are two notable learnings from the study. The first is the acknowledgement 
of the tendency of systems to degrade and the level of risk rising accordingly. The 
second is the inference that there is an optimal level at which to maintain the system 
(in this case the PPS) and this is according to an agreed design. Coole and Brooks 
(2014) paper, “Do Security Systems Fail Because of Entropy?” expanded on the ear‑
lier concepts. In summary, they found:
Security is implemented to mitigate an organisation’s identified risks, linking layered 
elements into a system to provide countermeasure by the functions of deter, detect, 
delay, response and recovery. For a system to maintain its effectiveness these functions 
must be efficaciously performed in order; however, such systems may be prone to decay 
leading to security failures.
Their publication describes the emergence of entropy to many domains including 
information security, organisational systems, combat systems, communications and 
other fields. All of these discuss the degradation and disorder within a system in rela‑
tion to a system’s capacity to undertake work.
In the following section, the Entropy Model is explained which applies this con‑
cept of entropy to risk and resultant losses including production downtime, OSH and 
environmental incidents, and quality deficiencies. Many applications of entropy as 
described above can be readily absorbed at the managerial and professional levels 
where strategic and operational thinking are inherent in the language and deliver‑
ables of this type of work. But:
It’s insufficient for managers and professionals to understand the nature of 
risk. It must be understood by everyone which means that any ‘model’ must 
be explainable in terms of real‑world operations.
This is a major differentiator of the Entropy Loss Causation Model.
It readily transfers concepts to concrete applications.The Entropy Model and Systems of Production 21
THE ENTROPY MODEL: A SYSTEMS APPROACH
The Entropy Model presents two types of risk  –  residual risk and entropic risk. 
Everything humankind does has some risk associated with it. In business, energy is 
used to source product, to transform, transport and consume. The amount of energy 
involved is the inherent risk associated with the process that is being undertaken. By 
establishing controls, this inherent risk is reduced to as low as reasonably practical. 
For instance, when driving at 60 miles per hour, the energy level is still present but 
by designing and manufacturing vehicles with safety features, the residual risk is 
reduced. By design, society can lower residual risk through technological improve‑
ments, which generally occurs over the longer‑term through innovation and econo‑
mies of scale as these safety features become more affordable and standardised.
The Entropy Model is intended to be a diagrammatic rather than mathematical rep‑
resentation of the nature of risk. The left‑hand column in Figure 1.1 shows the ‘perfect 
system’ where work processes, technology, the physical environment and people are 
the inputs of the organisation. The level of risk is zero as shown by the solid line and 
perfect safety, production output and quality are achieved. This part of the model is 
the unreachable ideal. The practical reality is that a level of residual risk (shown as the 
solid block in the next column) is always present. This can’t be reduced in the short 
term due to technological, financial and resource constraints. The probability of an 
incident or loss is never zero. In hazardous industries, such as mining, oil and gas, 
transportation and manufacturing, this residual risk is relatively high compared to 
non‑energy dependent businesses, and therefore, there is always potential for losses.
The Entropy Model identifies that residual risk is inherent in the four systems of 
production that combine when a task is undertaken, and collectively, when an organ‑
isation carries out production. These systems are processes, technologies, the physi‑
cal environment and human resources. In addition, these systems degrade over time, 
sometimes gradually and at other times rapidly. This is referred to as ‘Entropic Risk’ 
which rises concurrently as systems degrade, as shown in Figure 1.2.

FIGURE 1.1 The first section of the Entropy Model22 Productive Safety Management
As a point of interest, in more recent times, a different discipline called ‘Fuzzy 
Mathematics’ developed and used Shannon’s entropy approach with the correlation 
to safety and risk exposure lending weight to entropy as a category of risk. This 
work was done independently of the Entropy Model in PSM1. These contemporary 
research studies support the concept of ‘entropy’ as a risk factor, if not a risk type, 
for instance, Larranaga (2013) refers to this concept as ‘Disaster Creep’ and states:
Many modern energy, industrial, transportation, health care, telecommunications, and 
political systems are highly vulnerable to small changes that propagate and develop 
into major disasters. This systemic tendency to unravel, decay uncontrollably, or move 
from order to disorder (e.g. disaster) is a characteristic of all natural and human‑made 
systems and is defined by Newton’s Second Law of thermodynamics as ‘entropy’. 
Before one can overcome this entropic tendency of all systems to unravel, one must 
understand the nature of system failure across multiple disciplines.
(Larranaga, 2013)
Referring to Figure  1.2, the four systems of production degrade as shown by the 
dashed downward line, and concurrently, the probability of an incident or loss to the 
organisation increases, shown by the rising entropic risk curve. The four systems can 
degrade singularly (e.g. human fatigue), concurrently (e.g. technological and physi‑
cal environment decay due to lack of maintenance) or collectively across all four at 
varying rates. This rise could have been shown as a straight line – a direct proportion 
to the rate of degradation. Instead it’s shown exponentially to illustrate the concept 
of rapid potential shift to chaos and inevitable losses, as was characterised by some 
catastrophes such as the Challenger Disaster of 1986.
As a practical example, a food processing company had an inadequately man‑
aged, paper‑based systems, aging infrastructure and equipment, poor leadership 
commitment to compliance and low operational competencies amongst supervisors

and workers. Overall, the systems were in a constant state of degradation. Chaos was 
the status‑quo and tolerated by management. Safety performance was characterised 
by a ‘revolving door’ of musculoskeletal injuries, longer‑term repetitive strains and 
incidents ordinarily associated with ‘fatal risks’ such as falls from heights and elec‑
tric shocks.
Whilst the safety‑related incidents were high so were personnel issues, 
environmental incidents, quality deficiencies, re‑work, absenteeism, 
and internal conflict.
Across all functions, the evidence of ‘entropic risk’ was tangible 
and alarming.
Many incidents caused by entropic risk result in no injuries and may, if personnel are 
in the vicinity of the failure (in the ‘line of fire’), be classified as near misses. Such 
events are a concern for safety but also other functions. For instance, production will 
be impacted by downtime, maintenance by increased reactive repairs, environmental 
management by spills and potential regulatory breaches. The model indicates that 
OSH incidents are an outcome of this escalating risk; however, these are only one 
category of loss. Other sub‑standard performances or losses can include the failure 
to consistently achieve production targets, required quality standards, reputational 
damage etc. (For the sake of simplicity, only injury, damage and production loss are 
shown in the figure.)
Figure 1.2 explains what needs to be done when escalating entropic risk is iden‑
tified due to degradation of one or more systems of production. The first action is 
to determine the degradation source/s and take corrective action to prevent further 
decline. Such action circumvents potential incidents or losses. The failure to do so 
can result in continued rise in entropic risk to a point where negative consequences 
become inevitability and potentially catastrophic.
At the strategic level, corrective actions can be responses to warning signs. These 
may relate to production, quality, safety and/or other business objective. For instance, 
threats to the supply chain may compromise one or more of these functions as many 
companies found out during COVID‑19. At the site level, safety incidents may be 
considered triggers for raised concern particularly if these lead to halts to production 
or draw the attention of the regulator. The level of response required can range from 
local issues management to crisis management depending on the overall impact to 
the organisation.
It’s important to consider evidence of entropic risk and its impact from a strategic 
perspective and to ask, ‘What’s going on in this enterprise overall?’. Does manage‑
ment have a clear understanding and control of the risks? Is there sufficient discipline 
at the site level where the organisation has its greatest operational risk exposure?
Referring again to Figure 1.2, corrective action, both strategically and operation‑
ally, is critical at any point along the degradation continuum. When companies go 
through a cycle of warning signs, quick fixes, operate as normal, warning signs, quick 
fixes, it’s often because of the failure to recognise degradation and take corrective 24 Productive Safety Management
action until the undesirable outcome becomes absolutely apparent. The most obvious 
and alarming of these conditions is when a workplace fatality or other catastrophic 
event occurs. Workplace OSH performance is usually measured using lagging indi‑
cators such as lost time injury rates, but this may be looking at safety through too 
narrow a lens.
A series of serious safety incidents should raise senior management’s 
concerns that there is loss of operational control more broadly across 
functions not just safety. That’s because entropic risk is a collective 
state of systems degradation that doesn’t just affect safety. It affects 
everything.
Chronic wariness should trigger interrogation of what’s working, what’s not working 
and a heightened precautionary approach to present and emerging risks. Questions 
to ask include: Does senior management have line‑of‑sight on operational risk man‑
agement? How is it measured? How is it reported? Most importantly, does it trigger 
the right level of corrective action based on the risks to production, safety, quality 
and other business objectives? Management should be increasingly wary of potential 
vulnerabilities, seek to understand these, and act on them with a sense of urgency. 
This is shown as the vertical line at which corrective action is taken in the model that 
prevents further entropic risk.
The Model continues to be developed in Figure 1.3. This illustrates that proactive 
maintenance practices are required in all systems of production to prevent future 
degradation. System standards are raised, as shown by the upward dashed line, 
whilst concurrently the probability of incidents and other types of failures is lowered 
to the residual risk level. This is shown by the downward solid line representing

decreasing entropic risk. Where it meets the residual risk level is the lowest point 
that can be achieved in the short‑term due to resource, financial and technological 
constraints. Organisations don’t have unlimited money to reduce residual risk and 
therefore this must be done through planned investment as part of business improve‑
ment budgeting.
The Entropy Model is readily taken from concept to practical application. It’s 
been explained to managers, supervisors, workers and in community forums open to 
small‑medium business owners through to corporate leaders. It’s easy to understand 
when framed in a practical way. For instance, a person’s hobby shed at home can be 
used to visualise how it applies. When a group of people is asked about the states of 
their sheds at home, there is invariably at least one person who confesses to having 
a mess. They give examples such as poor housekeeping – lack of orderly storage, 
disused equipment and materials and time wasted finding the right tools for the job. 
When the ‘confessor’ is asked to share a reflection on their efficiency, personal safety 
and the impact on the quality of their work, their story is often described in good 
humour and delivers a clear message about room for improvement.
When the scenario is expanded to a workplace where productivity is expected and 
success as a team depends on the standard of everyone’s inputs, it becomes evident 
that entropic risk is counter‑productive to workplace, business unit and organisa‑
tional success. People recognise the need for corrective actions but also that they 
shouldn’t accept repeated, reactive quick fixes at work as the solution. There also 
needs to be preventative systems in place to avoid recurrence (of the mess). This 
involves practices that maintain standards, which is the maintenance phase shown in 
Figure 1.3. Implementation of this phase requires the support of operational manag‑
ers and supervisors who provide the resources to improve these systems of produc‑
tion. At the most rudimentary level, there needs to be a place for everything and 
everything in its place.
The ‘system’ developed and implemented through consultation and 
participation drives the right behaviours, manages risks effectively and 
provides the opportunity to pursue production, safety, 
and quality work concurrently.
Storytelling along these lines applies to every home and workplace, across cultural 
and language barriers, with only the need for local adaptation. The principles apply 
everywhere to everyone because they reflect how life works. The first three parts of 
the Entropy Model make sense to managers and workers alike. It’s when the rest of 
the model is presented that the ‘big picture’ emerges. This has the power to transform 
behaviours and bring about positive change in a short period of time.
As an example, an exploration company had a maintenance workshop provided by 
the owners but most workers using the facility were independent tradespersons. Each 
had their own specialisation such as heavy diesel mechanics, light vehicle mechanics 
and boilermakers. As a result, the workshop had been divided into specific trades areas, 
however, there was often conflict over housekeeping in shared spaces. Frustrations 
regularly boiled over and were exacerbated when crews came back from the field and26 Productive Safety Management
dumped equipment needing repair anywhere. This created a distinct ‘them’ (the field 
crew) and ‘us’ (the service crew). Management considered this normal in this ‘tough’ 
industry and believed it would resolve itself without their intervention.
At the regular operations and safety meetings, the question was consistently 
asked, ‘What cheeses you off?’ (an Australian colloquial way of asking what can be 
improved). ‘What’s holding us back from doing our best work?’ With the collective 
desire for change evident through these open discussions, basic risk management 
workshops were held using the Entropy Model as the conversation point. The story‑
telling of the home shed was used to get each small group in the right frame of mind 
and to point out the practicalities of basic operational risk management and owner‑
ship. These were some of the changes made with management’s support:
• Each trade was given the authority to set up their work area to enable safe, 
efficient, quality work;
• One senior tradesperson (also a contractor) who worked most effectively 
with everyone was asked to be the workshop supervisor. This person 
became the ‘go‑to’ person for suggestions and further overall improvements 
that were taken to management for approval;
• The risk team (HSE and operational risk) assisted by ensuring compliances 
were in place such as emergency response equipment, signage and other 
vital support requirements for the facility as a whole;
• The field crew were given a designated laydown area for equipment that 
needed repair (which stopped the dumping in the workshop). They were 
also shown how to lodge maintenance requests using a mobile phone‑based 
operations app;
• A person was employed to undertake the daily housekeeping so that the 
tradespersons could focus on the high value work of maintaining and 
repairing plant and support equipment essential for continuity of production 
and safe operations.
The risk workshops empowered the contractors and gave them authority to make 
the changes they needed. Without further instruction or direction being given, the 
results were:
• Each area ended up with a place for everything and everything in its place;
• The work became more efficient, safer and to higher standards of output 
quality;
• Conflict was reduced significantly;
• Tradespersons were learning from each other, in fact, there was healthy 
competition about whose area was the best;
• The barriers between field crew and maintenance reduced;
• Continuous improvement became embedded in how the business worked;
• Operational discipline became self‑driven and if anyone’s standards slipped, 
the team used positive peer pressure to keep standards high.
This became their new reality of work. In the past, time was wasted looking for 
parts including nuts and bolts. Within a matter of months, the workplace was orderly, The Entropy Model and Systems of Production 27
structured and an operational system (both safe and efficient) was set up by the peo‑
ple who did the work. This fine‑tuned to the extent that trays were mounted along the 
wall that contained all the different types of screws, nuts and bolts. The trays were 
labelled with the supplier’s barcodes so that the supplier’s sales representative could 
come in, do the stock check, and organise resupply of sparing quantities. That’s effi‑
ciency and reliability in action. This is a small‑scale example but a significant one to 
that business. Even large organisations can be divided into smaller operational areas 
to enable similar outcomes. The example shows how top‑down and bottom‑up strate‑
gies can work concurrently, which is a topic of discussion in later chapters.
So far, only the first sections of the Entropy Model have been explained. It’s when 
the whole model is described that people start to understand why corrective action 
and maintenance practices are critical and why these need to be sustained. Summing 
up the discussion so far, the root cause of entropic risk is the tendency of systems 
of production to shift towards a state of chaos. Proactive maintenance is the coun‑
teraction to this chaotic effect. Corrective action is reactive whilst proactive main‑
tenance practices are a managed response to recurrent issues and known risks. Both 
are required and set the standards of performance by which an enterprise operates 
strategically and at the individual worker level. From a management perspective, 
monitoring practices and data analysis must accompany the strategy. A sustained 
wariness of potential failure is needed to trigger timely corrective action with a burn‑
ing concern for safety, efficiency and quality performance. The ‘safety’ lens alone is 
too narrow to achieve such outcomes.
‘Safety’ doesn’t exist in isolation from other business objectives, 
especially production.
If managers and supervisors when doing their walkarounds notice poor housekeep‑
ing standards, then there’s nothing to be gained by blaming the workers if the funda‑
mentals of safety and efficiency in design aren’t in place. Telling the workers to take 
corrective action to create some order won’t prevent recurrence. The key questions 
to ask are: What systems need to be in place to encourage the desired housekeeping 
standards? What changes need to be made to set a higher standard of safety, quality 
work and efficiency? Importantly, how can we best get the people who do the work 
involved in any modifications so that the change is supported and sustained?
As the model evolves, Figure 1.4 illustrates the level of risk that a company should 
be targeting. This effectively is ALARP. Degradation is prevented by reactive cor‑
rective action as needed and implementation of proactive maintenance practices 
mitigates the risk of future degradation. The company achieves optimisation when 
the risk level is brought down to the residual risk level. Accordingly, a compliance 
outcome is also achieved.
The accepted industry definition of ALARP according to the Health and Safety 
Executive (UK) is:
‘ALARP’ is short for ‘as low as reasonably practicable’. ‘SFAIRP’ is short for ‘so far as 
is reasonably practicable’. The two terms mean essentially the same thing and at their 
core is the concept of ‘reasonably practicable’; this involves weighing a risk against 
the trouble, time and money needed to control it. Thus, ALARP describes the level to 
which we expect to see workplace risks controlled.28 Productive Safety Management
Using ‘reasonably practicable’ allows us to set goals for duty‑holders, rather than 
being prescriptive. This flexibility is a great advantage. It allows duty‑holders to choose 
the method that is best for them and so it supports innovation, but it has its draw‑
backs, too. Deciding whether a risk is ALARP can be challenging because it requires 
duty‑holders and us to exercise judgment.
(Health and Safety Executive, 2024)
When considering the residual risk level in the Entropy Model, ALARP shouldn’t 
rely on lower order controls such as administration and personal protective equip‑
ment (PPE). This is because these mitigations are not robust or consistently reliable 
because they depend on human performance which is inherently fallible.
Due to entropic risk, ALARP should rely on higher order controls in the 
Hierarchy of Controls being elimination, substitution and engineering 
controls, as the lower order controls of administration 
and PPE are vulnerable to degradation.
The discussion about ALARP and its deficiencies will continue later in Chapter 3. 
Returning to the model, there’s no room for complacency in the organisation. 
Figure 1.5 provides a reminder that systems tend to degrade so if decision‑making 
and behaviours don’t sustain the focus on risk management, systems will go into 
decline again and the probability of incidents and failures will escalate.
There’s sound statistical evidence to support this cyclical nature of organisa‑
tional performance. For instance, a review was undertaken of fatalities in the state of 
Queensland in Australia from 2000 to 2019, referred to as the Brady Review.

The Brady Review found that there is a fatality cycle evident in the industry –  meaning, 
there are periods when fatalities occur, followed by periods when there are few to 
none… An explanation for this is that when a significant number of fatalities occur, 
industry tightens up safety requirements in response; however, this may then be fol‑
lowed by a drift into complacency and failure where the fatality rate increases. This can 
also be demonstrated in the fatality cycle, in the financial year of 2004–05 where there 
were four fatalities, but in the following financial year there were half the number of 
fatalities (two) and then in 2006–07 there were four fatalities. A similar cyclical pattern 
continues in the available data.

THE FOUR STEPS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
The Entropy Model has practical application to any workplace and provides clarifica‑
tion of what needs to be done to manage the risks of work. The model drives effective 
risk management to pursue safety, efficiency and quality concurrently.
Each function’s performance is an outcome not an end in isolation from 
other functions. Risk and opportunity management is the overarching 
strategy upon which all performance outcomes depend.
The model guides the behaviours of managers, supervisors and workers. The front‑
line supervisor should be the Risk Champion coaching the workforce to promote 
corrective action and proactive maintenance as an organisational discipline. These 
two steps are shown in the model in Figure 1.6. These are the first steps in the ‘Four 
Step Risk Management Strategy’, which aims to counter complacency about entropic 
risk and instil the required operational behaviours.

This is important because systems can be perceived to be so safe in some highly 
regulated, high‑risk workplaces because of the depth of risk mitigations, to the extent 
that the workforce is lulled into a false sense of security. Residual risks associated 
with energies are contained, guarded, isolated or controlled in such a way to prevent 
the worker from being ‘in the line of fire’. It’s assumed that personnel can concen‑
trate on the task at hand alert only to more minor hazards. The modern, seemingly 
well‑controlled workplace allows complacency to creep in despite residual risk. This 
is also evident within society, for instance, in relation to driving of motor vehicles. 
Whilst safety in design has improved significantly over the last 50 years, respect for 
the energies involved has diminished. This manifests as risk‑taking choices includ‑
ing intoxication, fatigue, distraction and speeding.
Complacency results from the failure to acknowledge that entropic 
risk is real.
This complacency is evident in post‑incident language; ‘you were lucky’ ‘to get out 
of harm’s way’ ‘in the nick of time’. Luck, evasion and timing are readily identified as 
‘life savers’. Steps 1 and 2, corrective action and preventative maintenance of systems 
of production, should be designed to take the luck, line of fire and bad timing out of 
the equation.
The Entropy Model shows residual risk as consistent because it can’t be reduced 
in the short‑term. Figure  1.6 provides step  3 indicating that the organisation and 
workers must remain alert. The higher the total residual risk of the four systems in 
combination, the greater the need for vigilance and operational discipline in imple‑
menting required controls. Examples include heavy vehicle road transport in hazard‑
ous conditions, remote oil and gas platforms, and underground mining operations

with difficult geotechnical conditions. These are high‑residual risk industries that 
require rigorous controls to prevent losses (including catastrophes).
The level of residual risk which is acceptable is a strategic decision driven by 
cost‑benefit analysis and availability of alternatives. The front‑end of a project where 
design, construction and commissioning decisions are made will determine the level 
of residual risk inherent during the operation’s lifecycle. The Model shows that with 
step 4, residual risk may be reduced in the longer term through technological innova‑
tion and economies of scale.
PSM1 explained in detail the Four Step Risk Management Strategy. This is a 
practical tool for both management decision‑making and individual behaviours. 
Summarising, the steps are:
1. Take immediate corrective action to eliminate entropic risk;
2. Establish maintenance strategies to prevent future entropic risk;
3. Manage residual risk in the short‑term by remaining alert and exercising 
operational discipline when implemented required controls;
4. Reduce residual risk in the longer‑term through investment, technological 
innovations, and economies of scale.
The Four Step Risk Management Strategy is a life skill that defines 
workplace practices that are much more meaningful than simply the 
instruction to comply with the management system. 
These apply at work and at home.
THE TOTAL RISK PROFILE
The two types of risk found in each of the four systems of production combine when 
work is done. As a result, a comprehensive risk profile can be developed through 
scenario development. A detailed breakdown of risks was provided in PSM1 with a 
chapter dedicated to each of the four systems. Table 1.1 provides a summary of the 
risk interfaces or sources and indicative controls. The need for a multidisciplinary 
approach is evident when looking at the detail. There are inputs from engineering 
(e.g. technological design), OSH (e.g. major hazard standards), production (e.g. site 
design and layout), human resources (e.g. values‑based recruitment), environmental 
management (e.g. site environmental studies), information technology (e.g. perfor‑
mance monitoring and big data), maintenance (planned replacements) and training 
(e.g. pre‑operational training).
Total risk profiling in this way highlights the interdependencies that exist within 
an organisation. For instance, the rate of wear and tear of truck components will 
be affected by the behaviour and competencies of the operator from the production 
department. The mechanical reliability of the truck will be affected by the behav‑
iour and competencies of the tradespersons from the maintenance department. The 
two departments are therefore responsible for preventing technology‑related entropic 
risk. For this reason and because of the complexity of potential system interfaces, a 
multi‑disciplinary approach to risk management is a must. Functional silos should be 
broken down by applying a unifying risk‑based strategy across the business.32 Productive Safety Management

Substandard work practices and a culture of complacency contribute to produc‑
tion losses, quality deficiencies and increased risk of HSE incidents. The Four Step 
Risk Management Strategy derived from the model is the socio‑technical and behav‑
ioural driver for operational discipline and a risk‑based culture.
Explaining the Entropy Model with practical examples helps personnel to 
understand why the quality of their work is critical to overall 
risk management.
THE CYCLICAL RISK OF FAILURE FOLLOWING SUCCESS
Figure 1.5 of the model showed a potential cycle of degradation, corrective action 
and maintenance, optimisation of sustainable organisational performance and the 
tendency to shift to degradation again. This can be referred to as phases of failing, 
mending, optimising and recurrent failing, which aligns to the discussion above about 
operational performance. Figure 1.1 illustrated the non‑existent, perfect world where 
risk is absent. Figure 1.2 introduced the degradation of systems of production lead‑
ing to rising entropic risk and inevitable, tangible failure if not addressed. Figure 1.3 
showed what may occur post‑incident or loss. If an organisation isn’t ordinarily pro‑
active, the enterprise having learned the hard way may react by mending ‘broken 
systems’ through maintenance practices. Where such practices become robust, the 
organisation achieves optimal safety, continuity of production and quality outputs 
in Figure 1.4. Complacency over time then results in degradation again as shown in 
Figure 1.5 and so the cycle is repeated.
Hazardous industries and those that experience production/ productivity/ sched‑
ule/ other core business pressures need a better understanding of risk than traditional 
safety accident causation models provide. The way forward is a whole‑of‑business 
approach rather than the simplistic OSH focus that defines operational risk as the 
presence of hazards. A hazard is a set of circumstances that may cause harmful 
outcomes and the probability of it doing so, coupled with the severity of the harm, is 
the risk associated with it. In the siloed OSH field, it’s the likelihood of loss evident 
as injuries that matters. This is a limited view of what constitutes loss for an organ‑
isation. In many cases, safety incidents are accompanied by other damages such as 
production downtime, indirect costs of incident investigations and harm to workforce 
morale and company reputation.
The focus should always be on ‘Good Work’ which is safe, efficient, 
and set by clear expectations regarding the quality of the output.
In the workplace, and in fact the wider community, the presence of risk isn’t consid‑
ered a cause for concern. It’s the degree of risk that matters. Similarly, the percep‑
tion of ‘safety’ also centres on the level of threat to people. What ‘safe’ means to 
most is that the risk associated with a particular activity is ‘negligible’ and to make 
something sufficiently safe means to reduce the risk to an ‘acceptable’ level (British 
Medical Association, 1987). The gap is that risk, from a strategic perspective, affects The Entropy Model and Systems of Production 35
business performance more broadly and as discussed later, there are potentially 
flawed beliefs about what’s an acceptable level of risk. Entropic risk isn’t part of 
operational risk language, but it should be.
The traditional safety‑based accident causation models summarised in PSM1
have a strong emphasis on the role of human error rather than identifying human 
resources as a system of production. Human capital should be developed more objec‑
tively using a risk‑based approach to build capacity. The question is how should HR 
residual risks be managed and HR entropic risks prevented? The revolving door 
of train and re‑train has missed the point. Personnel should have risk management 
skills that are enduring, transferrable and continually improving through experi‑
ence. Currently, having provided training after an incident to close competency 
gaps, a delusion of safety can result. Management tends to believe that once some‑
thing has been done about a hazard or people’s skills to manage the hazard, it’s now 
‘safe’ or ‘safe enough’.
The post‑incident re‑training corrective action is too often centred on relearning 
procedural controls rather than upskilling risk management competencies such as 
planning, re‑assessing conditions during task execution, effective communication, 
and reinstating the workplace to the required standard after the work is done. Where 
the tasks have been high risk, a review of what worked well and where improvements 
can be made should also be part of closing the loop to embed effective risk manage‑
ment processes and competencies. Other safety‑related models don’t explain what 
workers are practically expected to do to manage risk and this is a significant gap that 
the Four Step Risk Management Strategy closes.
Unfortunately, the perception from traditional safety models that all accidents are 
preventable if human error is eliminated is counter‑intuitive to the concept of build‑
ing organisational capacity. Archaic models have created a narrow view focused on 
negligence, for example:
Workplace accidents are caused by people. More accurately, they are caused by the 
things they do or do not do. Equipment and machinery will sometimes fail, and inci‑
dents may occur which cause accidents, but they are nearly always traceable to some 
degree of human error, negligence or ignorance.
(Robert‑Phelps, 1999)
This mindset can still be found in organisations that are low on the maturity journey. 
It encourages a blame mentality. Some managers have said, “I don’t want to go to jail 
because of some idiot!” (The ‘idiot’ being a worker.) This attitude is destructive for 
the organisation and its people, especially when Operations and OSH Managers are 
trying to build a supportive risk‑based culture. A blame approach can run concur‑
rently with a fallacious belief that having a paperwork system is compliance, rather 
than understanding use of the paperwork to capture actions and evidence those 
actions to inform further risk‑based decision‑making.
One of the major gaps in organisations whose hierarchy wants to blame the 
workers for incidents and other losses, is a lack of understanding of their 
role as managers and leaders.36 Productive Safety Management
The day‑to‑day dialogue of OSH Professionals must counter blame 
but not at the expense of accountability.
A good starting point to assist these managers and supervisors to move away from 
blame is to expose them to a systems approach driven by objective risk and oppor‑
tunity management. Within academic literature, some traction has been achieved to 
challenge the blame culture but operationally, there’s a long way to go. The shift away 
from simplistic human error as the cause of safety incidents has built momentum. For 
instance, Conklin writes that people make mistakes and errors are normal. This is 
completely true when we objectively consider our own behaviour, for instance, is 
there a driver who has never made a mistake or nearly caused a collision? The discus‑
sion is important to frankly accept the fallibility of human beings within the broader 
system. These are the fundamental principles about error currently accepted by the 
OSH profession that Conklin (2019) proposes. Firstly, error is seen as normal and 
never causal. It’s also not the opposite of success because success can occur despite 
errors. Sometimes errors lead to failure but not always. People don’t commit error 
intentionally, so error is only a result of a behavioural choice in retrospect. Human 
error can’t be removed so it must be planned for and accepted as inevitable. Good 
systems build in error tolerance. Conklin also suggests that error without serious 
repercussions should be used in leading indicator data analysis.
Human error should be recognised as a HR risk within the context of the systems 
of production. In practical terms, this has OSH, productivity and quality performance 
implications. As suggested above, good systems should build in error tolerance with 
the inference that consequences should be reduced but can’t be entirely avoided. Since 
PSM1 which focused primarily on OSH, production and quality outcomes, Hollnagel 
has recently added ‘reliability’ to the suite. There is a wider acceptance of the need 
for a multidisciplinary approach which Hollnagel called ‘Synesis’ (Hollnagel, 2021).
Here is the opportunity.
OSH Professionals, having made the transformation themselves, should be 
influencing managers and supervisors to shift their mindset from ‘safety 
based’ to ‘risk based’ thinking focused on the reliability 
of systems of production.
Reliability involves safe production delivered to expectation quality 
standards.
The narrow approach to worker behaviour (unsafe acts) and work environment (unsafe 
conditions) is redundant. This is an important step forward in both a practical and 
an ideological sense – acknowledging that no one wants to be injured at work and 
we rarely choose to or knowingly act in a dangerous manner of our own volition at 
work. ‘Unsafe acts’ are usually symptoms of systemic problems such as inadequate 
knowledge of the risks involved, work pressures, excessive physical or psychological 
demands associated with the task or conditions, or an unhealthy organisational culture.The Entropy Model and Systems of Production 37
The focus on human error is a hindrance from exploring fully the 
underlying variables that lead to losses. These are often attributable to 
inadequate or degraded organisational systems.
The role of human error in accident causation is by no means excluded from the risk 
profiling provided by the Entropy Model. All system of production including HR, have 
a residual risk due to limited capacity in terms of knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) 
and also physical constraints. No individual has complete competencies to anticipate 
and deal with every activity or to solve every potential problem that may arise in the 
workplace. As listed in Table 1.1, HR also suffer from degradation leading to rising 
entropic risk. This can affect any individual worker or group of workers, such as the 
short‑term risks of fatigue and ill‑health and in the longer‑term, the aging workforce.
PSM1 was concerned with risks associated with systems of production. In more 
recent years, organisational factors – less tangible elements of the enterprise – have 
been given attention especially as a result of the findings of many major disasters. 
Several of these have uncovered flawed decision‑making within unhealthy cultures as 
a root cause of catastrophe. The examples below include the Challenger and Columbia 
space shuttle disasters. The system failures associated with these catastrophes
were largely due to the focus on technology, lack of consideration of the social and polit‑
ical system within NASA, and inattentiveness to the consequences of organizational 
structure and policies on human behavior and safety (Vaughan, 1996; CAIB, 2003: 
Chap. 8). The [Challenger] Rogers Commission Report also identified “flawed decision 
making” as a contributing cause of the accident, in addition to other factors such as pro‑
duction and schedule pressures, and violation of internal rules and procedures to launch 
on time (Rogers et al., 1986). Ethical issues raised in the Challenger disaster involve 
engineering responsibility versus management decision‑making, as well as the ethics 
of post hoc whistleblowing and negligence in design. Vaughan (1996) characterizes the 
Challenger launch decision as a case of ‘organizational deviance’ – values and norms 
that are seen as unethical outside the organization but are seen within as normal and 
legitimate. Flawed decision‑making was a common factor in both of these accidents, 
however, the decision‑makers saw their actions as rational (Leveson, 2011). Leveson 
argues that enhancing the cultural and organizational environments and appropriate 
tools are needed to improve decision‑making under conditions of uncertainty.
The crash of two 737 MAX passenger aircraft in late 2018 and early 2019 resulted 
in the death of 347 passengers and crew. While there were significant concerns about 
Boeing’s organizational culture, flawed design choices were a key factor that led to 
these crashes. Boeing’s management placed a higher emphasis on cost reduction, prof‑
its and stock price at the expense of safety (Robinson, 2021). The Federal Aviation 
Agency (FAA) regulatory body gave ‘self‑certification’ authority to Boeing which con‑
flicted with passenger safety. Engineers were also responsible for making decisions that 
involved trade‑offs between cost and safety, however, the culture and Boeing’s man‑
agement policy on minimizing costs and adhering to a delivery schedule discouraged 
engineers to dissent. Boeing engineers and managers violated widely accepted ethical 
norms such as informed consent and the precautionary principle (Herbert et al., 2020). 
A key theme with these major incidents is the conflict over production (or its equivalent 
such as schedule) and safety.
(Van der Stap and Qureshi, 2024)38 Productive Safety Management
Incident investigations such as these point to organisational factors being root causes 
of devastating events. The author classified these factors and presented them in a 
paper at the American Society of Safety Professionals Conference in 2019. The pro‑
posed areas under ‘Organisational Capacity’ were leadership, competencies, man‑
agement systems and resourcefulness with resilience. These were contextualised 
within the Entropy Model as having both residual risks and vulnerability to degra‑
dation. This revised version of the Entropy Model will be presented in Chapter 8 to 
consider systems of production risks along with organisational factor risks.
SUMMARY
This chapter has delivered a challenge to industry’s current understanding of the 
nature of risk using the Entropy Model. The failure to recognise that systems of 
production (processes, technology, the physical environment and human resources) 
tend to degrade is a significant gap in knowledge and operational implementation 
that needs to be overcome to prevent catastrophic events but also day‑to‑day losses.
‘Entropy’ is an important concept, not only in OSH but also in other functions. 
It originally came from thermodynamics but has been more widely applied to the 
tendency of systems to shift to a state of disorder or chaos. A primary organisa‑
tional objective is to prevent disorder and maintain control to achieve objectives. The 
Entropy Model (first published in PSM1, Mol 2003) shows that as systems degrade, 
there is a resulting rising ‘entropic risk’ which causes losses in terms of safety inci‑
dents, production shortfalls, quality deficiencies and other hindrances to enterprise 
objectives.
The model includes the residual risks of systems of production. These are shown 
to be at a consistent total level in the short‑term due to the organisation’s resourcing 
constraints. This is also affected by the availability of technological solutions for 
risk reduction. Better HSE in design options don’t become accessible to enterprises 
until the costs of such innovations come down to the extent that the organisation can 
justify the outlay through cost‑benefit analysis.
In this chapter, the eight sources of risk were explained. These are the residual and 
entropic risks in each of the four systems of production. The complexity of these eight 
sources and the interfaces between them means that a multidisciplinary approach 
to risk management is required. The systems approach version of the model can be 
applied both strategically and operationally. As a learning tool, it can be readily under‑
stood by managers and workers alike using practical scenarios. This is a major step 
forward in enabling a deep insight into the nature of risk, which is currently too read‑
ily bundled into a singular, over‑simplified concept. Risk is complex and dynamic.
A systems approach is required to break down silos that exist according to func‑
tional areas in organisations. A common direction and way of work must be driven 
by effective risk management. The Four Step Risk Management Strategy from the 
model provides a framework for this to occur. Every function has a vested interest in 
loss prevention. Production departments suffer from downtime. Human Resources is 
concerned with turnover, absenteeism and poor morale. Maintenance aim to mini‑
mise breakdowns and rework. OSH aim to prevent incidents and injuries. All losses 
result from risk which is the underlying threat to functional performance.The Entropy Model and Systems of Production 39
All organisations should aim to optimise their systems of production to avoid 
losses. The model illustrated this as a phase where such systems are raised to a stan‑
dard of quality where degradation is controlled, and the risk level is brought down to 
the residual risk that can’t be reduced further in the short term. This provides indus‑
try with clarity about what constitutes effective risk management.
This is accompanied with a warning. Organisations have the potential for failure 
following success if corrective actions and maintenance practices aren’t sustained 
across the systems of production. The history of many industries shows this trend. 
Following a significant incident, efforts are heightened to regain control and invest‑
ments are made into systems improvements. With time, complacency sets in, and 
systems are allowed to degrade again, for instance, because of deep cost cutting. 
Eventually, losses start to rise such as near‑misses or production downtime. These 
may be ignored or put down to bad luck. Left uncorrected, systems degradation and 
accompanying rising entropic risk will lead to another serious incident or disaster, 
and so the cycle of failure following success is repeated.
In Chapter 2, the discussion will turn to the reasons why organisations haven’t to 
date matured towards a risk‑based approach. A major factor is areas of non‑alignment 
in current management systems that cause potential conflict between safety and pro‑
duction. Three levels of alignment will be explained to contextualise risks and oppor‑
tunities within current enterprises. Management attitudes to compliance can be a 
major stumbling block to business improvement so the discussion will cover exploit‑
ing OSH legislation to strategise for better safety, efficiency and quality outcomes 
concurrently. As an organisation matures, it should consider the benefits of attaining 
ISO accreditation or alternatively, self‑assessment including building awareness of 
the growing ESG Agenda in society.

Organisational Maturity
THE ALIGNMENT FALLACY
‘Safety First’ can’t consistently be practised at the operational level when core busi‑
ness (production, productivity, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction etc.) pressures are 
present. It could be argued that such pressure is itself, a ‘hazard’ – not of a physical 
but of a psychosocial kind. It doesn’t matter who a person is, everyone has failed to 
put ‘Safety First’ at some time when doing a task. People may consciously rush (at 
work or at home), for instance, by speeding to an appointment or by not returning to 
the garden shed to get their gloves later to be injured on a rose bush.
Organisationally, the phenomenon of ‘drift to danger’ under pressure was pre‑
sented by Rasmussen in 1997. He said that there is
systemic migration of organizational behavior towards accident under the influence of 
pressure towards cost‑effectiveness in an aggressive, competing environment
(Rasmussen, 1997)
Whether an organisation is for‑profit or service‑driven, management accountabil‑
ity for performance will, in some way or another, apply tension towards increasing 
efficiency. It’s challenging at best and more realistically, contradictory to brand the 
enterprise as a place where safety is advocated above all other functions. ‘Safety 
First’ falls into the same category as ‘Zero Harm’ – a slogan to promote an ideal. At a 
toolbox talk, the oil and gas general manager may address the workforce and ask for 
‘Safety First’ but in the next breath highlight that production is down and everyone 
needs to work harder and/or faster to get the next shipment out to the customer. In the 
health care sector, the hospital director may also talk about ‘Safety First’ in relation 
to staff safety but then talk about the decline in patient care based on patient related 
incidents or complaints. Patient safety will likely be perceived as taking precedent 
over staff safety.
‘Safety First’ is an ideal that can never consistently survive the 
operational reality of work.
In organisations there are mixed messages about safety versus production and 
this was described in PSM1 as ‘The Alignment Fallacy’. Figure 2.1 shows, on the 
left‑hand side, the presumptions about alignment where business policy, goals and 
values translate into strategic management decisions that cascade to middle‑ and 
lower‑management decisions before being implemented operationally. It’s assumed 
DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-3 4142 Productive Safety Management
that the enterprise’s goals and values and employees’ goals and values are aligned 
and that there’s no noise or disruption within this top‑down process.
Over the years, particularly in immature organisations, this approach has been 
perpetuated by a mindset that command and control is the most effective means of 
generating business performance. This hierarchical strategy fails to consider several 
issues. The first is that the higher a manager is on the corporate ladder, the further 
they are from actual control and the ‘coalface’ where the operational risks materi‑
alise. The second is the perceived need to be saying the right thing, which without 
a sound understanding of the operational challenges, can come across as rhetoric.
It’s tempting to shroud OSH performance expectations in ‘Safety First’ 
that appears to uphold high moral values, but the critical piece is whether 
operational personnel believe it in the context of their operational reality.
It’s not unusual for operations to feel a disconnection from head office. Sometimes 
board members and executives prefer not to know the harsh truths of the business 
even when cost‑effective solutions are being presented to them. If production targets 
are being achieved, how this is done, including what compromises must be made, 
can be irrelevant to those who are far removed from the shop floor. As an example, a 
meat processing company had a production line where the downstream workers had 
no control over the pace of work. As a result, raw product often fell off the conveyor 
belt onto the floor (which was a breach of quality control and food hygiene laws) 
and created hazardous conditions as workers moved around the factory. One of the 
workers incurred a serious facial injury from his own knife and quickly moved away 
from the production line holding his face in his hands. The other workers didn’t leave 
their station on the processing line to help. The incident was captured on CCTV and 
reviewed by management who adopted a ‘blame the worker’ attitude. The video and 
investigation findings were presented to the board who had insisted historically on 
branding the management system ‘Safety First’. The OSH manager pointed out the

FIGURE 2.1 The alignment fallacyThe Path to Organisational Maturity 43
sheer impossibility of actualising this culturally in an environment where production 
targets are the only priority.
‘Safety First’ is a lie when workers have no control over the pace 
of production.
Hopefully, this example is rare and at the extreme end of organisational culture. 
Ironically, businesses that are highly production‑centred, immature and risk tol‑
erant can suffer significant losses as a daily occurrence. These can include safety, 
production, quality deficiencies and personnel issues; however, the appetite of these 
businesses for change can remain tepid at best. In all organisations, material risks 
are most prevalent at the operational level. This is where the work can go well or 
very badly. ‘Safety First’ won’t resonate with frontline supervisors and workers if 
management neglect to provide a safe workplace. These are matters of significant 
non‑alignment.
There are numerous factors that contribute to the failure of policy to cleanly cas‑
cade to operations. This is illustrated in Figure 2.1, on the right‑hand side, as the 
Alignment Fallacy in Practice. The dilution starts with strategic management deci‑
sions and become more pronounced according to the disconnection between strategy 
and practice. This is particularly the case in production‑driven companies simply 
because core business is why the organisation exists in the first place. As a result, the 
tension between production (go faster and generate more) and safety is perpetuated. 
Hollnagel (2009) described this as the Efficiency Thoroughness Trade‑Off (ETTO). 
To be more efficient, attention to detail is compromised.
This tension between production and safety applies in many organisations. When 
thinking about ‘production’, the industries that come to mind tend to be oil and gas, 
mining, manufacturing, agribusiness and the like. ‘Production’ however, has an 
equivalent. The key consideration is ‘What is the source of pressure?’ For instance, 
the pressure in restaurants is time‑related to ensure customer satisfaction. In hospi‑
tals, it’s associated with ensuring the standard of patient care and in some cases, the 
safety of the patient takes precedent over that of the worker. Would a nurse allow an 
elderly person to fall to the ground so they themselves don’t end up with a manual 
handling injury? In schools, teachers prioritise the quality of teaching and student 
care. This pressure may lead to mounting stress that affects the health of the educator.
Accounting practices work against safety policy and loss prevention management 
systems more generally. There’s a financial conflict between profit and the costs of 
managing risk plus it’s impossible to account for all losses from poor risk manage‑
ment or the full benefits of effective risk management. The problem with grandiose 
labels for safety such as “Safety First” is there’s no clear limit of how safe the work 
must be to be considered safe enough to proceed. It can be a weapon for dispute 
when management and workers disagree on the level and adequacy of risk mitigation 
measures. “It must be made safer. Why? ‘Safety First’”.
Management systems can contain weaknesses in terms of non‑alignment with 
the ‘Safety First’ message. Examples include reward systems based on production 
bonuses or individual performance evaluations that are output‑focused without add‑
ing weight to managing risk for loss prevention. For instance, at a mine where the 44 Productive Safety Management
workers were undergoing risk management skills training, one of the issues that came 
up was that workers were ignoring the faulty park brakes of the four‑wheel drive 
vehicles that were taken underground. They had a pre‑start checklist to complete 
and were falsifying the condition of the park brake marking it satisfactory instead of 
honestly reporting faults. Their motivation was that the vehicles (most of which had 
this fault) would have been sent to maintenance. This downtime would have led to 
less production. They believed that targets would suffer and so would their produc‑
tion bonus payments.
The challenge with turning around this collective, non‑compliant behaviour was 
to help workers understand timeframes and consequences of risk‑taking including 
personal loss. It was also to awaken them to the goal of consistency and continuity of 
production rather than today’s production. There was an underlying distrust of man‑
agement. Workers believed that reporting wouldn’t result in change. In fact, the work‑
ers assumed that management knew of the vehicle maintenance issues and blamed 
them. When it was explained that management weren’t aware because the pre‑start 
forms said everything was satisfactory, they realised that the issues wouldn’t change 
unless they started to complete the checklists honestly.
It’s a mistake to assume that senior managers know what the issues are 
especially if they aren’t receiving truthful information from the operational 
level. Managers simply can’t dedicate resources to problems they don’t 
know about.
As shown in the right‑hand side of Figure 2.1, the site level is where the conflict 
between safety and production is most evident. This is particularly the case in the 
role of the frontline supervisor who’s concurrently responsible for safety and produc‑
tion within management systems that don’t necessarily support both roles simulta‑
neously. For example, if a shift supervisor fails to achieve production by fixing the 
safety and maintenance issues that have arisen on their shift and previous shifts, 
they’re accountable. If production is pushed to the detriment of safety and an incident 
occurs, they’re also held accountable.
The frontline supervisor faces a dilemma which is inherent in the role and not 
well supported by management in core‑business‑centric cultures. There may also be 
unspoken internal competition between production supervisors to achieve the high‑
est output targets. This may be occurring to the extent that safety and maintenance 
issues are ignored by some supervisors on their shift, later to be rectified by the 
supervisor who’s more conscientious about safety and reliability.
As explained above in the example of underground workers falsifying vehicle 
pre‑start checklists, at the operational level, employee goals and values can be 
non‑aligned with company goals and values (shown at the base of the right‑hand side 
of Figure 2.1). This is particularly the case when there’s a culture of ‘them and us’. 
Management blames the workers for underperformance of the business whilst work‑
ers blame management for not listening, not acting, and not seeking to understand 
their day‑to‑day challenges. There can be a history of false assumptions from both 
parties towards the other. This can be left unaddressed causing an undercurrent of 
covert conflict.The Path to Organisational Maturity 45
The consequences of the alignment fallacy include poor risk management, pro‑
duction centricity, poor decision‑making, lack of effective leadership and absence 
of heartfelt commitment to health, safety and wellbeing. With cultural symbols and 
management systems in place, the hierarchy can develop the illusion of control. 
Management can become attracted to this false impression of structural mass con‑
trol through uniform bureaucratic processes which then seem to make their roles as 
managers and supervisors much simpler and less messy (Tate, 2013). ‘Safety First’ is 
an example of this over‑simplification.
In theory, ‘Safety First’ consistently drives operations.
The continued occurrence of fatalities, serious injuries and debilitating 
illnesses suggests otherwise. Managers and supervisors need better 
leadership support, coaching and decision‑making tools to achieve 
safe, efficient, quality work.
Assumptions of control are also evident at the operational level. In the ASSP article 
(Grieve and Van der Stap, 2020) the cycle of failing, mending, optimising and fail‑
ing (adapted from the Entropy Model in Figure  1.5 of Chapter 1) was applied to 
individual worker performance and the influence of supervisors. This version of the 
model is presented in Figure 2.2.
Because people are inherently fallible, a low level of HR residual risk must be 
accepted within the ‘perfect system’ as shown on the left‑hand side. The never‑ending 
cycles of degradation, recovery, optimisation, degradation, recovery etc. are phases 
shown progressively in the figure. Phase 1 is the ideally designed system: a system 
without emotion, history or interpretation. Phase 2 is the initial degradation which 
begins immediately because of the gap between the worker’s knowledge, skills, and

abilities (KSAs) and those required to fit their new employer organisation. In Phase 
3, there is recovery from degradation to a period of optimisation (Phase 4) where 
individual‑organisation fit is achieved in terms of competencies to an adequate per‑
formance level. This can be followed by Phase 5 where cultural degradation may 
occur because of lack of alignment on underlying goals and values as organisational 
truths are revealed during employment.
Many people start a new job with great optimism to find with time, that 
most organisations face similar issues, such as conflict, time pressures 
and other negative aspects of the psychological contract.
After Phase 5, the cyclical nature of the process is recognised by entering Phase N. 
This pattern is due to the tendency of the People (HR) system – an input of the whole 
 system – to degrade. The decline is shown as the dashed line whilst the associated entro‑
pic risk is illustrated with the solid line that rises and falls over and above the residual 
risk level. The solutions proposed by Grieve and Van der Stap are discussed later in this 
book when supervisory strategies to prevent HR entropic risk are covered in Chapter 9.
The causes of non‑alignment between potentially conflicting objectives as well 
as corporate policy versus operational reality requires a multidisciplinary review. 
This isn’t something that an OSH professional or any single functional silo can 
address. A collective leadership strategy is required, and executive management 
must give permission to the leadership team allowing them to ask difficult questions. 
The Alignment Fallacy is an invitation to critique the contradictions that exist in 
the organisation, especially where there are potential areas of functional conflict in 
operations, such as safety versus production.
There’s no such thing as the perfect system so there will always be tension par‑
ticularly given the need for tough decisions in the face of limited resources. The 
opportunity is to understand these non‑alignment issues and to explore areas for 
improvement. The fundamental questions are:
• How can managers build credibility through better messaging about risk 
(rather than ‘beating the safety drum’)?
• What can be done differently to support the role of the frontline supervisor 
who’s responsible for safety and production concurrently?
It would be easy to point the finger of blame at the safety function. Where gaps such 
as these are found with the benefit of hindsight or the guidance of academic thought 
leaders in the OSH profession, it’s tempting to search for a logical explanation of how 
things came about. For instance, who came up with ‘Safety First’? Why did the man‑
agers at the time buy into this doctrine? Why has the OSH profession shifted from 
and between ‘Safety‑I’, ‘Safety‑II’, ‘Safety Differently’ etc? Operationally, the likely 
response to these alternative paradigms would be indifference.
‘The Work’ has always been what matters in operations, not safety 
branding, symbols, or paradigms. Operations need solutions 
not academic debate.The Path to Organisational Maturity 47
Some of the fundamental issues of non‑alignment arise before a venture even gets 
off the ground. As an example, a company was setting up a new project and had 
recruited a core team of managers. They were seated around a table for the first time 
and after introductions, the conversation shifted to how to deliver this project dif‑
ferently. A key area of discussion was the espoused culture. Each manager provided 
their thoughts as follows.
Construction Manager:
We can deliver a world‑class project efficiently, like my last project – low‑cost 
country sourcing and modularisation. It’s fast and keeps workforce numbers to a 
minimum. We don’t want any schedule issues.
Quality Manager:
Quality assurance is the key to a successful project. I’ll be ensuring our suppliers 
know what’s expected of them. There won’t be any compromise on material stan‑
dards and the quality culture will drive construction.
Environment Manager:
We have a clean slate with this project and community expectations are high 
about environmental issues. The regulators are going to be very interested in how 
we manage impacts. Our commitment and culture need to be visible to stakeholders.
OSH Manager:
My priority is to get good OSH systems in place and to build a strong safety cul‑
ture from day one. We need management’s commitment and leadership, especially 
during construction when our site risks will be high.
Each manager put forward their own functional priorities advocating a 
discipline‑based culture. Who was right? Who would ‘triumph’? Would 
schedule pressure during construction make these words meaningless?
The example highlights that silos are currently inherent in how organisations work. 
The interdependencies and interfaces based on risk and opportunity haven’t broken 
this mould and little progress has been made towards common drivers, despite some 
obvious synergies. For instance, when PSM1 was published in 2003, OSH and HRM 
were distinctly different functions. In 2024, the overlaps are unquestionably accepted 
as including training and development, leadership, culture, capacity building, resil‑
ience and other human performance programmes.
From a practical perspective, the synergies between OSH and operational risk 
management are strong but unfortunately, in many companies under exploited. As a 
result, there’s operational work and safety work as two distinct elements of the job; 
the safety paperwork needs to be done before the job can start. Recent literature 
includes some pieces on the integration of operational management with OSH (Hasle 
et al., 2021) who state:
Increasingly, large and medium‑sized enterprises rely on joint management systems to 
align safety and health processes with operational issues such as productivity, quality, 
and environmental management … The decoupling of OSH management and opera‑
tions management has for many years been conceptualised from the OSH perspective 
as the ‘sidecar’ problem … where OSH management is a separate activity, organised 
in its own logic.48 Productive Safety Management
The issues are known but the literature is lacking in terms of delivering the know‑how 
to integrate OSH and operations. This is a key challenge progressively addressed in 
this book. The starting point is to better understand the context of the organisation 
and the issues that affect all functional areas, regardless of whether the enterprise is 
a large corporation or an SME.
THE THREE LEVELS OF ALIGNMENT
In PSM1, it was explained that the organisation doesn’t exist in isolation from the 
outside world. For it to succeed and endure, it must create fit with its environment and 
adapt when changes occur, effectively maintaining ‘external alignment’. This con‑
cept was not entirely new in 2003 when PSM1 was published. The basic principles 
could be found in books about strategic management. A key theme throughout is, 
“Why is external alignment important?”
Most large corporations understand why and many of the requirements are embed‑
ded in corporation law and accountabilities to shareholders and other stakeholders. 
For the SME owner or manager, this discussion may seem remote and perhaps mute 
in relation to day‑to‑day operations, but change is inevitable and affects everyone, 
particularly in the Western and Developing Worlds. For instance, the impact of tech‑
nological changes requires responsiveness to maintain relevance in an increasingly 
competitive and aggressive marketplace. SMEs (not just big corporations) benefit 
from lean, operationally driven, risk‑based management systems. In some ways, 
SMEs have advantages over larger organisations in their ability to make changes 
quickly and seamlessly with production. In fact, those companies that elect to have 
their systems tested through International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
accreditation, may gain a competitive advantage when bidding for contracts. They 
may also improve the businesses’ reputations with clients and community.
For this reason, the Strategic Alignment Channel from PSM1 is reintroduced in 
this edition. It’s shown in Figure 2.3 and applied using practical examples for various 
sized businesses. The term ‘channel’ is used to imply unobstructed flow through the 
enterprise where it adapts to upstream risks and opportunities from external sources. 
For instance, most organisations were required by law and necessity to adapt to 
COVID‑19 restrictions mandated by relevant regulators.
The governing and influencing forces shown in the figure in the left‑hand column 
include changes in legislation, technological innovations and other dynamics. As a 
further example, the full impact of climate change strategy is yet to cascade to SMEs 
and households but the likelihood of expanding requirements in almost guaranteed. 
Impacts are already being identified as described on the World Economic Forum 
website (World Economic Forum, 2022).
Looking at the figure, the ‘flow’ extends to operations because they have upstream 
risks and opportunities from the strategic level of the organisation. Internally, these 
may include an organisational restructure, introduction of new goods or services, 
or increased accountability of sites to head office requirements. For instance, OSH 
Corporate may develop standards for the prevention of fatalities and serious injuries, 
for operational implementation. These are often referred to as ‘fatal risk controls’ or 
‘major hazard standards’ (examples can be found on the internet). In mining opera‑
tions for example, there are often common causes of deaths and injuries including: The Path to Organisational Maturity 49
vehicles, surface, and underground mobile plant operations; unstable ground condi‑
tions; hazardous and molten materials; moving equipment parts; exposure to ener‑
gised sources; and falls from heights. Operations managers and supervisors should 
be involved in determining the critical controls required to prevent fatalities in their 
workplaces and the programme for monitoring effectiveness. On face value, SMEs 
may feel that these ‘fatal risk controls’ don’t apply to them, but many of the same 
inherent dangers are found in SMEs as in large organisations.
There’s a universal suite of energies and conditions that can result in 
workplace deaths. Not all will apply in every workplace, but no business 
is exempt from fatality potential.
A safe work environment is an entitlement and recognised as such in Figure 2.3 under 
‘Employees’ Goals and Values’ in the right‑hand column. Other employee goals and val‑
ues may vary between countries or industries, but the basic common needs of workers 
are listed as shown ‑ a safe work environment, rewards for achievement, autonomy/group 
(societal culture specific), positive organisational culture and enhanced employability.
The key elements of the Channel are:
• External environmental forces drive business strategy which then cascaded 
to strategic management systems and onto operational systems, practices 
and behaviours;
• When business strategy aligns to the external environment, ‘external stra‑
tegic alignment’ is achieved, which assists the enterprise to remain relevant 
and meet its organisational goals and values, such as profit, customer satis‑
faction etc as listed;

FIGURE 2.3 The strategic alignment channel50 Productive Safety Management
• Internal strategic alignment centres on balancing human, physical and 
financial capital to support core business and the support services required 
internally to deliver required outcomes;
• Internal goal alignment requires that operational systems, practices and 
behaviours embed alignment of organisational goals and values with those 
of the employees, which is necessary for retention and return on human 
capital investment;
• There are interdependencies and a feedback loop between the external envi‑
ronment and employees because of social values, which don’t remain static, 
each influencing the other over time.
Practical examples are helpful to explain these concepts. In 1998, the International 
Labour Organization made a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work which were amended in 2022. This included everyone’s (globally) entitlement 
to a safe and healthy working environment (International Labour Organization, 
2022). In the Western World, OSH legislation has been improved significantly since 
the 1990s to ensure that statutes are written in such a way that new and emerging 
risks are captured through ‘enabling’ legislation. In simple terms, ‘enabling’ means 
the employer has a ‘duty of care’ to workers for their health and safety. Recently in 
Australia the definitions of ‘employer’ and ‘worker’ have been expanded to capture 
more circumstances where a person is working regardless of whether they’re paid.
Such a significant change in global social values has translated to local OSH leg‑
islation to which no enterprise is exempt. Any business owner who elects to ignore 
these requirements is essentially accepting a substantial business and personal risk 
(due to penalties that apply to enterprise ‘officers’) should they fail to fulfil their duty. 
This example shows the connection between the ’big picture’ (global level) to the 
‘small picture’ (local level where an SME employs a few workers).
This isn’t scaremongering but a reality check on the dynamic nature of risk and 
opportunity within the business world. In fact it would be safe to say that when 
the original channel model was presented in PSM1 in 2003, the gap between the 
‘External Environment’ and SME strategies was chasmic. Today however, because 
of the worldwide web and availability of information, that gap has narrowed signifi‑
cantly. Other policy issues such as climate change, the gig economy and workplace 
psychosocial health and wellbeing are rapidly gaining momentum. For instance, 
small businesses that are suppliers to some major Australian mining companies are 
required to submit a declaration of compliance to that company’s modern slavery 
policy, to remain preferred suppliers. Can a small business owner in Australia be 
certain that there was no child labour used in the manufacturing of the personal 
protective equipment they provide to their personnel, when such products are made 
in Asia? Matters such as these present a real dilemma for SME owners and managers 
as client expectations increase into realms over which these owners and managers 
have no control. What are they to do – sign the declaration or risk losing a customer?
Importantly, regardless of organisational size, external environment factors 
don’t affect a single function such as OSH management or production. This 
overarching ‘umbrella’ of risk and opportunity filters through to most 
if not all functions.The Path to Organisational Maturity 51
The following is another practical example taken from the COVID‑19 pandemic. 
Prior to the COVID‑19 outbreak in 2019, many organisations had a crisis manage‑
ment plan within which ‘pandemic’ was a small section – included mostly because it 
was felt by managers that it should be because it was industry practice. The scope of 
this was perceived to be mostly associated with sustaining workforce levels in case 
of an influenza outbreak. During the COVID‑19 pandemic, because of directives of 
various government health departments, regulatory bodies and / or corporate head 
office instruction, some organisations undertook risk assessments and implemented 
response plans. The complexity of these plans was highly dependent on the nature of 
the industry and external factors such as that industry’s supply chain.
For instance, in an agribusiness that has pork production as core business, the risk 
assessment can be complex and wide reaching. A narrowly focused OSH risk assess‑
ment based on workforce health would be grossly inadequate. The risk assessment 
method would require review of inputs, processes, and outputs. For example, the 
following inputs would be critical. For a given farming capacity of 30,000 pigs, pro‑
duction doesn’t cease, and thousands of pigs are sent to the abattoirs every week that 
are soon replaced by the planned next generation. If pigs can’t be sent to the abattoir, 
there’s no spare capacity to sustain them on the farms. Pigs can’t be released into a 
paddock and kept there until the pandemic is under better control because they’re not 
herd animals and adopt cannibalism behaviours.
Critical process issues could include how soon to start slaughtering animals and 
disposing of carcasses; the health and environmental issues associated with burial to 
landfill; availability of suitable landfill sites given travel restrictions associated with 
the pandemic; the response from the public and from animal rights activists, and how 
this should be managed.
In the event of a case of COVID‑19 at an abattoir, the logistical challenges begin. 
This includes how to stop or divert trucks full of pigs already on the way to the 
abattoir; how to dispose of production output that is already being processed (meat, 
carcasses and waste) and then undertake a deep clean of the facility; how to manage 
personnel who often socialise outside work; how to plan return to work scheduled 
for future normal operations; and recovery of stock number at the piggeries given the 
need for strictly planned fertilisation, gestation and growth durations.
Output issues could include abattoir waste disposal at downstream rendering 
plants; what to do with waste if the rendering plant also must be closed; where to send 
the waste and how to dispose of it without creating environmental impact or com‑
munity nuisance; and the need to meet customer contracts and consumer demand. 
Other concerns include disruption to food supplies and preventing panic buying by 
the public.
Examples such as this highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to risk 
management. If the assessment method solely looks at functional areas, for instance, 
only the production line or worker health and safety or quality, the major issues won’t 
be identified. External threats can create complex, inter‑related interfaces within the 
organisation and often solutions need to involve external stakeholders such as regula‑
tors, government, contractors and customers.
The value of the Channel is to clearly map and understand internal processes, 
external influencing forces and stakeholder needs, within the context of normal 
operations. This means not waiting for crisis conditions to prompt such analysis. 52 Productive Safety Management
This also means building relationships with stakeholders as a strategic response to 
the dynamic environment that defines the context of the organisation.
INTEGRATING ISO STANDARDS
The Channel illustrates the overarching framework for an integrated management 
system – one, for instance, in which operations and OSH can be seamless. It should 
be noted, that where legislation states that the organisation must have a ‘safety man‑
agement system’ (SMS), there’s nothing to prevent the business from integrating 
SMS requirements into their operational plans, procedures, and work instructions. 
The SMS doesn’t have to be a separate, standalone system. The key is to under‑
stand what OSH legislation has prescribed (the must‑do’s). Taking this further, when 
‘safety issues’ arise, these can be resolved by also considering efficiency gains. For 
instance:
Plant not in use
The person with management or control of plant at a workplace must ensure, so far 
as is reasonably practicable, that plant that is not in use is left in a state that does not 
create a risk to the health or safety of any person.
(Government of Western Australia, 2022)
To meet this legislation, compliance may be as straightforward as ensuring that keys 
aren’t left in the forklift when not in use. Keys should be returned to the workshop 
office and kept there. The efficiency gain is that when the forklift operators need to 
use a forklift, all the keys are in a known place, not left on a bench or in someone’s 
pocket. The instruction can be part of the operations checklist rather than a separate 
safety instruction. Although this is a very basic example, it’s surprising how much 
time is wasted in workplaces simply because there isn’t ‘A place for everything and 
everything in its place’.
One of the benefits of attaining ISO accreditation is that understanding legislative 
requirements is a mandatory element. Other requirements that lead to a structured, 
systematic approach to the work include having: an applicable policy; clear roles 
and responsibilities; processes for participation and consultation with workers; plan‑
ning for risks and opportunities; clear objectives; adequate resourcing; competency 
and awareness development; processes for communication; control of documented 
information; operational control across multiple risk areas; internal monitoring; 
management review and continual improvement (International Organization for 
Standardization, 2024). These are areas which have commonality with operations.
A systematic approach can be achieved by adopting ISO Standards or by exploit‑
ing synergies across different functional areas as explained by the International 
Organization for Standardization (2024). For instance, loss prevention applies to 
multiple departmental areas such as production (downtime), OSH (fatalities, inju‑
ries, illnesses, near‑misses), quality (deficiencies, non‑conformances), maintenance 
(defects, rework) and human resources (absenteeism, turnover, grievances).
Loss prevention across these functions may be supported by a database of losses, 
incidents or undesirable events that enables investigation, identification of corrective The Path to Organisational Maturity 53
and preventative actions, and tracking of these actions to close‑out. Many off‑the‑shelf 
databases can be used to generate reports to inform managers of performance. Data 
may be dissected, for instance, by functions, operation, region or other criteria. A 
single online platform may be used to not only capture this lagging information 
(post‑loss/event) but also schedule proactive monitoring processes. It’s particularly 
important to provide assurance to the executive, boards and company officers, who 
are increasingly subject to scrutiny when companies incur losses that become public 
knowledge. The news regularly covers such events, for instance, breaches of statutory 
requirements resulting from workplace fatalities, environmental incidents that cause 
significant harm, or product quality failures that affect consumer safety.
Accreditation to one or more ISO Standards is one means by which organisations 
can improve their performance including in loss prevention. ISO was founded on a 
fundamental question about the best way of doing something. Some of the most com‑
monly applied standards in industry include ISO 31000 – Risk Management; ISO 
9001 – Quality Management; ISO 14001 – Environmental Management; and ISO 
45001 – Occupational Health and Safety.
The latest versions of these standards require the organisation to define its context. 
The Channel assists with this by defining external forces generically. The greater the 
complexity of the environment of the enterprise, the more compelling the need to 
define context which often involves stakeholder analysis. These can include regula‑
tors, local communities, suppliers, contractors, strategic alliance partners and others 
impacted by the operations of the enterprise. Labour markets, union bodies and out‑
sourcing suppliers may also be important.
Companies should recognise their own workforce as stakeholders. The analy‑
sis entails not only identifying these interested parties but also their needs along 
with the organisation’s obligations to them, from a risk (and opportunity) perspec‑
tive. For instance, “ISO 9001:2015 Quality management system  –  requirements” 
(International Organization for Standardization, 2015) contains Section 4 “Context 
of the organization” which covers determining external and internal matters that 
affect purpose, strategy and results; understanding the needs and expectations of 
stakeholders (who are referred to as ‘interested parties’); deciding on the scope of the 
quality management system (QMS) and how the above two points will be considered; 
and establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving the QMS.
The above points are monitored and reviewed to assess performance and pur‑
sue continual improvement. To achieve accreditation to the standard, the organisa‑
tion must have documented evidence of these processes and the associated outputs, 
for example a Stakeholder Needs Analysis. The business’ QMS is reviewed by an 
external auditor and if the mandatory requirements are met to an acceptable level, 
accreditation is awarded. The enterprise is allowed to display their certificate, for 
instance, on its website so that clients and other stakeholders are made aware of this 
achievement. Some organisations see this as part of their competitive advantage, or 
at least a differentiator from unaccredited competitors.
ISO Standards set the expectation that managers will understand their organ‑
isation beyond the footprint of their operations. This external focus is aligned 
concurrently to internal management, resourcing and control requirements. The 
International Organization for Standardization explains the purpose and importance 54 Productive Safety Management
of each of its standards on its website, for instance: ISO 9001:2015‑ Quality manage‑
ment systems  —  Requirements; ISO 45001:2018‑ Occupational health and safety 
management systems – Requirements with guidance for use; and ISO 14001:2015‑ 
Environmental management systems  –  Requirements with guidance for use. The 
growth of ISO accreditation across various industries, countries, and regions is evi‑
dent on the internet.
A practical caution, however, is needed. Just because an organisation has accredi‑
tation to a standard, that’s not a guarantee against incidents or undesirable events 
(losses) related to that standard. It means that they have processes in place to man‑
age the risk of those losses occurring, to recover and return to normal operations, to 
investigate and act for prevention, and to pursue continual improvement. The stan‑
dards don’t describe how the organisation will establish these processes only that 
they must have something in place. The efficacy of those processes is a matter for the 
organisation’s leaders to address, not necessarily for the auditor to advise on.
AN ALTERNATIVE TO ACCREDITATION
Using the Channel as a self‑assessment tool provides the organisation an alterna‑
tive to the significant commitment associated with accreditation to external stan‑
dards. It can enable the organisation to better understand itself and to prepare for 
external changes. Over the last 20 years, there have been transformational changes 
that impact the local level of the enterprise. The internet has provided workers and 
the public with greater access to information, and this has considerably influenced 
many of society’s goals and values. The original Channel from PSM1 included the 
two‑way arrow at the bottom of the diagram between employees’ goals and val‑
ues and external environment forces. The interdependencies and feedback process 
between these two sources has strengthened, reinforced by the powers of social 
media. In previous years, if a fatality occurred at a workplace, it may eventually 
make a page in the newspaper. Now, it may be broadcast via social media within 
the hour. This has bolstered the necessity for risk management for many organisa‑
tions, including SMEs. It also highlights the need to align workers’ and the organ‑
isation’s goals and values.
Today’s managers should understand their organisation’s risk exposure holisti‑
cally, both as a technical system and social system. The singular concept of align‑
ment doesn’t work for operations because of organisational factors with sociological 
roots. Issues arise regularly at the operational level that are evidence of conflict over 
objectives and targets. A supervisor may want to keep a truck with worn tyres operat‑
ing until the end of the shift to achieve more production, but the driver might not be 
comfortable with this decision for safety reasons. There are many examples which 
result from the inherent tension between what is safe enough and what isn’t. Often 
the difference is due to perception rather than a clear understanding of energies and 
the adequacy of controls.
Overt and covert conflicts of this nature have a flow‑on effect to the organisa‑
tional culture. The same applies when companies ask for employee input but fail to 
follow‑up on requests or to provide a reasonable explanation for why something can’t 
be implemented. Alignment can fail when there’s no or an inadequate feedback loop.The Path to Organisational Maturity 55
Even if OSH initiatives have the support of senior management, 
implementation can stumble at the lower management decision‑making 
level. This is where a risk‑based approach is most needed, not just for 
decision‑making but also for risk‑based communication.
(Solutions for these non‑alignment challenges will be provided in Chapters 8 and 9.)
Conflicts at the operational level can lead to industrial disputes and legal action. 
This too is on the rise as society shifts increasingly to a litigation mindset and 
individuals are more aware of their rights. PSM1 included the case of Collins and 
AMWU v. Rexam Australia Pty Ltd. (Industrial Relations Commission of Australia, 
1996) as an example. Collins was a diabetic, which his employer knew prior to his 
employment. He had been hired on a 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. shift and he was able to 
manage his treatment regime around these times. When the company changed the 
shift in 1992/1993 to 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Collins was asked to work this roster 
along with other employees. He declined to do so because it wouldn’t suit his treat‑
ment programme. The company accepted this at the time after receiving a letter from 
the employee’s doctor.
In 1995, the company changed its position and required Collins to work the new 
shift system. Following numerous warnings and correspondence because of his 
refusal, Collins’ employment was terminated. The court found that the business had 
acted unfairly in dismissing him and had contravened S170DE (1) of the Industrial 
Relations Act 1988 (Australia) and awarded him with damages accordingly. The case 
showed that employers can’t assume that employees will accept company practices 
where their needs are incompatible with them. Examples such as this, have increas‑
ingly become an organisational issue. Employers have OSH duties for both the physi‑
cal and psychological health of workers because of recent legislative changes in some 
jurisdictions.
Few managers have the courage to undertake root cause analysis into 
decision‑making processes to uncover underlying deficiencies within the 
management system, culture and/or leadership that could affect workers’ 
psychological health.
Matters such as these have become more significant risks to businesses, including 
SMEs, due to the growth in access to knowledge. This has been accompanied by 
awareness that knowledge is power. In essence, the needs and expectations of the 
workforce have matured well beyond the employment/engagement contract. The 
psychological contract, whilst emerging in the early 1960s, has become paramount 
in the field of human resource management. This ‘contract’ refers to ‘individuals’ 
expectations, beliefs, ambitions and obligations, as perceived by the employee and 
the worker’ (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 2023). It’s mostly 
been studied from the perspective of the employee, and it matters because it heavily 
influences day‑to‑day behaviour of employees. Whilst it’s predominantly an area of 
focus in HR management, the overlaps with production, OSH and quality are evident 
in the advice of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD):56 Productive Safety Management
Managers need to remember:
• Employment relationships may break down despite management’s best 
efforts. Nevertheless, it’s the managers’ job to take responsibility for build‑
ing and maintaining them.
• Preventing breach in the first place is better than trying to repair the damage 
afterwards. Trust is key to the relationship.
• Where breach cannot be avoided, it may be better to spend time negotiating 
or renegotiating the deal, rather than focusing too much on delivery.
• Interventions aimed at building resilience skills can help individuals cope 
better with psychological contract breaches.
(Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 2023)
The messaging clearly points to the critical role of the line manager in understanding 
and managing expectations of fairness. Where does this leave the supervisor when 
they override a worker’s concerns about a safety or maintenance issue, such as worn 
tyres on the truck, to continue production for the remainder of the shift? The need 
for internal goal alignment, as shown in the right‑hand side of the Channel, is greater 
now than when the Channel was developed 20 years ago. The question is how to 
make this happen. A decision‑making tool is needed to consistently ensure that safety 
and production goals are balanced using a risk‑based approach. The ‘Reasonableness 
Test’ (from PSM1) will be included in Chapter 8 of this second edition. Application 
of the test will assist line managers to justify operational decisions and set a standard 
for safety performance and production targets concurrently.
Risk‑based decision‑making must be at the core of transformation of 
management systems from silos to full integration.
For this to happen:
Traditional paradigms of ‘safety’ need to be challenged. The mindset change from 
‘safety’ to ‘risk management’ is already underway and gaining momentum with the 
recognition that a multi‑disciplinary approach to risk management is required. The 
opportunity is to apply this holistically to achieve production/productivity, work qual‑
ity and HSE incident mitigation concurrently. A significant value‑add is to continue the 
organizational and professional maturity journey with the people the EHS management 
system is designed to protect in the first place – frontline supervisors and workers. The 
challenge for business is how to tap into the depth of knowledge that exists at all levels 
of the organizational hierarchy and to gather the data to make well‑informed risk‑based 
decisions at both strategic and operational levels.
(Van der Stap, 2018)
LEARNING FROM THE ESG AGENDA
The discussions so far have highlighted weaknesses in current management systems 
that hinder production, safety and quality performance being pursued concurrently. 
Whilst described as ‘gaps’, these can be reframed as ‘opportunities for improve‑
ment’ or simply, progress in the right direction. The practical tools to sustain this The Path to Organisational Maturity 57
transition towards a risk‑based approach will continue to be presented in this book. 
These are:
• The Entropy Model explains the nature of risk and how residual and entro‑
pic risks affect multiple business functions, especially at the operational 
level. The model is a tool to manage risk more effectively, to drive a mul‑
tidisciplinary strategic approach to risk management and to explain the 
importance of everyone’s behaviours;
• The Alignment Fallacy explained that OSH policy doesn’t cascade to 
‘Safety First’ as a consistent, operational reality because of disruptions and 
conflicts down the hierarchy resulting from decisions that don’t have a clear, 
consistent risk‑basis;
• The Strategic Alignment Channel illustrated the need to align the enterprise 
with its external environment, which is changing dynamically and requires 
adaptability. Internally, resources must be balanced to achieve internal stra‑
tegic alignment. The key consideration to attain internal goal alignment is 
creating a fit between enterprise and employee goals and values to sustain 
the psychological contract. There’s a feedback loop to and from the exter‑
nal environment and the workforce suggesting that the organisation must be 
flexible to social changes and not focus singularly on being a technical entity.
Enterprise executives and senior managers need to be cognisant of this feedback 
loop along with the governing and influencing factors in the external environment. 
A significant growth area currently underway is the inclusion of the ESG Agenda in 
corporate reporting. The internet can be searched for an explanation of ESG includ‑
ing the history of development, the drivers behind the movement and how it’s actu‑
alised in business. Much of the impetus has come from investors who have swayed 
towards corporations that take ESG seriously. Like the other matters discussed so far, 
ESG has a risk and opportunity basis that affects all functional areas of an enterprise, 
particularly those connected to the value chain.
The SME owner or manager may wonder what ESG has to do with them and the 
operation of their business. The answer is that such socially and commercially driven 
changes have momentum. Continual improvement is a clear expectation that will 
affect future supply chains. Earlier, the example was given of small businesses being 
required to sign a declaration binding to and assuring that they are compliant to the 
client’s modern slavery policy.
High‑level ESG commitments made by corporations will likely cascade 
to their suppliers, regardless of those suppliers’ size or ability to meet 
expectations. The issue isn’t can or will suppliers comply. 
It’s will they be ready.
For instance, how will an SME demonstrate X percentage reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions? How will they develop and implement programmes for the mental 
health of their workers (currently enshrined in law in some countries)? How will they 58 Productive Safety Management
demonstrate best practice in hiring and onboarding to achieve safe, efficient, envi‑
ronmentally responsible production? It’s not that these outcomes can’t be achieved. 
The issue is readiness. Right now, functional silos and gaps in risk and opportunity 
management are holding organisations back.
THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
One of the major learnings from the COVID‑19 pandemic was that no single business 
function had all the answers to the risks it presented. The impact was felt through 
the whole cycle of inputs, processes, and outputs from supply chain to internal opera‑
tions through to the customer/client. The opportunity since the COVID‑19 pandem‑
ic’s major impact is to reframe what was learned from a risk management perspective 
and put a new lens on operational practices.
Another outcome of COVID‑19 was that governments, corporations, SME owners 
and managers, and professionals with all different backgrounds that were supposed to 
have a sound risk basis (e.g. OSH, logistics and procurement), learned how much they 
didn’t know. Most organisations would have been described as having a ‘knowing 
culture’ – “We know our business. We know what we’re doing. We know our value”. 
To the contrary, most organisations were thrown onto a sharp learning curve. It would 
be unwise to put this experience into the CEO’s bottom drawer on the assumption that 
it won’t happen again. In fact, it might be interesting to know how many organisations 
ran lessons learned workshops after COVID‑19 to take away actions that better pre‑
pare them for the future. Opportunities such as these shouldn’t be lost.
Commentary about this transformation was already taking place prior to 
COVID‑19. According to McKinsey (2016), the challenge with moving from a know‑
ing culture that relies on simple, efficient rules for making decisions (heuristics) to a 
learning culture isn’t about the cost. It’s about being more objective and data‑driven. 
This requires imagination and inertia. The implication is that something needs to 
generate this approach.
The emergence of Resilience Engineering pointed to needed change:
The term Resilience Engineering is used to represent a new way of thinking about 
safety. Whereas conventional risk management approaches are based on hindsight 
and emphasise error tabulation and calculation of failure probabilities, Resilience 
Engineering looks for ways to enhance the ability at all levels of organizations to cre‑
ate processes that are robust yet flexible, to monitor and revise risk models, and to use 
resources proactively in the face of disruptions or ongoing production and economic 
pressures.
(Resilience Engineering Association, 2017) (Olewoyin & Hill, 2018)
As the discussion continues in the following chapters, the need for a different 
approach to risk management which is more holistic, pragmatic, opportunistic and 
that involves multiple disciplines will emerge.The Path to Organisational Maturity 59
SUMMARY
This chapter has considered the organisation from a sociological perspective in the 
context of the dynamics which occur in the external environment as well as inter‑
nally. The ‘Alignment Fallacy’ was explained to provide understanding of why safety 
policy doesn’t readily cascade to an operational reality, especially when such policy 
is founded on safety branding such as ‘Safety First’ or ‘Zero Harm’.
One of the key issues associated with non‑alignment of policy with how the work 
is done is the dilemma faced by frontline managers and supervisors who are respon‑
sible for safety performance and production targets in assigned work areas. To add 
to this, there are gaps in how supervisors develop relationships with new incumbent 
workers which involve inadequate consideration of the entropic risks (degradation) 
that occurs during onboarding and that dents the psychological contract. (This issue 
will be discussed further in Chapter 8 where the focus will be on the development of 
a risk‑based culture and risk leadership competencies.)
In PSM1, a second tool accompanied the Entropy Model. This was the ‘Strategic 
Alignment Channel’  –  a tool to assist business managers to better understand 
the context of their organisation in relation to the external environment, resourc‑
ing decisions and alignment with employees’ goals and values. The Channel was 
designed to assist with management of change because it instils an awareness of 
governing and influencing factors beyond the operational footprint. The Channel 
is also helpful in analysing an enterprise as having inputs, processes, and outputs, 
as well as important internal and external relationships. This directs risk assess‑
ment more effectively with multiple functions (production, OSH, quality, procure‑
ment etc) focused on responding to major changes or events affecting the enterprise. 
Separate discipline‑based risk assessments aren’t effective in times of significant 
changes or threats.
Attaining ISO accreditation is another means of adopting this outward view of the 
organisation. One of the key requirements is to define the context of the enterprise 
and identify important stakeholders, their needs and the organisation’s responsibil‑
ity to them. Using the Channel is an alternative for pursuing improvements, espe‑
cially for SMEs or larger organisations with scarce resources. With this outward 
and forward‑looking mindset, the discussion segued to the emergence of the ESG 
Agenda as a growing trend that will cascade to organisations via changes in gov‑
ernment policy, the behaviours of corporations, and community expectations. The 
key message was that a risk and opportunity approach is required to prepare for 
changes that are likely to impact all organisations in the Western and Developing 
Worlds. During COVID‑19, businesses found that having a siloed, function‑based 
response was limiting and instead, a multidisciplinary approach to risk and opportu‑
nity management was required to survive the pandemic. Current trends, such as cli‑
mate change, the gig economy, technological innovations, including digital highways 
and artificial intelligence, health crises and other current and emerging issues, are 
driving a new paradigm of business.60 Productive Safety Management
A ‘perfect storm’ of developments increasingly requires that companies articulate and 
operationalize a corporate purpose that accounts for the impacts of their business on 
society and the environment.
(The Enacting Purpose Initiative, 2023)
This chapter has set the foundations for the enterprise being a sociological, not sim‑
ply technological entity. This will be particularly important for Chapters 8–10 which 
discuss leadership, organisational capacity development, and the opportunities pre‑
sented by the principles of high‑reliability organisations, respectively. The discus‑
sions aren’t intended to create grand strategies for organisations to move towards the 
lofty standards of the world’s best corporations. It’s more about optimising resources, 
both technical and behavioural, of enterprises to achieve much more from what they 
have – a pragmatic approach. A key theme throughout Chapters 1 and 2 has been 
operational reality and the need to displace delusional concepts such as zero harm, 
zero risk, the perfect leadership style and management systems that look fantastic on 
paper.
The following chapters will become more technically focused and explore in 
greater detail, the residual and entropic risks associated with systems of production. 
This will be done in Chapters 3–6. In Chapter 7, an alternative semi‑quantification 
risk assessment method will be proposed to better understand the complexity, dyna‑
mism and numerous interfaces of risk as these occur in the workplace.

THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SYSTEMS OF PRODUCTION
Work activities involve the interaction of human resources, technologies and the 
physical environment through processes. Processes are the interface between other 
systems of production. In practice, these can be divided into four main categories 
which are: systems processes; operational process designs or work practices; risk 
management practices; and post‑incident practices.
The high‑level processes that are usually proceduralised are those explaining 
how the system works within a functional area. For instance, OSH management sys‑
tems tend to have overarching procedures for risk management, communication of 
risk, auditing, monitoring and inspection regimes, performance management etc. In 
Chapter 2, ISO accreditation was discussed. Historically, ISO Standards referred to 
having a procedure for selected mandatory elements such as internal auditing. The 
more recent versions refer to having a ‘process’. Unsurprisingly, the easiest way to 
demonstrate having a process is to develop and implement a procedure, which is what 
the auditor will likely use to assess internal compliance.
The area of current contention in the OSH profession is the bureaucratisation of 
safety. The key issue is the disconnection between procedures written according to 
‘Work as Imagined’ by people such as OSH professionals who don’t perform the 
work, and ‘Work as Done’ by the workers who do the work and have practical knowl‑
edge of the required tasks and conditions they work in. Their input isn’t always sought 
when preparing OSH documentation. Often OSH procedures reside separately from 
operational procedures even though there are strong synergies for combined docu‑
ments. There are numerous academics who are championing this issue, so this debate 
is intentionally left outside the scope of this book. The focus here is primarily on 
operational improvements in risk management supported by top management. It’s 
sufficient to say that whatever work is done should be managed on a risk basis.
OSH documentation should be developed and implemented to build 
operational capability towards achieving consistently safe, efficient 
production to expected quality standards, not for the glorification 
of the OSH function.
What’s more important than the debate is building an understanding of process‑
related risks. It’s worth considering how the Entropy Model might better inform the 
risks associated with a task. Key inputs include:
• The condition and characteristics (e.g. safety in design) of equipment used;
• The state and characteristics of the environment (e.g. safety in design) where 
the work is undertaken;
62 DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-4Processes 63
• The competencies and condition of individuals who do the work;
• The characteristics of the job/s or process/es undertaken;
• Any residual risks within these systems of production; and
• The interaction of these systems of production in terms of compatibility or 
incompatibility and the potential for loss of control.
The characteristics of the job or process warrant particular attention in this chapter. 
The primary concerns are that residual risks are managed, and entropic risks are 
prevented. The sudden degradation (and rising entropic risk) of one or more systems 
could result in losses, for instance, equipment failure, human error due to fatigue, 
damage to infrastructure etc.
Control of the process comes down to two things.
The first is the quality of the systems of production that will be used.
Second, how well the work has been planned, communicated, understood 
by those involved plus agreed contingencies if something changes during the 
work that could lead to losses.
As the discussion unfolds in this and the next three chapters which focus on each of 
the systems of production, the quality and reliability of these systems is shown to be 
central in achieving safe, efficient production to quality standards. It’s because work 
is dynamic and ever‑changing that it’s challenging to consistently sustain the pro‑
cess system of production. New or modified work practices have a negative effect on 
safety and efficiency in the short‑term because workers need time to adjust and learn 
new skills. In addition, some of the consequences of change might not be fully antici‑
pated causing unexpected rises in entropic risk. This is where the inputs‑process‑ 
outputs method is useful. For instance, a company may set up a quick and convenient 
vehicle wash‑down area on a concrete slab at their facilities without considering the 
impact of hydrocarbon run off. This would introduce another source of entropic risk 
caused by the lack of fit between the process and the physical environment including 
other areas of the yard, a neighbouring property, into drains and eventually water‑
ways. Following a process from start to finish helps to avoid poor decisions. For 
example, the following should be considered: the water source and the chemicals to 
be used for the washdown, the tools and equipment including any risks of using these 
(high pressure water; electrical equipment; chemicals), and the responsible disposal 
of wastewater.
Changes in the supply chain are also crucial, particularly, the reductions in the 
quality of inputs. For instance, a facility had an onsite sewage treatment plant. 
The procurement department decided to cut costs and purchased a cheaper toilet 
paper thereby saving the company $10,000 per annum. It was found that the paper 
didn’t break down like the higher‑quality paper. As a result, the entire system 
became blocked which cost the business hundreds of thousands of dollars to rectify. 
Input‑process‑output analysis with the involvement of multiple disciplines would 
most likely have prevented this costly mistake. Hopefully, the organisation’s senior 64 Productive Safety Management
management didn’t blame the procurement manager or view the incident as a one‑off 
event. This simple example highlights the benefits of risk assessment when changes 
are proposed.
All processes have some level of human input and human fallibility is an accepted 
fact. At the operational level, the greater the direct involvement, the greater the work‑
er’s vulnerability to the risks associated with the interface between systems of pro‑
duction. In current practice, this likelihood takes exposure into consideration.
Exposure is often understood as a time‑related variable but realistically, 
it’s the severity of the risks more so than simply the length of time 
of contact that matters.
This is where the saying, ‘being in the wrong place at the wrong time’ comes into 
effect. The Entropy Model provides a better understanding of ‘exposure’ and relates 
it to a specific moment in time at which a process or task is being undertaken. What 
is more important than duration is the level of residual and entropic risks at that 
moment. Figure 3.1 illustrates this at various points in the model.
Three different moments are shown. Consider these as unrelated and representing 
three independent scenarios. At point 1, assume a high level of residual risk in the 
physical environment such as unstable ground conditions. Companies that have this 
type of hazardous condition can gather data through drilling but never have com‑
plete information about fissures, cracks or variability in rock hardness. The actual 
total residual risk contains some unknowns. Would a worker need to be exposure 
for a long period of time for the ground to collapse underneath them or could it 
happen instantly? Exposure time may be irrelevant in high residual risk situations. 
As a further example, in underground hard rock mining, there can be risks of toxic 
gas pockets, unstable sheets of rock on the workings roof, uneven ground, changing

water levels and other risks. The workplace is inherently dangerous and potential for 
an incident is significant and not necessarily time dependent.
At point 2, assume a moderate level of total residual risk in all systems of produc‑
tion. For instance, a driver is doing deliveries in a company vehicle. The driver has 
been at work since 7 a.m. and it’s now after lunch, a time when mild fatigue sets in. 
The vehicle brakes are spongy, and the steering is loose, but the driver is used to this. 
It starts to rain lightly. Unbeknown to the driver, an accident occurred on the road the 
day before and 20 litres of diesel is still on the surface. All systems of production (at 
2 in the figure) are in a moderately degraded state. Will an accident happen or not? 
Does the duration of exposure matter or is it simply that the combination of entropic 
risks intersects at a specific time in a dynamic process?
At point 3, assume the residual risk of all systems is moderate. One of systems 
of production is significantly degraded, for instance, in the driving scenario above 
either: the driver is intoxicated; or the vehicle brakes are starting to fail; or a large 
washout has occurred across the road. Exposure in terms of duration, in this sce‑
nario, is complicated. Being intoxicated doesn’t necessarily mean that the driver will 
have an accident. Failing brakes don’t mean the journey will end with an accident if 
a driver knows how to use the gears to reduce speed, responds by going up an incline 
and applies the park brake to bring the vehicle to a stop. The messaging here is that:
The probability of an incident relates to the absolute levels of residual and 
entropic risks at a given point in time, within a dynamic process. For this 
reason, a written risk assessment becomes redundant as soon as the work 
commences. Safety then depends on human responses to the changing risk 
profile. Risk variables must remain within tolerances that people 
can manage.
A worker when exposed to risk may be injured in the first or last five minutes or at 
any time in a day’s work. The worker’s susceptibility to injury is therefore related to 
the level of residual risk plus the variability in the entropic risk in other systems of 
production. The individual worker also has risks specifically related to their com‑
petencies. Areas in which they have a gap in knowledge, skills or abilities (KSAs) 
are a source of residual risk (due to the lead time for learning), whilst fluctuations in 
capacity are a worker‑specific entropic risk.
Worker exposure is the sum of a complex set of variables associated with 
the systems of production.
The following equation provides a more realistic profile of worker exposure than 
using a risk matrix with consequences versus likelihood. This takes into account 
the residual and entropic risks of each of the four systems of production, including 
the risk levels of co‑workers. This equation will be revisited at the end of Chapter 7 
which presents a detailed alternative to the current risk matrix approach.
Worker Exposure at a given point in time =
Level of residual risk in the process, physical environment and technologies66 Productive Safety Management
+ Levels of entropic risk in process, physical environment and technologies
+ Level of competencies and physical ability of co‑workers (i.e. others’ residual 
risks)
+ Level of co‑worker degradation (i.e. others’ entropic risks)
+ Level of worker‑specific competencies and physical ability (i.e. their own resid‑
ual risk)
+ Level of worker‑specific degradation (i.e. their own level of entropic risk).
(adapted from Van der Stap, 2008)
This process brings the systems of production together and creates the interfaces 
between these systems, for instance, at the person‑machine interface. A poor fit at 
this junction creates demands on the person that may increase their rate of degrada‑
tion, such as when complex control panels are more mentally demanding to operate 
than simple, well‑designed panels.
This approach to worker exposure also takes into consideration the residual and 
entropic risks associated with other workers. For instance, an individual worker 
may be highly skilled and physically suited to the job (therefore a low residual risk). 
They may maintain themselves in a healthy, alert condition (therefore a low level 
of entropic risk). Their contribution to the total risk level within the workplace may 
therefore be minimal if their standards of human performance are maintained. If 
however, that individual in made to operate in a workplace with systems of pro‑
duction that have high residual risks and/or rising entropic risks from the physical 
workplace, technologies, high‑energy uncontrolled processes, and/or other workers 
who are high risk, then that individual’s exposure is high. The other worker/s may 
be considered high risk if they are inexperienced (high residual risk) and/or contrib‑
ute high entropic risk due to states of degradation (such as drugs, alcohol, fatigue, 
ill‑health etc.).
The complexity of the risk variables that contribute to a process means that 
when there is an incident, blaming the worker is not only unjust and foolish 
but also technically wrong.
The various inputs to a process or task can result in work being done well, as it often 
is – without incident or noticeable loss. There may, however, be other circumstances 
where the accumulative impact of risks whilst undertaking a process, exceed the 
capacity of the system to control or tolerate the risk thereby leading to loss. This may 
be evident as a safety incident, production loss, quality deficiency or other dimin‑
ished return for the enterprise.
As mentioned earlier, the other types of processes that tend to be documented are 
risk management procedures and post‑incident investigation procedures. Considering 
Figure 3.2, an investigation should include questions about the time prior to and at 
the moment of the loss event. The key areas are:
1. The residual risks inherent in the physical work environment, technologies 
and process, and whether these were managed effectively;Processes 67
2. Any degraded states in the physical environment, technologies and the pro‑
cess, and the severity of this degradation;
3. The residual risks inherent in the workers undertaking the job and whether 
these were managed effectively;
4. Any degraded states in the workers and the severity of this degradation.
Traditional approaches to incident investigation tend to start with the worker who 
was directly involved in the incident. This new approach involves understanding con‑
text in which the undesirable event occurs before questioning any factors related to 
the person.
Figure 3.2 shows the systems of production and the residual and entropic risks 
of each, resulting in eight risk sources that can contribute to losses. Within the total 
system, human error is one element within HR entropic risk. Incomplete KSAs are 
a key component of HR residual risk. From a statutory perspective, the employer is 
accountable for ensuring that workers have the competencies they require to work 
safely. The employer also has a duty to ensure personnel aren’t suffering from fatigue 
or other form of temporary incapacitation. The figure infers, given the relative insig‑
nificance of intentional human deviance within the entire system, that blaming the 
worker isn’t technically correct when undertaking an incident investigation, as there 
are many other potential contributing factors. (This will be discussed further in 
Chapter 6 on HR risks and safety violations.)
Case studies: deepwater Horizon and train derailment
Table 3.1 provides an example of an incident and how the above factors may have 
contributed to the loss. The case study used is the Deepwater Horizon Disaster that

TABLE 3.1
Deepwater Horizon Categorisation of Risks
System of Production Residual Risks Entropic Risks
Processes High residual risk associated with the 
main process which involved 
extraction of hydrocarbons under 
pressure from under the seabed.
Investigation findings included the 
following degraded processes:
“weaknesses in cement design and 
testing, quality assurance and risk 
assessment”
“proper integrity testing of the shoe track, 
production casing and casing hanger 
seal assembly were not undertaken”
“If fluids had been diverted overboard, 
rather than to the MGS, there may have 
been more time to respond, and the 
consequences of the accident may have 
been reduced”
“potential weaknesses in the testing 
regime and maintenance management 
system for the BOP”
Technologies The main production technologies 
involved pressurised systems.
One of the major residual risks on rigs 
is the potential for hydrocarbons 
including gases to contact ignition 
source/s.
“Hydrocarbons migrated beyond areas 
on Deepwater Horizon that were 
electrically classified to areas where 
the potential for ignition was higher. 
The heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning system probably 
transferred a gas‑rich mixture into 
the engine rooms, causing at least 
one engine to overspeed, creating a 
potential source of ignition”
Investigation findings included the 
following degraded technologies:
“annulus cement probably experienced 
nitrogen breakout and migration, 
allowing hydrocarbons to enter the 
wellbore annulus”
“potential failure modes that could 
explain how the shoe track cement and 
the float collar allowed hydrocarbon 
ingress into the production casing”
“The BOP emergency mode did not seal 
the well. Three methods for operating 
the BOP in the emergency mode were 
unsuccessful in sealing the well.”
Physical Environment The rig was located in a high residual 
risk environment including subsea 
and oceanic conditions.
This was also a factor in relation to 
emergency response and evacuation.
The physical work environment (the rig) 
went into a rapid state of degradation 
when:
“hydrocarbons were vented directly onto 
the rig through the 12 in. goosenecked 
vent exiting the MGS, and other 
flow‑lines also directed gas onto the rig. 
This increased the potential for the gas 
to reach an ignition source”
Human Resources The competencies of the managers 
and work crews to prevent and deal 
with the emergency were not 
discussed in the report.
The condition of the managers and work 
crews were not discussed in the report. Processes 69
occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in the evening of 20 April 2010. BP’s Accident 
Investigation Report doesn’t discuss the competencies or condition of the manag‑
ers or workers, so the commentary here focuses on breaking down the residual and 
entropic risks associated with the processes undertaken, the physical work environ‑
ment and the technologies in use prior to and during the disaster as it unfolded. For 
this reason, the list is only a sample of the actual event based on the report from BP 
available at: deepwater‑horizon‑accident‑investigation‑report‑executive‑summary.
pdf (bp.com) (British Petroleum, 2010).
This example illustrates that the post‑incident investigation can be broken down 
into the eight sources of risk (residual and entropic risks in each of the four systems 
of production). These combinations can also be used to better understand the risks 
that affect people at work. As was shown in Figure 3.2, it contextualises human error 
as a HR entropic risk within the total production system.
Instead of starting an incident investigation with what the person/s did 
wrong at the time of the undesirable event, the question shifts firstly, to 
analysis of the system and circumstances that led to one or more critical 
risk decisions.
The second consideration is whether those person/s were adequately 
prepared (by the system) to manage or control the risk state that led 
to the event.
The table presents each system of production in the left‑hand column. The next col‑
umn is the associated residual risk with a description of evidence from the report. 
The table shows these were high in processes, technologies and the physical work 
environment. Specifically, high residual risk was associated with the main process 
which involved extraction of hydrocarbons under pressure from under the seabed. 
The main production technologies involved pressurised systems. One of the major 
residual risks on rigs was the potential for hydrocarbons including gases to contact 
ignition source/s. The rig was in a high residual risk environment including subsea 
and oceanic conditions. This was also a factor in relation to emergency response and 
evacuation.
The righthand column identifies the entropic risk of each system of production, 
again with quotes from the report that provide evidence. There were numerous 
degraded processes including weaknesses in cement design and testing, quality assur‑
ance and risk assessment. Integrity testing of critical components wasn’t undertaken 
along with weaknesses in testing regimes and maintenance management systems for 
a key part of the plant. This resulted in degraded technologies. The rig (being the 
physical workplace) went into a rapid state of degradation when gases were released 
and reached an ignition source.
Given the risk states of these systems of production, the actions of the workers 
become proportionally insignificant. The fact was that the high residual risks and 
rising entropic risks had reached a point of inevitable disaster. It’s doubtful that the 
workers alone could have done anything to influence this state.70 Productive Safety Management
The second case study is from a train derailment in Western Australia. This also 
provides context for human fallibility. Current ‘duty of care’ based legislation doesn’t 
allow the employer to lay sole blame on the worker or workers. The following news 
story about a train derailment illustrates this point.
A fully laden ore train pulling 268 carriages was derailed on 5 November 2018. 
The driver was out of the cabin when the train started travelling more than 90 kilo‑
metres before it was intentionally derailed by the remote‑control centre which was 
1,500 kilometres away. The driver’s employment was terminated by the company. An 
unfair dismissal case was lodged (ABC News, 10 January 2019, BHP driver sacked 
after Pilbara train derailment claims unfair dismissal – ABC News). An undisclosed 
settlement was reached six weeks later (ABC News, 2019, BHP reaches settlement 
with driver sacked over iron ore train derailment in Pilbara – ABC News).
The investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that there were 
several issues. A rail maintenance team had earlier started applying brakes to the 
wrong train. The team had been sent to assist the driver because the train had a dis‑
connected cable, but they started work on another train nearby. In the meantime, the 
faulty train started to roll away.
Had the team gone to the correct train, it would have still moved away because 
the emergency brake hadn’t been applied properly in the front locomotive and there 
had also been an electronic failure. The driver made an emergency call and the train 
was derailed remotely (ABC News, 12 March 2019, Handbrakes applied to wrong 
BHP iron ore train before Pilbara runaway derailment, ATSB finds – ABC News).
The regulator identified gaps in risk assessment processes that meant ore trains 
were vulnerable to a runaway event because potential causes and critical controls 
were inadequate considered. Safety critical actions weren’t clearly communicated to 
drivers.
The company reports having implemented a new rail system engineering frame‑
work with integration of train braking systems and operating protocols. Human 
factors related to fatigue and rosters were also considered (ABC News, 17 March 
2022, ATSB train derailment report raises concerns about BHP risk assessments and 
 communication – ABC News).
When considering the incident investigation process objectively, there are several 
questions to ask about boundaries of accountability between the organisation and the 
person/s involved:
1. Who has control over the systems of production?
2. Who is accountable for ensuring those systems of production are safe and 
operate in an environmentally responsible manner to required quality 
standards?
3. Who is accountable for ensuring the people engaged to perform work have 
the required competencies, i.e. the residual risk of individuals, teams and 
the workforce as a whole?
4. Who is accountable for ensuring that if there are competency gaps, there is 
adequate supervision and instruction in the short‑term and training over the 
longer‑term?Processes 71
5. Who is accountability for ensuring that people can maintain the capacity 
to do such work safely and to required standards, i.e. the entropic risks of 
people are prevented sufficiently?
6. Who is accountable for monitoring people to ensure they aren’t suffering 
from degradation?
7. Who is accountable for compliance once the company has taken all reason‑
able steps to make sure the workers are operationally prepared for the risks 
of the work?
The answer to questions 1–6 is the organisation. The answer to 7 is the individ‑
ual worker. Each situation would be looked at by the regulator or the courts on a 
case‑by‑case basis. For this reason, on the assumption that the organisation has ful‑
filled its obligations towards the worker, the question following an incident should be:
How did the organisation fail to protect a competent, conscientious worker?
Organisations need to take more responsibility for the quality of their HR system of 
production; after all, they control all steps in the engagement process from recruit‑
ment and selection, through to training, on‑the‑job supervision, performance man‑
agement etc. In this context, the enterprise should start from a baseline of objectivity 
when investigating the behaviours that preceded the undesirable event.
MINIMAL COMPLIANCE
A review of local OSH legislation is likely to reveal a balance between the account‑
abilities of the organisation, the worker and other duty holders. The Strategic 
Alignment Channel discussed in Chapter 2 indicated that enterprises are required 
to be legally compliant and socially responsible driven by governing and influencing 
forces in the external environment in which they operate. Some of the major transi‑
tions in OSH legislation are worth noting, the most significant of which was the shift 
away from prescription‑based legislation to ‘enabling’ legislation. This shaped cur‑
rent approaches to the legislative framework in the UK and Australia, in particular. 
This incorporated the concepts of ‘duty of care’ and ‘reasonably practicable’, because 
of the Robens Report of the early 1970s.
Robens went away from listing lots of individual regulations telling you exactly what 
you ought to do about particular hazards and the risks that arise and made it a simple 
principle – goal setting – every employer should identify the risks that they’re generat‑
ing and manage them effectively.
(British Safety Council, 2022)
Managers need a sound knowledge of OSH laws that apply to their operations, and, 
where applicable, this includes accountabilities that apply to them as an ‘officer’. In 
Australia, an ‘officer’ has the authority to make decisions that affect the whole, or 
a substantial part of a business or undertaking. Such persons have a duty to ensure 
appropriate systems of work and must actively monitor and evaluate work health and 72 Productive Safety Management
safety (WHS) management (WorkSafe Western Australia, 2021). They must exercise 
‘due diligence’ in relation to WHS matters to make informed decisions when dis‑
charging their duty. Note the use of the term ‘must’ as opposed to ‘should’, meaning 
that ‘must’ is mandated by WHS legislation.
This legislation continues to evolve especially in response to major disasters such 
as the Grenfell Tower Fire. Psychosocial risks are now also legislated adding to the 
depth and breadth of the OSH Professional’s duties to keep management informed 
and provide advice on risk mitigations. An underpinning principle is the concept 
of ‘reasonably practicable’. In the UK, the term ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’ 
(SFAIRP) is used (Health and Safety Executive, 2024). ‘Reasonably practicable’ 
addresses:
• The severity of any potential injury or harm to health and degree of risk of 
this occurring; and
• Knowledge of the injury or harm to health; the risk of it occurring; and the 
ways to remove or mitigate the injury or harm; and
• The availability, suitability, and cost of removing or mitigating the risk.
The bottom line is that when it becomes apparent that there’s a risk of injury or harm, 
the organisation’s management must do something about it. If however, manage‑
ment should know about it, for instance, because it’s industry or community knowl‑
edge, then not knowing or ignorance isn’t an excuse for inaction or a leave pass from 
accountability. Where the Regulatory Authority finds a breach, prosecution action 
may be initiated. The penalties imposed through this process are separate from 
claims of negligence by a third party against the company. In these circumstances, a 
Court of Law will test whether the enterprise has been negligent using the ‘reason‑
ably foreseeable’ and ‘proximity’ tests.
Enabling WHS legislation is performance‑based because it allows and encour‑
ages organisations to actively develop their own workplace‑specific safety standards. 
Enterprises committed to self‑regulation and achieving higher levels of safety and 
social responsibility than required by external forces exhibit proactive strategies. 
These can include strict operational discipline in the areas of planned maintenance, 
monitoring regimes including internal audits, and continual improvement processes. 
The extent of self‑regulation implies that little intervention is required from the regu‑
lator’ however, as was shown by the Entropy Model, organisations can degrade again 
following external and/or internal changes, putting them at risk of losses that may 
draw regulatory attention.
THE PATH TO MATURITY AND SELF‑REGULATION
PSM1 provided Figure 3.1 to illustrate a simple process management continuum and 
compliance outcomes. This is redesigned in Figure 3.3 to point to the end‑goal of 
achieving an organisation which operates on a risk and opportunity basis rather than 
according to siloed functions that are potentially in conflict.
There are models available in OSH literature that classify organisations accord‑
ing to their maturity in relation to OSH management, compliance, and culture. OSH Processes 73
maturity models perpetuate the siloing of the function and ignore safety’s place as 
one of many disciplines that belong under risk and opportunity management. A 
broader strategy should be adopted that is sensitive to operations and highly con‑
cerned with maintaining states of safety with reliability.
In this new order, organisations should be learning constantly and revering 
those enterprises that successfully adopt the principles of high‑reliability 
organisations, employing a risk and opportunity principal strategy.
It would be expected that with this approach, documentation of ‘The Work’ would be 
fully integrated so that operational work is seamless with control of OSH, environ‑
mental and quality risks associated with that work. Risk and opportunity assessment 
processes should be concerned with complexity, uncertainty and potential high‑risk 
environments. Organisations should focus on having sufficient capacity to navigate 
and respond effectively to changing demands.
At the operational coalface, it’s impossible to separate safety from reliability. For 
instance, remote exploration involves the mobilisation of plant, support equipment, 
vehicles and crews to locations that are far from community infrastructure and ser‑
vices. If equipment breaks down because of poor maintenance, the risk of safety 
incidents and schedule delays escalates significantly. The pre‑mobilisation inspec‑
tion should be the last verification undertaken well ahead of leaving the controlled 
facilities of the operation’s homebase. Unfortunately, due to schedule pressure (and 
underlying poor planning), this process may be rushed.
Defence operations are likely to have the same issues where lack of technological 
reliability leads to escalation of entropic risks putting people in danger and mission 
objectives at risk of failure. For this reason, defence operations have structured ways 
of considering all the factors associated with the task at hand – “the military Estimate 
of the Situation formed the cornerstone of an army officer’s function” (Stogran, 2016).
Figure 3.3 takes into consideration the ‘Safety Journey Maturity Model’ (Hudson, 
2003, 2007; Foster and Hoult, 2003). Hudson et al. mapped five steps later included

FIGURE 3.3 The path to the principal risk and opportunity strategy74 Productive Safety Management
1. at the lowest level is a ‘pathological’ stage where systems are under‑ 
developed and the culture is ‘no care’;
2. improving to ‘reactive’ only taking risk management seriously after incidents;
3. maturing to ‘compliance’ is mostly driven top‑down;
4. becoming ‘proactive’ involves worker participation bottom‑up; and
5. culminating in ‘generative’ where risk is managed as a way of organisational 
life.
The figure starts on the left‑hand side with the risk tolerance of the enterprise rang‑
ing from low to moderate to high. These align to Hudson’s Maturity Level with 
‘Generative’ having a low risk tolerance, ‘Compliance’ having a moderate tolerance 
(only meeting basic legal requirements), and ‘Pathological’ being associated with 
high risk tolerance (non‑compliant). In the centre column, these correlate to high 
and low reliability at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Unsurprisingly, reliability is 
driven by compliance at the moderate tolerance level. It’s proposed in the figure that 
these also drive the strategic focus of the enterprise. This ranges at the bottom where 
there’s no strategy, through to functional strategy for compliance. Progressively as 
the organisation becomes more proactive, the strategy becomes aspirational until a 
high reliability environment is created. Reliability and safety of the systems of pro‑
duction becomes central to the principal strategy. Timeframes shift accordingly. The 
pure profit motive drives enterprises at the bottom end of the spectrum. Sustainable 
profit and integrated excellence drives enterprises at the top end of this continuum.
There are underlying cultural factors that will influence how processes are deter‑
mined. These have a flow on impact on operational risk and opportunity manage‑
ment. Figure 3.3 proposes a pathway for improvement. It’s a vision for a dynamic, 
outwardly aware, organisational environment. Opportunities lay in building on pre‑
vious work undertaken in business management and culture development across 
industries, and in particular, the emergence of high‑reliability organisations as role 
models for enterprises aiming for sustainability.
How can this be achieved? Organisations should firstly understand where they 
are on the continuum then aim to progress incrementally to the next level up. For 
instance, the business operating reactively based on survival strategy should aim to 
mature beyond profit on a short horizon. Currently, their management may be moti‑
vated by avoiding external flack or accountability (being publicly found out) because 
of a lack of understanding of risk in the broader business content. This gap can be 
closed through a facilitated enterprise level risk assessment to better understand their 
organisation in a broader context, covering factors such as stakeholder analysis, sup‑
ply chain risks and other strategic matters, that progressively cascade to operational 
challenges.
In the mid‑level, the organisation with a moderate risk tolerance may be compliant 
where the law clearly dictates and ‘fuzzy’ in matters of self‑regulation. Reliability 
is an outcome of compliance. For instance, legislation prescribes inspection of plant 
and equipment on a risk basis. The organisation will have paperwork as evidence of 
this; however, how well it’s done will directly impact whether the plant and equip‑
ment are actually safe and reliable. At this level, the strategic focus is functional so 
operations achieve what they can whilst support functions such as OSH do the same Processes 75
with the resources provided. Management is focused on the enterprise being in busi‑
ness for the medium‑term to the extent that it understands the environment that it 
operates in.
As the organisation matures, horizons are scanned for ‘best practice’ within their 
industry or through potential learnings across industry sectors. Profit timeframes 
stretch from mid‑term to longer horizons. Each function is expected to pursue excel‑
lence. There’s a desire for synergies across functional boundaries.
At the highest ‘generative’ level, operational reliability of all systems of produc‑
tion is a primary focus. Continuity of production, safety performance and quality 
assurance can’t be achieved without it. Simply, lack of reliability is an indication 
of rising entropic risk and potentially unmanaged residual risk. The profit objec‑
tive remains focused on sustainability and is the foundation of how the organisation 
develops its Principal Strategy. Sustainability infers an outward and inward focus 
concurrently based on alignment.
Where an organisation sits on this continuum will shape how it approaches the 
development and implementation of its processes to control risks (and exploit oppor‑
tunities) at the operational level. Even simple processes can send powerful messages. 
For instance rudimentary practices such as whether work teams hold ‘safety meet‑
ings’ or ‘safety and operations meetings’, plus how often these are conducted – both 
planned and as needed, convey management’s mindset. Psychologically, this basic 
practice can impact workers’ perceptions regarding the compatibility of the two 
functions. If concurrently, they regularly observe operations managers and supervi‑
sors working closely with the OSH team in the workplace, this lends weight to OSH 
being integral to operational performance. In contrast however, if the OSH Advisor 
comes to the workplace on a weekly basis to conduct the ‘safety meeting’, safety 
will be seen as a separate silo and after the meeting, operations will resume business 
as usual.
The ‘devil is in the detail’ when it comes to messaging about safety 
and production at the operational level, so it’s important that senior 
management clearly define their position in relation to compliance 
versus ‘beyond compliance’.
The decision to only meet minimum standards is neither right nor wrong. It’s based 
on risk, but the assurance processes must be in place for it to be a legitimate busi‑
ness strategy. Senior management would want to know that there’s no slippage into 
sub‑standard enterprise performance, however, the Entropy Model indicates that this 
can occur easily. A high jumper doesn’t aim for the bar. They aim above the bar to 
make sure they don’t commit a foul.
What may become problematic is where self‑regulation drives industry standards. 
For instance, in some international mining companies, the standard for site vehi‑
cles until 2016 included modifications such as internal rollover protection, bull bar, 
flag, beacon, and reflective body stripe. Such companies required that all contractor 
vehicles going to their sites were equally fitted out so this became industry standard 
across most of the Australian mining industry. The cost was incurred by businesses 
large and small.76 Productive Safety Management
In 2016, one of these companies changed to Five Star ANCAP rated vehicles for 
their own fleet as well as contractor‑owned or hired vehicles (Australasian Mine 
Safety Journal, 2013; Australian Mining, 2013). Inspection processes were estab‑
lished on company sites to ensure compliance to the light vehicle standard, with any 
failures resulting in access being denied. At the time, some commonly used vehicle 
brands were not Five Star rated leaving contractors in a financial quandary on how 
to retain service contracts. In 2023, ANCAP (the independent standards authority) 
changed the criteria for ratings. As a result, a vehicle sold in 2017 with a five‑star 
rating may not achieve this level against the new criteria (The NRMA, 2023). This 
simple example highlights the complexities faced by businesses from external factors 
that are beyond their control and the cost implications of ‘self‑regulation’.
COMPLEXITY AND MANAGEMENT OF WORK PRACTICES
It’s generally accepted that the external environment of the organisation is changing 
dynamically, and the level of complexity has risen significantly over the last 50 years. 
In the meantime, many of the processes undertaken at the work site remain funda‑
mentally the same or similar in relation to fatality potential. This is except where 
there have been major changes in technologies that have removed the worker from 
hazardous situations altogether. For instance, on a construction site many activities 
remain consistent. These include excavations; overhead crane operations; erection 
of scaffolding; installation of services such as electricity; introduction of hazardous 
substances; and access/egress with traffic management issues.
Methods for the control of risks associated with these ‘major hazards’ or ‘fatal 
risks’ is embedded and readily available in industry. Fatalities, however, continue 
to occur and the question needs to be asked whether this is due to the complexity of 
processes or systems to manage the work. Sandone and Wong (2010) undertook an 
interesting case study of an electric utility organisation in Canada.
Case study: Canadian eleCtriC utility
The study involved using a ‘Sense‑Making Framework Approach’ to classify safety 
interventions using four categories being ‘Simple’, ‘Complicated’, ‘Complex’ and 
‘Chaotic’. (These relate to the process system of production.) The organisation was 
experiencing changes due to external and internal forces. Despite, in the past, hav‑
ing a good safety record and culture, there had been an increase in accidents on site, 
which alarmingly, included fatalities.
According to the researchers, ‘Simple’ systems are easy to understand with a clear 
relationship between cause and effect. These are known knowns which are easy to 
comply with. In contrast, it’s difficult to quickly comprehend the cause and effect 
of complicated systems. Experts might find these useful but operationally, because 
workers don’t readily know the logic behind the experts’ modelling, these may come 
down to a set of rules. ‘Simple’ and ‘Complicated’ systems are orderly. If this is con‑
sidered in relation to the Entropy Model, workers can comply with simple instruc‑
tions and follow rules, so therefore uncontrollable rising entropic risk shouldn’t occur 
within the process system of production.Processes 77
The Work becomes problematic however, when ‘Complex’ systems are intro‑
duced. It’s impossible to understand the relationship between cause and effect, 
which can result in unpredictable behaviours. In the study, it was proposed that these 
responses couldn’t be forecast but patterns could be observed. Though not stated, it’s 
assumed that these may have been evident as near‑misses or other losses. Finally, 
‘Chaotic’ systems had no relationship between cause and effect. Both ‘Complex’ 
and ‘Chaotic’ systems were disorderly. Relating this to the Entropy Model suggests 
that these would also contribute to degradation of behaviours when undertaking pro‑
cesses and therefore, cause rising entropic risk.
The conclusions of Sandone and Wong’s (2010) are particularly poignant in this 
discussion about control of activities at the operational level. They stated:
Chaotic domain required fast action to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Complex 
domain issues require experimentation as a way to learn about and understand its pat‑
terns; patience is required to let the system find a practical and acceptable solution. 
Applying an improper decision‑making approach can cause counterproductive effects. 
As the authors discovered, the two most recurrent safety issues that emerged from the 
analysis (safety support and safety rules) seem to be a direct consequence of the orga‑
nization’s strong willingness to reduce safety incidents by introducing more rules to 
increase compliance. This approach is a typical Ordered side solution and fails to con‑
sider the complexity of work situations. Safe‑fail experimentations (for safety support) 
and consensual expertise (for safety rules) have been suggested as ways to eliminate 
ambiguous, confusing and frustrating work situations that lead to unsafe practices.
(Sandone and Wong, 2010)
The first point flags the need for corrective action when chaos (or rapid degradation) 
becomes evident. The second point about complex domain issues and ‘experimenta‑
tion’, infer data gathering of patterns and recurrent issues, which according to the 
Entropy Model, would result in ‘maintenance practices’ to control complexity using 
a ‘practical and acceptable solution’.
The final significant learning from this paper is that increasing the number of 
rules can cause complexity to rise, which may be counterproductive. Leveson (2011) 
has written at length about how new technologies have introduced complication and 
new causes of accidents are arising from it. This includes avoiding treating complex‑
ity as one indivisible property as there are various types when managing safety. In 
the field of human factors in safety performance, there has been extensive work done 
on ‘Complexity management theory’, ‘Sensemaking’ and the ‘Implications of com‑
plexity in managing safety culture’ (Carrillo, 2011).
A strong message that can be deduced from this case study and the other research 
work undertaken in the last 15 years in combination with the author’s experience is:
Operations must be protected from chaos and complexity.
This comment raises questions about the role of risk‑related professions who provide 
support services to operations, such as OSH, environment, quality and contractor 
management. Change in inevitable and in large organisations often comes from head 
office or senior management (top‑down). Sometimes new strategies or programmes 78 Productive Safety Management
aren’t explained well or contextualised or fully considered from an operational 
implementation perspective. Without the background detail, talking to operations 
about impending changes is likely to be met with uncertainty and apprehension about 
the additional work, potential chaos and/or complications that will be introduced. For 
this reason, operations should be protected from chaos and complexity, until well 
thought out solutions can be socialised.
As a fundamental principle of risk management, operations should be 
enabled to maintain control over critical risks that affect their work. 
Supporting functions should provide a buffer from influencing forces that 
are beyond operations’ control.
Solutions should be socialised framing them from a practical perspective.
Much more could be written about the impact of complexity on risk, based on OSH 
and other literature. It’s more meaningful and useful, however, to consider these mat‑
ters within the everyday context of work, especially at the ‘coalface’ by asking basic 
questions:
• “Do any of our processes create chaos?”
• “Are our systems too complex to be implemented as intended?”
• “If yes, to either or both, what can we do about it, and what is the risk if we 
don’t act?”
From OSH experience, the appetite for complexity can arise from incident investi‑
gations. This was confirmed in the case study, “a direct consequence of the orga‑
nization’s strong willingness to reduce safety incidents by introducing more rules 
to increase compliance” (Sandone and Wong, 2010). Operations managers and 
OSH professionals should be sceptical about the practical validity of ALARP when 
more rules and procedures are introduced. Unfortunately, ALARP is currently the 
accepted basis for risk reduction in industry.
THE ALARP ASSUMPTION
ALARP was defined in Chapter 2. As explained by the Health and Safety Executive 
UK, ALARP and SFAIRP (so far as is reasonably practicable) are essentially the 
same as at their core is the concept of ‘reasonably practicable’ (Health and Safety 
Executive, 2023). In the USA, ALARA – ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ – is used 
which was developed as a guiding principle for radiation safety (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2024). A summary table of countries, organisations and 
their terminology is in the paper, ALARP‑Final‑Paper‑Publishing.pdf (Mary Kay 
O’Connor Process Safety Center, 2020). The key findings were:
• A number of developed countries with mature process safety cultures are adopt‑
ing, or have adopted, ALARP or similar principles as risk acceptance criteria.
• Although the underlying principles are similar, the application of the prin‑
ciples varies significantly.Processes 79
• ALARP principles are often applied differently to various industries even 
within the same country.
• Both qualitative and quantitative approaches have been applied for risk 
estimation.
• All approaches recommend cost‑benefit analysis, but there is no consensus 
on exactly how it should be done.
• There is no clear guideline on how to determine the disproportionality factor 
(in cost benefit analysis).
• Data is very scarce on how ALARP is practiced in industry.
• Although ALARP is not mandated in the United States, some US based com‑
panies practice ALARP principles, probably because of the global nature of 
the companies.
(Mary Kay O’Connor Process Safety Center, 2020)
As a global standard, risk continues to be viewed as a singular concept that relates 
from an OSH perspective to the nature of injury, the likelihood of injury and the 
period over which it occurs (CCPS, 2009). The implementation of ALARP is facili‑
tated by using the Hierarchy of Controls (HoC), an explanation of which can be 
found online (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023 and NIOSH 2023).
The rationale of the HoC is that controls at the top of the triangle – elimination, 
substitution and engineering controls – are more effective and preferable to those at 
the lower end – administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE). 
In practice, what becomes problematic with the combination of the definitions of 
ALARP and ‘reasonably practicable’, with having a ‘WHS duty’, is that organisa‑
tions know they must do something (not nothing), in relation to a risk of injury, but 
cost is also an accepted critical factor in the definition of ‘reasonably practicable’. 
It’s relatively easy therefore for organisations, following an incident investigation to 
do ‘something’ which is low cost. Concurrently, they can argue that a new level of 
ALARP has been achieved because of the implementation of inexpensive additional 
controls. What tends to happen is administrative controls and PPE changes become 
attractive options.
Unfortunately, in practice, these lower order controls are highly dependent on the 
worker following a procedure and wearing PPE to a standard of performance. It’s 
widely accepted that human beings are inclined to introduce inconsistencies in how 
work is done. This same rationale applies to undertaking safe work practices. There 
will be variability from person to person in how they execute the task. According to 
the Entropy Model, this is because of competency deficiencies (residual risk) and/
or physical limitations (residual risk) and/or entropic risks such as fatigue, errors in 
judgement and other human factors. The quandary is if administration controls and 
PPE compliance are not reliable, how can a new lower level of ALARP be achieved 
by adding more of these controls?
This creates a dilemma resulting from the disconnection between principles or 
definitions and operational practice. This can be labelled the ‘ALARP Assumption’. 
It’s assumed that further layers of administrative controls reduce risk when it may 
have the oppose effect if the system is becoming overly complex to implement.
A measured approach is required when considering the ‘ALARP Assumption’. 
Firstly, there are some administrative controls such as permit to work systems that 
are critical to manage residual risks such as containment of hazardous substances 80 Productive Safety Management
and isolation of energy sources. The value of these shouldn’t be underestimated. 
It’s OSH complacency and “the organization’s strong willingness to reduce safety 
incidents by introducing more rules to increase compliance” (Sandone and Wong, 
2010) that require a rethink in relation to actual, operational risk reduction. The gap 
is likely the failure to prove that safety and reliability within the systems of produc‑
tion have improved as a result of these additional lower order controls.
Complacency and over‑zealousness may be opposites, but both might lack 
objectivity when it comes to understanding the impact of change 
on operational risk levels.
It’s not being suggested here that the global definition of ALARP or SFAIRP or 
ALARA needs to be overhauled from a regulatory perspective, however, in practice, 
the limitations need to be carefully considered particularly for operational risk own‑
ers. When incident investigations result in superficial causes and corrective actions 
that involve further procedural controls or rules, questions need to be asked:
• Has there been a reduction in actual risk because of these added controls; and
• Is there now a greater level of reliability in the system to prevent future 
losses or failures.
More broadly in relation to current operational practice:
• Do additional procedural controls reach a point of diminishing return in 
terms of risk reduction?
• Do they add complexity that reaches a point where the risk rises rather than 
falls because human capacity to cope is exceeded?
• Do they reduce efficiency by adding low value thoroughness to the system?
The latter question takes into consideration that an organisation working on a risk 
basis to pursue production, safety and quality performance concurrently should know 
when efficiency is being compromised for thoroughness because there is a trade‑off, 
as per Hollnagel’s ETTO principle (2009). From a risk perspective, minor reductions 
in safety risk due to more thorough operational risk assessment or processes, may 
generate time pressures that result in rising ‘production pressure risk’. A risk transfer 
may occur rather than a risk reduction, thus defeating the aim to make the work safer.
The ALARP Assumption may also apply during the design and construction phases 
of a facility, well before it reaches the operational phase. For instance, the new major 
hazard facility project in the design stage usually involves complex hazard analysis 
methods that determine ALARP. These methods can be described as process safety:
A disciplined framework for managing the integrity of operating systems and pro‑
cesses handling hazardous substances by applying good design principles, engineering, 
and operating practices. It deals with the prevention and control of incidents that have 
the potential to release hazardous materials or energy. Such incidents can cause toxic 
effects, fire, or explosion and could ultimately result in serious injuries, property dam‑
age, lost production, and environmental impact.
(Center for Chemical Process Safety, 2009)Processes 81
Process Safety focuses on engineering and design throughout the life cycle of this 
type of facility. There are numerous risk assessment processes undertaken and the 
most common are described in the glossary of the CCPS (American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers, 2024). One is the Hazard Identification Study (HAZID) which 
is based on the front‑end engineering design (FEED) to enable progress to detailed 
design. The key objectives are:
• To identify inherent hazards early in the plant design development;
• Quantify the risk associated with each hazard;
• Based on the level of risk, initiate a process to ideally eliminate the hazard or 
reduce risk to a level to ALARP through elimination, substitution or engineering;
• Identify safety critical elements of the preliminary design;
• Commence the functional safety lifecycle to determine the extent and integ‑
rity of the plant’s safety instrumented systems (SIS).
The HAZID is a critical piece of work for new projects because it informs the design 
strategy. For instance, at FEED, decisions need to be made that affect the cost of 
construction. This cost is weighed against the as‑built risk profile and running costs 
in the operational phase. Operations may need to undertake modifications to plant or 
infrastructure, or work around design deficiencies, such as using scaffolding during 
shutdown maintenance. Ideally, safe working at heights would have been achieved by 
installing platforms, walkways, and ladders during construction. Whilst it’s generally 
agreed that it’s cheaper to build safety at the design and construction phases rather 
than retrofitting during operations, this doesn’t always happen because a higher cost 
build makes it more difficult to attract investment capital. This creates a trade‑off 
regarding ‘reasonably practicable’ and an ethical dilemma for design engineers.
In many jurisdictions, project regulatory approvals processes, both safety and 
environmental‑related, mandate the completion of HAZID studies. This work is also 
required for insurance purposes. The outputs are often subject to third party audit by 
accredited risk engineering firms and insurance underwriters. Any changes to the design 
during FEED will require a revisit of the HAZID study to ensure that the risk register 
is accurate. In addition to providing compliance assurance, a benefit of the HAZID is 
to make informed design decisions and avoid major ‘surprises’ during commissioning.
The second round of process safety analysis usually involves the Hazard and 
Operability Study (HAZOP) study. This is a systematic review of the process plant to 
help identify hazards inherent in the process. Considerations include plant operabil‑
ity and maintainability, injury to personnel, asset damage, environmental damage, 
harm to the community, loss of production and liability. The key objectives include:
• Review of the final design for inherent hazards;
• Quantification of the risk associated with each hazard;
• Based on the level of risk, initiation of a process to ideally eliminate the 
hazard or reduce risk to ALARP.
The HAZOP, in simple terms, assesses the impact of the final design on operational 
practices such as maintenance and emergency management. For instance, during 
FEED, the volumes of hazardous substances within tanks and the processing facility 82 Productive Safety Management
will be determined by the design. From an operational perspective, this will inform 
the fire and explosion containment requirements for the site against mandatory stan‑
dards. This will generate the need for emergency management plans, response capa‑
bility and external agency involvement.
Setting an acceptable standard becomes more problematic for existing operations 
intending to undertake site or facility modifications that don’t come under the scru‑
tiny of the regulator through some sort of approvals process. For instance, a factory 
built 50 years ago may have a single lane access road. As the business grows, this 
access constraint would become problematic. For instance, due to lack of alterna‑
tives, it may end up being used by heavy vehicles entering and leaving the site as well 
as workers’ and visitors’ vehicles. This main access may also need to be crossed by 
workers when going to and from the factory to the main parking area. As a result, 
this interface between heavy vehicles, cars and pedestrians may become the highest 
risk on site.
Current legislation with its combination of ‘WHS duty’, ‘reasonably practicable’ 
and ‘ALARP’ doesn’t necessarily provide a standard that prescribes the separations 
of heavy vehicles, cars, and pedestrians. Guidance material exists which may be 
taken into legal consideration if there were a fatality due to these traffic manage‑
ment risks, but there remains considerable latitude for the organisation to implement 
low‑cost controls. The cheapest and least effective of these would be administrative 
controls (e.g. pedestrian crossing with give‑way rules) and high visibility clothing 
(PPE) for workers traversing the area. In a culturally immature organisation, safety 
alone can be insufficient motivation for management to outlay the costs of new access 
roads using safety in design including separation principles.
Due to lack of clear regulation, oversight or intervention, ALARP can 
become symbolic rather than practised.
The limitations of ALARP may include a key misunderstanding that it’s a formula 
with a go/no go answer at the end of the risk analysis in the design phase of new proj‑
ects or modifications to existing facilities. ALARP tends to focus mostly on assets 
such as infrastructure, plant, and equipment, following the principles of ISO 55000 
Asset Management, without the detailed inclusion of human factors. This can lead 
to the presumption that at the design phase the ALARP work is done. In mature 
organisations such as those following high reliability principles, the residual risk is 
revisited when there are major modifications to physical assets during the operational 
phase. For less mature organisations and more broadly in industry, even though 
ALARP has been set in concrete as an industry standard and a legislative bench‑
mark; that doesn’t mean that it should be accepted carte blanche. Practical testing 
should be used to validate the effectiveness of controls within the specific operational 
environment of the enterprise.
ALARP should be viewed with cynicism by operations who must live with 
design deficiencies and the risk of increasing rules based on low value 
thoroughness. The resulting compromised efficiency may generate new risks 
such as production pressure.Processes 83
The danger with low value thoroughness is that it’s time consuming, which in turn, 
reduces efficiency. Workers are then expected to get the work done in less time 
thereby creating organisational production pressure as well as individuals inflicting 
pressure on themselves to deliver on personal and team expectations.
Figure 3.4 has been developed to illustrate the ALARP Assumption using a new 
project as it transitions through various phases to operations. (There could be numer‑
ous versions of the concepts presented.) During the FEED Design Review Stage 
shown on the left‑hand side, reliable risk reduction occurs because the HAZID and 
HAZOP focus on the higher order controls of elimination, substitution, and engi‑
neering. This is shown by the downward, dashed arrow.
The next phases together involve construction and commissioning. These are 
managed using safety critical controls for major hazards. In most instances, proce‑
dural controls and PPE for these phases are considered compliant and often to indus‑
try standards. In the figure, these are reliable resulting in a further reduction in the 
residual risk. As stated earlier, procedural controls and PPE such as permits to work 
and isolation procedures that are risk‑based justify lowered residual risk. The arrow 
therefore continues downwardly.
During the initial phase of operations, what should occur is a focus on risk‑based 
controls. The bulk of the OSH management system from a procedural perspective is 
developed and implemented for this phase. Provided these are risk‑based, a further 
reduction occurs during the ‘Operations: Major Risk Phase’. The figure shows that after 
this, the organisation moves to the ‘Operations; Incremental Learning Phase’. Lessons 
come from incidents, internal audits and other opportunities for review. The rate of 
total risk reduction is shown to have slowed with the downward arrow being flatter.
As the operation and its OSH management system matures, there is the risk it 
will move into ‘Operations: Low Value Thoroughness Phase’, as shown. Actions are 
taken because ‘something’ must be done, and this may add greater attention to risk 
reduction with diminishing returns. Other risks with unforeseen or unacknowledged 
consequences may arise such as production pressure. The excessive use of rules may

have negative impacts on the culture, for instance, if workers perceive that they’re in 
a ‘parent‑child’ relationship with ‘the system’. For this reason, the actual risk level 
is shown as variable and unreliable. Below this squiggle is the line representing the 
ALARP level that management assumes has been achieved.
As an example, at some Australian mine sites, the controls for parking vehicles 
outside the administration area are rigorous compared to parking at a shopping cen‑
tre. The standard controls include: the carpark is built on flat ground (safety in design 
the same as a shopping centre) and there are parking protocols that include leaving 
the vehicle in gear, with the park brake on and the keys removed (isolation of energy). 
Mine site vehicles are inspected by the driver regularly (daily or weekly) plus main‑
tained according to the manufacturer’s manual as a minimum. Controls that are addi‑
tional to the standard controls often include: mandatory reverse parking if the vehicle 
is against a structure; and/or installation of humps over which the vehicle is parked 
so that if it rolls it will stop against the hump; and/or use of chocks. The additional 
controls are thoroughness without value given the rigour of vehicle maintenance and 
inspection regimes along with driver competency assessments. Being a highly visible 
area, compliance is easy to police. ‘Policing’ is the operative word in the example 
and will be discussed further in later chapters. In particular, the conversation will 
delve into the difference between visible enforcement and operational discipline as 
an outcome of risk management capacity.
ALARP, whilst accepted as the industry standard for risk reduction, has some 
serious deficiencies when it comes to operational implementation.
SUMMARY
Processes provide the interface between other systems of production. These are often 
proceduralised into four categories: those to describe how the system works; safe 
work practices; risk management practices; and incident investigation processes. 
There are various drivers that influence the development of such procedures and 
these include legislative requirements, standards such as ISO and self‑regulation. 
From a practical perspective, processes bring technologies, the physical workplace 
and human resources together to achieve work. There are numerous activities across 
all industries where this happens daily. The compatibility of these systems at the 
interface has a significant influence on the risk level.
As a follow‑up to Chapter 1 which discussed the Entropy Model, it was explained 
that risk is dynamic and worker exposure is a sum of a complex set of variables asso‑
ciated with systems of production. There are eight sources of risk comprising the total 
risk profile, which may contribute to losses including safety incidents. Human error 
fits within this profile. This was contextualised using the case studies of Deepwater 
Horizon and a train derailment. The latter, in particularly, highlighted that blaming 
the worker isn’t a technically correct approach to incident investigation. In later chap‑
ters, ‘blame’ will be balanced against an appropriate level of accountability.
The concept of a Risk and Opportunity Principal Strategy was introduced and 
proposed that it may enable enterprises to adopt the principles of high‑reliability 
organisations. This topic will be expanded progressively through the following chap‑
ters and will be the primary focus of the final chapter (Chapter 10). It was shown that Processes 85
senior managers should understand where their enterprise sits on the compliance 
continuum and if they’re below the compliance level, the first objective should be to 
achieve this where risk tolerance is moderate (solely driven by compliance), the strat‑
egy is functional, and timeframes are based on a medium horizon. Proactive organ‑
isations on the other hand, have aspirational strategy, aim for sustainable profit, and 
work towards functional excellence. Entities that are reactive or pathological aren’t 
only non‑compliant but carry significant business risks that reflect the vulnerability 
of the enterprise and its officers.
This chapter has included discussion about some important definitions within 
the OSH legislative framework. The opportunity presented by the self‑regulation 
pathway includes learning to perform well across functional areas. The concept of a 
Risk and Opportunity Principal Strategy was introduced and will be progressively 
expanded throughout this edition. There’s nothing in current legislation that prevents 
safety compliance from also being efficient and contributing to quality work. The 
problem comes about from looking at this legislation only from an OSH discipline 
perspective.
Importantly, a sense‑making framework approach is needed to develop safe, 
efficient, quality‑driven work procedures. For these to be effective, they need to be 
orderly – simple where possible and if complicated, well‑explained and socialised. 
Operations must be protected from chaos and complexity both of which introduce 
disorder. The role of support services professions, such as OSH, is to provide a buffer 
between sources of complexity and to provide the frontline with practical workable 
solutions. Sometimes those complexities are created by head offices that don’t neces‑
sarily fully appreciate the challenges of operational implementation.
It was acknowledged in this chapter that the concept of ALARP and its equivalents 
are unlikely to change as these are the bases of risk management practices and cur‑
rent legislation. It should be viewed, however, with cynicism. Operations may inherit 
deficiencies in design because of risk‑based decisions to contain project or modifica‑
tion costs. In addition, as a facility and its OSH management system matures, there 
is a danger of adopting further layers of lower order controls with diminishing return 
on risk reduction. Complexity may be introduced which causes risk to rise as workers 
become overwhelmed by bureaucracy and policing. It was proposed that risk transfer 
may be occurring as increased thoroughness, which is time consuming, results in 
unforeseen consequences such as production pressure and a negative impact on the 
workplace culture.
The next chapter will discuss technological residual and entropic risks, including 
transformations that are occurring within workplaces because of innovation. The 
following chapters (5 and 6) will discuss physical environment and human resources 
risks, respectively.

RESIDUAL RISK AND DESIGN
Technological risk management begins in the design, planning, and procurement 
stages during the initial phases of a facility’s lifecycle. The external forces shown 
by the Channel affect these decision‑making processes and encourage the enterprise 
to act responsibly, for example, by providing and maintaining, as far as reasonably 
practicable, working conditions in which workers are not exposed to hazards. As 
discussed previously, this is moderated against cost considerations. What is meant by 
‘does not pose a hazard’ is that the level of risk is ‘acceptable’, given the current state 
of technological knowledge in the industry. It’s not possible to eliminate residual 
risk, so all technologies are hazardous to some degree depending on the amount of 
energy involved.
OSH legislation imposes duties on manufacturers and suppliers to factor safety 
into designs, and to consider the risks to installers, those who undertake mainte‑
nance and operators/users of equipment. Requirements include testing and inspec‑
tion regimes, as well as provision of information about the equipment, its hazards 
and safety during the product life. Duties apply to employers in relation to the use, 
cleaning, maintenance, transportation and disposal of plant, and the use, handling, 
processing, storage, transportation and disposal of substances. In addition to general 
duties, prescriptive regulations apply to plant and substances. These requirements 
tend to be clear cut.
‘So far as is reasonably practicable’ in the legislation alludes to two constraints that 
affect the level of residual risk of new technology and the rate at which it degrades. 
Firstly, at the design and manufacturing stage, risk‑based cost‑benefit decisions must 
be made concerning the level of safety built into a unit of equipment. For example, 
how much would a consumer be prepared to pay for a car that was ‘guaranteed’ to 
prevent serious injury in a collision at 100 kilometres per hour under set conditions? 
How much time and cost would a company be willing to dedicate to research and 
development of such a car? Limited resources cause the community to accept a level 
of risk that can’t be reduced in the short‑term. Organisations must manage these 
residual risks, which means in turn that workers will be exposed to some degree, for 
instance, during operations and maintenance.
Design‑based, cost‑benefit decisions also affect the life of a technology. Inputs 
that lengthen life of product are more expensive. The willingness of the consumer 
to pay for this extended utility influences product quality and the expected rate of 
degradation. Both residual and entropic risk levels of plant, equipment and tools are 
determined during manufacturing and relate to quality standards. As organisations 
are provided with known inputs when they purchase these traditional technologies, 
the entropic risk should be forecastable and measurable if the technology is operated 
DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-5 8788 Productive Safety Management
according to design tolerances. In this regard, these risks should be in the realm of 
known knowns – information is readily available to the purchaser and others in the 
industry.
The second constraint is that operations must make decisions about resourcing in 
the presence of scarcity. Human, physical and financial capitals are limited with little 
flexibility to increase these resources in the short‑term. For example, the decision 
to replace old technology (physical capital) requires financial capital. With limited 
finances, the organisation may need, in the short‑term, to accept the higher levels of 
residual risk inherent in the old compared to the new equipment. It may also have to 
compensate for higher rates of entropic risk using more rigorous, planned mainte‑
nance strategies. These constraints are well‑understood in industry, but, as discussed, 
later in this chapter, there are trends towards significant changes in technologies that 
won’t be so predictable and may take the enterprise into more unknown risks.
Properly designed and well‑manufactured technology has a lead‑time before it 
begins to degrade and ultimately reaches an ‘unacceptable’ risk. Ahead of that state, 
from the cost point‑of‑view, it may be beneficial to continue to operate the old tech‑
nology in the short‑term even though it’s less efficient, less safe and more costly in 
terms of maintenance than the new technology. Such decisions can be made on two 
bases. The first is that the technological risk is still considered tolerable and that 
strategies are in place to manage this risk. The second is that the benefits of use 
continue to outweigh the costs. This should factor in the probability of the risk caus‑
ing an incident and/or the losses resulting from sub‑optimal productivity. There may 
or may not be hidden costs depending on what the organisation is measuring. The 
soundness of such decisions depends on the risk‑based assumptions that have been 
made. A precautionary approach should be taken as organisations may gloss over the 
risk of failure.
The problem may be that factors that predispose the organisation to failure 
may not be measured simply because entropic risk prevention isn’t part 
of the language of current organisations.
If it can be accepted that technologies suffer from degradation and if this is left 
uncorrected, a failure will happen, then there should be a more concerted effort to 
monitor degradation. Some large organisations are doing this using big data ana‑
lytics, but smaller businesses either don’t have access to the required resources or 
awareness of the need and consequences of inaction. Corporations are reporting the 
benefits with the biggest opportunities coming from the ability to predict what will 
happen, instead of recording what has happened or is happening (BP, 2014).
Technologies with significant levels of entropic and/or residual risk potentially 
have several negative impacts on productivity and safety. These include equipment 
downtime. Assuming the technology remains operational, degradation can lead to 
sub‑optimal output, for example, an electric shovel (large‑scale mining equipment) 
won’t operate as efficiently if its hydraulic components are badly worn. In turn, this 
places higher demands on the operator to achieve the same output despite mechani‑
cal constraints.Technology 89
Degradation of technology may also lead to sub‑optimal interaction with the 
physical environment. As a simple example, if the blade of a grader is damaged, 
then the roads can’t be maintained to the required standard, which, in turn, could 
become problematic for vehicles driven on these roads. At the strategic level, the 
costs of degradation are not limited to those that are easily quantified such as loss of 
machine availability. There are also the non‑accounted costs of sub‑optimal output 
and increased demands on other systems of production.
MANAGING TECHNOLOGICAL RISKS
The Entropy Model can be used as a reference point for decisions related to risk, 
mechanical tolerances and operability. It’s common practice to push additional out‑
put or machine availability in production environments, but when does this become 
risky? The predictable behaviours of technologies are probably the easiest system 
of production to gauge changes in entropic risk. Concerning triggers include break‑
downs, lack of redundancy, reduced production output and other production key per‑
formance indicators (KPIs).
The critical issue strategically is when should management push the 
alarm button if there are concerning trends in operational losses such as 
breakdowns and lower than expected production output, bearing in mind 
that the next loss could include a fatality or serious injury.
The nature of risk is that in most circumstances, the organisation will continue to per‑
form but not necessarily to the standard expected. In addition, just because a situation 
shifts towards unsafe margins, it’s not certain that an injury will be one of the losses 
incurred. The losses may be limited to production downtime due to technology issues. 
An event may pass without even a near‑miss being recorded as such classified events 
require a judgement regarding proximity of a person. In practice, it’s easy enough to 
state that the person was faraway enough to be out of the ‘line of fire’ and therefore not 
at risk. This would save time and effort required to undertake a safety investigation.
From a risk management perspective, an organisation that relies on its technol‑
ogy for production output should be preoccupied with failure. This fixation is one 
of the principles of those enterprises considered to be high‑reliability organisations 
(HROs). HROs achieve nearly error‑free operations over long time periods and main‑
tain high levels of safety whilst operating in complex, uncertain, high‑risk and haz‑
ardous environments (Roberts, 1990). An HRO has the capacity to anticipate and 
prevent undesirable and unexpected events by focusing on the proactive mitigation of 
risk rather than on responding to errors after these occur. If an unanticipated event 
occurs, it has the capability to firstly, cope with and contain errors from intensifying 
and secondly, restoring system functioning (Weick et al., 1999; Weick and Sutcliffe, 
2007). Effective HROs apply five principles. These are:
1. Preoccupation with failure
2. Reluctance to simplify90 Productive Safety Management
3. Sensitivity to operations
4. Commitment to resilience
5. Deference to expertise
In this chapter, the focus will be primarily on the preoccupation with failure as it relates 
to technological risks; however, the other principles will be explained progressively 
throughout the rest of this edition, and detailed analysis will be provided in Chapter 10.
Figure 4.1 has been developed using the Entropy Model to illustrate how this fixa‑
tion may affect operational risk‑based decision‑making in relation to taking correc‑
tive action when technological degradation is identified. This figure is a version of the 
Entropy Model so follows the same steps as described earlier. The difference is that 
the primary focus is on technology in isolation from the other three systems of produc‑
tion. For this reason, the first column only includes technology. The level of risk is zero 
which is an unrealistic paradigm. Reality is shown in the next section where there is a 
level of residual risk. This is consistent in the short‑term due to knowledge and finan‑
cial constraints, for instance, the high cost of plant replacements and modifications.
As technological degradation occurs (the downward dashed line), the entropic 
risk rises (the upward solid line). In the original Entropy Model, this would continue 
until losses become inevitable. After incurring such loss/es, the organisation takes 
corrective action followed by maintenance practices to achieve optimisation. In the 
figure, the enterprise that has a preoccupation with failure is continually monitor‑
ing technological degradation, and takes corrective action ahead of the escalation of 
entropic risk. This is shown for the arrow pointing to the left indicating correction is 
brought forward to achieve control.
Maintenance is also more proactively driven by understanding the high risks 
of failure, as shown by the upward dashed line in the ‘maintenance to defined

tolerances’ phase. This would likely be more rigorous than simply following the orig‑
inal equipment manufacturer’s instructions. The example illustrates an organisation 
that is concerned about the reliability and safety of its technologies.
By adding a principle of HRO behaviour – preoccupation with failure – the 
Entropy Model integrates production, safety, quality and reliability in a 
way that is readily understood operationally.
The same rationale may apply strategically. If senior management receives concern‑
ing data about operational performance across multiple functions, this should raise 
wariness to chronic levels. In HROs, this would certainly be the case. It’s in rela‑
tion to new and emerging technologies that the need for monitoring of degradation 
becomes even more important than for traditional, predictable, energy‑based plant 
and equipment. These new technologies may introduce risks that aren’t fully appreci‑
ated by society (or the enterprise) and therefore, the singular concept of ‘risk’, being 
the ‘effect of uncertainty on objectives’ needs to be refined.
Uncertainty has replaced probability and can be classified into two types – aleatory 
uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. The former refers to inherent randomness or 
variability in a system or process, where the outcome cannot be predicted with assur‑
ance but can be described using probability distributions (Aven, 2016), like the roll 
of dice. Epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of background information about 
an event, system, or process (Yoe, 2019; Aven, 2016). For example, if a new disease 
emerges and there is limited information about its transmission and mortality rates…
Taleb (2007) uses the term ‘black swan’ to refer to these unpredictable and unfore‑
seen events that are rare and have a significant impact on society, organizations, or 
individuals. Aven and Krohn (2014) include these black swans as unknown unknowns 
in their categorization
(Aven, 2017; Lindhout et al., 2020)
1. Known Knowns: The events that are already known and understood in risk 
analysis and confidently used in decision‑making based on experiences or 
well‑established facts.
2. Known‑Unknowns: The events are known and are on the list of risk sources 
but are considered to have a negligible probability of occurrence and are 
thus ignored. Tsunami events were known in Japan, however due to judge‑
ment of an extremely low probability of occurrence were not considered a 
risk to Fukushima nuclear power plant (Aven, 2017).
3. Unknown Knowns: The events are not known to the analysts who conducted 
the risk assessment. They are either outside their realm of knowledge or they 
did not conduct a thorough risk analysis, but the events are known to others.
4. Unknown Unknowns: The events lie outside the realm of current knowl‑
edge, are unknown to the analysts and unknown to others. For example, a 
new and previously unknown virus outbreak, a sudden market crash, or a 
groundbreaking scientific discovery.
(Van der Stap and Qureshi, 2024)92 Productive Safety Management
These four categorisations of risk are worth noting especially in the context of the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution discussed later in this chapter. Managing current tech‑
nological residual and entropic risks shouldn’t be problematic as these should fall 
into the category of known knowns for most organisations.
The discussions so far have implied that new technology is intrinsically safer than 
old technology. This may not always be the case plus it’s possible for the reverse to 
be true in the short‑term. The introduction of new equipment changes the risk to 
which workers are exposed because of interaction with other systems of production. 
Firstly, there is a negative impact on human resources. Current worker competen‑
cies may be inadequate to ensure safe, efficient operation using the new equipment. 
Personnel need time to become familiar with the change and this may cause degra‑
dation of the human resources system of production in the immediate term. Change 
control strategies must consider these risks by providing pre‑operational training 
and practice to accelerate the learning curve, as well as additional support from 
supervisors.
Part of change management will likely involve the impact on processes and the 
need for new operational work procedures to be developed and implemented, in con‑
sultation with those who’ll do the work. The physical workplace may need modifi‑
cation, for instance, additional ventilation, climate control, vibration protection or 
security measures. The procurement function should be consulted to manage new 
supplier relationships (such as service agents) and spare parts inventories. A risk 
assessment process must be part of the change management strategy; however, in 
many businesses, this is either expedited or overlooked completely.
CASE STUDIES: TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS
Relationships with major suppliers of technology can be a significant part of the risk 
management strategy for organisations that are heavily reliant on plant, equipment, 
and infrastructure to deliver core business. This should go beyond the simple provi‑
sion of information as described in OSH legislation.
There should be greater transparency between customers and suppliers 
to prevent technological failures and to generate learning industries.
There are numerous examples where the lessons came because of regulatory investi‑
gation after the fact. It would be expected today that the management of these known 
knowns should be a shared responsibility amongst the various stakeholders in indus‑
tries. The following three aviation incidents are an example of root cause common‑
alities that if better communications capability had been available at the time should 
have prevented the second and third incidents.
The first crash occurred in 1999 in Australia. The pilot of a Beechcraft Super King 
Air suffered hypoxia. The Australia Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) recommended 
an aural warning to be fitted to these aircraft. They also proposed that authorities 
issue a directive for an immediate check of the fitting of passenger oxygen system 
mask container doors on all such aircraft and, all other aircraft with similar equip‑
ment (Wikipedia, 2024, 2000 Australia Beechcraft King Air crash – Wikipedia).Technology 93
The second occurred in 1999 when a Learjet 35 business jet was flying from 
Florida to Texas. The aircraft lost cabin pressure and the six people on board were 
incapacitated by hypoxia. The incident is mostly remembered because the golfer, 
Payne Stewart, was onboard. Fighter jets were sent after the plane and the pilots 
noticed no structural damage. The windows, however, were frosted indicating the 
temperature inside was well below zero degrees (Wikipedia, 2024, 1999 South 
Dakota Learjet crash – Wikipedia).
Later, on 4 September 2000, a similar type of aircraft was involved in another 
disaster (Wikipedia, 2024, 2000 Australia Beechcraft King Air crash – Wikipedia) 
and was referred to as the ‘ghost flight’. The findings of the investigation were incon‑
clusive, but evidence suggested hypoxia. The likely causes were depressurisation of 
the aircraft and lack of aural warning system. For this third incident, the ATSB rec‑
ommended aural alarm systems and low‑cost flight data recorders for all pressurised 
aircraft. The earlier incidents should have prompted greater attention to these matters 
at the time. These incidents identified design deficiencies which more broadly, points 
to the need to include supplier relationships in the enterprise’s risk profile. With the 
availability of worldwide communications, these relationships and information shar‑
ing should be readily achievable.
Other historic incidents highlight the need for risk assessment beyond the gates of 
the operation. For instance, there should be regular review of the dynamics outside 
a facility. The risk profile of an entire site can change with time in relation to its sur‑
roundings. An example is the explosion of a fireworks site in Enschede, Netherlands, 
on 13 May 2000 (Wikipedia, 2024, Enschede fireworks disaster  –  Wikipedia). 
Twenty‑three people were killed and a further 950 injured when a warehouse storing 
fireworks exploded near a residential area. The original permit to store these goods 
was granted in 1977, when the surrounding area was not so heavily populated, and 
subsequently renewed three times, without a review of the changing risk profile sur‑
rounding the facility.
The most notable example of these infrastructure‑related technological risks 
contributing to a major disaster is Bhopal. On the night of 2 December 1984, in 
Bhopal, India, a gas leak from a small pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide 
Corporation led to the immediate death of 2,259 people and injuries to a further 
574,366 (Wikipedia, 2024, Bhopal disaster – Wikipedia). The incident resulted from 
the largely unrealised dangers associated with the manufacture of the highly toxic 
chemical, methyl isocyanate (MIC). The immediate cause of the MIC leak was an 
influx of water into the chemical storage tank but there were several catalysts adding 
to this including drought, agricultural economics, and the mismanagement of entro‑
pic and residual risk factors. One of the most significant factors was an excessively 
large inventory of hazardous substances causing the inherent dangers to be extremely 
high. The severity of the mismatch between the technological design of the plant 
and storage conditions with environmental factors therefore largely determined the 
extent of this disastrous event.
It’s become evident from these discussions that the traditional approach to build‑
ing a risk register based on physical hazards is grossly outdated. ‘Hazards’ are a 
narrow risk type within the broader context of the impact of the organisation and its 
operations on the community. This becomes an even greater field when considering 94 Productive Safety Management
product safety, the operational environmental footprint and the further reaching con‑
siderations within the ESG Agenda.
The granular risk detail remains important, but the bandwidth of 
risk‑related professions has broadened and requires a 360‑degree 
perspective vertically and horizontally, especially in response 
to changes in technology.
THE HUMAN–TECHNOLOGY INTERFACE
There’s extensive literature on the human–technology interface including the field of 
ergonomics. The critical issues include fit between operator and machine along with 
exposure time associated with ergonomic risks. Some of the key areas have included 
use of computers, impacts of sedentary work and software driven monitoring pro‑
grammes. Some of these are for the proactive benefit of the user such as scheduled 
breaks and exercises, whilst others may be thinly disguised productivity monitoring.
The ‘quality’ of either system has an impact on the other. For instance, poorly 
maintained plant puts additional demands on the operator, whilst an aggressive oper‑
ator will increase the wear and tear on plant brakes and gears. The condition of the 
physical environment adds further risk variables to the person–machine interface. 
Process design is the final system of production to consider. For instance, a large 
mine truck will be designed to carry a certain tonnage capacity. The procedure may 
set some parameters for load limits and correct loading; however, there will be vari‑
ability in the execution of this practice. The same applies to heavy vehicles on public 
roads where the issue is probably more problematic in under‑regulated jurisdictions 
because of the desire to reduce costs of transporting goods and materials.
The challenge is that many of the risks of pushing the tolerances of technologies 
are unseen to the operator plus, in the context of production or schedule pressures, 
these may be marginalised in the decision‑making process. A list of additional risks 
can be found in this South African Mine Safety article (Mining Safety, 2023) and 
includes:
• The vehicle will be less stable, difficult to steer and take longer to stop. 
Vehicles react differently when the maximum weights which they are 
designed to carry are exceeded.
• Overloaded vehicles can cause the tyres to overheat and wear rapidly which 
increases the chance of premature, dangerous and expensive failure or 
blow‑outs.
• The driver’s control and operating space in the overloaded vehicle is dimin‑
ished, escalating the chances for an accident.
• The overloaded vehicle cannot accelerate as normal – making it difficult to 
overtake.
• At night, the headlights of an overloaded vehicle will tilt up, blinding oncom‑
ing drivers to possible debris or obstructions on the roadway.
• Brakes have to work harder due to ‘the riding of brakes’ and because the 
vehicle is heavier due to overloading. Brakes overheat and lose their effec‑
tiveness to stop the car.Technology 95
• With overloading, seat belts are often not used as the aim is to pack in as 
many persons as possible into the vehicle.
• The whole suspension system comes under stress and, over time, the weakest 
point can give way.
• By overloading your vehicle you will incur higher maintenance costs to the 
vehicle – tyres, brakes, shock absorbers and higher fuel consumption.
• Insurance cover on overloaded vehicles may be void as overloading is illegal.
(Mining Safety, 2023)
Studies have shown the effects of road and truck conditions on driver vigilance using 
Chaos Theory (Hocking and Thompson, 1992). Different scenarios can be com‑
pared. For instance, firstly, if the vehicle is in a poor condition and the road is in a 
fair condition, results showed stable oscillations in the driver’s vigilance. The opera‑
tor varied in attentiveness without any serious consequences and was able to manage 
the demands associated with the poor state of the vehicle. Secondly, the vehicle was 
in good condition and the road in bad repair. The effect on the operator was chaotic 
oscillations in vigilance and the possibility of an accident. This situation put very 
high demands on the driver and the inconsistency of these demands made it more 
difficult to make the necessary adjustments, for example when the road has a pothole 
or uneven surface. The risk of an accident was contained by the driver’s alertness, 
but this depended on their physical condition and competencies. The third scenario 
involved both the vehicle and road in bad condition. Chaotic oscillations in vigilance 
occurred and fell below the cut‑off point where an accident was certain. The study 
lends weight to the Entropy Model and rising entropic risk, if left uncorrected, result‑
ing in loss, which could include a safety incident and vehicle damage.
A table was provided in PSM1 of the strategies to manage risks associated with 
technology. It’s repeated here as Table 4.1 to clarify the interfaces with other systems 
of production. These are where the complexities and dynamic nature of risk become 
evident, as described in the previous driving example. Since the publication of PSM1, 
there have been significant improvements in engineering which would support the 
examples of operational risk mitigations provided. There may be others that haven’t 
been included.
The table separates strategies for residual and entropic risk management. Under 
residual risks, there are four main areas. The first is design and manufacturing short‑
comings of a technology. As discussed earlier, cost becomes a factor which deter‑
mines the residual risk of a piece of plant or equipment. At the procurement phase, 
the enterprise should evaluate health, safety, environment, and quality (HSEQ) 
features of technological options as well at reliability and performance histories. 
Relationships should be established with suppliers to ensure that up‑to‑date informa‑
tion is available on the selected product. Once operational, the technology’s perfor‑
mance should be monitored using data analytics.
The remaining three sources of risk are at the interface between the technology 
and each of the other systems of production, as shown. The fit between vehicle and 
road for instance is important, and this involves design and planning of the physi‑
cal environment. When installing new equipment, risk factors and potential hazards 
should be evaluated and undertaken in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. 96 Productive Safety Management

Thereafter, there should be specific workplace safety standards for managing these 
residual risks.
Technologies must be selected that are suitable for the processes or tasks required 
to be undertaken. Where possible, multiples of the same or similar plant and equip‑
ment should be purchased to exploit economies of standardisation. In the short‑term, Technology 97
some processes may need to be modified to document the safe, efficient use of new 
equipment. Over the longer‑term, plant modifications may reduce the residual risk.
Finally, the management of residual risk at the technology – human resources, 
again starts with procurement to optimise the fit at the interface. Modifications may 
be required to suit the individual operator, or if not possible, the job may need to be 
adapted to reduce exposure time, for instance, to whole body vibration when operat‑
ing a piece of mobile plant. Where the technology has residual risks with fatality, 
serious injury or debilitating illness potential, these risks must be managed through 
major hazards or fatal risks critical control programmes.
The table shows that the two areas of technological entropic risk are firstly, wear 
and tear, and secondly, the technology‑operator interface. The former is countered 
through proactive scheduled maintenance, regular monitoring of the equipment, 
planned replacements of parts and reactive maintenance. The fit between the operator 
and plant to prevent degradation is best managed through pre‑operational training, 
refresher courses where needed, a culture of looking after equipment and correction 
of inappropriate operation such as supervision or coaching.
In today’s business environment, the risks from supply chain and 
procurement are critical inputs to operational risk management and the 
organisation’s capacity to sustain safe, efficient production.
According to McKinsey and Company, there are two concerns within the supply 
chain – absolute shortage risk and supplier risk. They explain that the risk of the 
former means products are unavailable in the quantities needed, irrespective of the 
price offered (McKinsey & Company, 2022). The latter involves individual suppli‑
ers defaulting. The procurement risk involves inflation where the products remain 
available but become more expensive. This is less of a concern for professions such 
as OSH but needs to be understood from the perspective of overall competition for 
scarce resources and the potential impact on the enterprise’s total risk profile. For 
instance, higher costs of spare parts may be compensated for by a cut in the training 
budget.
There are strong commonalities between the procurement and OSH functions, 
regarding their relationship with production. Both serve to support core business by 
contributing to continuity of operations. In an article about procurement by McKinsey 
and Company, they advise on the need for early warning systems ahead of the next 
disruption. The procurement strategy should be on a continuum with ‘continuity risk’ 
being the highest level of concern and ‘no immediate danger’ being at the other end.
standardisation
Standardisation is a widely practised approach to managing risks and has provided 
numerous opportunities at the person–machine interface. For example, there are 
various studies across industries including the medical profession.
Standardization of operative equipment can result in a significant cost reduction with‑
out impacting quality or delivery of care. Based on average case number per year, a 98 Productive Safety Management
total annual cost savings of > $41,000 could be realized. Survey participants agree that 
standardization improves cost and patient safety…
(Avansino et al., 2013)
The focus of standardisation in production environments involves the procurement 
of same types of plant and vehicles to have a fleet for which the maintenance proce‑
dures, holding of spare parts and the required skills of mechanics become consistent. 
This, in turn, increases efficiency and safety based on internal capability. Oil and 
Gas customers are using the supply chain to streamline procurement using consistent 
equipment specifications to reduce facility costs and schedule delays (Postema and 
Wish, 2019). The Joint Industry Programme 33 has been established to make this 
step change improvement for the industry by having a standard approach to procur‑
ing equipment including for safety (IOGP, 2023). The automotive and aviation sec‑
tors have had such processes in place for some time and it will be interesting to see 
whether this efficiency strategy has wider uptake in the future.
Regardless of organisational size, improvements to safety, quality and efficiency 
can be achieved through simplification and standardisation. For instance, on a farm, 
operations can benefit from as many types of plant and equipment as possible being 
diesel‑operated rather than having to store both diesel and petrol. There are effi‑
ciency (and safety) benefits from this approach.
More opportunities for improvement can be achieved by taking an 
operational perspective to workplace risk assessments than solely looking 
at safety, especially where capital investment is required.
Not surprisingly, general managers are more receptive to investing in recommenda‑
tions when reported in a way that directly relates to core business. For instance, at 
a poultry farm, the manager and supervisors were asked what their greatest frustra‑
tions were. One of the biggest issues was that because rats often ate through the 
electrical wiring, the lighting in the poultry sheds regularly failed. The cabling had 
been installed continuously which meant that if one small section was damaged, 
the whole system for the shed went out. This was a significant issue for production, 
which was how it was reported to the general manager by the safety manager who 
did the site visit. It was agreed that the system would be rewired in several series 
to ensure if one section failed, the rest of the system would be intact. All wiring 
would be installed correctly in solid conduit. This resolved a very serious safety mat‑
ter. Workers regularly washed down the sheds and it was possible that water could 
contact exposed electrical wires, causing electrocution. Tactics should be applied 
to achieve safety results through practical, operational improvements that directly 
impact core business.
MAINTENANCE OF TECHNOLOGY
The Entropy Model highlights the important of maintenance of systems of pro‑
duction. The links between the reliability of plant and equipment with safety and Technology 99
efficiency are irrefutable. The challenges from business to business in sustaining 
technological quality can be significant. Companies face different constraints and 
therefore their objectives will also vary. For instance, in some multinational mining 
companies that are well resourced and have large‑scale operations, the purpose of 
maintenance is to ensure high levels of output and safety in the medium‑term. These 
businesses may change technologies, including fleets, regularly to pursue econo‑
mies of scale. Concurrently, they’re potentially also reducing residual risks due to 
improvements in safety in design with next‑generation plant, and exposure to entro‑
pic risks when the support services (including supplier relationships) are available to 
maintain the equipment.
In contrast, smaller‑scale operators can struggle. Scarce financial resources often 
force these businesses to get much longer life from technologies thus increasing their 
vulnerability to entropic risk. The purpose of maintenance in their situation is to 
extend the operational productivity of existing equipment. Such companies may need 
to be more proactive to manage higher residual risks and to counter the degradation 
of aging plant and equipment. If not careful, this can create a vicious cycle of pro‑
duction time, followed by downtime for maintenance, before returning to operational 
productivity.
In all organisations regardless of scale, the over‑riding issue is control. This 
involves maximising planned maintenance proportional to reactive maintenance. In 
the Entropy Model, reactive maintenance of technology is effectively a corrective 
action, but where there are trends of recurrent issues, this informs proactive schedul‑
ing ahead of critical safety margins and inefficiencies.
Rasmekomen and Parlikad (2014) discuss a generic approach to optimising main‑
tenance of multi‑component systems with degradation interactions. It’s likely that 
large organisations already have these complexities under control from an operational 
and safety risk management perspective. In their paper, the researchers reviewed the 
work of Dekker et  al. (1997) which breaks dependencies between components in 
multi‑component systems into three types:
• Economic dependencies covering group maintenance and opportunistic 
maintenance to influence maintenance costs;
• Structural dependencies where components in the system are functionally 
bonded so that maintenance requires dismantling or concurrent upkeep of 
various connected parts;
• Stochastic dependence where failure or degradation of a component can 
influence failure of or degradation of others (Dekker et al., 1997).
Importantly, optimisation of maintenance can be calculated for components which 
degrade and can influence failure of other components based on the data related to 
the deterioration. In the paper, the researchers looked at a petrochemical plant and 
the interdependencies of gas tubes feeding excess‑heated gas into a cold box unit. 
They were able to optimise maintenance thresholds. The inference for operations 
from studies such as these is that data analytics are allowing organisations to have 
greater understanding of what constitutes safe and reliable, and the point at which 
technology or its interconnected technologies, become unsafe and unreliable.100 Productive Safety Management
Performance‑based maintenance of machinery is common practice in advanced 
industries such as oil and gas. The process relies on detection and prediction of per‑
formance degradation (Zagorowska et al., 2020). Interestingly, existing mathematical 
modelling of this performance assumes decreases at a consistent rate. They indicate 
that some performance degradation can reverse itself such as when a turbomachine 
self‑cleans deposits on the blades under some conditions. The researchers suggest 
a dynamic ‘moving window approach’ to monitor technological degradation rather 
than assuming consistency. Referring to the Entropy Model in Figure 4.1, this sug‑
gests there could be fluctuations up and down along the degradation downward line 
and therefore, the entropic risk may also fluctuate. The overall principle of rising 
entropic risk however, remains sound.
A further area of technological risk management is whether to keep maintenance 
practices in‑house or to outsource this work. Use of contracted services can go 
through various cycles of decentralisation (to outside) to centralisation (in‑house). 
Historically, this has been a contentious issue particularly where the workforce is 
unionised as they prefer in‑house servicing to retain members’ jobs. The aviation 
industry has had challenges with the establishment of foreign repair stations. This has 
presented dilemmas for the Federal Aviation Administration in the USA and called 
for collaboration between international regulators. Olaganathan et al. (2020) under‑
took a study titled “Managing Safety Risks in Airline Maintenance Outsourcing”. 
They found that risks were complex and included:
• Lower standards of competencies, inefficiencies, deficiencies in the work 
environment and limited access to the internet and communication facilities;
• Cyber risks that pose a threat to safety such as electronic documentation and 
personal records;
• Differences in regulatory risks; and
• Use of unapproved parts.
The study found no strong evidence that using foreign repair stations to maintain the 
US carrier aircraft affected safety (Tang and Elias, 2012). It was believed that based 
on the study, if stakeholders work collaboratively and use maintenance data effec‑
tively, it will increase efficiency and reduce costs (Olaganathan et al., 2020). Another 
study done earlier came to a different conclusion:
The concluding section highlights the potential latent failures arising from poor main‑
tenance practice associated with outsourcing of aircraft maintenance to uncertified and 
poorly regulated shops.
(Quinlan et al., 2013)
There are a few lessons from the example above even though foreign outsourcing by 
the US Air Force is well beyond the realms of smaller‑scale organisations in the USA 
and elsewhere. Some of the notable risks are likely to apply even to SME’s looking to 
outsource the maintenance of their mobile production plant (e.g. trucks, water carts, 
graders etc). For instance, if this work is done off site, then the owner of the plant has 
little or no control over the work environment, the competencies of the tradespersons 
undertaking the work or the maintenance service providers in‑house record‑keeping.Technology 101
Outsourcing infers a transfer of risk but from an OSH legislative 
perspective, the expectation is that due diligence has been undertaken 
prior to the engagement of contractors including service providers.
The other risk factor worth noting is that the plant owner won’t necessarily know if the 
maintenance service provider has used genuine manufacturer’s parts or after‑market 
parts. This may or may not affect the residual risk of the plant nor affect future wear 
and tear; however, this should be verified as part of the owner’s or operator’s OSH 
duty. For larger organisations that intend to have an ongoing relationship with the 
maintenance service provider, a review of some type should be conducted. This may 
range from asking for tradespersons’ competency records and licences to operate, 
through to a site visit and audit. The action taken depends on the risk and local leg‑
islative requirements regarding ‘due diligence’ when ensuring WHS duties are met.
The technological risks described above are generally known knowns. The new 
and emerging technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution aren’t so 
predictable. These are discussed in the next section.
TECHNOLOGY IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
According to the World Economic Forum, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is a 
‘fundamental change in the way we live, work and relate to one another’ (World 
Economic Forum, 2023). They state:
There are three reasons why today’s transformations represent not merely a prolonga‑
tion of the Third Industrial Revolution but rather the arrival of a Fourth and distinct 
one: velocity, scope, and systems impact. The speed of current breakthroughs has no 
historical precedent. When compared with previous industrial revolutions, the Fourth 
is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost 
every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the 
transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.
(World Economic Forum, 2016)
Britannica provides a useful summary of key areas of change:
It’s important to appreciate that the Fourth Industrial Revolution involves a systemic 
change across many sectors and aspects of human life: the crosscutting impacts of 
emerging technologies are even more important than the exciting capabilities they 
represent. Our ability to edit the building blocks of life has recently been massively 
expanded by low‑cost gene sequencing and techniques such as CRISPR; artificial intel‑
ligence is augmenting processes and skill in every industry; neurotechnology is mak‑
ing unprecedented strides in how we can use and influence the brain as the last frontier 
of human biology; automation is disrupting century‑old transport and manufacturing 
paradigms; and technologies such as blockchain, used in executing cryptocurrency 
transactions, and smart materials are redefining and blurring the boundary between 
the digital and physical worlds.
(Schwab, 2023)

sequencing (CRISPR Service ‑ Creative Biolabs (creative‑biolabs.com))102 Productive Safety Management
Interestingly, a second use of ‘entropy’ is being applied within this revolutionary 
process to the area of information theoretic. The original concept was based around 
Shannon’s entropy and information which was developed from 1948 to 1951. This is 
the foundation of modern cryptography – the process of hiding or coding information 
so that only the audience it is intended for can read it (Kaspersky, 2023). Entropy is 
used to measure the probability of events and is particularly looking for anomalies to 
assess the collective change in probabilities. For instance, when mathematicians are 
studying language for artificial intelligence, they may detect neurological changes 
in people’s conversation but instead of using traditional techniques, they don’t know 
what they’re looking for.
The older style of thinking about the world is to look for knowns, 
measure it and/or fix it. In the new style, the assumption is not knowing 
what to look for.
What is now more important is to look for unusual trends.
This concept is important in complex systems such as those that use artificial intel‑
ligence (AI) because of the need to measure unseen and unknowable risks. In the past 
way of measuring old known known technological risks, a measure was developed 
to predict failure and if the variable moved beyond a certain value, an intervention is 
taken. With AI, scientists are looking for tiny changes that indicate something may 
be going wrong without having to wait for large amounts of data to support this con‑
clusion. What is inferred is that businesses should be looking for matters that are out 
of place when these new technologies have been implemented.
There have been several applications of the mathematical approach to Entropy 
Theory to evaluate OSH. For instance, Dunwen et al. (2012) applied it to building 
construction safety. They stated:
To improve the safety management level of construction site, a new kind of safety 
evaluation method using the combination of fuzzy mathematics and the entropy theory 
was put forward…The results show that the hybrid method, which can overcome the 
shortcomings of each single method, is feasible, practical and operational in construc‑
tion site safety assessment.
(Dunwen et al., 2012)
With the guidance of Dr Andrew Back, advance research fellow in artificial intel‑
ligence, from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University 
of Queensland, Australia, the following five key industrial trends were identified. 
These are visualised from an operational risk and safety perspective based on the 
author’s interpretation of what the future might look like.
trend 1 – Human–maCHine Cooperation
Future work will involve people working cooperatively with machines. This is 
increasingly common today in support of people with impairments and in this regard, Technology 103
there is extensive literature. What is unknown is what this will entail in workplaces 
of the near future and what the safety and productivity risks will be. People tire but 
machines don’t so how will the pace of work be determined? Perhaps the human’s 
eyes will be monitored for fatigue but the other subtleties such as stress, may be the 
real issues. This must be considered given that OSH legislation has recently included 
psychosocial harm as a workplace risk that has to be managed by the organisation.
It’s also accepted in the OSH profession that people will work around rules and 
deviances can become normalised. If a machine works in a predictable way such 
as automated passenger vans that take personnel to different areas of the site along 
known routes at specific times, then there is a risk that human drivers will make 
judgements about ‘safe’ distances for passing in front of automated vehicles. Rules 
may be implemented but, for instance, a 20 second rule, may be interpreted as a 
slow 20 seconds or a quick 20 seconds (if left to people to count) unless that’s also 
measured.
The question is how the risk assessment will be done ahead of the introduction of 
technological changes, and how will human behaviour be predicted including devi‑
ances. As a simple example, drivers already make such judgements when approach‑
ing traffic lights that turn amber. Do they stop or proceed? Many factors go into this 
instantaneous decision including speed, distance, other nearby vehicles, the traffic 
ahead (whether it’s moving or not) and if a police vehicle is in the vicinity. If a person 
is working with a machine that operates in a predictable way, there will be behav‑
ioural choices available that may push safety margins. The use of monitoring may 
be needed to ensure compliance, but this would be a significant regression in OSH 
management practice which is centred on a culture of trust.
trend 2 – BalanCe of power in Human–maCHine systems
The second related trend comes about because humans and machines communicate 
differently. Humans relate on both task and social bases which isn’t set to a consistent 
pattern but happens as needed or spontaneously. Working with a machine would be 
an impediment to this so the issue is, will the human have the power to ‘pause’ the 
machine or will humans have to adapt/ suppress their natural tendencies within this 
hybrid work environment. Perhaps, the precursory conditioning will have occurred 
through the current generations’ close relationship with their mobile phone.
In a broader context, there are likely to be issues related to locus of control. People 
have no control over the technology or the disruption from this major transforma‑
tion (Xu et al., 2018). For instance, as machines are complex systems designed by 
engineers which are then imposed on the target work group, there may be poor fit 
because of different perspectives of the work between the engineers who design the 
machines and those who work with the machines. This adds a whole new dimension 
to ‘Work as Imagined’ and ‘Work as Done’. All the procedural controls will follow 
the engineered model, perhaps eliminating the need for consultation with worker. 
Consultation and participation are currently corner stones of ‘enabling’ OSH legisla‑
tion based on duty of care principles. Workers may feel that they have less and less 
control within the workplace. Historically, changes occurred gradually, and work‑
ers had time to adapt, whereas the near future demands a different competency set 104 Productive Safety Management
focused on flexibility and transferability of capabilities including to unknown con‑
texts and learning environments.
Some jobs will be threatened by automation, but human work overall will remain 
central to organisational performance. Routine jobs with a high volume of tasks 
related to information exchange, sales, data management, manual work, construc‑
tion and office work are more exposed to the risk of automation (Grau and Wang, 
2020). In this regard, as the transformation progresses, it will be interesting to review 
data on the impact across countries and by industry within countries. The World 
Economic Forum provides regular articles on latest developments (World Economic 
Forum, 2023).
trend 3 – nonlinearity of Complex maCHine adoption
Traditionally, risk has been reasonably predictable because systems of production 
have behaved in linear ways. For instance, the rates of degradation of technology 
and infrastructure can be predicted to some extent, given a few known variables such 
as throughputs and hours of operation. Even human degradation has been studied 
such as physical and mental fatigue over time. Ill‑health by type has a degree of 
predictable impact on employee absenteeism. This knowledgebase has built up with 
volumes of data analysed statistically.
The fourth industrial generation is much more complex. In the discussion earlier, 
the concept of stochastic dependence was raised. This was where failure or degrada‑
tion of a component can influence failure of or degradation of others (Dekker et al., 
1997). There may be unknown risks within these new highly complex systems such 
that failure of one component could break the entire system. If this is the case, then 
either the system will be fully usable or relegated to the scrap heap.
Highly complex systems could have unknown unknown risks that lead to 
total failure. The problem is that traditional approaches to risk assessment 
won’t detect these risks.
This presents significant challenges for operations utilising systems of production. 
If an operation becomes highly automated and the system goes down, for instance 
a fleet of autonomous trucks at an open pit mine site, will such trucks be capable 
of being operated manually? How will the company plan for a significant failure? 
It would be impractical and cost prohibitive to have a standby fleet with human 
drivers at the ready. This scenario highlights that ‘maintenance’ will have new 
dimensions –  traditional physical plant and equipment plus process instrumentation 
maintenance as well as AI systems. It seems that these complex systems and the 
interconnection of components and things, will introduce a different type of econ‑
omy of scale that will reap tremendous benefits if the system works as predicted, but 
potential for major failures if it doesn’t.
Earlier discussions talked about new projects and the residual risks and potential 
entropic risks inherited by operations because of risk‑based, cost‑benefit decisions 
made at the project planning stage. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is likely to 
bring technologies into the workplace that aren’t readily understood by operations. Technology 105
What these technologies produce will be visible in some way whether by inspec‑
tion or from data analytics, but the ‘mechanism’ of the system will be the realm of 
elite specialists. In that regard, it’s easier to accept that most people who drive a car 
don’t know about the transfers of energy that make it work, nor will the end‑user or 
co‑worker to the machine need to know how it operates, only what it does or can do.
trend 4 – trust Between agents and reliaBility of tHe wHole system
The fourth trend is a highly complicated issue of trust. How ready is society, from a 
values perspective, for these new technologies and AI, in particular? The fundamental 
question is to what extent will this new industrial revolution serve humanity – what 
value will it bring. The highly unpredictable nature of this transformation is likely to 
make sectors in society nervous.
It’s uncertain at this time, how operational risk will be assessed when these new 
technologies are introduced to the workplace. Will workers ‘comply’ with the system 
or create workarounds that undermine it? The availability of social media means 
that a single voice of dissent can become a wider campaign of resistance. Traditional 
language associated with management of change will likely become redundant. How 
will new human‑machine operations be ‘socialised’? Will change be done in a test 
environment or done cart blanche, given issues such as the pressure on management 
to act quickly or miss a perceived opportunity? As discussed in Chapter 3, some 
major corporations tend to set industry standards which then becomes an expectation 
of other organisations including contractors. The challenge is that once the standard 
is set, it becomes ‘general knowledge’ and captured within the enabling clauses of 
OSH legislation’s ‘duty of care’ or ‘WHS duty’.
Many traditional technologies were able to be tried and tested on a small scale 
before implementation across operations. The potential investments involved in new 
technologies may be difficult to revert from once management’s commitment has 
been made. Alternatively, it may be that fears of change and loss of control will be 
exaggerated and humans will continue to be self‑serving but with a better apprecia‑
tion of global impacts as the ESG Agenda grows concurrently. Some commentators 
have highlighted that there needs to be a balance of industrial progress with social 
progress within this fourth industrial revolution that was deficient in previous revolu‑
tions (Mulgan, 2021).
trend 5 – privaCy vs effiCienCy
A fifth issue will likely be cyber security trends. A current ethical conflict is the 
demand for privacy and security, which is now becoming at odds with the way in 
which systems are being built. An example is current software which monitors how 
people work in the office environment, which is likely to extend to factories and 
other workplaces. The push for greater efficiency may be met with resistance against 
being measured and observed. This is already problematic with the use of CCTV. 
An example was provided in earlier chapters of the traditional production line where 
co‑workers failed to assist an injured worker due to production pressures and lack 
of worker control over the pace of the production process. In this case, CCTV was 106 Productive Safety Management
a clear visual means of monitoring, whereas new technologies will be increasingly 
covert.
The monitoring of people will likely create a greater divide between 
management and workers.
The risk to safety and efficiency may be systems that work but are 
introduced for the wrong reasons or have counter‑productive consequences.
Broader issues in risk‑Based deCision‑making
An article in Risk Management Magazine (2022) discussed unintended consequences 
of new working models that resulted from the COVID‑19 pandemic, including the 
‘Great Resignation’. Businesses have struggled since to manage their talent risk and 
maintain an organisational culture. There appears to be a trend towards increasing 
enterprise risk appetite, but this presents a quandary as in one survey it was found 
that 69% of significant business decisions were not risk informed. Shrinkman states:
Organizations face potentially steeper consequences from such decisions. According to 
Gartner’s analysis, nearly one in three decisions at the senior executive level can have 
an adverse effect on key stakeholders, and 19% of decisions made at this level could 
invite increased regulatory scrutiny.
(Shrinkman, 2022)
In the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the pace of change means that 
Executive and Senior Managers won’t be able to wait for more data to make decisions. 
It’s suggested that a different approach is needed which involves ‘sense‑ making’. 
This has four key elements:
1. Synthesizing risk information from disparate sources and providing a 
weight to the information to establish context;
2. Prioritising the most relevant risk information to make key considerations 
more obvious;
3. Helping decision‑makers apply the information in the organisational 
context;
4. Preparing decision‑makers to make sense of risk information independently.
(Shrinkman, 2022)
Along with the growth in AI for beneficial purposes, are rapidly evolving malicious 
AI actors and cyber attackers (Wagner and Furst, 2018). This is a risk that resides at 
the enterprise risk management level, but the consequences for operations and support 
functions such as OSH and environmental management should also be considered. The 
questions include: If the system fails, where will people be, and will this put them in 
danger? What response plans need to be in place for different system failure scenarios? 
How will contingency plans affect the various functions of the organisation?Technology 107
Finally and perhaps cynically, the OSH profession has spent the last 20 years 
(along with other functions), driving the need for worker input and feedback to reach 
management. This is a cyclical process where input from operations results either 
in actions taken by senior management or at least, a response regarding why action 
might not be feasible. This is a pragmatic approach to continual improvement. With 
the rapid advancement of AI, how will this top‑down bottom‑up communication 
continue?
How will workers raise legitimate concerns about the functionality of AI in 
the workplace? Will it be trivialised because it’s assumed that AI is right?
Will management be receptive to ‘dumb’ questions (which may in fact 
be the best to ask)?
SUMMARY
Current and future technologies have been the focus of this chapter. Despite signifi‑
cant changes occurring in the industrial world, there remains the need for more effec‑
tive management of residual and entropic risks to pursue continuity of production, 
quality outputs and HSE performance. The fundamentals of HSE in design, quality 
of componentry and standards of construction and commissioning are critical inputs 
to the facilities that operations inherit. It was explained that these project planning 
decisions determine the residual risks and potential entropic risks that need to be 
mitigated during the operational phase of a facility’s lifecycle.
One of the significant issues that was raised is that organisations may have a pre‑
disposition to failure because entropic risk prevention is not part of the language of 
operations. The solution provided was the adoption of the five principles of HROs, 
in particular, preoccupation with failure. This should provide the impetus for greater 
transparency across organisations and industries using global communications capa‑
bilities, to learn and act in the interests of preventing disasters. This is urgent with 
the rapid emergence of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies that will have 
unknown unknown risks.
Whilst the OSH and other risk‑related professions have made solid progress in the 
last 20 years to create alignment with other disciplines such as engineering, HRM, 
quality and environmental management, that’s insufficient for this new more com‑
plicated world. A 360‑degree perspective scanning vertically and horizontally will 
enable such professionals to better appreciate supply chain complexities and the influ‑
ence of other stakeholders (both internal and external) on the future of their work. 
This includes a better appreciation of enterprise level risk‑based decision‑making 
affecting technological choices. Some of the key themes were standardisation, the 
broadening of what constitutes technological maintenance and whether such work is 
done in‑house or outsourced.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming the human‑technology interface. 
This is likely to add greater dynamism and intricacies. Traditional man‑machine fit 
was based on ergonomics but in future, it also must include psychosocial risk factors 108 Productive Safety Management
such as locus of control. Much of the progress in the OSH and HR professions in 
the last 20 years has been centred on increasing levels of consultation and participa‑
tion in operational risk management and continual improvement more broadly. The 
impact of AI could pressure these strategies, putting more faith in AI reliability than 
human innovation and initiative.
The final area that was discussed in this chapter was the limitations of tradi‑
tional enterprise risk management practices. As raised by other commentators, 
there’s a definite need to shift towards ‘sense‑making’ as the foundation of risk‑based 
 decision‑making, especially in the context of increasing unknown unknown risks as 
mankind ventures into untested technological realms.
The following chapter will continue the exploration of the systems of production 
by looking at residual and entropic risks associated with the physical environment 
/ workplace, before presenting the final chapter of this series on human resources 
risks.

RESIDUAL RISK AND DESIGN
The physical environment (PE) includes infrastructure and locational factors such as 
the natural features of the site, including topography, flora and fauna, climate, and 
ground conditions. The risk assessment for this system of production should be done 
on four levels. The first is the immediate work environment where the task is being 
undertaken. The second is the site level whilst the third includes the nearby sur‑
roundings of each operation covering neighbouring properties and an understanding 
of the risks associated with the area. For instance, a vehicle service facility will have 
risks within the site but if an explosives factory is 500 metres away, that risk should 
also be a concern in case of an incident and the need for local evacuation. The final 
level is regional which takes into consideration the potential for natural disasters such 
as floods, cyclones/hurricanes and bushfire.
The organisation is legally required to manage the risks associated with the 
physical environment, as far as practicable, to prevent injuries to workers 
and other persons on site. This obligation extends to potential consequences 
like injuries to the public and damage to infrastructure and natural systems 
located outside operational boundaries.
The Channel described in Chapter 2 explained that the enterprise is required to be 
both legally compliant and socially responsible. In most developed countries, there 
are stringent controls to ensure that organisations operate conscientiously to prevent 
negative impacts to the environment within the operational site and beyond the gates. 
It’s in this area of risk control that there is a strong relationship between OSH and 
environmental management.
Historically, the connection between the two functions has been well‑accepted. 
Case studies undertaken in the Netherlands and Denmark indicated that OSH and 
environmental management are linked. On a technical basis, this stems from the 
notion that hazard sources are similar and therefore these programmes have syner‑
gies (Kamp and Le Bansch, 1998). When managing PE risks using an OHS manage‑
ment system, this may concurrently contribute to the prevention of environmental 
damage. Likewise environmental management strategies can have a positive impact 
on health and safety, for instance, emission controls provide safer atmospheres for 
surrounding communities as well as workers. In the past, there was some reluctance 
to integrate these disciplines. For instance:
Much stronger than is the case for OHS management, in environmental management 
there is an emphasis on external control, a requirement of supply chain management, 
and of responsibility for product effects during their entire life cycle. As a consequence, 
110 DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-6Physical Environment 111
the material topics that are dealt with in environmental management may have stronger 
links to all pervasive risks – and thus to strategic company issues – than those on OHS 
management.
(Kamp and Le Bansch, 1998)
As discussed previously, the concept of integrated management systems has now 
widely been accepted, with this reinforced by the commonalities between the ISO 
Standards 45001 (safety), 14001 (environment) and 9001 (quality). From a cultural 
perspective, there are robust alignments with the focus on mitigating losses, and in 
the case of HROs, preoccupation with failure. The Entropy Model with its central 
theme of loss prevention includes inefficiencies, safety incidents, quality deficiencies 
and environmental harm. The opportunity for seamlessness of these functions is 
attributable to the common driver of risk management.
OSH, environmental and quality management are also linked through the rela‑
tionship between organisations and their suppliers. In Chapter 4, it was suggested 
that stronger interdependencies should be developed involving information sharing 
to better manage risks by reducing product/ technological residual risks and the ten‑
dency of such goods to degrade. Through mutuality in the supply chain, there are 
more options to improve product development by responding to customer feedback 
and achieving higher standards of technology and workplace designs. Such improve‑
ments should contribute concurrently towards minimising negative environmental 
impacts of the organisation’s operations. OSH and environmental management both 
focus on maintaining the quality of the PE system of production to varying degrees.
These disciplines whilst overlapping must maintain respective specialist knowledge 
to prevent one management system being relegated to the other. Conceptually, a set 
of boundaries is needed to minimise role conflict and to promote a multi‑disciplinary 
approach with high degrees of expertise together with collaborative problem‑solving. 
In Chapter 4, a second principle of HROs that was briefly discussed was ‘deference 
to expertise’ in challenging times. A Venn diagram approach may be useful to clarify 
responsibilities for worker safety versus environmental impacts. For instance, control 
of groundwater runoff and leaching to the water table are unlikely to have a direct 
impact on worker health and safety. If however, the runoff creates a site hazard, then 
there will be the need for risk mitigations in both areas. Any uncertainty regarding 
roles and responsibilities can be addressed using a collaboratively developed HSE / 
EHS / Sustainability Management Plan.
The Enschede and Bhopal disasters discussed in Chapter 4 were examples where 
the surrounding communities were impacted by the respective company’s operations, 
not just the workers. There has been a long history of disasters where having operations 
in challenging environments has led to major incidents. These include mining opera‑
tions such as the Esmeralda cyanide spill in Romania in 2000 (ABC News, 2000), the 
Brumadinho upstream tailings dam collapse in 2019 (ABC News, 2019) and others as 
described by Piciullo et al. (2022). The researchers found that a lack of understanding of 
foundation ground conditions was a factor in several tailings dam failures. There were 
foundation problems resulting from lack of proper site investigation prior to construc‑
tion. The unknown risk caused by a weak foundation subsoil went undetected. This was 
exacerbated by deficiencies in the upstream and downstream construction methods.112 Productive Safety Management
In the paper, there were numerous variables related to tailings dam construction 
type. It should be borne in mind though that when it comes to the PE, more gener‑
ally, there may be the risk of ‘black swans’ (unknown unknowns) and incomplete 
data. For instance, geophysics analysis of ground conditions is based on sampling 
methods. There is also a problem of ambiguity in geophysical interpretation and 
many different geological configurations could reproduce the observed measure‑
ments (Keary et al., 2002). These types of uncertainties lead to further research to 
better understand unforeseeable risks. For instance, Duong (2023) discusses analysis 
of earthquakes and the risks these seismic events have on international tailings dam 
failures. There are monitoring regimes in place with stability assessments every two 
years and advancements now include improved strength estimations in the event of 
an earthquake. This involves assessing dam wall saturation levels against the risk 
of collapse.
When it comes to natural events such as earthquakes and cyclones/hurricanes, the 
risks are uncontrollable for organisations as there will always be limited informa‑
tion available to make risk‑based decisions. This was the case for instance, with the 
tsunamis that hit Japan in 2011 even though the power plant operators knew there 
was a risk but failed to appreciate the severity or likelihood (Stanford News, 2021).
Physical environment risks can be difficult to assess because most ‘what‑if’ 
scenarios will lead to the conclusion that the event could happen, but 
whether it warrants the resources for prevention becomes a contentious 
issue for decision‑makers.
These types of occurrences tend to result in reactive responses when needed at the 
time of potential crisis. It’s therefore important to consider where the organisation 
stands legally and ethically when disaster strikes to better understand the continuum 
of accountability  –  uncertainty  –  inculpability. The discussion below raises some 
considerations.
‘ACTS OF GOD’
The first issue is that risks that are beyond the control of the organisation, such as 
one in 100 year flood occurring more often than predicted, fall into the category of 
residual risks. Such risks according to the Entropy Model must be managed in the 
short term due to technological and financial constraints. In the longer‑term, the risk 
may be reduced through investment in better safety and environment in design. Such 
investment needs to occur according to the area of impact. Natural disasters need 
to be planned at the regional level whilst at the granular workplace level, it’s the 
responsibility of the site’s management. Overall, however, the principle of fit applies.
Risk management focuses on creating a better fit between man‑made 
systems and natural systems to prevent failures.
The second consideration is when does an event become an ‘Act of God’. This is 
where a standard of reasonableness must be applied. Diverting for a moment: there Physical Environment 113
is currently debate in the OSH profession about the avoidance of ‘blame culture’ 
(Sherratt et al., 2023). Commentators are suggesting that a ‘no‑blame culture’ is lead‑
ing to lack of accountability and a growth in incidents being categorised as ‘Acts of 
God’. This becomes problematic because almost every area in systems of production 
can be traced back to human input, whether that’s design, manufacture, maintenance 
or operation. Ascribing ‘no blame’, in the interests of fairness, can’t then only apply 
to workers. It must apply to engineers who design workplaces and technologies (such 
as tailings dams) and the managers who determine resources for maintenance, moni‑
toring, and other risk management practices.
The problem is that without accountability, there’s no learning from failures 
or successes. Calling an incident an ‘Act of God’ needs to be justifiable.
The question that emerges is: Should society accept that there is such a thing as an ‘Act 
of God’ and if so, using what criteria? The answer must be risk‑based. Undoubtedly, this 
is a topic for an entirely separate book which some researchers have aimed to address 
already, for instance, Faure et al., 2014–2015; Mercante, 2005–2006; and Swanson, 2013.
The test of ‘Act of God’ is most likely a legal one done on a case‑by‑case basis and 
therefore, the best advice is not to rely on this as a defence should the organisation 
suffer a major disaster. Where it becomes more complicated according to Schwartz 
(2020) is the legal doctrine of ‘Force Majeure’ which specifies what should happen in 
case of an ‘Act of God’ like the coronavirus. In the paper, the author predicts changes 
to these contractual clauses to ensure coverage of pandemics but warns there may be 
some undesirable consequences from a business perspective including modified pric‑
ing strategies. Hansen (2020) did a study of the COVID‑19 outbreak in terms of force 
majeure fundamental aspects and identified the following characteristics:
Unforeseeable – not reasonably foreseeable by parties when they are entering into 
the contract
Unavoidable  –  neither party could prevent the occurrence of the event or 
circumstance
Uncontrollable  –  incapability of contracting parties to control the event and its 
impact
Impracticable – the event and its impact have adversely affected the fulfillment of 
contractual obligations
Beyond responsibility – the event is not substantially attributable to a party
(Hansen, 2020)
These characteristics could well apply to all acts of nature or acts beyond human con‑
trol. When used as test criteria, they help to better define the PE system of production 
residual and entropic risks which are within the control of the organisation. A simple, 
reverse logic can be applied.
If it’s foreseeable, avoidable, controllable, practical and the organisation’s 
responsibility, it’s not an ‘Act of God’. Every other undesirable event 
resulting from the natural environment, should be subjected to scrutiny on a 
case‑by‑case basis.114 Productive Safety Management
MANAGING PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT RISKS
residual risks
Initially, the management of residual risks should focus on those risks for which 
there’s the potential for fatalities whether the source of risk is technological, the 
physical environment, human factors, the work method (process) or the foreseeable 
combinations of these. Companies describe these internal control requirements as 
‘major hazard standards’, ‘fatal risk protocols’ or similar. These documented safety 
critical controls are usually determined by a risk assessment method such as bowtie 
analysis. Numerous internet sites provide an explanation of how this method works 
including available software to support the process, for instance, from the UK Civil 
Aviation Authority (2023) and NC State Poole College of Management (2016).
As a summary, the bowtie has the major undesirable event at the middle of the 
bowtie shape, for instance, ground collapse or flooding of the site. On the left‑hand 
side are the preventative measures, some of which will be safety critical whilst oth‑
ers are non‑critical. An example of critical is using seismic monitoring and data 
analysis to send an alert well ahead of ground failure. On the right‑hand side of the 
major event, are the measures to mitigate the severity of the consequences. This 
will include having evacuation plans and rescue capability at the ready. The pro‑
cess then involves determining how often the critical controls need to be verified 
for adequacy and effectiveness. This is done through specific programmes such as 
inspection regimes or data gathering – whatever information provides evidence for 
the assurance process.
The approach to the development of standards for PE residual risks varies from 
country to country. In the USA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA, 2024) has developed standards by hazard type such as biological agents, earth‑
quakes and wildfire. In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive embed PE residual 
risks within guidance material for specific industries such as diving, fire and rescue, 
mining, and offshore oil and gas. For instance, for safe havens in underground mines, 
the documentation covers thermal environment, air supply and environmental moni‑
toring. Both OSHA and the Health and Safety Executive provide references to the 
relevant legislation. In Australia, there are extensive resources available for hazard 
management including ground/ strata instability, inundation and inrush, air quality and 
dust, gas outbursts, and ionising radiation (Australasian Mine Safety Journal, 2019).
One of the critical areas of PE residual risk management, at all four levels of 
risk assessment, is emergency response. Even in low‑risk workplaces such as offices, 
evacuation plans need to be in place and rehearsed on a regular basis. Planning for 
response in case of emergency should be an inherent part of the work. This becomes 
crucial the further the workplace is, in terms of time and/or distance, from support 
services, such as medical facilities or emergency agencies. Remoteness is a PE resid‑
ual risk best managed by advanced planning, regular re‑evaluation, reliable transpor‑
tation and communications.
The planning should centre on worst‑case scenarios. When it comes to remote‑
ness, the time required to reach medical facilities or for emergency services to be 
mobilised is the most important factor. This will be affected by PE residual risks 
such as terrain, road conditions and weather. The planning isn’t something to be done Physical Environment 115
annually or even monthly when workers are moving to different locations, which is 
the case with industries such as exploration, forestry, fishing, surveying, and other 
remote‑based work. A review should be done as part of planning for the day’s work. 
With natural environment residual risks, conditions can change so communications 
capability is essential. An example of what can go wrong occurred in September 
2011, when marathon runners were trapped in a gorge in a remote area of Western 
Australia where a bushfire had taken hold. It took five hours before rescuers reached 
the two women who had suffered burns to about 80% of their bodies (News.com.au, 
2011; ABC News, 2014).
Whilst regional emergency response is primarily the responsibility of government 
and various agencies, organisations should stay informed of those PE residual risks 
which have the potential to impact their operations. Information on trends is readily 
available on the internet, for instance, ‘The Changing Risk and Burden of Wildfire 
in the United States’ (Burke et al., 2021). Emergency alerts and status updates from 
agencies are often accessible via an app in real time or with minor delays.
At the local level, the managers of each enterprise should know the likely time for 
medical assistance to arrive at their site and the scope of potential injuries that could 
occur, for instance, suspension trauma from a fall whilst wearing a restraint harness. 
The medical conditions of individuals on site should also be known and planned for. 
The legislation of the relevant jurisdiction will likely stipulate the minimum require‑
ments; however, care for injured or unwell workers should be the overriding driver of 
investment in response capability.
As discussed further in Chapter 6 on HR risks, it may be the case that some 
individuals, due to personal factors, aren’t suited to work in certain physical envi‑
ronments, such as extremes of temperature, confined spaces, working at heights etc. 
If an organisation chooses to employ the individual, then management must ensure 
that the risks are managed according to that person’s condition. A precautionary 
approach should be taken, if possible, to only employ workers who are fit for the PE 
residual risks associated with the job. In general, a programme of acclimatisation 
can assist personnel to adapt to conditions. As a further example, some organisations 
expect their representatives to travel overseas for work. This should be preceded 
by risk assessment and a personalised management plan for the traveller, including 
evacuation in case of emergency or threat.
Most of the discussion in this chapter so far has focused on the natural environ‑
ment. Infrastructure also falls into this area as it constitutes a physical workplace. 
The residual risks of the human‑made workplace are like those of technology. These 
relate primarily to the placement of workers in relation to dangers. Traditional work‑
place conditions readily come to mind such as floors, lighting, ventilation, access 
and egress but of more concern are unknowns and invisible risks, such as fumes 
and biological hazards. The World Health Organization 2017 reported on indoor 
environments and respiratory illness, including allergy in 1997 but coined the term 
‘sick building syndrome’ back in 1982 (Jansz, 2017). Symptoms and signs can be 
categorised into two dimensions. These are anatomical sites such as eyes, respira‑
tory tract, skin and central nervous system, and possible mechanisms such as irri‑
tation and inflammation, allergic reactions, toxicity, infections and environmental 
psychological stress. Guidance on evaluating buildings is provided by the United 116 Productive Safety Management
States Environmental Protection Authority (1991) and numerous empirical studies 
have been completed since.
Unfortunately, unknown or unforeseen risks can be associated with infrastructure, 
as was the case with the Grenfell Tower fire in the UK in 2017. The fire was started 
by an electrical fault in a refrigerator on the fourth floor. It spread up the building’s 
exterior accelerated by combustible cladding and external insulation with an air gap 
between which enabled a stack effect. Authorities, building owners, management and 
residents were unaware of this design deficiency. Seventy‑two people died, 70 were 
injured and 223 escaped.
There has been regulatory change in the UK since the tower fire (UK Government, 
2020). The US Fire Administration acknowledges the inherent nature of tall 
buildings and the need for safety in design to include fire‑rated compartmenta‑
tion, non‑combustible construction, fire alarm systems, automatic fire sprinklers, 
smoke control systems and multiple fire and smoke protected exit stairs (US Fire 
Administration, 2022).
Society accepts the operation of high‑risk industries, but homes must be built for 
the safety of inhabitants and the community. High‑risk industries are often those that 
have inherent dangers associated with the location where the work is undertaken. 
The residual risk sources can have an accumulative effect on the overall risk. For 
instance, in underground coal mining, risks include the obvious physical aspects of 
darkness, uneven surfaces, access and egress issues, air quality and water inrush. 
Hidden dangers can include toxic gases and unventilated areas, within a working 
environment which is basically combustible. Offshore rigs are considered high risk 
because of the flammability of the material being extracted, which is exacerbated 
by remoteness if a fire and/or explosion occurs (as was the case with the Deepwater 
Horizon Disaster).
The residual risk of both technologies and the physical environment can 
often be explained by simply considering the energies involved and the 
impact of loss of control of such energies.
The same energy principle applies to non‑work environments and infrastructure 
so proximity of the energy source to populations is a major consideration in the 
Western World, but pressures in developing countries make locational factors more 
challenging.
The strategies for managing the residual and entropic risks associated with the 
PE system of production are summarised in Table 5.1. As is the case in the manage‑
ment of technological risks, the control of these risks begins in the design stage. In 
Western countries, it’s mandatory for site assessments to be undertaken and the risks 
to be clearly identified as part of project planning and application for regulatory 
approvals.
Table 5.1 highlights that some sites, especially those that were built well before 
strict government environmental requirements, may have design shortcomings, for 
instance, the footprint may be too small for the storage of equipment making site 
movements more difficult. Ideally, the organisation would begin with a ‘blank canvas’, Physical Environment 117

but this isn’t always the case. The key strategy when planning changes is what the site 
will look like when all modifications have been completed. This is to prevent ad hoc 
changes. As an example, management of an established food processing operation 
built a new storage facility in the footprint of the old facility, then realised this hadn’t 
fixed the issue of a constrained area where the greatest traffic movements occurred in 
front of the building. If management took a longer‑term perspective, they may have 
located the new facility further from the production centre. In industry more gener‑
ally, the failure to aim for optimisation of design can result in lost opportunities that 
hamper the enterprise for a long time impacting both safety and efficiency. Ad hoc 
changes without strategic planning can be problematic for businesses.
Adhocracy can be a cultural habit in organisations that don’t have in‑house 
experience and engineering competencies. As a result, safety and efficiency 
in design can be overlooked or poorly done.
At the PE‑process interface, how the work is done should regularly come under 
review especially when work occurs in physically demanding conditions, such as 
work outdoors during summer months. Some basic changes could include doing more 
manually intensive work during the cooler times of day or organising inward sup‑
plier deliveries for early morning and outward deliveries for late afternoon through 
coordination with stakeholders.
The opportunity is to challenge why work is done the way it’s done 
and how it can be executed more easily.
For instance, in remote exploration, one of the biggest challenges is the logistics of 
getting all the equipment including temporary accommodation, out to the field hun‑
dreds of kilometres away. This can be a time‑consuming process for instance, using 
ten‑tonne vehicle‑mounted cranes to load materials onto the backs of trucks at the 
base facility and unloaded on site in 40°C heat. If trucks are supplied by a contrac‑
tor, then issues arise because trucks aren’t always available, and this option can be 
expensive. In this scenario, a supervisor challenged how the work was done asking 
if there was a better way. Management listened. The solution selected by the opera‑
tions team was to purchase a truck which had a flatbed tray that could be unloaded 
using the onboard truck‑mounted crane. A layout was designed so that all the goods 
were secured onto the tray at ground level at the base facility, and after mobilisation 
to site, the tray was unloaded and left on the ground using the crane attachment. At 
the end of the drilling campaign, the tray was simply reloaded onto the truck and 
returned to the base facility with all the equipment onboard as well as waste from 
site. Using cost‑benefit analysis, the truck paid for itself within 12 months. Field crew 
already held truck operating licences, so the organisation was able to exploit previ‑
ously under‑utilised capability. Overall, the process was made safer, more efficient, 
flexible, and cost effective. The residual risks of working in a remote, harsh envi‑
ronment were taken into account and work processes adapted using a technological 
solution and in‑house competencies.Physical Environment 119
An ethos was developed of saving time and energy. This can lead to more 
efficient ways of working. Workers were encouraged to challenge 
the status quo.
Having to work in extreme heat should be questioned, for instance: can we do the 
work somewhere cooler; or can we reduce the amount of time working in the heat; 
or can we reduce the level of exertion required to do the tasks in the heat? If people 
feel too awkward to ask in fear of seeming foolish, lateral thinking can be used, as 
explained in: The Most Valuable Skill In Difficult Times Is Lateral Thinking – Here’s 
How To Do It (forbes.com) (Forbes, 2020). The principles of this simple example can 
be applied in any organisation to explore opportunities for improvement that lead to 
more effective management of risk.
As explained in Chapter 4, many risks occur at the interfaces between systems 
of production. Poor management of change can create operational risk issues. Even 
corporations can make the mistake of pursuing economies of scale in production 
without considering the consequences. For instance a mining company purchased a 
fleet of higher capacity ore trucks to discover that the bucket couldn’t be tilted up in a 
maintenance workshop which was designed for the smaller fleet. There are numerous 
news stories of oversized lorries getting stuck under bridges due to poor logistics and 
route planning. These blunders can be avoided with effective management of change 
and by including risk assessment in the planning phase.
Residual risks also occur at the interface between the PE and HR. The fit between 
workers and the PE isn’t static especially when the work is undertaken in various loca‑
tions throughout the day. This demands more cognitive adjustments by the worker 
than being in a non‑dynamic environment like an office or workshop. Compare for 
instance, running on a treadmill to doing a cross‑country run. A dynamic relation‑
ship between the person and their environment requires a constant process of look‑
ing ahead, adjusting foot placement and avoiding obstacles – in other words, risk 
management.
A ‘fixed’ physical workplace can be modified to some extent to fit the needs of 
workers. Job arrangements under demanding PE conditions should be flexible to 
enable continuity of safe, productive work. Major hazard critical controls should be 
implemented and tested to prevent fatalities, injuries, and debilitating illnesses. In 
changing work locations, PE residual risk critical controls could include for instance, 
heat stress, bushfire, lightning and medical evacuation from remote locations.
What is apparent with PE residual risks is that it’s not always possible to change 
the work environment. Such is the nature of residual risks so questions must be raised 
about how to make conditions more workable at the physical environment–human 
resources interface.
entropiC risks
The PE is also subject to entropic risk as it degrades. The two types of physical envi‑
ronments discussed above included the natural environment and human‑made infra‑
structure. Degradation of the latter is the same as technology and so the preventative 120 Productive Safety Management
strategies are also similar. Within the built workplace, deteriorated conditions often 
arise from human activity. In the OSH field, this has resulted in housekeeping stan‑
dards being introduced in many workplaces. In the quality management field, it’s 
been framed within the 5S of Lean Production.
The 5S quality tool is derived from five Japanese terms beginning with the letter “S” 
used to create a workplace suited for visual control and lean production. The pillars of 
5S are simple to learn and important to implement:
• Seiri: To separate needed tools, parts, and instructions from unneeded mate‑
rials and to remove the unneeded ones.
• Seiton: To neatly arrange and identify parts and tools for ease of use.
• Seiso: To conduct a cleanup campaign.
• Seiketsu: To conduct seiri, seiton, and seiso daily to maintain a workplace in 
perfect condition.
• Shitsuke: To form the habit of always following the first four S’s.
(American Society of Quality, 2024)
The English translation is to use the terms sort, set in order, shine, 
standardise and sustain. From the reference, the benefits are “improved 
safety, higher equipment availability, lower defect rates, reduced costs, 
increased production agility and flexibility, improved employee morale, better 
asset utilization, and enhanced enterprise image to customers, suppliers, 
employees, and management”. (American Society of Quality, 2024)
At a fundamental level, this involves modifying the workplace so there is a place for 
everything in its place. This is an area that the OSH profession has focused on as a 
measure of safety performance by undertaking workplace inspections, but this pres‑
ents a contradiction to the reality of work.
The problem with ‘safety’ is that maintaining housekeeping standards all 
the time is inefficient and not how work gets done.
Often OSH documentation will refer to ‘at all times’ which simply isn’t practical. 
To the ‘outsider’ such as the OSH Advisor who walks into a workshop to do a 
spot check on housekeeping, a work area may look chaotic with tools on benches, 
powered equipment like compressors wheeled into the active work area, and waste 
containers filled to the brim. What will the OSH Advisor report on the checklist? 
What score will be given for the area? Ask the workers how they might rate them‑
selves and the response might be, “it’s organised chaos”. In a perfect world, tools 
get put away when no longer needed but it’s human nature to keep things available 
in case they’re needed again during the day. It’s likely that it’s more efficient to do 
it this way. The easiest way to consider what is an acceptable level of ‘visual chaos’ 
is to consider whether it supports efficiency or has reached a point where it gets 
in the way of efficiency. The other consideration is whether it’s unsafe. Spills on 
the floor are unsafe because of the risk of slipping but clutter isn’t unsafe. So what 
standard should apply?Physical Environment 121
Every workplace has its ‘saturation point’ where ‘visual chaos’ (as 
perceived by the outsider) transitions from supporting efficiency to 
becoming inefficient. Once this is reached, safety and quality 
are also compromised.
For example, in the process of creating magnificent meals for customers in the 
expected timeframe, a chef will accumulate pots, pans and all sorts of cooking tools 
turning the kitchen into a visual disaster area. Once the meals are served however, 
attention turns to getting the restaurant ready for the next main meal session. This 
will be the pattern of work with risk unless the business owner can afford to employ 
someone as a full‑time kitchenhand who does all the cleaning progressively.
The same rationale applies in other workplaces. If the chef becomes hindered in 
their ability to produce output and meet customer expectations because of this chaos, 
changes need to be made. In this regard, it’s more helpful to consider risk in relation to 
active production timeframes. For a restaurant, this may be the lunch session then the 
dinner session. For a 24‑hour operation, this may be the three 8‑hour shifts assigned 
to the production line. Rather than setting housekeeping standards and applying them 
‘at all times’, it’s more realistic to accept that workplace risks are dynamic, so some 
degradation is normal due to activity. The defined production cycle (shift or workday) 
should be streamlined by housekeeping standards that ensure operational readiness at 
the start of each cycle. This means that the workplace is restored for optimal safety, 
efficiency and quality at the end of the shift, in readiness for the next shift or workday.
Operational efficiency can drive the work, subject to prompt corrective 
action for those conditions that create a safety risk.
The focus of housekeeping standards should be operational readiness for 
the next production cycle not ‘at all times’.
One reason for raising this issue is that OSH management systems often have standards 
and procedures, with broad statements like ‘at all times’ and ‘all workers’ etc. There’s a 
gap between ‘Work as Imagined’ and ‘Work as Done’ because of the sheer impractical‑
ity of achieving this perfect world. 5S being a Japanese system of work which has strong 
cultural relevance, may be applied more as guiding principles in countries that are not 
as perfection and strict discipline oriented as a broader societal cultural trait. The ‘at 
all times’ pressure to pursue continual perfection may have a negative consequence of 
creating a psychosociological hazard. This is an area worthy of further research.
Housekeeping standards should be discussed from a risk‑based perspective to 
support efficient operations not just safety. Unfortunately, these standards are usu‑
ally branded as safety documents. The best question for OSH professionals to ask the 
operations and maintenance teams, is, ‘What does operational readiness look like 
for your work area? What do you need to be safe, efficient and to do a quality job?’ 
These are the changes that should be pursued, because at the end of the day or shift, 
the workplace should be restored to a state with minimal degradation, which, in turn, 122 Productive Safety Management
enables efficient, safe start‑up in the next production cycle. This is a key mitigation 
in the PE–HR interface as shown in Table 5.1.
The other matter to consider occurs when more work is expected to be done 
within a footprint. This will put pressure on the PE and other systems of production 
and make the prevention of degradation more difficult. As stated earlier, every work‑
place has its ‘saturation point’ where chaos transitions from supporting efficiency 
to becoming inefficient. This is particularly the case where the number of work‑
ers increases beyond the original design capacity, such as in old factories. Another 
cause can be the introduction of additional lines of production within the limited 
workspace. At some stage, what tends to occur is safety incidents rise along with 
quality defects as systems are pushed beyond tolerances. The long‑term solution is to 
bring the work output back to within design capacity of the facility, for instance, by 
building new facilities for additional production streams at another part of the site or 
another location.
There are numerous topics that could have been selected for the discussion about 
PE residual and entropic risks. The above has focused on those with significant oper‑
ational relevance across industry types. The natural PE requires particular atten‑
tion because climate change is making the environment less predictable and there 
appears to be a rise in unknown unknowns. Owners and managers need to be more 
outward looking at risks beyond their operation’s gates.
THE WORKPLACE IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
In Chapter 4, the discussions about technology turned to the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution and its impact on the world of business. This has also brought about 
changes in what constitutes a workplace and how future work environments will be 
designed. Some of the key trends include: the gig economy, autonomous operations, 
adaptation for an aging workforce and ecosystems.
There are numerous resources describing the current gig economy and its rate 
of growth. This trend is characterised by fragmentation which results in flexibility, 
shifting of risks to workers and income instability (Weil, 2014). There is a discon‑
nected, individualised experience of work because workers aren’t physically together 
in a common location. Two categories have been identified – ‘crowd work’ and ‘work 
on demand’ as explained by Kaine and Josserand (2019). Crowd work is generally 
done at the worker’s home and can involve ‘microtasks’ or performance of profes‑
sional expertise such as delivering work online. In this case, the person’s home con‑
stitutes a workplace and how that’s set‑up from a risk perspective depends on that 
person’s preferences, not necessarily on a risk basis. The second category includes 
tasks such as point‑to‑point transport, food delivery and services by means of private 
vehicle such as pet care. In these cases, the workplace is variable and often includes 
public spaces. Kaine and Josserand (2019) provide a summary of literature on gig 
work which is a good platform for further research.
A key issue with the gig economy is that responsibility for risks falls to the gig 
worker. The three main vulnerabilities are occupational, precarity and platform‑based 
work. Occupational vulnerabilities come about because gig workers may have the 
same exposures such as increased risk of traffic accidents during deliveries or dangers Physical Environment 123
of entering an unfamiliar home to provide care‑giving services, without any regula‑
tory protections (Bajwa et al., 2018). Precarity relates to the temporary nature of the 
work and the psychological distress this can cause as well as having to provide their 
own resources to perform the work. Finally, platform‑based work has many consid‑
erations including isolation, unbundling of work and surveillance of the worker’s task 
performance (Bajwa et al., 2018).
The principles of risk management of traditional fixed workplaces don’t readily 
apply. This home‑based or mobile work situation is quite a different scenario than the 
trend resulting from COVID‑19 which has now allowed employees and direct con‑
tractors to work to onsite, remote or hybrid employment/engagement models. In this 
case, the employer still has a clear OSH duty even though they don’t directly control 
the workspace, which is often the worker’s home office or vehicle.
Another significant trend that ties in with technological innovation is the removal 
of some workers from the operational area. This is achieved using autonomous 
machinery such as driverless haul trucks in open cut mines or ore trains travelling 
from mine to port. The control room may be many kilometres away in a metropolitan 
area whilst the operations are in remote locations. The traditional workplace (e.g. the 
open cut mine pit) still exists but some categories of workers (the truck operators) are 
no longer required. According to Rezaei and Caulfield (2021), current views are that 
autonomous vehicles (AVs) may reduce the number of accidents but not necessarily 
the severity of any accidents. The researchers’ study found that most industry profes‑
sionals preferred that AVs still have steering wheels so that AVs could be manually 
operated, as a contingency. This answers a question which was raised in earlier dis‑
cussions about such technologies and infers that skilled operators will still be needed 
on site where autonomous plant is used. With time however, as confidence grows in 
the safety and reliability of the technology, this may change.
As explained in a video from Transurban Group (Connected and automated vehi‑
cle trials | Transurban Group, 2023), the ‘workplace’, which in this case is public 
roads, needs to be adapted, for instance with clear line markings for the vehicles to 
work autonomously. At the time of writing, testing involved assessing how an auto‑
mated truck interfaces with road technology; in other words, how the road will ‘talk’ 
to the vehicle (Transurban Group, 2023). From a risk management perspective, the 
scope for the physical work environment to have the capacity to communicate with 
machines (and perhaps people) is likely to be another opportunity to reduce residual 
risks and prevent entropic risks in the future.
The profile of human resources risks is also undergoing transition. There are 
significant economic issues ahead due to the aging population. The World Health 
Organization warns that retirement‑age and older adults currently outnumber chil‑
dren under the age of five (Forbes, 2022). Interestingly, the term ‘longevity economy’ 
has been used. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics by 2030, all baby 
boomers (post WWII to 1964) will be at least 65 years old. 9.5% of the civilian labour 
force is forecast to be older than 65 years (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021).
As people will be working longer, the design of workplaces will need to be adapted 
to ensure productivity, safety, and health. Organisationally, it would be prudent to 
recognise the degradation of the workforce due to aging as an emerging risk factor. 
Key areas of human deterioration will need to be considered. These include physical 124 Productive Safety Management
strength, flexibility, balance, sight, reaction time and speed, hearing, manual dexter‑
ity and tactile feedback, body fat, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, systemic 
blood pressure, fatigue and ability to work in extreme temperatures (Perry, 2010). 
There are also psychosocial considerations including shift preferences and risks of 
disengagement. Perry (2010) lists design considerations that include processes, tech‑
nologies and the physical work environment. Research continues to be undertaken to 
create a better fit between older workers and the workplace.
More broadly, management practices are evolving because of these and other 
social, technological, and economic pressures. According to an MIT SMR‑Deloitte 
survey on the future of the workforce, most managers now consider employees and 
external workers to be part of their workforce (MIT SMR‑Deloitte, 2021). The term 
‘Workforce Ecosystem’ has emerged and is explained briefly at: Practical guide to 
workforce ecosystems | Deloitte Insights (2021) and MITSloan Management Review, 
2021. Again, the physical concept of the workplace is under challenge which has 
implications for professions such as OSH, particularly if or when, regulatory require‑
ments are updated to encompass this new reality of work. In Australia, changes have 
already taken place. OSH legislation has been updated to replace the term ‘employee’ 
with ‘worker’ and ‘employer’ with ‘PCBU’:
Worker
Any person who carries out work for a PCBU, including work as an employee, 
contractor, subcontractor, self‑employed person, outworker, apprentice or trainee, work 
experience student, employee of a labour hire company placed with a ‘host employer’ 
and volunteers.
PCBU
Person conducting a business or undertaking. The model WHS Act places the pri‑
mary duty of care on the PCBU. The term PCBU is an umbrella concept used to capture 
all types of working arrangements or structures. A PCBU can be a: company; unincor‑
porated body or association; sole trader or self‑employed person. Individuals who are in 
a partnership that is conducting a business will individually and collectively be a PCBU.
(Safe Work Australia, 2023)
The definition of ‘workplace’ is worth noting when considering the above terms:
Workplace
Any place where work is carried out for a business or undertaking and includes any 
place where a worker goes, or is likely to be, while at work. This may include offices, 
factories, shops, construction sites, vehicles, ships, aircraft or other mobile structures 
on land or water.
(Safe Work Australia, 2023)
When reading the above definitions through a lens that includes the gig economy, the 
longevity economy, and the workforce ecosystem, it would be difficult to argue that 
these new categories of worker, work and workplace don’t fall within the employer/ 
PCBU’s OSH duty. This will be, or perhaps already is, a challenge for organisations to 
manage from a traditional health and safety perspective, which highlights the neces‑
sity for a risk‑based approach. Strategies based on silos will be unmanageable during 
this Fourth Industrial Revolution because the boundaries of responsibility between thePhysical Environment 125
‘employer’ and the ‘worker’ tread on the sensitive areas of privacy and security. The 
employer should hesitate to overstep these boundaries. Actions taken in the interests of 
the workers’ physical health and safety, such as monitoring keyboard actions or active 
computer time to prompt breaks and exercises, could cause psychological distress, if 
remote workers perceive these interventions as ‘Big Brother’ watching. Psychosocial 
hazards and risk management are now included in OSH legislation in some jurisdic‑
tions, so the management of OSH risks has become increasingly complex.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, the discussion turned to the residual and entropic risks associated 
with the PE system of production. It was clear that like technological risks, HSE in 
design is the major mitigation. For the physical workplace, environmental protection 
considerations are also critical to minimise residual risks inherited by operations and 
potential entropic risks that will develop through the facility or site lifecycle.
Human‑made technologies and workplaces should be built to known risks accord‑
ing to engineering standards then managed through maintenance and monitoring 
regimes to keep those risks within tolerances. The natural physical environment, 
however, can lead to ‘black swans’ due to unknown unknowns and incomplete data 
causing constraints to the risk assessment process. These unknown unknowns, once 
human interventions have been excluded, may be ‘Acts of God’. It’s important to 
clearly contextualise this concept, given the current trend towards ‘no blame’ cul‑
tures which may be eroding objective incident investigation and accountabilities.
In high‑risk industries, extensive work has been done to develop and implement 
fatal risk controls including monitoring regimes and emergency response capability, 
particularly in the presence of these workplace residual risks. Other organisations also 
have potential exposures to fatal risks so it’s important that business owners and man‑
agers understand their work and environment including regional risk exposures beyond 
the operation’s gates. Current climatic changes make it imperative that businesses pre‑
pare for potential emergency situations and not just rely on government services.
In this chapter, discussions have included site design. Many old facilities suffer 
from sub‑optimal productivity, safety, environment and quality plus miss opportuni‑
ties for improvement through modifications because of bad management habits akin 
to adhocracy. Residual risks are reduced through long‑term planning and good site 
design that supports operational efficiencies and safety. Many organisations would 
benefit from adopting a longer‑term, strategic risk management approach to their 
current and future operations.
As with other systems of production, the workplace is subject to degradation, and 
this is most raised as a safety issue when assessing housekeeping standards. The dis‑
cussion included contextualising the Lean Production Principle of 5S which involves 
having a place for everything and everything in its place. The reason this needs to 
be critiqued is that spot safety inspections can be unhelpful as work is dynamic and 
some degree of ‘organised chaos’ is part of efficiency. Safety critical risks with fatal 
or serious injury potential, however, shouldn’t be accepted. It was explained that the 
physical workplace has a ‘saturation point’ where this ‘visual chaos’ transitions from 
supporting efficiency to becoming inefficient.126 Productive Safety Management
Finally, some forecasts were made of the future of the workplace emerging from 
the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The key issues identified included the definition 
of ‘workplace’ and how it’s no longer simply a common office or site where every‑
one arrives Monday through to Friday to work in a shared environment. Significant 
changes have occurred due to the gig economy. The need for change continues in 
response to an aging workforce, the impact of human‑less interaction between the 
built environment and technologies, and the emergence of workforce ecosystems that 
demand a more mature risk management approach.
In the following chapter, the residual and entropic risks of the human resources 
system of production will be discussed. When PSM1 was published in 2003, the 
highest risk group statistically for workplace injuries was young workers. With the 
shifting average age of the workforce, this has changed and will become a more 
prominent issue for organisations to manage as time ticks on.

A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO HUMAN RESOURCES RISKS
In PSM1, the term ‘resourcefulness’ was used to illustrate the overflow or benefit 
of building organisational capacity. This was tied in with the Entropy Model and 
as a result, ‘resourcefulness’ entailed the implementation of the four‑step risk man‑
agement strategy which, in turn, should result in better systems review, improved 
problem‑solving and decision‑making, effective leadership at all levels and systems 
of production raised towards optimal performance levels.
Since PSM1, there has been significant debate regarding whether humans are haz‑
ards or heroes in the OSH management field. In this discussion, it’s worth expanding 
this to hindrance or hero when it comes to efficiency. Much of the research done 
in human factors has involved high‑reliability organisations (HROs). The work of 
James Reason (2008) explored human contribution to the reliability and resilience 
of complex, well‑defended systems. It was argued that humans may be considered 
hazards when taking the stance of unsafe acts implicated in many catastrophes. The 
human as a hero on the other hand results from adaptations and compensations that 
bring troubled systems back from the brink of disaster (Reason, 2008).
Other writings including Sandom (2007) highlighted that whilst human factors 
are often cited as the cause of hazards within safety‑related systems, safety case 
studies at the time, often didn’t refer to them. In practice, this has now matured in 
many organisations that include people‑related risks such as fatigue, drug and alco‑
hol abuse, bullying, violence, and other human hazards, in their risk register. This 
has to a significant extent been brought about by legislative requirements. The types 
of behavioural factors included in risk reviews tend to be issues that can be neatly 
packed based on statistical evidence. For example, it’s a fact that fatigue impairs the 
worker’s ability to perform safely. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol 
causes disfunction that compromises safety. Cognitive deficiencies however are much 
more difficult to categorise due to complexity. This is also obstructed by the broad 
scope of human factor analysis ranging from organisational culture to human error 
(Sandom, 2007). No single approach provides a clear understanding of the risks.
Recently, Bagley et al. (2023), wrote about hero or hazard by undertaking a sys‑
tematic review of individual differences linked with reduced accident involvement 
and success during emergencies. The findings were that involvement in accidents 
was predominantly affected by cognitive ability, leadership, situational awareness, 
personality and risk perception. From an implementation perspective, the findings 
point to recruitment and training of frontline workers in HROs and other organisa‑
tions to reduce risk and increase safety.
128 DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-7Human Resources 129
Unfortunately, when incident findings consistently give rise to the need 
for training and more training, this doesn’t help operations to better 
understand HR risks, how to assess those risks or to devise strategies 
for better management.
What’s useful however, is to continue the shift away from accident causation based 
on unsafe acts and conditions to a systems perspective. Human error needs to be 
contextualised within the entire system as an element of the HR system of produc‑
tion that has interfaces with technologies, processes and physical workplaces. There 
are often deficiencies at these interfaces that increase the probability of errors, for 
instance, poorly designed road intersections or inconsistencies in how levers and dials 
are operated on a control panel. The question is, has the system been ‘fool‑proofed’ 
(without trying to define the characteristics of a ‘fool’)?
Historically, behaviour‑based safety (BBS) programmes have been flouted as 
the panacea for human error, but these programmes are now being challenged and 
correctly assigned as one option within the overall risk management strategy. The 
systems approach acknowledges human fallibility and that errors will occur. The fol‑
lowing quote although more than 20 years old continues to hold true:
The situation in which the injury is actually caused by the worker, while existent, is 
extremely rare.
The statement that 80 percent to 95 percent of accidents are caused by unsafe acts 
is wrong because the primary causes come from management systems and the facility.
The great majority of actual causes of injuries is an interaction between the worker 
and the facility.
This point of interaction is the working interface, which should be the subject of 
attention.
Figuring out how the worker interacts with the system changes the focus of improve‑
ment from the worker to systems that enable safe behaviors.
(Manuele, 2000)
PSM1 concentrated on this working interface. According to the Entropy Model, HR 
are to be maintained at optimal performance, safety, and quality to reduce the prob‑
ability of an accident or loss, which does present a strong case for investment in 
training and development. Unfortunately, most risk management training tends to be 
classroom‑oriented and OSH‑focused. There’s a gap in connecting risk management 
competencies to production, safety and quality performance, as an integrated com‑
petency. In PSM1 and this edition, capacity building involves learning as an ongoing 
process through participative activities and the day‑to‑day successes and failures of 
operations (as described in later chapters).
In PSM1, a principle was applied that employees are assets (not as rhetoric but as 
a matter of fact). The traditional approach to OSH management portrayed them as a 
liability – the primary source of unsafe acts and accidents in the workplace. In addi‑
tion, accounting practices record labour as an expense and technology as an asset.130 Productive Safety Management
Fundamental accounting practices won’t change but the treatment of HR 
as an asset is a necessary and important philosophic shift for organisations 
intending to build sustainable businesses for the future.
There has however been traction since  2000. Human capital is now considered 
the key to a successful Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Strategy 
(World Economic Forum, 2021). The trend includes the application of sustain‑
ability accounting which hopefully, will in the future, result in individuals accu‑
mulating quantifiable monetary asset value through experience and transferable 
competencies such as risk management skills. Perhaps, this will assist organisa‑
tional decision‑makers to take a longer‑term, risk‑based view when cost‑cutting 
pressures are applied by the board or executive, and the easiest way to save money 
is to downsize workforce numbers. The questions should be, “How much have we 
got invested in this human asset?” “Can we afford to lose this human asset (espe‑
cially to a competitor?)”
More generally, there remains a significant gap between corporations with estab‑
lished and evolving ESG Agendas and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) when it 
comes to perceptions of the asset worth of personnel. This is a broad and complex 
landscape. Traditional management styles are still prevalent in immature organisa‑
tions. The dynamics can be characterised by power aligned with authority that, in the 
event of a safety incident or production loss, result in errors being detected and the 
‘delinquent’ being pointed out (Pierce, 2000). Even in these organisations, blaming 
the worker has created a quandary because in most cases, managers and supervisors 
know that the worker doesn’t choose to be injured, and they as supervisors don’t 
intentionally set out to harm workers. Alignment on values continues to be talked 
about in management literature but achieving it is clouded with debate including the 
current emphasis on ‘no blame culture’ which is having some unconstructive conse‑
quences as discussed in the previous chapter. According to Topf (2000):
Human behavior in the workplace is conditioned by a number of factors. It is not only 
governed by corporate imperatives but is conditioned by the employee’s values. Thus 
success of the enterprise depends in large measure on the extent to which these two 
value systems – the corporate and the personal – are in harmony… In other words, to 
achieve a safe workplace, we need leadership that supports safety, health and environ‑
mental excellence as a reflection of values.
(Topf, 2000)
The crux of the ongoing complexity, philosophical debates and various versions of 
‘safety’, such as Safety I, Safety II, Safety Differently and Synesis, is that human 
resources continue to be viewed through the psychosociological lens. What’s needed 
to balance this is a risk‑based approach to help reduce subjectivity. As discussed 
in Chapter 4 about technological risks, mathematical modelling using Shannon’s 
entropy method is assisting with this. Ali et al. (2024) for instance, used Shannon’s 
Entropy with other mathematical processes to assess failure modes and effects on 
the task of cutting core samples in a laboratory. Shannon’s entropy is employed to 
determine a degree of disorder. The smaller the entropy value the less disorder in the Human Resources 131
process or systems. This is then used for criteria weight calculations. Conclusions 
included:
This case study offered a unique approach for the HSE risk evaluation of different hazards 
(as failure modes) present in the core laboratory. The approach adopted here is quite flex‑
ible and reliable and addresses the limitations or drawbacks of previously widely known 
conventional techniques like the Risk Matrix based technique or FMEA in many ways…
the risk outcomes obtained were extremely precise and provided a clear distinction 
between the risk level of different failure models, which is crucial for their compara‑
tive ranking.
Though the scope of this study is limited to the risk ranking of HSE concerns, such 
as failure modes, of a particular experiment, however, the outcomes of this research 
work will certainly benefit organizations towards building sound HSE culture in Labs. 
Some of the benefits which are expected to achieve as a result of this study are:
• Identification of the role of risk ranking in setting and revisions of policies, 
strategic goals and objectives and key performance indicators
• Development and revision of safety plans, processes, procedures and 
guidelines…
• Identification of an effective and sufficient training needs and professional 
development and growth programme of personnel…
• Allocation of required human, financial, and physical resources for monitor‑
ing and mitigating the risk levels of hazards…
(Ali et al., 2024)
What’s particularly interesting about this approach is that it eliminates debate about 
whether humans make mistakes. Different failure modes include looking of machine 
parts during operation; short circuit due to heating/spark; loosening and striking of 
the core during operation; and contact of a body part with a moving blade. The method 
suggested is intended to support decision‑makers with the result being ‘maximum 
group utility’ for the ‘majority’ and the ‘minimum of individual regret’ for the ‘oppo‑
nent’ (Ali et al., 2024). The latter terminology isn’t explained clearly in the article; 
however, it could be assumed that the work delivers optimal return on risk reduction 
(maximum utility) to address protection of workers (the majority), whilst also giving 
the decision‑maker greatest confidence in their chosen actions (minimum regret).
Operations don’t have the capability or resourcing to do this type of deep dive 
analysis of task risks, so a simpler approach is needed. The takeaways from this study 
are valuable.
Firstly, the maths agrees that as entropy rises so does the risk.
Secondly, strategic risk management should focus on human resources 
objectively as a system of production, not on the complex organism 
or colony.
Thirdly, human fallibility is a fact.
The risks are at the interfaces with other systems of production.132 Productive Safety Management
HUMAN RESOURCE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
residual risks
HR risks, like the other systems of production, have both residual and entropic risks. 
The latter is primarily due to capability gaps. The classification as a residual not an 
entropic risk is because of the long lead time to develop knowledge, skills and abili‑
ties (KSAs) and reach optimal productivity, safety and quality work performance. It’s 
not possible for an individual or group to have a comprehensive set of competencies 
to deal with every situation that may arise during the execution of the work. As a 
result, from time to time, workers will use technology ineffectively, cause the work‑
place to degrade or deviate from standardised (presumably optimised) work prac‑
tices. Incorrect judgements will be made from failing to appreciate the risks. In some 
cases, a flawed decision may result from not applying embedded competencies, for 
instance, knowingly speeding to make an appointment on time. Some decisions may 
be reasonable and rational, such as an emergency. Cognitive limitations mean that a 
worker or team may be unable to assess the possible consequences of an action prior 
to an undesirable event. It’s only with hindsight that relevant information is revealed, 
and if known, may have led to a different course of action thereby preventing the loss 
in the first place.
HR residual risks are concurrently associated with limitations of the human body. 
Body builders are aware of this when they intentionally work muscle groups to the 
point of failure. Stating the obvious, humans don’t have eyes in the back of their 
heads so the senses have a narrow range and therefore, capacity to detect and react to 
threats. The variability between individuals means one size doesn’t fit all and match‑
ing the person to the job is an important and widely accepted mitigation.
In current risk management practices, HR risks aren’t readily discussed in this 
way perhaps because of fears of objectifying workers. These concerns are ill‑founded 
as there are numerous examples of organisations having to adapt to meet the specific 
needs of workers with physical and/or cognitive limitations, such as disability ser‑
vices. In other industries such as health care, the risk source may be due to the patient 
profile.
It’s important to step away from associating risk management with 
discrimination. The objective is to protect people from harm and enable 
productive work, not to treat them unfairly or downplay moral 
and ethical principles.
New employees are a significant source of residual risk, and in some high‑risk com‑
panies, they’re identified with a green hardhat to differentiate them from experienced 
workers. New employees increase the level of residual risk by diluting the overall 
capability of the collective workforce. They have a higher probability of introduc‑
ing entropy in the form of deviations from safe or optimal practice as they interact 
with other systems of production. The root cause is lack of workplace‑specific com‑
petencies which take time to be acquired and will vary amongst individuals based 
on factors such as previous experience in similar work environments. Proactive Human Resources 133
organisations implement an orientation and assimilation programme to accelerate 
new incumbents’ learning curves. They regard new starters as a ‘hazard’ during this 
period and manage the risk through supervision and on‑the‑job mentoring.
Historically, young workers had the highest incidence of fatalities and serious 
injuries, as reported in PSM1. For instance, the lost time incidence rate for males 
aged 15 to 24 in Western Australia in 1996/97 was 7.7 compared to other male work‑
ers at 5.9. This pattern was not evident for young female workers who had a rate of 
2.2 compared to other female workers with a rate of 2.6 (Worksafe Western Australia 
1994/5). Recent statistics from the UK indicate that the fatality rate by age group per 
100,000 workers for 2018/19 to 2022/23 was 0.16 for 16‑ to 19‑year‑olds, and 0.28 for 
20‑ to 24‑year‑olds, with figures progressively rising by age group to 0.75 for 60‑ to 
64‑year‑olds, and an alarming 1.43 for workers over the age of 65 years (Health and 
Safety Executive, 2023).
For the purposes of comparison between the earlier Western Australian statistics 
and recent results in the UK, in the ten years from 2011–2012 to 2022–2021, workers 
aged 65 and over made up only 4% of the workforce, but 16% of work‑related fatali‑
ties occurred amongst this group (Department of Commerce, 2000–2001). A study 
in 2022 showed that in the construction industry, exposure to chemical substances 
caused the greatest number of fatalities among older workers followed by falls and 
then vehicle incidents (Kamaree and Hasam, 2022). The results overall indicated that 
accumulated exposures are now evident, exacerbated by higher rates of older workers 
remaining in the labour force.
Another more recent study indicates mixed results when it comes to fatality and 
injury rates by age. Bravo et al. (2020) undertook a systematic literature review of 
fatal and non‑fatal injuries between older and younger workers. Fifty percent of the 
results showed more fatalities amongst the older workers but the other 50% were 
equally divided. When it came to non‑fatal injuries, the results were also complex 
with 49% showing no relationship between age and non‑fatal injury rates. Increased 
age was found to be a positive, protective variable for injury prevention in 31% of 
studies. The remaining 19% showed that older workers were more vulnerable to seri‑
ous injuries.
The commentary in PSM1 identified young male workers as the highest risk group. 
Work‑related and road traffic fatalities and injuries continue to indicate that this is 
true, so it remains fair to say that age and experience, and the associated learned 
competencies attained over time, do matter when comparing the residual risk of one 
age group against another. The Entropy Model indicates the need to manage these 
residual risks. Messaging and culture are important in this regard, for instance, by 
conveying safety norms to influence young workers through their interactions with 
supervisors and co‑workers, so they more quickly come to understand expectations 
of safety‑related conduct (Pek et al., 2017). Providing a safe learning environment, 
however, is the most important risk mitigation during this period.
Cognitive and physical limitations determine the residual risk of individuals and 
collective human resources (employees and contractors). HR risk management there‑
fore begins with understanding the profile of the workforce. If there’s a significant 
percentage of young or inexperienced workers, this may warrant the need for more 
supervisors, particularly in high‑risk areas. It may be possible to assign each young 134 Productive Safety Management
worker to a mentor or to engage them in a more controlled workplace with direct 
supervision in the initial few weeks or months. This is also a sound strategy for pre‑
venting entropic risks resulting from competency gaps.
Certain job categories are physically demanding. Again there’s a lead time to get 
workers job‑ready, particularly if the work environment is challenging. For instance, 
exploration drilling offsiders are required to work outdoors in harsh conditions 
(40°C+) and undertake tasks such as shovelling and carrying sample bags filled with 
earth for up to 12 hours per day, often for 13 days in a row before getting a day of rest. 
These jobs tend to be filled by young males chasing the money and adventure, who 
have varying levels of physical fitness and little previous experience in the industry. 
Employers need to consider each candidate on a risk‑basis with the input of medi‑
cal and fitness assessments as a condition of employment. The gap is that once this 
basic check is completed, it becomes part of an onboarding ‘tick and flick’ with little 
follow up by the supervisor in the field who could be under pressure to get the new 
person working to full capacity as soon as possible.
Across high‑risk industries, the missing risk management work is that managers 
and supervisors are seldom given straightforward risk‑based information. HR residual 
risks need to be considered in the context of the residual risks of the other systems of 
production. Inexperienced workers shouldn’t be left unsupervised or without a mentor. 
The risks of injury, damage, inefficiencies and other issues can be significant.
In contrast, well‑managed HR residual risks can have the opposite impact enabling 
the business to continually improve. In practice, this is most often achieved by having 
a core group of experienced operational leaders. They provide direction amidst the 
turmoil until reliable, quality systems are in place for better personnel recruitment, 
selection, onboarding and workplace coaching. The worst decision a business owner 
or manager can take is to ignore the ‘revolving door’ of job incumbents as normal to 
the industry.
Accepting the status quo is a recipe for ongoing losses many of which have a 
financial impact, although these may be more indirect than direct costs. The astute 
risk professional faced with these challenging circumstances will do math totalling 
the cost of bringing each new incumbent onboard multiplied by the annual turnover 
rate of that job category, to equate the annual direct cost. Other indirect costs can be 
calculated from injuries, including loss of productive time of the worker, the supervi‑
sor and support staff, to put forward a case for better ‘front‑end’ HR risk manage‑
ment embedded in the recruitment and assimilation process.
A dollar‑based strategy is sometimes required to break the management 
attitude that leads to ‘breaking’ people.
entropiC risks
The residual risks of the HR system of production are listed in Table 6.1 along with 
examples of risk management strategies. As explained earlier, these are derived from 
incomplete KSAs and the physical limitations of human factors. Many organisations 
implement these strategies but don’t necessarily articulate the nature of the risk as 
clearly as provided in the table.Human Resources 135

As shown, there are also numerous sources of HR entropic risk. The enterprise is 
particularly exposed when bringing new personnel onboard. This risk becomes pro‑
nounced if the business suffers from high turnover such as those relying on seasonal 
or migrant workers. Traditionally, turnover has been considered a metric for the HR 
(People and Culture) Department to measure and develop programmes for reduc‑
tion; however, Operational and OSH Departments should also be involved in strategy 
development because turnover has serious implications for safety, production and 
quality from a risk management perspective.
Regardless of competencies or age, workers who are in a degraded state can have 
an accident or trigger a loss. A highly skilled worker suffering from fatigue has less 
capacity to perform the work efficiently, safely and to the required quality standard. 
Although skilled workers have a lower residual risk, the susceptibility to deteriora‑
tion is similar if not the same as less skilled colleagues. The difference may be in 
who recognises the signs and takes timely corrective action by reporting their condi‑
tion or taking a rest break.
Fatigue is an entropic risk that can rise rapidly. There’s extensive literature on 
the causes of fatigue and in summary, these can be organisational and/or individual 
factors. Due to the latter, education is an important element in the fatigue manage‑
ment programme. HR entropic risks vary according to the interface with other sys‑
tems of production. For instance, demanding physical environments take a toll on

both body and mind. The technology involved in undertaking the work also has 
a significant impact; for instance, compare riding a motorbike to a car with other 
variables consistent – the same speed, road, other vehicles and site conditions. OSH 
regulators provide numerous resources online to enable the effective management 
of fatigue (NIOSH, 2023; Health and Safety Executive, 2023, Safe Work Australia, 
2023). Whilst fatigue management programmes tend to fall within the remit of the 
OSH function, the impact on production performance means that operations and HR 
departments should have input to these programmes. Many of the recommendations 
proposed by regulators include hours of work, design of shifts and rosters, breaks 
and other matters that are usually incorporated into the employment / engagement 
contract and work planning.
The fatigue management education piece is mandated in some industries such as 
commercial drivers. The gap from a broader industry perspective is that organisa‑
tions (or perhaps the education system) should move towards risk management as a 
life skill. This would encourage people entering the workforce to take ownership of 
managing risk as an ongoing personal competency. This in the longer term should 
create a more open learning environment centred on risk‑based conversations within 
organisations.
Some strategies for fatigue management are listed in Table 6.1 which includes 
mental fatigue and physical fatigue, for instance, the latter resulting from manual 
handling. This needs a renewed effort given the issues that are arising with an aging 
workforce. Other types of HR entropic risk shown in Table 6.1 include ill‑health and 
stress, both of which are extensively covered in resources readily available online. 
PSM1 provided a detailed description with legislative references applicable at the 
time.
What’s worth noting here is that mental ill‑health and stress, when suffered by 
a person with significant influence on a team or within the organisation, warrants 
a concerted effort by the enterprise and by that person’s support network. This is 
because of the flow on effect.
A leader whose performance is degrading can create a ripple effect 
that brings the rest of the team down professionally and, in some cases, 
personally.
This will be illustrated conceptually using the Entropy Model in terms of organ‑
isational capacity in Chapter 8. Suffice to say for the moment, that leadership can 
degrade causing a rising organisational entropic risk.
My Thi Diem Ta et  al. (2022) studied the importance of leadership styles on 
safety, using the traditional term ‘safety leadership’. They reviewed nine styles that 
have been frequently used in the development and validation of safety leadership 
theories. This may be useful from an academic perspective. In the workplace from 
a risk perspective, it’s the strategic and operational decisions leaders make and how 
they go about engaging others in the process that matters. In PSM1 and this edi‑
tion, there’s only ‘leadership’ – not ‘safety leadership’. If a manager is ill, stressed, 
has relationship issues or other factors, which impair their decision‑making abilities, 138 Productive Safety Management
then production, safety and quality (including the quality of the work experience for 
others) are likely to suffer. Ill‑health, stress and psychosociological risks are identi‑
fied in Table 6.1 as entropic risks.
The better approach is to put aside ‘safety leadership’ and focus only on ‘lead‑
ership’ (including when reading the ‘safety’ literature), to understand the risks of 
degradation and the triggers for corrective action. With this broader lens, there are 
more opportunities to learn what works. For instance, Sadiq (2020) found five fac‑
tors by which leaders create a workplace culture for injury prevention (which can be 
expanded here to ‘loss prevention’). Broadened beyond safety, these were empower‑
ing employees; promoting engagement; creating a learning organisation and culture; 
having an effective process‑based management system; and modelling leadership 
behaviour. It can be inferred that if any of these falters then senior management need 
to take corrective action, in a manner that is appropriate on a case‑by‑case basis but 
with sound risk‑based guidelines and a multidisciplinary approach.
What is at stake if an organisation chooses not to act when a leader’s performance 
declines? This is the type of question that has raised the use of the term ‘undiscuss‑
ables’ in more recent years and it’s particularly relevant when it comes to executive 
stress and performance (Rook et al., 2016). Another study based on academic health 
centres recommended that enterprises increase capacity to prevent organisational 
silence. These include developing leaders to counteract silence; developing skills in 
raising difficult issues with those in positions of power and training mentors to coach 
others to raise difficult conversations (Dankoski et al., 2014). According to Sterling 
(2020), corporate disasters such as Enron and Theranos were preceded by undis‑
cussables in the upper echelons of the businesses. This quashed challenges and cre‑
ated a culture of fear and denial. Stifled voices caused interactions to be politically 
motivated and oppressed the pursuit of truth. The lesson to be learned, according to 
Sterling, is that leaders must learn to prefer followers who aren’t simply obedient and 
who make them think.
Just as ‘black swans’ are unknown unknowns in technologies and the 
physical environment, ‘undiscussables’ create blind spots to leadership 
degradation that can result in loss of capacity to deliver 
on organisational objectives.
This discussion provides food for thought. From a risk management perspec‑
tive, operations managers and other key decision‑makers should be made aware of 
these HR entropic risks in terms of their teams’ performance but also as a barom‑
eter for self‑reflection by those in positions of authority. (This will be discussed in 
greater detail in Chapters 8 and 9 covering leadership and organisational capacity, 
respectively.)
A further source of entropic risk in the table is psychosocial risks including bul‑
lying, discrimination, violence, safety violations, and drug and alcohol abuse. It’s 
in relation to these risks that there needs to be clear accountabilities; specifically, 
differentiation between what the organisation controls and influences compared to 
behavioural choices made by individuals. Psychosocial risks and substance abuse are 
acknowledged as far as mitigations are concerned because of legislative requirements Human Resources 139
and guidance material available on regulators’ websites. (These topics won’t be cov‑
ered in this edition of PSM as there are extensive resources available in the public 
domain.) ‘Safety Violations’ on the other hand are a grey area that the OSH profes‑
sion and line managers continue to struggle with. Fortunately, the impact of produc‑
tion pressure on operational behaviours has become a focus area for researchers so 
some recent studies can be used to clarify what constitutes a ‘safety violation’ versus 
an organisational factor.
PRODUCTION PRESSURE AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS
Table 6.1 lists some strategies for addressing safety violations and these primarily 
follow traditional OSH and HR practices. Safety violations and drug and alcohol 
abuse can be put into a similar category because these both are driven to some extent 
by individual factors, although violations aren’t always that simple.
It would be easy to apply the criteria of ‘intent’ to acts and then classify them as 
violations. For instance, the worker intentionally commits an ‘unsafe act’ which they 
know doesn’t comply with a documented procedure, for instance, leaving the engine 
running and exiting a vehicle is considered a breach of safety on most Australian 
mine sites but is it this simple? What if the supervisor does this on a regular basis? 
What if the worker has been observed doing this numerous times without being 
advised of the correct parking protocols? What if on all other occasions, no incident 
occurred but this time, the vehicle has rolled and crashed into another vehicle nar‑
rowly missing a pedestrian, so the behaviour has been ‘caught’?
In practice, a ‘violation’ is not simply intent.
It’s also a matter of whether the behaviour is non‑compliant to required 
practice – procedural (written), the norms of the workgroup (in practice) 
and the organisational culture (expectations).
Having a procedure, getting workers to read it and sign‑off that they’ve read it, isn’t 
enough. Unfortunately, this is still common practice, and managers often assume that 
this will protect the business and themselves from accountability if a safety incident 
occurs. In immature organisations, obtaining workers’ signatures after reading docu‑
ments lays the path open for blame during incident investigations. The OSH profes‑
sional who leads the enquiry must carefully navigate this type of scenario with the 
knowledge that numerous court cases, including Barcock v. Brighton Corporation 
1949 (described earlier), have established precedent that employers/PCBUs can’t 
simply pass the risk to the worker after providing basic information and training. 
Workers must be actively engaged as part of the work in identifying risks and decid‑
ing how these are managed. Monitoring regimes must also be in place that test the 
effectiveness of risk controls with a feedback loop that triggers action if controls are 
inadequate.
Many commentators describe active engagement of workers in risk management 
as central to building a strong ‘safety culture’. As mentioned earlier in Chapter 2, var‑
ious disciplines will have their own framework for ‘culture’ such as environmental 140 Productive Safety Management
protection, quality, or lean culture. This alone can create conflict and non‑alignment 
on goals and values because of intrinsic tensions. Safety that becomes bureaucratic 
inherently becomes inefficient as suggested by Hollnagel’s Efficiency Thoroughness 
Trade‑Off. Operations often bear the brunt of this dilemma, which in turn can affect 
behavioural choices including procedural deviations to get work done quickly, even 
if this means ‘non‑compliance’ to the system.
Historically, various accident causation models were used to describe how peo‑
ple make behavioural choices in the presence of risk. These can be helpful to bet‑
ter understand safety violations. Risk Homeostasis Theory (Wilde, 1998) is a good 
example (although not without its critics – Trimpop, 1996). In summary, people have 
an expected utility of action alternatives which means they expect some benefit from 
various choices available to them. This affects their target level of risk they consider 
‘acceptable’. This may be higher than that of the organisation. Individual percep‑
tive skills are used to assess the level of risk of a particular activity. The target and 
perceived levels are compared which leads to adjusted action or choice of behaviour.
In practice, the organisation needs to, firstly, clearly define what isn’t acceptable 
behaviour, for instance, using golden rules or strict high‑risk procedures such as 
isolations, lockouts, and permits to work (This is where traditional approaches to 
safety continue to have merit). As it’s impractical to have rules for everything, other 
risk‑based decisions must be influenced to reduce the expected benefits or increase 
the expected costs of risky alternatives. A cost, for instance, would be disciplinary 
action if caught. On the other hand, for safe behaviour alternatives, the expected ben‑
efits can be increased and expected costs decreased (Wilde, 1998). The benefit might 
include positive feedback from the supervisor.
The discussions so far are alluding to the complexity of identifying a safety viola‑
tion as a root cause of a safety‑related incident. Some events are obvious such as a 
workplace argument that results in a worker breaking another worker’s nose in the 
presence of witnesses, but most incidents aren’t so straightforward. Consider the fol‑
lowing scenario.
A worker is approaching the end of the three‑week roster and in a couple of hours 
is due to fly home for a week. The cultural norms of the work team include preparing 
the plant and equipment for the next crew who will fly‑in for their roster. The worker 
decides to clean down the truck which has a crane mounted on the back. The crane 
hoist is raised so that cleaning can be done thoroughly. This is extended in the air 
approximately eight metres. The worker receives a phone call and goes into the work‑
shop. After this, the decision is made to refuel the truck, so the worker goes directly 
to the cab of the truck and drives out of the yard onto public roads. The extended 
crane brings down several overhead powerlines before the worker receives an alert 
from a colleague and stops the truck.
How easy would it be to jump to the conclusion that this was a safety violation? 
Perhaps, the worker could be classified as ‘stupid’ and the question asked, ‘How often 
has this person been involved in previous incidents?’ to determine if the person is a 
‘risk‑taker’ and ‘liability’ to the organisation. What impact would additional infor‑
mation have, for instance, that the worker is a supervisor with ten years’ experience 
with the company? Would this change perceptions of guilt? Such matters which are 
person specific, introduce a cognitive bias which means there’s drift into subjectivity.Human Resources 141
What if the investigation revealed that the truck was parked close to the open large 
main entry of the workshop and that this proximity, meant that the arm of the crane 
was obscured from the supervisor’s peripheral vision by the wall of the building. As a 
result, the supervisor didn’t see the extended crane arm, forgot that it was still raised 
and went straight to the cab then drove off. No warning lights or alarms went off due 
to damaged wiring inside the console. This wasn’t visible to the worker.
In the scenario given, the supervisor was trying to do the right thing by refuel‑
ling the truck before going on leave so that it would be ready for the next crew. The 
immediate contributing cause of the incident was that the alarm system that ordinar‑
ily warned of the raised crane arm wasn’t functioning. Other gaps, for instance, in 
maintenance, inspection and testing, were derived from this. The starting point for 
the investigation was technological not human. The last area of investigation was 
person‑related, for instance, as the incident occurred at the end of a three‑week ros‑
ter, was the worker suffering from fatigue? Would fatigue have changed the outcome? 
Probably not. When the worker’s psychological state after an incident is considered, 
the systems approach rather than the person‑centric approach, is much fairer. There’s 
an opportunity to build trust in the process, rather than making them feel that they’re 
under interrogation.
From the outset of incident investigation, assume that the person/s involved 
were trying to do the right thing for the right reason. Ask how this could 
happen? Questions what occurred at the interface between HR and the 
other systems of production. Analyse person‑specific residual 
and entropic risks last.
This methodology is needed to reduce cognitive bias of the incident investigator 
/ investigation team and others who may seek to have input or influence the pro‑
cess or outcomes. Inherent bias in logical reasoning was a basis of research done by 
Kahneman and Tversky (1972, 1974). A recent study presents cognitive illusions and 
explains who can solve them and why (Bruckmaier et al., 2021). In their experiment, 
it was found that the best predictor of ability to solve the brain teasers was mathemat‑
ical competence followed by intelligence. Correct answers were more likely when 
there was a facilitator to translate information into an accessible form, otherwise, 
participants tended to fall into mental traps built into the brain teasers and get the 
answer wrong.
The lesson for organisations is to ensure that major incident investigations are led 
by senior personnel who preferably aren’t directly involved in the operation, perhaps 
from another site, who are independent of local organisational cultural issues and 
biases. The incident investigation system should be carefully developed to minimise 
or prevent prejudice, for instance, some systems still categorise immediate and root 
causes into ‘unsafe acts’ and ‘unsafe conditions’, which continue to point at worker 
behaviour and incompetence (or at best, training gaps).
It should be borne in mind that many incidents could have occurred to someone 
else, not specifically to the person/s directly involved in a particular event. Prevention 
is about recurrence to protect anyone who could be exposed to the same or similar 
circumstances in the future. The other concern with starting with person‑specific 142 Productive Safety Management
questions is that it sends unhealthy cultural messages that erode trust. (The work of 
Sidney Dekker including the recent publication of “Stop Blaming: Create a restor‑
ative just culture” provides deeper thought on this topic.)
It’s also important to understand the context in which behaviours occur. In Chapter 
2, the example was given of underground miners falsifying the pre‑start checks on 
their vehicles and ignoring faulty park brakes. This was done to ensure that vehicles 
were available, not sent to the workshop for repair, so that they could push produc‑
tion, which would be rewarded through their next fortnightly bonus. This type of 
messaging drives the collective and individual target levels of risk upwards. Any 
incidents in this organisation, even if there were ‘safety violations’, would be difficult 
to justify in an environment where production pressure is the over‑riding operational 
driver.
Evidence of production pressure and risk‑taking behaviour in industry has been 
confirmed, for instance, by MOSHAB (1998, 1999). More recent studies include 
Hashemian and Triantis (2023) and Oswald et al. (2019, 2020). For instance, Oswald 
et al. (2019) did a study of the construction industry and identified that subcontrac‑
tors were more likely to be paid by ‘piecework’ rather than ‘by hour’. This creates 
inherent production pressure by incentivising them to work as fast as possible. A job 
completed quickly with safety shortcuts attracts the same remuneration as a job done 
in a planned, risk‑managed manner that takes longer. The researchers identified that 
there were informal production management processes in place on construction sites 
that increased safety risks, and this was common practice. The Alignment Fallacy 
discussed in Chapter 2 explained this in the broader context that having a safety 
policy (even ‘Safety First’) doesn’t ensure that policy becomes an operational reality.
The evidence of production pressure indicates the need to be wary of 
shortcuts in incident investigation that could result in personnel wrongly 
being accused of safety violations because they rushed the job.
Intentional violations of safety within effectively planned and well‑controlled work 
environments, may occur and these can be addressed through the integration of OSH 
and HR management processes, for instance, coaching, supervision and/or disciplin‑
ary actions if appropriate. The primary means of preventing undesirable behaviours, 
however, must be, firstly, to remove areas of non‑alignment such as production‑ centric 
incentive payments for contractors and sub‑contractors, and secondly, to develop an 
organisational culture that discourages risk‑taking. This is more difficult for short‑ to 
medium‑tenure contracts than in steady state operation.
Contractor management and prevention of entropic risk is complex. Ideally, 
Operational Managers should regard contractors and subcontractors the same as per‑
manent employees for ethical reasons but there are several obstacles to this. The 
first is the lack of long‑term relationship, so where possible, service arrangements 
should be set up to integrate these suppliers. The second obstacle is procurement 
processes are cost‑driven with work often going to the lowest priced tender. The 
third issue is that often these services are called upon with a sense of urgency either 
because they’re specialist skills that aren’t available in‑house or because of absences 
or under‑staffing, internal skills aren’t available on the day. The contractor therefore Human Resources 143
arrives at the site and the client communicates pressure‑driven messaging about the 
need for the work to be completed as soon as possible.
From a legislative perspective, the client has a safety duty to employees, contrac‑
tors, and subcontractors but operationally, the process of engaging these workers can 
itself be riddled with shortcuts. These issues point to the potential for an organisation 
to have a broader operational culture which may be risk‑based, but still have pockets 
of sub‑culture that are production‑ or schedule‑centric. Again, context becomes a fac‑
tor in assessing an ‘unsafe act’ as it may be a safety violation or a symptom of systems 
or practices that have embedded cultural defects. The relationship between behaviours 
and culture will be discussed in Chapter 9 in which the two alternatives of risk‑taking 
versus risk‑managing will be presented using the Risk Behaviour Model (Van der 
Stap, 2008).
In the meantime, it’s important to consider what constitutes a ‘safety violation’? 
When an intentional unsafe act is committed by an individual despite the organisa‑
tion having done their due diligence through the recruitment and selection process, 
providing necessary training and supervision, within the context of a risk‑based cul‑
ture, then it may be a violation.
For a safety violation to have occurred it must be preceded by individual 
behavioural risk‑taking as the root cause, without extraneous influencing 
factors that are within the control of the organisation’s systems or practices.
A warning needs to be provided as accountability remains fundamental to the deci‑
sion process.
An individual or group in collaboration mustn’t be able to blame the 
‘system’ or the supervisor or production‑pressure, as a means of avoiding 
accountability for a violation that has been identified based on objective 
evidence.
This needs to be borne in mind not just from an OSH perspective but also violations 
that cause other losses, for instance, to production performance, damage to equip‑
ment, environmental harm or quality defects. HR risk management must consider 
that whilst most people are trying to do the right thing for the right reasons, there may 
be some who aren’t conscientious, ethical or willing to change. A systems‑driven, 
risk‑based loss investigation process needs to be in place to address sources of risk 
within the total system, which includes intentional damage or sabotage of that sys‑
tem. In Chapter 5, there was discussion about the ‘No Blame Culture’ leading to 
more incidents being ascribed to ‘Acts of God’. This has been counter‑productive for 
the OSH profession and safety performance, especially in the construction industry 
in the USA. What mustn’t happen is that ‘production pressure’ becomes an avenue 
for avoidance of accountability.
The final section of this book will raise some of the opportunities for better HR 
risk management that are emerging from the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This will 
tie back to the discussions about the technological and workplace advances of previ‑
ous chapters.144 Productive Safety Management
HR RISKS IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
Some of the key developments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution were discussed in 
Chapters 4 and 5 about technology and the physical environment, respectively. Some 
other advancements have become more personal with widespread cultural accep‑
tance, such as wearable technologies and mobile phone capabilities.
An interesting field from an OSH perspective is the use of exoskeletons to physi‑
cally support workers or prevent musculoskeletal disorders. These reduce load whilst 
allowing the user to move freely and safely (IOSH, 2023). The uptake in aged care is 
an expected progression for the industry from simple supportive devices, but poten‑
tial benefits in the workplace appear to be untested to‑date (European Agency for 
Safety and Health at Work, 2019). Some concerns are being raised.
In this context, industrial workplaces, furniture delivery services, emergency services 
and hospitals are of interest. However, it is important to recognise that ergonomic 
design namely in stationary workplaces. As long as technical or organisational mea‑
sures provide possibilities for improving ergonomic design, the use of exoskeletons 
should not be preferred (Schick, 2018). Nevertheless, it seems that focusing on exoskel‑
etons that increase the performance of workers might be of greater interest than focus‑
ing on the human‑centred design of workplaces (Baltrusch et al., 2018).
(European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2019)
The use of exoskeletons needs further research to determine the advantages and dis‑
advantages of using them. These may have negative physiological effects from addi‑
tional weight on the cardiovascular system. User acceptance will also play a major 
role along with potential psychosocial effects if workers feel inferior using them 
because of stigmatisation. Biomechanical aspects need to be considered as exoskel‑
etons may support very specific movements and muscle activities and thereby influ‑
ence the wearer’s physical behaviour, which might not be an ideal fit for the range of 
work that needs to be performed.
The integration of wearables into OSH management systems appears to be on the 
rise. Various E‑tool seminars are now available (European Agency for Safety and 
Health at Work, 2022) covering the challenges and benefits of their use in risk assess‑
ment. Smart digital systems are proposed to provide for safer and healthier workers 
(European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2023a, 2023b).
The overall success of these systems will rely on effective communication of data, 
standardisation, and inclusive implementation processes but worker privacy and 
data protection issues will also be key priorities (European Agency for Safety and 
Health at Work, 2023 a, 2023b) Large employer organisations are leading the way 
in Europe with most establishments having 250 or more employees. According to 
OSHA, current OSH legislation doesn’t address the implications of technical change 
in OSH monitoring, making it a grey area. Those countries such as Australia which 
have Roben’s style enabling legislation are probably better able to capture techno‑
logical change within the OSH duty holders’ accountabilities. Hesitation and lack of 
buy‑in among workers and their unions is forecast to be an obstacle. Concerns are 
often centred on limited evidence of benefits and awareness coupled with fears of 
potentially hidden purposes of monitoring. Trade Unions are questioning whether Human Resources 145
these technologies will exposure workers to productivity pressures to the detri‑
ment of health and wellbeing (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 
2023 a, 2023b).
Overall, the discussions about the Fourth Industrial Revolution in each chapter 
have flagged the need for organisational leaders to monitor developments for trends 
and opportunities. Professionals in strategic and operational risk‑based disciplines, 
such as engineering, OSH, environmental and quality management, should maintain 
an open mind to the risks and opportunities that lay ahead.
SUMMARY
This has been the final chapter examining the residual and entropic risks associated 
with systems of production. There are extensive topics that could have been covered 
for HR risks that span multiple fields such as ergonomics, human operational perfor‑
mance, behavioural‑ based safety etc.
The aim of this chapter has been to describe the fundamental residual risks asso‑
ciated with cognitive and physical limitations of human beings and the impact these 
have on capacity to perform work safely, efficiently and as per required quality stan‑
dards. The discussion highlighted human fallibility as a fact. Entropic risks were 
also explored. These fell into two main sub‑categories – those that the organisation 
has primary accountability for and those that are largely dependent on individual 
decision‑making factors. The residual and entropic risk management strategies were 
presented in Table 6.1.
Some of the more contentious issues associated with people management were 
raised. These included moving beyond the human as hero or hazard from an OSH 
and operational perspective. A systems approach is needed to contextualise HR risks 
including ‘safety violations’ to avoid unfair blame without glossing over account‑
ability for failures. There are risks with adopting a ‘No Blame Culture’ that can be 
counter‑productive to individual and organisational learning. There are no shortcuts 
to having clear accountabilities and responsibilities.
The OSH profession has been strongly influenced by the psychosociological lens 
of those considered to be thought leaders of the OSH discipline. Operationally, it has 
created confusion and blurred the sound, ‘traditional’ approach of incident investi‑
gation which must be an objective, technical process. Strategically, when aiming to 
use incident investigation as part of a healthy organisational culture, it’s important 
to consider how the system failed the person (as a starting point) rather than how the 
person/ injured worker failed the system. The aim of a risk‑based approach is not 
to objectify people (dehumanisation) but to create sufficient distance between the 
investigators and the personnel involved in the incident, to enable trust in the process. 
In immature organisations in particular, this approach can counter shortcut investi‑
gations solved by disciplining the person/s directly involved. The OSH profession 
should be cautious not to discard tried and tested practices.
Other disciplines are helping to make HR risk assessment more objective. This 
includes mathematics such as Shannon’s Entropy Approach which looks for varia‑
tions from the norm in human behaviours under a test condition. The method con‑
firms rising entropy as a risk. The input of mathematics and big data analytics will 146 Productive Safety Management
likely make human performance analysis increasingly objective despite some soci‑
etal concerns, which are likely to be addressed concurrently.
Since PSM1 was published 20 years ago, there have been changes to the work‑
force HR residual risk profile in Western countries. This has resulted from the aging 
workforce. In 2003, the highest risk group were young workers primarily due to more 
risk tolerance and lack of experience. Currently and increasingly into the future, 
older workers are incurring injuries and dormant health issues are becoming evident. 
Risk management planning for this aging workforce needs to be done by organisa‑
tions if injury rates are to be curtailed and occupational diseases detected early for 
treatment interventions. This was a risk that in the past was an ‘undiscussable’ as it 
raised concerns about discrimination. Times change.
One of the more contentious risks discussed in this chapter was the ‘undiscuss‑
able’ topic of leadership degradation. Personnel in influential positions can suffer 
from declining job performance for several reasons; however, interventions are often 
cautious and slow, resulting in risks to the performance of team members and subor‑
dinates. A more objective approach is needed to identify these HR risks and provide 
support. Traditionally, this was the realm of the HR Department, but OSH legislation 
has changed, and psychosocial risks are now considered an organisational ‘hazard’. 
HR and OSH Departments must collaboratively manage this risk but where the per‑
son affected has operational accountabilities, the impact of their job performance 
on production/ schedule/ core business, must be part of the assessment process to 
prevent losses due to unreliable decision‑making. What is at stake is not just safety or 
morale but other losses that affect the bottom line.
One of the key areas that a leader can fail is poor planning which results in pro‑
duction pressure cascading to the workforce. In recent years, production pressure is 
being recognised as a human and organisational risk that needs to be managed. Much 
more work needs to be done in this area in the research field and operational practice.
The chapter closed with the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on HR 
risks. Personalised technologies are enabling data feedback to better understand 
human performance, for instance, using wearables. Exoskeletons are proposed as a 
future solution to reduce manual handling injuries and to facilitate safe movement 
for persons suffering from impairment. The cost–benefit analysis of these innova‑
tions is yet to be done for operations. In the bigger picture, the opportunities appear 
to be extensive and the need to better understand HR interfaces with other systems of 
production will be an important part of managing these changes.
In the next chapter, the residual and entropic risks of the four systems of produc‑
tion will be combined to present an alternative way of considering semi‑quantitative 
risk assessment. This will be an update of Chapter 7 of PSM1.

7 Risk Quantification and 
Management Strategy
THE ALARP ASSUMPTION REVISITED
Figure 3.4 in Chapter 3 illustrated the ALARP Assumption. It showed that as the 
operation and its risk management system mature, there is the danger it will move 
into an ‘Operations: Low Value Thoroughness Phase’. Actions are taken because 
‘something’ must be done, and this may add attention to risk reduction with dimin￾ishing returns. Other risks with unforeseen or unacknowledged consequences may 
arise such as production pressure as workers become confused by and bogged down 
with bureaucratic process. The excessive use of rules may have negative impacts on 
the culture, for instance, if workers perceive that they’re in a ‘parent–child’ relation￾ship with ‘the system’. For this reason, the actual risk level into this low value phase 
was shown as variable and unreliable, and different from the ALARP level that man￾agement assumed had been achieved.
In this chapter, an alternative approach to risk assessment is presented based on 
the concepts of residual risk, entropic risk and the ALARP Assumption. The propo￾sition is:
If the ALARP Assumption is correct, adding more lower order controls 
doesn’t reduce risk. This means current risk assessment processes are 
deficient. A new approach that combines residual and entropic risks of 
an activity, and more broadly, ‘The Work’, needs to be considered.
The method proposed in this section is worth testing empirically. It serves several 
purposes for the risk assessment process and incident/loss investigation. The first 
purpose is to focus on risk and the potential for loss across multiple disciplines, 
thereby, implementing the rationale of the Entropy Model. Secondly, the risk assess￾ment process may be led by the relevant subject matter expert (OSH, environment, 
quality, operations etc.) but ultimately, the risk owners are those internal stakehold￾ers who hold control of the required resources, systems, and processes, for example, 
site maintenance manager or site training manager. The major difference from tra￾ditional risk assessment processes is that the interdependencies of accountabilities 
for systems of production risks are much clearer. Finally, risk is presented as having 
multiple sources. There are eight which are the residual and entropic risks of the 
four system of production that combine when an activity is carried out. This is more 
granular than the singular concept that is now used.

CURRENT RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS
The most used tool for OSH risk evaluation is the Safety Risk Assessment Matrix. 
This can be a simple five by five table of likelihood versus consequence. Examples 
can be found online such as Sample Safety Risk Assessment Matrices for Rail Transit 
Agencies (dot.gov) and Risk Assessment in the UK Health and Safety System: Theory 
and Practice – PMC (nih.gov). These are used to rank risks relative to each other 
which is commonly referred to as a semi‑quantitative method.
The limitations of these risk matrices are well documented. Cox (2008) identified 
the following deficiencies:
(a) Poor Resolution. Typical risk matrices can correctly and unambiguously 
compare only a small fraction (e.g., less than 10%) of randomly selected 
pairs of hazards. They can assign identical ratings to quantitatively very 
different risks (“range compression”).
(b) Errors. Risk matrices can mistakenly assign higher qualitative ratings to 
quantitatively smaller risks. For risks with negatively correlated frequen‑
cies and severities, they can be “worse than useless,” leading to worse‑than‑ 
random decisions.
(c) Suboptimal Resource Allocation. Effective allocation of resources to 
risk‑reducing countermeasures cannot be based on the categories provided 
by risk matrices.
(d) Ambiguous Inputs and Outputs. Categorizations of severity cannot be made 
objectively for uncertain consequences. Inputs to risk matrices (e.g., fre‑
quency and severity categorizations) and resulting outputs (i.e., risk ratings) 
require subjective interpretation, and different users may obtain opposite 
ratings of the same quantitative risks. These limitations suggest that risk 
matrices should be used with caution, and only with careful explanations of 
embedded judgments.
(Cox, 2008)
Decision‑makers may not be aware of Risk Matrix design features 
that increase uncertainty. This indicates that the matrix is inherently 
unreliability as a decision support technique (Peace, 2017).
Matrices, however, continue to be widely used in industry and provide the basis for 
risk ranking in many enterprise, discipline‑specific and operational risk registers. 
This deficiency was commonly accepted when PSM1 was written in 2003. As a 
result, a different approach was developed that considers the breakdown of risks 
that are then combined into a total risk profile. Whilst the potential combinations of 
process, technology, physical environment and human resources may be innumer‑
able, the key aim is to get a better understanding of areas of vulnerability or fragility 
within an organisation. For instance, at a food processing facility, this may primarily 
be due to aging infrastructure and equipment or reliance on itinerant workers who 
lack industry knowledge in the agriculture sector.Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 151
DYNAMIC COMBINATIONS RISK METHOD
The ‘Dynamic Combinations Risk Method’ (DCRM) described below provides a 
mental modelling approach. When a risk professional enters a workplace for the first 
time, they can use this to identify critical issues, rather than simply looking for haz‑
ards. Many hazards in the workplace tend to come and go. For instance, a delivery of 
supplies is placed in front of a doorway due to lack of space within the workplace. As 
the supplies are unpacked and put away, the ‘hazard’ (a blocked doorway) disappears. 
Whether this is a ‘hazard’, or an inconvenience depends on whether the doorway 
could be a critical exit in an emergency. The real risk may be that the facility foot‑
print is too small for the work that needs to be undertaken; however, this is seldom 
the focus when it’s easier to note a blocked exit on an inspection checklist.
Operationally, the Risk Matrix which is often included in tools such as Job Safety 
Analysis (JSA) is rudimentary at best. Many workers are expected to understand the 
risk using this likelihood and consequence table. From a strategic perspective too, 
these are limited for system‑wide risk reduction. Constraints can be shown if differ‑
ent activities are compared. For instance, Activity 1 involves an experienced truck 
driver reversing to the edge of a mine waste dump over which there is a substantial 
drop protected by an earthen barrier. Using a standard matrix (e.g. page 5 of Sample 
Safety Risk Assessment Matrices for Rail Transit Agencies (dot.gov)), the probability 
of an accident would be ‘remote’ (likely to occur no more than once per five years) 
and severity ‘critical’ (a death or partial disability), resulting in a ‘medium’ risk. 
Activity 2 has an apprentice using a fixed circular saw in a workshop. The probability 
of a hand injury is ‘occasional’ (no more than once per year), and severity is ‘critical’ 
(hospitalisation) so the risk is also ‘medium’. The risk scores for the two activities are 
the same even though a truck going over the edge of a waste dump is likely to lead to 
a fatality or permanent disability (such as paraplegia), whilst the second activity may 
result in loss of fingers depending on whether the saw has an automatic cut out switch. 
Examples of similar accidents can be found at: SIR No. 277: Haul truck over open pit 
wall edge – fatal accident (dmp.wa.gov.au); MSH_SIR_230.pdf (dmp.wa.gov.au) and 
Teen apprentice loses tips of two fingers – Manufacturers’ Monthly (manmonthly.
com.au). Incidents from industry help to inform the risk assessment process but don’t 
necessarily make it easier to assign scarce resources for risk mitigation.
It’s highly likely that there will be disagreement between participants in a risk work‑
shop about the scores of the two examples above. The matrix is highly subjective so one 
worker’s assessment could differ significantly from another’s. Unfortunately, this can 
lead to debate at the operational level that hinders efficiency. The Risk Matrix doesn’t 
account for the effect of risk modifiers that either increase or decrease the risk such 
as the level of training received by the worker or the impact of work systems such as 
shift work. The failure to consider systemic weaknesses that exacerbate risks can lead 
to resources being allocated to areas which are lower risk. Assumptions must be made 
about the condition of systems of production. For example, if the truck driver is highly 
competent (low residual risk), this would reduce the risk. Experience and safety con‑
sciousness allow the individual to manage the risks effectively under controlled condi‑
tions. If, however, the driver works overtime for consecutive days, the ability to operate 
safely may be impaired by degradation and the HR entropic risk will rise.152 Productive Safety Management
The limitations of the matrix call for a more effective risk evaluation method 
which allows managers to manipulate the quality of each system of production to 
pinpoint weaknesses and in turn, increase certainty to improve resource allocation. 
The Entropy Model indicates that the level of risk in an organisation is dynamic 
because of the tendency of systems to degrade. Residual risks are assumed to be fixed 
in the short term due to resourcing constraints and technological limits to HSE in 
design. Entropic risk, however, can escalate because of changing states or losses of 
control, whether small, accumulative, or significant.
The DCRM uses a series of scorers for each of the eight sources of risk to generate 
a more granular risk ranking system. These scorers, like the matrix, work on relative 
risk rather than absolute risk. Using this method, the first step in risk management 
is to identify workplace risks for each system of production to better understand the 
risk profile of an operation. Compiled results are presented in Table 7.1. Different 
activities are generated by identifying the process, the human resources who under‑
take the process, the technology used and the physical environment in which it’s 
carried out. The questions to ask are:
• What process is undertaken?
• Who does it?
• What technologies are used?
• Where is the process undertaken?
An activity therefore is the combination of systems of production so that:
Activity = Process + Human Resources + Technology + Physical Environment
Table 7.1 shows three examples which reading across each line, are self‑ explanatory. 
The risks within each system of production for these activities can then be identified and 
semi‑quantified using the Scorers explained later in this chapter. To do this, residual and 
entropic risks are dealt with separately because the two categories of risks require differ‑
ent strategies to manage them, as explained earlier using the Four‑Step Risk Management 
Strategy from the Entropy Model. The identification and semi‑quantification of residual 
and entropic risks leads to Residual Risk Management Strategies (RRMS) and Entropic

risk control interventions using the proposed DCRM method.
RESIDUAL RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
The development of RRMS begins by quantifying the residual risks within each 
of the systems of production for a given business activity. Ultimately, the method 
proposed involves identifying areas of higher risk against those of lower risk for vari‑
ous inputs. For example, an electric saw has a higher residual risk than a hand saw 
because of the energies involved. An underground mining environment has a higher 
inherent danger than an office building because it’s potentially unstable, confined, 
has limited illumination and includes other risk factors. Using this method, each 
system of production is considered in turn to semi‑quantify the level of residual risk 
before combining them again into an activity.
In PSM1, the residual and entropic risk scorers included ‘Potential Consequences’ 
ranging from catastrophic losses, to severe, serious, moderate and low. In this second 
edition these have been removed from all scorers except for process because con‑
sequences don’t directly correlate to the risk level of a single system of production 
(technology, physical environment, human resources) but to combinations of risks. 
It’s at the interface with processes that these other systems of production contribute to 
the total risk level of an activity. The scorers in the figures below are therefore greatly 
simplified from those in PSM1. The ranges from 10 (being extreme) to 1 (low) are arbi‑
trary. These are relative so could have been 100 to 1 or 5 to 1. The key is consistency in 
applying the concepts and focusing the risk workshop audience on understanding how 
risk sources can interact to create a dangerous and/or inefficient situation.
proCess
Every process involves the transfer of energy within the system. Electrical energy, 
for instance, is used to generate mechanical energy that in turn can be used to project 
a nail into a piece of wood or crush rocks in a processing plant. The level of energy 
inherent in a process has the potential to cause negative consequences if released in 
an unintended manner and lead to injury or damage. This concept was originally 
proposed in the Energy Transfer Theory of Accident Causation. A worker is injured, 
or equipment damaged through a change of energy and for every change there is a 
source, a path and a receiver (Stellman, 1998). The level of energy determines the 
potential severity of consequences, for example, a spanner falling from a height of ten 
metres will have a higher level of energy than one that falls from two metres. Process 
risks are in many ways directly related to the principles of physics and chemistry.
The severity of residual risk therefore depends on the level of energy involved in a 
process. There are different types of energy that may be present or generated, includ‑
ing kinetic, potential, mechanical, thermal, electrical, radiation and sonar. Each of 
these has characteristics that can result in losses. For instance, moving machinery 
parts can cause crush or impact related harm or damage.
To assess the residual risk of the process, the following steps are proposed:
1. Assume that other systems of production are ideal (technology, physical 
environment, human resources)154 Productive Safety Management
2. Define the process e.g. riding a motorcycle at 100 kilometres per hour
3. Assume that the process occurs in static time (a snapshot rather than a 
movie)
4. Identify the energy involved e.g. kinetic due to riding at 100 kilometres per 
hour
5. Evaluate the potential consequence of this energy e.g. fatality
6. Allocate a score from 1 to 10 using the process residual risk scorer.
As shown in Figure 7.1, by using energy as the primary risk parameter, the score for 
process residual risk is linear and not that different from the rationale of the Risk 
Matrix. It’s when other systems of production are introduced that the differences 
become evident. The basic premise of the process residual risk scorer is that the 
higher the energy, the higher the risk of the activity in terms of how the work is done. 
(PSM1 provided a more detailed explanation of energy types with examples.)
An important rule when using this proposed method is the ‘Principle of Separation 
of Systems of Production’. This is done to give the risk assessor a clearer understand‑
ing of inputs. When looking at each system separately, the others are assumed to be 
ideal – free of residual and entropic risks. For instance, the activity of travelling at 
100 kilometres per hour is considered in an ideal physical environment, by an ‘ideal’ 
person on a ‘perfect’ technology. The level of energy, therefore, depends on the speed 
at which the person or object is going, which in turn, determines the level of residual 
risk relative to other processes. Using the method of isolating processes from other 
system of production allows different processes to be compared. In later stages of 
analysis, other factors are considered, for instance whether the process is undertaken 
in a car or on a motorbike. The residual risk associated with a particular technology 
can be assessed, before considering the residual risks of the rider and the physical 
environment. Figure 7.1 shows the process residual risk scorer in the top panel. The 
primary risk parameter is the energy level. The potential consequences are listed in 
the next column from catastrophic to minor loss and these correlate to the residual 
risk score from 10 to 1.
A key concept in this approach to assessing relative residual risk is that this 
risk affects the probability of losses independently of time because, according to 
the Entropy Model, residual risk can’t be reduced in the short‑term. The process is 
considered in static time to eliminate the concept of ‘exposure’. This is important 
because residual risk doesn’t usually change dramatically in organisational systems 
unless the enterprise has missed something like unforeseen circumstances or cata‑
lysts that act as a trigger. These may be a result of unknown unknowns or incomplete 
information. It may also be because the circumstances have an inherently high level 
of residual risk such as when a worker enters an underground mine. The person 
could be harmed at any time and that’s not necessarily a matter of exposure duration. 
Walking into an unventilated area is forbidden (a ‘golden rule’) for this very reason. 
The harm may be almost instant which is why the Entropy Model states that the strat‑
egy, both organisational and behavioural, is to remain chronically wary of residual 
risks (shown in Figure 1.6 as point 3 of the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy).
In the risk scorers, the potential consequences are losses. These could be 
safety‑related, damage to technologies or the physical environment, disruption to Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 155

teCHnology
The residual risks associated with technology, which includes plant, equipment, 
tools, and chemicals, can be determined in a similar manner. Chemicals can be Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 157
evaluated for the level of residual risk based on toxicity and/or reactivity. The higher 
the level of toxicity, the greater the residual risk. Plant, equipment and tools can 
be assessed using the level of energy involved in the same way as processes were 
analysed, with energy being the primary risk parameter. Technologies, however, as 
discussed in Chapter 4, can have HSE in design characteristics that reduce the level 
of residual risk. Logically, these positive risk modifiers should be taken into consid‑
eration. A definition can be given to these variables such that:
A risk modifier is a characteristic of a system of production that either 
increases or decreases the level of residual risk. Negative risk modifiers 
increase the level of residual risk whereas positive risk modifiers lower this 
level.
Travelling at 100 kilometres per hour on a motorbike, for example, has a higher 
residual risk than travelling at the same speed in a car because the structure protects 
the driver. From a process risk perspective, the residual risk is the same, but the type 
of technology affects the total risk profile of the activity.
A simple process flow can be used to step through the technology residual risk 
scoring activity. The first question is what is it  –  plant/equipment/tool or chemi‑
cal? If the latter, the residual risk relates to the toxicity or reactivity. For plant and 
equipment, the next consideration is kinetic energy, specifically whether it’s fixed or 
mobile. If it’s mobile, the size as well as the energies involved will be key consider‑
ations. If it’s fixed, then the scale, types and levels of energy need to be factored in. 
For both fixed and mobile plant/equipment, HSE in design that either more effec‑
tively contains the energy or allows for rapid shutdown, fire suppression or other 
mitigations to control any potential loss, will reduce the residual risk. For instance, 
drill rigs that have emergency stops in numerous locations allow anyone working on 
or near the rig to shut down operations. Another example is onboard automatic fire 
suppression systems in large earthmoving mobile machines. Features such as these 
reduce the potential damage or injury from the release of inherent energy sources. 
Automatic systems that rely on engineered detection rather than human response 
have a greater impact on residual risk reduction.
The technology residual risk scorer is shown in Figure 7.1 in the second panel. The 
primary risk parameter is the energy/toxicity level. A line can be extended across 
from the energy category somewhere from extreme to low, but a downward adjust‑
ment should be made for HSE in Design that reduces the potential consequences of 
injury, damage or loss. This approach, as opposed to the use of the matrix, gives the 
risk review team, a better understanding of the importance of HSE in Design.
The aim of using risk modifiers is to instil a deep awareness of effective 
risk management strategies such as HSE in design.
pHysiCal environment
As explained in Chapter 5, the PE includes natural locational and infrastructure charac‑
teristics and can comprise a complex set of risks, some of which may not be completely 
understood. It’s impossible to have a comprehensive dataset especially for natural158 Productive Safety Management
environment risks. Man‑made infrastructure and site designs can have shortcomings 
causing a poor fit at the interface between these and other systems of production.
The PE residual risk scorer is shown in the third panel of Figure 7.1. Continuing 
the principles of the process and technology scorers, the primary risk parameter 
is the energy level. For this system of production, however, the energy may not be 
quantifiable. For instance, a 100,000‑litre tank of unleaded petrol has a known set 
of chemical characteristics that define the energy being stored. A cyclone/hurricane 
also has energy, but the intensity can’t be accurately forecast. For that reason, the 
natural PE may better be described in terms of potential threat. Historic data may 
be useful but can’t be relied on. The path of a tornado for instance, may flatten one 
property and leave neighbouring properties relatively undamaged.
PE risks or threats can work in combination which is worth considering. An earth‑
quake can be accompanied by a tsunami, so the consequences are increased signifi‑
cantly by the double impact. The explosion in Enschede in 2000 was a significant 
disaster because of the proximity of residences within the blast range. Insufficient 
lighting underground in an area with cavities substantially increases the inherent 
danger. The combination of conditions is particularly evident in road use when heavy 
precipitation fundamentally causes the residual risk to be more difficult to manage. 
This demands a response of the driver to better manage the residual risk of the pro‑
cess by reducing speed.
The use of the PE residual risk scorer involves identifying the primary energy/
threat first and ascribing a severity level, then adjusting upwards if there are exacer‑
bating hazards or risks. For instance, building a nuclear power plant on a fault line, 
close to the ocean or in the middle of the desert, has very different PE residual risks. 
In the scorer, additional threats are negative risk modifiers that increase the overall 
level of risk with the combination affecting potential consequences.
PE residual risks can lead to losses in three ways. The first is by exposing the 
operation to undesirable energy that puts it at risk, for example, the kinetic energy 
of the hurricane or the potential energy of earth as it saturates with water and starts 
a landslide. The second is that the PE can cause loss of control in other system of 
production, for example, when slippery ground conditions cause a truck to skid or 
a worker to slip and fall. The third is that the residual risk can be a direct threat to 
the health and safety of human beings, such as biohazards or smoke from bushfires.
In the scorer, having taken exacerbating conditions into consideration, the 
PE is then given a residual risk score. These cumulative risks should have been 
acted on when determining the locations of the nuclear power plants in Japan 
that were destroyed by tsunamis. Did the operations team fully understand the 
residual risks they inherited from the project planning, construction and com‑
missioning phases?
Human resourCes
In Chapter 6, the residual risks associated with the HR system of production were 
identified. These were incomplete knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) and physi‑
cal limitations. Whilst the rates of injuries and illnesses amongst older workers have 
risen and younger workers relatively declined in the last 20 years, it remains true that Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 159
younger workers have a higher level of risk tolerance and appetite for risk taking. 
Historically, this was predominantly a young male trait, but societal trends suggest 
that young women are taking more risks than in the past.
Age and experience have a substantial impact on HR residual risk and are identi‑
fied in the HR scorer in Figure 7.1 as the primary risk parameter. The risk can be 
modified through interventions. The modifiers shown provide guidance and each 
organisation should consider its process, technological and PE risk profile, to deter‑
mine what HR modifiers would best apply.
The first of these shown in the scorer is creating a fit between the person and 
the job/work environment from the outset. Many organisations assess this through 
pre‑employment medicals and fitness testing. The assessment should reflect the types 
of tasks done on the job, for instance, manual handling – lifting weights, grip tests 
and aerobic fitness for labour intensive roles. This type of evaluation isn’t critical 
in a low‑risk office environment but in high‑risk environments that are physically 
demanding, they’re a must. This is to ensure the prospective worker is at less risk of 
injury or harm due to a poor fit based on individual factors. The military and enforce‑
ment agencies have used these types of assessments for decades.
The next modifier shown is job‑related competencies. If the workgroup comprises 
many new recruits, then the work team should be managed with higher levels of 
supervision and preferably, placed initially within a controlled environment dur‑
ing the learning phase. An upward adjustment is made if there’s a high percentage 
of workers with less than one years’ experience in the industry. The military and 
enforcement agencies have adopted this approach using training academies. In indus‑
try, however, the longer‑term view on personnel development is seldom taken and the 
pressure to get a recruit working as soon as possible often has a sense of urgency, 
especially for frontline workers in production‑centred industries. Being practical, the 
issue is not so much whether the person can start working but how the recruit’s high 
level of residual risk will be managed.
The final modifier shown is risk management competencies. If the work group 
profile includes well‑developed risk management competencies, then a downward 
adjustment can be made, however, if the workers haven’t received this training, for 
instance, in fatal risks and controls, then the adjustment should be upwards. Thinking 
more broadly, a person with the capacity to evaluate risks dynamically and to adjust 
their behaviour does so as a life skill, not as a workplace‑specific skill. This capa‑
bility takes time to develop and tends to be enduring. It’s driven by an underlying 
understanding of how things work and can play out. When the military approach 
is considered, highly trained specialist forces, as part of their work, are exposed to 
extreme risks and yet, they’re capacity to survive is high because of well‑developed 
risk management competencies.
Using the HR residual risk scorer shown in the bottom section of Figure 7.1 should 
lead the risk assessment team to consider the role of resilience in reducing HR resid‑
ual risks. It also points to some key strategies. These are: firstly, create as best a fit 
between HR and the other systems of production associated with the job as possible; 
secondly, ensure new recruits are managed effectively to minimise residual risks 
during their learning curve; and thirdly, provide personnel with risk‑management 
competencies to build organisational capacity and resilience.160 Productive Safety Management
The scorers are designed to be a learning tool for managers, supervisors 
and risk‑based professionals to direct their mindset away from the singular 
concept of risk and the simplicity of the Risk Matrix. They should focus 
on systems rather than behaviours and take a multidisciplinary approach 
rather than the narrow focus of their discipline (such as safety).
Loss investigators should also be concerned with systems and not start investigations 
with human factors related to the person/s directly involved in the loss event. The 
risk modifiers are provided as strategies for prevention. These encourage understand‑
ing of the key parameters that affect risk levels within systems of production, for 
instance, comparing one workgroup profile against another. When a risk professional 
enters a workplace, they should get a sense of the ‘big picture’ risk profile of the 
workplace across the systems of production rather than simply looking for hazards.
CASE STUDY: RESIDUAL RISK ANALYSIS
A case study is used below to demonstrate how the scorers may be applied. 
Admittedly, this is with the benefit of hindsight but there are lessons to learn for 
prevention of future disasters of this kind. The BP Refinery explosion and fire of 
2005 was discussed briefly in an earlier chapter. In the BP Report, the Colombian 
Accident Investigation Board is referred to because of commonalities between the 
two disasters. The following quote describes NASA’s culture and structure prior to 
the Colombia disaster:
Many accident investigations make the same mistake in defining causes. They identify 
the widget that broke or malfunctioned, then locate the person most closely connected 
with the technical failure: the engineer who miscalculated an analysis, the operator 
who missed signals or pulled the wrong switches, the supervisor who failed to listen, 
or the manager who made bad decisions. When causal chains are limited to technical 
flaws and individual failures, the ensuing responses aimed at preventing a similar event 
in the future are equally limited: they aim to fix the technical problem and replace or 
retrain the individual responsible. Such corrections lead to a misguided and potentially 
disastrous belief that the underlying problem has been solved (CAIB, 2003).
(US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, 2007)
In Figure 7.2, it’s shown that the processes undertaken at the BP site involved extreme 
energy sources, meaning that the residual risk was extreme. From a technological 
perspective, there were deficiencies in HSE in Design. These included a breach iden‑
tified by OSHA when they issued a serious citation alleging that nine relief valves 
from vessels in the Ultraformer No 3 didn’t discharge to a safe place. This exposed 
employees to flammable and toxic vapours (p. 114, US CSHIB, 2007). Changes were 
made according to the company, but OSHA didn’t conduct a follow‑up inspection to 
verify this. The report identifies other design deficiency in the Amoco Regulatory 
Cluster Project done in 1993 and the NDU Flare line sizing in 2002. Neither were 
completed to safety in design standards to accommodate capacity due to cost saving 
decisions. For the 2002 Clean Streams Project, some planned engineering studies Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 161
weren’t completed and again due to cost controls, an essential component, the wet/
dry system was never installed. Later due to scheduling pressures, this project didn’t 
follow safeguards that were part of BP’s Capital Value Process.
The report contains a section (5.7.4) that explains inherently safer approaches such 
as flare systems that combust flammable hydrocarbons before they are vented to the 
atmosphere, to prevent them from becoming a serious fire or explosion risk (p. 119, 
US CSHIB, 2007). From this information, in the technology residual risk scorer,

by a gas oil hydrotreater incident that led to another community order (pp. 237 and 
238, US CSHIB, 2007).
There were also issues with the location of various hazardous processing plant 
on the site which went against HSE in Design requirements. This made the physical 
work environment higher residual risk than needed to be. For instance, the blowdown 
drum and stack didn’t meet engineering specifications for spacing and location of 
refinery process unit equipment (pp. 112 and 113, US CSHIB, 2007). Site trailers 
used as temporary office space and to house tools and other equipment, were located 
between the NDU and ISOM, primarily for convenience. When the disaster occurred, 
this resulted in more personnel in the area than should have been. In the report, a site 
diagram is provided in Figure 15. One of the learnings was that all occupied trailers 
should be located away from vulnerable areas, including relocation outside the refin‑
ery if necessary (p. 129, US CSHIB, 2007). As a result of the lack of HSE in Design 
of the physical work environment, the PE residual risk scorer in Figure 7.2 identifies 
this deficiency as an exacerbating hazard or threat. The residual risk for this system 
of production was certainly a contributor to the catastrophic losses.
Detailed information about the risk profile of the workforce isn’t provided in 
the report, except for a few key individuals. The Day Shift Board Operator had six 
years’ experience, two of the five outside operators had over 15 years in ISOM and 
other operators had nine years (p. 45, US CSHIB, 2007), but some had little experi‑
ence (p. 46, US CSHIB, 2007). Prior to the disaster, two process technicians with 
required capabilities weren’t assigned to assist with the start‑up. As an overall com‑
ment, whilst the necessary competencies were available, these weren’t assigned to 
do the critical work prior to the disaster. It can be implied (based on this limited 
information) that the HR residual risks were on the lower end, but due to ineffective 
allocation of the work, the HR entropic risk was high. (This will be discussed further 
in the next section.)
In Figure  7.2, some assumptions must be made due to information gaps. This 
begins with the age of key personnel. The experience levels of workers and contrac‑
tors are assumed for the purposes of this exercise to be close to 35 years of age. A 
further assumption is that some form of personnel assessment was undertaken to 
ensure that workers were suitable for the job (perhaps, this would have been driven 
by industry standards). The Report indicates that training was generally deficient so 
in the scorer, these competency gaps raise the HR residual risk score pushing the 
potential consequences for HR gaps upwards. A section of the report is dedicated to 
inadequate operator training including for abnormal situation management. The risk 
management training was poor as simulators weren’t used to prepare operators for 
hazardous scenarios. They were ill‑equipped in this regard, and this was primarily 
due to failures of the organisation to manage these HR residual risks.
The scorers in Figure 7.2 highlight the key areas of residual risk associated with this 
disaster. These are:
• Extreme process related energies with catastrophic potential;
• Extreme technological risks related to energies and lack of HSE in Design;
• Moderate PE risks significantly exacerbated by lack of HSE in Design in the 
layout and use of the site footprint and also the proximity of the community 
outside the operational site;164 Productive Safety Management
• Moderate HR risks greatly exacerbated by lack of risk management compe‑
tencies to deal with potential threats and losses of control in other systems 
of production.
The case study will be continued later in this chapter to identify the entropic risks 
that became evident through the incident investigation.
total residual risk sCores
Leaving the case study aside for the moment, once each of the systems of production 
has been scored for the level of residual risk, these can be combined into activities. 
An activity involves workers undertaking a process using technology in a physical 
workplace. This can be represented as an equation:
Activity = Process + Human Resources + Technology + Physical Environment
A suite of activities can be compared by assigning the scores to get a total residual 
risk score for each activity. The formula is:
Total Residual Risk Score = Prr × HRrr × Trr × PErr
Multiplication is used rather than addition because major deficiencies, for instance, in 
HSE in Design, will have a significant impact on the total residual risk. For instance, 
a highly trained military team equipped with the best technologies, when entering a 
physically dangerous environment, trekking with little or no risk of enemy encounter, 
will still be exposed to high risk. An example could include hiking through jungle in 
a foreign land. The multiplication results in an exponential effect when high residual 
risk systems of production are combined. For instance, allowing apprentice mechan‑
ics to undertake complex, hazardous tasks such as removing large components from 
a piece of machinery using block and chain lifting equipment.
This proposed method of activity‑based risk analysis is more comprehensive than 
approaches using the Risk Matrix and ‘What If Analysis’ because the focus is on 
understanding the work as it’s done. With this approach, it may be possible to develop 
a system‑wide residual risk profile for a workplace and in particular, high‑risk com‑
binations to be identified.
When the Total Residual Risk Score for an activity is calculated, the result can 
range from 10,000 (10×10×10×10) to 1 (1×1×1×1). Once all the scores for different 
activities in a workplace are calculated, these can be graphed to identify peak risks. 
High‑risk activities should be given greatest priority. According to the Four‑Step Risk 
Management Strategy, resources should be allocated to ensure that such risks are 
effectively managed in the short‑term and reduced in the longer term. For instance, 
the organisation may find that its processes are of such high residual risk and are 
pervasive to the extent that the best method of risk reduction is to change the way a 
process is carried out so that workers are removed from danger. Examples of where 
this has occurred include the use of robots or remote‑control technologies to carry 
out hazardous work. A medium‑sized haulage company that uses vehicle‑mounted Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 165
cranes may retrofit remote controlled systems that allow the operator to work from 
a safe distance and have a better, unobstructed view compared to a manually con‑
trolled system installed on the side of the truck.
An enterprise may need to consider significant systemic changes if one or more 
systems of production has a major residual risk that is difficult to manage, especially 
if a technological solution is available to remove the worker from the hazardous situ‑
ation. For example, in operations with an extreme PE residual risk, extensive invest‑
ment in standard technology, HR capability and work practice improvement won’t 
necessarily compensate for the PE residual risk, unless the interface between work‑
ers and that environment is changes. Subsea maintenance on oil rigs is an example. 
In the North Sea, the residual risk associated with the ‘workplace’ is extreme. If div‑
ers undertaken maintenance, investment in safer equipment, training and procedural 
controls can’t mitigate these risks completely. If, however, the worker is isolated from 
immediate danger and the task carried out remotely, then the residual risk is reduced 
substantially. The process residual risk score decreases because the worker is no 
longer directly at the interface with the physical environment. The technology score 
drops because of HSE in Design. The HR score declines because the work no longer 
involves physical demands. Only the PE score remains the same. Changing the way 
in which a process is carried out can therefore greatly reduce the total residual risk. 
Liu (2022) wrote a paper on the use of remotely operated vehicles (ROV) in subsea 
engineering which explains these current and future possibilities.
Large organisations with mature systems tend to carry out detailed risk assess‑
ments. Quite often these are mandated for insurance processes and as a result, drive 
their operational risk controls. Other less resourced businesses benefit from regularly 
carrying out a self‑assessment (as discussed in previous chapters). Whilst risk manage‑
ment is compulsory in jurisdictions with HSE legislation, it’s also good business prac‑
tice. The challenge for most is where to start and often the obstacle is being too close 
to the operations to see the real issues and opportunities. A good starting point is to 
have open discussions about the safety, efficiency and quality issues that cause frustra‑
tion in the workplace. It’s from these conversations that managers and supervisors may 
identify low‑cost ways of reducing residual risks. The key with known residual risks is 
to manage them effectively in the short‑term but also to envision safer, more efficient 
ways of working one year, two years and further into the future of the enterprise.
Many SME owners and managers believe capital investment for safety 
is expensive. What they should be considering is how efficiency can be 
improved concurrently to maximise return on that investment.
There are other benefits that are often overlooked. For instance, an SME manager 
should showcase the business’ improvements to current and potential clients to build 
their business brand. An overhaul of the maintenance workshop following Lean prin‑
ciples with a place for everything in its place can be demonstrated with before and 
after photos. Clients are often interested to hear about safety, productivity and qual‑
ity improvements because it provides them with reassurance that they’ve engaged the 
services of a competent, responsible contractor. The feedback from the client can be 
taken back to the workers who implemented the workshop improvements.166 Productive Safety Management
Focusing solely on the costs of residual risk reduction is a tunnel‑vision 
mindset that holds businesses back from success.
Managers should showcase these investments and any improvements in 
safety, production, and quality, to stakeholders such as clients.
They should be thinking longer‑term about the business’ total value 
proposition.
Importantly, the people who do the day‑to‑day work should be included in celebrat‑
ing the ‘Felt Success’ of the business, especially when there’s positive feedback from 
senior management, clients, regulators and others.
This discussion has highlighted that every organisation, no matter how large or 
small, should have a strategy for residual risk reduction. A narrow focus on cost 
keeps businesses in a cycle of losses such as inefficiencies, safety incidents, qual‑
ity deficiencies, despondent personnel, and frustrated clients. Organisational leaders 
with an open‑mind to opportunities explore tangible benefits and positive flow‑on 
effects of business improvement. For any professional whose job is to put forward 
improvements to senior management, it pays to prepare a case that includes ‘hard’ 
business benefits and ‘soft’ leveraging opportunities that build reputation and poten‑
tial future earnings.
ENTROPIC RISK PREVENTION STRATEGIES
As discussed in previous chapters, operations inherit residual risk from the project 
planning, construction and commissioning phases of a site or facility. The quality 
of the inputs they inherit also affects an operation’s susceptibility to entropic risk as 
systems of production degrade with time.
Oswald et al. (2020) wrote about construction as an industry structured for ‘unsafety’ 
and explored the cost‑safety conundrum in project delivery. It’s worth reviewing 
some of these comments and interchanging ‘losses’ for ‘accidents’ whilst consider‑
ing industry more broadly. They identified three costs of prevention:
• Fixed prevention: costs typically being incurred on plant and equipment 
before production begins and exist regardless of the accident rate.
• Variable prevention: costs proportional to accident frequency rates and their 
severity. They are linked to the time taken for accident analysis, cause iden‑
tification and implementation of corrective measures.
• Unexpected prevention: costs initially unforeseen such as an equipment 
modification to lower noise levels, or changes in legislative requirements or 
cultural norms.
(Oswald et al., 2020)
The Entropy Model explains that the focus with entropic risk should be on preven‑
tion of losses so it’s important that organisations better understand their sources of 
entropic risk to prioritise protection programmes. With the model, mitigation starts 
with taking timely corrective action to halt escalation. The next step is to review Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 167
trends and implement proactive maintenance practices. Entropic risk can be variable 
so can’t be semi‑quantitatively assessed in the same way as residual risk which is 
relatively fixed due to technological and resourcing constraints. A methodology was 
proposed in PSM1 with the formula for total entropic risk of an activity being:
Total Entropic Risk Score = Per × Ter × PEer × HRer
For instance, two companies can be compared for their vulnerability to entropic risk. 
Company A has state‑of‑the‑art technology and a relatively inexperienced work‑
force. Company B has old technology and experienced personnel. The former would 
be susceptible to HR entropic risks and needs to invest in capability development 
whereas the latter must address the wear and tear of its technology as a priority. 
As was the case with residual risk analysis, the entropic risks associated with each 
system of production should be considered independently of each other. This again 
applies the Principle of Separation of Systems of Production.
proCesses
In Chapter 3, it was shown that the sources of entropic risk in processes occur at the 
interface with other systems of production. Vulnerability to degradation depends ini‑
tially on the quality of inputs (e.g. plant, equipment and infrastructure components) 
determined at the project planning phase and whenever modifications or changes 
occur. The second consideration is the fit between process design (how the work is 
done) and the physical and human assets of the enterprise.
It’s worth noting that preventing entropic risk isn’t simply a case of building reli‑
ability into systems of production. According to Bourassa et al. (2016) in relation to 
the technology system of production, there are many studies on optimisation of pro‑
duction and maintenance activities. There are gaps, however, as studies on the effects 
of reliability are rare. As a result, safety and reliability are considered distinct, not 
interdependent. The researchers indicate that a system can be reliable and concur‑
rently unsafe, and vice versa. It’s agreed, however, that good maintenance increases 
efficiency and lowers incident rates.
What is important is the extent and thoroughness with which the organisation 
uses activities, such as inspections, incident investigations and other data gather‑
ing processes, to take corrective action and to implement maintenance strategies. 
Fundamentally, entropic risk is prevented through risk management that becomes 
tangible in operational practice and behavioural habits. These should focus on keep‑
ing systems of production at optimised performance.
An enterprise can assess its resilience against degradation by evaluating 
the effectiveness of its operational feedback and response systems, and 
KPIs for programmes that maintain or improve the quality of its 
systems of production.
Entropic risk is variable and difficult to quantify at any given point in time or over 
a period using the Risk Matrix. The matrix will simply lead to the conclusion that 168 Productive Safety Management
wear and tear of equipment or fatigue in people or corrosion of infrastructure or 
deviation from safe work processes can occur. In practice, what tends to happen 
is equipment failure, worker fatigue, infrastructure collapse and unsafe behaviours, 
become separate line items in the enterprise’s operational risk register. These are 
then given a score based on the Risk Matrix and controls assigned to reduce the risk 
level. Unfortunately, any one of these could be classified as a fatal risk. Ironically, a 
worker who is fatigued and sitting at the office desk is more likely to risk embarrass‑
ment than cause a serious incident. The point is that the risk happens at the interface 
with other systems of production not in isolation so singular classification can be 
meaningless without context.
There is another consideration when evaluating entropic risk in processes. This is 
the dynamic nature of work. Khanzode et al. (2011) studied recurring hazards in under‑
ground coal mines and in support of the work in PSM1, acknowledged that work system 
components continuously deteriorate. They stated that the frequency or time between 
occurrences (TBO) were measures of this deterioration. In response, a monitoring sys‑
tem was proposed for hazard recurrence phenomenon. Mathematical distributions were 
used (Weibull and Poisson) to define control limits. The situation was alarming because 
hazard occurrences at the time of the study, were going to continue with similar magni‑
tude in the days ahead unless a major systems overhaul was undertaken.
This system overhaul may be planned in terms of technology‑related, process‑related, 
physical environment‑related and human‑related factors. (Mol 2003)
(Khanzode et al., 2011)
The researchers focused on degradation rather than rising entropic risk in relation 
to these recurrent hazards. Control limits (LCL – lower control limit; UCL – upper 
control limit) were used to evaluate the extent of hazardous conditions in an area of 
the underground mine.
If the observations fall close to the LCL or show a downward trend, it is indicative of 
system deterioration for the hazard considered. On the other hand, observations close 
to the UCL or showing upward trend indicate improvements in the system. However, in 
both cases the work system is not under control and assignable causes can be identified 
for such behavior. A work system is said to be in control if the control chart shows only 
random pattern of the observations.
(Khanzode et al., 2011)
This reinforces a key point discussed in earlier chapters. There will be variability in 
entropic risk and what the work of Khanzode et al. suggests is that random patterns/
trends of observations in relation to hazard occurrences can lead to assignable causes. 
If these causes are identified and removed, this can lead to immediate improvements 
in safety. As a practical example, if it’s found that tradespersons regularly must run 
electrical leads across pedestrian thoroughfares because the power source is too far 
from where the work must be done (an assignable cause), this can be rectified by 
installing power leads overhead. A further improvement would be to install power 
points above each workstation. Notably, this improvement would reduce the safety 
risk but also improve efficiency.Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 169
The Process Entropic Risk Scorer shown in Figure  7.3 illustrates complexity 
as the primary risk parameter. When the work is organised in overly involved lay‑
ers of procedures, this can tip the system into informal management of the work to 
expedite results (Hollnagel’s ETTO – efficiency is chosen over thoroughness). There 
are numerous human factors that will determine whether complex systems lead to 
compliance or at least, attempted compliance. (These human factors, due to their 
own breadth and depth, are left out of this discussion. Leveson (2012) talks about 
‘Complexity and Safety’; Dekker et al. (2011) explore the complexity of failure and 
the implications for safety investigations. These are in the chapter references.)
In operations, complexity is a hindrance. It can be a recipe for failure in terms 
of compliance, delivery of the work and is counter to a culture of productive, safety 
management. The risk modifiers shown in the process entropic risk scorer, in the first 
panel of Figure 7.3, are firstly, simplification and standardisation with an upward 
adjustment to the risk if there’s been no process review to achieve these workable

The second risk modifier is the regularity, thoroughness, and follow‑up of moni‑
toring. An upward adjustment is made if high risk tasks aren’t monitored, a transfer 
across is done if operational leaders are involved in the monitoring and follow‑up 
programmes, and a downward adjustment made if supervisors and workers par‑
ticipate in the review. These adjustments point to a few learning opportunities for 
the risk workshop audience. Firstly, the organisation must have a fatal risk critical 
control programme in place to reduce the potential for process entropic risks. This, 
for instance, includes assessing the effectiveness of crucial procedural controls such 
as permit to work systems. Secondly, operational leaders (who are the risk own‑
ers) must be involved in monitoring the processes that occur within their work area. 
Accountability for follow‑up corrective actions and maintenance practices resides 
with them. Thirdly, the downward adjustment is made for operational participation 
because this provides a sense check to ensure that gaps don’t arise in procedures and 
other controls. Instructions must reflect how the work is done not how the work is 
imagined to be done (as per Dekker’s WAI versus WAD).

FIGURE 7.3 (Continued)Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 171
The scorer indicates that process degradation is most likely to occur in complex 
work practices. When workers have a simple task to perform deviations from safe, 
efficient practices are less likely to occur. Complex and/or unfamiliar tasks have a 
higher level of risk for two reasons. The first is that the requirements of the job can 
stretch the competencies of the workers, and second, the risks involved might not be 
fully appreciated.
The engagement of and input from workers is a critical piece in process entropic 
risk prevention. This ties back to the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy of the 
Entropy Model. The work behaviours that are encouraged in a risk‑based culture are:
1. Take corrective action to rectify areas of degradation (and ensure that 
behaviours don’t lead to degradation such as poor housekeeping);
2. Make and implement sound suggestions to prevent degradation, especially 
for recurrent issues;
3. Manage residual risks by exercising chronic wariness;
4. Make suggestions to reduce residual risk in the longer‑term so that man‑
agement are better informed when reaching risk‑based decisions that affect 
operations.
The first two points are directed at entropic risk prevention whilst the last two are 
centred on residual risk management. Efficiency can be part of risk‑based reviews 
and job planning activities.
OSH legislation states that work must be done safely.
There are no clauses to say that it can’t also be efficient.
Safety and efficiency can be achieved concurrently if entropic risks that 
lead to loss of control, are prevented.
Every risk‑based activity is an opportunity to not only plan work that goes well but 
also build organisational knowledge and capacity through a deep understanding of 
how entropic risks arise and how these can lead to losses impacting safety, produc‑
tion, and quality.
teCHnology
In Chapter 4, it was shown that the sources of entropic risk for the technology sys‑
tem of production included wear and tear and the technology/operator interface. 
When equipment is used for the wrong purpose, when the physical environment puts 
machinery under mechanical strain, and when personnel operate it roughly, wear and 
tear is accelerated. The primary variable that affects a technology’s exposure to these 
sources of degradation is its age and usage rate. This is illustrated in the Technology 
Entropic Risk Scorer in the second panel of Figure 7.3.
New equipment has a lead‑time before it begins to show signs of wear and tear. 
Old technologies reach the point where the costs of maintenance exceed the benefits 172 Productive Safety Management
of continued operation. In the scorer, preventative maintenance is a risk modifier. 
Lack of maintenance raises the entropic risk score. Regularly scheduled maintenance 
reduces the score. If this is supported by a planned, thorough monitoring regime with 
corrective actions followed through in a timely manner, the entropic risk score is 
reduced further. A different approach may be required for chemicals which also fall 
into the technology system of production. For instance, containers and the like will 
perish with time so this should be considered.
In industries such as oil and gas, big data analytics have been an emerging trend 
(Mohammadpoor & Torabi, 2020). The information is sourced from data recording 
sensors in exploration, drilling and production operations. The analysis results in 
numerous benefits, including reduced drilling time and increasing safety, optimised 
performance of production pumps, and improving petrochemical asset manage‑
ment. The reliability of these processes is continually being enhanced. Interestingly, 
Pettinger (2014) gathered data from safety inspections and found these can be used 
to develop safety predictive analytics. Unfortunately, the study tended to focus on 
behaviours and compliance. Other studies found that big data about hydrogen sul‑
phide levels can be used to forecast hazard events and disruptions to production 
(Mohammadpoor & Torabi, 2020). The possibilities are expanding in the industry 
and likely being introduced into other highly mechanised operations.
Less sophisticated industries can focus on the fundamentals of preventative mainte‑
nance, inspection regimes and corrective action close‑out to minimise the degradation of 
plant, equipment and tools. It’s good practice to consider the lifecycle of plant and equip‑
ment with the view to replacement ahead of reliability and safety issues. A key consid‑
eration is to make informed decisions about the residual risks and future entropic risks 
of any new technologies and consider this against both short‑term and long‑term costs.
pHysiCal environment
The PE system of production includes infrastructure and locational conditions. In 
Chapter 5, it was explained that the PE suffers natural degradation, and this can be 
accelerated by a poor fit with other systems of production. For instance, conditions 
deteriorate more rapidly when operators drive on the edge of the road rather than in 
the centre of the lane. Technology can cause deterioration when poorly maintained 
plant drips oil onto the road. Processes can further change the environment in unde‑
sirable ways such as when an ore truck is overloaded causing damage to haul roads or 
destabilisation of ore tipping ramps (as well as additional wear and tear on the truck).
The rate of deterioration of locational conditions can be difficult to quantify 
A significant variable in entropic risk is the suitability of the site for the purpose and 
the quality of site design and planning. During the life of the operation, any design 
shortcomings that lead to increased degradation tend to become apparent. On sites, 
a slope may become unstable, and a hollow may fill with water due to poor drainage. 
All these issues add to operational work and may increase risks. A further example is 
the ‘concrete cancer’ and corrosion of infrastructure in coastal areas. The life stage 
of the operation provides some indication of potential entropic risk. The PE Risk 
Scorer, shown in the third panel in Figure 7.3, uses the age of infrastructure or condi‑
tion of the PE as the primary risk parameter.Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 173
The same rationale is applied as was done for technology. The scorer shows two 
risk modifiers which are again preventative maintenance with regular, thorough 
inspections. Corrective actions are followed up in a timely manner to either rectify 
degraded states and/or prevent future degradation. A downward adjustment is made 
for a proactive preventative programme and an upward adjustment if this isn’t in 
place. Inspection regimes ensure that infrastructure and the work site are safe and 
reliable thereby mitigating the risk of rising entropic risk and failures.
Examples of bridge collapses due to corrosion can be found on the internet. In salt 
mines, these risks are ever present, and the inspection regimes need to be rigorous, 
however, some corrosion might not be visible, for instance, to the internal surfaces 
of ship loading facilities. The collapse of a conveyor system could result in fatalities 
and would certainly halt supply to customers, and in many jurisdictions, be report‑
able to the regulator. Because of the high risks and potential consequences involved, 
salt mining companies should undertake planned non‑destructive testing (NDT) of 
infrastructure and plant in accordance with engineering recommendations. There are 
several methods that can be applied to evaluate the degradation of materials due to 
the environment according to various types of corrosion. These include ultrasonic, 
radiographic, thermographic, electromagnetic and optical NDT (Singh et al., 2019).
As a broader lesson for industry, including SME owners and managers, it’s naive 
to assume that infrastructure will last forever. Most structural building products 
deteriorate with time. Both a short‑term preventative approach to maximise the life 
of infrastructure should be implemented along with a longer‑term replacement or 
upgrade strategies. The natural PE also changes. For instance, the second‑largest 
wildfire in California was sparked when power lines contacted a tree (CNN, 2022), 
highlighting that mother nature continues to shift infrastructure towards degraded 
conditions. The lesson is that all parts of the operational site should be inspected on 
a regular basis and timely corrective action taken if conditions deteriorate away from 
a safe state.
Human resourCes
In Chapter 6, the entropic risks associated with the HR system of production were 
identified. These included the new employee who is more likely to deviate from 
standard practices and optimal behaviours. Other entropic risks that were discussed 
included fatigue and ill health. These may be due to individual characteristics or 
induced by work‑related systems such as shift work, long hours and demanding 
tasks. The probability of losses also increases with excessive job requirements that 
cause stress or difficulty in maintaining concentration. Earlier accident causation 
models supported the notion that some HR profiles have a greater tendency towards 
risk‑taking behaviour, and this may lead to intentional safety deviations compared to 
others. As discussed previously, this needs to be put into context within the system 
especially when undertaking an incident investigation. The behaviours of the indi‑
viduals directly involved should be the last area of interest after system deficiencies 
have been thoroughly assessed.
The HR Entropic Risk Scorer shown in the last panel of Figure  7.3 assumes 
that older workers are lower risk than younger workers who have less developed 174 Productive Safety Management
competencies and lower levels of risk awareness. Accordingly, the age of personnel 
within a job classification affects not only their level of residual risk but also their 
tendency towards entropic risk. The Scorer defines average age by job classification 
as the primary risk parameter.
In the second column, risk modifiers are taken into consideration. An adjustment 
is made upwardly for jobs and work practices that place high demands on workers. 
This includes physically and mentally demanding tasks, long hours, shift work and 
lengthy commuting times. Some personnel who work in remote areas on a fly‑in 
fly‑out basis, for example, must get up very early to catch a plane before starting 
the first shift of the cycle. Before they start work, there is preparation time, travel 
time to the airport, flight time and travel to the work site, before duties commence. 
Similarly, personnel who drive long distances between home and work are at greater 
risk of fatigue and therefore an increased probability of an accident whilst at work 
and whilst travelling. Job and travel demands are included as negative risk modifiers. 
(It should be noted that many employers’ insurance policies don’t cover the workers’ 
commute so whether travel time is a consideration will depend on the enterprise.)
The second risk modifier shown is workplace‑specific competencies. Each organ‑
isation and workplace are different. Even if businesses are in the same industry, the 
variations can be significant which requires new incumbents to go through a learn‑
ing curve or adaptation period. For the sake of simplicity, the scorer assumes it takes 
the average worker one year to gain sufficient experience to appreciate and man‑
age workplace‑specific risks and to become competent in meeting both compliance 
requirements and cultural expectations. A work team of mostly new personnel would 
warrant an upward adjustment of the HR entropic risk level.
The final risk modifier shown is risk management competencies. These should be 
developed as a life skill that supports the organisation’s risk management objectives.
The emphasis of training should be on transferable knowledge and skills 
that enable a person to adapt and adjust according to the dynamic nature 
of the risks of work (and life) activities.
This is an important element of building resilience and capability in an organisation. 
In the scorer, an upward adjustment is made if this type of training and on‑the‑job 
learning opportunities aren’t provided to workers and a downward adjustment made 
if this is an embedded programme or way of working within the organisation.
Each organisation should consider its operational risk profile and adapt the residual 
and entropic risk scorers to best fit including adapting the risk modifiers. What has 
been provided in Figures 7.1 and 7.3 are examples that whilst not specifically tested 
empirically do align with findings of various researched studies.
CASE STUDY: ENTROPIC RISK ANALYSIS
Earlier, the BP Refinery explosion and fire of 2005 report was reviewed to identify 
residual risks within each of the systems of production prior to the catastrophic loss. 
In the section below, the entropic risks will be identified and used to complete the 
risk scorers based on available information.Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 175
The report alludes to the complexity of the processes that were undertaken at 
the BP Refinery, and in particular, losses of control escalating when the work devi‑
ated from expected operational performance. This was exacerbated by the failure to 
establish effective safe operating limits (p. 100, US CSHIB, 2007). In the first panel 
of Figure 7.4, the initial primary risk parameter in the Process Entropic Risk Scorer 
is marked as high. A key inference throughout the report is that systems weren’t 
working as expected. The regularity of this suggests that limited effort had been 
made to review, simplify and standardise processes to ensure consistent safety and 
reliability. An upward adjustment is made accordingly.
There are numerous references to the fact that serious previous incidents weren’t 
acted on highlighting issues with the culture (pp.  18 and 25, US CSHIB, 2007). 
Where inspections were undertaken and defects or deficiencies found, these weren’t 
rectified. It can be concluded that process monitoring regimes were inadequate. This 
leads to another upward adjustment in the risk scorer. The result is that the process

FIGURE 7.4 Applying the entropic risk scorers to the BP Refinery Disaster Case Study176 Productive Safety Management
entropic risk prior to the incident was at catastrophic levels, which is what eventuated 
on 23 March 2005.
The blowdown drum and stack were constructed in 1953 indicating aging tech‑
nologies were still in operation. The Technology Entropic Risk Scorer, in the second 
panel of the figure, therefore, starts near high based on age and usage rate. Various 
modifications were considered by management, and some implemented through 
to the 2002 Clean Streams Project but not necessarily to expected standards. In 
terms of entropic risks, the potential was high due to deficiencies in the mechani‑
cal integrity programme with a ‘run to failure’ approach common practice (p. 25, 
US CSHIB, 2007). Technological risks were poorly managed due to gaps in process 
safety information, maintenance procedures and training, plus deficiencies in the 
database maintenance programme (p. 25, US CSHIB, 2007). Instrumentation fail‑
ures were prevalent (p. 130, US CSHIB, 2007). Monitoring regimes for technologies 
were inadequate, for instance, corrective action wasn’t taken to repair the malfunc‑
tioning key splitter tower instrumentation and equipment. The level transmitter was 
also not repaired, and the pressure control valve was inoperable (p. 48, US CSHIB,

2007). These examples indicate a defective programme for monitoring of technologi‑
cal degradation and the failure to follow up on corrective actions. A further upward 
adjustment is made in the scorer with the result being high entropic risk in this sys‑
tem of production.
One of the key findings of the report was that the layout of site put more people at 
risk. Entropic risk was introduced by placing trailers used for office accommodation 
near the processing plant. Initially, it was intended that this practice would be tempo‑
rary, but it became a permanent arrangement (p. 122, US CSHIB, 2007). A manage‑
ment of change (MOC) process was completed for the siting of a double‑wide mobile 
office trailer but none of the MOC team had been training in the guidance document 
used for the building siting analysis.
The report also indicates that traffic, including parking of vehicles, hadn’t been 
controlled including during the more hazardous periods of startup, shutdown or 
other abnormal conditions. It’s stated that “drivers were not restricted for parking or 
leaving vehicles idling close to a process unit outer battery limit, where the vehicle 
engine could introduce a potential ignition source” (p. 141, US CSHIB, 2007). The 
key issues that were common to technological entropic risk were evident with the 
physical workplace, so the risk scorer shows the same pattern of escalating entropic 
risk.
Finally, there are several clues related to HR entropic risks prior to the incident. 
For this exercise, a few assumptions are made due to gaps in the information in the 
report. The average age of workers is again assumed to be in the early 30s based on 
the small sample of workers described in the report (i.e. the same as for residual risk). 
The HR Entropic Risk Scorer shown in the last panel of Figure 7.4 starts at this level.
Operator fatigue was identified in the report as a significant issue for the Day 
Board Operator who had worked 12‑hour shifts for 29 consecutive days and slept 
5–6 hours in 24‑hour periods. The Night and Day Lead Operators had worked 33 and 
37 days straight, respectively. All worked 12‑hour shifts (pp. 88 and 89, US CSHIB, 
2007). The discussions expanded on the impact of this fatigue on cognitive fixation. 
Personnel were reducing pressure in the plant without questioning why the pressure 
spikes were occurring. The real problem was not recognised. A significant upward 
adjustment is made in the job demands section of the risk scorer.
New employees were present in the workplace, but this didn’t appear to be an 
overriding factor in the incident. A flat transfer is made in the scorer under work‑
place‑specific competencies. Gaps in risk management capability are a consis‑
tent theme in the report. These were evident as compliance deficiencies at all 
levels of the refinery including management who didn’t lead by example, lack of 
response to surveys, studies and audits that identified deep‑seated safety problems 
(p.  26, US CSHIB, 2007). There was inadequate risk review for management of 
change (p. 26, US CSHIB, 2007) and specific issues that required pre‑start up safety 
review (p. 47, US CSHIB, 2007). Training was deficient in most areas (p. 162, US 
CSHIB, 2007) and it may be assumed therefore, that transferable risk management 
competencies were also lacking. In fact, the report states that these risk awareness 
blind spots were found in business units across the corporation. Business unit manag‑
ers didn’t understand or control major hazards (p. 184, US CSHIB, 2007). A further 
upward adjustment is made in the scorer with a resulting high HR entropic risk.178 Productive Safety Management
The completed scorers in Figure 7.4 tell a consistent narrative of degraded states 
in all systems of production prior to the refinery explosion and fire. The report find‑
ings indicate underlying root causes related to serious leadership and cultural issues 
that pervaded the operation. The recommendations therefore targeted these as a pri‑
ority. The case study provides valuable lessons learned for all organisations, not just 
those in the oil and gas industry. Degraded systems of production lead to losses.
(Dr  Andrew Hopkins (2021) undertook a review of this case study from the 
perspective of high reliability organisations (HROs) and provides a cautionary 
approach to HRO programmes. This is also worth reading and can be found at: 
A‑Practical‑Guide‑to‑becoming‑a‑High‑Reliability‑Organisation‑Andrew‑Hopkins.
pdf (aihs.org.au)).
total entropiC risk sCores
As explained earlier, the formula for the total entropic risk score of an activity is:
Total Entropic Risk Score = Per × Ter × PEer × HRer
As was the case with residual risk, multiplication is used rather than addition 
because major deficiencies, for instance, lack of corrective action and maintenance 
practices will have a significant impact on the total entropic risk. The BP Refinery 
Case Study provides evidence of numerous areas of degradation across the systems 
of production prior to the disaster.
Using the scale provided, the Total Entropic Risk Score for an activity will gener‑
ate a result ranging from 10,000 (10×10×10×10) to 1 (1×1×1×1). Once all the scores 
for different activities in a workplace are calculated, these could be graphed to iden‑
tify peak entropic risks. According to the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy, 
resources should be allocated to ensure that entropic risks are prevented well ahead 
of significant losses being incurred. An organisation may be able to look at the results 
and identify which of its systems presents the greatest risk at interfaces with the other 
systems of production.
In the aviation sector, the concept of degradation has been researched for some 
time. This is referred to as ‘Degraded Modes of Operation’. It’s been a central theme 
in the analysis of aviation incidents. Findings uncovered situations where teams of 
co‑workers continued to operate safety critical systems even when key components of 
their technological infrastructure were compromised (Johnson and Shea, 2007). The 
researchers identified a culture of ‘make do’ or ‘work arounds’ to continue operations.
In practice, this phenomenon of workers ‘making a plan’ isn’t uncommon for 
many reasons such as those discussed in Chapter 2 in reference to the Alignment 
Fallacy. The onus is therefore, on managers and supervisors to go and see what’s hap‑
pening operationally for themselves and to ask questions that don’t infer blame. This 
curiosity should particularly focus on these degraded modes of operation whereby, 
systems continue to operate but below performance expectations. Managers should 
have a sense of urgent concern because continuity of production amidst degraded 
states (and rising entropic risk) isn’t sustainable. At some point, the system’s toler‑
ances will be exceeded.Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 179
Lessons can be learned by taking an engineering perspective on these 
degraded systemic states within an operation. Failures can be degraded or 
incipient according to engineering definitions.
A failure which is gradual or partial; it does not cease all function but compromises 
that function. It may lower output below a designated point, raise output above a des‑
ignated point or result in erratic output. A degraded mode might allow only one mode 
of operation. If left unattended, the degraded mode may result in a catastrophic failure.
(American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 2024)
They also refer to ‘Incipient failure’:
An imperfection in the state or condition of hardware such that a degraded or cata‑
strophic failure can be expected to result if corrective action is not taken.
(American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 2024)
The incipient failure alludes to not only entropic risk but also the possibility of an 
‘imperfection’. This may be an unforeseen residual risk. It’s therefore important for 
senior and site managers, and risk‑based professionals, to understand the residual and 
entropic risks of their operations to avoid losses. Unmanaged, these will eventually 
affect the bottom line of the organisation.
total risk profile
In PSM1, the concept of a Total Risk Profile was proposed. Some examples were 
used that manipulated the residual and entropic risk scores of different scenarios to 
identify priorities for risk reduction. Overall, as was shown in the BP Refinery Case 
Study, the key areas that should be focused on at the operational site level are preven‑
tion of degradation and management of residual risks. This applies regardless of the 
size of the enterprise or the industry that it operates in. Organisations should concen‑
trate efforts on these fundamentals of risk management to reduce the likelihood of 
safety incidents, losses to production and deficiencies in quality.
Effective risk management requires the consistent operational discipline 
to set quality standards for systems of production and to maintain those 
standards. Operational discipline is evident when tasks are executed 
in a structured, deliberate way.
What this means is that corrective action must be taken in a timely manner to avoid 
‘Incipient Failures’ in one or more of the systems of production. There’s no room for 
‘making do’ or laissez‑faire management. In this regard, the style of management 
becomes secondary if this consistency is applied. For instance, day‑to‑day visible 
enforcement on a short‑term construction contract may be an appropriate supervi‑
sor approach to achieving safety, schedule, and quality performance. The effective‑
ness of this style would, however, be specific to the context. In the longer term, for 180 Productive Safety Management
instance, at an established facility, a culture that has embedded operational discipline 
in how people go about their work is more resilient than strategies for short‑term 
obedience.
WORKER EXPOSURE: THE COMPLETE PROFILE
Because of its importance, this total risk profile approach is again presented to clarify 
the complexity of worker exposure at any given point in time. The following formula 
draws together the risk sources from each of the systems of production including the 
worker’s specific inputs.
Worker Exposure at a given point in time =
Level of residual risk in the process, physical environment and technologies
+ Levels of entropic risk in process, physical environment and technologies
+ Level of competencies and physical ability of co‑workers (i.e. others’ 
residual risks)
+ Level of co‑workers’ degradation (i.e. others’ entropic risks)
+ Level of worker‑specific competencies and physical ability (i.e. their own residual risk)
+ Level of worker‑specific degradation (i.e. their own level of entropic risk)
(adapted from Van der Stap, 2008).
This also helps to contextualise the current debate about ‘no blame’ and procedural 
fairness when it comes to incident investigations that involve organisational losses. 
There are numerous risk factors (external to the individual) that need to be consid‑
ered before anyone targets the person involved as having ‘failed the system’. The last 
four inputs point to human factors; however, the quality and condition of these are 
also determined by systems of control to a large extent.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, the current practical interpretation and application of ALARP was 
challenged on the basis that as an operation becomes more established, incident 
investigations and other lessons learned tend to move into low value thoroughness 
actions that don’t necessarily reduce risks. Instead, the risk may rise due to increas‑
ing complexity. The quandary is that managers feel compelled to do something as 
doing nothing is not an option. There’s a tendency to add more administrative controls 
rather than going back to the fundamentals of effective risk management that involve 
HSE in design of technologies, the physical workplace and processes (how the work is 
done). There’s an over‑reliance on actions directed at improving human performance 
rather than creating a safer, more efficient workplace. Such administrative controls 
are an easy option due to lower cost compared to higher order engineering controls.
A significant hindrance to operational risk management is that it’s constrained 
by current risk assessment processes based on the Safety Risk Assessment Matrix. 
These are more akin to Work as Imagined than Work as Done because it’s based on Risk Quantification and Management Strategy 181
‘What If Analysis’ rather than what’s happening in the workplace. The interfaces 
between systems of production tend to be overlooked. An alternative mental model 
was presented which identifies and assesses the residual and entropic risks in the four 
systems of production. From these, eight risk scorers were developed which factor 
in the primary risk parameter such as energy level, and risk modifiers which either 
increase or decrease the risk level. These take the risk review team directly to the 
underlying strategies for risk reduction. In addition, the approach is systems‑driven 
(inclusive of HR risks) not centred on behaviours. Each organisation should consider 
what risk modifiers best apply to their operations.
The BP Refinery explosion and fire in Texas (2007) was used as a case study 
to apply the risk scorers. The residual and entropic risks were readily categorised 
enabling strategies for systemic improvement to be identified. It’s important that 
organisations take lessons learned across industry sectors such as oil and gas, rather 
than confining opportunities within an industry. Residual risk reduction strate‑
gies and entropic risk prevention strategies provide opportunities for business per‑
formance and improvement in any organisation but are particularly important for 
high‑risk industries that have the greatest vulnerability to catastrophic losses.
The Risk Matrix generally results in the production of a Risk Register compris‑
ing multiple line items that describe hazards or risks that can occur in operations. It 
doesn’t provide an understanding of how the work is done. These are intended to be 
‘live’ documents but are in practice, maintained by the OSH department with reviews 
undertaken annually (quarterly at best). Instead, it was proposed that a Total Risk 
Profile could be compiled of the key activities undertaken in operations to better 
understand the interfaces between systems of production and the respective systemic 
entropic and residual risks. What processes are being undertaken? With what tech‑
nologies? In which work areas? By whom? What are the known residual and entropic 
risks within these systems of production and how is this affecting the operation’s risk 
profile? How are the residual risks being managed? How are the entropic risks being 
prevented? Are the operations suffering losses (safety, production, quality)? Does 
management have control? Have operations become complacent?
The nature of hierarchical structures is that senior managers become further and 
further away from the reality of day‑to‑day operations. They can’t get bogged down 
in the detail, but they must create an environment that delivers assurance. It’s gen‑
erally accepted that top‑down management constrains operational resilience, and the 
Alignment Fallacy took this further to suggest that it’s delusional to expect head office 
policy to materialise into operational reality when there are conflicting objectives and 
areas of non‑alignment that are ignored. Operational capacity needs to be developed 
bottom‑up concurrently. In this chapter, it was explained that senior management should 
ensure that personnel are provided with opportunities to develop risk management life 
skills by being active participants in risk assessments, risk‑based work planning and 
other experiential activities. (This topic will be discussed in detail in Chapter 9).
Chapters 3 to 6 dissected the residual and entropic risks in each of the systems of 
production. In Chapter 7, these were combined to better understand the risks at the 
interfaces within operational activities. The proposed risk assessment method went 
back to the fundamentals of effective risk management which are to achieve ‘as low 
as reasonably practicable’ tempered by a sense check on the value of adding further 
layers of administrative controls.182 Productive Safety Management
A key underlying theme has been the need to revisit the risk profile that operations 
inherit from the planning, construction, and commissioning phases of a facility’s 
lifecycle. This entails risk leaders having a healthy wariness of unknown residual 
risks and a clinician’s appetite for monitoring operations for changes that could lead 
to losses. The view should be through the broad lens of systems that are interde‑
pendent and not on operational managers or supervisors or workers as if they’re a 
problem to be fixed. Rationally, people are part of the system. They aren’t the system.
In the last three chapters of this second edition, the discussions will turn to build‑
ing risk leadership at all levels of the organisation. Current enterprises intending 
to survive long‑term amidst the dynamics of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will 
focus on their capacity to manage risks and exploit opportunities. Traditional ways 
of managing in disciplinary silos create overlaps, waste, conflict and sub‑optimal 
organisational performance.
An aim of PSM2 is to contribute to better operational management. It’s critical 
that risks and opportunities are better understood but it’s the mindset change from 
discipline‑based (production, OSH or quality) to risk‑based thinking that will make 
the difference. For this reason, the rest of this books talks about risk and opportunity 
leadership and management.
The final chapter will invite risk and opportunity owners to think strategically with 
the understanding that every action matters. Newton’s third law, “For every action, 
there is an equal and opposite reaction” may apply to forces between interacting 
objects, but it doesn’t apply to human interactions, unless a mindset of conflict is held 
by individuals, groups or the organisation. Some get entrenched in this malaise which 
degrades the culture with time. It takes a strong and visionary leader (preferably, 
leadership team) to ‘turn the ship around’. The discussions in the next chapter will 
set the scene by revisiting the Entropy Model as it applies to Organisational Capacity.

THE ENTROPY MODEL AND ORGANISATIONAL FACTOR RISKS
After the ASSP Conference in 2020, Grieve and Van der Stap, had an article pub‑
lished in the American Society of Safety Professionals Journal entitled, “Safety and 
Entropy: A Leadership Issue”. The need for this thought leadership piece arose out of 
the operational experience of the authors having seen well‑performing organisations 
and teams decline because of negatively impacting external and internal influences. 
The article asserted that there are four organisational factors critical to sustaining 
capacity and these have residual and entropic risks.
Before exploring this version of the Entropy Model, it’s important to understand 
‘capacity’ and why it’s important. There are numerous definitions and the one that 
resonates strongly and applies to all disciplines is
that emergent combination of attributes that enables a human system to create 
 developmental value.
(Morgan, 2006 and van Popering‑Verkerk et al., 2022)
There are five central concepts of capacity:
1. empowerment and identity, properties that allow an organization or system 
to survive, to grow, diversify and become more complex. To evolve in such a 
way, systems need power, control and space…. people acting together to take 
control over their own lives in some fashion
2. collective ability, i.e. that combination of attributes that enables a system 
to perform, deliver value, establish relationships and to renew itself. Or put 
another way, the abilities that allow systems… to be able to do something 
with some sort of intention and with some sort of effectiveness and at some 
sort of scale over time.
3. an emergent property or an interaction effect. It comes out of the dynam‑
ics involving a complex combination of attitudes, resources, strategies and 
skills, both tangible and intangible… And it usually deals with complex 
human activities which cannot be addressed from an exclusively technical 
perspective.
4. a potential state… It is about latent as opposed to kinetic energy. Performance, 
in contrast, is about execution and implementation or the result of the applica‑
tion/use of capacity. Given this latent quality, capacity is dependent to a large 
degree on intangibles… This potential state may require the use of different 
approaches to its development, management, assessment and monitoring.
5. creation of public value.
(Morgan, 2006)
184 DOI: 10.1201/9781032701561-9Risk Leadership 185
These concepts will be embedded in the discussions throughout Chapters 8–10. 
Broadly, it’s proposed that enterprises that are effective at managing risk and exploit‑
ing opportunities have the following characteristics:
• Mature (in terms of delivery) leadership at all hierarchical levels as appro‑
priate to:
• current situational conditions (efficacy);
• foreseeable potential conditions (readiness); and
• new and possibly unforeseen conditions (adaptability);
• Well‑developed competencies that lead to sound performance across 
 multiple business functions;
• Applied, right‑sized management systems managed through a multidisci‑
plinary approach with operational risks owned by the relevant risk owner/s; 
and
• Resourcefulness/resilience enabling risk‑based problem‑solving and 
effective decision‑making.
The model in Figure 8.1 starts on the left‑hand side with the four organisational fac‑
tors that are critical for success. These are leadership, competencies, management 
systems and resourcefulness/ resilience. In a perfect world these would be in an ideal 
state with the level of risk being zero. This unrealistic paradigm is characterised by 
safety, production output and quality at high performance levels.

FIGURE 8.1 The fifth section of the Entropy Model but adapted for organisational factors 
and capacity186 Productive Safety Management
In the next section, the residual risk is shown. None of these organisational fac‑
tors will ever reach perfection as human fallibility has an over‑riding influence on 
all of them. As was the case with the original Systems Approach Entropy Model, 
this residual risk needs to be managed and again, avoidance of complacency is criti‑
cal. The figure also shows that these factors can degrade which requires a correc‑
tive action response. Any trends alert the organisation to the need for maintenance 
regimes to ensure that factors are upgraded to achieve optimal safety, production 
output and quality. With complacency, these factors can degrade again causing a 
return to rising entropic risk and potential losses.
Throughout the discussions in previous chapters, the importance of managing 
residual risks and preventing entropic risks of systems of production has been the pri‑
mary focus. The approach has centred on ‘hard’ tangible elements of the organisation 
(including objectively treating HR as an input). These hard inputs can be likened to 
the enterprise being a wall of bricks, however, without the mortar, there’s danger of 
collapse. The bricks must be held together by factors that build capacity. Where they 
become deficient, serious issues can arise as identified in the various case studies 
reviewed earlier. The root causes of many disasters stemmed particularly from poor 
leadership and unhealthy cultures.
The literature contains extensive research on the importance of leadership, the 
benefits of strength and depth, and the consequences of poor delivery. There can 
be numerous causes of degradation overall such as downsizing or turnover result‑
ing in loss of local knowledge, influential relationships, subject matter expertise and 
critical communication pathways. Personnel can drift to under‑performance because 
of increasing core business pressures beyond their capability to deliver outcomes. 
External (non‑work‑related) personal issues can also be a cause or contributor to this 
degradation. It’s not surprising that psychosociological safety, health and wellbeing 
of workers is now included in OSH legislation.
The Strategic Alignment Channel identified external factors that can significantly 
impact an organisation. Economic conditions that drive cost cutting including work‑
force redundancies can result in loss of capacity to do the work to the required stan‑
dards of efficiency, HSE performance and quality output. This may in turn cause 
degradation to systems of production such as equipment reliability, workplace con‑
ditions and lost investment in HR training and development. The consequences are 
associated with sub‑standard maintenance of systems of production. ‘Hard’ and 
‘soft’ elements are therefore interdependent.
This loss of human capital may limit the organisation’s ability to adapt to change 
and external pressures. For instance, during COVID‑19, many companies faced sig‑
nificant risks because of the inability to maintain personnel levels. Those businesses 
that had little or no flexibility regarding production timeframes such as agriculture 
(e.g. harvesting of crops or supply of meat to market) were focused on survival 
day‑to‑day, week‑to‑week etc., not on building resilience. The duration of COVID‑19 
was a lost opportunity in terms of business improvement for many organisations. It’s 
important for managers to understand where an organisation is in terms of survival 
versus capacity development and why this is the case.
Capacity can also be eroded when management systems are not maintained to 
capture the work being done. This degradation can expose the enterprise and its Risk Leadership 187
officers to OSH legislative risks. Degraded management systems may be ongoing 
until resources become available for an overhaul (corrective action phase) and imple‑
mentation through socialisation of the system (maintenance phase). In the meantime, 
the gap between work‑as‑imagined (as described by the redundant management sys‑
tem) and work‑as‑done (how work is being done presently) may have increased, leav‑
ing the enterprise vulnerable to systems ‘dementia’.
Degradation of management systems leads to rising entropic risk 
(characterised by disorder and chaos) culminating in ‘Systems Dementia’. 
The organisation’s memory, cognitive skills, and social structures can fade 
beyond recognition. There’s an additional organisational risk if leaders 
accept this degradation because, in the short‑term, the system continues to 
provide acceptable performance.
Where the management system is no longer the source of ‘truth’, personnel may do 
workarounds or take shortcuts to ensure production continues; after all, a manage‑
ment system is only a repository of organisation knowledge within a given period if 
it’s not maintained.
Figure 8.1 can be used to explain the processes for preventing loss of organisa‑
tional capacity. These follow the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy:
1. Take corrective action to address areas of degradation (and rising entropic 
risk);
2. Use data to identify trends and implement maintenance practices to prevent 
degradation;
3. Manage residual risks that are due to human fallibility embedded in organ‑
isational systems;
4. Reduce residual risk in the longer‑term through capital investment includ‑
ing technological solutions.
It’s worth revisiting the five central concepts of capacity to see how these fit with 
these organisational factors. The following are proposed as triggers for strategy 
development:
1. Empowerment and identity can only be enabled through effective leader‑
ship so invest in risk leadership skills;
2. Collective ability is the equivalent of the total competency profile and the 
quality of those competencies within an organisation so invest in bottom‑up, 
participative strategies;
3. The emergent property is synonymous with resourcefulness/resilience and 
essential for adaptability to change so identify and develop internal exper‑
tise to mitigate risks;
4. Tangible ‘hard’ system factors and intangible ‘soft’ factors need to be devel‑
oped, managed, assessed, and monitored which require a management sys‑
tem that is sufficiently robust but flexible to enable both to be aligned; and188 Productive Safety Management
5. The creation of public value is supported by preventing losses and con‑
sidering stakeholder needs so know who these stakeholders are and their 
expectations.
The key strategy development areas are therefore: leadership development pro‑
grammes; competency profiling and development; robust management of change 
programmes; mature management systems with hard and soft factors; and stake‑
holder needs analysis.
Not all organisations will have the resources to deliver these strategies, however, 
if senior management begin with awareness of the risks, that’s a good start. Likewise, 
some businesses struggle to achieve a low baseline level of residual risk as this risk 
may be determined by labour market variables such as availability of needed man‑
agerial, supervisory, skilled and semi‑skilled personnel. A tight market with high 
demand for skilled workers will tend to constrain businesses that can’t meet remu‑
neration expectations. As a result, such enterprises tend to have higher HR residual 
risk because of their inability to attract and retain high value human capital.
The level of residual risk is fixed in the short‑term due to time and resource limi‑
tations to develop, implement and embed capabilities. For instance, the agriculture 
sector in some countries relies on tourists with working visas to support harvesting. 
Many of these personnel don’t have experience and should be supervised closely to 
manage the risk. There’s also no incentive to invest in risk management skills of this 
labour force because of the short‑term, itinerant nature of the work.
Companies that struggle to compete for leadership skills and workforce compe‑
tencies need to better understand their capacity constraints and develop strategies 
for short‑term management and longer‑term improvement. Similar risk profiling can 
occur, however, in larger companies depending on the phase of the facility’s life‑
cycle. As discussed earlier, construction often requires a sizable workforce for lim‑
ited time. There is little opportunity or financial incentive to instil risk management 
competencies, influential leadership and values related to safe, efficient, quality work 
with short‑term workers. Organisational capacity is often limited to essential trade 
and labour skills at the work‑front level. The residual risk can therefore be high com‑
pared to steady state, established operations. Low investment in capacity building 
can be readily justified. Management of the gaps associated with this type of work 
often comes down to highly visible, on‑the‑ground supervision driven by mandatory 
rules and compliance.
Command and control management, whilst not in vogue, isn’t wrong.
It depends on the risk profile of the work and the capacity of the workforce 
to manage the risks. More conscious effort is needed to understand and 
manage capacity constraints and HR risks.
The model in Figure 8.1 shows that the four organisational factors can degrade with 
time. This may occur singularly, in combination or collectively. A singular example 
could involve the loss of a positive and influential leader from an operational site. 
A collective consequence may ensue if there’s subsequent attrition of that leader’s Risk Leadership 189
followers. Such a situation may particularly weaken the culture if new incumbents 
feel pressure to prove their worth by pushing short‑term production targets to the 
detriment of the quality of systems of production. The gap may be the lag time to 
assimilate these new recruits from a psychological contract perspective.
An ongoing decline may result from continued loss of these internal competen‑
cies, with recovery requiring a long time. Integrating new personnel into an organ‑
isation doesn’t happen in days or weeks. Time isn’t just required in terms of job 
skills but also socialisation into how and why the organisation operates as it does. 
Why does the enterprise have a ‘risk‑ and opportunity‑based culture’ as opposed 
to ‘Safety First’? Why is everyone asked to contribute by taking timely corrective 
action and suggestions for maintenance practices? Capacity is built with time – with 
investment in people. When leaders leave, capacity departs with them. Those with a 
strong, positive influence can create a significant gap and yet, many organisations fail 
to do more than just an exit interview with the departee. A risk‑based perspective is 
seldom taken because it falls into the ‘undiscussables’ where organisational silence 
is preferred over truth.
Serious degradation of these non‑physical factors can lead to significant incidents 
or losses by affecting the quality of risk‑based, decision‑making, as was seen in the 
Challenger and Columbia disasters. In industry, management’s tolerance of risk may 
shift towards higher acceptance as spending cuts impact maintenance budgets and 
flow onto reduction in plant and equipment reliability, infrastructure/ workplace con‑
ditions, the process controls ordinarily in place, and the ability of workers to deliver 
to required standards. Fewer workers may be expected to generate the same produc‑
tion resulting in longer hours and higher productivity expectations per person. As 
the entropic risk rises, the likelihood of losses increases. If safety incidents or other 
losses become evident, management should be seriously concerned. This should be a 
trigger to ensure operations are being controlled, otherwise, there’s a risk not only of 
internal wastes and inefficiencies but also of events that cause reputational damage 
and/or loss of critical external relationships (clients, customers, community, govern‑
ment etc.) to the extent that the organisation may no longer be considered a reliable 
supplier or contract partner.
These matters related to management of capacity tend to be overlooked by organ‑
isational leaders and are outside the scope of most current business risk assessment 
practices. Operationally, the only influencing factors may be recent changes in OSH 
legislation in some jurisdictions resulting in a growing focus on psychosocial haz‑
ards and risk management. This will contribute to greater concern for individuals 
(whether in management or on the shop floor) in relation to mental health and wellbe‑
ing. However, whether this translates into a more concerted effort from a broader risk 
perspective is uncertain. For instance, the decline in leadership capability of a senior 
manager due to professional and/or personal factors should trigger early intervention 
as both an OSH duty to that person and ahead of any subsequent psychosocial risk to 
that person’s peers and subordinates.
An important message to be drawn from Figure  8.1 is that like the System 
Approach Entropy Model, the enterprise, having achieved ‘optimal safety, produc‑
tion output and quality’ may suffer degradation of capacity again and therefore, the 
cycle might be repeated. Other issues or minor losses may be evident including HR 190 Productive Safety Management
problems, poor governance, attrition of key personnel or other events that may pre‑
dispose the organisation to decline. Behind these concerns is the need for better 
management and leadership.
Some of the major industrial disasters that have occurred over the last 
50 years indicate that the companies involved hadn’t recognised their 
exposure to organisational factor entropic risk.
For instance, at BP’s Texas City Refinery which exploded in 2005, the United States 
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board explained that production pres‑
sures and cost‑cutting programmes were a root cause of the accident. Management 
had relied on injury data as evidence of safety performance and weren’t aware of the 
poor safety culture at the plant (Isiadinso, 2015).
In 2014, DuPont had a chemical release that killed four workers. The chairper‑
son of the Investigation Board indicated, “What we are seeing here in this incident 
in LaPorte is definitely a problem of safety culture in the corporation of DuPont” 
(Hosier, 2015). In both cases, the Entropy Model may have prompted an investiga‑
tion into degraded states within systems of production and importantly, organisa‑
tional factors. What can happen in the enterprise is that ‘safety’ can be too easily 
pigeon‑holed into a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) and a silo rather than 
being fully integrated into management systems, practices and supported by a robust, 
risk‑ and opportunity‑based organisational culture.
In these and other cases, senior managers weren’t aware of the degraded state of 
the business’ systems or organisational capacity until after the catastrophe occurred. 
Well ahead of such disasters, the enterprise may have been suffering losses in pro‑
duction/productivity/schedule, quality deficiencies and/or safety incidents (perhaps 
unreported) from degradation. Real risks at the operational level need to be recog‑
nised and articulated to create a sense of urgency about vulnerability to failure. This 
requires that leaders make a step‑change from safety‑ to risk‑based thinking within 
the company and more broadly at the interface with its key stakeholders, such as 
contractors and suppliers. It should be remembered that ‘safety‑thinking’ tends to be 
marginalised in managers’ and supervisors’ decision‑making processes when core 
business objectives – production targets, construction schedules, customer satisfac‑
tion, patience care, revenue targets etc. – are slipping.
‘Safety thinking’ is not sustainable when an organisation comes under 
pressure. A shift is needed to ‘risk‑ and opportunity‑based’ thinking and 
development of capacity.
SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP FOR OPERATIONS
In the earlier discussion, it was stated that strict operational control management 
practices may be suitable for short‑timeframe projects such as agriculture and con‑
struction. This clearly calls for a different leadership style to that required for opera‑
tions which benefit from longer‑term, capability development strategies. Construction Risk Leadership 191
projects demand problem‑solving that reverts to technical expertise, planning and 
supervision of interfaces between contractors, visible enforcement especially of fatal 
risk critical controls and a culture characterised by directive regulation in a dynamic 
environment. Command and control shouldn’t be confused with ‘dictatorship’ or 
other negative connotations.
PSM1 included an adaptation from the Tannenbaum‑Schmidt Continuum 
(Tannenbaum and Schmidt, 1973) with the addition of the risk level from high to low 
and the respective timeframe for action, ranging from urgent to not urgent. (This is 
described here without the inclusion of the figure.) High risk, urgent work demands 
an assertive leadership style where the manager makes the decision and announces 
it. This is appropriate in emergency situations and hazardous short‑term projects. 
The use of supervisory authority is critical and should be supported by the hierarchy. 
A ‘hard’ style doesn’t mean that there’s no care or concern for workers. Values that 
underpin preventative safety measures may be communicated differently, perhaps 
without ‘soft’ skills. The reality of schedule pressure often constrains collaboration 
with workers so essential risk management communication and participation tends 
to be applied through command and control. The right of workers/anyone to stop 
unsafe work must be mandated and acted upon to ensure timely corrective action 
and prevent losses, but also to convey the criticality of safety as a project deliverable.
At the other end of the continuum is the low risk, non‑urgent working environ‑
ment. The leadership style becomes increasingly collaborative with opportunities 
for consultation. For the organisation to build capacity and resilience in the longer 
term, this should occur through risk management practices, work planning and other 
activities that apply a decentralised approach to risk ownership. The appropriate 
leadership style is situational. To achieve safe production, there needs to be inherent 
resilience in an organisation’s capability adapting leadership delivery to changing 
circumstances.
In the middle ground between assertive and collaborative leadership, the manager 
or supervisor has numerous strategies when engaging with people in decision‑ making. 
According to the continuum, they may elect to ‘sell’ a decision, present a tentative 
decision subject to change, or define limits and ask the group to make the decision. 
The approach taken depends on numerous dynamics, but the primary considerations 
should be the level of risk and urgency with which decisions need to be made.
Overall, the most successful leadership style is based on situational factors. In 
high‑reliability organisations (HROs), one of the five principles of effectiveness is 
‘Deference to Expertise’. During high paced operations when there are unexpected 
problems, decision‑making migrates from management levels to the lowest levels 
where a team is formed with the specific knowledge, skills, and expertise to deal 
with the event. Hierarchical rank is subordinated to expertise and experience. The 
inference is that HROs are more concerned about managing risks and implementing 
well‑informed actions than the politics of managers always being the decision‑makers 
and being perceived as leaders. Credible leaders understand their limitations and 
confidently delegate to those with well‑developed competencies in specialised fields.
The concept of organisational capacity lends itself to a more objective approach 
to leadership. Executive and senior management teams have residual risks (includ‑
ing limits to their knowledge and skills). Collectively, these residual risks can include192 Productive Safety Management
organisational groupthink. This is the tendency of teams to select decisions based on 
consensus. Symptoms include beliefs of invulnerability; relying on rationale character‑
ised by ignoring warnings; faith in the morality of the group; stereotyping of those who 
are outside or challenge the group; self‑censorship such that individuals keep silent; 
pressure on anyone who expresses doubts; the illusion of unanimity; and mind guards 
who protect the leader and other members from adverse information (Janis, 1971).
Negative group traits that obstruct sound risk‑ and opportunity‑based decision‑
making are a residual risk. Within this phenomenon, one of the symptoms of group‑
think is stereotyping. This is commonplace as a human behaviour in society and 
the workplace. As a residual risk, this needs to be consciously managed. A typical 
operational example is the person in the group who engages in devil’s advocacy dia‑
logue, often pointing out the flaws of a decision or how work is done. It’s a mistake 
to stop listening to these personality types because they break with consensus and 
may identify genuine flaws others don’t see or fear speaking up about. The dangers 
of groupthink are evident in many disasters. Blind optimism and miscommunica‑
tion within the organisation led to NASA’s desire to complete the mission despite 
ill‑translated information and concerns about O‑rings (Center for the Advancement 
of Digital Scholarship, 2024). Seven people died as a result.
From a humanistic perspective, it’s unhealthy to stereotype managers and super‑
visors according to their perceived leadership style, for instance, the ‘Hard Nut 
Production Manager’ or the ‘Wimpy Operations Safety Manager’, because the under‑
lying beliefs and values that make up an individual’s psychology aren’t visible to oth‑
ers. This was illustrated by Sigmund Freud’s Iceberg Theory showing the conscious 
and unconscious mind (Freud, 1915; Mcleod, 2024). Behaviours are visible above the 
waterline, but beliefs and values are below the waterline and not observable. The ‘Hard 
Nut’ may well have strong people‑centred values and be an OSH Champion, balanced 
with a pragmatic approach to risk acceptability. The ‘Wimp’ may be a quietly spoken 
strategist who takes a longer‑term view on building capability through consultation.
It’s worth noting that sub‑conscious stereotyping can act against introverts com‑
pared to extraverts. In operations, this becomes problematic when popularity is con‑
fused with effectiveness. According to Lieg and Furtner (2023):
Extraversion and its facets of assertiveness and sociability were identified as stable pre‑
dictors for leader emergence and effectiveness. However, recent research suggested that 
extraversion may lie in the eyes of the beholder; it might not be the leader’s possession 
but their followers’ attribution of the trait that shapes these criteria of leader success.
(Lieg and Furtner, 2023)
The following comments were made about introverted leaders:
our study shows that while the more effective leadership styles indicated by the full range 
leadership model (Bass, 1985) might be more suitable for extraverted individuals to 
engage in, effectiveness should not be equated with extraversion. At least one of the effec‑
tive transformational leadership styles, intellectual stimulation, was perceived as more 
characteristic for an introverted personality. This finding is in line with recent literature 
on the positive influence of introverted leaders on proactive teams…. (Grant et al., 2011).
(Lieg and Furtner, 2023)Risk Leadership 193
There is a key takeaway from this and other studies from a practical perspective.
Individuals shouldn’t pigeonhole themselves into being a certain 
type of leader or blindly follow a leadership mantra.
They should be the best possible version of themselves and develop a deep 
understanding to manage their own risks and opportunities 
as a leader.
Leaders tend to have strong skills in self‑awareness such as recognising their own risks 
and opportunities. The factors to consider from an individual perspective include: 
What are my physical residual risks (limitations)? What are my psychosociological 
residual risks (negative tendencies, vulnerabilities)? These are characteristics that 
are difficult to change in the short‑term so the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy 
would suggest managing these residual risks then investing longer‑term in personal 
development. Leadership can also degrade. An important part of self‑management is 
to build self‑awareness so that warning signs are recognised, and feedback is listened 
to so corrective action is taken. This may entail getting help and implementing some 
form of maintenance programme, for instance, having a mentor or coach following 
a planned programme. Organisations seldom if ever consider leadership capability 
from a risk management perspective along with groupthink that would reinforce that 
all is well at the senior levels of the enterprise.
PRACTICAL RISK LEADERSHIP AND DECISION‑MAKING
An organisation’s senior management must be committed to building risk leader‑
ship capacity starting with their own competencies. The same key themes have 
emerged in industry from numerous historic disasters. Strong management commit‑
ment and leadership have been repeatedly shown to be critical to the prevention of 
catastrophic losses and business blunders, as well as pre‑determinants of successful 
organisations.
Gigerenzer (2015) wrote extensively about risk management competencies. The 
analysis started with questioning if people are stupid, and it was suggested that society 
is largely risk illiterate. It was observed that the underlying obstacles to skill develop‑
ment include the way information is presented, for instance, statistically without con‑
text. Emotion also distorts interpretation so that circumstances such as COVID‑19 
that elicit a collective anxiety response, gain more attention than day‑to‑day facts 
such as road statistics, which are significantly worse. There’s a need in industry (and 
society more broadly) to improve risk literacy as a life skill.
There are three ways to improve learning which can be derived from Gigerenzer’s 
work:
1. Present information in a digestible form to deal with risk and uncertainty 
(with the inference being to tailor this information so that it’s audience 
specific);194 Productive Safety Management
2. Experts are part of the problem because they make the same mistakes as 
members of the general public (with the inference being don’t rely solely on 
‘experts’);
3. Complex problems don’t require complex solutions (with the inference 
being that simplicity is good).
What tends to happen is that an illusion of certainty arises. The following quote 
speak volumes:
Trying to apply standard risk tools to uncertainty … can do tremendous damage, yet 
some experts act like problems of uncertainty are problems of risk so that they can use 
their standard mathematical tools rather than facing the real world.
(Gigerenzer, 2015)
Risk leadership starts with understanding the operational reality 
of the organisation.
A different approach to running operational risk assessment sessions will be dis‑
cussed later. For the moment, the discussion centres on building this operational 
understanding. What tends to happen in business is that senior managers find it dif‑
ficult to schedule time in the field because there are constant demands. An organ‑
isation that is serious about building a risk‑ and opportunity culture underpinned 
by strong leadership will ensure that time in operations is a mandatory KPI for 
high‑level decision‑makers; however, this is often poorly executed.
From a site perspective, the worst way to go about this is for a contingent of 
senior managers in new site uniforms and shiny steel‑capped boots to arrive in the 
workplace like a VIP visit. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, operations will 
prepare and ensure that everything looks good.
During the site visit, the senior management (VIP) party will receive 
information that is visually and verbally filtered compared to day‑to‑day 
operations, leaving them with a sanitised perception 
of the core business environment.
Secondly, operational personnel will likely perceive a distinct ‘them and us’. They 
may feel like the visiting party is motivated by assurance rather than wanting to 
understand their operational reality. Thirdly, the party will likely bring their group‑
think with them. The danger is that the field trip can result in a ‘feel good’ visit 
for senior management that operations endure until they can get back to day‑to‑day 
business. The better approach is for individuals or pairs to arrive with minimal prior 
notification and with an open demeanour, visiting key areas of the site but also show‑
ing interest in the work of contractors and special projects.
There’s compelling research over many years, demonstrating that senior leader‑
ship is the key to high OSH performance. Companies with the lowest lost‑time injury 
rates are those with the highest level of management commitment and employee 
involvement (Most, 1999). These high‑performing enterprises have several traits. Risk Leadership 195
Firstly, OSH efforts are equal to other organisational concerns and are fully inte‑
grated. Secondly, their cultural characteristics include specific management behav‑
iours which improve safety and performance such as treating employees with respect, 
providing positive feedback, and encouraging suggestions (Erickson, 1994). Whilst 
the above speaks about OSH, the same traits apply to leadership of production per‑
formance, quality management and other functional areas of an enterprise. In this 
regard, it’s difficult to fathom the concept of leadership being discipline specific, for 
instance, ‘safety leadership’.
If an organisation is chronically immature in risk management and workers are 
being injured, then a specific safety strategy may be required to counterbalance 
production‑centricity. Under these conditions, advocacy of ‘safety leadership’ may 
work to correct a downward and dangerous organisational path. In businesses that 
have embedded inroads into OSH compliance, discipline‑specific branding may be 
counter‑productive creating silos, wasteful overlaps between functions (safety, envi‑
ronment, quality) and obstacles to improvement.
There’s no such thing as ‘Safety Leadership’. There’s only ‘Leadership’.
One of the core competencies is the ability to make informed risk and 
opportunity decisions as a leader.
In PSM1, six broad competencies were identified based on the work of Most (1999). 
These still hold true for contemporary leadership underpinned by risk and opportu‑
nity driven capabilities:
Competency 1: The ability to think in terms of systems and knowing how to lead 
systems.
Competency 2: The ability to understand variability of work in planning and prob‑
lem solving.
Competency 3: Understanding how we learn, develop and improve, leading to true 
learning and improvement.
Competency 4: Understanding people and why they behave as they do.
Competency 5: Understanding the interaction and interdependence between sys‑
tems, variability, learning and human behavior; knowing how each affect each other.
Competency 6: Giving vision, meaning, direction and focus to the organization.
(Most, 1999)
The ability to think in terms of systems is fundamental to effective risk and 
opportunity management and this entails understanding how the work is done. In 
steady‑state operations or long‑term projects, a leader’s role is to champion continual 
improvement drawing on the depth and breadth of competencies of the workforce. 
They must have the capacity to enable individuals and teams to achieve their higher 
potential. Transformational leadership, whilst it has been written about for decades 
(Bass et al., 1996), has renewed interest as a means of achieving capacity over the 
longer‑term.
Helmold (2021) discusses ‘Transformation Leadership in New Work’ as a chap‑
ter in New Work, Transformational and Virtual Leadership. Management for196 Productive Safety Management
Professionals and presents a triangle of what management can’t demand. This 
includes passion, creativity and self‑initiative (illustrated in the article at the top of 
the triangle). They can, however, elicit intellect, hard work and obedience (illustrated 
in the reference at the bottom of the triangle). New Work is characterised by both 
job enrichment and job empowerment. The former involves raising personnel sat‑
isfaction by providing more tasks which deliver increased responsibility, autonomy 
and decision‑making thereby improving the quality of the job. Job empowerment 
describes strategies for increased autonomy and self‑determination so personnel can 
represent their interests independently (Helmold, 2021).
Transformational leadership requires managers and supervisors to loosen 
their grip on control without relinquishing it. Their role is to provide a 
guiding hand and empower their subordinates.
The words above are easily stated by the executive, but managers and supervisors 
need more than words. They need assurance. In the backs of their mind, they’ll con‑
tinue to believe that if something goes wrong, they’ll be held accountability. Often 
the organisation’s history will have examples of managers and supervisors being 
blamed for losses. These bad experiences tend to remain deeply entrenched in the 
minds of those still within the enterprise (the survivors) which encourages face‑value 
commitment to change initiatives rather than heartfelt resolution.
The organisation therefore needs a clearly articulated and consistent method of 
influencing strategic and day‑to‑day operational decision‑making processes and out‑
comes. In PSM1, the ‘Reasonableness Test’ was developed to illustrate the process 
underpinned by the organisation’s values and a “Values Statement”. Over the last 20 
years (since PSM1 was published), many mature, modern enterprises have developed 
and embedded their core business values. It’s a mistake to assume that these values 
(like the policy of ‘Safety First’) will consistently translate into operational leader‑
ship behaviours in the presence of production‑driven performance pressures.
Instead of simply relying on values such as safety and respect, everyone in the 
organisation must come to understand the organisation’s Risk Ethos – the overarch‑
ing principle by which decisions are made. This is particularly necessary for leaders 
to be confident that they will receive the consistent and fair support of senior man‑
agement. Any negative legacy issues must be left in the past. An example of a Risk 
Ethos could be:
We, [insert organisation name], manage risk to achieve safety, production, 
and quality concurrently. Every decision we make is for safe production 
and a quality job. This is our Risk Ethos. This is how we work.
The purpose of the Reasonableness Test is to implement the Risk Ethos for informed 
risk‑ and opportunity‑based decisions. A key principle of this approach is that deci‑
sions made using this process stand up to the scrutiny of the management levels 
above the decision‑maker. They too must commit to and work to the Risk Ethos. This 
should be widely communicated and practiced in the organisation. The touchpoints Risk Leadership 197
that can influence the written culture of the enterprise should be identified, for 
instance, job descriptions and performance appraisals, so that the Risk Ethos is inte‑
grated into these. Verbal communication processes should also be an opportunity to 
articulate and apply the process, which is described in Figures 8.2 and 8.3. These are 
for strategic and operational decisions, respectively.
Figure 8.2 illustrates the ‘Reasonableness Test’ and ‘Internal Strategic Alignment’ 
to achieve risk‑based decisions that lead to the appropriate level of physical, finan‑
cial, and human capital. On the top‑left, the external environment is identified as 
an input to the decision‑making process. Here changes may occur to governing and 
influencing forces that require the attention of the organisation, such as legislative 
amendments or changes in client demands. The internal environment also needs to 
be considered. Key factors include information about relevant systems of produc‑
tion and organisational capacity. For example, does the enterprise have the inter‑
nal capability to deliver a new product line or to meet new statutory obligations for 
environmental emissions? Information about losses and risk metrics may provide 
an indication of vulnerabilities that could inhibit any organisational changes. These 
will inform management of existing residual risks and degraded states. New legisla‑
tion may provide the trigger for replacement or significant modifications to existing 
infrastructure or equipment.
The collated external and internal information should undergo quantitative 
and qualitative analysis. From an OSH perspective, this aligns to the concept of

‘reasonably practicable’ in terms of compliance; however, nothing in legislation states 
that production, quality and stakeholder needs can’t be included in the cost‑benefit 
analysis.
The figure shows that strategic resourcing decisions are an output of the information 
and risk analysis. There is a final test for preferred decision choices, and this involves 
assessing the fit with the Risk Ethos. Decisions that pass this test are aligned with the 
desired organisational culture. These decisions can be implemented, resulting in an 
action loop back to the internal environment where the required changes are made.
In the case studies described earlier, one of the most concerning phenomena at 
the highest levels of the organisations involved was the gradual degradation of the 
culture because of sub‑standard decision‑making processes. In the BP Refinery case, 
numerous corporate decisions were made that directly affected the operation’s capac‑
ity to manage risk. These included failing to provide additional staffing during times 
of unit startup and shutdown.
If staffing could be reduced 31 percent, reaching the ‘Best class Solomon manpower 
index’, the company would save $42 to $61 million. Such changes would result in staff‑
ing for normal operations only, where each operations crew is staffed at a ‘lean’ level, 
ie no additional personnel on hand to guard against ‘peaks’ such as safe‑offs, absences 
and so on.

Would a decision such as this pass a Risk Ethos? Another root cause of the disas‑
ter was budget and staff reductions that impaired the delivery of training. At the 
time, BP used external consultant data to establish its own performance metrics even 
though such consultants didn’t benchmark any specific process safety‑related metrics 
(p. 154, US CSHIB, 2007). The inference with this hindsight is that a Risk Ethos 
may assist organisations to sense‑check the decisions about the types of performance 
evaluation they implement. Are they using the right metrics?
This approach may conflict with other existing management strategies currently 
being implemented in industry. For instance, it’s worth noting that the primary objec‑
tive of the ‘lean’ management philosophy is to create value for the end‑user stake‑
holder. This is done through optimisation of resources including the elimination of 
wasted time, effort, or money (Helmond, 2021) What a risk‑based approach will do is 
likely provide more conscientious consideration of the impact of decisions over time. 
‘Lean’ could have its deficiencies because there’s a difference between rationalisa‑
tion to improve efficiencies for the foreseeable future and cutting too deeply into 
the organisation’s capacity. Severe cutbacks can limit the business’ ability to adapt 
to and absorb the impact of external threats or to rebound from significant opera‑
tional losses, such as a multiple workplace fatalities event. Unfortunately, these are 
too often the findings of major incident investigations. Cost‑cutting carries risks and 
these should be understood by decision‑makers with a view to not just the present, 
but also the horizon.
Figure 8.3 illustrates the ‘Reasonableness Test’ applied to operational risk‑ and 
opportunity‑based decisions. At the site level, the internal environment is considered 
in terms of available systems of production and team capacity. The information is 
collated and analysed to identify known residual and entropic risks. In this part of the 
process, trade‑offs and challenges become part of the discussion.
A factor that should be but is seldom considered in operational decisions, 
is ‘Efficiency – Thoroughness Consequence Analysis’. If we do it faster, 
what are the consequences? If we do it more thoroughly, what are the 
consequences?
A mine production manager’s advice to the maintenance manager that they need 
greater truck availability for production can be a ‘loaded’ comment. Does this 
mean, do whatever needs to be done (the minimum) to get availability today? Does 
it mean, ensure that the repairs and maintenance are done to a quality standard that 
will improve availability over coming months? There are likely different outcomes 
depending on how the maintenance manager interprets the priority and expectations, 
which will in turn affect the entropic risk level and potential for losses. Figure 8.3 
shows that either way, operational decisions will determine the physical, financial, 
and human capital required to undertake the work.
Using the Reasonableness Test, each decision is assessed again the Risk Ethos. 
Would senior management want trucks available for today’s production or, alter‑
natively, equipment reliability to increase the likelihood of continuity of produc‑
tion, without failures and without consequences such as injuries or damages? In the 200 Productive Safety Management
‘organised chaos’ of day‑to‑day operations, it can be difficult for the operational 
managers and supervisors to make ‘reasonable’ decisions; however, most carry a 
sense of accountability for their work. Most would appreciate assurance that if they 
make these choices based on a standard that aligns to overall company objectives, 
expectations, and the desired culture, they have the support of the boss and senior 
management.
If, after applying the Reasonableness Test, the mine production manager doesn’t 
achieve today’s production target because some trucks weren’t available due to main‑
tenance that manager has a justifiable explanation. Their objective was to manage 
the risk and pursue continuity of safe production (not simply today’s production). If 
equipment availability is an ongoing issue, then this needs to be escalated to the stra‑
tegic level of the company to consider options, such as resourcing of the maintenance 
department, supplies of spares, a revised preventative maintenance strategy etc.
A further reason for the Reasonableness Test is to address the issue of non‑align‑
ment. In Chapter 2, the Alignment Fallacy was explained. Numerous issues were 
identified that erode messaging from senior management as it cascades to the 
operational level. The executive may well support the Risk Ethos but without the 
tool to implement this as a consistently applied principle, operation’s leaders may 
flounder with the tension of conflicting objectives. Senior management are saying 
they want ‘X’ but do they really mean ‘Y’? People need clarity to make decisions 
confidently.
The Reasonableness Test is important because an organisation can put their man‑
agers and supervisors through extensive leadership training but, without criteria 
on which to make sound risk‑ and opportunity‑based decisions, it’s very difficult 
to transfer training into a complex, dynamic and demanding work environment. 
Supervisors deserve greater certainty and confidence when selecting actions with the 
knowledge that these actions are aligned with the system. Importantly, the workforce 
will observe the initiatives taken by the supervisor, who is more likely to earn cred‑
ibility as a leader as a result.
All too often, frontline supervisors feel trapped between ‘a rock and a hard 
place’ when it comes to making decisions about safety versus production.
Decisions, both strategic and operational, should be assessed for alignment with the 
organisation’s objectives and the desired culture. The test should also be applied to 
evaluate the appropriateness of current systems. For example, are there any practices 
that encourage shortcuts, introducing unacceptable risks such as engaging short‑term 
contractors without basic competency verification processes? In the UK, during the 
period 2018/19 to 2022/23, 33% of fatal injuries were to self‑employed workers even 
though they made up around 15% of the workforce (HSE UK, 2023) Overall, the 
fatal injury rate in this period was around three times that of the employee rate. 
Critical areas of the management system should pass the Reasonableness Test. An 
aim should be to correct areas of non‑alignment to achieve congruence in organisa‑
tional systems and the overall management ethos and direction.
The organisation’s Risk Ethos is brought to the fore when supervisors have the 
authority and support to act in a manner that balances short‑term gains and long‑term Risk Leadership 201
benefits. In some cases, this may include shutting down a production line for safety 
reasons. If the team leader must justify their decision to a sceptical manager, then 
in future, they will likely hesitate and perhaps, ignore future safety issues to keep 
production going.
In the discussions so far, a few leadership considerations have been raised. Firstly, 
leadership isn’t about personality such as introversion versus extroversion. Secondly, 
it’s not always about high levels of participation and collaboration under all circum‑
stances. Thirdly, stereotypes should be avoided because it’s not possible to see an 
individual’s internal values and beliefs. Finally, visible leadership involving VIP 
style site visits are readily prepared for to present operations at their best. The most 
appropriate style to adopt is according to situational variables. In PSM1 for high‑risk 
industries in particular, it was proposed that management demonstrate their commit‑
ment using an appropriate leadership style and decision‑making process. Figure 8.4 
(taken from PSM1) illustrates this concept.
The figure starts with management commitment and leadership cascading to 
organisational and operational resourcing decisions that create alignment; stake‑
holder needs are taken into consideration. The next layer down introduces situational 
risk variables. On the left‑hand side, there are several risk factors that trigger an 
assertive leadership style. These include significant changes in the external envi‑
ronment, which may be threats or opportunities; however, these demand that the 
organisation act quickly. Due to time pressures and/or the need for expert knowledge,

collaboration isn’t necessarily part of the process. This assertive style may also apply 
where the enterprise has an inexperienced workforce. The systems in place are likely 
focused on protection of workers rather than concurrently empowering them (how‑
ever, this doesn’t mean that care and concern is absent).
The mid‑range situational risk variables are characterised by escalating entropic 
risk and/or the identification of an unforeseen residual risk and is independent of 
workforce experience. Under these conditions, management are responsive to any 
issues raised by operations and the workforce. The organisation’s management elicit 
the input of those who are close to the risk source thereby providing themselves with 
many eyes and ears in the field. If the enterprise is an HRO, there is a chronic wari‑
ness of potential failure (as described further in Chapter 10).
The figure shows on the righthand side that in steady state operations character‑
ised by minor changes in the external environment such as incremental legislative 
amendments, a collaborative approach is best taken. The risk characteristics of this 
situation include normal conditions of entropic risk and no significant threats. Expert 
knowledge isn’t necessarily required and ideally, the workforce has sufficient experi‑
ence to contribute to continual improvement of how risks are managed and how work 
is done to achieve optimal efficiency, safety and quality outcomes. The appropriate 
leadership style is collaborative.
Regardless of how decisions are made – whether using an assertive, responsive, 
collaborative leadership style – decisions are tested using the Reasonableness Test. 
Personnel are informed of the outcomes (who what when where and how) and the 
reasons that such decisions were taken (why), especially where these have direct 
impact on their work.
Information dissemination should be used to earn and sustain personnel 
commitment to the management of risks and opportunities. This 
transparency is important in situational leadership because it promotes 
trust.
Sharing information is good management practice because if there are information 
voids, there’s the risk that these will be filled by rumour and covert dialogue. As was 
shown in Figure 8.1, organisational capacity can degrade with time and operation‑
ally, one of the factors that causes this is the failure to keep the workforce abreast 
of changes. Effective leaders understand that risk management isn’t just about main‑
taining the standards of systems of production from a socio‑technical perspective but 
also from a psychosociological perspective. The success of the enterprise depends on 
the small decisions that workers, supervisors and managers make each day, not just 
major strategic decisions.
In this regard, leadership programmes need to be adapted to build capacity for 
effective risk and opportunity management. There’s a gap in how these are delivered 
especially under the auspices of ‘Safety Leadership’.
Leadership programmes should be revisited to assess whether these deliver 
‘Leadership as Imagined’ (LAI) or ‘Leadership as Needed’ (LAN).Risk Leadership 203
OSH MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND LEGACY ISSUES
In Figure 8.1, it was identified that management systems can degrade. It’s a professional 
trap for new OSH Managers to come into their role and make commitments to compli‑
ance because, ultimately, compliance isn’t in their control even if they push for a culture 
of operational obedience. A call for compliance may be ill‑founded if the management 
system is flawed. Some organisations, even those that are accredited to ISO 45001, can 
have gaps. This can result from failing to address key issues or promising too much. 
International Standards prescribe that processes must be in place to achieve accredita‑
tion but don’t define the efficacy of those processes. The discussion about the ALARP 
assumption pointed out that mature operations can fall into a habit of prescribing fur‑
ther administrative controls after an incident even though this may add unnecessary 
complexity or cultural norms that drift towards a parent–child relationship between 
the system and workers. More and more rules are introduced. For instance, on some 
mine sites, drivers must keep their vehicle windows always closed and continue to wear 
their safety glasses (to avoid dust going in the eyes). A person who forgets this rule may 
be directed to pull over and told to correct the behaviour. Is this policing or care and 
concern? It can be difficult to differentiate in the field. Unfortunately, in the absence of 
a sound risk basis, much of the interpretation is left to the comfort level of the interper‑
sonal relationship between the messenger and the receiver.
One of the first strategies of the new incumbent OSH Manager should be to ask 
operations if the OSH management system works for them (by inference, or against 
them) and to do a gaps analysis of the system. This should include a few key areas. 
The first is the difference between work as imagined and work as done. The second 
is any deficiencies in risk assessment with the view to identifying the justification for 
various tools. Some programmes are legislated, for instance, fatigue management, so 
these fall into the category of ‘needs’. Any processes that don’t add value from a risk 
management perspective should be scrutinised deeply. These are most likely ‘wants’.
‘Wants’ can become pervasive with management’s desire to be seen to do some‑
thing. For instance, some corporations adopted behaviour‑based safety (BBS) 
observations which entail a worker undertaking a visual review of their colleague’s 
task performance. These are completed on the required form and sent to the OSH 
Department for review and entry into the system. Where the HR residual risk is 
high because of low competency levels within a high‑risk environment, these can 
be beneficial by providing feedback to inexperienced workers on matters they might 
otherwise not be aware of. In an office, however, requiring project engineers to assess 
each other at their desk or making a cup of coffee, is a low‑value, almost insulting, 
waste of time. If a programme doesn’t have a sound risk‑basis, why do it? What 
makes it worse is that this information is often input into the system to simply gener‑
ate numbers. Resources are better spent on ensuring that safety critical controls for 
fatal risks are in place and are effective. These types of programmes that fall into 
the ‘wants’ category, tend to be implemented across all business units within an 
organisation rather than selectively on a risk‑basis. The argument for this approach is 
that senior management wouldn’t expect operations to do what they’re not prepared 
to do themselves, but no one questions the value. The data goes into the system and 
for what purpose?204 Productive Safety Management
Operations carry the burden of ill‑directed rules and cumbersome processes. 
There are several thought‑leaders in the OSH profession who are questioning the 
rising power of the discipline and its legacy of bureaucracy, especially given that 
fatality and serious injury rates have flattened.
There is a clear need to get back to basics in OSH risk management and 
to address real operational issues. Procedural inefficiencies cause risk 
transfer by generating additional production pressure.
It makes the job of the operations manager or supervisor increasingly difficult, but 
the politics of safety branding make it worse by contending that leadership involves 
championing the mantra even though operationally, there may be a serious discon‑
nection between aspiration and practicality.
The solution is to differentiate ‘wants’ from ‘needs’ and right‑size the 
integrated, operational risk management system.
Once this has been achieved in consultation with the end‑users of the system, and 
rolled out to the workforce, it’s then reasonable to expect compliance to the sys‑
tem. A well‑designed system should in fact, support the right behaviours by provid‑
ing personnel with the information they need. For instance, this is a basic example. 
When doing the check on a site vehicle before taking it on a long remote journey, 
the checklist should include only the things that need to be inspected to ensure the 
vehicle is safe and reliable. If any of these issues, such as a tyre with low tread, are 
found, the checklist should prompt the worker to get this fixed before embarking. 
As a detailed example, if there won’t be any mobile reception on the journey or 
at the destination, a statement should be on the checklist advising that a satellite 
phone can be obtained from the supplies department, who will check it’s charged 
and operational. Checklists that are informative and practical are useful tools and 
difficult to argue against when designed to deliver OSH and efficiency concurrently. 
The objective of these tools should be to avoid losses – injuries, damage, equipment 
breakdowns, communication blackspots and time delays that have a flow‑on effect 
on production. OSH professionals should facilitate the discussion about needs, but 
the solutions should come from operational managers and supervisors. Let them lead 
and be seen to lead.
The key message in this section has been to ensure operations have the tools 
they need to manage risk effectively. If this hasn’t been reviewed, then it’s risky to 
assume that the management system is working and that if something goes wrong, 
it will protect the business or its officers from statutory fines or litigation. If the sys‑
tem, after the gaps analysis, is found to be deficient, then a strategic plan is required 
to close the gaps. These should be prioritised on a risk basis. Initially, the system 
may be centralised to discipline experts who work in consultation with end‑users, 
however, progressively, it should become increasingly decentralised to risk owners. 
For instance, historically, high‑risk work systems such as permit‑to‑work have been 
developed and managed by the OSH Department. The rationale for this was perhaps Risk Leadership 205
that the OSH profession was perceived to be the expert in mitigating high risk safety 
issues. A risk‑based approach entails ownership of the risk by those who are primar‑
ily affected and have the budget to manage the risk.
When a new project is planned, often the project managers will revert to tradition 
and expect the OSH Manager to be assigned this work, but this doesn’t necessarily 
make sense. For instance, for construction of a major hazard facility, the highest 
risk in the project life that necessitates a permit‑to‑work system is when operations 
undergo shutdown maintenance. It’s not until construction and commissioning have 
been completed that the plant is fully energised. The Hazardous Facility Maintenance 
Department therefore would be the primary user and should lead the design and 
implement of this critical control system, with other departments, being secondary 
users. An example of the latter is when tradespersons need to do trenching where 
there may be underground services on the site. A better risk management decision 
in the longer term of the facility may be to assign ownership of the permit‑to‑work 
system with the primary user and for the OSH Department to focus on verification of 
use and efficacy of the system (such as an audit function).
Whilst this discussion has diverted into management more than leadership, how 
the organisation implements its risk management strategy will determine the struc‑
tures and accountabilities of risk leaders. Traditional approaches to OSH manage‑
ment have divested process ownership of many elements of the management system 
(because everything has a safety component) to the OSH Departement, whether 
this makes sense or not. For instance, why, in many organisations, does the OSH 
Department design pre‑operational checklists for vehicles, plant and equipment 
when they are clearly not the users, the inspectors or the maintainers? Ownership 
of elements of the system should reside with the risk owner – the department who 
controls the resources to ensure that the system of production’s residual risk is man‑
aged, and the entropic risks are prevented. This places the OSH profession clearly 
into a service role.
The role of the site OSH function is facilitation and verification of the 
integrated operational risk management system. The accountability for risk 
mitigation processes should reside with the Risk Owners.
This means that OSH professionals should facilitate risk management processes that 
have a significant safety component, such as management of change reviews. They 
can deliver high value by being the enabler bringing various operational functions 
together where there are overlaps to achieve simplification, standardisation, and 
reduction of complexity of practices and tools commonly used by different depart‑
ments. Importantly, they should own the internal audit function involving verification 
of the efficacy of risk mitigation processes, especially those with fatal and serious 
injury or harm potential.
There are innumerable topics that could have been covered in this chapter about 
leadership. The focus has been on some of the key challenges that both the OSH 
profession and operational managers face. There are currently some serious legacy 
issues which have led to division in the OSH profession between those who advocate 206 Productive Safety Management
traditional safety (Safety I) versus those who prefer Safety II, ‘Safety Differently’ etc. 
From a practical perspective, both are needed.
Hale et al. provided definitions of the two approaches in 2012. These are useful 
because they get back to basics:
Model 1 is the classic, rationalist view of rules as constraints on the behaviour of those 
at the sharp end of operations imposed by experts situated higher in the hierarchy and 
removed from the day‑to‑day work. Following rules is seen as the best way of behaving 
in all situations that can be envisaged, while rules constitute constraints on the errors 
and mistakes of fallible operators, who are portrayed as not having the time or compe‑
tence to come up with those rules. This is an essentially top–down view of a static set 
of rules that should not be violated.
Model 2 emerges from sociological and ethnographic studies and from manage‑
ment science, and focuses on predominantly complex, high‑technology operations.... 
rules are socially constructed patterns of behaviour, deriving from experience with the 
diversity of reality. Rules are local, situated and have many exceptions and nuances. 
The experts in this paradigm are the operators, and this view is essentially bottom–up 
and dynamic. This model sees written rules as necessarily simplified abstractions of 
this complex reality, to be used as generic guidance, but adapted to each different situ‑
ation in real life.
(Hale et al., 2012)
From a practical implementation perspective, combinations are necessary to build 
leadership capability top‑down and bottom‑up. The two views aren’t as binary as 
some commentators in the OSH profession suggest. Following are some of the main 
reasons for adopting both approaches concurrently from practical experience:
• Without senior leadership commitment, achieving buy‑in at the operational 
level is problematic. If OSH is relegated by production, OSH risk manage‑
ment efforts will be eroded by operational reality and the frontline supervi‑
sor will be stuck in the tension between safety and production.
• Bottom‑up risk management enables the workforce to own operational 
deliverables for safety, production, and quality. As the organisation matures, 
the OSH management system can progressively become more integrated 
and decentralised to enable day‑to‑day development of risk leadership capa‑
bility by participating in practical, risk‑based activities.
• Bottom‑up is required to ensure that procedures and operational practices 
reflect ‘The Work’.
• Top‑down is unavoidable in large organisations that have a corporate head 
office where standards are set and that require consistent data across opera‑
tions for governance.
• The OSH management system should mature progressively to facilitate a 
multidisciplinary approach to risk management and take advantage of syn‑
ergies across functional areas such as environment, engineering, quality, 
security and human resource management.
• Risk management at both the strategic and operational levels is about loss 
prevention. This can’t be achieved by singular top‑down or bottom‑up strat‑
egies or without a feedback loop.Risk Leadership 207
• OSH information should be readily available to those who work to it, should 
be easy to read and follow, and should be improved if insufficiently pre‑
scriptive in high‑risk critical areas or overly prescriptive for low‑risk tasks.
It’s important the OSH Department have a clear understanding of their role within 
the organisation and one of the most poignant things to remember is that credibil‑
ity is earned not just given because of power or authority. Credibility is the key to 
leadership.
SUMMARY
This chapter opened by presenting the Entropy Model for Organisational Capacity 
which shows that four factors that build capacity have residual risks and can suffer 
degradation, leading to organisational losses. It was explained that deterioration of 
leadership and culture particularly were root causes in many major disasters, includ‑
ing those presented in earlier chapters.
It’s not possible to cover the depth and breadth of leadership strategies and chal‑
lenges in a single chapter so the discussions have been narrowed down to focus on 
some of the key issues that are faced in operations. There’s extensive literature avail‑
able which presents ‘safety leadership’ as a panacea for organisational woes. When 
working in operations, facing dilemmas such as efficiency versus thoroughness, 
short‑term versus longer‑term needs, and resourcing constraints, it can be difficult to 
come to terms with multiple functions each advocating their contribution as the most 
important. ‘Safety is our highest priority’. ‘Our customers won’t be happy if we don’t 
deliver on quality and without them, we don’t have a business. Quality comes first’. 
‘Everyone knows production is core business. No production, no revenue, no jobs’.
Throughout this book, there’s been a deliberate shift away from ‘safety‑based 
thinking’ to ‘risk‑based thinking’ which means a change in mindset. This reframes 
and perhaps debunks some myths about culture and leadership. Through a risk 
management lens, command and control management isn’t necessarily ‘dictator‑
ship’. It may be necessary because of the high risk, short‑term nature of a project 
in which there’s little time for Safety II or ‘Safety Differently’ (Model 2) strategies. 
That doesn’t mean that personnel are just numbers. The opportunity is to develop 
robust practices to effectively manage high risks in construction and short‑term work 
assignments and ensure that these humanistic values are heartfelt despite this tough 
and demanding environment.
In this chapter, numerous solutions were proposed to address leadership chal‑
lenges. A continuum of leadership styles was presented from assertive to collabora‑
tive based on the level of risk and the urgency of the decision‑making process. This 
lent weight to a tried and tested way of leading – situational leadership. This dates to 
the 1960s and is based on the work of Paul Hersey who proposed four styles involving 
telling, selling, participating, and delegating. Operations are dynamic environments 
and leaders need to be flexible to changing circumstances. Different styles work 
according to the circumstances and the audience. Management literature can drift 
into idealistic leadership traits and fortunately, more is being written about authen‑
ticity. In the workplace, particularly in the Western World where individualism is a 208 Productive Safety Management
dominant trait (as opposed to collectivism), leadership credibility must be earned. 
It’s not just given because of authority. Leadership programmes should be revisited 
to assess whether these deliver ‘Leadership as Imagined’ (LAI) or ‘Leadership as 
Needed’ (LAN).
Leadership programmes should involve discussions about decision‑making traps 
such as groupthink where factors come into play that push a group towards consensus 
even though this may be a sub‑optimal outcome. Stereotypes should also be avoided 
such as the ‘heartless’ Construction Manager or the vocal shopfloor ‘troublemaker’ 
who regularly challenges the status quo. Ironically, some leadership training pro‑
grammes involve assigning different roles to participants including the ‘devil’s advo‑
cate’ whose role is to raise risks, difficulties and problems. This is considered one 
of the most powerful roles compared to those who are expected to convey creative 
ideas, optimism or feelings. It’s worth considering that the vocal person may have 
the courage to speak up whilst the rest of the group, sharing the same concerns, may 
remain silent. The person may be a potential resource – a leader in waiting.
The discussions highlighted that ‘Safety Leadership’ can raise some serious chal‑
lenges operationally. The supervisor must include a section on safety in the daily 
pre‑start meeting to demonstrate ‘safety leadership’, which can come across as sepa‑
rate from the work. Some organisations require a ‘safety moment’ or ‘safety share’ 
at the beginning of each meeting and this can revert to safely crossing the road or 
wearing a seatbelt when a person is put on the spot to demonstrate their commitment 
to safety. It’s as if the supervisor is expected to put on a ‘safety hat’ which is different 
from what they ordinarily wear. The OSH profession would do well to reconsider the 
value of ‘safety leadership’ and ‘safety culture’ to better understand the impact of 
these on the role of the frontline supervisor and their operational manager, with the 
view to safety being a subset of ‘leadership’.
A key theme throughout this book has been the tension between safety and produc‑
tion, and the impact this has on decision‑making. PSM1 included the ‘Reasonableness 
Test’ which has been refined in this edition. The test involves using a Risk Ethos to 
verify the suitability of decision choices and to ensure this supports the desired organ‑
isational culture. Managers and supervisors need criteria on which to test decisions to 
ensure that short‑term pressures don’t lead to sub‑optimal decisions. These can erode 
the quality of systems of production and the organisational culture over time.
A section of this chapter was dedicated to examples of how managers and super‑
visors can adapt their leadership style to situational variables and the current risk 
profile so that decisions are delivered transparently to build trust. The best way to 
develop competencies is through practical risk assessment exercises directly related 
to the work. By engaging the team in these processes, the supervisor earns credibil‑
ity as a leader and helps to develop the KSAs of their subordinates. Unfortunately, 
current OSH management systems are paper‑driven to the extent that practical 
approaches to risk management are often stifled. OSH professionals should explore 
ways to enable a pragmatic approach to risk assessment in the environment using 
the language of operations, then taking the information to plug it into the report‑
ing systems that senior management require to understand the organisation’s risk 
profile. Each operational risk assessment activity should be seen as an opportunity 
to delivery three outcomes. The first is the required output as defined by the system Risk Leadership 209
(e.g. the risk assessment), the second is the consultative learning experience for par‑
ticipants (building competencies), and the third is the opportunity for supervisors to 
lead (building capacity).
Finally, a challenge was put forward to OSH Managers to scrutinise the management 
system to differentiate ‘needs’ and ‘wants’ with the view to ‘right‑sizing’ the system. 
A cautionary approach was suggested because it’s a mistake to drive for compliance 
to the system if the system has gaps, has areas of non‑alignment or isn’t user‑friendly. 
Honest discussions need to be held with operations to uncover whether the system is a 
help or a hindrance. Well‑designed, practical tools such as checklists guide the desired 
behaviours. Poorly designed written tools create frustration and covert pushback.
An invitation was issued to leaders of the OSH profession to improve the delivery 
of the OSH function. It was proposed that the profession should focus on facilitation 
and verification of the integrated operational risk management system. Historically, 
too many aspects of the management system have been assigned to the OSH disci‑
pline simply because it’s perceived that safety has touchpoints across so many organ‑
isational areas. In this regard, the profession has sometimes created a rod for its 
own back by accepting work that shouldn’t have been theirs to own. Plant safety and 
operational risk assessments are an example.
In many organisations, there’s lack of clarity on the role of the OSH function com‑
pared with risk owners. Basically, the OSH Department should be a service function 
to core business. Accountability for risk management resides with the relevant risk 
owner (e.g. plant reliability is a maintenance department accountability). To avoid 
confusion and potential conflict, OSH shouldn’t be undertaking operation’s work 
(such as conducting the pre‑start inspections on vehicles) or divesting their work, for 
instance, advising business unit managers to write their own safety management plan 
for a new scope of work or project. Unfortunately, there are numerous OSH service 
delivery models in industry which add to the confusion. If this is an issue that is 
eroding the leadership credibility of the OSH function, then accountabilities versus 
responsibilities should be mapped objectively.
In the next chapter, the discussions will explore organisational capacity more 
deeply. Some of the topics covered include why people take risks as opposed to man‑
age risks, as both an individual behavioural choice and an organisational cultural 
norm. The Capacity Reservoir which was presented in PSM1 will be revisited in 
Chapter 9 and linked to the concept of resilience which has emerged as a key success 
factor for organisations.

RISK‑TAKING VERSUS RISK‑MANAGING BEHAVIOUR
People make risk‑ and opportunity‑based decisions every day. An announcement 
comes over the radio about a traffic jam on the freeway and that crews are currently 
clearing debris from the road. A worker about to leave the office in the city has vari‑
ous options for the drive home. They take the freeway and hope for the best, or take 
an alternative route, or go to the bar where colleagues are having Friday afternoon 
drinks. They choose the latter and promise themselves they will only have one low 
alcohol beverage. Hours later…
What is occurring is a basic process of deciding to either take the risk or manage 
the risk of getting stuck on the freeway, given what is known about the situation at 
hand. In a personal context, the consequences tend to be self‑centric. Convicted drink 
drivers for instance go through a complicated process reflecting on moral values. 
Retrospective accounts of their behaviour focus on four dimensions: drink‑driving 
as non‑voluntary behaviour, as a strategic behaviour, as a relationship they have 
with control, and with ‘normalcy’ (Fynbo and Jarvinen, 2011). Drink drivers display 
positive attitudes to their own ability to drink‑drive with few adverse consequences 
(Stephens et al., 2017). Unfortunately, the risk takers in society tend to underplay any 
negative outcomes for themselves and seldom consider the potential impact on oth‑
ers. In cultures where heavy drinking is socially acceptable, these behaviours may be 
reinforced by normalisation of these deviant behaviours.
In the workplace, there is certain conduct that is simply forbidden such as con‑
sumption, supply and private sale of alcohol and other drugs. The system is designed 
to eradicate these unacceptable acts through policy, testing and disciplinary pro‑
cedures and for minor alcohol offences, help through an employee assistance pro‑
gramme to deal with underlying issues. Consumption of alcohol and other drugs is 
in the extreme range of risk‑taking at work. Other less apparent risk‑taking choices 
occur as a normal part of task performance and collectively, reflects the culture of 
the organisation.
The relationship between behaviours and culture was presented as two 
 alternatives – risk‑taking versus risk‑managing – in the Risk Behaviour Model (Van 
der Stap, 2008). It builds on Risk Homeostasis Theory (Wilde, 1982). Figure  9.1 
illustrates this model. The first panel looks at the positive payoff of risk‑taking when 
there’s no negative consequence. In the second panel is the undesirable/ unexpected 
outcome where an injury or incident occurs prompting the individual and the organ‑
isation to learn the hard way about the consequences of their actions.
The figure in the first panel starts the positive payoff of the risk‑taking cycle with 
misdirected values or internal drivers (1) oriented towards short‑term personal gain. 
This could include financial benefits and social acceptance. A person may believe that

by getting the job done faster they can take on more paid tasks thereby increasing their 
earnings. They may ‘just get on with it’ to fit into a production‑ centred culture and to 
be accepted by their peers. These perceived benefits (2) lead to risk‑taking behaviour 
(3) as shown. When there are no negative consequences, only a positive payoff (4), this 
reinforces the decision choice which tends to be repeated (5). The person’s relationship 
with risk is consolidated. At the centre of this cycle is the collective impact. A culture 
driven by hard production targets and unconstructive peer pressure where few dare 
to challenge the status quo may be perpetuated. Consider the earlier example where 
underground workers falsified their vehicle checks, ignoring the faulty park brakes, 
to ensure that today’s production wasn’t hindered by lack of personnel transportation. 
The peer group may continue to focus on increasing rewards even more via collective 
effort to maximise production. As shown in the first panel, the perceived benefits of 
risk‑taking are the primary driver of the actions that are taken.
Concurrently, as shown in the second panel, these directed values (1) are blocked 
so is serious consideration of the consequences (2). This mindset may be an individual 
or group trait that obstructs consideration of better (safer) alternatives. Risk‑taking 
behaviour is acceptable (3) because personnel believe they will get away with it. The 
nature of risk reinforces this as in most cases, these deviances don’t result in losses, 
simply due to the laws of probability. It’s only where there’s a negative outcome (4), 
such as a fatality or serious injury, that the individual and organisation learn the hard 
way (5). The centre of this side of the figure has the same destructive cultural traits.
This cycle is difficult to change unless the underlying contributing factors are 
addressed. When personnel don’t have balanced values, they’re not considering 
the risks of personal harm, injury to others or loss of future earning capacity that 
can result from serious injuries. Their timeframes are short – get it done and get 
paid. At an organisational level, the same patterns appear amongst the management 
team  –  today’s production rather than consistency and continuity of production. 
There can be unconstructive peer pressure even in the supervisory ranks as shift 
bosses compete for the title of being ‘champion of production’. The ‘winner’ has the 
crew who regularly achieves the most daily/ weekly/ monthly tons of ore, pounds 
of meat or widgets sent to market. What doesn’t get considered is whether safety 
and maintenance issues are addressed on this supervisor’s shift. The feedback from 
senior management may overlook the deficiencies in responsible risk management 
in favour of targets. It’s only when there’s a significant loss that poor leadership and 
risk competencies become evident if the executive is motivated to uncover these root 
causes. They may be reluctant to dig that deeply and prefer to level blame at site 
management to protect themselves from culpability.
In this reactive approach, depending on the severity of the injury, lessons may be 
short‑lived as old habits re‑emerge because the fundamentals of the culture, beliefs 
and values haven’t genuinely shifted. In operations, this tends to be perpetuated 
unless there is a significant change in leadership direction from the top.
Operational managers will feel trapped with little authority to influence 
change if the source of the problem is at the executive 
level of the enterprise.214 Productive Safety Management
Experience teaches many professionals whose role has a strong connection with 
operational risk that organisations can fall into the categories of ‘The Good’, ‘The 
Bad’ and ‘The Simply Irresponsible’ (The author’s colloquial version of Hudson’s 
Maturity Model (See Foster and Hoult, 2013 reference for explanation). When start‑
ing a new role with a ‘Good’ organisation, the focus can be on continual improve‑
ment to raise performance further. ‘The Bad’ provide an opportunity for significant 
positive change which starts with some of the strategies described in earlier chapters. 
These include management system gaps analysis, facilitating activities so that man‑
agers and supervisors are actively involved in leading practical risk assessments, 
and holding discussions with senior management about areas of non‑alignment, such 
as policy versus practice. Depending on the circumstances, it’s not unreasonable to 
transform a poorly performing into a well‑performing organisation within two years 
from a risk management perspective, provided that senior management has an appe‑
tite for loss prevention and exploitation of opportunities.
‘The Simply Irresponsible’ organisation is often characterised by a business in 
which senior managers feel little accountability to external parties. They may be 
business owners or have a high financial stake in the enterprise. Their positions may 
have been created by a relationship with those owners generating a sense of indebted‑
ness that can compromise ethical decision‑making. Serious OSH compliance issues 
may be ready identifiable to the trained eye but other anti‑regulatory behaviours such 
as breaches of employment rights may also be occurring.
A spirit of non‑compliance against legal requirements may epitomise the 
risk‑taking profile of senior management which then cascades to poor 
treatment of workers apart from a core group considered to be 
within the ‘inner sanctum’.
Referring to Figure 9.1, ‘The Good’ don’t display the traits shown in the risk‑ taking 
perspective and have an aversion to learning the hard way from incidents. They main‑
tain chronic wariness of failure and direct efforts to avoid it. ‘The Bad’ may be char‑
acterised by risk‑taking at the start of a transformation process but are able to undergo 
a realistic self‑assessment with well‑directed guidance, to make the changes. ‘The 
Simply Irresponsible’ organisation won’t break the cycle if the fundamentals of the 
business such as structure, ownership and senior management, remain unchanged. 
They’ll continue to run the gauntlet of failures and potential consequences including 
prosecution. Direct contractors engaged by such enterprises risk also being exposed 
to such outcomes especially if their work is operational. They may compromise com‑
pliance to maintain their contracts.
As discussed earlier, historically, the response of the OSH profession for organisa‑
tions needing significant improvement has included the introduction of behaviour‑ 
based safety (BBS) programmes and the ‘Safety First’ policy. This strategy assumes 
that the workers are the problem. ‘Fix’ the workers and the company’s woes will 
magically disappear. Throughout this book, this approach has been thoroughly criti‑
cised. Operational managers, supervisors and workers need practical tools that assist 
them to manage operational risks (safety, efficiency, quality, reliability). When these 
elements of the system are in place, they tend to guide the desired behaviours.Operational Capacity 215
Organisational capacity starts with having well‑designed systems and tools 
for operations to use. Concurrently, organisations need to mature in terms 
of values, leadership, accountabilities, strategy, and self‑discipline.
Many large corporations have undergone the process of defining their values. These 
often include terms such as safety, dignity, respect, accountability, courage, curiosity, 
community benefit and diversity. An internet search of various organisational web‑
sites shows that these values have proliferated in the last 20 years as part of defining 
corporate and enterprise identity.
In PSM1, a different set of values was described which align to risk management 
as a life skill. These were the sanctity of life (protection of safety) and the right to 
quality of life (protection of health). OSH is founded on these values. Alone, how‑
ever, they don’t provide balance or meaning in an organisational context where profit 
or service delivery (non‑profit) also need to be considered. Good organisations / 
industries / economies create opportunities for long‑term financial security and 
social acceptance. A worker can’t sustain earnings for their working life if they suf‑
fer a serious injury or industrial illness. This value is needed to balance short‑term 
versus long‑term financial gains. Without conversations about these considerations, 
personnel don’t have the opportunity to internalise what it means to manage risk as 
a life skill.
The final value proposed to underpin the Risk Ethos is social acceptance. The 
culture of the organisation determines whether risk‑taking is accepted (socially 
endorsed) or opposed (socially intolerable). How this is conveyed will have numerous 
touchpoints including the design of the management system such as in training pack‑
ages, in signs and symbols, and in formal verbal communications like planned team 
meetings. Messaging is also conveyed verbally through informal communications.
The four values  –  sanctity of life, quality of life, financial security and social 
acceptance – should underpin the enterprise’s Risk Ethos. A decision to take risks 
that aren’t endorsed is one that threatens all four values. For instance, if a produc‑
tion supervisor decides to keep the production line running until the end of shift to 
achieve their daily target, despite known equipment defects, there needs to be a cor‑
rection factor identifying such actions as culturally unacceptable. In current manage‑
ment systems, there are no criteria to flag sound from unsound decisions that have an 
impact on risk levels.
A production‑centred, risk‑taking culture won’t change without a mindset 
transformation at the senior management level which then needs to be cascaded 
to operations to at least the supervisory level. Figure 9.2 illustrates a more mature 
individual‑ and enterprise‑level relationship with risk with well‑directed, balanced 
 values and internal drivers (in the first panel at 1). Benefits and consequences are 
weighed up (2) meaning that informed risk‑based decisions are made. Timeframes 
shift outwardly to consider flow‑on effects. For example, the production supervisor’s 
target isn’t today’s production on their shift but continuity of production over a period 
that allows for contingencies across all shifts. This takes into consideration the work 
of all the production shift supervisors. Risk managing behaviour that involves ensur‑
ing critical safety and maintenance issues are addressed, are chosen (3). In this lon‑
ger period which has been agreed with management (e.g. a month), the objective is 216 Productive Safety Management

continuity of production without disruptive losses. The positive payoff (4) is loss 
prevention, teamwork and reliability in the production process. This reward cycle 
reinforces this behavioural choice (5).
At the centre of the first panel of the figure, values are put into practice. A risk‑based 
culture develops in which there’s positive influence amongst the peer group to uphold 
the standards they’ve set for themselves. Risk leadership becomes visible and enables 
competencies to be developed where the risks must be managed operationally.
In the second panel of the figure, the cycle is repeated, however, if a significant 
loss occurs (the negative outcome at 4), the organisation and individuals respond with 
greater commitment to managing risk effectively. There’s an appetite for learning 
from mistakes that reinforces the need to do better and a deep desire for prevention 
of losses.
From an operational perspective, a cautionary word is needed about production 
targets. If an unrealistic monthly target has been set, then operations are highly likely 
to fail. The further they slip behind, the more production pressure will mount result‑
ing in extreme demands being put on the systems of production and the culture of the 
site. Consideration should be given to the impact of this on degradation and rising 
entropic risk levels. The Entropy Model highlighted the potential for losses under 
these conditions including incidents and injuries. If realistic monthly targets have 
been set but operations still fall behind, then questions should be asked about incre‑
mental losses that may be occurring along the entropic risk curve. It may be that 
systems of production aren’t performing to management’s expectations and there 
should be identifiable reasons for this, for instance, equipment downtime, employee 
absences, inability of contractors to deliver their scope on time etc.
Considering the key messages in Figures 9.1 and 9.2, how often do organisations 
provide a safe environment for conversations about workers’ personal relationships 
with risk? Everyone has parameters around what they would or wouldn’t do and 
under what circumstances. From experience, it’s interesting to find out what activities 
people enjoy outside of work. In young males in particular, the profile often includes 
riding motorbikes, water sports, partying etc. They have a relationship with risk often 
with a positive mental association, but they may also have a relationship with safety 
that may have negative associations, such as when they were injured. Shared conver‑
sations are important as part of the learning and maturing process.
Talking about risk tends to be more engaging than always talking about safety. 
There are many stereotypes about safety versus risk. Safety is often associated with 
‘playing it safe’ which is contradictory to society’s entertainment where the hero is 
revered. Risk is synonymous with adventure, courage and excitement so it’s little 
wonder that ‘safety meetings’ become uninspiring. Media such as extreme sports 
videos can be a captivating dialogue starter, especially when compared with tradi‑
tional safety topics. In these conversations, people should be invited to consider their 
relationship with risk to establish regular internal dialogue. The objective is that 
future behavioural choices are made based on an informed relationship.
The organisation’s objective should be that workers have regular internal 
and external dialogue asking, ‘Is it worth the risk?’218 Productive Safety Management
Workers expect financial rewards and positive relationships from work and their pri‑
mary reason for employment is to provide for life outside of work. Unfortunately, 
workplace injuries and illnesses don’t ‘clock off’ at the end of the shift or on holidays 
or at retirement. Managers and supervisors should regularly ask, ‘Is it worth the 
risk?’ to convey chronic wariness of operational residual and entropic risks, and to 
also demonstrate care and concern for people’s health, safety and wellbeing.
Real change occurs when the Risk Ethos is accepted based on the perceived com‑
patibility between this philosophy and workers’ own values. The probability that an 
action will be taken, or a behaviour will be followed increases dramatically when 
people develop a belief in its value (Topf, 2000). This means that the experiential 
learning provided to enlist employee commitment has to have the same rationale 
that applies to the management team. Some mature corporations have multi‑layered 
programmes according to job level, but everyone (managers, workers, contractors) 
must complete the basic values‑based training programme. This makes sense as 
there must be consistent messaging and language at hierarchical levels to achieve 
a values‑driven culture. These programmes, however, shouldn’t be the end of the 
learning process, otherwise, they become a ‘tick‑and‑flick’ exercise that puts every‑
one through a branding exercise. Personnel need opportunities to test the truth – to 
see if what they’ve learned makes sense and works for them in practice. In this stage, 
the supervisor is the most influential person affecting the operational behavioural 
choices of their team members.
These values‑based training sessions need to be adapted to the culture of the soci‑
ety in which personnel belong. For instance, programmes that end in each partici‑
pant standing up in front of their peers and making a verbal pledge to work safely 
don’t fit an Australian audience. Other nationalities may be comfortable with the 
approach. Some cultures may prefer a collective commitment to an openly individu‑
alised undertaking. Overall, compliance‑driven expectations shouldn’t be part of the 
programme because they put people into a parent–child relationship with the organ‑
isational culture which misses the point of developing risk management as a life skill 
(not simply an organisational directive).
DAY‑TO‑DAY LEADERSHIP FOR SUPERVISORS
Operational personnel generally prefer hands‑on learning over the classroom. With 
this in mind, the Entropy Model has been adapted to describe how leaders can engage 
personnel more effectively through interactions that develop new technical compe‑
tencies concurrently building individual confidence and resilience. This is achieved 
through recognition and feedback that collectively enhances organisational capacity, 
with all interactions occurring in the workplace (Grieve and Van der Stap, 2020).
Figure 2.2 illustrated the phases of entropic risk in the HR system of production. 
Personnel can go through degradation, corrective action, maintenance, optimal per‑
formance then degradation again. The new employee contributes to initial degradation 
because there’s a gap between their KSAs and those needed by the new employer. This 
can, however, also occur with experienced personnel whenever changes occur. It’s a 
human performance reality that with change, there’s often a decline in specific skills toOperational Capacity 219
do new tasks and an initial lack of confidence when undertaking the work. A concerted 
effort is required by the organisation to proactively develop the requisite competen‑
cies. Eventually, the individual or group of workers will achieve optimal performance 
(safety, efficiency, and quality), as shown by the adapted Entropy Model.
The concern is that cultural degradation within the organisation can occur leading 
to individuals’ loss of motivation and/or self‑belief for various reasons. Operationally, 
this is frequently observed with change fatigue; the ongoing processes of successive 
initiatives without periods of stabilisation. Site managers and supervisors particu‑
larly feel the pressure to just make things happen, make them work. There can be an 
information gap between what is expected to be done and why the new initiative from 
senior management is required. This potentially leads to distrust and growing cyni‑
cism about management’s motives especially if more and more is demanded from 
workers without the resources or support to succeed.
Some management literature talks about adopting the mantra of being a person 
who is learning as a way of adapting to the many organisational dynamics which are 
outside the control of the individual. In practice however, it’s the enterprise’s respon‑
sibility to ensure that operational managers and supervisors are provided with the 
structures and coaching they need to implement new programmes.
For frontline leaders to develop risk leadership competencies, they need 
opportunities to rationally test and verify the benefits of risk management 
programmes and processes. Expecting them to just accept 
change is unrealistic.
Most frontline supervisors are action‑oriented not concept‑oriented, so they’re more 
inclined to develop risk leadership competencies in the workplace than in the class‑
room. Active involvement in risk‑based activities is a far better way to learn and 
it creates an environment where people feel more at ease. The following practical 
example illustrates this point.
In Chapter 5 on technological risk, a new truck was purchased for the remote 
exploration team to eliminate the reliance on contracted logistics providers. This also 
was intended to improve efficiency and reduce manual handling (the truck had a flat‑
bed tray which could be loaded onto and off the back using the truck‑mounted crane). 
A risk assessment needed to be done on this new piece of equipment. The operational 
manager and site team were expected the OSH manager to run a risk workshop in 
the training room on site. Instead, the team were invited outside to where the truck 
was parked, and the OSH manager started asking operational questions. The first was 
how the spare tyre, which was mounted on a hydraulic arm at the back of the cab, 
was taken down for a tyre change. This had been retrofitted after the truck had been 
purchased. Through a demonstration, it was found that not even the physically stron‑
gest worker was able to lower the tyre by turning the extension bar placed in a socket 
(a simple cranking mechanism). After considerable effort, the tyre on the arm was 
extended 1.5 metres from the side of the truck. It was impossible to lower it or return 
it to position. The mechanism was inoperable. The first part of the risk assessment 
was simply to test how things worked (or in this case, didn’t work).220 Productive Safety Management
An operational risk assessment on a new or existing piece of plant or equipment 
can be led by the supervisor by testing and talking through how things work or are 
supposed to work, and the energies involved. For instance, on a drill rig (depending 
on the type), there will likely be pressurised systems (hydraulic and air), mechanical 
energies (such as rotating drill head), chemical energies (hydrocarbons, drill muds, 
dust generation), electrical energies (batteries), sound energy (noise) etc. One of the 
best ways to capture this information is in photographs with short descriptions in a 
user‑friendly format, for instance, Powerpoint that can be used in a training session 
or printed as a handout. The risk assessment therefore also serves the purpose of 
being a training tool. If it’s a corporate requirement for the information to be cap‑
tured in a spreadsheet or database, then the OSH professional should undertake this 
work as a separate task that doesn’t demand the time of the operational team. A brief 
verification session can be done with them later if a sign‑off process is required.
Frontline supervisors can lead risk assessments when these are done as 
practical exercises focused on how things work (energies) and how things 
can go wrong, rather than an academic exercise centred on populating a 
spreadsheet or database.
These hands‑on exercises use an inquiry process which provides a learning experi‑
ence for all participants. Not everyone will have the technical knowledge to con‑
tribute to the risk analysis and those who don’t will learn from those that do. This 
approach follows the principles of inquiry‑based learning. Pedaste et al. (2015) dis‑
cussed learning in five phases: orientation, conceptualisation, investigation, conclu‑
sion and discussion. These are driven by scientifically oriented questions most suited 
to an academic environment. In operations, however, it’s better just to go from orien‑
tations straight into investigation which involves exploration, experimentation, and 
data interpretation (e.g. review of the operator’s manual). From here, conclusions can 
be reached which lead to discussion. Pedaste et al.’s variety of inquiry phases are 
useful for the risk professional when assisting operations in these reviews. Some of 
the key points around communication include debate, sharing individual questions, 
communicating new understandings, elaborating, and justifying explanations. These 
are action‑oriented conversations that can deliver improvements in participants’ risk 
management skills, whilst also providing the supervisor with an opportunity to lead 
in a context where they feel confident. As suggested earlier, the paperwork (spread‑
sheet, report etc.) can come later. These are outputs for the system and shouldn’t 
constrain the process if there’s a better way of doing the risk assessment with high 
levels of involvement.
Unfortunately, in the OSH profession, the bureaucracy of the system 
and the subservience of operations to the system, tends to stifle practical 
approaches to risk management. The system defines the ‘square’ and people 
are discouraged from thinking ‘outside the square’.Operational Capacity 221
Risk leadership competencies are developed through these experiences, which will 
affect how new situations that require practical problems are approached and solved 
in the future. Traditionally, these types of risk assessments have been developed by 
the OSH function through a narrow lens that office professionals may be comfortable 
with (such as the spreadsheet), but which don’t work in the field. For instance, the 
inability to retract the tyre on the hydraulic arm of the truck described above, would 
have serious consequences if this had been discovered during a journey. The operator 
could have been stranded in a remote area on the side of the road. Help could have 
been hours away. The recovery process would have been a costly exercise.
Many organisations lack an ongoing, strategic approach to leadership development 
after the initial onboarding of personnel or when changes are introduced into the enter‑
prise. This was illustrated by Grieve and Van der Stap (2020) in the article, “Safety and 
Entropy: A Leadership Issue”. Figure 9.3 is an adaptation of one of the diagrams used 
to explain the degradation of human resources (to the individual level) after onboarding 
and because of changes to systems of production.
The figure presents five phases of HR development that the leader can influence to 
minimise HR entropic risk and optimise performance. It starts on the left‑hand side with 
Phase 1. This applies to onboarding or any initiative requiring management of change 
(MOC). Essential information about the organisation or about the planned change is 
communicated. An attempt is often made to provide a definition of success by shar‑
ing organisational goals or the objectives of the change. This establishes a common lan‑
guage and clear expectations. Initial training for onboarding will involve orientations 
and inductions, whilst for management of change, it will likely be competency training 
on the new equipment or new process. Operational risk management practices are often 
integrated into these technical training programmes, pointing out the major hazards of 
the site and the work with required controls. In the figure, Phase 1 shows that the entropic 
risk (dashed line) isn’t applicable. This is because the new incumbent hasn’t started work 
yet. For MOC, work is yet to begin with the modified systems of production.
In Phase 2, new incumbents have completed their onboarding and begin work. 
They introduce degradation into the workplace (shown by the downward dashed 
line). The frontline leader needs to be conscious of the potential for rising entropic 
risk which would be occurring in the opposite direction to the degradation line i.e. 
upwards (not shown). Relationship‑driven strategies are required. The same applies 
after the initial MOC process and people are working to new systems, processes or 
with equipment. Leadership behaviours in this second phase focus on providing the 
team with an explanation of why it’s necessary to work as planned or why the change 
initiative is needed. The dialogue centres not only on technical aspects of the work 
but also on building confidence by exploring concerns, listening, soliciting ideas, and 
providing encouragement. It may be necessary to reinforce values and the culture of 
the business if workers become cynical due to change fatigue.
The objective for the supervisor is to get through Phase 3 using upgrade strate‑
gies and move towards Phase 4 where the upgraded state is sustained. In Phase 3, 
the leader proactively develops and maintains the team by listening, acknowledging 
past successes, and providing perspective on the progress made. Where problems 222 Productive Safety Management Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Phase 5 Phase N Onboarding or Management of Change (Core elements) Initial Degradation Proactive Development (Maintenance) Optimisation Cultural Degradation Essential information: who, what, when, where and how Shared definition of success Common language Clear expectations Initial technical training Operational risk management practices Explain why the way we work is necessary Explain why the changes are needed Explore concerns Listen Solicit ideas to address issues Encourage growth and skill development Reinforce values and culture Listen Acknowledge past success Provide perspective Facilitate collaborative problem-solving Give redirecting feedback Encourage Acknowledge high levels of competence Support autonomy Establish as expert Provide positive feedback Offer developing feedback Encourage innovation Value contributions Aversion to complacency Listen Acknowledge high levels of contribution Facilitate self-reliant problem solving Give redirecting feedback Provide perspective Encourage A concerted effort to address complacency Continue Phases 3 and 4 as needed If changes occur to any systems of production, return to Phase 1.

arise, these are resolved collaboratively. With minor issues, feedback might provide 
redirection and encouragement.
At Phase 4, the high‑performance team is competent in the new ways of working. 
This should be acknowledged, and support given for autonomy. In this phase, work 
standards are maintained by the team independently of the supervisor’s physical 
presence. When this occurs, it provides confirmation of resilience within the busi‑
ness. Progressively, some individuals may become the local subject matter expert or 
‘go‑to‑person’ for specialised tasks. The leader steps back to optimise the capacity of 
the team to deliver and provides developmental feedback, encouragement for innova‑
tion and appreciation of contributions. This consolidates competence and confidence.
Importantly, the leader encourages the team to have an aversion to complacency 
either directly or indirectly. For instance, in earlier chapters an example was given 
of a maintenance workshop overhaul which resulted in a place for everything and 
everything in its place (HSE, efficiency and quality in design). When the supervisor 
returned to the workplace after a period of absence and observed that high standards 
of housekeeping had been sustained, feedback was given to one of the team mem‑
bers. The reply was, ‘It always looks like this.’ That’s a sign of success. Later, the 
leader thanked the team for their professionalism (probably in colloquial language). 
Interestingly, in this culture what tends to happen is that individuals will correct 
each other if someone takes a shortcut, effectively creating a productive, healthy 
peer group pressure that fits the system and lifts the standards of those who tend to 
be laissez‑faire. New starters who enter this environment are raised to the expecta‑
tions of the group in a short period of time because standards are set from the outset.
Phase 5 illustrates what may happen if the standards of the group decline or exter‑
nal factors start to impact morale. The leader aims to lift the team by listening, 
acknowledging high levels of contributions, and facilitating self‑reliant problem‑ 
solving. The team may need redirecting feedback, a sounding board to provide 
perspective, and reinforcement to achieve high measures of safety, efficiency and 
quality. In this phase, there needs to be a concerted effort to address complacency 
and underlying factors should be investigated without blame. Any degradation needs 
to be tackled by returning to Phases 3 and 4, as shown in Phase N. If changes occur 
to any systems of production, an MOC process may be initiated so the team returns 
to Phase 1.
Phase 5 can be problematic because cultural degradation, especially in safety, can 
produce organisational risks.
The organisational risk is that leaders who believe their work was done once the 
employee moves into Phase 4 now see any failure (i.e., an incident) as the employ‑
ee’s fault, which leads to discipline and retraining as the corrective actions of choice. 
Cultural degradation is not because of a lack of KSAs, but a lack of recognition and 
feedback to ensure that the KSAs are applied consistently.
(Grieve and Van der Stap, 2020)
Unfortunately, many leaders think that their development work is done in Phase 4, 
and thereafter, their primary role is to manage the workload. This allows compla‑
cency to set in.224 Productive Safety Management
Conversations between supervisor and worker revert to technical 
(e.g. how a machine is working) and social (e.g. what happening in sport 
on the weekend) topics. The need for the worker to be engaged in the work 
process becomes forgotten and the supervisor regresses to being a manager 
rather than a leader.
The OSH management system and cultural branding can result in bland transactional 
relationships when statistics become the primary driver of language rather than risk 
leadership, workforce capacity and relationships.
The traditional safety measure of OSHA recordable injury rate and experience modifi‑
cation rate drive leaders and employees to adopt the ‘be safe’ mentality. This mentality 
is demonstrated by statements such as ‘as long as everyone goes home with all their 
fingers and toes’.
(Grieve and Van der Stap, 2020)
(NOTE: The Experience Modification Rate Calculator is a measure used in pay‑
roll classification to determine the workers’ compensation insurance premium. 
This reflects the company’s safety performance and risk management. Experience 
Modification Rate (EMR) Calculator – Savvy Calculator, 2024).
OSH metrics are important, but these should stay firmly within the OSH function 
and reports to senior management. Billboards that display number of days without 
a lost‑time injury (LTI) convey wrong priorities putting ‘the cart before the horse’. 
These results are an outcome of numerous factors which may include effective opera‑
tional risk management or unfortunately, non‑reporting of incidents or management 
of injured workers so that they don’t lose a day/ shift of work to fit the LTI classifica‑
tion. The site’s senior managers would want to be certain that the result is down to 
good management if they’re expecting the workforce to see this as a success they 
also own.
The situational and transformation leadership styles described above may seem 
daunting for some managers and supervisors to adopt. It requires authenticity in their 
relationships with subordinates and a sound foundation of risk and opportunity man‑
agement competencies. These skills can be developed with time through the practical 
risk evaluation activities described above. OSH professionals have an important role 
to play.
OSH professionals should enable real work, real conversations, real 
understanding of risk and real results. They should do the OSH work by 
taking operational information and putting it into the OSH management 
system to meet hierarchical reporting requirements. They should own this 
interface between operations and senior management.
Managers and supervisors should have minimal bureaucratic burden and be provided 
with systems that integrate OSH and operational risk management into day‑to‑day 
work. In addition to the workload, their focus should be on communications that 
empower the team. As a societal comparison, the cycle shown in Figure  9.3 has Operational Capacity 225
parallels to backing a sporting team. When the team goes into decline, supporters 
rally and acknowledge past successes (Phase 3). They reflect to provide perspec‑
tive on current performance. During periods of high performance having achieved 
numerous wins, complacency is considered a threat (Phase 4). The discipline that 
goes into training and execution is sustained. The coach seeks out other leaders in 
waiting within the team to value their contribution and provide developmental oppor‑
tunities. At a future point in time, supporters remain loyal despite a series of losses 
(Phase 5). They don’t just change allegiance when their team is down. The coach 
(leader) takes the reigns again to raise morale and team performance. This is a mind‑
set that could be helpful to operational managers and supervisors working through 
the cycles of HR entropic risk. Motivation starts with self‑motivation with the leader 
looking inwardly before they turn their vision outwardly.
There are too few conversations about successes in operations that 
celebrate a job done without incidents, on time and on budget because the 
work was properly risk assessed and planned with the involvement 
of key personnel.
The following is an example. A major seismic survey had to be undertaken by a 
specialist contractor on a mine site. The overarching legislative requirement is that 
contractors comply with the mine operator’s safety management system (SMS); how‑
ever, given the contractor’s high technical skills, imposing the mine system entirely 
would have been counter‑productive to effective risk management.
The footprint of the work involved numerous hazardous interfaces such as the 
active mining area, ore and waste stockpiles, an explosives storage facility, vegeta‑
tion stockpiles that would be used later for rehabilitation and internal roads with high 
levels of traffic. This meant that there were many internal stakeholders who needed 
to be consulted to manage the risks. There were a few key critical success factors in 
how the work was executed:
1. Trust: The contractor was treated as a partner in the execution of the work. 
The traditional principal‑contractor (parent‑child) approach, still commonly 
seen in industry, was replaced with a mindset of enabling the contractor to 
deliver.
2. Stakeholder Engagement: Representatives from all parties who would be 
impacted by the scope of work and whose activities could affect the seismic 
survey were brought into the room. This included managers and supervi‑
sors responsible for the active mining area, drilling and blasting, production 
scheduling, the contract owners and the contractor.
3. Risk Assessment: Stakeholders participated in a risk workshop that focused 
on how the work could be done safely, to the required quality and produc‑
tively using a multi‑disciplinary, multi‑objective approach not just ‘safety’. 
In addition, inspections were undertaken of the proposed work areas to 
identify potential issues such as access to the tops of stockpiles and the 
interface with active mining. The risks and required controls were captured 
in a scope of work risk register.226 Productive Safety Management
4. Planning and Communication: An Operational Risk Management Plan was 
developed for the scope of work which clearly explained the required risk 
mitigations and communication practices. Importantly, it also explained the 
boundaries of accountability between the mine holder, the contract owner 
and the contractor. The plan was reviewed and fine turned with the input of 
stakeholders.
5. Execution: Everyone worked to the plan. A critical piece was the agreement 
that the contractor would be given authority over the area in which there 
were working to a radius of 50 metres. This was the case for the survey 
footprint except in the active mining area, which needed to remain under 
control of Mine Production because of high risks including heavy mobile 
plant and drilling and blasting activities. This approach enabled the contrac‑
tor to work their own SMS whilst interfaces outside their work area were 
managed by the mine operator and contract owner.
The feedback from the contractor after the completion of the project without inci‑
dent, on time and on budget was that they appreciated that the client was proac‑
tive in establishing trust in the contractor. This enabled a collaborative approach to 
safety and helped to identify and manage the ‘real risks’. This facilitated stakeholder 
engagement and provided a direct line of communication if any complications or 
changes arose during the execution of the work. The example highlights the need to 
focus on the work and who is responsible for what.
A useful concept is ‘front‑end loading’ of the project or scope through 
consultation, risk assessment and planning of the work for success. 
Effective risk management ensures that safety, efficiency, 
and a quality job are outcomes.
CAPACITY IN RESERVE, RESILIENCE AND RESOURCEFULNESS
The broader objective of investing time and resources in the leadership skills of 
managers and supervisors is that they in turn, become skilled coaches of their 
team members and more effective when working with each other. There’s exten‑
sive literature available on leadership development and some of the better resources 
include those that explain sound fundamentals that can be applied in any workplace 
and at home, such as Stephen Covey’s “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” and 
“Principle‑Centered Leadership”.
In PSM1, the focus of leadership development was on building organisational 
capacity at all levels of the hierarchy and creating a mindset change towards the 
value of human resources. This can be achieved in practical ways. As discussed 
throughout this book, both bottom‑up and top‑down strategies are required concur‑
rently. The OSH discipline can be used as an example of a grass roots approach. 
According to OSH legislation, organisations must manage risks to prevent injuries 
and harm to the health of workers. It’s incumbent on OSH managers to ensure their 
employer has a programme to prevent fatalities, serious injuries, and debilitating Operational Capacity 227
illnesses. These programmes are usually referred to as fatal risk critical control pro‑
grammes or major hazard standards (which were introduced in previous chapters).
Many workplaces have commonalities in relation to these fatal risks, for instance, 
electricity, working at heights, hazardous substances, light vehicles (company cars), 
fitness for work, emergencies etc. Each of these will have controls that are critical 
for injury and incident prevention which means that there are numerous checks to be 
undertaken on a regular basis. Medical emergencies are a relatively straightforward 
example that applies to every workplace. The controls required include having an 
emergency management plan; having a current contact list of internal personnel and 
external support services to call if an emergency arises; having trained first‑aid offi‑
cers; having and practising emergency evacuation drills; having first‑aid equipment 
available and kits that are properly stocked etc. Putting together a verification process 
involves having a schedule for checking these critical controls on a planned basis 
and assigning this work. Given that a workplace may have numerous fatal risks there 
may be a significant workload of verifications to be undertaken. The most practical 
approach is to decentralise this work to key personnel in each workplace. They col‑
lect the information which is reported to the OSH Department who then collate the 
data and report findings formally to senior management. The traditional approach 
of centralising the data collection using OSH advisors is impractical and defeats the 
opportunity for operational ownership and involvement.
One approach to make sure the work gets done is to ask the workplace supervi‑
sor to tell someone to do the checks when required and report back to them. This 
becomes another dull task that workers must perform, often being an irritation as 
it takes them away from their ‘real job’. A different and better approach is to build 
capacity. The supervisor, in collaboration with the OSH professional, may invite their 
team members to take on various roles. In this case, the role would be to champion 
the operational emergency management function in their work area. In return, the 
volunteer would be provided with first aid training, evacuation warden training, and 
time away from normal duties to do the required checks. These include that first aid 
officers have current training certificates, that emergency drills are conducted as 
planned, and that first aid kits are properly stocked etc. The planning of the criti‑
cal control programme needs to include coverage. Several workplaces in proximity 
may only need one or two champions, whereas a separate workplace may need its 
own representation. How this is structured will depend on the risk. For instance, in 
a high‑rise building, there should be at least one emergency champion per floor with 
coverage for absences, as well as several first aid officers and evacuation wardens. 
Many workplaces take this approach but without considering the benefits from a 
cultural perspective.
Decentralising safety critical controls and the verification process builds 
capacity and a strong operational risk culture.
In PSM1, the concept of developing capacity was illustrated using the ‘Capacity 
Reservoir’ which holds the collective leadership skills and competencies of the 
workforce. This has been updated in Figure 9.4 and the descriptor originally used, 228 Productive Safety Management
‘Resourcefulness’ remains but ‘Resilience’ has been added to reflect the need for 
adaptation in the face of crises and significant threats beyond the direct control of 
the organisation.
The figure starts on the left‑hand side with recommended inputs. The first is an 
effective recruitment and selection process to minimise HR residual risks. This is 
followed by a structured onboarding process to accelerate learning and mitigate HR 
entropic risks. After this, the critical process of providing on‑the‑job coaching or 
mentoring occurs. As described earlier, workers need support during the assimila‑
tion phase and whenever management of change is required. This is often missing 
in organisations and the supervisor‑worker and organisation‑worker relationship can 
become transactional after the initial enthusiasm of the new job has waned.
Importantly, operational risk management is identified as a life skill which has 
much more value than simply compliance to the system. This entails the capac‑
ity to identify risks within a dynamic environment, to problem‑solve and make 
informed decisions, particularly, in a team situation. This competency is best devel‑
oped through participation in risk‑based activities which have a practical focus. This 
should become a natural experience for the supervisor who leads the team through 
the risk assessment considering safety, efficiency and the required quality of work 
concurrently. The discussion focuses on successful execution of the work. It should go 
without saying that ‘successful’ entails safe production to expected quality standards.
In Chapter 8, the discussions turned to visible leadership by board members, the exec‑
utive and senior managers. It was proposed that these personnel should be given metrics 
for site visits to ensure they get an understanding of the operational reality of the enter‑
prise they lead. Importantly, it’s not about completing the site visit under ideal conditions

but showing a deep interest in day‑to‑day challenges and opportunities. Through the 
eyes of a cynic, these visits should at least ensure that ‘officers’ of an enterprise have 
done their due diligence. In Western Australia for instance, an ‘officer’ is a person in 
the business who makes or participates in decision‑making that affects the whole or a 
substantial part of the enterprise’s activities (Department of Commerce, 2024). ‘Due 
Diligence’ entails taking reasonable steps to understand the nature of operations and of 
the hazards and risks associated with those operations (Worksafe WA, 2021).
As shown in the recommended inputs, capacity is also developed when the man‑
agement system has been integrated (meeting the needs of multiple functions in single 
documents or tools) and right‑sized to deliver what operations need to manage risk 
effectively. Management systems can either help or hinder organisational perfor‑
mance. These may be overly risk‑averse resulting in safety process causing unneces‑
sary bureaucracy and delays, which then result in increasing production pressures to 
complete work in less time. This was referred to earlier as low‑value thoroughness for 
safety’s sake without a sound risk basis. As an example, on a major construction proj‑
ect, one of the KPIs was the completion of a minimum number of Take‑5s per person 
per day. (A Take‑5 is a short personal risk assessment checklist usually in a booklet that 
the worker carries with them. A check is mandated for every time the worker enters 
a new work area and at other times according to the set criteria). There was about a 
thousand workers on site so the Take‑5s were also in the thousands. Two people were 
employed full‑time to enter the data into the system to generate the numbers, however, 
little was done with the data and the quality of the data was never questioned. This was 
a process that the construction managers and supervisors tolerated but didn’t support.
The management system should focus on the major concerns – fatalities, 
serious injuries, and debilitating illnesses. The relationship between unsafe 
acts, near misses, minor accidents, serious accidents, and fatalities, which 
argues that if minor events are eliminated then fatalities and major injuries 
will be prevented, is flawed.
Heinrich’s Triangle (Wikipedia, 2024) which was the basis of this relationship between 
unwanted events, has come under significant criticism recently from the OSH profes‑
sion. All organisations should focus on critical controls as their primary preventative 
programme. ‘Right‑sizing’ should entail bringing a realistic perspective to the data 
collected from operations and the responses this elicits. For instance, a rise in reported 
first‑aid cases means little without context. Unfortunately, misinformed senior manage‑
ment may be unnecessarily concerned. The increase may be good news that the report‑
ing culture has improved and hopefully, this isn’t just for safety but also efficiency and 
quality. It could mean that the capacity of the organisation to identify and rectify issues 
has improved. Alternatively, it could mean that the supplies of safety gloves have run 
out and people are continuing to work without them, leading to minor hand injuries. 
KPIs used to evaluate operational performance need to be contextualised.
Capacity relies on knowledge and sustaining the currency of that knowledge. 
Robust external and internal risk and opportunity monitoring is required to protect 
the enterprise from any factors that can cause it to become vulnerable. This was par‑
ticularly apparent in the earlier discussions about the Fourth Industrial Revolution 
and the rate of change that this has brought. At the most fundamental level, the 230 Productive Safety Management
enterprise must stay abreast of legislative changes, client demands and social trends 
that affect its operations. For instance, in an earlier chapter, it was mentioned that 
some large corporations are now requiring their contractors (including small opera‑
tors) to sign‑off on and be prepared to be audited against the corporation’s modern 
slavery policy. Risk monitoring processes are needed in businesses to ensure, for 
instance, that missed or disregarded communication from the client doesn’t result in 
loss of contract.
The final input shown is operational data analytics which are linked to these mon‑
itoring systems. The bottom line is for managers to better understand the strengths 
and weaknesses of their business and how these present risks and opportunities. In 
Chapters 3 to 6, each of the systems of production residual and entropic risks were 
explored and it was shown that different organisations can have quite distinct risk 
profiles according to the composition of these systems. Some businesses have higher 
levels of HSE in design in their technologies and infrastructure that significantly 
reduce their residual risk profile. Operational data should assist management to main‑
tain the quality of systems of production to optimise efficiency, safety and quality.
Figure 9.4 suggests that these inputs collectively determine the enterprise’s capac‑
ity (shown by the reservoir shape), the investment in which should lead to what is 
shown as an overflow of resilience and resourcefulness. This, like the transformation 
from ‘safety‑based thinking’ to ‘risk‑based thinking’, illustrates an important shift in 
mindset without using a slogan or branding such as, ‘People are our greatest asset’. 
What it means from an operational as well as strategic perspective, is:
Managers and supervisors should view their workforce’s capabilities for 
potential rather than finite competencies to fit the various job descriptions 
the enterprise has created.
The term ‘resilience’ has been around for more than 40 years but has become more 
significant in the last decade due to the rate of social and economic change as well as 
challenges such as COVID‑19 which demanded adaptability. There’s extensive litera‑
ture available on this topic and a useful summary is provided by Martin‑Breen and 
Anderies (2011). They state that resilience building involves increasing the capac‑
ity of individuals, communities or institutions to survive, adapt and advance despite 
acute crises and chronic stresses. This requires a multifaceted, interdisciplinary 
strategy and a systems view (Martin‑Breen and Anderies, 2011). At a global level, 
the term ‘wicked’ problems has emerged to identify current inherent catastrophic 
conditions such as poverty and climate change. ‘Wicked’ problems within business 
largely remain ‘undiscussables’ due to habits that result in organisational silence, as 
discussed in previous chapters. Many large enterprises, however, talk about building 
resilience but still lack the courage to challenge issues of non‑alignment such as silos, 
internal conflicts and the risks of leadership degradation.
Directing the term to an organisational focus, certain key correlations relate to 
systems. According to the researchers, these include ‘responsiveness to regulatory 
feedback mechanisms’. Put simply, the system (both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ components 
described earlier) should be built to include monitoring to ensure that these continue 
to perform as expected, and if not, this should trigger corrective action. From an Operational Capacity 231
HSE in design perspective, technologies should contain ‘modularity of interactions 
between parts, entailing failure containment’ (p.  53, Martin‑Breen and Anderies, 
2011). If one part of the physical systems of production fails, this shouldn’t set off a 
chain reaction that destroys the entire system. There should be redundancies to cover 
the contingency of component breakdowns. The final property of resilience is that 
the enterprise can internally self‑organise to adapt.
One of the key themes of resilience is the ability to learn and adjust to change with‑
out being forced to change in an ill‑directed way. In this regard, the term originally 
used in PSM1 – ‘resourcefulness’ – shouldn’t be disregarded. Resourcefulness is ‘the 
ability to find quick and clever ways to overcome difficulties’ (Cambridge Dictionary, 
2024) which resonates well with how operations need to work. There’s a positive 
relationship between managerial job performance and resourcefulness (Sahin et al., 
2015). The foundations of this skill include affective, intellectual and action‑oriented 
competencies. Affective behaviours include the ability to have a sense of equanimity 
and a problem‑solving orientation, to delay immediate gratification, and importantly, 
to demonstrate proactive involvement in the face of challenges (Sahin et al., 2015). 
The intellectual aspect requires the ability to deal with information and to see the 
linkages and dependencies within the system. This leads to planning and evalua‑
tion of alternative decisions and likely outcomes. There’s also an element of self‑ 
reflection, which indicates an appetite for personal continual improvement.
The final foundational skill is action‑orientation. Importantly, this has two 
 dimensions – task‑related and people‑related. The former fits traditional understand‑
ings of competent management including attention to detail and to timeframes. 
People‑related competencies are described as involving the ability to establish 
empathic, non‑directive, supportive and trusting relationships (Sahin et  al., 2015). 
This relates well to the prevention of HR entropic risk through managers’ and supervi‑
sors’ support of workers in their engagement with the work, as described in Chapter 8.
In Figure 9.4, there are some clear expectations about the return on investment of 
developing this capacity. This includes the outcomes listed on the right‑hand side of 
the figure starting with improved review of systems of production. The Entropy Model 
identified the need to clearly understand the sources of residual and entropic risk of 
systems of production that can lead to losses and potentially catastrophic events. 
With better review comes improved risk and opportunity‑based problem‑solving and 
decision‑making, which was a key theme of Chapter 8. As the organisation matures, 
leadership capability should be enhanced at all levels – top‑down and bottom‑up. 
This includes greater participation and responsibility of Risk Champions in the work‑
place, particularly with frontline supervisors and workers contributing directly to loss 
prevention verification processes. As an example described earlier, each workplace 
should have champions for emergency response supporting the centralised assurance 
programme that takes operational data and presents it to senior management. The 
executive, in turn, should ensure required resources are provided for any corrective 
actions and cost‑benefit driven, risk‑ and opportunity‑based improvements.
The traditional role of managers has included clarifying roles and accountabili‑
ties. This is particularly important in risk management. OSH has touchpoints with 
many if not all areas of an organisation but that doesn’t mean that the OSH function 
is accountable for safety performance. They don’t control the resources for plant and 232 Productive Safety Management
equipment maintenance for instance, so can’t be held accountability for technologi‑
cal failures. They’re not in charge of the workforce so can only put systems in place 
for the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse such as testing regimes. Supervisors 
are the primary detection agents outside of this testing regime. The risk owner is 
the ‘person or entity with the accountability and authority to manage a risk’ (ISO, 
2024). Unclear lines can create conflict which is wasteful and contrary to the traits 
of resourceful organisations.
The final expected outcome is a positive impact on the organisational culture. 
Cautiously, the label, ‘risk and opportunity culture’ is proposed, and this is a signifi‑
cant subset of the broader enterprise culture. In the same way that ‘safety culture’ and 
‘safety leadership’ (discipline‑based classifications) have been questioned throughout 
this book, another boundary should be avoided in favour of a clear understanding that 
that organisation’s primary mindset operationally should be to prevent losses and exploit 
opportunities through safe, efficient, quality work that delivers on stakeholder needs.
In the next and final chapter, the discussions about capacity will continue. The 
principles of HROs will be explored to tie all contents of this edition together and to 
look at a way forward for organisations based on these principles.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, the dialogue about leadership that opened in Chapter 8 was contin‑
ued. The different choices that people make in the presence of risk were described 
using the Risk Behaviour Model. There were two opposites presented which were 
risk‑taking versus risk‑managing. These involved decision‑making processes that 
result in what the individual considers an acceptable behaviour. This was largely 
influenced by the culture of the workplace and the outcomes. There are expectations 
that the chosen behaviour will lead to a positive pay‑off and the avoidance of conse‑
quences. These behaviours perpetuate the culture and vice versa so both aspects need 
to be addressed to shift to a mature, risk‑ and opportunity‑driven enterprise.
More broadly, businesses can fall into categories which were referred to as 
‘The Good’, ‘The Bad’ and ‘The Simply Irresponsible’. Different strategies need 
to be applied depending on the level of maturity of the enterprise and its senior 
personnel. Owners, executives and top managers who have a high‑risk appe‑
tite, a production‑centric mindset and short‑time horizons are difficult to shift. 
Unfortunately, these can be destined for learning the hard way from incidents, inju‑
ries and losses. Some regard flouting the rules (not just in OSH) as a challenge. Those 
associated with such businesses like in‑house risk advisors and contractors should 
seriously consider whether they can accept their risk exposure to such clients.
In contrast, many organisations have defined their values. These were discussed 
in the context of influencing personnel to develop an internal dialogue that prompts 
the question, ‘Is it worth the risk?’ In the depths behind such a question are personal 
mores about the sanctity of life, quality of life, financial security as the capacity to 
sustain earnings over the longer term, and social acceptance within the organisa‑
tion’s culture. Unfortunately, conversations about these values are seldom held and 
so personnel don’t get the opportunity to consider how these fit with their own beliefs 
or how they align with their employer’s culture. These core values can be put into Operational Capacity 233
practice through consultative and participative activities led by the supervisor. During 
onboarding and management of change, there need to be discussions between super‑
visors and workers that keep team members engaged. Communications shouldn’t be 
limited to technical and social matters. Lack of engagement can cause HR entropic 
risks to rise due to the risk of cultural degradation. The end‑goal should be that the 
enterprise builds depth of capability, with personnel practising risk management as a 
life skill (not just doing traditional systems‑driven OSH tasks).
Throughout this book, there have been regular discussions highlighting that 
organisations should properly resource operations to prevent fatalities, serious inju‑
ries, and debilitating illnesses. These are the life‑changing outcomes of poor opera‑
tional risk management. That so much effort is put into first aid cases is perplexing, 
especially given that Heinrich’s Triangle has been seriously questioned. There’s no 
correlation between first aid cases and fatalities. As explained by the Entropy Model, 
high levels of residual risk and/or entropic risk affect the probability of injuries and 
other serious losses. This points to residual risk management and entropic risk pre‑
vention as the critical strategies for preservation of life and protection of workers’ 
quality of life long‑term. These critical control verification programmes don’t need to 
be onerous if the workload is shared using a decentralised implementation strategy.
The final part of this chapter explained the Capacity Development Process in 
Figure  9.4. There were numerous inputs recommended to build organisational 
capacity starting with an effective recruitment and selection process, and subse‑
quent developmental programmes. These centred on leadership, competencies and 
the management system with the view to developing a resilient and resourceful 
organisation. Both enterprise traits are required. The first is to ensure the organisa‑
tion can adapt to crises and threats whilst the other is a combination of leadership 
traits that improve job performance. This includes enabling continual improvement 
and optimising systems of production under controllable, normal risk conditions. 
Resourcefulness integrates both management and leadership skills that are affective, 
intellectual and action oriented.
There are numerous expected outputs of organisational capacity, and these influ‑
ence the enterprise’s ability to manage risks and exploit opportunities. The remaining 
missing piece is to draw lessons learned from successful organisations. In Chapter 10, 
this concept of capacity building will be explored through the principles of HROs. It’s 
proposed that many organisations and particularly those that are at high risk can learn 
from HRO’s key success factors, as well as from those organisations that considered 
themselves to be highly reliable but failed miserably as evident by catastrophic events.

Organisations (HROs)
INDUSTRY GAPS IN RISK MANAGEMENT
As discussed throughout this book, modern organisations are characterised by 
complexity and uncertainty. They’re under constant pressure from stakeholders 
to demonstrate safety, reliability, productivity and increasing value. They operate 
in dynamic environments where there’s a permanent influx of new and sometimes 
unanticipated risks due to sociological, technological, organisational, and environ‑
mental changes. These external governing and influencing forces were shown in 
Figure 2.3, the Strategic Alignment Channel. Business entities can become suscep‑
tible to unwanted events due to lack of horizon scanning, inadequate risk manage‑
ment, flawed decision‑making and deficient processes for managing both known 
and unknown risks.
In this chapter, much of the discussion will be consolidated with further thought 
given to what can be learned from successful HROs and those organisations that con‑
sidered themselves to be high reliability but failed miserably as evident by significant 
disasters. Several solutions have been proposed in previous chapters including the 
need for a more mature perspective on the nature of risk. The current understanding 
and categorisation of risk tends to be static rather than dynamic resulting in insuf‑
ficient capacity to understand and prepare for uncertainty within a complex and con‑
stantly changing environment. Risk is more than a singular concept. It’s the potential 
for loss, harm or negative consequences resulting from uncertain circumstances or 
actions. There’s ambiguity both in the event and the associated consequences, with 
variability depending on the information and knowledge available. The Society for 
Risk Analysis argues that it’s not realistic to limit the understanding of risk to tradi‑
tional concepts and has developed a new glossary to allow for different constructs, 
definitions and measurements of risk (Society of Risk Analysis, 2018).
Uncertainties in risk assessments arise from incomplete information, limited 
data, assumptions and inherent variability in complex systems. This is confounded 
by unforeseen events which present a challenge for OSH and operations managers 
as well as strategists. The occurrence of an unpredictable event can cause highly 
adverse consequences as found out when COVID‑19 arrived and evolved. In Chapter 
1, the term ‘black swan’ was introduced. This refers to unpredictable and unforeseen 
events that are rare and have a significant impact on society, organisations, or indi‑
viduals. These were identified as unknown unknowns. Along with known‑unknowns, 
unknown knowns, and known knowns, there’s been an attempt to break risks down 
based on available data.

There are also gaps in risk‑based decision‑making processes. Common meth‑
ods include Cost‑Benefit Analysis, Risk Acceptance Criteria, Cautionary and 
Precautionary Principle, and the ALARP principle. These help to justify decisions 
but don’t resolve the dilemmas inherent in organisational decision‑making. This 
was highlighted in the discussions about the Alignment Fallacy and the ALARP 
Assumption. Because the above practices are well‑established and accepted, little 
has been done to challenge the gaps in society’s understanding of risk and enterprise 
practice. One area of difficulty that was raised was the quandary that engineers face 
during the project development phase. This affects the levels of residual risk that an 
operation inherits from the design, construction, and commissioning phases. Such 
levels may also affect the rates of degradation of technologies and infrastructure 
over the life of the facility or site. These present ethical challenges for engineers 
with the outcomes primarily being determined by economic factors, particularly, the 
ability to attract project investment capital. Competition for investment incentivises 
shortcuts in design to reduce the total outgoing cost presented to financial markets.
Several major disasters were reviewed in previous chapters. Many of these high‑
lighted the ethical decision‑making tensions within engineering design and construc‑
tion. Flawed decisions were major contributing factors to systems and technology 
disasters. Such deficiencies may occur in various stages of the project/facilities life‑
cycle. Some key factors are negligence in engineering design in the name of mini‑
mising costs and adhering to a delivery schedule; complex interactions and tensions 
between engineering and managerial decision‑making; and the influence of external 
organisational and socio‑political factors (Van de Poel & Royakkers, 2011).
Major disasters have uncovered evidence of these dilemmas. The system failures 
resulting in the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters were largely due 
to the focus on technology, lack of consideration of the social and political system 
within NASA, and inattentiveness to the consequences of organisational structure 
and policies on human behaviour and safety (Vaughan, 1996; CAIB, 2003: Chap. 8). 
The Rogers Commission Report into the Challenger Disaster also identified “flawed 
decision making” as a contributing cause of the accident. Production and schedule 
pressures, and violation of internal rules and procedures to launch on time were also 
significant (Rogers et al., 1986).
The disasters that occurred to the Challenger and Columbia space shuttles 
are ironic in the sense that NASA was considered a high‑reliability 
organisation. This highlights the vulnerability of enterprises to decay 
especially under high pressure conditions.
Vaughan (1996) characterises the Challenger launch decision as a case of ‘organisa‑
tional deviance’ – values and norms that were seen as unethical outside the organisa‑
tion, were seen within as normal and legitimate. Faulty decision‑making was a common 
factor in both accidents; however, the decision‑makers saw their actions as rational. 
Enhancing the cultural and organisational environments and appropriate tools were 
needed to improve decision‑making under conditions of uncertainty (Leveson, 2011).
Disasters provide valuable lessons for engineers, regulators, professional societ‑
ies and educators concerning the ethical responsibilities of their professions. These Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 237
disciplines have reached the conclusion that there must be a better approach than 
continuing to learn the hard way. The same applies to operations. Readily available 
lessons learned abound. In another example, one year after the Hyatt Regency Hotel 
was completed in Kansas City, Missouri, two walkways suspended over the atrium 
lobby collapsed in July 1981. More than 200 were injured and 114 people were killed. 
During the construction stage, the decision was made to attach the set of rods sup‑
porting the second‑floor walkway to the bottom of the fourth instead of the ceiling. 
That meant the rods attached to the fourth‑floor walkway were supporting twice the 
weight than the original design intended. The design change was not analysed and 
approved.
Engineers need to be cognisant of their ethical and professional responsibility 
(Whitbeck, 2011) but that goes for everyone who makes decisions that affect residual 
risk levels in the design phase and later when modifications are undertaken on site. 
Blunders can occur at any time in a facilities’ lifecycle if complacency sets in or 
professional standards are compromised. It’s not just systems of production that are 
subject to degradation, organisational factors can also deteriorate leading to signifi‑
cant vulnerabilities in hard and soft components of the enterprise. These sources of 
risk have been key discussion points throughout previous chapters.
RISK MANAGEMENT IN HROS
Disasters and failure tend to dominate the headlines, research studies, and indeed, 
have received a lot of attention in this edition of PSM. There’s much to be learned 
from successful business entities but unfortunately, successes are shared less than 
failures, and that also tends to be the case in operations.
As explained in Chapter 4 on technology, HROs achieve nearly error‑free opera‑
tions over long time periods and maintain high levels of safety whilst operating in 
complex, uncertain, high‑risk and hazardous environments (Roberts, 1990). They 
have the capacity to anticipate and prevent undesirable and unexpected events by 
focusing on the proactive mitigation of risk rather than on responding to errors after 
these occur. If an unanticipated event occurs, it has the capability to firstly, cope 
with and contain errors from intensifying and secondly, restoring system functioning 
(Weick et al., 1999; Weick and Sutcliffe, 2007).
A concept of ‘collective mindfulness’ is developed giving HROs the capacity to 
anticipate and contain the unexpected (Weick et al., 1999). There are five principles 
from effective HROs:
1. Preoccupation with Failure
2. Reluctance to Simplify
3. Sensitivity to Operations
4. Commitment to Resilience
5. Deference to Expertise
The first three principles cover capacity to anticipate and prevent unexpected events 
whilst the last two are about resilience and containment as a response to threats or 
crises. The five processes combine to provide a risk‑based mindset with processes 238 Productive Safety Management
that are stable and continuously focused to detect the variable patterns of production, 
activity and response. Early detection enables mitigation of risks of new, unexpected 
events by coping with unintended consequences (Weick et  al., 1999). This aligns 
with the application of Shannon’s Entropy Approach discussed in Chapter 4 about 
technology. The system is looking for variances not consistencies. The smaller the 
entropy value the less disorder in the process or systems. In this approach, there 
doesn’t appear to be any judgement about whether the deviance from the expected is 
a good thing or a bad thing. It just is and draws attention and enquiry.
The fundamental framework of safety should be rethought away from 
failure at a significant level to also consider day‑to‑day incremental losses 
that constitute waste. There may be deviances that can be identified from 
a mathematical approach to risk and the use of big data or simply, better 
ways of communicating about the work.
From a safety and efficiency perspective, these wastes can have a cumulative impact.
Major accidents are often preceded by anomalies – things that are not right, but which 
have no obvious explanation and, apparently, no undesirable consequence. Too often, 
anomalies are ignored, until it is too late. One of the vital features of a bad news reporting 
system is that it can highlight anomalies and ensure that they are responded to in time.
(Hopkins, 2021)
There are two aspects to consider. The first is to stick with what achieves results in 
terms of risk management. For instance, there are known knowns about what can 
cause fatalities, for instance, on a construction site, and many of the controls such 
as ‘golden rules’ (don’t walk under a suspended load) and barriers with procedural 
controls such as separation of vehicles and pedestrians, are accepted and effective. 
These should be implemented by every organisation that has these fatal risks as part 
of its operational risk profile. These controls are legislative and moral obligations.
The second aspect worth considering is greater enquiry into variances that lead to 
waste. Operationally, waste may include inefficiencies, compromises made because 
what was needed for the job wasn’t available, gaps in communication, gaps in plan‑
ning, rework and well‑intended efforts directed at the wrong outcomes. One way of 
identifying waste is to ask managers, supervisors and workers what causes frustra‑
tion in the execution of their work. This will likely inform decision‑makers of what’s 
occurring on the rising entropic risk curve, bearing in mind that waste can appear 
minor but from a systems perspective may be significant.
Waste is an increment of loss.
Waste that’s occurring on a rising entropic risk curve can’t be recouped.
Time can’t be turned back and lost safe production can’t be recovered by 
pushing systems to catch up without introducing more risk.Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 239
Waste prevention is a focal point of the Lean approach to continual improvement. 
Lean can involve complex process mapping to identify deficiencies along the produc‑
tion line; however, in practice, these analytics aren’t necessary in under‑resourced 
businesses when waste is often readily identified by supervisors and workers. Internal 
knowledge is under‑exploited in many organisations.
The literature to date that discusses HRO principles highlights their preoccu‑
pation with failure. Organisations need to do more than prevent catastrophe. They 
need to understand operation’s prevailing attitude as a starting point. In ‘The Simply 
Irresponsible’ enterprise, management will believe failure doesn’t exist. ‘The Bad’ 
organisation in need of significant transformation will at least have managers who 
from time to time feel uneasy, and this becomes an avenue that the competent risk pro‑
fessional can explore (without exploitation or fearmongering). HROs are engrossed 
in actively seeking anomalies, signs of error, small losses and near misses within 
systems and consider these symptoms of potential system‑wide failures.
The culture of HROs encourages workers to report and discuss errors collectively. 
Near misses aren’t treated as evidence of safety rather considered signs of potential 
failure. Possible vulnerabilities in the system which led to this situation are analysed. 
In current organisations, wastes are easily overlooked. For instance, a ‘broken’ pro‑
curement system (evident as lack of spares and essential consumables) won’t neces‑
sarily lead to safety incidents but it will cause inefficiencies, shortcuts, and other 
deviations from safe, efficient work practices. These are the types of issues that tend 
to be tolerated rather than reported because there’s no glaringly obvious loss. There 
may, however, be a current of day‑to‑day frustration amongst operational personnel.
Hopkins (2021) in “A Practical Guide to Becoming a ‘High Reliability 
Organisation’” talks about encouraging bad news reporting and setting up a system 
to capture and process this information. From operational experience, unfortunately, 
this may perpetuate characteristics of the OSH and risk‑related professions that cre‑
ate a stigma of negativity. A better approach is to report recommended corrective 
actions, thus aligning reporting systems to the Entropy Model. The Hopkins guide is 
worth reading and several principles are described:
Principle 1: the reporting technology must be as user friendly as possible
Principle 2: Reports should be routed automatically to particular people
Principle 3: All reports should be individually responded to
Principle 4: Encourage ‘helpful’ reports
Principle 5: Use local circumstances to steer the system, but not too prescriptively
Principle 6: Encourage courageous reporting
Principle 7: Contractors working on site must be encouraged to participate in the client 
company’s reporting system
Principle 8: There should be no reporting targets
Principle 9: A bad news reporting system depends on top organisational commitment
Principle 10: Governments should guarantee that bad news reporting systems will not 
increase the risk of prosecution
(Hopkins, 2021)
In terms of practical implementation, many companies already have reporting 
apps available via mobile phones, tablets and computers, so the development and 240 Productive Safety Management
implementation of such a tool need not be onerous. Essentially, this requires a mul‑
tidisciplinary approach and user testing. From experience, there can be pushback 
from some members of the workforce however, most workers are now technologi‑
cally savvy enough to complete a simple reporting form. For those who say they need 
more training, a simple response is to ask them how much training they received 
to do their online banking or shopping on their mobile phone. Resistance doesn’t 
equal incompetence. The tactical risk professional will enlist operational champions 
to support the introduction of changes to the reporting system, and not surprisingly, 
suggestions that are listened to and implemented, will create an appetite for fixing 
day‑to‑day issues and inefficiencies. This is a good starting point for building the 
right culture – based on honesty and openness.
In the big picture, HROs are wary of periods of successful operations without any 
occurrence of errors or breakdowns. This is where OSH performance KPIs such as 
noticeboards with the number of days since a lost time injury are non‑aligned with 
a risk‑based culture. These create a false sense of success that may camouflage the 
devious tactics used to achieve such outcomes, such as assigning injured workers to 
administration tasks instead of recording a lost time injury.
The period of good performance was illustrated in the Entropy Model as the opti‑
misation phase (Figure 1.4), which can be followed by degradation when corrective 
action and maintenance practices aren’t sustained (Figure 1.5). As the entropic risk 
again rises, losses will occur and if left unchecked, will result in an inevitable signifi‑
cant loss. This may be a major safety incident or other catastrophe with severe impact 
on the organisation’s capacity to deliver required results, such as the failure of critical 
production equipment or a force majeure event. It’s therefore important that KPIs are 
truthful and not create a false sense of security or assurance.
Success can induce over‑confidence in the adequacy of current practices 
and lead workers to drift into complacency and expectation of future 
repeatable successes. These attitudes and behaviours can increase the 
likelihood of unexpected events being undetected.
Special attention should be paid to the possibility of potential failures with the 
assumption that any current success makes future success less probable. While this 
may sound like paranoia, it should be remembered that these HROs are entities char‑
acterised by high risks and potential uncertainties. A sound understanding of the risk 
profile of such an operation warrants a pre‑occupation with failure. In earlier chap‑
ters, the risks that facilities inherent from the initial phases of the facilities’ lifecycle, 
specifically, design, construction, and commissioning were discussed. Operation’s 
residual risk profile and tendency towards entropic risk is significantly influenced by 
project cost decisions. The scenario of minimal project cost and greater risk accep‑
tance is shown in Figure 10.1. There’s a high level of residual risk in the operational 
phase due to deficiencies in HSE in design in earlier phases. The implications are that 
steps 3 and 4 in the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy become highly important. 
There needs to be an extreme wariness of residual risks and potential entropic risks 
to prevent wasteful losses and vulnerability to catastrophe. It’s also imperative that Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 241
the operation reduce residual risk over time through technological improvements and 
capital investments.
Some projects are delivered on a lower total outgoing cost for strategic 
reasons. These include higher likelihood of attracting capital investment. 
There may be an intention to generate production revenues as quickly as 
possible to pay down debts and generate cashflow. These decisions aren’t 
wrong per se; however, the company should be aware that operational 
risks aren’t at ALARP.
Steps 3 and 4 are critical in preventing failures and closing the gaps to where the level 
of residual risk should have been with a stronger HSE in design basis. The danger 
is that once production is well underway and revenues are streaming in, there may 
be limited incentive to make engineering changes that cause disruption to opera‑
tions, especially, if these have primarily been justified from an OSH perspective. 
There may be greater motivation if efficiency can also be improved through such 
investment.
The second scenario shows an optimal project cost decision with a sound HSE 
basis for design. The residual risk is lower and due to quality componentry and stan‑
dards throughout the design, construction and commission phases, the tendency 
towards degradation has a longer lead time. Operations have a lower residual risk 
level than in the previous scenario. Rather than extreme wariness, facility manag‑
ers can maintain chronic wariness of the site’s risk profile. There’s less pressure to 
invest in capital improvements in the earlier years of the operation compared to the 
organisation in Figure 10.2.

FIGURE 10.1 A minimal project cost decision and higher residual risk for Project A 242 Productive Safety Management
One of the significant gaps in current risk management practices is that when a site 
or facility goes into the operational phase, the focus tends to only be on day‑to‑day 
risks rather than original deficiencies in design. For instance, during shutdown main‑
tenance of a major hazard facility, decisions will be made to adapt to what is rather 
than asking how infrastructure and plant should be. As a result, scaffolding may be 
installed to give maintenance crews access to areas that require upkeep, whereas 
there should have been ladders, platforms and walkways constructed during the build 
if the company had been committed to ALARP. An assumption may be made for the 
purpose of keeping construction costs down that operations will bear these capital 
expenses.
The organisation intending to adopt HRO principles including preoccupation with 
failure should literally go back to the drawing board. Much has been written about 
Prevention through Design (PtD) in practice for the construction industry. There are 
gaps that Gambatese et al. (2017) identified. Concerningly, these include deficien‑
cies in project designers’ focus on the safety of construction workers and minimisa‑
tion of compliance to legislation such as Construction (Design and Management) 
Regulations (UK). The commentary should leave construction and operations man‑
agers with a sense of unease.
• Much of the focus remains on end‑user safety, not construction worker OSH.
• The true benefit comes from working together and communicating; the CDM 
Regulations were simply the catalyst to enhance project team member com‑
munication and integration that ultimately lead to improved safety.
• Changing designer culture in a way that respectfully engages designers 
recognizes that the burden should not solely be placed on the designer and 
design culture; placing blame in such a way is not beneficial to the industry 
and to worker OSH.
• There remains an unclear extent of responsibility for mitigating OSH risks in 
the design (i.e., how far should a designer go to design out hazards).

• There is an unclear understanding of, and lack of confidence in, the ability 
for designers to positively impact construction safety as part of their design 
role.
• It is common to have a misdirected focus on meeting the CDM Regulations 
instead of implementing PtD.
• The PtD message needs to be expanded beyond the main project team 
members.
(Gambatese et al., 2017)
If designers have identified these professional gaps, it begs the question, what risks 
are operations inheriting?
What residual risks and vulnerabilities to entropic risk are current 
operations managers and their teams exposed to which should be known 
knowns but may be unknown unknowns due to lack of deep interrogation 
of the site’s risk profile?
Interestingly, the researchers refer to ‘changing designer culture’ which flags a fur‑
ther segmentation of culture by discipline rather than all stakeholders who determine 
the total risk profile of an operation having a risk‑ and opportunity‑driven mindset 
and way of delivering their work.
The preoccupation with failure is likely to lead organisations to adopt a precau‑
tionary approach. This means firstly, understanding their residual risk profile and 
HSE in design deficiencies as described above. Secondly, there should be a constant 
wariness and need for information about the state of degradation of systems of pro‑
duction. Effectively, the trend should be towards early intervention. This is shown 
in Figure 10.3 which sees corrective actions brought forward (shown by the solid

arrow pointing to the left of the timeline) when the enterprise’s risk owners become 
informed of rising entropic risk within their operations. (The figure builds on figure 
4.1 presented in Chapter 4.)
The impact is that systems aren’t allowed to degrade as far as otherwise may 
occur which reduces the accepted level of entropic risk to the level shown at Z. 
Proactive maintenance practices also commence earlier at Z implying with the fine 
dashed upward line that upgrades are according to defined tolerances. Optimisation 
is more sophisticated based on data and adjustments may be made according to 
agreed parameters.
Many organisations that consider themselves to be HRO may be doing this without 
the visualisation of risk management shown by the Entropy Model. For less resourced 
enterprises however, there are some important lessons because in day‑to‑day decision 
making, it can be easy to delay fixing safety, maintenance, competence, and infor‑
mation issues which appear to be incremental. It’s unlikely that any single manager 
can confidently assess the cumulative impact of these iterative increases in risk, so 
it becomes critical that collectively, there’s a mindset of unease. This was referred to 
earlier as ‘collective mindfulness’. At the most rudimentary level, this preoccupation 
with failure (and loss) represents a strong desire to build reliability into the system in 
terms of delivering safe production to quality requirements.
As mentioned earlier, HROs work to five principles. The second is that these 
organisations are reluctant to oversimply when interpreting complex situations. This 
can lead to a false sense of understanding that limits the precautions people take and 
the various undesired outcomes they can perceive. HROs are aware that to effec‑
tively understand the complex environment, they need to build a multifaceted mental 
model. The discussions about the Entropy Model highlighted the dynamic nature of 
risk and that current risk registers are at best, a snapshot in time but more often, a 
list of hazards or work activities. These don’t capture the intricacies at the interfaces 
between systems of production. The use of risk matrices is limited in this regard.
In Chapter 7, the complexity of risk was unpacked by proposing a ‘Total Risk 
Profile’ of the organisation as shown by these formulas:
Total Residual Risk Score = Prr × Trr × PErr × HRrr
Total Entropic Risk Score = Per × Ter × PEer × HRer
Total risk profile = Total residual risks + Total entropic risks
This means that combinations of actual task scenarios can be innumerable; how‑
ever, attention should be given to catastrophic through to high risks as a priority. As 
explained previously, multiplication was used (rather than addition) to suggest that a 
single factor can have a significant impact for an activity. For instance, if the residual 
risk of technology is high due to lack of safety in design, this can have a major impact 
on the consequence of an event. Plant built without working at heights addressed dur‑
ing design will expose maintenance workers to a much higher residual risk than if 
safe, solid access has been installed. From a HR perspective, if the competency level 
of the workforce is low, this can significantly add to the risk and warrant targeted 
risk management strategies such as higher levels of supervision. If the HR entropic Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 245
risk is high due to workload and serious fatigue, this will affect productivity, safety 
and the quality of the work performed. Mobile and fixed plant that regularly breaks 
down (i.e. high entropic risk levels), will have a negative impact on production, safety 
and quality. These trends should be ‘red flags’ for management’s attention. By rec‑
ognising this complexity, managers may use data to better inform risk mitigation 
strategies.
The organisation that accepts the complexity caused by the multiple interfaces 
between systems of production will be reluctant to simplify. This could involve 
seriously reconsidering the use of a single risk matrix for high‑risk processes 
where these interfaces occur. Amidst these complications, there’s an overarching 
Multidisciplinary Principal Risk and Opportunity Management Strategy.
The objective should be to move all systems of production to higher levels 
of reliability in terms of delivering safe, efficient, quality work, whilst 
respecting and being wary of the complexity of the interfaces 
between these systems.
HROs aim to build capacity and this happens in practical terms by encouraging diver‑
sity of perspectives from individuals with different expertise. Better analysis occurs 
when various aspects of the same event result in a richer and more wide‑ranging 
picture, opening the variety of decision‑making options available to address a par‑
ticular problem. (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2015). By embracing complexity and diversity, 
HROs are better equipped to navigate and respond effectively to changing demands. 
A fundamental practice is to apply a multidisciplinary approach to risk management.
From the outset in this edition, the focus has regularly returned to operations 
which is where the risks ‘live’. HROs, as their third principle, are sensitive to 
operations and maintain a comprehensive understanding of current conditions and 
mechanics of the system. This is achieved by creating an integrated big picture from 
continual observations of real‑time status (Weick et al., 1999). This allows HROs to 
comprehend dynamics and pay attention to small deviations or interruptions. These 
traits provide an interesting reminder about the technological developments associ‑
ated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution and how big data is assisting enterprises 
to better understand and manage their risks. Small deviations are also fodder for 
mathematical applications such as Shannon’s Entropy Approach as described earlier. 
This looks for deviations rather than traditional statistical analysis of what happens 
most of the time. It’s what’s different or these subtle variations that should attract 
management’s attention, whilst ensuring that robust critical controls are maintained 
for known‑known, high consequence risks.
HROs are enabled to manage risk effectively by using information systems that 
collect live data or at least, data with relatively short lag times, to facilitate responsive 
managerial decision‑making. There should be a gnawing curiosity for what is hap‑
pening operationally – both what is going well to control risk and what isn’t going 
well where iterative losses may be occurring.
The Entropy Model with its Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy provides enti‑
ties with the habits to sustain operational discipline. This in combination with moni‑
toring regimes should enhance sensitivity to operations to prevent significant losses. 246 Productive Safety Management
In addition, the Hyatt case highlighted how safety in design can be compromised. 
This should also be a major consideration during operations in relation to modifica‑
tions to existing infrastructure and/or plant and expansions with interfaces between 
old and new. The critical questions are, ‘How has this changed the residual risk of 
the operations?’ and ‘What impact will these changes have on potential entropic risk 
levels?’.
The final point to consider from an operational perspective is the feedback loop 
to inform the executive if external or hierarchical internal forces are cascading to 
the extent that operational discipline is being compromised. In the major disasters 
described earlier, many root causes were organisational, not just operational. Flawed 
decision‑making was pervasive which indicates the need to have criteria on which to 
base decisions strategically and operationally. The Reasonableness Test driven by the 
organisation’s Risk Ethos was proposed to address this gap in current business prac‑
tice. Head office senior management should also seek authentic feedback from opera‑
tions regarding the practicality and challenges of implementing top‑down enterprise 
strategies, especially if operations are feeling the pressure of change fatigue.
Commitment to resilience is the fourth principle adopted by HROs. This ties in 
with the Capacity Development Process presented in Chapter 8. Resilience is “the 
intrinsic ability of an organisation (system) to maintain or regain a dynamically sta‑
ble state, which allows it to continue operations after a major mishap and/or in the 
presence of a continuous stress” (Hollnagel, 2006). Effective HROs develop capa‑
bilities through training and learning that combine knowledge and actions already in 
their repertoire when dealing with unexpected events. This enhances their range of 
perception and ability to respond to new threats. Individuals with diverse experience 
self‑organise into ad hoc networks to cope with unexpected events during rapidly 
developing contingencies (Weick et al., 1999).
There are several obstacles for organisations to achieve HRO status. The categori‑
sation by Aven (2017) of the singular concept of risk remains the basis of ALARP (or 
SFAIRP) and the fundamental risk process of identification, assessment and control 
of risk. Unfortunately, operationally after an incident, the tendency in many busi‑
nesses is to add lower order administration controls to minimise the costs of preven‑
tion. The question is whether this is enabling the business to be more resilient or is a 
hindrance adding increasing reliance on human performance, which is known to be 
fallible. The other consideration is that additional controls post‑incident shouldn’t be 
viewed from only a safety perspective but also explored for improved productivity, 
quality and/or longer‑term cost reduction. The recommended approach, therefore, is 
to revert to higher order engineering controls that reduce residual risk. This is the 
intent of step 4 in the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy of the Entropy Model.
Realistically, the reliance on ALARP (which incorporates requisite variety of 
controls) is unlikely to change from an industry standards perspective. The prag‑
matic consideration therefore is not to just accept ALARP but to question whether 
the level of ALARP enables resilience. Logic would suggest that the higher the reli‑
ance on human performance for a high‑risk scenario, the more tenuous the actual 
management of operational risks.
‘Resourcefulness’ should be partnered with ‘Resilience’ as discussed in Chapter 
9. This is the expected overflow or benefit of building organisational capacity. Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 247
This was tied in with the Entropy Model and as a result, ‘resourcefulness’ is intended 
to lead to better systems review; improved problem‑solving and decision‑making; 
effective leadership at all levels; and systems of production raised towards optimal 
performance levels.
The final principle is that the organisation defers risk‑based decisions to expertise. 
This was explained briefly in Chapter 8 in terms of building organisational capac‑
ity. The decentralised delivery of fatal risk critical control monitoring programmes 
was provided as an operational example, but this principle is more than day‑to‑day 
bottom‑up strategy. It’s a trait that demonstrates a high level of managerial maturity 
and deep trust between senior management and operations. At the site level, it also 
means that the operational management team trust the expertise of those subject mat‑
ter experts in the technical group as well as those directly involved in core business 
delivery.
In a practical sense, deference to expertise involves adopting a multidisciplinary 
approach with a common focus on risk management. Hollnagel (2021) referred to 
the historic ‘fragmentation of foci’ and the resulting practice of each issue being 
addressed in isolation without considering the interdependencies. This fragmenta‑
tion, evident as discipline silos, becomes particularly problematic with the need to 
manage change.
Concerns about fragmentation should be raised in the context of needed 
change especially to improve performance. Hollnagel (2021) talks about 
compensating for degradation due to ever‑increasing entropy and the need 
to recover from disruption.
The Entropy Model promotes deference to expertise according to risk (and opportu‑
nity) and collaborative planning and management of complex, inter‑related systems. 
This was described in PSM1 and this edition as the basis of a strategic, multi‑ 
disciplinary management system for hazardous industries that ties safety and produc‑
tion together. The principles can apply to all organisations with a sustained concern 
for the prevention of fatalities, serious injuries and debilitating illnesses, as well as 
other business losses.
More broadly, organisations seeking to improve their management of risk need to 
shift away from relying purely on traditional OSH management practices for injury 
prevention. Within the professional, a more mature perspective is needed that con‑
siders systems as complex organisms undergoing dynamic change due to external 
and internal factors. This doesn’t mean however, that traditional methods should be 
totally disregarded. These may well be enough for low‑risk environments with steady 
state processes. Numerous disasters in high‑risk workplaces, however, point to the 
need for transformation.
The discussions above call for operational risk reviews more often given the 
dynamic nature of risk, with the active participation of risk owners from various 
departments, and with a focus on operational challenges and opportunities. The role 
of the OSH professional in this context is to facilitate consultation to establish a 
deep familiarity with the total risk profile including interdependencies. The second 
type of review is for the purpose of management of change to evaluate operational 248 Productive Safety Management
adaptability and readiness. The final type of planned assessment should be to review 
metrics related to the Four‑Step Risk Management Strategies of corrective action, 
maintenance practices, residual risk management and residual risk reduction. Key 
questions are: “Has the organisation sustained the agreed standard of operational 
discipline to ensure risk is being managed effectively? Could the organisation be 
heading towards failure?” What incremental losses are occurring and can these be 
rectified and if not, what’s the risk?
The final section of this chapter captures some of the key themes and strate‑
gies discussed throughout this edition that encourage organisations to reframe their 
way of working towards a risk‑based approach. This means breaking down barriers 
between silos and defining the common ground. The proposed ten strategies for high 
reliability consider the risks within systems of production and organisational fac‑
tors which collectively, make up a Multidisciplinary Principal Risk and Opportunity 
Strategy. There are likely more elements that can be drawn from the previous chap‑
ters and added to this overarching approach. Each enterprise may consider its unique 
circumstances, capacity and risk/opportunity profile when devising their path to high 
reliability. In PSM1, latter chapters were dedicated to putting together a strategic 
plan, with various scorecards and setting KPIs for elements within the plan. Strategic 
planning resources are now readily available via the internet, so this area of general 
management won’t be covered in this edition.
TEN STRATEGIES ON THE PATH TO HIGH RELIABILITY
Throughout this edition, there has been a collective accumulation of strategies and 
practices to challenge current risk management approaches and propose practical 
alternatives. This section provides a summary of the key transformation opportuni‑
ties that have been covered in previous chapters. The issues discussed below include:

2. Honesty in organisational identity
3. Understanding and preventing entropic risk
4. Revisiting residual risk and ALARP
5. Understanding the deficiencies of current risk assessment practices
6. Loss investigation and organisational learning
7. Day‑to‑day operational risk management
8. Risk management as a life skill
9. Capacity through risk leadership and culture
10. The multi‑disciplinary approach to risk management
1 transformation of risk‑related professions and tHeir work
Risk‑related professions have come under the spotlight in this edition, with a call 
to make a transformation from ‘safety‑based thinking’ to ‘risk‑based thinking’. It’s 
imperative that the OSH discipline in particular addresses conflicts and identity 
issues by acquiring greater business acumen. Credibility is a high value commodity, 
especially in hazardous industries and without this, site safety personnel can struggle Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 249
to influence core business drivers and organisational risks such as production pres‑
sure. OSH professionals, having made the transformation themselves, should be 
influencing managers and supervisors to shift their mindset to risk‑based thinking 
focused on the reliability of systems of production.
Reliability involves safe production delivered to expectation 
quality standards.
The following is a practical example of how the OSH profession can better serve oper‑
ations. The Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is a workplace risk assessment tool that is man‑
dated where no safe work procedure exists for the task. There tends to be pushback 
or covert resistance to using this as it’s often seen as a burden and inefficiency, hold‑
ing personnel back from getting the job done. If however, operational personnel are 
invited to think about risk, the tool gets workers talking, planning, preparing and risk 
assessing for a safe, efficient, quality job with the right competencies, tools and com‑
munications done ahead of task execution. When these are used should be decided to 
achieve this outcome. It could, therefore, be called a ‘Good Job Plan’. The overarching 
aim should be to build reliability into the way work gets done to enable continuity of 
safe production. Naming such tools with a ‘safety’ adjective undervalues the process 
from an overarching risk management perspective. This naming practice also differ‑
entiates ‘safety work’ from ‘operational work’ thus perpetuating silos and perceptions 
that safety paperwork is a burden hindering the job from being done efficiently.
Organisations can adopt the principles of HROs to achieve business improvement. 
However, the bureaucratisation of safety and the culture of risk aversion is currently 
a disservice to the workforce and to progress. Many HSE management systems need 
an overhaul to ensure that risk mitigations are ‘needs’ not ‘wants’. For this to hap‑
pen, the OSH Profession should loosen their grip on risk aversion and ‘what‑if’ sto‑
ries told to justify outdated, redundant approaches to OSH management that border 
on scare tactics. Conversations need to shift towards what can be done as opposed 
to what can’t be done. Realistically, there are prescriptive parts to OSH legislation 
which are ‘must dos’, however, much is left to industry to self‑regulate based on the 
enterprise’s duty to workers to the extent that is ‘reasonably practicable’. There’s 
great scope for improving safety concurrently with efficiency if this is the approach 
taken to solving operational risk challenges. As Dekker (2014) points out, OSH man‑
agement systems should reflect work as done not as imagined. This applies more 
broadly to operational risk management systems that integrate OSH, environmental 
management, and quality assurance.
Organisations have been constrained by lack of innovation and critical think‑
ing. Work is dynamic not static. The focus needs to be on risk not simply haz‑
ards. Risk‑based management systems should be designed to ensure safe, effi cient, 
 quality‑driven work which concurrently protects operations from chaos and com‑
plexity. Such factors should be managed to minimise disruption to operations by 
the upper echelons of the organisation such as corporate functions. Support services 
professions should have two main customers – operations and head office.
On site, risk‑related professionals should adopt a 360° perspective of their work 
environment and understand their role to enable operations to work practically whilst 250 Productive Safety Management
also being the conduit that connects operations to the system, including delivering on 
governance reporting requirements for senior management. If corporate needs col‑
lated risk information for business analytics, then the relevant function (OSH, qual‑
ity, environment) should do this work rather than expecting operational managers 
to be masters of discipline‑driven systems. The frontline should be busy managing 
operational risks not satisfying the ‘system’.
Aspiring HROs should develop lines of accountability between core 
business and support service functions to clarify who are the risk owners 
and who are the assurance process owners.
These assurance processes include the internal auditing function and continuous 
improvement of support service systems and tools. They should also be the focal 
point for information dissemination, such as changes to legislation, industry news 
about new incidents from which the business may be able to get ‘free’ lessons 
learned, and other trends that improve risk management in the enterprise. The assur‑
ance process owners have a key role to play in meeting stakeholder requirements, 
such as regulators and clients. Finally, a large portion of the work should be in the 
field providing support and advice.
2 Honesty in organisational identity
The path to high reliability requires honesty and the demise of organisational silence. 
Issues that are currently ‘undiscussables’ should be openly scrutinised. Hopkins 
(2021) alludes to courageous reporting of bad news. From experience, some of the 
issues that should be reported as bad news include the rhetoric driven by idealistic 
philosophy that doesn’t sit well with operations. For instance, catchcries such as ‘Our 
people are our Greatest Asset’ are as superficial as ‘Safety First’ when tough deci‑
sions must be made about resourcing levels and production targets. Organisations 
should understand their human capital value to make well informed decisions that 
impact their HR residual and entropic risks. Likewise, there’s no such condition as 
‘zero’ risk. ‘Zero Harm’ is a fallacy as nil incidents and injuries is unattainable.
Debate about ‘Zero’, philosophically or statistically, is a distraction from 
controlling real risks that can have terrible consequences for people, 
businesses and communities.
Branding of safety has been particularly problematic. ‘Safety First’ is an ideal that 
can never consistently survive the operational reality of work. It’s tempting to shroud 
OSH performance expectations in these slogans that appear to uphold high moral val‑
ues, but the critical piece is whether personnel believe it in the context of their daily 
experiences. The truth is that ‘Safety First’ is a lie when workers have no control over 
the pace of production. An example was given of a food processing company that had 
a ‘Safety First’ policy and yet, when a worker was injured on the production line, col‑
leagues failed to assist the person and continued to keep up with the product moving Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 251
on the conveyor belt. The operation wasn’t shutdown. This alarming example high‑
lighted the depth of cultural issues within the enterprise that stemmed from lack of 
care and concern for workers openly expressed at senior management levels. It truly 
takes courage to report this bad news to the Board and it’s uncertain if ‘The Simply 
Irresponsible’ enterprise can change its ways without wholesale changes at the top.
Many organisations are trying to improve through integrated operational risk and 
OSH management systems. There can, however, be legacy issues in worker and man‑
agement relations during the transition phase. A gap is that too often it’s assumed 
by the workforce that senior managers know what the issues are and have failed to 
act; but management don’t always receive truthful reporting from the site level. High 
level managers simply can’t dedicate resources to problems they don’t know about or 
understand. The path to high reliability must involve enquiry into this feedback loop. 
Further, ‘The Work’ has always been what matters in operations, not safety branding, 
symbols, or paradigms. Operations need solutions and these must include both ‘hard’ 
tangibles and ‘soft’ less tangible strategies with genuine intent. Trust comes about 
more by listening and visible actions than branding, marketing or salespersonship.
It’s a necessity that businesses aiming to improve reliability of systems of pro‑
duction, balance potentially conflicting objectives such as production, quality, OSH 
performance and cost to ensure short‑term viability and longer‑term sustainability. 
The Alignment Fallacy explained some of the significant gaps that erode strategy as 
it cascades down the hierarchy. This includes the ‘Safety First’ message and whilst 
prevention of safety incidents remains paramount, there’s a broader concern that 
should take centre stage.
The key issue that management should be worried about is evidence 
of losses and whether they have control.
Production downtime, quality deficiencies and safety incidents are all losses con‑
nected by ineffective risk management. This is overlooked because the definition and 
approach to risk is singular not dynamic and complex.
Part of the honest leadership discussion should be to acknowledge gaps and 
opportunities for improvement in industry practice when it comes to the fundamen‑
tals of risk identification, assessment, control, and verification. A poignant example 
is the OSH profession’s long held reliance on Heinrich’s Triangle which predicted a 
statistical relationship between the number of first aid cases preceding a more serious 
injury event. For this reason, organisations have expended significant resources on 
preventing minor injuries. A rethink is required to get to a risk‑based approach. The 
continued occurrence of fatalities, serious injuries and debilitating illnesses indicates 
that site managers and supervisors need enhanced risk management competencies, 
better leadership support, coaching and decision‑making tools to achieve safe, effi‑
cient, quality work.
The other significant matter that prospective HROs need to address is regular 
sense‑checks on internal trends. Earlier discussions talked about how leadership and 
resilience can degrade. Numerous disasters have provided evidence of how organisa‑
tions can go through cycles of failing, mending, optimising and failing again. This 
calls for some form of devil’s advocacy at senior management levels to ensure that 252 Productive Safety Management
the organisation isn’t deteriorating, even though continued performance may suggest 
otherwise. The challenge may be that people believe what they want to believe. This 
can be reinforced by groupthink at any hierarchical level. Complacency can set in 
and then, as the Entropy Model indicates, significant loss can become inevitable.
3 understanding and preventing entropiC risk
PSM1 introduced the concept of entropic risk using the Entropy Model. This risk 
results from the degradation of systems of production. In organisations that have 
badly degraded systems, losses tend to affect many functions. From experience of 
‘The Simply Irresponsible’ enterprise, whilst safety‑related incidents were high so 
were personnel issues, environmental incidents, quality deficiencies, re‑work, absen‑
teeism and internal conflict. Across all disciplines, the evidence of ‘entropic risk’ 
was tangible and expensive. The lesson from this is that a series of serious safety inci‑
dents should raise senior management’s concerns that there is loss of operational con‑
trol more broadly across business deliverables not just safety. That’s because entropic 
risk is a collective state of sub‑standard systems quality that doesn’t just affect safety; 
it affects everything.
Entropic risk must be part of the language of any organisation aspiring 
towards higher levels of reliability. Current enterprises may be predisposed 
to failure simply because entropic risk prevention isn’t talked about.
This includes those organisations that considered themselves to be HROs, such as 
NASA and BP Refinery (Texas,) prior to the catastrophes that befell them.
Due to entropic risk, ALARP should be determined on higher order controls in the 
hierarchy of controls, being elimination, substitution, and engineering controls. Lower 
order controls of administration and PPE are vulnerable to variability and sub‑ optimal 
performance. Complacency results from the failure to acknowledge that entropic risk 
is real. The opportunity is to bring entropic risk into the enterprise language and strat‑
egy, and to provide managers, supervisors, and workers with practical examples to 
build understanding of why the quality of their work and decision‑making is critical to 
overall risk management. The focus should always be on ‘Good Work’ which is safe, 
efficient and set by clear expectations regarding the quality of the output.
The ALARP Assumption should be embraced by organisations aiming to prevent 
catastrophes and to reducing losses attributable to systemic decay, complexity, and 
chaos. Existing operations should view the current approach to ALARP with cynicism. 
Site management must live with design deficiencies that result from cost minimisa‑
tion during the design, construction, and commissioning phases of a facility’s life‑
cycle. In addition, as operations mature, there’s a tendency after incidents to add more 
low‑cost, lower‑order procedural controls that may increase the risk rather than reduce 
it. Expanding rules based on low value thoroughness as opposed to genuine risk reduc‑
tion may compromise efficiency and generate new risks such as production pressure.
The entropic risk prevention strategies of corrective action and maintenance 
practices shown by the Entropy Model, align to the HRO principle of preoccupation Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 253
with failure. Especially under pressure, an operating environment can slide towards 
degraded states through sub‑standard daily decisions. These include ignoring safety 
and maintenance issues, leaving the important detail out of risk communications 
between supervisors and workers, assuming that systems can cope with increasing 
production demands, and not paying attention to concerns raised by conscientious 
‘objectors’.
At the most fundamental level, there needs to be an acceptance that 
entropic risk is real, and no individual can fathom the extent of this within a 
complex, interdependent system.
The cautious aspiring HRO may start the process of articulating entropic risk and 
implementing entropic risk prevention strategies in a single work area before rolling 
it out to the wider site. Inspections, conversations, and internal reports may be used 
to identify weakly performing areas that can quickly benefit from an upgrade. An 
effective strategy is to conduct a ‘Listening Tour’ to engage with the area’s managers, 
supervisors and workers asking them about their greatest sources of frustration when 
trying to get work done. Fundamentally, this is a question about operational risks, to 
which there is often also a safety component. An example of this in action was given 
in Chapter 4 when a site visit was undertaken at a poultry farm, and it was found that 
rats regularly ate through electrical wiring causing risks to production. The capital 
investment required to fix the problem was readily attained from senior management 
because they recognised the problem from a core business perspective. Safety was 
improved significantly as a result.
Organisations aiming to improve reliability can start with operational risks that 
affect core business rather than focusing solely on safety, environment, or quality, 
after prescriptive compliances have been addressed. These functions shouldn’t be 
seen as separate but part of the whole which characterises good performance. Often 
the real risks that operations face day‑to‑day that affect efficiency will draw capital 
investment from senior management’s coffers and strategically, the additional costs 
of HSE in design may be marginal compared to the base cost. The reason this is true 
in HROs is that reliability and safety go together because both are driven by loss 
prevention. Some may argue that a machine can be reliable but unsafe or it may be 
safe but unreliable. From a practical perspective, this doesn’t apply in operations. 
Any serious loss whether an injury or a machine breakdown is a system failure and 
cause for concern.
In HROs, business improvement can be driven by better operational 
risk management to encompass efficiency, safety and other benefits. 
Conversations should be held about how these are inter‑related.
The procurement function has a major responsibility to understand operational needs 
to incorporate safety, efficiency, quality, and reliability when purchasing new plant, 
equipment and tools. Multidisciplinary input should be part of determining, revising 
and maintaining procurement standards. This is a key strategy in risk management 254 Productive Safety Management
that affects the residual risk and potential entropic risk of the operations. Such strat‑
egy may simply be a refinement for those organisations that have made inroads 
towards higher levels of reliability.
4 revisiting residual risk and alarp
Extensive discussion has been dedicated to the concept of residual risk and this has 
entailed a healthy cynicism towards the current definition and practices. There’s 
a universal suite of energies and conditions that can result in workplace fatalities, 
serious injuries, and debilitating illnesses. Not all will apply in every workplace, 
but no business is exempt from fatality potential. At this time in society’s history, 
these energy‑related risks are known knowns and the required mitigations are public 
knowledge thanks to legislative requirements, the internet and websites provided by 
regulators and other key stakeholders. In this regard, there should be no excuses for 
not having the basic compliance controls in place that keep people safe.
The current gap is that the concept of entropic risk isn’t part of industry language 
and it’s assumed that degradation of systems of production are neatly packaged 
within this residual risk concept. Risk registers will list training, preventative main‑
tenance of technologies, fatigue management and other programmes identified using 
the Entropy Model as the ‘maintenance’ phase. Everything is assigned to a pigeon‑
hole that doesn’t consider the interfaces, complexity and potential chaos within these 
systems and organisational factors. Residual risk as understood by risk owners at 
each phase of a facility’s lifecycle needs to be revisited. The earlier discussion about 
Prevention through Design raised serious matters about the most fundamental of 
residual risk mitigations which is front‑end engineering and design. This is exac‑
erbated by the cost pressures of getting projects to a financial investment decision. 
This incentivises lower cost, less HSE in design and cheaper construction methods 
and as a result, operations may inherit a higher residual risk than currently under‑
stood by site manager and OSH personnel. This may not be ALARP except for the 
potential loophole in the definition of ‘reasonably practicable’ which accounts for the 
costs of mitigations and therefore enables lower standards to be justified on shrewd 
cost‑benefit basis.
The probability of an incident relates to the absolute levels of residual and entropic 
risks at a given point in time, within a dynamic process. For this reason, a written risk 
assessment becomes redundant as soon as the work commences. Safety then depends 
on human responses to the changing risk profile. Risk variables must remain within 
tolerances that people can manage which is tenuous given that human resources are 
fallible. The real residual risk may therefore be much higher than what management 
consider it to be. This was the purpose of raising the ALARP Assumption.
HROs with their preoccupation with failure and losses should be wary of 
ALARP on paper. This warrants a new term: ‘ALARP as Documented’ 
(AaD) versus ‘ALARP as Material’ (AaM).
The term ‘material risks’ are sometimes used in mature organisations and is a situa‑
tion when someone or something of value is exposed to danger, harm, or loss. These Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 255
are often associated with financial costs. Organisations aiming to increase their lev‑
els of reliability must be wary about any gaps between their risk assessment and the 
realistic dynamics that occur within their operations.
The other concern raised throughout the conversation about residual risk 
is that, if the ALARP Assumption is correct, adding more lower order controls 
doesn’t reduce risk. This means current risk assessment processes are deficient. 
A new approach that combines residual and entropic risks of an activity, and more 
broadly, ‘The Work’, needs to be considered. Decision‑makers may not be aware 
of current risk matrix design features that increase uncertainty. This indicates that 
the Safety Risk Assessment Matrix is inherently unreliability as a decision support 
technique. Gaps within other matrices should draw the attention of designers in the 
first instance.
It may be that current, deficient risk matrices contribute to progressively 
compounding risk creating unknown unknowns in the built and operating 
work environment.
An organisation aspiring to be a HRO should go back to the ‘drawing board’ to 
better understand their total risk profile. Their objective should be to uncover these 
unknown knowns. By earlier definition – events aren’t known to the analysts who 
conducted the risk assessment. They’re either outside their realm of knowledge or 
they didn’t conduct a thorough risk analysis, but the events are known to others 
(Aven, 2017). In these circumstances, the risk assessment team should be looking 
for systems deficiencies that haven’t previously been considered rather than trying to 
determine events. This rationale goes back to the method in Chapter 7 which aims to 
understand the real risks as they occur in operations. For instance, have there been 
compromises to procurement standards that mean plant has componentry which 
is substandard and could malfunction? Perhaps these components were purchased 
because of cost savings but the result is poor quality and reliability. In the Challenger 
disaster, it was believed that the failure of the primary and secondary redundant 
O‑ring seals in the right booster caused the catastrophe.
In current operations, are there weaknesses or vulnerabilities that can 
cause future failure that management aren’t aware of?
The organisation adopting HRO principles should want assurance that their resid‑
ual risks are known knowns. Armed with healthy cynicism, previous risk assess‑
ments should be viewed as having procedural flaws, information gaps and inherent 
misjudgements.
5 understanding tHe defiCienCies of Current risk assessment praCtiCes
The risk matrix uses likelihood as a key criterion, and this encompasses exposure. 
This is often understood as a time‑related variable but realistically, it’s the severity 
of the risks more so than simply the length of time of contact that matters. Timing 
becomes important when Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model is considered. It’s the critical 256 Productive Safety Management
moment when the holes in the system line up leading to a serious injury or incident. 
In a very high‑risk situation, this could occur anytime.
In the discussions, it was proposed that worker exposure is the sum of a complex 
set of variables associated with systems of production. Collectively, it includes the 
residual and entropic risks associated with the processes, technologies used and the 
work environment along with human resources risks. The latter include the residual 
risks and entropic risks of other workers along with those of the individual/s who 
may be directly involved in the loss. Current risk assessment practices don’t consider 
this complexity or take a systems approach to breaking risk down into its elements.
In Chapter 7, a different approach was proposed for the mental modelling of risk. 
One of the primary objectives was to take risk owners and risk‑related professionals 
back to the core strategies that directly affect risk as it exists operationally. The con‑
cept of risk modifiers was presented. This is a characteristic of a system of produc‑
tion that either increases or decreases the level of residual or entropic risk. Negative 
risk modifiers increase the level of risk, whereas positive risk modifiers lower this 
level. The aim of using risk modifiers is to instil a deep awareness of effective risk 
management strategies such as HSE in design for residual risks of technologies and 
the workplace. The risk assessment process should revert to higher order controls 
rather than imagining more rules or procedures that in most cases, only achieve 
incremental risk reduction at best.
The eight scorers are designed to be a learning tool to direct risk workshop par‑
ticipants’ mindset away from the singular concept of risk and the simplicity of the 
risk matrix. They should focus on systems rather than behaviours and take a multi‑
disciplinary approach rather than the narrow focus of their discipline (such as safety 
or quality).
In this edition, from an operational perspective, current OSH risk assessment 
processes particularly attracted criticism as these are often too much about satisfy‑
ing the management system than being meaningful to operational personnel. These 
can involve a group of managers and supervisors in a meeting room going through 
known hazards or tasks and undertaking a risk assessment with the help of a facilita‑
tor. The platform used may be a spreadsheet or database. The outcomes can be far 
removed from reality especially when there are strong biases towards escalating the 
importance of one impact over another, for instance, inflating environmental harm of 
minor spills in non‑sensitive areas. From observation, in some cases, it’s a means of 
exaggerating the importance of the work of a particular function. This compromises 
the process of determining relative risk levels. Instead, the risk assessment should 
serve two purposes. The first is to create a learning or skill development oppor‑
tunity for participants and the second is to capture this local knowledge to inform 
risk‑based decision‑making.
HROs should be pragmatic about how they undertake risk assessments, so 
these are meaningful to the people who must own and manage these risks.
The path to high reliability should include a strategy of critiquing and 
improving on the ways in which risk information is gathered.Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 257
6 loss investigation and organisational learning
When risk isn’t the sound basis of professional thinking, cyclical patterns can be 
repeated like fashions that come and go. Unfortunately, the concept of ‘Acts of God’ 
has re‑emerged as a root cause of accidents. This needs to be clearly contextualised. 
The problem is that without accountability, there’s no learning from failures or suc‑
cesses, which defies the principles of HRO learning. Calling an incident an ‘Act of 
God’ needs to be justifiable. As stated earlier, if it’s foreseeable, avoidable, control‑
lable, practical and the organisation’s responsibility, it’s not an ‘Act of God’. Every 
other undesirable event resulting from the natural environment should be subjected 
to scrutiny on a case‑by‑case basis. There’s the danger that categorisation of incidents 
in this way can enable excuses by owners and leaders for failure to act on risk. Don’t 
blame us. Blame Mother Nature.
Senior decision‑makers must be alerted to the increasing accountability of 
enterprise officers due to legislative requirements, environmental and community 
obligations, and social expectations. This is a matter of fact and has no intended 
fearmongering tones. Rather than keeping the organisation in the ‘survival’ phase 
synonymous with reactive strategies and avoidance of external flack in the pursuit of 
short‑term profit, enterprises intending to remain relevant longer‑term must simply 
accept that compliance is the minimum benchmark. This also requires a different 
approach to incidents and undesirable events. Decision‑makers must accept failings 
well ahead of any event that attracts the regulators’ attention. ‘Free’ lessons with no 
or minimal costs to people, the business or the community must provoke a sense of 
urgency towards reparation. Some have raised concerns that the more an organisa‑
tion understands its risks and documents these, the more they may be exposed legally 
if something goes wrong and they’ve failed to act. HROs are too concerned with 
prevention to pay undue attention to such ‘what if’ driven repercussions.
Prevention involves planning for success not just avoidance of failure. 
Prevention is also about learning not blaming.
Instead of starting an incident investigation with what the person/s did wrong prior to 
and at the time of the undesirable event, the question shifts firstly, to analysis of the 
system and circumstances that led to one or more critical risk decisions. The second 
consideration is whether those person/s were adequately prepared (by the system) to 
manage or control the risk state that led to the event. To be technically correct given 
that ‘safety violations’ are a component within the organisation’s total risk profile, 
investigators should consider how the organisation failed to protect a competent, con‑
scientious worker; after all, it’s the responsibility of the employer to ensure that the 
worker is adequately prepared to do the work safely.
Aspiring HROs must accept that they control the system that determines 
the readiness of personnel to manage risks and to respond to unexpected 
contingencies or failures. Competency development is a HRO 
accountability.258 Productive Safety Management
It’s important to accept that most workers (which includes managers) aim to do the 
right thing for the right reasons. In practice therefore, a ‘violation’ is not simply 
intent. It’s a matter of whether the behaviour is non‑compliant to required practice – 
procedural (written), the norms of the workgroup (in practice) and the organisational 
culture (expectations). For a safety violation to have occurred, it must be preceded 
by individual behavioural risk‑taking as the root cause, without extraneous influenc‑
ing factors that are within the control of the organisation’s systems or practices. In 
HROs, safety violations should be understood within the context of the system.
It’s worth reinforcing that it’s important to step away from associating risk man‑
agement with discrimination. The objective is to protect people from harm and enable 
productive work, not to treat them unfairly or downplay moral and ethical principles. 
Loss investigations should analyse the interfaces between systems of production and 
the states of residual and entropic risks of each of these systems. The analysis of 
person‑specific residual and entropic risks should be last as most incidents could 
have occurred to someone else under a slightly different set of circumstances, such 
as timing. HRO whilst being a strongly technical entity must balance this systems of 
production perspective to loss investigation with humanistic values built into those 
systems, such as procedural fairness.
The focus on human error is a hindrance from exploring fully the underlying vari‑
ables that lead to losses. These are often attributable to inadequate or degraded systems 
of production or organisational factors. Few managers have the courage to undertake 
root‑cause analysis into decision‑making processes to uncover underlying deficien‑
cies within the management system, culture and/or leadership that could have affected 
workers’ behavioural choices. Poor planning and implementation at the strategic level 
can result in escalating pressures on operations to achieve targets within constrained 
timeframes. For this reason, in earlier discussions, organisations were strongly encour‑
aged to support those in influential leadership positions whose performance may be in 
decline. Learning should encompass having the courage to have conversations about 
what are currently believed to be ‘undiscussable’ risks. The overarching objective is to 
achieve a more objective, systems perspective to understanding loss causation. This is 
a major shift away from ‘unsafe acts’ and ‘unsafe conditions’.
It’s essential for enterprises to mature to a Multidisciplinary Principal Risk 
and Opportunity Strategy focused on what they know, can uncover, 
and can control.
Accountability and procedural fairness must be inherent in the way the enterprise is 
led and managed. This applies at all levels of the hierarchy from company officers 
to workers on the shopfloor. The implication is that a greater level of conciliation 
is required with an acceptance of the need to do better whenever failures occur. In 
the meantime, everyone should be encouraged to not only raise concerns about the 
safety, quality, and efficiency of the work but also propose solutions. As stated ear‑
lier, at the most fundamental level, there needs to be an acceptance that entropic risk 
is real, and no individual can fathom the extent of this within a complex, interdepen‑
dent system. It requires a collective effort to learn progressively rather than waiting 
to learn the hard way.Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 259
7 day‑to‑day operational risk management
There are numerous synergies gained from having a multidisciplinary approach to 
organisational development and some of the tried and tested strategies should be 
revisited. For instance, there are practical benefits for operations from the Lean 
Production model; however, this should be moderated by avoiding being too pedan‑
tic about ‘compliance’ or ‘quality’ from an internal auditor’s perspective. The truth 
is that some degree of ‘organised chaos’ is a natural characteristic of how work gets 
done. What may look like disorder to the OSH professional who’s undertaking a 
workplace walkthrough may be work as done by operational personnel and it doesn’t 
necessarily mean that conditions are ‘unsafe’.
The critical factor is to take a risk‑based approach, rather than having false expec‑
tations of an ideal world. The internal inspection regime shouldn’t be so rigorous to 
pursue granular detail to the extent that low value thoroughness with greatly dimin‑
ished return in terms of risk reduction, results. Procedures and checklists in this style 
invariably deliver negative feedback on non‑critical matters. Efforts should focus 
on real risks. There needs to be a balanced mindset to treat people fairly and not 
introduce unrealistic expectations that can cause individual or group level psycho‑
social stress. Regular negative feedback can be demoralising for teams who on the 
most part are likely trying to do well. More effort should go into providing positive 
feedback on important risk mitigations and finding solutions for any gaps through 
consultation with the supervisors and workers of that workplace.
The fundamentals of having a place for everything in its place, once the work has 
been completed and in readiness for the next phase of production, without creating 
real risks in the meantime, is a fair and reasonable expectation. Readiness involves 
restoring systems for the next group of shift workers and providing good communica‑
tion during a handover process, to achieve teamwork across different interdependent 
work groups. This should make life easier for supervisors and workers. These are the 
types of conversations that can be held and lead to improvements. Most people will 
agree that they prefer to arrive at work to an orderly workplace where they can find 
what they need to be safe and efficient.
Reliability must extend to how people work together and how they depend 
on each other to be safe, efficient, and enabled to do a quality job. This 
applies regardless of the level of the hierarchy at which 
a person works.
Day‑to‑day operational risk management should be supported by integrated OSH 
and operational practice documentation. The ‘system’ built through consultation and 
participation drives the desired behaviours and decision‑making processes. That’s 
because input builds ownership. At the same time, competencies should be enhanced 
holistically not by single function. ‘Safety’ doesn’t exist in isolation from other busi‑
ness objectives, especially production so ultimately the aim of life skills training 
is for personnel to have an internal dialogue that prompts the question, ‘Is it worth 
the risk?’ This should be a regular part of daily discussions in HROs at the strategic 
and workplace levels. Initially, it may be planned through integration into the team 260 Productive Safety Management
meeting agenda so that people become comfortable with these types of conversa‑
tions, however, eventually, it should occur organically.
On site, operational discipline should be inherent in how systems perform. 
Discipline doesn’t mean punishment in this context, instead it relates to planned, 
deliberate actions to manage risks. The control of the process comes down to two 
things. The first is the quality of the systems of production that are being used; sec‑
ondly, how well the work has been planned, communicated, understood by those 
involved plus agreed contingencies if something changes during execution that could 
lead to losses. Operations must be empowered to focus on high‑performing core 
business and critical control management. Supporting functions provide a buffer 
from influencing forces that are realistically beyond frontline operations’ control but 
can introduce burdensome chaos and complexity.
The path to high reliability involves inclusion of stakeholders who perform 
the work. This means seamlessness between principal and contractor companies, 
between the client’s and contractors’ supervisors, and between employees and out‑
sourced personnel. A risk‑based approach involves alignment along the contractual 
chain, otherwise, risks can be overlooked because of blind spots and assumptions. An 
example of successful principal‑contractor relations was given earlier. Stakeholders 
made a collaborative effort to deliver an extensive seismic survey on a mine site. 
The result of the consultative risk assessment was a plan that was agreed by relevant 
parties and that was worked to. The scope was delivered without incident, in a spirit 
of goodwill without conflict, on time, on budget and to expected quality standards.
The ‘perfect job’ resulted from ‘front‑end loading’ of risk assessment, 
planning, and communication with clear roles and responsibilities. 
Everyone involved had a mindset of what was achievable without being 
ignorant to the risks.
The people in the project team perceived each other to be reliable, knowledgeable, 
and having a common objective of attaining outstanding project delivery. It took a 
few strong leaders initially to create an environment for success.
Aspiring HROs should invest in potential champions to achieve risk 
leadership competencies across functional areas and vertically through 
the hierarchy. This investment leads to better ‘front‑end loading’ especially 
for new projects, scopes of work or ahead of significant changes 
to the operation.
8 risk management as a life skill
The Entropy Model is designed to give clarity to managers and workers alike about 
what effective risk management entails. The Four‑Step Risk Management Strategy 
is a life skill that defines workplace practices that are much more meaningful than 
simply the instruction to comply with the management system. These steps are, in 
relation to preventing entropic risk, identifying areas of degradation, and taking Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 261
corrective action. This also involves preventing degradation through well‑disciplined 
operational practices with everyone’s input making a difference. What this looks like 
is that the systems of production that have been designed for safe, efficient, quality 
work are maintained to agreed standards. If there are recurrent areas of decay, not 
only are these corrected but also actions taken to implement maintenance practices 
to raise the quality of these systems to an optimal level. Maintenance means setting, 
achieving and sustaining systems quality across the four systems of production.
The second part of the strategy is to manage residual risks. At an individual level, 
high levels of alertness are required when undertaking high risk work or operating 
within a high‑risk environment. At the organisational level, resources are budgeted 
for on a risk‑basis with particular attention to those inherent risks that can cause 
the greatest consequences if systems fail. Individuals are alert whilst the enterprise 
maintains chronic wariness and collective mindfulness. The longer‑term strategy is 
to reduce residual risk through capital investment and improvements in industries’ 
knowledge and capacity to manage these risks.
Risk management is a life skill for workers (at work and home) and involves under‑
standing the consequences of failing to manage residual risk and prevent entropic 
risk. This can be evident at home, for instance, costly residence and vehicle expenses 
because repairs were delayed. It could be that the person has ignored medical advice 
to later suffer a more serious health issue. Because risk management is a life skill, 
there are parallels between risk at the micro and macro levels – individual to organ‑
isation to community.
The Entropy Model can illustrate the consequences of leaving entropic risk uncon‑
trolled, with the inevitable result of a serious loss. Along the rising entropic risk 
curve, management should be concerned about trends pointing to iterative losses that 
are costing the enterprise directly or indirectly. There’s a strong case for adopting the 
mindfulness principles of HROs. Ahead of any significant loss or crisis, expertise 
should revert to centres of excellence made up of the subject matter experts with deep 
understanding of the risks involved.
This is a different approach to training and development than currently exists 
within industry where each discipline competes for budget. The synergies across 
safety, environment and quality are driven by risk and opportunity management. 
Significant saving may be possible from treating these deliverables collectively by 
building risk leadership capacity.
HROs whilst being preoccupied with failure should also be proactive about 
reducing waste when resources can be better spent elsewhere on genuine 
risk reduction and building capacity.
The emphasis of capacity development should be on transferable knowledge and 
skills that enable a person to adapt and adjust according to the dynamic nature of 
the risks at work and outside of work. One of the observations of Australian workers 
is that in the past (50 years ago), they wore shorts, a short‑sleeved shirt and any‑
thing on their feet when they went to work, even in high‑risk environments such as 
mining. Today, it’s not unusual to see people mowing their lawn wearing protective 
clothing, closed footwear, safety glasses and a hat. What has been learned at work 262 Productive Safety Management
has transferred to the home. A person with these habits isn’t going to revert to past 
standards. This is what organisations should be aiming for – an industry‑wide level 
of risk management competencies.
9 CapaCity tHrougH leadersHip and Culture
Risk‑based professionals feel comfortable with their function‑specific plans, proce‑
dures, objectives, KPIs, training modules and cultural identity. Often these are devel‑
oped from their discipline’s perspective. Thought should be given, however, to the 
operations managers, supervisors and workers who are being bombarded with inter‑
nally driven compliance from multiple disciplines. The growth of self‑regulation 
means that they’re expected to believe in, comply with, and deliver results across all 
these areas as well as core business. Aspiring HROs should be wary of this phenom‑
enon which Hollnagel (2021) referred to as fragmentation.
This also applies to other functions such as human resources management and 
organisational development. A sense‑check is sorely needed to realign various func‑
tional areas towards a risk‑based, multidisciplinary approach. For instance, there’s 
no such thing as ‘Safety Leadership’, only ‘Leadership’; otherwise, there also must 
be ‘Environmental Leadership, ‘Quality Leadership’, ‘Production Leadership’ etc. 
Rhetoric about what constitutes appropriate leadership has grown. Even the term 
leadership has morphed into ‘Stewardship’ in some organisations.
One of the aims of this book has been to look at being a leader from a practi‑
cal, operational perspective. It was proposed that a continuum of styles, from asser‑
tive to collaborative, as it relates to the level of risk and urgency, is a more realistic 
approach. In this second edition, organisational factors have also been addressed 
including the need to open the neatly wrapped package of ‘undiscussables’. This con‑
tains the residual and entropic risks associated with leadership, competencies, man‑
agement systems and resilience/ resourcefulness. It was proposed that entities have a 
residual risk because of constraints within these factors which means there’s no such 
thing as perfection only optimisation. Concerningly, these factors can decay setting 
the business on a path to failure. Both systems of production and organisational fac‑
tors must be managed to prevent losses but also to achieve continual improvement. 
Groupthink and stereotyping are threats to enterprise performance, particularly, at 
the senior levels of the organisation. History has shown this to be the case in many 
enterprises prior to their catastrophic losses.
The phenomenon of leadership degradation was proposed earlier to be a seri‑
ous risk. Personnel in influential positions when going through degraded job per‑
formance can create a ripple effect that brings the rest of the team down. Just as 
‘black swans’ are unknown unknowns in technologies and the physical environment, 
‘undiscussables’ create blind spots to these issues that can result in loss of capacity to 
deliver on team objectives. This may be considered too sensitive to discuss; however, 
the repercussions of inaction warrant a more objective, risk‑based mindset balanced 
with genuine care and concern.
Changes are needed in how leaders are developed. Incumbents should start with 
a deep breath. Individuals shouldn’t pigeonhole themselves into being a certain type 
of leader or blindly follow a leadership mantra. They should be the best possible Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 263
version of themselves and develop a deep understand to manage their own risks and 
opportunities. Risk leadership starts with understanding the operational reality of the 
organisation. Where possible, seek the truth. During the site visit, the senior manage‑
ment (VIP) party will receive information that is visually and verbally filtered com‑
pared to day‑to‑day operations, leaving them with a sanitised perception of the core 
business environment. This isn’t helpful. They can’t fix what they don’t know or don’t 
understand. HROs and their leadership team are sensitive to operations, reluctant to 
simplify and committed to resilience.
Some traditional approaches to leadership development hold true. Transformational 
leadership requires managers and supervisors to loosen their grip on control without 
relinquishing it. Their role is to provide a guiding hand and empower their subordi‑
nates. Having an agreed, overarching driver of leadership behaviour may be needed 
to generate synergies across business units and departments. It’s worth considering 
a Risk Ethos, for instance, “We, [insert organisation name], manage risk to achieve 
safety, production, and quality concurrently. Every decision we make is for safe 
production and a quality job. This is our Risk Ethos. This is how we work”. The 
rationale behind this strategy is that it allows for situational leadership. For instance, 
command and control management, whilst not in vogue, isn’t wrong. It depends on 
the risk profile of the work and the capacity of the workforce to manage the risks. 
More conscious effort is needed to understand and manage capacity constraints. A 
firm leadership style doesn’t mean that the executive team is devoid of care and con‑
cern for people. Leadership programmes should be revisited to assess whether these 
deliver ‘Leadership as Imagined’ (LAI) or ‘Leadership as Needed’ (LAN).
Management systems also warrant a rethink. The current dialogue in the OSH 
profession suggests that these systems are over‑developed. From experience, it’s more 
a case that ‘needs’ haven’t been differentiated from ‘wants’; the latter resulting from 
deviating away from a risk‑based approach. Unfortunately, this drains resources bet‑
ter spent on fatality, serious injury and debilitating illness prevention. The aspiring 
HRO would cast a critical eye over their systems to determine if it’s a help or a hin‑
drance from an operational perspective. Unfortunately, with over‑developed systems, 
there can be a tendency to add lower order controls after incidents. The enterprise 
thereby creates its own bureaucracy well beyond what compliance demands – risk 
management that is ‘reasonably practicable’.
Management may be fearful of removing any safety programmes or processes 
because they committed to them in the first place. At the time, it was probably 
believed that low value additional procedures would reduce the level of risk further to 
a new ALARP. This makes it more difficult to turn back the hands of time to a more 
pragmatic approach. Right‑sizing of the management system needs to be done on a 
justifiable risk basis. Relevant managers and professionals should do a sense‑check 
based on data and to ask operational managers for their input. Some safety com‑
mentators have proposed that workers are asked what’s the stupidest thing they must 
comply with in the workplace. Operationally, this is ridiculous. ‘Stupid’ and ‘comply’ 
don’t belong in the same sentence. Management would be foolish to opening under‑
mine themselves suggesting to workers that they introduced ‘stupid’ rules.
Management systems can degrade if not maintained. This can be characterised 
by increasing levels of disorder and chaos culminating in ‘Systems Dementia’. The 264 Productive Safety Management
organisation’s memory, cognitive skills, and social structures can fade beyond rec‑
ognition. There’s an additional organisational risk if leaders accept this degradation 
because, in the short‑term, the system continues to provide acceptable performance. 
Data may still be extracted but there’s a danger that no one will questions whether 
it’s ‘garbage in, garbage out’. From experience, one of the first opportunities in a 
new role is to deeply interrogate the management systems using a gaps analysis, 
well before it becomes familiar. This is the starting point to right‑size by collating a 
strategic improvement plan.
HROs welcome a ‘Cold Eyes’ (Independent Project) Review of their 
systems to identify excess or waste and make recommendations for 
down‑ or right‑sizing.
Organisational factors need to be monitored from a risk and opportunity perspective. 
A business may have state of the art systems of production today in terms of pro‑
cesses, technologies, physical workplaces, and highly skilled operational personnel, 
however, if leadership and culture erode at the top, the ‘castle’ may be destined to 
collapse. Ultimately, this may come about because of incremental strategic decisions 
that deviate from the path. At the high level, external influences need to be managed 
to focus the enterprise on balancing short‑term and longer‑term objectives.
Much of the discussions in this edition were dedicate to risk‑based decision‑ 
making processes and the compromises that can occur from project inception to 
operational handover. There are numerous examples that confirm that enterprises 
can go from industry leadership to devastating failure. Who (collective not singular) 
took their eyes off the ball?
10 tHe multi‑disCiplinary approaCH to risk management
Risk is complex and dynamic, especially in this Fourth Industrial Revolution in 
which change is the norm and disruption lurks around the corner. Even in steady 
state operations, the world of work isn’t like it was during the Industrial Revolution. 
The array of risks and opportunities are much broader.
Despite technological progress, known knowns remain inadequately 
managed as evident in harm to people, inefficiencies, and other wastes. 
Operationally, there’s still a strong argument for getting the basics right.
PSM1 and this edition have provided a more detailed view on the nature of risk with 
each granular task having eight potential sources – the residual and entropic risks of 
each of the four systems of production. These collectively, affect the organisation’s 
capacity to achieve multiple objectives including core business deliverables, HSE 
performance and quality outputs for stakeholders. This spectrum of risk demands 
a multidisciplinary approach at each touchpoint from the initial concept, front‑end 
engineering and design, through to the built working organisation. Gaps in Prevention 
through Design were raised to pinpoint where the deficiencies and opportunities for 
improvement begin, back on the drawing board.Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 265
No single discipline can determine the risks inherent in the final build. Once 
operations commence, the same applies to the management of these risks. A multi‑
disciplinary approach is fundamental to good management, however, unfortunately, 
the construction of organisational silos has counteracted this approach in practice. 
What has happened instead is that some functions such as OSH, because safety is 
relevant to so many aspects of operations, have grown to the extent that at times, 
they’re thought to be the risk owners and decision‑makers. Realistically, this cer‑
tainly isn’t the case. The extensive discussions about the residual and entropic risks 
of each system of production (Chapters 3 to 6) made this clear. The most significant 
gap in this regard is that enterprise leaders haven’t stepped back far enough to look at 
risk and opportunity holistically to identify that this is the driver that affects every‑
thing, and then ensured implementation top‑down and bottom‑up strategically in 
their organisations.
At the site level, the perspective needs to change to well beyond the company 
gates. In today’s business environment, the risks from supply chain and procurement 
are critical inputs to operational risk management and the organisation’s capacity 
to sustain safe, efficient production. The older style of thinking about the world is 
to look for knowns, measure it and/or fix it. In the new style, the assumption is not 
knowing what to look for. What is now more important, is to look for anomalies and 
unusual trends. In addition, highly complex systems could have unknown unknown 
risks that lead to total failure. The problem is that traditional approaches to risk 
assessment won’t detect these risks.
There’s an urgent need for organisations to rethink their approach to human 
resources risk management and organisation management more generally. HR risks 
were discussed extensively as a system of production and within the context of organ‑
isational factors. An objective approach was taken without discrimination, objectify‑
ing workers, or absence of ethical and moral standards. This is a risk‑based approach 
in action.
Some of the contentious issues in part stemming from the OSH profession, were 
raised including safety branding, the growth of bureaucratic systems, non‑alignment 
of strategy with operational reality, and the challenges of delivering on safety and 
production concurrently within management systems that don’t address conflicting 
objectives. All too often, operational managers and frontline supervisors feel trapped 
between ‘a rock and a hard place’ when it comes to making decisions about safety 
versus production. OSH legislation demands that the organisation do what is ‘reason‑
ably practicable’ to manage operational risks. It’s not irrational or arbitrary to have 
a decision tool called the ‘Reasonableness Test’ to ensure these leaders in critical 
operational roles, have a basis on which to determine and justify their day‑to‑day 
decisions, concurrently ensuring that they receive the support of the managers they 
report to.
Sites are where the real risks exist and it’s these personnel who are potentially 
in the firing line when it comes to injuries but also if production isn’t achieved. 
Strategically, organisations can achieve more by considering this perspective. The 
value of human performance and learning is currently under‑appreciated and from 
a business perspective, under‑exploited. This could become an even greater issue in 
the future with the introduction of new technologies. How will operations personnel 266 Productive Safety Management
raise legitimate concerns about the functionality of AI in the workplace? Will it be 
trivialised because it’s assumed that AI is right? Will senior management be recep‑
tive to ‘dumb’ questions (which may in fact be the best to ask)? Experts are predict‑
ing that unknown unknowns will emerge because the traditional approach to ‘what 
if’ analysis simply won’t work because of the complexity of the interconnectedness 
of things. A multidisciplinary approach to risk and opportunity management isn’t a 
‘nice to have’. It’s a necessity for today’s operations.
Back‑tracking through this edition of PSM, a key aim was to break risk down so 
that these multiple inputs can be readily identified according to the risk source within 
each system of production. It requires more than systems‑driven risk ownership. 
A transformation of mindset is required from safety/ environment/ discipline‑based 
thinking to risk‑ and opportunity‑based thinking. The primary aim of this edition has 
been to invite the reader to make this transformation.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This chapter has brought together the contents of previous chapters and invited the 
reader to make a transformation from silo‑based thinking to risk‑ and opportunity‑based 
thinking. The Entropy Model and other tools within this edition have been combined 
with HRO principles to devise a Multidisciplinary Principal Risk and Opportunity 
Strategy to enable this transformation at the organisational level.
These HRO principles were shown to have strengths and weaknesses. It was pro‑
posed that it’s insufficient to simply have a general preoccupation with failure. The 
Entropy Model suggests specifically that attention should be paid to incremental 
losses that constitute waste along the rising entropic risk curve. This calls for proac‑
tive habits at the strategic and operational levels of recognising this rise and respond‑
ing promptly with corrective action but also, implementing maintenance practices 
for prevention. The model highlights that an organisation for various reasons can go 
through cycles of failing, mending, optimising and failing again. The phenomenon 
demands that enterprise leaders be chronically wary of degradation of systems of 
production and organisational factors. This wariness should always apply to residual 
risks which are ever present.
Operations were asked to be cynical about their current level of residual risk and 
vulnerability to entropic risk resulting from decisions made during the earliest phases 
of their site’s lifecycle. False assumptions are readily made that the project delivered 
after commissioning is at ALARP. This is only justifiable because of the potential 
loophole within ‘reasonably practicable’ that considers the cost of risk mitigation. 
The pressure to obtain financial investment can constrain HSE in design of projects 
which is difficult to remediate during operations because of disruption and further 
cost pressures to recoup debts and generate revenue. These residual risks must be 
managed. The problem is whether these are properly understood and whether facili‑
ties have in‑built unknown unknowns.
The transformation to risk‑ and opportunity‑based thinking encourages ratio‑
nalisation of training and development in organisations. Extensive resources are 
expended on discipline‑specific programmes to build ‘safety leadership’, ‘safety cul‑
ture’, ‘environmental stewardship’ etc. All these functions are risk‑based and yet, few Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 267
if any organisations have consolidated these programmes to take a holistic approach 
to risk management as an organisational and life skill. There are synergies across 
functions that are too often prevented by the silos themselves. A multidisciplinary 
approach would encompass risk competencies, leadership and culture development 
around the principal strategy.
This edition has focused strongly on enabling operations to concentrate on their 
key deliverables including critical control identification, implementation and verifica‑
tion. This doesn’t just apply to OSH but also continuity of production, environmental 
management, and quality assurance. Critical control assurance and operational disci‑
pline are a must for loss prevention across operational functions. Several opportuni‑
ties for improvement based on sense‑checks were identified. These include ‘ALARP 
as material’ instead of ‘ALARP as documented’ which requires opening new lines 
of enquiry into operations as built. Management systems should be scrutinised to 
achieve right‑sizing based on risk ‑ ‘needs’ and not ‘wants’.
From an organisation factors perspective, expectations about leadership have 
resulted in confusion and too many ‘hats’ for the operations manager and supervi‑
sor to switch between. Getting back to basics would entail ‘leadership as needed’ as 
opposed to ‘leadership as imagined’, with influencing personnel enabled to leverage 
their own personality and style rather than being ascribed some ideal that may be 
unnatural to that person. These competencies apply along the contractual chain with 
alignment based on effective risk management to achieve safe, efficient scope execu‑
tion to the expected output standards. Success is planned for through ‘front‑end load‑
ing’ of collaborative risk assessment, planning and ongoing, open communication.
Ten strategies were proposed for moving organisations towards higher levels of 
reliability. These should be critiqued against the enterprise’s needs including those 
of external stakeholders. To assist this improvement process, the Strategic Alignment 
Channel may be revisited at any time, to better understand the context of the business 
and where external governing and influencing forces may affect it. Several tools have 
been provided to broaden the horizons of the business owner or manager in the SME 
through to senior managers in large organisations. A risk‑ and opportunity‑based 
strategy must deliver value in any enterprise, in any context, and to any person who 
has a stake in safety, production and quality.
The ten strategies are diverse and will apply to various industries and enterprises 
in different ways. This means that critical thinking should be used when considering 
the prospects that have been presented. These included: showing honesty in assess‑
ing the identity and maturity of the enterprise; understanding risk not as a singular 
concept but involving residual and entropic risks with complex interfaces; apply‑
ing caution in relation to current risk management practices; having better ways of 
managing risk day‑to‑day that lead to higher levels of participation, consultation and 
ownership; and customising longer‑term strategies to develop capacity and ways of 
working collaboratively.
From the outset, it’s been clear that this edition isn’t an academic piece, instead 
it draws on experience. At times the discussions have swung from strategy to opera‑
tions with the intention of providing perspective on challenging issues from differ‑
ent angles. The introduction opened with, “An idealist is essentially risk‑loving with 
respect to the achievement of the ideal” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2024). The hook of 268 Productive Safety Management
the quote was ‘risk‑loving’ which was necessary to immediate quash any assump‑
tion that this book, whilst called ‘Productive Safety Management’ is a book solely 
about OSH. It’s hoped that the reader has gained much more than a new view on 
safety. PSM1 sought primarily to address the conflict between safety and production 
to achieve improvement using a strategic, multidisciplinary approach to risk man‑
agement. The title, “Productive Safety Management” reflected the intent at the time. 
This second edition may have otherwise been better named, “Productive Operational 
Risk Management”.
In this edition, risk and opportunity were presented in equal measure and many 
of the examples illustrated both aspects of what can be achieved in practice. The 
original Entropy Model in PSM1 (2003) identified the unrealistic paradigm in which 
safety, production output and quality are perfect and without risk, and yet brand‑
ing such as ‘Zero Harm’ has since risen to prominence and in more recent years, 
faded away.
In this edition, the Entropy Model was extended to cover organisational factor 
risks again emphasising the fallacy of perfection. Importantly idealistic expectations 
of operational managers and supervisors to be perfect leaders able to juggle multiple 
objectives and wear numerous hats, have been challenged. This is particularly in 
the context of management systems that haven’t addressed inherent conflict between 
business objectives that such managers are directed to deliver on through mostly lag‑
ging KPIs. Solutions such as the ‘Reasonableness Test’, situational leadership based 
on risk, and operational risk assessment practices using practical testing and observa‑
tion, were provided to address this gap.
Almost every operational decision presents a potential dilemma of production ver‑
sus safety and maintenance issues as described in PSM1. Hollnagel (2009) described 
the Efficiency Thoroughness Trade‑off which consolidates this quandary. PSM1
introduced the Alignment Fallacy as a serious organisation defect especially in rela‑
tion to ‘Safety First’ in the context of mixed middle management messaging and 
operational compromises. The discussion about the Alignment Fallacy was worth 
revisited. In addition, confusion continues to reign about what operational personnel 
are responsible for compared to support functions. There’s a different between being 
a Risk Owner and an Assurance Process Owner. If in doubt, ask the question. Some 
of the ‘bad news’ may be lack of clarity on accountabilities versus responsibilities.
A key theme throughout this edition has been around what can be done as opposed 
to what can’t be done. Some risk‑based professions have embraced the latter mindset 
because of reluctance to look more deeply into legislative requirements and business 
opportunities. There are prescriptive components within OSH and environmental 
management, but there’s significant scope for self ‑regulation. These are avenues for 
businesses to improve efficiency, safety, and quality concurrently with a refined and 
adaptive outlook. It’s worth having an enquiring mind and asking whether a proposed 
change is a ‘need’ or a ‘want’. If needed, then it warrants investment which involves 
getting back to the fundamentals of HSE, efficiency and quality in design. Procedures 
and wearing PPE rely on people who are fallible with a full range of variability.
Humans are incredible innovators, planners, risk managers and capable of per‑
forming miracles if provided with a fertile environment. That’s often forgotten in 
everyday work. There won’t necessarily be a major ‘win’ every week but there can Towards High‑Reliability Organisations (HROs) 269
be smaller successes that characterise a job well done, such as a project completed 
by the team on an agreed understanding of what a ‘win’ looks and feels like. The 
same goes for receiving good news rather than being assessed and advised of minor 
non‑conformances that aren’t underpinned by realistic risk impact. This book is an 
invitation to risk‑based professionals to be more open to operational trust and human 
capability. The reason the author has learned so much over the last 20 years since 
PSM1 is an unwavering belief that operations have the best solutions to operational 
challenges and with this belief, turning up to site with an open mind.
Human endeavour should never be forgotten; in fact, it should be at the forefront 
of management systems. When the 12 boys from the Wild Boars football team were 
stuck in the Tham Luang Cave in Thailand after being trapped by heavy rains and 
floods in June 2018, the world watched on. Our collective mindset was that some‑
thing must be done. It wasn’t, it can’t be done. This group of children were intent 
on surviving and were incredibly resourceful and resilient. They were rescued after 
two agonising weeks because of the incredible dedication of the rescue team, volun‑
teers and the supporting community. The reason this wasn’t a miracle was that the 
outcome was a combination of brilliant risk management, exceptional competence 
and determination. The story is worth re‑reading. It makes us think deeply about our 
relationship with safety, risk and opportunity.
