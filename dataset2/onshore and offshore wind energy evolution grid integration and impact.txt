Wind energy is one of only two renewable energy sources that can potentially power the
world for all purposes multiple times over. The other is solar energy. The growth of wind has
been remarkable, as has its decline in cost. Transforming the world’s energy infrastructure to
address global warming, air pollution, and energy security problems requires the continued
growth of this clean, renewable energy resource. To that end, this book is an essential and
outstanding tool for professionals, technicians, policymakers, students, and interested lay
readers who are in the wind energy industry, work on wind-related topics, need to make
decisions regarding wind energy, or want to learn about it. This book contains not only case
studies but also appendices, questions and answers, and problems. An instructor’s manual
with solutions to the problems is also available.
The book methodically marches through the important aspects of wind energy. First up,
in Chapter 1, is a discussion of the difference between windmills and wind turbines and
of wind turbine development and installation to date. Chapter 2 details the power in the
wind, wind speed probability distributions, and wind resources. Chapter 3 covers everything
you want to know about wind turbine design and efficiency. Chapter 4 focuses on offshore
wind systems, including their foundations and transmission systems. Chapter 5 examines
the engineering of an offshore wind farm, including the spacing needed between wind tur￾bines. Chapter 6 moves on to discuss wind turbine operation and maintenance. Integrating
wind into the grid and dealing with wind’s variability are the subjects of Chapter 7. Lastly,
Chapter 8 is on the cost, material needs, and impacts on the environment and wildlife of wind
turbines.
Through this book, readers will gain the essential knowledge needed to help accelerate the
growth of wind energy but also to bust myths about it often amplified by its detractors. One
such myth is that wind turbines cause substantial bird deaths. Another is that large-scale
wind development will cause blackouts due to wind’s variability. A third is that wind farms
take up more land than coal generators and mines.

Readers will also have access to important data and equations necessary to analyze the
efficiency of wind turbines, to integrate wind farms into the electrical grid, and to ensure
that wind contributes to a reliable, clean, renewable energy future. Those who finish this
book will have gained a wealth of knowledge, arming them with the information needed to
speak accurately and authoritatively about all aspects of wind energy. It is time to start your
learning experience with this fantastic book. There is no time to waste!

The wind energy industry, offshore as well as onshore, is growing at a remarkable pace. To
many of us, it symbolizes a desire to harness one of nature’s most widespread sources of
renewable energy, exploiting a “fuel” that is eternal and carbon-free. This book presents a
concise account of large turbines and utility-scale wind energy aimed at a wide readership
including professionals, policymakers, and employees in the energy sector needing an appre￾ciation of the basic principles underlying wind energy or a quick update. Its style and level
will also appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as the large and grow￾ing number of thoughtful people who are interested in onshore and offshore wind farms
and the contribution they are making to electricity generation in the 21st century. The first
edition of this book, which was published in 2012, was one of the first books to emphasize
today’s exciting developments in offshore wind, and it was designed as an appetizer rather
than a formal textbook, with copious color photographs to illustrate the industry’s progress
as it moves, apparently inexorably, toward 1000 GW of global installed capacity.
The current second edition describes fundamental technical aspects of offshore wind with
new chapters on “Fundamentals of Offshore Systems” and on “Offshore Wind Engineer￾ing”. In addition, a new chapter on wind turbine “Operation and Maintenance” and greatly
expanded and updated chapters on “Grid Integration” and “Wind Energy Growth and Sus￾tainability” holistically cover the techno-economic and environmental-social aspects of wind
energy for the high growth envisioned in climate change mitigation scenarios.
The effective harnessing of wind power involves many aspects of engineering science,
from rotor aerodynamics to electrical generators, control systems, foundation structures,
resilience, reliability, and grid networks. We have tried to introduce this huge field in a
way that explains the essential theoretical background and indicates the main engineering
challenges. The overall tone is deliberately accessible rather than overly technical, but several
key topics, especially those pertaining to the emerging offshore wind turbine technologies,
are covered in sufficient technical detail for students of wind energy.
We hope the new edition will serve as an essential primary resource for entrants to the wind
energy industry needing an up-to-date appreciation of the subject. It also offers a unique
treatise on the sustainability of emerging transformative technologies, making it valuable

Following Paul Lynn’s lead in including color photographs in the first edition, illustrating
wind turbine beauty and extraordinary promise, we have added plenty more in this new
edition.
We also added a lot of material on off-shore wind and problems and solutions in each chapter
of this new edition.
Many of the materials presented in this book are based on the research work of our past
and current students, which includes undergraduate, master’s, and PhD students. A special
mention goes to Dr. Samet Ozturk, Zuoran Zhang, Ulvi Rahmanli, Sayan Bhattacharyya,
Dr. Aleem Mohammad, and Dr. Georgios Nikitas.
This second edition is dedicated to our wives, Christina and Paromita, for their love and
encouragement. Onshore and Offshore Wind Energy defines a pragmatic renewable energy
solution to the risks that climate change presents to our children and the generations that
follow, and we thank our children, Antonia, Menelaos, and Ishan, for being our constant
source of motivation for a book that is more about their generation than it is about ours.
This is a new area, and the technology development is very fast. Offshore turbines may not
only be sited in deeper waters and further offshore but also in seismic and typhoon zones.
Much of the information presented is expected to be outdated in the next few years, and the
book could need a new edition. There can also be errors and omissions in the book, and
we would like to know them. Please email us at Subhamoy.Bhattacharya@gmail.com and

1 Introduction
1.1 Wind energy and Planet Earth
Half a century ago, it would have taken a brave person to predict today’s extraordinary
renaissance of machines powered by the wind. Traditional windmills for milling grain and
pumping water had been largely consigned to technological history, overtaken by electric
motors fed from centralized power plants burning fossil fuels. But by a curious twist of his￾tory, large numbers of wind turbines, installed both onshore and offshore, are today injecting
energy into electricity grids for the benefit of us all and helping usher in a new age of renew￾able energy.
The background to this development is, of course, the massive redirection of energy policy
that most experts and politicians now agree is essential if Planet Earth is to survive the 21st
century in reasonable shape. For the last few hundred years, humans have been using up
fossil fuels that nature took around 400 million years to form and store underground. A
huge effort is now underway to develop and install energy systems that make use of natural
energy flows in the environment including wind and sunlight, with a major contribution from
large wind turbines. This is not simply a matter of fuel reserves, for it is becoming clearer by
the day that, even if those reserves were unlimited, we could not continue to burn them with
impunity. Today’s scientific consensus assures us that the resulting carbon dioxide emissions
would lead to a major environmental crisis. So the danger is now seen as a double-edged
sword: on the one side, fossil fuel depletion; and on the other, the increasing inability of the
natural world to absorb emissions caused by the burning of what fuel remains, leading to
accelerated climate change.
Back in the 1970s, there was very little public discussion about energy sources, including
electricity. In the industrialized world, we had become used to the idea that electricity is
generated in large, centralized power plants, preferably out of sight as well as mind, and
distributed to factories, offices, and homes by a grid network with far-reaching tentacles.
Few people had any idea how the electricity they took for granted was produced, or that the
burning of coal, oil, and gas was building up global environmental problems. Those who
were aware tended to assume that the advent of nuclear power would prove a panacea; a few

even claimed that nuclear electricity would be so cheap that it would not be worth metering!
It was all very reassuring and convenient—but, as we now realize, dangerously complacent.
Yet, even in those years, a few brave voices suggested that all was not well. In his famous
book Small is Beautiful,
1 first published in 1973, E.F. Schumacher poured scorn on the idea
that the problems of production in the industrialized world had been solved. Modern soci￾ety, he claimed, does not experience itself as part of nature, but as an outside force seeking
to dominate and conquer it. And it is the illusion of unlimited powers deriving from the
undoubted successes of much of modern technology that is the root cause of our present
difficulties. We are failing to distinguish between the capital and income components of the
Earth’s resources. We use up capital, including oil and gas reserves, as if they were a steady
and sustainable income. But they are once-and-only capital. It is like selling the family silver
and going on a binge.
Schumacher’s message, once ignored or derided by the majority, is now seen as mainstream.
For the good of Planet Earth and future generations, we have started to distinguish
between capital and income and to invest heavily in renewable technologies—including
wind energy—that produce electricity free of carbon emissions. The message was powerfully
reinforced by former US Vice President Al Gore, whose inspirational video in 2006 An
Inconvenient Truth2 has been watched by many millions of people around the world.
The fossil fuels laid down by solar energy over hundreds of millions of years must surely be
regarded as capital, but the winds that blow over the world’s land surfaces and oceans day by
day, year by year, and century by century are effectively free income to be used or ignored as
we wish. Nothing is “wasted” or exhausted if we don’t use it because it is there anyway. The
challenge for the future is to harness such renewable energy effectively, designing and creating
efficient and hopefully inspiring machines to serve humankind without disabling the planet.
This is a good moment to consider the meaning of renewable energy a little more carefully.
It implies energy that is sustainable in the sense of being available in the long term without
significantly depleting the Earth’s capital resources or causing environmental damage
that cannot readily be repaired by nature itself. In his excellent book A Solar Manifesto3
,
German politician Hermann Scheer considered Planet Earth in its totality as an energy
conversion system. He noted how, in its early stages, human society was itself the most
efficient energy converter, using food to produce muscle power and later enhancing this
with simple mechanical tools. Subsequent stages—releasing relatively large amounts of
energy by burning wood and focusing energy where it is needed by building sailing ships for
transport and windmills to grind grain and pump water—were still essentially renewable
activities in the above sense (Figure 1.1).
What really changed things was the 19th-century development of the steam engine for fac￾tory production and steam navigation. Here, almost at a stroke, the heat energy locked
in coal was converted into powerful and highly concentrated motion. The industrial soci￾ety was born. And ever since, we have continued burning coal, oil, and gas in ways which
pay no attention to the natural rhythms of the Earth and its ability to absorb wastes and
by-products, or to keep providing energy capital. Our approach has become the opposite of
renewable, and it is high time to change priorities (Figure 1.2).
It would, however, be unfair to pretend that renewable energy is an easy answer. For a start,
it is diffuse and intermittent. Often, it is unpredictable. And although the “fuel” is free
and the waste products are minimal, up-front investment costs tend to be large. There are

certainly major challenges to be faced and overcome as we move toward a new energy mix
for the 21st century.
Our story now moves on to modern wind energy, which is already one of the most mature
of the renewable technologies, and still advancing rapidly. But before getting involved in the
details, we should consider the gift of a global wind resource that is helping wean us away
from our addiction to fossil fuels (Figure 1.3).
1.2 Winds of the world
The winds of the world are produced by the Sun’s uneven heating of the Earth’s atmosphere
and may be thought of as a form of solar energy. Variations in atmospheric pressure caused
by differential heating propel air from high-pressure to low-pressure regions, generating
winds that are also greatly affected by the Earth’s rotation and surface geography.4 On a
large scale, they may be broadly divided into latitudinal and longitudinal patterns.
The most consistent latitudinal wind patterns are found over the great oceans of the world,
well away from large land masses and mountain ranges. For many centuries, the captains of
sailing ships depended on reliable trade winds to speed them on their way, trying to avoid the
horse latitudes at around 30∘ north and south and the equatorial doldrums that threatened to
becalm them for days on end. It is hardly surprising that wind meteorology exercised some
famous minds throughout the great age of sail. Edmond Halley (1656–1742), an English
astronomer best known for computing the orbit of Halley’s comet, published his ideas on
the formation of trade winds in 1686, following an astronomical expedition to the island of

St. Helena in the South Atlantic. The atmospheric mechanism proposed by George Hadley
(1685–1768), a lawyer who dabbled productively in meteorology, attempted to include the
effects of the Earth’s rotation—a theory that was subsequently corrected and refined by
American meteorologist William Ferrel (1817–1891).
The contributions of Hadley and Ferrel to our understanding of latitudinal wind patterns
are acknowledged in the names given to atmospheric “cells” shown in Figure 1.4, which illus￾trates major wind belts encircling the planet. Essentially, these are generated by the steady
reduction in solar radiation from the equator to the poles. The associated winds, rather than
flowing northward or southward as we might expect, deflect to the east or west in line with
the Coriolis effect, named after French engineer Gaspard Coriolis (1792–1843), who showed
that a mass (in this case, of air) moving in a rotating system (the Earth) experiences a force
acting perpendicular to both the direction of motion and the axis of rotation.4
The Hadley cells—closed loops of air circulation—begin near the equator as warm air is
lifted and carried toward the poles. At around 30∘ latitude, north and south, they descend
as cool air and return to complete the loop, producing the northeast and southeast trade
winds that have had such a major historical impact on ships sailing between Europe and
the Americas. A similar mechanism produces polar cells in the Arctic and Antarctic regions,
giving rise to polar easterlies. If you live in northwest Europe, you will know all about freezing
winter winds from Siberia!
The Ferrel cells of the mid-latitudes, sandwiched between the Hadley and polar cells, are
less well-defined and far less stable. Meandering high-level jet streams tend to form at their
boundaries with the Hadley cells, generating localized passing weather systems. This makes
the coastal wind patterns of countries such as Denmark, Germany, and Britain famously
variable. So although the prevailing winds are westerlies, they are often displaced by flows
from other points of the compass, especially during the winter months.

Temperature and pressure gradients caused by the Sun also drive longitudinal “cells” that
produce their own wind patterns. For example, there is a vast loop of winds over the Pacific
Ocean known as the Walker Circulation, named after Sir Gilbert Walker, who, in the early
20th century, tried to predict Indian monsoon winds. The loop is caused by differences in
surface temperature between the eastern and western Pacific and normally produces easterly
trade winds, exerting major influences on the climates of southeast Asia and the western
coasts of the Americas.
In general, we see that the complexity of the world’s major wind patterns, illustrated in
Figure 1.5, is the result of air rising over warmer areas of oceans and continents and
subsiding over cooler ones. The effects occur at all scales over the Earth’s surface, from
the vastnesses of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans and the Sahara Desert down
to mid-scale phenomena that generate famous winds such as the Mistral in France, the
Chinook in North America, and the Harmattan in West Africa.
When we come to consider the wind regimes of smaller regions or countries, the patterns
of Figure 1.5 are increasingly modified by local geography. Although it certainly helps to
keep the big picture in mind, conditions are often affected by hills and mountains, valleys,
forests, and variations in terrain—as well as by the time of day and season of the year.4, 5
Coastal areas often experience “sea breezes” that carry air ashore during the day, followed
by opposite “land breezes” at night, powered by the fluctuating temperatures caused by the
different thermal capacities of the land and the sea.
Some of the above points are illustrated in Figure 1.6, which shows a typical wind distri￾bution during the summer months over the UK and Ireland, two of the windiest nations
in Europe. The main flow is from the Atlantic, corresponding to the prevailing westerlies,
but a complex low-pressure feature (a depression) over Scotland, driven by a high-altitude
Jetstream, produces localized winds that tend to circle anticlockwise. On a day such as this,

not all UK and Irish wind turbines face the same way! In winter, the main flow quite often
swings easterly and comes from the Arctic via continental Europe. On top of these broad
seasonal effects, winds in a particular location can be greatly affected by local geography.
What does this highly complex story tell us about generating large amounts of electricity
from the wind? There are several points that bear on turbine design and installation. Highly
variable wind patterns such as those of northwest Europe demand turbines that can align
themselves easily with the flow. If turbines are placed in clusters, the shadowing effect of each
on its neighbors may be quite serious when the wind blows from certain directions—a point
needing careful consideration during the planning phase. Generally speaking, offshore wind
farms are less problematic than onshore locations, for if installed well out to sea they are
more likely to find themselves in the consistent company of prevailing winds, undisturbed
by land features (Figure 1.7).
The unpredictability of wind means that commercial developers of large turbines go to con￾siderable lengths to assess a site’s actual potential,5 monitoring and recording variations in
speed and direction over a year or more before proceeding with installation. The winds of
the world remain wild and free—and it will always be a challenge to harness their power as
efficiently and economically as possible.
1.3 From windmills to wind turbines
Windmills have a long and venerable history. Some of the earliest practical machines,
developed in Persia around the 10th century, were based on rectangular sails rotating

about vertical axis. Windmill technology subsequently spread through the Middle East
into southern Europe, and by the late 12th century, windmills were being built in England,
Holland, and Germany, where horizontal axis machines were always preferred.4
Although “windmill” implies a machine devoted to the milling or grinding of wheat and
other grains, another application proved extremely valuable over the centuries—pumping
water to drain low-lying land. The Dutch became world-renowned for using windmills to
help reclaim large areas of land from the North Sea, and English farmers drained land in
East Anglia. Many other nations contributed to developing highly effective windmills for
grinding grain, pumping water, and other mechanical tasks. Around a quarter of a million
windmills were installed over the centuries in Western Europe, and although many experts
put their heyday in the years 1750–1850, there were still tens of thousands in operation at
the start of the 20th century.
We see that windmills were a major source of mechanical energy in Europe before the Indus￾trial Revolution gathered pace. Replacing or supplementing the muscle power of humans and
animals, they were an important part of the economic, social, and cultural landscape. The
flour miller was a key member of many communities; stories of millers and their families
abounded in local folklore; and windmills entered the canon of European literature—never
more famously than in Cervantes’ Don Quixote (1605/15), whose romantic but delusional
hero attacked a set of Spanish windmills believing them to be ferocious giants. Don Quixote’s
imaginary enemies survive to this day in the central Spanish region of La Mancha, carefully
restored and eagerly sought by tourists (see Figure 1.8).
The highly variable winds of northwest Europe, already mentioned in the previous section,
demanded windmills that could easily be turned to face the wind. In early post mills, the

complete timber structure turned on a vertical post; in later tower mills, also known as
smock mills, most of the building remained stationary, and only the top section, or cap,
rotated. Tower mills could be built higher and heavier than post mills, allowing them to
support larger sails. As the years went by, increasingly sophisticated features were incor￾porated: secondary rotors, known as fantails, to turn the cap into the wind automatically;
sails (or blades) with a degree of twist to increase efficiency; and in some advanced designs,
speed governors (Figure 1.9).
It was also essential to protect against violent winds because, as we shall explain later, the
power intercepted by a windmill rotor is proportional to the cube of the wind speed. A dou￾bling of speed increases the power eight times; a trebling, 27 times. This could spell disaster.
Various approaches were used to prevent damage including reducing the area of sailcloth
covering lattice blades, designing blades with tiltable wooden shutters that could spill the
wind, and a variety of mechanisms, manual and automatic, to turn the rotor blades away
from the oncoming blast. By the end of the 19th century, European windmills had achieved
a high level of technical sophistication.
Various numbers of main blades were tried, including 6, 8, and 12, but over the years a
consensus developed that four-bladed designs represented the best compromise between
construction and maintenance costs, rotor weight, and performance. By the 18th century,
it was well understood that the speed of the blade tips should ideally be kept proportional
to the wind speed and that the mechanical power developed was proportional to the area
“swept” by the rotor. Taken together, these factors mean that a large windmill is necessar￾ily a low-speed machine developing a high torque on its main shaft, but smaller windmills
operate at relatively high speed and low torque (Figure 1.10).

In the mid-19th century, a range of smaller machines known as American windmills were
developed as pumps for watering livestock, irrigating land, and supplying water for steam
engines on the American railroads. With multibladed steel rotors mounted on lattice towers,
they featured self-regulating mechanisms to turn them away from damaging high winds and
could be left unattended. Hundreds of thousands were installed by the 1930s. Similar designs
are still manufactured around the world today, mainly used in remote locations lacking a
convenient electricity supply.
It was inevitable that the Industrial Revolution would sooner or later spell the demise of the
traditional tower windmill. Steam engines, and subsequently internal combustion engines,
could supply highly concentrated power on demand at any time of day or night, unaffected
by the vagaries of the wind. Electric motors offered highly convenient power for grinding
grain and pumping water. So, by the mid-20th century, it was rare to find a traditional wind￾mill spinning its sails delightfully in the breeze.
Yet even as the tower windmill continued its remorseless decline, developments in electrical
technology began to inspire imaginative engineers with the idea of using the wind to generate
electricity.4 One of the earliest and most remarkable designs for driving an electrical gener￾ator with a windmill saw the light of day in 1888, when Charles Brush erected a pioneering
machine in the backyard of his home in Cleveland, Ohio (see Figure 1.11). It is clear that
Mr. Brush did not do things by halves. A multibladed rotor 17 m in diameter was kept facing
the wind by a large tail vane. A 12-kW dynamo, driven at 50 times rotor speed, charged a
battery bank that fed various motors and hundreds of incandescent lights in his home over
the next 15 years. This was one of the first machines that could properly be described as a
wind turbine.
The following decades produced many new designs for electricity generation. Danish inven￾tor Poul La Cour built over 100 machines in the period 1891–1918, with power ratings up
to 35 kW. Large numbers of smaller machines, in many ways the natural successors to the
American wind pump, were used in the USA and elsewhere to charge batteries and pro￾vide modest amounts of electricity for farmsteads and other remote locations. As the 20th
century progressed, there was a trend toward using blades with true airfoil shapes based on
ideas gained from the fast-developing aircraft industry. By the late 1930s, the 1-MW power
landmark had been exceeded by a single machine—the famous two-bladed Smith–Putnam
turbine installed in Vermont, USA.4
However, one of the most influential machines in the story of modern wind power was
the somewhat later 200-kW turbine built in 1957 in Gedser, a windswept coastal region of
Denmark (see Figure 1.12). Designed and built by Johannes Juul, the Gedser turbine used
automatic stall control to limit rotor power output and speed in high winds and incorpo￾rated emergency aerodynamic tip brakes, deployed by centrifugal force to prevent damage
in extreme conditions. Its inbuilt safety features kept it running reliably for 11 years, and it
was refurbished in 1975 at NASA’s request to provide valuable data for the USA’s developing
wind energy program. This remarkable machine presaged many aspects of modern turbine
design and helped cement Denmark’s reputation for innovation in wind energy, which con￾tinues to this day.
In spite of the technical advances of the Smith–Putnam and especially the Gedser turbines,
the 30 years following World War II were a lean period for international wind energy. It was
generally assumed that cheap fossil fuels, plus the advent of nuclear power, would “keep the
lights on” into the indefinite future, and the idea that wind turbines could make a significant

contribution to global electricity generation was little more than a pipe dream for enthusi￾asts. Yet by the mid-1970s, the emerging environmental movement was starting to challenge
official complacency about energy supplies, and the first “oil shock” emphasized the deter￾mination of oil-producing nations in the Middle East to exert greater control over the price
and availability of their “black gold.”
At this point, the US administration under President Jimmy Carter started serious sup￾port for renewable energy technologies, including wind. A number of large turbine projects
were financed and, perhaps more importantly, a new legal framework was introduced requir￾ing electric utilities to allow turbine connection to the grid. By the early 1980s, the state of
California—true to its reputation as an enthusiast for technical adventures—accommodated
thousands of wind turbines with a combined power rating of more than a gigawatt, and
installations in the windswept Altamont Pass achieved international status as harbingers of
a new age of wind. However, all was not well: although imported Danish machines gen￾erally performed satisfactorily, other designs proved unreliable; when government support
was subsequently withdrawn by the unsympathetic Reagan administration, the initial “wind
rush” ground to a halt. International wind power’s center of gravity now moved back across
the Atlantic to Europe, and especially to Denmark and Germany.
Many turbine designs and configurations have been tried and tested over the years, includ￾ing one-bladed and two-bladed rotors mounted both upwind and downwind of the support
tower, and a variety of vertical axis machines. However, the vast majority of today’s large
turbines are horizontal axis machines with a three-bladed rotor upwind of the tower, sup￾ported by a housing, or nacelle, containing a gearbox and electrical generator. The turbines
previously shown in Figures 1.1–1.3, and 1.7 all have this configuration, and a typical layout
of the main components is illustrated in Figure 1.13. The rotor is kept facing the wind (or
deliberately turned away from it) by a yaw motor, and a brake is provided to prevent rotation,

So far we have concentrated on the development of large wind turbines—the main focus of
this book—but smaller machines suitable for individual homes, farms, and leisure applica￾tions have a parallel history. Although their total impact on electricity generation is very
modest compared with today’s large wind farms, they are highly valued by individuals and
organizations wishing to generate relatively small amounts of electricity in remote locations
and are well-described elsewhere.5
We now move on from this brief history of wind energy to consider how the enthusiasm
of its pioneers, often criticized or dismissed by conventional voices, has developed into a
worldwide industry with high hopes for the future (Figure 1.14).

1.4 Power, energy, and performance
Many people are confused about how much electricity wind turbines actually generate and
what contribution they make to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The basic issue is wind
energy’s intermittency. Professional engineers and scientists are quite used to dealing with
it, understanding that turbine output and performance can only be sensibly discussed in
terms of statistical averages over significant time scales. But the general public, fully aware
that turbines stop turning when the wind dies, wonder what is going on and need assurance
that today’s wind technology is what it claims to be. Their uncertainty is played upon by
climate-change skeptics, many with vested interests in opposing renewable energy.
In many ways, this seems strange. After all, solar panels are not generally criticized because
the Sun disappears at night; nor water reservoirs when they run dry during droughts; nor
conventional power plants because they often operate below full output—and occasionally
have to shut down. Most of our inventions and machines are only used intermittently. Per￾haps, wind turbines’ misfortune is to be so visible: no wind, no power, no movement!
We will tackle such issues by quantifying turbine performance from a general point of view
and relating it to the electricity consumption of households. This will help set the scene for
a discussion of wind energy’s international status and future potential. However, before we
start, it is extremely important to realize that large electricity grids are not concerned with
the intermittency of individual turbines, or even of wind farms, unless they are very large.
What matters is the total generation by all wind farms, which are normally spread over a wide
area and experience different wind conditions. Although total wind generation is certainly
variable, it is not “on–off” like that of an individual turbine, and intermittency is a minor

concern to the grid system as a whole. Of course, this is not to say it is trivial from the point of
view of turbine design and annual energy production. The owners and operators of turbines
are certainly interested in how much electricity their machines produce!
For over a century, advances in wind engineering have resulted in turbines of increased size
and power rating. As already noted, Charles Brush’s windmill of 1888 (see Figure 1.11)
drove a 12-kW dynamo; the Gedser turbine of 1957 (Figure 1.12) was rated at 200 kW;
and although the Smith–Putnam machine4 of the 1940s managed to exceed the 1-MW land￾mark, it was so far before its time that another half-century passed before megawatt turbines
became commonplace. Now things have moved on again, and we are quite used to the idea
of individual turbines rated at 2 or 5 MW, with some 10-MW machines already installed
offshore and even larger designs glinting in the eyes of turbine designers.
How do such power ratings relate to wind energy’s practical contribution to national and
global electricity supplies? A key point is also an obvious one: a turbine only generates its
full-rated power when the wind reaches, or exceeds, a certain speed. Much of the time it
produces considerably less power. Given an onshore site with a good wind regime, the average
power output of a large modern turbine is around 30% of its rated maximum. For example,
a turbine rated at 2 MW typically produces an average of about 0.6 MW, measured day and
night over a complete year. The precise percentage, referred to as the capacity factor or load
factor, depends on the technical efficiency of the turbine and the quality of the site, which
may be affected by features such as hills, forests, or rough terrain that impede or disturb the
airflow. Generally speaking, offshore turbines do better than onshore ones, reaching capacity
factors well above 40% in some cases.
Turbine manufacturers and electric utilities rarely mention capacity factors, probably
regarding them as too technical for the general public. Instead, they try to relate turbine
performance to personal experience by comparing the amount of electricity produced with
household demand. For example, in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, a 1-MW
onshore turbine is often stated to meet the needs of around 600 households. No doubt this
is a reasonable way of explaining things to consumers, but it is obvious that a wind turbine
cannot supply households on an hour-by-hour or day-by-day basis because the wind does
not blow to order. Supply and demand are often out of step, and this can lead to confusion.
It would be more accurate to say “over an average year” the 1-MW turbine generates
electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of about 600 households. But this is rather
a mouthful, and its subtleties would probably be lost on most people (Figure 1.15).
In any case, there are several reasons to treat such estimates with caution:
■ The annual electricity production of a particular type of turbine (and therefore the
number of “households equivalent”) is site-dependent and fluctuates to some extent
from year to year due to the variable nature of wind.
■ Small but significant power losses occur during transmission, especially when turbines
are placed far from consumers.
■ Consumption of electricity by households tends to increase year-by-year as living stan￾dards rise.
■ Consumption patterns within a country often vary considerably from region to region
and between city and rural communities (so which “households” are being used in the
calculation?).
■ It is also worth noting that average household electricity consumption varies greatly
from country to country. For example, the average USA figure is roughly twice that of
Western Europe.

Figure 1.15 Delivering power, energy, and performance: a 5-MW offshore wind turbine (Source: with
permission of Repower).
We see that estimates of “households equivalent” are necessarily approximate. This is not to
say they are wrong, simply that they rely on certain assumptions and are subject to statistical
variation. Used sensibly, they give an easily understood indication of turbine performance.
In the discussion that follows, it is important to remember that power is a rate of energy pro￾duction or consumption and therefore has dimensions of (energy/time). Conversely, energy
has dimensions of (power × time). To take a familiar example, if an electric heater is rated
at 1000 W or 1 kW, this is the amount of power it consumes when switched on. If left on
for one hour, the energy used is 1 kWh (generally referred to as 1 “unit” of electricity). A
2-kW heater switched on for half an hour also uses 1 kWh of energy—power is being con￾sumed at twice the rate but for only half the time. As householders, it is the energy we pay
for, expressed in kWh or units of electricity. When assessing the contribution made by wind
power to electricity generation, the key quantity is annual energy production.
We may describe the annual energy production of a turbine in terms of its rated power and
capacity factor. For a turbine rated at Pr MW operating at a capacity factor Cf , the average
power output, measured over a complete year, is given by:
Pav = (Pr × Cf )MW (1.1)
Since there are 8760 hours in a year, the turbine’s annual energy production Ea is
Ea = (8760 × Pav)MWh
= (8760 × Pr × Cf )MWh (1.2)
17

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseOnshore and Offshore Wind Energy
For example, a machine rated at 2 MW, operating at a capacity factor of 30%, is expected to
generate about 8760 × 2 × 0.3 = 5256 MWh per year.
Alternatively, the capacity factor may be estimated if we know the turbine’s rated power and
the annual amount of energy it produces:
Cf = Ea∕(8760 × Pr) (1.3)
As we move up the power scale from individual turbines to wind farms, and then on to
national and global electricity production, the numbers increase dramatically, and it is often
more convenient to work with gigawatts or even terawatts. The various units for measuring
power are related as follows:
1000 W = 1kW (kilowatt) 1000kW = 1MW (megawatt)
1000MW = 1GW (gigawatt) 1000GW = 1TW (terawatt)
There is a corresponding set of units for energy, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh),
megawatt-hours (MWh), gigawatt-hours (GWh), and terawatt-hours (TWh).
Figure 1.16 shows some typical power and energy figures for electrical consumption and
generation. Power is expressed either as a rated (peak) value or as an average measured over
a complete year. Energy is shown as an annual total. The various items are:
■ Household. The average power consumption of Western European households,
measured night and day over a complete year, is about 0.5 kW. Since there are
8760 hours in a year, this corresponds to an annual energy consumption of about
0.5 × 8760 = 4380 kWh = 4.4 MWh. (Peak power consumption depends on how
many appliances are switched on simultaneously and is not normally of great
interest—provided the household’s fuses are not tripped!)
■ 2-MW onshore turbine. The peak (rated) power is 2 MW and assuming a 30%
capacity factor the average power is 0.6 MW, producing annual energy of
8760 × 0.6 = 5256 MWh = 5.256 GWh. This is equivalent to the annual electricity
requirements of about 5256/4.4 = 1200 households.
■ 5-MW offshore turbine. With a peak power of 5 MW and a 40% capacity factor, the
average power is 2 MW giving an annual energy of 8760 × 2=17,520 MWh=17.52 GWh,
equivalent to about 4000 households.
■ 1-GW conventional power plant. Large modern power plants (fossil fuel or nuclear)
are typically rated between 1 and 2 GW. This is their peak power and also,
in principle, their average power assuming continuous operation at maximum
output. However, in practice, their capacity factors are less than 100% and
we will use 90% as a typical figure. So in a full year, the output of a 1-GW
plant is about 8760 × 0.9 GWh = 7.9 TWh, equivalent to the needs of about
7,900,000/4.4 = 1,800,000 Western European households. This puts into perspective
the challenge of substituting wind power for conventional power plants: about 450
very large offshore turbines, rated at 5 MW, are needed to produce annual electricity
equivalent to a 1 GW conventional power plant.

Note that we have given values in Figure 1.16 to two significant figures. Generally speaking,
the accuracy of wind energy calculations, and of statistical data relating to household elec￾tricity usage, does not justify more (unfortunately values are sometimes given to four or five
significant figures, implying unwarranted accuracy).
Of course, the wind does not blow to order, and there is often a mismatch between electrical
supply and demand. This is why it is so important to distinguish between a turbine’s
peak power and its average power over a complete year. Intermittency and variability
are features of all renewable energy technologies that harness natural energy flows in the
environment—wind, solar, tide, and wave. However, the variability of renewable energy is
drastically decreased when different sources of renewable energy are coupled together. One
of the major challenges of wind engineering is to integrate variable generation successfully
into grid networks that supply a wide range of industrial and domestic consumers who
hardly notice when the wind blows!

Table 1.1 puts the discussion into context with technical data from six wind farms. The top
four are onshore installations in the USA, China, Spain, and Germany; the bottom two lie
off the coasts of the UK and Denmark. The selection is intended to illustrate an interesting
range of sites, turbine numbers and sizes, capacity factors, and “households equivalent.” It
is certainly not intended as a comparison between different countries and their expertise in
wind energy.
We first note the large range of turbine numbers, sizes, and total rated power (between
25 and 735 MW). When discussing wind farms, or national wind power totals, the total
rated power is also widely referred to as the installed capacity. Estimated (or measured)
annual energy totals range between 78 and 1690 GWh, and the estimated number of
“households equivalent” is between 17,500 and 200,000. The capacity factors are partic￾ularly interesting: 25–27% for three onshore sites, but an impressive 36% for the German
installation consisting of a few large modern turbines on a flat site next to the coast. The
two offshore farms achieved 40% and 44%, underlining the benefits of placing turbines
out to sea.
The estimates of the number of households supplied for each megawatt of installed capacity
(“households per MW”) show large variations, partly due to differences in turbines and
wind regimes from one site to another, but mainly to differences in average household
consumption between countries. Most striking is the contrast between the wind farms
in Texas, USA (245 households/MW), and in Rudong, China (1000 households/MW),
reflecting the far greater electricity consumption in the USA. Once again, we see that
“households equivalent” needs careful interpretation.
Wind energy’s potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is often mentioned in the
press and on various websites. But this, too, turns out to be a tricky issue. Certainly, electricity
generated by the wind offsets or replaces electricity produced by other means. But which
means? In a country such as Norway with its abundant supplies of hydropower, does new
wind turbine capacity replace hydroelectric generation, with its very low attendant carbon

emissions? In India and China, currently burning a great deal of coal in conventional power
plants, do more wind turbines mean less coal burning? Many countries produce electricity
from a range of fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewables. The environmental benefits of
wind energy must clearly depend on the energy strategy and current “energy mix” of the
country concerned. No wonder, the claims made for carbon dioxide reductions by wind and
other renewable technologies differ widely. It is a lot simpler to stay with comparisons based
on electricity generation!
1.5 Coming up-to-date
It is now time to outline the international status of wind energy, the challenges it currently
faces, and the issues that will affect its future. We focus initially on the worldwide growth of
the industry, paying particular attention to countries that are using large turbines to spear￾head the surge in installed capacity, both onshore and offshore.6 To make sense of the figures,
we must first be clear about how data on wind power and energy is presented.
A country’s wind power capacity is generally expressed in terms of installed megawatts
(MW), equal to the total rated power of all its wind turbines. This figure is often supported
by estimates of annual energy production measured in gigawatt-hours per year (GWh/yr).
For example, in 2023 Germany had a cumulative installed capacity of about 59 GW, yield￾ing about 140,000 GWh/yr. Recalling that a Western European household typically uses
4.5 MWh/yr, this translates into the needs of about 140 × 1012/4.5 × 106 = 31 million house￾holds. It is certainly an impressive figure although we must remember that householders are
not the only consumers of electricity. Much is needed by industry, commerce, and public ser￾vices, and in modern developed economies household consumption typically accounts for
around 30% of the total.
Naturally, the numbers are even bigger for global wind. As of 2023, cumulative global
onshore wind capacity stood at about 842 GW onshore plus 64 GW offshore, yielding
some 2100 TWh/yr. Using Equation (1.3), these figures can be used to estimate the average
capacity factor of the world’s 2023 stock of wind turbines:
Cf = Ea∕(8760 × Pr) = 2100 × 1012∕(8760 × 906 × 109
) = 0.26 = 26% (1.4)
This covers machines installed over many years in many countries with a wide range of wind
regimes. The continuing trend toward larger and more efficient turbines, probably with an
increasing proportion installed offshore, means that the “global” capacity factor is expected
to nudge steadily upward in the years ahead.
The meteoric increase in the world’s cumulative installed capacity6 is illustrated in
Figure 1.17. Back in 1995, the figure was about 5 GW, and it kept increasing by around 30%
per annum during 1995–2010 and by about 20% during 2010–2023.
But we must not get carried away—at least, not yet. Electricity generated by the wind still
provides only about 7% of global demand. True, there are big differences between coun￾tries: Denmark, the leader, currently gets 55% of its electricity from the wind; Germany
gets 32%, Ireland 35%, Greece 19%, USA 10%, China 7.5%, and India 4.4%. Some other
countries with large populations have virtually no wind turbines—yet. Table 1.2 shows the
“top 10” in order of cumulative installed capacity as of 2023, showing China in the lead

with almost 40% of the total. All countries on the list have certainly been very ambitious in
promoting and installing wind turbines over the past few years. Emerging markets in Latin
America—especially Brazil—and Asia—especially India—are now taking off.
But ambition is certainly not confined to the major players.
Denmark’s installed capacity of 1250 W per head of population is remarkable. It is equivalent
to every Danish man, woman, and child having their own personal wind turbine rated at
1.2 kW—or indeed rather more, because small machines almost always operate with lower
capacity factors than large ones. A turbine to generate this much power in strong winds
would need a rotor diameter of about 1.8 m, not the easiest thing for every citizen to mount
on a domestic roof or tall pole in the garden! However, Denmark’s vision has resulted so far
in generating 55% of its total electricity using wind turbines, both onshore and offshore.
One of today’s hottest topics in wind energy is the development of offshore systems
(Figure 1.18); this book devotes Chapters 4 and 5 to offshore technology and project
development.

Figure 1.18 Wind energy moves offshore (Source: with permission of Repower).
Until quite recently, the extra challenges and costs of anchoring turbines to the seabed and
bringing their power ashore seemed daunting. But two major issues have changed the con￾sensus view. First, as wind energy grows, new onshore sites in leading wind energy countries
inevitably become scarcer—sometimes for technical reasons including a lack of good wind
regimes, but also because of public resistance to the erection of turbines near homes or in
locations with high landscape value.
The second issue is far more positive. Developments in turbine design and technology are
leading to highly reliable and efficient machines rated at 8 MW or more, and their deploy￾ment offshore looks increasingly attractive. Better wind regimes, coupled with the improved
technical efficiency of very large turbines, help offset the undoubtedly higher costs of instal￾lation and maintenance in a marine environment. Offshore wind capacity currently accounts
for only about 7% of the global total; 10 years ago, it was only 2% and is poised to rise in the
coming years. The countries most active in this area are China, UK, Germany, Denmark,
and the Netherlands (Figure 1.19).
So far, we have focused on the growth of installed capacity, national and global, onshore
and offshore. Recent experience and future projections are full of optimism. But as global
wind energy moves inexorably onward, what are the major technical interests and concerns
of the engineers and other professionals behind this inspiring modern industry? We may
group them under several headings:
◼ Turbine and system design and development. The average rated capacity of large new
turbines is presently about 8 MW and continues to rise, giving increased technical
efficiencies and economies of scale. Among the components and systems undergoing

constant development are blade airfoils to suit a variety of wind regimes, very long
turbine blades for high-power machines, drive trains including gearboxes, electrical
generators including low-speed designs for direct coupling to rotors, and advanced
electronic systems for turbine monitoring and control.
◼ Offshore challenges. The marine environment poses special challenges for wind turbines
including the design, manufacture, and placement of towers and seabed anchorages,
effective protection against corrosion and storm conditions at sea, and transport and
installation of very large rotors and nacelles.
◼ Grid integration and expansion. For over a hundred years, electricity grids in developed
countries have been designed to distribute the electricity generated by large, centralized
power plants. The advent of wind and other renewables injects an increasing percent￾age of smaller-scale, decentralized generation, often in quite different locations. Grid
networks must be adapted and expanded. Transmission systems must cope with fluc￾tuating generation, a growing challenge as wind’s share of total generation increases.
Offshore, the economics of wind power depend greatly on the provision of efficient
cable connections and hubs, including shared international distribution—for example,
in countries bordering the North Sea. For a comprehensive picture of grid integration
challenges and solutions, see Chapter 7.
◼ Planning and public acceptance. Planning procedures for wind power developments
vary greatly between countries. If complex and time consuming, they can act as seri￾ous inhibitors to growth. Closely connected is the delicate issue of public acceptance
and the degree to which governments allow their citizens to influence planning deci￾sions. There are also important issues of public education and information, community
involvement, and possible compensation for loss of property values.
◼ Environmental issues. The environmental credentials of wind energy are beyond doubt,
but there are also concerns. The visual impact of large land-based turbines and wind
farms is probably the most serious. Others include turbine noise, bird and bat fatalities,
and, in the case of offshore installations, effects on marine conservation and fishing.
We will discuss this in detail in Chapter 8 (Figure 1.20).

carbon emissions while at the same time enhancing energy security. From a historical per￾spective, the story of practical “windmills” that began over a thousand years ago in the
Middle East is embarked on a remarkable new chapter.

2 Capturing the wind
2.1 Wind speed and power
A wind turbine must capture as much of the wind’s power as possible, convert it efficiently
into electricity, and protect itself against damage in violent weather. Performance depends
crucially on the conditions at a particular site including the wind’s average speed and vari￾ability and the occurrence of extreme events.
We start by considering how much power impinges on a turbine rotor placed in a steady
airstream. A well-known equation of fluid mechanics gives this as
P = 0.5𝜌AU3 (2.1)
where 𝜌 is the density of the air, A is the area of the intercepted airstream (equal to the area
“swept” by the rotor), and U is the speed of the wind. In standard conditions (sea level,
temperature 15∘C), the density of air is 1.225 kg/m3. So the amount of power intercepted by
each square meter of rotor is
P = 0.612 U3 watts (2.2)
For example, if the wind speed is 6 m/s (a moderate breeze), the power intercepted per square
meter is 0.612 × 63 = 132 W; but if the speed rises to 24 m/s (a severe gale), the power becomes
0.612 × 243 = 8460 W. This massive increase is due to the cubic relationship between speed
and power given by Equation (2.2).
We have used the word “intercepted” rather than “captured” because the above figures relate
to the power in the wind, not the amount actually extracted by a turbine rotor. As we shall
see later, there are fundamental limitations to rotor efficiency and large modern turbines
typically capture up to about 50% of the wind power presented to them.
The density of air varies with both elevation and temperature. Cold air at sea level is con￾siderably denser than warm air at a high upland site. A turbine produces more power in
the winter than in the summer, in winds of the same speed. Differences of 10% or more can

occur between different sites or at the same site between summer and winter, so elevations
and temperatures should be considered when predicting energy yields.
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the cubic relationship between wind speed and power
is the single most important factor affecting wind turbine design and performance, for sev￾eral reasons:
■ A wind turbine has to operate over a huge range of wind power levels. For example,
it may be designed to cut in and start generating when the wind speed reaches 4 m/s
and cut out to prevent damage at 24 m/s. This 6:1 range of wind speeds corresponds
to a 216:1 range of intercepted power that the turbine must convert efficiently into
electricity.
■ The cubic relationship also means that short periods of strong wind contribute dis￾proportionately to a turbine’s annual energy output. In the above example, a single
hour of severe gale possesses as much energy as 216 hours—nine days and nights—of
moderate breeze.
■ The suitability of a particular site, onshore or offshore, is often discussed in terms of its
average or mean wind speed. Although this is a key indicator, speed variability is also
important. The cubic relationship means that “gusty” sites generally produce more
annual electricity than “steady” ones with the same average wind speed.
■ Wind turbines need reliable safety systems to prevent damage in extreme winds. If a
machine that is designed to cut out at 24 m/s fails to do so and a 35 m/s storm develops,
the intercepted power increases threefold and may threaten disaster.
The above points are illustrated and amplified by Figure 2.1 showing the all-important cubic
relationship between wind power and speed. Power is given in kilowatts per square meter of
intercepted area (kW/m2). Speed is indicated in meters per second (m/s), and also in knots
(nautical miles per hour), which are often used to measure wind strengths at sea. The rela￾tionship between various units of speed is
1 m∕s = 1.95 knots = 3.60 kph = 2.24 mph (2.3)

For convenience, it is helpful to remember that the speed in knots is very close to twice its
value in meters per second.
Also shown is the Beaufort Scale used by sailors and meteorologists to describe wind
strengths at sea. We have included Beaufort numbers 1–9 and indicated some of the
corresponding descriptive terms against the curve. For example, Beaufort Force 4, with
an average wind speed of 6.7 m/s, is described as a “moderate breeze.” Beaufort Force 9,
with an average speed of 22.6 m/s, is a “severe gale.” Not shown are Force 10 (“storm”), 11
(“violent storm”), and 12 (“hurricane”), which are dangerous territory for wind turbines.
The horizontal bar at the top of the figure indicates typical cut-in and cut-out speeds of a
large wind turbine, together with the speed at which it reaches its rated (peak) output power.
Between cut-in and rated speeds, we expect the power generated to follow an approximately
cubic curve; between rated speed and cut-out, it stays close to the rated value. Turbine manu￾facturers provide tables, or graphs, showing the electrical power produced by their machines
at different wind speeds. A typical power curve for a 2-MW turbine is shown in Figure 2.2. Its
precise form depends on the machine’s efficiency at capturing winds of different speeds and
on the systems—aerodynamic and electrical—that are designed to protect it from damage
as it approaches cut-out.
We have already emphasized that short periods of strong wind, well above average speed,
contribute disproportionately to a turbine’s annual energy output. To quantify this vital
point, we now consider a site with an average wind speed of 8 m/s measured over a complete
year at the intended height of the turbine rotor. Such an annual average is normally very
productive for a large wind turbine. However, referring back to Figures 2.1 and 2.2, we see
that an 8 m/s wind, a “moderate breeze” on the Beaufort scale, would not be much use if it
remained constant. It is the wind’s variability that is so valuable.
Suppose variability is assessed using an anemometer and data logger to record the aver￾age wind speed hour by hour over a complete year. There are 8760 hours in a year, so we
obtain 8760 readings. The data is now separated into intervals or “bins” 1 m/s wide and the
number of occurrences (N) in each bin is noted. We now construct a histogram showing
the distribution of hourly wind speeds over the year, giving the result in Figure 2.3(a). The
“skewed” shape, tailing off gradually at high speeds, is typical of sites in temperate climates

with variable winds, for example, near the coastlines of Western Europe and North America.
The mode (most likely speed) is about 6 m/s, which is lower than the average value of 8 m/s.
Most of the time the speed is between 2 and 15 m/s, but there are occasional gales and periods
of calm.
If we now multiply the number of hours (N) in each bin by the cube of the speed, we obtain a
measure of the bin’s energy, giving the histogram shown in part (b) of the figure. Its vertical
scale, normalized to a peak value of 100%, is not important here, but the shift of the peak
toward higher wind speeds, compared with part (a), is highly significant. It shows that the
most productive wind speeds, in terms of their annual energy contributions, are between
about 8 and 20 m/s, with a peak at 12 m/s. Almost none of the total energy is contained below
4 m/s and above 24 m/s, so little is lost by choosing these as the cut-in and cut-out speeds.
It is worth noting that histograms based on hourly average wind speeds ignore variability
within the hour—which, once again, tends to increase the available energy.
We first mentioned the issue of intermittency at the start of Section 1.4, noting that stationary
turbines tend to make people skeptical about wind energy. We now see that the main culprit

(probably an unfair description!) is the cubic relationship between wind speed and power.
For although a light breeze is quite noticeable when it blows in our faces, especially on a
winter’s day, to a wind turbine it is insignificant. Unfortunately, the public often fails to
realize the enormous difference between the energy content of a light breeze and a really
good blow—and why it is perfectly reasonable for turbines to spend some of their time in a
state of suspended animation.
We have chosen a fairly high average wind speed of 8 m/s for the above illustration, but of
course there are wide variations among sites (Figure 2.4). The cubic relationship between
wind speed and power means that relatively small differences in average speed have a big
impact on the available energy. A hilltop or offshore site offering 10 m/s would be a lot better
than 8 m/s, assuming similar variability. At the other end of the scale, average speeds below
5 or 6 m/s rarely justify the installation of large turbines. So, in practice, most of today’s
machines operate within a fairly narrow range of average wind speeds.
This brings us to a very important sitting issue: how high should a turbine be mounted above
the ground or sea surface? In general, the higher the better because wind strength increases
with height, sometimes dramatically. In addition, short-term turbulence that produces
unwelcome stresses on turbine blades and towers tends to decrease. So, there are big advan￾tages in raising the hub height of a turbine. Over the years, many disappointing performances
have been caused by ignoring this advice. The increase of average wind speed with height is
referred to as wind shear and is often approximated by a simple power law of the form:
U∕U0 = (h∕h0)
𝛼 (2.4)
where U is the speed at height h, U0 is the speed at some reference height h0 (speed
measurements are often made 10 or 20 m above the surface), and 𝛼 is a power law exponent
that depends on the surface roughness and the atmospheric stability.
Clearly, the rougher the surface, the more it retards the flow of wind and the greater the ben￾efit of raising a turbine’s hub height. The exponent 𝛼 is greater for rough surfaces than for
smooth ones and greater under stable than unstable atmospheric conditions. For example,
snow-covered flat land and calm seas have 𝛼 values around 0.1; arable crops around 0.2;
and landscapes with trees, hedges, and buildings around 0.3. It is important to realize, how￾ever, that all are very site dependent and influenced by atmospheric conditions, ground
undulations, hills, and other local features—and, offshore, by the state of the sea. In many

cases, the amount of wind shear varies with wind direction because of changes in the surface
or landscape. Yet, in spite of the difficulty of assigning precise values of 𝛼 to particular sites,
the message is clear; raise the height of turbines, especially over rough surfaces, as much as
possible consistent with the economics of providing high towers and possible concerns about
visual intrusion.
Equation (2.4) describes the variation of wind speed with height, but of course it is the vari￾ation of wind power with height that affects turbine output. Using the by-now familiar cubic
relationship between speed and power, we may write:
P∕P0 = (h∕h0)
3𝛼 (2.5)
where P and Po are the power at heights h and h0, respectively.
Figure 2.5 illustrates this result for the three 𝛼 values mentioned earlier, for increases in
height up to five times. For example, on an extensive flat site covered with arable crops hav￾ing 𝛼 = 0.2, doubling the tower height may increase the available wind power by about 50%,
trebling it by about 90%. Also shown is a curve for 𝛼 = 0.14, which is relevant to smooth
grassland including large areas of the Great Plains in the USA. As we shall see in our dis￾cussion of wind mapping in Section 2.2.3, this is widely used in North America as a default
value to estimate increases in wind power and speed with height. And in general, we con￾clude that wind shear is an important consideration when choosing sites for wind turbines,
and that raising hub heights is highly beneficial to performance.
2.2 Wild wind
2.2.1 Introduction
The winds of the world are to varying degrees unpredictable, intermittent, fickle in speed
and direction, and occasionally extreme. All this increases the challenge and fascination of
designing effective wind energy systems.

We have already seen that wind’s variability has a big impact on the annual energy inter￾cepted by a turbine rotor. Periods of above-average speed are highly productive due to the
cubic relationship between wind speed and power, and gusty winds tend to be more produc￾tive than consistent ones. But it is important to realize that variability occurs over different
timescales, with important implications for turbine design, installation, and economics:
■ Long term (interannual). The wind resource at a particular site varies from year to
year. For example, a coastal site in Western Europe may experience a series of strong
“autumn gales” 1 year, but not the next. So, a single year’s wind speed measurements
(such as we used to construct histograms in Figure 2.5), although widely used to assess
a site’s potential, may not give an accurate long-term picture. Interannual variations
up to 5% in average wind speed are quite common, with larger effects on energy pro￾duction. An added complication is the climate change due to global warming and its
impact on wind patterns. These are important issues for turbine installers and energy
planners wanting to predict the performance of wind farms over 20 years or more.
■ Annual (seasonal). Most locations experience substantial variations in wind speed
over the course of a year. As an example, Figure 2.6 represents average monthly val￾ues for a UK site where the autumn and winter months tend to be the most windy
and summer months the calmest. Such annual variations are important when it comes
to assessing wind energy generation in relation to seasonal electricity demand, or for
planning turbine maintenance. The dots represent values for a single year; the vertical
bars show the range of values recorded over a 10-year period, indicating substantial
interannual as well as seasonal variation.
■ Daily (diurnal). In many cases, there are systematic daily variations in wind strength
due to differential heating by the Sun as the Earth spins on its axis. Typically, winds
are stronger during daylight hours than at night, with the largest variations occurring
in the spring and summer months. Diurnal effects depend greatly on local geography,
proximity to the sea and altitude (Figure 2.7).

■ Short term. Random fluctuations in wind speed and direction over periods of less than
about 10 minutes are generally classed as turbulence. A discrete, and possibly violent,
event within a turbulent wind stream is called a gust—or, when accompanied by rain
or sleet and especially at sea, a squall. Turbulence, gusts, and squalls are worrying for
turbine designers and operators since they place heavy dynamic loads on blades and
structures, make big demands on turbine control systems, and may affect the quality
of electricity delivered to the grid. Figure 2.8 shows a typical plot of wind speed over
a 2-min period, with several strong gusts occurring around a high average speed of
14 m/s. Here the wind speed can fluctuate by 50% (and its power by about 140%) in
less than 20 s—a big challenge for a large turbine.
The rapid development of wind technology over the past half-century has encouraged scien￾tists and engineers to look ever more closely at the characteristics of “wild wind,” developing
and adapting statistical models to describe its variability and predict turbine performance.
It is now time for us, too, to turn our attention to some key ideas in probability and statistics.
2.2.2 Wind statistics
When the world-famous Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962) famously remarked that
“prediction is very difficult, especially of the future,” it seems unlikely he was thinking of
wind turbines—even the pioneering ones built by his compatriot Poul La Cour between 1891
and 1918 (see Section 1.3) of which he was presumably aware. But the statistical techniques
that Bohr knew well have certainly proved important in wind engineering, especially for
describing the fluctuating nature of the wind resource and for predicting its effect on turbine
performance.

We will focus here on some important practical questions:
■ If we know the average wind speed at a particular site, can we make an accurate pre￾diction of the speed distribution over the course of a full year and use it to estimate the
annual energy yield of a wind turbine?
■ What can wind statistics tell us about the proportion of time that a turbine is likely to
be stationary and the chance that extreme events may damage or even destroy it?
We have already gone some way toward answering the first of these questions. In
Section 2.1, we considered a site with an average annual wind speed of 8 m/s and imagined
taking 8760 hourly readings to determine the speed distribution over a complete year. The
data was separated into “bins” 1 m/s wide, and the number of occurrences in each bin
noted. We then constructed histograms showing the distribution and the relative amount
of energy contained within each “bin” (Figure 2.3). It is clear that this approach involves
time-consuming measurements, and many years’ data may be needed to give an accurate
long-term picture. Measurements at the intended hub height of a large modern turbine—say
between 70 and 120 m above the surface—are likely to be cumbersome and expensive.
So the question naturally arises: if we know the average wind speed for a particular site,
typically measured at a height of 10 or 20 m, can we extrapolate to the required hub height
and describe the wind regime by a theoretical distribution rather than a comprehensive set
of practical measurements?
Before answering this question, we should say a few words about probabilities. The his￾togram in Figure 2.3(a) allows us to estimate the probability of finding the wind speed in
a particular “bin.” For example, if the bin centered on 10 m/s contains 680 scores (out of a
total of 8760) and bearing in mind that it is 1 m/s wide, the probability of the speed falling in
the range 9.5–10.5 m/s may be estimated as 680/8760 = 0.0776. If we use bins half as wide, we
expect half as many scores in each—and so on. So the value 0.0776 is in effect a probability
density per m/s, rather than a simple probability. And we may regard the histogram as an
approximation to an underlying continuous function representing the probability of finding

the wind speed within a narrow range of values. Such a distribution is known as a probability
density function (pdf).
Not surprisingly, meteorologists have long been interested in describing wind speed distri￾butions using pdfs. Two of the most valuable functions are named after the English physicist
Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) and the eminent Swedish engineer Waloddi Weibull (1887–1979)
(Figure 2.9).
Rayleigh, a Cambridge professor and Nobel Prize winner with a polymath’s interest in the
physical sciences, developed a pdf to describe the scattering of radio waves. The Rayleigh
distribution, which has since found widespread application in areas including wind
engineering, is defined by a single parameter and is normally written in the form:
p (x)=(x∕𝜎2
) exp(−x2
∕2𝜎2
) (2.6)
where p is the probability of value x and 𝜎 is the mode of the distribution. Applying it to
wind statistics, we may replace x by the wind speed U and denote the mean (average) wind
speed by Ua. The mode, mean, and standard deviation (SD) of the Rayleigh distribution are
then related as follows:
𝜎 = Ua
√2∕𝜋 = 0.798 Ua (2.7)
SD = Ua
√(4 − 𝜋)∕𝜋 = 0.523 Ua (2.8)
and the distribution may be restated in terms of wind speed:
P(U)=(𝜋∕2)
(
U∕U2
a
)
exp {
(−𝜋∕4)

U2
∕U2

Figure 2.10 shows its form for average speeds of 4, 6, 8, and 10 m/s. Note that in each case,
the modal (peak) value occurs at a lower speed than the average value, due to the skewed
shape of the curves.
How successful is the Rayleigh distribution at modeling annual wind speed distributions?

Europe and continental North America, it generally gives an accurate description of the
ratio between mode and average wind speeds and the tail off at high speeds. In cases where
the only available information about a site is its average wind speed, the Rayleigh model is
a very useful approximation.
The alternative Weibull distribution, championed by its Swedish namesake in a famous paper
published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1951,1 has found applica￾tions in fields as diverse as reliability engineering, weather forecasting, and radar—not to
mention insurance and infant mortality! It has an extra parameter that may be indepen￾dently adjusted, varying the ratio between mean and mode, the amount of “skew,” and the
way it approaches extreme values. Applied to wind statistics it covers a wider variety of wind
regimes than the Rayleigh distribution and is often preferred when more data is available
than just the average wind speed.2 Its pdf takes the form:
p (x)=(kxk−1
∕Ak) exp(−xk∕Ak) (2.10)
where A is a scale factor and k is a form factor allowing the shape of the curve to be adjusted.
Note that if k =2 Equation (2.10) reduces to the same form as Equation (2.9), showing that
the Rayleigh distribution is a special case of the Weibull or, alternatively, that the Weibull
is a generalization of the Rayleigh. Again replacing x by the wind speed U, the Weibull pdf
becomes:
P (U)=(kUk−1
∕Ak) exp(−xk∕Ak) (2.11)
Figure 2.11 shows three examples of Weibull pdfs for an average wind speed of 6 m/s, with k
set to 1.5, 2.0 (Rayleigh) and 2.5. Note how, as k decreases, the peak moves to the left and the
curve spreads out, denoting a wind regime with a wider speed range. In practice it is found
that k values between 1.5 and 2.0 cover the great majority of cases, with a tendency for inland
sites to have lower values than coastal and offshore ones.2 Sites with relatively constant wind
speeds, for example, those swept by consistent trade winds, are likely to display higher values.
The relationships between mode, mean, and standard deviation are more complex than for
a Rayleigh distribution, involving gamma functions, and are described elsewhere.3

Figure 2.11 Weibull distributions for an average wind speed of 6 m/s.
We have labeled the abscissa “wind speed” and the ordinate “probability” but, as already
noted, such curves are actually density functions. The probability of finding the wind speed at
some precise value—say exactly 10 m/s—is vanishingly small; we must instead talk about the
probability of it occupying a small range around 10 m/s. To illustrate this important point,
the Rayleigh distribution for an average wind speed of 8 m/s is drawn again in Figure 2.12(a).
Its value at a wind speed of 10 m/s may be calculated using Equation (2.9):
p (10)=(1.57 × 10∕64) exp(−0.786 × 10∕64) = 0.0718 (2.12)
To find the probability of the speed falling within a small range of around 10 m/s, we multiply
this figure by the “bin width.” For example, if we choose a bin width of 1.0 m/s, denoting a
speed range between 9.5 and 10.5 m/s, the probability is 0.0718 × 1.0 = 0.0718, equal to the
small rectangular area in the figure. In other words, there is a 7.18% chance, over the year as
a whole, of the speed falling within this range. More generally, the probability that the speed
falls between any two values is found as the area under the curve between them—equivalent
to integrating the function between the two limits. Note also that the total area under a pdf
is unity because the wind speed must always be somewhere between zero and infinity.
Having found a suitable pdf, we can estimate the probability that the wind speed is below, or
above, certain values. If we set these as a turbine’s cut-in and cut-out speeds, we can predict
the proportion of time the turbine is expected to be stationary. Suppose, for example, the
speeds in this case are 5 m/s for cut-in and 20 m/s for cut-out, also indicated in Figure 2.12(a).
The area under the curve between 0 and 5 m/s represents the probability that the wind blows
at less than 5 m/s; the much smaller area above 20 m/s shows that it exceeds 20 m/s. And
although we could find these areas by integrating the pdf between the relevant limits, it is
more convenient to use the cumulative distribution function (cdf) shown in part (b) of the
figure.
A cdf represents a “running integration” of the corresponding pdf. Starting at the left-hand
end of the pdf, it progressively sums the area under the curve. Intuitively, it is “the area
covered so far.” And since the total area under a pdf is always unity, a cdf must eventually
reach a value of 1.0. The cdf of a Rayleigh distribution is given by

and is plotted in part (b) of the figure for the same average wind speed of 8 m/s. Its value at
5 m/s is 0.264, so there is a 26.4% probability that the wind speed is below cut-off and the
turbine is stationary. In other words, over the course of a full year, we expect the turbine to
be idle about 26% of the time due to low wind speeds (disappointing at first sight—until we
recall the cubic relationship between wind speed and power!). The value of the cdf at 20 m/s
is 0.993, so there is a 0.7% chance of the wind speed exceeding 20 m/s, causing the turbine
to cut out for its own protection.
So far, we have been considering annual statistics—the distribution of wind speeds over a
whole year, and the proportion of time spent above, below, or close to a particular value—for
which the Rayleigh and Weibull pdfs are most appropriate. We now turn to two additional
and important aspects of wind variability that may be characterized using statistical models:
short-term fluctuations of wind speed in a turbulent air stream and the chance occurrence
of extreme events.
In the previous section, we discussed random fluctuations in wind speed and illustrated a
typical two-minute history of gusts in a turbulent air stream in Figure 2.8. Gusts and squalls

place heavy dynamic loads on turbine blades and structures and test the effectiveness of
control systems, so it may be useful to represent them by a statistical model.
When a random variable such as short-term wind speed displays variations above and below
its average (mean) value, and when the variations are due to multiple independent factors, the
Gaussian distribution is the classic way of describing them. Devised by the German mathe￾matician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), (Figure 2.14) who originally used it to describe
random errors in astronomical observations, it finds widespread application throughout sci￾ence and technology—so much so that it is also known as the normal distribution. Its pdf is
usually written as
p (x)=(1∕𝜎
√
2𝜋) exp(−(x − 𝜇)
2
∕2𝜎2
) (2.14)
where 𝜇 is the mean (average) value, 𝜎 is the standard deviation, and 𝜎2 is the variance. Gaus￾sian curves are symmetrical and have a “bell” shape, implying that fluctuations of a given size
above and below the mean are equally probable. Figure 2.13 shows three typical examples: a
red curve for an average wind speed of 10 m/s with a high degree of speed variability or tur￾bulence (𝜎2 = 4.0); an orange curve for the same average speed but less variability (𝜎2 = 0.8);
and a green curve for a lower average speed of 6 m/s and intermediate variability (𝜎2 = 2.0).
Note that this form of pdf shows the relative probability of different wind speeds occurring
in a turbulent air stream over comparatively short time scales, but it tells us nothing about
temporal structure, for example, how rapidly the speed can change between one moment
and the next, or how often gusts occur. Such questions are generally tackled by spectral or
correlation analysis of wind speed data, a more advanced topic covered elsewhere.3
Our final topic in this section concerns “extreme events” that could seriously damage, or even
destroy, a wind turbine. We have previously noted that a wild and turbulent air stream will,
from time to time, produce wind speeds far above the average value. A machine designed to
withstand severe gales cannot necessarily survive a “once in a lifetime” gust superimposed on

a storm-force blast. Turbine designers need to sleep at night, feeling confident that a machine
intended for a working life of, say, 25 years, is extremely unlikely to face such a threat.
Once again, it is all a question of probability and statistics. We can never be certain that
a damaging gust will not occur next year, or in the next decade. But it is reassuring to
know that the return time of potentially catastrophic events—the average interval between
recurrences—is considerably greater than the design lifetime of wind turbines. Similar con￾cerns arise in other fields. Ships occasionally meet freak waves; coastal defenses are some￾times overwhelmed; and insurance companies face huge claims for earthquake damage. But
it is not only natural forces and disasters that have encouraged statisticians to develop what
is known as extreme value theory; one of its pioneers spent a working lifetime investigating
the strength of cotton thread.
Leonard Tippett (1902–1985), a physics graduate of Imperial College London who worked
for a cotton research institute in Manchester, England, realized that the strength of yarn
for weaving depended on its weakest fibers and that occasional failure was, in his terms,
an “extreme event.” The statistical techniques he pioneered were taken up and formalized
by Emil Gumbel (1891–1966), a Heidelberg mathematics professor who was forced from
his post by the Nazis and eventually became an American citizen(Figure 2.14). We should
perhaps not be surprised that the Gumbel distribution has since found widespread application
to extreme events including the freak winds that can threaten wind turbines.
The type of problem addressed by Tippett and Gumbel may be summarized as follows.
We cannot generally build up the history and statistics of extreme events that occur very
infrequently by waiting for them to happen, because it is likely to involve a very long wait!
For example, a freak gust sufficient to destroy a turbine may only occur at a particular site
once a century on average. Many centuries of measurements would be needed to build up a
reliable database. So, the question arises: is it possible to record extreme events over a much
shorter period and extrapolate the data using a statistical model?
We should be clear about the very small probabilities involved here. For example, if we are
interested in the strongest gust over, say, a 10-second interval that is expected to occur once
in a hundred years at a particular location, we are talking about a probability of occurrence
in any 10-second interval of 1/(100 × 8760 × 360) = 3.2 × 10−9. This simply underlines the fact
that very extreme events are extraordinarily unlikely!

To illustrate the use of the Gumbel distribution, suppose that the speed of the strongest gust
at a particular site has been recorded each year for ten successive years. We find the mean
value m and standard deviation 𝜎 of the 10-point dataset and calculate two parameters:
𝛽 = (𝜎
√
6)∕𝜋 = 0.780 𝜎 (2.15)
𝜇 = m − 0.577 𝛽 (2.16)
The probability density of annual “extreme events” (i.e., peak gusts) occurring at other wind
speeds Ue may now be found using the Gumbel distribution:
p (Ue)=(1∕𝛽) exp(−𝛾) exp{−exp(−𝛾)} (2.17)
where 𝛾 = (Ue − 𝜇)∕𝛽 (2.18)
We shall find the corresponding cdf especially useful in this case:
d(Ue) = exp{−exp(−𝛾)} (2.19)
As previously noted, a cdf computes “the area covered so far” under the corresponding pdf
and gives the probability of finding the wind speed below a certain value. However, we are
concerned here with extreme winds above a certain value, in other words with the comple￾mentary function:
1 − d(Ue) = 1 − exp{−exp(−𝛾)} (2.20)
Suppose the strongest gust at an exposed hilltop site in Scotland has been recorded each
year for 10 years. The 10 values have a mean of 38 m/s and standard deviation of 6.5 m/s,
giving 𝛽 =5.07 m/s and 𝜇 =35.1 m/s. Using Equation (2.20), we may construct the curve in
Figure 2.15, showing the probability that the highest gust recorded in any 1 year will exceed
a certain value. For example, the probability of it exceeding 40 m/s is about 0.3, or 30%.
However, we wish to predict the chance of a dangerous gust over a century, not just a single
year. For a return time (average time between occurrences) of 100 years, the probability in
any one year must be 0.01. Figure 2.15 shows that this corresponds to a speed of 59 m/s.
We conclude that once in every hundred years, a gust in excess of 59 m/s can be expected.
This is, of course, far above the average annual peak of 38 m/s and massively greater than
the mean wind speed of this or any other site. Turbine designers and would-be installers on
Scottish hilltops take note!
We have introduced a number of statistical concepts in this section, and it may be helpful
to end by reviewing the four types of probability density function used to characterize the
variability of wind:
■ The Rayleigh distribution is valuable for modeling the annual distribution of wind
speeds at a particular site when the only available information is the average (mean)
wind speed.
■ The Weibull distribution is generally preferred to the Rayleigh distribution when more
comprehensive wind speed data is available since it gives more flexibility. It includes
the Rayleigh as a special case.

As Niels Bohr said, prediction, especially of the future, is very difficult. But in wind engi￾neering, it is certainly important to make the effort!
2.2.3 Mapping and forecasting
The extraordinary growth of the global wind industry over the past 30 years has coincided
with big efforts to map the world’s wind resources. As far back as 1987, a wind atlas was pro￾duced in the USA showing national and state wind data. By 2005, the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL) located in Colorado had developed advanced digital modeling
and mapping techniques to produce revised maps with greatly enhanced resolution.4
A high-quality European Wind Atlas was published in 1989 under the auspices of the
European Community.5 Since then the wind mapping techniques pioneered in America and
Europe have been adopted in well over 100 countries. Using data from the European Wind
Atlas, modified to take account of local features and conditions, it is now possible to predict
the wind regime at a particular site with the aid of a Wind Atlas Analysis and Application
Program (WAsP).
Back in Section 1.2, we considered the world’s major wind patterns, illustrating them in
Figures 1.4 and 1.5. But this was big scale; we will now home in on more detailed national
and local wind atlas data, followed by some comments on wind forecasting.
The uses and limitations of modern, high-resolution, wind atlases may be summarized as
follows:

■ They provide energy planners and policy makers with a rapid overview of the wind
energy potential of a country or region, its geographical distribution, and proximity
to local centers of population.
■ They offer commercial developers and installers of wind turbines indications of likely
areas and sites for individual turbines or wind farms.
■ Together with specialist software, they may often be used to calculate the wind poten￾tial of a particular site with reasonable accuracy.
However, as we have previously emphasized:
■ Wind resources vary from year to year and are much affected by hills and undula￾tions in the landscape, impediments to wind flow including trees and buildings, and
the roughness of the land or sea surface. Wind atlases may not provide the required
degree of detail.
■ Wind strength depends on the height above the ground or sea surface. Wind atlas data
is often based on low-level measurements that are extrapolated to turbine hub heights
making assumptions about surface roughness.
Although wind atlases have improved greatly over the years and have undoubted value for
overall planning and prediction, their use should be tempered with caution, especially when
attempting to estimate wind resources at sites with complex geography and surface condi￾tions. With these caveats in mind, we now consider three examples of wind atlas data.
Figure 2.16, based on a portion of the European Wind Atlas, gives an overview of wind
resources around the coasts of Western Europe. The various countries are denoted by their
initial letters (N = Norway, Sw = Sweden, D = Denmark, G = Germany, Ne = the Nether￾lands, E = England, and so on). Color coding is used to denote average wind speeds 50 m
above the surface, and the values in the table refer to flat coastal sites, appropriate for many
large onshore turbines. Noteworthy features include:
■ The good-to-excellent wind resources along the coastline stretching from Norway right
down to northwest France; also in the UK, Ireland, and a small region of northwest
Spain exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. All these coasts have prevailing westerly winds
(see also Figure 1.5).
■ A high wind resource on the Mediterranean coast of France, related to the famous
Mistral wind that channels down the valley of the river Rhone (see also Figure 1.5),
and the north-westerly Tramontane that accelerates between the Pyrenees mountains
and the Massif Central.
■ A small region of strong winds in northeast Spain, just to the south of the Pyrenean
chain dividing Spain from France (and a correspondingly calm area on the other side
of the mountains).
Although useful as a summary, a figure on this scale hides many important details. For
example, the whole of Scotland is depicted as a turbine installer’s dream; yet, there are big
differences in wind resource between Scottish mountains and valleys, inland and coastal
areas, and the east and west coasts. Such mapping gives a general indication of wind energy
potential and is probably most valuable to energy planners.
We have concentrated on wind speeds at European coastal sites because of their interest in
wind energy. However, the big differences in wind potential caused by surface roughness

The speeds given in Figure 2.16 relate to the third of these categories. Values for sheltered
terrain are considerably lower; for hills and ridges, considerably higher. Of course, all such
estimates are approximate and depend on the characteristics of a particular site.
In the USA, wind potential is assessed rather differently by defining seven wind power classes.
Each class covers a range of average power densities in W/m2 and equivalent wind speeds
at heights of 10, 30, and 50 m above the surface. Increases in power and speed with height
are generally based on the so-called 1/7 power law. Referring to our discussion of the effects
of surface roughness in Section 2.1, you may recall that a power law exponent 𝛼 was used
to predict the increase of wind speed and power with height above the surface. Smooth sur￾faces have 𝛼 values as low as 0.1 and rough surfaces as high as 0.3 or 0.4 (see Figure 2.5).
A value of 0.14, or 1/7, is widely accepted for extensive grassland sites including large areas
of the Great Plains in the USA, so the 1/7 power law is often used as a default in the absence
of more specific information. It predicts the following increase in wind power with height
(see also Equation (2.5)):
P∕P0 = (h∕h0)
3𝛼 = (h∕h0)
0.42 (2.21)
If the height increases from 10 to 30 m, the power is multiplied by 1.586 (say 1.6); from 10 to
50 m, by 1.966 (say 2.0). These factors are often used for tabulations of wind power classes.3, 6

detail. We have used color coding to indicate the various wind power classes (combining the
relatively close-spaced classes 4 and 5). Average wind speeds are given for a height of 50 m
taking local topology and surface conditions into account. In coastal ranges and mountain
regions, the wind classes generally refer to sites on hilltops or ridges. We see that classes 1 and
2 typify much low-lying land including the Sacramento Valley, with class 6 attained in parts
of the Sierra Nevada and Warner Mountains. Sites suitable for wind turbines are normally
rated class 3 or above.
One apparent anomaly is the small, isolated, class 6 area about 100 km east of San Fran￾cisco. The Altamont Pass through the Diablo Range is an internationally famous cradle
of the American wind energy industry, and its wind farm has one of the densest popula￾tions of wind turbines in the world. Initially developed around 1980 in the heady days of
the “Californian wind rush,” it still supports several thousand turbines, mostly fairly small
by modern standards. Another limited class 6 area is in the Carquinez Straits, a tidal gap
between coastal hills where the Sacramento River flows toward the Pacific Ocean.
As turbines installed by electric utilities become larger and more powerful, their rotor diam￾eters demand greater hub heights. Wind atlases generally extrapolate wind data to heights
of 50 m or perhaps 80 m, but we are now moving into the era of 100–150 m hub heights for
multi-megawatt machines. The table in Figure 2.18 shows what happens to the speeds and
power densities of the various wind power classes when extrapolated from 50 to 125 m, again
assuming a 1/7 power law (𝛼 =0.14): speeds increase by about 14% and power densities by
about 50%. Power class 6 now reaches up to 10 m/s average wind speed. Once again, the
advantages of “moving skywards” are emphasized.
Actually, very few onshore turbines operate in average wind speeds of 10 m/s and above, but
offshore it is a different story. Turbines tend to be larger and higher and the wind stronger
and less turbulent. So, this seems a good moment to leave the safety of the land and venture
into the wild North Sea, where many of Europe’s largest turbines are being installed. Sand￾wiched between the coasts of Scotland and England on one side and Norway, Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium on the other, the North Sea’s prevailing westerly
winds offer an impressive wind resource, and its limited depth makes turbine installation
relatively economical.

Figure 2.19 draws on information from the European Wind Atlas, but extrapolated to
a height of 125 m above mean sea level using the 1/7 power law (𝛼 =0.14). It may seem
surprising to use this value of 𝛼 once again, but it is generally reckoned about right for
moderate-to-rough sea states—although we must bear in mind that wind shear above the
sea depends on many factors including wave heights and distances from windward shores.
Countries bordering the North Sea are indicated by their initial letters, as shown in
Figure 2.16, and average wind speeds are arranged in four color bands. We have now moved
decisively up the power scale, especially between Scotland and Norway, and areas in the top
two-color bands would be rated as wind power class 7 under the American system. As we
might expect—and unlike the two land maps already discussed—the North Sea has huge
areas of consistent wind resource undisturbed by land irregularities. Prevailing westerlies
blow especially hard against exposed coasts of Norway and Denmark, whereas the English
landmass provides some shelter. The figure nicely illustrates the North Sea’s attractions
for wind engineering, in spite of the challenges and costs of working in a harsh marine
environment.

In this brief account of wind mapping, we have concentrated on three large-scale areas that
are familiar to most people. Of course, much of the value of modern wind atlases stems from
their high resolution, allowing planners and installers to home in on much smaller areas. You
may wish to consult the NREL,4 European,5 or a national atlas to explore the wind resource
in a location near to you. Also, as we shall see in the next section, it is often possible to predict
the wind resource at a particular site with reasonable accuracy using specialized software.
We conclude this section with some comments on wind forecasting. Actually, the distinction
between mapping and forecasting is quite subtle. After all, a map based on historical wind
data is a type of long-term forecast that assumes past information can be used to predict
the future. However, we generally reserve the word “forecasting” for relatively short-term
predictions covering hours or days. The weather forecasts we see on our TV screens fall in
this category.
What is the importance of short-term forecasting for the wind energy industry? There are
powerful reasons for wanting to know what the wind is going to do in the next few hours,
or days, especially for the operators of electricity grids. For example, if an Atlantic weather
front with associated high winds is approaching the North Sea, the combined output of
coastal and offshore wind turbines will increase dramatically. This may impact heavily on
the electricity grids to which the turbines are connected.
A guiding principle of renewable energy, including wind energy, is “use it or lose it.” Unlike
conventional electricity generators that burn fossil fuels, wind turbines have very low oper￾ating costs because their “fuel” is free. Wind power should ideally be accepted by a grid
whenever it is available. However, a second guiding principle applies to electricity grids: they
cannot store electricity, so a balance must be maintained at all times between generation
and consumption. To achieve this in a cost-effective way, the various power plants supply￾ing a grid are brought in and out of operation, or scheduled, according to their operating
costs. A sudden increase in wind power must be offset by reductions from other genera￾tors. But this is not as simple as it sounds because different types of generators vary greatly
in their flexibility and speed of control. This makes accurate wind forecasting over peri￾ods of a few hours especially important for systems with a substantial proportion of wind
generation.
A further challenge relates to the operation of modern deregulated electricity markets, in
which electricity is traded like other commodities. Although market details vary a lot among
countries, the basic idea is that the producer’s contract to supply electricity to the grid at
certain prices and times in the future—typically up to 24 or 48 hours ahead. Clearly, this
places great emphasis on the value of accurate wind forecasting over a few days, for wind
farm owners as producers and for grid operators and electric utilities as purchasers.
Wind forecasting is therefore important from both technical and operational perspectives.
A great deal of effort has recently been put into improving its meteorological and analytical
background,6 a trend that will surely accelerate as more and more wind energy is integrated
into grid networks.
2.3 Predicting turbine output
We now come to an extremely important question: how much electrical energy can a turbine
be expected to produce over the course of an average year? The answer is the key to its

economic justification—the need to offset capital, installation, and running costs against
the value of the electricity generated.
We have already emphasized the crucial importance of the wind regime for predicting the
performance of a wind turbine. The cubic relationship between wind speed and power means
that quite small changes in average wind speed have a big impact on turbine output. It is
therefore vital to assess a site’s wind regime as accurately as possible before deciding whether
to proceed with installation. A minimum requirement is a reliable estimate of the mean wind
speed at the proposed hub height.
One way of assessing the wind potential at a particular site, known as the wind atlas method,
may be used when it is too difficult or time consuming to make practical wind speed mea￾surements. The method takes data from a high-definition wind atlas, modifies it to allow
for the site’s special features, and produces a site-specific prediction. In Europe, it is widely
implemented using the European Wind Atlas5 together with WAsP software,7 illustrated
by Figure 2.20. The atlas was originally produced from meteorological data collected at
some 220 European stations over many years, together with information about sheltering by
obstacles, surface roughness, and surface geography (known as orography) at each location.
The meteorological data was processed by a series of three theoretical models to remove
site-specific influences, illustrated by the upper line in the figure. The resulting atlas summa￾rizes regional and local wind resources unhindered by purely local conditions. To estimate
the resource at a new site—one being considered for a turbine or wind farm—the process is
reversed. Data from the wind atlas is now modified by the WAsP program using information
about the site’s orography, roughness, and obstacles, producing the required prediction. This
is represented by the lower line in the figure.
Clearly, the accuracy of the method depends on the validity of the theoretical models that
generate the wind atlas in the first place and on the quality and quantity of information about
the new site fed into the WAsP program. It is most successful for predicting wind conditions
at uncomplicated sites, but less likely to yield accurate results in highly structured landscapes,
including mountain territory and sites with multiple, complex, obstructions.
Of course, the best way of defining the wind resource is by careful onsite measurements,
assuming the necessary time and money are available. Back in Section 2.1, we considered
using an anemometer and data logger to record average wind speed hour by hour over
a complete year. The data was then separated into “bins” 1 m/s wide to produce a speed
distribution—see Figure 2.3(a). In our discussion of wind statistics in Section 2.2.2, we
explained how such a distribution may be fitted to a Rayleigh or Weibull function. This
is normally the starting point for a prediction of annual turbine output.

Suppose that wind speed measurements have been made over a complete year, typically at a
relatively low height, and extrapolated to the hub height of the intended turbine. One year’s
data is unlikely to be entirely representative of the wind regime at the site, so we fit a Rayleigh
or Weibull function to “iron out” chance fluctuations and provide a smoother version of the
distribution. This is shown in part (a) of Figure 2.21, which gives the number of hours spent
in each speed “bin”.
We now turn to the turbine’s power curve shown in part (b), which shows the manufacturer’s
estimate of power output at each value of wind speed. This turbine is rated at 3 MW with
a cut-in speed at 4 m/s and cut-out at 25 m/s and reaches its rated power at about 14 m/s.
We multiply each power value by the corresponding number of hours in part (a) to give
the electrical energy in each speed bin. For example, the 10 m/s bin is occupied for about
580 hours in a year and generates a turbine output of about 1.8 MW. The bin energy, referred
to as the class yield, is therefore 580 × 1.8 = 1040 MWh. The class yields for all wind speeds
form the histogram in part (c) of the figure.
The total annual energy is found by summing the individual class yields to give the cumu￾lative yield in part (d). It amounts to 9.2 GWh, allowing us to predict the capacity factor of
this particular turbine at this particular site. First discussed in Section 1.4 and defined by
Equation (1.3), the capacity factor is the ratio between the annual energy actually produced
(Ea) and the maximum that would be produced if the turbine worked throughout the year
at its full rated output. In this example, we have
Cf = Ea∕(8760 × Pr) = 9.2 GWh∕(8760 × 3 MW) = 0.35 = 35% (2.22)
which is fairly typical for a large, efficient, modern turbine operating at a good onshore site
with a high average wind speed.
Figure 2.21 illustrates several important points that we have discussed previously:
■ Although the turbine is quite often stationary due to low wind speeds (in this example,
for about 1400 hours out of the annual total of 8760 hours, or 15% of the time), little
is lost because wind speeds below 4 m/s contain very little energy.
■ Wind speeds above cut-out are certainly very energetic, but since they only occur for
a very small proportion of the time (in this example, well under 1%), again very little
is lost.
■ Class yields are highest between about 9 and 15 m/s, well above the mean and mode
wind speeds, due to the cubic relationship between speed and power.
■ The turbine’s power curve approximates a cubic between cut-in and rated speeds, but
its precise form depends on the efficiency (aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical)
with which it converts different wind speeds into electrical output.
Hopefully, the calculations work out favorably, the decision to purchase the turbine is
made, and it is installed without mishap. Large wind turbines are invariably equipped with
an anemometer for measuring wind speed on the nacelle, very close to hub height (see
Figure 2.22). So now comes the opportunity to check theory against practice by actual
recordings of wind speed and electrical output over a complete year or more. Time for
turbine designers, manufacturers, and wind farm operators to cross their fingers!
We have now covered broad issues of turbine power and energy production, relating them
to the statistical properties of the wind—the free “fuel” that drives a modern industry. In

3 Wind turbines
3.1 Turbine types and sizes
Wind turbines of many shapes and sizes have been invented, constructed, and marketed over
the past century. The brief history given in Section 1.3 outlined some key developments:
■ The steady decline of the traditional windmill for grinding corn and pumping water.
■ An increasing interest in using the wind to generate electricity, especially in Denmark
in the first half of the 20th century.
■ The development of global wind turbine capacity which began in the late 1970s, accel￾erated as the new millennium approached, and now delivers substantial amounts of
clean, renewable power to the world’s electricity grids.
In previous chapters, we considered some general aspects of turbine performance including
annual electricity production in a given wind regime, and how this relates to average house￾hold consumption. There are a few more scene-setting aspects to be covered before we get
down to detail and explore the various components of large modern turbines—rotors and
blades, gearboxes, electrical generators, power electronics, and control systems—and explain
the principles that underpin their design and operation.
In this book, we concentrate on large horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) rated between
about 1 and 12 MW that dominate the current international surge in wind energy capac￾ity. The vast majority have three-bladed rotors mounted upwind of their towers, and every
major manufacturer in the world today promotes this basic configuration as the best compro￾mise between cost, technical performance, and long-term reliability (you may refer back to
Figure 1.13). Alternative designs are proposed and championed from time to time, and some
large vertical-axis machines are currently under development. We shall consider them a lit￾tle later. But our basic standpoint from now on is the near-universal one: tomorrow’s global
wind turbine industry, like today’s, will be overwhelmingly based on HAWT technology.
Why do almost all large HAWTs employ three blades rather than one, two, four, or even
more? In fact, a few one-bladed designs, and many two-bladed ones, have seen the light of

day in the last 30 years. But they are now fading from view. It is also interesting that tradi￾tional windmills, following centuries of development, nearly always had four sails—and their
designers presumably knew a thing or two. But, as the wind industry has embarked on its
multi-gigawatt era, the three-bladed model has moved inexorably into pole position, favored
for its technical qualities and cost-effectiveness. The high cost of individual blades means
there is no virtue in using more of them than necessary to achieve high performance. And
public acceptability, which depends largely on visual impact and attractiveness, definitely
favors three blades over one or two (Figure 3.1).
We have previously noted that there is a fundamental limit to the percentage of energy in an
airstream that can be captured by any wind turbine, regardless of the number of blades—a
point we will develop a little later. Today’s large three-bladed rotors typically capture up to
about 50% of the wind’s energy (provided the wind speed is above cut-in and below cut-out)
for conversion into electricity and, as we shall see in the next section, basic physics assures
us that little more can be achieved. We may therefore use this figure with some confidence to
estimate the approximate size of the turbine needed to achieve a given power rating, regard￾less of its detailed design and technology. And, of course, size is a key indicator of weight
and cost and an important criterion for public acceptance.
As explained in Section 2.1, the amount of power intercepted by a rotor of area A m2 facing
a steady airstream of speed U m/s is given by:
P = 0.612 AU3 watts (3.1)
A HAWT rotor with a diameter d meters has a swept area 𝜋d2/4, so in this case:
P = 0.612(
𝜋d2

)

If we assume that the rotor is able to capture 50% of the power in the airstream and that
this mechanical power is converted into electrical power with a typical efficiency of 90%,
the overall efficiency of the turbine is 0.50 × 0.9 = 0.45, or 45%, and the electrical power it
generates is given by:
Pe = (0.45) (0.481)d2
U3 = 0.216d2
U3 watts (3.3)
Most large modern turbines are designed to reach their rated power outputs at wind speeds
between 12 and 14 m/s. Taking 13 m/s as a typical value, and rearranging it to make the d
the subject of the equation, we arrive at the following relationship between rotor diameter
and rated power:
d = (
Pe∕0.216U3
)0.5 = 0.0459 P0.5
e metres (3.4)
We can now predict the rotor diameters needed to produce various power ratings. For
example:
Pe (MW) 2 3 5 7 10
d (meters) 65 80 101 121 145
These results are illustrated in Figure 3.2. The left-hand side is colored grass-green to denote
that 2-MW and 3-MW machines are often sited onshore. The right-hand side is sea-blue
because giant turbines rated at 5 MW and above are more likely to ply their trade offshore.
Tower heights are typically about one rotor diameter, giving a blade clearance of about one
rotor radius above the ground or sea surface, although this depends on the local wind regime
and the importance of visual intrusion.
Of course, we can hardly expect our calculations to apply precisely in all cases. Not all
turbines reach their rated power at a wind speed of 13 m/s. Small ones are often less effi￾cient and operate onshore in less favorable wind regimes, so need somewhat bigger rotors
to achieve a given power rating; the largest and latest machines tend to be more efficient
and are sited offshore on higher towers. But overall, our analysis gives a good indication
of the rotor diameters of today’s large HAWTs.1 Satisfyingly, we have based it on just a few
simple assumptions: the amount of power in the wind, the efficiency of wind capture by a
three-bladed rotor;, and the efficiency of conversion from mechanical to electrical power.

Now seems a good moment to make a general point: the most important indication of a tur￾bine’s power-generating capacity is the area swept by its rotor blades. This applies to a wide
range of designs, vertical as well as horizontal axis, assuming their rotors and electrical gen￾erators have comparable efficiencies. In other words, if you wish to make a quick estimate
of a turbine’s power rating, first find out the area swept by its rotor. Over the years, there
have been many examples of manufacturers of new machines—especially small ones aimed
at individuals and local groups2
—making outlandish claims (in extreme cases, the adver￾tised electrical output has exceeded the amount of power in the wind at the stated speed!).
Fortunately, the purchasers of megawatt turbines are generally well-informed and unlikely
to be taken in by false promises. But every now and again, a new design is trumpeted with
exaggerated claims, so caution is certainly in order. A rotor’s swept area will always be a key
indicator of power capacity—so much so that some experts would prefer to see machines
rated on this basis.
This leads us to a brief discussion of vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs), which are also
limited in their power output by the swept areas of their rotors. Although we shall not devote
much time and space to them here, it must be admitted that turbine rotors spinning about
vertical axes have some inherent advantages:
■ A VAWT rotor does not notice which direction the wind is coming from. It always
“faces the wind” so, unlike a HAWT, does not require a yaw mechanism.
■ The gearbox and electrical generator may be placed beneath the rotor, keeping much
of the weight close to the base of the machine.
■ A large rotor may be accommodated relatively close to the ground or sea surface,
avoiding the need for a high tower and nacelle.
However, there are compensating disadvantages:
■ A VAWT cannot “turn away from the wind” to save itself from damage.
■ A VAWT blade creates downstream turbulence that interferes with other blade(s).
Unlike a HAWT, the blades of a VAWT experience wide variations in wind strength
and direction as they rotate, impacting aerodynamic efficiency and threatening serious
vibration.
Over the years, a multitude of designs have been proposed, many prototypes built, and a
few machines (especially small ones) were offered in the marketplace.2 VAWTs continue to
have protagonists who, of course, like to concentrate on the advantages mentioned above.
However, we are surely right to conclude that in this field, as in so many other branches of
engineering, “the proof of the pudding is in the eating.” The harsh truth is that the total
installed global capacity of VAWTs remains miniscule compared with their HAWT cousins,
and no major company presently offers large VAWT machines for sale.
However, it is never wise to say never. We should therefore mention a few VAWT designs that
have been developed and manufactured over the years, some of which may impact future
developments. Figure 3.3 shows four well-known examples:
a) Cup anemometer. Hardly a “turbine” in the full sense of the word, this small
vertical-axis machine is widely used to measure wind speed at meteorological
stations and on tall buildings and structures – including the nacelles of wind turbines

(see also Figure 2.22). The wind is “caught” by the open ends of the cups, but “slips
past” the closed ends, ensuring that the torque on the shaft is always in the same
direction. The device is not required to deliver significant amounts of power and
runs more or less freely in the wind.
b) Savonius turbine. Invented by the Finnish engineer Sigurd Savonius in 1922, this form
of turbine works rather like a two-cup anemometer. The wind catches each “scoop” in
turn, but it slips past its rear surface. In the figure, the turbine is shown with an open
top to reveal its characteristic “S” shape. Although inherently inefficient compared
with modern blade turbines, Savonius machines have often been used to provide small
amounts of mechanical power, for example, in pumping applications. Amateur enthu￾siasts have fashioned them out of oil drums. But the most widespread application of
small Savonius machines today is on vehicle roofs, coupled directly to extractor fans
to provide air conditioning.
c) Darrieus turbine. This type of VAWT is claimed to be the best-researched and devel￾oped of all vertical-axis machines. Prototypes have been built up to rated powers of
about 0.5 MW, with many smaller designs marketed to individual homeowners and
small organizations. Patented by the French aeronautical engineer Georges Darrieus
in 1927, it is popularly known as the “eggbeater.” Based on curved blades with airfoil
sections, it is more efficient than the Savonius but tends to suffer from self-generated
turbulence, fluctuating torque, and blade vibration. Some of these problems may be
reduced by shaping the blades in the form of a helix. In larger machines, the need for
guy cables imposes large thrust loading on the main bearings. There are currently no
commercial Darrieus machines in competition with large HAWTs.
d) Giromill turbine. Georges Darrieus’ patent of 1927 also covered turbines with straight
blades supported from the main axis. Although potentially more robust than the “eg￾gbeater,” the giromill is subject to many of the same problems. A more sophisticated
version, known as the cycloturbine, orients the blades at optimum angles to the wind
as they rotate—but at increased complexity and cost. Cycloturbines have never been
developed beyond the prototype stage although there is some chance that large com￾mercial versions will be deployed successfully offshore.
From now onward, we will return to our favorite topic—large grid-connected HAWTs with
three-bladed rotors that promise so much for the future of global electricity supplies. In the
next section, we begin exploring the basic principles underlying their operation.
3.2 Aerodynamics
3.2.1 Rotor efficiency and the Betz limit
The rotor of a HAWT intercepts the wind and aims to transform as much of its kinetic
energy as possible into useful mechanical energy. Although it is tempting to imagine that an
ideal rotor could do this perfectly, a few moments’ thought reveals a serious problem. To
extract all the kinetic energy from a moving stream of air, it must be brought to a complete
standstill, yet this is impossible because the air must pass through the rotor’s swept area and
continue its journey on the far side. It cannot “pile up” in front of the rotor. So, how much
kinetic energy can actually be extracted?

This fundamental question was tackled by Albert Betz (1885–1968), a German naval engi￾neer and professor at the University of Göttingen whose interests turned toward wind energy
at the end of the First World War, quite possibly stimulated by the pioneering work being
done on wind turbines in neighboring Denmark. The rotor problem had strong links with a
naval one he had worked on earlier—the efficiency of marine propellers—and the theoretical
limitation to rotor efficiency he discovered is known as the Betz Limit.
The Betz Limit states that a rotor in a steady airstream cannot convert more than 16/27,
or 59%, of the wind’s kinetic energy into mechanical energy. Rather intriguingly, this figure
is based on the fundamentals of fluid dynamics and is independent of the precise type or
design of the rotor. Betz’s insight produced one of those moments when the elegance of
theoretical physics meets practical engineering, issuing a warning to designers not to attempt
the impossible. And, we need hardly be surprised that the practical difficulties of approaching
a theoretical limit mean that large modern HAWT rotors achieve maximum aerodynamic
efficiencies of about 50%, a figure we have used in the previous section.
How was the Betz Limit derived? We start by considering the stream tube shown in
Figure 3.4. Air enters the tube with a speed U1 and, after passing through the rotor, exits
with a lower speed U2. The only flow is across the ends of the tube, and the speed reduction
means that the tube’s cross-sectional area must increase toward the downstream side. This
is accompanied by a change in pressure across the rotor disc. There are some important
assumptions:
■ The air is incompressible and the flow homogeneous.
■ There is no energy loss due to friction.
■ The change in air pressure is uniform over the rotor disc (equivalent to specifying a
rotor with an infinite number of blades).
A full analysis based on classical linear momentum theory can be used to calculate the rotor’s
efficiency, thrust, and power output.3 From the point of view of efficiency—our primary
interest in this section—we may condense the argument considerably. First, it is clear that
the rotor causes the reduction of wind velocity from U1 to U2 shown in Figure 3.4, and this
occurs at the rotor plane. The average of these two velocities is therefore a good estimate of

the velocity Ub actually “seen” by the rotor blades:
Ub = (
U1 + U2
)
∕2 (3.5)
We now introduce an axial induction factor (a) defined as the fractional decrease in wind
velocity between the input to the stream tube and the rotor plane:
a = (
U1 − Ub
)
∕U1 = (
U1 − U2
)
∕2U1 (3.6)
giving:
Ub = (1 − a) U1 (3.7)
If a =0, the wind passes through the rotor unhindered, and no energy is captured. A value
a =0.5 implies that the velocity at the exit from the stream tube is zero, which is not allowed.
So, the Betz theory only holds over the range 0≤a <0.5.
The rotor efficiency, equal to the fraction of the incoming wind power extracted by the rotor,
is also referred to as the power coefficient (Cp) and is related to the axial induction factor
as follows:3
Cp = 4a(1 − a)
2 (3.8)
What value of the axial induction factor produces the greatest value of the power coefficient?
Differentiating Equation (3.8) and equating to zero, we obtain:
(3a − 1) (a − 1) = 0, giving a = 1∕3 or a = 1. (3.9)
The first of these values represents the required maximum. Substituting a =1/3 in
Equation (3.8), we obtain Betz’s famous result for the maximum value of power coefficient:
Cpmax = 4∕3(2∕3)
2 = 16∕27 = 59% (3.10)
Another interesting aspect is the change in the stream tube cross section from the upstream
to downstream side of the rotor. If a =1/3, maximizing the rotor power, the initial velocity
U1 is reduced by 1/3 at the rotor and by 2/3 at the exit from the stream tube. Since the air
is assumed incompressible, any velocity changes must be offset by changes in cross section.
Therefore, the stream tube must have an input cross section equal to 2/3 of the rotor disc
(swept area), expanding to twice the disc area downstream.
You may feel that these results, widely quoted and respected, rest on slightly shaky founda￾tions. It is hard for nonexperts to assess the validity of the aerodynamics involved, but we
know that assumptions such as homogeneous flow through the rotor and absence of friction
cannot truly apply in practice. This implies that the 59% is rather optimistic. But it has been
accepted as the absolute upper bound on the efficiency of a wind turbine rotor for nearly a
century, and it seems clear that nobody ever expects to exceed it!
There is one more significant caveat, and this concerns the nature of the disturbed airstream,
or wake, downstream of the rotor. Figure 3.4 shows air leaving the stream tube parallel to the
axis, at a reduced speed but without any rotation. But as wind passes through a HAWT and

exerts a torque on the rotor, there must be an opposite reaction on the airstream. In other
words, there is some vortex formation in the wake, illustrated by Figure 3.5. This imparts
unwanted rotational kinetic energy to the airstream and reduces the rotor’s power coefficient.
The greater the torque on the rotor, the stronger the vortex, so machines running at low speed
with high torque are most affected. Fortunately, vortex formation rarely subtracts more than
a few percent from the power coefficient of a well-designed rotor.
Albert Betz set the scene for rotor designers, placing an absolute limit on the height of their
ambitions. In the following sections, we shall see how they have attempted to climb ever
closer to the summit.
3.2.2 Lift and drag
The Betz Limit discussed in the previous section estimates the maximum efficiency of an
ideal rotor in a steady airstream as 59%. This famous result pays no attention to the actual
design of the rotor, leaving such small details to the designers of blades and hubs! Our own
story must pick up at this point since we wish to clarify the principles underlying today’s
large HAWT rotors.
Two basic forces dictate the interaction between the wind and the blades of a rotor, deter￾mining its aerodynamic performance. The first is lift, a beneficial force on which all modern
bladed turbines depend. And the second is drag, normally a detrimental force to be reduced
as far as possible—except in the case of machines such as the cup anemometer and Savonius
turbine (illustrated in Figure 3.3), which actually press it into service. A clear understand￾ing of lift and drag is essential for appreciating the fundamental aerodynamic principles on
which all wind turbines depend.
We start by considering the forces acting on a thin, flat plate placed in a steady wind.
Figure 3.6(a) shows an edge view, with the plate aligned exactly with the wind direc￾tion. Assuming the plate is very thin and smooth, there is negligible disturbance to the
airstream, and no forces are generated.
In part (b) the plate is inclined at an angle to the oncoming wind, which tries to push it away
with a drag force, and also to move it at right angles with a lift force. The net force on the
plate is the resultant (vector sum) of these two forces. Part (c) shows the plate positioned at

right angles to the wind. There is no lift, but the drag force is large. We see that the relative
amounts of lift and drag depend greatly on the inclination of the plate. To summarize:
■ Lift forces are produced perpendicular to the oncoming airstream.
■ Drag forces are produced parallel to the oncoming airstream.
Wind turbines may be broadly divided into two classes. Drag machines aim to present a
large surface area to the oncoming wind, like the plate in part (c) of the figure, maximizing
drag. The earliest recorded windmills, made in the Middle East over a thousand years ago,
relied upon drag. A Savonius turbine also works mainly on this principle, so does a cup
anemometer. In a different context, the spinnaker of a sailing boat, billowing out at the
front of the boat with a following wind, pushes the boat forward by “catching” as much
wind as possible. In all these cases, it is clear that the drag device—cup, scoop, or sail—can
never move faster than the wind itself. The rotational speed of a turbine that operates on the
drag principle is limited by the speed of the wind.
The second main type of wind turbine is the lift machine. Bladed windmills and wind tur￾bines use lift to generate forces at right angles to the wind, producing a twisting force or
torque on the main shaft and delivering useful power. The concept was well understood by
the engineers who designed and built Europe’s traditional windmills. Today’s large HAWTs
continue the tradition and are entirely driven by lift forces; drag forces, far from helping, are
a hindrance. Returning to our sailing boat analogy, the mainsail and jib of a racing dinghy,
unlike the spinnaker, are carefully designed to enhance lift and allow the boat to move at
right angles (or even “closer”) to the wind.
In such cases, there is no obvious relationship between the speed of the wind and that of the
machine; indeed, the speed of a lift machine, although dependent on wind speed, is by no
means restricted to it. An inspiring example is provided by British engineer Richard Jenkins
who broke the world speed record for a wind-powered land vehicle in 2009 (see Figure 3.7).
His racing car Greenbird, propelled by a rigid vertical “sail” with many of the characteristics
of a turbine blade or aircraft wing, attained a speed of 126 mph (203 kph) on the dry bed of
Ivanpah Lake in California.3 And guess what—the average speed of the wind that propelled
him was only about 35 mph! Greenbird admirably demonstrates that lift efficiently harnessed
and drag effectively minimized are key to modern wind engineering.
Although large HAWTs rely on lift forces, the way in which they act on rotor blades is subtle
and somewhat mysterious to many people. Fortunately, we can broach the topic gently by

considering a more familiar situation—lift-and-drag forces acting on the wing of an aircraft.
Figure 3.6(b) shows a flat plate inclined at an angle to the wind, generating both lift and drag.
What it does not show is the turbulence and eddies produced on the plate’s “downwind” side,
which accentuate drag. For a machine designed to operate on the lift principle with minimum
drag, special care must be taken to avoid turbulence by using a well-designed airfoil section
instead of a simple flat plate.
All this has quite a history. By the time the Wright brothers made their powered flights at
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in the first decade of the last century, they were fully aware of
the crucial importance of wing shape for maximizing lift and minimizing drag (Figure 3.8).
Experiments carried out by a number of investigators since the late 18th century, and con￾tinued by the Wrights themselves, had established the efficacy of double-surfaced airfoils
resembling the wings of a bird. Furthermore, it was understood that a cambered wing, curved
more on the upper surface than the lower, generates lift due to reduced pressure above and
increased pressure below. Ever since the early days of powered flight, aeronautical engineers
have striven to perfect airfoil sections, and their efforts have certainly influenced the modern
renaissance of wind energy.
Figure 3.9 shows a typical airfoil section through the wing of an aircraft facing a horizontal
airstream. There are several important features:
■ The airstream divides between the upper and lower surfaces. Since the upper surface is
more curved (cambered), the air must travel further and faster over it, lowering the pres￾sure. Conversely, the lower airstream exerts positive pressure. Both effects contribute
to lift.

■ The airflow over a well-designed smooth wing stays close to the wing surfaces, without
forming eddies or turbulence. This reduces drag—although there is inevitably some
residual drag due to surface friction.
■ The line between the center of the airfoil’s leading edge and the trailing edge is known
as the chord. It is typically kept inclined to the airstream at a small angle (𝛼) known as
the angle of attack, to optimize lift.
The four red arrows in the figure indicate the directions (but not the relative strengths) of
four key forces. Assuming the aircraft is in level flight at constant speed:
■ Lift (also produced by the other wing, and probably a tailplane) is at right angles to
the oncoming airstream and exactly balances the weight of the aircraft.
■ Drag (also on the other wing and the aircraft’s fuselage) is exactly counteracted by the
thrust of the engine(s).

If the lift increases, the aircraft gains height; if the drag increases, it loses speed. In level flight
at constant speed, lift equals weight and drag equals thrust.
An important measure of an airfoil’s quality is its lift-to-drag ratio. Ideally, plenty of lift
is provided to support the aircraft’s weight, but little engine power is needed to overcome
drag, leading to good fuel economy. The greater the lift-to-drag ratio, the better. We shall
have more to say about the airfoils used in today’s large HAWTs in Section 3.2.4.1.
There is one more important, and potentially disastrous, aspect of flight that should be men￾tioned here: the condition known as stall. If an aircraft gets into a “nose-up” attitude at low
speed, the lift provided by its wing airfoils may decrease drastically, and the drag increases,
causing it to crash—a pilot’s nightmare. Stall is also very important to wind turbines and,
interestingly, not only in a negative sense. Although it is generally undesirable for turbine
blades to enter a stall condition during normal operation, in very strong winds deliberate
stall may be used to limit the amount of power generated by a rotor, protecting the machine
from damage. We will consider the positive and negative aspects of stall in Section 3.2.4.2.
The term “lift” is clearly appropriate for an aircraft, which is literally held up in the sky by it,
but in other machines lift has a different function. For example, Greenbird’s vertical “wing”
(see Figure 3.7) generates a lift that acts horizontally, propelling the vehicle forward rather
than skyward. A HAWT uses a lift to generate rotation around a horizontal axis. Regardless
of how the lift is used, an efficient lift machine depends on a high lift-to-drag ratio.
We are now ready to explore the effects of lift and drag on a turbine blade in some detail.
Imagine a section through the airfoil, fairly near the hub, as shown in Figure 3.10. The
wind blows horizontally from left to right and, viewed from the front, the rotor is turning
clockwise. Clearly, in this view, the airfoil section has a very different orientation from that of
an aircraft wing in level flight, and this can be confusing. So, let us start by emphasizing that,
viewed from the front, the airfoil presents its “underside” toward us—what, in an aircraft,
would be its lower surface. The more curvy “topside” is out of sight and it follows that the
lift force is acting somewhat away from us and toward the back of the turbine. With this in
mind, what follows should be fairly straightforward!
There are other important distinctions between the aerodynamic environments of a wind
turbine and an aircraft in level flight. As a turbine rotates, it creates its own wind at right
angles to the “natural” wind, and it is the resultant wind that acts upon the blades. Rather
than experience the wind coming from the left side of the figure, the blades operate in an
airflow coming more from the direction of rotation. This is illustrated in the figure by blue
vectors 1, 2, and 3 that indicate wind strength as well as direction. They are:
1. The “natural” wind at the turbine rotor, coming horizontally from the left.
2. The additional wind was caused by rotation.
3. The resultant wind acting on the airfoil is equal to the vector sum of 1 and 2.
We now consider the forces generated, shown by numbered red and orange vectors. The air￾foil is inclined at a suitable angle of attack (𝛼), generating plenty of lift (4) at right angles to
the resultant wind. There is also some drag on the airfoil (5), and the net force it generates
(6) is the vector sum of lift and drag (the amount of drag has been exaggerated here to show
its effect clearly). And now comes a key point: we may resolve the net force (6) into two com￾ponents: a desirable radial component (7) that produces blade rotation and an unwelcome
axial component (8) that tries to bend the blade toward the back of the turbine.

Figure 3.10 Wind speeds and forces on a HAWT airfoil.
Figure 3.10 encapsulates and explains ideas that many people find challenging. In particular,
it shows that:
■ To be effective, the blade airfoil must be inclined at a suitable angle to the resultant
wind.
■ The direction of the resultant wind depends on the ratio between the speed of the
natural wind and the speed of the turbine.
■ Drag on the blade causes its net force (6) to move slightly away from the direction of
the lift force (4) toward the back of the turbine, reducing the useful radial force (7) and
increasing the undesirable axial force (8). This emphasizes once again the value of a
high lift-to-drag ratio.
There is one further major distinction to be made between the aerodynamic environments
of a turbine blade and an aircraft wing. So far we have considered a point on the blade
fairly near the hub. But the wind speed caused by rotation equals 𝛺r, where 𝛺 is the angular
velocity of the rotor in radians per second, and r is the radius considered (the distance from
the center of the hub). So, at a given speed of rotation, and with a constant incoming wind
speed, the speed and direction of the resultant wind vary according to the distance from the
hub. This is quite different from an aircraft wing in level flight, which experiences the same
wind speed and direction along its length. And the upshot is that, in order to optimize lift
along the length of a turbine blade, it must be progressively twisted from hub to tip.
This important conclusion is illustrated by Figure 3.11, showing typical wind speeds and
directions at three points along a blade. The right-hand diagram refers to a point near the
blade tip at a distance R from the hub (R being the rotor radius). The “natural” wind, coming

in from the left, is denoted by Ub (see also vector no.1 in Figure 3.10). The wind speed caused
by rotation, equal to 𝛺R, is here shown as equal to 9Ub. The ratio between the rotational
and natural wind speeds at the blade tip is therefore equal to 9 and is referred to as the tip
speed ratio. It normally lies in the range 5 to 10 for large modern HAWTs and, as we shall
see later, is one of the most significant parameters affecting turbine performance. Note that,
near the blade tip, the resultant wind is almost entirely due to the rotational component, so
the outer sections of the airfoil must perform well in an air speed many times greater than
that of the incoming, “natural,” wind.
The central diagram refers to a point two-thirds along the blade from the hub. The “natural”
wind vector is the same, but the rotational wind speed is only two-thirds as great. The resul￾tant wind is correspondingly reduced but is still dominated by the rotational component. The
left-hand diagram takes these trends further, showing wind conditions at a point one-third
along the blade from the hub. Even here, the rotational wind is considerably stronger than
the natural wind. And notice how the direction of the resultant wind changes from hub to
tip, making angles of 72∘, 81∘, and 84∘ with the rotor axis—the important effect that requires
the blade to be progressively twisted (Figure 3.12).
Actually, it is more complicated than this because, as we have shown in Chapter 2, wind
is highly variable. The speed of the “natural” wind impinging on a turbine rotor is always

fluctuating. Some turbines are designed to run at more or less constant speed, but most large
modern machines adapt their speed to the strength of the wind by swiveling the complete
blade around its longitudinal axis using pitch control, improving efficiency over a wide range
of wind speeds. We will explore these important topics in the following sections.
3.2.3 Rotor speed
How fast should a large HAWT rotate? The answer to this basic question, which depends
mainly on aerodynamics, has important implications for the mechanical and electrical
aspects of turbine design. Machines rated at several megawatts are now commonplace, and
the industry is busy contemplating rotors rated at 10 MW for offshore wind farms, sweeping
areas of the sky bigger than an international football pitch. The speed at which such giants
rotate is obviously a major issue.
We have already seen that the Betz Limit places a theoretical ceiling of 59% on the efficiency
of a wind turbine rotor, regardless of its detailed design or speed of rotation. We have also
discussed lift-and-drag forces, explaining how they act on a turbine airfoil and have explained
the need for a HAWT blade to be progressively twisted from hub to tip. It is now time to relate
these ideas to rotor speed and the way in which it may be varied to suit the wind conditions.
It is helpful to start by recalling the simple relationship between the power, speed, and torque
of a rotating machine:
P = 𝛺T = 2𝜋NT (3.11)
74
 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ by ibrahim ragab - Oregon Health & Science Univer , Wiley Online Library on [31/10/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseWind turbines
where P is the power measured in Watts, 𝛺 is the angular velocity in radians per second, N is
the speed in revolutions per second, and T is the torque measured in Newton meters (Nm).
For example, suppose a large turbine rotor is generating 3 MW of mechanical power while
turning 12 times per minute, or once every 5 seconds. In this case,
P =3 × 106 and N =0.2, so the torque is given by:
T = P∕2𝜋N = 3 × 106
∕0.4𝜋 = 2.39 × 106 NM (3.12)
We should pause for a few moments to consider this enormous figure. A force of 1 Newton
is close to one-tenth of a kilogram weight, so the twisting effort on the rotor shaft is about
240,000 kg m, thus 240 ton m. Imagine an Indian elephant weighing 2.4 tons standing on
the end of a long (and light) horizontal lever, the lever would need to be 100 m long for the
animal to produce this amount of torque!
This example emphasizes that large HAWT rotors are quintessentially high-torque,
low-speed machines, unusual in today’s technological world. By comparison, generators in
conventional power plants usually run at 3000 revolutions per minute (rpm), or 3600 rpm in
the USA. A machine running at 3600 rpm generates 300 times as much power as one running
at 12 rpm, for the same amount of torque. Ask any electrical or mechanical designer, and
he or she will confirm a general preference for high speed and low torque. Large low-speed
HAWTs demand heavy shafts, expensive bearings, and high-ratio gearboxes (or specially
designed low-speed electrical generators). This is bulky, heavy stuff requiring rotors and
nacelles weighing hundreds of tons to be lifted and maintained on top of high towers.
Since power is proportional to the product of torque and speed, why not reduce the torque
and increase the speed of megawatt rotors? The answer lies mainly in the aerodynamics of
turbine blades, and we have already hinted at it in the previous section: the ratio between
the rotational speed of the blade tips and the speed of the incoming wind—the tip speed
ratio—has a major influence on rotor efficiency.
Figure 3.14 shows a typical plot of the power coefficient (Cp) against the tip speed ratio (𝜆) for
a large HAWT with blades rigidly attached to its hub (as in many older, simpler, machines).
We see that tip speed ratios between 5 and 10 are the most efficient at capturing the power in
the wind. The famous Betz Limit of 59% remains beyond reach at the top of the figure, but
values up to about 50% are possible provided the turbine speed is well-chosen in relation to
the incoming wind speed. Ideally, the turbine should track the wind speed to maintain 𝜆 at,
or close to, its optimum value. But, if a fixed-blade turbine is designed to run at a particular
speed, it is clear that the optimum value of 𝜆 can only occur at one wind speed. In variable
winds, fixed blades and a constant turbine speed mean that the power coefficient will often
be well below its maximum value (Figure 3.13).
The precise form of the Cp −𝜆 curve depends on blade geometry and some complicated the￾ory well covered elsewhere.3, 4 Although intuition is a somewhat risky substitute for proper
analysis, in this case, a simple “thought experiment” may help us understand what is going
on. So let us imagine a large fixed-blade rotor, temporarily uncoupled from its gearbox and
generator, and held stationary by a brake. The wind is blowing steadily at moderate speed.
The brake is now released, and the rotor starts to turn, running freely in its bearings. Since
we are not trying to generate any electricity, the torque is used entirely to accelerate the rotor;
but both torque and acceleration are initially small because the airfoils’ angle of attack is not
well suited to the incoming wind direction—we are at the left-hand end of the Cp −𝜆 curve.
As the rotor speed and tip speed ratio increase, the blades become more and more effective,

generating plenty of torque and accelerating the rotor rapidly toward the peak of the curve.
If we were generating electricity, this is where the rotor speed should ideally be held; but in
this experiment, we are allowing it to run free, eager to see what happens—and hoping that
it will not break up!

Unhindered by the need to generate electricity, the rotor’s torque continues to provide accel￾eration and the tip speed ratio increases further, toward the right-hand end of the curve. The
fixed blades now become less effective, their orientation less and less suited to the resultant
wind which is now mainly due to the high speed of rotation. There is less lift and an increas￾ing amount of drag on the blades, especially due to turbulence near the blade tips, which
are now moving at very high speed. Eventually, we reach a speed at which diminishing lift
is exactly counteracted by increasing drag, and there is no net torque available for further
acceleration. The rotor has reached its maximum free-running speed at this particular wind
strength.
We can now see, in broad terms, why the power coefficient Cp in Figure 3.14 behaves as it
does. It is zero when 𝜆 is zero because power is proportional to the product of speed and
torque, so “no speed, no power.” It reduces to zero again at some high value of 𝜆 (typically
between 15 and 20), because the rotor’s diminishing torque is all being used to counteract
drag. In between, it can generate useful power, especially if 𝜆 is close to optimum.
Thought experiments are cheap, risk-free, and may give valuable insights; but it is time to
return to reality. So let us consider a 3-MW HAWT rotor, working steadily at half its rated
power in a wind speed of 11 m/s. Typical figures might be:
■ Rotor power: 1.5 MW
■ Wind speed: 11 m/s
■ Rotor diameter: 95 m
circumference: 298 m
rotational speed: 14 rpm

tip speed: 69 m/s
torque: 1.02 × 106 Nm
■ Tip speed ratio 6.3
With a tip speed ratio of 6.3, the turbine is likely to be operating efficiently. Note the tip speed
of 69 m/s = 248 kph = 155 mph: a veritable hurricane is blowing over the outer portions of
the blades! It is also worth noting that the blade tips, rotating at a radius R with angular
velocity 𝛺, have an acceleration toward the center (the hub axis) equal to 𝛺2R. So in this
case the acceleration is:
𝛺2
R = (2𝜋N)
2
R = (2𝜋14∕60)
2
95∕2 = 102 m∕s
2 = 10.4 g (3.13)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2). In other words, the radial force required
to keep the outer portion of a blade in place is about 10 times its own weight, giving some
idea of the huge longitudinal stresses on the blade as a whole, which are transmitted down
to the blade root and then to the hub. Of course, there are also large wind forces producing
rotation and bending the blade toward the back of the turbine (see Figure 3.10). The design
of large HAWT rotors and blades is a mechanical engineering, as well as an aerodynamic,
challenge.
So far we have considered a turbine with blades fixed rigidly to the hub. But the blades of
today’s powerful HAWTs can generally be rotated about their longitudinal axes, altering their
pitch and allowing the angle of attack of the airfoils to be adjusted to the direction of the
resultant wind. And, if the wind speed is more than needed to generate the rated output
power, the blades can be pitched to spill the excess. We shall have more to say about pitch
control later.
Many large machines also operate at variable speeds, allowing the tip speed ratio to be
kept close to its optimum value as the wind speed varies. Speed control makes better use of
the available wind resource, giving improved rotor efficiencies and higher annual electricity
yields. This is illustrated by Figure 3.15, showing the electrical output achieved when turbine
speed is matched to incoming wind speed, optimizing the tip speed ratio 𝜆. In this example,
the turbine achieves its rated power output (denoted as 100%) at an average wind speed of
12 m/s when running at a rated speed (100%) with the optimum value of 𝜆. If the turbine
speed is too low or too high the electrical output is reduced, as shown by the 12 m/s curve.
This is similar to the Cp −𝜆 curve of Figure 3.14, except that we are now plotting turbine
rotation speed instead of tip speed, and electrical power output instead of power coefficient
(assuming a constant conversion efficiency between mechanical and electrical power).
At a lower average wind speed—say 9 m/s—the turbine speed must be reduced by about 25%
to maximize power output; and, of course, the peak is considerably lower because there is less
power in the wind at 9 m/s than at 12 m/s. If the wind drops further to 6 m/s, turbine speed
must fall by about 50%, and the maximum power is only about one-eighth of its value at
12 m/s (as expected from the cubic relationship between wind speed and power, discussed in
Section 2.1). The heavy red curve in the figure joins all the maximum power points, showing
how the turbine speed should ideally be adjusted to the wind speed to achieve maximum
power output.
Tracking wind speed in this way helps optimize power production over a wide range. It is
most valuable at intermediate wind speeds—say between 5 and 12 m/s in this example. Below

5 m/s, there is very little power in the wind anyway, and above 12 m/s there is an excess.
Generally, turbine speed control over a range of about 2.5:1 gives the required flexibility. A
further advantage of speed variation is that it allows an increase in wind strength to be taken
up by increased rotor speed rather than rotor torque and may be viewed as a form of torque
control, preventing excessive torque on the drive train and electrical generator.
Rather than providing continuously variable-speed control, some simpler turbines have elec￾trical generators that can operate at just two fixed speeds, with reduced flexibility. However,
the current trend, especially with the largest machines, is toward continuous speed control.
The above analysis brings out many important points, but we must remember that wind
is often highly variable. The picture painted in Figure 3.15, based on average wind speeds
blowing steadily in strength and direction, is inevitably rather oversimplified. Complicating
factors include the following:
■ The presence of wind shear means that wind speeds are generally higher at the top of
the rotor’s swept area than at the bottom. Blades therefore experience cyclical fluctu￾ations in tip speed ratio and aerodynamic loading as they rotate.
■ Turbulence, often more serious at onshore sites than at offshore ones where the wind
blows more steadily, can present rotors and blades with rapid changes in wind speed.
The rotor’s pitch and speed control systems may be unable to respond in time, forcing
blade airfoils to operate well outside optimal design conditions, mechanical as well as
aerodynamic.
■ So far in this book, we have tended to assume that “wild wind” fluctuates in speed,
but not in direction; or, if it does change in direction, the rotor may be turned to face
it “head on” using special inbuilt yaw motors. But here again, the changes may be too

fast for the rotor to respond effectively, leading the rotor to operate in wind that has a
substantial off-axis component.
The net effect of all this is a more complicated wind regime than implied by Figure 3.15—and
indeed by our previous discussions of turbine power output and annual electricity yield. And
yet our main conclusions about rotor speed remain valid, even if the rotor often finds itself
operating in less-than-ideal conditions.
3.2.4 Rotor blades
3.2.4.1 Choosing airfoils
We now turn to airfoil design, a topic that could fill hundreds of pages on its own! We will
restrict ourselves here to a short review of its historical background and the main technical
issues confronting the designer.3, 4
Several important issues relating to blade and airfoil design have been introduced in previous
sections:
■ However excellent is the design of its blades, and well-chosen its rotation speed, a rotor
cannot capture more than 59% of the power in a steady airstream—a theoretical limit
based on momentum theory that was established by Albert Betz back in the 1920s. In
practice, large modern HAWT rotors achieve values up to around 50%.
■ The diameter of a well-designed HAWT rotor, and hence the length (but not the
detailed shape) of the blades, is essentially proportional to the square root of its rated
power output—see Equation (3.4).
■ The lift forces generated by blade airfoils have a radial component that translates into
torque applied to a turbine’s main shaft. There is also an unwanted axial component
that tends to bend the blades backward, and this is aggravated by drag forces on the
blades—see Figure 3.10. Therefore, blade airfoils need high lift-to-drag ratios.
■ The blades of a HAWT must be progressively twisted from hub to tip to maintain a
suitable angle of attack toward the resultant wind—see Figure 3.11.
■ The tip speed ratio has a major effect on a rotor’s aerodynamic efficiency, with opti￾mum values typically in the range of 5 to 10. This in turn influences the range of suitable
turbine speeds as wind strength varies.
In the early years of the wind energy renaissance, it was obviously sensible for blade designers
to draw on the impressive body of information about aircraft airfoils that had been accu￾mulated since the Wright brothers made their first powered flights in 1903. Aeronautical
engineers spent almost a century developing airfoils for a huge variety of fixed-wing aircraft,
military and civil, with a wide range of operational duties. They had also fine-tuned airfoil
sections for aircraft propellers and helicopter rotors—spinning devices that share many of
the aerodynamic features of wind turbines, even if they are designed to create wind rather
than capture it!
However, it became clear in the 1980s that new thinking was required, and much research
on wind turbine airfoils has since been done in the USA, the UK, Germany, Denmark, and
80

the Netherlands. Several problems affecting wind turbine performance have received special
attention:3
■ Roughness on the leading edges of conventional airfoils caused by accumulations of
insects, dirt, or ice can seriously degrade rotor power output, in extreme cases by as
much as 40%. It is obviously difficult, and expensive, to clean the blades of a large
turbine regularly.
■ Traditional aircraft airfoils tend to produce far too much power at very high wind
speeds, endangering turbine equipment, especially in machines with fixed blades.
■ When turbine blades incorporate pitch control allowing excessive wind power to be
“spilled,” sudden gusts may occur too fast for the control system to respond, generat￾ing extreme forces.
■ The very long blades of today’s large HAWTs need special, thick airfoil sections near
the hub for structural strength and support.
The last of these points leads to a related issue: the need to taper turbine blades from hub
to tip. Figure 3.16 showed such tapering very clearly, and you may have previously noticed
it in Figures 2.7 and 3.1. In fact, the blades of today’s large HAWTs are invariably tapered
(as well as twisted), reaching maximum width and thickness soon after leaving the hub
and progressing to a much smaller, thinner section at the tip. From a mechanical point of
view, this is certainly desirable because, as we noted in the previous section, longitudinal

(𝛺2R) stresses at the blade root caused by rotating mass—especially mass near the tip—can
be very large. From this point of view, the lighter the outer sections of the blade, the
better. And, of course, tapering reduces the amount of expensive material used in blade
construction.
But, there are also compelling aerodynamic reasons for tapering a turbine blade. In a
nutshell, theoretical approaches to blade design show that, for optimum performance, the
chord of the airfoil section should be progressively reduced from hub to tip.3, 4 Intuitively,
we may imagine that a high lift-to-drag ratio at the tip requires a slim airfoil with a small
chord because of the very high resultant wind speeds, which are mainly due to rotation
(Figure 3.17). Certainly, drag forces at the tip are very serious for rotor efficiency and must
be minimized. But as we go back toward the blade root, the lower resultant wind strength
is adequately captured by a thicker, wider, airfoil.
To summarize, the tip of a blade is best fashioned as a relatively narrow, thin airfoil giving a
high lift-to-drag ratio, whereas the root region, which accounts for a very small proportion of
the rotor’s swept area, must provide strength and structural support. In practice, the differing
airfoil sections along the length of a blade are often chosen as members of an airfoil “family,”
specially tailored to address the above problems.3
The blade designer, in addition to choosing an appropriate family of airfoil sections, must
consider the mechanical strength required to withstand static and dynamic forces, control
strategies for survival in extreme wind conditions, potential noise problems, and material
and manufacturing costs.
There is also the very important question of blade (and therefore rotor) efficiency in the wind
regime for which the turbine is intended. We have already given this question some attention,

explaining how speed control can be used to improve efficiency as wind speed varies (see
Figure 3.15). Rather than focus on maximizing the power coefficient over a narrow range of
wind speeds—an approach commonly adopted back in the 1980s—today’s blade designers
try to take the full range of wind speeds and conditions into account, maximizing annual
energy capture.
A powerful weapon in the designer’s armory is the so-called blade element method for predict￾ing the torque and power generated by a particular blade geometry. Rather than consider the
rotor as a circular disc that extracts kinetic energy from the wind uniformly over the whole
swept area (as in Section 3.2.1), blade element theory divides the disc into a large number
of thin annular sections at different radii from the hub. It then estimates the lift-and-drag
forces on each portion of the blade as it moves around an annular section, as a function
of wind speed, rotor speed, and the particular airfoil used at that radius. In this way, the
designer can check and refine blade shapes for their aerodynamic performance and energy
production. Details of the method are beyond the scope of this book but are well explained
elsewhere.3, 4
3.2.4.2 Stall and pitch control
The aerodynamic condition known as stall can sometimes be catastrophic for an aircraft,
but it has both positive and negative implications for wind turbines. In some machines, stall
is deliberately used to limit the amount of power captured by the rotor in high winds, pre￾venting damage. To understand how stall affects turbine operation, we need to explore the
nature of the airflow pattern over an airfoil section.
Back in Section 3.2.2, we described the lift-and-drag forces acting on an aircraft wing in
level flight and illustrated typical airflow over an airfoil in Figure 3.9. In this figure, the
flow is “ell-behaved,” with the airfoil inclined at an angle of attack (𝛼) that generates plenty
of lift and very little drag—as the designer intended. Typically, an airfoil section generates
increasing amounts of lift up to angles of attack of about 10∘; but beyond that the flow
over the top surface tends to break up, becoming turbulent and causing a sudden loss of
lift and increase in drag, as shown in Figure 3.18. This is the stall condition, and it is highly
significant for turbine blades as well as aircraft wings.
In more detail, low values of 𝛼 produce attached flow with the airstream remaining in close
contact with the upper surface of the airfoil. There is a thin boundary layer, where the air
speed increases from zero at the surface to that of the frictionless flow above. Flow in the
boundary layer is smooth and steady at low angles of attack and is referred to as laminar;
but if the angle of attack approaches a critical value, the boundary layer becomes increasingly
turbulent toward the trailing edge, and stall begins to develop.
The magnitude of the lift-and-drag forces acting on an airfoil must clearly depend on its
surface area—in other words on its chord (width) and span (length). The larger the sur￾face presented to the oncoming wind, the larger the forces. So to compare the performance
of different wings, blades, and sections, lift-and-drag forces are commonly expressed per
unit of surface area and divided by the dynamic force of the wind to produce dimensionless
lift-and-drag coefficients relevant to a particular wind speed.3
Figure 3.19 shows how the lift-and-drag coefficients of a typical airfoil vary with the angle
of attack. As the angle is increased from zero up to around 10∘ the lift coefficient grows
more or less in proportion, typically peaking between 1.0 and 1.5, but then declines rapidly
as stall develops. The drag coefficient starts at a very low value—say around 0.01—but

increases dramatically in stall. These figures suggest lift-to-drag ratios up to around 150 for a
well-designed airfoil operating at optimum angles of attack. However, it must be emphasized
that the details, especially in the deep stall region, depend heavily on the particular airfoil
and wind speed considered.

How does all this relate to wind turbine performance? There are two main issues: the avoid￾ance of stall conditions in normal operation and the deliberate use of stall to prevent a rotor
from generating excessive power in very strong winds.
We will start by considering what happens when a rotor with fixed blades, running at constant
speed, encounters a change in wind speed. The solid blue vectors in Figure 3.20 represent the
“natural” wind, the wind due to rotation, and the resultant wind at three radii along a blade,
when the tip speed ratio is 9.0. This is similar to Figure 3.11, which we used to explain why
a blade must be progressively twisted toward the tip in order to maintain a suitable angle of
attack. But in Figure 3.20, we have added dotted lines to show what happens when the natu￾ral wind strength Ub increases by 50%, assuming the rotor speed is unchanged. The direction
of the resultant wind, and therefore the angle of attack of the fixed blades, increases by the
angles colored red in the figure: 3.2∘ at the tip, 4.5∘ at two-thirds radius, and 8.2∘ at one-third
radius from the hub. Of course, these are just representative figures, relevant to the tip speed
ratio and the percentage change of wind speed we have chosen. But they demonstrate a cru￾cial point: the blades’ angle of attack increases as the wind gathers strength, and the effect
is much more pronounced near the hub. Increasing the angle of attack by 8.2∘ is very likely to
cause stall; but by 3.2∘, much less so. We conclude that as the wind speed rises, the blades
will tend to stall progressively, starting near the hub and moving out toward the tip.

This seems a good moment for a historical diversion. The remarkable development of tur￾bine technology in Denmark, including the Gedser machine of the 1950s (see Figure 1.12),
convinced the Danes that some form of aerodynamic control mechanism should always be
incorporated into their large turbines to prevent damage or even destruction in extreme
winds. Danish machines imported into the USA during the Californian “wind rush” of the
early 1980s benefited greatly from this design philosophy and were far more robust and reli￾able than their rivals. The commonest approach used passive stall control, designing the fixed
blades to stall automatically and limit rotor power when the wind speed exceeded a certain
value. Other techniques included deployment of control surfaces such as tip brakes, or mov￾able flaps (ailerons) located near the trailing edges of the blades. Over many decades Danish
wind turbines have been renowned for their effective use of aerodynamic control.
However, the use of a passive stall in a fixed-blade machine, although conceptually straight￾forward and cheap to implement, gives a very limited form of aerodynamic control. Large
modern HAWTs are considerably more sophisticated. Start-up of a turbine may be achieved
by pitching the blades to give substantial lift at a standstill. Blade pitch refers to turning the
angle of attack of the blades of a rotor into or out of the wind to adjust the rotation speed
and the generated power. There is a specific pitch angle for any given wind speed to optimize
output power. Pitch angles greater or less than this value reduce power output, even to the
point of zero rotation with high winds. Variable pitch allows very effective active stall con￾trol in which the blades are pitched to give a smooth transition from normal to stall-limited
power generation, preventing overload in very high winds. In fact, excess wind power may
be “shed” either by pitching the blades to increase the angle of attack (the normal stall
condition) or by pitching them the other way toward a negative angle of attack (known as
feathering). The latter, often faster to achieve, may be preferable in gusty conditions.
3.3 Mechanics
Modern multi-megawatt wind turbines present big challenges to mechanical engineers:
rotors weighing over a hundred tons, nacelles with gearboxes and generators weighing
considerably more, and towers sufficiently robust to hold them all aloft. As well as ensuring
that rotor blades and hubs have sufficient strength and resistance to fatigue, mechanical
engineers must design gearboxes and high-torque drive trains to cope with fluctuating, and
occasionally extreme, aerodynamic loads.
As we have seen, the power rating of a large HAWT is mainly determined by its swept area,
which is proportional to the square of its diameter. But the weight of the rotor depends on
the amount of material used in its construction and, other things being equal, is propor￾tional to the cube of the diameter. So we must expect rotor weight to increase more than
proportionally to power rating—an unwelcome trend that is, however, already being coun￾tered in some of the largest machines by using carbon fiber materials in blade construction.
The weight and strength of a nacelle also increase with machine rating because it must house
a heavier, more powerful gearbox and generator, as well as support the rotor (Figure 3.21).
3.3.1 Gearboxes
To many people, a gearbox seems a commonplace object. Perhaps this is because we are used
to vehicle gearboxes, which are nowadays so reliable that they tend to be taken for granted.

Figure 3.21 Up it goes: the nacelle of a 5-MW HAWT (Source: With permission of Repower).
But the gearboxes used in large HAWTs are unusual, and deserve our attention, for two main
reasons:
■ Power ratings are relatively large. For example, since 1 horsepower (hp) is equivalent
to 746 W of electrical power, the gearbox of a 3-MW HAWT must be able to transfer
up to 3 × 106/746 = 4021 hp from the rotor to the electrical generator. The 10-MW
machines need gearboxes rated at over 13,000 hp.
■ A HAWT gearbox must increase the speed from the rotor to the generator. For
example, its input shaft may be rotating at 15 rpm and the generator at 1500 rpm—a
100:1 step-up ratio. Gearboxes used in other applications, including road vehicles, are
generally step-down devices with smaller ratios.
We should just mention that an important class of large HAWT uses specially designed
low-speed generators directly coupled to their rotors, avoiding the need for gearboxes. We
will discuss them in Section 3.4.2.2.
The two gear configurations in Figure 3.22 illustrate some important general princi￾ples underlying gearboxes. Part (a) shows two spur gears mounted on separate parallel
shafts. The larger gear is on the low-speed shaft, the smaller one is on the high-speed
shaft, and the speed ratio is equal to the ratio between their diameters (or numbers of
teeth). If we ignore the small power losses in well-designed gearboxes, we may equate the

input and output powers, so that:
2𝜋N1T1 = 2𝜋N2T2 and N1∕N2 = T2∕T1 (3.14)
where N1 and N2 are the input and output speeds, and T1 and T2 are the torques (see also
Equation (3.11)). This shows that the torque ratio between the input and output shafts is
the inverse of the speed ratio: if the speed is increased (as in a HAWT gearbox), the torque
reduces in proportion. The electrical generator coupled to the output shaft is a relatively
high-speed, low-torque unit compared with the rotor.
In practice, it is difficult to achieve speed ratios above six in a single-stage gearbox. Higher
ratios require intermediate shafts and extra gears, referred to as a gear train. The overall
ratio is then equal to the product of the individual ratios. For example, a ratio of 100:1 may
in principle be obtained using three pairs of meshing gears with ratios of 5, 5, and 4.
However, it will probably not surprise you to learn that the simple arrangement of spur gears
shown in the figure, or a multistage version of it, is not generally used in today’s megawatt
HAWTs. Designers tend to favor a combined spur/planetary gearbox, often in three stages,
based upon the planetary principle illustrated in part (b) of the figure. The main components
of a step-up planetary stage are:
■ A large-diameter carrier with a ring gear on its inside circumference, driven directly
by the low-speed (input) shaft.
■ Intermediate planet gears, each free to rotate on its own shaft and driven by the ring
gear.
■ A central sun gear, driven by the planets, connected directly to the high-speed (output)
shaft.
The planets have a smaller diameter than the carrier’s ring gear and therefore rotate faster
than the input shaft. The sun’s diameter is smaller than that of the planets and therefore

rotates faster still. The overall step-up speed ratio is given by:
S = 1 + (
dr∕ds
) (3.15)
where dr and ds are the diameters of the ring and sun gears, respectively.
There are two main advantages to this design:
■ The input and output shafts are coaxial, giving a compact and comparatively light
unit.
■ Many pairs of gear teeth mesh together, reducing the loading on each gear.
The weight of a large HAWT gearbox, like that of the rotor, tends to scale roughly in line with
the cube of the rotor radius, so the compactness and weight-saving of the planetary layout
are very helpful. Even so, the huge torque on the rotor shaft of a large HAWT (discussed
in Section 3.2.3) demands very robust, heavy gears at the low-speed end of a multistage
gearbox. And, of course, ruggedness and complexity come at a cost.
With the advance of power electronics, low-speed multipole generators driven directly by
turbine rotors without any need for gearboxes are of special interest; the development of
gearless wind turbines is discussed in Section 3.4.2.2.
3.3.2 Towers
Towers for windmills and wind turbines have a long history. By the end of the 18th century,
English and Dutch windmills had reached a high degree of sophistication, incorporating
rotating caps on the top of wooden or stone towers (see Figure 1.9). The towers needed
internal space, as well as the height and strength to support their rotors, because they housed
milling or pumping equipment, stores, and people. In later years, huge numbers of steel lat￾tice towers were manufactured for water-pumping windmills (see Figure 1.10), especially in
North America, and lattice designs were still widely specified up to the 1980s. Today, we can
occasionally spot an elderly tower or steel lattice windmill within sight of its modern coun￾terpart: a poignant reminder of how far wind engineering has progressed over the centuries
(Figure 3.23).
The new generation of megawatt HAWTs spearheading the current surge in wind energy
capacity are almost all mounted on tubular steel towers. Fashioned from steel plates, rolled
to produce the required curvature, and then welded, they give technical performance, ease
of maintenance, longevity—and, many would say, visual elegance. They also provide a pro￾tected enclosure for access to the nacelle and for cabling and services (Figure 3.24). Their
main technical requirements may be summarized as follows:
■ Strength and stiffness. The tower must be strong enough to support the weight of
nacelle and rotor (up to several hundred tons), and stiff enough to resist the large
wind forces acting on the rotor.
■ Height. Tower height is typically about one rotor diameter. However, the precise height
depends on the wind regime at the site, including the amount of wind shear, and on
potential visual intrusion. The top of the tower incorporates the interface with the
nacelle and includes the stationary part of the yaw drive mechanism.

Figure 3.23 Towers old and new in Portugal and Canada (Source: (a) With permission of Repower. (b) With
permission of Canadian Wind Energy Association).
■ Foundation. Large onshore wind turbines are generally secured on reinforced concrete
foundations that must be heavy enough to resist overturning in the most extreme wind
conditions. Occasionally turbines are sited on rock and must be secured by steel rods
inserted deep within it. Foundations for offshore turbines—generally a more challeng￾ing problem—will be discussed in the next chapter.
■ Resistance to corrosion. Steel towers must be well-protected against corrosion,
especially offshore. Special coatings/paints and/or steels with enhanced anti-corrosion
properties are available.
■ Safety. The inside of a tower must be designed for safe access, typically using guarded
ladders or climbing bars and anti-fall harnesses.
As we shall see in the next section, the properties of a steel tower, especially its mass and stiff￾ness, are very important because mechanical coupling with the rotor can produce significant
vibrations.
3.3.3 Vibration and fatigue
A large wind turbine turning steadily in a strong breeze appears as a model of calm, dig￾nified technology. Unlike a Formula 1 racing car powering through the gears or an airliner
straining along the runway to get airborne, the turbine refuses to be hurried, generating clean
electricity at its own pace.

However, external appearance is not always a good indicator of inner calm. A large HAWT
has to endure many forces, static and dynamic, that are not directly concerned with the
production of electricity. Static forces, for example, the load imposed by a steady wind on a
stationary rotor, or the weight of a tower on its foundations, are fairly easy to visualize. More
complicated are the cyclic forces that vary according to the position of the rotor, including
the effects of weight and wind shear on individual blades as they rotate. Noncyclic dynamic
forces, especially fluctuating wind forces acting on turbine blades and rotors, are the most
awkward of all, both theoretically and in practice. Dynamic forces may set up unwelcome
vibrations and, in the long term, cause fatigue and failure of mechanical components. And
in the most extreme weather conditions, it is the unpredictable ones that threaten a turbine’s
survival.
Our exploration of “wild wind” in Chapter 2 emphasized that wind is generally variable in
strength and direction. A turbine’s annual energy output and capacity factor are enhanced
by fluctuations in wind strength because of the cubic relationship between wind speed and
power, making periods of above-average wind speed highly productive. In strong, gusty
conditions, there are big variations in the power intercepted by a rotor and delivered by
the blades, often over time scales measured in seconds rather than minutes. All this must
be accommodated by the control systems that regulate rotor speed and blade pitching. It
is hardly surprising if such a demanding operating environment sets up vibrations, and

occasionally extreme loads, in the turbine’s mechanical components—even though the
stresses and strains are invisible to a casual onlooker (Figure 3.25).
The theory of structural vibrations, as applied to complicated mechanical components
including turbine blades, rotors, and towers,3 is beyond the scope of this book. However,
we can illustrate some key ideas and terminologies with a few simple experiments and
equations that illustrate, in broad outline, the issues facing designers of large wind turbines.
Imagine holding the long blade of a kitchen knife firmly down on a table as in part (a) of
Figure 3.26, then deflecting the handle with the other hand and letting it go—an experiment

that amuses almost every physics student. The knife vibrates up and down with a certain
frequency, and with diminishing amplitude, eventually coming to rest. If the blade is now
repositioned so that less of it overhangs the table, more strength is needed to deflect the
handle and, on release, the vibrations are faster. The time course of vibration is a decaying
oscillation whose frequency depends on stiffness and mass. Greater stiffness increases the
frequency; greater mass decreases it.
And why do the vibrations decay with time? It is due to damping caused mainly by air
resistance as the knife blade bends backward and forward. Without any damping, the vibra￾tions would continue indefinitely with a frequency known as the natural frequency, but the
vibrations die out with damping. Above a certain level of damping, a system displays no
oscillations at all, returning to its starting position without any “overshoot.”
Part (b) of the figure shows the second part of our experiment, in which two vertical wooden
rods are held firmly in a wooden block. Imagine deflecting the top of the tall thin rod with
a finger, then letting it go. Once again, assuming a small amount of damping, there will be
vibrations. The shorter, thicker rod will be much harder to deflect because of its far greater
stiffness; and, if any vibrations are visible, they will be at a higher frequency. Like the knife
blade in part (a), each rod responds in a manner determined by its inherent stiffness, mass,
and damping.
Although it is risky to stretch analogies too far, these experiments have considerable rel￾evance to vibrations in wind turbines. After all, a turbine blade is essentially a long object
held firmly, or cantilevered, out from the hub. It has certain mass, distributed along its length,
and stiffness that depend on its construction and the direction of bending. Subjected to a
sudden gust of wind, it will tend to vibrate, and the vibrations will fade with time depending
on the amount of damping. A turbine tower is even more obviously a cantilevered structure,
anchored firmly to the ground or seabed, and capable of swaying or vibrating. You may have
noticed certain similarity with our wooden rods (even though we have not put model nacelles
and rotors on the top!). With this motivation in mind, we will introduce a little mathematics.
Vibration theory is normally introduced by considering an idealized system comprising
“lumped” mass, stiffness, and damping elements—the simplest type of linear second-order
system. Such a system exhibits all the effects noted above and will serve well for our
discussion. In particular, decaying oscillations take the form:
x = A exp (
−𝜉𝜔nt
)
sin(
𝜔d t + 𝜑
) (3.16)
where x is the displacement from the resting position, A is the initial amplitude, 𝜉 is a damp￾ing constant, 𝜔n is the natural frequency measured in radians per second, 𝜔d is the vibration
frequency, and 𝜑 is a phase angle. This shows that the amplitude of the oscillations decays
according to a negative exponential at a rate determined by the damping constant 𝜉.
The vibration and natural frequencies are related by:
𝜔d = 𝜔n
(
1 − 𝜉2
)0.5 (3.17)
If 𝜉 =0, there is no damping, and the vibrations continue indefinitely at the natural frequency.
If 0<𝜉 <1, the frequency is reduced, and the vibrations decay. And if 𝜉 =1, the system is
said to be critically damped, settling back to its starting point without oscillation. Higher
values of 𝜉 denote a system that is overdamped and increasingly “sluggish.”

Figure 3.27 Vibrations in systems with mass, stiffness, and damping.
Figure 3.27 shows three typical responses of this type. Curve 1 reminds us of the kitchen
knife: the vibration decays slowly, with many oscillations before it dies out. The time interval
or period between successive peaks is T1 and the frequency in cycles per second (Hz) is its
inverse, thus f 1 = 1/T1 (note that the frequency in radians per second equals 2𝜋 f 1). Curve
2 denotes a stiffer system with more damping: the period T2 is shorter, the frequency f 2 is
higher, and it decays more rapidly. This might be like one of our wooden “towers.” And,
curve 3 shows the response of an overdamped system that returns to its starting position
without any oscillations.
The concept of natural frequency is so important for wind turbines that it deserves more
discussion. When a system is disturbed from rest and allowed to settle, any vibrations it
displays are “natural” to it and show how it behaves when left “on its own.” After the initial
disturbance, and assuming no further external energy is supplied, the frequency of vibration
is determined solely by the system’s mechanical properties—its stiffness, mass, and damping.
The response is characteristic of the system, not of the initial displacement or force that
disturbs it.
The vibrations shown in Figure 3.27 relate to simple mechanical systems, whereas complex
structures such as turbine rotors and towers generally possess many natural frequencies with
different amounts of damping. It is also important to realize that deflections or vibrations
set up in one part of a turbine may affect other parts due to mechanical coupling. The blades,
hubs, gearboxes, generators, nacelles, and towers of a wind turbine are all interconnected
mechanically, facilitating the transfer of vibration energy between them. It is quite possible
for a mechanical disturbance originating in one place to produce a vibration elsewhere. It is
rather like the opera singer who, as the story goes, produces a powerful note that shatters a
wineglass on the other side of the room.
The above ideas are highly relevant to large HAWTs for several reasons:
■ Vibrations may be set up by cyclic forces due to the rotation of the rotor and drive
train, and, by random, dynamic forces including wind gusts.
■ Mechanical structures including blades and towers have natural frequencies at which
they “prefer” to vibrate. Sudden disturbances tend to set up vibrations at the pre￾ferred frequency (or frequencies), which decay at a rate determined by the amount of

damping. And, as we shall see below, repetitive forces close to a natural frequency can
produce strong vibrations due to the phenomenon of resonance.
■ Dynamic forces on one part of a turbine may set up vibrations in another part due to
mechanical coupling.
So far we have considered vibrations caused by an initial disturbance, watching the system
respond and eventually settle “on its own.” But what if there are repeated disturbances that
occur at a frequency close to a natural frequency? A good example is cyclic forces due to
the rotation of a rotor. For example, suppose a three-bladed rotor is turning at 15 rpm and
producing various cyclic forces on the blades. There will be force components that fluctuate
at the blade-passing frequency, that is, 3 × 15 = 45 times per minute, corresponding to 0.75 Hz,
and some of the pulsating energy will no doubt be transferred to the tower by mechanical
coupling. It is not hard to imagine that unwelcome tower vibrations may be set up if 0.75 Hz
is at, or close to, one of the tower’s natural frequencies. And if the rotor keeps turning at
15 rpm, the vibrations will continue. This is known as resonance.
The classic approach to analyzing continuous vibrations in a linear system assumes that it
is disturbed by a sinusoidal force of variable frequency. Sinusoidal inputs have the special
property of producing sinusoidal responses at the same frequency, but with variable mag￾nitude (and phase). The magnitude (amplitude) of the response of a second-order system
with various degrees of damping is shown in Figure 3.28. Consider, for example, the red
curve for which 𝜉 =0.15. As the frequency of the sinusoidal input is increased from zero, the
response amplitude passes through a peak in the region of the system’s natural frequency
𝜔n, then falls away as the frequency rises further. We see that excitation close to the natu￾ral frequency causes resonance. It is not hard to imagine that strong resonance in a lightly
damped system can place big stresses on a component or structure, which may even cause

As the amount of damping increases, the resonance becomes less marked, as shown by the
orange and yellow curves in the figure. The resonant peaks are wider and occur at slightly
lower frequencies—see Equation (3.17). If 𝜉 =1, there is no resonance at all (green curve),
and the system is said to be critically damped.
As far as HAWT vibrations are concerned, we may expect the strongest ones to be caused by
forces at or very close to a natural frequency, especially if the damping constant 𝜉 is small.
Of course, cyclic forces arising in practice are most unlikely to be precisely sinusoidal; but if
they occur regularly at the right (or perhaps we should say wrong!) frequency, they have a
similar effect. It is like a child on a swing: give a gentle push at just the right moments, and
the swing goes higher and higher.
What does this imply for HAWT design? One of the most striking examples is provided
by steel towers, which are essentially cantilevered structures with low damping that support
large masses (nacelles and rotors) on the top. Of a tower’s many natural frequencies, only the
lowest or fundamental is normally of concern because it is most likely to coincide with cyclic
forces set up by the rotor. These are mainly at the rotation and blade-passing frequencies.
With this in mind, designers recognize three main classes of tower:3
■ Stiff tower. The fundamental natural frequency is above the blade-passing frequency
at the highest speed of the rotor. This normally avoids tower vibration problems.
■ Soft tower. The fundamental natural frequency is between the rotor rotation frequency
and the blade-passing frequency. In a three-bladed HAWT, these frequencies are in
the ratio 1:3, and they vary with rotor speed. For example, if a rotor’s working speed
range is 12 to 24 rpm, corresponding to 0.2 and 0.4 Hz, the blade-passing frequency
falls in the range of 0.6 to 1.2 Hz. A soft tower would therefore be designed to have its
fundamental frequency at around 0.5 Hz.
■ Soft-soft tower. The fundamental natural frequency is below both the lowest rotor
rotation frequency and the corresponding blade-passing frequency—in the above
example, less than 0.2 Hz.
Clearly, both the soft and soft-soft tower types may suffer significant vibrations as the rotor
and blades pass through the main resonant frequency during the start-up or shut-down of
the turbine. This raises the question: why not always design for a stiff tower? The answer lies
in economics and tower installation—a stiff tower needs more steel and is more difficult to
handle. So, why not construct towers with plenty of damping, to reduce or even suppress
vibrations? This is a question of practicality as well as economics, for structural steel is a
“springy” material with low inherent damping, and to dampen it down artificially would
be an expensive option. Better to be aware of the vibration problem, and design around it
(Figure 3.29).
Tower vibrations are fairly easy to visualize. They are important not only for the stresses they
place on the towers themselves, but for unwanted aerodynamic effects that a swaying tower
has on blade performance, and for the stresses it transfers to other turbine components. The
situation with blades is altogether more complicated. Many different forces tend to deform
or vibrate a blade as it rotates:
■ Gravity forces, due to the blade’s own weight, stretch or compress it when vertical, and
bend it when horizontal.
■ Centrifugal forces due to rotation stretch the blade regardless of its orientation.

Figure 3.29 Designed to withstand forces and vibrations: the tower and blades of a large HAWT (Source: With
permission of Repower).
■ Bending forces produced by the wind: a tangential component that generates useful
torque but tends to bend the blade “edgewise”; and an unwanted, and normally the
much larger, axial component bends the blade backward, causing “flapping.”
■ Gyroscopic forces caused by the yaw motion of the rotor. Whenever a spinning rotor
is adjusted to face the wind, it acts like a gyroscope, producing bending and torsion
forces according to the blade’s position.
Many of the above forces are either cyclic or fluctuate in a random fashion. Wind forces have
a steady component due to the average (mean) wind speed, with superimposed fluctuations.
All this leads to a highly complex, ever-changing, force scenario for turbine blades and tow￾ers. Although distortions and vibrations may not degrade the short-term performance of a
well-designed turbine, in the long term they threaten it through the process known as fatigue.
Fatigue occurs in engineering materials subjected to repeated cyclic loads and eventually—
perhaps after millions of “cycles”—causes failure. Typically, small cracks start to develop in
the material or component in the region of maximum stress and grow with repeated cycles.
Susceptibility to fatigue depends very much on the material: try bending a thin strip of alu￾minum sheet backward and forward, and it soon fails; steel survives much better. Today’s
large HAWTs contain a variety of structural materials including steel, fiberglass reinforced
plastic, and, increasingly in large blades, carbon fiber composites. All have their own distinc￾tive fatigue characteristics.

The development of fatigue depends on the magnitude as well as the number of load cycles,
making resonant conditions with low damping especially risky. Fatigue is also hastened
when a component or structure, already stressed by a steady load, has a cyclic load superim￾posed on it—a common situation in wind turbines. And while few manufactured products
experience more than a million load cycles in their working lives, turbine designers face a
bigger challenge. For example, a three-bladed machine turning at an average of 15 rpm for
18 hours a day over 25 years produces 3 × 15 × 60 × 18 × 365 × 25 = 4.43 × 108 load cycles at
blade-passing frequency. We are in the hundreds of millions. And if the load cycles excite
significant resonance in turbine components, we are also into dangerous territory. A severe
fatigue failure in one blade could so unbalance the rotor that the whole thing shakes to
pieces.
Progressive fatigue is to be expected in machines and structures subject to vibration and
should be considered a normal part of wear and tear. But a large HAWT must also be
able to withstand occasional extreme loads. Most of the time it operates within its design
parameters, with average wind speeds described by a Rayleigh or Weibull distribution (see
Section 2.2.2). It cuts in at one wind speed and starts generating, cuts out at a much higher
speed to avoid damage, and is expected to withstand a reasonable amount of turbulence.
But, it must also cope with extreme events—especially violent gusts superimposed upon
storm-force winds. There may also be sudden changes in wind direction and shear which
force the turbine’s speed, pitch, and yaw control systems into rapid response. We introduced
the theory behind the occurrence of extreme events, including the Gumbel distribution, in
Section 2.2.2. So, when discussing the slow and steady onset of fatigue, essentially an aging
process involving millions of load cycles, we should always bear in mind that a turbine is
also threatened by single, “once in a lifetime,” events.
3.4 Electrics
3.4.1 Alternating current (AC) electricity
The vast majority of today’s large wind turbines feed their electricity into power grids based
on AC electricity. The early years of the electrical power industry saw intense competition
between AC systems championed by Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) and DC, or direct current,
systems preferred by Thomas Edison (1847–1931) (Figure 3.30). However, the race was even￾tually won by AC, which came to dominate the generation, transmission, distribution, and
utilization of electrical energy during the 20th century. Tesla, born in what is now Croatia,
spent most of his life in New York and is particularly remembered for his invention of the
AC induction motors that today power much of global industry—and are intimately related
to a major class of wind turbine generators.
One of the principal advantages of AC electricity is that its voltage level may be easily
changed using transformers. Typically, AC is generated at one voltage level, transformed
up for long-distance transmission and distribution, and finally transformed down to a safe
voltage level for use by consumers. Whenever the voltage is raised, currents are reduced,
and vice-versa. Transmission at high voltage (and low current) reduces losses in power lines,
allowing the use of much smaller and less expensive conductors. At the consumer end, AC
is well suited to running cheap and efficient electric motors in a huge variety of applications,
and even keeps our electric clocks running on time!

However, we must be careful not to dismiss DC power transmission. The power-carrying
capacity of electric cables is generally greater when fed with DC rather than AC and DC is
often favored for very-long-distance transmission of bulk power from one region or coun￾try to another. DC also has special advantages for long submarine links, including cables
to connect offshore wind turbines to the land. We will return to this important topic in
Section 4.5.
In an AC system, voltages and currents in linear circuits and devices vary sinusoidally.
Currents flow backward and forward, changing direction at a rate determined by the grid
frequency—for example, 50 cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz), in Europe and 60 Hz in
North America. However, it is important to realize that the voltage and current waveforms,
although sinusoidal in shape, are not generally in phase with each other, and this has
profound implications for the generation and use of grid electricity. Nonlinear circuits,
which include electronic switches used in wind turbine generation and control, introduce
non-sinusoidal waveforms, and their analysis is more complicated. For the time being, we
will focus on linear circuits because they illustrate and explain many key aspects of AC
electricity.
In general, the time-varying waveform v(t) of an AC voltage may be expressed as:
v (t) = Vp sin(𝜔t + 𝜑) = Vp sin(2𝜋ft + 𝜑) (3.18)
where Vp is the peak value (amplitude), 𝜔 is the frequency in radians per second, f is the
frequency in Hz, t is the time in seconds, and 𝜑 is the phase angle. If 𝜑 =0 the function
is a sine wave that passes through zero at t =0. This may be thought of as a “reference”
waveform. Other waveforms of voltage and current with different phase angles are shifted
along the time axis with respect to the reference.
We now consider the voltage and current waveforms for three basic types of linear circuit
elements: resistors, inductors, and capacitors. Figure 3.31(a) shows two cycles, or periods, of
a continuous voltage waveform—a sine function with peak value Vp and period T (equal to

the reciprocal of the frequency in Hz). If this AC voltage is applied to a resistor of value R
ohms, as in part (b), the current that flows is proportional to the voltage at every instant, and
there is no phase shift. According to Ohm’s law, its peak value is Vp/R. The instantaneous
power dissipated in the resistor equals the product of voltage and current:

in the figure, represents the energy supplied by the AC source and dissipated in the resistor.
In some ways, this is all rather surprising. After all, if we turn on an electric heater or an
incandescent lamp—essentially both resistors—it is not obvious that the power is fluctuating
at twice the supply frequency, but this is because any resulting “flicker” is too fast for our
eyes and brains to follow.
It is clear from the figure that the average power dissipated in the resistor is half the peak
power, that is, Vp
2/2R. The same amount of power would be dissipated if it were connected
to a DC voltage of Vp∕
√
2 = 0.7071Vp. In other words, the heating effect of a sinusoidal
voltage with peak value Vp is the same as that of a DC voltage of Vp∕
√
2. Since heating is,
in an important sense, what matters (and what we pay for when we turn on a heater!) the
voltage of an AC supply is quoted as Vp∕
√
2, referred to as the rms (root mean square) value.
For example, the “220 V” of a European domestic supply refers to its rms value; the peak
value is 220√
2 = 311 V.
AC electricity becomes rather more interesting when we consider inductors and capacitors,
because they produce phase shifts between voltage and current waveforms. The inductor
shown in part (c) of the figure has the property of inductance, denoted by the letter L and
measured in Henrys (H). It may be thought of as an “ideal” coil of wire with no electrical
resistance. It does not dissipate energy (get warm) like a resistor; it can only store energy
in its magnetic field. To provide some motivation for the discussion that follows, we note
that all rotating electrical machines, including wind turbine generators, depend on coils and
magnetic fields. Inductance is central to their operation.
The figure shows current and power waveforms for an ideal inductor supplied with a sinu￾soidal voltage, and for the moment we will focus on phases, assuming for convenience that
the waveforms have unit amplitude. The key point to note is that the current waveform, col￾ored green, lags the voltage by a quarter of a period, in other words its phase angle is −90∘
(−π/2 radians). Intuitively, this is because the magnetic field takes time to wax and wane,
lagging behind the voltage waveform. Now sin(𝜔t −𝜋/2) = −cos(𝜔t), so the instantaneous
power supplied to the inductor has the form:
pL(t) = sin(𝜔t) (−cos(𝜔t)) = −sin(𝜔t) cos(𝜔t) = −0.5 sin(2𝜔t) (3.20)
This is shown as a red curve in part (c) of the figure. As with the resistor in part (b), the
power fluctuates at twice the supply frequency; but it now goes negative as well as positive.
The inductor alternately accepts power from the source and then returns it, so the average
power is zero. It is not a net consumer of energy; rather it uses current from the source to
establish an oscillating magnetic field.
To summarize, an “ideal” inductor or coil, when supplied with a sine wave of voltage, draws
a sinusoidal current that lags the voltage by 90∘. The source, although supplying voltage
and current, does not provide net power. The product of an inductor’s voltage and current is
therefore referred to asreactive power—one of the most important concepts in AC electricity.
Reactive power is measured in volt-amperes reactive to distinguish it from the real power
dissipated by a resistor, which causes heating and is measured in Watts (W).
So how is an AC generator affected by having to supply reactive power? Not much, you
might think, because its main task is clearly to supply real power for heating or doing use￾ful mechanical work. But there is a snag: although the current taken by a purely inductive
load does not cause power consumption in the load, that same current must originate in

the generator and flow along transmission lines and through transformer windings, all of
which possess some electrical resistance and generate unwanted heat. So in practice a cer￾tain amount of energy is wasted getting reactive power to a reactive load, and power utilities
tend to discourage reactive power demands which “use up” a substantial portion of their
equipment’s current-carrying capacity.
And now for the last in our trio of circuit elements—the capacitor. In its simplest form, a
capacitor may be thought of as a pair of close-spaced metallic plates. It has the property
of capacitance, measured in Farads (F). We can deal with it relatively quickly because in
many ways its behavior is the exact opposite of the inductor’s. Whereas the AC current in an
inductor lags the voltage by 90∘, in a capacitor it leads by 90∘. And, whereas the inductor
stores energy in a magnetic field, the capacitor stores it in an electric field set up between the
plates. Like the inductor, the capacitor alternately accepts power from the source and then
returns it, and the net power flow is zero. The current and power waveforms are shown in
part (d) of Figure 3.31, and the instantaneous power takes the form:
pc(t) = sin(𝜔t) cos(𝜔t) = 0.5 sin(2𝜔t) (3.21)
A capacitor also requires reactive rather than real power, but with phase relationships oppo￾site to those of an inductor. We will discuss several important ways in which capacitance
affects AC power grids.
So far we have placed emphasis on phase relationships and the concept of reactive power.
But how about the amplitudes of the currents that flow in inductors and capacitors? Specif￾ically, since in their ideal form they contain no resistance, what limits the currents? The
answer is their reactance which, like resistance, is measured in ohms (Ω); but, unlike resis￾tance, reactance is frequency-dependent and involves the 90∘ phase shifts we have described
above.
The reactance of an inductor is:
XL = 𝜔L = 2𝜋fL ohms (3.22)
where L is the inductance measured in Henrys. For example, in a 50-Hz AC system, an induc￾tor of 1 Henry (1 H) has a reactance of 100𝜋 = 314 ohms (Ω); in a 60-Hz system, the same
inductor has a reactance of 120𝜋 = 377 Ω. Inductive reactance is proportional to frequency.
The magnitude of AC current flowing in an inductor is simply equal to the AC voltage
divided by the reactance. This is analogous to Ohm’s law for a resistor—provided we remem￾ber the 90∘ phase shift. For example, a 1 H inductor, connected to a 50 Hz 220 V rms source,
takes a current of 220/314 = 0.70 A rms. The peak current is 0.70√
2 = 1.0 A.
Whereas the reactance of an inductor increases with frequency, that of a capacitor reduces.
It is given by:
XC = 1∕𝜔C = 1∕2𝜋fC ohms (3.23)
Once again, the magnitude of AC current that flows is equal to the voltage divided by the
reactance. As an example, you may like to check that a 0.0001 F capacitor connected to a
60 Hz 120 V rms source takes a current of 4.52 A rms.
So far we have considered resistors, inductors, and capacitors as “ideal” elements. In prac￾tice, of course, they are not ideal; for example, the wire of an inductor coil invariably has

some resistance. In other cases, we need to analyze circuits containing separate R, L, and C
components. They all take sinusoidal currents when supplied with sinusoidal voltages, but
amplitude and phase relationships are more complicated.
We can illustrate this with a simple example and at the same time introduce some further
ideas and terminologies. Figure 3.32(a) shows a resistor and inductor connected in series.
The resistor’s value is R ohms, and we have labeled the inductor’s reactance j𝜔L, rather than
just 𝜔L. This simple change is in fact highly significant. The letterj (pure mathematicians use
the letter i) denotes √
−1 and implies that the reactance involves a 90∘ phase shift. Mathe￾matically we are representing the reactance as an imaginary quantity, distinguishing it clearly
from the resistance R which is represented as a real quantity. The j-notation allows linear AC
circuits to be analyzed simply and elegantly using the rules of complex arithmetic.
A full account of the j-notation applied to AC circuits is a standard ingredient of electrical
engineering textbooks, but for our purposes it may be reduced to a few key ideas. To start,
we note that the resistor and inductor in Figure 3.32(a) are in series, and we may therefore
add the resistance and reactance to give their combined impedance:
Z = R + j𝜔L ohms (3.24)
The impedance, a complex quantity with real and imaginary parts, is represented in the
figure. The resistance is drawn as a real number, the reactance as an imaginary number, and
the impedance is found by vector addition. Alternatively, the impedance may be resolved
into real and imaginary components. It is somewhat analogous to resolving the wind force
on a turbine blade into axial and radial components—as we did in Figure 3.10.
The magnitude and phase of the impedance are given by:
∣ Z ∣= √(
R2 + 𝜔2L2
) and 𝜑 = tan−1 (𝜔L∕R) (3.25)
As an example, suppose that a coil with inductance 1 H and resistance 40 Ω is connected to a
50 Hz 220 V rms supply, and we wish to find the current that flows in the coil. The magnitude

and phase of the impedance are
∣ Z ∣= √(
402 + (100𝜋)
2)
= 317𝛺 and 𝜑 = tan−1 (100𝜋∕40) = 82.7∘ (3.26)
The magnitude of the current is therefore 220/317 = 0.69 A rms, and its phase angle with
respect to the voltage is −82.7∘. Note that since we are dividing the voltage by the impedance
to find the current, the positive phase angle associated with the impedance produces a nega￾tive phase angle for the current, in line with the normal rules of complex arithmetic.
A similar approach may be used to represent the real and reactive components of the power
supplied by an AC generator. Figure 3.32(b) shows a generator supplying voltage and current
via a transmission line to a load. In general, both line and load have reactance as well as
resistance, and the generator’s current is not in phase with its voltage. It supplies real power
(P) to the resistive components of line and load, and reactive power (Q) to the inductive and
capacitive components. The vector sum of these two powers gives the apparent power (S)
supplied by the generator, equal to the product of its rms voltage and current and measured
in volt-amperes (VA). For example, a generator might supply 100 kVA of apparent power,
consisting of 80 kW of real power and 60 kVAR of reactive power. Note that large quantities
are expressed in kVA or MVA equivalent to the use of kW and MW for real power.
As previously mentioned, the supply of reactive power uses up part of the current-carrying
capacity of a utility’s generators and transmission lines and wastes real power in associated
resistances. Commercial and industrial customers requiring substantial amounts of reactive
power are often charged special tariffs, depending on the power factor (F) of their loads. The
power factor is defined as the ratio between real and apparent power, and from Figure 3.32(b)
we see that it is also equal to the cosine of the phase angle 𝜑. Thus:
F = P∕S = cos 𝜑 (3.27)
If the power factor is unity, no reactive power is supplied, the phase angle is zero, and the load
is purely resistive. When reactive power is demanded, the power factor reduces and the phase
angle increases. A positive phase angle means the load is capacitive, giving a leading power
factor; a negative angle denotes an inductive load, producing a lagging power factor—typical
of industrial loads that include large electric motors. A power factor of 0.9 is typical of the
level below which utilities start to charge large consumers for reactive power.
The negative effects of reactive power may be counteracted, or offset, using power-factor
correction. Imagine, for example, that a load takes a current of 300 A at a lagging power
factor of 0.8, equivalent to a phase angle of −36.9∘. The current may be resolved into a real
component of magnitude 300 cos 36.9∘ = 240 A, and a reactive component of magnitude
1000 sin 36.9∘ = 180 A. Now suppose capacitors, placed across the load, are designed to
take a leading current of 180 A. This exactly counteracts the lagging current of the load and
supplies the required amount of reactive power. The utility now provides just the real power
via the transmission system, while the load and capacitor swap reactive power. This situation
has, in fact, already been illustrated in Figure 3.31. Parts (c) and (d) show that the reactive
current and power in the inductor and capacitor are in antiphase and will “cancel each other
out” if they have equal magnitudes. For this to happen their reactances must be equal at the
supply frequency, so that:
𝜔L = 1∕𝜔C and therefore C = 1∕𝜔2

A smaller (and therefore cheaper) capacitor may be used to give partial power-factor
correction—for example, raising it from 0.8 to 0.9. Large industrial and commercial users
of electricity often choose to install parallel banks of capacitors, switching in more or less
capacitance automatically as the power factor of their load changes.
Utilities often use correction equipment of their own because power factors close to unity
tend to enhance system stability as well as reduce resistive losses in generation and transmis￾sion. So far we have only mentioned capacitors, but inductors may be used to correct leading
power factors, for example, when feeding AC electricity into submarine cables possessing
high capacitance.
Our final topic in this introduction to AC electricity concerns three-phase systems. So far
we have dealt with a single sinusoidal voltage and the currents it produces in resistive and
reactive loads. But in practice AC grids normally generate and transmit a set of three separate
voltage phases (not to be confused with phase angles) displaced from one another by 120∘
(2𝜋/3 radians). A set of such voltages is shown in Figure 3.33. Domestic customers with
modest power requirements normally receive just one of the phases—a so-called single-phase
supply. Commercial and industrial consumers are more likely to receive all three phases.
Three-phase AC has a number of advantages:
■ Large three-phase generators, transformers, and motors are more efficient than
single-phase versions.
■ Three-phase is more economical to transmit than single-phase, using less conductor
material for the same power and voltage levels.
■ Power flow from a three-phase generator into a “balanced” linear load is constant (see
below), reducing vibrations in the generator and three-phase motors supplied by it.
■ Three-phase electricity can produce rotating magnetic fields of major importance in
the design of generators and motors.
Figure 3.34(a) shows a three-phase system comprising generator, transmission lines, and
load. The voltages for phases 1, 2, and 3 are produced by the generator’s internal coils,
or windings, which are arranged electrically as a “Y” or “star” and joined at the neutral

electric motor. In addition, low-power single-phase loads such as lighting may be supplied by
one line and the neutral cable and distributed equally between the three phases. Households
are normally supplied with one phase.
If the load is perfectly balanced with equal impedances in the three phases, the vector sum
of currents at the neutral point is zero. In this situation, the neutral conductor carries no
current—which explains why it is normally much thinner and lighter than the three-line
conductors. In practice, loads are unlikely to be perfectly balanced, so the neutral conductor
carries a small amount of current.
The voltages of the various phases, measured between line and neutral and denoted by VLN,
are out of step by 120∘—see Figure 3.33. The voltage VLL between any two lines equals the
vector sum of two-phase voltages, giving VLL =
√
3 VLN. The current in each line, IL, equals
the current in each phase, IPH .
An alternative arrangement, known as “Δ” or “delta,” is shown in part (b) of the figure.
Transmission now requires only three cables, and if the three impedances are equal the load
and line currents are again perfectly balanced. The line and phase voltages are now equal,
but the line current is √
3 times the phase current.
In a three-phase system, the total real and reactive power in the load may be expressed in
terms of the rms line voltages and currents as:

Some of the ideas and terminologies in this section may seem strange if you are new to AC
electricity; but they will be a great help for understanding the various types of generators
used in large modern wind turbines, and the engineering challenge of integrating them into
grid networks.
3.4.2 Generators

When Michael Faraday (1791–1867) discovered electromagnetic induction in 1832, he may
have had little inkling that, within a hundred years, the phenomenon would spawn a global

electricity industry. A man of limited formal education, Faraday was appointed professor
of chemistry at the Royal Institution in London in 1833 and is widely acknowledged as one
of the greatest experimentalists of all time. He was fascinated by the relationship between
electricity and magnetism and the possibility of making an electric motor. His theory of elec￾tromagnetic induction provided the essential insight; and today we realize that the fortuitous
combination of Faraday’s ideas, copper’s conductivity, and iron’s magnetism has formed the
basis of electric motors and generators ever since.
From the point of view of electricity generation, the core principle of electromagnetic induc￾tion may be simply stated: a voltage is produced, or induced, in a conductor moving at right
angles to a magnetic field. What matters is the relative movement—the conductor may be
stationary and the field moving, or vice versa.
Figure 3.35 shows how this principle can be used to make a simple AC generator. A mag￾net with north and south poles rotates between the arms of a soft iron frame. Two slots in
the frame carry an insulated copper wire in the form of a loop. The magnet forms the mov￾ing part—the rotor—and the frame and wire loop form the stationary part—the stator. As
the magnetic field (green arrows) moves past the conductor equal but opposite voltages are
induced in the two sides of the loop. Being in series, they add together and appear at the
terminals.
Half a revolution later, the north and south poles of the magnet have swapped positions, the
field has changed direction, and the induced voltages change sign. This is an AC device that
generates a fluctuating voltage—positive then negative—each time the magnet goes through
a complete revolution.
In electromagnetic induction, the magnetic field, the movement, and the induced voltage
are always at right angles, or orthogonal, to each other. Looking carefully at the rotational
system of Figure 3.35, we see that in this case the field is radial, the movement is tangential,
and the conductor is arranged in axial slots.

How much voltage is generated as a magnetic field “sweeps past” a conductor? This depends
on two factors: the strength of the field and the speed of movement—in other words, on the
rate of change of magnetic flux. The field may be maximized by keeping the reluctance of the
magnetic circuit as low as possible. In Figure 3.35, we have shown an iron frame that provides
an “easy,” low-reluctance path for the magnetic flux (apart from the small but necessary air
gap between the frame and magnet). But even a strong magnetic field is unlikely to produce
much voltage in a single conductor loop, so practical AC generators use coils with many
turns of wire, referred to as windings. The instantaneous induced voltage in a winding is
given by:
v (t) = −n (n𝛷∕dt) (3.30)
where n is the number of turns, 𝛷 is the magnetic flux measured in Webers, and d𝛷/dt rep￾resents its rate of change.
Although this simple machine demonstrates several key principles relevant to wind turbine
generators, it has its limitations. First, it is a single-phase device whereas large AC generators
are normally three-phase. Second, its voltage waveform is unlikely to match the sinusoidal
shapes shown in Figures 3.31 and 3.33. Although the magnet generates alternate positive
and negative voltages as it rotates past the conductor slots, these are more likely to resemble
“pulses” than a smoothly varying sine wave. In fact, the production of sinusoidal voltages
requires careful attention to the profile of the magnetic field and the layout of the copper
windings, part of the stock-in-trade of the design engineer. And finally, the magnetic field
of a large machine is normally produced by windings on the rotor, supplied with DC, which
acts as an electromagnet. This is referred to as separate excitation.
Figure 3.36 shows the main features of a high-power AC generator, this time producing three
phases. The windings are spread in slots around the stator’s circumference. For simplicity, we

have shown them well separated, but they actually overlap and the number of conductors in
each slot is carefully devised to produce sinusoidal voltage waveforms. As the rotor turns at
constant speed, the angular separation between the windings is translated into the required
timing separation between the three voltage waveforms, shown on the right-hand side of the
figure. One complete AC cycle is generated for each complete revolution. If the required fre￾quency is 50 Hz, the rotor must turn 50 times per second, or at 3000 rpm; if 60 Hz is required,
at 3600 rpm.
So far we have assumed that the rotor has a single pair of poles, and this is generally true
of large AC generators driven by steam turbines in conventional power plants. However,
generators for large wind turbines often have two-pole pairs, halving the rotational speed for
the same output frequency—for example, 1500 rpm produces 50 Hz—with a corresponding
reduction in the gearbox ratio. In principle there is nothing against even more pole pairs,
giving further speed reductions; indeed, there is an important type of multipole, low-speed,
wind turbine generator that dispenses with a gearbox altogether, allowing it to be directly
driven by the wind turbine. In general, the speed of rotation in rpm is given by:
n = 60 f ∕P giving P = 60 f ∕n (3.31)
where f is the frequency of the generated supply, and P is the number of pole pairs. For
example, a direct-drive machine required to generate 60 Hz at a rotation speed of 20 rpm
would need 60 × 60/20 = 180 pole pairs.
For reasons that will become clear shortly, the above machines are examples of synchronous
generators, and the speed of rotation is known as the synchronous speed. When a machine’s
field is produced by separate excitation, it is known as a wound-rotor synchronous genera￾tor (WRSG); and when the field is produced by permanent magnets, it is referred to as a
permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG).
There is a second major type of AC machine, of great importance in modern wind engineer￾ing, known as the asynchronous, or induction, generator. Most people find it more difficult
to understand than the synchronous generator, so it will be helpful to prepare the ground
for a fuller description in later sections.
We have already seen how a rotating magnet generates a set of sinusoidal voltages in a
three-phase stator winding. There is another side to the same coin: such a winding, if
energized by an external three-phase supply, produces its own rotating magnetic field.
For example, if we were to remove the rotor of the machine in Figure 3.36 and supply
three-phase 50-Hz AC to its windings from an external source, the windings would act as
electromagnets, producing a magnetic field rotating at 3000 rpm. Furthermore, it may be
shown that if the individual fields produced by the three phases are sinusoidal in both time
and spatial distribution, then their vector sum is constant in magnitude.3 In other words,
the field produced by a three-phase winding supplied with three-phase power is essentially
like that produced by a rotating magnet. Back in the 1880s, it was Tesla’s great insight
to realize that this phenomenon could be used to make a new type of AC motor—the
induction motor. During the 20th century, induction motors became the trusted workhorses
of industry as well as powering many domestic appliances including washing machines and
electric lawnmowers. And we shall see later that their first cousins, induction generators, are
widely used in wind turbines to produce grid electricity.
What is the essential distinction between synchronous and asynchronous (induction)
machines operating in a large electricity grid? A highly imaginative analogy based upon a

number of cyclists riding a “very long bike” has previously been described,5 and we will use
a modified and simplified version of it here.
Figure 3.37 shows cyclists on a very long bike that represents the electricity grid. Some
cyclists act as generators, supplying power to the grid. Others act as motors (loads), demand￾ing power from the grid. Each has pedals connected to a sprocket wheel that meshes with a
long chain running the whole length of the bike. The overall aim is to keep the bicycle mov￾ing along a straight flat road at constant speed, equivalent to maintaining the grid frequency
at its nominal value of 50 (or 60) Hz. Air resistance and rolling resistance are neglected.
The “generator” cyclists pedal actively, trying to push the bike forward, some with more
force than others. The “motor” cyclists apply braking force to the pedals, trying to slow
the bike down. If the bike speed is to remain constant the total forces produced by the two
groups must be kept in balance at all times. This is equivalent to a grid in which electricity
consumption must always be matched by generation.
As well as being a generator or motor, each cyclist is either synchronous or asynchronous,
depending on how his pedals are linked to the driving chain:
■ Synchronous. The pedals of a synchronous cyclist are connected to the sprocket wheel
by a stiff, but slightly elastic, shaft. If the cyclist is a generator, his effort twists the shaft
slightly forward by an amount proportional to the torque exerted. But if the cyclist is a
motor, the shaft is twisted slightly backward. As a result, the angular positions of the
various cyclists’ pedals are not aligned—for example, they do not all pass the lowest
point at the same instant. The pedals of a generator are always slightly in advance
of those of a motor. But, it is important to realize that synchronous cyclists must all
pedal at the same speed, dictated by the speed of the chain. In terms of our analogy,
synchronous generators and motors connected to an electricity grid must rotate at a
speed precisely determined by the grid frequency.
■ Asynchronous. The pedals of an asynchronous cyclist are connected to the sprocket
wheel by a fluid coupling. This consists of two small fan-like turbines facing each other
in a fluid-filled housing. One turbine is rigidly connected to the pedals, the other to the
sprocket wheel. The turbines are coupled together relatively “softly” by the viscosity
of the fluid, and as one rotates it tends to drag the other with it. A generator cyclist
transmits power by pushing the pedal turbine faster than the sprocket wheel turbine; a
motorcyclist does the opposite. Power transfer in either direction depends on a certain

amount ofspeed difference, orslip—no power is transmitted if the turbines are rotating
at the same speed. In terms of our analogy, an asynchronous generator must rotate
somewhat faster, and an asynchronous motor somewhat slower, than the equivalent
synchronous machine.
Let us now examine the cyclists in the figure more carefully. Suppose we are told that the
four blue ones are all synchronous, and that one of them is acting as a generator and three
as motors. Can we tell which is which? Indeed we can: cyclist 7 has his pedals slightly in
advance of the others, so he must be the generator.
We are also told that the four red cyclists are asynchronous, with two generators and two
motors. But this time we cannot tell which is which because a “snapshot” showing pedal
positions gives us no information about rotation speeds and the amount of slip—the essential
clue for distinguishing between generators and motors. We would need to know pedalspeeds,
not angular displacements.
The analogy offers further insights,5 especially into the question of reactive power balance.
As we saw in the previous section, a generator or grid must generally supply two types of
power: active power that delivers heat or mechanical work and reactive power that supplies
the out-of-phase AC currents demanded by inductive or capacitive loads. So far, our bicycle
analogy has focused entirely on the real power generated or demanded by the cyclists. But
the bicycle must also maintain balance and stability, not tipping over sideways and caus￾ing the cyclists to fall on the road. Forces trying to overturn the bicycle to the left may
be considered analogous to producers of reactive power, for example, capacitors used for
power-factor correction; forces acting to the right are analogous to consumers of reactive
power, for example, motor inductances. Note that the cyclists’ balancing act involves con￾stant adjustments of their weight to left or right but does not require them to generate (or
consume) real power. This is analogous to a grid network, where reactive power balance is
important for stability and maintaining the system voltage at the required level.
In the following sections, we describe the main variants of synchronous and asynchronous
generators used in large HAWTs. We will start with synchronous machines since they are in
many ways easier to understand and relate to Figures 3.35 and 3.36. We will then move on to
the asynchronous machines that dominated the early years of the wind energy renaissance
and, supported by recent developments in power electronics, find increasing application in
today’s high-power, variable-speed turbines.
3.4.2.2 Synchronous generators and gearless wind turbines
Most large conventional power plants produce electricity using synchronous generators
driven by steam or hydroelectric turbines. Two-pole machines coupled to high-speed
steam turbines are often referred to as turbo-alternators and are accepted as the trusted
workhorses of the electrical supply industry. In Europe, with its 50-Hz grids, they rotate at
3000 rpm; in North America, with 60-Hz grids, at 3600 rpm. We have already illustrated
their main features in Figure 3.36. Hydroelectric generators are generally designed as
multipole machines, allowing rotation at the much lower speeds of large water turbines. But
in all cases, the generator is effectively tied to the grid it serves by a “stiff magnetic spring,”
with no option but to rotate at synchronous speed. As its power output changes, the rotor
adopts a different angle, very much as the “synchronous cyclists’ described in the previous
section did with their pedals; but it cannot alter its rotation speed.

Another important feature should be mentioned. As we explained in the previous section,
an electricity grid has to supply reactive as well as real power. One of the advantages of
conventional synchronous generators is their ability to act as controlled sources of reactive
power by varying the strength of their rotor fields,3 allowing them to run at either lagging
or leading power factors. Such flexibility is a great asset for controlling and stabilizing a
large grid.
We may clarify the generation of real power by considering the interaction of magnetic fields.
As already noted, the field of a WRSG is produced by feeding DC excitation current into
the rotor’s field windings; a PMSG uses permanent magnets instead. In either case, the rotor
field rotates at synchronous speed and induces three-phase voltages in the stator windings
(see Figure 3.36).
So far we have only mentioned induced voltages, but of course voltage on its own is not
enough; the stator must also supply three-phase currents (and power) to the grid. This has an
extremely important consequence: the currents produce their own rotating field that inter￾acts with the field set up by the rotor. It is the “tension” between the two fields, rotating
synchronously but with an angular offset from one another, that produces torque and deliv￾ers real power to the grid. This is analogous to the stiff but slightly flexible shaft linking the
pedals of a “synchronous cyclist” to the chain of the bike shown in Figure 3.37.
Figure 3.38 illustrates the interaction of rotor and stator fields with a simple model. In this
case, fields are produced by permanent bar magnets, rotating together at synchronous speed
n, but offset from each other by an angle 𝛽. North and south poles attract, so the angular
offset produces a constant torque on the magnets that try (but fail) to align them. In part
(a), the torque on the rotor opposes its rotation, so the rotor must be supplying mechanical
power and the machine is acting as a generator. But in part (b), with the offset angle reversed,
the torque on the rotor aids its rotation, so the machine is acting as a motor. We see that
positive values of 𝛽 represent generation and negative values represent motoring—like most

electrical machines, a synchronous generator can also act as a motor. In either case, the rotor
and stator are tied together by a “magnetic spring.”
So what happens if a synchronous generator, coupled to a wind turbine via a suitable gear￾box, is connected directly to a large electricity grid? The first point to note is that it is not
self-starting; there has to be sufficient wind strength (or an auxiliary power source) to run
the turbine up to synchronous speed before connecting it. The instant of connection must be
finely judged, ensuring a suitable rotor angle as well as the correct speed. Thereafter, the wind
turbine must turn at a constant speed dictated by the grid frequency. With a strong enough
wind, it acts as a generator; but if the wind dies, the rotor tries to lag behind and starts to
accept power from the grid. Our wind turbine wants to become a very large fan—hardly
the desired effect, and certainly an expensive waste of grid electricity! Of course, it could be
automatically disconnected from the grid; but in light and variable winds, there would be
constant disconnection and reconnection, hardly the best way to treat a wind turbine.
There are two other major reasons why synchronous generators are unsuitable for connect￾ing wind turbines directly to a grid:
■ The connection is very “stiff.” The grid demands a fixed rotation speed, allowing only
small angular offsets of the generator’s rotor. This is fine for synchronous machines
driven by steam or water turbines, with power levels continuously under the control
of supervisory engineers. But a wind turbine driven by variable and gusty winds is a
very different proposition. Since the speed is fixed, any power fluctuations produced
by the turbine rotor translate directly into torque variations and power surges into the
grid. A stiff, inflexible connection places high stresses on mechanical components and
may induce vibrations. Even wind turbines equipped with variable-pitch blades may
be unable to react sufficiently fast to counteract such effects.
■ Large modern HAWTs are increasingly designed as variable-speed machines. This
allows the matching of rotation speed to wind speed, leading to enhanced efficiency
and higher annual electricity yields (as discussed in Section 3.2.3), but it cannot be
achieved with directly connected synchronous generators.
At this point, the prospects for synchronous generators in large HAWTs may seem distinctly
unpromising. But in this field of electrical engineering, as in many others, the situation has
been transformed in recent years by impressive developments in power electronics.
If a synchronous generator driven by a large wind turbine cannot be connected directly to
a large grid, perhaps it can be connected indirectly using a power-electronic interface. This
would make the generator independent of grid frequency, voltage, and phase. It may sound
like an expensive option for a megawatt-scale HAWT, but if the high cost of the electron￾ics can be offset by gains in turbine efficiency, and possibly also by omitting a heavy and
expensive gearbox, it can prove very attractive.
Figure 3.39 shows the main elements of such a scheme. A wind turbine (W) drives a syn￾chronous generator (SG) via a gearbox (GB). The gearbox is shown dotted to indicate that
it can be omitted if a multipole low-speed generator is used. The generator delivers power
to an electronic power converter (PC), also sometimes called a frequency converter, because
its key function is to decouple the rotation speed of the wind turbine from the frequency of
the grid. This is done by first converting the generator’s AC output to DC with a rectifier,
then converting it back to AC using an inverter. The DC link provides isolation between the
two unsynchronized AC systems, allowing the wind turbine to operate over a wide speed

range. It also makes the grid connection much “softer,” reducing sudden surges of torque
and electrical power as the wind speed fluctuates. Finally, the AC output from the inverter
is fed via a transformer (T) into the grid (G). The scheme is referred to as full-scale or fully
rated power conversion because the full power output of the generator passes through the
converter.
In addition to allowing generators to run at variable speeds, power converters can be
designed to produce or absorb reactive power, and to provide a “soft-start” for running the
turbine gently up to speed. In principle, the scheme of Figure 3.39 may also be used with
asynchronous generators because the power converter decouples the generated frequency
from that of the grid. However, as we shall see later, asynchronous generators are normally
used with partial-scale converters, which handle only a portion of the output power and are
considerably cheaper.
Rectifiers and inverters used in power converters are based on electronic switches such as
diodes, transistors, and thyristors. Half a century ago, the pioneers of solid-state electronics
could hardly have imagined that semiconductor devices would one day control megawatts of
power. But huge advances in power-handling capacity have been made since the 1980s, open￾ing electrical engineering up to a wide range of new ideas and possibilities. Wind engineering
is certainly one of the beneficiaries.
We see that synchronous generators allied to full-scale power converters have found a
valuable place in modern wind engineering. In principle, the decoupling of generator and
grid frequencies allows a turbine to work over a wide range of speeds, referred to as full
variable-speed operation; in practice, a range of about 3:1 is often chosen, sufficient to
optimize wind energy capture between cut-in and rated wind speeds.
Low-speed multipole generators driven directly by turbine rotors without any need for
gearboxes are of special interest. Figure 3.40 shows the nacelle of a gearless machine, its
three-bladed rotor coupled directly to a low-speed generator (colored red). This is often
referred to as an annular or ring generator because the stator and rotor windings are
arranged in the form of annular rings. The main advantages of this system are the elimina￾tion of a costly gearbox with its associated losses, and the simplicity of the mechanical drive
train, with a minimum number of bearings.
However, a directly coupled generator for a megawatt HAWT typically turns around
100 times slower than an equivalent four-pole machine driven via a gearbox. This means

that its torque is about 100 times greater. As we noted in Section 3.2.3, the torque developed
by a megawatt rotor can be equivalent to an Indian elephant standing at the end of a 100-m
lever! Very high-torque, low-speed, electrical machines are comparatively rare these days
and demand special design and construction skills—a point well illustrated by the stators
being fitted with three-phase windings in Figure 3.41. In general, the physical size and
losses of a low-speed generator depend more on torque than rated power, and efficiency
can be improved by designing with a large diameter. Although this increases the size of the
nacelle and makes transport more difficult, the overall simplicity and reliability of modern
direct-drive machines have secured a substantial proportion of the current market, with
clear signs that they will be increasingly favored for offshore wind farms.
In principle, the rotor fields of gearless synchronous generators can be produced by perma￾nent magnets rather than by separate excitation. Permanent magnets avoid the power losses
that occur when current is passed through copper windings, known as copper losses or i

losses, and can be made lighter and more compact. On the other hand, the strength of the
magnetic field is fixed, unlike that of a wound rotor which can be adjusted to control reactive
power and output voltage—flexibility that is admittedly less important when the generator
is connected to the grid via a power converter. These and other issues are well discussed
elsewhere.5, 6 Megawatt HAWTs using permanent magnets are currently in production and
seem likely to make a considerable impact in the coming decade.
3.4.2.3 Asynchronous generators
3.4.2.3.1 Squirrel-cage rotor and wound-rotor induction machines
Asynchronous generators connected to an electricity grid do not rotate at exactly syn￾chronous speed because the generation of real power requires a certain amount of slip.
Asynchronous operation is analogous to the action of a cyclist on a “very long bike” whose
pedals transmit power to the drive chain via a fluid coupling—a concept already discussed
and illustrated in Figure 3.37. Wind turbines coupled to asynchronous generators, also
referred to as induction generators, can cushion sudden power fluctuations by allowing their
rotors to speed up or slow down slightly, storing or releasing kinetic energy in the turbine
and drive train and “softening” the grid connection. Furthermore, as we shall see in the
next section, recent developments in power converters allow induction generators to operate

over a wide speed range. And finally, turbines with induction generators may be self-started
and run up to speed using their generators as motors.
In its basic form, an asynchronous (or induction) generator is cheaper and much simpler
in construction than a synchronous machine with the same power rating. Yet the details
of its operation are, by common consent, harder to visualize. Since most people are more
familiar with motors than generators, and since the two are intimately related, we will start
by explaining the action of an induction motor.
A three-phase induction motor has windings arranged around its stator in much the same
way as a synchronous machine and, when supplied with a three-phase AC supply, produces
a magnetic field that rotates at synchronous speed. It was Tesla’s genius in the late 1800s to
realize that the rotating field could be used to induce voltages in a simple form of rotor and
that the resulting currents would produce torque, tending to “drag” the rotor around with
the field. And so, the induction motor was born.
The simplest type of rotor is known as a squirrel-cage rotor, shown in its basic form in
Figure 3.42. Iron laminations are built up to form a solid core, with a set of axial slots filled
with cast aluminum bars that take the place of the more familiar (but more expensive) copper
conductors. In practice, there are generally many more bars than shown in the figure, and
they are skewed slightly to reduce torque fluctuations. The bars are short-circuited together
by two end rings that complete the “cage.” Squirrel-cage induction motors are produced in
vast quantities for applications ranging from industrial drives to domestic appliances and
have gained a reputation for robust reliability.
What happens when a stationary three-phase squirrel-cage motor is first connected to an AC
supply? We may visualize the following sequence of events:
■ A magnetic field, rotating at synchronous speed, is set up by the stator windings.
■ Three-phase voltages are induced in the rotor bars, and since they are short-circuited
by the end rings, currents flow. Initially, the rotor is stationary, the currents have the
same frequency as the supply, and the rotor produces its own magnetic field that also
rotates at synchronous speed.

■ Interaction between the stator and rotor fields produces torque, and the rotor starts to
turn. As it gathers speed, attempting to “catch up” with the stator field, the frequency
of the induced currents in the rotor bars decreases.
■ The rotor can never reach synchronous speed. If it did, there would be no induced
currents in the rotor bars, no torque, and the machine could not act as a motor deliv￾ering mechanical power. For torque and power to be produced, there must be a certain
amount of slip. This contrasts with a synchronous machine, which rotates at precisely
synchronous speed.
We see that the key to motor operation is the induction of rotor currents by the stator’s
magnetic field, which tries to “drag” the rotor with it. The slip is defined as:
s = (
ns − n
)
∕ns (3.32)
where n is the rotor speed and ns is the synchronous speed. Slip is generally quoted as a
percentage of the synchronous speed, with values between about 0.5% and 3% typical for
motors when delivering their rated power. Large high-power motors generally run at lower
slip values than small ones.
As an example, suppose a large three-phase two-pole induction motor connected to a 50-Hz
supply is running at 1% slip. Its rotation speed is 99% of synchronous speed, in other words,
0.99 × 3000 = 2970 rpm. Note that the rotor is “slipping back” through the stator field at
30 rpm, or 0.5 revolutions per second. It follows that the frequency of the induced rotor cur￾rents has fallen right down to 0.5 Hz and that the field they produce is rotating at just 30 rpm
relative to the rotor. But since the rotor is itself turning at 2970 rpm, the field is rotating at
3000 rpm relative to the stator. The same argument holds for any other value of slip; the sta￾tor field and induced rotor field both rotate synchronously, interacting to produce a steady
torque, even though the rotor body is moving at less than synchronous speed.
So how does an induction machine work as a generator? The answer is “rather easily.” As a
general principle, rotating electrical machines can act either as motors or generators. If they
accept electrical power and deliver torque, they are motoring; but if they accept torque and
produce electricity, they are generating. We should also note that, to a reasonable approxima￾tion, induction machines may be considered linear. An induction motor running just below
synchronous speed can be “pushed” up to and beyond synchronous speed by applying exter￾nal torque to its shaft. Above synchronous speed, the slip and torque simply change sign,
and the machine starts to generate. There is nothing to prevent a smooth transition from
motor to generator.
Figure 3.43 shows how the torque of a typical induction machine varies as it works up from
zero speed (start-up) toward synchronous speed as a motor and becomes a generator above
synchronous speed. Speed values are normalized to the synchronous speed ns. The motor
portion of the characteristic, shaded blue, is important for wind turbines that use their gen￾erators to provide motorized run-up, and we may identify several important points on the
curve:
■ Start-up. The torque and currents at zero speed tend to be large, well above the nominal
rating of the machine. Therefore, rather than connect the machine suddenly to the
supply, a controller known as a soft-starteris normally used to ensure a gentle start-up.
■ Pull-up. The pull-up, or minimum, torque must comfortably exceed the resisting torque
for the run-up to continue.

running as a motor with low values of slip. If exceeded, the motor stalls.
■ Nominal. The nominal torque is the value at which the machine is designed to operate
for long periods.
Following a motorized run-up and assuming the wind is sufficiently strong, a turbine can
start generating power. Torque and slip change sign, and the generator runs slightly above
synchronous speed. For example, if the slip is −2%, the normalized speed n/ns =1.02.
As wind strength varies, the torque fluctuates around its nominal value, producing small
changes in slip. Note that only a very small portion of the complete generator characteristic
is used during normal operation—indicated by dark green shading in the figure. The
machine generates within a narrow speed range—so much so that a turbine of this type is
often described, rather confusingly, as fixed speed.

rotor (for the moment, we will ignore the optional variable resistance (VR) connected to the
rotor). Three-phase stator windings feed electricity to the grid (G) via a transformer (T). A
soft-starter is included to aid motorized run-up. Power-factor correction is provided by a
capacitor bank (CB), a point that deserves some explanation.
One of the most important features of induction machines is that (not surprisingly) they are
highly inductive, requiring reactive power to build up and maintain their magnetic fields.
Whereas synchronous generators produce their own fields and have inherent flexibility for
controlling voltage and reactive power, an induction generator always runs at a lagging
power factor and must be supplied with reactive power by the grid, or by local capacitor
banks. From a circuit point of view, its stator and rotor possess both resistance and induc￾tance, and the interaction of the various elements as speed varies determines the shape of
the torque-speed characteristic.3 When we recall that inductive reactance is proportional to
frequency and that the frequency of induced rotor currents is proportional to the amount of
slip, it is not surprising that the characteristic shown in Figure 3.43 has a complicated form.
In any case, it is important to realize that the characteristic in Figure 3.43 is typical rather
than definitive; in particular, it can be modified by altering the amount of rotor resistance.
A squirrel-cage rotor, with its cast bars and end rings, has fixed resistance; but an alterna￾tive form of rotor uses copper windings instead of aluminum bars, producing a wound-rotor
induction generator (WRIG). The ends of the windings are brought out to slip rings on the
rotor shaft, and electrical contact is made by carbon brushes that bear upon the slip rings
(note that the word slip is here being used in a different sense). Although slip rings and
brushes make WRIGs less robust than simple squirrel-cage machines, a wound rotor intro￾duces some very important options—including the addition of VR to the rotor, shown by
the dotted lines in Figure 3.44.
Typical effects of adding external resistance are shown in Figure 3.45, which focuses on the
region close to the synchronous speed that is relevant to a machine working as a genera￾tor. The main effect is that the slip for a given output torque (and power) increases as the

rotor resistance increases. Starting with the variable resistance set to zero (red curve), the
rotor windings are effectively short-circuited, and the rotor behaves like a squirrel-cage rotor.
Adding resistance (orange and green curves) reduces the slope of the torque-speed charac￾teristic, increasing the operating speed range from, say, 1% to 5% of synchronous speed. A
given torque fluctuation produces a larger speed change. This allows sudden power surges to
be partially absorbed by changes in turbine speed, producing a “softer” grid connection and
reducing mechanical stresses on turbine components. It is sometimes referred to as high-slip
operation.
The addition of rotor resistance causes power losses, which would normally be considered
a disadvantage. However, in high winds when the wind turbine rotor is producing excess
shaft power, the introduction of rotor resistance allows the excess to be dissipated in the
rotor circuit, keeping the stator power within its rated value. This is a valuable alternative to
shedding power by pitching the blades, which may be too slow in gusty conditions.
A further option provided by a wound rotor is known as slip power recovery.
3 The power
losses incurred by adding rotor resistance reduce the generator’s overall conversion
efficiency—and the higher the slip, the greater the losses. It would be attractive if, instead of
dissipating power as unwanted heat, slip power could be “recovered” and put to good use.
Any AC power taken from the rotor is at a variable frequency and cannot be fed directly
into the grid. However, it can be rectified and then inverted by a power converter to make it
grid-compatible, adding to the flexibility of high-slip operation.
Twenty years ago, it was common practice to design large wind turbines with asynchronous
generators and fixed blades, giving robust and relatively inexpensive “fixed-speed” machines.
Unable to vary their speed by more than a few percent, or to pitch their blades to accom￾modate changes in wind speed, such machines were relatively inefficient at converting wind
power to electricity and relied on passive stalls to protect them from damage in storm con￾ditions. Today, the megawatt HAWT market has swung decisively toward variable-speed
machines and pitched blades—using either synchronous generators and full-scale power
converters, as described in the previous section, or, as we shall see in the following pages,
induction generators and partial-scale converters.
3.4.2.3.2 Doubly fed induction generators
In the previous section, we shifted attention gradually from the simplest form of an induc￾tion machine with its squirrel-cage rotor to WRIGs. In particular, we saw how the rotor of
a WRIG is not restricted to accepting mechanical power from the wind and delivering elec￾trical power to the stator via rotating magnetic fields. Electrical power may also be extracted
from the rotor via slip rings and brushes, modifying the torque-speed characteristics. We
now take this important idea a stage further by explaining how electrical power may also
be fed into the rotor, producing one of the most important recent advances in wind turbine
technology—the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG).
The DFIG concept has several key advantages:
■ It produces wind turbines that operate over typical speed ranges of about 2:1, or
slightly greater, sufficient to give high overall efficiency. This is sometimes referred
to as limited variable-speed operation, distinguishing it from the fuller variable-speed
operation of synchronous generators described in Section 3.4.2.2.
■ It incorporates a partial-scale power converter which is considerably cheaper and has
lower losses than a full-scale converter.

■ The power converter may be designed to include facilities such as soft-start, voltage
and torque control, and power-factor correction.
For all these reasons, DFIGs have been increasingly favored as the generators for megawatt
HAWTs in recent years, a trend that seems very likely to continue.
Figure 3.46 shows the main components of a DFIG scheme. The wind turbine and gearbox
drive the shaft of a WRIG. The generator’s stator is connected to the grid (G) via a trans￾former (T). In addition, its rotor can supply electrical power to, or receive power from, the
grid via a partial-scale PC. The term doubly fed refers to the fact that the stator and rotor can
both be supplied with AC voltages. In this arrangement, the power converter must clearly
be able to transfer power in either direction, in other words, it is bi-directional.
If you are familiar with conventional electrical generators, this probably seems a curious
system. A generator normally takes in mechanical power on the rotor and delivers electrical
power from the stator. The idea—even the possibility—of the rotor accepting and deliv￾ering electrical power seems strange to most people. So, we will start with a few general
observations.
The WRIG at the center of the scheme has two three-phase windings, one on the rotor
and one on the stator. In principle, both can generate rotating magnetic fields and transfer
power across the air gap. The machine’s characteristics depend on the relative speed dif￾ference between the rotor and stator—the amount of slip. It is even possible to imagine
clamping the rotor and allowing the stator to spin! All this points to an essential equiva￾lence between stator and rotor. A stator normally delivers real power, and accepts reactive
power, from the grid. But there is no reason in principle why the rotor should not also send
or receive electrical power, using brushes and slip rings on its shaft, even if it is turning and
receiving mechanical power from the outside world at the same time. This insight, and its
practical application, give extraordinary flexibility to the turbine designer, perhaps above all
for developing cost-efficient machines that match their speed to the wind.
So where does the wind power captured by the turbine actually go? The power balance in
Figure 3.47 illustrates the flow of real (but not reactive) power through the system,6 assum￾ing electrical power is being delivered to the grid by the rotor as well as the stator. On the

left-hand side, the input mechanical power to the rotor is denoted by Pm. The rotor deliv￾ers electrical power Per to the grid (via the power converter). There are small power losses
in the rotor, due mainly to resistance in its windings, and the residual input power is trans￾ferred across the air gap to the stator. There are also small stator losses, and the remainder
is delivered to the grid as stator electrical power Pes.
The alternative is for electrical power to be fed into the rotor by the power converter. The
arrow denoting rotor power now points the other way, but the power balance of the system
must still be maintained. For example, the extra power might be used to increase the torque
and/or speed of the turbine rotor, or it might be fed across the air gap to the stator.
But how can electrical power be fed into the rotor? In the previous section, we saw that
power can be taken out of a wound rotor via slip rings and brushes and dissipated as heat in
a variable resistance. That may seem fairly straightforward, but feeding power is harder to
visualize, especially since the frequency of voltages and currents in the rotor varies with the
amount of slip. But the situation may be summarized by saying that power can be “pushed
back” provided the power converter injects AC voltage into the rotor at the right frequency,
with appropriate amplitude and phase. This is certainly possible using today’s sophisticated
power electronics.
Reactive power can also be manipulated in various ways. As we pointed out previously, an
induction machine always runs with a lagging power factor and requires reactive power to
set up and maintain its magnetic field. This reactive power must come from somewhere—in
the case of a “fixed-speed” turbine, it is supplied from the grid or a local capacitor bank
(see Figure 3.44). But an added advantage of the DFIG concept is that the reactive power
required by the generator can be supplied from the power converter.
It is clear that DFIG systems depend crucially on their power converters—not only for the
ability to convert from AC to DC and back at high efficiency but also for the technical
sophistication of the algorithms and control circuits that allow real and reactive power to
be taken from or sent to the rotor. As Figure 3.46 indicates, this requires two bi-directional
AC/DC units (rectifier-inverters) together with a DC link (shown by red and blue lines) that
123

decouples the frequency of the rotor from that of the grid and allows the turbine to run at
variable-speed.
The AC/DC unit connected to the rotor is known as the rotor-side converter and that con￾nected to the transformer and grid is known as the network-side converter. They are con￾trolled independently of one another. Although there is considerable flexibility when allo￾cating roles to the two units, in many cases, the rotor-side converter provides torque control
and voltage or power-factor control for the DFIG; the network-side converter controls the
voltage of the DC link and transfers rotor power to and from the AC system at unity power
factor.
The DFIG concept offers a comprehensive range of control options, but understanding the
details requires expertise in electrical machines and circuit theory beyond the scope of this
book. Fortunately, good accounts may be found elsewhere.5, 6 In the rest of this section, we
focus on some operational aspects of DFIGs, as they affect the wind turbines that drive them.
As already noted, probably the most valuable attribute of the DFIG is its variable speed.
Back in Section 3.2.3 and Figure 3.15, we explained that a rotor speed range of about 2:1 is
sufficient to give good turbine efficiency over a wide range of wind speeds. This is less than
the 3:1 range typical of synchronous generators used with full-scale power converters, but
it is considerably cheaper. It turns out that a DFIG can produce a 2:1 speed variation with
a converter rated at about 30% of the maximum power produced by the wind turbine. For
example, a HAWT rated at 3 MW needs a partial-scale power converter rated at about 1 MW.
Not only is this a lot cheaper than a full-scale converter to handle 3 MW, but it also saves
power losses in the converter itself.
The speed variation is obtained partly by operating the DFIG super-synchronously, in other
words above synchronous speed, as with the “fixed-speed” squirrel-cage and wound-rotor
machines described in the previous section and partly by operating it sub-synchronously, or
below synchronous speed. Sub-synchronous power generation may seem surprising because
we have previously assumed that an induction machine acts as a motor below synchronous
speed (with positive slip) and as a generator above synchronous speed (with negative slip).
But in fact, a DFIG can operate as a generator both sub- and super-synchronously. Basically,
this is because electrical power may be fed into, as well as out of, the rotor. In either case,
the stator feeds energy into the grid.
The situation is summarized in part (a) of Figure 3.48. At the top, real electrical power
Per is taken out of the rotor, which runs above synchronous speed (n >ns). But electrical
power may also be supplied to the rotor, which then runs at less than synchronous speed
(n <ns). The desired speed ratio of around 2:1 is achieved by a seamless transition from sub￾to super-synchronous operation. Typically, the speed can be made to vary between 60% and
130% of synchronous speed using a partial-scale power converter that can handle about a
third of the full-rated power of the wind generator. This corresponds to a range of slip values
between 40 and −30%, far greater than with conventional induction generators.
Part (b) of the figure shows how the torque-speed characteristic of a typical induction
machine begins to change as real power is fed into or out of the rotor. In a DFIG system,
this is achieved by injecting a voltage with suitable frequency and phase from the rotor-side
converter. As in Figure 3.43, positive torque corresponds to motoring, negative torque to
generation. The red curve shows the characteristic of the basic machine, which changes
from motoring to generation as the speed passes through synchronous speed (n/ns =1.0).
The yellow curve shows what happens with negative voltage injection; the machine only

starts to generate at super-synchronous speeds. Conversely, with positive voltage injection,
indicated by the orange curve, generation starts at sub-synchronous speeds. The solid
portion of each curve between the two colored dots indicates the region for real power
generation. If reactive power is required, the rotor-side converter must again inject voltage
at the correct frequency, but with a 90∘ phase shift.6
The above discussion may imply that the DFIG and power converter are operating fairly
steadily, adjusting from time to time to accommodate changes in average wind speed. But
in practice, they operate in a highly dynamic environment, adapting to sudden gusts and
working with the systems that control pitching of the blades. The fast response of electronic
circuits compared with mechanical blade pitching is yet another important advantage of the
DFIG concept, smoothing power flow into the grid and protecting the turbine and its drive
train from excessive stresses in gusty or extreme conditions.
3.5 Turbine control
Effective control of large wind turbines poses big challenges, perhaps above all because their
rotors face an unruly power source—what we have previously called “wild wind.” Typically,
a large HAWT generates electricity over a 6:1 range in average wind speed, equivalent to a
power range of more than 200:1. It must cut in and cut out appropriately and survive sudden
gusts. Control functions include
■ Optimization of wind capture by the turbine rotor and efficient conversion into elec￾trical energy.
■ Protection from mechanical and electrical overloads.
■ Supervision and sequencing of turbine operations.
■ Monitoring performance and health of system components.
■ Interfacing with other turbines in a wind farm and supplying electricity in a form
acceptable to the grid operator.

Some of these objectives require engineering solutions based on subtle combinations of aero￾dynamic, electrical, and electronic control. Others are essentially supervisory. The whole
package must be integrated into a reliable working system; and since large turbines are
expected to operate for long periods without detailed human supervision, this demands
sophisticated computer control.
It is worth recalling the three main types of configurations used in today’s megawatt HAWTs:
■ Fixed speed using an induction generator connected to the grid (see Figure 3.44).
In many older designs, the blades were bolted to the hub, giving simple and robust
machines protected from damage by passive stalls. More recent designs incorporate
pitched blades, valuable during start-up, and for controlling power by active stall.
However, the minimal speed variation of these machines limits overall aerodynamic
efficiency.
■ Variable speed based upon a DFIG and partial-scale power converter. This configura￾tion (see Figure 3.46) has become very popular for megawatt HAWTs in recent years,
offering turbine speed ranges of about 2:1, or slightly greater. Active control of pitched
blades is used to limit power production above rated wind speed and offers a full com￾plement of safety features.
■ Variable speed using a synchronous generator and full-scale power converter. This config￾uration (see Figure 3.39) is the other principal contender for today’s high-performance
machines. Speed ranges up to about 3:1 are typical. Generators incorporate either
wound or permanent-magnet rotors and many are low-speed machines that dispense
with the need for gearboxes. These turbines also make extensive use of blade pitching
for control and protection.
Modern variable-speed turbines, whether based on induction or synchronous generators,
achieve impressive technical performance by careful control of two parameters: rotor speed
and blade pitch. We may use the power curve for a 2-MW turbine shown in Figure 3.50 (see
also Figure 2.2) to describe a typical control strategy when operating between cut-in and
cut-out wind speeds (Figure 3.49):
■ Region A-B. In this region, from just above cut-in to just below rated power, the tur￾bine’s available speed range is used to keep the tip speed ratio close to optimum as
wind speed varies, with the aim of maximizing the power coefficient (see Figure 3.15).
In the example shown, the wind speed range is about 7 to 13 m/s, implying a turbine
speed range of around 2:1. Efficient speed control at low to moderate wind speeds is
crucial to the turbine’s overall performance (note that below point A there is very little
power in the wind; above point B there is a power surplus).
■ Region B-C. The turbine is approaching its maximum speed, and control changes
toward a constant-speed mode while allowing the power (and therefore torque) to
fluctuate. However, a careful watch is kept on rotor torque, which must be held below
its rated value to prevent excessive stress on the drive train, gearbox (if fitted), and
generator.
■ Region C-D. There is excess power in the wind, but the generator’s rated power (2 MW
in this case) must not be exceeded, so the control system changes to a constant-power
mode. This is the region where active blade pitch control is essential. As wind speed
increases, the blades are pitched to shed more and more power, either by increasing

the angle of attack (active stall) or by pitching them in the other direction (feathering).
The working turbine is at full stretch in this region and increasingly reliant on blade
pitching for control and protection as it approaches cut-out.
As wind strength varies, there are often transitions between the three regions, and the aim of
a well-designed control system is to enable smooth changes while ensuring that the turbine’s
rated power, speed, and torque are not exceeded.
Figure 3.50 focuses on speed and power, but torque is also very important. To understand
how torque control is achieved, we need to consider the relationship between generator

speed, torque, voltage, and current. As a rule, the voltage produced by an electrical generator
is proportional to speed, and current is proportional to torque. Now the mechanical power Pm
driving a generator is proportional to both speed and torque (see Equation (3.11)), and the
real electrical power Pe it produces is given by the product of voltage and in-phase current.
So if we assume negligible losses in the machine itself, the mechanical input power equals
the electrical output power, and to a reasonable approximation:
Pm = 2𝜋NT = Pe = VI watts (3.33)
where N, T, V, and I are the speed, torque, voltage, and in-phase current, respectively.
Equation (3.33) suggests that rotor speed and torque may in principle be managed either
mechanically or electrically. For example, rotor torque can be modified either by direct
adjustments of blade pitch or by controlling the generated current. More generally, the
mechanical operation of a turbine can be monitored and controlled from the generator end
of the drive train—an important option widely used in control schemes for variable-speed
megawatt HAWTs.
Although we have already used the word “control” many times, we have not so far com￾mented on its fundamental principles. In the case of large wind turbines, it is clear that a
wide range of control actions is needed—not only during normal operation but also for
start-up and shut-down, in emergencies, for ensuring the safety of equipment and person￾nel, and so on. Most of these actions are allocated to individual subsystems under overall
supervisory control. The basic concept involved is one that permeates the whole of classical
control theory—that of feedback.
Figure 3.51 illustrates the use of feedback in a simple control loop that is designed to ensure
an “actual output” matches a “desired output” with acceptable accuracy. By “output” it
means the value of a variable that we wish to control—it might be a voltage, current, torque,
speed, angle, or temperature. A signal representing the actual output is fed back and sub￾tracted from the desired value to produce an error signal. Clearly, if the actual and desired
outputs are identical, the error is zero and no control action is needed. However, a nonzero
error activates the forward path comprising the controller, power amplifier, and actuator to
bring the actual output into line. It is often said that, in such a control loop, the error drives
the system. And since the actual value is subtracted from the desired value to calculate the
error, the feedback is described as negative. Negative feedback may be viewed as the guiding
principle of automatic control.

Large wind turbines incorporate many subsystems of this type, controlling parameters
such as:
■ Rotor speed and torque
■ Blade angle of attack
■ Yaw rate and position
■ Electrical output
The box labeled controller in the figure is normally electrical or electronic (typically a
microprocessor or computer). Depending on the particular application, the power amplifier
that increases the power level to that needed by the actuator may be electrical/electronic or
hydraulic and the actuator may be electrical (motor, switch, etc.) or hydraulic. For example,
the actuators that provide pitch control by rotating turbine blades about their longitudinal
axes are electric motors or hydraulic pistons, with pitch angle as the control variable.
An extremely important advantage of negative feedback is that it makes the subsystem more
or less impervious to external disturbances. Again, taking blade pitch control as an example,
gusty wind conditions subject the blades to unwanted external forces that tend to alter their
pitch setting—the “actual output” in Figure 3.51. This information is fed back and produces
an error signal that restores the blade pitch to the desired value.
However, a word of caution is in order. The simplicity of Figure 3.51 may imply that match￾ing “actual” and “desired” outputs is a straightforward matter: give an order, and it is imme￾diately obeyed! But things are not that easy, mainly because the units in the forward path
(controller, power amplifier, and actuator) are all limited by their own dynamic responses. In
a nutshell, they cannot respond immediately to requests for control action, and if the power
amplifier is turned up in an attempt to accelerate the response, there may be an overshoot or
even oscillation. Such effects are beyond the scope of this book, but it is important to realize
that they are central to control system design.
When the control subsystems of a large turbine have been carefully designed and tested, they
must all be brought together to create an efficient, safe, and reliable working system. Control
is at several levels and is essentially hierarchical.
In Figure 3.52, we assume that a large HAWT forms part of a wind farm that integrates
and manages the electrical outputs from all its turbines and delivers power to the grid. The
wind farm controller is at the top of the command chain, responsible for management issues
affecting the farm as a whole (we shall have more to say about this in the next section).

Next in the chain comes supervisory control of the individual turbine, typically sequencing
start-up, shut-down, and emergency procedures, and overseeing operation during electricity
generation. And finally, we have the turbine subsystem controllers, often based on the type of
negative feedback loop shown in Figure 3.51, that control settings of individual parameters
such as turbine speed and blade pitch. The picture is necessarily simplified, showing only
a proportion of the turbine’s control requirements, but it does underline the hierarchical
nature of a highly sophisticated control structure.
The orange arrows in the figure suggest a one-way flow of command and control from wind
farm to individual wind turbine. But as we have already seen, feedback is an essential aspect
of effective control, allowing actual outputs to be compared with desired ones and taking
remedial action when necessary. In fact, there is extensive feedback within the various “box￾es” in the figure, and from turbine back to the wind farm, which we have not attempted to
show in the figure. Supervisors need to know that orders issued have actually been carried
out and that the system is working according to plan.
3.6 Onshore wind farms
3.6.1 Introductory
Large wind turbines are generally placed in groups to form wind farms, also known as
wind parks. These may contain anything from two or three individual machines to more
than a hundred machines producing hundreds of megawatts. Gigawatt onshore wind farms
are firmly in prospect for the coming decade, especially in countries with large, remote,
windswept areas of limited landscape value.
The development of wind farms got underway in California in the late 1970s, notably in the
Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Mountains. By the 1990s, many wind
farms were being installed in Europe, especially in Denmark, Germany, and Spain, and since
2000 there has been a worldwide explosion in capacity (see Section 1.5) that shows no signs of
abating. The ratings of individual turbines have grown systematically over the years, initially
from tens to hundreds of kilowatts and then on toward the megawatt machines that dominate
today’s utility-scale market.
The benefits of scale ensure that large wind farms based on megawatt HAWTs are very attrac￾tive to developers and electric utilities. Many of the largest operational wind farms are in the
USA, with installed capacities in the range of 300–700 MW. The difficulty, of course, is to find
sites extensive enough to accommodate large numbers of turbines, taking account of public
acceptability as well as physical and geographical limitations. Densely populated European
countries such as Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands that have already invested heav￾ily in onshore wind have increasing difficulty locating new sites—one of the main reasons for
the current surge of interest in offshore wind farms, which we cover in the next chapter. But
other countries with extensive, sparsely populated, flat plains or uplands have a long way to
go before exhausting their onshore potential.
A prime example of a region that is already heavily committed to wind energy is provided
by northwest Germany. Figure 3.53 shows wind farm locations in the neighborhoods
of Hamburg and Bremen up to the North Sea coast. Most of this countryside is flat
and windswept—part of the North German Plain—and has proved a magnet for wind
farm developers over the past 20 years. Older installations are generally small by today’s

standards, typically comprising a few machines rated at well under 1 MW; but there are also
plenty of new wind farms based on the current generation of megawatt HAWTs. Germany
has been, and still is, admirably active in wind power, with one of the highest total installed
capacities in the world, plus one of the highest per head of population (see Figure 1.19).
However, it is easy to appreciate that turbine installation on this scale may be approaching
saturation in terms of suitable sites, public acceptability, and the challenge of integrating
large amounts of renewable electricity into local grid networks.
Canada is a good example of a different scenario: a vast country with low overall population
density where the penetration of wind energy is currently far lower than in many European
countries, offering great scope for future development. Many other nations enjoy high wind
resources that are so far largely untapped. However, it is important to bear in mind that
the proximity of wind farms to grid networks and centers of population has an important
influence on wind energy economics (Figure 3.54).
From a technical point of view, the biggest challenge for wind farm developers is to find
accessible sites with high average wind speeds, preferably located reasonably close to existing

grid networks. Potential sites must also be assessed for environmental and social impact, and
legal issues such as land ownership, permissions, and access to power lines cleared. Once a
site has been selected the exact number and locations of the wind turbines must be carefully
planned, with the aim of maximizing annual energy yield and reducing, as far as possible,
the costs of access and installation.
When all permissions are in place, it is time to prepare the site for turbine installation. Typ￾ically this involves
■ Building or upgrading access roads (which may be time-consuming and costly, espe￾cially in rugged terrain).
■ Constructing turbine foundations (which tend to be very site-specific, depending on
subsoil, bedrock, etc.).
■ Installing power and data transmission cables to interconnect the various turbines and
control center, plus any transformers and switchgear necessary for grid connection.
The erection of megawatt HAWTs demands special skills and large cranes that have their
own transportation problems. Blades must be maneuvered with great care, preferably in calm
weather to avoid damage and the risk of danger to personnel. It is always a great relief for
installation engineers to see their charges safely “up and running” (Figure 3.55).
3.6.2 Siting and spacing
We have already discussed wind resources in Chapter 2, including the use of wind atlases
and specialized software to predict the wind regime in a local area, preferably supplemented
by careful measurement of wind speeds at candidate wind farm sites—especially those with
complex geography or obstructions. It is now time to consider the siting of individual tur￾bines, referred to as micro siting, which forms a key part of the planning process for a
successful wind farm. Effective placing of turbines in relation to neighboring machines, pre￾vailing winds, and variations in the local terrain is essential to optimize energy production.
Things are fairly straightforward when a wind farm is to be built on an extensive flat site, well
clear of significant obstructions in all directions. Needless to say, such sites are comparatively
rare, but good examples may be found on the Great Plains of North America, the North
German Plain, some coastal sites, and arid desert-like regions of the world. In such cases,
wind farm designers are untroubled by variations in local terrain and can site and space an

array of machines in an optimum configuration, provided there are no serious subsoil or
rock problems to complicate turbine foundations.
As we have seen in Section 3.2.1, the basic task of a wind turbine rotor is to extract as
much kinetic energy from the moving airstream as possible. In doing so, it creates a wake
and produces turbulence that can adversely affect the performance of neighboring machines.
Repeated over a wind farm as a whole, such effects give rise to array lossesthat reduce annual
energy production. So, the question arises: how far should turbines be spaced apart? Clearly,
generous spacing helps minimize array losses, but it also restricts the number of turbines that
can be fitted on a given area of land and increases the costs of access roads and cabling. A
compromise is needed.
Figure 3.56 shows a regular array of turbines on an extensive flat site in relation to the pre￾vailing wind direction. There are two spacings to be considered: downwind and crosswind.
Generous downwind spacing minimizes interference by a turbine’s wake on its downstream
neighbors and, although there are no hard and fast rules, a value between 8 and 10 rotor
diameters is often recommended to limit total array losses to below 10%. If we take a 2-MW
HAWT with a rotor diameter of around 90 m as typical of large, modern onshore wind farms,
this implies a downwind spacing of around 800 m.
The need for crosswind spacing is less clear. On the face of it, a spacing of just over one rotor
diameter might seem enough to avoid expensive arguments between adjacent machines!
However, the situation is complicated because most sites do not have a single, dominant,
prevailing wind direction; turbines use their yaw motors to face different wind directions
at different times of day and in different seasons of the year. Clearly, a 90∘ change of wind
direction converts crosswind into downwind, and downwind into crosswind. In practice, a
spacing of about five rotor diameters is often chosen for the nominal crosswind direction

which combined with a downwind spacing of 800 m implies a land area of about 0.4 km2 per
2-MW turbine. However, the actual value depends on turbine size and the wind regime at a
particular site.
A useful aid to visualizing variations in wind direction is the wind rose. The example in
Figure 3.57 summarizes 10 years of measurements at a site near Plymouth in the southwest
of England that is exposed to prevailing winds from the Atlantic Ocean. The length of each
colored bar indicates the relative amount of time that the wind blows within a certain speed
range in a particular direction. It is clear that, in this case, the wind is most likely to blow
strongly from the southwest, regarded as the prevailing direction. But winds from the north￾west and east, although normally gentler, are also quite common during winter and spring
months. In such cases, we cannot define “downwind” and “crosswind” precisely, and sensible
judgments must be made about turbine spacing. Some locations, for example, the San Gor￾gonio Pass in California, have predominantly unidirectional wind roses; others, including

the northwest coast of Spain, tend to be bi-directional (e.g. northeast and southwest). In
these cases, high annual energy yields may be obtained by increasing downwind spacing and
reducing crosswind spacing.
Array losses depend to a considerable extent on the wind rose pattern. If predominantly
unidirectional or bi-directional, the wind spends most of its time blowing in line with the
nominal downwind direction and a generous downwind spacing is desirable. But if the wind
rose is well spread, crosswind spacing is also important. Another important factor is the
amount of turbulence in the air stream. The energy loss behind a turbine, represented by
its wake, is replenished over a certain distance by the exchange of kinetic energy with the
surrounding wind field. The exchange is more rapid and effective when the wind field is
turbulent, leading to smaller array losses in downstream turbines. Such effects have been
extensively studied in practice and by computer modeling.3
The power curve of a wind farm—its power production as a function of wind speed—has
a different shape from that of an individual turbine (see, for example, Figure 3.50). This is
because array losses and turbulence affect turbines according to their position in the array.
As the wind speed approaching a wind farm increases from zero, the first row of turbines
starts operating, followed by those further downwind. At any given wind speed, downwind
machines tend to produce less power than upwind ones, and the wind speed must exceed the
rated value by some margin before all turbines reach their rated power. Furthermore, turbu￾lence in the wind causes the power output from turbines in different parts of the wind farm
to fluctuate differently, and some turbines may be temporarily out of service. The effect of
all this is to modify the farm’s power production, which is generally lower than that expected
from multiple isolated turbines.
It is important to note that turbine spacing is not solely concerned with energy production.
Tight spacing in the downwind direction means that turbines are more affected by turbulence
caused by upstream neighbors. This may produce unacceptably large mechanical stresses on
blades and rotors, eventually producing fatigue and affecting the warranties given by tur￾bine manufacturers. Similarly, tight spacing in the nominal crosswind direction can produce
unacceptable stresses if the wind blows for substantial periods in “nonprevailing” directions,
and it may be necessary to shut down certain turbines to avoid damage.
So far, we have assumed an extensive flat site without significant obstructions to wind flow,
with turbines arranged in a regular array. But, of course, things are rarely so simple. You may
like to refer back to photographs showing a variety of sites with features and irregularities
that require careful, individual, micro siting:

In the last two examples, array losses and turbulence effects are small when the wind direction
is perpendicular to the line of turbines but may become serious if it changes substantially.
Such locations would normally have substantially unidirectional or bi-directional wind roses.
Further discussion on wind turbine spacing is included in Chapter 5.
The technical objectives of turbine siting include maximizing annual energy production,
avoiding excessive turbulence, and minimizing installation costs. But there are also impor￾tant environmental and social considerations. From the point of view of the general public,
especially those living close to wind farms, visual intrusion and turbine noise are generally
of most concern. We shall discuss these and related topics in Chapter 8.
3.6.3 Monitoring and control
Wind farm operators need to monitor the performance of individual turbines, and of the
wind farm as a whole, from a central location and take corrective action if necessary. They
must also check that the electricity supplied to the grid meets contractual agreements. The
computer system that acts as a “nerve center” for this complex task is generally referred to as
a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. It may be supplied by the turbine
manufacturer, or alternatively by an independent company whose software is designed to
work with a variety of turbine types and sizes within the same wind farm.
SCADA systems display appropriate monitoring and control data on computer screens. A
typical view showing the layout and operating status of a wind farm is shown in Figure 3.59.
In this example, the farm comprises a total of 18 turbines arranged in three groups along
low hill ridges. The power output from each group is metered before entering a substation
where the grid connection is made. Meteorological masts support anemometers and wind

control center from where orders are issued to control the overall operation of the farm. The
display indicates the operational status of each turbine, and selecting an individual machine
(e.g. A2) reveals its power output and speed of rotation.
The SCADA system of a large modern wind farm allows operators to select various screens,
giving a comprehensive range of incoming data, such as:
■ Each turbine’s operational status, plus parameters such as wind speed, blade pitch
angle, and gearbox oil temperature.
■ Power output from each turbine, or turbine group.
■ Atmospheric temperature, pressure, and air density.
■ Real and reactive power delivered to the grid, wind farm capacity factor, and estimates
of revenue based on energy production and utility tariffs.
■ Grid voltage and frequency at the substation.
The incoming information is used to initiate supervisory and control actions that may
include
■ Monitoring turbines for safe operation and choosing optimal operating states.
■ Start-up and shut-down of individual turbines, or groups of turbines, including emer￾gency shut-down and grid disconnection.
■ Fault diagnosis, repair, and maintenance.
■ Keeping records of turbine and wind farm performance.

In our discussion of turbine control in Section 3.5, we noted that a large modern
HAWT incorporates many subsystems devoted to controlling individual aspects of
performance—rotor speed, generator torque, blade pitch angle, and so on—and is in many
respects a self-regulating machine. The SCADA system moves the overall control function
forward by integrating all turbines on a wind farm into a safe and efficient production unit.

Problems
3.1 The blades of a wind turbine are ready to be added on a turbine mast on the ground
with 12-degree slope when a storm front arrives. The turbine crew huddles in their
truck as the rain starts and the wind picks up, and the engineer drives his truck
upwind of the blades to disrupt the airflow around the blades, in an attempt to prevent
them from being lifted by the wind and damaged.
The blades are 4.6 m (15 feet) long, 0.61 m (2 feet) wide, and have a mass of 45.36 kg.
As the front arrives, the temperature drops to 15.6∘C (60∘F). Assume that the blades
are approximately symmetric airfoils, and that the center of both the lift and the drag
force is on the center of mass of the blade, and that the leading edge is facing the
direction of the wind. Assume the air density is 1.25 kg/m3 and that the lift coefficient
of a symmetric airfoil is approximately: Cl = 2𝜋 sin𝛼).

following operating conditions and geometric data, determine the relative wind
velocities, the lift and drag forces, and the tangential and normal forces developed
by the blade section at the two different tip speed ratios. Also, determine the relative

Answers to questions
Q3.1 Lift and drag.
Q3.2 It creates a strong horizontal lift force.
Q3.3 It can protect the wind turbine from damage in extreme wind gust conditions.
Q3.4 The pitch system regulates the power output of the wind turbine by adjusting the
angle of rotor blades according to wind velocity; it also functions as the main brake.
Q3.5 You would expect that more blades would offer a higher harvesting of the wind’s
kinetic energy as long as the movement of one does not create low-pressure areas
around the other. However, blades are expensive, and it was found that 3-blade
turbines offer a good combination of cost, technical performance and long-term
reliability. Old windmills have four sails but increasing the number of blades from
3 to 4 in modern WT is not cost-effective. Esthetics play a role too; a 3-blade WT
looks nice.
Q3.6 About 50% the theoretical limit is 59% (Betz Limit).
Q3.7 The higher the rotor diameter, the higher the swept area and the rated power.
Q3.8 At a wind speed of 12 m/s.

Q3.9 HAWT can employ bigger rotor diameters and are easier to adjust to changes in
wind speed and direction.
Q3.10 They are low-speed but high-torque machines, and they can produce high speeds

Q3.12 To induce lift as the air velocity on the curved side is higher and the pressure is

Q3.13 Surface roughness can reduce air velocity and lift.

4 Fundamentals of offshore system
4.1 Introduction
The world’s first offshore wind farm was a modest affair by today’s standards. Located in
shallow water just off the coast of Denmark, the Vindeby farm started in 1992 with eleven
turbines and an installed capacity of 5 MW. Since then, Denmark has been joined by other
countries with North Sea coastlines—the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium—in
pioneering the development of utility-scale offshore wind farms. China made significant
progress in the last decade. Many other nations around the globe including the USA, Taiwan
and Japan, are now planning to “move offshore,” (Figures 4.1 and 4.2) presenting their wind
energy industries with challenging new horizons.
Why this sudden surge of interest in generating renewable electricity offshore? And why have
the countries of northwest Europe been leading the way, especially in the North Sea? We may
identify a number of contributing factors:
■ In recent years, European countries with high population densities have found it
increasingly hard to locate new sites for onshore wind farms, especially very large
ones that benefit from the economies of scale.
■ Developments in wind turbine technology are constantly increasing the power ratings,
rotor sizes, and efficiency of the largest turbines. The Vindeby machines mentioned
earlier were each rated at 450 kW. Today, 2–6 MW turbines are commonplace, and
new 10 MW and greater capacity turbines are installed. Very large HAWTs with rotor
diameters over 100 m are well suited to offshore duty where there is plenty of space
and visual intrusion is less problematic.
■ Although offshore turbines are comparatively costly to install and maintain, wind
resources are superior to those onshore, with higher average wind speeds and lower
turbulence.

■ As far as the North Sea is concerned, several countries that have amassed vast experi￾ence in wind energy—Denmark and Germany in particular—have a dwindling supply
of land suitable for large onshore turbines. The UK, especially in Scotland, has huge
offshore engineering experience thanks to North Sea oil (which is now running out),
leaving a reservoir of skilled personnel keen to transfer to the wind engineering sector.
And the extra costs and difficulties of offshore installation are manageable in the North
Sea, which is shallow in many places.
Add to all this, the enthusiasm of governments to encourage wind energy and the undoubted
problems of working offshore are increasingly seen as challenges rather than limitations.
Figure 4.3 shows the locations of operating, approved, and planned offshore wind farms
in northwest Europe, including the all-important North Sea. Most sites are quite close to
shore. Given the rapidly developing situation, it is inevitable that such a snapshot will date
fairly quickly. Some planned farms may not materialize (and others are too closely spaced
to be shown individually on a map of this scale). But the figure gives a useful overview, con￾firming that Europe’s operating wind farms are soon to be joined by many more, especially
in England (E), Denmark (D), and Germany (G); followed, a few years later, by a further set
that are firmly planned, including many in Scotland (S) and along the northern and western
coasts of France (F).

Figure 4.4 Cumulative offshore wind turbine installations per country.
How about moving further offshore? If we refer back to Figure 2.19 illustrating the North
Sea’s wind resources, it is clear that average wind speeds—the basic technical criterion for
selecting wind farm sites—increase markedly with distance from the coastline. And visual
intrusion becomes less problematic. However, there are two offsetting disadvantages. The
water is generally deeper far from shore, making turbine installation more costly and dif￾ficult, and it is more expensive to bring the generated electricity ashore by undersea cable.
We will revisit these topics in later sections. Not only are offshore wind farms increasing
rapidly in number, but so are their average installed capacities. Figure 4.4 shows the cumula￾tive capacity from 19 countries. Recently commissioned offshore wind farms are often based
on turbines rated between 6 and 16 MW. We can design a wind farm generating 1 GW with
65–170 turbines. And it is reasonably certain that Europe will be generating tens of gigawatts
of offshore electricity by 2025.
There is a remarkable contrast between the average installed capacity of onshore and off￾shore installations. This is surely where the true significance of offshore wind lies: very large
utility-scale installations based on multi-megawatt HAWTs. It promises to revolutionize
many aspects of the wind energy industry in the coming decade.
4.2 Offshore wind power fundamentals
As discussed in the Introduction section, offshore wind power is among the established scal￾able renewable energy technologies. They are relatively easy to construct due to the sea routes
and vessels available to transport parts from manufacturing sites to turbine locations. There
are other advantages for going offshore:
(1) The first and foremost advantage of offshore wind power is that the average wind
speed in the sea is generally higher and more consistent than onshore, which means
that the offshore wind turbines will be able to work more efficiently than the onshore

ones. Also, since there are no obstructions over the sea, the wind is less turbulent than
onshore, which means that the fatigue effects on the turbine generator are less and
therefore the lifespan of the turbines can be greater if corrosion is prevented.
(2) The second advantage is that there are less layout constraints. As there is more free
space available in the sea, offshore wind farms can be more versatile and scalable.
That means that larger installations can be built. Assuming that they do not have
the transport limitations that transport over land may have, wind turbine generators
can be larger in capacity than the onshore ones, achieving this way more energy
production per turbine. Also, as the wind turbines are placed far from the coast,
public opposition due to potential visual and noise issues is lessened.
(3) Offshore wind can directly support the hydrogen development (e.g., hydrogen hub for
filling hydrogen-powered ships; hydrogen powered industrial hubs) and significantly
contribute to a transition to low-carbon energy.
ASIDE: Oldest and largest machine
Wind power has an established track record for centuries in the sense that it has been used
for centuries for sailing ships, sawing wood, grinding grains, and many more. It is one of the
oldest sources of “machine” power which fits the definition of a machine (namely. a piece of
equipment with several moving parts that uses wind power to carry out a particular type of
work such as sawing wood). The invention of wind-powered sawmills by Dutchman Cornelis
Corneliszoon van Uitgeest in the late 16th century helped Holland increase ship production
through automated wood cutting, outcompeting their European rivals who were relying on
slow manual processes. It can also be said that offshore wind turbine machines are also the
largest moving machine. A typical 10-MW turbine will have three 80 m long blades and each
weighing circa 35 tons turning at average of 8–10 rpm.
A typical offshore wind farm can generate 1 GW of power, equivalent to one or two stan￾dard nuclear power plants. Figures 4.5 and 4.6 illustrate schematically typical layouts of

being developed in Denmark and the Netherlands. It was not until early 2000s that the
offshore wind capacity has started increasing significantly. In 2018, the worldwide capacity
of offshore installations was 23 GW and since then it increased at an annual rate of 15%
reaching 35 GW in 2021. The world leaders in offshore wind power production (in 2022)
are China, UK, and Germany with 26.5 GW, 13.6 GW, and 8 GW, respectively (Figure 4.4).
Over the next 5 years, more than 300 GW of new capacity is expected to be installed. By
then, China will have the largest share in offshore wind power, and at the same time, a
new market will be created in North America, where the first offshore wind farms will be
installed. The target of USA is to generate 30 GW by 2030.
Figure 4.8 shows wind farms planned in the USA.
Offshore wind farm locations in China
Also in China, about 15 GW of offshore wind farms are either operating or under construc￾tion or proposed; it is noted that one of the proposed wind farms will have a capacity of
6 GW (Figure 4.9).
4.3 Tackling intermittency of wind power
4.3.1 The sun, wind, and wind-resource map
In a nutshell, wind will blow as long as the sun is shining and therefore never-ending resource.
The ultimate source of energy responsible for the creation of wind is the sun. Sun bombards
the surface of the earth with radiation energy leading to a continuous warming. Of this
energy, a large amount is sent back to space and what remains is transformed into heat
energy. Due to the shape of the earth, its surface is not heated evenly resulting in the equator
getting more energy than the poles. As a result, there is a continuous heat transfer from the
equator to the poles. The atmospheric air consists of nitrogen and oxygen (totaling 99%), and
like all gasses, it expands when heated and contracts when cooled. When solar radiation hits
the surface of the earth, it causes the air to get warmer, which means that the air gets lighter
and less dense. This also results in the rise of warm air in higher altitudes and the creation of
areas of lower atmospheric pressure, where the air is warmer. Due to the variance in pressure,
the air will move from a high pressure to a lower pressure area, to reach equilibrium. Wind
can therefore be defined as the movement of atmospheric air masses from a region of high
atmospheric pressure to a region of low pressure.
However, the wind circulation system is even more complex. At 30∘ and 60∘ latitude, there is a
major change in atmospheric pressure creating zones of high and low pressure, respectively.
The air circulation within these zones is known as cells, and the major winds created as
a result are known as trade winds. Due to the Coriolis effect induced by the rotation of
the earth, the winds deflect to the right in the Northern hemisphere and to the left in the
Southern hemisphere one, leading to a spiral movement of the air mass. Figure 4.10 shows
this upper altitude global wind system. In addition to the global wind system, there are
localized influences as well that are mostly related to the terrain of an area and its proximity
to water bodies.
Wind characteristics, such as the speed and direction, are not regular and can have a spa￾tial and temporal variance. More specifically, wind speed is lower around the equator, and
it increases closer to the poles. The highest wind speeds are created within the region of

30∘ and 60∘ latitude, mostly because of a global wind circulation mechanism. However, the
Southern hemisphere has less land obstructions than the Northern one, resulting in higher
wind speeds. Therefore, the distribution of land has a major influence on the wind speed as
it can obstruct the free movement of air. In other words, wind speed can be higher in the
open sea than on land. Also, the wind speed is dependent on the time of the year, i.e., in the
Northern hemisphere, the mean wind speed is higher during winter. Further details on wind
energy can be found in Letcher (2023).8
ASIDE: Limits to wind power utilization
Gustavson1 carried out a study to estimate the limits to wind power utilization. It has been
suggested that approximately 2% of the solar energy (solar flux) striking the Earth’s surface
is converted into kinetic energy in wind. The average solar flux considering the whole of the
earth’s surface is 350 W/m2, and the total solar energy is 1.8 × 108 GW. Using 2% value pro￾vides the total wind energy over an earth element of 7 W/m2. Out of the total wind energy,
circa 35% is dissipated within 1 km of the earth’s surface and which provides an average of
2.5 W/m2
. This kinetic energy of the wind is converted by turbines, and the suggested 10%
extraction rate limit provides a value of 0.25 W/m2. It is important to note that the spatial
distribution of wind energy both across the surface of the Earth and vertically through the atmo￾sphere. As a rule of thumb, average annual wind speeds of 6 m/s and above at hub height are
considered a safe investment.
4.3.2 Wind and waves
Offshore wind turbines and support structures generally face a harsher environment than
their onshore counterparts. Winds are stronger, waves impose unwelcome dynamic loads,

corrosive sea spray, and saltwater test materials and components. It is a wild world out there,
as any oil rig worker or ocean sailor will confirm.
We have already discussed many features of the wind in Chapter 2, and two of them deserve
further attention in relation to offshore turbines: wind shear and turbulence.
Wind shear describes the increase in average wind speed with height above a surface and
depends mainly on surface roughness. A simple power law is often used to quantify the
effect (see also Equation 2.4):
U∕U0 = (
h∕h0
)a (4.1)
where U is the speed at height h, U0 is the speed at a reference height h0, and 𝛼 is a power law
exponent that depends on the roughness of the surface. Onshore, typical values of 𝛼 range
between 0.1 for smooth surfaces and 0.3 for rough ones. A value of 0.14, or 1/7, long regarded
as typical of grassland areas on the Great Plains of the USA, is often used as a default value
for other sites in the absence of specific data and gives rise to the so-called 1/7th power law.
Offshore, the same value is often used for sea surfaces—although in practice the roughness
must obviously depend on the height and pattern of the waves.
Variations of wind speed with height are important, but turbine output is more directly
related to the power in the wind, which is proportional to the cube of the speed. We may
modify Equation (4.1) to give the equivalent variation of power with height (see also
Equation (2.5)):
P∕P0 = (
h∕h0
)3a (4.2)
This equation allows us to predict the benefit, in power terms, of raising the hub height h of
a turbine above a reference height h0. Curves for several values of 𝛼 have already been drawn
in Figure 2.5.
Our primary interest here is in large offshore HAWTs rated between (say) 2 and 10 MW, with
rotor diameters between about 80 and 140 m and similar hub heights. Figure 4.11 addresses
this situation by taking a hub height of 100 m as a reference, then using Equations (4.1) and
(4.2) to estimate the effects of raising or lowering it by various amounts. Yellow is used for
wind speed, red for wind power, and both are normalized to unity at 100 m. Curves are drawn
for 𝛼 = 0.14 (the 1/7th power law), and the spread around each covers the range 0.1<𝛼<0.2,
which includes most offshore sites, in most sea states. For example, if 𝛼 = 0.14, raising the
hub height of a turbine from 100 to 120 m is expected to increase wind speed by about 2.5%
and wind power by about 7.5%. If 𝛼 = 0.2, denoting a rough sea surface, speed increases by
about 4% and power by about 12%.
The benefit of increasing hub height is undoubted, but against it must be set the extra cost
of a higher tower and stronger foundations. The balance of advantage may be hard to strike
because it is not easy to predict the wind shear properties of a particular site. Complicating
factors include:
■ The roughness of a sea surface (and therefore the value of 𝛼) is greatly affected by wave
conditions, which in turn depend on wind conditions, both locally and at a distance.
■ There is often a substantial time lag between changes in wind speed and changes in
wave height and pattern.

Figure 4.11 Variations of wind speed and power due to wind shear.
■ Wind shear is affected by seasonal temperature differences between air and water.
■ Many offshore wind farms are fairly close to the shore. Winds blowing from the shore,
which may develop over relatively rough land surfaces including hills and cliffs, tend to
produce higher values of 𝛼 than winds blowing over long stretches of sea. The effects of
wind shear on turbine performance, measured over a complete year, therefore depend
on variations of surface roughness with direction and on the wind rose pattern for
the site.
Another feature mentioned in Chapter 2 is turbulence. This refers to random short-term
fluctuations in wind speed and direction, including the strong gusts known by sailors as
squalls. It can exert heavy and even dangerous dynamic loads on turbine blades and struc￾tures. The intensity of turbulence at sea is generally less than on land because of lower surface
roughness and less variation of air temperature with height. However, it is worth noting that
turbulence is not entirely counterproductive because, on a wind farm, it tends to acceler￾ate energy exchange between turbine wakes and the prevailing wind, reducing wake lengths.
Shorter wakes in turn reduce array losses caused by interaction between adjacent turbines.
We should also note that in conditions of low atmospheric turbulence, individual turbines
may experience plenty of localized turbulence caused by upstream neighbors. Indeed, on a
large offshore wind farm, the major contributors to turbulence are often the turbines them￾selves (Figure 4.12).
How about that other great influence on offshore turbines and structures—ocean waves? The
first point to make is that surface waves on oceans, seas, and lakes are caused by the wind.
Indeed, wave energy—another renewable resource with great potential—may be thought
of as a child of wind energy. Unfortunately, waves are unwelcome in the context of off￾shore wind turbines for two main reasons: they have a major influence on surface roughness
and wind shear, and they push and buffet turbine support structures, producing unwanted
stresses and vibrations.

Figure 4.12 Catching the wind, resisting the waves (Source: With permission of Orsted).
Surface waves are not formed instantly but build up with time and with distance from
the nearest windward shore, known as the fetch. Locally generated waves in shallow and
medium-depth water are often short and choppy, whereas waves arriving from afar over
deep water tend to produce a regular swell. A well-developed wave pattern may take hours
or days to form and travel hundreds or even thousands of kilometers across an ocean.
The wave heights and patterns experienced by an offshore wind farm often bear little
relationship to how the wind is blowing locally, and wave direction may not coincide with
wind direction. So, although surface waves are wind generated, their relationship with the
wind that blows at a particular place and time is complex.
Wave patterns are often divided into three broad classes, illustrated by Figure 4.12:
■ Regular waves. Also known as Airy waves after George Airy (1801–1892), English
mathematician and astronomer, these waves are sinusoidal, or close to sinusoidal, in
the form and are typical of long-distance ocean swell.
■ Irregular waves. These have more complicated shapes and lack a single, well-defined
height or wavelength (distance between adjacent crests). They may be formed by inter￾action of regular waves arriving from different directions.
■ Random waves. Typical of choppy seas produced by strong and variable local winds,
random waves display a wide and unpredictable range of heights and wavelengths
(Figure 4.13).
The designers of offshore turbines need to consider the dynamic forces exerted by waves and
whether they occur at, or close to, the natural frequencies of towers and support structures.
In the case of regular (Airy) waves impinging on single tubular supports known as monopiles,

theoretical predictions are relatively straightforward;2 but with irregular or random waves,
far less so. Additional problems can arise with breaking waves, produced when the bases
of waves can no longer support their tops, causing collapse. This is most likely to happen
as waves enter shallow water close to shore. And last but not least, the designer needs to
consider rogue waves that occasionally place extreme loads on support structures and may
even threaten rotating blades at the low point of their travel.
The statistics of waves2 are analogous to those of the wind that we covered in Section 2.2.2. In
particular, the frequency of occurrence of random waves of different heights may be modeled
using a Rayleigh distribution, and the most dangerous wave that should be allowed for over
the lifetime of a wind farm may be predicted using a Gumbel distribution. It seems rather
satisfying that wind and waves, so intimately connected in nature, can be characterized by
similar theoretical models.
4.3.3 Wind-resource maps
In order to use wind as a reliable source of energy, it is essential to have the wind speed
and direction variance data. Such a tool is a wind map, showing how the mean wind speed is
distributed in an area. Figure 4.14 shows the global wind map for a period between 1979 and
2012, at an altitude of 100 m developed by Nikitas (2020).9 Figure 4.15 shows an offshore
wind map developed by The World Bank and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
(https://globalwindatlas.info/en).
4.3.4 Minimum wind speed to produce power and power curve
of a turbine
Figure 4.16 shows a series of power curves for larger turbines (8–12 MW) and is essentially
power production of a turbine plotted with respect to wind speeds. The power curve figure
shows that a turbine can generate power from a wind speed starting from as low as 4 m/s
and reach the rated power at about 12–15 m/s. It is therefore clear that high wind speed is
not needed to produce power. For the power generation equation, see Section 3.2.1 “Rotor
efficiency and the Betz limit.”
4.3.5 Storage of energy from offshore wind
At some level of grid penetration, electricity storage would be needed to accommodate the
variability of the wind-resource variability. The combination of offshore wind and with
storage systems such as batteries is schematically shown in Figure 4.17. Another option
is to produce hydrogen with the excess wind power and storing it as a dispatchable fuel
(Figure 4.18).

4.3.5.1 Hydrogen production using offshore wind—the Japanese “Jidai”
concept
The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) disaster was a devastating moment
in the history of mankind where cascading event due to earthquake led to failure of the
Nuclear Power Plant. Following the disaster, many countries such as Germany and Japan
reduced their reliance on nuclear power and compensated with fossil fuels and renewables.
Within the framework of global warming, and among others such as energy security, Japan
aims to become a carbon-free country through a “hydrogen society.”
The main idea is to generate hydrogen from water through renewable energy sources, such
as wind, solar, and hydroelectricity, and the Japanese named it the “Jidai concept,” see
Figure 4.18. The Jidai concept is a four-step process: (i) seawater is desalinated; (ii) electrol￾ysis is used to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water; (iii) hydrogen gas is compressed
to 700 bar to reduce storage volume; and (iv) high-pressure hydrogen gas is stored in a
module-based tank system. Similar attempts are also ongoing in major European economies.
These attempts have been boosted by other technology developments, i.e., the invention of
hydrogen-powered cars, trains, ships, and even aircrafts.
4.3.5.2 ASIDE: potential of green hydrogen
(1) The potential of hydrogen is huge in achieving net zero: through the existing off￾shore infrastructure of pipe networks, hydrogen can be transported for distribution.

With the advent of hydrogen cars and trains, the economy can be transformed with￾out the need for expensive metals that are needed for battery production.
(2) Studies are being conducted to demonstrate that a 100% hydrogen gas network is
equally as safe as the existing natural gas. It is worth noting that burning natural
gas to heat homes and businesses accounts for approximately a third of the UK’s
carbon emissions. Hydrogen powered commuter trains are available, and it has been
reported in New Civil Engineer that 30% of the UK rail fleet could be suitable for
running hydrogen powered trains. In summary, wind power has the potential to carry
the transition to low-carbon energy, transforming the fossil-fuel energy landscape to
a more sustainable energy future.
4.3.5.3 BATWIND project
Equinor, the developer of Hywind, is one of the first companies to develop storage solution
and is known as Batwind and the promotors are Equinor and Masdar. When Batwind will
be in operation, it will store energy produced from an offshore wind farm by which electri￾cal power produced at Hywind (25 km off the coast of Peterhead in Scotland, UK) will be
transported through cables to an onshore substation where the 1 MW batteries are placed.
The concept is schematically presented in Figure 4.17.
4.4 Offshore systems and choice of foundations
4.4.1 Turbines and foundations
The current surge of interest in offshore wind energy is stimulating the design and develop￾ment of ever-larger turbines, with 18 MW machines in prospect. The benefits of scale will
always tend to favor large machines over small ones; but what is the best design configuration
for these turbines, and will new types soon appear with even higher power ratings?
Onshore, the wind energy industry is dominated by the three-bladed horizontal-axis
machines that have undergone continuous development and improvement since the 1980s.
A huge amount of operating experience has been gained worldwide with these HAWTs.
From time to time, new designs of wind turbine are proposed, and the offshore market
is no exception. Large vertical axis machines are currently being considered, principally
because their rotors and generators can be installed relatively close to the sea surface and
the rotors do not need to yaw into the wind. But whether they can ever rival the efficiency,
reliability, and cost-effectiveness of today’s large HAWTs seem doubtful and will remain
so until prototypes have been installed and tested over a lengthy period. In the meantime,
today’s impressive HAWT designs will no doubt see further incremental improvements,
consolidating their hold on the burgeoning offshore market.
However, we should not assume that HAWT machines originally designed for use onshore
can be shipped out to sea without modification. The basic design philosophy may be sound,
but offshore turbines face a tough environment and need special features:
■ Extremely high reliability, because of the difficulties and costs of access, maintenance,
and repair at sea.

■ Resistance to corrosion and wear in the marine environment.
■ The ability to withstand very high wind speeds, squalls, and heavy seas.
■ Offshore turbines are often designed with higher cut-out wind speeds than their
onshore counterparts, taking advantage of the stronger wind regimes. This adds to
electricity generation but requires extra robustness.
As far as installation is concerned, the major difference between onshore and offshore tur￾bines lies in their foundations. Onshore, securing a turbine is normally fairly straightforward
using a heavy reinforced concrete pad set in the ground, group of piles or by rods grouted
into holes drilled in bedrock. Offshore, it is generally more challenging, and foundations
must take account of turbine weight and height, the nature of the sea bed, the depth of
water, and expected storm conditions.
In shallow and medium-depth waters, three main types of structure are used, as illustrated
in 19.
■ Monopile. This is a steel tube driven into the sea bed using a heavy-duty pile driver, to a
typical depth between 20 and 40 m. A yellow transition piece including a platform (see
also Figures 4.21 and 4.22) connects the monopile to the base of the turbine’s tower.
A monopile is normally the simplest and cheapest type of foundation in shallow water,
including much of the North Sea.

Figure 4.22 A 6 MW turbine supported by a “jacket” off the coast of Scotland (Source: With permission of
Repower).
■ Gravity foundation. An alternative to the monopile, a gravity foundation relies on its
own weight to secure and stabilize the turbine. It needs a large base area to coun￾teract the overturning moment produced by the turbine, and the sea floor must be
dredged uniform and level to receive it. A gravity foundation for a large turbine may
weigh in excess of 1000 tons including ballast and is normally fabricated in reinforced
concrete.
■ Tripod or “jacket”. A welded triangular or four-legged structure made from tubular
steel is often the preferred option in medium-depth waters, secured to the sea bed
by piles. Less sea floor preparation is needed than for gravity foundations. Structures
known as “jackets,” similar to lattice towers, are often suitable since they have been
used in the offshore oil and gas industries for many years and their design and
performance is well understood (see also Figure 4.22).
In water depths above 60 m, the size and cost of rigid underwater structures tend to be pro￾hibitive, and it is hardly surprising that current offshore wind farms are almost all located in
fairly shallow water. But as the offshore industry develops, there is increasing interest in float￾ing turbines for deep-water locations. In principle, a floating turbine can be assembled close
to shore, towed out to sea, and anchored to the sea bed with relatively light, simple, equip￾ment. It can subsequently be moved if required and eventually decommissioned leaving little

or no trace behind. Of various floating turbine concepts proposed over the years, Figure 4.23
illustrates two concepts:
■ Submerged tension-legged platform. This system consists of a floating platform held
just below the sea surface by slim tension legs or tendons anchored to the seabed.
Clearly, the platform must have sufficient buoyancy to support the turbine while main￾taining tension in the legs under all sea and wind conditions. Similar platforms are used
by the offshore oil and gas industries on some of their rigs. A prototype supporting a
relatively small wind turbine was placed in a water depth of about 110 m off the coast
of southern Italy in 2007.3

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseFundamentals of offshore system
■ Spar buoy. Kept in place by mooring lines and anchors, a spar buoy is essentially
a long closed cylinder that floats upright below the sea surface and is stabilized by
ballast in its base. Buoyancy requirements are comparable with those of a submerged
tension-legged platform. A prototype system of this type, supporting a 2.3 MW
HAWT and with its floating element extending 100 m below the sea surface, was
installed in about 200 m of water off the coast of Norway in 2009.4
The detailed design and construction of such systems are only hinted at by the illustrations
in Figure 4.23 and will no doubt evolve with experience. Some very interesting and challeng￾ing issues must be addressed if floating turbines are to match the reliability and operating
efficiency of machines fixed to the sea floor by rigid structures. Perhaps most importantly:
■ Turbine stability. Floating structures cannot easily provide highly stable platforms for
mounting wind turbines. How is the turbine controlled in yaw so that it faces the
oncoming wind? How does any pitching or rocking of the float in heavy seas impinge
on turbine aerodynamics and efficiency?
■ Stresses and fatigue. Interactions between wind and waves mean that hydrodynamic
stresses on the undersea structure interact with aerodynamic and mechanical stresses
on the turbine, producing a complex fatigue environment.
As the offshore wind industry develops, moving into deeper waters, and experiencing more
severe wind conditions, it is clear that there will be plenty of employment opportunities for
innovative design engineers and skilled turbine installers.
As mentioned earlier, typically, for up to 60 m of water depth, the foundations are placed
directly on the seabed and are of a fixed type—known as bottom-fixed wind turbine.
However, for deeper waters, the wind turbines are placed on top of floating structures.
Figure 4.24 presents the two types of systems (Grounded and Floating) together with main
types of foundations commonly used today at different depths of water.
Figure 4.25 shows four types of floating system: Semi-submersible; Tension Leg Platform
(TLP) system; (c) barge type; (d) spar type.

The choice of foundation will depend on the following: site conditions (wind, wave, current,
seabed condition, ground profile, water depth, etc.), available fabrication and installation
expertise, operation and maintenance, decommissioning laws of the land, and finally eco￾nomics. Below is a description of an ideal foundation to support offshore wind turbines
following Bhattacharya (2019)3
:
(1) A foundation is capacity or “rated power” specific (i.e., 6 MW or 10 MW rated power)
but not turbine manufacturer specific. In other words, a foundation designed to
support a 5 MW turbine can support turbines of any make. There are other advan￾tages in the sense that turbines can easily be replaced even if a particular manufac￾turer stops manufacturing them.
(2) Method of foundation installation which is not necessarily weather sensitive, i.e., not
dependent on having a calm sea or a particular wind condition. The installation of
the first offshore wind farm in the USA took more time than that was expected as a
result of unsuitable weather conditions.
(3) Low maintenance and operational costs, i.e., need least amount of inspection. For
example, a jacket-type foundation needs inspection at the weld joints.
Figure 4.26 shows choice of foundations based on turbine size and associated sea depths.
Figure 4.27 shows examples of turbine foundations. It is advantageous to have a large
number of turbines in a wind farm to achieve economies of scale. If the continental shelf
is very steep, grounded (fixed) turbines are not economically viable, and a floating system is
desirable.

4.5 Offshore wind farm case studies

off the coast of Denmark in 1992. The “offshore club” was soon joined by Sweden,

The Netherlands, and the UK. But true to its reputation as a small but powerful engine
room of modern wind technology, Denmark retained the record for wind farm size (in
terms of installed capacity) for the next 17 years. The record book looks for the first 20 years
looks like this:
Wind farm Country Year No. of turbines Installed capacity (MW)
Vindeby Denmark 1992 11 5
Middelgrunden Denmark 2001 20 40
Horns Rev 1 Denmark 2002 80 160
Nysted Denmark 2004 72 166
Lynn and inner dowsing UK 2009 54 194
Horns Rev 2 Denmark 2009 91 209
Thanet UK 2010 100 300
We focus here on Horns Rev 2 which began spinning its turbines in 2009. It attracts a great
deal of international attention because of its size, technical features, and Danish pedigree
and follows on from the well-known Horns Rev 1 wind farm, sited in the same area but
closer to the shore, which held the record in 2002–2004.
Rev is Danish for reef and reminds us that Horns Rev 2 is sited on a reef in shallow water
about 30 km off the westernmost point of Denmark, close to the city of Esbjerg. There is an
excellent wind resource with prevailing westerly winds blowing unhindered across the North
Sea, giving an average wind speed close to 10 m/s at the hub height of the turbines. The water
depth and sea bed are suitable for monopiles with a diameter of 3.9 m and various lengths
between 28 m and 40 m, set in the sea bed with the help of a large jackup barge (Figure 4.28).
Details of the turbines5 and wind farm6 include:
■ Installed capacity 209 MW
■ Number of turbines 91
■ Turbine rated power 2.3 MW
■ Rated wind speed 13–14 m/s
■ Cut-in and cut-out wind speeds 4 m/s and 25 m/s
■ Rotor diameter 93 m
■ Hub height 68 m
■ Rotor speed 6–16 rpm
■ Weight (rotor and nacelle) 142 tons
■ Turbine layout 13 rows in 7 radial circles
■ Water depth 9–17 m
■ Wind farm area 33 km2
■ In-farm cable length 70 km
■ Cable length to shore 42 km
The electricity generated by the turbines is collected by undersea cables and delivered to a
substation located within the wind farm (see Figure 4.29). The main power cable to shore
includes optical fibers for data transmission.

Figure 4.30 Installation complete at Horns Rev 2 (Source: With permission of Orsted).
The annual energy production of Horns Rev 2 is estimated as equivalent to the consump￾tion of about 200,000 Danish households. Back in Section 1.4, we discussed the concept
of “equivalent households,” widely used by developers and electric utilities to inform the
public about the amount of electricity generated by wind farms, and explained how impor￾tant it is to understand the underlying assumptions. The completed Horns Rev 2 is shown in
Figure 4.30.
A pioneering feature of Horns Rev 2 is its accommodation platform, known as Poseidon,
which allows personnel to stay “on site” rather than traveling 2 hours by boat from Esbjerg
harbor. It has 24 rooms including kitchen, dining room, study room, and gym, with a total
area of 750 m2 on three decks. Poseidon weighs 420 tons, supported by its own monopile, and
is joined by a walkway to a substation platform incorporating a helipad.
The installation of Horns Rev 2 took 20 months, employed 600 construction staff, and
required 25 support vessels. It created quite a stir when it started operation in 2009 and will
no doubt contribute handsomely to Denmark’s offshore electricity generation for many
years to come.
4.5.2 Case study: London Array
Construction work for London Array7 began in 2009. The UK had already gained consid￾erable experience with large offshore wind farms, including the Thanet farm sited off the
Kent coast that raised the bar to 300 MW. London Array moves offshore installations a
stage further, aiming to be the first wind farm in the world to reach the milestone figure of
1000 MW, or 1 GW.

It is always an advantage to generate electricity close to population centers, curtailing the
inevitable power losses associated with long-distance transmission. This makes a large wind
farm sited in the Thames Estuary an attractive proposition. There is a very good wind
resource with an average wind speed at turbine hub height of about 9 m/s (see Figure 2.19).
When completed London Array is predicted to supply enough electricity, over a full year,
to satisfy the needs of about 750,000 households in a heavily populated region of southeast
England.
Figure 4.31(a) shows the wind farm site, which is 20–30 km offshore from Margate (Kent)
and Clacton (Essex) and about 120 km from central London. The total site area is about
250 km2. Electricity is taken ashore by submarine cables to a new substation at Cleve Hill
near the city of Canterbury. The substation boosts the voltage from 150 to 400 kV and feeds
the electricity into the national high-voltage transmission grid.
London Array is being achieved in two phases and we focus here on Phase 1, the initial
installation of 175 turbines with a combined capacity of 630 MW. Part (b) of Figure 4.31
shows the turbine layout, emphasizing the importance of seabed topology in the design of
offshore systems. There are two major issues in the case of London Array: sand banks in the
estuary and shipping lanes.
Phase 1 occupies an area of about 100 km2, covering part of the Long Sand and Deep Knock
sandbanks plus the shallow channel separating them. Water depths and the composition of
sandbanks and seabed are well suited to monopile foundations topped by transition pieces.
It is essential to avoid Black Deep, a much deeper channel along the northwest margin
of the site, which is used as a main shipping lane by vessels going to and from the Port
of London.
The turbine array forms a rectangular grid pattern. Prevailing winds blow mainly from the
southwest so the grid is slanted in this direction. It also suits the other main winds—east to
northeast—that tend to blow across the North Sea from continental Europe in the winter
and early spring. Downwind spacing between adjacent turbines is about 8.5 rotor diameters,
and crosswind spacing is about 5.5 rotor diameters (as discussed in Section 3.6.2).

figure). These substations transform the AC voltage to 150 kV for submarine transmission
to the onshore substation at Cleve Hill using specialized cables that include optical fibers for
data transmission. Although it is always tempting to focus on the most dramatic and visible
parts of an offshore wind farm—turbines standing majestically above the ocean waves—we
should always remember the design effort and engineering expertise needed to bring the
precious electricity ashore (Figure 4.32). Finally, Figure 4.33 shows London Array’s first
stage of offshore installation that began in 2011.
4.5.3 Case study: World’s first floating wind farm
Hywind Scotland Pilot Park is the first floating wind farm with rated capacity of 30 MW
with five turbines, located 30 km off the coast of Scotland, see Figure 4.34. In October 2017,
Hywind started delivering power to Scottish Electricity grid. The water depth is 95–120 m,
and the mean waves (Hs) are 1.8 m. The average wind speed at 100 m height is 10.1 m/s, and a
spar type of concept is used. The turbine structure is anchored using conventional three-line
mooring as is used in FPSO (floating production storage and offloading) anchoring. The
anchor piles are having a dimension of 7 m diameter and are 16 m long. The control
system that is used to dampen out motions is the blade pitch control. The whole system is
full scale tested through Hywind Demo 2.3 MW turbine installed in 2009 having 5 years
of operational data. Figure 4.35 shows some of the installation photos of the floating
system.

4.6 Bringing the power ashore
The design of a cable system for a large offshore wind farm raises important technical and
economic issues. Within the farm itself, the AC electricity generated by individual turbines
must be collected by submarine cables and delivered to one or more substations for onward
transmission to shore. Up to this point, the system voltage is typically limited to 33 kV
by the cost and size of transformers and associated switchgear.2 But now comes the big
question—how far away is the onshore substation, and which technology is most suitable for
bringing the power ashore?
For cable lengths up to about 50 km conventional three-phase high-voltage AC transmis￾sion is the most economical solution. The transmission voltage is chosen to strike a balance
between the capital cost of equipment and the expected power losses in transformers and
cables over the projected life of the system. For example, London Array uses 150 kV for the
final run to shore, transformed up to 400 kV in an onshore substation (Figure 4.36) before
feeding into the UK’s main transmission grid.7 The system is having AC throughout.
For distances to shore above 50 km, an alternative technical solution becomes increasingly
attractive—high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission. For distances greater than
100 km, it is virtually imperative. In view of our comments in Section 3.4.1 about the
historical ascendancy of AC over DC, this may seem rather surprising. But since the 1930s,
HVDC has quite often been chosen for bulk transmission of electrical power over long
distances, and today there are onshore HVDC links over 2000 km long in China and Brazil.

The basic attractions of DC over AC are smaller capital costs and power losses in cables as
the transmission distance increases. And in the case of submarine transmission, there is a
very important additional factor—cable capacitance.
In our discussion of AC electricity in Section 3.4.1, we saw how resistors dissipate real power,
whereas inductors and capacitors demand reactive power. Long submarine cables have much
higher capacitance than equivalent onshore cables strung between pylons because their con￾ductors are separated by thin layers of insulation and surrounded by a metal sheath. The
capacitance appears in parallel with the load and demands reactive power that must flow
through the cable’s resistance, causing power losses. There are also dielectric losses in the
cable’s insulation materials. As cable length increases, reactive power flow takes up more and
more of the cable’s current-carrying capacity which, of course, should be primarily devoted
to transporting real power from wind turbines to the shore. The cable could be increased in
size and weight to compensate, but beyond a certain length this is no longer economic.
The capacitance problem is solved by HVDC transmission. Cable capacitance is charged
only once when the system is first energized; thereafter, the entire current-carrying capacity
can be used to transmit useful power. HVDC has several further advantages:
■ It needs fewer conductors than a three-phase AC system.
■ For a given peak (rated) voltage, each conductor can carry more power. DC operates
constantly at peak voltage, but AC power depends on the rms voltage, which is only
71% (1/√
2) of the peak.
■ HVDC isolates the wind farm’s AC system from that of the grid. The offshore and
onshore systems need not be synchronized, offering advantages in stability and the
independent control of real and reactive power.
The main disadvantage of HVDC transmission is the need for expensive power con￾verters at the sending and receiving ends of the link. Fortunately, electronic power
converters—rectifiers and inverters based on high-power transistors and other solid-state
devices2
—have made great strides in the past 30 years. The underlying principles and
technology have many parallels with the power converters used for variable-speed wind
turbines (see Section 3.4.2). However, we are now talking about the much greater power
levels of whole wind farms, rather than that of individual turbines.
High-power submarine cables, whether transmitting AC or DC, must work for many years
in a hostile environment with extremely high levels of electrical stress. For example, a HVDC
link rated at 1 GW and operating at 200 kV must carry up to 5000 A. The insulation must
withstand 200 kV without breakdown, and the conductors must carry 5000 A without over￾heating or wasting too much precious power. Present interest in HVDC for offshore wind
is giving a big boost to the development of new cable designs and materials,2 including
fiber optics for data transmission. In land, HVDC transmission operating at 800 kV is in
operation today, and the industry is developing 1.1 MV technology; see Chapter 7, Grid
integration, for further discussion on HVDC.

a density of air of 1.223 kg/m3. Make assumption on the blade diameter and other
data you may need. Use same assumptions as problem 4.1 and compare the results.
4.3 For offshore wind turbine ranging between 2.3 and 14 MW, plot the rotor diameter
versus the turbine rated power (MW). Making an assumption that the blade is half
the rotor diameter, plot the blade length versus the turbine rated power. What are the
manufacturing and installation challenges as the blades get longer?
4.4 For the three turbines in Appendix 4.A, find the blade tip speed for the following con￾ditions: (a) cut-in condition; (b) rated power condition. What are the implications if
the tip speed is too high.
4.5 For offshore wind turbine ranging between 2.3 and 14 MW, plot the hub height versus
the turbine rated power (MW). You may take 30 m as the average water depth and
monopile foundation. How does the stiffness of the tower change with turbine size?
How will the turbine size affect the design foundation loads? Make assumptions for
data required.
4.6 For offshore wind turbine ranging between 2.3 and 14 MW, plot the rotor Nacelle
assembly (RNA) mass versus the turbine rated power (MW). How does this affect
the design. Combining the data on RNA mass together with the stiffness of the tower
(based on Question 4.5), comment on the vibration period of the system.
4.7 Using the data in Appendix 4.B, comment on the historic growth of the offshore wind
farm industry in terms of turbine size, system (grounded or floating) used, and distance
from the sea. Can this be used as a guidance for countries willing to develop offshore
wind farm.
4.8 Plot the existing data of wind turbine installation of existing offshore wind farms
in terms of turbine capacity, water depth, and foundation chosen and comment on
the graph. Apart from using the data in the Appendix 4.B.2, you can get more data
from the literature. Can this graph be used as a preliminary guidance for choosing
foundations?
Answers to questions
Q4.1 The main components are (a) Turbines and its support structure; (b) offshore substa￾tions which collect all the power from the individual turbines; (c) array cable which
transmits powers from turbines to the substation; (d) export cable which transfers
power from offshore substation ultimately to the grid.
Q4.2 Foundations support the loads and provide the stability of the whole system. For
example, the thrust of the blades is applied at the hub level and is taken by the springs.
Q4.3 As the turbine rated power increases, the blade length increases. It is important that
the blades does not experience the wave action. There must a considerable air gap
between the tip of the blade and the surface of the water.
Q4.4 The main considerations for choosing foundations are turbine size, seabed condition,
ground profile, water depth, available fabrication, and installation expertise.
Q4.5 Batteries and Hydrogen.

Q4.6 Pros: Can produce large energy per unit use of materials, less use of seabed space, and
can be installed faster and less offshore time to install Cons: Large sizes of compo￾nents (longer blades, larger diameter tower, and foundation) need large fabrication
facilities, need specialized vessels (heavy lift vessels with large crane), and expertise
to install.
Q4.7 Yes, they are close to population centers (see Figure 4.8 for example) Examples:
(a) South Fork (United States): Location: Proposed offshore wind farm to be located
off the coast of Long Island (New York) and close to the New York metropoli￾tan area. (b) London Array (UK): Located in the Thames Estuary, off the coast
of Kent and Essex in the United Kingdom. Proximity to greater London, one of the
largest metropolitan areas in Europe.
Q4.8 There are many advantages: (a) energy can be harvested from deeper water and fur￾ther away from offshore without disrupting the shipping channels. (b) Foundation
requirements needs are lot simpler, and the sizes are lot smaller than bottom-fixed
turbines. (c) Easy to install and occupy less sea-bed space. (d) Major repair and main￾tenance of bottom fixed are done in situ and are expensive. However, floating systems
can be towed to the dock and repaired.

5 Offshore wind farm engineering
Following the considerations of site wind resources and wind turbine technologies described
in Chapter 4, this chapter describes what it takes to develop a wind farm project. The basic
elements include concept feasibility assessment, site investigation, engineering design for
foundations, array design (i.e., layout of the wind farm), project commissioning, operation
and maintenance plan, and end-of-life decommissioning plan. Of course, project economics
are also paramount, and this will be discussed in Chapter 8.
The concept feasibility assessment examines the viability of the project. It entails a prelimi￾nary investigation of proposed project along the lines of site resources, type of turbine and
system (grounded or floating), and electrical infrastructure (cable and substation type, cable
route, and grid connection). The feasibility assessment is followed with a site-specific sur￾vey so that detailed design can be carried out. One of the important aspects is a reliable
ground survey, which is required not only for designing but also for planning of installation.
The project plan development follows with detailed design and commissioning of wind farm
(i.e., installation of turbines on the support structure), operation and maintenance (OPEX)
for power production, and finally a plan for the eventual end-of-life decommissioning.
The key aspects in offshore wind farm engineering are as follows:
(a) Wind farm design (i.e., layout of the wind power generation assets, i.e., turbines, trans￾mission assets, i.e., substation and cables and in some cases planning the energy storage
assets). The associated engineering decisions are spacing of the turbines, location of
the substations, and finally the cable (both interarray and export cable) layout. This
step involves region-specific techno-economic analysis and requires optimization. The
essential data required for such analysis are turbine type, wind and wave data, geology
of the seabed, local skills, availability of port, and construction logistics including vessel
availabilities.
(b) To enable efficient and economic wind farm design, detailed site investigations are
required, which involves collection of water depth information (bathymetry), wind
field, wave information, and ground profile data. Wind data are needed to estimate
the energy yield from the wind farm as well as thrust loads on the structure and

foundation. Wave data are used to estimate the hydrodynamic loads on the structure
and the foundations. Ground data on geology and soil conditions is necessary to
choose the appropriate foundations, cable sizes, and scour protection design.
(c) Choice of the wind turbine system: The main decision is to choose grounded system
(i.e., anchored to the seabed) or floating system for a given water depth and the ground
condition. For example, within the grounded system—jacket or monopile and examples
of floating system are barge, spar, semi-sub, tension leg platform (TLP), see Figures 4.24
and 4.25.
(d) Choosing the appropriate foundation system, associated design, and the method of
installation.
(e) Choice of substation system (AC or DC) and capacity needed.
(f) Methods of installation of foundation and assembly of the turbine and grid connection.
(g) Planning operations and maintenance of these assets.
(h) Decommissioning and end-of-life aspects.
5.1 Conceptual design of wind arms
In the concept design stages, the main drivers are as follows:
(a) Annual energy yield (AED), that is, revenue generated by selling electricity over a year.
This is dependent on the wind resource at the location and the turbine-rated power. The
readers are referred to the World Bank wind resource map (Figure 4.15 in Chapter 4).
(b) CAPEX and OPEX. This is mainly dependent on the geology of the site, water depth,
turbine type, technology employed (floating or bottom-fixed system), and the installa￾tion vessel requirements and availability.
Concept design is multiparameter optimization process, and most methods use the levelized
cost of energy (LCOE) ($/MWh) as the optimization goal. It is important to highlight
the variables and most important ones are (i) turbine availability; (ii) wake (interactions
among the individual turbines can have significant impact on the overall power gener￾ation); (iii) cable lengths and grid connection costs; (iv) CAPEX (cost models for the
turbines, support structures, cables); (v) operation expenditure (OPEX), installation and
decommissioning.
In terms of a given site, the key factors that influence CAPEX are: (i) turbine size, (ii) water
depth, (iii) distance to shore, (iv) geology of the site (soil types), and (v) installation and
commissioning costs.
5.1.1 ASIDE 1: spacing of turbines and changes in geology
and water depth
Larger spacing between turbines will yield higher power output and AED. However, as the
turbines are spaced, there will be increase in CAPEX cost due to longer cable lengths, change
in water depth, and/or change in geology. Figure 5.1 shows recommended typical spacing

of turbines for preliminary design purposes; spacing of 6D (D is rotor diameter) is recom￾mended along the main wind direction. For a typical 8 MW turbine, the rotor diameter is
164 m, and therefore, the spacing will be approximately 1 km. Figure 5.2 shows the change in
water depth for various oceans. It is clear from the figure that offshore California has a steep
continental slope, and therefore, many of the developments are more likely to be floating. It
is prudent to highlight examples of some wind farms showing the variability in layout and
other aspects.
5.2 Cases studies
5.2.1 Dogger bank offshore wind farm
Dogger Bank Offshore Wind Farm is world’s largest wind farm with 3.6 GW capacity
and is being constructed in UK waters off the coast of Yorkshire; see Figure 5.3 for site
location. This is an isolated sandbank within the central to southern North Sea spanning
UK, German, Danish, and Dutch waters. It is located between 125 and 290 km off the east
coast of Yorkshire (UK). The water depth ranges from 18 to 63 m. There are three phases
of 1.2 GW each and will be known as Dogger Banks A, B, and C. The first turbine at
Dogger Bank A has started operating in October 2023 and is producing electricity that
is fed to the UK’s national grid via Dogger Bank’s high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
transmission system. The wind farm has GE Haliade-X 13 MW turbines with 107 m long

blades (Figure 5.4). Dogger Bank has the potential to improve resilience of electricity in
Europe by linking coordinated network to Europe through interconnectors. The large wind
farm can also support large-scale hydrogen production and connect to a wider hydrogen
network that will help decarbonization of energy-intensive industries.
5.2.2 Westermost rough wind farm
Figure 5.5 shows the location of Westermost Rough Wind Farm also in the UK. The name￾plate capacity is 210 MW with 35 turbines of 6-MW-rated power. Figure 5.6 shows the
vertical ground profile of Westermost Rough Wind Farm where the changes in geology
(defined by BC, Bo, Sw, and Ch) and water depth may be noted. The water depth at the
site varied between 16 and 26 m.
If the geology of the site changes, it is likely that the theoretical optimized foundation dimen￾sions will also change as different ground offers different level of resistance. Furthermore, it
is expensive and operationally challenging to have many types of foundations for the same
wind farm. The challenge is from the point of fabrication, transportation, and installation.
It will be uneconomic to design 35 foundations individually having different dimensions,
which may have a low material content but a higher fabrication cost as economy of scales is
lost. Therefore, overall optimization is necessary.
Another important consideration is the possible impact of wind farm on shipping, fishing,
and other activities. Figure 5.7 shows the 28 days maritime traffic survey of the Westermost
Rough site, carried out using a combination of shore-based radar, AIS, and visual obser￾vations taken from the nontechnical summary required for obtaining consent/permissions
outside the main traffic. This shows that Westermost Rough wind farm is in a fishing
area.

in the Swedish part of the Baltic Sea, approximately 7 km away from the coastal town of

Vestas V112 turbines with a hub height of 80 m and a capacity of 3 MW each are installed
on gravity-based foundations in water depths of up to 20.5 m. The layout of the farm is a
single line of 16 turbines (Figure 5.8).

5.2.4 West of Duddon sands
The West of Duddon Sands Offshore Wind Farm comprises 108 wind turbines with a total
installed capacity of 389 MW located in the East Irish Sea approximately 14 km from the
nearest coast on Walney Island, Cumbria. It is situated near the wind farms of Barrow,
Walney, and Ormonde. As shown in Figure 5.9, there is an open space in the middle of
the farm because of igneous rock shape intrusion forming dikes. There are uncertainties
associated with the drilling through the rocks, and therefore, it was prudent to avoid that
region.
5.2.5 Development of offshore wind in the USA
The US East Coast, and particularly the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), is devel￾oping commercial offshore wind due favorable wind resource, close to major population
centers as well as shallow water depths (<100 m). BOEM subdivides the Atlantic OCS into
four planning areas (i) North Atlantic, (ii) Mid-Atlantic, (iii) South Atlantic, and (iv) Straits
of Florida, see Figure 5.10. Figure 5.11 provides tentative details of the wind farms in these
regions, and Figure 5.12 shows the corresponding wind speed categories.

5.2.6 Wind farm development in China
Figure 5.13 shows offshore wind farm development off the east coast of China. Preliminary
estimates show that there is 200 GW of potential wind power within water depth of 25 m
and an additional 300 GW available in water depth between 25 and 50 m. Figure 5.14 shows
the bathymetry around the Chinese seas with water depths. It is worth noting that the elec￾tricity demand is concentrated in the developed eastern coastal regions; thus, offshore wind
development appears to be an ideal solution to meet a growing demand.
In the concept design stage, the main aim is to develop a project design envelop by narrowing
down the options on number of turbines and the farm layout (i.e., array design), type of
support structures, substation locations, inter-array cables, and the export cable. The concept
design will enable the site investigation schedule and is discussed in the next section.

5.3 Detailed site investigation
Site investigation follows the conceptual design phase; it typically comprises of the following
steps:
(1) Control system design and revenue generation calculations. Wind, wave, and current time
series data for the location are acquired so that the scour protection and control systems
for the turbine can be designed. The time series of wind can also support the estimation
of the wind energy that can be produced in the lifetime.
(2) Foundation design for the turbine support structure and offshore substation structure.
There can be wide variations in geology across wind farms as well as at a particular
site. Figure 5.15 shows geological profile for 12 European wind farms where turbines
of different capacity are installed. The foundations for these wind farms are monopiles
with different dimensions (i.e., length, diameter, and wall thickness). Furthermore, the
foundations are also embedded in different depths. The figure shows that ground is
variable and highlights the importance of good understanding of the site.

4.0/https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/10/12/1872).
(3) Cable route assessment. There are two types of cables (interarray and export cables) to
transmit the electricity generated to the onshore grid. Investigation is necessary along
the cable route for design purposes and installation planning. The major considerations
are scour prediction, cable protection, and turbidity changes in the water. An example
of scour-related early decommissioning of wind farm is discussed in Aside (2) for Robin
Rigg Wind Farm.
(4) Planning and analysis of installation of foundations. Jack-up rigs are often used to install
foundation, and detailed ground profile is necessary for jack-up rig leg penetration anal￾ysis. If the soil is soft, such systems are not suitable. Another example is whether suction
can be used to install foundations.
(5) Geo-hazard assessment. Slope stability (submarine slides) or presence of gassy soils.
Seismic analysis would require prediction of liquefaction susceptibility of the ground
and site-response analysis, unexploded ordnance (UXO).

5.3.1 ASIDE 2: observed scour in Robin Rigg Wind Farm which
had to be decommissioned mid-way in the lifecycle
The Robin Rigg wind farm, commissioned in 2009, is located 13 km Northwest of the Port of
Workington (North England, UK) and was composed of 58 Vestas V90 wind turbines, each
3 MW. The seabed consists of different sandy deposits (17–21 m in depth) located across
the estuary; these are interbedded with silts and clays and lie above glacial till. During
these years, scour around the foundations (monopiles) developed as shown in Figures 5.16
and 5.17. The considerable reduction of the embedment length of the foundation resulted in
the drop in natural frequency of the system which implied a significant structural risk, which
led to the decommission of the turbine.
5.3.2 Variability in ground profiles
Understanding the ground conditions is fundamental in designing of foundations. Good
quality ground significantly de-risks the foundation construction and performance and is

On the other hand, the geological history of US Atlantic OCS (i.e., East Coast of USA;
Table 5.1) region is highly variable with significant layering and spatial variations due to
diverse sediment origin and post-deposition history (Figure 5.10). There is boulder in the
northern part and calcareous soils in the southern part of the coast. A new type of soil called
“green sand” is encountered in three of the wind farm development (Empire Wind, Sunrise,
and
Beacon Wind) off coast of Massachusetts and one south of Long Island (New York)
shown in Figure 5.20. Green sand is coarse-grained materials having Glauconite mineral
(which is an iron potassium mica) and is characteristically green. Green sand has the
tendency to transform from a stiff, high permeability coarse-grained material to a weak,
low permeability fine-grained material due to particle crushing. In terms of wind farm
construction, this material can pose significant risks during installation of foundations for
grounded systems (i.e., bottom-fixed turbines). Further details on the characteristics can be
found in Westgate et al.

5.3.3 Stages of investigation for ground model
Site investigation consists of geological, geophysical, and geotechnical, and they are
described in this section:
5.3.3.1 Geological study
A study based on geological history of formation can be the basis of planning site investiga￾tion and concept study and is used to create the first ground model. Ground-related hazards
depend on the location of the wind farm. This can be classified as
(a) Man-made hazards: examples include existing infrastructure such as oil and gas
pipelines either on the seabed or buried, communication cables, ship wrecks, jack-up
footprints, unexploded ordnance, etc.

(b) Natural seabed hazards: this includes rock outcrops, seabed topography, seabed chan￾nels, unstable and steep slopes, etc. Example is the West Duddon Sand project (see
Section 5.2.4).
(c) Subsurface geological hazards: examples include rapidly changing stratigraphy, buried
infilled channels, igneous intrusions near seabed, tectonic faults, gas hydrates zone, pres￾ence of gassy soils, and so on.
5.3.3.2 Geophysical survey
This involves mobilizing specialist vessels to map the seabed surface as well as subsea floor,
and the data generated are used to update the ground model. This is often carried out before
the final business decision is taken.

5.3.3.3 Geotechnical investigation
This is detailed and is carried out when the final investment decision is taken. Typical cost
for geotechnical site investigation in Europe is circa $15 M (2024 costs) for a 1 GW wind
farm. Geotechnical investigation involves construction of boreholes to get soil samples for
laboratory testing. There are other types of soil testing carried out such as cone penetration
test (CPT). For details, the readers are referred to Chapter 4 of Bhattacharya1 for further
details.
5.4 Offshore construction
5.4.1 Introduction
The offshore construction phase involves installation of foundations, cables, and commis￾sioning of turbines and connection to the grid. Figure 5.21 shows schematic of transporta￾tion and installation of gravity base system (GBS), whereby the foundation is placed on the
seabed or shallowly embedded inspired by Karehamn Offshore Wind Farm (see Figure 5.8
for the layout). The main steps are seabed preparation, which includes leveling the seabed,
transportation of the foundations in a barge, installation of the foundations, ballasting of the
foundation, scour protection around the foundation, and finally installation of the tower and
the turbine. Figure 5.22 shows the transportation and installation of Jacket type of system
based on Seagreen Offshore Wind Farm.
Different types of vessels are required for installing different wind turbine parts; main ones
are Jack-up rigs or floating heavy lift vessels (HLV), support vessels, tug/anchor handlers,
cable lay vessels, survey vessels, seabed preparation vessels, crew transfer vessels, scour pro￾tection installation vessels, and cable protection installation vessels. Helicopters may also be
used during the construction phase for equipment and personnel transfer.

5.4.2 Choosing foundation systems
The choice of wind turbine foundation depends on the water depth and the geology of
the bottom. For waters deeper than 50–60 m, floating turbines would be used regardless
of the geology of the bottom. Figure 5.23 shows the collation of worldwide data on the
type of foundation used based on the turbine-rated power and water depth. Figure 5.24
schematically shows the design envelope of floating systems. There are two choices in terms
of mooring systems: (i) Taut mooring and (ii) catenary mooring. The anchoring options are
also shown in the figure. Table 5.2 provides some examples where the different foundation
options have been used. Figure 5.25 shows a particular type of foundation system known as
Suction Bucket Jacket (SBJ).

5.5 Engineering models of wind turbine systems
This section provides salient features of these systems in terms of load transfer mechanism
of loads from structure to the ground and modes of vibration of the overall structure.
5.5.1 Load transfer mechanism from the structure to the ground
One of the main aims of the overall design and the foundation is to transfer of loads from
the wind turbine structure (i.e., aerodynamic thrust acting on the blades and hydrodynamic
loads acting in the tower) to the supporting ground without the soil yielding/failing. The
load on the foundations depends on the chosen foundation system and three distinct cases
are presented:
(a) Single foundation for a grounded system, see Figure 5.26(a) where a monopile is shown.
This system is very similar to mono-caisson or a GBS.
(b) Multiple foundation for a grounded system shown in Figure 5.26(b) where a jacket on
multiple piles is shown.
(c) Foundation for a spar-type floating system shown in Figure 5.27.
The difference between the load transfer processes of single foundations and multiple
foundations is explained in Figure 5.26(a) by taking the example of single large diameter
monopile and multiple piles supporting a jacket. In the case of monopile-supported wind

turbine structures or for that matter any single foundation, the load transfer is mainly
through overturning moments where the monopile/foundation transfers loads to the
surrounding soil, and therefore, it is lateral foundation soil interaction. On the other hand,
for multiple support structure, the load transfer is mainly through push–pull action, that is,
axial load as illustrated in Figure 5.26(b).
Figure 5.27 shows a particular type of floating system known as spar-supported floating
offshore wind turbines with catenary mooring and suction caisson or pile anchors. This is
effectively the example of the Hywind concept, the first floating offshore wind farm. For
foundation design, it is necessary to estimate an upper bound for the ultimate load on the
anchor. This can be obtained by taking the configuration where the mooring line is com￾pletely stretched and there is no part of it lying on the seabed. This is similar to the configu￾ration of a single taut mooring line. In this case, the load is transferred directly to the anchor
without the effect of soil friction on a horizontal section of the mooring line, and the angle
of the mooring line at the seabed is maximal. Figures 5.28 and 5.29 are examples of models
of floating systems for seismic fault rupture of seabed i.e. large movement of the supporting
foundations. Figure 5.29 shows the model of a TLP system.
5.5.2 Modes of vibration
Offshore wind turbines are located in a dynamic environment where there are plenty of
cyclic and dynamic loads. Modes of vibration are also an important design considera￾tion. Vibration characteristics play a significant role in choosing a particular structural
system to support wind turbine generator (WTG), that is, four-legged pile or four-legged
suction caisson. There are mainly two types of vibrations for grounded wind turbines: (i)
Sway-bending (see Figure 5.30) and (ii) Rocking (see Figure 5.31). If the foundation is

stiff/rigid vertically compared to the flexibility of the tower, sway-bending mode is expected.
On the other hand, if the foundation is not sufficiently rigid, rocking modes combined with
flexible modes of tower may occur.
Rocking modes must be avoided at any cost for offshore wind turbine structures as
low-frequency rocking mode may interact with the rotor frequency. There is, therefore, a
requirement of minimum vertical stiffness of suction caissons so that rocking mode does
not occur. Readers are referred to Chapter 3 in Bhattacharya1 for further discussion on
the modes of vibration. Appendix 5.A provides modes of vibrations for different types of
structural systems.
5.5.3 Mechanical model of the whole system
Most of the existing offshore wind turbine structure is supported on monopiles, and
therefore, monopile system is considered for discussion. Monopiles are large steel column
inserted deep into the ground. Essentially, there are two steel columns (Tower and Founda￾tion) joined by another steel column known as transition piece (TP). The tower supports
the rotor, nacelle, landing platforms, electrical, and communication cables. Nacelle houses
the machineries, gearbox, control system and the generators. Typical hub height, Rotor

turbines are listed in Table 5.3. Figures 5.32 and 5.33 shows a mechanical model of a wind

Few points to note:
(1) The wind turbine structure passes through three media: air, water, and ground,
and therefore, any vibrations arising are damped by them. These are termed as
aero-dynamic, hydro-dynamic, and soil damping.
(2) The foundation (the part of the structure under water) is represented by a set of four
uncoupled springs (KL, KR, KLR, and KV) representing the foundation–soil interaction.
For example, KV is the vertical spring and mainly supports the mass of the structure.
These are also known as “macro-elements” or “linearized foundation stiffness”. Tur￾bine engineers need these stiffness values while carrying out simulations to obtain loads.
Appendix 5.B provides definitions of the stiffness terms and reference to closed-form
solutions.

5.5.3.1 Why are foundations important?
(1) Foundations support the loads and provide the stability of the whole system. For
example, the thrust of the blades is applied at the hub level and is ultimately taken by
the springs. Proper analysis and design ensure that whole system will not fail under the
extreme loads. Examples include 1 in 100-year event.
(2) If the springs (KL , KR or KLR) are too soft, they may deform excessively hampering
the operations of the turbine.
(3) Foundation stiffness is also necessary to estimate the natural frequency of the whole
system. Figure 5.33 shows a mechanical model from Arany et al.
11 where the different
variables are shown. Interested readers are referred to Arany et al.
11 and Bhattacharya1
for mathematical formulations of natural frequency of monopile supported wind
turbines.
5.6 Loads on a wind turbine structure
Figure 5.34 shows a schematic diagram of a bottom-fixed wind turbine support structure
with a monopile foundation. The loads exercised on the structure, which are ultimately
be carried to the foundation. There are four main loads apart from the weight of the whole
system and they are wind, wave, and loads due to rotation of the blades (known as 1P load)
and loads on the tower (also known as 2P/3P loads) loads. The loads are described later:
Wind load on the hub. The load produced by the thrust of the wind on the blades and
tower. The cyclic component of the load depends on the turbulence of the wind at that
location (wind speed variation over a period) and turbine operating characteristics.
Wave load. The load caused by waves crashing against the substructure (i.e., the part
of the structure exposed to the wave), the magnitude of which depends on the wave
height and wave period.
1P load. Load caused by the vibration at the hub level due to the mass and aerodynamic
imbalances of the rotor. This load has a frequency equal to the rotational frequency
of the rotor (referred to as 1P loading). Since most of the industrial wind turbines are
variable speed machines, 1P is not a single frequency but a frequency band between the
frequencies associated with the lowest and the highest revolutions per minute (RPM).
The lowest is also known as “cut-in” speed, and the maximum is known as “rated
RPM”. Typical 1P frequencies for different wind turbines are provided by the turbine
manufacturer and depends on the turbine rated power. The range is usually between
5 and 12 RPM.
Blade passing load (2P/3P). Loads in the tower due to the vibrations caused by blade
shadowing effects (referred to as 2P/3P). As the blades of the turbine pass through the
front of the tower, the temporary shadowing effect reduces the thrust on the tower.
Figure 5.34(b) shows the shadowing effect due to two configurations of the blades, and
the differential load on the tower is noted. This is a dynamic load having frequency
equal to three times the rotational frequency of the turbine (3P) for three-bladed wind
turbines. For a 2-bladed turbine, this will be two times (2P) the rotational frequency

of the turbine (1P). The 2P/3P loading is also a frequency band like 1P and is simply
obtained by multiplying the limits of the 1P band by the number of the turbine blades.
5.6.1 Load cases for foundation design
Codes of Practices or Best Practice guide describe hundreds of load cases that need to be ana￾lyzed to ensure the safe operation of wind turbines throughout their lifetime of 20–30 years.
However, in terms of foundation design, not all these cases are significant or relevant. All
design load cases are built as a combination of four wind and four sea states. The wind
conditions are as follows:
(U-1) Normal turbulence scenario: the mean wind speed is the rated wind speed (UR)
where the highest thrust force is expected, and the wind turbulence is modeled by
the normal turbulence model.
(U-2) Extreme turbulence scenario: the mean wind speed is the rated wind speed (UR),
and the wind turbulence is very high, the extreme turbulence model (ETM) is used.
(U-3) Extreme gust at rated wind speed scenario: the mean wind speed is the rated wind
speed (UR), and the 50-year extreme operating gust (EOG) calculated at UR hits
the rotor. The EOG is a sudden change in the wind speed and is assumed to be so
fast that the pitch control of the wind turbine has no time to alleviate the loading.
This assumption is very conservative and is used for simplified foundation design.
(U-4) Extreme gust at cut-out scenario: the mean wind speed is slightly below the cut-out
wind speed of the turbine (Uout), and the 50-year EOG hits the rotor. Due to the
sudden change in wind speed, the turbine cannot shut down.
The wave conditions are as follows:
(W-1) 1-year extreme sea state (ESS): a wave with height equal to the 1-year significant
wave height HS,1 acts on the substructure.
(W-2) 1-year extreme wave height (EWH): a wave with height equal to the 1-year maxi￾mum wave height Hm,1 acts on the substructure.
(W-3) 50-year ESS: a wave with height equal to the 50-year significant wave height HS,50
acts on the substructure.
(W-4) 50-year EWH: a wave with height equal to the 50-year maximum wave height Hm,50
acts on the substructure.
The 1-year ESS and EWH are used as a conservative estimation of the normal wave
height (NWH). It is important to note here in relation to the ESS that the significant
wave height and the maximum wave height have different meanings. The significant wave
height HS is the average of the highest one-third of all waves in the 3-hour sea state, while
the maximum wave height Hm is the single highest wave in the same 3-hour sea state.
According to the relevant standards (IEC12, 13; DNV14), in the probability envelope of envi￾ronmental states, the most severe states with a 50-year return period have to be considered.
Indeed, extreme waves and high wind speeds tend to occur at the same time; however, the
highest load due to wind is not expected when the highest wind speeds occur. This is partly
because the pitch control alleviates the loading above the rated wind speed, but also because

turbines shut down at high wind speeds for safety reasons. Idle or shut-down turbines, as
well as turbines operating close to the cut-out wind speed, have a significantly reduced thrust
force acting on them compared with the thrust force at the rated wind speed.
The highest wind load is expected to be caused by scenario (U-3), and the highest wave
load is due to scenario (W-4). In practice, the 50-year extreme wind load and the 50-year
extreme wave load have a negligible probability to occur at the same time, and the DNV14
code also does not require these extreme load cases to be evaluated together. The designer has
to find the most severe event with a 50-year return period based on the joint probability of
wind and wave loading. Therefore, for the ultimate limit state (ULS) analysis, the following
combinations of wind and wave energies are suggested by Arany et al.
15:
(1) the ETM wind load at rated wind speed combined with the 50-year EWH—the combi￾nation of wind scenario (U-2) and wave scenario (W-4). This will provide higher loads
in deeper water with higher waves.
(2) the 50-year EOG wind load combined with the 1-year maximum wave height. This will
provide higher loads in shallow water in sheltered locations where wind load dominates.
Five load cases important for simplified foundation design are identified and described in
Table 5.4.
These scenarios are somewhat more conservative than those required by standards and can
be adopted for simplified analysis. From the point of view of serviceability limit state (SLS)
and fatigue limit state (FLS), the single largest loading on the foundation is not representa￾tive because the structure is expected to experience this level of loading only once throughout
the lifetime.
The load cases in Table 5.4 are representative of typical foundation loads in a conservative
manner and may serve as the basis for conceptual design of foundations. However, detailed
analysis for design optimization and the final design may require addressing other load cases

as well. These analyses require detailed data about the site (wind, wave, current, geological,
geotechnical, bathymetry data, etc.) and also the turbine (blade profiles, twist and chord
distributions, lift and drag coefficient distributions, control parameters and algorithms, drive
train characteristics, generator characteristics, tower geometry, etc.).
Figure 5.34 shows the time history (wave form) of the main four loads. The salient points of
the loads are discussed here:
(a) Each of these loads has unique characteristics in terms of magnitude, frequency, and
number of cycles applied to the foundation.
(b) The loads imposed by the wind and the wave are random in both space (spatial) and
time (temporal), and therefore, they are often described statistically.

(c) Apart from the random nature, these two loads may also act in two different directions
for a wind turbine structure. The blowing wind above the sea causes waves, and there￾fore, wind and wave are colinear. However, in order to have a steady power output, the
control system often performs yaw action causing wind-wave misalignment.
(d) 1P loading is caused by mass and aerodynamic imbalances of the rotor and the forcing
frequency equals the rotational frequency of the rotor.
(e) On the other hand, 2P/3P loading is caused by the blade shadowing effect, wind shear
(i.e., the change in wind speed with height above the ground), and rotational sampling
of turbulence. Its frequency is simply two or three times the 1P frequency.
The readers are referred to Bhattacharya1 for methods to calculate the loads.
Figure 5.35 shows a simplified representation of the four loads on monopile supported struc￾ture for 1 minute duration. Loads for wind and wave are in Mega Newton (MN) range, and
the loads for 1P and 3P are in kN (kilo Newton) range. Combination of wind and wave pro￾vides the magnitude of the design load and is shown in Figure 5.36. It may be noted that
wind and wave have different time periods. Wave frequency depends on the sea and in the
simplified version the predominant wave frequency can be considered. In the example cho￾sen, the wind has a time period of 100 seconds and wave 10 seconds. Therefore, the combined
wind and wave load is cyclic in nature with minimum (Mmin), maximum (Mmax), and mean
values (Mmean).
The next two figures show examples of loads on the foundation. Figure 5.36b shows a plot
of overturning moment for a 10 MW turbine in 10 m of water depth. Figure 5.36c shows a
3.6 MW turbine in 21.5 m water depths. The load cases used for estimating the moments are

provided in the caption. The figure shows that the overturning moment in the foundation (i.e.
mudline bending moment) can be one-way cyclic (as in Figure 5.35b) or asyymetric two-way
cyclic (as in Figure 5.35c) and depends on the turbine rated power and water depth. Larger
turbines will have longer blades (by extension taller towers) and therefore higher thrust load
when other factors remains constant. Therefore, 10MW turbine will have a higher thrust
than 3.6MW turbine which will lead to higher mudline moment. On the other hand, wind
farm locations will have a good wind speed and wave loads are proportional to water depth.
This explains why 21.5m water depth in Figure 5.35c is different from load pattern in 10m
water depth. The readers are referred to Jalbi et al.16 for a simplified method to predict the
nature of loading on the foundation i.e. whether it is one-way or two cyclic.
5.7 Frequencies of loads acting on wind turbine
structure
Figure 5.36 shows a schematic diagram of the main frequencies of the main loads (wind,
wave, 1P, and 3P) so that the dynamic design constraints can be visualized. Each of the loads
have a frequency range and they are shown in the figure. Wind and wave loads are expressed
through normalised PSD (Power Spectral Density). The formulation for developing wind
and wave spectrum is provided in codes of practices, and an example spectrum is provided in
Appendix 5.C. It is advisable to have the global natural frequency of the whole wind turbine
system apart of the forcing frequencies so that amplification of responses (also known as
dynamic amplification (loosely speaking resonance) can be avoided. Many codes of practices
suggest to have a safety margin on either side of the loading. It is worth noting that resonance
under operational condition has been reported in the German North Sea projects17.
Wind energy is concentrated at low frequencies (typically 100 second time period), and
the wave frequency depends on the sea. Typically, the predominant frequency of wave is

0.1–0.2 Hz. 1P and 3P depend on the operating range of the turbine. These are visualized in
Figure 5.37. An example is shown in the next ASIDE 3 section.
Three design space may be noted in Figure 5.36: soft–soft, soft–stiff, and stiff–stiff. These
terms are essentially concerned based on relative flexibility of the tower with respect to the
foundation and explained schematically in Figures 5.37 and 5.38.
Few points may be noted from the design choices available:
(1) In the “soft–stiff” design, the natural frequency or the resonant frequency is very close
to the upper end of 1P (i.e., frequency corresponding to the rated power of the tur￾bine) and lower bound of the 3P (i.e., cut-in speed of the turbine). This will inevitably
cause vibration of the whole system as the ratio of forcing to natural frequency is very
close to 1.
(2) For a soft–stiff 3 MW WTG system, 1P and 3P loading can be considered as dynamic
(i.e., ratio of the loading frequency to the system frequency very close to 1). Most of the
energy in wind turbulence is in lower frequency variations (typically around 100 second
peak period), which can be considered as cyclic. On the other hand, 1P and 3P dynamic
loads change quickly in comparison to the natural frequency of the WTG system,
and therefore, the ability of the WTG to respond depends on the characteristics, and
dynamic analysis is therefore required.
(3) As a rule of thumb, if the natural frequency of the WTG structure is more than five times
the forcing frequency—the loading can be considered cyclic, and inertia of the system
may be ignored. For example, for a 3 MW wind turbine having a natural frequency

of 0.3 Hz, any load having frequency more than 0.06 Hz is dynamic. Therefore, wave
loading of 0.1 Hz is dynamic.
ASIDE 3: Target frequency for 3 MW turbine in North Sea
The operating range of Vestas V90 3 MW turbine is 8.6–18.4 RPM, and they are shown in
Figure 5.39. Wind load spectrum is based on Kaimal spectrum, and wave load spectrum is
potted using JONSWAP spectrum. Current design aims to place the natural frequency of
the whole system in between the upper bound of 1P and lower bound of 3P in the so-called
“soft–stiff” design. In the plot, the natural frequency of two Vestas V90 3 MW wind turbines
from two wind farms (Kentish Flats and Thanet) are also plotted. Though the turbines are
same, the variation in the natural frequency is due to the different ground and site conditions.
5.8 Design requirements
It is important to highlight the main calculations that are necessary:
(a) Verification ofsafe load transferfrom the superstructure to the supporting ground in the
case of extreme load events. In limit state design philosophy, this is termed as ultimate
limit state (ULS). Essentially satisfying the ULS criteria ensures that the supporting
foundation or the ground does not collapse or the material of the tower/monopile does
not yield.
(b) Predicting the modes of vibration of the adopted structural system, that is, rigid rock￾ing modes or flexible modes or a combination. Modes of vibration dictate the dynamic
response and therefore the deformations and stresses in the materials such as tower or
monopiles. Furthermore, modes of vibration also influence the rotor Nacelle assembly
(RNA) acceleration. In limit state design philosophy, this satisfies fatigue limit state

(FLS) as well as serviceability limit state (SLS). A strict limit of rotation is imposed
on monopile supported wind turbines. Figure 5.40 provides plausible reasons for such
stricter rotational limits, which includes increased foundation loads, and wear and tear
of bearings. Wind turbine structures are subjected to millions of cycles of repeated load￾ing (due to wind, wave, 1P, and 2P/3P), and there are many welded joints in the whole
structure. Welded joint arises during the fabrication of tower or monopile from a steel
sheet. Therefore, fatigue of the material is a problem, and cracks initiation must be
under control and which is ensured through FLS criteria. Fatigue damage at a crack
initiation location is affected by potential flaws such as initial defects, stress concen￾tration, incomplete weld root penetration (weld defect), number of wave-induced stress
range cycles, corrosion, and performance of coatings. This also shows the importance
of operation and maintenance (O & M) of wind turbine systems.
(c) Long-term deformation so that SLS requirements (example rotation of the founda￾tions) are not violated under the combined actions of wind and wave. Table 5.5 shows
some typical criteria for design of wind turbine structure.
(d) Long-term change in dynamic characteristics (i.e., change in natural frequency and
damping) of the whole system due to millions of cycles of loading. This change can be
driven by various changes such as scour depth, change in ground properties supporting
the foundations due to cycles of loading, and corrosion of the materials. This also
satisfies SLS and FLS.

5.9 Summary of offshore wind turbine engineering
Offshore environments present diverse met ocean (wind and the wave climate) and geological
conditions. Examples of geological conditions are stiff clay and sand in European seas, soft
clay layered deposits in Chinese seas, chalk in the English Channel, and carbonate deposits.
Although existing offshore wind farms have been constructed mainly in soft clay, stiff clays,
and sand deposits, future projects are likely to be deployed in more challenging geological
conditions (soft rocks in shallow seabed, carbonate soils, and liquefiable soils) for which
prior experience is limited.
This chapter shows the layout of various offshore wind farm around the world explaining the
reason behind such layout. The different constraints while designing these are also discussed
together will example layouts. This chapter also provides an overview of the range of data
required for carrying out design. The different types of loads that the offshore wind turbine
structure experience are described together with the salient features. Engineering models
that are needed for carrying out various calculations are discussed together with the design
criteria.
Appendix 5.A: Modes of vibrations

the tower is rock-socketed. The formula can be obtained from standard dynamics textbook.
A list of vibration formulas can be found in Varghese et al.

Appendix 5.B: Foundation stiffness
In the mechanical model shown in Figure 5.32, the foundation is represented by a set of four
springs:
KL (Lateral stiffness), that is, lateral load needed for unit deflection having units of MN/m.
225

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseOnshore and Offshore Wind Energy
KR (Rotational stiffness), that is, moment needed for unit rotation having units of MNm/rad.
KLR (Cross-coupling spring), that is, moment required for unit deflection having unit of MN.
KV (Vertical spring), that is, vertical load needed for unit settlement having units of MN/m.
The formulas for different types of foundations are provided in Tables 5.B.1 to 5.B.4.
5.B.1 Definition of terms (KL, KR, and KLR) through the example of
a cantilever beam
The stiffness terms are defined though the example of a cantilever beam. Two cases are con￾sidered here: (a) concentrated load at the free end, see Figure 5.B.1, and (b) moment at the
free end, see Figure 5.B.2.
KL =Lateral load required for unit deflection, that is, when 𝛿max =1, P is the lateral stiffness,
see Figure 5.B.1.
KL = 3EI
L3
KLR = Lateral load required for unit rotation (when 𝜃 =1, P is the cross-coupling stiffness),
see Figure 5.B.1
KLR = 2EI
L2
KR = Moment required for unit rotation: KR= EI
L
KRL = Moment required for unit deflection = KLR= 2EI
L2
The above example is for a cantilever beam fixed at the bottom. However, foundations are
surrounded by soil and the bottom of the foundation may not be fixed to the ground. There￾fore, obtaining stiffness is complex and is dependent of soil properties as well. Many closed
form formulations are available for obtaining stiffness of different types of foundations.

Appendix 5.C: Construction of wind and wave spectrum
5.C.1 Construction of wind spectrum
Turbulence of wind is usually estimated as a fluctuating wind speed component (u) super￾imposed on the mean wind speed U, and therefore, the total wind speed can be written as
U = U + u. The degree of turbulence is usually characterized by the turbulence intensity I,
given by Equation (C.1) later
I = 𝜎U ∕U (C.1)
where 𝜎U is the standard deviation of wind speed around the mean U (which is usually taken
over 10 minutes). The turbulence intensity varies with mean wind speed, with site location,
and with surface roughness and is also modified by the turbine itself.
Taylor21 states in his frozen turbulence hypothesis that the characteristics of eddies can
be considered constant (frozen) in time, and vortices travel with the mean horizontal
wind speed, see Figure 5.C.1. This assumption is found to be acceptable for wind turbine
applications, and the turbulence is usually analyzed in the frequency domain by a power
spectral density (PSD) function, which describes the contribution of different frequencies
to the total variance of the wind speed.

Eddy Eddy
Figure 5.C.1 Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis: an eddy travels with the mean wind speed while its size and character￾istic parameters remain constant.
The frequency of turbulence is connected to the size of eddies. A larger eddy means
low-frequency variation in wind speed, while smaller vortices induce short, high-frequency
wind-speed variations. If the characteristic size of an eddy is d(m) and it travels with U(m∕s)
speed, the travel time through the rotor in 𝜏 = d∕U time. The frequency connected to this
time period is f = 1/𝜏 (Hz).
Through this, the length scale and time scale of turbulence can be connected. The typical
length scales of high energy-containing large turbulent eddies are in the range of several
kilometers. The large eddies tend to decay to smaller and smaller eddies with higher fre￾quencies as turbulent energy dissipates to heat. Kolmogorov’s law describing this process
states that the asymptotic limit of the spectrum is f −5/3 at high frequency.
There are two families of spectra commonly used in wind energy applications: the von Kár￾mán and the Kaimal spectra. The main difference is that the Kaimal spectrum is somewhat
less peaked, and the energy is contained in a bit wider frequency range. Kaimal spectrum is
more suitable for modeling the atmospheric boundary layer, and the von Kármán spectrum
is better for wind tunnel modeling. DNV suggests the Kaimal spectrum.

where Lk is the integral length scale (formula available in the DNV code). Based on the DNV
code, Lk = 5.67z for z<60 m and Lk = 340.2 m for z≥60 m where z denotes the height above
sea level.

f is the frequency,
U is the mean wind speed (from site measurements),
and 𝜎U is the standard deviation of wind speed.
These can be estimated from measurements or calculated using Equation (C.2), and turbu￾lence intensity values may be obtained from standards IEC 61400-1 and IEC 61400-3.
5.11 Construction of wave spectrum
The wind blowing over the sea generates wind waves because of the increased pressure on
the free surface of water. First, small waves are produced with high frequency and low wave
height, and the energy is gradually transferred toward the higher amplitude waves with lower
frequency and longer wavelength. The developing sea state depends on many factors, includ￾ing but not limited to the water depth, the shape of the sea bottom, the mean wind speed,
and the fetch. The latter is the typical leeward distance to shore considering the prevailing
wind direction. The dependence on the water depth is apparent from the dispersion relation:
𝜔2 = gk tanh(kS)
where 𝜔[rad/s] is the angular frequency, k = 2𝜋/𝜆[1/m] is the wave number with 𝜆(m) being the wavelength, and S(m) is the mean sea depth.
Any offshore location consists of a large number of waves with various frequencies and
wavelengths. The importance of each frequency is characterized by the power associated
with it, which can be represented by the PSD function. The PSD can be produced from
site measurements of the wave height using discrete Fourier transform, or alternatively the
JONSWAP spectrum Sww(f) suggested by many codes such as DNV:

5.3 One 10 MW turbine gives the same power output as two 5 MW turbines. Develop a
layout for a 120 MW wind farm in a location where monopile is the foundation and
the center of the wind farm is 40 km offshore with two options 5 and 10 MW. Compare
the amount of steel and cables and time to construct. You need to simplify the problem
and make assumptions by studying the existing operating wind farms.
5.4 A developer wishes to develop a wind farm with Vestas V164-8.0MW turbines capable
of producing 8.0 MW, and the rotor diameter is 164 m. The site is North Sea with peak
wave period of 10 seconds. The developer wishes to operate the turbine is 5–12 RPM,
the site is moderately turbulent (18% turbulent intensity), and the average wind speed
is 8 m/s. Sketch the range of frequencies acting on the system. Suggest a target natural
frequency of the whole system.
5.5 A developer wishes to support a 8 MW turbine on monopiles and ground immediately
below the mudline is medium dense sand and extends to about 30 m. The height of the
tower is 100 m above water level, and the water depth is 25 m. Approximate calculation
shows that the highest load at the hub level due to the wind load corresponds to 50 year
extreme operational gust loading and has been estimated to be 2.5 MN. The wave load
corresponding to EWH is estimated to be 2.8 MN and can be assumed to act at mean
sea level. The certifier of the wind farm imposes 0.5∘ maximum rotation at the mudline
level. What is the minimum rotational foundation stiffness required?
5.6 For the given offshore wind, the ground is uniform medium dense sand having the fol￾lowing properties: [Young’s modulus of 40 MPa and Φ’ (friction angle = 33 (degrees)
and saturated density (𝛾′
) of 8 (KN/m3). Using any simplified method, estimate the
stiffness of a 6 m diameter monopile with an embedded length of 30 m. The wall thick￾ness of the monopile can be assumed to be 40 mm.
5.7 The developer in Problems 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 wishes to install the 8 MW turbine in a
seismic location. 6 m diameter monopile foundation is used with an embedment depth
of 30 m. It is estimated that 5 m of soil will liquefy. Predict the change in natural fre￾quency of the system. The ground is same as Problem 6 [Young’s modulus of 40 MPa
and Φ’ (friction angle = 33 (degrees) and saturated density (𝛾′
) of 8 (KN/m3)]. Make
assumptions for tower dimensions and RNA mass for 8 MW turbine.
Hint: As the ground is liquefied 5 m, the tower is now elongated by 5 m. The monopile
is now embedded 25 m instead of 30 m.
5.8 A 5 MW turbine supported on a symmetrical four-legged jacket in deep waters, as
shown in figure later. It is proposed to use 4 m diameter and 4 m length caisson as
a foundation. The ground underneath is homogeneous stratum over bedrock with
Young’s modulus of 40 MPa. Details about the turbine specification and jacket dimen￾sions are given in Table 5.6. Details on the foundation are given in Table 5.7.
a) Estimate the vertical stiffness of the caisson.
b) Make a prediction on whether the system will have rocking mode of vibration or
sway bending mode of vibration.

Answers to questions
Q5.1 Increasing the size of the turbine decreases the cost per unit of electricity generated.
The reasons are
(c) Power output is proportional to the square of blade length, that is, a small
increase in blade length leads to a large increase in power output.
(d) Longer blades require a higher hub height, which provides more consistent wind
speed.
(e) Installation costs are relatively lower due to a smaller number of locations.
However, designing big turbines is challenging. Figure 5.41 compares 1P and 3P
frequency range of a range of turbines. They are compared with wind and wave
frequency.However, installation gets challenging and requires specialist vessels, that
is, heavy Lift.
Q5.2 Onshore turbines are limited in size due to lack of transport infrastructure (roads
and vehicles for transportation) and installation cranes. Offshore turbine compo￾nents can be directly transported to the location using vessels.
Q5.3 The steps are shown in Figure 5.43.
Q5.4 The loads are wind, wave, 1P, and 3P. Wind is mostly cyclic loading causing fatigue
types of issues. 1P, 3P, and wave are dynamic.
Q5.5 This depends on the bottom fixed or floating; see the text for answers.
Q5.6 Survey the locations of foundation for turbines and substation and the cable laying
locations.
Q5.7 Apart from the requirement of ULS, that is, material does not yield under loading,
there is also need to look into the driving stresses. How they will be installed?
Q5.8 Bottom fixed have more stringent rotation and deflection criteria.

Q5.9 As the turbines gets larger, the target frequency is lower and will impact the wave
frequency. Therefore, wave loads get dynamic.
Q5.10 East Coast water depth is shallow and therefore bottom fixed. On the other hand,
West Coast is deeper water and therefore floating.

6 Operations and maintenance (O&M)
6.1 Introduction
Wind turbines (WT) must be reliable for wind energy to become a major constituent in a
much-needed transition from fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy systems. Oper￾ation and maintenance (O&M) systems and procedures are of paramount importance in
ensuring the reliability of WT operation, while O&M data analysis can guide design and
construction improvements. The first step in improving wind turbine reliability is to accu￾rately determine the criticalities of WT and define factors affecting reliability and associ￾ated level of impact. Compilation and analysis of historical O&M data are required as a
basis of reliability and availability analyses that combines prediction of potential failures
with preventive measures for minimizing failures. To the extent that failures of WT are
unpredictable, the uncertainty poses great risks associated with loss of energy production
and loss of asset. When criticalities and factors affecting WT reliabilities are quantitatively
assessed, then design improvements, operations scheduling, condition monitoring, and spare
parts management can be done accordingly, and uncertainty can be reduced. O&M of off￾shore installations carry additional risks due to accessibility and operations dependence on
weather conditions.
The advancement of the sector requires a strategic O&M implementation that will enhance
availability, optimize profit, and minimize downtime. The O&M costs consist of failed com￾ponents prices, personnel costs, crew and components transfer, and fixed cost such as fees
and insurance. Turbine O&M costs represent the single largest component of overall OPEX
and a major constituent (e.g., up to 30%) of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).1 In addi￾tion, the cost of lost energy production during maintenance and repair downtime further
increases the LCOE. Therefore, wind energy professionals need tools to predict time to fail￾ure, time to repair and cost for failures for WT. This chapter offers a review of the literature
on wind turbine failures, a statistical analysis of failure data to understand the mechanisms
and components associated with expected failures, and a review of methodologies for study￾ing and improving reliability of wind turbine operations.

6.2 Maintenance practices and tools
Maintenance practices for WT can be characterized as preventive and corrective. Preventive
maintenance can be defined as scheduled maintenance and condition-based maintenance.
Scheduled maintenance is done upon recommended intervals by wind turbine manufac￾turers, and it is generally done on 6-month intervals for onshore WT. Condition-based
maintenance requires a condition monitoring system (CMS) involving an extra investment
cost, but it is more likely to prevent unexpected high failure costs, as compared to just
scheduled maintenance. Corrective maintenance is, on the other hand, done upon a failure
which requires repair or replacement.
There are several condition monitoring techniques that can be used in scheduled mainte￾nance as well as in condition-monitoring-based maintenance; these are listed below:
■ Performance monitoring is used as wind turbine condition monitoring (e.g., monitor￾ing of power in association to wind speed and direction, rotor blade angle and rotor
speed).
■ Visual inspection.
■ Ultrasonic testing techniques (UTTs) are applied on wind turbine towers and rotor
blades to determine surface and subsurface structural deterioration.
■ Acoustic emission employing transducers and optic fiber displacement sensors to
detect faults in gearboxes, bearings, shafts, and blades.
■ Thermography used for detecting hot spots in electrical and electronic equipment as
well as rotor blades by using infrared cameras.
■ Radiographic inspection using X-ray imaging for revealing tight delamination or
cracks in a wind turbine component.
The main detection methods for wind turbine condition examination are:
■ Vibration analysis (VA) applied to WT components such as shafts, bearings, and rotor
blades and subsystems such as gearbox.
■ Oil analysis (OA) applied to determine the quality of oil inside a wind turbine gearbox
whether there is debris contaminant because of a damage in bearings and gearings in
a gearbox.
■ Strain measurement (SM) applied mostly to wind turbine blades by using strain gauges
to quantify stress level in situ and forecast lifetime.
■ Electrical effects applied to electrical equipment such as motors, generators, and accu￾mulators in a wind turbine.
■ Shock pulse method (SPM) used to detect damages in a bearing using transducers by
reading the signals.
6.3 Wind turbine O&M data
In wind farm O&M practice, historical failure events can be recorded from CMSs, supervi￾sory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, failure reports, and maintenance logs.

failure rate, which is the failure frequency given by the number of failures per turbine per unit
time, and downtime per failure, which is given as the time during which a turbine does not
produce power output due to a failure. Thus, the failure rate 𝜆i of subassembly i, estimated
as the number f failures per turbine per year, can be determined by the below equations 2
:
𝜆i =
∑P
p=1 ni,p
∑P
p=1 Np(Tp∕8760)
, (6.1)
where ni,p is the number of failures of subassembly i in period p, Np is the number of WTs
considered in period p, and Tp is the time duration of period p in hours. The failure rate of
the entire wind farm is calculated as the sum of the failure rates of all its subassemblies:
𝜆 =
∑I
i=1
∑P
p=1 ni,p
∑P
p=1 Np(Tp∕8760)
(6.2)
where l is the total number of subassemblies in the turbine. The numerator of Equation (6.2)
represents the total number of failures of the turbine, and the denominator represents the
total number of turbine years within the survey.
Similarly to the failure statistics, the downtime estimates are either average calculated down￾time per failure for each subassembly Di
, or total downtime in a certain interval. The calcu￾lation of Di is shown in Equation (6.3).
Di =
∑P
p=1 Di,p
∑P
p=1 ni,p
, (6.3)
where DI,p is the total downtime due to failures of subassembly I in period p. The numer￾ator of Equation (6.3) is the total downtime caused by failures of subassembly i, and the
denominator is the total number of failures in the entire duration of a database.
The reliability data, including failure rate and downtime, are critical for the design, oper￾ation, maintenance, and performance assessment of WTs but are often difficult to obtain;
that is why we devote a good fraction of this chapter in the analysis of such data.
6.3.1 Onshore WT O&M data
The earliest comprehensive O&M survey is the “Wissenschaftliches Mess- und
Evaluierungsprogramm” (WMEP), which included wind turbine operations in Ger￾many between 1989 and 2008. This survey included all scheduled and unscheduled
maintenance logs for 1500 onshore turbines with 64,000 individual events. Figure 6.1 shows
the failure rate and downtime values for a subset of 575 turbines from the WMEP database
for which complete log data were available.3 For a schematic of the associated components
see Figure 1.13. As shown, electric and control systems had by far higher failure rates than
the rest of the subsystems whereas hub, control system, and rotor blades have the highest
downtime values (Table 6.1).
Pfaffel et al.4 added data on the WMEP analysis by reviewing WT O&M surveys around the
world. They showed failure rate and downtime results from the CIRCE database with 13,000

operational years and WMEP with 15,357 operational years databases from Germany, and
the VTT Finish database. It is noted that although every initiative has its own data collec￾tion, there is always the possibility of overlapping data sets, especially among the databases
that correspond to the same geographical region. As shown in Figure 6.2, except for Univer￾sity Nanjing database, the rest of the databases show similar results for both failure rate and
downtime of WT. The rotor system is usually the most frequently failed subsystem followed
by the transmission and control systems. For the downtime, the highest values are mostly
for drive train system followed by rotor and transmission systems.4
The high failure rate (47 failures per WT and year) shown by the University Nanjing data
is more than 100 times as high as the lowest failure rate (0.4) shown by the Elforsk/Vindstat
data. On the other hand the University Nanjing data show the lowest mean down time per
failure (0.18 days per failure) which is just 3.3% of the Elforsk/Vindstat mean down time
(5.4 days per failure). These differences are mainly due to the different sources and differ￾ent consideration of events of these initiatives. Comparing the total annual downtime as

the product of failure rate and mean down time, downtime numbers vary between 2.2 and
10.6 days per year.
Accordingly, availability is estimated to be as high as 97–99% in the inland WT best cases
(Figure 6.3).
Sheng also reports availability of about 98% and mean time between failures (MTBFs) of
more than 7000 hours, implying a failure rate of a little over 1 failure(s)/turbine per year for
most modern land-based WT.5
It is noted that the Lynette database which shows a low time-based availability of 80% is
35 years old. Another low estimate (83%) is derived by the Muppandal database, but the
same database shows a technical availability of 94%; this shows the significance of availability
definitions. Let us examine these definitions:
Time-based availability provides information on the share of time where a WT is oper￾ating or able to operate in comparison to the total time. Various definitions for the
calculation of time based availability exist in the wind sector. The definition used in
these results shown in this figure follows the “System Operational Availability” of the
IEC 61400-25-1 Standard where all times of full and partial performance and low
wind conditions are considered as available.
On the other hand, technical availability is a variation of the time-based availability which
gives information on the share of time where a WT is available from a local perspec￾tive. For this purpose, down time with external causes like grid failures or lightning is
considered as available and scheduled maintenance and associated forced shutdown
are excluded from the calculation.
A third definition of WT availability, energetic availability, also known as production￾based availability, gives an indication about the turbine’s energy yield compared to the
potential output and thereby includes long down time during high wind speed phases
and derated operation. Thus, all differences between potential and actual production
are assumed to be losses. The estimation of energetic availability requires wind speed
data.

Due to harsher environmental conditions and more difficult accessibility, offshore WT tends
to have lower availability than onshore ones; an 80–92% availability is shown in Figure 6.4.
The time-based availability based on the SPARTA and WInD-Pool data are almost the
same. The low availability of the offshore WF is caused by major technical problems during
the first years of this first offshore tender in the UK. It can be assumed that these prob￾lems have now been overcome and the results of WInD-Pool and Sparta, showing ∼92%
availability, are more representative of the current situation.
6.3.2 Offshore WT O&M data
Data on off-shore WT failure are scarce, but offshore wind turbine life costing analyses show
that O&M costs can represent up to more than 30% of the total costs of WT throughout their
life.6 Furthermore, turbine blades along with the gearbox and electrical generators have been
identified as the components with the greater failure rates of the turbines. In contrast with
gearboxes, electrical generators, and other components, where the use of condition monitor￾ing is much more mature and is currently implemented in some turbines, the blades are rarely
instrumented, and their inspections and maintenance are usually calendar based, which cre￾ates an opportunity for improvement on their reliability and life extension by switching to
condition-based types of maintenance.
6.3.3 Onshore and offshore O&M data analysis
A recent wind turbine reliability data review2 included data from 18 databases with
18,000 WTs, corresponding to over 90,000 turbine-years of which four of the databases a
totaling 1551 WTs correspond to 3300 turbine-years of offshore operation in European
coasts. This section is based entirely on this source. Their findings associated to onshore
WT are like those based on the WMP database that were shown earlier. Thus, subassemblies
exhibiting higher average failure rates are the electrical, control system, pitch system, blades,

and hub, whereas subassemblies like blakes, shafts and bearings, nacelle, and structure
exhibit low average failure rates. A comparison between onshore and offshore WT reliabil￾ity, although is based on a few data offshore WT, is instructive of the risks experienced in
the emerging offshore wind market.
Two populations of onshore and offshore WTs are analyzed simultaneously to identify the
similarities and differences. The top five critical subassemblies in onshore WTs in order of
significance are electrical, control system, blades and hub, pitch, and generator (Figure 6.5).
These subassemblies are also critical in offshore wind turbines (OWTs), but the order of
criticality is slightly different. The pitch system is the most critical subassembly in offshore
data sources, appearing in three of the four offshore sources, while the generator is critical in
two of the four sources. The electric system, control system, blades and hub, and yaw system
appear to be critical in terms of failure rates for both onshore and offshore WTs.
The critical subassemblies in terms of downtime are presented in Figure 6.6. Although there
are some discrepancies in the average downtime per failure between sources, the criticality
ranking of subassemblies in terms of downtime is quite consistent for both onshore and

offshore populations. Failures of the gearbox, generator, and blades and hub result in the
largest downtimes per failure for both onshore and offshore WTs.
Figure 6.7 shows onshore and offshore failure rates; the onshore failure rates are determined
from 12 onshore data sources, whereas the offshore failure rates are from a single data source.
As shown in this figure, the failure rates for offshore WTs are generally higher than those for
onshore WTs, and this applies to almost all subassemblies. Electrical, control system, genera￾tor, blades and hub, and pitch systems all experience high failure rates for both populations, and
their average failure rates are higher offshore than onshore. Structure and gearbox subassem￾blies follow the same pattern, but their failure rates are outside the top five highest failure
rate subassemblies. The two interesting and irregular subassemblies are the yaw system and
sensors which have higher failure rates onshore than offshore.
When individual subassembly data are combined, the offshore WT failure rate is roughly three
times the weighted average onshore WT failure rate. The difference between onshore and
offshore failure rates can partly be explained by the offshore severe operating conditions,
such as higher mean wind speed and corrosive saltwater. Under the effects of the marine
environment, offshore WT structure is subjected to a larger loading variation in high wind
speeds. Thus, the failure rates of many major subassemblies such as blades and hub, gearbox,
generator, structure, and electrical components of offshore WTs are higher than those of
onshore WTs. In addition, larger WTs tend to experience more failures compared with small
ones, so it should be noted that part of the difference may be due to the larger size/power
rating of the offshore WTs than the onshore average in the databases.
The onshore stop rates shown in Figure 6.8 are calculated from two databases, CREW
(USA) and East China, and the offshore stop rates are from the Noordzee Wind database.
We observe that the subassembly stop rates are much higher than their failure rates from

other sources and, although the failure rates for offshore subassemblies are higher than
those for onshore subassemblies, the stop rate comparison shows a different trend. Almost
all subassemblies, except control and yaw systems, experience higher stop rates in the
onshore population. Control system, yaw, and rotor are the high stop-rate subassemblies
offshore, while rotor, gearbox, generator, and hydraulic are the high stop rate subassemblies
onshore.
Figure 6.9 compares the stop time per event (the duration that a turbine does not generate
power due to its stops) based on onshore and offshore data sources which report alarm event
rates. For a given subassembly, the average stop time per event for offshore WTs is generally
higher than that for onshore WTs. Across all subassemblies, on average, stop events last
3.9 hours onshore while offshore events last 7.7 hours. Accessibility is likely to be a reason
behind this difference. Also, there are two particular subassemblies, gearbox and generator,
which are associated with very high stop times in offshore WTs.
The offshore WT population in this comparison is on the Egmond aan Zee Wind Farm,
where there was a manufacturer’s fault that caused gearbox failure in almost all the turbines,
thereby skewing the data. This gearbox failure propagated to the generator and caused the
generator to fail, which is shown by the spikes in Figure 6.9. However, even without this
unusual gearbox failure, the stop rates of major subassemblies, such as the electrical and
rotor, are higher offshore than onshore. However, it is noted that there is only one offshore
data source in the downtime/stop time comparison and that the population of offshore WTs
is much smaller than that of onshore WT.
Thus, the offshore wind industry needs to further improve component reliability and to
develop and apply O&M strategies to reduce the LCOE that is produced from WT.

6.3.4 The impact of O&M on the LCOE
As detailed in Chapter 8, the LCOE is the net present value (NPV) of the cost to pro￾duce electricity over a WT’s lifetime based on the expected power generated. It includes
all the life-cycle costs of the turbine that can be classified into two groups: capital invest￾ment expenditure (CAPEX) and operation and maintenance expenditure (OPEX). CAPEX
includes the cost of the turbine, infrastructure, installation, and other upfront costs for wind
farm development, deployment, and commissioning. OPEX covers all the costs to operate
and maintain the turbine such as leases, insurance, administration, management, scheduled
maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, spare parts, and other day-to-day operation costs.
6.3.4.1 Land-based WT
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has compiled O&M cost data for 202
installed wind power projects, totaling 22,393 MW with commercial operation dates from
1982 to 2020.7 This section of the book is entirely based on this LBNL report. It is noted that
a full time series of O&M cost data, by year, is available for only a small number of projects,
whereas in most cases, O&M data are available for just a subset of years of project opera￾tions. In most cases, the reported values include the costs of wages and materials associated
with operating and maintaining the wind project, as well as rent. Other ongoing expenses,
including general and administrative expenses, taxes, property insurance, depreciation, and
workers’ compensation insurance are generally not included. As such, the O&M cost data
shown in Figures 6.10 and 6.11 may not represent the total operating expenses for wind
power projects.
The data shown in these figures indicate that O&M costs are not uniform across projects.
However, as shown in Figure 6.10, projects installed in the past decade have, on average,
incurred lower O&M costs than those installed earlier. Specifically, capacity-weighted

increase as turbines age and component failures become more common and (ii) projects
installed more recently, with larger and more mature turbines and more sophisticated O&M
practices, may experience lower overall O&M costs.6
Limitations in the underlying data do not permit the influence of these two factors to be
clearly distinguished. Nonetheless, to help illustrate key trends, Figure 6.11 shows median
annual O&M costs over time, based on project age (i.e., the number of years since the
commercial operation date) and segmented into three project-vintage groupings. Though
sample size is limited, the data show a general upward trend in project-level O&M costs
as projects age, at least among the oldest projects in the sample. Figure 6.11 also shows
that projects installed over the past 15 years have had, in general, lower O&M costs
than those installed in the earlier years of 1998–2005, at least for the first 15 years of
operation.
6.3.4.2 Offshore wind turbines
Compared with an onshore WT, an offshore WT requires a higher initial investment and
expectantly higher O&M costs due the harsh environment where they operate. During the
construction phase, unfavorable weather can result in the delay of the commissioning date
due to lack of accessibility of installation vessels. During the operation phase, in the occur￾rence of a failure, weather-related risks can increase the total downtime of the wind farm
by impeding the access of the support vessels dispatched to perform maintenance activities,
leading to revenue losses.8
However, offshore WT are typically larger than the land-based ones, and this reduces balance
of system and O&M costs on a per-kilowatt basis. Also, the higher wind speeds that offshore
access result in higher electricity production and may offset the higher O&M and installation
costs associated with distance to shore and harsh meteorological conditions.
The cost of O&M adds to the LCOE and unexpected O&M components can make wind
energy less competitive. The frequency and intensity of unpredictable failures can be reduced
by building more robust and condition resilient WT at areas with well-established failure
causes.
Although the LCOE in offshore wind generation has decreased recently, it is still much
higher compared with onshore wind generation. As reported by Lazard (2023), the LCOE
of off-shore WT is $86/MWh versus $26-$54/MWh for land-based WT.
However, this is a big improvement from 2015 prices when off-shore wind was three times
more expensive than land-based wind ($181/MWh versus $61.MWh). Reducing LCOE is
critical in making the offshore wind industry more competitive. Together with the improve￾ment of turbine design and technology to reduce CAPEX, optimizing O&M strategy is
essential to OPEX reduction and ultimately to LCOE optimization.
To reduce O&M costs associated with WT and drive down LCOE, the use of differ￾ent strategies is important. For example, O&M of offshore WT can be inhibited by
accessing difficulties resulting in cost increases. Traditionally, boats are used in carrying
out crews for inspection, repair, and maintenance of OWTs. However, the use of heli￾copters can be beneficial because it reduces the travel time and the associated downtime
(Figure 6.12).

6.4 Statistical tools of reliability analysis
Statistical tools can be used to assess wind turbine reliability, availability, and failure costs
considering environmental and operational factors. Such tools can assist wind turbine man￾ufacturers for design decisions, wind farm operators for O&M activities and also inform
other stakeholders such as insurance companies, government officials, and wind turbine
researchers. Specifically, statistical tools such as failure modes, effect, and criticality anal￾ysis (FMECA), clustering and survival analyses, and Bayesian updating can reveal failure
and downtime behaviors of WT, subsystems, and components depending on the operational
and environmental conditions, and, thus, inform the wind energy community about expected
wind turbine reliabilities and availabilities. Machine learning applications such as logistic

used as decision support tools. FMECA will be applied to evaluate criticalities of wind tur￾bine subsystems and determine the failure and downtime behavior of components in critical
subsystems, cluster and survival analyses will assess factors effecting wind turbine reliability,
and LR and ANN models will model and predict wind turbine reliability. Modeling with LR
and ANN methods can be done using statistical analysis software. Bayesian updating can
be used to predict time to failure and time to repair probabilities, and ANNs can be used to
develop a decision support tool to forecast failure cost of WT considering operational and
environmental conditions.
6.4.1 Failure modes, effect, and criticality analysis (FMECA)
FMECA consists of four main components such as failure modes, failure causes, effects of
the failures, and failure mode criticality numbers. Failure modes represent the type of failure
occurring in every subsystem, whereas failure mechanisms are the causes that lead to failures.
Effects of the failures are simply consequences, whereas failure mode criticality numbers are
calculated as sum of expected cost from the failures and loss of energy production for every
subsystem.
6.4.1.1 Failure modes
Failure modes can be classified as the failures which happen in the specific subsystem (i.e.,
blade failure, gearbox failure, and generator failure), or more specific ones such as fatigue
and fractures in the toothed shaft of a gearbox, loss of function in the lubricant system
depending on the data availability. The database which is used in this study does not include
detailed data about the failure modes beyond the subsystem where the failure occurred.
6.4.1.2 Failure causes
Table 6.2 shows failure causes in the WMEP database. They are high wind, grid failure,
lightning, icing, malfunction of control systems, component wear or failure, loosening of
parts, other causes, and unknown causes. Grid failures in the WMEP database are assumed
to occur only if there is a systematic grid failure and are not part of this investigation.
Hurricane and its category is detailed in Table 6.3.

Table 6.3 Definition of Hurricane.
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale
Climatology | Names | Wind Scale | Extremes | Models | Breakpoints
The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1–5 rating based only on a hurricane’s maximum sustained
wind speed. This scale does not take into account other potentially deadly hazards such as storm
surge, rainfall flooding, and tornadoes.
The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale estimates potential property damage. While all hurricanes
produce life-threatening winds, hurricanes rated Category 3 and higher are known as major
hurricanes.a)Major hurricanes can cause devastating to catastrophic wind damage and significant loss of
life simply due to the strength of their winds. Hurricanes of all categories can produce deadly storm surge,
rain-induced floods, and tornadoes. These hazards require people to take protective action, including
evacuating from areas vulnerable to storm surge.
Category Sustained winds Types of damage due to hurricane winds
1 74–95 mph
64–82 kt
119–153 km/h
Very dangerous winds will produce some damage:
well-constructed: frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles,
vinyl siding, and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and
shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power
lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few
to several days.
2 96–110 mph
83–95 kt
154–177 km/h
Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage:
well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding
damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted
and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with
outages that could last from several days to weeks.
3
(major)
111–129 mph
96–112 kt
178–208 km/h
Devastating damage will occur: well-built framed homes may incur
major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many
trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads.
Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks
after the storm passes.
4
(major)
130–156 mph
113–136 kt
209–251 km/h
Catastrophic damage will occur: well-built framed homes can
sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or
some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and
power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate
residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months.
Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
5
(major)
157 mph or higher
137 kt or higher
252 km/h or higher
Catastrophic damage will occur: a high percentage of framed
homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse.
Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. power
outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will
be uninhabitable for weeks or months.s

6.4.1.3 Failure effects
Failure effects can be classified in the same way as failure causes which are given in
Table 6.2. For example, we can consider the following effects of failures: overspeed,
overload, noise, vibration, reduced power, causing follow-up damage, plant stoppage, and
other consequences.

6.4.1.4 Criticality of failure modes
Criticality priority number (CPN) is the one of the most important outcomes of an FMECA
application. CPN is estimated as follows:
Criticality Priority Number = Occurrence Severity ∗ Consequence Severity
∗ Nondetection Severity (6.4)
Ozturk and Fthenakis applied FMECA on the WMEP data.9 Their study has four method￾ological dimensions, namely: (i) obtaining reliability and availability metrics for an identical

The most critical components in the generator subsystem are bearings; gearbox parts are
the most affected components in every climatic region, followed by seals in gearbox fail￾ures. Wear is the dominant failure cause. Bearing failures have the noise and vibration effect
following plant stoppage predominantly in the Dfc climatic region.
The highest failed component in the electric system is switches. The dominant cause is wear
in all climatic regions. Rotor blade failures seem to be affected by the cold climatic region.
Dfc climatic regions have an impact on the critical subsystems and cause failure in WT.
This implies that the wind turbine operations and maintenance strategies for subsystems
should be arranged taking into account of local climatic conditions of the turbines. For
example, rotor blade downtimes and failure rates are impacted by colder climates, where
longer downtime and higher failure rates are observed. Also, lightning became an important
failure cause in cold climatic regions for rotor blade failures.
It is expected that most of the equipment failures would give malfunctioning signals about
the potential for equipment malfunction. CMSs enable the detection of the failures in
wind turbine subsystems such as gearbox, drive train, generator, and tower by the use
of vibration, heat, and pressure sensors. In WT, however, failures often appear suddenly
and cannot be detected. Visual inspection, checking the lubrication level in gearboxes,
VA, and nondestructive testing methods, which include ultrasound and acoustic emissions
in scheduled maintenance, are also other ways to detect potential anomalies in a wind
turbine.
6.4.2 Logistic regression (LR)
LR is a machine learning method which examines the relationship between binary outcomes
(dependent variable) such as whether a turbine is being frequently failing or nonfrequently
failing and inputs (independent variables) such as factors affecting turbine failing frequency.
LR uses maximum likelihood method to produce a best-fitting function to the data. The
procedure for best fitting is applied by several iterations to maximize the probability of the
observed data to be part of the correct classified outcome.
6.4.3 Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
ANN method is a machine learning technique to model complex problems and predict out￾comes utilizing collected data and independent variables. The method mimics the learning
and recalling behavior of human brain, which consists of massive number of neurons. Neu￾rons in ANN are randomly connected with three different layers, namely input layer, hidden
layer, and output layer.
Input layer has all information from the input pattern, whereas hidden layer con￾nects the input layer to the output layer by an activation function, and the outcome
layer transforms the hidden layer activation into the scale of desired output. The most
widely used neural network is multilayer feed forward (MLF) with back propagation
learning. The network algorithm utilizes gradient descent on the weights of the net￾works. The neural network algorithm repeats feed-forwarding and back propagating
until it finds the optimum weights between the nodes which minimize the outcome
error.10

6.5 Workforce education and training
An offshore wind energy industry is emerging in several countries, including the USA. This
growth is supported by national- and state-level targets and commitments, including the
Biden administration’s national offshore wind target to reach 30 GW of installed offshore
wind capacity by 2030 while developing a domestic workforce and state-level procurement
commitments. As of 2022, there are two fully operational projects totaling 42 MW, whereas
19 projects in the USA offshore pipeline that have reached the permitting phase, and eight
states have set offshore wind energy procurement goals totaling 39,322 MW by 2040.11
As detailed in a US-DOE/NREL report,12 offshore wind energy projects are complex and
require an extensive, varied, and well-trained workforce. It is expected that the offshore
wind industry will create new jobs among engineering, management, land-based and off￾shore skilled trades, and professional services, requiring the development of unique skills,
education, and experience to meet industry needs.
Specifically to O&M, this workforce includes long-term jobs for managing, overseeing, and
conducting monitoring, testing, repair, and maintenance of WT and their components.
O&M jobs also include marine crews who transport technicians to operate and maintain
OWTs as well as onshore staff who provide management and engineering support.
O&M occupations can generally be categorized into two types: O&M crew and wind plant
operation. The O&M crew includes wind turbine technicians and foundation and support
structure maintenance engineers. The wind turbine technician will have training for repairs
and troubleshooting using digital tools. The foundation and support structure maintenance
engineers are structural specialists expected to have a civil or structural engineering degree
and be trained in offshore-specific health safety and environmental protocols. The activi￾ties of these offshore O&M crews are supported by an onshore team that determines an
operations plan and coordinates the execution of that plan for the offshore crew. This engi￾neering, management, and oversight crew includes specialists with higher degrees, licenses,
and field expertise, such as environmental science, computer science and data science, or
business management. For example, data scientists are becoming increasingly valuable as
smart asset management approaches for optimizing operations and maintenance are being
implemented.
6.5.1 Safety training
Standardized safety training for workers who perform installation and operation activities
at sea has been identified as one of the highest priority areas in the USA, to address to ensure
that an adequately trained workforce is available to build projects. Currently, there is no offi￾cial industry training standard; however, the Global Wind Organization (GWO) standards13
are the most widely adopted. GWO is a nonprofit group of manufacturers and offshore wind
energy project owners who join to “understand and reduce the risk associated with safety
hazards in the wind industry” for land-based and offshore wind. GWO sets guidelines, based
on risks encountered in the wind turbine generator environment, that are incorporated into
training curricula by GWO-certified training providers.
As of 2022, in the USA, there are about 50 university and community colleges that offer
some form of offshore wind energy courses as part of their curricula. College and vocational

programs are typically designed to create a workforce entering the skilled trades in construc￾tion and manufacturing, and university programs are predominantly focused on creating
a workforce by providing the education required for engineers, professional support roles,
and scientists and researchers. The curricula offered vary widely and is difficult to assess the
extent to which they are addressing workforce requirements. However, these programs do
have the potential to create awareness and interest in the offshore wind industry and can
potentially be expanded to further meet requirements as the industry develops. In addition,
existing engineering programs, in particular offshore engineering or offshore energy, are well
suited to address many of the requirements of the offshore wind industry and serve as a good
foundation for an offshore-wind-specific supplement. Notable programs specific to offshore
wind energy include those at the University of Maine and the University of Rhode Island
both active in supporting east coast offshore wind farm development projects.
6.6 Summary
In the early years of wind turbine development in the 1970s and 1980s, the industry has
been affected by reliability and availability issues, ranging from structural collapses to pre￾mature component failures in the early prototypes. Historical data show that operations
and maintenance costs varied by project age and commercial operations date. Despite lim￾ited data availability, projects installed over the past 15 years have, on average, incurred
lower O&M costs than older projects in their first years of operation. The data also sug￾gest that O&M costs tend to increase as projects age, at least for the older projects in the
databases.
O&M costs can be decreased by proactive maintenance by eliminating the level of effect
of a potential failure as well as reducing downtime. Wind turbine reliability prediction and
maintenance optimization may result in a substantial monetary benefit of preventive mainte￾nance. Industry surveys indicate that corrective maintenance can save hundreds of thousands
O&M costs during the operation life of a multi-MW wind turbine. O&M cost of onshore
wind turbine can add 14 $/MWh or more to the cost of producing wind electricity. Further￾more, the cost for lost energy production during the maintenance activities further decreases
the revenue.
As wind farm deployment is increasing and wind energy becomes a major constituent of
electricity grids, around the world, reliability prediction for WT is becoming more important.
Therefore, the wind industry needs tools to help for their decision-making in their main￾tenance activities. Statistical models using machine learning applications, namely LR and
ANN, can aid in decision-making of wind turbine maintenance activities and ultimately
improve wind turbine reliability while minimizing O&M cost of wind energy. LR models
provide odds ratios for risk factors, which can be interpreted to examine wind turbine relia￾bility. ANN also provides complex relationship between risk factors and turbine reliability
and provide prediction of turbine reliability.
Self-assessment questions

Q6.2 What is the reason for the difference in WT availability in land-based and off-shore
installations?
Q6.3 What components are most likely to fail in land-based WT?
Q6.4 What components are most likely to fail in off-shore WT?
Q6.5 Give three availability definitions and explain their differences.
Problems
6.1 Calculate failure rates of the control system of WT from the data shown in Figure 6.1.
6.2 Calculate failure rates and downtime estimates of wind farms comprising 575 WT
from the data shown in Figure 6.1.
6.3 (a) Calculate wind turbine failure rates and associated downtimes from the seven
databases listed in Figure 6.2. (b) Compare the results obtained from the differ￾ent databases. (c) Compare these results with the results obtained from the data of
Figure 6.1.
6.4 Compare gear box failures and associated wind turbine downtimes for onshore and
offshore WT and give likely reasons for the difference.
Hint: The data in Figures 6.5 and 6.6 show higher failures and longer downtimes
in offshore turbines. This likely happened because of corrosion effects in and more
difficult access to offshore WT.
6.5 Offshore wind maintenance following a hurricane. The students are advised to start
working on this problems by reviewing the information is the US-DOE Wind Energy
Program website: US DOE Wind Energy Program: https://www.energy.gov/eere/
wind/wind-market-reports-2022-edition#offshore, and the NOAA website: https://
oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html
US Atlantic coast poses significant risk to OWTs from hurricanes. Figure A1 shows
North Atlantic Tracking Chart for 2011, Figure A2 shows the wind farms in the east
coast of USA, and Table 6.1 shows some details of the wind farms. Figure A3a shows
a general pattern of major hurricane events affecting the US-NW. You should look
for updates to these figures.
(a) The aim is to develop contingency planning in the case of hurricane. Failure
rates for turbines are shown in Table 6.2. Consider a scenario where 2011 events
are repeated. Estimate the number of turbines that will be unoperational in
the assumed year. Make simplified assumptions such as the hurricane affects the
whole wind farm. Use Geographical Information System (GIS) or Google Maps
to locate the wind farms and follow the hurricane tracks. An example is done in
Figure A3b, whereby it may be seen 1960s Hurricane Donna 5 passes through
the edge of CVOW wind farm.
(b) Estimate the time and resources (vessel and cost) required to reinstate the wind
farms. You may use the data in the appendix for your calculations.
(c) Estimate the downtime and the loss of revenue for the developers.

6.6 Maintenance following typhoon in Taiwan
Hurricanes (as it called in Problem 1) and typhoons are essentially the same weather
phenomenon. They are all large tropical storm systems that revolve around an area of
low pressure and produce heavy rain and wind speeds exceeding 74 mph (118 kph).
Taiwan’s location makes it vulnerable to the western North Pacific Ocean tropical
cyclone that regularly produces damaging typhoons (Figures A4 and A5).
(a) Consider a scenario where a typhoon sweeps through the entire Taiwan
coasts. The typhoon track is equivalent to hurricane category 3. Estimate the
failures.
(b) Estimate the time and resources (vessel and cost) required to reinstate.
6.7 Maintenance following an earthquake
Offshore wind farms are also constructed in earthquake areas. Figure A6 shows the
seismicity in Taiwan. It is estimated that that for a scenario earthquake subsurface
liquefaction is expected, and this will require remedial work for scour protection of
the foundation and cable protection systems. For a particular wind farm, there are
100 km of inter array cables (IAC) and 60 km of export cable.
Estimate the cost for remedial measures.
6.8 Scour protection design and maintenance
For a given location with seabed current of 1.2 m/s and foundation dimensions shown
in Figure A7, what are the available designs for scour protection? Compare the mate￾rials needed
Use the example from Vineyard Project (United States)
6.9 For the conditions of Problem 6.4, what is the cost of remedial action if scour pro￾tection was not used? (Figures A8 and A9).
6.10 Cable damage during storms and maintenance
Following cables used in a wind farm with no-scour protection. Following a hurri￾cane, during the survey, it was found the scour depth is 3 m and the cables need to be
protected (Figures A10–A12).
(a) What are the possible options to protect the cables?
(b) In each case, compare the bending radius of the cable with the original.
6.11 Failure rates for different components in offshore wind turbines
Among the various classifications presented in academic literature, the reference des￾ignation system for power plants (RDS-PP) designation (VGB PowerTech, 2012) is
widely adopted for data collection and aggregation from many wind farm developers
and operators, offering sufficient and manageable details for system and subsystem
identification and components’ technical information. Table A2 presents a high-level
classification that will be used later to present the findings from different sources
(Source: Adopted from Pfaffel et al. (2017)).

7 Grid integration
7.1 Setting the scene—national grids
The story of grid electricity goes back over a century. Edison’s pioneering work in the late
1800s on the generation and distribution of direct current (DC) electricity was overtaken in
the 20th century by the alternating current (AC) systems championed by Nikola Tesla (see
Section 3.4.1), largely due to the ease with which AC voltage can be transformed – up for
long-distance transmission, down for local distribution, and consumption. Early grids, often
owned by private companies or municipalities, were generally small and local but were soon
interconnected to form larger systems. Governments in industrial countries became keen to
encourage the growth of electricity, realizing its importance for industrial innovation and
efficiency and its key role in enhancing their citizens’ quality of life. Today, it is impossi￾ble to imagine a modern economy and society without large amounts of electrical energy
implemented via regional or national electricity grids.
The electricity grid is a complex network of power lines, designed to transport energy
from suppliers to loads. In its normal configuration, power plants feed electricity into
the high-voltage (>100 kV) transmission grid, which transports the energy to demand
centers where the voltage is stepped down to deliver power to individual customers on
the distribution grid. Both the European and the US electricity grids are more than a
century old. The US electricity grid is a conglomerate of many smaller grid systems that
were built in the late 19th century, each regulated by separate utility companies. The
grid eventually grew into three major “Interconnects” on which all power plants operate
synchronously. They are the Eastern Interconnection, Western Interconnection, and the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT); there are very few links between the
three interconnects. Figure 7.1(a) shows these interconnects, the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC) interconnect subregions and about one hundred generator,
load, and transmission balancing areas. Balancing authorities integrate power resources to
meet demand within balancing areas; they are responsible for maintaining interconnection
frequency and controlling the flow of power so that overloading of transmission lines is

avoided. The USA power transmission grid consists of 300,000 km of lines operated by 500
companies.
The largest synchronous (by connected power) electrical grid is that of continental Europe
connecting over 400 million customers in 24 countries. Although synchronous, some coun￾tries operate in a near-island mode, with low connectivity to other countries and there are
plans to increase connectivity and host more renewable energy, while enhancing the reli￾ability of the grid. To this effect, the European Electricity Grid Initiative (EEGI) has the
objective to achieve a completely decarbonized electricity production by 2050 while integrat￾ing national networks into a market-based, truly pan-European network (Figure 7.1(b)).
A good example of an extensive system serving a developed economy is the UK’s national
grid,1 originally developed in the 1930s to form Europe’s largest synchronized AC electricity
network. Operating at 50 Hz and up to 132 kV, it was upgraded in 1949 with some 275 kV
links, followed by additional 400 kV links from 1965 onward. The highest voltages are used
to transmit three-phase bulk electricity around the country, transformed down to progres￾sively lower voltages for distribution to industrial, commercial, and domestic customers.
There are also submarine links for bulk power transfer to and from France (2 GW) and The
Netherlands (1 GW).
As grids expanded, gaining regional or even national coverage, the size of individual power
plants increased dramatically. In the 1930s, the largest were typically rated at around 60 MW;
half a century later they exceeded 1 GW. Currently, the largest UK power plant is the Drax
coal-fired station in Yorkshire, producing up to 4 GW from six steam turbine generators each
rated at 660 MW. The remarkable story of electricity supply in the 20th century is one of
ever larger centralized power plants based on fossil fuel combustion and, in some countries,
nuclear fission and hydroelectric generation.
The map of England, Wales, and Scotland in Figure 7.2 shows the current locations of power
plants rated above 500 MW. These are principally coal-fired stations in traditional industrial
areas; modern gas-fired units more widely dispersed; and nuclear plants, generally away from
highly populated areas and close to the coast. Many smaller plants are not shown in the
figure; nor is the vast distribution network ranging from high-power, high-voltage cables sup￾ported on huge pylons right down to the 230 V cables that bring single-phase AC electricity
into individual households.
The UK’s pattern of large power plants underlines a number of economic and operational
criteria that apply equally well in other countries:
■ Power plants are best located close to centers of population and industry, reducing the
need for long transmission lines and minimizing transmission losses.
■ Fuel transport costs are reduced by siting plants close to fuel sources (or coastal ter￾minals if the fuel is imported).
■ Power plants needing large quantities of cooling water are often placed beside shore￾lines, large lakes, or rivers.
■ Public acceptability demands that nuclear plants are generally located well away from
population centers.
Such considerations have largely determined the distribution of power plants shown in
Figure 7.1. But what about renewable energy? Are the rules of the game being altered by the

rapid growth of wind power? Will grid networks need substantial modification, and must
network designers and operators adopt new mindsets and learn new skills?
Nature does not generally cooperate by providing wind power where it is most needed, and
turbines are often cited in areas that would not even be considered for traditional power
plants. We are now in an era of increasing renewable generation, with grid penetration levels
of 10%, 25%, or even higher on the horizon. Denmark, so often at the forefront of devel￾opments, aims to generate 50% of its electricity from the wind by 2050. Clearly, such plans
have major implications for grid operators who must allow for increasing amounts of vari￾able generation while maintaining security of supply. Big challenges undoubtedly lie ahead
for electricity supply industries in many countries – probably the biggest since the arrival of
nuclear power half a century ago.
You may already have noticed the colored tints on the map of Figure 7.1 – blue for hydro￾electric and green for wind power – indicating regions favored for these two technologies.
Needless to say, most do not meet the usual criteria for siting grid-connected power plants.
Hydroelectric stations in the highlands of Scotland and a small mountainous area of North
Wales are well away from centers of population and although Scotland looks set fair to
become a major provider of renewable electricity from wind, wave, and tide, it will need
heavy investment in new transmission from outlying regions. Many of the UK’s onshore
wind farms have been installed in the green-shaded areas, typically high uplands and coastal
strips facing prevailing westerly winds, but it is neither cheap nor simple to connect them to
the existing grid. And then, of course, there is a major new player – offshore wind, which
needs submarine cable networks and associated substations.
Comparable challenges lie ahead for other countries. We have already mentioned Denmark.
Referring to Figure 3.53 showing the liberal scattering of wind farms in northwest Germany,
it is not hard to imagine the challenges posed by the safe and satisfactory delivery of their
electricity. And how about the USA, with its vast tracts of windswept country far removed
from big cities and major grid networks; or Spain, another leader, whose wind energy is
often garnered from mountain territory? It is not simply a matter of grid connection, impor￾tant though that is; rather it is one of integration – the successful blending of renewable
and conventional energy sources into large grid networks to provide safe, reliable, and eco￾nomic electricity on a national, or even international, scale. Grid integration is one of the
big challenges facing the global wind and solar energy industries (Figure 7.4).
7.2 Electricity markets and types of power generators
A discussion of electricity markets is necessary to better understand the effects of variable
generation on the grid.
Grid-friendly WT capabilities
Fault-ride through is the capability of electric generators to stay connected in short periods of
voltage dips in electric distribution networks. It is needed to avoid a short circuit that could
lead to a widespread loss of generation.

Automatic active power frequency control. The frequency in AC grids is kept constant within
strict limits – typically at exactly 50 or 60 Hz. The frequency drops if more energy is con￾sumed than the generators feed-in. The opposite occurs if there is an energy surplus – the
grid frequency increases.
Static voltage support. In order to protect the connected loads, the voltage must be kept within
defined limits – that applies to the distribution grid in particular. Inverters that have the ability
to provide controlled inductive or capacitive reactive power can help guarantee the required
voltage quality. Reactive power-compatible inverters can also be used to compensate for
phase shifts that are caused by transformers, large motors, or long cable sections.
Dynamic grid support. Inverters with dynamic grid support functions act within milliseconds
preventing a grid failure in spreading further. Dynamic grid support ensures that the inverter
is ready to feed energy into the grid immediately after a drop in the grid voltage.
The price in energy markets is set by the dynamics of supply and demand under the geo￾graphical constraints imposed by the reach and limitations of the transmission grid. For this
reason, large grid systems are split into smaller markets at major nodes or zones, each of
them establishing a price for each hour of the day according to supply and demand. This
is called nodal pricing, or locational-based marginal pricing (LBMP). Imbalances of supply
and demand on single nodes can be overcome by importing electricity from other zones, if
there are not transmission constraints.
The balancing of supply and demand on the grid is achieved by Independent Service
Operators (ISO) through generator bidding using seasonal, week-ahead, day-ahead, and
hour-ahead load forecasts. The ISO ranks all generator bids based on their bidding price
and fills up the load forecast of each hour of the day starting from the cheapest bidder,
considering transmission line limits. Any differences between the load following and
actual load are settled, on real time, in the ancillary services market which consists of
Regulation and Reserve resources. Regulation resources can quickly adjust their output to
accommodate changes to the balance of supply and demand, upon receiving a signal from
the ISO. To protect against the risk of a plant outage, the ISO also has in-service spinning
reserves that can be on full capacity within 10 minutes, and nonspinning reserves that can
respond within 30 minutes.
The grid operations outlined above are important when we consider the impacts of high
penetration of variable generation (i.e., solar and wind) into the grid. Let us now discuss
the different types of power plants according to the services they provide. Nuclear and
large coal-fired and gas-fired power plants, which operate 24 hours a day serve a baseload,
typically the demand that is required throughout the year (8760 hours). Peaker plant can
be photovoltaics, at residential, commercial, and utility scales, and small natural gas- or
diesel-fired units which operate only during the high demand days of the year, for example,
hot summer afternoons in tropical and subtropical climates (depicted as up to 1000 hours
in Figure 7.3). Medium-size natural gas- and coal-power plants satisfy the balance of daily
loads (depicted as intermediate load in the same figure).

Figure 7.3 Example of a load duration curve.
7.2.1 Peaker plants
The market clearing price of electricity is set by the marginal price for the last MW to meet
the load. During peak load hours, a large percentage of the generator fleet is dispatched,
including “peaker plants,” which are more expensive, less efficient, and more polluting than
conventional generators.
These plants set a high electricity clearing price for all energy delivered in that time
period, and it is therefore economically desirable to prevent their dispatch. Solar and wind
generators have the potential to minimize the need for peakers, as peak demand is typically
A/C-driven, and therefore effectively reduce the market clearing price while mitigating
emissions.
Steam and gas turbines
Nuclear and coal power plants use steam turbines designed according to the Rankine cycle,
thus a closed loop expansion and condensation of steam generated by the fission or com￾bustion of fuel. Natural gas and diesel-fired turbines employ the Brayton cycle comprising
alternative isentropic and isobaric process. There are two types of gas-fired power plants,
viz. single cycle also called open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) and combined-cycle gas turbine
(CCGT) plants. OCGT plants consist of a single compressor/gas turbine that is connected to an
electricity generator via a shaft. Air is compressed by the compressor, and its oxygen is burnt
with natural gas in the combustion chamber of the gas turbine that drives both the compressor
and the electricity generator. Almost two-thirds of the gross power output of the gas turbine
is needed to compress air entailing high thermal losses, and the remaining one-third drives
the electricity generator. CCGT use both a Brayron and a Rankine cycle as the later recovers
rejected heat from the exhaust of the gas turbines to produce steam that drives a steam tur￾bine and generates additional electric power. The Rankine engines have some flexibility within
a range, by adjusting the flow of steam into the turbine, but the Brayton engines have even

greater flexibility as they have little thermal inertia and are capable to cycle and ramp quickly
(10–30 minute startups, ∼8%/min ramping).
Typical thermal efficiency for utility-scale electrical generators operating at design capacity
is around 33% for coal and oil-fired plants, between 35 and 42% for OCGT and 56–60% for
CCGT. Their efficiencies decline when operating at partial-only capacity.
The power output of hydroelectric power plants, gas turbines, and CCGT can be effectively
adjusted, and they are used to follow the variation of demand load throughout the day.
Load following power plants run during the day and early evening when the demand is
higher and are either shut down or greatly curtail output during the night, when the demand
for electricity is the lowest. Coal power plants with sliding pressure operation of the steam
generator can generate electricity at part load operation up to 75% of the nameplate capacity
and can also be used for load following although their ramping rates are slower than those
of gas turbines.
Intermediate and peak load power plants can also provide important voltage and frequency
stabilization services in addition to supplying required loads.
Regulation reserves. Normally supplied by generators that have the ability to be dis￾patched up or down remotely. (Commonly referred to as automatic generation control
or AGC.)

that a generator can contribute is limited by its ramp rate and the room between its
current dispatch level and its maximum capability. Contingency can also be supplied
by demand response controlled by the system operator.
7.2.2 Baseload plants
Hydroelectric power plants can be efficient for both intermediate load following and
baseload applications. Thermo-electric baseline generators (nuclear, large coal) use the
Rankine cycle (discussed in text box above) and are built to operate at their maximum or
near-maximum output 24 hours a day and are expensive to ramp or cycle as this incurs
physical wear due to their high thermal inertia. CCGT power plants are also used for
serving baseload and as the price of natural gas is being reduced they are displacing coal in
baseline power plants.
A common critique of renewable power generation is that it is unsuitable for baseload supply;
therefore, fossil power and nuclear power are needed. This critique is misleading. Baseload
is a demand characteristic, not a supply technology characteristic. Nuclear or coal power
plants are operated in baseload mode simply because they are not technically capable of
operating in a more variable mode and must rely on high utilization to recover their high
investment costs. In the future power system, the value of baseload will decrease. With higher
shares of wind and solar electricity, supply and demand will be matched in a more flexible
way. Variable renewable power generation can be combined with smart-grid technologies,
demand response, energy storage, and more flexible generation technologies, including gas
power plants and dispatchable renewable power supply options. A flexible, renewables-based
power system is not only reliable but also economically efficient.
7.3 Connecting to the grid
7.3.1 Grid strength and fault levels
Over the past century, we have grown used to the idea of electricity grids as essentially
“one-way” systems. Large AC generators in power plants (preferably out of sight, usually
out of mind) feed electricity into the grid for delivery to homes, offices, and factories. Like
water and gas supplies, the flow is one way. Who can imagine pumping water back into their
kitchen taps, to be credited by the water company; or making their own gas, and pumping
any excess back into the gas main? Yet, in recent years, it has been possible to buy a small
wind turbine (WT), mount it on a pole in the garden, and pump electricity back into the
cables that normally import it. In principle, an electricity grid can be supplied or tapped at
any point.
Of course, a small domestic WT with a peak power output of, say, 2 kW is a very differ￾ent proposition from a modern megawatt horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) rated at
4 MW – in fact, two thousand times different. Nobody suggests connecting a 4-MW HAWT
to the domestic electricity supply, or a 2 kW machine directly to a large grid. But suppose
a new wind farm is to be grid connected in a rural area. For a start, it is necessary to lay
cables from the farm to the nearest suitable connection point (i.e., substation). But what is

needed to make an efficient connection that is acceptable to the grid operator and nearby
consumers? In this section, we deal with two important requirements:
■ The wind farm, when operating in high winds at maximum output, must not overload
local distribution cables and transformers.
■ The wind farm must not cause unacceptable voltage fluctuations in the electricity sup￾plied to local consumers.
To explore these issues, it is first necessary to appreciate the electrical layout of a typical
grid, which is illustrated in Figure 7.5(a). On the left large power plant generators (we show
just two, G1 and G2), generally with individual ratings well above 100 MW, feed three-phase
electricity into a high-voltage (HV) transmission grid via step-up transformers (T1 and T2).
Power is tapped at various points and fed into a medium-voltage (mv) distribution system
via a step-down transformer (T3) for delivery to local areas. And finally, it is transformed
down again (T4) to a voltage suitable for individual consumers (office, home, streetlights,
etc.), who generally receive just one phase of the three-phase supply. Larger consumers such
as factories are often connected to the mv system and supplied with three phases. The voltage
levels in various parts of the system vary from country to country but are typically between
110 and 750 kV for HV transmission, 10 and 70 kV for mv distribution, and 120 or 240 V
for final delivery to consumers. We have shown transformers in the figure but not the associ￾ated switchgear, fuses, and circuits that control power flow and prevent damage under fault
conditions.
All this is conventional “one-way” delivery from large, centralized power plants to millions
of individual consumers. There is no hint so far of renewable energy being fed into the grid,
often by relatively small generators in far-flung parts of the network. To discuss this, we need

some basic knowledge of AC circuits and associated terminology, and you may wish to refer
back to the introduction given in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.1.
Part (b) of Figure 7.5 illustrates, in basic form, the electrical connection of a WT (or wind
farm) to the mv distribution network. We assume that the “grid” on the left includes the
large synchronous generators, transformers, and HV cables that make up a conventional
high-power generation and transmission system, delivering a stable three-phase AC volt￾age (V1) at a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz to the mv distribution network, represented by an
impedance Z. On the right is a WT with a rated power PW together with switchgear (S) that
connects it to the nearest suitable point of the network. Also connected at this point are
existing local loads that consume power (PL). The voltage at the connection point is V2.
We will start with the WT (or wind farm) disconnected. In this case, the local loads draw
power from the grid in the normal manner. Ideally, the voltage V2 they actually receive is
very close to the nominal system voltage V1. However, the current taken by the loads must
flow through distribution cables and transformers, which have a combined impedance (Z)
made up of resistance (R) and inductive reactance (j𝜔L) in series. This causes a voltage drop
equal to the product of current and impedance magnitudes and has the effect of reducing
the voltage V2 below V1. Clearly, if the impedance is too large, or if too much current is
being drawn, the voltage drop may become unacceptable. This is especially likely to happen
if large loads are connected at the far end of a long distribution line.
You may be surprised at the representation of all supply cables and transformers by a single
impedance Z. Typically, distribution cables are mainly resistive, causing real power losses;
transformers are very efficient at transferring real power, but their windings are inherently
inductive and need reactive power to set up and maintain their magnetic fields. So the combi￾nation of cables and transformers in a distribution network normally produces a complicated
mix of resistance and reactance. Fortunately, AC circuit theory comes to the rescue, allowing
us to lump all the individual elements together and represent them by a single impedance.
This idea has important implications for describing the quality of a grid connection. If Z
is small (cables and transformers generously rated) in relation to the currents demanded by
the loads, the voltage V2 received by the loads remains very close to the nominal system
voltage V1 and the grid connection is said to be strong, or stiff. But if the impedance is
comparatively large (low-rated cables and transformers), V2 may deviate substantially from
the system voltage, and the grid connection is said to be weak. Furthermore, the voltage will
fluctuate substantially as individual loads are switched on and off – not a good recipe for
customer satisfaction. Needless to say, strong grids are highly desirable from the customers’
viewpoint and grid operators normally undertake to maintain supply voltages within, say,
10% of their nominal values. However, generous cables and transformers are expensive to
install, especially in outlying areas, and a strong grid connection can easily become a weak
one if more customers and loads are connected.
The usual way of quantifying grid strength at a particular point is in terms of its fault level.
This is the product of the nominal system voltage and the current that would flow in the
event of a short circuit. In Figure 7.5(b), the short-circuit current would be V1/Z, so the fault
level in volt–amperes (VA) is V1
2/Z. For example, if the nominal voltage of a distribution
system is 30 kV, and it has an impedance of 9 Ω at the connection point, the fault level is
equal to:
(
30 × 103)2
∕9 = 108
VA = 100 MVA (7.1)

The fault level gives a good indication of the maximum load that can be connected without
causing an unacceptable voltage drop. By definition, the short-circuit current is the maxi￾mum that could possibly flow, and it reduces the voltage V2 to zero. But when a normal load
is connected, the acceptable voltage drop is far smaller – say 5%. This in turn implies that
the load VA should not exceed a few percent of the fault level. For example, loads totaling
up to 5 MVA could probably be connected satisfactorily to a point where the fault level is
100 MVA.
We now come to an important question: what happens when the WT is run up to speed, con￾nected to the grid, and starts generating? We should first note that large WTs often generate
at 690 V and include their own step-up transformers; alternatively, in a wind farm, the power
from all the turbines may be collected and transformed in the farm’s substation. Whatever
the details, we are assuming in Figure 7.5(b) that the turbine power PW is connected to the
grid at the same point as some local loads. Power cannot be stored, so the power flows from
the turbine, into the loads, and through the impedance Z must always be in balance. Fur￾thermore, apparent power, equal to the product of AC voltage and current and measured
in VA, comprises real power measured in watts (W) and reactive power measured in reactive
volt–amperes (VAR) – and both types of power must remain in balance.
All this leads to a complicated power balance at the grid connection point, making it difficult
to predict exactly what will happen to the voltage V2 as the turbine’s power output varies
and different loads are switched on and off. Generally, we may expect that whenever PW >PL
the voltage V2 will tend to rise above V1 as the turbine “pushes” real power into the grid
through impedance Z; but when wind generation falls below local load demand, V2 will fall
below V1. Detailed analysis is certainly possible2 but beyond the scope of this chapter. How￾ever, it is clear that a strong grid with low impedance Z is highly desirable because it “ties”
the voltage at the connection point more firmly to the nominal system voltage V1, prevent￾ing unacceptable fluctuations as the wind strength and load demand vary. Large turbines
attached to weak grids are a recipe for trouble!
Fault levels are good indicators of a grid’s ability to accept power from a turbine or wind
farm. For example, if a new wind farm is to be built with 10 large HAWTs and a rated output
of 25 MW, it would be wise to seek a grid connection with a fault level above, say, 250 MVA.
If this is not available, a network upgrade may be necessary. A key issue for grid operators
as penetration levels of wind power continue to grow is the provision of grid capacity with
adequate fault ride-through levels at all points of connection.
Weak grids caused major problems in California during the early days of the modern wind
energy renaissance, sometimes referred to as the “Californian wind rush.” A famous case
centered on the Tehachapi Pass in the mountains north of Los Angeles where a huge num￾ber of turbines, relatively small by modern standards, were connected to an existing grid
network.3 Unfortunately, the 66 kV grid had been designed to serve a population of less than
20,000 people spread over a wide area, with a planned load of just 80 MW. But by 1986, the
power output of Tehachapi turbines was peaking at 125 MW, and the system became over￾whelmed. If ever there was an example of a weak grid, this was surely it. At the time there was
very little understanding of the problem, which was exacerbated by the use of induction gen￾erators needing large amounts of reactive power that simply could not be transported over
the cable network. Such mistakes, it seems safe to say, would not be repeated today. Actually,
the Tehachapi problem was far greater than the connection of individual turbines or wind
farms; it affected the operation and stability of the grid as a whole, and the lessons painfully
learned were essentially those of grid integration – a theme we will develop a little later.

7.4 Electrical quality
In Section 7.3 we focused on the voltage fluctuations that affect an electrical grid, particularly
when the grid is weak at the point of connection. The problem is important because electrical
equipment, from industrial motors right down to consumer electronics, is designed to work
at specific voltages and grid operators aim to keep voltage levels reasonably steady. However,
there is more to “electrical quality” than relatively slow changes in grid voltage over time
scales of minutes or hours, typically caused by turbines as the average wind speed varies.
The rapidity of fluctuations is also very important.
A turbine or wind farm in a weak grid may produce rapid voltage changes that make lights
flicker and annoy nearby consumers. Such voltage flicker is often caused by turbulent wind
conditions, or turbine connection and disconnection. Other potential causes are distur￾bances to the wind flow as each blade passes the tower, referred to as tower shadow, and
cyclic variations in rotor torque caused by wind shear. In a large three-bladed turbine, these
effects occur at three times rotation speed, referred to as the blade-passing frequency – say
between 15 and 50 times a minute. (We should distinguish voltage flicker from the flicker
caused when sunlight is interrupted by blades as they sweep the sky.)
It is also important to realize that the amount of flicker caused by a large HAWT depends
on its aerodynamic and electrical design. “Fixed speed” turbines based on induction gener￾ators are particularly susceptible, whereas modern variable-speed machines tend to iron out
flicker effects by absorbing power surges as changes in rotor kinetic energy. The use of blade
pitching to limit output power at high wind speeds may produce flicker if the pitch mecha￾nism fails to respond to sudden gusts. Fortunately, the latest designs incorporating electronic
power converters offer increased scope for rapid and flexible control of the voltage and power
delivered to the grid.
Physiologists tell us that the human eye is most sensitive to brightness fluctuations at frequen￾cies of around 8–10 Hz, but flicker comes in many guises and is highly subjective. Occasional
connection and disconnection of turbines may be acceptable, whereas repeated on–off cycles
as the wind hovers around cut-in speed can try the patience. Random flicker caused by wind
turbulence is perceived as qualitatively different from regular, periodic, flicker caused by
tower shadow. All are highly dependent on the strength of the grid at the point of connection
and make any annoyance hard to predict or quantify.
Another important aspect of a grid’s electrical quality concerns waveform distortion. AC
voltages at all points on a grid are ideally sinusoidal in form, and so are the currents drawn
by linear loads, as assumed in our introduction to AC circuits in Section 3.4.1. But non￾linear loads take non-sinusoidal currents from the supply. A familiar example is a dimmer
switch controlling the brightness of an electric light, which works by switching the current
rapidly on and off during each cycle of the voltage waveform. Dimmer lights are hardly
likely to upset the operation of a grid, but large nonlinear loads are a different matter. By
demanding non-sinusoidal currents, they tend to distort the voltage waveforms appearing
on a grid – especially where it is weak – and in serious cases may produce overheating or
failure of other equipment, faulty operation of protective devices, nuisance tripping of sensi￾tive loads, and interference with communications circuits.3 Electric utilities normally impose
strict limits on the amount of voltage distortion that can be introduced into their networks
by large nonlinear loads.

The other side of the coin concerns generation. Large synchronous generators that feed
conventional electricity grids are expertly designed to produce sinusoidal voltage waveforms
with minimal distortion, but WTs can be less than ideal. “Fixed speed,” stall-controlled,
machines cause little distortion because their induction generators are essentially linear
machines. However, the power converters in today’s variable-speed HAWTs incorporate
electronic switching circuits that, by their very nature, can only approximate smooth
sinusoidal waveforms. Here is a considerable challenge for designers, who must ensure that
distortion caused by power converters remains within acceptable limits.
Waveform distortion is normally assessed in terms of harmonics. A pure sinusoidal voltage
contains a single frequency, referred to as the fundamental. But if the waveform becomes
distorted additional frequencies, known as harmonics, are introduced at integer multiples
of the fundamental. For example, a distorted 50 Hz waveform may contain harmonic
components at 100, 150, 200 Hz, and so on. The underlying concept is that of Fourier
analysis, named after French mathematician and physicist Jean Baptiste Baron de Fourier
(1768–1830), who showed that any periodic waveform, regardless of its shape, may be
formed by adding together a set of sinusoids with appropriate amplitudes and phases.
Switching waveforms tend to be rich in harmonics.
The amount of distortion in a waveform is usually measured in terms of its total harmonic
distortion (THD), which is the ratio of the energy in all harmonic frequencies to the energy
in the fundamental, expressed as a percentage. THD in the high-power transmission section
of a large electrical grid is normally very small – say below 1% – but it tends to grow as
the electricity is transformed down and distributed to local areas and, finally, to individual
consumers. A large WT incorporating electronic power converters tends to raise the THD
on the distribution network, especially if the grid connection is relatively weak.
Two key roles of power converters in variable-speed WTs have already been shown in Figures
3.39 and 3.46: Conversion of AC to DC (rectification) and from DC to AC (inversion). The
DC link between rectifier and inverter effectively isolates the frequency of the generator from
that of the grid, allowing a turbine to run at variable speed. Voltage-source inverters, which
use electronic switches to create an AC waveform from a source of DC voltage, are widely
used in turbines, and we can illustrate their principles with some typical waveforms.
Figure 7.6(a) shows one cycle (period) of a pure sinusoidal voltage, the ideal output wave￾form for an inverter feeding an electricity grid. Part (b) shows a staircase-like approximation
consisting of six discrete voltage steps – not a very accurate representation, but one that can
be obtained with a simple switching circuit known as a 6-pulse inverter. Three-phase versions
can be made using just 12 electronic switches turned on and off at appropriate points in each
cycle.2 The high THD of this waveform may be reduced by increasing the number of steps
in the staircase, at the expense of more complicated circuitry. When the number of steps is
sufficient to reduce the THD to less than a few percent, manufacturers often describe an
inverter output as “true sine wave” with a purity similar to grid electricity. True sine wave
inverters are widely used to run sensitive low-power electronic equipment such as computers
from a DC battery supply.
However, when it comes to the high-power inverters used in large variable-speed HAWTs
with megawatt ratings, an alternative approach known as pulse code modulation (PCM) is
widely used. It is illustrated in part (c) of the figure. The AC voltage waveform is synthesized
as a series of constant-height pulses with widths determined by the value of the sinusoid
at various points in the cycle. The pulses are widest when the sinusoid is at its peak positive
value, and vice-versa. For clarity, we have shown just 10 pulses (and 20 switching operations)

per cycle of the sinusoid, but in practice there are many more (switching rates are commonly
in the kilohertz range). This has the beneficial effect of greatly increasing the frequencies of
waveform harmonics, moving them far above the fundamental and reducing their nuisance
value or, alternatively, making them easier to suppress by filtering (see later).
The PCM waveform in part (c) is not obviously a useful approximation to the sinusoid in
part (a). But imagine that there are actually 100 pulses per cycle, rather than the 10 shown,
and that we draw a smooth curve through the switching waveform to give a running average.
It is not hard to see that this average will be high where the sinusoid is high, and vice-versa;
in other words, by performing a running average we may extract the underlying fluctua￾tions of the sine wave. In electronic terms, this is achieved by low-pass filtering. That is, the
low frequencies in the waveform are passed, or retained, but the high-frequency ones are
suppressed. In this case, we need to preserve the fundamental and suppress the harmon￾ics. Filter theory is beyond the scope of this book, so we just note that it relies upon the
frequency-dependent properties of inductors and capacitors to discriminate in favor of some
frequencies at the expense of others.2, 3 PCM techniques, together with filtering, can form the
basis of high-power inverters with very low THD levels.
We have concentrated on the effects a turbine can have on the quality of grid electricity,
and for anyone interested in the design and operation of WTs, these are clearly important
issues; yet there is another side to the story – the effects that fluctuations of grid voltage and

frequency, and grid outages, can have on the operation and safety of turbines. Supply and
demand of active power on the grid must always be in balance, or the grid frequency will devi￾ate far from its set point (60 Hz in the USA, 50 Hz in Europe), causing connected appliances
to shut down or get damaged. The frequency of the system would vary as load and generation
change. If there is more generation than demand, frequency goes up; if there is less generation
than demand, frequency goes down. During a severe overload caused by tripping or failure
of generators or transmission lines, the power system frequency will decline because of an
imbalance of load versus generation. Loss of an interconnection, while exporting power, will
cause system frequency to rise. Also, temporary frequency changes are an unavoidable conse￾quence of changing demand. AGC is used to maintain scheduled frequency and interchange
power flows and the presence of many generators and a large, distributed load allows for easy
frequency management. Control systems in power plants detect changes in the network-wide
frequency and adjust mechanical power input to generators back to their target frequency.
Modern wind power plants (WPP) can also respond to frequency regulation by curtailing
or increasing power instantaneously (see Section 7.7).
Not surprisingly, these also tend to be more serious in a weak grid and affect the older type of
fixed-speed, stall-regulated, turbines more than modern variable-speed machines with power
converters. An interesting case is India, where large numbers of stall-regulated machines were
installed over many years in comparatively weak grid networks.3 The experience gained is
no doubt standing India in good stead as its wind energy industry mushrooms. Another
example comes from Germany, where the concentration of turbines connected to mv distri￾bution systems in the northwest of the country (see Figure 3.53) has highlighted concerns
about two-way interaction between grids and turbines.3
We have covered a number of relatively local issues that arise when turbines and wind farms
are connected to an electricity grid. It is now time to consider the effects that wind energy
has on grid systems as a whole – and how they cope with increasing amounts of renewable
generation.
7.5 Large-scale wind power
A large modern electricity grid connects hundreds of generators to thousands of kilometers
of transmission and distribution lines and finally to millions of consumers. Often taken for
granted by the public, electricity grids are among the most important strategic and economic
assets of any modern society. From a technical point of view, they are complex engineering
systems with operational features that can only be addressed at the system’s level.
An important factor is grid strength at the point of WT connection. Local voltage fluctua￾tions, flicker, and waveform distortion are certainly important to local consumers, but they
hardly ruffle the feathers of a large grid. What matters to system planners and operators is
the reliable and economic supply of electricity over a regional, national, or even international
network.
Grid integration of large amounts of wind power has received a great deal of academic and
practical attention over the past 30 years,3 and much has been learned from countries at the
forefront of developments including Denmark, Germany, Spain, and the USA. It is only
fair to add that plenty of misinformation has been peddled by vested interests that oppose
the growth of renewable electricity. We will examine the main issues in the following pages,
284

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseGrid integration
but first it is helpful to list previous topics that relate to the operation of large electricity
grids:
■ The power produced by WTs and conventional power plants in relation to the annual
electricity demands of households (Section 1.4).
■ The mushrooming growth of wind energy capacity, national and global, and the devel￾opment of offshore wind (Section 1.5).
■ The wild nature of the wind and the importance of wind forecasting (Chapter 2).
■ The nature of AC electricity and the characteristics of electrical generators
(Section 3.4).
Conventional grids are powered by synchronous generators driven by steam, gas, and hydro￾electric turbines that are firmly “tied” to the grid and must rotate at speeds dictated by the
grid frequency. Individual synchronous generators are able to control their terminal volt￾age and power factor by varying field excitation. Operators keep the system frequency and
voltage within narrow limits by matching total generation of real and reactive power to
total demand, requesting changes in output from various power plants in a highly skilled
balancing act.
Wind power tends to disturb the complex, but well-established, control of conventional syn￾chronous generation in several ways:
⬧ Large HAWTs use a variety of generating systems, synchronous and asynchronous, with
and without power converters.
⬧ The rated power of a small-to-medium wind farm (say 5–50 MW) is much smaller than
that of a single, large, conventional synchronous generator (say 100–750 MW).
⬧ The wind is uncontrollable.
None of these differences is of much concern to grid operators as long as the penetration
of wind power remains small. But as it rises, and as the installed capacity of individual
wind farms, especially offshore, begins to rival that of conventional power plants, the picture
changes and successful grid integration moves to the top of the agenda. It is time to consider
some large-scale system issues that affect the operation of a grid as a whole.
7.6 Intermittency and variability
Turbines stop running when the wind dies. People watching a turbine start and stop in
response to varying wind speeds may be tempted to conclude that intermittency makes wind
an unreliable source of energy.
In any event, the intermittency of a wind farm is less than that of its individual turbines.
Different wind conditions across the site mean that some machines may be generating while
others are stationary. When all are working, some generate more power than others and
individual outputs vary in response to wind turbulence. Since the fluctuations are at least
partly unsynchronized (uncorrelated) between different turbines the net effect is reduced
variability in the output of the farm as a whole. This important effect, which grows with the
capacity and extent of a wind farm, is referred to as power smoothing.

Moving up the power scale, the operators of large electricity grids are certainly not con￾cerned with the intermittency of individual turbines, or even of wind farms – unless they
are very large. What matters is the total wind generation at a given time, gathered across
the network from widely dispersed wind farms experiencing different wind conditions. It is
therefore rather misleading to describe wind energy as intermittent at the power system level.
It is certainly variable, but the power smoothing effect is greatly enhanced by a good geo￾graphical spread of wind farms because, for example, wind conditions in Scotland hardly
ever match those in the south of England. In future, there will be trading of wind power
between nations including those bordering the North Sea, leading to even more “geographi￾cal smoothing.” But the big picture is rarely understood, or appreciated, by casual observers
of stationary turbines.
Wind farms are not the only generators to display variability. No generating plant operates
continuously or is 100% dependable at times of peak demand. In fact, the public might be
quite surprised to learn how often a conventional plant is shut down in fault conditions or
for maintenance – and how long repair can take, especially in the case of nuclear power where
safety is such an issue. A large grid system does not notice the shutdown of a few megawatt
HAWTs, but it must certainly respond rapidly to the unexpected loss of gigawatts from a
coal-fired or nuclear plant.
However, we must admit that wind power’s variability, as opposed to “on–off” intermit￾tency, is significant for system operators. The wind is wild and does not blow to order; wind
energy cannot be stored but must be used when available. Figure 7.7 shows a typical record

of electricity demand and wind generation in a large grid over a 7-day period, expressed as
percentage of peak demand. The demand curve (a) displays a fairly regular daily cycle with
a morning peak as the population rises and starts work, a flattening off in the middle of the
day, and a smaller peak in the early evening. Loads are smaller at the weekend because indus￾try and commerce are largely inactive. Wind generation, shown by curve (b), has peaks and
troughs dictated by the weather rather than human activity. In this example wind supplies
up to about 20% of peak demand but not, of course, in synchronism with it. The shaded area
between the red and blue curves, labeled (c), represents the power that must be supplied on
a minute-by-minute basis by all non-wind generation such as fossil-fuel, hydro, nuclear and
other renewables, which we call net load herein.
A grid’s ability to accommodate continually changing patterns of wind generation is some￾times questioned. But curve (a) emphasizes a crucial point: grid operators are already used
to high levels of variability, not in supply, but in demand. They must cope with large daily
swings, often up to 40 or 50% of peak demand, and schedule generation capacity accordingly.
Power plants are continually being brought in and out of service, adjusting their outputs,
and matching demand on a minute-by-minute basis. Actually, consumer demand can be
even more fickle than suggested by the regular peaks and troughs in the figure. Famous – we
might say notorious – examples are the sudden surges that occur at half-time in a World
Cup football match, or during breaks in popular TV dramas, when people watching televi￾sion rush to their electric kettles to brew quick cups of tea or coffee. The effect, known as
TV pickup, is well known to the UK’s national grid operators who have learned to cope with
gigawatt fluctuations within a few minutes, balancing the sudden “ramping” of demand with
generation by fast-response power plant. The speed of such changes rivals anything the wind
can do!
We see that variability is a major and inherent feature of large electricity grids. Demand
fluctuates on a wide range of time scales, from minutes to months and even years. Faults
occasionally shut down large power plants or transmission lines. The injection of wind power
certainly adds to the overall variability of the system, but not to the extent that many people
assume. The example in Figure 7.7 shows wind contributing about 14% of demand over a
whole week. It is interesting to note that as of 2023 Denmark generates about 53% of its
annual electricity from the wind exceeding their 2050 goal, Portugal 26%, Spain 23%, and
Germany 17%, and none of these penetration levels presents serious technical or operational
difficulties.
Successful adaptation to wind’s variability is made much easier by accurate forecasting. The
science of wind forecasting is less developed than that of electrical load forecasting, and it is
easier to predict wind speeds an hour or two ahead rather than days ahead. Errors for single
wind farm sites tend to be larger than for regions.4 But great advances have been made over
the past 20 years, not least because of the value of accurate forecasts to owners and operators
of wind farms and electricity grids. Fortunately, system operators are hardly concerned with
the output of individual wind farms, unless very large, and can schedule alternative power
plants based upon forecasts of wind generation over the whole network.
The central message is that intermittency is not a serious problem for electricity grids unless
caused by the sudden, unscheduled, shut down of large power plants.6 Wind energy sim￾ply contributes to the highly variable picture already produced by fluctuations in demand.
That there are no insuperable technical problems, at least up to penetration levels of around
20%, seems proven by the experience of pioneering countries that are already integrating
substantial amounts of wind energy into their grid networks.

7.7 Grid-friendly wind power plants
“Grid-friendly” WPP help to stabilize the grid by incorporating voltage regulation, active
power controls, ramp-rate controls, fault-ride though, and frequency response.7 A plant-level
control system which controls many individual inverters to affect plant output at the grid
connection point, is a key enabler of such features. The power plant controller (PPC) moni￾tors system-level measurements and determines the desired operating conditions of various
plant devices to meet the specified targets. It manages the inverters ensuring that they are
producing the real and reactive power necessary to meet the desired settings at the point of
interconnection (POI). For example, when the plant operator sends an active power cur￾tailment command, the controller calculates and distributes active power curtailment to
individual inverters. In general, the inverters can be throttled back only to a certain spec￾ified level of active power without causing the DC voltage to rise beyond its operating range.
Therefore, the plant controller dynamically stops and starts inverters as needed to manage
the specified active power output limit.
These advanced plant features enable WPP to behave more like conventional generators
and actively contribute to grid reliability and stability, providing significant value to util￾ities and grid operators. They also use the active power management function to ensure
that the plant output does not exceed the allowed ramp rates, to the extent possible. These
capabilities were demonstrated in a series of tests conducted by the California Indepen￾dent System Operator (CAISO), Avangrid Renewables, National Renewable Energy Lab￾oratory, and General Electric (GE) during 2019 at Avangrid Renewables’ 131 MW Tule
Wind Farm, located in CAISO’s balancing authority east of San Diego. The plant comprises
57 WTs, each of 2.3 MW rated capacity. The test results, much like those from a similar
tests on inverter-controlled photovoltaic power plants (Gevorgian+ O’Neal), showed that

a commercial WPP with inverter-based smart control can provide balancing or regulation
up and down, voltage regulation control, active power control through ramping capability,
and frequency response.5, 15 A key component of the Tule WPP is the PPC. It is designed to
regulate real and reactive power output from the WPP so that it behaves as a single large
generator. Although the plant comprises individual inverters, with each inverter perform￾ing its own energy production based on local wind speed, the PPC coordinated the power
output to provide typical large power plant services, such as APC and voltage regulation,
through reactive power regulation. These tests proved that solar and WPP can provide criti￾cal grid services as long as they are equipped with PCC and they maintain excess capacity by
normally operating below their maximum capabilities. In these tests, the plants were oper￾ating at 10% below their maximum capacities, allowing for 10% headroom for reserves and
upregulation (Figure 7.8).
7.8 Capacity credit and backup generation
From an environmental point of view, the most obvious benefit of wind energy is that it is
“carbon free.” A unit of electricity generated by a WT obviates the need to generate it by
other means, including the burning of coal, gas, or oil. For this reason, wind energy has often
been described as a “fuel saver” that reduces carbon dioxide emissions. When we say that
Denmark currently generates about 20% of its annual electricity from the wind, it is clear
that the Danes’ need for other “fuels,” local or imported, is reduced accordingly.
So far, so good. But how about the ability of WTs to displace other types of generators? This
is a key question because all types of power plants are expensive to build and maintain. For
over 30 years, skeptics have repeated the claim that, since the output of WTs is intermittent,
wind is an inherently unreliable energy source that cannot reduce the need for conventional
generating capacity. They maintain that it is simply a fuel saver, without capacity credit, and
that there will always be a need for backup generation.
All this relates to our discussion of intermittency and variability in Section 7.6. If you watch
an individual turbine, or even a wind farm, you may be tempted to conclude that the wind is
highly unreliable. But grid operators are concerned with total generation by all wind farms
on a grid and regard wind power as one more variable input to the system. In their eyes, all
types of generation and consumption are, to some extent, “unreliable.”
Back in 2006, the UK’s Energy Research Centre (UKERC) produced a detailed report5 on
these issues, based on a review of more than 200 international studies. None of the studies
suggested that renewable energy generation at levels up to 20% of demand would compro￾mise the reliability of the British electricity system over the following 20 years, although it
might lead to some increase in costs and would affect the way the system is operated. We use
some of the report’s main findings in the following discussion.
Wind generation affects the performance and reliability of a large grid system in two rather
distinct ways: short-term management and long-term planning.
Short-term management requires grid operators to balance electricity generation and con￾sumption continuously, scheduling power plants over time scales from minutes to hours in
order to keep the system frequency and voltage within statutory limits. Operators must be
able to call on balancing reserves that can boost generation at short notice. The introduc￾tion of substantial amounts of wind power means that the output of other plant will need

to be adjusted more frequently, and the UKERC report found that extra backup generation
amounting to 5–10% of installed wind capacity may be needed to cope with peaks in demand
that are uncorrelated with peaks in wind generation.
An important feature of balancing reserves is their speed of response, or ramp rate. Clearly,
a sudden increase in electricity consumption (we mentioned the “World Cup problem” in
Section 7.6, or a sudden loss of output from other generators due to fault conditions, cannot
be offset by reserves that take hours to come online. Fast-response generators with high ramp
rates such as hydroelectric and gas turbines can work up to full output within minutes and
are said to be dispatchable. But the outputs from nuclear and, to a lesser extent, coal-fired
power plants take far longer to adjust, and any continuous “cycling” tends to increase wear
and tear on turbines and generators. For these reasons, they are normally used to supply
the system’s minimum demand level, or baseload, typically around 50% of the peak (see
Figure 7.7).
In addition, the ramp rates associated with a particular type of reserve capacity are affected
by whether or not it is kept spinning. Synchronous generators that are “up-to-speed” and
locked to grid frequency do not necessarily have to generate power. They can just spin at
synchronous speed, consuming minimal fuel, and react quickly when power is demanded.
Conversely, non-spinning reserves must be brought up to speed before synchronizing with the
grid. In the case of a steam turbine, this must be done gently to avoid severe thermal stresses
as it approaches working temperature.
Grid operators normally have to accept wind power whenever it is generated because it is a
question of “use it or lose it.” This means, of course, that the output from other generators
must be adjusted accordingly. The ramp rates of reserve capacity must be able to cope with
the fastest rates of change in wind generation – caused, for example, when a storm sweeps
rapidly across the North Sea. However, this does not mean that dedicated reserve capacity
needs be provided to support individual wind farms; indeed, it would be very uneconomic
to do so. The variability of wind, and the backup generation needed to support it, is only
significant at the system level.
To summarize the short-term management issue, successful balancing of supply and demand
in the presence of wind generation does require some extra backup plant that can match the
ramp rates expected of variable wind. But the balancing act is no different in principle to
that already required by other types of generation, conventional and renewable, and by the
highly variable nature of consumer demand.
7.9 The variability challenge and solutions
The electric grid system and its market operations were designed to deal with variability of
demand and supply on different timescales, mainly by dispatching controllable generators
and, to a lesser degree, by using electricity storage systems. A high penetration of variable
wind and solar electricity into the grid creates challenges for the grid operators who need to
reliably satisfy load demands every hour of the day.
The following solutions are available for reducing or mitigating variability: (i) geographical
diversity/transmission interconnections; (ii) forecasting; and (iii) energy storage. A combina￾tion of these solutions would in most cases provide the minimum cost solution as variability
is reduced with geographical diversity and controlling it is easier and less expensive when

we have accurate forecasting. Also demand management has a significant role in handling
diurnal variability.
Below we discuss geographical diversity and high-voltage transmission lines; energy storage
is covered elsewhere.7, 8
7.9.1 Geographical diversity/transmission interconnections
The wind speed at a single location can change drastically; however, the aggregate output
of geographically dispersed WT systems is much smoother than that of a single point as the
wind speed and direction vary with location.
7.9.2 Long-distance transmission lines
High voltage (HV) transmission lines
HV transmission lines can be AC of DC. The first are more common, but long-distance contin￾uous interconnect is only feasible with DC. The high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines have
larger interconnection losses than high-voltage alternating current (HVAC), but much lower
transmission losses.
While HVAC systems merely require transformers that step down the voltage to the next
lower level HVDC systems rely on power electronics to convert between DC and AC networks.
Transformers and power electronics are located in two converter stations at each end of the
line. The line is bipolar at a voltage of ±800 kV, so the load is carried by two cables in parallel.
Each pole consists of six aluminum core steel reinforced (ACSR) conductors.
Geographical diversity can greatly reduce the fluctuations of both wind and solar energies.
As discussed before, increasing the geographical area of wind, by either connecting an aggre￾gate of dispersed WT systems or by constructing large wind farm plants, it decreases the
cloud-induced fluctuations of their total output. Long-distance electricity travel over long
distances or the long-distance interconnects will necessitate HVDC lines. The technology is
well established. Currently, HVDC transmission lines with a capacity of 6.4 GW are oper￾ating in China utilizing ±800 kV technology and a project utilizing 1.1 MV technology is in
progress. With 800-kV HVDC lines, the transmission of electricity over 2000 km lines entails
a 7% electromagnetic loss versus a 22% or higher loss via HVAC power lines of the same dis￾tance. Also, construction of HVDC power lines requires 37% less land area than constructing
HVAC ones. For the USA, Fthenakis and collaborators Zweibel and Mason have defined
the needs of HVDC from the SW for solar and the high plains for wind to the rest of the
countries3, 4. MacDonald et al.9 discussed the feasibility of reducing CO2 emissions in the
USA grid by 80% from those in 190, by moving away from a regionally divided electricity
sector to a national system enabled by HVDC transmission. The biggest challenge regard￾ing long-distance transmission is that would need approvals from a plethora of regional and
national jurisdictions.
Crossing national boards may be more involving, but we have plenty of boundary-crossing
transmission lines in Europe, US-Canada, and elsewhere. Developing large global electricity
grids is not a far-fetched idea; it could follow the paradigm of global telecommunications
networks, which were enabled by fiber-optics technology connecting continents with under￾water cables; it is expensive but it is technologically feasible.

7.9.3 Grid flexibility
The flexibility of a power system that is its ability to vary its output to meet the demand
depends on the mix of its generators. Its flexibility is constrained mainly by the baseload
generators, usually nuclear and coal power plants. The operation of nuclear power plants is
quite inflexible and that of coal power plants is flexible only within a narrow range.
We discussed earlier the need for adjusting power output for load following and for satisfy￾ing peak demand. In addition to these duties, in order to enhance the reliability of the grid,
a number of generators are operated at partial load with their surplus megawatts available
to ensure reliability under rapid changes on demand (frequency regulation) or an unplanned
outage of a unit or a transmission line (contingency reserves). Frequency and contingency
reserves operating at partial load are called spinning reserves. There are also units that pro￾vide grid stability (voltage, frequency, and reactive power). Overall, a number of generators
operate at partial load account for the functions of load following, frequency regulation,
and spinning reserves. Wind and solar penetration into a power system displaces genera￾tion from conventional units, and often their combination can increase such displacement.
Figure 7.9 shows a result from simulations based on hourly wind, solar, and load data in NY
state.10 The figure shows the load, solar photovoltaics (PV), and wind outputs for a summer
day where a peak of the load for that year occurred; it is shown that wind and PV together
serve the load better than each of them separately. From a utility’s perspective, the main
advantages of this penetration are fuel economy, emissions reduction, and reduced need for
increasing overall system capacity (Figure 7.10).
The limit of the penetration of renewable energy into an electricity grid depends on the mix
of generators in the system. As described previously, there are two main types of generators:
Inflexible baseload units and the more flexible cycling units. The former units are designed
to operate at full output, and they often provide most of the winter demand or 35–40% of
the annual peak capacity. The penetration of wind- and solar power cannot drive the net
load below the limit imposed by the number and the type of baseload generators, and the
amount and type of reserves. This limit depends on the ability of conventional baseload gen￾erators to reduce significantly their output, and on economic- and mechanical constraints. MW

Figure 7.10 Effect of grid flexibility on PV energy delivery.
For example, coal plants can vary their output from full-to-half-capacity, but if this is done
frequently, it would demand costly maintenance. (The flexibility limit that separates the
flexible from the inflexible capacity and, hence, the flexibility of a system is defined as the
percentage of the annual peak capacity that is flexible.)
High levels of wind- and solar-energy penetration may stress the system because of its flex￾ibility limit; there will be hours throughout the year where the net load is brought below
it. Then, the amount of energy below the flexibility limit cannot be absorbed and must be
curtailed. This is more of a problem for incorporating wind power than solar power, since
winds are stronger during the night when the load levels are low. The more flexible a power
system is, the higher is the penetration achievable, and the less restraint on renewable elec￾tricity. The amount of energy to be cut back can be determined with a cost analysis; often it
makes economic sense to curtail small amounts of energy as a trade-off in penetration.
The irregularity of renewable resources and the limit on the grid’s flexibility both pose restric￾tions on the maximum penetration achievable in a system. There are some interesting find￾ings on the maximum wind energy penetration that can be realized without storage. For
example, in Texas during 2021, wind provided 24.8% of the annual demand, while a maxi￾mum of 66.5% penetration on March 22, 2021.11
7.10 Are 100% renewable energy grids feasible?
We should note that some countries already meet or come close to achieving this goal.
Iceland, for example, supplies 100% of its electricity needs with either geothermal or
hydropower. Hydropower is the major power resources in Norway (97%), Brazil (76%),
and Canada (62%). However, most good sites for large hydropower resources have already
been developed. So how do other areas achieve 100% renewable grids? For this, variable
renewable energy (VRE), thus wind and solar, would have to be the major contributors and
the grid. This has happened already, but only occasionally. For example, South Australia

experienced times in October with 100% of the demand served with only solar; mostly
distributed roof-top solar! (Figure 7.11).
Of course, as the solar resource is intermittent, such an aspirational goal can only be satisfied
with a mixture of renewable energies.
It is possible that variable renewable generation technologies will continue to dominate the
newly installed generation capacity over the next two decades, spurring a transition to 100%
renewable-based power networks with a substantially altered landscape for the associated
planning, management, stability, and control approaches.12 More and more countries are set￾ting net-zero emission targets, and in most countries, this means 100% RE supply. Sixty-one
countries across the world have set 100% RE targets for at least their power sector. Denmark
has set the target to reach 100% renewables across all energy sectors by 2050. In most tran￾sition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of
a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures. Cost-optimization
modeling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares,
while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contri￾butions. Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid con￾gestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying
power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide
removal (CDR) approaches.12
One of the main challenges pertaining to the integration of VRE resources into power net￾works is that they are integrated with a power electronic interface known as an inverter;
they are therefore commonly referred to as inverter-based resources (IBRs). This stands in
contrast to most conventional power plants where electricity is generated using synchronous
generators. The task of the ISO is to unify the operation of synchronous machines and IBRs
at all scales.13
7.11 Grid reliability
The second main impact of wind energy on a large grid network concerns medium
to long-term system reliability. Planners aim for a safety margin in total grid capacity
compared with anticipated peak loads, allowing for unexpected surges in demand and
294

forced outages of large power plants. Unlike short-term system balancing, they must
often look 15 or 20 years ahead, taking into account predicted growth in demand and the
retirement of plants reaching the end of their working lives. The system margin, also called
the planning reserve, is essentially concerned with strategic planning of generating capacity
to ensure security of supply in the future – in popular parlance, “to prevent the lights
going out.”
No electricity system is 100% reliable because there is always a small chance of failures in
power plants and transmission networks, especially when the demand is high. Even a sub￾stantial system margin cannot give an absolute guarantee of reliability. There is, very roughly,
a 10% chance of a conventional power plant, fossil fuel or nuclear, being out of action at any
particular moment, and in a worst-case scenario, the loss of a major plant can produce a
domino effect on the whole system. For example, in 2003, there was a massive blackout in
the northeastern USA caused by cascading power outages – and it had nothing to do with
wind energy. In 2008, seven large UK power plants, including one nuclear station, unex￾pectedly shut down causing widespread power cuts described by one industry executive as a
“gigantic coincidence” – which had nothing to do with wind energy – and the same nuclear
plant was offline for more than 6 months in 2010. Given such uncertainties, planners must
aim for a margin that represents a sensible compromise between reliability and cost, taking
account of the existing and anticipated generation mix, including wind. The UKERC report
discusses modeling this complex situation with a measure known as the loss of load proba￾bility (LOLP) – the probability that, at any time in the future, the system will be unable to
satisfy demand.
The capacity credit for any type of generation is effectively a measure of the contribution it
can make to system reliability and is normally expressed as a percentage of installed capacity.
In the case of wind, this figure is predicted by the report to be approximately 20–30% in
British conditions, assuming generation reaches 20% of total demand, and acknowledging
the fact that peaks in wind power do not generally coincide with peaks in demand.
It is clear that wind capacity cannot displace conventional generation on a one-for-one basis,
either for short-term system balancing or for longer-term system reliability. But taking an
overall view, the international consensus among today’s planners and system engineers is that
large modern grid networks can accept up to 20% of renewable generation, including wind
energy, without serious technical or operational problems, and that any difficulties arising
tend to be managerial and organizational, requiring a shift of mind set away from the large
centralized generation of the 20th century toward something more diverse and flexible in the
21st century.
This sounds optimistic and reassuring, yet there remains a lingering doubt about how much
capacity credit should be given to wind generation, and what backup should be provided
to cope with exceptional circumstances. As noted above, no grid system can ever be 100%
reliable and wind energy simply adds its own element of uncertainty. The LOLP may be
reduced to a very low level, but it can never reach zero – that is in the nature of engineering
systems. So we will end with a story, an imagined scenario that might just conceivably occur
in the not-too-distant future.
By the 2030s the countries of northwest Europe, linked by a North Sea Supergrid,
have become used to trading offshore wind power according to where the wind blows
strongest over the sea’s vast stretches. It is rare for the winds to die simultaneously
over the whole of the North Sea. But in the freezing winter of 2035, by which time the
supergrid interconnects 120 GW of offshore wind capacity, a freak high pressure system

settles over the North Sea for two weeks, virtually killing all winds. At the same time the
hydroelectric reservoirs of Norway and Scotland have become unusually depleted; four
large UK nuclear power plants are shut down for safety checks; and a trade dispute has
severely reduced imported supplies of gas and oil from the Middle East. On 9th February
vast numbers of Europeans decide to watch a momentous international football match
on TV, and at half-time 10 million households switch on electric kettles to brew tea and
coffee. The lights (and the TV’s) go out – and do not come back on again for some
considerable time.
Fact or fantasy; a miniscule risk to be ignored, or a significant one to be planned for? How
often will extreme “low-wind” events occur, and how long will they last? These are big unan￾swered questions for wind energy, and only time will tell. We are back to the sort of statistics
pioneered by Tippett and Gumbel (see Section 2.2.2) who considered the probabilities and
return times of extremely unlikely events. In the meantime, we would surely be wise to under￾state the capacity credit of wind generation and diversify our energy supplies as much as
possible, accepting that no sources can ever be completely reliable. And maybe, by 2035,
all European consumers will be connected to electricity grids by very smart meters, utilities
will vary the price of electricity hour by hour to control demand, and international football
matches will have gone out of fashion.
7.12 The grid of the future
Technology advancements made it easier to deploy distributed variable renewable resources
(DVRE). The integration of DVRE and distributed grids can increase efficiencies in the use
of the existing grid as well as become part of the overall development strategy to balance
supply and demand uncertainties and risks with a variety of different resources, assuring
resilient, flexible, and safe power delivery to consumers. Furthermore, innovative changes
to the regulatory climate will also affect paradigms of the electric power business.14 The
reregulation of electric power industries in the USA and elsewhere introduced wholesale
electric markets. The advent of markets and environmental policies prompted significant
changes in the fuel mix of generating stations that shifted from coal and nuclear generation
to efficient natural-gas-fired combined cycle units. Recent developments include the advent
of retail access offering more consumer choices and business opportunities as the internet
facilitates more customer choices. Utility customers who own solar and wind systems are
increasingly using the grid as a means to balance their own generation and demand and also
as a backup supplier when their locally source generation is unavailable. More and more
customers are becoming prosumers and expect to deliver excess generation back to the grid
and be paid for it, without restrictions on their production. However, customers still expect
the grid to be available to provide power when they need it. New applications of power
electronics, such as smart inverters that can actively interact with the distribution system,
facilitate a more efficient DVRE grid integration.14

7.3 A small WT generator (single phase) produces a 60 Hz voltage at 100 V rms. The out￾put of the generator is connected to a diode bridge full-wave rectifier, which produces a
fluctuating DC voltage. What is the average DC voltage? A silicon-controlled rectifier
(SCR) is substituted for the diode rectifier. Under one condition the SCRs are turned
on at 45∘ after the beginning of each half cycle. What is the average DC voltage in that
case?
7.4 The parameters of an induction machine can be estimated from “no-load” and
“blocked-rotor” tests. In both tests, voltage, current, and power are measured. Under
the no-load test, the rated voltage is applied to the machine, and it is allowed to run
at no load (i.e., with nothing connected to the shaft). Under these conditions, the slip
is essentially equal to 0, and the loop with the rotor parameters may be ignored; the
magnetizing reactance accounts for most of the impedance. In the blocked-rotor test,
the rotor is prevented from turning and a reduced voltage is applied to the terminals
of the machine. Thus, the slip is equal to 1.0 so the magnetizing reactance can be
ignored, and the impedance of the leakage parameters can be determined. A third test
can be used to estimate the windage and friction losses. In this test, the machine being
tested is driven by a second machine, but it is not connected to the power system.
The power of the second machine is measured, and from that value is subtracted the
latter’s no-load power. The difference is approximately equal to the test machine’s
windage and friction.
In a simplified version of the analysis, all of the leakage terms may be assumed to be
on the same side of the mutual inductance, as shown as the above figure. In addition,
the resistance in parallel with the magnetizing reactance is assumed to be infinite, and
the stator and rotor resistances, RS and RR
′
, are assumed to be equal to each other
and the leakage inductances are also assumed to be equal to each other.

8 Wind energy growth and
sustainability (cost, resources,
environment)
During 2000–2020, the wind energy contribution to electricity grids enjoyed an average
growth of ∼30% per year; this growth recently slowed down but still annual growth of about
10% is projected till midcentury. Is further growth sustainable and what is the maximum level
it could reach in the foreseeable future? To answer this question, we need to reflect on what
sustainable development is all about. Think of it as “development that meets the needs of
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”
Wind turbines (WTs), as fuel-free energy sources, are inherently sustainable unless they are
too expensive to produce, are manufactured using materials that are depletable, or are envi￾ronmentally unsafe. Measurable aspects of sustainability include cost, resource availability,
and environmental impact. The question of cost concerns the affordability of wind energy
compared to other energy sources throughout the world. Environmental impacts include
local, regional, and global effects, as well as the usage of land and water, which must be
considered in a comparable context over a long, multigenerational horizon. Finally, the avail￾ability of material resources matters to current and future generations under the constraint
of affordability. More concisely, wind energy must meet the need for generating abundant
electricity at competitive costs while conserving resources for future generations and having
environmental impacts much lower than those of conventional modes of power generation,
preferably lower than those of alternative future energy options (Figure 8.1).

and Lynn P.A, Electricity from Sunlight: Photovoltaics Systems Integration and Sustainability, Wiley, 2nd
edition, 2018.).
8.1 Affordability
8.1.1 Upfront capital and installation costs
In the previous chapters, we explored the technical aspects of large grid-connected wind
turbines—the principles underpinning their design and the engineering needed to ensure safe
and reliable operation. We also covered the technical criteria that determine the efficiency of
turbines at capturing the wind and generating electricity, criteria that have a major impact
on the viability of wind energy projects. It is now time to give a brief introduction to wind
energy economics, and we start with a key question: how much do large horizontal axis
wind turbines (HAWTs) cost to purchase and install, both onshore and offshore, and how
are costs likely to change in the coming years?
The question may seem obvious, but the answer is far less so, for various reasons including:
■ Large HAWTs are undergoing continuous development with improvements in design,
operating efficiency, and manufacturing methods.
■ Installation costs are site-dependent, and generally offshore installations are more
expensive than onshore.
■ Large wind farms tend to be much more cost-effective than individual turbines or
small groups of turbines.
■ Countries such as China and India have burgeoning wind energy industries and will
increasingly look to export markets, where their products are likely to prove very com￾petitive.
Before getting down to detail, it is helpful to consider a general feature of manufactured
products in a growth industry—the tendency for prices to fall systematically as cumulative
production rises, in accordance with the learning curve concept. Price reductions occur
partly as a result of “learning-by-doing”—people get better at making things as they become
more experienced, partly due to the introduction of new designs, techniques, and better

utilization of materials, and partly due to the benefits of scale. The long experience of many
industries has shown that prices tend to drop between 10 and 30% in real terms for every
doubling of cumulative production. For mature technologies such as steel construction or
electric motors, each doubling, given the very high current production levels, may require
decades; but for relatively new technologies undergoing rapid expansion, doublings of
cumulative production occur over much shorter time scales. As production levels soar,
prices are driven down.
How does the modern wind energy industry fit this scenario? Certainly, it has been devel￾oping at a remarkable rate, with global installed capacity rising by around 30% per annum,
corresponding to a doubling about every 3 years). In spite of occasional hiccups including
the global economic crisis in 2008 and the inflation and supply chain challenges due to Covid
and the war in Ukraine in recent years, the signs for continued growth are very positive. The
slope of the learning curve—the rate at which prices are expected to fall—depends on the
maturity of wind energy’s contributing technologies including steel foundations and towers,
rotor blades, gearboxes, generators, transmission cables, electronic power converters, and
control systems. Clearly, some of these are more innovative than others. It also depends
on changes to the basic product. The average size of grid-connected HAWTs continues to
increase, and cumulative global production is bolstered not only by more turbines but also
by bigger ones. It is cheaper to install and interconnect a small number of large turbines on a
wind farm than a large number of small ones. The combined effects of “learning-by-doing”
and increasing turbine sizes caused costs to fall by about 15% for every doubling of global
cumulative capacity between 1982 and 2020.1
8.1.1.1 Onshore wind turbines
It is difficult to give actual cost figures. Manufacturers’ turbine prices are often confidential
and vary with the number of units ordered. Installation costs depend on many factors
including wind farm size, the amount of site preparation and cabling, and the difficulty
of grid connection. As a rough guide, average wind farm costs per installed megawatt
are currently of the order of 1 million US dollars onshore and 2 million US dollars
offshore—and, as discussed above, are expected to reduce steadily in real terms as time
goes by.
Figure 8.2 shows typical cost breakdowns under four headings. Starting with the onshore
case:
■ Turbines (t). The turbines typically account for about two-thirds (66%) of total
installed costs.
■ Electrical (e). On-site cabling, substation equipment, and grid connection account for
about 14%.
■ Civil (c). Civil engineering works including site access and preparation, turbine foun￾dations, and buildings account for about 12%.
■ Other (o). The remaining 8% covers other items such as project management, legal
costs, and insurance.
The percentages vary considerably between sites according to geography, soil conditions, the
need for access roads, proximity to a suitable grid connection point, and so on. The figure
should therefore be taken simply as an approximate guide.

8.1.1.2 Offshore wind turbines
Offshore wind has really taken off in the new millennium and is currently undergoing rapid
expansion. Its technology is generally similar to that of onshore wind, but there are impor￾tant differences involving foundations, weather protection, and undersea cabling. Capital
and installation costs per rated MW have often been quoted as almost double those of
onshore wind, but it seems very likely that the learning curve for offshore wind will outpace
that for onshore wind in the near future, bringing their costs closer together. And we must
always bear in mind that offshore turbines generally work at higher capacity factors (CFs),
producing more electricity per megawatt of installed capacity. Because the total project cost
is much higher, the contribution of turbine costs is generally much lower—typically nearer
one-third of the total. Electrical costs (including undersea cabling and substations) and civil
costs (including foundations) are relatively high, and other costs must cover more complex
planning and project management, the hire and scheduling of jack-up barges, cable laying
and support vessels, and increased insurance charges. The detailed cost breakdown is again
dependent on on-site conditions, including distance to shore.
Offshore wind farm development is a technically complex, lengthy, risky, and capital￾intensive process, primarily because of the more demanding operations over the sea. In
order to assess the economics of an offshore wind farm, it is essential to consider three
phases: investment, operation, and decommissioning. The investment phase includes the
development, design, and fabrication of all the components and their installation and is the
most capital-intensive.
The investment phase can last up to 9 years, with most of this time spent in planning and
obtaining consent—activities that can take up to 5 years on their own. After the investment,
the wind farms are expected to produce electricity to the grid for at least 20–30 years. During
this operation phase, regular maintenance is required to keep the downtime minimum and
prolong the life span of the whole project. Details of operation and maintenance (O&M)

statistics and protocols are discussed in Chapter 6. When the operation phase is over, there
is the decommissioning phase where there can be two options: either the entire project is
dismantled and disposed of, which marks the end of the farm’s life cycle, or the farm is
repowered with new turbines and a new life cycle begins. The life cycle of an offshore wind
farm (along with all the different phases) is illustrated in Figure 8.3.
The total cost of the offshore wind farm can be divided into two fundamental cost categories:
capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX). In general, CAPEX is
defined as the initial one-time expenditure required to build an income-generating asset and
achieve its commercial operation. On the other hand, OPEX can be defined as the ongoing
cost, either once or recurring, associated with the operation of the asset. Both can further
be divided into more detailed costs. For example, CAPEX can be divided into three main
categories. These are the turbine costs (including all the wind turbine components), the
construction costs (including foundation, electrical infrastructure, assembly, and installa￾tion costs), and the development costs (including the planning, insurance, construction and
contingency financing, and decommissioning costs). Similarly, OPEX includes two main
categories of costs, which are the operation and the maintenance costs. In a typical project,
the contribution of these two costs toward the total cost is approximately 75% for CAPEX
and 25% for OPEX.
8.1.1.2.1 Cost reduction
The onshore wind industry has been able to benefit from many years of cost reduction, unlike
the offshore that has only just started. For the UK, the reduction of cost is remarkable:
levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore wind reduced from £160/MWh to £44.00/MWh.
The main way to reduce the costs associated with offshore wind energy will be by utilizing
efficiently the inherent advantages of offshore wind, but at the same time minimizing the
cost disadvantages. In other words, the wind farms on the one hand must gain access to sites
further from shore and consequently in deeper waters, where the wind is faster and more

consistent, and on the other hand, they should achieve a significant cost reduction. Cost
reduction is possible through the optimization of the key components and installation and
maintenance activities of a wind farm. These key components and processes and some of
the ways to increase their cost-effectiveness are described below:
(1) Wind turbines. These alone make up approximately 30–35% of the capital cost of the
whole project. Therefore, their optimization is a key driver to the cost reduction of
offshore wind power. Up-to-date, offshore wind turbines are typically modified ver￾sions of the largest onshore turbines, suitable for high-CFs. Since they are not designed
specifically for the harsh conditions over the sea, reliability issues arise that often lead
to significant downtime, in other words, lower power generation. If the turbines are
located further from shore, the downtime may be even larger, as the maintenance oper￾ations are more challenging. Consequently, the main way to reduce these issues is to
improve wind turbine technology. Technology is already being developed for improved
generators with direct-drive, gearless nacelles, and high-power output (e.g., >12 MW)
(Figure 8.4). There are also significant improvements that can reduce manufacturing
and assembly costs, based on the optimization of the supply chain and the standard￾ization of components.
(2) Foundations of turbines. Foundations make up approximately 20–25% of the capital
cost of offshore wind and reflect the second most expensive part of the whole project,
after the actual turbines. Currently, approximately 80% of the foundations used in wind
farms are monopiles. However, this type of foundation cannot be used beyond 30-m
water depths, and it is not considered economical for larger output wind turbines. As the
offshore industry is trying to exploit the higher wind speeds far from shore, new types
of foundations such as tripods and jacket structures are being considered. For water
depths beyond 60 m, floating foundations are being developed. There are also significant
opportunities to reduce foundation costs through economies of scale, reduced materials
costs, and the development of new installation techniques.

(3) Electrical connections. There are two different types of connections: the high-voltage
alternating current (HVAC) and the high-voltage direct current (HVDC). The main
parameters to consider, when choosing connections, are the rated power and the dis￾tance to shore. Currently, most offshore wind farms use HVAC type of connections,
and only 14% use HVDC. However, as the offshore farms move further from shore,
the HVDC technology is likely to be a necessity because they have less transmission
losses for longer distances. More details on HVDC connections are given in Sections 4.6
and 7.9.2.
(4) Installation. The offshore wind installation techniques have not yet been optimized for
high volumes and speeds. For water depths up to 35 m, foundations and turbines are
installed with the use of standard jack-up barges, but for deeper waters and larger tur￾bines, special installation vessels may be needed. Therefore, more opportunities should
emerge for wind turbines, foundations, and grid connections to be designed to optimize
and reduce the cost of the installation process.
(5) O&M. The unexpected repairs arising from reliability issues of the turbines can signifi￾cantly increase the OPEX cost. Therefore, unscheduled repairs should be minimized
by increasing the reliability of wind turbines. In addition, the cost of maintenance
can be reduced by the application of remote monitoring and with systems that allow
access and repairs in adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, future repairs could be
conducted from offshore accommodation facilities, in a similar manner to oil rigs. This
could leverage the economies of scale from a collection of large offshore wind farms
and significantly reduce travel times, downtime, and thus cost.
In Section 8.1.2, we consider the additional costs incurred over a wind farm’s operational
lifetime and the income generated by the production of electricity.
8.1.2 Operation, maintenance, and cash flow
The economic success of a wind farm depends upon recovering its costs and making a profit
by selling electricity over its working lifetime. Capital and installation costs are “up front”
and the fuel is free, but there are ongoing O&M charges spread over many years, and the
whole project must be financed. In many ways, the production and selling of electricity from
the wind are just like any other business.
One quick way of assessing viability is to estimate the simple payback period (SPP), the
number of years it takes to recoup the initial investment. This is found by dividing total costs
by the average annual income expected from the electricity generated. Another approach
is to estimate the cost of energy (COE) equal to total costs divided by the system’s total
expected energy production. However, SPP and COE calculations give only crude estimates
of profitability because they fail to allow for the timescales over which costs are incurred and
income is generated.
A more accurate approach known aslife-cycle costing2 is illustrated in Figure 8.5. This shows
the cash flowsthat occur as costs arise and income is generated over the lifetime of the project,
say 20 years. Negative cash flows (costs) are shown in orange; positive ones (income) are
shown in blue. A major feature of wind energy, like other forms of renewable energy, is that
the initial capital and installation costs (A) produce by far the largest negative cash flow. This
is followed by many years of smaller negative flows to cover operation, maintenance, and,

assuming the project is financed by a bank, interest payments on the loan. As the turbines
and other equipment approach the end of their working lives, routine maintenance costs tend
to rise and further cash injections (B, C) may be needed to repair or replace major worn-out
components.
Offsetting the negative cash flows is the income generated, year on year, by selling electricity
(shown in blue). The trend is shown upward on the assumption, generally held by energy
experts, that electricity prices will continue to rise in real terms over the coming decades.
A key advantage of life-cycle analysis (LCA) over SPP and COE estimates is that it acknowl￾edges the time value of money—a major consideration for a long-term project. In a nutshell,
the cash flow expected in the future should not be given the same monetary value today. To
relate this to personal experience, would you rather have 100 dollars today, or the expecta￾tion of 150 dollars in 10 years’ time? Your answer will probably depend on predicting future
interest rates (you could put the money in the bank), or the confidence you have about future
payments, or you may prefer to purchase something for 100 dollars today. Life-cycle costing
analysis takes the time value of money into account by referring all future cash flows to their
equivalent in today’s money using a discount rate. This is the rate above general inflation at
which money could be invested elsewhere—say between 1 and 5%. In this way, the present
worth of a complete long-term project can be estimated, and compared with alternatives,
allowing for a more realistic investment decision to be made. A positive value of present
worth is generally taken as a good indication of economic viability.
So far so good, provided we recognize that investment decisions based on LCA make many
assumptions about costs, technical performance, system and component lifetimes, interest
rates, and the future price of electricity. Figure 8.5 looks simple enough, but it is hard to put
accurate numbers against the various items. In the case of wind energy, uncertainties arise
under several headings:
■ Initial costs. Although the capital costs of turbines and equipment are based on firm
prices quoted by manufacturers, installation costs are harder to predict. For example,
308

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseWind energy growth and sustainability (cost, resources, environment)
unforeseen difficulties may arise with turbine foundations or cable laying, and progress
may be delayed by bad weather, especially offshore.
■ O&M. Annual costs for operating and maintaining large HAWTs typically amount to
around 2% of initial capital costs. Wind farm costs include items such as insurance,
taxes, and land rental; and maintenance includes periodic inspections, testing, and
blade cleaning. Offshore maintenance is generally more expensive than onshore. As a
wind farm ages, occasional replacement or repair of major components becomes more
likely but is very hard to predict. Over the life of a wind farm, O&M costs have a major
influence on profitability.
■ Technical performance and reliability. Wind farm income is derived entirely from the
electricity generated over its working lifetime. As we have seen in previous chapters,
the wind regime at the chosen site and the technical performance of the turbines
are key determinants. The cubic relationship between wind speed and power means
that annual electricity production is affected by quite small changes in average wind
speed. The “availability” of turbines—the percentage time they are able to generate
electricity—should clearly be as high as possible, but occasional downtime for
unscheduled maintenance and repair is inevitable.
■ Value of wind-generated electricity. Wind energy’s value to an electric utility is usually
assessed in terms of “avoided costs,” the savings in fuel costs (FCs) of alternative gen￾eration, and the reduced need for alternative capacity. As far as a wind farm operator is
concerned, the “fuel” is free, and it makes sense to sell wind energy at almost any price
rather than waste it. In today’s increasingly deregulated energy markets, where elec￾tricity is traded as a commodity, the tension between these viewpoints is supposed to
lead to contracts between “willing buyers” and “willing sellers” at mutually accept￾able prices. However, the whole area of electricity pricing, present and future, and
the income that wind farms can expect are heavily influenced by government policies
toward renewable energy. For example, legislation in Germany requires grid opera￾tors to buy all renewable electricity produced within their supply areas at guaranteed
minimum prices, giving considerable stability. Conversely, changes in policy, particu￾larly of the stop–go variety, breed uncertainty, and loss of confidence. And finally, the
economics of a wind farm depend greatly on how long it lasts. If it can continue gener￾ating for a few years longer than originally planned, with modest maintenance costs,
the extra income becomes a pure bonus.
8.1.2.1 Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
So far so good, provided we recognize that the decision, even when based on careful life-cycle
cost analysis, contains uncertainties about technical performance, system and component
lifetimes, interest rates, and the future price of electricity. The investment on a commercial
or industrial system carries less uncertainty as it is often linked with a power purchase agree￾ment (PPA) with a utility that guarantees revenue which, over the course of the investment
period, carries all initial and recurrent expenses. Wind as well as other renewable energy sys￾tems may have a high upfront cost, but they use free “fuel” during the many years they
operate. On the other hand, the operating costs of coal and natural gas-burning power
plants are high and uncertain as they depend on the price and availability of fuel. Thus,
to compare the COE technologies with different operating conditions, we need to sum up
the capital and operating costs and assign them to the amount of electricity produced over
309

a period of time. For this purpose, the LCOE is defined as a constant unit cost, per kWh
or MWh, of a payment stream over a period of time, which has the same present value as
the total cost of constructing and operating a power generating plant over its life. It rep￾resents the constant level of revenue necessary each year to recover all expenses over the
life of a power plant. In simple words, LCOE represents the total life-cycle cost divided
by the revenue from the total lifetime electricity production. The costs include the initial
capital investment and the lifetime operating expenses, less the end-of-life value discounted
into the present value. The revenue from energy production depends on the location (wind
resource), the performance ratio, and the life of the system. An important constituent in
the LCOE is the cost of financing (debt service) of the relatively high equity investment
needed upfront. The schematic in Figure 8.6 illustrates this concept. The cost of financing
is linked to the real and/or perceived risk of the asset. Long-term PPA with utilities and
government feed-in-tariff programs reduce the risk to investors. Deployment of wind power
plants removes the uncertainty of fuel supply and prices.

We summarized the ideas behind conventional life-cycle cost analysis, with its positive and
negative cash flows and levelized cost of electricity that averages all costs over a certain
period. But what if the economics are affected by a government decision to offer capital
grants to offset the initial purchase price, or suddenly to change or terminate grants that are
presently available? And what if the price paid for renewable electricity is bolstered by spe￾cial tariffs that may be altered or removed by a change of government? Over the years, there
have been many such stop–go incidents in countries as wide apart as Australia, Spain, and
the USA. One of the biggest threats to rational decision-making and steady growth in the
wind energy market is uncertainty about government policy, and one of the biggest benefits
is consistent long-term support.
You may be wondering why governments offer financial support to wind energy in the first
place. There are two principal reasons. First, the products of a new high-tech industry tend
to be very expensive at the start, before cumulative production gathers pace. If governments
wish to pursue urgent policy objectives such as the reduction of carbon emissions, they may
decide to stimulate market development with financial incentives. Second, Figure 8.6 makes
clear that wind, like other renewable energy technologies including solar and wave, has
its major costs “up front,” with no fuel charges. This is quite different than conventional
electricity generation based on fossil fuels. Projects with high initial costs that must be set
against future income are commonplace for large corporations but tend to be far more
problematic for small businesses, organizations, and individuals who find it hard to raise
the initial capital.
Our short excursion into economics has taken no account of the environmental issues that,
in many people’s minds, are just as important as the business concerns of financiers and
accountants. We now turn our attention to resource availability and environmental issues,
which form some of the main justifications—and raise a few doubts—surrounding the mod￾ern renaissance of wind energy.
8.2 Resource availability
The main environmental credentials of wind energy are established beyond doubt: its impor￾tant contribution to reducing carbon emissions, cleanliness in operation, lack of spent fuel
or waste, and general public acceptability in terms of visual impact. We have already referred
to such advantages at various points in this book. But there are further environmental
considerations as wind energy accelerates into multi-gigawatt annual production—can
Planet Earth provide the necessary quantities of raw materials, and are there any con￾flicts with the use of land or water for the hundreds of thousands of wind turbines that
are needed for a significant contribution of wind energy in climate change mitigation
scenarios?
This merits consideration of primary resources and of the potential to reuse/recycle them.

8.2.1 Raw material primary resources
The main wind turbine materials are steel, aluminum, composites, polymers, cast iron, and
rare earth elements (REEs). The inland turbine foundation uses concrete and transmission
lines use copper. A recent National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) study lists the
material breakdowns in modern wind turbines.3 As shown in Figure 8.7, current land-based
wind power plants require about 1200 metric tons (t) of material per megawatt, composed
(by mass) of approximately 53% road aggregate, 34% concrete, 9% steel, 2% composites
and polymers, 1% cast iron, and 1% other materials. Future land-based wind plants may
contain a larger proportion of concrete due to bigger foundations required for larger and
taller turbines. These changes could shift the material breakdown of the future land-based
wind plants by mass to 46% concrete, 39% road aggregate, 10% steel, 3% composites and
polymers, 1% cast iron, and 1% other materials. Offshore wind plants currently require
about 300 metric tons of material per megawatt, composed (by mass) of 87% steel, 5% other
metals (e.g., Al and Ni) and their alloys, 4% composites and polymers, 3% cast iron, and
1% other materials.
The same NREL study indicates that in a high deployment scenario, there are six types of
materials that exceed 20% of the current US production, namely, carbon fiber, electrical steel,

aluminum, cobalt, nickel, and REE (i.e., dysprosium, neodymium, and praseodymium).
Their use is expected to increase because the entire renewable energy industry is experiencing
high growth. The issue with aluminum and steel is more related to the energy used in their
manufacture, whereas increasing the supply of composite materials used in blades and REE
used in permanent magnets has additional environmental impacts.
8.2.1.1 Blades
Blades are made mainly of carbon fiber, fiberglass, and balsa wood, and the wind industry
drives a significant portion of global demand for these materials. As reported by the Union
of Concerned Scientists demand for balsa wood outstripped supply in 2020. The supply is
highly concentrated in Ecuador and Peru, and its high demand in the wind industry may
have increased Amazon rainforest logging.1
8.2.1.2 Rare earth elements (REE)
Let us now discuss the production of REE. REE are relatively plentiful in the entire Earth’s
crust, but they are contained in only trace concentrations in mineral ores, and to obtain rare
earths at usable purity requires processing enormous amounts of raw ore, thus the name
“rare” earths (Wikipedia, 2024. https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_element).
The list includes the Lanthanides [atomic numbers (57–71), Yttrium (21), and Scandium
(39), Table 8.1]. The diverse nuclear, metallurgical, chemical, catalytic, electrical, magnetic,
and optical properties of the REE have led to a variety of applications. Among this group,
the key elements for clean energy technologies are neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium,
and terbium, used to manufacture neodymium–iron–boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets
which are components in generators for wind turbines and in traction motors for electric
vehicles. Most land-based turbines use an electromagnetic generator, in which copper
coils rotate through a magnetic field to produce electricity. But another option, popular
in offshore wind, is a permanent magnet generator, which contains a ring of brick-shaped
rare Earth magnets that spin with the rotor to produce electricity. With such magnets,
offshore wind turbines can be directly driven, avoiding the high maintenance gear boxes.
Neodymium and praseodymium strengthen the magnet, while dysprosium and terbium
make it resistant to demagnetization at high temperatures. A large wind turbine uses about
1.5 metric tons of these REEs. The World Bank predicts that the demand for neodymium
for energy technologies in 2050 will be 37% of total 2018 neodymium production. Global
demand for neodymium for wind turbines is estimated to increase 48% by 2050. The
economic development of REE mineral deposits presents challenges as they are in low
concentrations in ores of multicomponent minerals.

The USA is currently the second largest producer of REE-containing minerals after China,
with US production2 totaling 16% of global production compared to China’s 58%. However,
most ore extracted from US sources is exported for processing, and US consumption of REE
relies heavily on imports; China provides 80% of US REE imports. Although recycling REE
technologies exist, secondary production has not yet matured, and all commercial-scale US
consumption of REE comes from primary sources.
There are many opportunities for innovation to change material requirements for wind
energy. In general, such opportunities involve material substitution, weight reduction,
lifetime extension, component reuse, and material recycling.
8.2.2 Wind turbine decommissioning
An obvious question is what is the fate of a wind turbine at the end of its productive life? The
first step will be to decommission the turbine, and this may be more challenging in offshore
than in onshore projects, so in this section, we present the decommissioning steps involved
in decommissioning one of the early projects, the Lely Wind Farm (Netherlands) where the
monopile foundations were also removed. Typically, the piles are cut below the seabed, at an
appropriate distance; often this distance is around 3 m below the natural seabed. Figure 8.8
shows the photos of step-by-step decommissions, and they are self-explanatory.4
The Lely Wind Farm (four 2-MW turbines in the Ijsselmeer, located approximately 800 m
offshore) built in 1992 generated electricity for 24 years and was fully decommissioned in
2017. Crane barges and tugs were used to dismantle the turbines and tower sections. The
monopiles were extracted using a vibratory hammer.
In this context, it is necessary to provide an overview of the current legislation on offshore
installations: For the UK, decommissioning of offshore structures is regulated by UK law
and by the OSPAR Decision 98/3 on the Disposal of Disused Offshore Installations; an
expansion of the law to cover offshore wind turbines is under discussion (https://oap.ospar
.org/en/ospar-assessments/quality-status-reports/qsr-2023/other-assessments/renewable￾energy/).
8.2.3 Wind turbine recycling
The good news is the steel, iron, aluminum, copper, and concrete can be completely recycled.
Recycling the blades and the REE-containing magnets is a greater challenge, as they are
made of different materials that need multistep separation and purification processes in order
to be recovered.
8.2.3.1 Blades
In 2021 in the USA, 8000 blades were retired. By 2050, the world may be getting 15–18% of
its energy from wind but may also have 43 million metric tons of retired blades to address.
Currently, most retired wind turbine blades end up in landfills. Although landfilling of blades

does not pose a threat of soil or groundwater contamination and would represent only a tiny
fraction of global solid waste streams, the life cycle of wind turbines would be more circular
if there were more options to reuse or recycle the blades. Innovative companies are employ￾ing repurposing and recycling technologies to help avoid that fate. Currently, these involve
mostly downcycling applications like shredding down fiberglass blades and turning them
into cement or textiles or railroad ties and plastic pellets; upcycling processes that will sep￾arate blade fibers from epoxy and use the epoxy in new blades are also under development.
In parallel, companies have also started to develop new, more recyclable blade technologies
with new types of blade epoxy resins.
The major western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are members of the
DecomBlades consortium announced in 2021, with the aim of developing recyclable wind
turbine blades, and as of 2023, they have started limited production of prototype recyclable
wind turbines. In parallel, important industry–university collaborations have been formed
to further pursue blade recycling.
A UK project between Aker Offshore Wind and the University of Strathclyde focuses on
commercializing a fiber-recovery method used to separate glass fibers from resin components
in composites and reprocess them. In the USA, the Carbon Rivers project, funded by the US
Department of Energy (DOE) in collaboration with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,
is scaling up a recovery process for wind turbine blade recycling that has the capability to
recycle fiberglass from 50,000 metric tons of blades annually.
8.2.3.2 Rare earth elements (REE)
Due to the high cost of separation and purification, currently only a small amount of REE
is recycled from end products, but recycling could help meet a large fraction of future
demand. Adding recycled rare earths as a new source to the supply chain is expected to
reduce environmental contamination and energy costs associated with their primary mining
and separations.
Recycling of REE is currently accomplished through a combination of processes, including
hydrometallurgy (acid leaching to extract rare earth oxides and salts), pyrometallurgy
(roasting and melting at high temperatures), or electrochemistry (using electricity to
separate materials based on their differing abilities to gain or lose electrons). In addition,
technologies using bacteria and microorganisms for absorbing REE from products are
under development.3
In summary, REE are crucial materials in wind turbine and automobile permanent
magnets as well as in many consumer products. These elements currently have a significant
environmental burden as consumer products are discarded into the trash. Recycling
rare-earth-containing products would provide a steady, domestic source of rare earths
to manufacturers while also reducing waste and the same applies to recycling composite
materials used in blades.
In general, recycling of wind turbine materials strengthens the three pillars of sustainabil￾ity for large wind turbine market growth; it provides an important secondary resource, it

Research on wind recycling is getting a new boost in the USA as the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act includes $40 million for such research. Consequently, on January
18, 2024, the US DOE announced funding of 20 projects of the first phase of a two-phases
Wind Turbine Materials Recycling Prize which was launched in July 2023 as part of the
American-Made Challenges Program.4
8.3 Environmental and social aspects
In Section 8.1, we considered the costs incurred, and the income generated, over the lifetime
of a wind farm—the classic approach to assessing a project’s economic viability. However,
this form of LCA ignores the environmental costs and benefits of wind generation that have
such important implications for global energy policy and society as a whole. It is now time
to paint with a broader brush and attempt a balanced account of the effects, negative as well
as positive, that wind energy has on the environment.
It is very important to realize that all methods of energy production—whether based on
coal, gas, oil, nuclear, or renewable sources—have environmental impacts that are ignored
by the traditional notion of “cost.” A narrow economic view of industrial processes assesses
everything in terms of money, ignoring other factors that common sense tells us should be
taken into account in any sensible appraisal of value. For example, the “cost” of generat￾ing electricity in nuclear power plants has traditionally been computed without taking any
account of accident or health risks or the need to store dangerous waste products safely for
thousands of years; in the case of coal-fired plants, without acknowledging their large and
unwelcome carbon dioxide emissions and health and safety effects to miners; and, in the
case of wind farms, without placing any value on landscape.
There are two main reasons for this apparent short-sightedness. First, aspects such as
health, safety, environmental protection, and the beauty of landscape cannot easily be
quantified and assessed within a traditional accounting framework. We all know they are
precious and, in many cases, at least as important to us as money, but appropriate tools and

methodologies for including them are only now being developed and accepted. It is surely
vital to do this because so many of our current problems and dissatisfactions are bound
up with the tendency of conventional accounting “to know the price of everything and the
value of nothing.”
The second reason relates to the important notion of external costs of energy generation.
These costs, which are mostly environmental or societal in nature, have traditionally been
treated as outside the energy economy and to be borne by society as a whole, either in mon￾etary terms by taxation or in environmental terms by a reduction in the “quality of life.”
They contrast with the internal costs of running a business—for plant and buildings, fuel,
materials, staff wages, and so on—that are paid directly by a company and affect its profits.
If Planet Earth is treated as an infinite “source” of raw materials and an infinite “sink” for
all pollution and waste products, it is rather easy to ignore external costs. For example, it
seems doubtful whether the 19th-century pioneers of steam locomotion ever worried about
burning huge quantities of coal or the 20th-century designers of supersonic civil airliners
about fuel efficiency and supersonic bangs. One of the positive changes now taking place is
the growing worldview that external costs should be worked into the equation—not just the
local or national one, but increasingly the global one. In other words, external costs should
be internalized and laid at the door of the responsible industry or company. In a nutshell,
“the polluter should pay.”
External and internal costs associated with industrial production are shown in Table 8.2.
The external ones, representing charges or burdens on society as a whole, are split into envi￾ronmental and societal categories, although there is quite a lot of overlap between them. You
can probably think of some extra ones. Internal costs, borne directly by the organization or
company itself, cover a wide range of goods and services.

The distinction between external and internal costs is somewhat clouded by the fact that
many items bought in by a company, for example, fuel and materials, have themselves
involved substantial external costs during manufacture and transport.
In the case of electricity generation, a proper analysis of the environmental burdens should
take account of all contributing processes “from cradle to grave,” whether conducted on￾or off-site. Needless to say, such an environmental LCA is a challenging task. One of the
special difficulties facing renewable generation, including wind energy, is that so many of its
advantage stems from the avoidance of external costs. They are therefore hidden by conven￾tional accounting methods. Renewables tend to produce very low carbon dioxide emissions,
cause little pollution, make little noise, create few hazards to life or property, and have wide
public support. Yet politicians and economists rarely mention the reduction or avoidance of
external costs as an advantage of wind energy. Fortunately, energy experts and advisers to
governments are taking increasing notice of environmental LCA and assessing the risks and
benefits of competing technologies on a more even footing.
Monetization of the external costs of energy life cycles, including those of renewable ener￾gies, is well-documented in reports by the National Research Council, the Harvard School of
Public Health, and others. These studies show the greatest health and environmental effects
in the life cycle of coal power generation are those from toxic air pollutants during com￾bustion, followed by the impacts of mining and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. More
specifically, the Harvard study estimated that the total external costs of coal-fired electricity
during extraction, transport, processing, and combustion are $345 billion or 18 cents/kWh
of electricity produced. These estimates are based on health costs, health insurance, and
damage costs that are not included in the electricity costs but are paid by society at large. If
these were fully accounted for, then the price of electricity from coal in the USA would have
been much higher than the LCOE from wind turbines. Carbon dioxide capture with carbon
sequestration (CCS) is advocated widely as enabling the continuation of coal burning for
power generation, but CCS, while reducing GHG emissions, will lead to increases in toxic
emissions and health, safety, and environmental (EHS) impacts in mining regions, as coal
consumption per unit of electricity output would increase. The same applies to the prolifer￾ation of natural gas from gas-shale resources, as hydraulic fracturing increases the impacts
of extracting gas on both the air and water pathways, and conversion to liquefied natural
gas (LNG) for exportation further increases the upstream safety risks.
Where does all this leave wind energy in its remarkable and seemingly unstoppable progress
toward 1000 GW of global installed capacity? We will start with the positive environmental
impacts.
To many governments around the world, and their citizens, the major environmental
benefit of wind power is the avoidance of the emissions caused by fossil-fuel power
plants—principally carbon dioxide, but also other polluting gases—and reduced risk of
climate change. Figures are widely quoted for individual turbines, wind farms, and nations.
For example, a well-sited 2-MW onshore HAWT in the UK is typically quoted as saving
about 1800 tons of CO2 per annum. The British Wind Energy Association estimated that the
UK’s total installed wind capacity of 5300 MW gave annual savings of around 5.9 million
tons of CO2 plus 140,000 tons of sulfur oxides and 41,000 tons of nitrogen oxides. However,
such calculations must depend on the energy mix of the country concerned and the types of
alternative generation that are being displaced. France, which produces around 75% of its
electricity in nuclear plants, and Norway, which approaches 100% hydroelectric generation,
are clearly very different from the UK. This is not to doubt the global benefits of wind

energy but simply to point out that claimed emission reductions should be interpreted in a
national context.
Further environmental benefits of wind energy include:
Fast energy payback. It takes energy to produce energy. All types of electricity generation
consume energy in the production of plants and buildings, and most subsequently
waste a lot of energy due to the low efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle. Wind farms
incur “imbedded” energy during turbine manufacture and installation, but typically
all this is paid back within 3–5 months by the electricity generated. This is detailed in
Section 8.6.
Energy diversity and security. Wind farms add to a nation’s energy diversity, reducing
dependence on other forms of generation including those relying on imported fuel
from areas of the world that are politically unstable. Wind farms are less vulnerable to
catastrophic accidents or terrorist attacks than large, centralized power plants, includ￾ing nuclear. Security of supply is best guaranteed by a broad energy mix and should
be considered an industrial and societal benefit rather than a strictly environmental
one.
Having outlined the main environmental benefits of wind energy, we are ready to address
some less comfortable issues—the potential negative impacts that, unless carefully handled,
can lead to a loss of public support.
8.4 Land use
Ground-mount wind farms occupy significant amounts of land. However, the space
between wind turbines can be used for other applications. Data from wind farms in the
USA show land use in the range of 5–8 acres/MW. This is the land that wind turbines
occupy to receive the wind energy and thus the free “wind fuel” plus the large open areas
needed to prevent wake effects from one turbine affecting the performance of other turbines,
and the access roads and facilities. Now is this a lot of land? To answer this question, we
would need to make comparisons with the land used by the coal, natural gas, and nuclear
life cycles.
Fossil-fuel-based generation such as coal has a seemingly low land footprint, as power plants
take up a relatively small surface area for their large power output. However, the picture
changes when life-cycle land use is assessed, accounting for the direct (mining and fuel pro￾cessing, plant footprint) and indirect (land usage for materials and building infrastructure
needed to operate the mines) land transformed. The life-cycle land usage for different sources
of electricity can be compared on a “surface area per energy unit” basis, although in that
case, it is important to define a finite time scope as the land used for wind and solar could vir￾tually generate electricity forever (in the case of this study: 25 years, the wind turbine system
lifetime). Land usage for wind turbine (WT) and wind would perhaps better be described
with a “surface area per power unit” as their power source for that surface area will exist for
virtually infinite time. In contrast, the energy source from surface coal mines is exhausted
after the fuel is extracted.

Historical data show that wind farms in the USA often use less land during their life cycle
than coal during its life cycle.5
For the coal fuel cycle, the direct land transformation is primarily related to the coal extrac￾tion, electricity generation, and waste disposal stages, while the indirect land use refers to the
upstream land use associated with energy and materials inputs during the fuel cycle. Land
use statistics during coal mining vary with factors including heating value, seam thickness,
and mining methods. Surface mining in the Western USA tends to disturb less area (per unit
coal mined) than in other areas due to the thick seams, 2–9 m. Central states where seam
thickness is only 0.5–0.7 m transform the largest area for the same amount of coal mined.
On the other hand, underground mining transforms land mostly through indirect pathways.
Wood usage for supporting underground coal mines accounts for the majority of indirect
land transformation. Currently, in the USA, about 70% of coal is mined from the surface.
For operating a coal power plant, land is required for facilities including powerhouse,
switchyard, stacks, precipitators, walkways, coal storage, and cooling towers. The size of a
coal power plant highly varies; a typical 1000-MW capacity plant requires between 330 and
1000 acres which translates into 6–18 m2/GWh of transformed land based on a CF of 85%.
Another study based on a 500-MW power plant located in the Eastern USA estimated
32 m2/GWh of land transformation. Also, coal-fired power plants generate a significant
amount of ash and sludge during operation. Disposing of the solid wastes accounts for
2–11 m2/GWh, 50% each for ash and sludge, in the US condition.
The natural gas life cycle would use less land, but when it is extracted from the dilute forma￾tions on shale rocks then the land occupation is expected to be as large as that of coal.
In addition to the use of the land, we should consider its transformation and possible
damage. WT installations do not damage the land (Figure 8.10). Once the installation is
completed, WT operation will not disturb the land, in contrast to coal mining which often

pollutes the land. Also, fossil or nuclear fuel cycles need to transform certain amounts
of land continuously in proportion to the amount of fuel extracted. Restoring land to its
original form and productivity takes a long time and often is infeasible. Accounting for
secondary effects including water contamination, changes in the forest ecosystem, and
accident-related land contamination would make the WT cycle even better than other fuel
cycles. For example, water contamination from coal and uranium mining and from piles
of uranium mill tailings would disturb adjacent lands. Additionally, land transformed by
accidental conditions, especially for the nuclear fuel cycle, could change the figures dra￾matically. The Chernobyl accident contaminated 80 million acres of land with radioactive
materials, irreversibly disturbing 1.1 million acres of farmland and forest in Belarus alone.
8.5 Water use
Wind turbines have a major advantage against any thermoelectric power generation (e.g.,
coal, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, and concentrated solar power) as it does not need any
water for power generation. Electricity generation via conventional pathways accounts for a
major part of water demand as water cooling is employed in most power plants. Overall, it
was estimated that WT deployment in the U.S.-SW would displace 1700–5600 m3/GWh of
water demand when it displaces grid electricity.6
8.6 Life-cycle analysis
In Sections 8.2 and 8.4, we considered WT requirements for raw materials and land—two
environmental issues that surface before WT production even begins. Further important
environmental questions arise during a WT system’s lifetime, which starts with extraction
and purification of raw materials; proceeds through manufacture, installation, and many
years of operation; and ends with recycling or disposal of waste products. The whole
sequence is referred to as a life cycle, and it is important to appreciate its environmental
consequences. Note that this form of LCA is not the same as the classical economic
life-cycle costing version previously introduced, which deals with cash flows and financial
decisions. We are now moving on to something much broader, with important implications
for global energy policy and society.
In this brief introduction, we will consider LCA under two main headings:
■ Environmental impact. What impacts (e.g., GHG emissions) are incurred or avoided?
■ Energy balance. How does the amount of electrical energy generated over a system’s
lifetime compare with the energy expended in making, installing, and using it?
We now move on to the much-discussed topic of energy balance. Clearly, it takes energy to
produce energy. But, how does the total amount of electrical energy generated by a WT mod￾ule or system over its lifetime compare with the input energy used to manufacture, install,
and use it? Closely related to the energy balance is the energy payback time (EPBT), the

number of years it takes for the input energy to be paid back by the system. We naturally
expect WT to have favorable energy balances and payback times, especially in view of its
claims to be clean and green.
Two initial points are worth making. First, energy payback is not the same as economic
payback. The latter is concerned with repaying a system’s capital and maintenance costs
(including the COE consumed) by a long-term flow of income and is essentially a financial
matter; energy payback is much more about the environment. Second, the environmental
benefits of a short payback time depend on the present energy mix of the country, or coun￾tries, concerned. If the required input energy is largely derived from coal-burning power
plants, it is more damaging than if it comes from, say, hydroelectricity.
Major energy inputs to a WT system occur during the following activities:
■ extraction, refining, and purification of materials.
■ manufacture of wind turbines, and balance of system (BOS) components.
■ transport and installation.
Interestingly, some of the most significant energy inputs are for components such as alu￾minum for WT components and concrete foundations for support structures in large WT
plants.
The other side of the energy balance—the total electrical energy generated by a system over
its lifetime—depends on the following factors:
■ efficiency of WT,
■ the level of wind resources at the location of deployment,
■ alignment of the WT array and shading (if any), and
■ the life of the system.
Now, let us discuss the LCA in a more structured way.
The energy balance is most favorable for systems that are efficiently produced in
state-of-the-art factories and installed at optimal sites in sunshine countries. Things
get even better if systems last for longer than their projected or guaranteed lifetimes—but
of course this is hard to predict. Some life-cycle studies carried out in the early years of
the new millennium painted a rather gloomy picture of WT’s environmental and health
impacts, due largely to the fossil-fuel energy used during WT manufacture. However,
up-to-date peer-reviewed studies that take proper account of advances in WT engineering
have corrected this picture. The EPBTs of current WT power plants are between 0.5 and
1.8 years, depending on the wind resource in the place of installation and the type of
technology used.7,8
To better understand this result, we would need to discuss the elements of the LCA. LCA is
a comprehensive framework for quantifying the environmental impacts caused by material

and energy flows in each and all the stages of the “life cycle” of a product or an activity. It
describes all the life stages, from “cradle to grave,” thus from raw materials extraction to end
of life. The cycle typically starts from the mining of materials from the ground and contin￾ues with the processing and purification of the materials, manufacturing of the compounds
and chemicals used in processing, manufacturing of the product, transport, installation if
applicable, use, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning and disposal and/or recycling.
To the extent that materials are reused or recycled at the end of their first life into new prod￾ucts, then the framework is extended from “cradle to cradle.” This life cycle for WT is shown
in Figure 8.11.
The life-cycle cumulative energy demand (CED) of a WT system is the total of the (renewable
and nonrenewable) primary energy (PE) harvested from the geo-biosphere in order to supply
the direct energy (e.g., fuels, electricity) and material (e.g., Si, metals, glass) inputs used in
all its life-cycle stages (excluding the wind energy directly harvested by the system during its
operation). Thus,
CED [
MJPE-eq]
= Emat + Emanuf + Etrans + Einst + EEOL (8.1)
where
Emat [MJPE-eq]: PE demand to produce materials comprising of WT system
Emanuf [MJPE-eq]: PE demand to manufacture WT system
Etrans [MJPE-eq]: PE demand to transport materials used during the life cycle
Einst [MJPE-eq]: PE demand to install the system
EEOL [MJPE-eq]: PE demand for end-of-life management
The CED of a WT system may be regarded as the energy investment that is required in order
to be able to obtain an energy return in the form of WT electricity.
EPBT is defined as the period required for a renewable energy system to generate the same
amount of energy (in terms of equivalent PE) that was used to produce (and manage at end
of life) the system itself.
EPBT [
years]
= CED∕
((Eagen∕𝜂G
)
− EO&M) (8.0)
Eagen is then converted into its equivalent PE based on the efficiency of electricity conversion
at the demand side using the grid mix where the WT plant is being installed. Note that

Eagen is measured (and calculated) in units of kWh, and we first have to convert it to MJ
(1 kWh = 3.6 MJ) and then use nG to convert MJ of electricity to MJ of PE (MJPE-eq). Thus,
calculating the PE equivalent of the annual electricity generation (Eagen/𝜂G) requires knowing
the life-cycle energy conversion efficiency (𝜂G) of the country-specific energy mixture used
to generate electricity and produce materials. The average 𝜂G for the USA and Europe are,
respectively, approximately 0.30 and 0.31.
Energy return on (energy) investment (EROI) is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the
energy generated over the course of its operating life over the energy it consumed (i.e., the
CED of the system). The electricity generated by WT needs to be converted to PE so that it
can be directly compared with CED. Thus, EROI is calculated as:
EROI [
MJPE-eq∕MJPE-eq]
= T × [(Eagen∕𝜂G
)
− EO&M]
∕CED = T∕EPBT
where T is the period of the system operation; both T and EPBT are expressed in years.
EROI and EPBT provide complementary information. EROI looks at the overall energy
performance of the WT system over its entire lifetime, whereas EPBT measures the point in
time (t) after which the system is able to provide a net energy return.
GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP): The overall GWP due to the emis￾sion of a number of GHGs along the various stages of the WT life cycle is typically
estimated using an integrated time horizon of 100 years (GWP100), whereby the following
CO2-equivalent factors are used: 1 kg CH4 = 32 kg CO2-eq, 1 kg N2O = 296 kg CO2-eq,
and 1 kg chlorofluorocarbons = 4600–10,600 kg CO2-eq. Electricity and fuel use during
the production of the WT materials and components are the main sources of the GHG
emissions for WT cycles, and specifically the technologies and processes for generating the
upstream electricity play an important role in determining the total GWP of WTs, since
the higher the mixture of fossil fuels is in the grid, the higher are the GHG (and toxic)
emissions.
An average between inland and offshore WT is reported in the Wind Vision 2015 DOE study9
to be 13 g CO2eq/kWh of which the majority (12 g/kWh) is attributed to upstream material
and component manufacturing. The LCA results strongly depend on the available electricity
mix. The EPBT of WT is between 6 months and a year and the Energy Return to Energy
Investment is 20–30 assuming a 20-year operation life.
8.7 Landscape and amenity
The interaction of large wind turbines with natural landscapes is probably the most
contentious issue surrounding the development of wind farms, especially onshore. Visual
intrusion is the most-cited reason for opposition to wind farms, and there are small but
highly vociferous groups in many countries that object to what they see as “industrial-scale”
machines imposed upon the beauty of the natural world. The whole issue is highly subjective
and depends on the number, size, and arrangement of turbines as well as the geography and
scale of the landscape (Figures 8.12 and 8.13). While most readers of this book presumably

approach wind energy with a positive attitude—or at least an open mind—it is important
to recognize genuine concerns and, where possible, to counter mischievous half-truths put
about by vested interests.
The first point to make is that there are no easy energy options for the 21st century. Over
recent years, it has become increasingly clear that fossil-fuel combustion is threatening a
global environmental crisis and that, even if this were not so, there is a severe problem of
resource depletion. China, India, and many other populous nations are presently industri￾alizing on a huge scale, and it seems unimaginable that Planet Earth can survive unscathed
if we continue on our present course. Nuclear power is often championed as an alternative
to renewable sources, but its enthusiasts rarely mention the unsolved problems of radioac￾tive waste disposal, the huge costs of decommissioning, and the dangers of nuclear accidents.
While nobody should pretend that renewable energy is the answer to all our problems, or that
it avoids all environmental concerns, it is surely wise to develop wind and other renewable
technologies as an important part of the energy mix. Seen in this light, the visual intrusion
of wind turbines in sensitive landscapes becomes just one of the many environmental issues
raised by electricity generation.
In any case, there is no widespread hostility to wind farms. For example, survey after survey
of public attitudes in the UK has shown high levels of support—typically around 80% of
those questioned—and the support grows stronger among people living close to new farms
when they actually experience them in operation and realize that the scare stories of pres￾sure groups are exaggerated. In Scotland, where onshore wind farms sited on high uplands
and hill ridges have become increasingly common in recent years, public support is con￾sistently high among people living close to the turbines. By contrast, opposition, although
noisy, comes from a very small percentage of the population. Of course, objections to the
visual intrusion of large wind turbines are greatly influenced by other attitudes. If you are
skeptical about the threat of climate change, you are likely to see any attempts to alleviate it
as pointless; if you believe the stories about wind energy being inefficient, you may well join
a pressure group to oppose it. And there is inevitably a strong element of the “nimby” (not
in my backyard) syndrome in local objections to new wind farms, whereas those of us who
take a wider view see them as evidence, not of a casual indifference toward the natural world
but rather of our increasing desire to live in harmony with it. As so often, beauty is in the
eye of the beholder.
At times like these, it is helpful to take a historical perspective. In the 19th century, there
was huge opposition by English landowners to the building of railways and vocal attempts
by vested interests to prevent their spread across the countryside; yet in time they became
so accepted and appreciated as an industrial and social good that when thousands of miles
of branch railway lines were condemned as uneconomic in the 1960s, there was great public
misgiving. Today, there is plenty of nostalgia about the passing of the “age of steam.” It is
interesting that a project proposed by the UK government in 2011 to build a new high-speed
rail link between London and Birmingham, which was vehemently opposed by many people
living close to the selected route, was finally constructed.
Another good example is provided by the many thousands of UK electricity transmission
towers (pylons) that have marched unopposed across the countryside since the 1950s. True,
there are complaints when a new high-voltage transmission line is proposed, but once per￾mitted and built, the noise quickly dies down. It is a truism that people, especially in rural
areas, tend to dislike change, but in most cases, they adapt to it well enough in the longer

term, and we may be reasonably confident that our grandchildren will accept wind farms as
a normal part of the rural scene, just as our grandparents accepted the railways.
However, it is important to avoid complacency. The general acceptability of wind turbines
depends markedly on scale—their individual size and their total numbers. Germany has
proved its commitment to wind energy in recent years with well over 20,000 large onshore
wind turbines but when, following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, Chan￾cellor Merkel announced the premature closure of seven nuclear power plants and a great
expansion of renewables, there were strong rumblings of discontent in regions that already
have their “fair share” of wind farms. Even in a population that consistently vote for renew￾able energy by margins of 80% or more, and steadfastly opposes nuclear expansion, there
may come a time when “enough is enough.” It must be added that, on past experience, the
German government seems unlikely to abandon its plans; but in the case of wind turbines,
they will probably move some of them out to sea.
The current boom in offshore wind, especially in the North Sea, undoubtedly softens the
problem of visual intrusion. Offshore turbines are typically at least 10 km away from human
habitation and, by definition, down at sea level (Figure 8.14). The most powerful HAWTs
with rotor diameters larger than the London Eye, the famous Ferris wheel that offers tourists
such spectacular views over the capital city, are generally only acceptable offshore. This is
not to say that their visual presence is negligible; indeed, those who love gazing out to sea at
distant, uninterrupted horizons may still have cause for regret. But as we have already said,
energy always comes at a price over and above its monetary cost.
We have called this section Landscape and amenity because large wind turbines affect people
in more ways than visibility. Two other concerns that are often raised are turbine noise and
flicker.

The noise problem tends to be exaggerated. The latest HAWTs produce very little mechanical
noise from gearboxes and generators, and in most cases, the aerodynamic noise associated
with rotation is unnoticed by people unless they live within a few hundred meters. The swish￾ing of turbine blades is often masked by similar noise produced when the wind—especially
strong or turbulent wind—meets trees and buildings. Nevertheless, there are two significant
sources of aerodynamic noise2 that can cause irritation or sleep disturbance:
Wind shadow. As each HAWT blade passes the tower, it enters a disturbed flow that
produces an “impulsive” noise at a blade-passing frequency (see Section 3.3.3).
Airfoil noise. Complex interactions between airflow and airfoil sections, especially near
blade tips and trailing edges, generate noise over a wide frequency range. In general,
its severity increases with the tip speed ratio (see Section 3.2.3).
We have already mentioned the problem of flicker in Section 5.2.2. It takes two forms: supply
voltage variations caused by local turbines in relatively weak grids produce flickering of lights
in homes and commercial premises and sunlight flicker caused by blades interrupts the sun’s
rays as they sweep the sky. The first is mainly a nighttime concern, the second a daytime
one—but only in sunny weather! Both have strictly local impacts, and although we should
not dismiss them, they normally affect very few people.
Environmental impacts of wind farms on landscapes and amenities undoubtedly exist and
cause annoyance to some. This is true of all forms of electricity generation and distribution.
Developers are well aware of the problems, and in most countries, there are stringent hurdles
to overcome before a wind farm is given permission by the planning authorities. The present
surge in offshore wind in densely populated countries such as the UK, Denmark, Germany,
and the Netherlands promises to reduce opposition that might otherwise be directed at new
developments onshore.
8.8 Birds and bats
There have been many reports over the years of birds being killed by wind turbines, and
this remains a significant environmental concern as wind energy continues its international
progress. We will give the first word on this issue to the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds (RSPB),
5 whose more than one million UK members and 200 nature reserves covering
130,000 hectares make it one of the largest and most influential environmental organizations
in Europe. In 2009, the RSPB’s head of Climate Change Policy noted that:
The need for renewable energy could not be more urgent. Left unchecked, climate change
threatens many species with extinction. Yet that sense of urgency is not translating into
action on the ground to harness the abundant wind energy around us. . . if we get it right,
the UK can produce huge amounts of clean energy without time-consuming conflicts
and harm to our wildlife. Get it wrong and people may reject wind power. That would
be disastrous.
Such brave and unambiguous words encapsulate the attitude of most environmental orga￾nizations toward renewable energy in general and wind energy in particular. Translating a
global view into local action and believing that birds are far more threatened in the long term

by climate change than by regrettable, but occasional, encounters with wind turbines, the
RSPB comes out clearly in favor of wind farms provided they are sited away from sensitive
areas frequented by rare or endangered species.
The modern history of wind turbines and bird strikes goes back to the Californian “wind
rush” of the 1980s, when protected species including golden eagles were being killed by tur￾bines and high-voltage transmission lines in the Altamont Pass.2 Subsequently, there have
been reports from around the world of occasional, but sometimes serious, strikes as unsus￾pecting birds lose battles with rotating blades and power lines, and there are additional
concerns about habitat. We now have a clear idea of the main risks:
Migration routes and corridors. Bird populations are not evenly distributed. Flight paths
and patterns are often localized and concentrated, especially in flocks migrating, for￾aging, roosting, or flying in restricted geographical areas such as mountain passes.
Electrocution. There may be significant extra risks from electrocution by overhead power
distribution lines.
Disturbance of habitat. The presence of wind turbines can disturb or displace breed￾ing and foraging birds. Rather than engage with wind turbines, birds may move away
from them, effectively losing preferred habitats. The installation of wind turbines and
associated infrastructure including roads may cause significant habitat damage.
Considerable evidence of mortality has been gathered over the years. In general, bird deaths
caused by wind turbines and farms are a minute proportion of the deaths due to all human
activities. Expressed in terms of fatalities per unit of electricity generated, wind energy fares
far better than fossil-fuel generation.2 And we may feel that, compared with the millions of
songbirds shot every year for “sport” as they migrate through southern Europe, and the tens
of millions of birds killed annually by domestic cats in the UK, wind turbines have rather
little to answer for!
However, as with the visual intrusion of turbines, we must not become complacent—especially
where the bird species under threat are scarce or endangered. The RSPB’s admirably bal￾anced policy toward wind energy leads it to oppose wind farms in some locations, and we
may use one of its campaigns as an example.
The Scottish branch of the RSPB has objected to less than 10% of all the wind farm pro￾posals it has monitored in recent years, proving that it does not engage in opposition for
opposition’s sake. But Scotland has vast areas of wild country, and much of it is a paradise
for rare birds. Several applications have been made to build wind farms on the Isle of Lewis,
the most northerly of the Western Isles. To put this in context, Figure 8.15 is a map of Scot￾land with the most important areas for bird protection and conservation marked in green.
Based on RSPB data which were redrawn with lower resolution to show just areas of high
sensitivity, it is immediately apparent that the West Highlands and Western Isles are espe￾cially significant, and that the Isle of Lewis ranks among the most sensitive of all. This may
surprise people who have visited Lewis and know its bleak windswept landscapes—not obvi￾ously a bird sanctuary, at least not for delicate species. But in fact, there are major concerns
for a variety of species including golden eagles, red-throated and black-throated divers, and
merlins that depend on the Lewis peatlands, an area designated for special protection.
In view of the RSPB’s 2009 statement supporting wind energy, quoted above, it may seem sur￾prising that it had previously opposed a major wind farm application for Lewis with consid￾erable vehemence, on the grounds of scale (181 large HAWTs), overhead cables and pylons,

eight electrical substations, and associated roads. Its opposition focused on the potential
destruction of high peatland, known as blanket bog, which is especially important for rare
birds and is found in only a few areas in the world. After much campaigning by environ￾mental interests, the Scottish government turned down the proposal in 2008, and the RSPB
declared it “an extremely commendable decision that is absolutely right for Scotland.” In
fact, the Isle of Lewis is now getting its wind farms, but the developers are showing far
more sensitivity toward the problem of scale, the needs of wildlife and conservation, and the
importance of public opinion. As we noted earlier, conventional economics tends to neglect
everything except money, but the public is increasingly aware of environmental costs. Those

of us who support the growth of wind energy for global environmental reasons must accept
that locally the boot is sometimes on the other foot.
Wind turbines can be a threat to bats as well as birds. Back in 2005, the Washington Post
reported that a researcher at the University of Maryland had found hundreds of bat car￾casses at a wind farm on Backbone Mountain, reinforcing concerns as the US wind industry
expanded away from its traditional areas in the West and Great Plains into more east￾ern states. Bat fatalities are worrying because many species are in decline worldwide, and
although bats lack the mass appeal of birds, they are considered remarkable by biologists
and scientists for the sonar echolocation they use to hunt night-flying insects, including many
agricultural pests. Research in North America6 has increased understanding of the interac￾tions between bats and wind turbines and suggested ways of reducing fatalities. Key points
include the following:
■ Bats on well-defined migration routes are especially vulnerable.
■ There is strong evidence that deaths are due not only to collisions with turbines but
also to critical lung injuries caused by sudden changes in air pressure in the vicinity of
turbine blades.
■ Bats are mainly active in calm conditions. Fatalities may be greatly reduced at times
when bats are on the wing by increasing the cut-in wind speed of turbines, prevent￾ing rotation during periods of low wind speed. The cost in terms of annual energy
production is very modest—typically below 1%.
European bats are also vulnerable to wind turbines, and significant fatalities have been
reported in Germany, France, and Portugal. The first part of a comprehensive study
by the Bat Conservation Trust in association with the University of Bristol, aimed at
understanding and quantifying bat deaths caused by onshore wind farms in the UK, was
published in 2009.7
However, in our days, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are developed and used for alarm￾ing birds so that they avoid collisions on wind turbines . For example, the IdentiFlight bird
detection system blends artificial intelligence with the high-precision optical technology to
detect eagles and other protected avian species. In an operating wind farm, IdentiFlight con￾tributes to eagle conservation by helping protect them from collisions with rotating wind
turbine blades. Automatic detection and species determination occur within seconds for
birds flying within a one kilometer hemisphere around an IdentiFlight tower. The Identi￾Flight system has completed real-world testing and validation in pilot programs at wind
farms with elevated eagle activity and is now commercially deployed at projects around
the world. For example. The “Top of theWorld” wind farm in Wyoming, USA, employs
48 IdentFlight towers covering the 110 wind turbines, 17 000 acres site of the farm. (Source:

8.9 Farming
Finally, we should say a few words about farming and the impact that wind turbines have
on farm animals. The antiwind lobby sometimes claims that farmland is “used up” by wind
turbines, implying that turbines make a site unsuitable for agriculture. This, of course, is

nonsense. The actual amount of land required by turbine foundations and associated infras￾tructure including roads is a tiny fraction—typically under 1%—of the total site area of
a wind farm, and crops may be grown right up to the turbine foundations. Indeed, from
the farmer’s point of view, wind turbines are often an economic blessing, offering a valu￾able extra source of income. The situation is almost as clear with farm animals including
sheep and cattle, which generally ignore wind turbines and often graze right up to the tow￾ers (Figure 8.16). There have been occasional reports that sheep are disturbed by turbine
noise, but other studies claim that they enjoy the shade provided by turbine towers! All in
all, today’s clear consensus is that wind farms are compatible with farming in its many forms.
8.10 Seabirds, fish, and marine conservation
Offshore wind farms seem to present few environmental risks. Although they consume more
materials and energy per rated megawatt during manufacture and installation than onshore
farms, they offer societal benefits including reduced visual intrusion and negligible nuisance
from turbine noise. Public attitudes are generally positive.
In 2006, the Danish Energy Authority published a report on the Horns Rev 1 and Nysted
Offshore Wind Farms (see Section 4.4.1) which found no evidence of significant negative
impacts on birds, fish stocks, marine mammals, or undersea ecology. In 2009, the UK
government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change published a comprehensive envi￾ronmental study suggesting that up to 7000 large HAWTs could be installed off the nation’s
coastlines without adverse effects on the marine environment. And in 2011 the Scottish

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseOnshore and Offshore Wind Energy
branch of the RSPB, which campaigns strongly against certain onshore wind farm propos￾als, welcomed a strategic approach by the Scottish government to environmental planning
of offshore wind capacity.5 These are just a few of the positive indications that offshore wind
is generally seen as having minor, and manageable, negative impacts on the natural world.
Within this generally optimistic scenario, how do the risks to seabirds and birds on migration
compare with those posed by onshore wind farms? Fortunately, the available evidence is
reassuring:
■ Birds generally show much more successful “avoidance responses” to offshore wind
farms, with reduced risk of collision.
■ Although there is some displacement of sea birds from former feeding areas, the overall
effect on bird populations is negligible.
It seems that, compared to the dangers to wild birds caused by many human activities and
industries, offshore wind is benign. However, the situation varies from site to site, and new
wind farm applicants are invariably required to submit environmental impact assessments
(EIAs) covering the threat to birds. For example, during the initial planning of the 1-GW
London Array (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.2), the EIA identified a previously unknown and
internationally important population of rare red-throated divers wintering on part of the
site. The RSPB objected to the proposal, but following discussions it was agreed to go ahead
with a “stage 1” comprising 175 turbines (630 MW) installed in the least sensitive part of the
site, requiring the developer to monitor its effects on the birds over a 3-year-period before
“stage 2” (370 MW) could be sanctioned. As noted by the RSPB:
The case shows how early and continuing consultation and negotiation by a developer,
both willing to listen to concerns and act on them, can lead to a positive outcome for
birds and renewable energy.
Apart from birds, the most obvious environmental issues raised by offshore wind energy
relate to marine conservation and fishing.8 Early indications are positive and suggest that off￾shore wind farms may actually benefit the marine environment (Figure 8.17). For example,
the gravel or boulders that are often used to prevent scouring of the seabed around monopile
foundations may act as valuable “artificial reefs,” encouraging colonization by a wide vari￾ety of marine organisms and increasing biodiversity. Another possibility is to conserve fish
stocks by restricting, or even prohibiting, fishing within wind farms. At a time when indi￾vidual farms with areas in excess of 100 km2 are being planned and built, this is clearly an
important option. In the UK, active discussions take place between the government, the
wind energy industry, marine conservationists, and fishing interests to decide whether new
offshore wind farms can be colocated with marine conservation zones.
As so often, the attitudes of fishermen tend to reflect the conflict between earning a living
now and preserving fish stocks for the future. They may give a general welcome to the
prospect of wind farms protecting the marine environment and helping conserve fish
stocks, but if prevented from entering traditional fishing grounds they tend to object that
their livelihood is under threat. As far as wind farm operators are concerned, it is clearly
important to prevent large vessels from going too close to turbine towers, especially in rough
weather, and if fishing is allowed at all, it is unlikely to include trawling with the attendant
risk of snagging cables on, or just below, the seabed. Operators are also concerned about
legal and management aspects: if fishing is restricted or prohibited within wind farms, who

will monitor it and take responsibility for enforcement? These and other questions are very
much up for discussion as the offshore wind industry gathers pace, and the next decade will
surely be crucial for developing satisfactory agreements between the interested parties.

8.8 A homeowner installs a wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 3 m to supplement elec￾tricity from the public utility. The cost of the turbine, the associated electronics, and
the energy storage system (batteries) is $15,000. If the turbine has an efficiency of 40%
and the energy is utilized and/or stored at an efficiency of nearly 100%, what is the
payback period for the investment? Assume that maintenance costs are minimal, elec￾tricity from the public utility costs $0.10 per kWh, and the wind velocity is constant at
10 m/s.

Q8.1 It will be proportionally lower, thus 0.5 years.
Q8.2 For a life expectancy of 20 years, EROI would be X and Y respectively.
Q8.3 Coal life cycles use more land than either wind or PV because of coal surface min￾ing. Wind turbines use more land than PV because of the required spacing between
turbines, unless this space is used for other purposes.
Q8.4 REEs used in permanent magnets, such as neodymium, praseodymium, dyspro￾sium, and terbium.

in bird mitigation passages.
Q8.6 Mostly carbon fiber, steel, copper, and aluminum.
Q8.7 They are more difficult to repair under bad weather conditions.
Q8.8 Offshore wind turbines cost more to install, but they can produce more energy as
winds are stronger and more persistent offshore than on land.
