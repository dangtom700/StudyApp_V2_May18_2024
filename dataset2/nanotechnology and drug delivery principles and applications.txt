Index 611 Preface
Nanotechnology is playing a new role in creating innovative 
changes in different life sciences domains, such as biotechnology, 
drug delivery, agriculture, diagnostics, and allied health sciences.
This book’s primary purpose is to serve as a reference 
textbook on the use of nanotechnology in the design and 
development of drug delivery systems and to highlight some of 
this field’s most interesting advancements. In order to achieve
this, the reader is exposed to several aspects of the principles
of drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology as well as
their applications. It is also discussed how these systems overcome 
the problems posed by biological barriers to drug absorption 
and therapeutic targeting. The book covers the following
topics: fundamentals of nanotechnology in drug delivery;
nanodrug delivery in therapeutics, including brain targeting, CVS
targeting, arthritis, ocular, dermal drug delivery systems, etc.;
and regulatory aspects of nanodrug delivery systems. It brings
together reviews and unique writings from renowned experts in
the interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology in drug delivery.
Readers can gain a broad perspective on the new and ongoing 
potentialities of nanotechnology drug delivery applications based 
on their thorough and current experience.
I hope that this book will help the reader understand both
these tools and the basic science behind them. Each part has 
been written by one or more well-known experts in the field, and
there are a large number of figures and tables to help show the
most important points. Many people helped me to finish this book, 
and I am very grateful to them. I extend my special thanks to
the individual chapter contributors and the publisher.

The combination of nanotechnology in medicine, especially 
medication delivery, is expected to grow substantially. Nanodrug 
delivery systems are a novel but fast-emerging discipline in 
which very tiny materials are used as diagnostics or to administer 
therapeutic drugs to particular targeted locations in a controlled 
manner. Nanotechnology has several advantages in the treatment
of chronic human diseases through the site-specific and 
target-oriented delivery of precise medications. Interestingly,
pharmaceutical scientists are employing nanoparticles to lower 
medication toxicity and adverse effects. Nanotechnology has the 
ability to improve the safety profile of medications with high 
hazardous potential, such as chemotherapeutic cancer treatments 
and other chronic diseases. As a result, it is a prominent advanced 
technology for dealing with biology and medicine for therapeutic 
objectives. In this book chapter, we explore the significance of

1.1 Introduction
Nanotechnology is the process of making and employing
structures, devices, and systems by changing the size and shape 
of nanoscale materials. Nanotechnology’s innovation is the 
unique and frequently superior optical, electrical, mechanical, 
catalytic, and magnetic surface properties of nanostructures, 
which have fundamentally altered the number of scientific 
advances. The technique has been implemented in a variety of 
sectors, including the biomedical field, specifically for diagnostics, 
therapeutics, bio-imaging, and medication delivery [1].
Particularly nanotechnology-based drug delivery methods have 
swiftly overcome the challenges of conventional drug delivery 
systems, including accessibility, drug transport across biological 
barriers, bioavailability, limited solubility, in vivo instability, and 
undesirable pharmacological effects. According to nanotechnology, 
it is now possible to create novel pharmaceuticals. Nanotechnology, 
also known as nanomedicine, has been determined to be the most 
prevalent and commercially viable technology for improving 
healthcare procedures [3]. Despite considerable limitations, 
device businesses, such as pharmaceutical and medical device 
manufacturers, have been discovered to utilize nanotechnology 
in the medical industry in certain circumstances, nanotechnology 
can be utilized to provide drugs with a greater safety profile,
such as cancer chemotherapy. Living cells function as virtual 
devices that participate in many biological processes, including 
metabolism, energy production, cell-to-cell communication, and 
nutrient translocation. Considering this, it can be stated that 
this technology is a strong competitor for usage in biological and 
medical therapeutic procedures [4].
Nanoscience is the only field that may collaborate with 
traditional fields, such as molecular chemistry, pharmacological 
research, healthcare, etc., to discover innovative characteristics 
in their respective fields [5]. Through the development of a more Introduction 3 
efficient healthcare system, nanomedicine technologies, and 
treatment techniques over the past few decades, science and 
technology have often been well-designed to handle problems 
in the field of medicine and health sciences (Table 1.1). Common 
nanoparticles employed as drug delivery vehicles are 100 nm in 
at least one dimension and consist of biodegradable components 
including natural or manufactured materials, polymers, lipids, and 
metals. As per nanotechnology, it is now possible to create novel 
pharmaceuticals [6].

1.2 Classification of Nanotechnology 
Nanoparticles are often classified based on their chemical 
arrangement, size, state of matter, and shape [1]. Nanoparticles 
have a particle size range of 10–100 nm, the size of these particles 
could influence their physical and chemical properties, such as 	 	 	
 
 
 
Nanoparticles Types 5 
their optical qualities, as in the case of platinum, silver, palladium, 
and gold. Based on their dimensions, they are classified as 0D
or 1D [2], the majority of NPs have characteristic colors which 
include yellowish-gray (platinum), black (silver), dark black 
(palladium), and wine red (gold).
The nanoparticle structure comprises three components: 
•	 Surface layer: There are several tiny compounds, inorganic 
compounds, detergents, and macromolecules present. 
•	 Shell layer: in this part, the structural component is 
chemically different. 
•	 Core: This is the central portion of the nanoparticle, 
sometimes known as the nanoparticle (NP) itself [3]. 
1.3 Nanoparticles Types 
It has been discovered that NPs can be employed in a variety of 
biological and healthcare systems, such as dosage forms, toxic 
and biological waste detection, as well as CO2 capture, which 
have been shown to employ NPs [7] and based on their chemical 
characteristics, NPs are classified in three categories (Fig. 1.1). 
1. Organic-based NPs 
2. Inorganic-based NPs 
3. Carbon-based NPs 
1.3.1 Organic-Based Nanoparticles
Due to their unique properties, nanoparticles are only organic￾based due to their unique characteristics, these nanoparticles are 
biodegradable and non-toxic, requiring a non-covalent interaction 
for their development and structure. This enables the transition 
of organic nanoparticles (NPs) into other desired forms such as 
dendrimers, liposomes, ferritin (polymer), and micelles (Fig. 1.2)
related to their hollow cores, some of them are also called 
nanocapsules and sensitivity to thermal and electromagnetic 
radiation, also known as heat and light, respectively [8] because 
of their excellent qualities, they are an ideal material for drug 
delivery systems with a specific target. 6 
Figure 1.1 Nanoparticles (NPs) are categorized into three groups according to their chemical properties Organic-based, Inorganic-based, 
and Carbon-based. 
Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems  
Nanoparticles Types 7 
Figure 1.2 Organic-based nanoparticles, dendrimers, micelles, ferritin, and 
liposomes. 
1.3.2 Inorganic-Based Nanoparticles 
As the name implies, their structures lack carbon and they consist 
of inorganic substances such as metal ions (gold, iron, cobalt, zinc, 
aluminum, cadmium, lead) and metal oxides (Fig. 1.3). Amongst 
these NPs, many are metallic-primarily based NPs that are created 
utilizing nanometer-sized metals in two methods known as adverse 
and constructive [9] in the presence of air (oxygen), metal oxide 
NPs are generated, which results in the oxidation of metals to create 
various oxides, such as iron oxide, titanium dioxide, magnetite, 
silicon dioxide, cerium oxide, etc. On the other hand, certain 
inorganic NPs are particularly more sensitive to changes in the 
atmosphere’s moisture, and sunlight and the sizes range from 
10–100 nm, solid crystalline, and amorphous formations, and 
circular or tubular geometries, Numerous distinct traits include a 
high specific surface area ratio, pore, surface charge, and surface 
density.

Figure 1.3 Inorganic-based nanoparticles, metal ions (gold, iron, Cu), and 
metal oxides (Iron oxide). 
1.3.3 Carbon-Based Nanoparticles
As their name suggests, they’re mostly carbon and the discovery
of their unique qualities has led to their use in a wide range 
of industries, in case mechanical qualities, such as stability,
conductivity, and so on, are just a few of their many physical and 
thermal characteristics [10]. They are classified into various 
types (Fig. 1.4). 
• Graphene: Graphene is a carbon allotrope that is still being 
researched. It is used in the manufacture of solar panels, 
natural LEDs, and the preservation of hydrogen for fuels, 
supercapacitors, and membranes for gas separation, among 
others. 
• Carbon black: Its carbon atoms are wound into hollow 
cylinders, as opposed to the graphene nanofoil, to produce 
single and multilayered carbon nanotubes of varying lengths 
that self-align under Van-der-Waals. 
• Carbon nanotubes: Graphene nanofoils are used to create 
carbon nanofibers in the form of carbon nanotubes coiled 
into a cup or cone shape. They are employed as scanning 
electron microscope tips and reinforcement composites
in electron emission [11]. 
• Fullerenes (C60) and Carbon dot.

• Contrast agents employed in diagnostic devices 
• In the field of Cosmetics research dealing with anti-aging 
substances 
• Used as Catalysts for water purification 
• Used as Photovoltaics 
• Used to convert methane 
• Used in Electronics 
• Used as Reinforcement for composites [12] 
1.5 Importance of Nanoscale Materials 
An essential aspect of nanotechnology for the vast majority of 
nanoscale constituents is to increase the surface area-to-volume 
ratio, this enables novel quantum mechanical results due to the  
10 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
“quantum size effect” [13], a large reduction in particle size can 
change the electrical properties of solids. For instance, due to 
electron entrapment causing quantum effects, nanoparticles
typically exhibit unanticipated visual properties, such as gold
nanoparticles, which seem deep red to black when mixed by 
applying nanoscale design to materials, microscopic and 
macroscopic features, such as melting temperature, magnetism, 
and charge capacity [14] can be modified without affecting the 
chemical ingredients. Theoretically, this should have no effect on 
the density of the final product, but flow difficulties and the ability 
of nanoparticles to aggregate create complications. Additionally,
the surface action of NPs decreases the initial melting temperature 
[15], this scale chemistry offers advantages in catalysis due to its
high ratio of surface area to volume, and interfacial surface 
chemistry that is essential for a variety of applications such as 
catalysis, composites, drug delivery, reactive systems, and energy 
deposits are excellent applications for nanoscale compounds. 
However, they are also employed in medicine, and the hue of 
gold NP varies upon resizing. Introducing green nanotechnology 
with various features, including enhanced wear resistance and 
antibacterial qualities even though there are still worries regarding 
potential health and environmental repercussions [17].
Nanoscale material is also used for material applications, 
as well as for the design of cleaner industrial processes [14], and 
the construction of sustainable objects may improve the environ￾ment with the unique and novel properties of nanostructured 
materials, nanotechnology can offer advantages with regard to 
the construction of catalysts, materials with enhanced strength, 
and material with reduced environmental impact. In the sectors
of catalysis, medicine, solar energy conversion, and water 
purification [16, 17], these materials can also be employed to 
provide answers to technical and ecological concerns an important 
characteristic of molecular structures or biological entities in 
the body is their orderly nanoscale arrangement. Research and 
progress in nanotechnology made it possible to introduce tiny 
objects into living cells [24] through molecular self-assembly, 
this approach has also made it possible to analyze the micro- and 
macrostructure of matter. Undoubtedly, this is a highly capable 
instrument in materials science [18] for instance nanostructured Design of Nanotechnology 11 
macroscopic systems include enhancing the powder and hardness 
of nanoparticles and lightweight nanocomposites [14], as well as 
their compressive characteristics and moldability. Furthermore, 
such devices may be capable of mechanically changing molecular 
structures at the nanoscale [19]. In addition, nanosystems can 
have far greater densities than microstructures and are superior
electrical conductors. This could drive the development of new 
electronic gadgets with more advanced functionality, smaller 
and faster circuitry, and dramatically decreased energy use. 
Simultaneously managing nanostructure interactions and their 
issues [17]. 
1.6 Design of Nanotechnology
Extensive study has been conducted on the cancer therapeutic 
uses of colloidal drug delivery systems such as liposomes,
micelles, and nanoparticles, and several drug delivery techniques 
exist compact size, poor drug tolerability, controlled temporal 
release of the treatment, and alteration of drug pharmacology 
and physiological distribution. Chemotherapy may fail to treat the 
disease due to the expansion of cancer cells that develop resistance 
to anti-cancer medications when resistance develops in cancer 
cells, p-glycoprotein is able to pump anticancer drugs out of 
the cell as fast as they pass through the cell’s outer membrane. 
Nanoparticles can be used to carry anticancer medications into 
cells without activating the p-glycoprotein pump. According
to a recent study, new research indicates the effectiveness of
paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles in treating paclitaxel-resistant 
cancers of the human large intestine and paclitaxel-encapsulated 
emulsifying wax nanoparticles have also been proven to overcome 
drug resistance in a human colon glandular cancer cell line that is 
highly resistant (HCT-15), even though paclitaxel’s insolubility 
difficulties can be solved by conjugating it with albumen, and it 
has showed biocompatibility with albumin, and other proteins 
(Abraxane-which is an injectable nanosuspension approved for 
the treatment of breast cancer). Previously, utilized in paclitaxel 
formulations, the solvent Chromophore-EL has been associated 
with acute hypersensitivity responses, and patients should be 12 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
premedicated with corticosteroids and antihistamines prior to 
receiving paclitaxel, which should be taken slowly over the course 
of 2 h and paclitaxel binding to albumin has resulted in the rapid 
administration of a larger dose of the drug because it is solvent-free, 
toxicities associated with solvents are also removed. In a clinical 
investigation, the response rate of Abraxane was discovered to be 
double that of the medicine Taxol, which contains a solvent. 
1.7 Nanomaterial Synthesis
1.7.1 Bottom-Up Approach
1.7.1.1 Arc-discharge
In the arc-discharge synthesis of nanomaterials [20], the discharge 
of the electrodes produces a fluid that is subsequently utilized
to evaporate the electrode matter, and the material selected 
is dictated by the nanomaterial type required, for instance, 
graphite electrodes are used to produce carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs) and produced atomic vaporization will then condense into
nanomaterial. CNTs are generated using the arc-discharge
process in either gas or liquid-phase systems. certainly, this 
process was used to make the first CNTs, and it has since been
utilized to create an assortment of other nanomaterials, such as 
silver, silica-coated iron nanoparticles [21], and gold nanoparticles 
[22]. 
1.7.1.2 Inert-gas condensation
During inert-gas condensation, metal atoms are evaporated at 
high temperatures into an inert carrier gas [23] by chilling the 
gas, a supersaturated vapor is produced, and particles nucleate 
uniformly across the gas stream as a result. A batch of particles 
forms and sinter before nucleation and sintering are terminated 
by further cooling the gas with a stream of gas, the quench gas, 
or a freezing surface, such as a “cold finger” filled with liquid
nitrogen and the particles commonly form agglomerates at this 
stage, which, under the given conditions, are sufficiently “free” to 
be separated in a post-processing phase using this process, carbon Nanomaterial Synthesis 13 
black, silicon dioxide, and titanium dioxide have been generated 
[23]. 
1.7.1.3 Flame synthesis
Flame synthesis is the most common method for generating 
nanomaterials in commercial quantities [24], the flame synthesis 
method begins with the vaporization of a precursor in an inert￾gas stream [25] before this gas combination is pumped into the
flame, it is combined with fuel, and oxidant and nanomaterials 
are produced in flames, and their properties are dictated by
the configuration and composition of the flame. In flame spray 
pyrolysis, precursors are dissolved in organic solvents that are 
flammable and then sprayed into a flame using flame synthesis, 
several nanopowders, including mixed oxides, nano-oxides, 
fullerenes, and nanotubes, have been created [24, 25]. 
1.7.1.4 Vapor-phase deposition
The two types of vapor deposition used to generate nanoparticles 
[26] are chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor 
deposition (PVD) both process deposit components in the gas 
phase, which combine to form the necessary nanomaterials. 
Through the method of CVD, a precursor gas is sprayed over a 
substrate in a furnace, where it reacts chemically with the surfaces 
to form nanomaterials via deposition of the desired species, and 
CVD contains chemical interactions between precursors and 
substrates, as opposed to PVD, which uses just physical techniques 
to deposit materials without involving chemical processes. PVD 
and CVD are utilized to produce nanomaterials and deposit a 
thin coating on a variety of substrates, for instance, CVD is the 
primary process for creating sapphire crystals using it, and 
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were also manufactured commercially 
[27] and physical structure of the substrate commonly influences 
the development of nanomaterials to regulate the growth of 
nanotubes, for instance, the substrate for CNT manufacturing can 
be composed exclusively of nanoparticles. Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS)
is a CVD technique that deposits catalytic nanoparticles on 
the surface of a substrate, condenses the vapor into a liquid, and 14 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
then solidifies the liquid. It has been used to create numerous
types of nanowires, including III-V semiconductor nanowires [26]. 
1.7.1.5 Colloidal synthesis
Reducing the metal aggregates in dilute solutions is a popular 
technique for forming colloidal dispersions of metal nanomaterials 
[28] and the reduction process generates a supersaturated solution 
of metal atoms, which are then ignited to make nanoparticles, 
the clustering of these nanoparticles can be prevented by ensuring 
that the nanomaterial concentration is low or by coating the 
nanomaterials with a chemical that resists clumping, such as 
capping agents. In this procedure, Conventionally, chloroauric 
acid (HAuCl4) is utilized to manufacture gold nanoparticles by
slightly overdosing on sodium citrate [29] and sodium citrate 
transforms the acid’s Au3+ ions into Au atoms since citrate ions 
are already present in the solution and can function as stabilizing 
agents, capping agents are not required for this synthesis. This 
technique yields a saturated solution of (nearly) spherical gold 
(Au) nanoparticles, Copper (Cu) nanoparticles can be created 
using similar methods; in this case, cupric chloride is reduced 
using hydrazine. However, the surfactant cetrimonium bromide 
(CTAB) is utilized as a separate capping agent to prevent particle
clumping [29] in an endeavor to produce a homogeneous
colloidal solution, the experimental conditions must be favorable 
enough to support diffusion-controlled development and this 
is made possible by controlling experimental variables such 
as localized concentration gradients, mixing durations, and 
temperature gradients. In contrast to reactions happening in 
equivalent conventional bulk systems, microfluidic reactors can 
be advantageous for microchannel-based reactions because they 
permit more precise control of experimental conditions [30, 31]. 
1.7.2 Synthesis: Top-Down Approach
1.7.2.1 Mechanical milling
Through the use of abrasion, bulk materials are broken down 
into smaller particles with diminished dimensions [32] and the Some Key Inventions and Discoveries 15 
mechanical milling process demands a great deal of effort and 
time (or days) to finish among the numerous types of mechanical 
milling, ball milling is frequently employed for the synthesis of 
different nanomaterials [33]. A ball mill consists of a revolving 
chamber partially filled with grinding medium, or balls, and the 
material to be ground and procedure generates heat, and when 
paired with mechanical polishing, chemical reactions may occur
in different circumstances, this is useful SiO2 is reduced by 
carbon in the mill to produce pure silicon nanoparticles and CO2 
during the manufacturing of silicon nanomaterials. For instance, 
iron oxidation in the presence of water results in the creation 
of Fe2O3 nanoparticles [34], and the size distribution and shape 
of the particles produced by ball milling are often fairly broad. 
Therefore, this approach to nanomaterial synthesis is excellent for 
some applications, such as nanocomposites, where size dispersion 
is not a concern. However, it is not suited for the synthesis of 
optical nanoparticles, for which single-mode size distribution 
and homogeneous shape features are particularly advantageous
for optical applications. 
1.7.2.2 Laser ablation
It is a technique that utilizes energy that is amplified by
nanosecond pulses of laser light [35] to remove and vaporize
material from a solid surface in order to create the necessary 
nanomaterials and this process involves the expulsion of ionized 
particles into a plume prior to their combination [36], these 
nanoparticles are capable of being deposited onto the substrate 
by the plume, and laser ablation is a procedure that can be 
carried out in the gas, vacuum, or liquid phase such materials 
are metals, metal oxides, semiconductors, etc. 
1.8 Some Key Inventions and Discoveries
In 1985, around 41 years after Feynman’s forecast, scientists
Binnig, and Rohrer [38] at IBM’s Zurich laboratory invented the 
scanning tunneling microscope (STM), and this was the largest 
advancement in nanotechnology. Rice paddies A group of IBM 
scientists using STM to create minute atomic characteristics. 16 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
As Feynman predicted [39], one example was the use of xenon 
atoms to spell “IBM” on a nickel surface. Under extremely 
controlled conditions, it took almost 24 h to produce the letters 
“IBM” (including vacuum and liquid He cooling) worth the effort. 
Moreover, the atoms are not bonded to the surface, they are 
merely adsorbed and this indicates that they were removed 
whenever there was a little change in pressure or temperature, 
to progress in the area of atomic-sized devices, it is necessary
to examine this microcosmic ecosystem.
STM enables atomic-resolution imaging of solid surfaces
[40] when a sharp tip is affixed to a piezo scanner and delivered 
to a conductive surface at around 1 nm, a tunneling current 
begins to flow (1F). In fact, STM can reveal the resolution at 
the level of individual atoms composing the surface and the 
creation of STM was followed by a rapid extension of his family 
of scanning probe microscope (SPM) techniques that are related
to STM. In 1986 invention of the atomic force microscope (AFM)
was by far the most significant of all the other techniques available
at the time [41] and standard AFM is reportedly capable of
producing ultra-high resolution line width features with a 
spatial resolution of 5 nm utilizing the DPN approach. The AFM
provides the ability to inspect non-conductive surfaces with 
its “atomic” chip; van-der-Waals force can be felt, and AFM 
is comprised of a thin, cantilever-sharp probe tip (radius 
~1–10 nm (F)), a piezoelectric 3D scanner, and optics for 
measuring the cantilever tip’s deflection. When a tip touches, 
taps, or is placed on a surface, both attracting and repulsive 
surface forces are applied and these forces cause the cantilever 
to bend and twist. It is continuously measured by deflecting the
laser beam that has been reflected. A 3D scanner shifted the 
specimen in a different design, a given surface area is scanned
by moving the cantilever in three dimensions and this instrument 
has a vertical resolution of 0.01 nm (F), which is on the order of 
atomic radii, In the first decade of the 20th century, NPs were 
observed and measured for the first time and these observations 
were principally attributable to Zsigmondy, who released a book 
in 1914 after completing extensive research on gold sols and 
other nanomaterials with sizes <10 nm. In addition, he employed Applications 17 
dark-field ultramicroscopy to view particles with sizes far smaller 
than the wavelengths of visible light and the creation of the 
scanning tunneling microscope in the 1980s and the discovery 
of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes marked the beginning of 
applications. In the 20th century, traditional approaches were 
established in the fields of interfacial and colloidal research in 
order to characterize nanobiomaterials widely employed in first￾generation passive nanobiomaterials [37], one of the saturated 
hydrocarbons is the diamonded molecule, which has a fused 
ring structure similar to a diamond and is extremely valuable
in nanotechnology. 
1.9 Applications
Diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of numerous diseases have 
been the primary applications of nanotechnology. 
1.9.1 Application in Medicine
Nanotechnology is seen as a promising field of application due 
to its unique properties that allow it to interact with bodily 
activities since living cells exist in nanoscale ranges, 
nanotechnology has a broad use in the field of medicine, and 
depending on the nature of nanotechnology, and the precision 
of its distribution, its applicability has increased dramatically. 
This has enabled numerous nanoscale inventions, including drug 
delivery, medical imaging at the molecular level, illness diagnosis, 
and other devices undergoing clinical testing [42, 43]. As it is 
still a highly competitive field, it is still undergoing development 
such developments will make it easier for patients to receive 
improved treatment for cancer, cardiovascular-related, etc. [44]. 
It has evolved into a centralized platform for assisting and 
developing several instruments in the fields of biology, medicine, 
chemistry, etc. Such activities have unlocked previously inaccessible 
dimensions for therapeutic therapies such as surgery, practice, 
and the treatment of a variety of ailments [45]. 18 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
1.9.1.1 Application in drug delivery 
There is currently a broad application of interest in nanotechnology 
for administering various therapeutic substances to their precise 
sites in order to demonstrate their effectiveness and treat a 
variety of illnesses (Fig. 1.5) [48], and various new medical 
discoveries have been made about drug delivery systems, however, 
there are still many challenges that must be handled before 
these systems can be used, and administered properly to deliver 
pharmaceuticals to a specific location, and many researchers are 
gaining an interest in the utilization of drug delivery systems, 
making this the main area of study and this enabled the creation 
of drug targeting techniques that account for the pathophysiological 
changes that occur during a sick state. 
Figure 1.5 Application of nanotechnology in drug delivery system. 
1.9.1.2 Nanotechnology in drug development 
Drug development relies heavily on the identification of 
biochemical, biophysical, and drug target features [46] and 
several sectors are attempting to reduce the price of medicine 
development despite the increase in competition, the fair 
market value has risen dramatically, resulting in increased 
pressure on numerous pharmaceutical industries. This application Applications 19 
of nanotechnology to medication research has proven to be 
both cost-effective and beneficial to work-life balance (Fig. 1.6.), 
nanoparticles have been demonstrated to drastically reduce 
toxicity and increase health, due to their excellent bio-physical 
stability and potential to be produced as controlled-release 
medications, nanoparticles of solid state have shown to be 
immensely helpful for the advancement of drug development. 
Through the utilization of nanoparticles, the formulation of 
sustained-release medications has become substantially more 
feasible and several inventions of solid nanoparticles, with or
without surface functionality, have been made to date. For 
instance, aliphatic polyesters such as poly (lactic acid), hydrophilic 
poly (glycolic acid), and their copolymers poly (lactic acid) and 
poly (glycolic acid) are aliphatic polyesters (lactide-co-glycolide) 
maintaining the particle size of NPs throughout their period of 
action increases the drug’s stability. 
Figure 1.6 Nanotechnology in drug development. 
1.9.2 Biological Application 
1.9.2.1 Treatment of cancerous diseases 
Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, and it is a multistage 
process that is carcinogenic in nature and causes a number of  
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
disorders that impact the physiological processes of the cell, such 
as apoptosis, cell signaling, etc. The utilization of nanotechnology 
has revitalized conventional cancer treatments. Radiotherapy
and chemotherapy are effective treatments used to treat cancer 
and they continue to experience disadvantages such as severe 
weakness, hair loss, GIT issues, chemoresistance, etc. [49, 50]. 
Nanotechnology utilizes genetics, engineering, chemistry, biology, 
medicine, etc., to create nanoparticles, making it the new frontier 
for scientific inquiry, development, and multidisciplinary study. It 
successfully identifies, diagnoses, and treats a variety of cancers by 
generating biodegradable nanoparticles, the defining characteristic 
of nanoparticles for medication delivery [51, 52].
Following are the nanomaterials used most frequently in 
cancer treatment (Fig. 1.7):

Applications 21 
The following are the primary characteristics of nanomaterials 
used to treat cancer: 
1. Tumor detection within the body. 
2. Approaching the tumor target without alerting normal cells. 
Numerous nanoparticles exist that are very selective and 
sensitive to cancer cells, but their mechanisms of action vary and 
these nanoparticles have the following distinctive characteristics: 
1. As a result of being coupled to polyvalent ligands, they have 
a high affinity and accuracy for target cells. 
2. They are constructed in a manner that enables their 
rapid combination for combined cancer therapy. 
3. They can inhibit the development of conventional medication 
resistance. 
4. They are designed to provide a wide range of medicinal 
effects and several investigative qualities. 
1.9.2.1.1 MOA of anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer
Anti-angiogenic medications have been discovered to be 
used interchangeably with chemotherapeutic agents; this has 
resulted in a significant shift in chemotherapy and this is due to 
defective condition of tumor blood arteries, which can inhibit 
the transfer of chemotherapeutic drugs, hence raising drug 
resistance factors. 
For instance, two layers make up their nanoparticles:
It is constructed of PLGA (polylactic-co-glycolic acid) that is 
attached to PEG and conjugated with doxorubicin. 
Combretastatin conjugated with liposomes 
• Doxorubicin (an anti-cancer drug) and Combretastatin 
(anti-angiogenic) in both mouse and human models, it has 
proven effective against melanoma and lung carcinomas
[54] and their nanoparticles have two layers: 
a. Core: PLGA is connected to doxorubicin and attached 
to PEG. 
b. Liposome-conjugated combretastatin. 
This allowed easy absorption of the drug by the tumor 
on intravenous administration into tumor-mediated mice and 
positive results were seen as the tumor growth was inhibited.  
 
 
 
 
22 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
• Another study showed that upon administration of dual
drug-loaded magnetic nanoparticles there was an increase 
in cell penetration and showed synergistic effects. 
• Another study showed the use of double drug delivery
through the formation of drugs used for breast cancer 
which were formulated by encapsulation of hydrophilic
and hydrophobic anticancer drugs where HER-2 is the 
drug target [55]. 
1.9.2.1.2 Theranostics
Theragnostic is a new field that focuses on the relationship
between diagnosis and treatment with its assistance, treatment 
has become quicker, more effective, and simpler biocompatible 
nanoparticles are still undergoing investigation to provide
effective cancer treatment, noninvasive technology, as well 
as detection. In recent investigations, scientists have encased 
SiRNA within tiny gold nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles have 
been useful for stimulating improved gene silencing and sensory 
optical imaging [56]. 
1.9.2.2 Ophthalmic applications
As it would be challenging to maintain enough medication 
concentrations in the precorneal area, this results in malabsorption 
in the eye, which is one of the primary complications associated 
with the topical administration of ophthalmic medications, In 
comparison to their non-nanotech counterparts, nanoparticles 
have significantly improved the duration of a drug’s effect by 
extending its half-life by up to 20 min with the introduction of 
nanoparticle-based ophthalmic medicines, bioavailability has 
increased, adverse effects have decreased, and intraocular dose 
levels have increased [55]. The commercially available Eudragit 
polymer was restudied by scientists; rabbits were administered 
non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory medicines in the eye.
The composition of Eudragit RS and RL is as follows: 
1. Poly (ethyl acrylate), 
2. Poly (methyl methacrylate), 
3. Poly (chloro trimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate).  
 
 
Applications 23
It was administered in the following way: 
1. Drug-polymer combinations were mixed in ethanol 
and emulsified to generate drug-infused nanoparticles 
measuring 100 nm. 
2. Rabbit eyes had nanoparticles floating in the conjunctival 
sac. 
3. Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen-filled nanoparticles successfully 
inhibited the post-surgical trauma-induced inflammatory 
response observed in the rabbit. 
This resulted in greater medication concentrations in the 
ocular region compared to traditional ophthalmic medicines 
available on the market [56] also known to cause permanent
injury and surrounding tissue is cytomegalovirus. Bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) contains the antiviral drug ganciclovir, which is 
used to treat CMV (cytomegalovirus) infections, and it is 
nanoformulated by emulsifying BSA in an aqueous solution 
during incubation, after which ethanol is added to aid in the 
production of droplets. Its nanoparticle has an approximate
diameter of 280 nm to give this formulation, it is first reconstituted 
in saline and then administered intravenously [57]. Another 
study proposed an isotonic solution of HPMC (hydroxyl propyl 
methylcellulose) with chitosan/hyaluronic acid/sodium 
tripolyphosphate nanoparticles and ceftazidime as an additional 
antibiotic, and it was evaluated for efficacy, and shown to 
possess features such as mucoadhesion, and enhanced contact 
with ocular mucosa, as well as delayed antibiotic release. This 
demonstrates that nanoparticles can help prolong a drug’s
half-life and maintain antibacterial activity, making them 
appropriate as the first-line drug for ocular drug delivery systems 
[58]. Dendrimers, another type of nanoformulation, can be utilized 
as medicine delivery systems for the eyes and these dendrimers 
are coupled to the substance puerarin and polyamidoamine 
(PAMAM), which have been found to boost the drug delivery
system and therapeutic efficacy when delivered to rabbits in 
comparison to puerarin eye drops.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
1.9.2.3 Application in cardiovascular disease 
The primary cause of death for the majority of the population are 
cardiovascular disorders, which include: 
1. Atherosclerosis 
2. Myocardial infarction 
3. Stroke 
4. Hypertension 
5. Heart failure 
The key method for the prevention and treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases is early identification, and there are 
various techniques to diagnose CVDs, which are as follows: 
1. X-ray 
2. Electrocardiography (ECG) 
3. Computed tomography (CT) scan 
4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
Due to the complication of the disease’s pathogenesis, early￾stage diagnosis is still a difficult issue; hence, the techniques 
are generally ineffective, despite their continued usefulness. 
Therefore, procedures that are faster, more reliable, and more
exact are required to locate CVDs [59, 60]. The use of nanotechnology 
and cardiac immunoassay to diagnose and treat early-stage
cardiovascular diseases has proven to be more effective than 
conventional treatments and immunoassays combined with 
nanotechnology include: 
1. Immunoassay for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) 
2. Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) 
3. Immunoassay using an enzyme linker (ELISA) 
Features of nanotechnology are: 
1. Excessive binding cardiac targets 
2. Affordable bioavailability 
3. Limits non-precise binding sites 
4. Allows easy flow across the body 
5. Provides better diagnostic accuracy [59] 
Fluorescent compounds are a standard option for nanomaterial 
conjugation, and quantum dots that are fluorescently labeled, 
and utilized for imaging atherosclerotic plaques are one example. Applications 25 
These nanoparticles have yielded excellent results, as they can 
be recognized by MRI, which reveals the organization of plaques 
and thrombi, including macrophagic components, necrotic 
substances, hemorrhages, etc. Super-paramagnetic nanoparticles 
are an additional type of material that boosts MRI sensitivity. They 
contribute to improved signaling [61, 62] using these materials 
(cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles), and macrophagic plaques 
were found in a study [63, 64]. 
1.9.2.4 Application in respiratory disease
There is limited evidence that nanotechnology-based drug 
delivery devices can effectively treat respiratory illnesses, Asthma 
and other anaphylactic disorders are known to cause airway
inflammation due to hypersensitivity. This is a result of the 
patients’ decreased interferon (IFN) proliferation when patients 
deficient in IFN were given chitosan-IFN, a drug-polymer conjugate, 
their inflamed airways decreased. Thus according to research 
this therapy boosted the production of IFN by epithelial cells 
and decreased lung inflammation [65], another work by scientists 
has demonstrated the use of nanoparticles derived from 
liposomes as medication delivery devices when supplied to 
an asthmatic mouse model, the results indicated a decline in 
inflammation, and this study’s primary objective is to inhibit the 
P-selectin and PSGL 1 receptors on activated endothelial cells 
in circulation. This demonstrated the least number of contacts 
between leukocytes and endothelial cells, hence reducing the 
course of bronchial inflammation [66]. 
1.9.2.5 Application in CNS disorders
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a significant impact on the 
application of nanotechnology to neurological illnesses, and it 
surrounds the brain, which is the most intricate organ in the 
human body. It permits only medications with a high degree of 
lipophilicity or molecular weight of 400–600 Da or less to be 
permeable. Furthermore, the presence of BBB is a considerable 
barrier to the treatment of neurological illnesses due to their 
high hydrophilicity, many medications used to treat CNS illnesses 
cannot cross the BBB, preventing them from reaching their intended  
 
 
 
 
26 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
target. Therefore, treatment choices for neurological illnesses 
are restricted to prevent this, nanoparticles with conjugated 
polymer coatings that allow them to penetrate the BBB are utilized, 
facilitating the early identification and treatment of neurological 
illnesses, and they can traverse the BBB’s tight cell connections,
and are encapsulated with ligands to function as site-specific
medicines. Majorly, Polymeric nanoparticles are used for example: 
1. PIHCA (poly isohexyl cyanoacrylate) 
2. Butyl cyanoacrylate 
3. PLA (Polylactic acid) 
4. PLGA (lactide-co-glycolide), copolymer 
5. HSA (Human serum albumin) 
Nanoparticles for CNS drug delivery require non-specific 
binding medications, and surface modifications and BBB transport 
conjugations such as VEGF, EGF, insulin, albumin, transferrin, 
lactoferrin, and angiopep-2 will dramatically boost nanoparticle 
kinetics due to the Lf receptor on the BBB surface. For example, 
lactoferrin nanoparticle conjugation results in more BBB absorption 
than non-conjugated nanoparticles. Taxol-carrying NPs may
improve brain endothelial cell aggregation in brain cancer when 
paired with transferrin while doxorubicin is an anti-cancer 
medication due to the BBB, it’s not a good brain tumor treatment 
when it is encapsulated in a polysorbate-80 nanoparticle, it crossed 
the BBB. Polysorbate surfactant absorbs surface apolipoprotein B 
and E the main effect is receptor-mediated brain capillary
endocytosis.
Magnetic nanoparticles are also effective at delivering anti￾cancer drugs in the presence of a magnetic field, they are first 
magnetized, and they are utilized successfully because they may 
be directed to the appropriate places and improve absorption. 
This aids in minimizing off-target action using cytotoxic
medications in conjunction with a magnetic field enabling the 
drug to be released through the enzymatic process or by altering 
physiological circumstances, resulting in enhanced absorption at 
the tumor target sites [67, 68] and multi-functional microbubbles 
(MBs) containing doxorubicin in combination with MNPs, for 
instance, blood samples were taken and iron oxide nanoparticles  
 
Applications 27 
were isolated using RES in one study once iron oxide nanoparticles 
have penetrated cells, such as macrophages, MRI can detect their 
presence and this could be a highly efficient method for assessing 
the composition of the BBB and monitoring macrophage activity 
in a range of inflammatory illnesses [69]. Ferumoxtran-10, a 
dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticle, serves as a stable imaging 
marker to remove brain tumors during surgery [70]. Ab40 or 
Ab42 beta-amyloid peptides are utilized to diagnose AD (brain
and blood vessel walls) and some of the researchers coupled 
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with the following substances in
a study: 
1. Ab1-42 peptide which is used for the identification of
amyloid plaque deposition 
2. polyethylene glycol which is used for the improvement of 
brain permeability 
Its result was shown through a contrasting MRI where 
significant imaging capability was seen and the contrasting MRI
was done between AD transgenic mice and Wild type mice. 
1.9.3 Utilization within Biomedical Engineering
1.9.3.1 Medical types of equipment
1.9.3.1.1 Surgical blades
Since prehistoric times, surgical blades have been utilized due to 
the transition from traditional instruments to hard-diamond and 
gold-coated blades, the evolution of surgical blades has gained 
widespread attention due to their typical low physical adherence 
to tissues, chemicals, biological membranes, etc., diamonds 
are utilized as nanocoatings on surgical blades. They are the 
preferred material given the low coefficient of friction, which 
reduces the coefficient of penetration force [71], and the blades 
on the instruments are razor-sharp and extremely thin for making
precise cuts because plasma polishing reduces the blade’s 
thickness by 5–25 μm ± 0.5 μm thus, they are ideal for ophthalmic 
and neurosurgical procedures [72]. 28 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
1.9.3.1.2 Invasive surgery
After the invention of catheters, low-invasive surgical procedures 
have been utilized. As a result of the employment of multi-walled 
carbon nanotubes as filters on the matrix bed (nylon 12), polymer￾reinforced catheters comprised of nanotubes are now available 
in vivo, and in vitro testing has resulted in the development of 
better catheters with lower thrombogenicity, maximum fracture 
toughness, and enhanced mechanical and electrostatic properties 
[73]. 
1.9.3.1.3 Optical forceps
There are several types of surgical instruments that feature only 
one gradient light trap for exploiting nano-sized substances such 
as viruses and DNA and light is employed to study the dynamics 
instead of force and tweezers. Consequently, this technique is 
often characterized as non-invasive [74]. 
1.9.3.1.4 Tissue engineering
The advancement of tissue engineering has enabled us to replace 
damaged or destroyed biological tissues [75], and it is believed
that this is the primary goal of organ transplants, skin grafts, 
and bone replacement procedures this section describes tissue 
engineering. 
1.9.3.1.5 Bone tissue engineering
The presence of collagen in bones facilitates their repair and 
regeneration due to their great compatibility, porous 3D scaffolds 
with compositions like bone and bio-ceramic are utilized to 
treat skeletal deformities and massive bone defects [76]. For
osteogenesis, these scaffolds employ biomolecular signaling and 
progenitor cells. According to studies, nanoparticles have been 
produced that release osteogenic substances in vitro to encourage 
new bone production while preserving the 3D structure [77]. 
1.9.3.1.6 Nerve tissue engineering
The emergence of nerve tissue engineering, which aids in nerve 
regeneration and repair, has altered the entire perspective
of Neurotherapy, and nerve tissue engineering is incredibly The Risk of Nanotechnology 29 
advantageous since it fills the 6 mm gaps between neurons and
has a structure very similar to scaffolds [78] utilized nanofibers
have a three-dimensional fibrous (3D) structure >1 μm, and it
has been discovered that they boost internal cell development 
and are more tolerant in nature. Electrospinning was utilized by 
researchers to create Nanofiber PPLA, for instance, the procedure 
is highly effective and contributes to the formation of polymeric 
nanofibers, which enhance neural stem adhesion, growth, and 
differentiation [79]. 
1.10 The Risk of Nanotechnology
Numerous researchers are interested in nanotechnology, which 
has diverse applications including medicine, health care, etc. 
However, with the benefits came dangerous side effects that have 
garnered considerable attention, and several studies describe the 
harmful consequences of some nanoparticles as a result of their 
hazardous features. 
1.10.1 Reduced Size of Nanoparticles
Nanoparticle size has both benefits and drawbacks for the human 
body, on the other hand, they penetrate undesirable cells and 
tissue to produce pharmacological effects on normal cells, tissues, 
and so on If this occurs, it becomes nearly impossible to extract 
these nanoparticles, and doing so may have hazardous effects. 
1.10.1.1 Different shapes
Nanoparticles come in a variety of forms. Such a change in form 
can have hazardous and harmful repercussions on the drug’s 
target, for instance, zinc oxide particles can take the form of rods 
and spheres, and the latter nanoparticles are less hazardous than 
rod-shaped nanoparticles that can have harmful effects on the
lung epithelium. 
1.10.1.2 Motility correlation
Size and mobility are adversely connected as nanoparticles
are nanometer-sized, their mobility is high, and high migration  
 
 
30 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
speeds allow rapid penetration of cells, tissues, etc. In the cells and 
tissues, aggregation can have harmful effects. 
1.10.1.3 Aggregation
Nanoparticles are stabilized by their aggregation or clustering 
within cells and tissues and this feature can result in a variety of 
physiological abnormalities other anomalies are generated by 
certain nanoparticle features, such as magnetic properties, and 
strong conductivity [81]. 
1.11 Limitations of Nanotechnology
Nanomedicine is so new that there isn’t much proof that it 
works yet, and it is still being tested because of this, it is hard to 
prove that its use is completely safe but we can say for sure that 
nanoparticles can get into our bodies in many ways and that
this is something to worry about it although it is known to have 
many benefits it still cannot be mentioned as a furnished field.
The main reason behind this is due to their decreased particle 
size which went from being micro-sized to nano-sized. 
1. The main limitation of nanoparticles is that there is nothing 
common between them except for their size, so each particle 
should be separately tested and judged. 
2. Inside our organs, nanoparticles exist in collaboration with 
the Mononuclear Phagocytic System (MPS) which traps them 
due to their decreased size, the surface area is significantly 
accentuated which leads to high chemical reactivity and 
causing instabilities in their behavior, thereby altering their 
mechanism of action. This level of chemical reactivity results 
in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROSs 
produce oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to 
proteins, DNA, and different membranes, all of which have 
negative consequences. 
3. Materials that are non-hazardous in nature at particle
size 100 nm turn into hazardous materials when their size 
becomes 1 nm, and this demonstrates that variations in 
nanoparticle size result in the development of hazardous 
compounds.  
Drug Delivery Systems 31 
4. There may be interactions not illustrated that contribute 
to the creation of dangerous chemicals, therefore, it proves 
that they are sensitive to the materials present in their 
environment. 
Nanoparticles may reveal undesirable outcomes on 
administration due to their nano size, they can infiltrate numerous 
organs, cells, and capillaries, and can even cross the BBB 
unknown consequences may occur in numerous areas inside the 
body, including damage to the nucleus, mitochondria, and cellular 
processes. These systems are designed to reduce undesirable 
effects, yet they are themselves harmful and there are still 
numerous difficulties, such as ethical, legal, etc., that must be
resolved in order to get support for the administration of 
nanotechnology, despite its extensive application in future 
formulations for diseases such as cancer to avert criticism, these 
difficulties must be addressed, and the public must be made
aware of the benefits and risks of nanotechnology. 
1.12 Drug Delivery Systems
1.12.1 Drug Delivery
The application and study of drug delivery have expanded 
significantly, and it enables enhanced methods of administering 
therapeutically active medicines [48] even though there are 
several concerns with the medication delivery system that requires 
public attention, the medical system has deployed numerous 
drug delivery technologies. Following elements influence the 
formulation of drug delivery systems: 
1. Concentration of the therapeutic agent.
2. Prolonged duration of action 
3. Efficacious 
Pathophysiological modifications were done to bring this 
system into effect which may allow easier binding to the target.
It covers a variety of systems that help in controlled drug 
release, and there are various challenges that pose an issue for 
the working of such an integrated system. They are as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
32 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
1. Cross-checking of the intervention context 
2. Quantifying the readiness of the system toward a change 
3. Cross-checking fidelity and sustainability 
4. Cross-check multicomponent interventions and complexes 
5. Rationing time in models of delivery systems so that the 
recommendations can be discussed 
Previously utilized techniques, for instance, permit systemic 
circulation of the drug, resulting in just a tiny amount reaching
the tumor target location, this can be remedied by employing 
tumor-specific drug delivery systems, which will accumulate at
the target site without affecting other organs, hence enhancing 
efficacy while decreasing unwanted effects [82].
Drug delivery has two approaches [83]: 
1. Passive drug approach 
2. Active drug approach or ligand-based. 
For drug targeting and disease-targeting, numerous 
anticancer medicines have been synthesized as nanoformulations 
utilizing nanoparticles that facilitate the uptake of poorly soluble
medications [84, 85]. Anticancer medicines like paclitaxel [86, 87], 
doxorubicin [88], 5-fluorouracil [89], and dexamethasone [90], 
are utilized to produce nanoformulations, for instance, PLGA and 
polylactic acid (PLA) are used to encapsulate dexamethasone, and 
dexamethasone, an anticancer medication, has anti-inflammatory 
and anti-proliferative effects.
Drugs primarily exert their effects by binding to cytoplasmic 
receptors, which then form drug-receptor complexes and are 
delivered to the nucleus, where gene expression occurs [90].
The nanoformulations exhibit regulated drug release over a 
longer period and suppress the proliferation of vascular smooth 
muscle, and these drug delivery methods are effective due to 
their tiny size, reduced toxicity, or adverse effects, regulated drug 
release, and enhanced bioavailability. Certainly, cancers acquire 
anticancer drug resistance, rendering chemotherapy ineffective,
and a protein called p-glycoprotein induces resistance in tumors, 
causing them to eliminate cancer medications as soon as they 
cross the cell membrane. Here, nanoformulations can be utilized. 
According to new research, nanoparticles may be able to deliver Bio-Polymers 33 
anticancer medications to cells without activating the p-glycoprotein 
pump [87, 91]. 
1.13 Bio-Polymers
There are various bio-polymeric substances used in medication 
delivery systems. Following is a discussion of the materials and 
their qualities. 
1.13.1 Chitosan
Chitosan has mucoadhesive characteristics and can influence 
epithelial tight junctions. Consequently, chitosan-based nano￾particles have been widely employed for sustained drug delivery 
systems in many types of epithelia, such as buccal [94], gut [95],
nose [96], eyes [97], and lung [98]. According to a study by Silva
et al. [99] for ocular delivery of the antibiotic ceftazidime, an 
isotonic solution of hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose (HPMC) 
containing chitosan/sodium tri polyphosphate/hyaluronic acid 
nanoparticles was produced and assessed by measuring the 
viscosity of nanoparticles interacting with various mucin mass 
fractions, rheological synergy parameters were determined in 
the presence of mucin, chitosan nanoparticles exhibited minimal 
viscosity. However, nanoparticles are mucoadhesive, resulting 
in favorable contact with ocular mucosa and long-term release of 
antibiotics, thereby increasing the drug’s lifetime in the eyes with 
the aid of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles did not affect ARPE-19
and HEK 239T cell lines, and antimicrobial nanoparticles are 
promising for mucoadhesive ophthalmic medication delivery.
Pistone’s colleagues [100] made chitosan, alginate, and pectin 
nanoparticles for oral medicine, and the solubility of nanoparticles 
in saliva and oral cell lines was used to measure biocompatibility 
and cytotoxicity following pectin and chitosan, alginate nano￾particles are the least stable in artificial saliva after 2 h. 
and pectin and alginate thereby were cytotoxic, although 
chitosan was cell-competitive while Zn2+ may account for the 
cytotoxicity (a cross-linker) each formulation has advantages
and disadvantages compared to oral delivery and required 34 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
modification. Carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles for intranasal 
carbamazepine (CBZ) release were developed to overcome the 
BBB, improving drug delivery to the brain, enhancing therapeutic 
efficacy, and facilitating systemic distribution. The nanoparticles 
have a diameter of 218.76±2.41 nm, a drug loading of 35%, and 
encapsulation efficiency of 80% brain CBZ concentrations were 
higher than plasma concentrations for 240 min (P < 0.05). In a 
separate investigation, Jain [102] analyzed the release profile 
of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) from hyaluronic acid-coated chitosan 
nanoparticles following oral administration, and experiments
involving the release of 5-FU exhibited resistance to stomach 
and small-intestinal excretion in conditions that simulated the 
gastrocolic transition in the treatment of colon cancer, increased 
local drug concentrations result in longer exposure durations, 
hence enhancing anticancer efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. 
1.13.2 Alginate
Alginate is another biopolymer substance that has been 
utilized for medication delivery, this biopolymer is an anionic 
mucoadhesive polymer, which sticks to mucus better than 
cationic polymers and neutral polymers [59, 118]; In order to
lower serum glucose levels and increase serum insulin levels in 
diabetic rats, insulin-loaded alginate nanoparticles containing 
nicotinamide as a penetrant were developed by Patil and 
Devarajan [103]. In the presence of nicotinamide, nanoparticles 
delivered sublingually (5 IU/kg) exhibited high pharmacological 
availability (>100%) and bioavailability (>80%) using a 
streptozotocin-induced diabetes mouse model, it was found 
that NPs can carry insulin through the sublingual route with a 
pharmacologically higher 20.2% than a 1 IU/kg subcutaneous 
injection, and there was a potential 24.1% demonstrating
the bioavailability of [103]. Haque et al. [104] made alginate
nanoparticles that can be used to deliver venlafaxine (VLF) through 
the nose to treat depression, in fact, the concentration of VLF
in the brain was higher when alginate nanoparticles were given 
through the nose than when VLF was given through the nose or 
through a vein shows that VLF can enter the brain directly, and 
we demonstrate the proven delivery superiority of nanoformula­Bio-Polymers 35 
tions, thus, these nanoparticles have the potential to treat 
depression. In another instance, Román and colleagues conducted 
research [105], and the researchers attached the epidermal growth 
factor to the external surface of alginate microcapsules to target 
non-small cell lung cancer cells, and carcinogenic cisplatin was 
also included in the nanoparticles, and the addition of EGF 
considerably enhanced the specificity of the carrier system, 
resulting in a higher rate of cell killing (H460 lung cancer line) 
compared to the medication alone under stomach pH conditions, 
less than 5% of the AR in the system was released, but rapid and 
extensive release was seen under conditions of gut pH. Hence, the 
carrier demonstrated the ability to preserve molecules released 
from the gastrointestinal tract following oral delivery. Costa et al. 
[107] designed chitosan-coated alginate nanoparticles to improve 
the ocular epithelial penetration of daptomycin and produce an 
antibacterial effect using an eye epithelial cell culture paradigm, 
the permeability was evaluated in vitro, the antibacterial efficacy
of nano-encapsulated daptomycin against pathogens associated 
with bacterial endophthalmitis seemed promising. According to 
ocular permeability investigations, a 4 h treatment with 9–12% 
HCE and ARPE-19 cells was permeable to total daptomycin enclosed 
within chitosan-alginate nanoparticles such investigations imply 
that this method improved the retention of drugs in the ocular 
epithelium. 
1.13.3 Xanthan Gum
Xanthan gum (XG) is a high-molecular-weight heteropoly￾saccharide produced by Xanthomonas campestris, and this 
polyanionic polysaccharide possesses outstanding bioadhesive 
properties, Xanthan gum, which is non-toxic and non-irritating, can 
be used as a cosmetic ingredient [108]. The violation of xanthan 
gum has increased the buccal mucosa’s adherence as compared 
to indigenous xanthan gum, additionally, the xanthan gum
thiolate absorbs more saliva than the oral mucosa-drying tannic 
acid. Therefore, this technique will be an effective method for 
lowering salivary flow in people with sialorrhea, and angiogenesis 
is a crucial aspect of soft tissue regeneration. Huang et al. [110] 
developed injectable hydrogels consisting of aldehyde-modified  
 
 
 
36 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
xanthan, and carboxymethyl-modified chitosan that contained a 
potent angiogenic agent (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, 
VEGF) to enhance abdominal wall restoration, and hydrogel
is more effective in the digestive tract and wound tissues. Hydrogel 
VEGF stimulated angiogenesis and repaired the abdominal wall 
in a recent study, Menzel et al. [111] sought to identify new 
excipients for usage as nasal release systems, Cys-MNA was 
linked with xanthan gum, the primary polymer in the resultant 
conjugation, characteristics such as the quantity of the associated 
binder, mucoadhesive qualities, and stability against degradation 
was evaluated each gram of polymer underwent ligation with 
252.5220.54 mol of the binder compared to thiolated xanthan,
the grafted polymer has 1.7 times the mucoadhesion. Moreover, 
nasal epithelial cell ciliary beating was reduced and only
reversed when the polymer was removed. 
1.13.4 Cellulose
Cellulose and its derivatives are commonly utilized in drug 
delivery systems to improve solubility and gelation and control 
drug release [112]. Elseoud et al. [113] investigated repaglinide’s 
oral release (an anti-hyperglycemic mic), and RPG nanoparticles 
are chitosan and cellulose nanocrystal hybrid nanoparticles. 
Nanocrystals made of oxidized cellulose and chitosan hybrid had 
an RPG mean diameter of 251–310 nm. Their sustained release 
is owing to the presence of hydrogen bonds between the 
cellulose nanocrystals and the drug, and the nanoparticles
synthesized with oxidized cellulose nanocrystals had a reduced 
release behavior than those manufactured with native cellulose 
nanocrystals. In a study conducted by Hansen and colleagues 
[115] four cellulose derivatives were identified, including: 
• Methylcellulose 
• Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 
• Sodium carboxymethylcellulose 
• Cationic hydroxyethyl cellulose 
They are mostly utilized for medication delivery to the nasal 
mucosa and the combination of these cellulose analogs including  
 
 
Bio-Polymers 37 
an extra-active ingredient was also evaluated, the prototype 
medicine for this approach was acyclovir. Moreover, the ciliary 
beat frequency (CBF) and nasal tissue infusion were assessed
to determine the suitability of these polymers for nasal release 
applications when cellulose derivatives and polymer graft
copolymers were mixed, thermally induced viscosity improved. 
Additionally, when acyclovir was coupled with cationic hydroxyethyl 
cellulose, nasal mucosal penetration was enhanced analysis of 
CBF demonstrated that none of the natural polymers had harmful 
impacts on the nasal mucosa’s tissues and cells. 
1.13.5 Liposomes
Alec Bangham developed liposomes during the 1960s, In the 
pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, liposomes are utilized 
for the delivery of numerous compounds, and they are one 
of the most studied vehicle systems for drug delivery, and 
liposomes are a prevalent formulation technique for improving 
medication delivery, and they are spherical vesicles consisting
of phospholipids and steroids with a typical size range of 
50–450 nm [116]. Their membrane features resemble those
of cell membranes, and they are regarded as superior drug 
delivery vehicles because they enhance drug absorption into the 
plasma stream [116]. In addition, it has been demonstrated to 
stabilize therapeutic molecules, enhance biodistribution, 
compatibility with hydrophilic and hydrophobic medicines, 
biocompatibility, and biodegradability. The following four types 
of liposomes are distinguished. 
(1) Conventional liposomes: They consist of a lipid bilayer
capable of forming either anionic, cationic, or neutral 
cholesterol or phospholipids surrounding an aqueous
core element. In this case, both the lipid bilayer and the 
aqueous space can be filled with hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic materials, respectively. 
(2) PEGylated types: The liposome surface incorporates
polyethylene glycol (PEG) to provide steric balance. 
(3) ligand-targeted type: The liposome surface incorporates 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) to provide steric balance.  
38 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
(4) Type of theranostic liposomes: It consists of nanoparticles
in addition to targeting, imaging, and therapeutic
characteristics [117]. 
The following is an example of a method for synthesizing 
liposomes among these include thin-layer hydration, mechanical 
agitation, solvent evaporation, solvent infusion, and surfactant 
solubilization [118]. Notably, the drugs enclosed within 
liposomes are inaccessible until they are released to maximize the 
bioavailability of medications inside the therapeutic window at 
the ideal rate and duration, it is essential that they accumulate
at certain sites liposomes can be loaded with drugs both actively 
(drug trapping following liposome synthesis) and passively
(synthesis of liposomes with drug entrapment) [119] in aqueous 
core of liposomes, hydrophilic medications like ampicillin and 
its 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine are typically found; thus, the drug/
lipid ratio is irrelevant for encapsulation. However, hydrophobic 
ones were discovered in the acyl hydrocarbon chains of 
liposomes, including amphotericin B and indomethacin indicating 
that acyl chain composition influences their entanglement
[120]. Mechanically, solvent dispersion, and surfactant removal 
techniques are all examples of passive loading strategies
[119]. RES (Reticuloendothelial System), Opsonization, and 
Immunogenic Drug Delivery Formulations, to overcome these 
difficulties. However, properties like enhanced permeability and
the EPR (retention impact) can be used to the drug’s advantage 
as they circulate through the bloodstream, liposomes meet 
opsonins, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and low-density
lipoproteins (LDL) after they enter the body. Opsonins (including 
immunoglobulins and fibronectin) assist RES in identifying and 
eliminating liposomes. HDL and LDL interact with liposomes to 
destabilize them and liposomes tend to concentrate in organs 
like the liver and spleen. This is advantageous because high 
concentrations of liposomes are beneficial for treating pathogenic 
disorders, whereas the clearance of lipophilic liposomes is 
delayed in malignancies drugs can result in drug use as stated 
at the outset, various forms of liposomes have been generated 
as a result. Dymov et al. [121] described a continuous synthesis, 
functionalization, and purification of liposomes using flow systems, 
and the study includes sub-300 nm vesicles in a lab-on-a-chip,  
 
Bio-Polymers 39 
which are candidates to produce expensive medications and 
protein encapsulation [121]. The production cost of medicine 
impacts whether it can be commercialized. 
1.13.6 Polymeric Micelles
Micelles are nanostructures of amphiphilic block copolymers that 
self-assemble in an aqueous solution to form core-shell structures, 
and the hydrophobic core can be loaded with hydrophobic 
medicines (camptothecin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, etc.), while 
the hydrophilic shell makes the entire system water soluble 
and stabilizes the hydrophobic core. Polymeric micelles are 
often narrowly dispersed to avoid rapid renal elimination and 
accumulate in tumor tissue through EPR effects. Moreover, their 
polymeric coating inhibits nonspecific interactions with biological
components, and the inner core structure of these nanostructures 
allows for the inclusion of hydrophobic medicines, resulting 
in increased stability and bioavailability [123, 122]. There are 
two methods for creating polymeric micelles: 
(1) Direct polymer dissolving using a solvent, followed by a 
dialysis process. 
(2) Addition of a solvent causes one block to precipitate
[123, 124]. 
Micelle production is influenced by variables such as the 
amphiphilic molecule’s hydrophobic chain length, concentration, 
solvent system, and temperature [125]. When amphipathic
molecules reach a minimum concentration known as the critical 
micelle concentration (CMC) [124], micelle production commences 
amphipathic molecules are tiny and arise independently at 
low quantities [124]. In general, three methods are utilized to 
load medicines into polymeric micelles: (1) direct dissolution,
(2) solvent evaporation, and (3) dialysis. In direct dissolution,
the copolymer and active ingredient self-assemble in an aqueous 
media to generate micelle-containing active ingredients in the 
solvent evaporation method, a volatile organic solvent is used 
to dissolve the copolymer and the drug of interest, and in the 
dialysis method, both the drug in solution and the copolymer in 
the organic solvent are inserted into the dialysis bag, the substance 40 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
is dialyzed, then bind to form micelles [126]. Different methods
of action, such as boosting permeability and stimulating retention 
effects, are proven using distinct polymeric micelles to target 
pharmaceuticals. Complexation of target-specific ligand molecules 
to the surface of micelles; or by combining monoclonal antibodies 
against micellar coronas [127] according to reports, polymeric 
micelles can be used for both anticancer drug administration [124] 
and ocular medication delivery [128]. 
1.13.7 Dendrimers
Dendrimers are monodispersed, highly branching, well-defined 
3Dl structures due to their spherical form and the ease with 
which their surfaces can be functionalized in a regulated manner, 
these structures are attractive drug targets [129, 130]. 
Dendrimers can be synthesized in two different ways, the first
is an alternative path in which the dendrimer is generated from 
its core and subsequently grows outward, whereas the second 
is a convergent route beginning from the dendrimer’s exterior
[130, 131] according to their functionalization units, dendrimers
are categorized as PAMAM, PPI, liquid crystal, core-shell, chiral, 
peptide, glycodendrimer, and PAMAMOS. PAMAM is extensively 
explored for oral medication delivery due to its water solubility 
and ability to be bridged to promote transmission via paracellular 
and epithelial routes [132] due to the presence of amine groups, 
dendrimers have restricted therapeutic applicability. These 
groups are positively charged or cationic and poisonous, hence 
dendrimers are typically altered to decrease or remove this 
issue, and the processes for drug loading onto dendrimers are 
simple encapsulation, electrostatic interactions, and covalent 
binding [133].
Dendrimers essentially release drugs in two distinct ways, 
alterations towards the environment’s physical conditions, which 
covers temperature and pH, and impact in medication effects 
[133] for transdermal, oral, ocular, respiratory, and selective drug 
administration, dendrimers have been synthesized [134]. Jain 
et al [135] “As a model, they presented folic acid-conjugated
poly-L-lysine dendrimers (doxorubicin hydrochloride) for pH￾dependent drug release, target selectivity, anti-angiogenic and Bio-Polymers 41 
anti-neoplastic properties as a potential cancer prevention
medication carrier”. Those individuals were administered 
doxorubicin-folic acid after 24 h, compared to free doxorubicin, 
coupled poly-L-lysine dendrimers elevated the doxorubicin level 
in tumors by 121.5%. Similarly, Kaur et al. [136] exhibited delayed 
release, enhanced cellular uptake, and low cytotoxicity against
the MCF-7 cell line MTX -FAPPI) must also be mentioned compared 
to free methotrexate, it is selectively taken up by cancer 
cells (MTX). 
1.13.8 Inorganic Nanoparticles
Inorganic nanoparticles consist of nanoparticles of silver, 
gold, iron oxide, and silica, and they are not the subject of as 
many studies as other nanoparticle varieties covered in this 
section, even though they have certain outstanding applications.
However, only a few nanoparticles have been approved for 
their respective clinical applications, while the majority are 
still undergoing clinical trials. Metal nanoparticles, such as 
silver and gold, possess certain properties, such as SPR (surface 
Plasmon resonance). Liposomes, dendrimers, and micelles do not 
possess such features, they have demonstrated numerous 
benefits, including biocompatibility and surface functionalization
adaptability studies of drug delivery-related activity do not 
reveal whether the drug exists in particulate or ionized form, or 
if they are associated with its toxicity.
Two methods have been suggested: 
1. paracellular transport 
2. transcytosis 
However, there are limited data on their in vivo transport and 
absorption process [137] by methods of ionic or covalent bonding
and physical absorption, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) can be 
employed in conjugated forms with pharmaceuticals, and their 
release and distribution can be regulated by biological cues or 
light activation [138]. Silver nanoparticles are believed to exhibit 
antimicrobial activity, but in the case of drug delivery, only a few 
studies have been conducted, such as Prusty and Swain’s [139] 
synthesis of an interlinked and spongy polyacrylamide/dextran 42 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
nanohydrogels hybrid system with covalently connected silver 
nanoparticles for the release of ornidazole, leading to a 98.5% 
in vitro release [139]. Additionally, another study found that 
nanoparticles of iron oxide were generated using laser pyrolysis 
and coated with Violamycine B1 and anthracycline antibiotics 
using commercial formulations, researchers compared the 
cytotoxicity, and anti-proliferation properties of iron oxide 
nanoparticles against MCF-7 cells [140]. 
1.13.9 Nanocrystals
Drug particles with a diameter of 1000 nm are called nanocrystals 
in order to soften the suspension of the nanocrystals in the liquid 
rim media, surfactants are frequently used in nanosuspension. 
In this scenario, the dispersion medium is predominantly water 
or non-aqueous solution including liquid polyethylene glycols 
and oils [141, 142]. Unique characteristics of nanocrystals allow 
them to overcome hurdles such as improved saturation solubility, 
higher dissolving rate, and improved surface/cell membrane 
adherence. The nanocrystal production method can be separated 
into top-down and bottom-up ways; Top-down procedures 
include sonocrystallization, precipitation, high-gravity controlled 
precipitation techniques, multi-inlet vortex mixing techniques,
and restricted liquid-jet precipitation techniques [141]. However, 
the use of organic solvents and their subsequent cleanup make 
this procedure quite costly. In the bottom-up method, grinding 
and high-pressure homogenization occur at the same time [141]. 
Milling, high-pressure homogenization, and precipitation are 
the most often employed techniques for producing nanocrystals 
improved solubility, suspension velocity, and intestinal wall 
adhesion are among the mechanisms by which nanocrystals 
facilitate medication absorption [141]. Ni et al. [142] to carry 
hydrophobic medicines via the lung, nanocrystals of cinaciguate 
are encased in chitosan microparticles utilizing the swelling, 
and mucoadhesive capabilities of the polymer, nanoparticles for 
continuous medication release were created, and they discovered 
that inhalation efficacy may be demonstrated during illness
settings; however, additional research is required to demonstrate 
this system’s greater potential [142].  
 
 
 
 
Bio-Polymers 43 
1.13.10 Metallic Nanoparticles
Metallic nanoparticles have seen an increase in use in a variety 
of medicinal applications in recent years, including: 
• bioimaging 
• biosensors 
• sustained drug delivery 
• hyperthermia 
• photoablation therapy [143] 
Furthermore, there are various modifications and 
functionalization of these nanoparticles consisting of specific 
functional groups that permit them to bind to antibodies, drugs, 
and other ligands, hence making these systems more promising 
in biomedical applications [144]. Although the most substantially 
studied metallic nanoparticles are gold, silver, iron, and copper, 
interest has been exploited regarding other kinds of metallic 
nanoparticles, such as zinc oxide, titanium oxide, platinum, selenium, 
gadolinium, palladium, cerium dioxide, etc. [144]. 
1.13.10.1 Mechanism
As a result of the development of nanomedicine and the 
improvement of drug discovery and drug delivery systems, a 
variety of therapeutic procedures and ancient clinical diagnostic 
methods have been investigated in order to increase drug
specificity and diagnostic precision, for instance, new routes of 
medication delivery are being investigated, with an emphasis on 
assuring their focused action in particular places, Consequently, 
overall cytotoxicity will be reduced, and overall bioavailability 
will rise within the body, and this method has resulted in the 
development of novel lead medications that are based on 
biological targets using drug design as a promising component. 
For this industry to grow and expand, experimental techniques 
for categorizing and purifying proteins, peptides, and biological 
targets must be created. furthermore, there are a few studies 
and reviews on this subject that emphasize the necessity of 
investigating alternate drug release mechanisms and the rational 
design of various molecules. Moreover, natural compounds
might provide plausible and intriguing answers to drug design 
issues and serve as a source of inspiration for drug development 44 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
with the needed chemical features. Additionally, medication 
delivery technologies have gained prominence in recent years.
Such systems are frequently constructed in a straightforward 
manner and can encourage the controlled release of active 
components in the body. As an exception, Chen et al. studied “the 
medicinal benefits of these systems and gave a vivid overview of 
how nanocarriers are used for imaging and sensory applications”. 
In addition, Pelaz et al. studied the new opportunities and problems 
facing the industry while providing an up-to-date description of 
the many applications of nanocarriers to nanomedicine, and it’s 
interesting to note that each of these drug delivery methods has 
unique chemical, physical, and morphological characteristics. 
Additionally, these methods should attract different medicinal 
polarities through chemical interactions (such as covalent and 
H-bonds) as well as physical interactions (e.g., electrostatic and 
van der Waals interactions). Mattos et al. discovered biogenic
oxide nanoparticles grafted with Azadirachta indica bark extract 
had a worse discharge profile than biogenic silica nanoparticles 
loaded with the extract. Consequently, these characteristics 
influence the interaction of nanocarriers with biological systems, 
also because of the active ingredient’s release mechanism 
within the organism. In addition, Sethi et al. constructed a cross￾linkable lipoid shell (CLS) containing docetaxel and wortmannin
as the initial pharmaceuticals used to control the drug release 
kinetics; they then analyzed its release profile, which was 
discovered to be influenced by both in vivo and in vitro conditions. 
Other factors, such as the composition of nanocarriers (e.g., 
organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials) and the type of medicines 
connected with them (e.g., core-shell system or matrix system), 
are required for understanding their drug delivery profile. 
Several investigations are undertaken regarding unlocking
mechanisms of medication in nanocarriers. Kamaly et al. offered
a comprehensive overview of controlled-release systems, with an 
emphasis on studies pertaining to dominating drug release from
chemical compound nanocarriers. However, there are numerous
nanocarriers with different drug release profiles, strategies are 
being developed to improve the specificity of the nanostructures
to target areas of the organism and to decrease their immunogenicity 
by coating or chemically functionalizing them with a variety of 
substances, such as polymers, natural polysaccharides, antibodies, Bio-Polymers 45 
cell membrane, and turnable surfactants, peptides, etc. In cases
where drugs do not show interaction and affinity with a specific 
target or do not cross the BBB or even the blood–body fluid
boundary, these ligand-modified nanocarriers are used to 
tolerate the semipermeable membrane and enable programmable 
drug delivery in a very specific environment, for instance, 
mucopolysaccharide (a carbohydrate found in the animal matrix) 
has been used as a ligand-appended in several nanocarriers, 
demonstrating promising results to enhance antitumor action 
against the skin cancer stem-like cells, carcinoma cells, pneumonic 
glandular cancer cells, and to facilitate intravitreal drug delivery 
for retinal cistron medical care and to reduce the immunogenicity 
of the shaped super-molecule corona. In addition, few studies 
are conducted to evaluate the interaction of ligands attached 
to nanocarriers with cell membranes, and their absorption
process is unknown. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that 
the uptake of nanoparticles by cells occurs via somatic cell or
non-phagocytic pathways (e.g., clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and others), whereas it has been 
difficult to standardize the mechanism of action/interaction of 
those systems within the cells due to the specific physicochemical 
characteristics of each delivery system. In a review, Islamin and 
Khosrowshahi identified the endocytosis pathways responsible 
for the cellular uptake of carbohydrate nanoparticles containing 
active chemicals in contrast, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers 
have demonstrated the ability to regulate the release profile
of a drug (as a triggered release) by exploiting external factors 
such as ultrasound, heat, magnetism, light, pH, and ionic strength, 
which can improve targeting and permit greater titration control, 
for example, super-paramagnetic iron compound nanoparticles 
are coupled to chemical compound nanocarriers or lipids in order 
to induce a controlled-release system when an external magnetic 
field is applied. moreover, Ulbrich et al. explored the impact of 
covalently or noncovalently attached drugs for cancer treatment 
and reviewed current advancements in drug delivery methods, 
focusing specifically on the concept of chemical and magnetic 
nanoparticles. Thereby further, Au/Fe3O4 polymer nanoparticles 
were synthesized for use in NIR-triggered chemo photothermal 
treatment, Therefore, hybrid nanocarriers are currently among 
the most promising technologies for nanomedicine, since they 46 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
provide a combination of features from many systems in a single 
system, thereby enhancing the performance of materials for 
therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (i.e., theranostic systems). 
Despite this, little is known about the actual mechanisms of 
action and toxicity of drug delivery systems, which presents an 
opportunity for new research. additionally, the number of studies 
specializing in the manufacture of nanocarriers using plant 
extracts and microorganisms to promote ecologically friendly 
chemical processes has expanded. 
1.14 Future of Nanomedicine
Nanomedicine science is currently one of the most alluring study 
fields, and there is extensive work in this subject over the past 
two decades has resulted in the issuance of 1500 patents and
the completion of dozens of clinical investigations [145]. Cancer
looks to be a prime example of a disease whose diagnosis and 
treatment benefit from non-medical technologies, as stated 
in several sections above. Nanomedicine and nanotechnology 
provide precise doses of medications to afflicted cells, such as 
cancer/tumor cells, without interfering with normal cellular 
physiology without a doubt, the use of drug delivery systems 
will continue to increase in the future and the research and 
development landscape of the coming decades, the nanoparticles 
presented in this release are measured in nanometers and 
submicrons (100 nm and above). More research will be undertaken 
on materials with improved drug loading, and release capabilities, 
and this review also highlights major advancements in the 
diagnostic use of metal-based nanoparticles. In the coming years, 
the diagnostic and therapeutic use of these metals, such as gold 
and silver, may contribute to the extension of nanomedicine’s 
applications. Gold nanoparticles, which appear to be well absorbed 
by soft tumor tissue, and radiation (IFR)-based heat for targeted 
ablation of tumors have sparked significant interest in this area 
increases your susceptibility to therapy even in cancer treatment/
diagnosis, the impact of nanomedicine and nanodrug delivery 
systems on healthcare systems is quite limited despite the 
widespread recognition of their future potential. As a result, 
the topic is a new scientific discipline in which just 20 years of Future of Nanomedicine 47 
genuine research have been conducted on the subject and 
many fundamentally significant qualities remain undiscovered. 
Fundamental markers of sick tissue, such as fundamental 
potential biomarkers that allow for precise targeting without
causing disruption of cellular activities, this is an important area 
for future research eventually, as our molecular understanding 
of disease expands, nanomedicine applications will develop, or 
the finding of markers corresponding to the intracellular size
of nanoparticles will open new routes.
Understanding the molecular markers of diseases will therefore 
result in future improvements in nanomedicine applications
utilizing well-known nanoprobes and nanotheranostics tools, 
additional study beyond what is mentioned in this review paper 
will be essential for larger applications of nanomedicine, and the 
concept of controlled release of specific medications to impacted 
areas, methods for assessing these events, pharmacological
effects at the tissue/cellular level, and mathematical models for 
predicting the future have yet to be refined, and multiple research 
in the field of nanomedicine has concentrated on biomaterials 
and formulation research, and biological applications are likely 
in their infancy animal experiments and inter-disciplinary
investigations that require a substantial amount of time yield 
valuable data with potential uses in drug therapy and diagnostic 
research. Smarter, multicenter approaches to nanomedicine and 
nanodrug delivery technologies have a promising future as the 
global drive toward more precise medications and diagnostics 
grows. A simplified view of the creation of nanorobots that work
in tissue diagnostic and repair mechanisms with total external 
control has sparked considerable interest. This is not yet a 
reality, but it is futuristic research that humanity may be able to 
accomplish in the near future. However, in addition to its 
benefits, nanomedicine has the potential to help both individuals 
and the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a 
thorough analysis of the potential acute or chronic harmful 
effects of novel nanomaterials on humans and the environment 
as nanomedicine grows in popularity, its affordability will make
it yet another scientific field requiring additional study as described 
in the preceding section, the regulation of nanomedicine evolves 
in tandem with improvements in nanomedicine applications. 48 Basics of Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery Systems 
1.15 Conclusion
This study examines recent breakthroughs in nanotherapeutics, 
including improvements in medication administration and 
diagnostic methods, nanorobots, and nano-sensors that can 
diagnose, deliver to targets accurately, and activate live system 
materials. Nanotechnology improved drug solubility, absorption, 
bioavailability, and controlled-release nanomedicine design entails 
significant levels of uncertainty, and identifying pharmacologically 
active compounds from natural sources, thus it’s not desired 
nanotechnology enhances bioactive substance efficiency.
Application of nanotechnology when: Curcumin, Resveratrol, 
Curcumin, Quercetin, Ellagic acid, Berberine, etc. Utilizing
nanocarriers formulated with gold, silver, cadmium sulfide, and 
titanium dioxide, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, 
crystal nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, superparamagnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles, and dendrimers have significantly increased 
the efficacy of these natural products due to their biodegradable, 
biocompatible, readily available, renewable, and low toxicity. 
Identifying polysaccharides and proteins as natural biopolymers
and making them more stable by cross-linking are cutting￾edge research disciplines. Nanocapsules and Nanospheres are 
two types of polymeric nanoparticles that can be created via 
solvent evaporation, emulsion polymerization, and surfactant￾free emulsion. Polymerization is another approach that has been 
utilized extensively in recent years, cancer has served as a disease 
model for the integration of therapy and diagnosis, often known 
as theranostic exceptional examples have been encapsulated, 
including oleic acid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles, which are 
currently benign and used for diagnostic applications via near￾infrared, photodynamic detection of colorectal cancer through
the use of alginate and folic acid-based chitosan nanoparticles, 
utilization of cathepsin B in the form of fluorogenic peptide
probes conjugated to glycol chitosan nanoparticles, and The number 
of nanotechnology-based goods and clinical trials authorized 
by the FDA has grown during the 1990s. It frequently combines

nanoparticles, protein nanoparticles, and nanocrystals with other 
drugs. Nanomedicine has already transformed the discovery and 
administration of pharmaceuticals in biological systems, even 
though it will be the subject of important future advancements, 
including regulatory frameworks for nanomedications and 
safety/toxicity assessments as a result of breakthroughs in 
nanomedicine, it is now possible to diagnose disorders and 
integrate diagnosis with treatment.

Nanotechnology is an emerging field due to its prominent effect 
on unmet medical needs like cancer treatment. Along with
advantages, lots of risks are also associated with this technology. 
Nowadays, due to comparatively high risk over benefits, this 
technology is limited to only severe diseases. Many pharma giants 
filed investigational new drug applications for nanoformulation.
However, only few get marketed because according to regulatory

www.jennystanford.com 62 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
bodies safety is the prior requirement. Benefits should overcome 
the risk for the approval of any drug whether it is normal or 
nanoformulations. In the case of nanoformulation, most of the drugs 
reach clinical trials after a successful preclinical trial. But jammed 
in clinical trials due to the insufficiency of risk-benefits data.
Some countries consider nanomaterials as hazardous chemicals 
and regulate them accordingly. However, there is an urge to 
frame common applicable preclinical toxicity studies to minimize
clinical trial failure. 
2.1 Introduction 
The emerging and highly explored science in the last two decades 
is nanoscience which is the study of materials, which have at least 
one dimension of the particle size in the nanometer range. It was 
observed that the size of the material controlled to the subatomic 
level resulted in unique properties and drastic alterations in 
its properties (physicochemical, biological, mechanical, optical, 
electronic so on and so forth). These novel or altered properties are 
further explored to the extent of nearly all the research applications 
to produce improved products. Apart from having its application 
in diverse fields (e.g., electronic industry, environment treatment 
technologies), it showed a great impact on the pharmaceutical 
field. The demand for nanotechnology has been augmented over
10 years. For example, the submission of applications like New
Drug Application (NDA), Abbreviated New Drug Application 
(ANDA), and Investigational New Drug (IND) towards drug
products containing nanomaterials has increased as depicted in 
Fig. 2.1. Along with the demands, advancements like carbon-based 
nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and 
lipid-based nanoparticles were also established [1]. This unique 
technology finds different properties of the material at this scale
of size which was not observed in bulk size. Such unique 
properties of materials are found to overcome many limitations of
conventional pharmaceuticals and older formulations of drug 
delivery systems, for instance by increasing the efficacy and
reducing the toxicity. Introduction 63 
Figure 2.1 Nanotechnology-Over a Decade of Progress and Innovation 
“A Report by the US Food and Drug Administration” issued on July 2020. 
The figure has been taken from the USFDA website 2020 [2]. 
The efficacy was enhanced mostly due to the comparatively 
smaller size than the normal formulations. Stringent regulations 
regarding nanoformulations can be considered the root cause 
of these limitations. Nowadays several studies are going on the 
nanoformulations; however, only a few medicines can reach 
the market by going through the regulatory requirements [3].
According to the United States-food and drug administration
(USFDA) this unique nanotechnology covers the size range
between 1 to 100 nm [4]. Any technology that involves these 
kinds of size particles is considered nanotechnology [5]. In 2011 
European Commission (EC) provided a definition that includes 
any manufactured or natural preparations involving 1–100 nm 
particles either in unbound or aggregated states and the threshold 
of distribution is 50% or in random cases can be considered as 
1 to 50%. Moreover, the EC took the initiative to define the term 
nanoparticles but this definition is only to determine whether a  
 
 
 
 
64 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
formulation has nanoparticles or not [6, 7]. Nanotechnology is a 
broad spectrum of technology covering various health branches 
like biologicals, medical devices, and drugs. Many researchers 
have been attracted to this technology because it overcomes many 
conventional drug barriers like absorption, distribution, dose 
reductions, and permeability. Nowadays every researcher works 
on nanotechnology but not every formulation reaches the market. 
Because for regulatory bodies safety is the priority even more
than efficacy and many safety risks are associated with 
this technology. This chapter gives a deep insight regarding 
nanotechnology along with various regulations associated with 
nanotechnology and the barrier faced by the formulator to 
market nanoformulations. 
2.2 Criteria for the Selection of Nanoparticles in 
the Formulation 
Before proceeding to the nanoformulations many criteria should
be followed by the scientist while selecting the nanoparticles to
avoid toxicity and regulatory hurdles in the marketing of 
nanoformulation. Although the selection of raw material or drug 
discovery is not a part of regulatory approval still if some criteria 
are followed by the formulator regarding safety and efficacy,
will ultimately help to get the regulatory approval in later stages. 
Various criteria for the selection of nanoparticles have been given 
below [3, 7]: 
1. Nanoformulation should be controlled and slow release 
instead of immediate release. 
2. Nanoformulation should have the capability to bind the 
selected target to show efficacy. 
3. Stable physicochemical properties lead to better penetration 
through the membrane barrier. 
4. Considerations should be taken while selecting nano￾particles like non-immunogenicity, biocompatibility, and 
biodegradability. 
5. Avoid the use of the organic and toxic substances as a
solvent while preparing a formulation.  
 
The Need for Nanomedicine Regulation 65 
6. Raw materials used in the preparations should be cheap, 
safe, and easily available. Although price does not affect the 
regulatory approval decision but decreases competition
with other marketed approved drugs for the same indication. 
7. Stability is another parameter that should be fulfilled by
the formulations while storage. 
2.3 The Need for Nanomedicine Regulation 
Previously nanoformulations were considered the same as the
other conventional drugs. But later the nanomedicines were found
to have general toxicity along with genotoxicity and mutagenicity. 
Due to its smaller size, it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier [8] 
and directly interact with cellular physiology and produce toxicity 
[9]. Most of the recorded cases are on free radical accumulation 
[1]. Till now many studies have been done on nanotechnologies.
In the area of health, this technology demonstrated the potential
in various lab-scale experiments and has been explored in almost 
all applications of pharmaceutical sciences. However, the irony
is that most of the nanoformulations failed in clinical trials; 
Sinerem is an example. Sinerem was developed by Guerbet for
the purpose of the diagnosis of pelvic cancer. This product
includes ultra-small iron oxide which is super-paramagnetic. The 
product’s unique technology and sensitivity make it able to reach
the clinical trial. However, in the phase III clinical trial, this
diagnostic device got revoked by the company itself. The reason 
behind the self-revocation was that the company was unable to 
submit the additional data asked by the Committee for Medicinal 
Product for Human Use (CHMP) while processing the application. 
When the European regulatory body asks for additional data 
regarding the risk-benefit ratio. This case emphasized the need 
for new methods for the analysis of nanomaterials so that these 
formulations do not show failure in clinical trials. 
Nanoformulations are different from conventional formulations. 
Their toxicity profile and high absorption and permeability make 
them different from the conventional drug so their regulatory 
approval criteria should also be different because not every shoe 
size is meant for every foot. Similarly, different formulations need 66 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
different regulations. After back-to-back case studies awakened 
the regulatory bodies to prepare separate guidelines regarding 
nanotechnology. As discussed in the introduction, nanotechnology
is involved in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and biological 
as well. All products have their own regulatory guidelines for
regulatory approval. The nano regulations should also vary on
the type of the product for example nanobiologicals and 
nanodevices. Moreover, these different guidelines for different 
pathways are important but still will extend the complexity for 
the stakeholder. To resolve the issue of the regulation regarding 
nanotechnology, a community like the Environment Protection 
Act (EPA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and many small 
communities joined hands and prepared regulatory science 
framework nano(bio) material-based medical products and devices 
named as REFINE project. Its objectives were decided in 2019 
and provided regulatory suggestions and guidelines for devices, 
biologicals, and pharmaceuticals that involve nanotechnology. 
This project provides new methods for testing and validation of 
the products involved in nanotechnology. These products involved
both regulatory bodies and stakeholders to develop a new 
method for testing of toxicology of the products and work on 
regulatory sciences. As discussed in the introduction only a few 
nanopreparations reach the market because of the regulatory 
barrier. The REFINE project objective is to assist the formulator
to overcome the regulatory barrier through its regulatory science 
tool [10–12]. 
2.4 REFINE Project 
In 2017, the European Technology platform initiated a REFINE 
project for the regulatory framework of nanomedicines to provide 
the required data to the regulatory body in a suitable manner with 
respect to the safety profile of the drug product as well as medical 
devices [13, 14]. Formulators found many issues to standardize 
their formulations. However, some products are combinations of 
biological nanoparticles. Then the formulators become confused 
about which pathway will be suitable for their product. In these Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 67 
kinds of cases, REFINE plays a key role in regulatory approval by 
using regulatory sciences. REFINE is the result of collaborations 
of various communities like EC and other small communities. 
It consists of various stakeholders of science, regulatory, and 
technology along with the end-user. The team of experts develops 
methods for testing and validations. Apply regulatory science to 
reduce the chances of product failure in clinical trials. This project 
is only applicable to biomaterials and nanomedicines [15, 16].
The organizations and regulations of the REFINE project have
been given in Fig. 2.2. 
Figure 2.2 REFINE project stakeholders and regulated products. 
2.5 Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 
Many regulatory challenges have been faced by the inventor to 
get approval for marketing their product in respective countries. 
Meanwhile, every country has their own regulatory bodies and 
regulations, and due to variations in regulations, it will be difficult 
to impose the same nanomedicine regulations on every country. 
Nano guidelines and their challenges in various countries have
been discussed in further sections. 68 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
2.5.1 European Union (EU) Guidelines 
According to EU legislation, the substance covered under the 
nanomaterial is considered chemical. In the EU all chemicals 
which can harm humans, as well as the environment, are 
regulated by European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and have 
to go through the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) registration and Classification, 
Labelling, and Packaging (CLP). The consideration of nanomaterials 
as chemicals somehow clears the path for nanomedicines in 
Europe [17]. The REACH was developed by the EU to protect 
humans and the environment from exposure to harmful 
chemicals. Although the nanomaterials are different from other 
hazardous chemicals because all tests for chemicals do not apply 
to nanomaterials. The issue has been acknowledged by REACH 
and in response to that, its developed requirements which are 
specially meant for the nanomaterials which include additional 
dissolution in water or other media to be performed in addition
to solubility data, and dispersion stability data in different media 
can be a replacement for n-octanol/water partition coefficient. 
According to Annexure VI of REACH guidelines, if any treatment 
and surface functionalization have been done on nanomaterial 
then the proper description and IUPAC name along with the 
CAS number is required for each agent used. REACH also 
mention specific surface area by mass and volume or both are 
required. The shape of nanomaterial is also associated with 
toxicity. So, morphological characterization, shape and aspect 
ratio are mentioned as the special requirements in the case of 
nanomaterial [18]. Likewise, nanomaterials should be classified 
according to its hazards capacity and labeled according to the CLP 
guidelines provided by ECHA. After the clarification from REACH 
and CLP, the product went through the marketing authorization 
procedure likewise other pharmaceutical products [19, 20]. The 
process of marketing authorizations showing the role of above 
mention agency and guidelines for nanomedicines has been 
given in Fig. 2.3. Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 69 
Figure 2.3 Process of marketing authorizations for nanomedicines. (REACH￾Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, CLP— 
Classification, Labelling and Packaging). 
In the approval process in the EU, there is no major difference. 
Medicinal products can be approved within 210 days of the
procedure or can be shortened by 150 days based on the public 
health interest [21]. 
2.5.2 United States Guidelines 
In 2000, USFDA created the National Nanotechnology Initiative 
(NNI) to minimize the hurdles associated with the development 
of nanoformulation. Then in 2006, Nanotechnology Task Force 
(NTF) was developed by the relevant authority [22]. According 
to the NTF report 2007, a bulk of products associated with the 
nanomaterial were applied for approval in the US [23]. This
gradual increase in the applications of pharmaceutical products 
including nanomaterials increases the concern of the regulatory 
bodies with regard to nanomaterials. This forces the agency to 
develop separate guidelines regarding nanomedicines to ensure 
that only safe and effective products reach the US population.
The basic challenge was that nanomaterials are not limited to 
drugs they are also implied in the devices and biologicals as 70 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
well. The USFDA has different departments for different health
products which has been described in (Fig. 2.4). To resolve that
issue the US-FDA established different requirements of nano 
guidelines with respect to their categories [24]. 
Figure 2.4 Different regulators for approval in USFDA. 
2.5.2.1 The process to get approval for nanomedicines in the 
US market 
As discussed in Fig. 2.4, different regulators and approval pathways 
will vary from product to product. However general approval 
processes have been given in Fig. 2.5. According to US legislation,
if the product comes under the category of nanomedicines, then
the product should go through all the toxicity studies in the
preclinical stages. Likewise, the EU and the US also considered 
nanomaterials as hazardous chemicals that can harm humans 
as well as the environment. That means any nanoformulation 
whether it is a pre-approved drug, has to go through all preclinical 
and clinical trials to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drug.
The main drawback of the formulator is that the USFDA has 
not provided any authentic definition of nanomaterial. Moreover, 
the scientist-recommended range of up to 100 is accepted by
the USFDA. Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 71 Figure 2.5 General drug approval process. 72 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
2.5.2.2 Guidance for formulators regarding the application 
of nanomedicines 
If the applicant wants to market their drug including the 
nanomaterial, they have to follow 505(b)(2) which is for the 
new drug, and in the case of generic the applicant should go for
505(J) [23]. However if the application is for the devices, then it
will depend on the class of the medical device in the case of
high-risk medical devices the applicant should follow the Pre￾marketing approval which needs clinical data. Likewise, 510(k) is 
for medium-risk medical devices. Generally, devices containing 
nanomaterial do not come under the low-risk devices which 
need only notification [25]. In the case of biologics 351(k) same 
applies [25, 26]. 
2.5.3 Indian Guidelines 
As per the Guidelines for Evaluation of Nanopharmaceuticals 
released in October 2019, a nanopharmaceutical has been 
suggested as any drug formulation or pharmaceutical preparation 
having nanomaterials, i.e., material of particle size 1–100 nm in 
one or more dimensions, also including those materials of up to
1000 nm size which has its property (chemical, physical and 
biological) attributed to its size with the intention of internal use 
or external application on humans for therapeutics, diagnostics,
and health benefits [27]. 
2.5.3.1 Evolution of regulations regarding 
nanopharmaceuticals in India 
In 2006, the Indian government empower the Department of 
Pharmaceuticals to carry out the project of framing the regulation 
for nanomedicine to the National Institute of Pharmaceutical 
Education and Research (NIPER) Mohali then after a few years in 
2012, it was handed over to NIPER Kolkata that it will be answerable 
for nanotoxicology assessment and regulations of nanodrugs 
and devices [28]. In the year 2007, As a part of the government’s 
National Nanotechnology strategy plan, the National Center for 
Nano-Structured Materials was created and it was handled by the Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 73 
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Then CSIR 
launched the project Nano-SHE, i.e., Nanomaterials: Application 
and Impact on Safety, Health, and Environment for toxicological 
evaluation of nanostructured materials [29]. In the same year
2007, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) working 
group was formed for the regulation of nanotechnology it 
launches a mission on Nanoscience and Technology (NanoMission)
[30]. DST’s Nano-mission program announced establishing a 
Framework Roadmap for National Regulatory Authorities in 
the field of nanotechnology. Nano-mission has also developed a
draft guideline and best practices for the safe handling of 
nanomaterials in 2019 [31]. 
2.5.3.2 Draft guidelines issued in 2019 
Nanomaterials are generally tiny particles that can perforate
into the cell very quickly and it is likely to have a greater impact. 
Their special characteristic properties and features make the 
drug utilization wider. As a result of this perforation, it can cause
harmful effects on human health and surrounding also. For this 
reason, various studies are currently going around the world 
to assess the toxicity because the works of literature based 
on nanomaterials are insufficient. The Centre for Knowledge 
Management of Nanoscience and Technology (CKMNT) & 
International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy 
& New Materials (ARCI) had stepped up to make the guideline
regarding good handling practices on nanomaterials in their 
respective working areas. They proposed that scientists who 
are working or going to work on nanomaterials should follow 
the guidelines like equipment for personal protection, work
practices, etc., to reduce hazardous exposure. A framework for 
nanomaterial regulation done by the European Union called
REACH will be followed and adopted efficiently wherever required.
Indian guidelines regarding nanoformulation are still in 
their budding stage. Regulatory bodies in collaboration with 
technical and science experts are working hard to establish 
proper guidelines concerning the pharmaceuticals associated 
with nanoformulations. Plenty of time is needed to build ideal 
regulations. However, the work on nano regulations is going on, 74 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
and to minimize the risk, in 2019 India provided draft guidelines 
associated with nanomedicines. These guidelines provided
basic handling methods given in (Fig. 2.6) to avoid safety risks
associated with nanoformulations. 
Figure 2.6 Methods of handling of nanomaterial according to Indian draft 
guidelines [31]. 
2.5.3.2.1 Recognizing hazards 
Identification is the prior step to avoid hazards. There are various 
categories through which the identification of hazards has been 
done. Surface charge is an important parameter to recognize the 
severity of the hazards like cationic charge is more cytotoxic and  
Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 75 
neutral charge is least cytotoxic. Accumulation of free radical 
produce toxicity, through surface chemistry it can be identified. 
Different shapes of nanomaterials are associated with different 
kinds of toxicity; for example, fibrous nanomaterials produce
lung toxicity. Solubility plays a key role to identify hazards; for 
example, low-solubility nanomaterials have a higher ability 
to develop cancer and oxidative stress compared with high￾solubility ones. If the flash point of nanomaterial is below 200°F, 
then it will be characterized aa s fire hazard. The value of flash 
point will vary with types of materials; for example, in the case of
flammable liquid, the value should not exceed 100°F. Meanwhile,
in the case of combustible liquids, the value is ≥100°F. Toxic 
Hazard helps in deciding the safety preventive measures with 
Threshold Limit Values (TLV) or Permissible Exposure Limits 
(PEL) should have a value less than 50 parts per million and will 
be handled with care mostly in the fume hood. Explosion Hazard 
can be identified by calculating with minimum ignition energy
and minimum exposable dust concentration. 
2.5.3.2.2 Route of exposure 
Nanomaterials can penetrate the body through various routes like 
inhalation, dermal absorption, and ingestion. It is important to 
understand all the possible routes through which nanomaterials 
can enter the human body to avoid further risks. Safety precautions 
should be carried out according to the exposure route. For 
example, N95 mask should be used while dealing with powder
form of nanomaterial because in powder form there are high
chances of inhalation as compared to suspension. Likewise in
the case of the dermal route, safety measures like, gloves, lab coats 
are used while handling nanoformulations to minimize the 
exposure. 
2.5.3.2.3 Strategies to control exposure 
(A) Control of Engineered Particles 
Appropriate measures should be taken before unveiling
nanoparticles. These techniques are: 
1. Revealing the source of generation  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
76 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
2. Filters are used to catch airborne particles. For example￾High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter 
3. Nanomaterials from the reactors are collected by appropriate 
containers such as airlocks and sealed containers 
(B) Control of Administration 
It consists of various other additional procedure techniques such 
as training, housekeeping, work practice, health check-ups, keeping 
records of work done, supervision of workstations, and storage. 
Various considerations should be taken care of while imparting 
training to personnel: 
(1) Proper understanding of nanoparticles 
(2) Standard operating procedure knowledge 
(3) Maintaining equipment associated with nanomaterials 
(4) Handling of waste materials and their labeling 
(5) Regular checking of the health status of employees 
(6) Understanding the impact on the atmosphere 
2.5.3.2.3.1 Supervisions of workstations 
Regular supervision is important in the case of nanomaterials. 
Through supervision concentration of nanomaterials at the 
workplace can be detected by using various methods like, 
condensation particle counters. 
2.5.3.2.3.2 Storage 
Storage of nanoparticles should be taken under special precautions 
to protect the product as well as the personnel. 
2.5.3.2.3.3 Waste disposal 
In sealed containers, we are able to pour milligrams of nanoparticles 
that should be correctly labeled and should be disposed of in front
of responsible authorities. If it is more than a milligram then
disposal will be based on the solubility of the chemicals. If the 
solubility is less, it is considered as chemical waste, it can be metals 
or metal oxides, etc., on the other hand, if the solubility is more, 
based on the toxicity class its disposal is carried out.  
 
 
 
 
 
Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 77 
2.5.3.2.4 Nanomaterials handling and production 
(1) Transportation and storage are done in containers which is 
shatter resistant, along with defined labeling 
(2) Dry powders quantification and weighting have to be done
in closed areas 
(3) Multiple processing steps are used to produce nanoparticles 
at a greater concentration. In this step, staff can be exposed 
to nanomaterials so the generation of nanomaterials will be 
done under sufficient operating controls 
(4) Caution must be taken to avoid any interruption of the 
enclosed chambers, and cleaning should be carried out on a 
wet stage or in the liquid medium so that spreading can be 
avoided 
(5) Working stations should be monitored on a regular basis to 
avoid the exposure of nanomaterials to staff 
(6) Waste disposal should be done by the production department 
with reduced risk to humans and the atmosphere 
2.5.3.2.5 Safety practices 
In this transportation, buddy system, outburst safety, controlling 
access, and dry materials are discussed. When a staff is working 
lonely in his labs, he should make friends in his nearby labs so
that they will notice us in and out the time of the labs, especially 
when you are doing highly hazardous operations this is called
a buddy system. 
2.5.3.2.5.1 Outburst safety 
Nanomaterials are oxidizable in powder form so that when it 
becomes in contact with water, they will show pyrophoric activities 
so outburst can happen. When these outburst materials activities 
are done in labs anti-static shoes and mates are highly preferred. 
Tests for pyrophoricity should be done on small quantities of 
nanomaterial. 
2.5.3.2.5.2 Dry materials 
A walk-off mat should be placed in the exit area. While cleaning 
the materials which are collected should be disposed of properly. 
Nanomaterials in HEPA vacuum are labeled separately as “For Use 
with Nanomaterials Only.”  
 
 
78 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
2.5.3.2.6 Product supervision 
This product will be delivered to the customers with supporting 
information such as a material safety data sheet, a sheet of 
information about the product, operating manuals, and a sheet of 
specifications [31]. 
2.5.3.3 Required information for the evaluation of 
nanomaterials 
Nanopharmaceuticals are classified based on functions and 
their nature and the current status of marketing approval of
nanomaterial and active pharmaceutical ingredient forms of the 
drug. 
Nanomaterial is classified based on their: 
1. Degradation characteristics 
2. Nature of Nanomaterials 
3. Ingredient in Nanoform 
2.5.3.3.1 Based on their degradation characteristics, it is further 
classified into biodegradable and non-biodegradable 
2.5.3.3.1.1 Biodegradable 
These materials are breakdown or decompose naturally, so it is
often used in drug delivery as vehicles. For example, proteins,
lipids, etc. 
2.5.3.3.1.2 Non-biodegradable 
These materials do not decompose naturally, so they are 
infrequently used in pharmaceuticals. But often used in cosmetics. 
For example, gold, platinum, silver, etc. Non-biodegradables 
are stored in the body over a period of time which is the
biggest disadvantage while using them. 
2.5.3.3.2 Based on the nanomaterial’s nature, they are further 
classified into organic and inorganic materials 
2.5.3.3.2.1 Organic nanomaterials 
A drug which has carbon molecules in its structure will fall under 
this category which is primarily focused on reduction in toxicity Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 79 
and improved bioavailability at the site. For example, polymers, 
liposomes, and proteins. 
2.5.3.3.2.2 Inorganic nanomaterials 
It generally contains an inorganic portion. Based on the combination, 
size and others there are various adjustable properties. It 
generally has higher stability than organic nanomaterials. It has 
several benefits over organic nanomaterials and it is very easy 
to prepare. 
2.5.3.3.2.3 Multi-component nanomaterials 
Made up of more than two diverse materials so, this makes 
the drug for fulfilling several functions along with its physico￾chemical properties. For example, magnetic liposomes. Although
the stability of the nanomaterials remains challenging. 
2.5.3.3.3 Based on the ingredient used in the nanoform 
2.5.3.3.3.1 Nanocarriers loaded with API 
These are transporters used along with the drug. Due to their
small size, they can easily release the drug at a particular site 
or a convenient site within the body. Examples are liposomal 
amphotericin B, etc. 
2.5.3.3.4 Based on drug approval status along with nanomaterial 
in other countries 
The need for data may vary according to the drug approval 
status along with its nanomaterials. The Central Drug Standard 
Control Organization (CDSCO) evaluates all nanopharmaceutical 
formulations as new drugs based on four categories: 
1st Category: Here the drug and nanocarrier are new to the 
market and not yet approved in any other country. Therefore, 
it will be considered as an IND application. The requirements for
the application data have been given in the second schedule of
New Drug Clinical Trials (NDCT) Rules, 2019. 
2nd Category: The New Molecular Entity (NME) is not yet approved 
but the carrier is utilized already in nanopharmaceuticals. This
will also be treated as an IND application. The requirement for 80 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
data is given in the second schedule of NDCT Rules, 2019. Relaxation 
for this category is safety studies on nanocarrier molecules. 
3rd Category: The NME is approved in other countries but 
the carrier molecule is not approved or regulated in any other
countries. In this formulation, the data for the IND application
is given in the second schedule of NDCT Rules. But sufficient
data on the safety of the final formulation should be reported to
the regulatory body at the time of submission. 
4th Category: In this category, both the drug and carrier molecule 
are approved as the particular formulation is still to be approved 
in India. This type of application is considered as abbreviated
or bridging studies as per the second schedule of NDCT Rules, 
2019. 
2.5.3.3.5 Evaluation of nanopharmaceuticals with respect to the 
second schedule of the NDCT Rules, 2019 
The guidelines and general requirements for the manufacture 
or import of a new drug or to undertake a clinical trial with 
consideration to nanopharmaceuticals have been outlined in 
the second schedule of New Drug and Clinical Trails along with 
their chemical and pharmaceutical information, non-clinical and 
clinical data concerning a nanotechnology-based pharmaceutical
product. Although the complexity of these products varies 
case-by-case, products should be taken on for evaluating their 
quality, safety, and efficacy. The impact of waste disposal of 
these nanomaterials and their effect on the environment should 
also be discussed. India accepts USFDA guidelines for liposomal 
formulations. 
2.5.3.3.6 Testing for the stability of nanopharmaceutical 
formulations 
Based on the methods given in the 5th clause of the second 
schedule (i.e., stability testing of new drugs) of NDCT Rules, 2019 
and International Conference on Harmonization Q1 Guidelines. 
In specified storage conditions, the drug should be tested from
time to time to confirm its stability when the drug is loaded
with a carrier molecule. So, attention should be given to the 
effectiveness, size, and stability of formulation and carrier along Regulatory Challenges of Nanomedicines 81 
with its degradation products. Stability studies have been conducted 
on marketing packs along with the parameters that are particular 
to nanomaterial-based formulations e.g. size & size distribution 
and drug loading by suitable methods. These parameters should 
be measured at suitable time intervals. For example, if we use PEG
for surface coating the thickness of PEG will be quantified by 
appropriate analytical methods. The characterization should 
be done for the nanomaterial system as well. 
2.5.3.3.7 Data on animal pharmacology 
Data should be based on the toxicity of active pharmaceutical 
ingredients as well as the drug’s intended use and also the delivery 
system which influences the drug release. For this purpose, the 
guidelines are established in animal pharmacology (i.e., 3rd clause) 
of the second schedule of NDCT Rules, 2019. However, evaluating
the nanopharmaceutical drug effectiveness, the response of the 
product should be noted in preclinical testing. Evaluation of
the properties should result in the increase of therapeutic
effectiveness, drug accumulation at the site of release. For example,
in cancer studies, data should be collected with respect to 
accumulation in the tumor cells or biodistribution, circulation, 
and bioavailability. In the case of nanopharmaceuticals with
brain targeting action, some special studies have to be performed 
with appropriate drug concentration in a different location in
the brain when compared to other studies. 
2.5.3.3.8 Data on animal toxicology 
Data generated in the area of toxicological studies for 
nanopharmaceuticals should follow the guidelines based on the 
administered route which is given in animal toxicology studies 
(i.e., clause 2) of the second schedule of NDCT Rules, 2019. The 
most preferred animal models are rodent and non-rodent species. 
Commonly rats and dogs are preferred in both sexes. 
2.5.3.3.9 Information required for evaluation of 
nanopharmaceuticals 
Data which are generally submitted to the regulatory authority along 
with the clinical trials and manufacture of nanopharmaceuticals 82 Regulatory Barriers to the Marketing Authorization of Nanodrug Delivery System 
for marketing in India will be the same as those requirements 
mentioned in NDCT Rules, 2019 [27]. 
2.6 Roles of Intellectual Property (Patent) in 
Regulatory Approval 
A patent is an exclusive right provided to the inventor that nobody 
can use his invention without permission. On the other hand, 
regulatory approval is the method by which an inventor can 
launch their drug into the market. The regulatory approval is not 
limited to the patented product. The non-patented drugs can also 
get regulatory approval through the pathways like repurposing 
and generic drugs. In the case of nanodrug delivery systems, 
bulk formulations got patents. However, out of them, only a few 
reaches the market (a few are listed in Table 2.1) which means 
patents do not assure that the innovation got marketing approval 
or not. The differences between a patent and regulatory approval 
have been given in Table 2.2. 
2.7 Comparison of Various Countries’ 
Regulations with Regard to 
Nanotechnology 
Regulations regarding nano varied from country to country. The 
US has separate guidelines for devices, drugs and biologicals 
which includes nanomaterial. Meanwhile, the EU considers all 
nanomaterials in the range of 1 to 100 nm as harmful chemicals 
and regulated by a separate body named ECHA. In ECHA, the 
nanomaterial should go through REACH and CLP approval. In 
India, the guidelines regarding nanomaterials are still in the 
development stage. Till now only draft guidelines regarding the 
careful handling of nanomaterials have been given. However, 
REACH is accepted in India for nanomaterials. The comparison

2.8 Conclusion 
Nanotechnology is the future of the pharmaceutical industry. 
Regulatory bodies put their maximum efforts to establish proper 
guidelines for the nanomedicines. USFDA still does not have 
any definition for nanomaterials. However, scientist-generated
definitions are acceptable by the regulatory body. Meanwhile, 
USFDA provides product-specific guidelines for nanomaterials 
along with stringent requirements regarding safety. Europe 
required CLP and REACH certifications along with the marketing 
authorization application. Till now India has only draft guidelines 
associated with the careful handling of nanomaterial. REACH 
guidelines related to nanomaterial is also acceptable in India.
Still, there is a massive difference between the applications 
and approval regarding nanomaterials. The REFINE project is a 
great initiative to resolve those regulatory barriers by providing
product-specific methods to ensure that the product does not
fail in clinical trials. However, this project is limited to only a few 
countries. There is a need for collaboration between industry
and regulatory bodies to establish suitable methods to resolve 
regulatory issues associated with nanomedicine approval.

Conventional drugs face limitations crossing into the brain allowing 
for only ideal drug candidates. These candidates should possess 
properties such as high lipophilicity, moderate molecular weight, 
charge, etc. This leaves out many other drugs and prevents entry 
into the brain. The brain protects itself via several barriers that 
limit drug entry and reduce effectiveness. These barriers include 
the blood-brain barrier, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier,
and the arachnoid barrier. These barriers reduce the efficacy of
drugs in the therapy of brain-related diseases. This has necessitated 
the development of novel strategies such as nanodrug delivery 
systems, to target drugs to the brain for effective therapies.
Nanodrug delivery systems such as liposomes, carbon dots, viral 
vectors, polymeric micelles, etc., are increasingly being tested 
in preclinical models and clinical trials in the management of

brain-related diseases. So far, some successes have been recorded 
for diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, 
Huntington’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, etc., While nanodrug 
systems show promise in future applications, some limitations 
affect the use in clinical settings. This chapter highlights the
current advances in nanodrug delivery systems and their benefits
in brain targeting to enhance clinical outcomes. 
3.1 Introduction 
Targeted drug delivery systems have received increasing attention
in the past several decades to achieve better therapeutic 
outcomes and reduced side effects [1]. There are numerous 
examples of targeted drug delivery systems undergoing clinical 
trials; however, clinical translation of targeted drug delivery
systems is relatively slow [2]. Major efforts have been made to 
identify high-affinity ligands and identify nanodrug delivery
system strategies, particularly for enhanced brain targeting [3–5].
Nanodrug delivery systems (NDDS) are drug delivery systems 
for the delivery of medications in nano sizes (1 billionth of a meter) 
to specific organs. These systems are encapsulated in vesicles or 
polymer matrices with one or more medicinal compounds [1, 2]. 
They provide a means of administering medications to improve 
drug delivery and efficacy at the targeted organ [6]. They are also 
used to improve drug stability and water solubility, prolong cycle 
time, boost target cell or tissue absorption rate, and limit enzyme 
degradation, hence improving drug safety and effectiveness 
[7–9]. They have unique properties which make them suitable for
targeting drugs to specific organs such as the brain where drug 
uptake could present some challenges. 
3.2 Physiological Barriers of the Brain to Drugs 
The brain is one of the most important organs in the human 
body and no harm must come to it [10]. The blood-brain barrier
(BBB)—a highly selective, partially permeable barrier between
the brain and the rest of the body is one of the most important 
defense systems of the brain [11]. The blood-brain barrier has Physiological Barriers of the Brain to Drugs 103 
a very strict regulation of solutes, ions and molecules that it permits 
into the central nervous system (CNS) and brain. This is a result 
of the tight junctions formed by densely packed endothelial cells 
and a complex efflux transporter system which actively removes 
molecules from the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid transporting 
them back into the systemic circulation [11–13]. the BBB’s highly 
selective nature has posed a big challenge for scientists to treat 
CNS or brain disorders or diseases, as many of the drugs that need
to reach the brain to be effective are unable to do so [14]. 
For decades, drug delivery to the brain in the treatment of CNS 
disorders has been faced with the problem of poor drug targeting. 
Irrespective of the development of active drugs in the therapy 
of diseases, efficacy may still be limited due to low drug delivery 
across the BBB. Endothelial cells are an integral part of the 
BBB structure and they are encompassed by pericytes with 
tight junctions in between. They utilize a high amount of ATP to 
maintain the structure of the barrier. Endothelial cells regulate
the permeability of substances from the circulatory vasculature 
into the neuronal system [15]. The blood is separated from the 
brain parenchyma by endothelial cells that line the capillaries in 
the brain. The brain capillaries’ endothelium monolayer serves 
as a vital interface for the exchange of nutrients, gases, and 
metabolites between blood and brain, as well as a barrier 
for neurotoxic plasma components and xenobiotics [16, 17].
Astrocytes enable strong attachment of endothelial cells and 
maintain strong tight junctions. It is the most common cellular 
component type in the brain and is involved in several functions 
such as gliotransmitter release, dopamine metabolism, glutamate 
uptake, etc. [17]. Pericytes are found between endothelial cells
and astrocytes and very essential in maintaining homeostasis. It 
also enables angiogenesis and the increase of endothelial cells 
[17]. Besides all cellular components, the non-cellular component
(the basement membrane), is a composite of four proteins, all 
of which help in the support and anchoring of cells. Collagen IV 
is essential for the maintenance of the Basement membrane, but 
not for its formation. The role of laminin is not well known, but 
nidogen, the third protein, stabilizes the network between the 
two former proteins. Perlecan is large in size but invaluable in 
embryogenesis [18]. All components of the basement membrane 104 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
work to protect the brain from the entry of exogenous compounds 
and regulate the movement of blood solutes across the barrier.
The BBB is not the only physiological barrier that limits 
brain drug delivery, another barrier is the blood-cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) barrier [19]. The choroid plexus regulates the flow 
of drugs via the blood to the CSF. Drug transfer via the choroid 
plexus and the BBB occurs via unrelated pharmacokinetics. The
choroid plexus is not as tight as the BBB in limiting the entry 
of substances owing to the difference in the cells forming the 
barrier. At an inverse proportion to the drug’s rate, the molecules 
penetrate the CSF [20]. While the drug enters the CSF much
more easily than the BBB, it exits rather quickly. A drug injected 
into the CSF compartment travels quickly from the brain to the 
bloodstream like “a slow intravenous infusion”. Almost all drugs 
enter into the CSF irrespective of the ability to cross BBB. There 
is minimal entry into the brain parenchyma and drugs rapidly 
exit into the blood. 
The arachnoid barrier, which also limits the entry of drugs
from the circulatory system into the brain, may be considered a 
part of the blood-CSF barrier. The arachnoid barrier cells form
one of the three layers of the meninges covering the CNS. The 
meninges are made up of an outermost dura layer (adjacent to the 
skull) and two innermost layers (leptomeninges), which include 
the arachnoid mater [21]. The subarachnoid space accounts for
more than 80% of the cerebrospinal fluid space thereby playing
a major role in the level of drugs transported into the CSF [22].
The spinal cord and blood-spinal cord barrier are rate-limiting 
factors in the entry of drugs into the other part of the CNS. 
This barrier regulates the entry of endogenous and exogenous 
substances into the spinal environment [23].
These physiological barriers limit the entry of drugs for 
brain targeting and necessitate the use of novel methods such as 
nanodrug delivery systems in the treatment of central nervous 
disorders. 
3.3 Strategies for Effective Brain Targeting 
Currently, several strategies are effective for brain drug delivery. 
While some are invasive, others are not invasive. The reasons for Strategies for Effective Brain Targeting 105 
this special delivery system for the brain stem from the unique 
nature of the organ and the number of barrier systems in place to 
protect this delicate organ. The strategies that have been used are 
discussed in the following section. 
3.3.1 Exosomes 
Studies have shown exosomes to be of advantage as a useful 
delivery system for drugs to the brain [24, 25]. Exosomes are
vesicles secreted from cells; in this case, endothelial cells are 
used to produce exosomes which are then used in brain targeting. 
Exosomes work as vesicles for the drug which can easily cross
the BBB [24]. When compared to nanoparticulate drug delivery 
systems like liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, using 
exosomes as drug delivery vehicles have several advantages [26]. 
Exosomes are intracellular vesicles for the natural transport of 
substances outside the cell, thus, can be adapted for drug delivery. 
Despite the potential advantages of exosomes, some issues limit 
its clinical applications; choice of donor cell for exosome (because 
exosomes can vary in composition depending on the source), 
further toxicity studies, etc. [24]. 
3.3.2 Blood Permeability Enhancers 
Some compounds can enable the transport of drugs to the brain 
by temporarily opening the BBB. These molecules, known as 
permeability enhancers, are effective in overcoming the BBB 
and provide efficient drug targeting. In a study by Liang et al., 
a new glioma-targeting approach based on enhancer-modified 
albumin nanoparticles was created to safely and efficiently deliver 
medications to glioma areas in the brain [27]. Breitkreuz et al. [28] 
also utilized a new compound, MO1, to effect a transient increase 
in BBB permeability resulting in improved delivery of paclitaxel
to the mouse brain leading to reduced orthotopic glioblastoma 
growth [28].
In recent years, ultrasound has become well known for 
enhancing the entry of medications across the BBB [24].
Ultrasound can improve medication administration to the brain 
by improving distribution via a BBB that is already impaired, such 106 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
as in tumors and by disrupting the BBB in normal brain tissue [29]. 
When used together with microbubbles in the brain, ultrasound 
can increase BBB permeability and enable drugs to easily cross 
the barrier. Microbubbles are micro-sized vesicles with rigidity 
maintained by lipids and polymers. The outer layer (shell) can be 
attached to different moieties, whether in diagnostic (imaging 
agents) or therapeutic agents (drugs) [30]. The mechanical index 
magnitude can affect the properties of the microbubble. It can cause 
to oscillate (sonoporation) or implode (sono-permeabilization). 
The oscillating activity (cavitation) can help open up membranes 
and blood vasculature [30]. Both components (ultrasound and 
microbubbles) affect the extent of permeability. This technique
has been applied in the therapy of different diseases [30]. 
3.3.3 Chemical Modification 
Chemical modifications such as prodrug formation involve the 
modification of the drug structure for it to cross the BBB, then
it is metabolized to the original drug in the CNS. The use of
prodrugs has been applied in the delivery of dopamine to the 
brain. Due to its polar nature, hydrophilic dopamine cannot cross
the BBB, hence, it is administered as L-dopa which enters the CNS 
and is converted to dopamine [31]. The use of prodrugs is also 
seen in the delivery of azidothymidine to the brain via the simple 
formation of the ester prodrug [32, 33]. Another study utilized a 
prodrug ester in the transfer of ketoprofen across the BBB [34].
The formation of dimers as a prodrug has also been applied in 
the CNS delivery of anti-HIV drugs like abacavir [32]. The necessity 
for a drug to be hydrophobic enough to cross the BBB underlies 
the basis for the formation of prodrug forms which are often 
non-polar enough to cross the barrier [24]. Yue et al. (2018) 
experimented with the use of a dual-targeting prodrug in the 
delivery of Ibuprofen to the CNS [35]. Several prodrugs are 
currently utilizing the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT-1) 
which is found in the BBB. LAT1 belongs to a larger family of
L-transporters that help to transfer some amino acids across 
membranes into cells in the body [36]. The ability of LAT1 to detect 
specific amino acids and physiological hormones as important Strategies for Effective Brain Targeting 107 
endogenous substrates and several medications as exogenous
substrates determine its impact on human metabolism [36]. 
3.3.4 Transport Systems 
The use of transport systems also represents another mode of drug 
delivery to the brain. These transport systems are endogenous 
structures that physiologically transport endogenous molecules 
across cell membranes. It is thus exploited in the delivery of drugs 
as well by modifying the structures of the drugs to resemble 
endogenous molecules recognized by the transporters. Examples
of transporters used to mediate drug transfer across the BBB
include the above-mentioned LAT1, glucose transporter type 1
(GLUT 1), monocarboxylic acid transporter type 1 (MCT1),
equilibrative nucleoside transporter type 1 (ENT 1), and cationic 
amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) [37]. It is also possible for two
or more modes of drug delivery to be combined as seen in the 
delivery of L-dopa in the treatment of parkinsonism which
combines a prodrug to resemble an L-amino acid which is then
taken up by LAT1 (prodrug + transport system) [31]. 
3.3.5 Direct Administration 
Another method of bypassing the BBB is the direct administration 
of the drug into the brain. This may either be intracerebral or 
intracerebroventricular. The intracerebral route involves the 
administration of the drug through microinjection guide sleeves 
that are implanted stereotaxically to enable the targeted entry 
of the drug to a specific part of the brain [38]. The latter requires 
the administration of the drug via the ventricles of the brain [38]. 
Unlike the other systems, these methods are invasive and require 
special care. Intracerebroventricular administration has long been 
utilized for several CNS diseases such as refractory pain, infection 
in the brain and brain tumors [39]. The same route can be applied 
whether, in the treatment of meningitis, where antimicrobials 
are administered intracerebroventricularly, or in chemotherapy, 
treatment of CNS lymphoma. Some existing strategies in brain drug 
delivery are presented in Table 3.1. 108 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting

3.4 Characteristics of an Ideal Drug Candidate 
for Effective Brain Targeting 
Effective brain targeting requires that drugs should possess
essential characteristics. Typically, this would depend on the 
intended mode of transport across the BBB (exosomal delivery, 
transporter-mediated, viral-vectored, etc.). These characteristics 
would enhance adequate exposure and optimal drug delivery. 
Due to the nature of the BBB, an essential characteristic is its 
high lipophilicity, which determines the membrane transport 
and action binding ability [46]. Moreover, it is a parameter that
determines the ability of drugs to bind to active sites and is 
very important for pharmacokinetics - absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, excretion; pharmacodynamics and toxicity properties 
[46]. It is measured in terms of the partition coefficient (Log P), Characteristics of an Ideal Drug Candidate for Effective Brain Targeting 109 
which is a measure of the distribution of the drug in the organic 
phase (unionized) ratio to the amount in the aqueous phase
(ionized). Drugs with high lipophilicity can enter the CNS via 
solubilization into the lipid layer of the endothelial cells or 
diffusion. For an ideal drug candidate, the Log P value ranges 
between 1.5 and 2.7 [47].
Only when a drug’s molecular weight is less than or 
substantially equal to 400–600 Da can its lipophilicity be used as 
a measure of BBB transit [48]. The molecular weight of an ideal 
drug for brain targeting entering the brain compartment via 
passive diffusion requires a molecular weight <400 Da or between 
400–600 Da. The rate of diffusion across membranes relies on 
the molecule’s ability. The larger the molecular weight, the more
the number of hydrogen bond donor molecules and acceptor 
moieties and the lesser the lipophilicity and thus, the ability to 
diffuse across the blood-brain barrier [49]. Ideal drug candidates 
for brain drug delivery require high lipophilicity, small molecular 
weight and a low number of hydrogen bonds (<8) [50].
The charge is another essential requirement for crossing the 
BBB. The cell membrane of the BBB is negatively charged and the 
use of an equally negatively charged compound may create a form 
of repulsion and limit diffusion. Polymers, cationic lipids, albumin, 
and nanoparticles are examples of positively charged materials 
that can interact with the negatively charged cell membrane and 
internalize via adsorptive endocytosis [51]. Carrier-mediated drug 
delivery requires essential properties such as the high affinity 
of the drug for the cell transporter [52]. Transporters recognize 
endogenous molecules, hence the need to enable drugs to acquire 
similar properties to enhance affinity. In some cases, the formation 
of a prodrug is necessitated. An ideal drug candidate should be 
able to revert to its active state on entering the brain compartment 
and retain activity. For nanomedicines, properly understanding 
the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and distribution properties of 
drugs and conjugates is essential in enhancing the clinical 
application of medicines for brain drug targeting [53]. The key 
characteristics of ideal drug candidates for brain targeting are 
shown in Fig. 3.1. 110 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
Figure 3.1 Key characteristics of ideal drug candidates for brain targeting [53]. 
3.5 Nanodrug Delivery System Strategies for 
Enhanced Brain Targeting 
Different strategies have been employed for the formulation of 
nanodrug delivery systems to enhance drug delivery to the brain. 
These strategies include the following: 
3.5.1 Micelles 
Micelles are uni-layered amphiphilic nanocarriers that allow 
the controlled release of encapsulated drugs [10, 54, 55] They 
are characterized by their unique spherical shape, with the 
hydrophobic part(s) set apart from the hydrophilic part(s), 
which leads to the formation of an inner hydrophobic core 
surrounded by external hydrophilic terminals [11]. Their stability 
in physiological environments is a result of their amphiphilic 
nature, which results in long circulation times, providing them 
with sufficient time to reach the target tissue [56]. Nanodrug Delivery System Strategies for Enhanced Brain Targeting 111 
Despite the long systemic circulation, they have poor cellular 
binding and uptake [57]. Due to their amphiphilic nature, both 
lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs can be loaded into micellar 
DDSs. However, micellar drug delivery systems possess low drug 
loading capacities compared to other systems. In a study by 
Yin et al., doxorubicin-loaded poly(lactic-glycolic) acidlysoGM1
micelles was developed with an encapsulation efficiency of about 
61%. These micelles easily crossed the BBB and accumulate
inside the brain parenchyma of mice and zebrafish used in the 
in vivo studies through micropinocytosis and lysosomal pathways 
[10, 55].
Amphiphilic block copolymers generate nano-sized 
encapsulating structures known as polymeric micelles. The 
formation of micelles is based on the ability of these block 
copolymers to aggregate/coalesce into a larger spherical vesicle 
when present in an aqueous solvent [58]. Micelles can vary based 
on the forming polymers. While some of these polymers are largely 
hydrophobic, others are more hydrophilic. Polyethylene oxide, 
for example, contains hydrophilic blocks while poly propylene 
oxide contains hydrophobic blocks. A combination of these two 
creates a highly useful polymeric micelle in the solubilization of 
drugs [59]. Polymeric micelles are particularly well suited for 
drug administration because of their inherent and adjustable 
characteristics [60]. They are commonly characterized by a 
hydrophilic, water-loving coating known as the ‘corona’ with an 
inner lipophilic or hydrophobic ‘core’ [61] due to the amphiphilic 
nature of forming copolymers. Polymeric micelles provide useful 
advantages due to their unique properties of solubility, low toxicity, 
compatibility with biological systems, structure, arrangement, etc., 
hence their diverse use in various treatment applications [62]. 
They are also uniquely target-specific. The interesting nature of
the micelle enables it to protect the coated drug from degradation, 
and enhance its solubility, particularly for poorly soluble 
drugs [62]. In the treatment of brain diseases, micelles are useful
in the delivery of anti-cancer drugs. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 
micelles) help deliver drugs such as doxorubicin and camptothecin, 
which were found to be effective in the treatment of glioblastoma.
Its applications are not limited only to brain drug targeting, 
but to other organs as well due to its target specificity and 112 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
bioavailability. An advanced application of micelles in drug delivery 
is the ultrasound micelle drug delivery, which is a form of 
augmentation that utilizes ultrasound waves in stimulating
the release of drugs from the micelles [58]. Interestingly, this 
modification involves the use of ultrasound which is comprised 
of waves that are transmitted through the skin without any need 
for invasive procedures or surgery, and rupture or stimulate the 
release of drug-containing micelles in specific locations of the
body, minimizing avoidable side effects [58]. 
3.5.2 Liposomes 
Liposomal drug delivery is a major means of overcoming
restrictions of BBB transport. It has been shown that liposome 
surface modifications can improve the circulation time in blood, 
the therapeutic index, and the bioavailability, as well as change 
the drug distribution to the brain [63]. Liposomes are composed
of phospholipids and cholesterol formed into small spherical￾shaped vesicles consisting of one or more phospholipid bilayers 
that can hold various therapeutic molecules including drugs, 
vaccines, nucleic acids, and proteins [10]. In general, the components 
of the liposomes make them biologically inert, non-immunogenic, 
and biodegradable, with low inherent toxicity [64]. Liposomes
can be used as carriers for biologically active compounds and 
have been widely used as a drug delivery system (DDS) to 
improve drug efficacy and eliminate drug-related toxicity or 
unwanted effects [65–67]. Even though liposomes have lipophilic 
characteristics, they are very large and cannot simply diffuse across 
cell membranes or between BBB cells [68]. Instead, liposomes 
cross the BBB via transport systems, such as adsorptive-mediated 
transcytosis (AMT), receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), and 
carrier-mediated transcytosis (CMTs) [69, 70] To efficiently
cross the BBB, instead of using conventional liposomes, further 
surface modification is possible. This includes cationic liposomes, 
specifically targeted liposomes and long-circulating liposomes; to 
which immunoliposomes belong (see Table 3.2). Liposome-based 
strategies can be classified as physiological since the liposome
adds physiological interactions to that of the drug on its own, 
whereby it influences drug distribution characteristics [63]. Nanodrug Delivery System Strategies for Enhanced Brain Targeting 113

Long-circulating Achieved by conjugating liposome or PEGylated liposome 
liposome to single functional ligand or multiple ligands to facilitate 
a specific binding to the BBB surface receptors or carrier 
proteins 
Targeted delivery leverages the delivery efficiency of
liposomes to the brain, and improves the therapeutic 
index by increasing target site drug accumulation while 
decreasing peripheral toxicity. This opens a possibility 
for reducing dose or dosing frequency 
Targeted ligands can be antibodies, cell-penetrating 
peptides, or endogenous molecules, e.g., transferrin, GSH, 
ApoE, and lactoferrin 
3.5.2.1 Immunoliposomes 
Immunoliposomes; antibody-directed liposomes have been 
recognized as a promising tool for the site-specific delivery of drugs 
and diagnostic agents [71]. However, the in vivo use of classical 114 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
immunoliposomes is hampered by the very rapid clearance of 
immunoliposomes from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial 
system [72]. This obstacle can be avoided if gangliosides or 
PEG-derivatized lipids are inserted within the bilayer of the 
conventional liposomes, as these modifications will prolong
considerably the liposome half-life in circulation [71, 73, 74]. In 
a study by Huwyler et al., [71] immunoliposomes were used to
target an encapsulated drug, daunomycin, to the rat brain in vivo. 
This was achieved using vector-mediated drug delivery systems, 
which have been previously used for peptides or peptide nucleic 
acids [75] to apply small molecule drug delivery to the brain.
Thus, micromolar drug concentrations in the brain were achieved 
using BBB drug delivery vectors with increased carrying
capacity by logarithmic orders. As micromolar concentrations 
of many small drug molecules in the brain are required for 
pharmacological activity. This was possible with the use of PEG￾conjugated immunoliposomes and monoclonal antibodies that 
target the brain and BBB receptors [71]. 
3.5.3 Dendrimers 
Dendrimers are highly branched spherical polymers that are now 
used as drug delivery systems due to the ease with which they can 
be produced and modified compared to other nanotechnology￾based drug delivery systems and their size. Dendrimers are 
sometimes referred to as “starburst” polymers as a result of their 
branching. They are made up of three main, distinct components; an 
initiator core, to which interior layers (i.e., generations) of repeating 
subunits (dendrons) are radially linked, and the terminals, where 
the functionalization (such as the linking of bioconjugates such
as proteins or antibodies onto the dendrimer surface), as well as 
drug loading, takes place [76–79].
One of the most studied classes of dendrimers used in the 
delivery of therapeutics to the brain are the polyamidoamine 
dendrimers, which have an ethylenediamine (C2H4(NH2)2) core, 
amide (RC(=O)NR0R00) branches (where R, R0 and R00 are 
organic groups or hydrogen atoms) forming the walls of cavities 
and amino (–NH2), hydroxyl (–OH), or carboxylic acid (–COOH) 
functional groups as terminals [80, 81]. These dendrimers are Nanodrug Delivery System Strategies for Enhanced Brain Targeting 115 
small, highly stable, highly water-soluble, and functional groups 
can easily be attached to them, making them very suitable 
for the delivery of therapeutics [82]. The amino-terminated 
variants of polyamidoamine dendrimers are the most popular
in pharmaceutical research owing to their ease of bioconjugation 
using a variety of protein and/or peptide ligands [11]. Through the 
use of chemical linkages or encapsulation, drugs can be conjugated 
to the amino terminals of polyamidoamine dendrimers [80].
Drug delivery systems based on Dendrimers can use any among 
the transport system at the BBB to travel across it due to the 
significant variation in size and other physical characteristics of 
dendrimers [81]. 
3.5.4 Polymeric Nanoparticles 
Polymeric nanoparticles are solid, colloidal particles formed 
by polymers in which drugs can be dissolved, adsorbed, or 
encapsulated [83, 84]. They have gone forward to be one of the 
most successful candidates for drug delivery systems owing to 
their ability to undergo surface modification (e.g., PEGylation), 
nanosizing, bioactivity, controlled and sustained drug release, 
nontoxicity, bioavailability, biocompatibility, reticuloendothelial 
clearance bypass, and the encompassing of various active molecules 
including drugs, oligonucleotides, and peptides [10, 85]. Similarly 
to other solid nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, polymeric 
nanoparticles can be used for the active or passive targeting of
drugs to different tissues as a result of their high functional ability, 
exhibiting a broad range of physicochemical and biochemical 
characteristics [77]. The different types of polymeric nanoparticulate 
drug carrier systems are discussed below: 
3.5.4.1 PLGA nanoparticles 
Currently, attention is being paid to PLGA nanoparticles as 
potential nanocarriers of drugs across the BBB owing to their high 
biocompatibility, biodegradability and functional ability [86, 87]. 
This is because the hydrolysis products of PLGA; lactic acid (LA)
and glycolic acid (GA) in aqueous environments are easily
metabolized and eliminated from the body through the Krebs cycle 116 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
[87]. PLGA nanoparticles on their own do not have a sufficiently
long half-life after IV administration however, this can be 
significantly prolonged by using the polymer’s highly modifiable 
end-group [87, 88]. PLGA has a poor uptake by cells due to its 
negative surface charge thus, it does not readily cross the BBB.
These problems can be solved through the use of crosslinkers, 
surface adsorption and end-group modifications [87, 89].
Barbara et al. [90] showed that PLGA nanoparticles loaded
with curcumin and decorated with the glycopeptide “g7”
significantly reduced b-amyloid aggregation, which is a significant 
indicator of Alzheimer’s disease [90] while Wang et al. [91] showed 
increased accumulation of trimethylated chitosan conjugated
PLGA nanoparticles (TMC-PLGA NPs) in the periventricular
region of the cortex and the third ventricle of the brain with 
negligible cytotoxicity using an in vivo model. The researchers 
believe adsorptive-mediated transcytosis to be responsible for
TMC-PLGA NPs’ ability to cross the BBB [91]. 
3.5.4.2 PEG nanoparticles 
PEG like PLGA has low toxicity levels in the body, is biocompatible, 
though not biodegradable, is easily eliminated from the body 
by the kidneys, and is a highly modifiable polymer for drug
delivery [92]. Thus, PEG is a commonly used polymer in several 
pharmaceutical applications, including nanomedicine [86].
Covalently linking PEG onto another molecule (i.e., polymer, 
NP, drug, protein, antibody, etc.), is known as PEGylation. It 
is a common technique used for the conferring of function on 
several nanoparticulate drug carriers. An example of such an FDA 
approved drug is doxorubicin (used in the treatment of ovarian 
cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma and Kaposi’s sarcoma)
sold under the brand name DOXIL® (in the US) by Tibotec 
Therapeutics—a division of Ortho Biotech Products in New Jersey, 
USA [93, 94]. 
3.5.4.3 Copolymer nanoparticles 
Copolymers are polymers made from more than one single type of 
monomer. The surface modification to PLGA NPs by PEGylation of 
drug-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PEG-PLGA NPs) for brain drug Nanodrug Delivery System Strategies for Enhanced Brain Targeting 117 
delivery is an effective technique as the nanoparticles possess 
noticeably improved BBB permeating properties [86, 95]. Jeong et al.
[96] first synthesized the triblock copolymer PLGA–PEG–PLGA 
(PEP), which has exhibited a considerable increase in the delivery 
of encapsulated drugs to the brain in a study conducted by Chen
et al. [97]. 
3.5.5 Nanoemulsion 
These are nano-sized (<200 nm) heterogeneous dispersions of 
water-in-oil or oil-in-water stabilized using a suitable emulsifier 
[98, 99]. They are appropriate for the delivery of both the 
hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs and their permeation through 
the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) is facilitated 
by surface functionalization with suitable ligands. Nanoemulsions 
are commonly made of vegetable or animal oils, e.g., peanut 
oil, flaxseed oil, sunflower oil, hemp oil, wheat germ oil, fish oil, 
egg phosphatidylcholine, etc., making them highly compatible 
with biological membranes. Stability issues, however, limit its 
application [100].
Recent studies have shown the use of nanoemulsions for 
direct nose-to-brain delivery of drugs as well as drug delivery
through the parenteral route [101]. Ling Tan et al. [102] used 
parenteral nanoemulsion for brain targeting of carbamazepine to 
treat seizures and evaluated its pharmacokinetic efficiency. The
study revealed a higher pharmacokinetic profile and lower 
side effects of the drug when delivered as nanoemulsion than 
when delivered as the free drug solution [102]. In another study, 
Abdou et al. [103] assessed the brain targeting efficiency of 
encapsulated zolmitriptan; an anti-migraine agent nanoemulsion 
as a mucoadhesive and delivered it via the intranasal route. 
They found that the mucoadhesive intranasal nanoemulsion 
significantly enhanced the drug permeability, AUC and bio￾availability in the brain [103]. 
3.5.6 Viral Vectors 
Viruses are known to replicate by attacking their host to 
introduce their genetic material into the host cell [11]. This genetic 118 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
material is composed of instructions to produce more viruses. 
Thus, viruses end up taking over the host cell completely to fulfil 
their own needs with eventual taking over of more host cells 
[104, 105]. The genetic material that guides the replication of
viruses can be substituted with instructions that would be 
beneficial for the host, such as instructions to attack, poison and 
destroy cancerous cells. In essence, viral vectors can be used to 
deliver specific genes to treat or prevent diseases through gene 
therapy [106, 107]. In addition to gene therapy, viral vectors 
have recently been used as drug carriers, in which the drugs are 
encapsulated or infused with a vector that can be functionalized 
for targeted delivery [11]. Viral vectors compared to other drug 
delivery systems in gene transduction to the brain have about
80% transfection efficiency and long-term expression of 
transgenes within the non-dividing cells [10]. Lentivirus, herpes 
simplex virus (HSV), adenovirus (AdV) and adeno-associated 
virus (AAV) are examples of the viral vectors that have been 
used to achieve drug delivery into the brain [10]. Viral vectors as
drug delivery systems, however, still have issues linked to the 
high cost of production and their safety, as the administration 
of viruses carries a certain level of risk [24, 108, 109]. 
3.5.7 Carbon Nanotubes 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscaled cylinders of graphene 
sheets, which have become a promising nanocarrier system 
for therapeutic agents in many brain-specific therapies [10]. The 
potential activity of CNTs is due to their ability to undergo surface 
functionalization easily with specific chemical compounds, which 
leads to the variation in their physical and biological properties 
[101, 110]. Polymer-coated carbon nanodots and chemically 
functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can 
easily bypass the BBB and also form an interface with neurons 
based on several in vitro and in vivo models experiments. Thus 
resulting in enhanced uptake of CNTs at the site of a tumor 
[101, 110]. The limitations associated with CNTs include toxicity, 
high cost of production, no control over CNT length and chirality, 
batch-to-batch variation, and polydispersity in CNT type. Nanodrug Delivery System Strategies for Enhanced Brain Targeting 119 
3.5.8 Carbon Dots (CDs) 
These are a new class of zero-dimensional carbonaceous 
nanomaterials. Compared to traditional inorganic quantum dots or 
noble metal nanoclusters, CDs display improved properties thus, 
making them promising luminescent nanocarriers and probes [10].
One of the most fascinating characteristics of CDs is their fully 
color-tunable fluorescent from the blue to the near-infrared 
regions and the ease of surface modification for targeted delivery. 
CDs are mostly used in the biomedical field due to their physical
and optical properties that include feasible fluorescence, 
adjustable stability, and water solubility. These have made them 
powerful tools for use in chemo- or biosensing based on their 
tunable luminescence properties. The synthesis of CDs is cost￾effective. While CDs have good biocompatibility and low toxicity, 
their limitations include photobleaching, instability, particle￾particle aggregation, creation of a nonhomogeneous mixture, 
inability to be stored for very long, and size-induced toxicity; 
sizes <5 nm showed more toxic effects than sizes >10 nm [111]. 
3.5.9 Carbon Nano-Onions (CNOs) 
These onion-like carbonaceous zero-dimensional nanostructures 
are synthesized by thermal annealing of nanodiamonds at very
high temperatures and pressure in an inert atmosphere [112, 113].
They are composed of an average of six to eight graphitic shells 
with sizes ranging between 5 to 6 nm and the distance between 
two graphitic layers being 0.335 nm. They appear to be suitable 
candidates for biomedical applications due to their unique
electronic and structural features, which include a broad absorption 
band, a large surface area to volume ratio, the ability to reversibly 
accept multiple electrons, biocompatibility, and thermal stability 
[114]. Limitations to their use include poor dispersibility of CNOs 
in aqueous solution due to their hydrophobic nature resulting
in bioaccumulation and hence the toxicity of these nanocarriers, 
batch-to-batch variation due to the method of synthesis, and 
difficulty to easily bypass the BBB due to their high molecular
weight, which could lead to disruption of the integrity of the 120 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
BBB [114]. As a result of the poor solubility of CNOs, surface 
functionalization is carried out to avoid aggregation in organic 
and inorganic solvents due to intermolecular interactions such 
as van der Waals forces between the original nanostructures. 
3.6 Mechanisms of Nanodrug Release 
Nanodrug delivery systems are considered not only for the ability 
to convey drugs to the target site but also for the ability to release 
the drugs. There are a variety of mechanisms of drug release from 
different nanodrug delivery systems. Ensuring that polymers 
or composite materials or any form of nanocoating are easily 
degradable in the active site is essential for activity. Maintaining 
favorable release kinetics is highly paramount for overall drug 
efficacy. For liposomes, drugs are released after the dissolution 
of the lipid layers [115]. This occurs when the cellular membrane
lipids fuse with the lipophilic layers of the liposome, releasing 
drug contents [116]. Polymeric micelles release drugs via a 
diffusion mechanism of the drug and the rate at which the polymer 
is depolymerized [117]. Common mechanisms that underlie the 
different nanocarrier systems include diffusion, disintegration, 
dissolution, stimuli-controlled release and chemical interaction 
[118]. The stimuli-controlled release mechanism is observed 
in ultrasound micelle drug delivery. In this mechanism, an 
ultrasound device is used to stimulate the rupture of polymeric 
micelles in target tissues. This form of controlled release utilizes 
pressure waves. Other types of stimuli include temperature, 
pH gradient, etc., some of which are internal stimuli. This way, 
enhanced target specificity is achieved via the external or internally 
stimulated drug release mechanism [58]. The diffusion mechanism 
is usually observed in polymeric-encapsulated drugs in which 
drug dissolution first occurs within the capsule before it diffuses 
across the polymer nanocapsule into the target site [118]. For drugs 
with matrix-type nano-enclosure, there is no polymeric barrier 
hence the initial fast release of drugs is observed [118].
Some types of dendrimers release drugs via a degradation 
mechanism by which the polymers are degraded enzymatically or 
hydrolytically in vivo at the target site. Polymers such as polylactic Applications of Nanodrug Delivery Systems in Brain-Related Disorders 121 
acid (PLA) are bulk degraded, while in cases, where water entry 
into the matrix occurs much slower than the rate of degradation, 
surface erosion is typically observed [118]. In some cases, special 
drug release mechanisms are employed via surface changes. 
This is observed in liposomes adapted into pH-sensitive liposomes 
to trigger release in the acidic or basic medium of tissue [119] or 
with magnetic resonance imaging [120]. For polymeric micelles, 
the rate of drug release can be determined by the hydrophobicity 
and molecular weight of copolymers [118]. Some polymers show 
responses to heat and ultrasound as well. 
3.7 Applications of Nanodrug Delivery Systems 
in Brain-Related Disorders 
Nanodrug delivery systems are increasingly applied in the treatment 
of brain-related disorders, enhancing outcomes and improving 
the quality of life. There is a wide range of brain-related disorders 
affecting different parts of the brain resulting in different signs 
and symptoms. Examples of these include Parkinson’s disease, 
Alzheimer’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/multiple
sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, prion 
diseases, and; brain tumors, epilepsy, stroke, HIV encephalopathy, 
etc. 
3.7.1 Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease evident by 
the following symptoms: tremors, rigidity, akinesia and postural 
instability resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
nigrostriatal region [121]. While it is inheritable, studies have
shown that it may be caused by a combination of genetic and 
environmental factors. Commonly used drugs in the management 
of Parkinson’s include dopamine agonists such as ropinirole,
pramipexole; levodopa, and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors such 
as rasagiline, and selegiline. While these treatments have been 
effective in improving symptoms, novel nano delivery systems
help with new treatments and modifying disease therapies. In 
preclinical studies, the use of liposomes in loading dopamine 122 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
into the brain has been tested [122]. For sustained release,
polymeric nanoparticles have also been tested for other drugs
such as ropinirole, apomorphine, selegiline, etc. [123]. Polyethylene 
glycol attached to nanoparticles can be used to increase retention 
time and reduce the clearance of these drugs [123].
Nanoparticles in Parkinson’s disease have useful advantages 
not only in increasing retention time but also in cell targeting, 
triggered release, anti-aggregation, etc. For instance, phenylboronic 
acid can be used to modify nanoparticles for the triggered release
of apomorphine [123, 124]. This helps to prevent unwanted 
side effects by enabling release only in selective environments. 
Nanoparticles may sometimes have useful therapeutic effects,
such as gold nanoparticles, which have shown protective effects
in clinical trials for patients with Parkinson’s [123, 125]. 
3.7.2 Alzheimer’s Disease 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disease in which the 
brain cells undergo atrophy and die. This leads to symptoms such 
as loss of memory, difficulty performing tasks, and inability to
cater for oneself, then eventually leads to death. It is characterized 
by the presence of abnormal protein build-up in the brain and 
it is accountable for the majority of dementia around the world. 
In preclinical models, polymeric nanoparticles coupled with poly 
ethylene glycol have been tested in the management of AD [126]. 
A study was undertaken in which memantine was loaded into 
biodegradable polymeric NPs generated by the double emulsion 
process to improve the efficacy of memantine against AD. 
Targeting the AD brain with memantine-loaded NPs can reduce 
Aβ plaques and AD-related inflammation significantly [127].
Zinc-loaded polymeric nanoparticles tested in animal models in 
the management of AD showed sustained effect and target
specificity [126]. Nanogels containing deferoxamine have also
been found useful in the management of Alzheimer’s disease [128]. 
3.7.3 Huntington’s Disease 
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare disease in which the brain’s 
nerve cells continue to degenerate and this usually affects cognition, Applications of Nanodrug Delivery Systems in Brain-Related Disorders 123 
functional abilities, and locomotion, and may also cause psychiatric 
disorders. Symptoms usually appear in middle age after a person 
has had children, however, the disease can appear during any 
period between childhood and senescence [129]. Huntington is
found in all human and mammalian cells, with the largest quantities 
found in the brain and testes; modest amounts can also be found 
in the liver, heart, and lungs [130]. The function of the wild-type 
protein, as well as the pathophysiology of Huntington’s disease, 
are yet unknown. Common drugs used to control the jerking 
include tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine. In the management 
of Huntington’s disease, intranasal administration of chitosan 
nanoparticles loaded with siRNA was found effective in lowering 
Huntington’s disease gene expression [131]. To replenish selenium 
levels associated with HD, selenium nanoparticles were also 
tested in preclinical models to regulate cognitive decline [132]. 
3.7.4 Brain Tumors 
Brain tumors and cancers are a group of related disorders 
characterized by the abnormal proliferation of cells without 
regulated apoptosis. Brain cancers are more complicated because 
of difficulty inaccessibility, hence the need for novel systems such 
as nanodrug delivery systems. A wide variety of nanosystems have 
been tested for selectivity, ability to cross BBB, enhance retention 
time, etc. Based on evidence that nanoparticles can accumulate
in tissue sites with tumors, they can be used to treat intracranial 
tumors [133]. Polymeric nanoparticles made from polymers
such as poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) are approved for use in 
clinical applications. The hydrophobic shell of polymeric micelles 
also serves as a useful means of encapsulating anti-cancer 
drugs such as platinum [134]. Nanoliposomes are also useful in
enhancing the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer drugs in tumors such as 
glioblastoma [134]. 
3.7.5 HIV Encephalopathy 
HIV encephalopathy is an HIV complication which occurs when 
the virus reaches the CNS resulting in mental symptoms and 
disorders. The emergence of nanomedicine may be used to 124 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
manage this disease through nano-ARTs. A variety of nanoparticles 
have been tested and these include gold nanoparticles, silver 
nanoparticles, etc. The inhibition of CCR5 by TAK-779, an effective 
agent by conjugation of gold nanoparticles with a fragment is an 
example [135]. Silver nanoparticles were also found to be effective 
against the virus in vitro [135]. 
3.8 Nanodrug Delivery Systems at the Clinical 
Trials Stage 
Nanodrugs have been tested in various animal models under 
preclinical settings. Now, they are increasingly being tested in 
humans at different phases of clinical trials. Some of the nanodrug 
delivery systems at the clinical trials stage are shown in Table 3.3.
Despite the great advantages of nanodrug delivery systems, 
nanoneurotherapeutics still possess certain limitations that 
hamper their full implementation in clinical settings. One limitation 
is that as the size of the particles reduces to the nanoscale, 
certain physicochemical properties changes, which may result in 
unintended effects.

Brain tumor Phase I [139] 
Nanoparticles have larger surface areas and hence tend to 
become sticky with each other. The increased surface area of 
nanoparticles as a result of their smaller size causes an increase 
in chemical reactivity, which may impact how these nano-sized 
particles will react under different conditions and in the presence Future Research Direction/Development 125 
of cell membranes [140]. This may lead to the production of 
reactive species that may cause oxidative damage and cause 
toxicity. In addition, unpredicted effects may occur when they cross 
other membranes and barriers besides the blood-brain barrier. 
Nanoparticles may also cause damage to the lungs, although unclear 
[140]. Gold nanorods have been reported to be cytotoxic due to
the formulation. 
Another major factor that may hinder the progress in the 
use of nanomedicines is ethical concerns. Risk assessment, 
risk management, and risk communication in clinical trials are 
currently the most important ethical challenges in nanomedicine.
To win and sustain public support, it is critical to educate members 
of society on the benefits and risks of nanomedicine [141]. 
3.9 Future Research Direction/Development 
Nanotherapeutics hold unlimited potential in the management 
and treatment of diseases, especially for CNS disorders such as 
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, mania, depression, schizophrenia, 
brain tumors, cancer, etc. The field is dynamic and rapidly evolving 
with researchers all over the world inventing and discovering 
new liposomes, nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles, and medical 
devices to improve drug delivery to the brain [142]. Future
research points in the direction of fully elucidating the unique 
properties of nanomedicines and the influence of nanosize on 
the behavior of molecules. Numerous in vitro models would be 
required to ascertain this to suggest the direction for regulatory 
understanding. Evaluation of compounds on a nanoscale and their 
impact on biological processes points the arrow for new research.
Many more developments will likely spring up in the nanodrug 
delivery system for brain drug targeting in the coming years. 
Overcoming significant challenges in some systems like exosomes, 
for example, could be alleviated with artificial exosomes that do
not precipitate host immune reactions in the patients. Achieving 
precision in cell targeting could provide a gainful step in 
transformative systems in brain drug delivery. Nano-based drugs 
are yet to be fully implemented in clinical settings suggesting 
the need for more studies [142, 143]. While the permeation  
126 Nanodrug Delivery System for Brain Targeting 
of the BBB is the priority for nanosystems, protection from 
neurotoxicity is important. More data is needed on the toxicity 
profile of nanodrug delivery systems to ensure safety and 
suitability [142].
Nanomedicine is indeed exciting and provides a unique way
of solving formulation and delivery problems. Brain drug targeting 
is much more desirable since it eliminates the need for invasive 
delivery processes. In the future, more research may also be 
directed towards personalized treatments-pharmacogenomics. 
Pharmacogenomics ignores a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, studies 
the individual response to drugs based on expressed genes, and 
provides care to the patient uniquely. With a unique combination
of a nano approach in this field, particularly in cancer treatment 
where it has achieved significant results, enhanced decisions can
be made in enabling optimal outcomes [144].
It is conceivable that nanodrug delivery systems will be 
largely optimized across the management of an array of brain 
diseases following increased profile studies, characterization, 
and pharmacokinetic analyses. Increasing industrial acceptability 
and reducing manufacturing costs are largely key to facilitating 
availability and use, and application in clinical settings. 
3.10 Conclusion 
The applications of nanomedicine in brain targeting are immense 
and extremely useful in the treatment of brain diseases. Whether 
glioblastoma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s or any 
other disease, existing drugs can be modified to improve delivery, 
enhance retention and reduce clearance, and new drugs can be 
formulated in nano delivery systems to improve therapeutic 
outcomes. Future research may further help eliminate limitations 
and improve their application in clinical settings.

the cardiovascular system and, hence, display significant benefits
in addressing the issues. Nanoparticles and nanocarriers have 
garnered considerable attention in the field of cardiology because 
of various characteristics such as enhanced target selectivity,
and sensitivity followed by both active and passive targeting 
towards cardiac organs and tissues. Moreover, NDDS could act as 
a noteworthy and promising approach for treating cardiovascular 
disease patients by providing effective treatment, enhanced 
prognosis, and fewer non-target tissue side effects. This review 
will highlight the particulars of the prospective alternatives to the
current inadequate and conventional therapies available in the 
market as well as the promising future of nanotechnology in 
cardiovascular treatment and the challenges associated with their 
use. 
4.1 Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are considered to be a major public health 
concern worldwide, with the increased incidence of morbidity
and mortality among all the other diseases. Due to such a dire 
situation, finding suitable medications to treat these disorders 
has surged to the top of the priority list [1]. There are numerous 
challenges faced in treating cardiovascular disorders, including, 
failure to identify gaps in diagnosis and management, failure in 
identifying risk factors, inability to identify and meet individual 
needs, failure to diagnose these disorders, failure to access first￾line treatment approaches and lastly inability to recognize and use 
advanced treatment options and supportive care [2]. Overcoming 
these obstacles will result in the technological innovations, 
novel diagnostic procedures, and the utilization of modern 
technologies to aid in the management and therapy of CVDs [3]. 
With the technological advances in the field of nanoscience and 
the astounding functioning of nanomaterials, nanotechnology has 
surfaced as a promising approach for overcoming the limitations 
of existing cardiovascular disease treatment [4]. Nanodrug
delivery systems or NDDSs are nanomaterials with a dimension Introduction 149 
of 1–100 nm that can enhance the stability of drugs, improve 
water solubility, lengthen cycle periods, augment target cell or 
tissue absorption rates, and restrict enzyme degradation, hence 
enhancing medicine safety and effectiveness [5]. NDDSs are 
available in various formulations and can be delivered through a 
variety of routes including inhalation, oral route, and parenteral 
route such as intravenous injection, all of which have an enhanced 
bioavailability [6]. Prolonged circulating nanoparticles in the blood 
can increase drug retention in the bloodstream, resulting in higher 
nanoparticle extravasation from arteries and drug accumulation 
in other compromised organs possessing leaky microvasculature 
[7]. The targeted nanoparticles can be specifically permeated 
into the intended tissue after being armed with a homing device, 
resulting in much reduced adverse effects [8]. Because of the 
increased accumulation in diseased regions via passive and active 
targeted pathways, nanoscaled drug delivery systems can enhance 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features. Nanoparticles 
could also be surface coated using a variety of targeted, imaging, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic agents due to their large surface area to 
volume ratio [9]. For instance, various homing elements, including 
monoclonal antibodies and their components such as Fv, scFv and 
Fab, peptides, aptamers, and low molecular weight molecules that 
recognize a tissue ligand, are bound to the nanoparticle surface 
chemically in targeted drug delivery approach [10].
Numerous inorganic, organic, lipidic, and polymeric
materials are used in formulating NDDSs [11]. The structural and 
physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles including size, 
shape, stability surface charge, and perturbations of the surface
have been proven to affect their performances both in vitro and 
in vivo [12]. Moreover, enhanced surface-to-volume ratios make 
it easier to design multifunctional nanosystems [13]. Apparently, 
nanoparticle shape and surface charge can influence their 
penetration across blood-tissue and blood-brain barriers, cellular 
uptake and organ distribution [7]. Nanoparticles can be broadly 
classified on the basis of morphological and physiochemical 
characteristics as demonstrated in Fig. 4.1. 150 Beneficial Role of Nanodrug Delivery System in Treating Cardiovascular Disorders 
Figure 4.1 Broad classification of the nanoparticles. Various Cardiovascular Diseases and Their Mechanisms 151 
4.2 Various Cardiovascular Diseases and Their 
Mechanisms 
Atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis, which occurs as a result of 
hyperlipidemia and oxidation of lipids, is considered to be the 
prominent cause of illness and death worldwide. It can be defined 
as a disease involving vascular intima that can affect any part of 
the vascular system, from the aorta to the coronary arteries, and 
is described by the formation of intimal plaques [14]. The term 
atherosclerosis is derived from the words of Greek origin ‘gruel’ 
or ‘porridge,’ referring to the lipid substance found in the center 
of an atherosclerotic plaque or atheroma [15]. The risk factors for 
the disease comprise smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, obesity, 
hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, hypercholesterolemia, family 
history, age and diabetes mellitus. The clinical manifestations 
include stroke, vascular dementia, acute coronary syndrome, 
aortic aneurysm, stable angina, renovascular hypertension, and 
acute mesenteric ischemia [16, 17]. Every year, around 610,000 
individuals living in the United States succumb to cardiovascular 
disorders. This equates to one out of every four deaths. Coronary 
heart disease is regarded as the major reason for mortality in 
the Western world, taking away the lives of more than 370,000 
people each year. Annually, over 735,000 American individuals
are prone to heart attack. Notably, around 525,000 people suffer 
from an initial attack, whereas 210,000 individuals are prone
to a recurring attack. Approximately, 75% of acute myocardial
infarction cases can be attributed to plaque rupture, with 
the maximum likelihood of rupture occurring in men over the
age of 45 years, while the risk increases in women after the 
age of 50 [18]. Various factors including oxidative stress, 
imbalance in lipid metabolism, misconducted immune response, 
genetic predisposition and inflammation are involved in the 
pathophysiology of atherosclerosis [19]. The process begins with 
the formation of fatty streaks due to migration of low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) into the vasculature wall further 
causing endothelial dysfunction [20]. Furthermore, LDL-c gets
trapped in the arterial walls and undergoes the lipid peroxidation 
process to convert into oxidized LDL via the release of reactive 152 Beneficial Role of Nanodrug Delivery System in Treating Cardiovascular Disorders 
oxygen species and the free radicals. In addition, the oxidized LDL 
triggers the endothelial cells to release inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines and causes up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), 
interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and 
selectins [21]. This leads to the monocyte adhesion to endothelial 
cells, thereby further causing migration to subendothelial space 
[22]. Under the influence of macrophage-colony stimulating
factor, monocytes procure the characteristics of macrophage and 
express numerous scavenger receptors such as CD36, CD68, A
and B1, which bind Ox-LDL, anionic phospholipids and native 
lipoproteins [23, 24]. Moreover, the macrophages induce the
release of IL-6, IL-1 β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which 
further lead to atherosclerotic lesion progression [25]. Apparently, 
the growth and expansion of atherosclerotic plaque is promoted
by smooth muscle cell proliferation, their growth as well as 
migration towards tunica intima and chemoattraction of platelets 
towards the plaque [26]. The current treatment strategies for 
atherosclerosis comprise surgical procedures such as angioplasty 
and bypass grafting, whereas pharmacological therapy comprises 
statins (inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A 
(HMG-CoA) reductase) such as pravastatin, proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors such as alirocumab 
and evolocumab, immunosuppressant comprising of methotrexate 
and rapamycin [27]. 
Hypertension: Recurrently increased blood pressure in the 
systemic arteries is known as systemic arterial hypertension. 
The elevated blood pressure is the most common chronic risk 
factor for various cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, 
myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, chronic 
kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease, and 
remains the foremost cause of death and mortality globally [28].
Approximately 1.28 billion individuals in the age group of 
30–79 years are affected by this ailment, with the majority of 
them living in low and middle-income nations [29]. Poor dietary 
habits such as excessive salt intake, more consumption of a diet 
rich in saturated fats, decreased fruit and vegetable intake, lack of
exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption, and obesity are 
etiological factors for hypertension, which are also modifiable. Various Cardiovascular Diseases and Their Mechanisms 153 
Any past family history of hypertension, age above 65 years, and 
comorbidities including diabetes mellitus or renal problems are 
considered as non-modifiable risk factors [30]. A decline in renal 
pressure natriuresis, feedback system involving increased blood 
pressure and concomitant elevation in water and salt elimination 
are together implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertension. 
Moreover, pressure natriuresis can be caused by poor renal 
function, inappropriate hormone activation that controls the 
excretion of water and salt in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, or excessive sympathetic nervous system stimulation 
[31]. The combination of cardiac output and systemic vascular 
resistance can be considered as defining factors for blood pressure.
Patients with arterial hypertension might have an increase in 
cardiac output, raised systemic vascular resistance, or both. 
In younger patients, cardiac output is typically increased, whereas
in older patients, enhanced systemic vascular resistance and 
sustained vasculature stiffness have a significant effect. An 
increased vascular tone can be caused by the activation of the 
α-adrenoceptor and the secretion of peptides such as angiotensin
or endothelin [32]. The current treatment strategies for hyper￾tension comprise diuretics (thiazide, loop, potassium sparing), 
calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin receptor 
blockers, vasodilators (arteriolar or venous), β receptor and 
α receptor antagonists [33]. But, all of these antihypertensive 
medications have significant shortcomings, such as a low 
plasma half-life, poor bioavailability, and adverse effects such 
as angioedema, reflex tachycardia, upper respiratory tract 
abstraction, extreme hypotension. The nanoemulsions decrease 
blood pressure substantially, have an extended maintenance 
period, and could also yield approximately three times the dosage 
reduction when compared to the traditional dose [34]. 
Pulmonary Hypertension: A resting mean pulmonary arterial 
pressure of 25 mm Hg or higher is considered as pulmonary 
hypertension. The disease has a very poor prognosis and survival 
rate is also very less [35]. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is 
described by pulmonary arterial remodeling of the precapillary 
pulmonary arteries, as well as excessive vascular cell proliferation. 
Although the specific etiology is uncertain, there is growing 
evidence that inflammation might play a major role [36]. This 
disease is characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory 154 Beneficial Role of Nanodrug Delivery System in Treating Cardiovascular Disorders 
cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, ICAM-1, 
VCAM-1 and TNF-α, which furthermore recruit various immune 
cells like macrophages and neutrophils [37]. The current treatment 
strategies focus on suppressing proliferative or vasoconstriction 
pathways and increasing anti-proliferative pathways to restore 
normal pulmonary artery pressure. The common vasodilators 
used for treating the condition comprise type 5 phosphodiesterase 
inhibitors, antagonists of Prostaglandin I and Endothelin 
receptor. These vasodilators possess efficacy, but only limited 
and with greater systemic side effects [34]. Figure 4.2 gives a 
pictorial representation of pulmonary hypertension classification
according to the updated World Symposium on Pulmonary
Hypertension. 
Ischemic Heart Disease and Myocardial Infarction: 
Ischemic heart disease is a comprehensive term that refers 
to a group of closely related disorders induced by myocardial
ischemia, which is defined as an unbalance amongst cardiac 
circulatory system perfusion, myocardial oxygen, and nutrient
intake. Ischemic heart disease is the leading factor of mortality in
the U.S and other developed countries, claiming the lives of seven 
million people every year [38]. It is indeed caused primarily 
by thrombotic occlusion of a high-risk coronary artery, which 
leads to myocardial infarction or cardiovascular mortality. There 
is narrowing of blood vessels supplying to the myocardium 
which can be due to constriction or atherosclerosis leading to 
death of heart muscles which is termed myocardium infarction. 
Continuous pain can help confirm a diagnosis of myocardial 
infarction, but confirmation requires QRS abnormalities on an 
electrocardiograph (ECG), along with ST segment T changes and a 
rise in blood biomarkers produced from the damaged heart [39]. 
(The QRS complex represents the spread of a stimulus through the 
ventricles.) A multidisciplinary treatment strategy incorporates 
all these concerns in each patient. Use of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibition, aspirin, and efficient cholesterol reduction are 
three widely used approaches that have been shown to minimize 
mortality and morbidity in these patients. Beta-blockers have 
been proven to lower mortality in people who have previously 
experienced myocardial infarction. Other treatment strategies, 
including nitrates, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine, and beta￾blockers have indeed been proven to improve angina, ischemia,
and exercise performance [40]. Various Cardiovascular Diseases and Their Mechanisms 155 Figure 4.2 Pulmonary hypertension classification (in accordance with World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension). <TS: Recto running head for this section: >
156 Beneficial Role of Nanodrug Delivery System in Treating Cardiovascular Disorders 
Stroke and Thrombosis: The majority of strokes are 
thromboembolic in origin. If a cerebral blood artery becomes 
clogged, the tissues around it become hypoxic, glucose-, and 
hypo-perfused deficient. That section of brain tissue eventually 
dies. Ischemic stroke can also be caused by minor and big arterial 
thromboembolism with identified cardiac or vascular causes. 
Systemic hypoperfusion or venous thrombosis can also induce 
it. The brain tissue injured by hypoperfusion is not uniformly 
affected; however, the intensity spectrum reflects the affected 
subject’s collateral circulation [41]. The Willis circle can be used 
to provide collateral flow, although it is usually just partial, and 
the obstruction occurs largely downstream, limiting compensating 
flow. As a result, the center of the infarct zone is severely 
hypoperfused and suffers from acute necrotic cell mortality, 
while the rest of the region is partially damaged and has a higher 
rate of apoptotic cell death. Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) production is impaired whenever the ischemia cascade is 
activated. This has various molecular and cellular implications, 
including inflammation or vascular changes. Cellular hypoxic 
ischemia finally results in membrane ion pump dysfunction, 
potassium ion loss, as well as increased gain of sodium, calcium, 
and chloride ions, and production of cytotoxic edema [42, 43]. 
The platelet cascade and coagulation cascade both initiate the 
process known as thrombogenesis. The synthesis of fibrin from 
its own inactive state forms fibrinogen, via thrombin cleavage is 
of special importance. Thrombin also stimulates glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa on platelets in an indirect manner, therefore it is implicated 
in both cascades. Active glycoprotein IIb/IIIa subsequently 
binds fibrin, causing the attached platelets to release secondary 
messengers, including a burst of thrombin, speeding up the 
formation of the thrombus [44]. Furthermore, all thrombi have 
limited space amongst their building elements, rendering them 
very dense. This makes thrombi more difficult to break down and 
restricts therapeutic penetration, emphasizing the need for new 
treatment techniques [45]. <TS: Recto running head for this section: >
NDDSs as an Emerging Therapeutic Option for Treating CVS Disorders 157 
4.3 Nanodrug Delivery Systems as an 
Emerging Therapeutic Option for Treating 
Cardiovascular System (CVS) Disorders
Potential Role of NDDSs in Treating Atherosclerosis: 
Nanoparticles can be used to treat atherosclerosis by improving 
drug solubility, lowering drug dosages, minimizing cytotoxicity, 
enhancing targeted drug delivery at particular concentrations,
and combining diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to develop 
an effective theranostics [46]. The targets for drug therapy 
comprise macrophage aggregation, protease expression, enhanced 
platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecules and increased vascular 
permeability [47]. The medication could be targeted towards the 
plaques using a nanodrug carrier to efficiently enhance the plasma 
half-life of the drug, enhance the lesion concentration, and limit 
adverse effects [27]. The therapy techniques of these carriers
include controlling lipoprotein levels, decreasing inflammation, 
blocking neovascularization and minimizing coagulation [48]. 
Matoba et al. have demonstrated using an experimental mouse 
model of plaque rupture that the phagocytic cells, monocytes 
and neutrophils in the circulation and aortas assimilated FITC￾loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles 2 h after 
injection using flow cytometric analysis. In the aortic arch, FITC￾NP developed in atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, FITC-NP 
delivery towards monocytes was accompanied by its transmission 
to aortic macrophages 2–7 days post injection, implying that 
PLGA nanoparticles are delivered directly to blood monocytes, 
which then further move towards the atheromatous aorta [49].
It has been revealed that in rabbits that underwent iliac 
artery stenting, liposomal preparations of the bisphosphonate
alendronate reduced neointimal development and thereafter 
inhibited circulating monocytes. In clinical testing, liposomal 
alendronate was proven to be safer for infusion during
percutaneous coronary intervention [46]. Some reports have 
revealed the beneficial role of surface-modified copper sulfide 
nanoparticles in aiming towards transient receptor potential 
vanilloid-1 and preventing the accumulation of lipids in the arteries. 158 Beneficial Role of Nanodrug Delivery System in Treating Cardiovascular Disorders 
Hyperlipidemia is a known risk factor for causing atherosclerosis. 
The cytotoxic medication paclitaxel was demonstrated to accelerate 
atherosclerosis stagnation in a cholesterol-rich nanoemulsion 
and, when evaluated in vivo, it exhibited a 65% decrease in the 
volume of the atheroma with reduced toxicity [50]. It has
been demonstrated that encapsulated prednisolone phosphate 
amid PEGylated 3,5-dipentadecyloxybenzamidine hydrochloride 
liposomes significantly reduced in-stent neointimal development
in atherosclerotic rabbits. The addition of glycosaminoglycans 
(GAGs) to these liposomes caused their binding to chondroitin 
sulfate proteoglycans. Moreover, these findings also revealed
that the synthesized liposomes have fewer systezmic adverse
effects [51]. In another experimental study, VCAM-1-directed 
target sensitive liposomes (TSL) carrying Teijin (chemokine 
receptor 2 antagonist) were created to target the early
inflammation process by eliminating monocyte adhesion and 
transmigration, which are frequently involved processes in 
atherosclerosis. The dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)
and dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) mixture was used to make
PEG-stabilized TSLs, and a synthesized phospholipid anchor,
namely Mal-PEG-DSPE was attached to the liposome surface to
pair with VCAM-1 binding peptide. Various characteristics including 
release patterns, size, and serum stability of the manufactured 
targeted liposomes were all measured. The binding affinity with
the target was used to verify its functionality. TSL binding
efficiency was measured using activated endothelial cells in a 
competitive binding assay employing flow cytometry. The results 
revealed significant selective binding of targeted liposomes to cell 
surface [52]. Table 4.1 demonstrates the various nanocarriers used 
as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in treating atherosclerosis. 
Potential Role of NDDSs in Treating Hypertension 
and Pulmonary Hypertension: Nanotechnology is being used 
to enhance the therapeutic management of hypertension. Gold 
and silica nanoparticles have been produced to improve the 
bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) to dysfunctional vasculature 
[61]. In addition, cerium dioxide nanoparticles having antioxidant 
capacity have been shown to reduce both antioxidant levels 
and microvascular impairment when evaluated in vivo [62]. Table 4.1 Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery system in targeting atherosclerosis

Table 4.2 represents the FDA-approved antihypertensive agents 
used along with nanoparticles in vivo. Although there are no 
medically authorized nanoformulations for treating pulmonary 
hypertension, preclinical studies are underway to see if they 
may be used to treat the condition. The NF-κB polymeric
nanoformulation is one such example. There is a build-up in the 
amount of NF-κB in the presence of pulmonary hypertension
lesions. Targeting the NF-κB receptors using a polymeric
nanoparticle-NF-κB antagonist combination forestalled the 
disease and increased the life expectancy of such patients [63]. 
Incorporation of statins such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
to polymeric nanoparticles has been proven to be beneficial in 
attenuating inflammation and decreasing lipid levels and might 
be useful in treating pulmonary hypertension [64]. Encapsulation 
of polylactide-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles with beraprost in 
a rat model revealed that beraprost nanoparticles reduced right 
ventricular pressure and hypertrophy after a single treatment. 
The rate of survival of the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model was 
dramatically improved by Beraprost-nanoparticles. After their 
administration, no inflammatory cell infiltration, bleeding, or 
fibrosis was identified in the heart, kidney, liver and spleen [65].
In another experimental model of rats, a single intratracheal 
injection of imatinib-incorporated nanoparticles prevented
MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension. On human pulmonary
hypertension-pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, imatinib￾incorporated nanoparticles demonstrated a long-lasting
antiproliferative impact [66]. In MCT-induced pulmonary
hypertensive rats, Gupta et al. found that the administration of 
liposomal fasudil via intratracheal route lowered mPAP and that 
lasted for around 3 h, implying that liposomal pharmaceutical 
preparations caused pulmonary selective vasodilation [67].
Strikingly, in another experimental study performed on Sugen5416/
hypoxia rat models by Kanaya et al., the beneficial role of 
nanospheres of ONO1301 (prostacyclin agonist) was demonstrated. 
The treatment of ONO1301 nanospheres resulted in decreased
IL-6, 1L-1β, transforming growth factor-β levels, lowered the 
number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive smooth
muscle cells, resulted in a higher right ventricle/left ventricle 
pressure ratio and hence ameliorated pulmonary arterial 
hypertension [68]. Table 4.3 describes nanocarriers experimentally 
tested in pulmonary hypertensive rat models. Table 4.2 Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery system in targeting hyper-tension

Potential Role of NDDSs in Treating Ischemic Heart 
Disease and Myocardial Infarction: In the infarcted heart, 
lipid nanoparticles are considered as an effective drug delivery 
system. This drug delivery system has been widely used for 
delivery of imaging diagnostic substances, proteins, peptides, and 
low molecular therapeutic agents. A study conducted by Paulis 
and co-workers considered micelles as a promising system to 
deliver cardioprotective drugs in the acute stage of myocardial 
infarction and even in infarcted heart of patients that are in chronic
myocardial infarction stage [72, 73]. Liposomes, on the other 
hand, are better at delivering pro-angiogenic medicines to the 
infarcted microvessels. Dendrimers have enhanced binding
capability and effective binding with antibodies and certain ligands. 
Nanomaterials are nano-sized vesicles that can operate as a 
controlled release delivery mechanism for therapeutic substances 
and improve myocardial restoration in ischemic heart disease. 
A study conducted by Xue et al. reported the reduction in infarct 
size and showed apoptosis of cardiomyocytes when microRNA-1 
inhibitor was encapsulated inside dendrimer in an acute 
myocardial ischemia mouse model [74]. Another study conducted NDDSs as an Emerging Therapeutic Option for Treating CVS Disorders 163 
by Katsuki et al. showed that the positive impact of polymeric 
nanoparticles encapsulated in a statin matrix in the treatment 
of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, rupturing or 
destabilization of plaque and remodeling of ventricles after 
an acute myocardial infarction episode [64]. Copper contains 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective properties. 
Sharma et al. administered the infarcted rat with a small dosage 
of copper nanoparticles and found that it reduced inflammatory 
cytokines and oxidative stress and induced apoptosis via pathways 
like phosphorylate GSK-3 kinase. Gold nanoparticles injected 
intravenously at a dosage of 400 μg/kg/day for 14 days may
indeed ameliorate myocardial damage following myocardial 
infarction event in rats by decreasing endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase immune reactivity, Bcl-2, and collagen fibers. In the rat 
acute myocardial infarction model, intramyocardial administration 
of a nanodrug delivery system composed of graphene oxide
packed with the vascular endothelial growth factor-165 gene 
results in a considerable reduction in infarct size reduction and 
augmentation capillary density [75]. Overall large percentage of 
in vivo investigations have revealed that nanoparticle approaches 
have a high potential for enhancing the performance and 
tissue repair of the infarcted heart. However, decorating these
nanoparticle systems with cardioactive molecules or non-invasive 
physical signals can increase the recruitment and distribution of 
these nanoparticles, as well as their therapeutic benefits, to the 
target tissues. Various types of nanodrug delivery systems that
have been tested in myocardial infarction are discussed in 
Table 4.4. 
Potential Role of NDDSs in Treating Stroke and Thrombosis: 
To guarantee optimal patient care, stroke damage is very dynamic
and complicated, necessitating accurate treatment and diagnosis 
using modern technologies. In this area, nanotechnology and its 
derivatives are showing promising outcomes. To identify macro￾phages inside atherosclerotic plaques, gold nanoparticles have 
been utilized as a contrast media in intravascular photoacoustic
imaging. Intravascular photoacoustic imaging is indeed an invasive 
method that scans atherosclerotic tissues using ultrasonography 164 Beneficial Role of Nanodrug Delivery System in Treating Cardiovascular Disorders 
through a catheter [83]. To avoid the negative implications 
of delivering large gold nanoparticles, MRI-guided targeted 
ultrasonography is employed using thiolated polyethylene glycol 
(PEG)-coated gold nanoparticles 50 nm total diameter. These 
gold nanoparticles have an improved kinetic profile and can pass 
the blood-brain barrier, as well as better solubility and stability 
[84]. Several liposomal systems have indeed been described for 
the management of ischemic stroke. Liposomal compositions 
for ischemic stroke have shown promising outcomes in animal
testing, as seen by decreases in infarct volume and brain edema, 
as well as advances in behavioral outcomes. Surface modification 
using PEG across the lipid layer slowed opsonization and 
increased liposome lifespan. Stimuli-responsive liposomes
were also produced, allowing therapeutic drugs for stroke to be
delivered in a controlled fashion [85, 86]. When injected further
into cisterna magna of rats having ischemic stroke, iron-tagged 
neural progenitor cells migrated to the ischemic area and 
stimulated angiogenesis [87]. Nanofibers have also been proven
to nourish transported stem cells, allowing them to multiply and 
thrive, leading to glial migration and neurite sprouting [88].
A variety of theranostic nanoparticles carrying different 
imaging moieties and medicines have been created for the
detection, mitigation, and management of thrombosis. A study 
conducted by Groult et al. utilized iron oxide nanoparticles for 
delivering anti-coagulant agent Heparin and the same system
was utilized by McCarthy et al. for delivery of tissue plasminogen
activator in a retrospective treatment study [89, 90]. Silica-based 
ceramic vehicles have now been employed in stroke medication 
delivery. It has been demonstrated that tissue plasminogen 
activator coupled to silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles
accumulates at the thrombus location. Huang et al. described 
an activated platelet-sensitive nanocarrier effective for causing 
preferential thrombolysis by active targeting and regulated
release of tissue plasminogen activator to blood clots [91].
Various types of nanodrug delivery systems that have been tested
in thrombosis are discussed in Table 4.5.

4.4 Conclusion and Future Perspectives
Cardiovascular ailments and their related health comorbidity
are certainly a major cause of deaths globally. Even though some
of the ailments are treatable, healthcare experts continue to be 
concerned about coronary artery diseases due to the rapid
lifestyle changes in humans. For the prevention and treatment 
of cardiovascular disorders, there are several cardioprotective 
medications accessible, and newer therapeutic strategies such 
as natural products and traditional Chinese medicine are gaining 
popularity in the medical system. These techniques and substances 
are favored over synthetic medications since they have fewer
negative effects. However, because these drugs have not been 
validated by scientific investigations, they have often struggled to 
reach inpatient practice. The conventional treatment approaches 
are associated with a greater risk of adverse effects including 
thrombosis, abnormal immune system activation and toxicity.
As a result, nanodrug delivery systems are being used as an 
alternate medium to deliver medications to damaged cardiac tissue 
in an efficient and appropriate manner. Similarly, nanoparticles 
offer a wide range of applications in the detection and imaging of 
cardiovascular disorders, allowing for quick diagnostic approaches 
and real-time monitoring while the treatment is going on. 
Numerous cardiovascular nanoformulations have been studied 
in vitro and in vivo in clinical studies, but their clinical adaptation
is still being worked on. Furthermore, as the utility of nanomaterials 
expands, so does the vulnerability to nanoparticles in clinical 
settings. As a result, nanomaterials will have additional ways of 
engaging with vasculature and systemic components, which will 
further impose significant repercussions on the overall well-being 
of the human. There is limited research information on biological 
outcomes to evaluate the association between nanoparticle
physiochemical properties such as size, shape, surface structure
and cardiovascular system toxicity. As a result, more intensive 
research approaches are required for evaluating these harmful 
effects and pathways of ordinary nanomaterial exposure, so 
that experts can use nanomaterials in a better way to prevent, 
mitigate, or decrease the incidence of potential health risks. Table 4.6 Demonstration of ongoing clinical trials for various nanoformulations and devices in treating cardiovascular disorders [99]

In addition, more in vivo approaches and clinical trial studies are 
needed to fully understand the impact of nanoparticles on the 
human body system and cardiac cells. Prospective nanocarrier 
designs and improvements will necessitate further research. 
Various nanoformulations and nanodevices are being investigated 
under clinical trials for treating cardiovascular diseases such as 
atherosclerosis, angina and heart failure as depicted in Table 4.6.

An acute or persistent joint infection is known as arthritis, and it 
may cause a huge variety of symptoms, along with pain, stiffness, 
a decrease in the variety of motion, and joint abnormalities. The 
kinds of arthritis, i.e., rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis 
had been mentioned in this article. In RA patients, infection was 
caused by means of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6,
IL-8, and IL-10. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications 
(NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), and a few biological agents are the most popular RA 
remedies. However, not one of the remedies available is capable

of attaining the final purpose for treating, i.e., drug-free remission. 
Microemulsions, microspheres, micelles, liposomes, microballoons, 
co-crystals, nanoemulsions, dendrimers, microsponges, and 
different strategies had been employed for intrasynovial medicine 
administration. Because of their size and chemical composition, 
liposomes have been demonstrated to be specifically effective for 
maintaining the drugs in the synovial cavity. In contrast to present 
drugs, novel nanotherapeutic strategies have proven greater
selective targeting, extended half-life, subtle bioavailability, and 
decreased systemic toxicity with the use of nanomaterials and 
sensible nanomedicines. 
5.1 Introduction to Arthritis 
The term “disease of joints” in Greek is the origin of the word 
“arthritis.” Arthritis is defined as an acute or chronic inflammation 
of joints which is often accompanied by pain and structural
damage. Numerous symptoms such as pain, stiffness, reduced 
movement, and joint abnormalities can be attributed to arthritis. 
The kind of arthritis can be identified through history and
physical examination. Apart from this, laboratory and imaging 
tests may also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. More
than 100 different forms of arthritis have been identified 
among which osteoarthritis is the most prevalent. Osteoarthritis 
is a non-inflammatory type of arthritis. There are numerous 
circumstances which can lead to the development of inflammatory 
arthritis. These may be caused through autoimmune processes 
(psoriatic arthritis, RA, ankylosing spondylitis, etc.), inflammation 
caused by crystal deposition (gout, alkaline calcium phosphate 
disease, pseudogout). Other autoimmune connective tissue 
diseases such as Sjoergen’s syndrome, myositis, and celiac disease 
may also be associated with inflammatory arthritis [1].
Depending on the kind of arthritis, many causes can be 
identified. The main contributing causes of osteoarthritis are 
advanced aging, joint damage, female sex and obesity. A few 
genetic variables have been identified, including mutations in
genes that produce collagen types II, IV, V and VI [2]. On the other 
hand, RA is an inflammatory autoimmune disease. Smoking and Introduction to Arthritis 181 
other environmental variables interact to cause the immune 
system’s activation and dysfunction, which in turn causes 
inflammation in RA [3–4].
On imaging, more than one third of the population in America 
has arthritis, and this percentage will inevitably rise as the average 
population age rises. 19–30% of adults of osteoarthritis, 27% of 
adults are suffering from hip osteoarthritis [5–7]. One percent 
of Caucasians have RA, with females (lifetime risk of 3.6%) more 
typically affected than males (lifetime risk of 1.7%). The condition 
often manifests in early adulthood, with the prevalence of disease 
up to 5% in women over 65 years of age [8]. 
Figure 5.1 Various factors affecting RA. 
A degenerative cascade of gradual cartilage loss results in 
bone deterioration is the hallmark of osteoarthritis. Subchondral 
cysts, osteophytes and the thickening of the subchondral plate are 
the necessary characteristic features. Joint collagen is degraded 
as a result of the induction of proteolytic enzymes like matrix 
metallo-proteinases, serine proteases and cysteine proteinases
by IL-6, interferon-induced protein 10, monokines and macro￾phages chemotactic protein [9]. The thickness of the cartilaginous
matrix is decreased and subsequently destroyed by the 182 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
calcification of the articular cartilage around it. Additionally,
when chondrocyte function declines with age, osteoarthritic 
degeneration susceptibility increases. RA often has more severe 
symptoms than that of osteoarthritis. An autoimmune reaction 
to an environmental stimulus results in the systemic and 
persistent inflammatory condition known as RA. Endothelial cell 
activation and synoviocyte hyperplasia precede cartilage and, 
ultimately, bone destruction. Following the abnormal generation 
of inflammatory mediators, the disease develops [10]. Various 
factors affecting RA as shown in Fig. 5.1. 
5.2 Nanotechnology for RA Therapy 
Nanotechnology deals with the exploitation of nuclear-level issues 
to produce newer novel nanomaterials, which has increased in 
recent years, due to its capacity to manufacture sophisticated 
nanomaterials, items, and procedures chosen at the nanoscale. 
Because of nanotechnology’s ability to create complex nanoscale 
materials, products, and processes, there has been an interest in 
using concerns at the nuclear level to create new nanomaterials 
that have seen growth in recent years [11–12]. This technique 
has progressively expanded the potential uses of nanoparticles 
in cosmetics during the past few years. In order to improve their 
solubility and change their physical characteristics, liposomal 
technologies have been used. These technologies have produced 
hydrophilic vesicles with phosphatidylcholine membranes [13]. 
(a) Nanotechnology-based gene therapy: Synovial cytokines 
are important in the pathophysiology of RA, and they also 
serve as the basis for the current RA treatment approaches,
which include monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 and IL-1β
because of their damaging effects on articular cartilage and bone.
Despite their success, there are still a number of restrictions 
on how these biologics can be used [14–15]. A promising
therapeutic strategy for many human diseases is gene therapy, 
in which nucleic acids are introduced into cells to silence, 
suppress, or abrogate the aberrant expression of proteins. In RA, 
gene therapy shows promise for a local, joint-specific, targeted
approach to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression or Nanotechnology for RA Therapy 183 
overexpress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arthritis medications 
provide long-lasting anti-inflammatory benefits while avoiding 
systemic side effects.
A constantly expanding field includes the exploration for
the appropriate non-viral, nanotechnology-based vectors for gene 
therapy that have many benefits such as low immunogenicity, 
infection threat and no insertional mutagenesis. Numerous of
these nanotechnological methods have already received in-depth 
reviews elsewhere [16–19]. As per different studies conducted
in pre-clinical animal models, non-viral delivery techniques for 
gene therapy appears to be promising. The difficulty though,
will be managing the possibility of off-target side effects while 
overcoming the silencing effect’s transient nature. 
(b) Nanotechnology-based antiangiogenic approaches: 
Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre￾existing vessels. It is one of the initial histological signs of RA and 
is typically observed in inflammatory regions. Angiogenic blood 
vessels help leukocytes be recruited to the region of inflammation 
and provide nourishment for the RA synovium [20]. The synovium 
produces numerous important pro-angiogenic molecules, which 
include growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules 
and proteases. In addition, there are a variety of endogenous 
antiangiogenic substances such as angiostatin, theombospordin, 
IL-4, endostatin, IL-3, etc. It is widely acknowledged that a new 
vessel development and inflammation are sustained in RA due to 
an imbalance between antiangiogenic and pro-angiogenic agents 
[21]. Many of the current RA medications have an indirect impact 
on angiogenesis through altering cytokines and growth factors. 
For example, combined treatment using MTX and GCs modifies 
the amount of VEGF and FGF produced by RA patients’ serum 
and cultured cells [22]. Recent years have seen the emergence 
of nanosystems designed specially to prevent pro-angiogenic 
mediators or pathways. Recent research has demonstrated the 
antiangiogenic capabilities of nanogold particles. Although VEGF
is a key player in angiogenesis and its suppression is a topic of
active research for the treatment of cancer, direct targeting of
this pathway from a nanotechnology perspective has not yet 
been fully developed for treating RA. Integrin αvβ3 deserves 184 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
special attention among the other particular mediators under 
investigation for antiangiogenic therapy. In animal models, it 
has been demonstrated that inhibiting αvβ3 integrin reduces
synovial angiogenesis have shown promise in the treatment of 
inflammatory arthritis. These systems deserve further study to
fully assess their efficacy and toxicities in vivo. Additionally,
brand new antiangiogenic targets as HIF-α are still being
discovered and should be taken into account. It needs to be seen 
if antiangiogenic therapy focused on a single factor or pathway
will have a long-lasting effect or whether it will need to be 
coupled with other medications for maintaining efficacy [23]. 
5.3 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for RA Treatment 
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), which integrate the uses of 
polymeric nanoparticles and o/w emulsions, are colloidal 
carriers that have particle sizes between 120 and 200 nm, 
which can be often used for controlled drug transport [24, 25].
The outstanding properties of SLNs consist of their excessive drug 
loading capacity, proper tolerability, safety of integrated energetic 
compounds from chemical degradation, better bioavailability
by the incorporation of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs 
and relative protection for organic applications [26]. Due to 
their distinct size range, SLNs are hardly ever cleared from the 
stream through the reticuloendothelial device. SLNs generally 
comprise physiological lipids along with phospholipids, fatty 
acids, mono, di and triglycerides. SLNs may be made with
the use of numerous processes, which include excessive shear 
homogenization, excessive pressure homogenization, bloodless 
homogenization, ultrasound, warm homogenization and 
evaporation methods. Greater attention has been positioned 
on lipid-based formulations in latest years so as to increase the 
oral bioavailability of drug treatments which might be poorly 
water-soluble using SLNs [27]. Because of its superior physical 
stability, ease of scale-up, reasonably priced and production, 
the drug service combines the benefits of polymeric nanoparticles, 
fats emulsions and liposomes [28]. Arora et al. created Recent Advancements for RA Therapy 185 
curcumin-loaded stable lipid nanoparticles (C-SLNs) to deal with 
irritation through overcoming curcumin’s low bioavailability
problems [29]. They confirmed that SLNs have been the premiere 
drug transport device for drug encapsulation and controlled 
release. By decreasing the discharge of inflammatory cytokines, 
Piroxicam-SLNs confirmed the anti-inflammatory outcomes in 
edematous sites. 
For the remedy of RA, the significance of stable lipid
nanoparticle-based formulations can also additionally provide 
a controlled and sustained release sample with reducing dose 
frequencies. These stable lipid-based nanoparticles will also be 
capable of increasing the bioavailability of the drugs contained 
inside them when used to treat RA. 
5.4 Recent Advancements for RA Therapy 
The effective treatment of RA has recently been attempted using 
siRNA, peptides and targeted nanoformulation methods. 
(a) siRNA-based nanoparticulate system: RNA interference 
(RNAi) is defined as a cellular process that silences messenger 
RNA(mRNA)-based genes post transcriptionally. Small interference 
RNA (siRNA)-based silencing is only temporary, hence new 
methods have been devised and described to produce silencing 
that is more long-lasting. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA), is a vector￾encoded technique that can be employed for long-lasting, reliable 
cell silencing. RNAi has a great potential for gene silencing and 
has gained popularity because of its high specificity, considerable 
impact, few side effects and ease of production. A particular 
gene of interest can be silenced with siRNA. When naked siRNA 
was administered systemically, the difficulty was that it was 
degraded by nucleases, which shortened the time that siRNA spent
circulating in the blood. Additionally, siRNA is taken up by 
receptor-mediated endocytosis and escaping from the endosomal 
compartment, which reduces the healing efficacy of the naked 
siRNA. The development of products based on nanotechnology, 
however, has lately overcome these problems. The siRNA had
been enclosed in positively charged particles in order to provide 186 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
better protection. This successfully shields the siRNA from 
degradation of serum and off-target immunological effects. 
In latest years, the delivery systems based on siRNA were used
to deal with RA, mainly due to the fact they will successfully 
reach peripherally inflamed tissues. Small interference RNA 
(siRNA), which has a high degree of specificity and the ability 
to silence genes, is a key player in the important phenomenon 
known as RNA interference. Komano et al. conducted a study
in which they came to the conclusion that TNF-α siRNA/WS 
therapy lowers TNF-αmRNA levels in the joints when compared
to the controlled group. The effective transport of siRNA to
arthritic joints was highlighted lastly [30].
RGD functionalized siRNA-loaded poly (lactide-co-glycolide) 
(PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) have been created by Scheinman
et al. as a nanosystem for STAT1 siRNA transport to joint tissues
of CIA mice model. After siRNA encapsulation, they found the
stability and the nanoparticle properties. For the remedy of
arthritis, RGD functionalized PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating 
STAT1-focused siRNAs can be extra efficient, probably through 
selectively inhibiting macrophages and dendritic cell activation 
[31].
Park et al. created PLGA nanoparticles that were loaded 
with siRNA and dexamethasone in RA therapy. Here, PLGA 
nanoparticles were first loaded with dexamethasone before being 
combined with poly(-ethyleneimine) (PEI)/siRNA. They concluded 
that COX-2 siRNA – complexed PLGA nanoparticles loaded with 
dexamethasone effectively reduced the expression of genes and 
protein linked to arthritic diseases [32].
For the successful remedy of arthritis, Duan et al. created 
core-shell NPs that had been loaded with siRNA. For delivering 
siRNA, they created the nanocarrier using (polyethyleneimine 
[PEI] superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle [SPIO]), which 
combines an iron oxide core with a PEI shell. According to in 
vitro investigations, siRNA-loaded PEI-SPIOs confirmed no 
cytotoxicity, better siRNA stability, and brought about focused 
gene silencing. When an outside magnetic field is applied, PEI￾functionalized SPIOs utilized for systemic siRNA administration
in RA provide an extra healing benefit [33]. Recent Advancements for RA Therapy 187 
(b) Targeted nanoparticulate system: Active targeting ligands 
including antibodies, peptides and polysaccharides can be used 
to further increase drug delivery systems’ therapeutic efficacy 
and specificity for treating a variety of illnesses. Both active and 
passive targeting were used. The nanoparticulate formulation has 
been specifically designed to target the preferentially expressed 
CD44 surface receptors for the treatment of RA. Growth factors, 
chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules 
and proteases are mediating factors that are crucial to the 
development of RA. Angiogenesis and inflammation were the 
factors in this plan that contributed to the development of RA. 
A nanoparticle made of alginate and encapsulated with plasmid 
DNA that codes for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was 
created by Jain et al. Therefore, they found that these IL-10 plasmid 
DNA-loaded targeted alginate nanoparticles may effectively 
repolarize macrophages from M1 to M2 state, providing a novel 
cure for chronic inflammatory disorders [34]. 
Synovial joints have been described by Yang et al. It is 
specifically attacked in autoimmune arthritis of the articular 
vasculature. They used a human RA model of adjuvant-induced 
arthritis to profile the synovial vasculature (both ex vivo and in 
vivo) of specific phage peptide display libraries. They discovered 
that synthesized peptides have specificity in preventing the 
binding of each phage to the synovial vasculature as well as binding 
to the endothelial cells originating from joints. It’s interesting 
to note that using one of these peptides to treat arthritis-prone 
animals effectively stopped the disease’s progression. However, 
peptide-induced reduction of T-cell trafficking into the joints 
and preventing angiogenesis were used to reduce arthritis. 
Additionally, the peptide was different from a previously studied 
peptide which contained arginine-glycine-aspartic acid in terms 
of sequence, receptor binding selectivity and inflammation-related 
cell signaling. They demonstrated how peptides could be further 
used to distribute anti-arthritic medications only to the affected 
joints, increasing their effectiveness and lowering systemic 
toxicity [35]. 188 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
(c) Peptide-based nanoparticulate system: Recently, peptides 
have attracted significant for use in medication delivery for a variety
of treatment modalities. After being subjected to enzymatic
proteolysis, bioactive peptides generated from naturally occurring 
sources of protein have biological effects for a variety of diseases. 
The majority of peptides have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, anti-cancer, antidiabetic and antihypertensive
effects. Peptides had limited bioavailability, metabolic liability, 
gastrointestinal tract breakdown, minimal absorption, and an 
inability of crossing the epithelial barriers. Protein engineering, 
solid-phase peptide synthesis, and ring-opening polymerization 
were used to insert the peptides into the nanostructures. 
Dipeptides, amphiphilic peptides, α-helical peptides, cyclic
peptides, and β-sheet peptides have all been employed as 
nanoparticulate self-assemblies. Peptide-based delivery systems, 
including those derived from synthetic and natural peptides,
have recently been employed to treat RA.
According to Zhou et al., a cationic amphipathic peptide 
generated from Mellitin combined with siRNA works as an 
efficient targeting agent for the NF-KB p65 subunit (p5RHH-p65). 
According to their findings, self-constructed p5RHH-p65 siRNA 
nanocomplexes serve as a safe delivery vehicle for siRNA that 
is meant to target and modulate inflammatory processes in the 
treatment of a variety of illnesses [36].
Shen et al. created an immunomodulatory peptide which 
targeted the T-cell receptor (TCR), which is crucial in immuno￾logical disorders like autoimmune arthritis. They employed the 
SCHOOL (signaling chain honi oligomerization) strategy and the 
SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence to target TCR. They discovered 
that peptide prevents bone and cartilage degradation and 
alleviates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice [37].
Rush et al. created cell-penetrating anti-inflammatory
peptide (KAFAK)-encapsulated degradable and non-degradable 
poly (NIPAm-AMPS) nanoparticles loaded with KAFAK that might 
become useful in the treatment of osteoarthritis [38]. The triad 
associating various advancements for RA therapy is depicted in 
Fig. 5.2.  
 
 
 
Nanotechnology for OA Therapy 189 
Figure 5.2 The triad associating various advancements for RA therapy. 
5.5 Nanotechnology for OA Therapy 
Sunscreens, cosmetics, textiles and sports equipment are a few 
examples of many areas of our daily lives where nanotechnology 
has proven to be extremely useful. Nanotechnology is also applied
in biomedicine, and some of these applications have reached 
the clinical stage. Drug delivery of therapeutics for OA is more 
advantageous by nanotechnology in four specific ways: 
1. Enhancing drug solubility and stability 
2. Improving the targeting and effective delivery of drug 
3. Increasing efficacy of drug and minimizing its adverse 
reactions 
4. Reducing medication dispersion and degradation in bodily 
fluids and increasing drug circulation and retention duration 
[39–41] 190 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
New concepts and techniques for treating OA have emerged as 
a result of the rapid development of nanotechnology in medication 
delivery systems in recent years. 
(a) Liposomes
A phospholipid bilayer surrounds an aqueous core spherical
vesicle called a liposome. The FDA’s first licensed nano drug
carrier, liposomes are regarded as the most optimal drug delivery 
mechanism [42]. Liposomal compositions have been used in
clinical practice in a variety of ways. Similarly, in Germany,
Lipotalon (dexamethasone palmitate) is used therapeutically for 
treating OA via intra-articular (IA) administration [43].
For the preservation of cartilage homeostasis, adenosine 
plays a crucial autocrine role. Adenosine has multiple receptor 
subtypes, including the A2A receptor [44]. Adenosine and an A2A
receptor agonist were originally combined into liposomes by 
Corciulo et al., who subsequently used interperitoneal injections 
of these liposomes to stop the progression of OA in both obesity￾induced OA in mice and post-traumatic OA in rats [45]. The findings 
imply that the A2A receptor is a useful target for the therapy of 
osteoarthritis. 
Rapamycin is a particular inhibitor of the rapamycin’s
mammalian target (mTOR). A potential therapeutic target for OA 
is mTOR. The PI3/Akt/ mTOR signaling cascade is how rapamycin 
potentially accomplishes its therapeutic benefits [46]. According 
to a recent study by Chen et al., IA administration of liposome￾encapsulated rapamycin significantly reduces inflammation in 
guinea pigs with spontaneous OA [47]. 
(b) Micelles
Micelles are amphiphilic nanoscale structures with a hydrophobic 
core and a hydrophilic exterior [48]. Polymeric micelles are 
the most popular type of micelles employed in drug delivery 
systems [49]. Block-copolymers with both hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic chains make up their structure. Polymeric micelles 
are more stable and have longer circulation duration than other 
micelles because of their low critical micelle concentration 
(CMC) [50]. The minimal amphiphilic concentration required  
 
Nanotechnology for OA Therapy 191 
for micelle production is known as the CMC. Poly ( β-amine ester) 
(PAE) is a cationic polymer with minimal cytotoxicity. By changing 
the ionization and deionization transition of the tertiary amine, 
pH can modify the hydrophobic/hydrophilic block transition of 
PAE [51]. By electrostatically interacting with cartilage GAGs, the 
positive charges of PAE are advantageous in drug delivery with 
a particular target [52]. Kang et al. designed an acid-activatable 
curcumin polymer (ACP), by using two characteristics of PAE 
which was covalently integrated with curcumin. In animal models 
of monoiodoacetic acid (MIA)-induced OA, the therapeutic benefits 
of ACP micelles were examined. The outcomes demonstrated that 
ACP micelles dramatically reduced TNF-α and IL-1β expression, 
protecting the articular cartilage against OA [53]. Micelles have 
various advantageous features including improved solubility 
of highly lipophilic medicines, allowing controlled drug release 
and tunable chemical and physical properties. However, they 
have several drawbacks such as non-encapsulating hydrophilic 
drugs, toxicity issues and dependence on CMC which need to be
overcome by modifying the micelles. 
(c) PNPs
PNPs comprise biocompatible and biodegradable synthetic
polymers as well as natural polymers such as alginate, albumin, 
chitosan, and others [54]. PNPs can assume two different structural 
forms: nanospheres and nanocapsules. While nanocapsules are 
nanostructures with a reservoir core and a polymeric membrane 
enclosing the medicine, nanospheres are constructed of a 
polymer matrix over which the drug is equally distributed [55].
PNPs are frequently employed in the field of nanomedicine
because they can be made comparatively easily as compared
to other NPs. PNPs often serve the following purposes for nano
drug delivery: 
(1) prolonging drug half-life 
(2) regulating drug release 
Important biological polymers called polyurethanes have 
urethane linkages in their main chains. These were initially
utilized commercially for biomedical reasons in 1960 [56]. Fan 192 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
et al. first synthesized amphiphilic polyurethane NPs with a 
pendant amino group, then formed a covalent bond between the 
polyurethane’s amine group and Khan’s carboxyl group to form
the polyurethane-KGN conjugate. According to the treatment 
outcomes in osteoarthritic rat models, intra-articular injection of 
polyurethane-KGN NPs might preserve more cartilage matrix and 
prevent the onset of osteoarthritis [57]. Nanocrystal technology, 
such as KGN, has the ability to deliver poorly soluble medicines 
with sizes between 100 to 1000 nm [58]. PNPs have a number of 
benefits, including better stability, the integration of hydrophilic
and hydrophobic pharmaceuticals and regulated drug release. 
However, they also have some disadvantages, such as inadequate 
drug loading and toxicity issues which are yet to be overcome. 
(d) Inorganic NPs
The human body contains three major antioxidant enzymes: 
peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) [59]. By 
scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), they mitigate the
harm brought on by oxidative stress. However, the activity of 
these endogenous enzymes gets lost easily due to the impact of 
the surrounding microenvironment, which includes proteases,
pH, temperature, and other factors. As a result, several studies
are being conducted on the production of nanozymes. A nanozyme 
is an example of an NP having activity like that of natural enzymes 
[60]. Because of their multi-enzymatic activity, inorganic NPs like 
as cerium oxide (CeO2), manganese dioxide (MnO2), platinum 
(Pt), and others have piqued the interest of researchers in the 
field of biomedicine. SOD, catalase, and peroxidase-like activities, 
for example, are mimicked by CeO2, Pt, and MnO2 nanoparticles,
whereas SOD and catalase-like activities are mimicked by SOD
and MnO2 nanoparticles.
Chloroplatinic acid and chondroitin sulfate were employed 
by Yin et al. to biosynthesize PtNPs that ranged in size from 3 to
5 nm. PtNPs are biocompatible with human OA chondrocytes 
up to an in vitro bioactivity investigation. The findings imply 
that PtNPs may be used for treating OA [61]. Inorganic NPs’ 
main problem is their toxicity, which is a result of inadequate 
toxicological evaluation in the literature. Therefore, it has become Nanotechnology for OA Therapy 193 
necessary to strengthen toxicology research in order to provide 
trustworthy experimental data for treating OA. 
(e) Dendrimers
Dendrimers are macromolecules that are repeatedly branched 
and have topological nanostructures and they resemble trees. 
Dendrimers are made up of three parts: core, branches, and 
shell. The shell provides the dendrimer’s outer surface, which 
can be used for conjugation with cargo or specific ligands. The 
cargo can be carried by the hydrophobic core. The number 
of generations contained in the structure of a dendrimer 
influences its size [62]. Dendrimers’ cargo payload efficiency,
monodispersity, and well-defined number of surface functional 
groups are all advantages as a drug delivery mechanism [63, 64]. 
The use of dendrimers has been studied extensively in pre-clinical 
literature. Dendrimers can be administered by intravenous, 
cutaneous, oral and other routes [65] as drug carriers. However, 
dendrimers are no longer researched as an OA treatment. 
Catabolism exceeding anabolism in chondrocytes is the cause 
of the deterioration of OA cartilage. The anabolic growth
factor insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has anti-inflammatory 
properties and encourages the manufacture of cartilage
matrix [66]. Geiger et al. [67] created cationic PEGylated PAMAM 
combined with IGF-1 for targeting OA anionic cartilage tissue. 
According to the in vivo investigation, through electrostatic 
interactions, PEGylated Dendrimer-IGF-1 successfully infiltrated 
the entire thickness of rat articular cartilage and prevented 
cartilage degeneration in rat models of medically induced 
osteoarthritis. For the development of novel drugs for OA therapy, 
the results of these studies were helpful. Dendrimers have a 
number of benefits, including the ability to increase the solubility
of hydrophobic drugs, and have tunable physicochemical
properties. However, they also have some drawbacks, including 
the inability to entrap hydrophilic drugs and cellular toxicity 
comparable to that of micelles. Multiple functional groups in the 
structure of dendrimers are one of its distinctive characteristics. 
Dendrimers are therefore thought of as potential drug delivery 
vehicles for specific drug delivery. 194 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
(f) Exosomes
Exosomes are defined as membrane-bound phospholipid bilayer 
vesicles which have diameters between 50 to 150 nm that 
develop from endosomes. Exosomes carry proteins that can move 
between cells, bioactive lipids and nucleic acids (mRNAs, DNAs
and micro RNAs, and Inc RNA) [68]. Almost all cell types, both 
diseased and normal cells, have the ability to produce exosomes. 
They are found in body fluids such as urine, saliva, blood, breast
milk, and synovial fluids in vivo. In vitro, they are found in the 
conditional medium of all different kinds of cells [69, 70]. MSCs
may be effective as a treatment for OA, according to numerous 
studies. MSC-secreted secret one and exosomes are mostly blamed 
for the consequences. Growth factors, hormones, cytokines and 
other proteins are all part of the MSC secretome [71]. Exosomal 
miRNAs and IncRNAs have recently been revealed to be essential 
for anti-OA efficacy. 
5.6 Functional Nanotherapeutic Strategies 
for OA 
Even though several nanomaterial-based medicines and 
nanotherapeutic techniques have been researched for the treatment 
of OA, and multiple clinical trials on nanotherapeutic approaches 
are now underway. The bulk of nanomedicines in clinical trials 
at present are non-functional nanoscale/microscale materials 
loaded with out-of-date pharmaceuticals for the treatment of OA 
that are already commercially accessible [72–74]. Wang et al. 
[75] claim that they predominantly increase medication retention
time while decreasing systemic diffusion. 
(a) Therapeutic strategies based on stimuli-responsive NPs
The agents of stimuli-responsive NPs are only released in response 
to a sufficient trigger or a set of predetermined circumstances. 
These types of nanocarriers with specific activities can be designed 
with help from disease-related local microenvironments like pH, 
temperature and oxidative stress or external stimuli like NIR 
light [76]. Zhao et al. reported the light-responsive dual functional 
biodegradable mesoporous silica NPs to treat OA. These particles Functional Nanotherapeutic Strategies for OA 195 
were made by supramolecular interactions b/w cyclodextrin￾modified poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (CD￾PMPC) and nonporous silica nanoparticles that had been modified 
with azobenzene [77]. For the treatment of OA to have a synergistic 
impact, the technique combining light-responsive local medication 
release with lubrication augmentation is necessary [78]. The 
isomerization of azobenzene, which can be activated by visible 
light, can be used to promote drug release after the nanoparticles 
have transversed the dermal tissue. Additionally, ND-Hb@siRNA@
PLGA-PEG (NHsPP), a photothermal-induced nitric nanogenerator 
in combination with siRNA, can inhibit macrophage inflammation 
by effective conversion of absorbed NIR light energy to enough
heat for activating the production of NO [79]. 
(b) Therapeutic strategies based on multifunctional NPs
An innovative method for increasing the effectiveness of therapy 
is the multifunctionalization of nanocarriers, which involves 
combining various functions into a single nanovehicle. This approach 
can enhance biological activity, targeted efficacy, for instance. 
Numerous different functional combinations, including targeted 
and stimuli-responsive nanotherapies, have also been researched 
for the treatment of OA [75]. OA therapy requires the targeted 
reduction of activated macrophage growth and the removal of high 
concentrations of ROS generated with the help of macrophages
[80, 81].
According to studies, ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) 
both have a substantial role in the onset and progression of OA. 
Antioxidants may therefore be useful in the treatment of OA [82]. 
Research on several antioxidants revealed that they are only
temporarily kept in the joint, like melatonin and N-acetylcystein
(NAC) [83, 84] The surface quinone residues of natural melanin 
shield the skin from ultraviolet (UV) light. Research into 
the antioxidant process of synthetic melanin nanoparticles
revealed that these substances may scavenge a wide range of
radicals [85, 86]. Dopamine melanin (DM) nanoparticles were 
studied by Zhong et al. to scavenge ROS and RNS for osteoarthritic 
treatment [87]. Following intra-articular injection, these 
Dopamine melanin nanoparticles remained at the injection site 
and showed a potent ability to scavenge ROS and RNS with a 196 Smart Targeted Novel Nanocarriers-Based Treatment of Arthritis 
minimal deleterious effect. On IL-1-induced chondrocytes, the 
DM nanoparticles had anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective 
properties. These nanoparticles mitigated the loss of proteoglycans 
and reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines when 
tested in vivo in an osteoarthritic model, which decreased cartilage 
deterioration. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrated that 
Dopamine melanin nanoparticles dramatically raised autophagy 
marker expression levels in IL-1-stimulated chondrocytes and 
promoted autophagy for chondrocyte protection, which aided in 
the management of OA [88]. 
5.7 Future Perspectives and Conclusion 
Physical therapy and psychological therapy are examples of
natural therapies that are now helpful in treating autoimmune 
inflammatory disorders like RA. Even though combinatorial 
medications have a higher response rate, selectivity and toxicity to 
healthy cells are significant issues. In addition to nanoparticulate 
formulations, the discovery of targeted inhibitors of pro￾inflammatory cytokines using monoclonal antibodies, bioactive 
peptides, and the delivery techniques based on siRNA may be 
the focus of future RA therapeutic alternatives. A more effective 
approach for creating formulations that particularly target pro￾inflammatory cytokines may be to focus on molecular biology and 
computational chemistry.
As a result of continued nanotechnological advancements 
and a growing understanding of the pathogenic mode of actions 
underlying OA, several nanoparticles have been widely researched 
in the treatment of OA and other disorders. The capacity of these 
drug delivery systems based on various nanoparticles to release 
drugs over an extended length of time, enhanced drug retention 
in joints, and higher therapeutic efficacy as a result of functional 
regulatory techniques are the primary advantages. These 
strategies can be used to reduce the therapeutic dose, as well as 
the administration frequency, pharmacological efficacy, and off￾target toxicity. Furthermore, as a result of the fast development 
and ongoing nanomaterials’ optimization, synthetic techniques,
and relative ligands, much more widespread problems such as 
stability of nanocarriers, satisfactory retention time, minor side

effects in tissues other than the target, and systemic biosafety may 
be addressed. Future nanotherapeutic treatments for OA will be 
more effective.

Because of numerous barriers like anatomical and physiological, 
ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been 
always associated with drawbacks. For example, apart from the 
cartilage, the cornea and crystalline lens are the only tissues
in the body that do not have blood supply. This has caused 
ophthalmologists to experience a bottleneck. When a mild 
ocular disease remains untreated or becomes severe, it has the 
potential to impair vision to the point of blindness in various 
ocular diseases like – corneal ulcer, dry eyes and posterior segment 
diseases, etc., whereas the traditional therapies are yet to deliver 
absolute therapy because of a number of constraints like poor 
bioavailability and because of blood-retinal barrier. Nowadays 
modern lifestyle has increased the prevalence of some ocular 
diseases. That is why a major focus of pharmaceutical scientists

www.jennystanford.com 206 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
is on developing appropriate medication delivery methods 
for ocular disorders. Thanks to nanoparticles like niosomes,
liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, and other polymeric vesicles, 
nanotechnology plays a significant role in ophthalmology and 
the ocular medicine delivery system. Niosomes, which are 
nanovesicles made of nonionic surfactants, are becoming
nanocarriers in drug delivery applications due to their solution/
strong stability and cost-effectiveness. So specifically, this review 
focuses on the importance of designing novel delivery systems
like nanomedicine applications, it offers various important
benefits such as prolonged medication release and targeted
tissue targeting. In this book, we discussed the development of 
various inorganic and organic nanoparticles for ocular applications, 
as well as unique approaches in the new ocular drug delivery 
system. 
6.1 Introduction
The human eye is a very complicated organ. It consists of two 
chambers—the anterior chamber and the posterior chamber—
and two segments—the anterior segment and the posterior
segment, which are highly prone to disease. If we talk about the 
most common anterior chamber disorders, those are dry eye, 
glaucoma, allergic conjunctivitis, uveitis, cataract and infections 
and if we talk about the most common and frequent posterior 
segment disorders, those are diabetic retinopathy (DR), age￾related macular degeneration (ARMD), etc. Earlier the topical 
instillation of medications was the recommended technique of 
therapy for the treatment of numerous ocular illnesses, since 
it is straightforward, convenient and noninvasive. Because of 
their ease of use, traditional eye drops are the most often used 
topical ophthalmic dose type [1, 2]. However, because of low
bioavailability and medication absorption into the ocular tissues 
as a consequence of turnover of tear, nasolacrimal drainage 
and blinking process, it is less effective in specific scenarios or
treatments [3]. For example, infections affecting the posterior 
portion of the eye are substantially more difficult to treat. Eye 
membranes hinder drug entry to the posterior portion, such as 
the cornea, conjunctiva and sclera; because of this, limited Introduction 207 
penetration further restricts the utility of the topical administration 
as a method for treating disorders affecting the retina, choroid or 
vitreous humor. These obstacles were taken into account when 
improving the topical ophthalmic dosage form’s efficacy [4–6]. 
Previous literature has concluded that therapeutic substances 
are difficult to distribute due to the structure of the eye. Because 
of the barriers like blood-retinal barriers (BRB), the eye is resistant 
to foreign material exposure, and pharmaceutical agents trying 
to reach the intended ocular tissues [7, 8]. A barrier like BRB
is made up of an inner and outer barrier. Because of the tight 
connections, the retinal vascular endothelium, the iris vascular 
epithelium and the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium keep
the blood-retinal barrier in place, which is very necessary for 
sustaining the homoeostasis of the retina [9]. However, the outer 
part of BRB consists of functional complexes of retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) and pigment epithelial cells of the pars plana. 
Whereas the inner segment is made up of the tight connections 
between the endothelial cells of the retinal capillaries.
There is very less molecular convection as the blood￾retinal barrier lacks cellular components and it is preferentially 
permeable to more lipophilic molecules [10]. As a result, systemic 
drug administration is very critical for treating posterior segment 
diseases, only 1% to 2% of injected drug reaches the vitreous 
cavity; that is why massive doses of the medicine must be 
administered, resulting in a slew of systemic adverse effects 
[11–14]. So intravitreous injections are a good way to boost 
medication bioavailability in this eye segment [15–18].
However, problems linked with this method of administration 
include retinal detachment. Endophthalmitis and intravitreous 
hemorrhages [19]. For overcoming these difficulties, we can use 
topical medicine distribution if the therapeutic window could 
be achieved and also maintained for an extended period of time. 
However, developing an effective topical dosage from that can 
deliver the medicine at the precise amount without requiring 
frequent instillation is a huge issue for pharmaceutical science 
and technology. The development of medication delivery methods 
that do not require large dosage or repeated administrations is
an essential technique for treating illness affecting the front part
of the eye, Although several recent studies have emphasized 208 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
different delivery methods, particularly these evaluations do 
not focus on the both eye segments, nanoparticle systems, 
which aims to boost the drugs delivery to both segments of the 
eye [4, 20–26]. Whereas traditional topical ocular therapies 
have substantial drawbacks, currently one approach is to 
use nanotechnology in the production process. Nanomicelles 
are nanoparticle-based ocular medication delivery systems.
nanoparticles such as niosomes, liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, 
and other polymeric vesicles. Because of their solution/strong 
stability and cost-effectiveness, niosomes, which are nanovesicles 
consisting of nonionic surfactants, are becoming nanocarriers 
in drug delivery applications [2]. 
6.2 Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug 
Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the 
Eye 
6.2.1 Traditional System of Delivery of Drug and 
Drawbacks to the “Anterior Segment of the Eye” 
6.2.1.1 Topical eye drop solutions
Traditional eye drops solutions are patient-friendly, instant￾acting and also a noninvasive pharmaceutical formulation. The 
traditional method of delivering eye drop solutions to the cornea
and conjunctiva involves delivering them via a cul-de-sac, 
followed by rapid first-order absorption. Modifying the drug 
characteristics or the qualities of the drug delivery device can 
boost drug penetration and bioavailability [25]. Because to reflux 
blinking or nasolacrimal drainage, the majority of the topically 
applied dosage, regardless of the amount injected, is quickly lost 
during the first 6 min after delivery. Just 20% (roughly 7 L) of 
the fluid is maintained in the conjunctival pocket, with only 1 to 
3% reaching the intraocular tissue [1, 27–30]. Traditionally eye 
drops in the form of solutions, suspensions and emulsions have 
been utilized for treating diseases those are related to anterior
segments. The prodrug technique little bit alters the drug’s 
physiochemical characteristics to improve absorption via passive
or active diffusion [31]. Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the Eye 209 
6.2.1.2 Suspensions
Routine ocular suspensions are usually insoluble drug dispersion
in an aqueous medium that contains dispersing and solubilizing 
agents. The precorneal cavity keeps drug particles suspended, 
extending the medication’s contact duration. The time it takes for 
drug molecules to diffuse into corneal tissue is regulated by drug 
particle size, which influences drug bioavailability. Alcon, Inc’s
Tobra-Dex ST is a suspension containing (0.3%) tobramycin
and (0.05%) dexamethasone for ocular infections caused by 
bacteria [20]. They transport the medicines as a dispersion in an 
aqueous solvent. In suspensions, particles are maintained within 
the conjunctival pocket, and their size determines the effect’s 
duration [28, 32–34]. The active pharmaceutical ingredients were 
shown to be more concentrated in tissues and more effective 
against Staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa
[35–37]. 
6.2.1.3 Emulsions
Routine ophthalmic emulsions can increase the bioavailability
and solubility of water-insoluble medicines. The two most prevalent 
varieties of pharmaceutical emulsions are “water in oil” (w/o) and 
“oil in water” (o/w) [20]. When applied to the vitreous, retina, and 
choroid of rabbit eyes following not only one but multiple topical 
drop instillations, [3H]-difluprednate, a prednisolone derivate,
can treat anterior ocular inflammation [1, 38, 39]. 
6.2.1.4 Ointments
Ophthalmic ointments are a topical carrier system with improved 
bioavailability and long-term drug release. In this case, they are 
composed of hydrocarbon molecules (paraffins) that are solid 
and semisolid with a melting point of 340°C (the physiological 
ocular temperature) [1]. Ointments are widely tolerated, 
relatively safe and a great way to extend ocular contact duration. 
Improved contact time increases ocular medication levels in the 
case of some antibiotics. Ophthalmic ointments should not be 
used on open sores in the eyes. Ointment instillation into 
postoperative eyes with a tight wound closure appears to be safe 
and beneficial [40]. 210 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
6.2.2 Traditional Drug Delivery System and Drawbacks 
to the “Posterior Segment of the Eye”:
6.2.2.1 Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents
Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatments are 
administered intravitreally to treat a number of retinal illnesses, 
such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, 
retinal vascular occlusions, and retinopathy of prematurity
[41, 42]. Apart from regulating angiogenesis, VEGF (vascular
endothelial growth factor) is a survival factor for endothelial 
cells, causing abnormal blood vessel phenotypes in wet age￾related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema 
(DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Angiogenesis and 
neovascularization cause slow and persistent central vision 
distortion and blurring, affecting the quality of life significantly.
Many individuals with this illness have improved their quality
of life—a result of anti-VEGF therapy and knowledge of VEGF’s 
important role in angiogenesis [43, 44]. Aflibercept and 
ranibizumab are two kinds of VEGF inhibitors that have been 
authorized, and the number of IVIs done each year has grown 
dramatically. Endophthalmitis is the most significant consequence 
following IVI. It is uncommon, with a rate ranging from 0.01 to 
0.26% [45, 46]. Several investigations in recent years have
found negative effects ranging from increased intraocular pressure 
to visually unpleasant silicone oil vesicles in the vitreous cavity, 
because of very long-term use of anti-VEGF drugs, and a greater 
number of injections worldwide several investigations have 
discovered that the medication, as well as its manufacture, storage, 
environmental factors, and syringe material and design, all have 
a major impact on these side effects [47–50]. 
6.2.3 Other Ocular Drug Delivery Technologies
For overcoming the limitations associated with conventional 
formulations, novel techniques for ocular medication administration 
are now being explored and developed (such as other systemic 
complications because of increased systemic API availability 
following chronic administration and adverse reactions induced 
by preservatives) [1, 51]. Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the Eye 211 
6.2.3.1 Contact lens
Multiple studies have found that immersing soft contact lenses 
in a pharmaceutical solution increases the length of drug
interaction with ocular tissues all the way across the cornea. It 
also increases the drug’s absorption while decreasing its loss 
through lacrimal drainage [52–55]. The lenses were immersed 
in a 1% homatroine aqueous solution, causing patient’s pupils 
to dilate completely for a longer period than eye drop alone. 
Vistakon pharmaceuticals conducted a study to explore if a pre￾soaked contact lens that produced ketotifen, an antihistamine, 
could be effective medication, after application may prevent
allergic conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers [56, 57]. When 
dexamethasone was released through contact lenses, it had a 
greater bioavailability than when it was released from eye
drops. According to Kim et al., contact lenses that include liposomes 
or disperse pharmaceuticals into micelles have been created to 
selectively release medications into the eye based on specified 
variables such as pH or temperature. This method efficiently 
eliminates medication loss during storage while also ensuring 
focused drug administration to the eye [58–61].
In the case of timolol, molecularly imprinted contact lenses 
demonstrated increased drug-loading capacity and also extended 
drug administration [62]. Piggyback contact lenses with ion 
ligand-containing polymeric hydrogels and drug plate or drug
solution combinations are also being investigated [63, 64]. Hence
the new technology can deliver hours to days of medication 
release. Drug-eluting contact lenses have been proved to be safe
and efficacious in vivo and clinical studies, with significant
advantages over eye drops. Although the future seems bright, 
some obstacles remain, including processing and storage concerns, 
regulatory impediments, costly clinical study costs, probable
lack of acceptability by the elderly, and so on [52, 62–67]. 
6.2.3.2 Ocular inserts
Ophthalmic inserts are specific sizes and forms of sterile 
preparations having a solid or semisolid consistency for use in 
the eyes. The drugs contained in the polymeric support of ocuserts 212 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
can be used topically or systemically to treat the eyes. The primary 
goal of using ophthalmic inserts is to increase the active form
of a drug’s retention duration in the eye, resulting in a more 
consistent release [68–71]. Ocular inserts were created to satisfy
the growing number of patients who require therapy with the 
fewest possible adverse effects. Ocuserts decreased the number 
of doses administered, resulting in improved patient compliance. 
It increases bioavailability by extending contact time. Systemic
side effects can be decreased, which reduces undesirable 
consequences. Preservatives are not allowed, lowering the 
likelihood of allergic responses. Ocular implants are made in a 
variety of ways and may be assessed using a variety of metrics. 
Ocuserts are emerging ways in the era of ocular medication 
delivery [71]. Patient noncompliance with these inserts is 
widespread, resulting in symptoms such as foreign body sensations 
in the eye, difficulties with self-insertions, and the impression
that the insert has been lost from the eye. To make ocular 
inserts soluble, erodible and hydrogel-like, many methods are 
applied [72]. 
6.2.3.3 Punctal plugs
Punctal plugs have been used to enhance retention duration and 
hence the absorption of eye drops by blocking the nasolacrimal 
drainage system. A decrease in the intraocular pressure of around 
2 mmHg was found in the plugged eye when compared with 
unplugged eye following routine topical instillation of ocular 
hypotensive eye drops [73]. Punctal plugs are useful not only for 
treating aqueous-deficient dry eye but also for treating a range 
of other ocular surface disorders, where they act as therapeutic 
adjuvants. They may now be utilized in most cases thanks to 
new versions that have been created to increase tolerance and 
efficacy. Each model has its own safety profile, which the 
prescriber must be aware of. Because late issues are conceivable, 
long-term monitoring is required. Hence, punctal plugs obliterate 
the lacrimal punctum completely. At the slit light, they are visible 
and easily separable. They have a low probability of migrating 
into the lacrimal channels but a high probability of extrusion loss. 
Punctal plugs have been designed in a variety of ways to improve 
their efficacy and reduce problems [74–77]. Canalicular plugs Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the Eye 213 
have the following major disadvantages: (i) difficulty in seeing
them and determining their placement. (ii) difficulty in removing 
them, and (iii) greater risk of canaliculitis [77]. Patients who are 
allergic to plug material or who have blockage of the lacrimal
canals, ectropion, or an active ocular infection should not use 
punctal or canalicular plugs (conjunctivitis and keratitis).
Very severe ocular surface conditions and lid irritation such as 
blepharitis must be treated before putting punctal plugs [78]. 
6.2.3.4 Episcleral implants
Transscleral administration has been found to be an effective 
approach to attaining therapeutic medication concentrations 
in the posterior region of the eye [79, 80]. For example, LX201
is an episcleral implant consisting of a silicone matrix that 
provides possibly therapeutic cyclosporine dosage to the lacrimal
gland on a continuous basis in preclinical studies with rabbits 
and dogs [81, 82]. A subconjunctival insert was developed by 
Pfizer, Inc. of a poly tube with a latanoprost core. The active
pharmaceutical component is released through the permeable 
end of the tube after 3 to 6 months. The release rate is 
controlled by the PGLA tube’s internal diameter [27, 83]. MEMS 
(Microelectromechanical Systems) are devices for drug delivery 
made of parylene (“biocompatible and flexible”) that are 
implanted in the subconjunctival area and connected to a cannula 
via an incision in the anterior or posterior segments of the eye. 
Electrolysis (powered by a battery and wireless inductive 
power transmission) creates pressure inside the reservoir, 
forcing the medication through the cannula as water is 
electrochemically converted into hydrogen and oxygen gas. This 
enables the exact administration of the required dose volume, 
addressing the limitations of the previous generation of manually 
controlled MEMS, which includes fluctuations in drug release 
time and depressing force. The MEMS device enables medication 
solution replenishment, allowing for long-term drug therapy and 
avoiding several operations. After three months, no problems 
were identified in a trial employing subconjunctival device 
implantation, highlighting the safety of this method. Furthermore, 
utilising travoprost-loaded MEMS devices, a constant drop
in intraocular pressure (IOP) was obtained in dogs for up to 214 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
8 hours. MEMS medicine delivery devices are investigated for
the treatment of chronic and resistant eye diseases such as 
glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration [27]. To address 
these problems, several tactics can be applied, such as tailoring 
a basic material’s properties using molecules. The creation of
unique forms that depart from conventional geometry and 
permit the use of bigger surface areas on devices, the application 
of novel technologies to fit new designs, and the use of previously 
undiscovered materials with the potential to create ocular 
implants [84]. 
6.2.4 Nanotechnology: Recent Approach for Ocular 
Drug Delivery Systems 
“Combining science and technology, nanotechnology allows for
the modification of properties and structures at the nanoscale
(1 to 100 nm)”. There are many applications of nanotechnology 
like science as well as clinical medicine, diagnostics and disease 
management those have an ability to control molecules at such 
a microscopic level [85]. Nanotechnology has been employed 
in medicine delivery systems to treat ocular disorders since the 
1980s. For increasing the retention period, better interaction 
with ocular mucosa of the associated drug and as well as for 
increasing its permeability across the epithelium of conjunctiva
and cornea the nanocarriers have been discovered recently. 
Nanodrug delivery and nanotherapies are introduced to treat 
some of the most common ocular conditions like infections, 
inflammation, glaucoma, dry eyes and retinopathies [86].
Nanoparticles, both organic and inorganic, are a fresh approach 
to meeting unmet therapeutic needs, notably in the ocular sector,
by altering and boosting medicine delivery [85]. As a result of
that till now several nanoparticles have been discovered and 
developed, like “lipid-based nanoparticles, nanosuspensions,
nanoemulsion and metal-based nanoparticles”. In this review, 
we will focus on the advances in nanocarrier-based drug delivery 
systems. We will also cover new issues and an overview of 
future trends of nano-based ocular drug delivery systems and 
strategies in ophthalmology, with the goal of eventually providing 
practical applications for treating ocular illness [87]. Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the Eye 215 
6.2.5 Ocular Medication Delivery System Based on 
Nanotechnology:
6.2.5.1 Organic nanoparticles
Examples of nanocarriers include liposomes, niosome, dendrimers, 
solid lipid nanoparticles, polymers, and protein/peptide-based 
nanoparticles. Made of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other 
organic materials, organic nanoparticles seem to have a number 
of medical advantages [88]. The potential organic and inorganic 
nanoparticles for ophthalmic drug delivery are depicted in 
Fig. 6.1. 
6.2.5.2 ‘Liposomes’
Liposomes are a new approach in new drug delivery systems that 
are nonirritating to the eye and also have a long retention time on 
the ocular surface, providing greater efficacy and bioavailability. 
Liposome-based methods for ocular medication administration 
are advantageous because they can entrap both hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic medications and deliver them to both the anterior and 
posterior portions of the eye [89]. Liposomes are lipid vesicles 
composed of one or more phospholipid bilayers encircling an 
aqueous core and having sizes from 0.08 to 10.00 m. Liposomes
are divided into tiny unilamellar vesicles with diameters of 100 
to 300 nm, and multilamellar vesicles with more than a single 
phospholipid bilayer [1, 90]. The positive charge of liposomes can 
increase corneal drug permeability, existing drug release. Li et al.
created formulations like diclofenac sodium-loaded with low￾molecular-weight chitosan (LCH) coating. The findings revealed 
a little increase in particle size with prolonged drug release, the 
stability test findings were satisfactory, and the preservation 
and penetration of LCH-coated liposomes across the cornea 
were improved [90, 91]. Other studies also found there was 
no eye irritation or toxicity and investigated the therapeutic 
impact of liposome formulation for delivering latanoprost by 
subconjunctival injection to treat glaucoma. In the subconjunctival 
area, the liposomal formulation improved medication targeting 
and sustainability. Furthermore, compared to traditional topical 216 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
Figure 6.1 The potential organic and inorganic nanoparticles for ophthalmic drug delivery [88]. Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the Eye 217 
eyedrops, latanoprost-encapsulated liposomes showed a 50-day 
decrease in the IOP in the rabbit eye [92, 93]. Tears again® is a spray 
that treats dry eye disease with phospholipid liposomes [94, 95].
Endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment 
are among the side effects associated with intravitreal instillation, 
since liposomes offer targeted medication administration at the
site of action and overcome the limitation in terms of bioavailability 
[96]. In another research, Vallejo et al. utilized triamcinolone 
acetonide-loaded liposomes for vitreous cavity and retina 
injection in the rabbit eye, there was no increase in intraocular 
pressure [97]. 
6.2.5.3 Niosomes
Many studies and pharmaceutical companies are looking into 
niosomes as bi/multi-layer nanoparticles for a number of 
applications. Some important studies look for the best ways of drug 
encapsulation as well as drug/protein loading and release kinetics. 
Because they can increase bioavailability and effectiveness and 
treat serious illnesses like cancer, researchers are interested in 
using niosomal drug delivery systems to treat severe inflammations 
[98, 99]. Niosomes, which are nanovesicles made of nonionic 
surfactants, are becoming nanocarriers for drug administration 
due to their cost-effectiveness and solution/storage stability. They 
are also biocompatible, biodegradable, have a flexible shape, and 
can hold both hydrophobic and hydrophilic medicines. Niosomes 
are attractive nanocarriers in the treatment of eye disorders 
because of their features [100]. Currently, niosomes are being 
studied for glaucoma therapy as a drug delivery vehicle, because 
of several benefits like no need for frequent administration, 
longer intraocular-pressure-lowering efficacy, very high corneal 
permeability and very few ocular toxicities currently niosomal 
drug delivery becoming popular. “Aggarwal and Kaur synthesized 
timolol maleate using reverse phase evaporation (REV), ether 
injection, and film hydration techniques” (a water-soluble 
medication used to treat open-angle glaucoma) encapsulated 
chitosan or carbopol-coated niosome formulations [101]. Due to 
the production of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) that could 
effectively encapsulate a water-soluble medication in large 218 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
numbers, niosomes made using the REV technique showed the 
highest ratio of entrapment efficacy when compared to others. 
Compared to carbopol-coated niosomal formulations, chitosan￾coated formulations showed superior control over IOP [102]. 
Recently Hashim et al. demonstrated the potential of niosomal in 
situ gel as an ocular delivery vehicle for atenolol, a 1 adrenoceptor 
blocker, for treating glaucoma. To produce niosomes with different 
Span 60 and cholesterol molar ratios, the thin film-hydration (TFH)
methodology was employed. The produced niosomes’ highest 
entrapment efficiency (EE percent) was 80.7%. When niosomes 
were introduced into the in situ gel, they enhanced drug release 
and IOP-lowering activity by more than 8 h, suggesting that 
niosomal in situ gel had the longest drug release and IOP-lowering 
activity [103]. Abdelkader and coworkers set out to create and 
test niosomes based on Span 60 for naltrexone topical application 
(NTX). Dicetyl phosphate (DCP) and stearyl amine (STA) were 
investigated as bilayer membrane additives in four different ways. 
They placed niosomal formulations on the surface of 10-day-old 
chicken’s chorioallantoic membrane they found no irritation. 
NTX’s ocular permeability was enhanced by modulating its release 
from a niosomal formulation [104]. When in another study they 
used solvent injection to make chitosan-coated Span 60 niosomes 
containing gatifloxacin, an ocular drug for treating bacterial eye 
infections. No toxicity was deducted and the drug transition 
through the cornea was greatly improved when chitosan-coated 
niosomes were compared to untreated niosomes [105]. Utilizing
tween 80 as a surfactant, cationic lipid 2,3-di(tetradecycloxy)propan￾1-amine as an additive, and cationic lipid 2,3-di(tetradecycloxy)
propan-1-amine as an additive, a formulation was created using 
the pCMS-EGFP plasmid. An original cationic niosome was created 
by Puras and colleagues for the delivery of retinal genes. The 
pCMS-EGFP plasmid was used for formulation through O/W (oil 
in water) emulsification. Tween 80 was employed as a surfactant, 
2,3-di(tetradecycloxy)propan-1-amine and squalene were used 
as cationic lipids, and other ingredients included cationic lipids. 
To assess the efficacy and internalization process of transfections 
in HEK-293 and ARPE-19 cells, as well as in rats following 
injection into the retina, researchers have carried out in vitro Revolution from Traditional to Nanodrug Delivery System in Delivery of Drugs to the Eye 219 
and in vivo studies. Nioplexes showed better cell survival than 
Lipofectamine 2000; however, they performed less effectively 
during transfection. Depending on the delivery method, subretinal 
injections have been shown to successfully transfect RPE in vivo 
[106]. Rat retinas have been used to examine the impact of a 
nonionic surfactant on the efficiency of niosome transfection. Three 
niosome formulations were made, each of which differed only in 
terms of nonionic tensioactives. Niosomes contained beneficial 
lipids including squalene and polysorbate 20 or 85 in addition to 
1,2-di-octadecenyl-3-trimethyl-ammonium propane (DOTMA).
Consequently, polysorbate 20 niosome-based nioplexes were more 
effective in vitro at transfecting ARPE-19 retinal cells. Further, 
because the transgenes were administered intravitreal and 
subretinal, substantial levels of transgene expression were seen in 
the retinas of rats. Consequently, this formulation stands out as a 
potential nonviral candidate for efficiently transferring particular 
therapeutic genes [107]. In 2017, Paradkar et al. created and tested 
a natamycin-loaded niosomal in situ gel for ocular medication 
delivery in the treatment of fungal keratitis. Niosome formulations 
had a high EE (>65 and gel niosome formulations extended drug 
release to 24 h with greater corneal penetration [108]. 
For the treatment of keratitis, niosomes containing
voriconazole were mixed into gelling ocular implants. Surfactants 
were used to make the niosomes such as Span 60 and Span
40 using pluronic L64 and F127. EE was found to be greater than 
49% in the formulations produced. The drug release of niosomes
and niosomal gel formulations was further extended by up to 
8 h using niosomes [109]. As nanocarriers, niosomes are available 
in a variety of sizes, ranging from micrometers to nanometers. 
By enhancing corneal permeability, increasing ocular bio￾availability, and ensuring longer drug release, niosomes deliver 
medications and genes to the front and back of the eye.
Furthermore, niosomes can be embedded in gels or covered 
with mucoadhesive polymers such as carbopol, chitosan to 
enhance their benefits [102, 110–112]. Niosomes have greater 
chemical stability and are more widely distributed on the eye’s 
surface, thus offering excellent bioavailability compared to other 
nanostructures used in ocular drug delivery formulations [23]. 220 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
Niosomes have a higher penetration rate than the others. 
Niosomes and liposomes have comparable structural properties; 
however, niosomes are formed of more stable materials [113]. 
6.2.5.4 Solid lipid nanoparticles
To increase medication absorption, solid lipid nanoparticles 
(SLNs) are commonly used as topical carriers. SLNs were created 
using high-speed stirring and the ultrasonication process. As a 
result of solubility experiments, stearic acid was selected as the 
lipid former, Tween 80 as the surfactant, and Transcutol P as 
the cosurfactant. Clarithromycin-loaded SLN was optimized using 
fractional factorial screening and 32 complete factorial designs.
The morphology, penetration, irritation, and ocular 
pharmacokinetics of stable SLNs (CL10) were studied in 
rabbits [114]. Because they have the capacity to improve ocular
absorption and hence improve bioavailability along with 
prolonged and regulate drug release characteristics for lipophilic 
and hydrophilic drugs, SLNs have recently gained a lot of interest 
as possible candidates for drug delivery to ocular surfaces 
[115, 116]. Solid lipid nanoparticles for the application of 
tobramycin were researched by Cavalli et al., topically applied 
to New Zealand albino rabbits, the formulation demonstrated 
improved ocular bioavailability and extended preocular
drug retention [117]. Using synthesized SNL coupled with a 
phospholipid and a homolipid produced from goat fat, Attama
et al. studied the ocular penetration and sustained release impact 
of diclofenac sodium. Diclofenac penetration tests in cell culture 
through a human cornea construct demonstrated an increase in 
cornea permeability capabilities when drugs were loaded with 
SNL [118]. 
6.3 Polymeric Nanoparticles
These monomers can take any shape as long as they share two 
reactive functional groups with another monomer. By selecting 
the suitable monomer/s, a polymer with certain properties might 
be formed. Polymers are not only a one-of-a-kind material that 
can have all of the aforementioned characteristics, but their great Dendrimers 221 
synthetic flexibility also allows researchers to modify them to
their specific demands or aims. To obtain specific properties, 
polymeric tailoring might be performed directly on biopolymers
by chemical derivatization [119, 120]. Another option is to 
synthesize polymers from monomers, which can result in a broad 
range of structures and uses [121–124]. Polymeric materials are 
becoming increasingly relevant in nanotechnology. Surfactants
may be necessary for the preparation of polymeric NPs. The 
combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules produces 
nonionic surfactants with amphiphilic characteristics [125].
Because they have the capability to entrap hydrophilic/hydrophobic 
drug molecules with delayed drug release, poly(lactic-co-glycolic 
acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, a biodegradable copolymer, have 
been employed in ocular drug delivery [126]. Cerium oxide 
nanoparticles encapsulated in glycol chitosan were used to study 
dry eye conditions. According to a study, the drug can infiltrate 
corneal and conjunctival cells and increase SOD2 expression [127]. 
During in vivo investigations, Sharma et al. observed that chloro 
trimethyl-ammonium methyl methacrylate (Eudragit RS 100/RL 
100) polymeric nanoparticles with amikacin sulfate formulation 
caused strong corneal adhesion, leading in higher drug retention 
and drug controlled release efficiency [128]. Li et al. conducted 
another significant contribution to the field on the effectiveness of 
combining hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP–CD) and PLGA 
(PLGA) nanoparticles for triamcinolone acetonide encapsulation 
in ocular application. Drug-loaded PLGA with hydroxypropyl-beta￾cyclodextrin (HP–CD) nanoparticles released medications faster
than drug-loaded PLGA without-CD solution, according to in 
vitro drug release experiments. Furthermore, increasing drug 
concentration in the aqueous humor was correlated with 
enhanced drug penetration of HP–CD/PLGA in the trans corneal 
location, indicating that an HP–CD/PLGA nanoparticle-loaded 
triamcinolone acetonide eye drop formulation might be a feasible 
choice [129]. 
6.4 Dendrimers
Dendrimers are monodisperse macromolecules with logically
defined sizes and a molecular structure made of three primary 222 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
components: (i) an inner core within the dendrimer’s central 
molecule, (ii) a highly branching unit termed generation that 
links to the core, and (iii) an exterior surface with many valent 
functional groups [130]. The pharmaceutical industry is interested 
in dendrimers because of their tree-like branching structure with 
many covalent connections, which allows them to attach several 
functional groups, including medications, within dendrimers 
and conjugate them to the surface via covalent bonds. Their 
advantages include hydrophilic or lipophilic qualities that provide 
control insolubility, and dendrimers, which can entrap tiny 
drug molecules inside their branches due to their global shape 
[131, 132].
Polycationic polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers have 
been proven to be cytotoxic, with toxicity rising with generation; 
however, hydroxy-terminated G4 PAMAM dendrimers are expected 
to be harmless due to their near-neutral surface charge, which 
lowers nonspecific retention and interactions in tissues [133]. 
PAMAM dendrimers with a primary amine and carboxylate surface 
groups were employed in another investigation to boost drug 
corneal penetration and characteristics during in vitro release. 
Puerarin medication administration was effectively evaluated 
on the albino rabbit model for ocular hypertension and cataracts 
glaucoma treatment using a dendrimer-based formulation [134]. 
Dendrimer conjugated ODN-1 was found to considerably slow the 
growth of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), with no negative side
effects detected during the trial [135]. Because of their numerous 
benefits, dendrimer compositions have the potential to increase
the efficacy of ophthalmic medications. 
6.5 Nanosuspensions
Nanosuspensions are part of nanotechnology. Many of the drug 
possibilities have low water solubility. The use of medicine 
nanosuspension is a universal formulation strategy for increasing 
the therapeutic efficacy of these medications in any route of 
administration. A pharmaceutical nanosuspension is defined as
very finely colloid, biphasic, dispersed, solid drug particles in an 
aqueous vehicle, size less than 1 m, without any matrix material, Nanoemulsion 223 
stabilized by surfactants and polymers, prepared by suitable
methods for Drug Delivery applications, and administered via 
various routes such as oral, topical, parenteral, ocular, and 
pulmonary [136]. Nanosuspensions might be useful for drugs that 
are poorly soluble in lachrymal fluids. Nanosuspensions are an
ideal alternative for the ocular distribution of hydrophobic
medications due to their inherent ability to enhance pharmaceutical 
saturation solubility. The medication’s nanoparticulate shape 
permits it to remain in the cul-de-sac for a longer length of time, 
allowing for continuous drug release [137]. Pignatello et al. created 
eudragit delay cloricromene nanosuspensions for intraocular 
injection [138]. A previous research has found that the topical 
administration of an ibuprofen sodium salt (IBU) sodium salt-coated 
chloro trimethyl-ammonium methyl methacrylate nanosuspension 
(Eudragit RS 100) polymer improved penetration to the anterior 
segment of the eye, extended drug release, and increased drug 
level in the aqueous humor [139]. Some glucocorticoids, such as 
dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone, used topically
to treat eye irritation, have been nanoformulated, resulting in 
longer drug absorption and enhanced drug bioavailability in 
ocular drug delivery, minimizing the need for frequent drug 
administration [140, 141]. 
6.6 Nanoemulsion
Cationic nanoemulsions can be utilized topically to deliver active 
compounds to the eye. Over the previous decade, Novagali Pharma 
has successfully developed and released Novasorb, a complex
pharmaceutical technology for the treatment of eye disorders [142]. 
Because of their multiple benefits, including prolonged activity 
and efficient drug penetration into the deeper layers of the ocular 
structure and the aqueous humor, dilutable nanoemulsions are 
useful drug delivery vehicles for ophthalmic application [143]. 
Droplets’ tiny size provides a wide surface area, which has the 
potential to increase ophthalmic medicine delivery effectiveness 
by enhancing ocular permeability and bioavailability [144]. The 
low surface tension of nanoemulsions is hypothesized to allow for 
improved medicine distribution on the cornea and mixing with 
the precorneal contents. This increases the amount of time the 224 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
medicine is in contact with the corneal epithelium [145]. Ismail 
et al. discovered that the antiglaucoma medicine dorzolamide 
hydrochloride nanoemulsion showed excellent results in ocular 
treatment. The pharmacological formulation produced a long￾lasting impact with an early beginning of action, eliminating 
the requirement for recurrent administration of eye drops
[146]. Mahboobian et al. assessed the absorption of acyclovir
nanoemulsion in the bovine cornea after trans corneal permeation 
in a clinical study. The results demonstrated better acyclovir 
permeability across the corneal membrane cells and no irritation 
in the rabbit eye, indicating that the formulation is safe for
treating ocular infection [147].

6.7 Inorganic Nanoparticles
The most prevalent inorganic nanoparticles are metallic 
nanoparticles and quantum dots. Metallic nanoparticles have Gold NPs 225 
sparked a lot of attention since Faraday revealed that they can 
survive in solution over a decade ago [35]. Metal nanoparticles, 
metal oxide nanoparticles, doped metal–metal/oxide–metal
nanoparticles, metal sulfide, and metal–organic frameworks are
the four families. Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) such as silver (Ag), 
gold (Au), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), platinum 
(Pt), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) have been studied in numerous 
fields and have proven to be effective, stable drug delivery
platforms with fewer side effects, as well as potent imaging
probes. Single metals with better characteristics were discovered
to be less hazardous than doped metallic nanoparticles, such 
as ZnO doped with Co.60.61. Metals like cerium oxide (CeO2)
nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles have shown potential
antioxidant properties in the ocular medicine and gene delivery 
sectors, with a high safety profile following eye administration
and significant antioxidant activity. 
6.8 Gold NPs (AuNPs)
Several studies are being undertaken to enhance ophthalmology 
diagnosis and therapy. Indeed, 285 million individuals worldwide 
suffer from visual acuity issues, and several ways to improve 
patient treatment are being researched. One of these alternatives 
is to employ gold nanoparticles (GNP), which have a wide range 
of properties and may be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic 
purposes [153]. 
In previous studies rod-shaped particles were found to 
be less biocompatible than 50 and 100 nm spheres and cubes, 
which showed minimal cytotoxicity and excellent internalization 
[154]. Dong et al. demonstrated that giving streptozotocin￾induced diabetic rats resveratrol-coated AuNPs with a median 
size of 20 nm and dosages of 200–300 mg/kg for 3 months 
may protect against diabetic retinopathy. The inhibitory effects 
of the ERK1/2 pathway and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kb) 
expression in diabetic rats, which may reduce inflammation 
and permeability of the blood-retinal barrier, may aid in 
restoring the balance of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors.

Figure 6.2 Illustration of the uses of the GNP in ophthalmology [153]. 
Furthermore, VEGF-1, TNF, and IL-6 mRNA expression in the 
retina was significantly decreased [155]. VEGF-induced RF/6A 
cell migration in choroid-retina endothelial (RF/6A) cells was 
substantially suppressed by AuNPs of 3–5 nm via the Akt/eNOS 
pathways. They found no cytotoxic effects on AuNPS on RF/6A 
or negative effects on normal physiological cell attachment to 
fibronectin in their cell viability and cell adhesion assays [156].
According to Kim et al., the passage of AuNPs of 20 nm increased 
cell mortality compared to cells lacking NPs enhances the 
possibility of future therapeutic studies [157]. 
6.9 Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) 
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a well-known nanotechnology
product, have generated attention as a nanomedicine in recent 
years due to their unique properties and numerous therapeutic  
 
 
 
 
Silver Nanoparticles 227 
uses [158]. Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, believed 
silver powder had medicinal powers and recommended it as 
an ulcer treatment. Prior to the discovery of sulfadiazine cream 
in the nineteenth century, weak solutions of silver nitrate were 
used to treat infections. Before the discovery of sulfadiazine 
cream, weak silver nitrate solutions were used to treat infections 
in the nineteenth century [159]. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) 
have been widely used in nanomedicine because to their unique 
chemical and physical characteristics, huge surface area to 
volume ratio, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility [160].
Because of their unique chemical and physical features, large 
surface area to volume ratio, cheap manufacturing cost, and 
biocompatibility, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely 
employed as drug delivery vehicles in nanomedicine [161].
Because of their strong tumor-killing and antibacterial properties, 
AgNPs have been described as useful nanoparticles in the 
treatment of cancer and infections. AgNPs have been utilized 
to carry medications to the eyes and as an ocular contact lens 
coating agent. Furthermore, in a number of cell culture systems
and animal models for ocular disorders, AgNPs, alone or in 
combination with natural plant extracts, demonstrated 
substantial anti-angiogenic, antioxidant, anti-glycation end 
products, and anti-cataractogenic activities [162]. Anbukkarasi 
et al. assessed the antioxidant and anti-cataractogenic effects 
of AgNPs varying in diameter from 15 to 50 nm generated
from an ethanolic extract of T. divaricate leaves, which 
is known to exhibit antioxidant and anti-cataractogenic
pharmacological action. The researchers created an in vitro 
selenite-induced cataractogenic model to investigate the effect 
of AgNPs on dense opacification of Wistar rat lenses. The 
findings showed that the AgNPs created worked as a powerful
antioxidant by scavenging the free radicals DPPH and H2O2, which 
are the primary culprits of cataract development [163]. Despite
the fact that AgNPs have antifungal, antioxidant, anti-angiogenic, 
and anti-inflammatory properties, their poor success in the field
of ocular drug delivery can be attributed to their toxicity in 
multiple investigations. The release of silver ions from the 
nanoparticle surface induces irritation in various ocular regions, 
which is the most commonly reported toxicity. Jun et al. studied  
 
228 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
the toxicity of silver nanoparticles at 0.4 mg/L and observed that 
cell death or a blockade of nuclear DNA or RNA export induced 
downregulation of numerous lens crystalline genes [164].
AgNPs with diameters of 22.4 and 42.5 nm produced cytotoxicity
in bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs) and activated the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) system in one investigation [165]. 
6.10 Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles (Nanoceria￾CeO2-NPs)
Cerium is a rare earth element in the periodic table’s lanthanide 
series that is considered a potent antioxidant. CeO2-NPs with 
3–5 nm diameters catalyze antioxidant reactions via two oxidation 
states: The reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the loss of an oxygen 
atom [166]. This process fills cell gaps with reactive oxygen
species (ROS), mimicking the antioxidant enzymatic functions 
of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase [167]. In the realm 
of ophthalmology, CeO2-NPs have been studied in many animal
models of AMD and have shown potential antioxidant, anti￾inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties. They were 
also demonstrated to provide long-term neuroprotection for 
photoreceptors in RP mice with minimal side effects. They were 
also discovered to be safe for lens cells and employed as an 
efficient anti-cataractogenicagent [168]. In rat retinal primary
cell cultures, Chen et al. reported that 20 nm CeO2-NPs could 
prevent an increase in free radical concentrations. They decided
to test the NPs in vivo by exposing albino rats to 2700 lux of light 
for 6 h. Light exposure generally kills 50–60% of photoreceptors; 
however, electroretinogram (ERG) data showed that a large 
percentage of photoreceptor cells were preserved following 
posttreatment with CeO2-NPs [169]. Pretreatment of albino 
Sprague–Dawley rats with intravenous and intravitreal injections 
of CeO2-NPs for 3 weeks decreased neuronal mortality induced 
by 1000 lux light for 24 h and helped maintain the integrity of
the outer nuclear layer, according to Fiorani et al. The study 
also found that nanoceria can prevent microglial activation and 
migration to the outer nuclear layer for a prolonged length of
time. Nanoceria of 5–10 nm, according to Bhargava et al., might Magnetic Nanoparticles 229 
increase the lifetime of rod and cone photoreceptors in culture 
by aiding with cell line maintenance, allowing for enhanced 
drug screening trials on these cell lines [170]. 
6.11 Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs)
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are nanotechnology-based
materials that contain magnetic elements such as iron, cobalt, 
chromium, and manganese. Its biological uses include medication 
delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, tissue healing, transfection, 
and tissue targeting [171]. Because its reactive surface may 
be functionalized with biocompatible coatings or bioactive 
chemicals, it yields a powerful drug delivery system with increased
selectivity for biological targets while avoiding interactions 
with healthy cells [172]. Iron oxide magnetic particles are the 
most often used MNPs. Coating iron oxide magnetic particles 
with biocompatible material inhibits particle aggregation,
biodegradation, and change from their original condition, allowing 
the bioactive component to be entrapped on the particle via 
covalent attachment or adsorption [173]. Therapeutic chemicals 
are bound to the magnetic nanoparticle shell. The fundamental 
advantage of employing magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles is 
that they can be viewed via magnetic resonance imaging, and 
drug-loaded nanoparticles may be kept in place with the help of 
a magnetic field. Fluid MAG-D labeled mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) were implanted intravitreally into a retinal degenerative 
transgenic rat. This approach may give the most help in outer 
retinal illnesses such as AMD where controlled distribution to 
target cells is necessary since it can deliver a greater drug load 
to the region of interest and has resulted in therapeutically
beneficial biochemical alterations in the dystrophic retina [174]. 
After injecting magnetic nano- and microparticles, measurements 
of IOP, ERG, and histology revealed no damage. Microparticles 
were relatively safe in terms of ocular endothelial cell numbers 
and iron accumulation in tissues. Another study found polymer￾coated MNPs to be histologically and electro-physiologically safe 
for photoreceptors. IOP, ERG, and histopathology measurements 230 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target 
following magnetic nano- and microparticle injection revealed 
no harm. Microparticles were relatively safe in terms of ocular 
endothelial cell numbers and iron accumulation in tissues. Another 
study found that polymer-coated MNPs are both histologically 
and electro-physiologically safe for photoreceptors [175].

6.12 Implant Devices
Drugs can be administered by implant devices made of polymeric 
materials. Ozurdex (dexamethasone biodegradable implant;
Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), Trivaris (triamcinolone acetonide 
suspension; Allergan, Inc.), Kenalog (triamcinolone acetonide 
suspension; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA), and 
Triesence (triamcinolone acetonide suspension; Bristol-Myers 
Squibb, Princeton, NJ (triamcinolone acetonide suspension;
Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). Nonbiodegradable implants provided 
more precise medication release control and longer release 
periods as compared to biodegradable implants. Nonbio￾degradable implant removal, on the other hand, may cause issues 
for the patient. Medication release in the retina might take Clinical Trials and Commercialization of Ocular Nanomedicine 231 
anywhere from five weeks to six months, depending on where it
is put [176]. 
6.13 Clinical Trials and Commercialization of 
Ocular Nanomedicine
The first nanomedicine product entered the market over two 
decades ago. In 2012, there were 33 nanotherapies on the 
market, with over 100 treatments in development, and the 
United States was home to more than half of the nanomedicine 
businesses [177, 178]. The fast progress of nanotechnology in 
the drug delivery sector has resulted in the advancement of 
formulations for ocular medicine administration, many of which 
are now in clinical trials or on the market. Despite the approval
of a drug-free nanoemulsion to treat dry eye, other formulations, 
such as drug-loading emulsions, are still behind in terms of 
therapeutic progress. Restasis®, a nanoemulsion containing
cyclosporin A, was the first drug to be licenced for the treatment 
of chronic dry eye condition, and Durezol®, a nanoemulsion 
containing the chemical difluprednate, is approved to treat eye 
inflammation [179]. According to Grumezescu, many ophthalmic 
nanoformulations are in clinical trials, including TLC399 (ProDex), 
which contains dexamethasone sodium phosphate and is now 
in phase II for the treatment of macular edema induced by retinal 
vein occlusion. A phase II clinical trial with latanoprost coated 
liposomes (POLAT-001) for the treatment of ocular hypertension 
and primary open-angle glaucoma has also been completed 
[180]. “According to clinicaltrials.gov, a website developed by 
the United States National Institutes of Health, Department of 
Health and Human Services, SYSTANE®, a propylene glycol-based 
eye drops nanoemulsion that has completed phase IV for dry eye 
disease treatment, is one current ocular nanomedicine under 
clinical trial in 2020”. Despite the need for more research and
studies on nanostructure dispersion to the eye, the progress of 
nanotechnology in ocular therapeutics appears to be a viable 
method, with a rising number of nano-based formulations in 
clinical trials and on the market [181]. 232 Novel Drug Delivery System for Ocular Target

6.14 Conclusion
Nanoparticles have attracted great attention in drug distribution 
pathway research over the last few decades, with scientists 
attempting to create drug-filled nanoparticles for transmission
to the anterior and posterior portions of the eye. Traditional 
drug delivery formulations have shown success in the treatment
of anterior eye part problems, but are less effective in the 
treatment of posterior eye part illnesses, even with frequent 
dosage. Although eye drops, suspensions, and ointments are 
convenient, instantly active, and safe ways of ocular medication 
delivery, the truth is that topically applied doses are rapidly lost 
after 5 to 6 min of administration owing to reflex blinking and 
nasolacrimal drainage. Because of their small size, nanoparticles 
are good candidates for ocular application. To address the 
issues associated with traditional medicine delivery in ocular 
formulations, several organic and inorganic nanoparticles have 
been produced. The nanomedicine market is still in its early 
stages, with numerous drug delivery technologies in clinical 
studies. Several intravitreal polymeric medicine delivery
implants for eye problems have been authorized by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). The use of nanotechnology in 
ocular nanomedicine research has shown tremendous promise. 
Nanomaterials have the potential to improve the bioavailability

of a wide range of pharmaceuticals. Liposomes, dendrimers, 
niosomes, and metal nanoparticles are some examples of 
nanomaterials. Several studies are focusing on the combination
of hybrid systems with hydrogels using micelles, dendrimers,
and cyclo-dextrins [109]. AR 13,503 is now undergoing clinical 
studies and is likely to be utilized to treat DME and wet AMD. 
Another advanced nanofabrication technology is the hydrogel 
template approach, which may be utilized to create huge quantities 
of homogeneous nanoparticles and microparticles [111].

Pulmonary delivery is the most promising route for drug delivery 
as the lungs are capable of absorbing drugs for both local
depositions as well as for systemic delivery. Pulmonary disorders 
are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, major chronic 
disorders include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), tuberculosis, lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis. Pulmonary 
barriers (behavioral, mechanical, chemical, and immunological), 
as well as the diverse mechanisms of particle deposition within 
the lungs, are the crucial parameters for achieving the therapeutic 
efficacy of the drug. To conquer all such barriers various 
nanosystems (liposomes, microparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, 
polymeric nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and dendrimers) 
are developed. Some of the patents associated with targeted 
pulmonary drug delivery are explained in detail in the given 
chapter.

7.1 Introduction 
Pharmaceutical researchers and developers have faced challenges 
with pulmonary drug delivery. The intricate defense system
of the human respiratory system frequently prevents drugs from 
entering circulation and providing the body with a therapeutic 
dosage. Even if medicine can successfully travel via the nasal 
passages, it can be challenging to cross the lungs, the circulation, 
and the intricate web of blood arteries and capillaries. The 
bloodstream, on the other hand, frequently provides a faster 
and more direct path to the bloodstream and can get over the 
defenses [1].
Pulmonary disease conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, 
pulmonary hypertension, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, 
and lung tumor have become one of the leading reasons for 
death. Researchers have made several attempts to create a 
reliable drug delivery device. Nasal drops and other traditional 
methods have been replaced by cutting-edge formulation methods
including liposomes, nanoparticles, dendrimers, and carbon 
nanotubes as well as devices like nebulizers and metered drug 
inhalers. These innovative methods offer a new method for 
delivering drugs to the lungs’ target sites. Such innovative drug 
delivery methods have the potential to offer prolonged drug
release, target delivery, quick onset, and enhanced bioavailability 
[2]. 
7.2 Respiratory Tract: Anatomy 
The respiratory system encompasses disparate elements: the 
respiratory tract, the chest wall, central nervous system, and 
pulmonary circulation [3]. The respiratory tract is fractionated 
into four pivotal distinct segments: the alveoli, the respiratory 
bronchioles, the conducting airways, the respiratory bronchioles, 
and the nasal oropharynx [4]. Naso-oropharynx region embodies
the nose, mouth (oral/buccal cavity), pharynx, and larynx (all 
comprise upper airways). This upper airway region heats,
humidifies, warms and filter/purify the inhaled air ante it reaches 
to alveoli [5]. The lower airways comprehend trachea (conducting  
Respiratory Tract 253 
airways), bronchi, and bronchioles (secondary, tertiary terminal 
bronchioles) alveoli. The lower airway region equips mucous 
protection and immunological characteristics to the lungs [6]. Gas 
commutation takes place at the alveoli level, thereupon alveoli 
supply oxygen to the body organs as obligatory for regular day￾to-day activities [4] (Fig. 7.1). The total surface area of human
lungs is approx. 130–180 m2. Nearby billions of alveoli are 
immersed amid the capillaries to establish an air-blood interface. 
Alveoli’s surface is the major primary area for O2 and CO2 gas
diffusion and exchange. In the alveolar region, gases and blood are
in close contact with each other across a large surface area [7, 8]. 
The right lung is demarcated into lower, middle, and upper lobes, 
which are additionally sub-partitioned into divergent fragments, 
whereas the left lung embodies upper and lower lobes [4]. Lungs 
perform a key role in breathing, transporting oxygen to body 
tissues (this phenomenon is christened as inspiration/inhalation), 
and displacing carbon dioxide out of the body tissues (labeled as 
expiration/exhalation). The respiratory system conducts/transports 
oxygen from the outside environment to the mitochondria in the 
cells across the entire body and thereby a major route for the 
entrance of toxic and foreign substances from outside air into 
the human body [9, 10]. The entire respiratory tract is divided with
a thin layer (having a thickness of about 0.1–0.2 μm) capillary 
network of the alveolar vascular epithelium [5]. There are four 
pivotal histological layers within the respiratory system: The 
respiratory mucosa consists of the epithelium and lamina propriety 
(supporting layer), cartilage or muscular layer, submucosa, and 
adventitia. The larger segment of the respiratory tract, extending 
from the nasal cavity to the bronchi, is covered with pseudostratified 
columnar ciliated epithelium. The bronchioles are covered by 
cuboidal epithelium to simple columnar cells. The alveoli, which 
are responsible for gaseous exchange, are lined with squamous 
epithelium. The major part of the respiratory tract is webbed with 
ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium except for the larynx 
and pharynx segments. The function of ciliated pseudostratified 
columnar epithelium is to protect against foreign particles and 
pathogens, furthermore curtails/lessens the infections and tissue 
injury via utilization of mucociliary elevator [11]. 254 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
Figure 7.1 Organ and structure of respiratory system. 
7.3 Primary Pulmonary Disorders Targeted by 
Potential Drug Delivery Systems 
Among all the diseases occurring worldwide, pulmonary diseases 
are the third most common cause of mortality. They range from 
bronchiolitis, cough, common cold, and irregular breathing to more 
life-threatening diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary 
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung 
cancer. A decisive method is pulmonary drug delivery, which is 
appropriate for local and systemic effects. Factors that construct 
the pulmonary system as a standard delivery target comprise thin 
alveolar absorptive membranes, high solute exchange capacity, 
vast epithelial surface area, and high vascularization [12]. The 
pulmonary route is an appropriate system for the delivery of
drugs that have poor oral absorption and are broken down by 
stomach acid and first-pass metabolism in the liver [13]. Evidence 
supports the application of a targeted drug delivery system in 
the cure of pulmonary-related diseases. They cover lung cancer, 
cystic fibrosis, asthma, and pneumonia [14].
Firstly, cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic 
disorder in which there is enormous production of mucous Primary Pulmonary Disorders Targeted by Potential Drug Delivery Systems 255 
that causes respiratory infections, respiratory breakdown, and 
pulmonary blockage [15]. The exchange of gases in the lungs is 
affected in the case of pneumonia which is a lung parenchymal 
infection. It is initiated by toxic chemicals or other catastrophic 
foreign particulates or protozoal, bacteria, fungal and viral 
infection. Fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, and 
fever are the prevailing indications of this disease. To cure 
pneumonia, various classes of drugs are used, including cough 
suppressants, antibiotics, and antifungals.
Bronchial asthma is considered a type of COPD, distinguished 
by airflow hindrance because of numerous stimuli comprising 
environmental allergy, psychological components, and infection. 
Drugs that are used commonly for the treatment include immuno￾modulators, mast cell stabilizers, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, 
and leukotriene modifiers [12].
Further, lung cancer is a notably persistent malignant tumor 
occurring globally with a high fatality rate [12]. Unbalanced diet, 
susceptibility, occupational exposure, tobacco, and air pollution 
are some of the common causes of lung cancer [16]. Tuberculosis 
is a major health concern around the globe. Pulmonary tuberculosis 
arises due to lungs infection where a massive amount of 
infectious bacilli are present in the alveoli. Pulmonary tuberculosis 
can be cured by effective therapies like directly observed 
therapy (DOTs) and multi-drug therapy is currently used therapy 
for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis [19]. Toxicity, 
side effects, and adverse reactions are various drawbacks of 
various drug combinations. However, targeted carrier systems 
provide less toxicity and fewer adverse drug reactions, and more 
therapeutic efficacy [17].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder modulates a 
chronic lung disorder majorly chronic obstructive bronchitis and 
emphysema. It is identified by respiratory muscle dysfunction, 
hyperinflammation, airflow limitation, and bronchial inflammation 
[19]. Various components that initiate the pathogenesis of COPD 
include genetic predisposition environmental exposure, and 
cigarette smoking. For the treatment of COPD corticosteroids, 
anticholinergics, beta-agonists, and long-acting bronchodilators
are targeted [18]. 256 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
7.4 Mechanism of Novel Drug Carrier 
Administered by Naso-Pulmonary Route 
Nanoparticulate systems such as microparticles, solid lipid
nanoparticles (SLNs), liposomes, nanosuspensions, Dendrimers, 
polymeric nanosystems, and inorganic nanoparticles are extensively 
employed for pulmonary drug delivery to treat local respiratory 
infections and diseases(such as bronchitis, COPD, asthma, lung 
cancer). Nanocarriers encapsulate drugs such as toxic anticancer 
agents (doxorubicin utilized to treat lung cancer) and lessen 
systemic toxicity. These nanoparticulate systems are having the
size dimensions of nano or microns (1–5 μm) and have the
capability to penetrate profoundly into the lungs thus efficiently
and effectively providing target site-specific drug distribution. 
These nanosystems are inhaled into the respiratory route with 
disparate devices such as aerosols, nebulizers, metered-dose 
inhalers (MDI), and pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDI). 
Nanopariculates after inhalation (by using different inhalation 
devices) contact with the mucosal membrane, this association 
between inhaled nano particulates and the mucosal layer causes 
the dissolution of the nanosystem. Particles having smaller 
diameters exhibit better interaction with mucosal membrane 
and displayed a high dissolution rate and ultimately leading to 
drug release at a specific site, dwindling systemic adverse effects, 
and ameliorating the bioavailability of active drug molecules. 
Nanocarriers are readily uptaken by tumor cells within the 
lungs by endocytosis, contributing towards the enhancement of 
antitumor efficacy of active therapeutic agents [19, 20]. 
Pulmonary drug deposition is a complicated process that is 
influenced by particle size, velocity, respiratory tract location, 
and lung capacity. Due to impaction, large particles (>10 µm) 
get deposited in the oropharynx and larynx. Usually, very tiny 
particles (less than 0.5 µm) are generally not deposited and are 
expelled upon exhalation [21]. 
Impaction 
The bronchial region experiences the most impaction deposition 
and is a widely observed phenomenon with bigger particles. The Pulmonary Barrier 257 
particles deposit by their aerodynamic diameter and inertia. Due 
to impaction at the airway surface and inertia, particle movement 
occurs with the airflow. The bronchial area experiences increased 
particle deposition due to impactions. 
Sedimentation 
It is a process of particles settling in the bronchi, bronchioles as 
well as in alveoli based on the rate of sedimentation depending on 
the particles’ diameter and settling rate. The size of hygroscopic 
particles may enhance as they migrate through the moist airway 
sedimentation-related deposits. 
Interception 
Due to the physical size and shape of the particles, contact
between the airway surface and the particles may result in an 
interception. Fibrous particles typically involve interception in 
the respiratory airways because of their length. 
Diffusion 
Due to Brownian motion, diffusion is the process of moving 
particles from a location of higher concentration to a region
of lower concentration. The diffusion deposition phenomenon
occurs from the nasopharynx also in the smaller airways of the 
pulmonary region, where airflow is less [22]. 
Absorption 
The drug particle absorption is regulated by epithelial cells that 
cover the lungs. The thickness of epithelial cells in the trachea is 
about 50–70 μm and approximately 0.2 μm in the alveoli region
of the lungs. These are regions that are important and targeted
for the absorption of the drug in the lungs [23]. 
7.5 Pulmonary Barrier 
Given the most recent developments in the post-genomic age, 
physiology, associated areas of molecular biology, morphology, 
a deeper knowledge of the molecular and biochemical makeup of 
the lung tissue is crucial. Following such advancements would 258 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
primarily aid in understanding issues related to the molecular 
basis of illnesses and obstacles to therapeutic delivery [24]. Due 
to several sorts of obstacles, including behavioral, chemical, 
mechanical, and immunological barriers, drug administration 
via the pulmonary route is highly difficult. Drug distribution to 
the lungs was a difficult problem up until the second half of the 
20th century because the pulmonary defense mechanisms were 
not well understood back then [25]. However, by properly 
resolving these issues, pharmaceutical scientists can design
efficient medication delivery methods for targeting the lungs
(Fig. 7.2). 
Figure 7.2 Different types of barriers for pulmonary target drug delivery. 
Mechanical barrier: the bronchial tree, a sophisticated network 
of airway tissues, makes up the lungs. There are various airway 
bifurcations that a particle proceeds from the alveolar area to 
the epithelial target sites may deposit in. Because of disease￾related inflammation, bronchoconstriction, or mucous hyper
secretion, the pulmonary region’s mechanical barrier becomes more 
prominent. By clearing the accumulated particles from the airways, Strategies for Pulmonary Target Drug Delivery 259 
lung mucociliary clearance also provides important mechanical 
barrier properties [25]. 
Chemical and immunological: chemical and immunological
obstacles in the administration of pulmonary drugs include 
alveolar macrophage, surfactants, and proteolytic enzymes. The 
hydrolysis of protein and peptides in the lungs is carried out 
by proteolytic enzymes such as endopeptidase and cathepsin 
H [26]. Phosphocytic cells called alveolar macrophages absorb 
toxic particles and eliminate them from the lungs. Surfactants 
facilitate the elimination of inhaled particles by macrophages by 
preventing them from adhering to the epithelial membrane of 
the lungs [27]. 
Behavioral barrier: patient characteristics such as non￾adherence to the therapeutic regimen, which might be intentional 
or unintentional, can have a substantial impact on the therapy’s 
outcome. Furthermore, cultural variables may contribute 
to patients’ non-compliance. Suboptimal and unpredictable
medication deposition in the lungs could result from poor inhaler 
technique and handling errors [28].

Delivery 
Inhalation drug delivery has the potential to improve the efficacy
and safety of inhaled therapies for respiratory disorders. The 
principal advantages of inhaled administration are rapid drug 
absorption and elimination from the blood, which is less likely to 
be affected by gastrointestinal side effects than oral administration. 
Inhaled dosage forms are also convenient, portable, and can be 
used anywhere, making them an attractive alternative to oral 
administration for some indications. However, inhaled dosage
forms are limited to use only in the lung, which is not always an 
adequate site for in vivo drug delivery [29]. 
Approaches 
Drug delivery at the pulmonary region is acquired by different
types of approaches. The aim is to convey the drug at the target  
 
 
260 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
region to attain maximum bioavailability of it. The required 
bioavailability is achieved by increasing the drug retention time 
at the target site. The major factor that determines the type drug 
release system is the type of polymer used. 
1. Immediate drug release system. 
2. Controlled drug release systems – such as liposomes,
nanoparticles, microparticles and micelles. 
3. Sustained drug release system – such as microspheres. 
The control and sustained drug release system comes with 
several advantages such as increased duration of action, reduced 
dosing frequency, aided patient compliance, economical and 
increased bioavailability. The selection of carrier polymer plays 
an important role and is made according to the disease. 
Formulations, method of preparation, and delivery device are 
considered according to the disease state and target site [30]. 
Naso-Pulmonary Route for Drug Delivery is the ideal non￾invasive route for a local and systemic therapeutic action of 
drug molecules, this route displays a wide surface area for drug 
absorption, eventually leads to augmented bioavailability, efficacy, 
and accelerated therapeutic efficacy, dwindles the amount of dose 
administered, lessened undesirable systemic adverse effects. The 
pulmonary route exhibits high vascularization, a non-invasive 
pathway, and bypasses the first-pass metabolism [31]. Pulmonary 
Route is appropriate pathway for targeting alveolar macrophages, 
maintaining sustained and controlled drug release, and abating
drug toxicity [32]. 
7.6.1 Liposomes 
Liposomes are small, spherical-shaped vesicles having single 
or multiple concentric lipoidal bilayers (of natural non-toxic 
phospholipids and cholesterol, non-polar and lipophilic drugs 
are entrapped in lipoidal bilayer) that surround an aqueous
compartment (Polar/Hydrophilic drugs are loaded in the aqueous 
core) (Fig. 7.3). Prevalent methods of liposome preparations 
are the mechanical dispersion method (sonication, membrane 
extrusion, lipid film hydration, micro emulsification methods), 
solvent dispersion method (Ether injection, reverse phase Strategies for Pulmonary Target Drug Delivery 261
evaporation, ethanol injection, method), and detergent removal 
method. 
Figure 7.3 Structure of liposome. 
Liposomes are extensively used as a drug delivery system
owing to their similarity with cell membranes as well as their 
capability to load both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug 
molecules, in the treatment of disparate diseases such as diverse 
types of cancer (Lung cancer, Breast cancer, Prostate cancer 
cytoplasm, and cell nucleus cancer), parasitic infections and diseases 
such as-Leishmaniasis. Likewise, Liposomes are extensively
utilized as an analytical reagent/tool in biophysics, colloidal 
science, biochemistry, and biology field [33, 34]. Liposomes as 
a drug delivery system play a remarkable role in the preparation 
of formulations of potent drugs and multiply the therapeutic 
efficacy of the drug, distribute the drug at the specific target 
site, lessening the drug toxicity. The liposome drug delivery 
system transports the drug to a specific desired site without or
with the expression of target recognition molecules on the 
lipoidal membrane. Liposomes are comprehensively employed 
to deliver divergent drug molecules such as antifungal, antiviral,
antitubercular drugs, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs,
anesthetics, vaccines, and genes [35, 36]. Furthermore, liposomes 
are extensively utilized for the delivery of therapeutic molecules 262 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
in peripheral airways using different devices such as medical 
nebulizers, aerosols, and metered-dose inhalers, contributing 
toward the safe and controlled/sustained release of drugs in the 
lungs [37]. Liposomes are employed as carriers for the delivery 
of antimycobacterials to treat Mycobacterium avium intracellular 
infections within alveolar macrophages [38]. 
Paclitaxel (PTX) was more effectively delivered to the lungs 
by liposome aerosol formulations than through intravenous 
ways, according to research by Koshkina et al. in mice via 
injection [39]. Fritz et al. demonstrated that clodronate loaded 
with liposomes decreased the number of macrophages by 50% 
after 4–6 weeks of treatment and dramatically decreased the 
capacity of tumor cells to proliferate in a mouse model of 
carbamate–induced lung tumor [40]. Salbutamol sulfate (SBS) 
aerosol was encapsulated in liposomes by Chen et al. [41] who also 
showed that the complexes demonstrated longer-lasting impacts 
on asthma than unrestricted SBS. In addition, Witten et al. [42] 
conducted a phase I clinical trial to examine the use of cisplatin 
liposomal preparation in lung cancer. Their findings suggested 
that this medication delivery technology might improve drug 
absorption while minimizing systemic adverse effects. Some 
more applications of liposome formulation in drug delivery are 
given in Table 7.1. 
7.6.2 Microparticles 
Microparticles are solid particulates having sizes in dimensions 
1–1000 μm, and behave as a multi-unit drug delivery system. 
Microparticles are membrane vesicles that are liberated from 
diverse cell types and vary in size, protein as well as in phospholipid 
composition. Microspheres embody a homogenous, uniform 
mixture of API and polymers, microcapsules composed of 
polymeric coat that encloses drug molecule. Reliant on their 
size, shape, and surface characteristics [57], they get deposited 
in disparate body tissues/parts and contribute towards the 
sustained/controlled and targeted area-specific drug release.

The bioavailability and effectiveness of API in comparability 
to other routes of drug administration. Techniques that are 
comprehensively employed for the development of inhalation 
microparticulate systems are [58] spray drying, supercritical 
fluid technique, micronization, bottom-up, and spray freezing 
techniques. Microparticles are broadly used for drug delivery 
as they certify the target site-specific drug distribution, dwindle
the pitfall of dose dumping and burst impact, ameliorate the 
stability and compatibility, and lessened the intra and inter-subject 
variations [59]. Microparticles provide appropriate protection/
shield to the enclosed active agent from deterioration and assure 
sustained/controlled drug release and effortless administration 
[60]. Polymeric microspheres, as well as Solid lipid microparticles, 
are employed as pulmonary route drug carrier systems to 
provide sustained-release effect of the therapeutic agent. SLM 
(Solid lipid microparticles) are physicochemically stable, and 
physiologically compatible, large-scale production at a lesser cost 
is achievable [61]. Microparticles are an appropriate tool to 
target site-specific drug delivery in respiratory airways to treat
different pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD, 
pulmonary hypertension, Pulmonary tract infections, and lung 
cancer [62].
Budesonide inhalable microparticles were created by
Parsian et al. utilizing a spray freeze-drying technique. They 
synthesized budesonide micronized porous particles with 
L-leucine and hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HP-b-CD) as 
excipients. The resultant particles had an enhanced nanoparticle 
fraction and suitable MMAD (FPF). Additionally, compared to other
formulations, their dissolving rate and aerosolization performance 
were enhanced [63].
Tacrolimus was made into inhalable microparticles and 
nanoparticles using this method by Wu et al. to target deep lung 
tissue delivery. Studies using laser diffraction and scanning
electron microscopy demonstrated that the respirable micro￾particles had an ideal MMAD with a size range of 1.29–1.62 mm, 
suited for deep lung administration [64].
Polycaprolactone was used by Dimer et al. to create 
inhalable microparticles containing resveratrol for the diagnosis 266 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Vibrational atomization spray 
drying was used to create the particles, and the aerodynamic
behavior of the particles was examined. The particles’ sustained￾release profile demonstrated the potential for the delivery of 
resveratrol via the pulmonary route for the therapy of arterial 
hypertension. They had an MMAD of 2.32 mm and an FPF of
50% [65].
Alireza Vatanara and colleagues considered the utilization of 
spray freeze-drying to create parathyroid hormone-containing 
porous microparticles for pulmonary administration. They also 
examined how other excipients, including L-leucine and HP-b-CD, 
affected the microparticles. When compared to particles made 
from HPV-CD, L-leucine-prepared particles displayed improved 
aerodynamic behavior. The bioavailability of parathyroid
hormone significantly increased, indicating that the inhalable 
microparticulate form of hormone therapy was superior to 
injectable hormone therapy [66]. Some more applications of 
microparticle formulation in drug delivery are given in Table 7.2. 
7.6.3 Carbon Nanotube 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are synthetic nanomaterials that 
resemble fibers and have distinctive electrical, mechanical, and 
thermal characteristics (Fig. 7.4). The most extensively used
carbon nanotubes are single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). They might
either be in their natural state or as constructions with altered 
surfaces [80, 81]. Due to its large surface area and ability to 
adsorb or conjugate with a range of pharmacological and 
diagnostic substances and effectively used in the medical field. 
Recently, scientists have used CNTs to identify and cure the 
pulmonary disease [82]. Research has shown that using carbon 
nanotubes for medical diagnostics is an efficient strategy and 
research has demonstrated that the immunological reaction 
in vivo is not rare and is used in the targeted therapy [83, 84].

Lodhi et al. developed dexamethasone conjugated multi 
wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for controlled delivery of 
a doxorubicin with reduced toxicity [85]. On cancer cells, the 
combination of MWCNTs, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone was 
more toxic, had a less hemolytic impact, and had superior and 
faster dispersion and diffusion. According to Li et al., the use of 
MWCNTs in combination with cisplatin as a chemotherapy agent 
increased treatment efficacy while reducing adverse effects such 
as liver and renal damage [89]. This effective carrier can raise 
the concentrations of platinum that accumulate in target organs 
like the lungs. The research on mice demonstrated that CNTs
don’t have aberrant immunological or inflammatory reactions.
Docetaxel is 136 times more effective when combined with an 
MWCNT carrier that has been conjugated with the transferrin 
protein, according to research by Singh et al. and according to 
reports, A549 cancer cells took the medication in significantly 
greater amounts. The medication absorption in A549 cancer 
cells was reportedly considerably greater. A different study from
2016 found that this medication and MWCNT coated with 
d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate are 
superior to non-targeted treatment [87]. Some more application

7.6.4 Dendrimer 
Dendrimers are nanocarrier, which resembles tree-like structurally 
containing a core in their center and there is a functional group 
attached to the core. A functional group can be single or repeat 
itself by being connected (Fig. 7.5). The generation number,
which is specified by G, is the repetition of functional groups, or,
in other words, the degree of polymerization. It is referred to as
the zeroth generation if there is just one functional group that 
is directly attached to the nucleus, or G-0, in the dendrimer. 
Whenever functional group 2 or 3 is directly linked to the center, 
it is referred to as G-2 or G-3 [98]. The biocompatibility of the 
dendrimer and its flexibility as a nanocarrier are increased by the 
many functional groups dispersed on its surface [99]. Additionally, 
by electrostatic contact, their exterior functional groups may be 
changed by other charged chemicals, and dendrimers with both 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic group structures can transport a 
variety of medicinal molecules with various solubilities [100]. 
The delivered medication may be enveloped in the molecular
cavity of the dendrimer or mixed with effective groups on the 
dendrimer’s surface during the distribution process [101].
Researchers studying medication delivery have been interested in 
dendrimers because of their distinct structural and compositional 
characteristics (Table 7.4).

Lung cancer G-4 PAMAM Doxorubicin According to the research, pulmonary delivery of DOX in conjunction with ligation to 
PAMAM dendrimer through an intracellular labile bond is a possible tactic to improve 
therapeutic efficacy and lessen systemic toxicity of DOX 
[105]

Strategies for Pulmonary Target Drug Delivery 273274 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
For instance, a prior in vitro study conducted by Bellini
et al. revealed that anti-tuberculosis drug rifampicin embedded
in fourth-generation polyamidoamide (G4-PAMAM) dendrimers 
exhibited high stability under physiological pH conditions [102].
Similar to this, Rajabnezhad et al. formulated inhalable 
nanodrugs for the treatment of tuberculosis by using several 
generations of PAMAM dendrimer-loaded rifampicin. Their findings 
demonstrated that third-generation PAMAM dendrimers provided 
prolonged drug release and greatly enhanced medication solubility 
and bioavailability as compared to standard intravenous delivery 
[103].
Conti et al. used an amine-terminated G4PAMAM dendrimer 
(G4NH2) embedded with siRNA to reduce the expression of 
enhanced green fluorescent protein in an A549 epithelial cancer 
cell model. The demonstrated G4NH2 siRNA profoundly targets
the alveolar epithelial cells and successfully silences the target 
gene [104].
Zhong et al. formulated a complex containing DOX and
carboxyl-terminated G4-PAMAM dendrimers for the treatment 
of pulmonary metastasis. They found that on intravenous 
administration the dendrimer complex increased the drug’s
formation and retention time in the lung. Also, it has decreased 
systemic toxicity and improved DOXʼs effectiveness on carcinoma 
[105]. Some more applications of dendrimer formulation in 
drug delivery are given in Table 7.4. 
7.6.5 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles 
Solid lipid nanoparticles can be described as colloidal drug carriers 
with specified diameters ranging from 50 nm to 1 μm. They are 
composed of solid lipids or a combination of solid lipids and 
different liquids that are stabilized with the help of an emulsifier 
(Fig. 7.6). Lipids are generally utilized in the preparation of SLNs 
that includes physiological lipids like triglycerides, fatty acids, 
waxes, and steroids which can be well absorbed by the body and 
are biocompatible. SLNs are preferred over liposomes because of 
the enhanced stability of drug-encapsulated nanoparticles due to 
emulsion-based stabilization. SLNs offer specialized properties like Strategies for Pulmonary Target Drug Delivery 275 
a target-based release, easy manufacturing, controllable particle 
size, controlled release, incorporation of a lipophilic and hydrophilic 
drug, simple scale-up, and reduced toxicity. SLNs prevent drug 
molecules’ interaction with physical, chemical, and enzymatic 
degradation [110]. 
Figure 7.6 Structure of solid lipid nanoparticles. 
Rosiere et al. evaluated the efficiency of paclitaxel-loaded
solid lipid nanoparticles for enhanced delivery to lung tumors. 
It was concluded that prolonged exposure to paclitaxel was 
exhibited by in vivo pulmonary delivery of coated solid lipid 
nanoparticles [111]. According to the research by Ji et al. 
conducted a study in which the hydrophobic drug naringenin 
was encapsulated into solid lipid nanoparticles using the low￾temperature solidification method and emulsification. The study 
found that when the drug-loaded SLNs were administered via 
pulmonary instillation, their bioavailability was significantly
improved compared to that of the containing drug suspension, 
confirming that SLNs can be utilized for delivery and improving 
the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs [112]. In 
contrast to traditional oral delivery, Makled et al. investigated the 
potential of sildenafil citrate-loaded SLNs for the management 276 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
of pulmonary hypertension using targeted inhalational delivery. 
The drug-loaded SLNs showed good colloidal stability, a sustained￾release profile, and high encapsulation efficiency for a duration
of over 24 h. The stability was unaffected when inhaled using a
jet nebulizer [113]. Some more applications of SLP formulation 
in drug delivery are given in Table 7.5.

7.6.6 Polymeric Nanoparticles 
Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are the formulations that entrap 
active compounds within the polymeric core (Fig. 7.7). The particle 
size ranges from 1 to 1000 nm. Nanocapsules and nanospheres
are the forms of nanoparticles that are differentiated based on
their structure. Polymeric nanoparticles can be used to target 
drug delivery for various diseases [122, 123]. For the creation 
of nanocarriers to carry therapeutic and diagnostic medicines, 
polymers with specific physicochemical and biological benefits
are utilized. 
Different substances that are introduced into the polymer 
surface or disseminated in the polymeric matrix can be 
delivered using polymer-based nanocarriers [124]. Polymers 
used in polymeric nanoparticles are such as polyanhydrides,
polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA),
polyacrylates, polyethyleneimine (PEI), and PEG. As a pulmonary 
delivery method, PLGA offers several benefits but also some 
drawbacks. For instance, the slow rate of PLGA breakdown 
may cause an excessive build-up of PLGA in the respiratory 278 Nanotechnology-Based Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of Pulmonary Diseases 
tract [125]. The release duration ranges from several weeks to 
several months, and the drugʼs rate of degradation is dependent 
on the molecular weight and composition of the polymeric 
nanocarriers. Additionally, ongoing PLGA hydrolysis may result 
in an acidic core being created inside the delivery system. The 
hydrolysis also lowers the pH of the microenvironment and 
harms pH-sensitive proteins that are encapsulated, like proteins 
and peptides [126]. 
Figure 7.7 Structure of polymeric nanoparticle. 
To evaluate whether ciprofloxacin-loaded PLGA NPs might
treat cystic fibrosis brought on by bacterial infection in Calu-3
cells and CFBE41o cells, Türeli et al. [127] synthesized the NPs.
The findings demonstrated that the nanoparticles had high drug 
loading efficiency and better permeability, enabling them to 
attain high and sustained local drug concentrations while also 
allowing for a reduction in medication dosage to lessen adverse 
effects. 
Kim et al. formulated a sustained-release inhalation system 
of DOX using PLGA. It has shown high drug loading efficiency
and had better nebulization. According to the results, the DOX 
nanoparticles have been effective in inhibition of tumor cell growth 
inhibition. It can be indicated for the treatment of metastatic 
lung cancer [128].
An earlier investigation in guinea pigs by Pandey et al. [129] 
showed that the embedding of PLGA increased the bioavailability 
and decreased the frequency of administration of anti-tuberculosis 
medications by extending their average residence duration and 
elimination half-life. Clinical Case Report 279 
Tomoda et al.’s [130] research showed that TAS-103-loaded 
PLGA NPs boosted drug toxicity to A549 lung cancer cells and 
raised drug concentrations in ratsʼ lungs. PLGA is also thought 
to be a suitable option for the transfer of genes for the treatment 
of pulmonary diseases. Some more applications of polymeric 
nanoparticle formulation in drug delivery are given in Table 7.6. 
7.7 Patents 
From the above discussion, we can understand that novel 
technology has the potential to deliver drugs to the pulmonary 
target site. Researchers have been working on developing and 
improving delivery systems for the target delivery of drugs. 
With new advancements in delivery systems, toxicity and efficacy 
should be acknowledged by researchers. A diverse range of 
nanotechnology-based delivery has been developed and studied 
for pulmonary disease/disorder. Some of the patents related 
to nanotechnology for pulmonary delivery such as liposomes,
microparticles, nanoparticles, powders, and microemulsions for 
pulmonary diseases are listed in Table 7.7. 
7.8 Clinical Case Report 
Waldrep et al. evaluated the safety and tolerability of the liposome 
aerosol formulation of beclomethasone dipropionate (Bec)-di￾lauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) in patients. Ten healthy
subjects received a single dosage of Bec-DLPC liposome aerosol to 
be inhaled. The tolerability and safety of the formulation were 
assessed by spirometry and hematological investigations.
Through the study, it was concluded that the Bec-DLPC liposome 
aerosol formulation can be an alternative for an MDI or dry
powder inhalers (DPI) devices [171]. Inspired by this study,
Saari et al. further continued the work on Bec-DLPC liposome 
aerosol formulation. They studied the difference in distribution 
and clearance of Bec-DLPC in patients suffering from mild 
(n = 10) and severe asthma (n = 10). The open, parallel-group 
study was carried out by using radioactive Bec-DLPC liposome 
formulation. After administration, the mucociliary clearance 
was evaluated. According to the results, it was observed that Table 7.6 Applications of polymeric nanoparticles in drug delivery system for the treatment of pulmonary disease

Metastatic lung cancer Doxorubicin Doxorubicin PLGA [poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid] formulation showed 
excellent aerosolization properties, was very porous and had great
encapsulation efficiency. After pulmonary administration, Doxorubicin
PLGA MPs were deposited in the lungs and stayed there for up to 14
days. Doxorubicin was progressively released from DOX PLGA for
2 weeks.

Lung cancer Curcumin In this work, we essentially created polymeric nanoparticles of curcumin
loaded with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and compared their cytotoxicity
to that of their unloaded counterparts. When compared to free curcumin,
the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was shown to be higher after 24,
48, and 72 h. Therefore, it may be inferred that curcumin polymeric
nanoparticles could function as a possible delivery mechanism for lung
cancer treatment.

patients dealing with severe asthma have a higher clearance rate 
in comparison with mild asthmatic patients. The distribution of
Bec-DLPC liposomes was more in the central part of lower airways 
in severe asthmatic patients [172]. This study on Bec-DLPC 
liposome was further investigated and this time it was 
compared with Bec. Containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 
(DPPC) liposomes. A total of 11 healthy volunteers were taken
for the comparison study. After the study, it was concluded 
that clearance of both forms of liposome formulation is slow. 
The aerosol clouds were efficiently made in DLPC containing
liposome suspension. Hereafter we can conclude that liposomes 
are a good choice for the sustained release of drugs at a local site 
for pulmonary disease [173].
Jakobsson et al. investigated the difference in the deposition
of the nanoparticle in distal lungs in healthy volunteers and 
patients suffering from respiratory disease. A total of 48 subjects 
were taken and were divided into three groups: healthy non￾smoker subjects, smoker subjects, and subjects dealing with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. The deposition fraction (DF) of 
nanoparticles was examined and it was shown that patient group 
with the respiratory disease the DF was lower in comparison
with the other two groups. The lower DF value of emphysematous 
subjects indicates enlargement of airspaces in the lungs, which 
increases the deposition of nanoparticles in the lungs [174].
Haworth et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo￾controlled phase 3 trial to examine the effectiveness of liposomal 
ciprofloxacin (ARD-3150) in patients with non-cystic fibrosis 
bronchiectasis and lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
are associated with frequent pulmonary exacerbations. A total 
of 1047 patients were examined for pulmonary exacerbations 
after receiving the ARD-3150. According to the findings, it was 
concluded that ARD-3150 significantly increases the median time 
to first pulmonary Exacerbation and reduces the frequency of 
pulmonary exacerbations [175].
Tsuji et al. examined the efficiency of a combination of 
carboplatin and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) 
in a 65-year-old male patient. The research showed that nab-PTX 
is more effective at reaching the tumor microenvironment than 
solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-PTX) [176].

In a study, it was revealed that severely affected COVID-19 
patients are suffering from a decrease in albumin level and an 
increase in inflammatory response. Park et al. studied the effect 
of PEGylated nanoparticle albumin-bound (PNAB) in COVID-19 
patients. The efficacy of PNAB was evaluated in the animal model. 
The study suggested that PNAB steroidal ginsenoside drugs can 
treat symptoms of COVID-19 [177].
Winthrop et al. studied the safety, efficacy, and tolerance 
of amikacin liposome inhalation suspension with the guideline￾based therapy. The study was expanded for over 12 months with
a total of 163 patients. Of the 163 patients, 56 were withdrawn 
from the study. They further continued with 107 patients and 
completed the study. It was a 12-month open-label convert clinical 
study. The patients were divided into two groups: one assigned
with GBT alone and the other with amikacin liposome formulation 
and GBT. At the end of the investigation, it was observed that in 
patients with amikacin lipoma therapy, the efficacy and tolerance 
are the same as those of the patients receiving GBT alone. There 
were no differences with respect to the respiratory adverse 
events [178].

The stratum corneum presents a tough barrier for the delivery of 
drugs through the skin. There is interest in the use of nanoparticles 
as drug delivery carrier systems because these systems are 
potentially superior to other carrier systems in terms of controlled 
release, targeting, and stability. In recent years, a great deal of 
attention has been given to polymeric nanoparticles for delivering 
drugs to the skin. A detailed explanation of the interaction of the 
skin and nanoparticles will enhance the reader’s understanding of 
new concepts and the use of drug delivery carriers in transdermal 
delivery. The mechanism of penetration/permeation of drug 
from different nanocarriers plays an important role not only in
targeting drugs within the skin but also in the development 
strategies of nanocarriers. This chapter provides an overview

of the design of nanodrug delivery systems for transdermal drug 
delivery. The potential of nanotechnology in transdermal drug 
delivery is highlighted. The influence of the physicochemical 
properties of nanocarriers on transdermal drug delivery has also 
been given attention. Finally, the chapter concludes with future 
perspectives on nanotechnology in transdermal drug delivery. 
8.1 Introduction
The word “nanoscale” describes to particle size within 100 to 
1 nm [1]; however, depending on the mode of administration, 
nanoparticles between 50 and 500 nm are acceptable for drug 
delivery. The way a drug is administered can significantly affect
how efficiently it is delivered to the desired site. Some medicaments 
have a range of optimal concentrations where the most 
effectiveness is obtained; dosages outside or inside of this range 
might be harmful or have no therapeutic potential. A diversified 
strategy for the delivery of therapies to targeted tissues is
becoming more necessary as a result of the gradual improvement 
in the efficacy of treating a number of diseases [2]. After topical 
application to the skin’s surface, transdermal drug delivery 
systems (TDDS) or patches are acceptable pharmaceutical
delivery systems that contain the drug candidate for targeted 
management of disease conditions either administered topically 
or transdermally [3]. Even though the formulation matrix of 
various delivery systems varies, TDDS are suitable for a variety
of drugs under investigation. The following ways set them apart 
from traditional topical formulations:
The formulation matrix of the patch maintains the drug 
concentration gradient within the device after application so that 
drug delivery to the interface between the patch and the skin is 
sustained [4]. They also have an impermeable occlusive backing 
film that prevents intense water loss from the skin beneath the 
patch. Finally, TDDS are kept in place on the skin surface by an 
adhesive layer, ensuring drug contact with the skin and ongoing 
drug delivery.
Drug administration through the skin, whether topical/
transdermal, is difficult as the skin serves as a natural protective 
barrier. The US market for TDDS was first opened up in the
middle of the 1970s [5], but transdermal (TD) drug had been Mechanism of Drug Permeation through the Skin 309 
used for a very long period. Previous studies have mentioned 
the use of belladonna plasters as an analgesic and mustard 
plasters to relieve chest congestion. The mustard plasters could 
be created at home or bought professionally. They were made 
by combining water and powdered mustard seeds to form a 
paste, which was then used to create a dispersion-style delivery
method. The use of a nanoparticulate delivery system is one 
strategy that has been investigated to boost the penetration of 
bioactive substances into and through the skin.
When systemic, localized, or topical effects are indicated, the 
skin has traditionally been a key channel for drug administration. 
The skin stratum corneum (SC) serves as an effective restriction, 
but it also poses challenges for the TD administration of 
therapeutic agents since few compounds have the properties 
required to penetrate it sufficiently to achieve a therapeutic
concentration within the blood [6]. Diverse approaches have 
been researched, created, and patented in an attempt to improve 
medicine transdermal absorption. Transdermal medication delivery 
is once again receiving attention as a result of advancements 
in physical permeation-enhancement technology. ultrasound, 
microneedles, iontophoresis and electroporation to open the 
skin, and more significantly, transdermal nanodrug delivery
systems are a few of these cutting-edge technologies that improve
transdermal penetration. 
8.2 Structure of Skin
With a surface area of between 1.8 and 2.0 m2, the human skin is 
the largest organ in the body.
The epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis (subcutaneous
layer) make up its three primary layers (Fig. 8.1). The skin is a 
strong barrier that guards the body against outside threats and 
controls heat and loss of water in the body. 
8.3 Mechanism of Drug Permeation through 
the Skin
Diffusion of therapeutics via the intact epidermis and skin 
appendages is crucial for drug penetration into the skin (hair 310 The Potential of Nanotechnology in Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 
Figure 8.1 The basic structure of the skin. Mechanism of Drug Permeation through the Skin 311 
follicles and sweat glands). These skin appendages, which account 
for approximately 0.1% of total human skin, establish shunt 
channels across the intact epidermis. The stratum corneum 
is recognized to provide a barrier to medication penetration 
through the skin. Interlamellar areas, particularly linker regions,
have less ordered hydrophobic chains and lipids. Nonplanar 
spaces result from this between crystalline lipid lamellae and cell
membranes. Skin fats transepidermal diffusion of lipidic and 
amphiphilic insertion and movement of molecules via intercellular 
lipid layers [7]. Hydrophilic compounds disperse “laterally” through 
or through water-filled interlamellar gaps; Polar molecules can
utilize the gap between lamella and corneocyte membranes as 
shown in (Fig. 8.2). 
Figure 8.2 Mechanism of skin penetration. 
Keratin is abundant in the stratum corneum’s intracellular 
macromolecular matrix, which does not contribute directly to 
the skin diffusive barrier but maintains mechanical stability and 
intactness. Transcellular diffusion isn’t crucial for transdermal 
medication delivery [8]. Confocal laser scanning microscopy 
reveals transepidermal aqueous channels. Poor cellular and 
intercellular lipid packing coincides with wrinkles on the skin 
surface and lowers the skin barrier to hydrophilic transport. 
This low-resistance route connects corneocyte clusters without 
lateral overlap. TD drug transport can enhance with route 312 The Potential of Nanotechnology in Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 
broadening or multiplication, e.g., by exposing the stratum 
corneum to a high electrical, mechanical, thermal, or skin 
penetrant stimulation. 
8.4 Physicochemical Properties of Nanocarriers 
for Transdermal Drug Delivery 
8.4.1 Particle Size Distribution (PSD), Zeta Potential and 
Particle Size
Size and shape impact nanoparticle cellular absorption, stability
and drug release. Operations in-process and parameters such 
as rate of stirring, temperature, type and quantity of dispersion 
agent, and organic and aqueous phase viscosity alter yield and 
size distribution [9, 10]. Dispersion stability demands zeta 
potential [11]. 
8.4.2 Properties of Surface
Nanoparticle surface charge influences cell membrane adhesion. 
Variation of particle surface charge may regulate tissue binding 
and nanoparticle delivery in vitro and in vivo. Negatively charged 
sulfated proteoglycans have a key influence on the proliferation
of cells, motility and migration [12]. Proteoglycans present on
the cell surface are made up of a core protein attached to a 
membrane and connected to multiple glycosaminoglycan side
chain (chondroitin sulfates, heparan, dermatan and keratin). 
8.4.3 Nanoparticulate Drug Delivery Systems
Dermatological applications have been explored for a variety
of nanodrug delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, 
polymer-based nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers 
as well as magnetic nanoparticles. These have overcome the 
shortcomings of classic TDDS such as ointments, gels, and so on 
in some way. Various delivery systems have been developed to 
promote drug transport via the skin, allowing for drug retention 
and in minor cases controlled release [6]. Physicochemical Properties of Nanocarriers for Transdermal Drug Delivery 313 
Skin penetration is critical for a variety of contemporary 
problems, including microbial and chemical contamination, 
medicine distribution to and via the skin (dermatological
and transdermal therapies), and skincare and protection
(cosmetics) [6]. Nanocarriers’ small size, high surface energy, 
composition, architecture, and associated molecules are all 
merits and disadvantages of employing them for TDDS in general. 
Table 8.1 lists the benefits and drawbacks of typical transdermal 
nanocarriers. 
8.4.3.1 Vesicular systems
8.4.3.1.1 Liposomes 
Liposomes are colloidal dispersions having spherical vesicles 
that comprise a bilayer composed of phospholipid sequesters 
a portion of solvent where they easily disperse within the 
core [13]. Their benefit in pharmaceutical applications as drug 
carriers is the large range of molecules that may be added as well as 
the inherent biocompatibility of natural phospholipids. It is 
currently being debated whether liposomes can enter intact skin 
in terms of penetration behavior [14–17]. Liposomes have become 
a popular pharmaceutical nanotechnology-based drug delivery 
system for a variety of uses. Many vesicular system-based
pharmaceuticals and biomedical formulations have recently been 
authorized for clinical use. Membrane processes and membrane￾bound polypeptides were studied using them. Liposomes have 
also been considered as medication carriers with the potential
to lower toxicity while increasing effectiveness. Liposomes are
one of the greatest medication delivery options since they are 
nontoxic and stay in the bloodstream for an extended period 
of time. They’ve had good results for cancer treatment and skin 
melanoma [6]. Currently, the structural stability of many molten 
nanocosmetic carriers, including such as liposomes, is unstable. 
They stick to the interior walls of skin cells when passing through 
the skin, triggering the collapse of phospholipid-association bodies 
and the leakage of their contained components. As a result, they 
are unlikely to be able to deliver active substances deep into the 
skin. As a result, the use of flexible liposomes (elastic liposomes 
or transferosomes) is a promising technique for achieving the 314 The Potential of Nanotechnology in Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 
goal of transdermal medication administration. Examples of APIs 
delivered through the skin using a liposomal drug delivery system 
include melatonin, ketoprofen, methotrexate, estradiol, ketoprofen, 
lignocaine and amphotericin B, in comparison to diclofenac, 
insulin, tetanus toxoid, corticosteroids, DNA, clindamycin hydro￾chloride, triamcinolone-acetonide, and indinavir administered 
parentally. 
8.4.3.1.2 Niosomes (non-ionic surfactant-based vesicular systems) 
The drug molecule is enclosed in a vesicle in these non-ionic
surfactant vesicular new drug delivery systems. Niosomes are 
vesicles that could entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
solutes. They can be unilamellar or multilamellar. Practically 
saying, niosomes are potential drug delivery systems as they
are more stable and do not possess many of the drawbacks of 
liposomes, such as their expensive price and difficulties with 
changeable phospholipid purity [18]. Another benefit is the 
simplest procedure for producing niosomes on a continuous 
basis and in large quantities without the use of incompatible 
solvents. The hydrated composition of cholesterol and non-ionic 
surfactants such alkyl ethers, alkyl esters, or alkyl amides is one 
substitute for phospholipids [18, 19]. The vesicles developed 
by the above-mentioned combination are referred to as niosomes 
or non-ionic surfactant vesicles. Biocompatible, non-immunogenic, 
and biodegradable noisome surfactants are provided. Niosomes
are adaptive delivery devices that may be applied transdermal, 
among many other ways [20, 21].
The use of niosomes as effective cutaneous and transdermal 
medicament delivery methods has received special attention
[22, 23]. Niosomes, in particular, are thought to be promising 
medication delivery mechanisms for dermatological conditions.
Minoxidil and ellagic acid are two examples of transdermal 
medication delivery using niosomes. It has been demonstrated 
that niosomes can prolong the time that drugs remain in the stratum 
corneum and epidermis while reducing systemic absorption and 
enhancing the penetration of trapped molecules via the skin. 
Furthermore, these devices have been shown to reduce side effects 
and provide a significant medication release [24]. Table 8.1 Summary of typical components, structure, and transdermal mechanisms of transdermal nanocarriers [50]

During treating hair loss, niosomes synthesized from sorbitan 
monoesters (Spans) with a cholesterol molar ratio of 1:1 are
an effective method for administering minoxidil to the scalp [25].
The Span 60 and Tween 60 niosomes have been shown to be 
promising carriers for cutaneous administration of ellagic acid [26]. 
8.4.3.1.3 Elastic liposomes (transferosome) 
A lipid bilayer with characteristics that are deliberately constructed 
encapsulates at least one inner aqueous compartment in 
transferosomes, which are characterized as precisely engineered 
vesicular particles. Due to this, transferosomes, resemble lipid 
vesicles, or liposomes, in structure, but they are functionally
flexible enough to pass through apertures that are much smaller 
than their own size [27]. They are metastable, which provides
the vesicle membrane and the vesicles great mutability. The very 
great membrane adaptability of transferosomes, vesicles permits 
them to adjust to a restricting pore and so trespass through it. 
In contrast to conventional lipid vesicles like liposomes, typical 
transferosomes, have a membrane that is at least one order of 
magnitude more elastic. To convert liposomes into transferosomes, 
the vesicular membrane can include one or more edge-active
substance(s); surfactants have been suggested as potential
examples of such edge activators [28–30]. The enhanced 
hydrophilicity of transferosomes, which allows the membrane 
to enlarge more than the bilayers of ordinary lipid vesicles, is
another difference between them and liposomes. 
8.4.3.1.4 Ethosomes 
Ethosomes are lipid vesicular systems that contain relatively 
high amounts of ethanol for improved medicament penetration 
through the skin [31]. Phospholipids, ethanol, and water make 
up the majority of them. The high ethanol content, which 
distinguishes ethosomes from other vesicular carriers, aids skin 
permeability, allowing encapsulated medication particles to be 
released into deeper layers and systemic circulation. Touitou 
created ethosomes in 1996 while researching the use of a lipid 
bilayer drug delivery system in drug delivery systems for skin 
therapy [32]. 318 The Potential of Nanotechnology in Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 
An ethosomal vesicle is composed of an aqueous inner core 
with the entrapped active component and a phospholipid bilayer. 
They are flexible and supple. An ethosome vesicle is in the
nanometer range in size [33]. Furthermore, because of the high 
alcohol concentration, the ethosome vesicle is smaller than a 
liposome when generated under the same conditions. As the 
percentage of alcohol consumed grew from 20% to 45% [34], 
the size dropped. The ethanol conferred a net negative charge 
on the vesicle surface, which caused the size to decrease. Other 
excipients commonly used in the formulation of ethosomes 
include phospholipids such as cholesterol, soya lecithin (vesicle 
membrane stability), Span 60, 80 and Ethanol (permeation
enhancers), and marker dyes (6-carboxy fluorescein and 
rhodamine) for characterization studies. Cholesterol has a stabilizing 
effect because it prevents vesicle aggregation and expansion 
during storage [35]. Because of their tiny size and malleability,
ethosomes can pass past the skin or membrane barrier and 
impact transdermal permeability. The higher the amount of 
penetration, the smaller the size [31]. Unlike traditional liposomes, 
ethosomes penetrate the stratum corneum barrier and have a 
substantially higher transdermal flow. Deeper distribution and 
penetration in skin lipid bilayers are thought to be triggered 
by these interactions between linked phospholipids and high 
ethanol concentrations in vesicular formulations [33]. Technical 
ease, non-invasive administration (topical), enhanced TD 
distribution, and bypassing first-pass metabolism impact are just 
a few advantages of using ethosomes in drug delivery [36–38]. 
Improved patient compliance as a result of non-invasiveness 
leads to better treatment outcomes. High entrapment efficiency
for a wide variety of substances, including lipophilic pharma￾ceuticals, has been established for ethosomes [34, 39], due to the 
multilamellar property of the vesicular systems and the presence 
of C2H5OH. Ethosomes are reported to have improved drug 
distribution unlike liposomes and elastic liposomes to the skin 
in both occlusive [40] and non-occlusive [35, 41, 42] situations.
The use of transformable liposomes lipid bilayer of the SC,
which are able to squeeze and permeate throughout the skin 
when the gradient is developed, has grown. Tacrolimus-loaded 
ethosomes, for example, might be effective as a treatment for 
dermatitis especially atopic [43]. Skin permeability related to Physicochemical Properties of Nanocarriers for Transdermal Drug Delivery 319 
drugs formulated as ethosomes was measured using confocal laser 
scanning microscopy (CSLM), and the Rhodamine 123 loaded 
formulation had higher permeation than the ethanolic solution. 
Another Ketoprofen encapsulated ethosomal formulation has 
been shown as potentially promising vehicle for transdermal 
administration [44]. A psoriasis therapeutic approach which 
provides long-term therapeutic advantages, such as being
nontoxic, and improves patient compliance is transferosomal
carrier (phosphati-dylethanolamine). When 5-aminolevulinic 
acid (ALA)-containing ethosomal carriers are administered to 
hyperproliferative murine skin, ALA penetration and proto￾porphyrin IX synthesis are enhanced, and tumor necrosis factor 
is significantly decreased in this disordered skin [45]. Ammonium 
glycyrrhizinate’s ability to reduce inflammation was shown to be 
enhanced by ethanolosomes more so than by ethanolic or aqueous 
solutions [46].
Furthermore, the transferosomal system considerably
increased skin permeability in vitro as compared to ethanolic, 
hydroethanolic, or phospholipid–ethanolic-micellar formulations 
of minoxidil. Moreover, TD testosterone distribution from an 
transferosomal patch was higher than that from commercially 
available patches both in vitro and in vivo [47]. Tacrolimus [43], 
clotrimazole [48], trihexyphenidyl HCl [49], ketoprofen [44], and 
testosterone are examples of transdermal drug delivery utilizing 
ethosomes. 
The various commercially available transdermal formulations 
present in the market are discussed in Table 8.2. 
8.4.3.2 Lipid nanoparticles
Lipid nanoparticles, unlike lipid nanocarriers, are solid entities 
that encapsulate pharmacological molecules in a lipid core. 
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) are made up entirely of lipids that
are solid in nature, while NLC or nanostructured lipid carriers 
comprise both solid as well as lipids. In comparison to SLNs, NLCs 
(Liquid lipids) prevent solid lipid recrystallization, increasing 
stability. Surfactants are employed to promote stability in 
formulations by reducing the tension between the hydrophobic￾lipid structure and the aqueous phase [50]. Lipid nanoparticles’ 
transdermal distribution method is unknown. The proposed 320 The Potential of Nanotechnology in Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 
causes are as follows: lipid nanoparticles have skin adhesion 
properties and create a mono-layer lipid film, resulting in the 
“occlusion effect,” which prevents water evaporation, widens the 
inter-keratinocyte gap, and so improves drug penetration [51]. 
By interacting with the skin lipid layer, the lipid components 
and included surfactant have been shown to disturb skin 
structure and broadening of intercellular space, notably in SC.
Gu et al., after treating the skin with triptolide-loaded lipid 
nanoparticles, observed skin structure [11] and SC as loose 
texture and dilated epidermis were visible in SEM pictures and 
histological examination, indicating a lipid nanoparticle-skin 
interaction. 
8.4.3.3 Inorganic nanoparticles
With their potential for bio-imaging and phototherapy, inorganic 
nanostructures are frequently used for drug delivery for cancer 
management. By passively entering SC, certain nanoparticles
with + charge, high surface lipophilicity, and tiny size exhibit TD 
capacity [2].
Various research has examined the transdermal drug delivery 
efficacy of some inorganic nanoparticles due to their excellent 
stability and potential for functionalization of the surface. 
Because of their minimum cell toxicity and controlled size of 
particles, gold nanoparticles have been extensively studied as 
TDDS [52]. According to reports, the volume and rate of skin 
penetration increase as particle size decreases; also, 15 nm size 
range entity accumulate in the deep dermis [53]. Furthermore, the 
surface ligands form an Au–S bond with the gold nanoparticles, 
allowing diverse ligands to be easily conjugated to the surface 
of particles by pre-thiolation [12]. This unique property of gold 
nanoparticles makes them suitable for gene transfer. Zheng 
et al. used Au–S bonding to combine GPs with EGFR-thiolated
epidermal growth factor receptor, siRNA duplexes. In a mouse
model, SNA-NCs penetrated the whole skin layer and efficiently 
suppressed EGFR expression. Other metallic particles for 
transdermal administration have also been discovered. Trans￾follicular Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a pH-sensitive amide link 
effectively enter deeper dermis [54]. Light as well heat sensitive
CuS nanoparticles irrigated with near-infrared cause localized 
thermal dissipation of SC and promote particle penetration [55]. Table 8.2 Marketed formulations for transdermal route of administration [59]

8.4.3.4 Additional nanocarriers
Dendrimers are high-branched polymeric nanocarriers that 
are utilized as TDDS to transport hydrophobic chemicals and 
macromolecules like photosensitizers and chemotherapeutics.
Traditional poly (amidoamine) dendrimers demonstrated 
penetration enhancer potential, but they were unable to successfully 
penetrate the skin barrier due to their interaction with the lipid 
bilayers that make up the skin [56]. Some recent investigations 
have focused on dendrimer size and surface charge, leading to 
the development of second-generation dendrimers with reduced 
sizes and skin-penetrating capabilities [57]. Micelles are polymeric 
nanocarriers that are made up of amphiphilic polymers or 
surfactants that clump together in an aqueous solution [58]. 
Micelles have the capacity to co-deliver drugs due to their variable 
composition. Lipophilic medications are usually found in the core, 
whereas hydrophilic drugs are mostly found in the shell [30]. 
Micelles, like TDDS, can improve medication water solubility
and hence boost skin penetration. Because intact SC blocks
the polymer components, low-permeability medicines have less 
improvement [59]. 
8.5 Future Prospects of Nanodrug Delivery 
Systems 
Physicochemical features use, and transport mechanisms of 
several transdermal nanocarriers are explored in this paper. 
According to the findings, the lipophilic part can interfere with 
the skin’s lipid layer, disturb structure, increase space within 
cells, and therefore make skin penetration easier. TDDS can be
made from nanovesicles or solid nanoparticles. The bilayer
membrane structure gives nanovesicles a lot of flexibility and 
elastic nature, while the lipoidal core gives solid nanoparticles 
more stability. Hydrophilic pharmaceuticals are encapsulated in 
aqueous internal cores, whereas hydrophobic medications are 
loaded in exterior lipid bilayers. Solid nanoparticles, on the other 
hand, protect hydrophobic pharmaceuticals in the lipid core 
while absorbing hydrophilic medications in the outside aqueous 
phase. Furthermore, smaller sizes are indicated for increased  
 
 
 
324 The Potential of Nanotechnology in Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems 
SA, which promotes non-specific cell absorption and enables
transcellular penetration. However, there is no absolute 
relationship between size and penetration effectiveness, and 
drug encapsulation efficiency is dependent on nanoparticle size. 
Furthermore, the impact of surface charge is still debatable.
Although + surface charge is thought to facilitate penetration 
through the skin by increasing electrostatic contact with the cell 
membrane, several studies have found that negatively charged 
nanoparticles have better transdermal efficiency. Excessive cell 
internalization and skin retention will result in decreased skin 
penetration. As a result, the optimal particle size and surface 
charge range must be investigated. In addition, their surface 
modification tactics are examined in order to address the issues 
of limited penetration, uncontrolled release, and lack of targeting. 
As previously stated, we categorized the surface modifications 
based on their purposes. The use of a penetration enhancer boosts 
transdermal penetrability, allowing therapeutic medicines to pass 
through thick skin tissue in dermatitis and dense fibrous tissue
in scars. The ability to build the TD nanocarrier according to 
the ideal tissue drug concentration is made feasible by the 
implementation of both sustained and triggered regulated drug 
release. Furthermore, transdermal nanocarriers achieve active 
drug targeting delivery capacity within selected particular
ligands for target receptors, which is critical for skin cancer 
treatment.

Approximately, 60% of the infectious diseases in developing 
countries are transmitted through animal sources (zoonotic)
which silently affect vital organs and result in life-threatening 
diseases. The size, shape and mode of transmission of these 
pathogens are highly compatible with host biological tissues
and compartments. Although enormous antibiotics and antivirals 
have been discovered and clinically approved, their systemic 
toxicity and drug resistance are major hurdles to effective therapy. 
Furthermore, the emergence of new variants of infectious agents 
poses new challenges to therapy. Advanced technologies in delivery 
systems are stipulated that can control and eradicate pathogens 
and alleviate infection. Novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) are 
sought as an effective and specific tool for targeting pathogens and 
imparting better patient compliance. Reduced dosing frequency,

time and cost-effective parameters of NDDS always remain the 
prominent area. The chapter focuses on different NDDS including 
micro/nanospheres, vesicular, polymeric, particulate and their 
applications in the management of myriad infectious diseases. 
9.1 Introduction
In developing countries, the emergence and re-emergence of 
contagious infections are proving a community health threat. 
Infections may occur via bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites 
(protozoa, helminths) and worms that transmit diseases through 
intake of infected food, insect bite, sexual intercourse, droplet 
dispersion and skin contact. These invaders easily attack the 
immuno-compromised, diseased state and post-operated patients 
where these microorganisms flourish according to their growth 
requirements [1].
Today’s world faces infectious diseases as a leading cause 
of death, particularly among young children in middle-income
countries. Respiratory tract infections (COVID-19, coronary
obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia), diarrhea, 
tuberculosis, dengue, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis B
and influenza are ranked in the top 10 infections [2]. The co￾evolution of infectious agents (pathogens) with living beings 
including the environment creates critical challenges. A list 
containing human pathogenic organisms (1000 bacteria, 270 
viruses, 450 fungi, 80 protozoans and 300 helminths) was 
compiled in the year 2008 in which most of the infections 
were transmitted through animal sources (zoonotic) [3]. Rapid 
urbanization, climate change, poor nutritional choice and modern 
living style lead to the risk of infections day by day. Poverty, 
deficient infrastructure (poor water quality, unhygienic hospitals, 
and open sewage system) and malnutrition intensify severity of 
infection in a community [4]. Drastic climate changes and shifted 
geographical distribution significantly contribute emergence and 
transmission of infectious pathogens in a community. According 
to a WHO report (2018), more than 17 million people are sufferers 
of bacterial infections in a year. Further, antibiotics-resistant Introduction 337 
bacteria are harder to manage and require higher medical costs
and prolonged hospital stays [5].
A survey demonstrated that amid 9.7% universal infectious 
disease, tuberculosis ranked first (2.3%) in global death, followed 
by 2% diarrhea and 0.5% meningitis, 0.2% gonorrhea, syphilis, 
Chlamydia (sexually transmitted) and 0.19% encephalitis.
Moreover, bacterial infection resistant to a particular medicine 
can be transmitted to others in a community, which would lead 
to serious health issues or even death. In the year 2019, WHO 
declared antimicrobial resistance associated deaths from six 
leading bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli (cephalosporins and 
fluoroquinolones resistant), Klebsiella pneumonia (cephalosporin
and carbapenem resistant), Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin
resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (tetracycline and erythromycin 
resistant), Streptococcus pneumonia (fluoroquinolones) and 
Acinetobacter baumannii (carbapenem resistant). Inappropriate 
and irrational usages of antimicrobials (antibiotics) are major
issues which should be resolved to achieve efficient action against 
bacteria-resistant infections [6]. Misuse of antibiotics lets the 
exposure of bacteria in a sub-minimum inhibitory concentration 
environment for an extended time. That leads to drug-resistant 
mutation, produces antibiotic-resistant genes and sharply increases 
the MIC level of antibiotics [7]. In the USA, more than USD 55 billion 
per year is invested in the management of infections caused by 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria [8]. Traditional remedies, i.e., cream, 
lotion, gel and powders, may inhibit the growth of pathogens at 
the prelim stage and work as prophylactic. Figure 9.1 displays 
various novel drug delivery approaches designed for the alleviation 
of diverse infections caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. But,
at severe and advanced stages of infection, these preparations 
seem to be ineffective due to issues such as poor drug release,
frequent administration, reduced half-life, peak valley plasma 
concentration, side effects and patient incompliance. Sometimes, 
the conventional preparations may trigger the immune system 
of the host and exhibit hypersensitivity or allergic reactions also. 
Irrational, increased and nonspecific use of antibiotics against 
bacterial infection often leads to the risk of super infection in 
case of surgery and organ transplantation. Moreover, patients
receiving substantial doses of steroids, chemotherapeutic agents, 338 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment

NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 339 
dependent on parenterals, are more susceptible to infections. 
So, an understanding of the emergence and speed of resistance 
for antibiotic treatment is required [9]. Development of newer 
antibiotics has been restricted by more rigorous legislations and 
poor economic incentives in developing countries. The US FDA,
the principal drug regulator, approved only six antibiotics against 
Gram-positive bacteria between 2015 and 2018 [10].
Several approaches, including proteins, peptides, genes,
nucleic acids, antibodies, aptamers, etc., are proven to mitigate
infections and are suggested to co-administer with other 
bioactive agents to treat multiple diseases. The conventional
delivery systems fail to deliver them due to oscillation in plasma
concentration, poor bioavailability, enzymatic degradation and
insufficient penetration of intestinal mucosa. Further, altered 
microenvironment at the infection site (low pH, overexpressive
enzymes, release of hydrogen peroxide and toxins) and bacterial
surface properties are major concerns for designing efficient 
and responsive drug delivery systems [11].
NDDS have been extensively utilized to completely
eradicate pathogens and their infection from the site. Improved 
pharmacokinetics decreased dosing frequency, high therapeutic 
action, controlled release, minimum adverse effects and improved 
patient compliance can be achieved through designing novel 
technology and innovation in methodology. The past decade 
witnesses extensive research on innumerable innovative strategies 
for the management of infections. Polymeric particles, vesicular 
(liposomes, niosomes, aquasomes), lipid carriers and inorganic￾based materials have been developed to combat infections caused 
by myriad microorganisms. 
9.2 NDDS for the Management of Bacterial 
Infections 
Bacteria, the most widespread pathogens, have the potential to 
affect body functional units, including facial, neural, respiratory, 
gastric, genital and urinary systems. Antibiotics are advised in 
most of the infections that target the cell wall, protein synthesis, 
metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis (DNA and RNA) of bacteria [12]. 340 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
In the past decade, antibiotic-embedded novel drug delivery 
strategies that exhibit desirable bactericidal action with improved 
patient compliance have been frequently designed. Abiotic drug 
carriers (vesicle, conjugated, polymeric, lipid-based systems) and 
biological carriers (lysozyme and attenuated vectors) specifically 
target the pathogens and infected cells [13]. Figure 9.2 compiles 
several diseases caused by different strains of bacteria. 
Figure 9.2 Different novel strategies are discussed to alleviate bacterial 
infections. 
9.2.1 Neuroinfection and Bacterial Meningitis 
It is a major detrimental condition of nervous tissues and cells, 
caused by bacterial pathogens which progressively lead to 
neurological disorders [14]. Few antibiotics or antimicrobial 
therapeutics are hydrophilic and poorly permeate the bacterial
cells. Further, the internalized antimicrobial agent was readily 
destroyed by the lysozyme action thus reducing the therapeutic 
action achieved. Hence, the passive action of novel delivery
systems on directly infected cells targeting through phagocytosis 
is preferred that ensures better therapeutic action. Meningitis 
is an infection around the membrane covering the brain and 
the spinal cord. It may result in life-threatening issues quickly, NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 341 
such as brain damage, stroke and paralysis. Bacteria, including 
Streptococcus, Listeria and Escherichia, are the prime causes of 
meningitis in neonates, whereas Neisseria and Haemophilus are 
more common in children [15]. Polymeric-based drug delivery 
approaches present potential advantages in the treatment of 
meningitis owing to the direct delivery of therapeutic agents at 
the infection site and circumventing obstacles of the blood-brain
barrier [16]. Moreover, polymers with inherited antimicrobial 
action and biocide polymers exhibit enhanced effect after 
conjugating with antimicrobials and can be implanted on the 
delivery system and medical devices to alleviate infection. Apart 
from their exclusive effects, these polymers get adhered on 
the cell surface of bacteria and lead to the destruction of the 
bacterial cell [17]. Polymeric nanoparticles from amphiphilic 
lipopolysaccharides (N,N-methylene bisacryl amide and acrylamide) 
are derived that had an affinity towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Small-scale (40 nm) developed polymeric particles exhibited 
selective targeting efficiencies for meningitis and keratitis models 
at a dose of 5 mg/kg after intra-cerebroventricular administration 
[18]. Another meningococcal nanoparticle-containing vaccine was 
developed via containing meningococcal capsular polysaccharide 
(the main virulence factor in bacterial meningitis) that slowly 
delivered antigen at the infection site. The system was biocompatible, 
biodegradable and stable and could be stored as dry powder.
250 µg of developed polymeric nanoparticles were evaluated 
against DC2.4 dendritic cell line to analyze antigenicity and
cell maturation. Enhanced antigenicity for MHCI, MHC II and 
CD40,80, 86 in dendritic cells was achieved [19].
Cationic peptide-based antibiotics have the potential to combat 
multidrug-resistant bacteria, i.e., Streptococcus aureus, causative 
agent of meningitis. Positively charged peptides containing alpha 
or beta helices-like architectures show an affinity for negatively 
surfaced bacterial cells. These peptides can be modulated in self￾assembled micelle form that can readily cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and efficiently suppress bacterial growth at the 
infection site [20]. Polymeric micelles are potentially active and 
successful approach for the management of meningitis, cerebritis 
and other cerebral inflammations in the brain and the spinal cord. 
Self-assembled cholesterol-linked polyethylene glycol micelles 342 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
were fabricated and anchored with transcriptional activator 
peptide (TAT) to facilitate the efficient delivery of ciprofloxacin
across the BBB. Ultra-small spherical micelles (180 nm) exhibited 
sustained release of ciprofloxacin for 6 h in saline phosphate 
buffer, pH 7.4. Augmented uptake of formulated micelles via
human astrocytes was reported through confocal laser scanning 
microscopy that suggested rapid permeation of polymeric micelles 
across BBB for the alleviation of meningitis caused by bacterial 
species of Escherichia and Neisseria [21]. Pegylated self-assembled 
micelles embedded with bacitracin A were designed for the 
potential action against penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant 
pneumococcal meningitis caused by S. pneumonia. Rabies virus 
glycopeptides-29 (RVG, brain targeting peptide) and Pluronic 
P85 unimers (a p-glycoprotein inhibitor) were used to design 
self-assembled micelles. Superb cellular uptake and enhanced 
BBB permeation through brain capillary endothelial cells were 
by virtue of synergistic action of RVG and Pluronic P85 unimers. 
The developed micelles sufficiently accumulated in the brain
parenchyma, suppressed bacterial growth, performed receptor￾mediated transcytosis and deducted membrane microviscosity, 
thus showing potential antibacterial application for the effective 
management of pneumococcal meningitis [22]. Lipoid liposomes
are a favorable drug carrier for antimicrobial drug delivery in 
multidrug-resistant conditions. These vesicular systems can be 
conjugated easily with targeting templates including proteins, 
antibodies, enzymes and other bioactive agents. Liposomes not 
only facilitate localized delivery of the antimicrobial agent but also 
their superb stability ensures the safety of antibiotics from the 
adverse environment of the infection site. Prolonged distribution 
of antibiotics in the bloodstream, specific targeting and improved 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters favor 
liposomes for the treatment of meningitis via different routes of 
administration [23]. The functional ability of liposomes can be 
amplified through the conjugation of cell-penetrating peptides 
(TAT47–57). Bartomeu et al. (2016) designed spherical, small￾scale TAT47–57 functionalized fusogenic liposomes (100 nm)
encapsulated with different antibiotics such as methicillin, 
vancomycin and ampicillin to combat meningitis-causing bacterial 
pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli). Significant NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 343 
decrement in antibiotic MICs and total eradication of bacteria were 
observed when treated with functionalized methicillin liposomes. 
A cytotoxic study against BBB cellular components (astrocytes 
and endothelial cells) revealed promising effects by developed 
functionalized liposomes that suggested clinical applications
in meningitis [24]. Dendrimers are another effective drug
delivery strategy against bacterial meningitis. The star-shaped 
three-dimensional branched architecture of dendrimers offers 
conjugation of numerous antibiotics and bioactive therapeutics. 
Biocompatibility, low polydispersity index, high water solubility 
and exclusive outer and inner layers attract researchers for 
the functionalization and encapsulation of dendrimers for the 
management of neuro-infectious diseases [25].
Numerous studies on gold nanoparticles exhibited their high 
potential against the treatment of neurological disorders and 
central nervous system infections owing to their surface morphology, 
biocompatibility, surface affinity for several functional moieties
and ability to cross layers of the BBB [26]. Sub-colloidal gold
particles have shown high surface modification alternatives 
by the virtues of their tunable physicochemical properties. A variety 
of proteins can be adorned over their surface via electrostatic 
interactions and perform antipathogenic or antimicrobial 
functions [27]. Anwar et al. (2019) synthesized gold and silver 
nanoparticles embedded with novel bioactive agents such as 
hesperidin (flavonoid) and naringin (antimicrobial). The system 
was targeted against brain cells eating neuropathogens, i.e., 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. Green￾synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles were stabilized with 
plant gums acacia and tragacanth, respectively. Spherical and 
nanodimensional particles (100–250 nm) were cytocompatible
and exhibited preeminent bactericidal action while analyzed 
through anti-microbial assays [28, 29]. 
9.2.2 Urinary Tract Infection
Both Gram-negative (E. and K. pneumonia) and Gram-positive 
(Enterococcus faecalis and S. saprophyticus) bacteria are associated 
with urinary tract infections (UTIs). They enter through the 
gastrointestinal tract into the region of the urinary bladder  
344 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
and urethra and start to multiply there, resulting in full-blown 
infection. Anatomically, the female urethra is close to the vagina, 
hence sexually transmitted diseases (gonorrhea and herpes) 
may also lead to bacterial urethritis [30]. Globally, UTIs are the 
most common infections distressing more than 150 million 
patients annually. Frequent reoccurrences result in painful and 
critical conditions that may need bacteria-resistant antimicrobial 
medications. Particularly, lower UTI is prevalent in elderly patients 
and ignorance of this disease leads to serious complications 
such as septicemia and pyelonephritis [31]. Polymeric micro￾spheres were designed by Labbaf et al. (2013) by encapsulating 
a high dose of gentamycin sulfate antibiotic. Nontoxic 
polymethylsilsesquioxane was selected as a polymer owing to 
its high stability, compatibility, biodegradability and superior 
physicochemical properties. The formulation was prepared using 
the coaxial electrohydrodynamic method and has the potential 
to target Enterococcus faecalis after being delivered through a 
routine urinary catheter. The developed microcapsules contained 
fluorescent tracer dye and confirmed the release of antibiotic
into the cells of uropathogen at the site of the human bladder [32].
Kristian et al. (2021) developed a unique antimicrobial catheter 
from a silicon-derived interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). 
It worked like balloon material and aimed for the slow release 
of antibiotic at the site of the urinary bladder. The developed 
system targeted local urinary infections that were associated with 
frequent use of catheters in patients, developing biofilm and
other nosocomial infections. Antimicrobials, i.e., nitrofurazone 
and nitrofurantoin were loaded into the IPN worked as a reservoir 
and exhibited zero-order drug kinetics that significantly
diminished bacterial growth around the urinary bladder and 
destroyed the biofilm formed over the urinary catheter [33]. In 
an alternate approach, trimethoprim-embedded microparticles 
were designed to target uropathogen E. coli. Low-molecular￾weight PLGA 2300 (poly-D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) was used 
as a matrix material to depict a slow drug release pattern from
the developed microparticles. An initial burst release (30%) 
within 24 h followed by sustained effect for 2 days was observed 
that was desirable to eradicate colonies of bacteria at the bladder 
region [34]. Unusual ultrasound-activated lipid-based microbubbles NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 345 
were fabricated using a urothelial organoid model to release the 
antimicrobial agent into the apical cell cytoplasm. Initially, non￾cell permeant gentamicin and fluorescent dye were loaded in 
the liposomes. The formulated liposomes were adhered on to the 
gas-filled microbubbles and subjected to buffer simulation with the 
apical surface of bladder. The ultrasound-activated intracellular￾containing microbubbles were more efficient than traditional 
oral antibiotic regimens and thus have the potential for the safe 
delivery of high amounts of antibiotics into urothelial cells [35]. 
A nanoemulsion containing polyphenon 60 and curcumin was 
prepared to provide a combined effect against uropathogens, i.e., 
E. coli. To achieve efficient antibacterial effects and prevention 
of gastrointestinal enzyme degradation, the vaginal route was 
preferred to administer the medicament. The nanoemulsion system 
was developed by the ultrasonication method and optimized 
through the Box-Behnken drug design model. The nanoemulsion 
revealed an average globule size of 211 nm, minimum poly￾dispersity index (0.343), optimum stability (–32.7 mV) at 4°C and 
sustained permeation for 12 h. An in vivo study on Sprague-Dawley 
rats exhibited distribution of drugs, i.e., polyphenon 60 (3.07% 
per g) and curcumin (3.35% per gram) after 3 h and was found
effective for 12 h in the affected areas [36]. 
9.2.3 Gastrointestinal Tract Infection
Various bacterial species such as Salmonella, Escherichia, Listeria, 
Staphylococcus, and Clostridium frequently cause food-borne 
infections, including food poisoning. Other risk factors for gastric 
infections are undercooked meat (E. coli), contaminated water/
juice (Vibrio, Salmonella), unpasteurized dairy (Staphylococcus 
and Salmonella), unwashed raw vegetables and fruits (Shigella 
spp.) [37]. Helicobacter pylori is the most common bacterial 
pathogen causing gastritis, gastrointestinal ulcer and cancer. 
Enormous research and projects containing microspheres,
microbeads and gels are under way for the eradication of 
H. pylori [38]. Although Gram-negative H. pylori pathogens are 
highly sensitive to any single antibiotic, clinically their complete 
eradication rate is very slow. There are several explanations for 
this. The first one is the degradation or instability of various 346 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
antimicrobials in the acidic pH of the stomach. The second reason 
is the attainment of low concentration or low bioavailability 
of therapeutic to the bacteria. The third possibility is the low 
residence time of the dosage form in the pathogen-affected area of 
the gastrointestinal tract. Although multidrug therapy is advised, 
different adverse effects, poor patient compliance and high level 
of drug resistance are a few serious issues. Thus, drug delivery 
systems that are stable in the gastric region and extend the 
residence time of the drug with minimum side effects are 
appropriate to overcome gastritis and gastric ulcer. Myriad
formulations, including mucoadhesive, floating, expendable,
high-density and magnetic systems, are well suited for the 
management of bacterial infection in the stomach [39].
Gastroretentive floating gel beads are the most suitable drug 
delivery system for the complete elimination of pathogens from 
the gastric region. This dosage form offers a controlled-release 
pattern with sufficient residence time [40]. Various natural 
polymers, including sodium alginate, pectin, agar/agarose, chitosan 
and casein, are widely explored for the preparation of gel beads 
owing to their biocompatibility, nontoxicity and biodegradability 
features [41]. Salmonellosis, another gastric infection, occurs 
through food-borne enteropathogen Salmonella enterica. It is a 
Gram-negative facultative anaerobe and frequently causes 
gastrointestinal diseases. Annually, more than 150 million cases 
of gastroenteritis are reported worldwide with symptoms of 
stomach cramps and acute diarrhea [42]. Oral rehydration
therapy is advised in mild cases of salmonellosis, but antimicrobials 
and probiotics are recommended for severely ill, infants and 
immune-compromised patients [43].
Antimicrobials, including sulfonamides and quinolones, 
are systemically absorbed readily; hence, their insufficient 
concentration is retained at the enteric sites if given orally. 
Additionally, poorly absorbed oral antimicrobials (beta lactam 
antibiotics and aminoglycosides) provide prolonged localized 
action but may alter the balance of gut flora (microbiome) and 
allow the overgrowth of other opportunistic bacteria [44]. To 
sort out these issues Mu et al. (2019) have introduced pathogen￾targeting glycovesicles for the alleviation of gastroenteritis
caused by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (active in both NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 347 
humans and animals). They conjugated xylo-oligosaccharides
with long-chain fatty acid through bridging with disulfide bonds.
The resultant conjugate was an amphiphilic, self-assembled 
molecule that has a tendency to generate H2S-triggered
antimicrobial (ciprofloxacin) at the infected site. The system 
was biocompatible, stable and safe for oral administration. The
disulfide bond is important while developing reduction￾responsive dosage forms as the bond can easily degrade by H2S 
produced by sulfate-reducing pathogens including H. pylori, 
S. enterica, Fusobacterium and Enterobacter. Thus, the developed 
H2S-responsive glycovesicles worked both as cargo to release 
antimicrobial and prebiotic xylo-oligosaccharides at the infection 
site [45]. Polymeric nanoplexes have been synthesized via 
admixing polycationic gentamicin with macromolecular block 
copolymers through electrostatic interaction. Polyethylene oxide￾b-sodium acrylate and polyethylene oxide-b-sodium methacrylate 
were individually mixed with PAA before complexing with 
gentamicin. The resulting nanoplexes were nanodimensional 
(90–120 nm) and stable (zeta potential –11 to –17 mV). An in vivo 
study revealed a reduced number of viable salmonella pathogens 
at the infection site [46]. Ciprofloxacin-embedded lipid-coated 
mesoporous silica nanoparticles have been developed for the 
management of intracellular eradication of enteritis-causing 
Salmonella bacteria. The average particle size of lipid-coated 
mesoporous silica particles was in the nano range (50–100 nm)
with 5 nm thickness. Developed lipid-coated nanoparticles
exhibited lesser cytotoxicity and enhanced antibacterial activity 
compared to non-lipid-coated mesoporous silica particles. After 
oral administration, the data obtained from confocal microscopy 
suggested improvement in intravacuolar targeting owing to the 
lipoidal surface and augmented eradication of viable cells of
pathogens at a lower dose of antibiotic ciprofloxacin [47]. 
Salmonella serotypes are accountable for food-borne infections
and are associated with meat products and pet foods [48]. Kumar 
et al. (2020) explored the antimicrobial use of pelargonic acid 
present in tomatoes. Pelargonic acid-loaded microemulsion was 
prepared with different surfactants such as TritonX100, Tween 80, 
Quillaja and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Thereafter, formed micelles 
were evaluated for antimicrobial action against three pathogens, 348 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
i.e., Salmonella, Typhimurium and Oranienburg. In vitro study
reflected that microemulsion containing sodium dodecyl sulfate 
exhibited the lowest MIC for Salmonella Newport (7.82 mM) [49]. 
Enterotoxigenic E. coli is a proven fatal cause of diarrhea that 
leads to morbidity and mortality in socioeconomic communities. 
Intestinal gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation are mostly 
associated with E. coli [50]. Poor oral bioavailability, systemic 
toxicity and developed multidrug resistance create issues for 
antibiotic administration. To overcome these shortcomings
nanocarrier-based drug delivery approaches are recommended. 
Paudel et al. (2021) investigated enrofloxacin-embedded polymeric 
nanoparticles of PLGA (poly(lactide-co-glycolide)) and lignin￾grafted PLGA. Synthesized spherical particles of each polymer 
were nanodimensional (approximately 111–117 nm) and 
biocompatible. The polymeric nanoparticles have the potential 
to prevent more than 50% bacterial infection than bare antibiotic 
(enrofloxacin) while tested against IPEC-J2 cells. Additionally,
a 25% higher inhibition of bacterial growth was observed owing 
to particle uptake through endocytosis. Further, sustained release 
of drug from polymeric nanoparticles suggested the prevention 
of rapid E. coli growth inside the cells [51]. Nuria et al. (2021) 
developed pH-responsive targeted and controlled delivery
of narrow-spectrum bacteriocins (protein) to alleviate E. coli 
from the lower gastrointestinal tract. Colicin E9/Ia or plasmid￾encoded bacteriocin is very toxic to strains of E. coli and other 
related pathogens. To protect from the degradation in the upper 
gastric region and enable the controlled release of colicin E9/Ia,
pH-responsive hydrogel microcapsules with nontoxic alginic
acid were designed via the membrane emulsification method. 
Encapsulation ensured the safe delivery of bioactive colicin in 
the lower tract of the gastrointestinal tract in the murine E. coli 
colonization model. The microencapsulation of antibiotic colicin 
has the potential to decolonize gut microbiota particularly
multidrug-resistant dominant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens [52]. 
9.2.4 Vaginal Infection
Vaginal infection or bacterial vaginosis is a common health issue, 
often reported in females at their reproductive age. It occurs due NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 349 
to vaginal microflora dysbiosis where one or more microorganisms 
are dominant to the others in that region [53, 54]. Women at the 
age of 40 or higher are vulnerable to vaginosis due to less release 
of estrogen, which affects the living environment of the bacteria 
Lactobacillus. Off-white discharge, itching and a burning sensation 
with a fishy smell are prominent symptoms of bacterial vaginosis 
[55]. A healthy vagina preserves the bacteria Lactobacillus, which 
is accountable for the production of lactic acid and maintains 
acidity there. The acidic environment protects from other 
invaders in the region of the vagina. The overgrowth of pathogenic 
microflora including species of Staphylococcus, Mycoplasma, 
Gardnerella and Peptostreptococcus leads to the imbalance of 
the acidic milieu of the vagina, resulting in vaginal infection [56]. 
Topically administered metronidazole has been the preferred 
antibacterial agent against bacterial vaginosis over the last decade. 
Although its gel, cream, suppositories and lavages are widely
accepted, the prolonged drug release pattern is not established. 
To modify the local efficiency of metronidazole, mucoadhesive 
tablets were prepared with a blend of bioadhesive polymers such 
as chitosan FG90C, polycarbophil PCPAA1 and polyvinylpyrrolidone 
(PVPK90). The developed mucoadhesive tablets displayed a 
controlled release of metronidazole at the infection site [57].
Alqahtami et al. (2020) developed chitosan nanoparticles to 
explore their antimicrobial action against the bacterial pathogen 
Neisseria gonorrhea, a Gram-negative bacteria causing sexually 
transmitted infections. Globally, more than 106 million new cases 
of this pathogen are reported annually; the pathogen colonizes
the mucosal tissues of the urethra, rectum and upper genital regions 
in women [58]. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared via the 
emulsion gelation method and evaluated for the average particle 
size and zeta potential on varying the chitosan concentration 
from 1 to 5 mg/ml. The data obtained showed that on increasing 
the chitosan concentration, the average particle diameter and the 
zeta potential increased from 193 to 530 nm and 14 to 20 mV, 
respectively. Additionally, mucoadhesive chitosan particles were 
effective not only against various multidrug-resistant species of 
Neisseria but also were cytocompatible for HeLa cells at lower
a concentration (less than 2.5 mg/ml) [59]. 350 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
Further, silver nanoparticles were developed that significantly 
reduced the colony of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhea itself. 
Thereafter, silver nanoparticles (120 nm) were combined with 
cefmetazole to provide an additive effect at the infection site.
Both silver nanoparticles and their amalgamation with antibiotic 
exhibited potent action on bacterial cell integrity (MIC 12.5 µg/ml)
and did not produce adverse effects or cytotoxicity for human 
epithelial and fibroblast cells [60]. Tugcu-Demiroz et al. (2020) 
very first studied the efficacy of metronidazole-embedded PVP 
(Polyvinyl pyrrolidone) nanofibers for the management of infection 
at the site of the female genital organ. The prime features of these 
nanofibers including mucoadhesion, biocompatibility and high drug 
permeability offered potential usage for efficient metronidazole 
activity compared to bare gel or solution [61]. Thereafter, 
benzydamine (antiseptic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic) and 
chitosan nanoparticles were loaded in the polymeric PVP nanofibers 
and compared its efficiency with their hydroxy propylmethyl 
cellulose (HPMC) gels and evaluated against different pathogens 
causing vaginal infections. Controlled and prolonged drug delivery, 
sufficient mechanical strength, hydrophilicity and mucoadhesive 
property displayed superiority of fabricated nanofibers compared 
to conventional remedies [62]. 
9.2.5 Skin Infection
Topical infections such as leprosy, cellulitis, boils and impetigo 
are the most common infections caused by bacterial pathogens. 
Among them, leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, covers considerable 
percentage of the world’s population [63]. Instead of advanced 
socioeconomic status of developing countries, it is still considered 
as endemic in many areas of America and South Asia. In 2019, 
India, Indonesia, and Brazil reported more than a thousand 
new cases of leprosy [64]. Leprosy is caused by the bacterial
pathogen Mycobacterium leprae and is characterized as chronic 
granulomatous on the skin and peripheral nerves. Multi-drug
therapy (MDT) has been widely recommended worldwide as an 
efficient treatment against leprosy. However, several adverse
effects and drug resistance are significant issues with MDT. NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 351 
Frequently prescribed conventional antileprotic dosages
containing dopamine and clofazimine display slow dissolution 
in the gastrointestinal tract and poor or limited bioavailability
hence novel dosages including nanocarriers are required [65]. A 
liposomal drug delivery system containing clofazimine cholesterol 
and phosphotidyl choline was prepared to modify residence
time at the site of infection and reduced the treatment time for 
leprosy. The system was aimed for local delivery and hence avoided 
systemic absorption. Both liposomal gel and its suspension were 
stable at body, refrigerator and room temperatures [66]. Polymeric 
nanoparticles containing PLGA-clofazimine were developed as a 
promising tool to manage leprosy. The system improved solubility 
and bioavailability and minimized associated adverse effects. 
PLGA–clofazimine nanoparticles were spherical, nanodimensional 
and exhibited a controlled-release pattern. Cell viability study 
of developed nanoparticles did not expose intrinsic clofazimine 
toxicity performed against Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells. After oral 
administration, these PLGA-clofazimine nanoparticles represented 
a potential platform to alleviate stubborn bacterial pathogens 
with improved bioavailability and patient compliance [67]. Solid 
dispersion containing clofazimine and hypromellose phthalate 
was prepared to modify solubility and drug loading capacity. 
Formulated solid dispersion exhibited proton transfer between 
clofazimine and polymer hypromellose phthalate that mediated 
the amorphous form and augmented solubility of the preparation 
[68]. Alike clofazimine, dapsone also shows poor bioavailability 
and nonspecific distribution in the vital organs including skin, 
kidney and liver. That leads to serious undesirable effects. 
Enormous dosage forms including niosomes, bilosomes, polymeric 
nanocapsules, lipid nanocarriers embedded with dapsones have 
been reported in the past decade [69]. In this series, covalently 
bonded polymer-dapsone conjugate was developed that exhibited 
controlled pharmacokinetics with efficient therapeutic value. 
Acrylic functional groups of macromolecular chains of hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate, HEMA polymer offer covalent functionalization 
with dapsone molecule. The formed stable conjugate showed 
superior anti-inflammatory activity against bacterial pathogens 
and was hence suggested for clinical application in leprosy [70]. 352 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
El-Nabarawi et al. (2018) discussed potential applications of novel 
vesicles invasomes that have enhanced percutaneous permeation. 
Dapsone-loaded invasomes with phosphatidylcholine, terpenes
and ethanol were formulated through the thin-film hydration 
technique. Several terpenes including cineol, citral, limonene and 
fenchone were explored for improving dapsone retention on the 
skin. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as drug deposition and 
area under the curve (AUC) of dapsone-loaded invasomes and 
dapsone solution were compared. Both drug deposition and AUC 
of dapsone-loaded invasomes were high approximately 2.5 and
2 times compared to conventional dapsone solution respectively 
[71]. Chen et al. (2018) utilized mesoporous silica as a nanocarrier 
the for delivery of poorly soluble clofazimine to treat multidrug￾resistant tuberculosis and leprosy. FDA-approved food additive 
acetophenone was added that modified the loading of poorly soluble 
antibiotic (clofazimine) into the mesoporous silica nanocarrier
and facilitated the release from pores also. Developed nanocarrier￾based drug delivery systems exhibited dose-dependent anti￾bacterial action against bacterial pathogen-infected macrophages 
[72].
Cellulitis is a deep skin infection often caused by Streptococcus 
pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus. Skin breakage, trauma or 
surgeries invite pathogens for infection [73]. For the management 
of deep skin infection or cellulitis, elastic liposomes and their 
gels have been formulated using hydrophilic neomycin sulfate, 
Phospholipon® 90G, Tween 80/Span 80 and carbopol. The stability 
of elastic liposomes and elastic liposome-containing gels was 
reported for 14 days and 2 months, respectively. Outcomes of 
confocal laser scanning microscopy suggested deep penetration 
(180 µm) and enhanced deposition (~26%) of neomycin sulfate 
in the rat skin on 24 h. Histological findings described efficient 
eradication of Staphylococcus aureus localized in stratum corneum 
through elastic liposomes within 7 days [74]. Nitric oxide￾releasing nanoparticles have been developed for the mitigation
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSRA) colonized
in the wounded area. MSRA is a common threat for both invasive 
and superficial infections primarily associated with hospital
settings. Prepared nanoparticles displayed accelerated antibacterial NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 353 
action against the MSRA-affected wound model. Histological
studies revealed minimum MSRA pathogen burden, minimum 
inflammation and less collagen degradation after treatment with 
nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticles [75]. Electrospun nanofibers 
are versatile drug delivery scaffolds owing to their superior 
architecture that mimics the extracellular matrix of the cell. 
These scaffolds are promising therapy for wound healing,
potentiate absorption of released exudates, allow transportation 
of gaseous exchange and proficiently diminish bacterial load at 
the site of infection. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric 
(Polycaprolactone/collagen) nanofibers containing gentamicin or 
clindamycin have been fabricated for the effective differentiation 
of human dermal fibroblast at the site of the wound. The novel 
fabricated antibiotic scaffolds have great utility for cell proliferation, 
infection mitigation and skin grafting for wound healing and 
tissue engineering [76]. 
9.2.6 Oral Cavity Infection
The human oral cavity is an integral part of the digestive system
with multifaceted anatomical structures. Complexed bacterial 
colonies exist all around teeth, mucosal layer, bones (maxillary/
mandibular) and periodontal tissues that account for oral health. 
This ecological niche prevents pathogenic growth and maintains 
the balance of microecology in the oral cavity [77]. The 
composition of microbiota present in the oral cavity may be 
altered due to poor or ignored oral hygiene, imbalanced diet 
and diseased state that create oral infectious ailments such as 
dental caries, periodontitis and peri-implantitis [78]. Dong et al. 
(2017) explored pH-dependent silver nanoparticles releasing 
titanium implant for the effective eradication of pathogenic
Gram-positive and Gram-negative causing peri-implant infections. 
Antimicrobial strategies are far from satisfactory as control 
delivery cannot be maintained. At the time of peri-implant infection, 
the pH decreases below 5.5 hence pH-dependent controlled 
drug delivery from the surface of the implant is required. Silver 
nanoparticles grafted titania nanotube structured implants were 
designed with low pH sensitive acetal linker for the management 354 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
of oral infection. The system was efficacious at pH 5.5 and released 
a high dose of silver nanoparticles (broad spectrum) hence, robust 
antimicrobial and osteoinductive actions were displayed [79].

the management of oral infections caused by bacteria.

Maurya et al. 2019 designed a localized drug delivery
system containing Eudragit RS 100-coated pectin microspheres

caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Periodontal diseases are 
identified by degradation of teeth, bones, periodontal ligaments, 
dental cementum followed by severe inflammation of subgingival  
NDDS for the Management of Bacterial Infections 355 
plaque. Moxifloxacin microspheres were formulated via the 
emulsion dehydration method. Superb drug entrapment efficiency 
(80%) and drug release (90%) in phosphate buffer pH 6.8
suggested prolonged localized antimicrobial action with high 
patient compliance [86]. Periodontitis, an inflammatory condition 
around teeth supporting tissues can be alleviated by the 
removal of plaque and stayed microorganisms there. Localized
antimicrobial therapy is recommended for effective antimicrobial 
action. A competent and safe locally administered minocycline 
microspheres have been prepared that were clinically trialed 
on 748 periodontitis sufferers. The antimicrobial action was 
dependent on smoking status, gender, age and diseased condition. 
Outcomes suggested the potential usage of minocyclin micro￾spheres along scaling and root planing in periodontitis patients 
[87]. 
9.2.7 Pulmonary Infections
Bacteria such as S. pneumonia, S. aureus, K. pneumonia, H. influenza 
and P. aeruginosa get adhered to the pulmonary mucous layer and 
have strong efficiency to form biofilm there that creates resistance
to antimicrobial agents [88]. Few of them are extracellular and 
primarily adhere in the extracellular fluid, tissue fluid and blood 
lymphocytic fluid and ingest nutrients for their growth and 
multiplication [89]. Localized inhalation preparations administered 
through the pulmonary route effectively manage pulmonary
infections caused by bacteria. Several nebulizers, pulmonary 
metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), dry powdered inhalers (DPIs) 
and soft mist inhalers are recommended for the eradication of 
stubborn mucosal adhered pathogens. Delivered smaller droplets 
from an inhaler device cover the maximum infected affected 
surface and kill bacterial pathogens [90]. pMDI and DPI are 
most frequently prescribed to people with pulmonary infection.
pMDIs are a pressurized system where antimicrobial drugs are 
dissolved or dispersed in single or mixed propellants. On the other 
hand, DPIs are in the dry form and do not necessitate the addition 
of propellants and cold chain storage conditions. Physicochemical 
(particle size, shape, mechanism of drug release, flow behavior, 356 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
solubility, pH and osmolarity), pharmacokinetic (absorbance, 
clearance and bioavailability) and device-based parameters (type 
of device, flow rate and breath pattern) are prominent factors
that affect therapeutic efficacy of antimicrobial agent at the 
infected site [91]. Srichana et al. (2016) compared the drug delivery 
performance of Aeronide inhaler (pressurized metered dose
inhaler) and Pulmicort Turbuhaler (dry powder inhaler) against 
mild to moderate pulmonary infections and asthma. Budesonide
was used as a model drug and aerodynamic particle size and 
spirometer parameters including forced vital capacity, forced 
expiratory volume and peak expiratory flow rate were analyzed. 
Both the device systems provided uniform performances and no 
significant differences in the frequency of bronchodilation, urinary 
cortisol and other spirometric parameters were observed [92]. 
Different drug delivery systems including polymeric nanoparticles, 
liposomes, micelles, solid lipid nanocarriers, dendrimers and 
gene therapies are well established for the controlled and targeted 
release of antimicrobial agents to cure pulmonary bacterial 
infections. Polymeric nanoparticles loaded with tobramycin￾alginate/chitosan were developed for the treatment and 
prevention of mucosa adhered P. aeruginosa in the case of 
cystic fibrosis. To enhance penetration of developed polymeric 
nanoparticles, functionalization with dornase alfa was carried out 
which exhibited dose-dependent efficacy against P. aeruginosa 
PA01. The novel system demonstrated the development of 
clinically effective antimicrobial nanoparticles that have the 
potential for mucus penetration, localized action with minimum 
adverse effects [93]. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) containing 
rifabutin, mannitol and trehalose have been designed for effective 
eradication of M. tuberculosis via pulmonary administration. 
Prepared aerodynamic SLNs were capable of reaching the alveolar 
region and targeting adhered pathogens there. The formulation 
was delivered in dry form into the deep lung where rifabutin 
encapsulated SLNs reached the target site within 15–30 min.
The enhanced antimycobacterial activity in the murine model 
suggested a potential clinical application of developed SLNs for 
the treatment of pathogen M. tuberculosis [94]. Isoniazid-loaded 
microparticles and polymeric (poly-ε-caprolactone) microparticles 
were synthesized and evaluated against drug-resistant Novel Drug Delivery for the Management of Viral Infections 357 
M. tuberculosis bacterium. Histological examination revealed 
a significantly higher accumulation of released isoniazid from 
both dosage forms into the alveolar macrophages. Nitric acid 
was also produced, which was not toxic to healthy cells. Further,
hepatotoxicity was determined via SGOT (serum glutamate 
transferase) and SGPT (serum glutamate pyruvate transferase) 
which indicated safe drug delivery from microparticles. Thus, both 
systems exhibited potential for the management of tuberculosis 
[95]. Table 9.2 outlines the utility of NDDS for the alleviation of 
myriad pulmonary bacterial infections.

9.3 Novel Drug Delivery for the Management
of Viral Infections
The major concern associated with the viral infection is fast 
replication in the host cell, which can have a deleterious effect
on any part of the host cell. Figure 9.3 compiles different viral
pathogens and their devastating infections in humans. 358 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
Figure 9.3 Different viral infections and their causative agents. Novel Drug Delivery for the Management of Viral Infections 359 
Although oral and parental formulations have been utilized 
for the management of viral infections several shortcomings 
associated with them like first-pass metabolism, reduced clinical 
efficacy and bioavailability of antiviral drugs have paved the 
way for the usage of novel drug delivery approaches to minimize 
the adverse effects and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of
antiviral drugs [101]. 
9.3.1 Respiratory Infections
Respiratory viruses are the most common causative agents that 
are responsible for diseases in humans which have a significant 
effect on the health of an individual. Several virus families are 
responsible for human transmission at the global level. Respiratory 
tract infecting viruses include influenza virus, rhinovirus, and the 
most recent pandemic that has brought the entire world to a halt; 
coronavirus [102]. The majority of viruses can cause potential 
damage to the lungs; so pulmonary drug delivery is the first 
choice of the treatment regimen. Although the pulmonary route 
offers benefits like avoidance of first-pass metabolism and high 
bioavailability structural characteristics of lungs and the presence 
of biological barriers resist the utilization of conventional dosage 
forms and have subsequently led to the usage of novel delivery 
systems like nanoparticles, niosomes, liposomes, etc. Influenza, 
commonly referred to as “the flu”, may vary from mild to severe
and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, 
headache, coughing, and fatigue. It may lead to pneumonia,
supported by subsequent bacterial infection. Other complications 
are acute respiratory diseases, asthma and associated cardio￾vascular ailments. Various drugs and vaccines have been used for 
the management of influenza, but still, the drugs have failed to
show ideal efficacy. There are several factors responsible for 
decreased drug effect, like the emergence of the resistant viral
strain, poor drug solubility, and poor permeability of the drug 
across biological barriers. The development of novel formulations 
for the management of influenza can be of aid in reducing 
unfavorable public health and social impact [103]. Virus-like 
particles (VLPs) are spherical supramolecular assemblies produced 
by the expression of the viral envelope or capsid proteins. VLPs 360 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
show resemblance to the natural assemblies of the antigenic 
epitopes of their corresponding viruses, but may lack any infectious 
genetic material. This characteristic property of VLPs allows
the immune system to recognize VLPs similar to the original virus
to promote phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells, thereby, 
offering protection against multiple influenza virus serotypes 
via induction of humoral and cellular immune responses [104]. 
Microcapsules have been widely demonstrated as a useful 
tool for the management of influenza infection. Layer-by-layer
assembled hollow polyelectrolyte microcapsules possess
biomimetic properties and features like shape, size, thickness, 
and ability to incorporate several types of biomolecules that 
allow their utilization in the management of influenza [105]. 
Microparticles are novel formulations that can help deliver 
vaccines through the oral route. Owing to their small size (1 to 
1000 μm), microparticles can have the potential for delivering
the drug through the pulmonary route [106]. Dendrimers are 
another type of nano-drug delivery system that has been explored 
for their ability to deliver antigenic molecules for the management 
of influenza. Dendrimers are three-dimensional, branched, and 
star-shaped delivery systems that have unique features such as
good water solubility, good biocompatibility, and low poly￾dispersity index [107]. Dendrimer encapsulating various antigens
has been found to elicit powerful antibody and T-cell responses 
against the influenza H1N1 virus [108]. Polymeric nanoparticles 
are often utilized in the delivery of anti-influenza drugs and 
vaccines. These are beneficial due to their biodegradability and 
biocompatibility, as well as, the ability to incorporate various
drugs and antigens.
Another, rhinovirus affects the human population and is 
associated with the common cold. The virus possesses the ability 
to proliferate at 33–35°C; which corresponds to the temperature
of the nose. The infection is transmitted either as aerosols or in 
the form of fomites, direct person-to-person contact can also be 
a cause of transmission of the virus [109]. Organic nanoparticles 
are the most extensively researched type of nanoparticle for 
the delivery of antiviral drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles exhibit 
colloidal properties with sizes ranging from 10 to 1000 nm. The 
small particle size facilitates capillary penetration and uptake Novel Drug Delivery for the Management of Viral Infections 361 
by cells resulting in increased concentrations of drug at target 
sites [110]. Incorporation of antiviral drugs in micelles for 
the treatment of viral infection is one of the appealing nano￾technologies that impart the dual property of enhancing the 
water solubility of the poorly soluble drug and also improving the 
stability of same. An additional positive attribute associated with 
micelles is that they demonstrate a slow dissociation rate and 
thus result in longer retention time and accumulation of drug at 
target sites [111].
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, 
earlier referred as 2019-nCoV. Currently, there is no standard 
drug or vaccine available for the treatment; therefore, repurposing 
existing drugs using NDDS is the only solution [112]. Although
the usage of strategies like repurposing drugs, providing
symptomatic treatments, and adopting alternative systems
have been of help in management to a lesser extent; there is an 
urgent need of designing an effective option that incorporates
the combined properties of both diagnostic as well as a therapeutic 
agent. Such an approach is likely to be mentioned as theranostics 
could be a potential approach to resist the spread of coronavirus 
[113]. Recent studies have revealed that theranostic drug
therapies of chloroquine have resulted in effective in vitro 
inhibition of novel coronavirus [114]. Chen et al. (2020) formulated 
Lanthanide-doped polystyrene nanoparticles that proved to 
be effective in detecting anti-SRV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum, 
which could be of help in tracking COVID-19 progression [115]. 
Vesicular drug delivery systems like liposomes, polymersomes,
gold nanoparticles, and peptide-based vesicles exhibit desired 
properties that make them suitable carriers for delivering
drugs. These vesicular drug delivery systems control the fate of 
drug molecules by controlling the release kinetics, increasing 
bioavailability, and reducing the side effects of the drug [116]. 
9.3.2 Hepatitis
Viral hepatitis is one of the common causes of chronic liver 
infection. The liver is an essential part of the body that performs 
several functions like detoxification, and protein synthesis, 
and serves as a site for several biochemical reactions. A patient 362 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
suffering from chronic liver disease requires immediate treatment 
and that too for a prolonged duration to sustain life. Prolonged 
exposure to drugs and nonspecificity of conventional dosage forms 
for hepatocytes/nonparenchymal cells are often accomplished 
with off-target interactions that limit the use of the same for 
the fabrication of novel targeted delivery systems that could 
specifically deliver the drug at the target site [117]. A lot of 
progress has been done in designing new and safe vaccines for the 
treatment of hepatitis; however, the major setback with the 
currently available vaccines is the induction of humoral immune 
response, three-dose schedule, storage issues, and economic 
constraints related to pilot plant scale-up. To overcome the 
flaws nanotechnology-based formulations are explored as a new
platform. The development of nano-based formulations can 
display good patient compliance [118]. Nanoparticles, owing to 
their small size of < 1000 nm are easily taken up by the phagocytic 
cells, antigen-presenting cells, and mucosa-associated lymphoid 
tissues; the nanoparticles facilitate antigen recognition and 
presentation. The generally used vaccine delivery systems are 
liposomes, nanoemulsions, nanospheres, and polymer-based
nanoparticles, several nano-/microparticles formulations have 
been approved by FDA (Decapeptyl®, Lupron Depot®, Nutropin 
Depot®, Zoladex®, etc.). Jaganathan and Vyas formulated surface￾modified DL-lactide/glycolide copolymer (PLGA) microspheres 
employing chitosan for nasal immunization using recombinant 
HBsAg. These modified PLGA microspheres exhibited humoral 
and cellular immune responses upon nasal administration [119]. A 
novel version of the liposome/niosome system is the evolution of 
bilosomes, which are nonionic surfactant vesicles with bile salts. 
The nanoformulation offered stability after oral administration
of an immunogen, and also prompted antibody titers. These 
formulations are so stable, that the requirement for a “cold chain” 
supply is also not mandatory [120]. 
9.3.3 Sexually Transmitted Viral Infections
Sexually transmitted viral infections have reached the stage where 
they are considered an epidemic and are responsible for global 
health concerns. Infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), Novel Drug Delivery for the Management of Viral Infections 363 
papillomaviruses (HPV), and HIV are the predominant virally 
transmitted venereal diseases that are generally incurable [121]. 
In the case of sexually transmitted viral infections, the causative 
pathogen displays a diverse mode of transmission, symptoms, and 
treatment. 
Multiple reasons hinder the development of antiviral agents; 
the fact that viruses are obligate parasites, i.e., they require a host 
cell for replication; therefore only a few virus-specific metabolic 
functions are targeted by antiviral agents without hampering 
the host cell. Another challenge with antiviral molecules is the 
physicochemical and biopharmaceutical aspects of the drug.
The novel formulations of the nano range display characteristic
properties like small size, high surface-to-volume ratio, and 
modifiable surfaces which make them a potential carrier for
antiviral drugs in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.
Herpes simplex virus infection, globally known as herpes, is 
primarily caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 types. HSV-1 is responsible
for oral infection, while HSV-2 is a cause of genital herpes. HSV-2 
infection can be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, however,
in severe cases; the herpes infection shows the occurrence 
of blisters or ulcers in genital areas [122]. Seth et al. (2004)
formulated idoxuridine-loaded liposomal gel by the reverse￾phase evaporation method. The findings of the study revealed
increased efficiency of topical liposomal gel in comparison to the 
plain liposome. The enhanced drug retention and permeation 
through the skin resulted in the effective treatment of HSV-2 
infection [123]. Acyclovir is pharmacologically active against
HSV-2. The conventional formulation like cream of acyclovir
confers the problem of poor penetration of the drug via stratum 
corneum and thereby increases the frequency of application of the 
cream. The issue was overcome by developing microemulsions
of acyclovir that can improve the stability of active molecules 
as well as increment in flux and permeation coefficient [124]. 
Microspheres of Acyclovir formulated by cross-linking method with 
acrylamide, dextran, chitosan, and glutaraldehyde demonstrated 
prolonged release of the drug, which proved its better efficacy in 
comparison to the conventional formulation [125].
Another, human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus 
belonging to the Papillomaviridae family. The virus is responsible 364 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
for the cause of human papillomavirus infection. About 90% of
the cases tend to show no symptoms and the situation resolves 
within two years of infection. In severe cases, warts and 
precancerous lesions are observed that can cause cancer in 
affected areas like the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, mouth, and
throat [126]. Concerning the treatment of HPV infection two 
strategies are mainly employed: drug-based and non-drug-based. 
The drug-based treatment involves the employment of drugs like 
5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, acyclovir, and immunomodulators while 
the non-drug-based treatment is based on the use of cryotherapy, 
laser techniques, and CO2. Problems like a reoccurrence of infection 
and scar hyperplasia are associated with the above-described 
treatment strategies, as the solution to the above-mentioned 
problem novel formulations came into existence for the treatment 
of HPV infection. Nanotechnology has played a key role in the 
diagnosis of cervical cancer caused by HPV, Zehbe et al. (1997)
first realized the application of gold nanoparticles in the diagnosis
of cervical cancer, and their study also demonstrated that the 
diagnostic technique involving gold nanoparticles is more accurate 
in diagnosis when compared with polymerase chain reaction 
method [127].
Development of hyperbranched copolymers by utilizing poly 
(amideamine) (PAMAM, G0) and poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE)
has been reported. The fabricated hyperbranched copolymer 
was used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 to target the HPV16 E7, which 
subsequently led to enhanced cellular uptake of plasmid and 
increased frequency of gene editing. Kampel et al. (2021) fabricated 
cationic lipid nanoparticles with the intent to deliver a gene
(small interfering RNA against HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins) for 
the treatment of HPV infection. Surface modification of lipid 
nanoparticles with epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies 
reflected significant suppression of xenograft tumors in mice 
[128]. A biomimetic dual drug delivery system was designed that 
encapsulated paclitaxel and siRNS as a target for E7. With the aid
of HeLa cell membranes camouflage, the biomimetic system
results in the avoidance of immune system activation and leads 
to enhanced accumulation of drugs in tumor cells that hinder the 
growth of tumor tissues. Novel Drug Delivery for the Management of Viral Infections 365 
Further, HIV disease is associated with AIDS, one of the major 
health concerns worldwide in the 21st century. HIV upon invasion 
in the mucosal membrane weakens the immune system which 
results in rendering the body more susceptible to the attack of 
different microbes. Several antiretroviral drugs are available on
the market in the present scenario that has the potential to 
prolong the life span of HIV-infected patients. The prime challenges 
offered by the antiretroviral drugs include poor solubility, limited 
controlled release, low permeability, and less bioavailability; to 
resolve the mentioned issues, nanoscale drug delivery technologies 
are employed to design therapeutically efficient formulations 
of active molecules [129]. Various nano-range formulations are 
utilized in the treatment of HIV infection, including liposomes, 
dendrimers, nanocrystals, nanoparticles, and polymeric micelles. 
Oussoren et al. (1999) developed a liposomal drug delivery 
system for Zalcitabine. The results of the studies performed in the 
murine acquired immune deficiency model provided evidence
of improved chemical stability, enhanced retention, and reduced 
viral load in both spleen and bone marrow [130]. Clayton et al. 
(2009) fabricated stealth immunoliposomes of HIV-1 protease 
inhibitor coated with Fab fragments of HIV-gp120-directed
monoclonal antibody F105. The immunoliposomal formulation 
showed increased and prolonged antiviral activity as compared 
to the free drug and the drug entrapped in plain liposomes [131]. 
Nanoparticles have been explored as a delivery system that is 
used as a promising carrier for drug delivery of drugs capable 
of improving pre-exposure prophylaxis. Mandal et al. (2017) 
formulated nanoparticles of emtricitabine and demonstrated 
improved bioavailability of the drug with significantly low 
inhibitory concentration [132]. Dendrimers are synthetic
macromolecules that are characterized by their highly branched 
structure; they are also referred to as nanocontainers owing to 
their small size and ability to entrap drugs inside them. These 
specifically designed carriers are used as a tool for targeted drug 
delivery. Poly(propyleneimine) dendrimer-based nanocontainers 
for targeting efavirenz to Mo/Mac were designed by Dutta et al. 
(2007). The results of the study indicated that the dendrimers 
possess the potential as a carrier and can alter the efficacy and 
toxicity of the drug [133]. 366 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
9.3.4 Encephalitis
Encephalitis is an acute, diffused inflammatory infection of 
the brain that is primarily caused by HSV types 1 and 2, varicella￾zoster virus, and enteroviruses. In usual instances, the infection 
with the herpes virus is accomplished with cold sores but under 
severe circumstances, the inflammation in the brain occurs that 
is responsible for the mortality ratio associated with herpes 
infection. Brain disorders are the major quagmire for health and 
demand the development of strategies that augment the ability
to cross the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BSCFB) 
as they protect the central nervous system from exogenous 
molecules and create obstacles in the treatment of brain 
disorders, the efflux across the barriers is regulated by P-gp, so it’s
inhibition is required for penetration of drug across BBB and
BSCFB. In recent years, nanoformulations emerged as a pivotal 
option for altering the delivery of the active molecules to the 
brain. The advancement in nanotechnology has manifested its 
applications in diagnosis as well as treatment of brain disorders, 
by specifically delivering the drug to its site of action. As an
attribute of small size nanoparticles are reported to enhance the 
efficacy of drugs. Graverini et al. (2018) performed a study by 
incorporating andrographolide (a neuroprotective drug) in SLNs. 
The results of the study revealed that SLNs potentially improve
the penetration of drugs across BBB as compared to free 
drugs [134]. Micelles are vesicles of size ranging from 10 to 100 nm. 
The vesicles have drawn the attention of researchers as a 
suitable carrier for the delivery of drugs to the CNS. Micelles are 
of two types depending on the composition: nonpolymeric micelles 
(amphiphilic surfactants) and polymeric micelles (amphiphilic 
copolymers). The vesicles have a core and shell structure in which 
the inner core is hydrophobic and the outer shell is hydrophilic. 
The external shell offers stability to the carrier in an aqueous 
environment and protection from the reticuloendothelial system, 
the shell is also responsible for promoting the accumulation of 
micelles in leaky vasculature. Micelles are associated with the 
delivery of low molecular mass active pharmaceutical ingredients
to the brain by the virtue of improved solubility and stability in 
plasma [135]. Novel Drug Delivery for the Management of Viral Infections 367 Figure 9.4 Antifungal agents targeting different components of fungal cell. 368 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
9.4 NDDS for the Management of Fungal 
Infections 
Globally, fungal infections are growing community health 
threats which are largely associated with socioeconomic factors
(unhealthy food, unhygienic, modern lifestyle) and ignoring
primary infection symptoms [136]. Although a wide range of broad￾spectrum antibiotics are prescribed to manage fungal diseases, 
severe adverse effects are associated with the therapy due to their 
eukaryotic nature. Patients with prolonged medication, diseased 
state, immune-compromised and surgery/operated persons are 
highly susceptible to fungal infections [137]. Additionally, the 
development of antibiotic resistance and undesirable side effects 
worsen the cases that lead to a high percentage of mortality
rate. Figure 9.4 displays fungal cell and target sites of antifungal 
drugs. 
9.4.1 Cutaneous Infection
Globally, fungal infection or mycosis is one of the major
treacherous threats that influence approximately 40 million 
people in developed and developing countries annually. Initially, 
fungal pathogen attacks the skin surface and later by the process 
of desquamation it proliferates into the deeper layers of skin. 
Dermatophytes are fungal pathogens that invade not only the 
upper stratum corneum but also penetrate the other parts of 
the skin devastatingly if ignored [138]. Several topical ailments 
such as Tinea corporis (covers the whole body), Tinea pedis (legs
or feet), Tinea capitis (scalp) and Tinea cruris (groin area) are 
highly significant diseases caused by myriad strains of fungi,
i.e., Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton [139, 140].
Topical drug delivery proves the best route for effective healing
of major dermatophytosis as it ensures direct reach with a high 
retention rate at the infected site with minimum adverse effects. 
Several topical azole and allyamine derivatives are successfully 
employed for the designing of antifungals. Traditional remedies 
require a high dose and frequent or repeated applications on 
the affected skin area that lead to hypersensitivity, itching 
and poor patient compliance. Advanced or novel drug carrier￾embedded delivery systems have been introduced that offer a  
NDDS for the Management of Fungal Infections 369 
controlled release of the drug with less local and systemic toxic 
effects. Although the mechanism of antifungals should be clear
for the selection of appropriate dosage that can maintain 
adequate therapeutic concentration at the target site. Most of 
the antifungal check synthesis of ergosterol, a desired growth 
nutrient for fungal pathogens [141].
Candidiasis caused by yeast (Candida genus) is another 
common superficial skin disease. It affects mostly the 
immunocompromised individuals and those in intensive care. 
Approximately 20 species of Candida yeast are reported in 
which Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are prominent for 
causing devastating topical infections (oral, skin and vaginal) to 
humans [142]. Human skin covers approximately 2 m2 surface 
area and is hence considered the largest vital part of the body. 
Stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is 
contained keratinized and dead cells. It is also the prime
barrier for invading of pathogens and penetration of antifungal
therapeutics. Novel preparations such as niosomes, liposomes, 
micro/nanoemulsions, solid lipid carriers are targeted to kill skin￾adhered fungal pathogens [143]. Enormous research is disclosed 
related to novel and carrier-mediated antifungal drug delivery 
systems which are discussed in Table 9.3.
Imidazole derivative clotrimazole and ketoconazole-loaded 
two lipid-based formulations, i.e., SLNs and nanostructured lipid 
carriers were designed for the management of topical fungal 
infections. polyacrylic acid and carbopol were selected owing to 
the formation of in situ gel and mucoadhesiveness. HPLC analysis 
reported higher antimycotic action by clotrimazole-embedded
solid lipid nanoparticles and lipid carriers, 91.7% and 98.7%, 
respectively, compared to ketoconazole-loaded SLN and NLC, 
i.e., 62% and 70%, respectively. Hence, these novel delivery systems 
have the potential to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens present 
on the skin [144]. Antifungal fluconazole-embedded nonionic 
niosomes were developed using various surfactants such as Span 
40/60 and Brij 72 via the film hydration method. The formulations 
were stable and had micron size range (~0.287–0.378 µm) with 
satisfactory entrapment efficiency (greater than 41%). An in 
vitro skin permeation study revealed sufficient accumulation of
released fluconazole and hence exhibited localized antifungal 
remedy with enhanced skin retention time [145]. Table 9.3 Different antifungal agents containing novel dosages for the management of fungal infections

372 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
Voriconazole is an effective antifungal agent but poor
solubility and serious side effects limit its frequent uses in 
topical drug delivery systems. To overcome voriconazole-related
issues, microemulgel has been prepared using Parker neem® 
oil and carbomer 934P. Improved solubility and prolonged
antifungal efficiency suggested potential application of emulgel
(microemulsion-based gel) against the treatment of superficial 
dermatophytes [154]. Further, allylamine-derived butenafine 
hydrochloride has limited aqueous solubility, which was modified 
by the addition of surfactant (aerosol OT) and co-surfactant
(Sorbitol monooleate) during the formulation of microemulsion. 
Isopropyl palmitate and carbopol/sodium alginate/HPMC
were employed as oil phase (microemulsion) and gelling agent
(microgel), respectively. The formulated microgel exhibited 
superior skin permeation and antimycotic action compared to 
marketed butenafine hydrochloride cream [155]. 
9.4.2 Fungal Meningitis
In the year 2012, an outbreak of fungal meningitis appeared due 
to intrathecal methylprednisolone steroidal injection already 
contaminated with fungal strain Exserohilum rostratum that 
resulted in more than 50 casualties accompanied by 700 cases 
of illness in England [156]. Fungal species such as Cryptococcus 
neoformans, Histoplasma, Blastomyces and Coccidioides are 
prevalent pathogens that cause fungal meningitis. This infection 
spreads through blood to the brain and spinal cord. Commonly, 
amphotericin B and azole derivatives are prescribed to manage the 
infection. But poor solubility, high systemic toxicity and poor BBB 
permeability necessitate the designing of advanced drug delivery 
strategies. Different types of nanoparticles, nanocrystals, and
lipoidal vesicular systems are approached for the preparation 
of efficient and targeted drug delivery systems. In this context, 
fusogenic liposomes have been designed that has the potential
for effective rapid drug release against fungal meningitis [157].
Febrile neutropenia has been well treated with liposomal 
amphotericin B and caspofungin (a new echinocandin). These 
antifungals alter membrane permeability; disturb metabolic 
process that causes leakage of nutrients and ultimately fungal cell NDDS for the Management of Fungal Infections 373 
death. Dose-dependent efficacy was achieved in adult patients
after the intravenous administration of drug-loaded liposomes.
The rapid and extensive biodistribution of amphotericin B 
displayed no tissue accumulation and hence proved safe for 
normal cells [158]. Moreover, amphotericin B deoxycholate￾polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles were reported to treat 
cryptococcal meningitis. The developed nanoparticles were 
modified with polysorbate 80, which could be detected within
30 min after systemic administration in mice. An improved 
antifungal property was revealed, which was due to the improved 
transportation capacity of polysorbate-coated amphotericin B 
nanoparticles across the BBB [159]. 
9.4.3 Oropharyngeal Infection
Oropharyngeal candidiasis, a Candida infection mainly covers 
the oral cavity. The clinical features of oral candidiasis are 
highly prevalent in immunodeficient patients (HIV individuals). 
Candida albicans acts as an opportunistic pathogen that is 
supposed to be more virulent in humans [160].
Dental hygiene and regular mouthwash prevent most cases 
of oropharyngeal infections caused by Candida sp. Anti-Candida 
rinses including hexetidine or chlorhexidine antimicrobial 
agents are recommended [161]. Nystatin-encapsulated polymeric 
nanoparticles in toothpaste and gels were prepared and compared 
with unloaded polymeric nanoparticles. The developed system 
revealed prolonged adhesion of polymeric nystatin-embedded 
nanoparticles in the buccal mucosa. Moreover, it is alcohol-free, 
and the reduced frequency of application augmented patient 
compliance [162]. Ahmad et al. (2020) demonstrated modified 
PMMA dentures and their effective role in the mitigation of oral 
candidiasis. They compiled antifungal actions shown by different 
nanomaterials (copper–titanium dioxide, graphene sheet, zinc 
oxide, silver, zirconium oxide and curcumin-loaded nanoparticles) 
entrapped in PMMA dentures to modify cytotoxicity against 
Candida albicans. Versatile mechanisms of action were displayed 
by these nanoparticles such as disruption of cell wall and 
membrane, conjugation with the cell wall and by generation on 
reactive oxygen species due to their exclusive physicochemical 374 Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Infection Treatment 
properties [163]. Ho et al. (2020) developed itraconazole￾loaded nanoparticles through the evaporation emulsion method. 
The developed nanoparticles were embedded in carbopol 934
polymeric gel and evaluated for efficacy against Candida albicans, 
a primary source of oropharyngeal ailments. Formulated 
nanosystem was colloidal; the particles were spherical with a 
nanorange dimension [164]. Recently, bilayered mucoadhesive 
buccal films containing antibiotics have emerged for the complete 
eradication of adhered pathogens in the buccal cavity. Gajdosova 
et al. (2021) explored ciclopirox olamine, which is a broad￾spectrum antifungal and preferred for topical dermal infections. 
Bilayer mucoadhesive buccal films were fabricated with 
polyacrylate Eudragit®NM 30D and polyethylene oxide. Ex 
vivo studies highlighted that the mucoadhesive films mediated 
prolonged release and accumulated in the porcine buccal tissue, 
which suggested the clinical significance for the alleviation of
oral candidiasis [165].
Mady et al. (2018) fabricated miconazole buccal film with and 
without the addition of urea and evaluated antifungal efficiency 
(specifically, the role of the penetration enhancer) against Candida 
albicans. Urea-added miconazole patches displayed synergistic 
antifungal action due to cytoplasmic leakage and necrosis of
cells. In vitro evaluation of urea-incorporated miconazole 
buccal films exhibited significantly higher zone of inhibition 
(30–40 mm) compared to the miconazole-alone film (18 mm) 
[166]. Buccal films and patches are proven remedies for the 
management of oromucosal fungal disorders, specifically
candidiasis. These are easily fabricated, microbiologically stable
and exhibit higher retention on the affected site of buccal 
mucosa [167]. 
9.4.4 Vaginal Candidiasis
Vulvovaginal or vaginal candidiasis is a very common female genital 
infection caused by the yeast species Candida. The symptoms 
such as itching, pruritis, vulvar erythema and dyspareunia 
are frequently complained by the sufferer. Prolonged use of 
antibiotics, spermicides, diseased patients (diabetes, AIDS), intra￾uterine devices and imbalance of vaginal biota are risk factors  
NDDS for the Management of Fungal Infections 375 
of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Conventional vaginal dosages
including suppositories, creams and gels exhibit poor residence 
time. Moreover, the self-cleansing attribute of vagina limits the
adherence of therapeutics at site and requires repetitive
application of dosage [168]. Frequent applications and limited 
therapeutic efficacy ultimately lead to inconvenience to the 
patients. Several mucoadhesive formulations are suggested 
to overcome limitations associated with conventional drug
delivery systems. Biocompatible mucoadhesive natural and semi￾synthetic polymers are widely employed for designing NDDS
owing to their superb binding efficacy to the mucosal tissues for long 
periods of time [169]. Novel formulations including microspheres, 
nanocapsules, mucoadhesive tablets and microemulsions have 
been proved to be the effective treatments for the eradication 
of fungal/yeast pathogens around the area of the vagina. Table 
9.4 summarizes a few novel strategies designed for the clinical 
management of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vaginal formulations 
containing cyclodextrin have been highlighted owing to their 
tendency to amplify solubility, absorption, bioavailability and 
stability. Mucoadhesive in situ gels containing itraconazole, 
HPMC and poloxamer are reported for combatting vaginal 
candidiasis. The formulation exhibited pseudoplastic-type flow 
and thermostability on varying the temperature. Texture analysis 
displayed that poloxamer polymer provided more bioadhesion
and prolonged release of itraconazole from the gel compared 
to HPMC [170].
Kenechukwu et al. (2018) investigated the potential use 
of miconazole nitrate microparticles developed using different 
phytolipids for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Biocompatible phytolipids 
including hydrogenated palm oil, Softisan® 154 and super refined 
sunflower seed oil were employed for the preparation of SLNs via 
melt homogenization. Formulated miconazole nitrate nanoparticles 
were pegylated with PEG 400 that enhanced physicochemical and 
pharamacokinetic parameters of the system. Improved antifungal 
property was observed through analyzing the inhibition zone 
diameter when compared with the marketed Fungusol® topical
solution. Augmented fungicidal rate of miconazole nitrate SLNs 
(7.1 × 10–3 min–1) than commercial Fungusol® (8.0 × 10–3 min–1)
suggested clinical application to combat vaginal infection [178]. Table 9.4 Novel drug approaches for the management of vaginal candidiasis

9.5 Conclusion
The effective alleviation of pathogenic diseases requires the 
designing of carrier-mediated delivery systems that not only
stabilize therapeutic agents but also improve drug action at the 
infected site and resolve the issues associated with cell permeation 
and drug resistance. The chapter highlights myriad research and 
novel formulations for the management of different infectious
agents, i.e., bacteria, viruses and fungi. Polymeric nanoparticles, 
micelles, vesicular and lipid-based drug delivery approaches 
are highly entertained for the management of these devastating 
infections owing to their local and targeted drug release 
efficiencies. Although a few issues related to clinical trial and 
approval from registered governing bodies are still in the pipeline.

Cancer is the abnormal growth of body cells in an uncontrolled 
manner. It is the leading cause of death worldwide. However, 
today there are several strategies and technologies for the 
treatment of cancer, such as chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, 
and chemoimmunotherapy, a combination of chemotherapeutics 
and immunotherapeutic drugs. Despite all these strategies, the 
survival rate is very poor and the treatment is quite challenging 
and unsatisfactory. To address the limitations associated with 
the present strategies, nanodrug delivery systems (NDDS) have 
been introduced in this field and it has been seen that the 
progression of nanotechnology and a delve into tumor biology have 
brought several achievements and success in cancer treatment. 
The approaches based on NDDS have developed rapidly as they 
impart several advantages over conventional approaches for 
cancer therapy. In addition, NDDS such as nanocomposites,

nanoparticles, dendrimers, liposomes, microspheres, and hydrogels 
have the potential to improve the bioavailability, stability, and 
solubility of the therapeutical agent and to effectively deliver it
in a controlled manner at the target site with an appropriate 
route in sufficient concentration. Hence, with all such qualities, 
NDDS could be a remarkable approach for future cancer 
treatment. This chapter discusses various NDDS their development, 
and applications in cancer therapy by addressing the cancer 
background. 
10.1 Introduction
Cancer is the deadliest disease worldwide. In 2019, the WHO 
estimated that cancer is the major cause of death and in 2020
nearly 10 million deaths were accounted for worldwide, 
and in the future, the figure could cross ~13.1 million by 2030
[1, 2]. Several strategies have been implemented for the 
treatment of this fatal disease like chemotherapy, radiation, 
surgery, chemoimmunotherapy, combining chemotherapeutics 
and immunotherapeutic drugs. Among these, chemotherapy is
the most commonly used technology. In chemotherapy, the 
anticancer drug is systemically delivered to the patient to 
control the abnormal proliferation of cancerous cells, but 
the frequency of survival of patients is very poor, because 
of nonspecific targeting and lack of proper drug delivery in 
sufficient amounts [3]. In the treatment of cancer, there are 
two major concerns: The first one is the early detection of the 
tumor and the second is the targeted drug delivery [4]. Here, 
nonspecificity and toxicity are the major challenges associated
with traditional approaches. The researchers are doing regular 
efforts in developing and improving cancer treatment strategies 
to overcome the observed challenges; however, ideas like 
improving the pharmacological activity of drugs and preventing 
negative side effects are still in progress [5, 6]. Therefore,
to address the limitations and challenges with the currently 
practiced strategies, the concept of nanotechnology has been 
introduced in this sector. Nanotechnology enables researchers 
to develop novel, versatile targeted drug delivery systems aimed 
to deliver the therapeutics agent at the right time at the right 
sight in the right amount for the treatment of cancer [7, 8]. Introduction 403 
In pharmaceutical sciences, drug delivery approaches are 
basically utilized for administrating pharmaceutical products
in a controlled manner to increase therapeutic efficacy, and they 
have received much attention in the past two-three decades
for cancer treatment [9]. Earlier, DDS were generally of two types 
on the basis of their size: macro- and micro-scale DDS [10]. 
10.1.1 Causes of Cancer
There are numerous factors that can cause cancer in different 
parts of the body, including tobacco use (22% of deaths), 
malnutrition (10% of deaths), obesity (10% of deaths), physical 
inactivity (10% of deaths), increased consumption of alcohol 
(10% of deaths), excessive exposure to ionizing radiation,
infection, and environmental pollution. Cancer-causing infections 
like human papillomavirus and hepatitis B, C, and Epstein-Barr 
virus cause about 15% of cancer worldwide. These variables 
are partially responsible for gene changes. Cancer is also caused 
by aging. The most common cause of cancer is advanced age. 
Genetics is the most common factor in cancer and tumour 
development, including skin, ovarian, colorectal, breast, and 
prostate cancer. Consumption of large amounts of cooked meat 
can further raise the risk due to chemicals formed at high
temperatures [11, 12]. 
10.1.2 Prevalence of Cancer
The number of people in a defined group who have been diagnosed 
with a specific type of cancer at a specific time in the past and
are still living at the end of a given year. Usually expressed as a
figure and a percentage per 100,000 people. At the end of 2008, 
about 29 million people who had been diagnosed with cancer 
within the previous 5 years were still alive. Following colon cancer, 
which impacted both men and women (3.3 million), prostate
cancer, which affected men most frequently (3.2 million), and
breast cancer, which affected women (5.2 million), were the most 
prevalent [13, 14]. 
Types of cancer [12, 15]
Various types of cancer are shown in Table 10.1 [12, 15]. Table 10.1 Types of cancer 
Type of cancer Description 
Carcinomas Begins in the tissue or skin that covers the glands and the surface of internal organs. Prostate cancer, lung cancer, 
colorectal cancer, and breast cancer are examples of carcinomas. 
Sarcomas Begins in the connective and supportive tissues of the body. Joints Nerves, tendons, lymph vessels, blood vessels, 
bone, fat, cartilage, and muscles can all create it. 
Leukemia’s It starts when healthy blood cells expand and alter uncontrolled. Acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid 
leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are the four types of leukemia. 
Lymphomas It starts in the lymphatic system. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are the two main 
types of lymphomas. 
Central Cancers of the central nervous system include primary CNS lymphomas, meningiomas, gliomas, pituitary 
nervous adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors which 
system cancers start in the brain tissues and spinal cord. 
Multiple It starts in plasma cells. It accumulates in the bone marrow and causes malignancies. Plasma cell myeloma is also 
Myeloma known as Kahler disease. 
Melanoma It begins in cells that develop into melanocytes. These are specialized cells that produce melanin, the pigment that 
gives the skin its color.

cause pain and other issues but have serious adverse effects. Chemotherapy 
is used alone or in combination with other cancer treatments, depending on 
the type of cancer [23–25].

406 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 4 Immunotherapy Medication or other therapies are used to enhance the immune system. WBC and lymph node tissues make up the immune system, which gives the body the strength it needs to fight sickness and infection. It is also known as biological therapy, which refers to the compounds utilized in cancer treatment that are derived from living organisms. The most prevalent side effects are skin responses at the needle site along this pain, soreness, rash, chills, redness, swelling, joint pain, diarrhea, weakness, and fatigue [23–27]. Precision/ Personalized Medicine This is a recent technique in which genetic testing is used to determine the optimal treatment for a patient. Nowadays, cancer treatments are the same for patients with the same cancer and stage of cancer, although some patients’ reactions differ. Scientists have discovered that tumors have genetic alterations that cause cancer cells to develop and spread after extensive investigation. Precision medicine, according to scientists, has a bright future 
because it aids in receiving the best cancer therapy. Many medications are 
utilized as treatments known as target therapies in order to try treating 
patients with treatments that target the cancer-causing genetic alterations 
in the tumor. Precision medicine assists clinicians in determining the best 
treatment options because it contains all of the information on the tumor’s 
genetic changes, size, kind, and spread [28]. 
The availability of known targetable
tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), also 
known as “neoantigens,” that are 
primarily expressed by tumor cells, 
is a fundamental limitation of cancer 
immunotherapy [23]. 
The limitation of precision medicine
is the understudy of a mutation 
may or may not be important to the 
malignancy and the actual tumor 
may respond to the same therapy 
in a different way due to sampling
mistake. Introduction 407 
10.1.3 Current Strategies and Their Limitations 
There are a variety of cancer therapies available with their
limitations as shown in Table 10.2, depending on the type of 
cancer and how far it has progressed. Some cancer patients
have only one treatment, but the majority receive a mix of 
treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy.
Despite the fact that cancer nanomedicine has been around 
for 30 years and has made significant progress in the field of
cancer treatment, it still has significant drawbacks that must be 
addressed as shown in Fig. 10.1. 
Figure 10.1 Major challenges faced by current drug delivery systems in 
cancer treatment.  
 
408 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
10.2 Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment 
of Cancer 
In the last few years, multiple versatile NDDS have been developed 
such as liposomes, microspheres, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, 
dendrimers, carbon-based materials like carbon nanotubes (CNT), 
graphene to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to tumor sites 
with improved therapeutic efficacy [2, 29–31]. A nanocarrier-based 
drug delivery system possessing remarkable features is shown 
in Fig. 10.2. 
Figure 10.2 Multifunctional nanocarrier system-based drug delivery [9, 31]. 
Some of the features of NDDS through which the cancer 
treatment efficacy could be improved are as follows [22, 32]: 
• Site-specific targeting, that can be achieved by conjugating 
the nanocarriers consisting of a chemotherapeutic agent. 
• Minimizing the toxicity by accumulating in the infected
site via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect
and active cellular uptake  
 
 
 
 
 
Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 409 
• Sustained release of the chemotherapeutic agent for a 
couple of days or months 
• Stimuli-responsive drug release for effective delivery of 
anticancer drug 
Nowadays more than twenty NDDS are available commercially 
to treat different diseases including cancer, infections, and 
hormonal disorders, some clinically approved or under clinical 
trial nanomedicines are given in Table 10.3 [33]. The advantages
of FDA-approved nanomedicines mainly include: 
• improved stability 
• enhanced site-specific targeted drug delivery in tumor 
• increased drug loading and bioavailability, which results
in lower toxicity and higher efficacy 
• increase distribution of anticancer agents at the targeted site 
(tumor) may be through passive targeting, active targeting,
or triggered drug release [34, 35]

10.2.1 Role of Nanotechnology-Based Approaches in 
Cancer Treatment 
The applications of nanotechnology for anticancer therapy are 
rapidly growing and have made a remarkable contribution to 
treatment approaches by enabling the site-specific release of 
chemotherapeutic agents, depending on their physicochemical 
characteristics and biological attributes [3, 36]. The role of 
nanotechnology approaches has been described by the following 
postulates [37]: 
• Several studies carried out with nanoparticle (NP)
formulations have shown that they offer high loading
capacity and more stability and both hydrophilic and 
lipophilic substances can be administered by using NP 
through various routes. 
• NDDS are also capable of utilizing the unique patho￾physiology of cancer cells to selectively carry the loaded 
chemotherapeutic drug to the target site.  
 
 
 
 
Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 411 
• NDDS based on the nanotechnology for cancer targeting 
generally have a longer shelf-life and better distribution 
of chemotherapeutic drugs at the effective site. 
• Use of nanotechnology enables the delivery of biomacro￾molecules like DNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA), mRNA, 
and protein) to intracellular sites of action. 
• It made the codelivery of multiple drugs possible to improve 
therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance, by 
providing more precise control of exposure to stimuli to
each drug and the delivery of appropriate drug ratio to the 
target of interest. 
• By combining therapeutic agents with imaging moiety 
visualization of sites of drug delivery is possible and hence 
diagnosis and imaging of cancer become more sensitive 
and sophisticated. 
• It led to the miniaturized medical devices for cancer 
diagnosis, drug screening, and drug delivery. 
Figure 10.3 depicts some disadvantages of the current drug 
delivery systems and the advantages of the novel drug delivery 
systems [38]. 
Figure 10.3 Disadvantages of the current drug delivery systems and the 
advantages of the novel drug delivery systems. 412 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
According to the FDA’s criteria, nanotechnological products 
are those containing materials whose size ranges from 1 to 100 nm 
[39]. Size is one of the main parameters which determines the 
behavior of transport of nanoparticles through the bloodstream 
and their accumulation in tumor cells. It has been observed that 
smaller nanomedicines are able to deliver the drug to the tumor 
cells better than the large molecules, but with the possibility of 
getting distributed to the healthy cells too. The size of NDDS is 
usually in the range of 10–100 nm, which is necessary for the 
accumulation of the drug at the target site or tissue [40]. Apart 
from size, the charge can also affect the biopharmaceutical 
properties of nanomedicines. Neutral-charged NDDS diffused 
faster at the tumor as compared to the positively charged
and negatively charged, while positively charged NDDS diffuse 
better [41]. The variability in the charge can be achieved by 
attaching ligands and it could improve blood circulation time 
and cellular uptake of these nanoparticles [42]. Moreover, the 
surface modification of NDDS can increase the adsorption of 
circulating proteins which modifies the targeting properties of 
nanoparticles [22, 43].
The growing interest in novel and efficient drug delivery 
systems with minimum toxicity and adverse effect has created 
a demand for developing NDDS in cancer therapy. Further, the 
increase in healthcare spending, investments in R&D for novel 
therapy development, and new drug approvals by drug regulatory 
authorities are also the major factors that are responsible for the 
development of NDDS.
The results from studies conducted around the world 
demonstrate that NDDS applications in the medical field are 
a promising and innovative approach. They can also be used 
in combination therapy to improve penetration, retention, 
and therapeutic action as well as to increase the solubility and 
bioavailability of the agents. They can also be used to extend 
the circulation time of a chemotherapeutic agent via active and 
passive targeting [44]. NDDS are developed using various organic 
and inorganic materials by loading natural or synthetic drugs 
onto these nanocarrier materials. Before 1995 several nanodrug Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 413
carriers were developed by researchers, which included liposomes, 
polymeric systems, dendrimers, and PEGylated liposomes [45]. 
Moreover, the potential of NDDS is better depicted earlier in 
Fig. 10.1 which showed a multifunctional nanoparticle illustrating 
the ability to carry one or more drugs, a targeting bimolecular
moiety in conjugation with one or more antibodies or some 
recognition agent, a contrast-enhancing agent which assists the 
amplification of the imaging signal, a permeation enhancer for the 
smooth crossing of the bio barriers and a selective polymer for
the avoidance of macrophage uptake by macrophages [31, 46]. 
10.2.1.1 Polymer–drug conjugates 
The covalent binding between a polymer and a drug results in 
a polymer–drug conjugate as shown in Fig. 10.4, which leads to 
high solubility, and stability with reduced immunogenicity for 
peptide drugs or proteins along with an increase in clearance 
time [47, 48]. Among polymers, PEG is the first choice for 
polymer–drug conjugation due to its simple structure and 
biodegradability. 
Formulations: Oncaspar® is a commercialized FDA-approved 
cancer treatment. L-asparagine is an amino acid of natural origin 
whose decomposition is catalyzed by enzyme asparaginase 
into aspartic acid and ammonia. Decreased concentration of 
L-asparagine in the systemic circulation results in decreased 
synthesis of protein, DNA, and RNA. However, the use of naked 
asparaginases has been limited by a high rate of hypersensitivity 
reactions and the development of anti-asparaginase antibodies, 
which neutralize its activity. But PEGylated asparaginase under 
clinical trials (I and II) suggested that its mean half-life time 
is 357 h as compared to the naked drug, which is 20 h; hence, 
this demonstrated that a single dose of PEG-asparaginase can 
replace 6–9 doses of native E. coli asparaginase injections. So here, 
PEG-asparaginase with a longer half-life and reduced number 
of doses is a good example of a polymer–drug conjugate [33, 46, 
49, 50]. 414 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
Figure 10.4 Polymer–drug conjugate. 
10.2.1.2 Polymeric micelles 
Micelles are about 5–100 nm-sized colloidal particles basically 
proposed to carry hydrophobic drugs in anticancer therapy and 
the polymeric micelles are nanostructures made up of amphiphilic 
copolymer that assembled themselves in an aqueous solution. 
Its structure can be easily tailored and its hydrophobic core 
can be made to load hydrophobic drugs such as camptothecin, 
docetaxel, paclitaxel, and simultaneously. The hydrophilic shell 
makes the whole system soluble in an aqueous medium and 
stabilizes the core. With a size less than 100 nm, polymeric 
micelles have a narrow distribution and show delayed renal 
excretion; hence, they get accumulated at the tumor site through 
the EPR effect. In addition, their polymeric shell restrains non￾specific interactions with biological components. Thus these 
structures permit stability and bioavailability to chemotherapeutic 
molecules. A typical structure of polymeric micelles is shown in 
Fig. 10.5.
In recent years, polymeric micelles have been extensively 
utilized in pre-clinical studies for delivering poorly soluble 
chemotherapeutic agents in cancer. Polymeric micelles are formed Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 415
via the self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers in facile manners. 
The wide availability of hydrophobic and, to some extent, 
hydrophilic polymeric blocks allow researchers to explore various 
polymeric combinations for optimum loading, stability, systemic 
circulation, and delivery to the target cancer tissues. Moreover, 
polymeric micelles could easily be tailor-made by increasing 
and decreasing the number of monomers in each polymeric 
chain. Some of the widely accepted hydrophobic polymers are 
poly (lactide) (PLA), poly (caprolactone) (PCL), poly (lactide-co￾glycolide) (PLGA), polyesters, poly (amino acids), and lipids. The
hydrophilic polymers used to wrap the hydrophobic core are 
poly (ethylene glycol), poly (oxazolines), chitosan, dextran, and 
hyaluronic acids. Drugs could be conjugated to polymers at 
the distal ends to prepare pharmacologically active polymeric
systems that impart enhanced solubility and stability of the 
conjugates and provide an opportunity for combination drug 
delivery. Their nano-size enables them to accumulate in the tumor 
microenvironment via the EPR effect. Moreover, the stimuli￾sensitive breakdown provides the micelles with an effective 
means to deliver the therapeutic cargo effectively. The tumor
micro-environmental stimuli are pH, hypoxia, and upregulated 
enzymes. Externally applied stimuli to destroy micellar 
disassembly to release the payload include light, ultrasound, 
and temperature [22, 51, 52]. Polymeric micelles under clinical
trials are shown in Table 10.4.

10.2.1.3 Microspheres
Microspheres are solid spherical porous particles with a diameter 
range of 1 to 1000 μm and allow a uniform distribution of the 
drug in the polymer matrix. They could be biodegradable or 
nonbiodegradable depending on the material chosen [53]. These 
are one of the approaching NDDSs that are widely integrated 
and tailored so that the carcinogenic drugs can be delivered with 
site-specific targeting with improved therapeutic activity with 
minimal adverse effects further microspheres can be injected
and ingested to due ease of modification as per the need hence 
with such properties, microspheres play an essential role in the 
treatment of cancer [54]. A wide range of polymeric materials
can be considered for the formulation of microspheres, such as 
lipids, proteins, polysaccharides, and polyesters. Also, there are 
several techniques which can be adopted for their development 
such as phase inversion technology, emulsification and heat 
stabilization, and coacervation. Anticancer drugs such as 
doxorubicin, mitomycin C, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil have been 
subjected to various studies by using microspheres. Nevertheless, 
with all such applications, these persistent instability problems 
so need more optimization and characterization [44, 53, 55, 56]. Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 417 
Figure 10.6 shows the modes of drug release from different
types of microspheres: (a) bulk-eroding polymer and (b) surface￾eroding polymer. 
Figure 10.6 Modes of drug release from different types of microspheres: 
(A) bulk-eroding polymer and (B) surface-eroding polymer. 
10.2.1.4 Hydrogels
Hydrogels are quite flexible three-dimensional networks of water￾soluble cross-linked polymer. They are highly biocompatible and 
have a wide range of applications in many fields, especially in 
biomedical and commonly used in clinical studies. Their porous, 
flexible structure can be easily tailored by governing the density 
of cross-links in the gel matrix, and their porous structure along 
with the gel-sol phenomenon permits the loading and release 
rate of therapeutic molecules through these three-dimensional 
networks. Hydrogel formulations showed a significant impact
on the pharmacokinetics of drugs by creating a depot which keeps 
a high concentration of the drug at the local site and in the 
surroundings for an extended period. Using hydrogels two or
more drugs can be delivered concurrently hence this approach 
can be used to avoid drug resistance and adverse effect of a
potent drug. The design of a hydrogel for controlled release is 
shown in Fig. 10.7. 418 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
Figure 10.7 Design of hydrogel for controlled release. Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 419 
Studies have shown synergistic administration of lapatinib and 
paclitaxel results in the accumulation of lapatinib at the cancerous 
site in an acceptable safe concentration, and the codelivery of 
microparticles of lapatinib and nanoparticles of paclitaxel were 
incorporated into a thermosensitive hydrogel was conducted 
to achieve a localized delivery. In another study, a poly(N￾isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) hydrogel with near-infrared 
absorbing silica–gold nanoshells successfully carried concurrent 
doxorubicin and DNA. 
Besides several applications, hydrogels also impart some 
limitations such as the initial burst release of the drug due to 
the poor mechanical strength of polymers and less load-bearing 
capacity. Hence, it demands efforts in this direction so that the 
remarkable properties of such nanocarriers can be utilized in 
targeted delivery [10, 44, 55, 57]. 
10.2.1.5 Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles (NPs) are particles that have dimensions not more 
than 100 nm, and at such size, they show different properties
and behavior compared with the bulk sample of the same 
substance. Nanoparticles may be 0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D depending on 
their shape. They possess some extraordinary properties such 
as high surface-to-volume ratio, sub-micron size, and enhanced 
targeting system, they showed deep tissue penetration hence 
increasing the EPR effect. The special features offered by the
optimal size of NPs allow the therapeutic molecule to be 
encapsulated/loaded/or conjugated to the surface and distributed 
to the target site directly. The rate of therapeutic molecules 
can be easily controlled by activating or changing the external
and internal stimuli such as environmental pH, temperature, 
chemicals, and radiations [36, 58, 59].
For example, PEGylation of nanoparticles increased the 
stability, minimized the opsonization, and circumvented the 
immune system clearance. Also, the optimization of the release 
rate of drugs or active moiety by manipulating particle polymer 
characteristics could be possible [48, 60]. Different nanomaterials 
are used in drug delivery for cancer treatment as shown in 
Fig. 10.8. 420 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
Figure 10.8 Various types of nanomaterials used in drug delivery for cancer treatment. Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 421 
10.2.1.6 Liposomes
The discovery of liposomes in 1960 by Alec Bangham brought a 
significant revolution to the drug discovery systems, liposomes are 
basically concentric bi-layered vesicles composed of either natural 
or synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol enclosing aqueous 
volume inside them and are usually spherical in shape [5]. Generally, 
they are manufactured in size less than 20 μm in diameter and 
interact with the membrane components in a predicted way. Both 
hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemotherapeutic molecules can 
be delivered by using liposomes as a DDS, like the hydrophobic 
molecules can be encapsulated inside into lipid bilayer, or the 
hydrophilic molecules can be enclosed in an aqueous core or can 
be adsorbed onto the surface via charge interaction or through 
chemical linkers. They have created a wide interest as they 
are very flexible nontoxic, highly biocompatible, improve the 
therapeutic efficacy, reduce peak-valley fluctuations, and provide 
sustained release at the target site. Till now more than 20 liposome 
formulations are commercialized and several are under pre￾clinical and clinical trials. It has been observed that liposomes 
due to hydrophobicity show early clearance time so sometimes 
they are conjugated with polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG), 
such liposomes are known as Stealth® liposomes with increased 
blood circulation time. 
Formulations: Doxil® and Myocet® are commercialized 
liposomes that encapsulate the broad-spectrum anticancer drug 
doxorubicin. It was observed that the side effects have been 
reduced but the clearance time was rapid hence the drug was 
loaded through an “active loading” approach via potential gradients 
and pH on Doxil® and Myocet,® respectively. The results were 
significant and Doxil® showed more remarkable improvement
in its pharmacokinetic profile than Myocet® which was due to 
PEG coating. Overall, the results demonstrated both Doxil® 
and Myocet® proved quite significant in reducing the toxicity
of doxorubicin [44, 45, 53, 55, 61]. 
10.2.1.7 Dendrimers
Dendrimers are globular-shaped 3-D structures and they 
can be easily modified through surface functionalization in a  
 
 
 
 
422 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
controlled manner apart from the structural benefits dendrimers 
possessed some special features which lend them as a promising 
nanocarrier for oncological approaches. Following are their 
features: 
a. They show biocompatibility due to the presence of negative 
charge or no charge but the presence of positive charge 
results in toxicity. 
b. The architecture and design of dendrimers can affect 
pharmacokinetics to a great extent. 
c. The PEGylation of dendrimers leads to an increase in its 
aqueous solubility and retention time with improved
biodistribution characteristics. 
d. The surface of dendrimers offers easy functionalization due 
to which the chemotherapeutic agents can be attached to 
the functionalized groups via covalent bonding, electrostatic 
interaction, or can be trapped into the void surface available. 
e. To improve the specificity and efficacy, some other moieties 
can be attached to the surface of dendrimers like targeting 
moiety, imaging moiety, etc. 
Hence, these properties generated the interest of researchers
to develop dendrimer-based anticancer therapies.
For example, Jain et al. developed doxorubicin-folate-conjugated 
poly-l-lysine dendrimers which showed pH-dependent drug 
release with 121.5-fold increased concentration of doxorubicin 
in tumor area in comparison to free drug after 24 h. Further, 
Kaur et al. described folate-conjugated polypropylene imine pH￾sensitive dendrimer to carry methotrexate to cancer cells, the
results of in vitro studies showed a sustained release with 
increased drug concentration and low toxicity on MCF-7 cell lines
as compared to free drug delivery [3, 46, 49, 50]. 
10.2.1.8 Carbon nanoparticles
Because of their amazing optical, mechanical, and electronic 
properties, carbon NPs are widely utilized in the medicinal field 
[62–65]. Drugs are basically encapsulated in such structures via 
p–p stacking due to their hydrophobic nature [66, 67]. Carbon
NPs are further categorized into  
 
 
Use of Nanotechnology in the Treatment of Cancer 423 
• Graphene: is a 2D sp2-hybridized honeycomb structure 
with extraordinary physicochemical properties and it can
be further modified as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced 
graphene oxide (rGO) which possess more desired 
characteristics, biocompatibility, and oxygenated groups
for functionalization, for example, doxorubicin conjugated 
with GO exhibits better anticancer activities in a cellular 
model of breast cancer as compared to the free drug [67–70]. 
• Carbon nanotubes: are 1D cylindrically shaped tube￾like structures obtained by folding a graphene sheet and 
depending upon the number of sheets of graphene it is 
classified as single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and 
multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT). They are capable of 
producing immune responses by interacting with immune 
cells and therefore can be used to suppress tumor growth. 
For example, encapsulating doxorubicin to a fluorescent 
SWNT with mAb was used to target colon cancer cells and 
it was found that the complex was effectively engulfed
by the cancer cells and released doxorubicin intracellularly, 
whereas the CNTs were retained in the cytoplasm [62, 65, 
71, 72]. 
• Fullerenes: are 3D carbon cage-like structures generally 
spherical in shape and are widely used nanocarriers due 
to amazing physical, chemical, and electrical properties. 
Fullerenes modified with PEG brought significant photo￾dynamic effects on cancer cells [38, 65]. 
10.2.1.9 Quantum dots
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals that have 
a size of a few nanometers (2 to 10 nm). Quantum dots have 
been vigorously studied as bioimaging, sensors, and targeted 
drug delivery in the medical field. However, it has been also 
investigated in the management of cancer. The most widely
used of this technique is graphene quantum dots due to their
inherent biocompatibility and rapid excretion. For example,
quantum dots aptamer—doxorubicin conjugate targets prostate 
cancer cells. However, the deficiency of optimized processes
in producing quantum dots is the major obstacle [73–76]. Table 10.5 Nanoparticle formulations currently available in the market

10.2.1.10 Solid lipid nanoparticles
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) are generally used for the delivery 
of hydrophobic substances. They are colloidal with a size range 
of 50 to 1000 nm consisting of a lipid matrix that remains solid 
at room temperature and body temperature. The main advantage 
of SLNs is that they can be produced at a large scale easily 
and a controlled release with site-specific targeting can be 
achieved for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. For 
example, tryptanthin and oridonin are herbal drugs used for 
anticancer therapy and have been developed in the form of 
solid lipid nanoparticles [46, 77]. 
10.2.1.11 Gold nanoparticles
Gold nanoparticles represent a novel technology in the field of 
particle-based tumor-targeted drug delivery. Paciotti et al. have 
reported an application of these carriers for the targeted delivery 
of tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) to solid tumors [5, 36, 78, 79].
Day by day the market of formulations based on nano￾particles is going on expanding and to address the limitations 
of conventional formulations, some nanoparticle formulations 
commercially available in the market for the treatment of cancer 
have been summarized in Table 10.5. 
10.3 Conclusion
Every year various authentic organizations present data reports 
on the cancer status, and the analysis revealed that the current 
strategies available for the treatment of cancer are limited 
and are associated with various drawbacks due to which the 
survival rate of cancer patients is quite unsatisfactory. Most of the 
conventional methods for cancer therapy are proving toxic and 
are not able to specifically target the infected region. For 
researchers, among various fatal diseases, cancer is one of the 
most challenging life-threatening ailments and continuous efforts 
are going on to find a suitable strategy. However, the use of 
nanotechnology revolutionized this field and some remarkable 
inventions have been made with which researchers got success to  
 
 
 
 
426 Novel Drug Delivery System Approach in Cancer Treatment 
some extent in this direction. The current studies have concluded 
that the use of nanotechnology-based NDDS is proving to be a 
promising approach for anticancer therapy. NDDS can address 
the drawbacks associated with conventional therapies and also 
show suitable results in clinical studies. FDA has also given
approval to several NDDS-based systems for the delivery of 
therapeutic substances, and currently a number of NDDS-based 
products, such as Abraxane and Doxil, are available on the market 
and imparting the potential of nanotechnology. In this chapter, 
we discussed various types of NDDS and their significance in
cancer therapy. In addition, cancer background and its treatment
with conventional approaches have also been summarized. 
It is concluded that the unique attribute of NDDS allows and 
offers researchers to develop new treatments or to use them in 
combination therapy as an adjunct. Although NDDS are being 
used as a potential drug delivery carrier, some of them have not 
been successful during clinical trials. Moreover, several new 
and existing materials are currently under development and 
optimization and thereby providing hope for new promising
cancer treatments in the near future.

To overcome the main limitations of the traditional wound healing 
and dressing procedure, a new technology with a conjugated
form had emerged, leading to several advantages by taking into 
account nano. The new era of biocompatible agent drug delivery 
is opened up by nanoparticles. The use of nanomaterials in the 
treatment and prevention of wound infections has numerous 
benefits. Numerous research had reported various nanomaterials 
and nanoproducts for wound healing. They act as a revolving
wheel with dynamic properties when combined with other drugs 
and herbs. They had been utilized commercially in a variety of 
nanomaterial forms, including hydrogels, metallic nanoparticles, 
nanofibers, nanocomposites, and nanofibers made of polymers.

11.1 Introduction 
Wounds are the “hidden epidemic” which reduce the quality 
of life. In many cases of injury and diseased condition, wound 
dressings do not meet the standards and fail to integrate properly 
[1, 2]. These properties in turn resulted in poor bioavailability,
systematic delivery of hydrophobic drugs, and high level of
reacted oxygen species [3, 4]. A recent analysis conducted in 
2018 on acute and chronic wounds revealed that 8 million 
beneficiaries experienced one or more types of wounds or 
associated infections [5, 6]. On the other hand, in typical wound 
care, herbal remedies such as honey, bandages, and dressings
leave scars regardless of the possible functional and aesthetic 
changes [7, 8].
Honey a natural derivative product shows numerous benefits 
such as immunostimulatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti￾inflammatory, actions and it is used in rapid wound healing [9]. 
However, when used topically for wounds, honey shows some 
drawbacks or negative effects. For instance, it might be difficult 
to prepare honey-impregnated dressings [10]. With the rise in 
temperatures, honey becomes more fluid. Sometimes it might 
temporarily sting and also increase blood glucose concentration 
in diabetes mellitus patients at large wound sites [11, 12]. The 
excessive application of it causes the dehydration of tissues and 
it can also cause hypersensitivity reactions due to the presence of 
pollen and bee proteins [13, 14].
In addition to tissue restoration to its original form (i.e., the 
delay in restoring tissue integrity), these conventional materials 
have their limitations that make wounds worse. Potential materials 
for wound healing might thereby improve therapeutic outcomes.
The effective and safe wound dressings include good water 
vapor transmission rate, exudate-absorbents with high swelling 
capacity and porosity, and antibacterial and anti-inflammatory 
characteristics. Exceptionally they have elasticity, flexibility, the 
ability to load drugs, tensile strength, and spreadability. As the 
above factors help in the healing process by maintaining a moist 
environment around the wound [15]. 
11.1.1 Pathogenesis of Wounds 
The cascade of the healing process is divided into four steps, which 
are depicted below [16]: Introduction 441 
Step 1: Hemostasis Phase 
Step 2: Defensive/Inflammatory Phase 
Step 3: Proliferative Phase 
Step 4: Maturation Phase 
Figure 11.1 Different phases of Wound Healing. 442 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
Blood-borne cells including neutrophils control the initial
stage of inflammation, and macrophages help in the repairing of 
tissue damage. Neutrophils and macrophages offer the temporary 
matrices and platelet-derived growth factor essential for drawing 
dermal/epidermal cells into the wound bed. In response to 
autocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine growth hormones, after three 
days of injury, the proliferative phase will start which increased 
the levels of the above growth factors like keratinocyte-fibroblast, 
migration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation [17].
During this stage, angiogenesis and neovascularization also take 
place. After two weeks of injury, myofibroblasts present in the
granulation tissue will start to rebuild the ECM.
An acellular scar is produced as a result of extracellular 
matrix modification and resident cell death [18, 19]. The phases
of wound healing are described in Fig. 11.1. 
11.1.2 Role of Nanotechnology in the Wound Healing 
Recent advancements in the development of wound dressing 
materials have improved the understanding of the pathogenesis 
of chronic wounds. Various novel strategies have been used, such 
as nanotechnology, which accelerates the healing of both acute 
and chronic wounds via the movement of various healing phases. 
The use of various topical nanotechnology formulations such 
as nanoscaffolds, nanofibers, various small-sized nanomaterials, 
and biomaterials are used in wound healing [20]. Nanomaterials 
(10-9 nm) have been increasingly popular in recent years for 
use in biological and pharmaceutical applications which were 
used for the dressings of wounds, administration of the drug, 
and medical procedures [21].
Polymeric nanoscaffolds and innovative polymeric nanofibers 
have become popular in the treatment of wound healing due 
to their penetrability and target drug delivery at the site of the 
wound [22]. The use of nanomaterials in the modern era is 
rapidly growing in the management of various diseases [23, 24]. 
When the size of a molecule is converted to nanoscale, it will 
drastically change the physiological properties such as an 
increase in volume and surface area [25, 26].
Two principal types of nanoparticles (NPs) are frequently 
employed in wound healing:  
 
Nanoparticles Used in Wound Healing 443 
1. NPs possess intrinsic nature which helps in wound closure 
[27]. They can be further divided into metallic/metal oxide 
nanomaterials and nonmetallic nanomaterials. 
2. NPs used as delivery vectors for therapeutic agents [28]. 
11.2 Nanoparticles Used in Wound Healing 
Wound healing is an important issue today for which wound 
management is necessary [29]. Nanotechnology plays an intense
role in curing and managing this disease by using various bio￾materials and various medicines embedded in nanoparticles 
which act as a good aid in wound dressings by enhancing 
regeneration, accelerating delayed wound healing, and use in burn 
treatment [30]. The different types of nanoderivatives used in 
wound healing are summarized in Fig. 11.2. 
Figure 11.2 The different types and roles of nanoparticles used in wound 
healing. 444 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
11.2.1 Metallic Nanoparticles (Organic/Inorganic) 
It has been demonstrated that metal nanostructures in single 
conjugates may have the ability to heal wounds [31]. They 
were combined with other dressing materials resulting in the 
suppression of germs from the wound area. Among various 
metallic nanoparticles, metals such as silver, gold, and zinc 
were blended with nanoparticles and exhibited remarkable 
antimicrobial activities and low in vivo toxicity [32]. 
11.2.1.1 Silver 
Due to their unique qualities, silver nanoparticles have been widely 
used to create burn-specific ointments, pressure ulcer wound 
dressings, and other medical devices. They must stop the growth 
of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa [33]. The silver-coated 
dressings are frequently used for wound treatment because they 
can distribute medications effectively. Due to their higher surface￾to-volume ratio and higher potency at lower concentrations, 
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are frequently utilized in place 
of silver material, which reduces the toxicity profile [34]. Pure 
silver nanoparticles can control the release of anti-inflammatory
cytokines to hasten wound healing without causing further 
scarring. AgNPs encourage wound contractility, which hastens
the healing process by encouraging the differentiation of myo￾fibroblasts from regular fibroblasts. Besides, AgNPs’ mechanism 
of action is to stimulate epidermal re-epithelialization via the 
proliferation and relocation of keratinocytes [35]. 
11.2.2 Mechanism of Action of Silver 
Silver nanoparticles have a large surface area due to which they
easily adhere to and penetrate the bacterial cell membranes. 
They cause interaction with the proteins having sulfur and 
phosphorus groups residing along with the DNA. They also 
transformed the molecular weight of bacteria to low which in 
turn protects DNA from damage. The primary method of action 
of AgNPs against bacteria, causing apoptosis, is the formation of 
sulfuric bonds with either bacterial cell membrane proteins or 
thiol groups of different enzymes, especially those included in
the respiratory chain. AgNPs may also disrupt DNA synthesis Nanoparticles Used in Wound Healing 445 
during cell division, which in turn prevents the bacterial pro￾liferation of DNA having sulfurous and phosphorous linkages [36]. 
AgNPs prevent the production of biofilms and effectively remove 
bacterial toxins by effectively disrupting quorum sensing. AgNPs 
are devoid of any biological functions of their own; however, 
the generated silver ions are only responsible for the said action. 
Inhibiting the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) results 
in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and some 
nonspecific mechanisms. It also delays and interrupts the 
normal phases of healing [37, 38]. The mechanism of action of
silver nanoparticles is illustrated in Fig. 11.3. 
Figure 11.3 Mechanism of action of Ag nanoparticle in invading the bacterial 
cell. 
Some of the reported research findings support the potential 
role of AgNPs in microbial clearance and enhancing wound
healing. Lu et al. integrated AgNPs into mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles through the aid of disulfide bonds (Ag-MSNs), after 
their observation in animal trials that inorganic particles such 
as silica firmly adhere to open wounds. The new compound
demonstrated excellent antibacterial activities, with little cellular 
toxicity [39].  
446 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
11.2.2.1 Gold 
Due to their chemical stability and near-infrared-light–absorbing 
properties, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are useful tools with lengthy 
chemical stability and the potential to absorb Infrared rays in 
wound healing therapy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are connected 
to the cell surface without changing the collagen’s structural
integrity through cross-linking with collagen and a number 
of biomolecules, including polysaccharides, growth factors, 
and peptides [40, 41]. These particles are widely utilized for 
wound healing and targeted drug delivery, and they are also 
biocompatible and aid in tissue regeneration. According to a study 
on vancomycin-conjugated gold nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles 
can be complexed with already available antimicrobial medicines 
or with other nanoparticles to increase their ability to kill 
bacteria [42]. As it was reported that vancomycin’s shown 
more potent activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci 
(VRE) by 50-fold, against E. coli. which earlier remain unaffected
by vancomycin [43].
Arafa et al. demonstrated that AuNPs have shown in vivo and 
in vitro models their antibacterial and healing properties.
They work by specifically attacking the DNA and cell wall 
of bacteria, preventing the DNA’s double helix from uncoiling,
which aids in replication or transcription. They are also known 
to prevent the production of ROS and inhibit infections like 
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by acting as 
antioxidants [44].
AuNP conjugates have been shown by Sherwani et al. to 
be beneficial in treating mouse wounds that are infected with 
Candida albicans. When the conjugate is administered topically
to the lesion site, the wound healing capabilities and improved 
wound healing are seen [45]. 
11.2.3 Gold Nanoparticles of Mechanism of Action 
AuNPs exert their mechanism of action via two pathways: 
1. Alteration of membrane potential and inhibition of the ATP 
synthase, which in turn results in a depletion of ATP levels  
Polymeric Nanostructures 447 
leading to a collapse in energy metabolism and bacterial
cell death [46]. 
2. Cell death induction in multiple drug-resistant bacteria by 
ROS-independent mechanisms. 
11.3 Zinc Oxide 
Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) proliferate the cell membrane 
and act as an antibacterial agent. They show the prolonged 
site of action when incorporated in hydrogel wound dressings 
ZnONPs also enhance wound healing by promoting keratinocyte 
migration, and re-epithelialization [47]. For example, a microporous
chitosan hydrogel/ZnONPs dressing was available having a 
high capacity for wound exudates and enabling the formation of 
hemostatic blood clots [48].
ZnO nanoparticles are commonly utilized in the formulation 
of cosmetics, skin creams, and ointments because they have 
antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic qualities. Zn ions 
are released from the nanomaterial via a biphasic mechanism.
As Zn ions first come into contact with biological fluids, they get 
hydrated to form hydrated ZnO, which functions as a bactericidal 
agent [49].
Bellaire et al. performed a study to evaluate the drugs 
incorporated in ZnONPs with the matrix composed of collagen and 
essential oil. The nanodressings accelerated the wound closure 
and prevent fungal growth showing excellent biocompatibility and 
reduced cytotoxicity [50]. 
11.4 Polymeric Nanostructures (Hydrogels and 
Gelatin) 
Polymers are long-chain organic molecules, having several 
repeating monomer units. To overcome the drawbacks of natural 
polymers such as DNA, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, and collagen. 
The functional properties of polymers are tailored via the mode 
of synthesis and made variable with the specific requirements 
and biological applications. They had a low cost of production 448 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
and were very adaptable when it came to dressing materials 
[51]. These polymers are presently utilized in the production of 
surgical instruments, medical equipment, implanted devices, and 
vascular grafts. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene 
(PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyamides (nylon), and 
polysiloxanes (silicone) are some examples of synthetic polymers 
that are often utilized, whereas natural polymers include [52]. 
Using synthetic polymeric nanostructures, scaffolds, vascular 
grafts, biological carriers, and surgical sutures that have a long 
shelf life and low cost of manufacturing. Some of the commonly
used polymeric nanomaterials were discussed below such as 
polymeric hydrogels, and gelatin [53]. 
Polymeric hydrogel is a type of polymer having a positive 
response to enhanced tissue restoration. At the preliminary 
stage of tissue restoration, the hydrogel scaffold can stimulate the 
infiltration of inflammatory cells and enhances the activity of 
angiogenic cells which aids in an improved healing process. 
The cytokines or growth factors act as an adjuvant to the 
polymeric hydrogel and enhance the blood vessel formation, neo￾vascularization, and microenvironment around the wound area 
which promotes healing at a rapid rate [54]. 
Gelatin, a naturally occurring polymer made from collagen, 
has mostly been used to make biodegradable and biocompatible 
materials for wound dressings [55].
Bilgic et al. reported in a study about the topical application 
of gelatin-based scaffolds to rat wounds result in improved and
faster-wound healing. Fibrin is a natural polymer, created when
the enzyme thrombin reacts with fibrinogen to form fibrin. 
Fibrin has distinctive qualities that include reducing inflammation, 
boosting the immune system’s response, and enhancing cell
adhesion which employs its benefits in tissue engineering and 
wound healing [56]. 
11.5 Nanocomposites or Composite 
Nanoparticles 
Polymeric nanoparticles (like chitosan) are used in polymeric 
nanomaterial therapy as wound dressings or as delivery vehicles Nanocomposites or Composite Nanoparticles 449 
because they have antibacterial and re-epithelializing capabilities 
[57]. 
Chitosan is a hydrophilic biopolymer having high
bioavailability, low toxicity, and antibacterial properties.
Chitosan is a biopolymer having chains of linear polysaccharides
containing D-glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine units [58]. 
Chitosan’s cationic nature causes it to form complexes with 
anions like sulfate and phosphate as well as with metals, proteins,
and dyes. Hydrogels, membranes, films, sponges, and scaffolds 
are just a few of the different ways that chitosan has been
studied for wound-healing treatments. Chitosan nanoparticles 
possess superior permeability, antibacterial properties, and immune 
modulation properties [59]. 
Chen et al. reported in a study that using the chitosan 
oligosaccharide a novel acellular porcine dermal matrix was 
developed. To maintain acceptable physicochemical characteristics, 
the oxidized chitosan oligosaccharide was cross-linked with the 
acellular network. To create AgNPs in situ, the newly produced 
compound Ag ions were further treated with the free remaining 
aldehyde groups (redox reaction). The resulting scaffolds have 
good biocompatibility, wide spectrum antibacterial activity against 
Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and expedited wound 
healing [60]. 
Hajji et al. reported in a study that silver nanoparticles 
increased antioxidant and antibacterial activity against both Gram￾positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia 
coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) bacteria when coupled with 
polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan. This combination enhanced wounds 
by promoting granulation and re-epithelialization with reducing 
cytotoxicity in vivo models [61]. 
Mihai et al. observed that coatings containing nanospheres
of polylactic acid, chitosan, magnetite, and eugenol reduced the 
growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
biofilms while promoting endothelium proliferation [62]. 
Gao et al. reported In response to activation by near-infrared 
light, a thermosensitive hydrogel-based drug reservoir was 
created that can release active ingredients as needed. To integrate 
complementing antibacterial defense mechanisms, they used 
ciprofloxacin, glycol chitosan, and polydopamine nanoparticles.  
 
450 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
Bacteria were drawn to and trapped on the surface of the gel by 
the glycol chitosan’s positive charge. Near-infrared light can activate 
polydopamine nanoparticles, causing a photothermal reaction that 
produced local hyperthermia and caused bacterial annihilation. 
By being exposed to near-infrared light, polydopamine nano￾particles can be made active. This photothermal response causes 
local hyperthermia, which kills bacteria. Additionally, ciprofloxacin 
was loaded into polydopamine nanoparticles and released on 
demand after stimulation with near-infrared light, despite the 
hydrogel complex showing less leakage under physiological
settings [63]. 
Hernandez et al. reported that the nanocomposites of 
AuNPs, chitosan, and calreticulin are used for the treatment of 
diabetic lesions. The calcium-binding protein called calreticulin 
controls the amounts of calcium in the cytosol and endoplasmic 
reticulum. Calreticulin also functions as a molecular chaperone, 
ensuring that proteins are folded correctly. In vitro and in vivo, 
the gold nanoparticles-chitosan-calreticulin composite boosted 
keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cell proliferation,
migration, and differentiation without affecting cell survival. The 
histological analysis also revealed enhanced collagen synthesis, 
granulation, and re-epithelization [64]. 
Sun et al. described in a study that cathelicidin, an anti￾bacterial peptide obtained from king cobras, was encapsulated. 
Bacterial cellulose is a biopolymer produced by a variety of bacteria, 
including Acetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella, during 
the fermentation of carbohydrates. Due to its physicochemical 
characteristics, such as its extremely large surface area per unit, 
enhanced biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and nontoxicity,
bacterial cellulose represents a good skin substitute. Bacterial 
nanocellulose is differentiated by three-dimensional porous
networks with a high ability to retain water, ensuring a moist 
environment ideal for wound healing. ZnONPs were found to have 
antibacterial characteristics and studied the therapeutic effects
of bacterial cellulose mixed with them [65]. 
Moniri et al. mixed silver nanoparticles with bacterial 
nanocellulose produced by the fermentation of the Gram￾negative Gluconacetobacter xylinus (BNC-Ag). The nanocomposite 
inhibited Staphylococcus aureus in vitro colonization and 
accelerated wound healing [66]. Nanocarriers for Wound Healing 451 
11.6 Nanocarriers for Wound Healing (Nitric 
Oxide, Curcumin) 
Nanomaterials can also act as carriers for therapeutic agents 
by controlling their release. Nitric oxide plays a key role in 
inflammatory pathways, cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and
the deposition and remodeling of extracellular matrix. Nitric 
oxide also inhibits the formation of biofilms and possesses broad￾spectrum antibacterial effects. The development of a delivery
method with a high loading capacity, regulated release, and low 
cytotoxicity has thus been the subject of numerous investigations. 
To have prolonged nitric oxide release, antibacterial action against 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, and speed up wound healing in vivo, poly(lactic-co￾glycolic acid)-polyethyleneimine nanoparticles were developed
[67]. 
Nitric oxide: Inflammatory pathways, cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and the deposition and remodeling of an extracellular 
matrix all demonstrate important roles for nitric oxide. Nitric 
oxide also hinders the formation of biofilms while exhibiting 
broad-spectrum antibacterial capabilities. Numerous studies 
have therefore attempted to develop a delivery method with high
loading capacity, regulated release, and little cytotoxicity. To 
increase the pace of wound healing in vivo, methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibacterial 
efficacy, and prolonged nitric oxide release, methicillin-releasing 
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-polyethyleneimine nanoparticles were 
developed [68, 69]. 
Wang et al. for wound treatment developed a novel pH￾responsive calcium alginate hydrogel that contains hyaluronan 
oligosaccharide and protamine nanoparticles. The hydrogel would 
absorb wound exudates, causing the alkaline fluids to diminish. 
As a result of the pH change, the calcium alginate released active 
protamine nanoparticles that killed both Gram-positive and Gram￾negative bacteria. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides also increased 
endothelial cell motility and proliferation, vascular endothelial 
growth factor expression, and angiogenesis [70]. 
Curcumin is a natural moiety, that helps in the production of 
granulation of tissues with antiseptic, antibiotic, and antioxidant 452 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
properties. In a recent study, the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus and improved wound closure activity of curcumin were 
demonstrated in vitro. The researchers attempted to augment 
curcumin’s poor solubility by encapsulating it inside a saline￾hydrogel nanoparticle vector [71]. 
Moradi et al. Curcumin-loaded super-paramagnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles were used to research and analyze pulse 
photo-biomodulation. They demonstrated a significant reduction 
in Staphylococcus aureus colonies and accelerated wound healing 
[72]. 
11.7 Coatings and Scaffolds 
The creation of scaffolds with similar qualities is another use for 
nanomaterials a matrix outside cells. They are made via a variety 
of processes, including electrospinning, self-assembly, and phase 
separation. The method most frequently used, electrospinning, 
produces porous polymeric nanofibers that can act as hybrid
scaffolds to help fibroblasts adhere to and grow in wounds.
Scaffolds offer strong mechanical support and make it easier 
to transfer growth factors to the desired areas, which are 
crucial elements needed for tissue regeneration. However, one 
significant drawback of scaffolds is that they must be implanted
at the desired spot, which restricts their application [73]. An 
additional class of nano-polymer is called a dendrimer, and it 
has anti-inflammatory properties as well as the capacity to form 
networks with antibacterial drugs (e.g., silver).
Another application for nanoparticles is the construction 
of scaffolds with properties similar to the extracellular matrix.
Phase separation, self-assembly, and electrospinning are only a 
few of the techniques used to make them. Porous polymeric 
nanofibers produced can be utilized as hybrid scaffolds to 
promote fibroblast adhesion and growth in wounds. Another
type of nano-polymer is dendrimers, which have both anti￾inflammatory properties and the capacity to form networks 
with antibacterial compounds (e.g., silver) [74]. 
Haik et al. analyzed the healing potential of a polymer
nanofiber dressing applied by a portable handheld electrospinning Coatings and Scaffolds 453 
device using a pig model of superficial partial thickness wounds.
The outcomes were comparable to the conventional dressing in 
terms of safety (risk of infection, delayed healing). The benefits 
of this therapeutic approach include the nontouch method and 
convenience of use [75]. 
Chitosan: It was evident from a study that chitosan was used 
to treat models of diabetic wounds in rats by applying electrospun 
chitosan-poly-vinyl alcohol nanofibrous blend scaffolds, which 
shows increased healing rates compared with controls [76]. 
Hydrogels are versatile materials that can be used to create 
bandages and dressings for burns, acute/chronic wounds, and 
diabetic foot ulcers because of their softness and ease of water 
absorption, which minimizes tissue dehydration. Currently, the 
usage of hydrogels is more common because of their unique 
properties such as ease of administration and firmness with the 
shape of the wound. Hydrogels can retain maximum water due to 
which they are shown to be elastic and flexible. Both hydrogels and 
scaffolds are utilized for the uniform distribution of the growth 
nutrients. Covalent bonding between the growth factor and the 
hydrogel is one of these techniques. Granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) combined with hydrogel
has reportedly been proven to be useful in treating burns and 
promoting tissue regeneration. The regeneration of a variety
of wounded tissues has been studied extensively in pre-clinical 
studies employing hydrogels as drug delivery vehicles, with some 
promising results. In these experiments, growth factors were 
injected as an injectable solution or as hydrogels that had been 
implanted. In certain experiments, a hydrogel and growth
factor mixture is positioned above a scaffold and implanted at 
the location of the injury. For instance, a hydrogel made of fibrin 
and hyaluronic acid that has been BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic 
protein-2) conjugated displays potent bone regeneration
properties [77]. 
11.7.1 Heparin Hydrogel 
Heparin hydrogel coated by a polylactide caprolactone scaffold
aids in bone regeneration and formation [78]. 454 Nano-Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Wound Healing 
11.7.2 Gelatin Hydrogel 
A gelatin hydrogel with a tricalcium phosphate porous scaffold 
filled with fibrin gel mixed with vascular endothelial growth
factor for bone defects and a poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold loaded 
with fibroblast growth factor for bone regeneration. Researchers 
developed novel methods to create a covalent connection 
between the growth factors and hydrogels to prevent the rupture 
of growth factors from hydrogels. This led to the development 
of hydrogels with a novel feature of prolonged growth
factor release from a heparin-binding growth factor hydrogel at
the targeted site. Scientists have developed a fibrin hydrogel 
nanomaterial with a covalently bonded peptide that interacts with 
the growth factor (neurotrophin-3), a method that has been used 
to successfully treat spinal cord injuries [79]. 
11.7.3 Marketed Preparations Having Nanocompounds 
Used in Wound Healing 
Various commercially available dressings contain AgNPs. Acticoat, 
a wound dressing comprising AgNPs with an average size of 15 nm,
serves as an example of this. The majority of test volunteers 
experienced Acticoat’s established benefits of pain relief, wound 
healing, and infection reduction at the wound site. For the 
treatment of burns, this coating is still being researched. Recent 
clinical trials found that using Anticoat along with creams 
containing silver sulphadiazine and chlorhexidine digluconate
may be effective in preventing infections in burns [80, 81]. 
11.8 Conclusion 
Inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling all take place
throughout the complex three-stage process of wound healing. 
A variety of topical treatments with moist environments and 
antibacterial activity have been developed by researchers to 
promote a speedy recovery with minimal scarring. But because 
of bacterium biofilms and multidrug-resistant germs, treating 
wounds is still difficult. To overcome this issue, nanoparticles

due to their vibrant advantages such as high surface-to-volume 
ratio implanted and used in a wide range of medicinal applications, 
including wound therapy.
Nanotechnology, often known as nanomedicine, is a rapidly 
growing subject in the medical field that provides significant 
therapeutic advancements for a variety of ailments, including 
wound healing. The primary goal of this review is to illustrate the 
diverse ways in which nanomedicine might be used to speed up 
the healing of wounds. To that end, we have extensively described 
how nanoparticles interact with wounds to promote the healing 
process.
Wound dressings with metal nanoparticle coatings show good 
antibacterial activity and are crucial to the healing of wounds. 
Gelatin, hydrogel, and other wound dressing materials coupled with 
peptide and polymeric nanostructures showed enhanced results 
for cell proliferation, epithelialization, collagen fiber deposition, 
tissue regeneration, and wound closure. The combination of 
nanoparticles and biopolymers accelerates tissue regeneration
and wound healing.

Nanotechnology is a budding field that has led to breakthroughs
in novel drug delivery system-based cosmetic formulations and
it is relatively a new, extremely promising, and well-researched 
area. It has been demonstrated that nanotechnology-based
cosmetics overcome the shortcomings linked with conven￾tional products while also adding more valuable properties to a
formulation. Conventional delivery techniques have been sub￾stantially supplanted by nanoemulsions, liposomes, niosomes,
microemulsions, nanostructured lipid carriers, solid lipid nanopar￾ticles, and nanospheres. Nanocosmetics and nanocosmeceuticals
for dental purposes, hair, nails, skin, as well as lips have been
the subject of extensive research. Additionally, the incorporation
of nanoparticles increases the efficacy of formulation and cus￾tomer gratification. As a result, nanocosmeceuticals are replacing
many conventional cosmeceuticals. Nonetheless, nanotoxicological

investigations on nanocosmeceuticals have shown several obsta￾cles. This chapter provides a summary of the nanotechnology￾based methodologies employed in the delivery of cosmetics and
cosmeceuticals, as well as the techniques used to characterize them. 
It describes their benefits in addition to any potential health and
environmental hazards. It is an essential resource for materi￾als scientists and pharmaceutical scientists who wish to gain a
deeper knowledge of how nanotechnology is being applied to
the development of the next generation of cosmetics. Finally,
the purpose of this chapter is to give a brief introduction to
nanocosmetics and nanocosmeceuticals and discuss how they 
are used in the cosmetical industry, in order to help consumers
and regulators understand the benefits as well as the toxicity
associated with their extended use, thereby promoting its prudent 
usage. 
12.1 Introduction
The use of cosmetics by humans dates back a long time, and both
men and women place a great value on these goods, which are
mostly used for improving the appearance of the skin. These
products are usually applied externally and are made up of 
natural or synthetic derivatives [1]. Cosmetics are defined by 
the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) as 
a formulation “intended to be applied to the human body for 
cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractive-ness, or altering the 
appearance without affecting the body’s structure or functions.” 
This expansive definition encompasses any substance suggested
for use as a component of a cosmetic product, with the clear 
exclusion of soap [2]. However, the term “cosmeceutical” is not 
defined in this act. According to European Union Cosmetics
Directive (EUCD) cosmetics are “any substance or preparation 
intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts
of the human body (epidermis, hair system, nails, lips, and external 
genital organs) or with the teeth and the mucous membranes of
the oral cavity with a view exclusively or mainly of cleaning them, 
perfuming them, changing their appearance and/or correcting body 
odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good condition” 
[3]. As per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Rules 1945  
Introduction 471 
cosmetic is defined as “any article intended to be rubbed, poured, 
sprinkled or sprayed on, or introduced into, or otherwise applied 
to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, 
promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and includes 
any article intended for use as a component of cosmetic” [4]. 
Regardless of the above-mentioned definitions, many countries’ 
cosmetic definitions are substantially broader. In certain developed 
countries, cosmetic is considered merely beauty materials [5]. 
Cosmeceuticals are cosmetics that contain therapeutically active 
substances that have special healing properties when applied to the 
skin using traditional cosmetics. Dermatological disorders such as 
aging effects, xeroderma, melasma, rhytids, blemishes, hair shaft 
fracture, and other disorders are treated with these products, which 
have demonstrable skin and hair regenerative effects. They promise 
an improvement in look by bridging the gap between medications 
and cosmetics [6, 7]. Currently, the market for personalized care is 
expanding quickly, and one of the personal care industry’s fastest￾growing segments is cosmeceuticals [8]. Since this is the fastest￾growing industry, more research, exploration, and application of 
nanocosmeceuticals are required. Nanocosmeceuticals’ positive and 
negative aspects are compared in Fig. 12.1.
Nanotechnology and nanodelivery systems are cutting￾edge scientific disciplines involving the design, characterization, 
fabrication, and use of nanoscale materials, devices, and systems 
(1–100 nm). Nanotechnology, which is widely recognized as a game￾changer, is the subject of intensive research in the cosmetics and 
cosmeceuticals industries [9, 10]. The inclusion of nanotechnology 
has led to improvements in cosmetic science, which have raised 
global consumer demand [11]. Nanomaterials are rapidly gaining 
popularity in this industry since they offer more advantages
than conventional cosmetics. In addition, various nanomaterial 
combination holds the greatest contribution to the expansion
of the global pharmaceutical and cosmetics arena. According
to estimates, the global market for nanomaterials was worth 
USD 8.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to increase by up to
13.1% annually from 2020 to 2027 [12]. Even though gold and
silver nanoparticles have been used in cosmetics for a while,
the number of applications has grown recently. 472 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
Figure 12.1 Nanocosmeceuticals’ positive and negative aspects. Novel Nanocarriers for Cosmetic Drug Delivery Systems 473 
12.2 The Benefits and Limitations of Nanodrug 
Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
Cosmetic manufacturers use nano-sized components to improve 
a variety of characteristics, including enhanced sun protection 
factor (SPF)-based sun protection, tinted color texture, deeper 
skin permeability, prolonged stay effect, and delayed skin aging
effects. Controlling active ingredient delivery, target-specific, 
and increasing drug-loading potential are ways to lengthen the
duration of action. All of these reasons contribute to their rising 
consumer acceptance, necessitating scientific investigations to 
resolve safe usage issues. Anti-aging medications have frequently 
been made using nanocosmeceuticals. The products used for
skincare, hair, and nails, among other things, are effectively
promoted with the claim that they promote hair growth, protect 
hair shaft fracture, and improve the hydrating potential of skin
and hair, hence enhancing the efficacy of cosmetic goods [13, 14].
In terms of stability, scalability, toxicity, expense, and so on, they
have various disadvantages. Moreover, nanomaterials’ toxico￾logical and safety profiles are nowadays a matter of controversy. 
Nanoparticles interact better with their microenvironment 
because they are small, have a lot of surface area, and have 
a positive charge on their surface. The dosage of an active 
substance has a bigger impact on its bioavailability than its 
physicochemical properties [15]. In the case of beauty products, 
one of the primary issues associated with the creation of 
nanoformulations is that they may increase the concentration 
of active compounds entering the circulation, hence influencing 
toxicity. 
12.3 Novel Nanocarriers for Cosmetic Drug
Delivery Systems 
12.3.1 Liposomes
Liposomes are most frequently used in cosmetic products
which have a vesicular structure comprising a hydrophilic core 
surrounded by-layer of lipids. The fundamental lipid ingredient 474 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
of liposomes are generally phospholipids, which are considered
to have lesser harmful consequences [16]. Liposomes encapsulate 
the medicine and release its active elements in a regulated
manner to prevent metabolic breakdown [17]. Liposomes may 
transport both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances and 
has a unilamellar/multilamellar structure. Its particle size is
> 20 nm [18]. In order to increase the physical and chemical
stability of liposomes when distributed in water, antioxidants 
including carotenoids, CoQ10, and lycopene as well as active 
ingredients like vitamins A, E, and K have been included [19].
The essential component of liposomes is phosphatidylcholine,
which is used in skincare and hair products, such as moisturizing 
creams, shampoos, and conditioners, because of its certain 
properties such as emollient and hair-smoothening potential. 
Numerous cosmeceuticals employ liposomes because they
retain the active ingredient and are biocompatible as well as non￾toxic [20]. Vegetable phospholipids are extensively utilized in 
cosmetics and dermatology as they contain a high concentration 
of esterified fatty acids. Due to this property, they are commonly 
employed for cosmetics meant for dermatological applications. 
Following the application of linoleic acid, the skin’s barrier
function improves rapidly and water loss diminishes. Due to 
their surface activity, vegetable and soy phospholipids are used 
to generate liposomes. These phospholipids are responsible
for linoleic acid delivery into the skin [21, 22]. From the clinical 
studies [23] data, it has been observed that liposomes aid in the 
lessening of rhytid and have other beneficial benefits, such as 
lowering acne and enhancing skin smoothness. Liposomes are
being used in cosmetic formulations such as antiperspirants,
deodorants, body sprays, lipsticks, skin lotions, sunscreen, anti￾aging creams, anti-alopecia agents, and skin-brightening creams. 
12.3.2 Niosomes
Niosomes, a multilamellar or unilamellar structure are generated 
from the bilayer organization of surfactant macromolecules 
[24, 25]. The diameter ranges from 10 to 3000 nm [26].
Niosomes are prepared using nonionic surfactants like Tweens,
Spans, Brijs, sorbitan ester, alkyl amides, polyoxyethylene alkyl Novel Nanocarriers for Cosmetic Drug Delivery Systems 475 
ether, crown ester, and steroid-linked surfactants [27]. Niosomes
transport hydrophilic as well as lipophilic drugs. Niosomes are 
a revolutionary medication delivery mechanism [28] for drugs 
that have poor permeation. They encapsulate the drug, which
prolongs the drug’s duration in systemic circulation and enhances 
its tissue penetration. Niosomes eliminate the disadvantages 
of liposomes, including instability, high cost, and oxidation 
susceptibility [29]. They are used in cosmetic and dermatological 
products because of their capacity to reversibly diminish the 
horny layer’s barrier resistance, enabling the active component
to penetrate the living tissues more swiftly. Numerous factors 
influence noisome formation, including surfactant nature and 
type, the characteristic of the drug, the composition of the lipid 
membrane, as well as parameters that affect the shape and
size of niosomes [30]. Proniosomes are niosomes made up of
nonionic surfactant vesicles that are immediately hydrated to 
generate niosome dispersions. Moreover, they are also employed
to enhance medication delivery [31, 32].
Through the study and development of synthetic liposomes, 
L’Oréal prepared the production of niosomes in 1970. In 
1987, L’Oréal patented niosomes and marketed them under the
trade name Lancome. Numerous marketed niosomes cosmetic 
formulations are antirhytid creams, moisturizing and skin 
whitening creams, and anti-alopecia shampoos and conditioners. 
12.3.3 Solid Lipid Nanoparticles
At the beginning of the 1990s, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) 
were introduced as an effective substitute for standard lipoidal 
carriers. Solid lipid nanoparticles range in size from 50 to 1000 nm
[33]. They consist of a single layer of shells surrounding an 
oily or lipoidal center. A matrix drug is a form of drug delivery
system in which the drug is homogenously dispersed or dissolved
in the solid core which is made up of solid lipids or combinations 
of solid lipids. The hydrophobic chains of phospholipids are 
incorporated into the lipid matrix. They have a composition of 
complex glyceride mixtures, waxes, lipids, and triglycerides [34]. 
Active compounds that are lipophilic, hydrophilic, and poorly
water-soluble can be coupled with physiological and biocompatible 476 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
lipids to generate SLNs. By preparing SLN using biocompatible 
chemicals, toxicity concerns are minimized [35]. The two most 
common techniques for preparing SLNs are homogenization
under high pressure and precipitation. It is possible to achieve 
prolonged release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) using
this technology.
SLN with a drug-enriched core exhibits sustained release, 
whereas SLN with a drug-enriched shell demonstrates burst release 
[36, 37]. They have proved to be prominent in nanocosmetics 
because they are constituted of lipids (biodegradable) with minimal 
toxic effects. Due to their nanoscale size, they easily penetrate
the skin’s outer layer, hence enhancing the skin permeation of
drugs [38].
Because SLNs are resistant to UV rays and function as physical 
sunscreens on their own, they can provide enhanced photo￾protection with fewer negative effects when paired with molecular 
sunscreen [38]. To enhance UV protection, solid lipid nanoparticles 
are being produced as carriers for 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoylchitin
and vitamin E sunscreen [38]. SLNs have an occlusive feature that 
can be exploited to enhance skin moisture [39]. SLNs are also 
employed in perfume compositions since they delay the perfume’s 
release over a longer length of time and are perfect for day 
creams [40, 41]. They have greater coalescence stability than 
liposomes due to their solid form and the restricted movement
of incorporated API preventing their leakage from the drug
delivery system. 
12.3.4 Nanostructured Lipid Carriers
Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are nanocarriers that belong 
to second-generation nanoparticles consisting of lipid carriers, 
surfactants with nanostructures. They were developed to address 
the shortcomings of SLN [42, 43]. On the basis of formulation 
composition and production parameters, NLCs are divided 
into three types: imperfect, amorphous, and multiple emulsion
type [44]. The usual diameter of NLCs falls between 10 and
1000 nm. 
In recent years, there has been significant scientific and 
commercial interest in NLC due to the lower likelihood of Novel Nanocarriers for Cosmetic Drug Delivery Systems 477 
systemic side effects. NLC has a greater drug-loading capability
for entrapped bioactive chemicals than SLN due to its twisted 
shape. NLC formulation addresses other SLN issues, such as 
particle concentration and drug ejection during storage. They
consist of biodegradable and physiological lipids with a low 
level of toxicity [45]. The modified drug delivery profile of NLC 
is characterized by a specialized pattern of drug release in which
a sudden burst eventually leading to constant-rate continuous
drug flow is achieved. Their occlusive qualities promote skin 
hydration, and their small size enables faster drug penetration
across the stratum corneum. There is increased UV protection 
with fewer adverse effects, as well as steady drug integration 
during storage. In October 2005, the first products containing
lipid nanoparticles, NanoRepair Q10® cream and NanoRepair 
Q10® serum, were released to the cosmetics market by Dr. Rimpler 
GmbH, Germany, giving greater skin penetration [46]. 
12.3.5 Nanoemulsions
Nanoemulsions are liquid dispersions that are kinetically or 
thermodynamically stable and comprise an oil phase, a water 
phase, and a surfactant. Depending on the manner of preparation, 
their structure can be altered to create a range of goods. On
the basis of their composition, oil in water, water in oil, 
and bicontinuous nanoemulsions are the three varieties of 
nanoemulsions. They range in size from 50 to 200 nm. This 
is a dispersed phase consisting of nanodroplets with minimal
oil/water interfacial tension [47]. They possess a hydrophobic 
core which is surrounded by a phospholipid monomolecular 
layer making them more appropriate to transport hydrophobic 
substances. 
With nanoemulsions, flocculation, coalescence, sedimentation, 
and creaming are not issues, as they are with macromolecules. 
Nanoemulsions exhibit low viscosity, strong kinetic stability, a 
wide interfacial area, and a high solubilization capacity [48]. They 
have been commonly employed in cosmeceuticals (sunscreens, 
deodorants, lotions, nail enamels, shampoos, hair serums, and 
conditioners) as delivery vehicles [49]. Nanoemulsions are utilized 
in the formulation of cosmetics to offer quick penetration into 478 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
stratum corneum, to transfer API, and to hydrate the skin. Gold 
nanoparticles are tiny gold particles with a diameter between
1 and 100 nm, and are known as colloidal gold when dispersed
in water. The size range of gold nanoparticles or nanogold lies 
between 5 and 400 nm. The interaction between particles as well 
as the aggregation of nanogold particles are crucial for defining 
their characteristics [50]. They include nanospheres, nanoshells, 
nanoclusters, nanorods, nanostars, nanocubes, branching
nanotriangles, and nanotriangles. Nanogold particles’ resonance 
frequency is significantly affected by their shape, size, ambient 
conditions, and dielectric characteristics. Due to aggregation, the 
hue of nanogold ranges from red to violet to nearly black [51]. 
Natural inert gold nanoparticles are highly stable, biocompatible, 
and noncytotoxic. Nanogold is nonbleaching following membrane 
staining and is available conjugated and unconjugated [52]. 
Additionally, it is available in conjugated and unconjugated forms. 
Since they have nano-sized sphere particles, wide surface area,
and crystallinity, they contain high drug-loading capacity and
can easily penetrate skin cells [53].
Because of nanogold particles’ potent antifungal as well as 
antibacterial activity, they are considered a promising candidate 
in cosmetics. Cosmetic companies like L’Oréal and L’Core Paris 
are using gold nanoparticles to make more effective creams and 
lotions. Increased blood circulation, anti-inflammatory qualities, 
antibacterial capabilities, improved skin firmness and elasticity, 
slowing the aging process, and revitalizing skin metabolism
are some of the key benefits of nanogold in beauty care [54]. 
12.3.6 Nanospheres
Nanospheres are solid particles that have a spherical structure
with a core-shell configuration. Their diameter lies below 
200 nm. The medicine is shielded against chemical and enzymatic
destruction by being entrapped, dissolved, connected, or 
encapsulated in nanospheres. The medication is physically and 
evenly disseminated in the polymer matrix system. In nature, 
nanospheres can be either crystalline or amorphous [55]. Because 
it can transform drugs with poor bioavailability, penetrability,
and low solubility into effective pharmaceutical as well as Novel Nanocarriers for Cosmetic Drug Delivery Systems 479 
cosmetic products, this technology has a lot of promise. Nanospheres 
can contain enzymes, DNA, and medicines in their cores [56].
The two types of nanospheres are biodegradable as well as 
nonbiodegradable in nature. Gelatin, starch (modified), and albumin 
nanospheres are all biodegradable, with polylactic acid being 
the sole acceptable polymer. Nanospheres have been explored 
in dermatological products and cosmetics for transferring API 
deeper into the stratum corneum layer accurately and efficiently. 
These minute pieces are helpful in preventing actinic aging. 
Nanospheres are increasingly being used in cosmetics, particularly 
in dermatological formulations including anti-acne, moisturizing, 
and antirhytid creams. 
12.3.7 Dendrimers
Dendrimers are multivalent nanoparticles with bulbous, micellar 
nanostructures that are extensively branched and unimolecular. 
A dendrimer is usually made up of a core onto which one or
more series of arborescent engrafted branches are grafted, and 
it exhibits a spherical three-dimensional morphology [57]. The 
presence of numerous series branches depicts the dendrimer’s 
generation. They are tiny, with dimensions ranging from 2 to 
20 nm [58]. Its additional characteristics, such as polyvalence, 
monodispersity, and stability, make them an attractive drug 
delivery carrier. For targeting reasons, terminal groups are 
changed to attach biologically active compounds. Drugs are 
both integrated into the interior and connected to the surface 
of dendrimers, allowing for regulated release from the inner 
core [59]. Dendrimers are a novel type of macromolecular 
architecture that is being employed in hair, skin, and nail care 
as nanotechnology-based cosmeceuticals. Dendrimers can be 
found in shampoos, sunscreens, hair styling gels, and anti-acne
treatments, among other cosmetics. 
12.3.8 Carbon Nanotubes
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most innovative 
nanotechnology innovations. They are made up of rolled graphene 
that has been hybridized with SP2. These are hollow cylindrical 
threads with graphene walls constructed as a hexagonal carbon 480 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
lattice, rolled at specified and distinct “chiral” angles. Individual 
carbon nanotubes form “ropes” that are organically kept together
by p-stacking. Their size ranges between 0.7 and 50 nm [60, 61]. 
CNTs are extremely small and light. Single-walled (SW), double￾walled (DW), and multiwalled (MW) CNTs are the three varieties
of carbon nanotubes. SW-CNTs comprise a 1–2 nm diameter 
graphene sheet (single rolled), DW-CNTs are composed of 2 
concentric CNTs, and MW-CNTs comprise multiple layers of
2–50 nm diameter graphene tubes [62]. Laser ablation, arc 
discharge, flame synthesis, chemical vapor deposition, and silane 
solution are the most common CNT production processes. 
12.3.9 Polymersomes
Polymersomes are artificial vesicles made up of block copolymer 
amphiphiles that self-assemble around a core aqueous cavity. 
They can be employed for both lipophilic and hydrophilic
medicines because they have a hydrophilic inner core and a 
lipophilic bilayer, while the hydrophobic core generates a protein￾friendly environment [63]. Polymerases are exceedingly versatile 
and biologically stable. Biodegradable or stimuli-responsive
block copolymers can simply alter their drug encapsulation 
and release capabilities. The radius ranges from 50 nm to 5 
micrometers or more [64]. Drugs, proteins, peptides, enzymes, 
DNA, and RNA fragments can all be encapsulated and protected 
by polymerases. In most cases, synthetic block copolymers have 
been employed to make polymersomes. Polymersomes with varied 
characteristics, responsiveness to stimuli, membrane thickness,
and permeabilities can be generated since the composition and 
molecular weight of these polymers can be modified [65, 66].
They can target and control medication release thanks to the 
flexibility of the polymersome membrane. Because they have a
thick and rigid bilayer, they are more stable than liposomes. 
12.3.10 Cubosomes
Cubosomes are advanced nanoparticles that have a discrete 
structure with sub-micron-sized crystalline particles. Cubosomes 
are generated when aqueous lipid and surfactant solutions are 
combined in a precise ratio with water and a microstructure [40]. Major Nanocosmeceuticals 481 
They are a bicontinuous cubic liquid phase in which two distinct 
regions of water are separated by surfactant-controlled bilayers
and wrapped into a three-dimensional, periodic, and minimum 
surface, resulting in a densely packed structure [41].
Cubosomes have a honeycomb-like (cavernous) structure 
and have a slightly round appearance. Their diameter is between 
10 and 500 nm, and they can incorporate all natural compounds 
(like lipophobic, lipophilic, and amphiphilic). They offer bioactive 
compounds having sustained and prolonged release with site￾specificity [44, 45]. Cubosomes offer an appealing option for
cosmetic products. Thus several cosmetics manufacturers are 
researching them.
The nanocarriers for cosmetics drug delivery systems are 
shown in Fig. 12.2. 
12.4 Major Nanocosmeceuticals
The fastest-growing section of the personal care market is 
cosmetic pharmaceuticals. In nail, hair, lip, and skin care, a vast
array of nanocosmeceuticals is used. 
12.4.1 Skin Care
Cosmeceuticals for skin care products are used in the treatment 
of lichenification (skin texture). They augment the protection 
of the skin by increasing collagen production and ameliorating
the production of reactive oxygen species (free radicals). Also, 
they possess the property to rejuvenate the skin by preserving
the keratin. Nanoparticles of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium
dioxide (TiO2) are efficient in sun protective lotions for skin 
protecting by reaching stratum basale, rendering all products
less oily, odorous, and transparent. Because they produce a thin
film of humectants and retain moisture for an extended length
of time, SLNs, nanoemulsions, liposomes, and niosomes are 
often employed in moisturizing formulations. Nanocosmeceutical 
anti-aging solutions that contain liposomes, nanocapsules,
nanospheres as well as nanosomes, demonstrate benefits like 
collagen restoration, enhancing skin texture, skin firming, and 
tightening. 482 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
Figure 12.2 Nanocarriers for cosmetics drug delivery systems Major Nanocosmeceuticals 483 
12.4.2 Hair Care
Nanocosmeceutical goods for hair include shampoos, conditioning 
agents, hair growth boosters, coloring, and style treatments. 
Nanoparticles’ inherent features and size make it possible to 
target hair follicles and shafts with an increased amount of active 
substance. By extending resident contact time with the scalp and
hair follicles and generating a protective film, nanoparticles in 
shampoos trap moisture within the cuticles. The objective of 
conditioning nanocosmeceutical compounds is to add softness, 
sheen, silkiness, and gloss while also facilitating hair detangling. 
Novel carriers, including niosomes, microemulsions, nano￾emulsions, nanospheres, and liposomes, play a crucial role in 
mending damaged cuticles, restoring texture and gloss, and 
making hair nongreasy, lustrous, and less brittle. 
12.4.3 Lip Care
The nanocosmetics for lip care items include lipstick, balm, gloss, 
oil, and volumizer. A variety of nanoparticles can be used in lip 
gloss and lipstick to soften the lips by minimizing transepidermal
water loss, as well as to prevent pigments from migrating from 
the lips and prolong the retention of lip color. Lip volumizer using 
liposomes augments lip volume, moisturizes and defines the lips, 
and fills in lip contour lines. 
12.4.4 Nail Care
Nanocosmeceutical-based nail care solutions are superior to 
conventional ones. As a result of nanotechnology, nail polishes
have advantages such as rapid drying, durability, chip resistance, 
and application simplicity. In order to improve the treatment of 
onychomycosis, medicated nail lacquer formulations like silica￾coated silver nanoparticles have been created for efficient drug 
delivery of antifungals. 484 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
12.5 Characterization
12.5.1 Biological Evaluation of Nanocarriers
After nanocarriers have been well characterized, effectiveness 
and safety testing can be conducted [62]. Utilizing efficacy tests 
to evaluate its performance. Nanocarrier cellular toxicity is 
measured by cell viability and other safety studies [63, 64]. In vitro 
release and skin permeation/penetration assays are routinely 
employed as efficacy tests [9, 11, 13, 31]. Assays such as cell 
uptake [65, 66], antioxidant activity [67], moisturizing impact 
[62], and nanoencapsulated chemical content [68] are frequently 
utilized as efficacy assessments. Because in vitro release simulates 
the discharge of a chemical, it is commonly utilized. Typically, 
nanocarriers outperform conventional formulations (lacking 
nanocarriers), hence promoting the release of the nanoencapsulated 
material [69]. In addition, nanocarriers display a burst release 
followed by a continuous release [11, 13, 21, 31, 35]. This longer 
effect is advantageous because it minimizes the frequency of 
product reapplications. Moreover, the release characteristics of 
each nanocarrier vary to some degree [11, 21]. (for instance, see 
[21]) Consequently, it is conceivable, depending on the objective, 
to prepare NLC instead of SNL to enhance substance release. 
Alterations in nanocarrier constituents can also modulate biological 
effects. Quantitative differences in the nanocarrier composition 
affect the in vitro release and moisturizing impact [13]. The purpose 
of skin penetration/permeation investigations is to identify the 
position of a substance in the skin layers (penetration) and/or 
its presence in the receptor media (skin permeation) [5, 36]. In 
the same manner as in vitro release experiments influence skin 
distribution profiles, nanocarrier type influences skin distribution 
profiles. Nanoemulsions have a lower skin retention rate than 
NLC. Permeation may occur in nanoemulsions as well [6, 11]. They 
enable better skin penetration than conventional formulations, 
regardless of the kind of nanocarrier [8]. Permeation (detection 
in the bloodstream) is undesired in cosmetic products, whereas 
penetration/retention in the epidermis or dermis is desirable [8]. 1

It is also worth noting that nanoencapsulating vegetable
components help them stay in the epidermis and dermis longer 
[5, 9, 35]. This study is significant because it assures the improved 
efficacy of vegetable elements loaded with nanocarriers, which 
is important given the growing popularity of natural substances 
in cosmetics [5]. Cell uptake is a study that confirms the location/
deposition of nanoencapsulated compounds on the skin in addition 
to skin permeation. Nanoencapsulation of vegetable components 
alters their skin distribution and enables skin retention, as 
revealed by confocal microscopy [38]. Additionally, increasing 
cellular absorption with nanocarriers with a positive electrical
charge (CSLN) is an approach [68]. Cell viability, on the other 
hand, is, as previously said, a safety test. Nanosystems can be 
hazardous to cells and tissues, therefore verifying their safety
is crucial. Nanocarriers with low cytotoxicity are deemed safe
[11, 25, 26]. Other efficacy tests show that nanocarriers 486 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
outperform. Nanoencapsulation increases the antioxidant activity 
of vegetable components [12, 26]. Nanocarriers also aid in skin 
moisturization [10, 34], with the moisturizing impact varying 
depending on the carrier makeup [10]. Entrapped compounds’ 
photostability is increased by nanocarriers, which impacts their 
antioxidant activity. Because light degrades less of a material, 
more of it is accessible to act as an antioxidant [11, 24]. 
Characterization parameters for nanocarriers are shown in 
Table 12.1. 
12.5.2 Biological Evaluation of Nanocosmetics
Nanocosmetics are evaluated using the same assays as nanocarriers, 
such as penetration/skin permeation, skin moisturization, and 
antioxidant activity. For semi-solid forms, other tests such as the 
sun protection factor (SPF) and ultraviolet A protection factor 
(UVA-PF) are utilized [31]. Substance buildup in skin layers and, 
if any, permeation are governed by skin penetration/permeation. 
Penetration and/or permeation will be desirable depending on 
the type of product. Antioxidants are better absorbed through 
the epidermis and dermis [69]. Furthermore, nanocosmetics 
components alter skin permeation/penetration, regardless of 
whether they are nanocarrier or semi-solid form substances [25]. 
Nanocosmetics have been demonstrated to retain and penetrate
the skin better than traditional cosmetics [26]. SPF and UVA-PF
efficacy tests are used to assess UVB and UVA protection, 
respectively [70]. In these tests, nanocosmetics outperformed 
conventional cosmetics. Cosmetics with varied quantitative
compositions of nanocarriers have varying SPF and PF-UVA
values [71]. Nanoencapsulation also increases UV protection 
(for example, see [16]). UV protection has also been achieved 
using nanocosmetics containing vegetable oil associations [12]. 
Moisturizing impact is routinely studied in vitro [19, 26] or in 
people [18, 20], and is a key component in moisturizing and anti￾aging cosmetics [20]. Because of their adhesive capabilities, 
composition [18, 20], and semi-solid vehicle composition [17], 
cosmetics containing lipid nanocarriers have moisturizing effects. 
After irradiation, nanocosmetics retain antioxidant action. Once 
endogenous antioxidants are reduced by UV radiation exposure, Major Challenges of Using Nanomaterials for Cosmetic Applications 487 
these nanocosmetics can be employed as anti-aging cosmetics [26]. 
Another significant test is skin toxicity evaluation, which aims to
detect any irritation induced by nanocosmetics [19]. Photo￾stabilization is another benefit of nanocosmetics. Nanocosmetics 
can help nanoencapsulated substances last longer [23]. The 
biological efficiency of multifunctional nanocosmetics can also be 
improved [72]. Furthermore, a trend toward more complicated 
cosmetics that include nanocarriers, inorganic nanoparticles, and 
traditional cosmetic chemicals (without the use of nanotechnology) 
[73] has emerged. 
12.6 Major Challenges of Using Nanomaterials 
for Cosmetic Applications 
Nanoparticles have been discovered to cause a wide range of
health and environmental problems in individuals and the 
environment. The toxicity of nanomaterials is determined by
their attributes, which include their smaller size, chemical 
composition, surface structure, solubility, shape, and aggregation. 
Some of the causes of nanotoxicity are listed below: 
12.6.1 Smaller Size of Nanoparticles
The microscopic size of nanoparticles distinguishes them. 
This can alter their physicochemical properties, allowing for 
enhanced absorption and interaction with biological tissues when
compared to their bigger counterparts. Toxicity refers to the 
production of reactive oxygen species such as free radicals, which 
cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to proteins, 
membranes, and DNA. These nanoparticles can easily enter the 
bloodstream via skin or inhalation and be delivered to multiple 
organs due to their small size. The large dose and long residence 
time of nanoparticles in important organs can cause malfunction. 
Carbon nanotubes have been found to kill kidney cells and stop 
them from growing further. Even at low dosages and without UV 
exposure, 20 nm titanium dioxide particles can totally damage 
super-coiled DNA, but 500 nm titanium dioxide particles have
just a limited ability to produce DNA strand breaking. Mice treated 488 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
with 2–5 nm TiO2 nanoparticles demonstrated a significant but 
moderate inflammatory response, according to another study [74]. 
12.6.2 Shape of Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles come in a range of sizes, including spheres, tubes, 
sheets, and other shapes, which may contribute to the health
hazards they represent. A study discovered that exposing the 
abdominal cavities of mice to long carbon nanotubes caused 
abdominal wall inflammation [75]. 
12.6.3 Surface Area of Nanoparticles
As the particle’s size reduces, its surface area increases, enhancing 
its reactivity. Nanomaterials are extremely reactive due to their 
high surface area-to-mass ratio, which provides more surface area 
per weight for chemical reactions to occur. Due to their heightened 
reactivity, some nanoscale particles may be potentially explosive 
and/or photoactive, according to studies. If finely dispersed in 
air and come into touch with a sufficiently potent ignition source, 
several nanomaterials, such as nanoscale titanium dioxide and 
silicon dioxide, may explode [76]. 
12.6.4 Penetration of Nanoparticles via Skin
According to scientific studies, nanoparticles can permeate the
skin, especially when the skin is flexed. Broken skin allows
particles as small as 7000 nm to penetrate directly. Acne, eczema, 
and wounds may increase the absorption of nanoparticles into the 
bloodstream, which may lead to additional issues. A preliminary 
investigation found that psoriasis-affected skin was more 
permeable to nanoparticles than healthy skin. Recently, base
carriers have been changed to promote skin penetration by 
integrating physical and chemical penetration enhancers and 
by producing novel vesicular systems, such as ethosomes and 
transferosomes, with enhanced skin penetrability. Additionally, 
bending and massaging the skin can aid nanoparticle penetration. 
According to one study [37–39], when skin is flexed, particles
as small as 1000 nm can be absorbed through unbroken skin and 
reach living cells. Major Challenges of Using Nanomaterials for Cosmetic Applications 489 
12.6.5 Cellular Toxicity of Zinc Oxide and Titanium 
Dioxide Nanoparticles
In a study, Minghong Wu and colleagues from Shanghai
University found that zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles found in 
sunscreens can injure or destroy stem cells in the brains of mice. 
To examine the possible neurotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles,
Wu et al. cultured mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) and treated
them with zinc oxide nanoparticles ranging in size from 10 to
200 nm. After 24 h, the cell viability test demonstrated that ZnO 
nanoparticles exhibited harmful effects on NSCs that were dose￾dependent but not size-dependent. Using confocal microscopy, 
transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry, a large 
number of NSCs exhibited apparent apoptotic characteristics. 
This toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles was found to be induced 
by zinc ions dissolved in the culture media or within the cells.
The NN Research Group’s Arnaud Magrez discovered that 
titanium dioxide-based nanofilaments were cytotoxic, which 
was affected by their shape and increased by the presence of 
surface defects created by chemical treatment. Internalization
of nanofilaments and morphological alterations of cells have 
been observed [40–41, 77]. 
12.6.6 Route and Extent of Exposure
Human health concerns caused by nanoparticles depend on the 
route and degree of exposure to these substances. Nanomaterials 
generally enter the body through three routes. 
12.6.6.1 Inhalation
According to the National Institute of Occupational Health and 
Safety, this is the most common method of nanoparticle exposure. 
If adequate safety devices are not employed, workers may inhale 
nanoparticles while manufacturing them, and consumers may
inhale nanomaterials while using products using nanomaterials, 
such as spray versions of sunscreens containing nanoscale 
titanium dioxide. Officials from the National Institutes of Health 
report that while the vast majority of inhaled particles reach 
the pulmonary tract, animal studies suggest that certain inhaled 490 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
nanomaterials may travel via the nasal nerves to the brain and
get access to the blood, neurological system, and other organs. 
12.6.6.2 Ingestion
Nanomaterials can be swallowed via hand-to-mouth transfer or 
purposeful intake. The bulk of nanoparticles quickly depart the 
body after intake; but, a tiny proportion may be retained and move 
to organs. 
12.6.6.3 Through skin
Studies have demonstrated that some nanoparticles can permeate 
pig skin within 24 h of exposure. Studies analysed by the US 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) have raised concerns 
about the potential for sunscreen nanoparticles to penetrate the 
damaged skin [42–46]. 
12.6.7 Environmental Risks of Nanoparticles
The release of nanomaterials into water, air, and soil during the 
production, use, and disposal of these materials also endangers 
the environment. If these nanoparticles are antibacterial and 
discharged in sufficient amounts, they could potentially interfere 
with beneficial bacteria in sewage and wastewater treatment
plants and contaminate water intended for reuse, according to
several of the research evaluated by the US GAO. For instance, 
investigations have demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles are 
harmful to the primary body systems of rainbow trout. In a study 
conducted by the University of Toledo, researchers revealed 
that nano-titanium dioxide used in personal care products
inhibited the biological roles of bacteria after less than an hour 
of exposure. These findings suggest that these particles, which 
end up in municipal sewage treatment plants, could eradicate 
bacteria with crucial functions in ecosystems while also aiding in 
wastewater treatment. Carbon fullerenes have been reported to 
cause brain damage in largemouth bass, a species used as a model 
for defining ecotoxicological consequences by regulatory bodies. 
It has also been discovered that fullerenes are bactericidal and 
destroy water fleas. According to the Center for Biological and 
Environmental Nanotechnology at Rice University, nanoparticles Major Challenges of Using Nanomaterials for Cosmetic Applications 491 
have a propensity to bind to environmental contaminants, such as 
cadmium and petrochemicals. This property makes nanoparticles 
a potential pathway for the long-distance and extensive transfer
of contaminants in groundwater. Several studies indicate 
that nanoparticles have the potential for biomagnification. An 
interdisciplinary team of UC Santa Barbara researchers produced 
a groundbreaking discovery about the biomagnification of 
nanoparticles in a basic microbial food chain.
The use of nanoparticles in cosmetics offers both advantages 
and problems, as with any other practice. Since nanoparticles
have unique features compared to bulk materials, they may 
be able to modify biological traits. Consequently, research 
on nanoparticle toxicity is required. There is currently no 
consensus about the effect of particle size, shape, charge, particle
interactions with biological cells, and linkages with toxicity
and safety concerns. Due to their unique features, nanoparticles 
are employed in a wide variety of applications. On the other
hand, it is hypothesized that these features are the basis for 
nanoparticle-induced toxicity, which results from the complex 
interaction between nanoparticle uniqueness (e.g., size, shape, 
surface chemistry, and charge), administered dose, and host 
immunity. Changes in these qualities may influence interactions 
between nanoparticles and biomolecules, proteins, cell lines, and 
tissues. It is essential to examine the intracellular activity and 
function of nanoparticles in order to produce effective and safe 
aesthetic nanoparticles.
It has been discovered that nanoparticles are highly
reactive, resulting in the generation of a higher number of ROSs.
Nanoparticles are capable of penetrating many barriers in the 
human body and affecting multiple systems, including the blood, 
respiratory system, and skin. These reactive oxygen species
have an effect on macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and 
cell membranes. Nanoparticles may be harmful to human 
cells and tissues, leading to the death of cells. Widely utilized 
TiO2 nanoparticles have an effect on cell DNA because they 
generate ROS, which enhances the oxidative stress of fibroblast
cells. The effect of photoactivated TiO2 nanoparticles on skin 
fibroblast cells and nucleic acids. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide 
nanoparticles absorb UV radiation and generate skin-damaging 492 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
free radicals. This may lead to cellular damage and skin cancer.
In addition to their size, the chemical composition of 
nanoparticles has an effect on the human system. The lungs of 
rats injected with nanoparticles exhibited certain inflammatory 
symptoms, and lung tumors were observed as a result. 
The danger posed by nanoparticles might vary based on the 
nature of the hazard and the extent of exposure. Brain impairment 
was observed in male progeny of pregnant mice exposed to 
TiO2 nanoparticles. Traces of TiO2 have long-lasting impacts on 
the brain. When considering cosmetics, the mode of exposure, 
topical application, is incapable of causing the type of exposure
(inhalation) required to induce such harm. It was found when 
the method of application was changed to aerosols. The primary 
problem with cosmetics is that they can penetrate the skin and
enter the bloodstream. Nanoparticles can transport cosmetics’ 
active ingredients to the deeper layers of the skin. These compounds 
may cause irritation in humans. In addition to the beneficial 
impacts of nanomaterials on cells, their unfavorable consequences 
have also been explored. Aluminum oxide and iron oxide 
were evaluated for their toxicity in vitro. The ability of the free 
radicals created by aluminum oxide nanoparticles to induce 
concentration-dependent stem cell toxicity and inflammation, 
which may lead to illnesses such as atherosclerosis, was 
investigated. In addition, they compromised the blood-brain 
barrier and were directly neurotoxic to brain blood vessel cells.
The benefits of utilizing nanoparticles are frequently
illustrated. Uncertainty surrounds the risks, health risks, and 
environmental problems linked with nanoparticle exposure. When 
nanoparticles are absorbed through the skin, respiratory tract, 
brain, and other organs, they can cause harm (via blood). It has
been demonstrated that certain nanoparticles have detrimental 
effects on the brain. Current knowledge regarding the safety of 
nanoparticles is inadequate. There is a need for studies focusing 
on synthesis processes, characteristics, in vitro and in vivo safety
assessments, and dose determinations. 
Components of cosmetic products must be safe for use, 
and the items themselves must be labeled as such. The FDA is 
responsible for authorizing products for sale. Utilized cosmetics 
should be pure and effective, with no additives. In this context, Conclusions and Future Direction 493 
the FDA has issued a distinct set of safety guidelines for the use
of nanoparticles in cosmetics, titled “Guidance for Industry:
Safety of Nanomaterials in Cosmetic Products.” This document
gives an overview of the safety risks posed by the use of 
nanoparticles in cosmetics and proposes to aid interested 
companies in identifying and evaluating significant safety 
measures [69–77]. 
12.7 Conclusions and Future Direction
Nanotechnology is currently recognized as a new and promising 
field, and it is utilized and valued in sectors such as cosmetics, 
cosmeceuticals, dermatology, biomedical applications, etc. 
Cosmetics and cosmeceuticals are more popular as a result of
recent innovations and novel drug delivery techniques, which 
contribute to their growing market share. In addition, the 
incorporation of nanotechnology into cosmetics has expanded 
global acceptance. However, the toxicity linked with its 
penetrability is a serious worry that is often disregarded, resulting 
in negative health effects. Currently, innovative nanocarriers such 
as liposomes, ethosomes, cubosomes, NLC, SLNs, nanoemulsions, 
and niosomes are used to generate enhanced cosmetics and 
cosmeceuticals. Using several methods, nanosystems carry and 
administer these formulations over the skin, giving a variety of 
benefits such as UV protection, moisturization, wrinkle reduction, 
etc. Despite the fact that these nanomaterial-based products 
are gaining significant market value, there is a great dispute 
regarding their human safety and toxicity, necessitating
further investigation. Therefore, cosmetic regulation should 
offer a detailed list of references and substances that produce
unexpected environmental consequences for all users of 
cosmetic products, including consumers and professionals, to 
ensure the safety of cosmetic product use. Before these products 
are commercialized, toxicological or carcinogenicity studies 
should be conducted on cosmetics, including nanocosmetics and 
nanocosmeceuticals (and their constituents). Nanocosmeceuticals 
should be created so that they improve the health of customers.
In addition, clinical trials similar to those undertaken for 494 Nanodrug Delivery Systems for Cosmetics 
pharmaceuticals should be conducted to ensure the human 
safety of cosmeceutical formulations. Furthermore, the 
production, storage, import, and marketing of cosmeceuticals and
nanoparticles included within them should be subject to 
stringent laws. To develop standard guidelines and regulations 
for the use of nanosystems in cosmetics and to help fill in current
data gaps, researchers and global regulatory bodies must work 
together on a worldwide scale. Government agencies and non￾governmental organizations should work together to develop and 
distribute effective consumer education materials. To educate 
people on the safe use of cosmetics including nanocosmetics and 
nanocosmeceuticals, they should develop customized programs, 
including written and video materials, multimedia, and seminars. 
In conclusion, there is a need for international regulatory
harmonization in order to build a stronger regulatory framework
for safety, efficacy, and marketing, which would eventually
benefit the cosmetic industry while safeguarding consumers 
from any dangers. Additionally, customer awareness can aid in 
the improvement of the problem by enabling educated product 
selection. 
Manufacturers of cosmetics utilize nanoscale compounds
to improve UV protection, skin penetration, long-lasting effects, 
color intensity, and finish quality, among other benefits. Micellar 
nanoparticles are the new era of cosmetics being increasingly 
commercialized and attracting interest in both domestic and 
international markets. The ability of the nanoemulsion technology 
to generate small micellar nanoparticles with a large surface 
area enables the efficient delivery of bioactive components to 
the skin. Makeup removers, facial cleansers, anti-aging lotions, 
sunscreens, and other water-based cosmetic formulations all 
contain nanoemulsions of oil in water. The objective of this
review is to investigate critically the properties, advantages, 
and production mechanisms of micellar nanoparticles in 
nanoemulsion systems. Consequently, this paper presents and 
examines the special advantages of a nanoemulsion system in
the creation of micellar nanoparticles for cosmetics formulation, 
which are crucial aspects for the future development of 
micellar-based cosmetic segments.

The drugs can be absorbed both locally and systemically through 
the vaginal and rectal route, which is a possible location for 
drug administration. More control over the distribution of 
drug molecules for local and systemic actions has been made 
possibly by the development of novel rectal drug delivery, 
including hollow-type suppositories, thermo-responsive and 
mucoadhesive liquid suppositories, and nanoparticulate systems.
The use of mucoadhesive or bioadhesive polymers, pH or 
temperature-sensitive polymers, liposomes, nanoparticles, vaginal 
inserts, multiple emulsions, and hydrogels have all been developed 
to overcome the limitations of conventional dosage forms

Drug delivery is defined as the method of administering a drug to
the human body to achieve its therapeutic effect. There are two
types of drug delivery systems, conventional/traditional and 
novel drug delivery systems (NDDS). Researchers invented NDDS 
to reduce undesired effects and maximize therapeutic benefits
by maintaining the concentration of a drug in the therapeutic 
window. Novel drug delivery systems are defined as a new 
approach that combines innovative development, formulations, 
new technologies, and new methodologies for delivering
pharmaceutical compounds into the body as needed to safely 
achieve their desired therapeutic effects. It may include scientific
site targeting within the body, improving drug potency, and 
controlled drug release with prolonged therapeutic effect. It
involved the development of a novel, better and safer drug with 
a long half-life and therapeutic indices.
The most practical way to administer medication is orally. 
However, there are situations when this isn’t possible from a 
clinical or pharmaceutical standpoint. In these situations, the
rectal or vaginal route may be a viable alternative, as it can be 
utilized to deliver medications with both local and systemic
effects. The rectal and vaginal routes were utilized to deliver 
medications with both systemic and local effects on the human 
body.
The research on NDDS has been under way for a long time, 
but it has intensified in the past couple of years. The development
of several types of NDDS in the past few decades includes 
microparticles, nanoparticles, niosomes, and liposomes with the 
motive of delivering drugs to the targeted tissue to cure certain 
diseases. Introduction 509 
Contraceptive suppositories made of crocodile excrement,
honey, and sodium carbonate were one of the most intriguing 
compositions mentioned in ancient writings. Another historic 
source for vaginal prescription is the Papyrus Ebers (approximately 
1550 BC), explaining acacia tips and honey-soaked lint￾based contraceptive tampons. Gum arabic was traditionally
obtained from the acacia bush. After a tampon was inserted, the 
gum generated lactic acid, acidifying the vagina [1–3]. Lactic acid 
is now a widely used and well-known spermicidal ingredient
in contemporary contraceptive creams as well as gels [4, 5]. It is 
important to note that by the 15th century, drugs that can infiltrate 
the systemic circulation after being administered vaginally had 
been already discovered. The vaginal use of arsenic or other toxic 
drugs to cause suicide or abortion was a frequent, if heinous,
practice [6].
The vaginal canal serves a variety of activities, including 
sexual functions, but it also plays a role in active immunologic and 
anatomically mediated processes that are critical for maintaining 
a microenvironment that is appropriate for “normal” bacteria 
[7, 8]. Many studies have shown that the vaginal environment 
contains various immune-related cells and receptors that aid 
the microbial environment. Community state types (CSTs) refer
to the five major forms of vaginal microbes. The predominant 
species throughout four of them is Lactobacillus spp. (CST-I, -II, 
-III, -V); CST-IV, on the other hand, is made up of a combination 
of facultative anaerobes such as Gardnerella, Autopodium, and 
Prevotella. Depending on the ethnic background, the incidence of 
various CSTs varies. 
The quantity of blood arteries in the vaginal region is a distinct 
advantage, particularly when it comes to systemic formulations. 
There are various advantages to vaginal administration over 
oral administration. These include dose decrease, less frequent 
dosing, fewer adverse effects, and no hepatic first-pass impact. 
However, several obstacles must be overcome, such as peristaltic 
movement of the vaginal wall or dilution of the vaginal fluid [9–16].
The most prevalent vaginal abnormalities include mucoid 
ectopy, aerobic vaginitis, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, cervicitis 
atrophic vaginitis, and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. The 
most common vaginal infection in women between the ages of 510 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
15 and 44 is bacterial vaginosis (BV), according to statistics
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2004, 
the frequency of BV in women in the United States was 
estimated to be around 21.2 million in the United States [17–20].
The second most common vaginal infection is candidiasis. 
Vulvar or vaginal malignancies are examples of other vaginal 
disorders. They are generally regarded as being rare; in 2017,
vaginal cancer was diagnosed in 0.7 of every 100,000 women, 
and 2.6 per 100,000 women were diagnosed with vulvar 
cancer. The fact that the circumstances in the vaginal canal are 
extremely unstable must be taken into account while designing 
a vaginal formulation. Sexual activity, menstrual cycle, comorbid
conditions, and patient age all have significant effects on acidity, 
vaginal fluid flow, and epithelial thickness [21–24].
Various types of natural or synthetic polymers are used 
in most vaginal medication delivery methods. Their primary 
responsibility is to ensure that the drug remains in contact at 
the site of action for as long as feasible, as well as to deliver a 
controlled drug release on a consistent and predictable basis. 
A wide range of vaginal medication delivery devices are now in 
use or being researched. Examples of these include patches,
films, rings, suppositories, tablets, capsules, gels, creams, foams, 
pellets, microparticles, and nanoparticles. According to certain 
research changes in the normal composition and functions of
vaginal flora are involved in the development of numerous 
vaginal disorders. Currently, vaginal formulations are used to 
administer drugs with a localized action, including antibiotics 
[25–29], spermicides [30, 31], and antimycotics [32], as well 
as to introduce pharmaceuticals into the systemic circulation 
[33–35], primarily for hormone therapy or contraception
[36, 37]. Microbicides delivered vaginally to prevent HIV [38, 39],
human papillomavirus (HPV) [40–42], or herpes simplex
virus (HSV) [43–45] transmission are also attracting a lot of 
attention. Every year, more than 10 million people are affected
by disorders of the female reproductive tract (FRT). Itching,
burning, soreness, irregular bleeding, discharge, discomfort, and 
dyspareunia are common non-specific symptoms, and they cause 
significant distress in patients. Most of the above, however, have Introduction 511 
been linked to vaginal dermatoses, and allergic and irritating 
reactions. 
Clinically, the rectal route is already being used to deliver
several medicines for both local and systemic disorders. 
Constipation, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, inflammation, and 
hyperkalemia can all be treated locally. Pain, fever, nausea and 
vomiting, migraines, allergies, and drowsiness are all treated 
with rectal formulations for systemic medication distribution 
[46]. These rectal formulations are primarily used for short￾term therapy and are based on traditional dosage forms like 
suppositories and enemas. Rectal dose forms can be produced 
at a lower cost than parenteral dosage forms and can be 
delivered by patients themselves without the assistance of a 
medical professional (e.g., intramuscular and intravenous 
injections). This is especially beneficial for rural populations and 
poor countries when it comes to certain pharmaceuticals that 
cannot be provided through other means. Patients, on the 
other hand, do not like the rectal route of administration due to 
cultural concerns and/or the risk of discomfort and leaking [47].
Standard treatment options are extensive and primarily
consist of systemically injected antimicrobial medicines, while 
topical therapies may also be provided. Women who received 
intravaginal antimicrobial drugs were happier with their 
treatment than those who received oral antimicrobial agents in 
some clinical trials comparing oral and topical antimicrobial 
medicines [48, 49]. In addition, gastrointestinal problems and
candida infection are caused by various oral antimicrobial 
medications. Furthermore, poor oral therapy adherence might 
lead to treatment failure, which can lead to recurrence or drug 
resistance. Intravaginal therapies, on the other hand, have several 
benefits, including the ability to bypass first metabolism, the 
convenience of administration, and fewer adverse effects. Studies 
have revealed that the vaginal route for drug administration 
is underutilized, and as a result, major attempts have been
undertaken to improve this potential delivery method [50, 51]
for both local and systemic effects. In fact, in recent years,
researchers have looked into systemic vaginal absorption of a 
variety of therapeutic compounds (proteins, small interfering  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
512 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
RNAs, peptides, vaccines, oligonucleotides, antigens, and hormones) 
[52].
To date, a variety of topical dosage forms for vaginal drug 
delivery have been proposed, including lotions, aerosols, gels, 
creams, suppositories, ovules, and tablets, but their effectiveness
is severely limited by poor permeability across the vaginal wall
and rapid removal from the vaginal canal, which is further 
influenced by the presence of hormones. As a result, to compensate 
for the quick removal of the drug carrier, numerous and 
frequent local doses are required, resulting in an increase in 
drug side effects and a decrease in patient compliance. For these 
reasons, vaginal medication administration remains a difficulty,
and the development of innovative effective local treatments
that can remain in place and release active agents for an extended 
length of time is gaining traction [53–84].
The goal of this chapter is to provide the physiological 
and pharmacological factors that influence vaginal and rectal
medication distribution, as well as a thorough examination of 
current advancements in vaginal and rectal medication delivery 
systems, identifying the most widely researched study areas, 
as well as assessing future trends and potential obstacles in 
rectal and vaginal medication delivery research. 
13.2 Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations
To have a localized impact or reach the systemic circulation when
given a drug intravaginally, it must get past physiological and
anatomical barriers. The drug form must also possess unique
properties. For instance, it is necessary to adopt appropriate
drug release parameters, have a longer transit time at the site
of action, and guarantee mucosal adherence. Mucoadhesive 
preparations depending on the appropriate polymers are 
particularly intriguing and appear to have the most potential
for vaginal medicine administration. This category includes both
the pharmaceutical forms, such as tablets, creams, suppositories,
and films, and also the new therapeutics forms, such as rings,
nanoparticles, and films [85]. Classification of the vaginal dose 
forms is depicted in Fig. 13.1. Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 513 
Figure 13.1 Classification of the vaginal dose forms. 
13.2.1 Semisolid Formulations 
Gels, creams, and ointments are semisolid formulations for 
vaginal usage [86, 87]. These systems have several advantages, 
including high acceptability, ease of usage, and reasonable 
production costs. Semisolid systems, on the other hand, are seen 
as troublesome due to the leakage, discomfort following
application, messiness, and a short post-administration residence 
period, all of which could cause a lower efficacy. In order to
boost the clinical effect experienced with vaginal semisolid 
products, frequent administration is occasionally required,
which may be regarded as inconvenient [87, 89]. Another method  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
514 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
involves using mucoadhesive polymers to improve interactions 
with the mucosal membrane and lengthen the time spent
in the vaginal canal. According to certain studies, using eco￾friendly polymers to increase the formulation viscosity after 
administration is a viable option. When the product comes 
into touch with vaginal conditions, it transforms from liquid to 
semisolid. Acceptability by patients is a significant factor in the 
administration and effectiveness of vaginal products. Patients
prefer semisolid dosage forms over vaginal rings and vaginal 
suppositories because they are more convenient to apply [88, 90].
It is worth noting, however, that patient acceptability is a 
complicated topic that can be influenced by a variety of cultural, 
social, and other factors [91]. One of the areas of vaginal drug 
administration that have recently received the most attention
is the development of devices with antiviral agents put into 
them as prospective HIV and sexually transmitted diseases 
(STD) preventive drugs. Dosing frequency was found to be the 
most important element influencing patients’ preferences and 
choices in these goods [92]. Semisolids’ limited retention time is
mentioned as the major disadvantage in this regard [93]. 
13.2.1.1 Gels
Although gels are used in many scientific and non-scientific
fields, it can be challenging to define a gel and other approaches
to explain these systems exist as well. Gels are defined by Almdal
et al. [94] as “solid, solid-like, soft materials comprised of two
or more elements.” One of the elements is liquid, and it is much 
more plentiful than the other one. Gels have unusual rheological 
features. It is also important to note that this definition excludes 
heterogeneous materials.
According to Rogovina et al. [94], a flexible solid made up
of two or more components is known as a gel. The other is a
three-dimensional network, while the first is a liquid. The type
of gel depends on the kind of bonds that are present in the
network. Strong covalent connections hold chemical gels together,
whereas hydrogen bonds hold physical gels together. Low 
molecular weight gelators can also be utilized as the network￾forming component [95, 96]. Hydrogels are water-based liquid
components, while organogels are non-aqueous liquid components.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 515 
The majority of vaginal medicine administration gels are weak
physical hydrogels created utilizing gelling agents derived from 
polymers.
The majority of the gel-based dosage forms under 
investigation are used to administer antimicrobial drugs to treat
vaginal illnesses such as fungal [97, 98] and bacterial [99, 100] 
infections. On the other hand, a lot of research is focused on how 
to distribute contraceptive medications effectively and how to 
prevent HIV transmission [101]. Clinical trials on the efficacy and 
safety of several gel formulations, notably containing tenofovir
and dapivirine, have been performed [102]. Mucoadhesive and 
thermosensitive systems should be highlighted when looking 
at the areas of pharmaceutical technology and drug carrier 
optimization that have received the greatest attention. 
13.2.1.2 Mucoadhesive drug delivery systems
Mucoadhesion is caused by interactions between formulation 
components and the mucus layer that lines the surface of the 
vaginal mucous membrane. Hydrophilic glycoproteins having 
a high glycosylation level are the most important components 
of mucus. Mucin subunits are joined by disulfide bridges to 
create massive three-dimensional gel forms [103]. Electrostatic 
interactions, hydrogen bonds, or van der Waals interactions are 
the most common way that mucoadhesive composition elements 
engage with mucin. As a result, the presence of a large variety of 
functional groups, such as carboxyl or hydroxyl, amine groups, and 
sulfate, is the most crucial property of mucoadhesive polymers. 
Additional qualities include the presence of negative and positive 
charges in the molecules, attractive surface properties that allow 
the formulation to be applied to the mucous membrane, and chain 
flexibility that allows the interpenetration of the polymer and
mucin lattices [104].
Chitosan, a cationic linear polysaccharide produced from chitin 
deacetylation and recognized for antibacterial [105] and wound￾healing characteristics, is one of the most widely used bioadhesive 
polymers. Two kinds of chitosan with different molecular 
weights were investigated by Bonferoni et al. [106] as carriers for 
mucoadhesive gels intended to release lactic acid under regulated 
conditions. Given the variations in the release of active elements 516 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
in various mediums, it was hypothesized that lactic acid was 
released as a result of diffusion and ionic displacement.
Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and acyclovir were employed as 
active components. The utilized chitosan derivatives’ ability to
inhibit proteolytic enzymes, including carboxypeptidase A and 
leucine amino-peptidase, was investigated. It is believed that 
inhibiting these enzymes will increase the transport of hydrophilic 
and macromolecular materials across the mucosal membrane. 
Despite having good penetration results in comparison to controls, 
there were no statistically significant differences when compared 
to chitosan hydrochloride. Senyiit et al. [107] used miconazole
and econazole nitrates to examine chitosan-based gels. In this
study, the effects of polymer molecular weight in the release 
of active compounds, vaginal preservation, and mucoadhesive
qualities were examined. All of the formulations in the study were
also tested for antibacterial characteristics. It was found that the 
formulation with the best vaginal medicine distribution properties 
was one built with a medium molecular weight polymer.
Comparative research on several polymer creams designed 
for the complete administration of the antimuscarinic medication 
oxybutynin, which is used to treat an overactive bladder, was 
carried out by Demiröz et al. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 
(hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose [HPMC] K100M), poloxamer
407, and chitosan were used as thickening agents. The highest 
cohesion and mucoadhesion were seen in the HPMC K100M 
condition. Furthermore, all semisolid formulations were evaluated 
in vivo against a tablet that is typically sold. The gel made of
HPMC was found to be a useful alternative to the oral formulation. 
Using covalent thioglycolic acid and cysteine treatments, 
Cevher et al. [109] looked at chitosan and polycarbophil hydrogels. 
The product served as carriers for clomiphene citrate, a drug 
that may be used to treat infection with human papillomavirus 
(HPV). Polycarbophil and its thiol derivatives were shown 
to extend drug release up to 72 h, whereas chitosan and its
derivatives only lasted 12 h, which was less than ideal for the
study’s goal. Furthermore, it was found that both the type of 
polymer and the quantity of conjugating agent utilized had 
a significant impact on the mechanical characteristics of the 
suggested systems.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 517 
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is another often-used 
mucoadhesive polymer (HPMC). Bilensoy et al. [110] synthesized 
hydrogels with both Carbopol 934 and HPMC as a bioadhesive
agent and thermosensitive poloxamer 407 as a thermosensitive 
polymer. Clotrimazole, a water-insoluble antifungal drug, was 
used as the active ingredient. Clotrimazole’s solubility was improved 
using an inclusion complex with cyclodextrin. Clotrimazole 
complexation was proven to prolong the drug’s release from 
hydrogels. Additionally, it was noted that Carbopol-based gels 
were incompatible because of precipitation. It is a positive
breakthrough for vaginal drug administration that gels prepared 
from HPMC were stable and delivered the active component for a 
considerable amount of time. 
A study by Aka-Any-Grah et al. concentrated on developing
vaginal hydrogels that could tolerate being diluted with vaginal
secretions and were both thermosensitive and mucoadhesive. 
As thermosensitive components, Pluronic®F127 was used in the 
formulations under research, or Pluronic®F127 and F68 together. 
HPMC, a mucoadhesive agent, was utilized. According to the 
outcomes of an ex vivo animal model, the dilution had no impact 
on the mucoadhesive properties of hydrogels created using a 
mixture of Pluronic’s. However, even after dilution, both gels
maintained a gelling temperature of around 30–35°C [111–113]. 
13.2.1.3 Thermosensitive dosage forms
Thermosensitive gels are more accurately referred to as 
stimuli-responsive systems because they thicken in response
to physiological conditions. The stimuli-responsive system used 
in vaginal medicine administration that has received the 
most research persists as liquid at ambient temperature and 
transmutes into gels at body temperature. These therapies
benefit from easy vaginal administration and effective interaction 
with the creases and gaps of the vaginal mucous membrane.
Thermogelation produces a more viscous medium that 
prolongs the active component release while also enhancing 
retention at the administration site. The most often utilized 
poloxamer, poloxamer 407, is one of the most regularly used 
thermosensitive polymers. Typically, it is seen as helpful as an 518 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
excipient in dosage forms intended for use with various routes of 
administration because it is non-toxic. It also exhibits beneficial 
thermosensitive characteristics that allow the construction of 
liquid systems that solidify into gels at physiological temperatures.
The formulation used as a result is therefore more resistant 
to the vaginal clearance mechanisms. It is worth noting that
the temperature of gelation and the properties of the gel are 
influenced by the system’s composition. Poloxamer-based 
methods for vaginal drug delivery have substantial drawbacks 
due to their poor mucoadhesive characteristics. Additional 
bioadhesive excipients are used to extend the medication’s stay 
at the administration site. Liu et al. looked at the effect of adding 
carrageenan to an in situ vaginal gel based on poloxamer 407.
The study’s goal was to develop a sustained-release formulation 
for the delivery of acyclovir, a common antiviral drug used as a 
genital herpes treatment. Due to its effectiveness in preventing 
HIV infections, carrageenan was recognized as a good excipient 
for the vaginal medication delivery system. The addition of 
the macromolecular component had no effect on the gelation 
temperature, according to rheological experiments. Carrageenan 
was found to slow down the in vitro release of acyclovir, which was 
also linked to a slower rate of poloxamer 407 breakdown and gel 
erosion. The concentration of carrageenan had an impact on the 
effect that was seen [114–120].
A mouse model was used to explore the residence time 
in vivo. Compared to a standard poloxamer-based gel, the 
carrageenan-enhanced system had a much longer residence 
period in the trials.
Rossi et al. investigated systems of chitosan lactate and 
poloxamer 407 as well as mixes of glycerophosphate and chitosan 
lactate. Amoxicillin trihydrate was introduced into the systems 
under investigation. The objective of the study was to develop 
thermosensitive vehicles for vaginal mucositis that gelled at 
physiological temperatures. It was discovered that additional 
macromolecules could bring the poloxamer gelation temperature 
up to a physiological level [121–123].
The length of the gelation of the poloxamer/chitosan lactate 
combination was prolonged after being diluted with simulated Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 519 
vaginal fluid. There was no such impact detected in the chitosan 
derivatives mixture. However, compared to the poloxamer-based 
system, the latter had worse elastic characteristics and improved 
bioadhesion. For vaginal administration, Zhou et al. examined 
thermosensitive in situ creating hydrogel with baicalein. The active 
component was combined with hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin to 
form an inclusion complex. Benzalkonium chloride, hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), sodium alginate, poloxamer 188, and 
poloxamer 407 were used to make the hydrogel vehicle.
The generated formulation gelled at a temperature appropriate 
for in situ vaginal gel, and medication release followed the 
Peppas equation, indicating an erosion-based process. In an in 
vivo study using an animal model, the evaluated systems also 
showed adequate efficacy. Another study by Deshkarand Palve 
[114] described the in situ creation of a thermosensitive gel 
with an integrated cyclodextrin complex based on poloxamer
[123–125].
Voriconazole, an antifungal drug with poor water solubility, 
was used in the study as the active ingredient. Spray drying was 
used to obtain the drug and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin 
inclusion complex in the first phase. Following that, an in situ
gelling formulation was created using poloxamers 407 and 188,
as well as numerous other polymers as mucoadhesive agents. 
The ideal gelation temperature for vaginal compositions is 
between 30° and 35° Celsius. Poloxamer 188 was added to boost 
gelation temperature, whereas mucoadhesive agents have had 
the reverse effect. 
Hypromellose, a mucoadhesive polymer, was present in 
the formulation with the most favorable properties for vaginal 
medication delivery 0.4% of it. The modified product displayed 
good bioadhesive properties and a gelation temperature of 31.7 
± 0.1 °C. Additionally, it was discovered that using an inclusion 
complex-based gel rather than a conventional one allowed for
better voriconazole uptake by tissues in in vivo tests. 
Rençber et al. conducted a similar investigation for generating 
clotrimazole-loaded gels, a common antifungal drug used to treat 
vaginal candidiasis. At roughly 34°C, the modified poloxamer 407, 
poloxamer 188, and Hypromellose mixture began to turn into gel. 
The examined system also showed appropriate mucoadhesive 520 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
characteristics and persisted at the administration site for 24 h 
[126–130]. 
13.2.2 Suppositories, Tablets, and Pessaries
For many years, traditional solid vaginal dose forms, such as 
globules or suppositories, have been widely used. Unfortunately, 
they have a number of flaws, including a proclivity for discomfort 
and difficult application. Due to inadequate retention of the
active medicinal ingredients caused by vaginal self-cleansing or 
leakages, the patient may need to apply multiple dosages each 
day. All of the aforementioned drawbacks cause patients a great 
deal of inconvenience, which can lead to low adherence and a lack 
of therapeutic benefit.
As a result, technicians are finding it difficult to modify old 
formulations. The development of current vaginal tablets is
based on the phenomena of mucoadhesion. Years of study have 
led to the development of mini-tablets, tablets, pessaries, and 
other formulations with extended vaginal residence, sustained
API release, acceptable efficacy, and patient convenience due to 
the use of natural and synthetic polymers with high mucoadhesive 
qualities.
These compositions are used mostly to treat skin 
infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and PrEP (pre￾exposure prophylaxis of sexual transmission of HIV) as well as
inflammations, atrophic vaginitis, and dry vagina. Medications
for cancer therapy and probiotics have both been delivered via 
vaginal tablets. It is crucial to remember that the recommended 
drugs need to sustain a long vaginal retention time in order to 
be very effective.
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) emerged as the most 
popular and effective polymer among all those examined. The 
sustained-release polymer (HPMC), a single excipient used in
tablet production, has been shown by McConville et al. to deliver 
efficient doses of the HIV microbiocide tenofovir for up to 24 h.
Perioli et al. created HPMC tablets that had good hydration 
properties by producing a homogenous, gelled phase as well as, 
most importantly, prolonged benzydamine release. Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 521 
Carbopol inclusion in the formulation led to the creation of a 
spongy, stiff substance that was unable to guarantee the drug’s 
linear release while having outstanding mucoadhesive capabilities.
Other authors offer proof to back up the advantages of using
HPMC in a polymer mix. After analyzing mixes of chitosan, HPMC,
Eudragit RS, and guar gum, Notario-Pérez et al. believe that the 
joint properties of HPMC and chitosan are the most advantageous. 
Tenofovir was released from the resultant pills for 72 h, and 
they stayed attached to the vaginal mucosa for 96 h, indicating 
that they could be used to enhance HIV prophylaxis in women
in underdeveloped countries [131–135].
Cevher et al. presented a very original solution. Itraconazole’s 
solubility and antifungal activity were improved by the introduction 
of cyclodextrin-inclusive complexes but its toxicity increased, 
leading to a prolonged drug residence and effectiveness. Contrarily, 
when combined with Carbopol®934P, the use of HPMC, xanthan 
gum mucoadhesive polymers lengthened the formulation residence 
duration. Additionally, HPMC may be utilized as a mucoadhesive 
carrier for spray-dried microspheres containing clotrimazole 
and Pediococcus pentosaceus SB83, a lyophilized bacteria having 
antilisterial and pH-reducing activity [136].
In this preparation, the polymers sodium carboxymethyl￾cellulose, Carbopol, and HPMC worked together to minimize burst 
effects when the drug came into touch with bodily fluids. This 
allowed for a controlled release of the medication clotrimazole. 
Chitosan has been found in the literature to be particularly well￾suited for the creation of mucoadhesive vaginal tablets. A porcine 
mucin gel, vaginal mucosa, and mucin gel were used by Szymaska 
et al. to examine the efficacy of clotrimazole tablets produced
with varying concentrations of chitosan in three distinct scenarios.
The outcomes indicated that chitosan possesses bioadhesive 
characteristics. Due to their stable, prolonged release of clotrimazole 
and prolonged stay on the vaginal tissue, formulations comprising 
25% and 40% chitosan were selected as the finest applicants 
for further study. Chitosan’s behavior could potentially change 
in various ways. In formulations including thiolated poly(acrylic
acid)-cysteine and the nitrated of econazole and miconazole,
Baloðlu et al. advised their use [137]. 522 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
Synthetic polymer-containing tablets were mucoadhesive 
and had a high water uptake ratio. It is crucial to keep in mind
that thiolating the polymer and guarding the thiol groups from 
oxidation with an aromatic ligand produced S-protected chitosan. 
In this case, a carbodiimide-mediated amide bond was used to 
link NAC-6-MNA to chitosan. Better mucoadhesive properties, 
a longer duration for metronidazole, an antiprotozoal and 
antibacterial medication, to be released from vaginal tablets, and 
improved antimicrobial activity were all benefits of S-protected 
chitosan [138].
In the future, pectins might be used in vaginal medication 
delivery systems. A Carbopol 934 and pectin (2:1) mixture,
according to Baloðlu et al., could be utilized as a moisturizer
in the dry vagina as well as a carrier for topical active 
medications. This mixture has the maximum swelling volume and
mucoadhesive strength. It additionally demonstrated the least
level of pH reduction. When treating vaginal infections, acid￾buffering bioadhesive tablets must be used because vaginal pH
is a factor to be taken into account. Mixed vaginal infections can
have a pH rise as a symptom or as a cause.
To maintain pH at 4.4, a sign of a healthy vagina, tablets 
with sodium monocitrate are used as a buffer. Furthermore, 
genitourinary infections can be successfully treated with drugs
like metronidazole and clotrimazole as well as Lactobacillus 
acidophilus spores. A healthy vagina contains L. acidophilus, which 
is in charge of the pH acidity. For this active agent combination, 
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and polycarbophil displayed the 
optimal behavior [139].
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a perfect choice for vaginal drug 
delivery due to its occurrence in the human body and biological 
functions. Its structure can be tweaked to achieve even greater 
results. Using 6-mercaptonicotinamide, Nowak et al. thiolated
and preactivated it, increasing its mucoadhesive characteristics
and stability [140].
This solution makes use of the mucoadhesion provided by 
the creation of disulfide bonds between thiol groups while also 
keeping the material stable. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated 
that HA can operate as a therapeutic agent rather than just a drug 
carrier. Hyaluronic acid vaginal pills of 5 mg were contrasted with Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 523 
vaginal tablets of 25 mg estradiol. Both groups were successful
in treating atrophic vaginitis. Although estradiol is now favored,
HA may be helpful in those for whom hormonal management is 
either undesirable or contraindicated [141].
Mini-tablets have received a lot of attention recently. This 
dose type is said to be a better version of traditional tablets. Hiorth 
et al. investigation of various polymers led to the invention of mini￾tablets that concentrate on the vaginal route of administration. 
The study’s objective was to determine the most efficient way
to distribute hexyl amino levulinate (HAL), a potential topical 
treatment for cervical cancer that uses photodynamic therapy.
This is important because vaginal delivery systems need to 
consider how a hormone level, a woman’s age, and/or sexual
activity might affect a range of properties, including pH and 
viscosity. The mechanical characteristics, bioadhesive strength, and 
drug release independent of vaginal pH of hydroxypropyl methyl￾cellulose (HPMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) 
were sufficient. Without any mucoadhesive characteristics, 
microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose, and hydroxyethyl
cellulose were able to release complete medication dosages in a 
matter of minutes. 
Utilizing multiparticulate medication delivery strategies,
1–3 mm mini-tablets, medication diffuses more widely inside
the vagina, dissolves more quickly, and is retained for longer. 
Even a few mini-tablets lost have less of an effect than with 
conventional forms. Mini-tablets are simple to use, painless,
and evenly spread because they can be placed into capsules or
applicators. These benefits may aid in patient compliance and
the maintenance of a strong therapeutic result.
McConville et al. offered a straightforward yet original and 
practical solution to the issue of versatile preventive tools by 
creating many-sided pills to aid in the prevention of pregnancy 
and sexually transmitted disease. The best medication release 
patterns and in vivo action were achieved by using Kollidon®SR 
and Kollidon®VA. The trial used the anti-herpes simplex drug 
acyclovir, the anti-retroviral drug dapivirine, and the hormone 
levonorgestrel as a method of birth control. The authors 
developed tablets with three to four layers that offered an API 
release that was quick or steady.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
524 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
The highly encouraging results suggest that multifunctional, 
multi-layered tablets might be brought into the pharmaceutical 
industry. FOR instance, prepared tablets delivered an immediate 
surge of active chemicals together with a continual release of 
dapivirine, which has dual usage as an antiviral and contraceptive. 
By using these formulations, it may be possible to decrease the 
number of given forms while also improving patient comfort, 
which would boost therapy compliance and results. The described 
multifunctional dose formulations could be particularly beneficial
in poor nations in terms of reducing HIV infections and the high 
birth rate. 
Osmotic pump pills (OPTs) are frequently considered in oral 
medicine delivery systems, although Rastogi et al. claim that they 
can also be administered vaginally [142]. In order to wrap vaginal 
tablets of the potential antiviral drug IQP-0528 with a bioadhesive 
polymer (cellulose acetate or cellulose acetate phthalate) and a 
typical mechanism involving liquid consumption and drug release 
through an orifice, the researchers used this method.
The study’s findings showed that it is possible to make tablets 
that transport active substances to the vaginal area for 2–5 days. 
Additionally, osmotic pump pills might have a drug that releases
in a burst that is pH-dependent. Utilizing this -phenomena, a 
formulation for HIV prevention that adjusts the pH as sperm 
enter the vaginal canal can be created, activating the formulation. 
As a result, opts may help patients adhere to and use PrEP more 
effectively. Despite their lack of popularity, pessaries may be
equally effective as other vaginal dosing forms.
With the help of bioadhesive polymers like polycarbophil,
HPMC, and sodium salt of hyaluronic acid, Semi-synthetic solid
triglyceride pessaries were created by Ceschel et al. to keep
preparations in the vaginal canal for several days without causing
any harm. Clotrimazole [143–145], which is used to treat typical
mycotic infections, is a good example of an imidazole antimycotic
chemical that can be transported by the specified pessaries. 
13.2.3 Vaginal Rings
NuvaRing® (Merck and Co., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), Progering® 
(Laboratorios Andrómaco SA, Pealolén, Chile), Annovera®  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 525 
(Therapeutics MDInc, Boca Raton, FL, USA), Ornibel®/Ginoring® 
(Exeltis, Madrid, Spain), and EluRyngTM (Merck and Co., 
Kenilworth, NJ, USA) are some of (Amneal Pharmaceuticals, 
Bridgewater, NJ, USA) Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers 
make up NuvaRing®. It has a diameter of 54 mm and a thickness 
of 4 mm. 
Every day, it generates 0.012 mg of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg 
of ethinyl oestradiol. It is applied three times during the course 
of a one-week period. Contrarily, Progering® was manufactured 
of silicone elastomer. For three months, IT offers 10 mg of
progesterone every day. Formulations that combine antiviral 
and contraceptive activity are the topic of some clinical research 
studies. Their goal is to improve contraceptive effectiveness and 
reduce HIV transmission through sexual contact.
Thurman et al. performed research to contrast the benefits 
of vaginal rings and oral contraceptives. It was discovered that 
topical drug distribution through the vaginal ring enables the
administration of lower drug doses without causing a first-pass
effect on the liver. 
Vaginal rings also lessen pain and lengthen menstruation,
which is another advantage. Additionally, they are comfortable
and in control when applying their own ideas. These rings should
not be sensed during normal activities and have no effect on 
sexual behavior. They can, however, induce vaginal bleeding and
irritation [146]. 
13.2.4 Microspheres
Over 20 years ago, polymeric microspheres were investigated as
a vaginal drug delivery system. Hyaluronic acid esters were used to 
make microspheres by Rochina and colleagues to transport salmon 
calcitonin. For formulation, they employed the solvent extraction 
approach. They were able to make smooth-surfaced, spherical 
microspheres with a diameter of about 10 m. The extraction 
of the peptide from the microspheres produced between 80% 
and 90% of the peptide, indicating good incorporation efficacy. 
In vivo measurement of the isolated peptide revealed that the 
microsphere manufacturing process had no impact on the 
biological activity of calcitonin. Another study that investigated 526 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
the potential for repairing the vaginal environment with 
microparticles comprising probiotics and prebiotics also used 
the polymer hyaluronic acid.
The findings of a study on the design of a new vaginal bio￾adhesive delivery system for probiotics and prebiotic encapsulated 
on the basis of pectinate-hyaluronic acid microparticles were 
given by Pliszczak et al. in 2011. The emulsification/gelation 
process was used to create microparticles, with calcium ions
serving as the cross-linking agent. First, it was determined how 
important preparation and processing limitations affected the 
size distribution of unloaded microparticles. The bioadhesive 
characteristics of the gels used to make the final microparticles 
were also investigated using rheological studies. The ideal 
operational conditions for creating bio-sticky microparticles 
with probiotics and prebiotics were then determined using an 
experimental design.
The use of encapsulation technology may improve the effects 
of Lactobacillus species while safeguarding them during drying 
and storage. The final microparticles, with a mean diameter of
137 m, granted the full release of probiotic strains after 16 h 
in a simulated vaginal fluid at 37°C. To avoid problems with
oral delivery, Maestrelli et al. [136] developed chitosan-alginate 
microspheres for cefixime vaginal administration. They used 
calcium chloride as the cross-linkage agent and ionotropic
gelation to generate microparticles. When the drug-to-polymer 
ratio was optimized, entrapment efficacy grew with drug loading 
concentration in the beginning solution and peaked at 30 mg/ml.
It is interesting to note that water uptake peaked at the 
same 30 mg/mi drug loading concentration while microsphere
swelling properties grew as more drug dose was entrapped in 
them. As indicated by the relationship between water uptake
and medication release rate, the ideal formulation of microspheres 
is synthesized with 30 mg/ml cefixime. All formulations ensured 
in situ persistence for more than 2 h, according to mucoadhesion 
testing. Through microbiological research, it was discovered that 
the rate of cefixime discharge from microspheres and the fall in 
Escherichia coli viability were related. Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 527 
They came to the conclusion that the microspheres
formulation tested could be used to treat urogenital infections 
locally. Spray drying is an additional technique for producing 
microspheres that has been used by numerous groups and for 
a variety of polymers. Zhang et al. studied pH-sensitive and 
spray-dried mucoadhesive microspheres [147], and tenofovir 
was administered via polymethacrylate salt (a model HIV 
microbicide). Using the methacrylic copolymers Eudragit®L-100 
and S-100 could result in a unique, low-swellable mucoadhesive 
substance. 
The enhanced formulation contains a 2.3% (w/w) drug 
loading and an average size of 4.73 m. These microspheres 
have been demonstrated to respond swiftly to pH changes, 
releasing over 90% of the medication within 60 min. These 
microspheres significantly outperform the 1% HEC gel formulation 
in terms of mucoadhesion. These microspheres do not harm 
vaginal or endocervical epithelial cells, according to the results of 
this investigation, which also demonstrate that they do not induce 
an immune response.
There is no evidence of cytotoxicity in normal vaginal flora. 
In addition, methacrylic acid copolymers were used for the micro￾sphere synthesis by Gupta et al. Their research objective was to 
produce and assess vaginal pills that included microspheres of 
clotrimazole. 
Mucoadhesive polymers such as sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose, Carbopol®934, and hydroxypropyl cellulose were 
utilized as excipients in the tablets formulation to generate a long￾lasting therapeutic action at the site of infection. The spray 
drying techniques Eudragit RS-100 and Eudragit RL-100 were 
used to create these clotrimazole microspheres. According to 
the findings, the created vaginal formulations have a regulated 
medication release. Making mucoadhesive microparticles by 
spray-congealing in addition to spray drying is an innovative 
technique.
Albertini et al. studied adhesive microparticles for the vaginal 
delivery of econazole nitrate. Adhesive microparticles for the
vaginal administration of econazole nitrate were investigated by  
 
 
 
 
528 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
Albertini et al. [138] and found to be efficient. They used a lipid￾hydrophilic matrix to make microparticles that contained both 
a medication and a mucoadhesive material and were spray￾congealed. This technique, which includes atomizing a drug
dispersion in a liquid carrier, could be helpful for producing 
mucoadhesive microparticles because it does not require the use 
of solvents. 
Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, poloxamers, and chitosan 
were among the mucoadhesive polymers that were investigated 
in the hydrophilic-hydrophobic meltable matrix (Gelucire 53/10, 
Gattefosse, France). When econazole was microencapsulated in
the Gelucire 53/10, the solubility of the drug rose by 15 times. 
Albertini et al. came to the conclusion that this was due to the 
carrier’s amphiphilic structure (HLB = 10).
Upon dissolving in the fluid, the carrier produces micelles,
with the hydrophobic portion carrying the medicine and the 
hydrophilic portion carrying the medicine and the hydrophilic 
portion serving as an interface between the drug outside and the 
simulated vaginal fluid within. Poloxamers had the same effect
when added to the lipophilic carrier as when Gelucire 53/10 was 
used alone, but chitosan and sodium carboxymethylcellulose 
reduced API solubility.
This is most likely due to the interaction between polymer 
solubilization and the carrier impact on drug wettability and 
solubility enhancement [148, 149]. In addition, the micro￾particles’ mucoadhesive characteristics were studied. Importantly, 
mucoadhesive properties can prolong the antifungal agent
residence time at the vaginal mucosa tissue infection sites.
The cohesion test results were best for the particles that
included poloxamers. The researchers came to the conclusion 
that the spray-congealing process might be regarded as a novel
and solvent-free way of creating mucoadhesive microparticles 
for econazole nitrate vaginal dispersion. 
13.2.5 Pellets
Granules that range in size from 300 to 1000 microns are called 
pellets. Because of their diminutive size, they should adhere
to the vaginal mucosa surface after vaginal administration and be Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 529 
less affected by gravity than vaginal tablets. Pellets have been 
proposed as probiotic bacterium matrices or as carriers for 
active substances. Santiago et al. [150] looked at how the normal 
protective microflora of the vaginal microbiota will be impacted
by the addition of the carrier material.
They employed lyophilized lactose-based pellets with 
probiotic bacteria as well as starch-based pellets. Gelatin capsules 
containing pellets were manufactured for vaginal administration. 
A control group that was not given any medication was added
in order to monitor the pH and microbiota organic changes 
during the menstrual cycle. The vaginal and ectocervical mucosa 
did not experience any negative effects during the course of the
trial. The researchers found that lyophilized lactose/skimmed
milk and probiotic strains or other medications can be delivered 
vaginally using fast-dissolving starch pellets as a carrier substance.
Poelvoorde et al. [106] examined the vaginal characteristics 
of pellets made of either non-dissolving microcrystalline
cellulose or dissolving starch. Patients received pellets that had 
been enclosed in either hydroxypropyl methylcellulose capsules 
or hard gelatin capsules (HPMC). In vivo evaluations of pellet 
behavior (vaginal distribution and retention) and patient
tolerance (annoyance, discomfort). Capsules constructed of HPMC 
had better mucoadhesive qualities right away, but gelatin capsules 
degraded faster.
Pellets made of starch degraded considerably faster than 
pellets made of microcrystalline cellulose after being released
from capsules. Hard gelatin capsules had a faster in vitro 
disintegration rate than HPMC capsules, but they behaved similarly 
in vivo, with two out of five remaining intact 6 h after injection.
The authors discovered that gradual capsule breaking would
control the rate of drug release. If pellets were provided with 
another kind of applicator that did not require placing pellets
inside of capsules, the drawback would be eliminated.
Although the main constituent in the pellets, high-amylose 
starch, lacked mucoadhesive properties, this formulation diffused 
more freely throughout the vaginal mucosa and was better 
maintained as a result of the pellets’ disintegration. In order to 
continue this work, Mehta et al. [151] compared the effects of 
starch pellets and a cream of ceto macrogols. They sought to 530 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
show the changes in tracer substance deposition following vaginal 
administration. 
The researchers used a gamma scintigraphy technique as 
well as a magnetic resonance imaging method. The study involved 
using sheep as well as a group of volunteer humans. Pellets,
due to their quick breakdown, were proven to cover the vaginal 
epithelium to a level comparable to cream. Metha et al. carried
out an additional investigation based on the manufacturing of
fast-dissolving tablets containing pellets. They anticipated that 
because tablets disintegrate faster than capsules, pellets would 
spread more quickly within the vaginal cavity, resulting in extended 
retention. 
The researchers used gamma scintigraphy and MRI to assess
the distribution and retention pf pellets compressed into fast￾dissolving tablets in sheep and women. The dissolution of the 
tablet began within 30 min of treatment in sheep, and within 
2–4 h, the whole vagina was covered in dissolved pellets, with
a constant spread lasting up to 48 h. In females, breakdown took
4 h, while prolonged retention lasted up to 24 h [152].
The dissolving tablets containing starch-based pellets have 
a good intravaginal distribution and a long retention duration, 
making them an appealing vaginal drug delivery platform. By 
including medications from several therapeutic classes in the 
starch-based pellets, these tablets could be used as carriers for 
intravaginal administration. Hiorth et al. [153] prepared various 
trials with bioadhesive pellets based on the research stated above.
The purpose of this group’s study research was to develop 
quick-release bioadhesive pellets comprising hexyl ester 
5-aminolevulinic acid, a predecessor of the photoactive chemical, 
for vaginal medicine delivery. Unlike the previously described 
disintegrating pellet-based technique, the purpose of the up-to￾date work was to create bioadhesive pellets with a quick active 
component release. Extrusion/spheronization was employed to 
make the pellets, and Carbopol®934 was used to provide them
with bioadhesive characteristics that extend their duration in the 
vaginal system. Researchers aimed to employ the photodynamic 
approach in order to determine the utility of polymers in the 
management of cervical cancer.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 531 
The presence of 8% Carbopol has a good effect on the 
mucoadhesive qualities of pellets, according to research. They
had bioadhesive characteristics when it came to vaginal tissue.
In the in vitro dissolution test, the investigated pellets were 
mechanically stable and released the drug in phosphate buffer 
at pH = 4.0 and 6.8 within 20 min. Furthermore, the examined 
dosage formulations had a 6- to 7-week stability time. The 
proposed delivery devices were effective in delivering hexyl
ester 5-aminolevulinic acid to the vaginal cavity. 
13.2.6 Nanoparticles
Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been frequently reported as 
vaginal medication carriers, as well as for locally and systemically 
acting medications, in recent years. NPs are small, very stable 
particles with diameters less than 1000 nm [154]. They have the 
ability to encapsulate a large range of APIs and distribute them
in a skillful, long-term, and exact manner. The most prevalent
uses of NPs in vaginal drug delivery are effective microbicide 
distribution, targeted siRNA delivery, tumor management,
delivery of hydrophobic compounds, HIV prevention, protection 
or management of sexually transmitted diseases, and antibiotic 
delivery [143–146].
Natural (e.g., hyaluronic acid, chitosan) or synthetic polymers 
can be used to create such dosage forms. The majority of scientists 
are interested in synthetic chemicals such as (meth)acrylate
polymers, polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid 
(PLGA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyesters (polycaprolactone), 
and many more. Polymeric liposomes (LIPs) or cyclodextrins (CD) 
nanoparticles (NPs), Nano spheres (NS), and nano capsules (NC) 
are all examples of NPs for vaginal administration [155]. Some 
medication formulation issues, such as poor water/oil solubility, 
API degradation, toxicity, or unattractive organoleptic qualities,
can be solved with NPs. 
13.2.6.1 Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid
PLGA is the most recently described polymer in terms of NPs. Das
Neves et al. attempted to manufacture NPs from PLGA that were  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
532 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
loaded with dapivirine in order to supply an effective antiretroviral 
medication delivery. Using an emulsion-solvent evaporation
method, they found elements with a mean diameter of 170 nm.
When compared to the free medication, the formulation had an
early burst impact lasting up to 4 h, followed by a 24 h continuous 
release with lower or equivalent toxicity. 
13.2.6.2 Polyethylene glycol
PEG-neutral, hydrophilic, and mucoadhesion-minimizing polymers 
are crucial for mucus penetration, allowing NPs’ chemicals to pass 
through the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). Maisel et al. 
validated these features of PEG in their study. They demonstrated 
its anti-mucoadhesive properties ex vivo on human human 
cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) before administering PEG-coated 
NPs to a mouse’s cervicovaginal tract. They observed homogenous 
diffusion into the vaginal epithelium as a result [156].
Jraholmen et al. created PEGylated liposomes with a diameter 
of 181 nm that can enter MCV and contain interferon alpha-2b
for the local treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV). They
found no release in vitro; however, ex vivo testing demonstrated 
increased TNF-2b penetration when compared to the control
group. Because there were no mucin contacts, PEGylated liposomes 
were able to reach the deeper epithelium [157].
Lechantour et al. proposed another method for treating HPV￾induced cervical lesions. They examined the use of siRNA-loaded 
PEGylated lipoplexes for vaginal delivery. Resulting in a novel 
vaginal injection of fluorescent PEGylated lipoplexes, in vivo 
investigations in mice indicated full and persistent covering of 
the mucosal epithelium. When lipoplexes were coated with PEG, 
active siRNA was released into the cytoplasm of HPV-positive
cells, resulting in a biological response and the suppression of 
mucin protein aggregation on lipoplexes [158].
PEG is also an excellent option for administering photo￾sensitizers. Wang et al. successfully solvothermal prepared boron￾dipyrromethene (BDP)-loaded PEG-based NPs. In vitro and in 
vivo studies demonstrated that NPs improved cellular uptake and 
mucus penetration when compared to BDP-loaded polymeric 
micelles. Because of their extraordinary photothermal activity,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 533 
activating tumor apoptosis upon irradiation, high efficacy, and 
safety, the scientists concluded that NPs are a capable strategy in
the management of severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [159]. 
13.2.6.3 (Meth)acrylate polymers
Numerous (meth)acrylate polymers are also appropriate for 
nanocarriers. Frank et al. created NPs using Eudragit®RS100 
and Eudragit®S100 as a model of lipophilic material loaded 
with Nile red and integrated into chitosan gel that serves as an 
intravaginal medium. When compared to free medicines, NPs
with a diameter of roughly 200 nm had better Nile red 
penetration, particularly in the case of nano capsules
(Eudragit®RS100) [160]. 
13.2.6.4 Polyesters (polycaprolactone)
Frank et al. developed polycaprolactone (PCL) as a basic polymer 
for NPs. To treat HPV infections, the scientists used a mix of 
nanocarriers and mucoadhesive semisolids to increase adherence 
and penetration through the vaginal mucosa. Two formulations 
were developed for this purpose: chitosan-coated poly(e￾caprolactone)-nanocapsules were inserted into hydroxyethyl
cellulose gel and poly(e-caprolactone)-nanocapsules were 
introduced into chitosan hydrogel. According to their findings, 
the most promising dosage form in terms of mucoadhesion, 
drug retention, and permeability is chitosan-coated NCs in 
combination with a mucoadhesive gel [161].
Only NCs demonstrated a high level of fungus reduction 
efficiency as competed to NSs and the medication solution. In 
addition, histological research revealed substantial variations 
between tissues that were connected to the levels of inflammatory
cytokines. NC-treated mice had lower cytokine levels, but NS￾and solution-treated mice had higher cytokine levels and tissue
swelling. This indicates that PCL-NCs have a strong potential 
for improving itraconazole treatment and reducing cytotoxicity
[162]. 
13.2.6.5 Polymers of a natural origin
Natural polymers are also being studied as a foundation for 
nanocarriers. Chitosan is a well-known natural polymer. Jraholmen 534 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
et al. created chitosan-coated LIPs loaded with clotrimazole for 
local vaginal infection treatment in pregnant females to reduce 
systemic absorption. Chitosan was coated on sonicated liposomes
in three different concentrations: 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.6%. 
13.2.7 Vaginal Films
Vaginal films are solid dosage forms made largely of plasticizers 
and aqueous polymers that may or may not contain an active 
ingredient [12]. They are produced with a variety of polymers 
to achieve mucoadhesion and desired active release profiles. 
As a result, they can overcome some of the difficulties that 
come with vaginal medication administration, such as cervical 
secretion, pH, permeability, and so on. They are preferred to 
conventional semisolid preparations because of their patient￾friendly application, higher stability, improved residence time, 
and cosmetic benefits. 
They are normally flexible, soft, odorless, and colorless, and
when they come into contact with vaginal fluids, they scatter or 
dissolve, allowing them to adhere and stay in vaginal mucosa for
long periods [162]. Polyvinyl alcohol [163–169] and cellulose 
derivatives [170–172] are the most often utilized polymers for 
making vaginal films, with a combination of both [173–176] 
being the most prevalent. Other polymers have also been 
investigated [177, 178] with or without the previously listed 
typical alternatives.
After being discovered to have antiviral activity against 
the HIV and genital herpes virus [180], it was considered that
cellulose acetate phthalate was an inert medicinal component 
having film-forming capabilities. It has since been formulated
with hydroxypropyl cellulose to create a compound of microbicidal 
vaginal film while maintaining activity. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
and glycerine are the most often utilized plasticizers to obtain 
acceptable film properties, but others have been used as well.
The most popular process for creating vaginal films is 
solvent casting, which involves pouring polymers, active 
ingredients, plasticizers, and other excipients into a mold. The 
mixture is then cast into films and allowed to dry at ambient Polymer-Based Vaginal Formulations 535 
temperature or with gentle heating. The films are not immediately 
placed into single-film-sized molds.
Regev et al. created dapivirine vaginal film utilizing a quality￾by-design (QbD) approach and the hot-melt extrusion (HME) 
process [181]. HME films were discovered to be thicker, have less 
water content, heavier, and degrade more quickly than solvent 
cast SC films. HME could be useful in achieving continuous 
manufacturing and easier scalability, even if it isn’t considerably 
better than solvent casting.
The quickest drug release was observed in single-layer
films, which were immediately followed by a burst of discharge,
double-layer films, and finally NPs in films, which had to 
lowest release. This implies that, depending on the therapeutic 
requirement, several techniques can be employed to attain a 
range of drug release profiles. Another recent invention 
was a freeze-dried vaginal sheet made of a gelatine￾based gel by Machado et al. [182–190]. The vaginal sheet,
which was created using lactose as a representative powdered 
ingredient, displayed buffering capabilities when used with a 
vaginal fluid stimulant while maintaining desired organoleptic 
properties, such as texture (VFS). Garg et al. distinguish three
types of films: quick dissolving (flash release or flash dispersal) 
films, non-disintegrating films that can be used to manage
residence length when paired with fast disintegrating films,
and medium disintegrating films.
Vaginal films have been studied for a variety of purposes, the 
most popular of which is microbicidal and for vaginal diseases.
As a preventive instrument for STDs, microbicidal vaginal films 
can be used. Because of their patient-friendly administration, 
films have acquired acceptance and preference over standard 
vaginal formulations [191]. Antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal 
active substances are available as vaginal films.
Noncytotoxic contraceptive films made of sodium polystyrene 
sulfonate (PSS) were created and studied by Garg et al. 
Researchers and consumers alike are interested in multipurpose 
preventive technologies (MPTs) that act as contraceptives while 
also protecting against STDs. Nonoxyl-9 (N-9) was one of the
first multipurpose drugs to be commercialized, but the later 536 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
investigations reports showed negative results. A vaginal
multipurpose preventive film called MB66 contains monoclonal 
antibodies, which have been shown to be successful in preventing 
infections following vaginal application.
In order to provide defense against HIV 1 and HSV 1 AND 
2, Politch et al. created a film that combines two human mABs, 
VRC01 and HSV 8. In a phase 1 clinical trial, it was determined 
to be both secure and efficient. Yoo et al. demonstrate 
another use of vaginal films for treating female sexual arousal
problems through mucosal administration of nitric oxide (NO), 
S-nitroglutathione (GSNO) films from a rat model showed 
improved vaginal blood perfusion without cytotoxicity and a 
longer duration of effect for GSNO, a NO donor. Notario et al.
created smart microbicide films that are pH delicate and may
modify the drug release behavior from a constant release 
profile under normal vaginal settings (pH 4–5) to a fast release
in vaginal pH situations after ejaculation (pH 7–8) [192]. 
13.3 Novel Rectal Drug Delivery Approaches
Drug delivery via the rectum is a useful alternative route of 
administration to the oral route for patients who cannot swallow. 
Traditional rectal dosage forms have been historically used 
for localized treatments including the delivery of laxatives, 
treatment of hemorrhoids, and delivery of antipyretics. However, 
the recent trend shows an increase in the development of 
novel rectal delivery systems to deliver drugs directly into the 
systemic circulation by taking advantage of porto-systemic
shunting. Novel rectal drug delivery systems including hollow￾type suppositories, thermo-responsive and muco-adhesive liquid 
suppositories, and nanoparticulate systems incorporated into an 
appropriate vehicle have offered more control over the delivery
of drug molecules for local or systemic actions. Continuous 
research and development in this field of drug delivery may 
unleash the hidden potential of rectal drug delivery systems 
[193]. Classification of rectal novel drug delivery system shown

Figure 13.2 Rectal novel drug delivery system classification. 
13.4 Thermosensitive Gelling System for Rectal 
Administration
The drawbacks of traditional solid suppositories can be resolved 
by developing a thermosensitive liquid suppository. Regrettably, 
only a few studies describe their therapeutic use. Recent trends, 
however, show that this model treatment system is progressing 
at a faster pace. The application of thermosensitive liquid
suppositories for anticancer, analgesics, antiemetic, psychiatric, 
antihypertensive, anesthetic, antiallergic, antimalarial medicines, 
and insulin has recently been discovered [194–196].

538 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
• Minimizing exposure of the gastric mucosa to irritant drugs 
• Systemic as well as local effects [197–198] 
13.4.2 Limitations
	The new field of research 
	High production cost 
	Preparation difficulties 
	Difficulties in the selection of a temperature-sensitive
polymer 
	Rectal mucosa irritant drugs [199] 
The elements that need to be considered for the 
development of the thermosensitive gelling system include 
the selection of temperature-sensitive polymer, gelation time, 
rheological properties, and composition of a thermosensitive 
liquid suppository [200]. Thermosensitive Liquid Suppositories 
composition and transport mechanism are shown in Table 13.1. 
13.5 Mucoadhesive Liquid Suppository
In situ gelling suppositories are liquid suppositories at 
room temperature but convert to gel when exposed to body
temperature. A liquid suppository of Nimesulide, a non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) was created to increase patient 
compliance and systemic absorption in rheumatoid arthritis 
and other musculoskeletal conditions. To modulate the gel
strength and impart mucoadhesive force to the suppository base, 
Poloxamers P188 and P407 temperature-sensitive gelatine
property), HPMC, and Carbopol 934p were used by the cold 
method.

Approaches
To increase the therapeutic outcomes of medication for both 
systemic and local therapy, incorporation of nanoparticles.

The nanoparticulate rectal dosage forms are distinct from 
conservative rectal dosage forms in that they encapsulate or 
load the medicine into nanoparticles before dispersion in 
a formulation base. Nanoencapsulation would be used to 
preserve chemicals from degradation, increase the solubility  
 
 
 
 
 
540 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
of hydrophobic substances, and adjust drug release kinetics
(e.g., prolonged-release or controlled release) [209]. 
13.6.1 Biological Benefits of Nanoparticulate Systems
• Extend encapsulated chemicals’ residence time (even when 
diarrhea increases colonic motility). 
• Improve cellular uptake. 
• Facilitate easier gastrointestinal transport. 
• Distribution of medication and medication release should 
be uniform. 
• Encourage medication accumulation at the area of mucosal 
infection (e.g., inflamed tissues). 
To successfully deploy nano drug delivery for rectal 
medication administration, two key aspects must be considered. 
The initial concern was the physicochemical properties (Size, 
composition, charge, and surface qualities) and the effective 
contact of nanoparticles with the colorectal and rectal mucosa. 
The base and nanoparticles interaction in the dosage form comes
in second [210].
Nanoparticle interaction with the dosage form base comes 
in second. By permitting more contact between medication and 
the mucosal surface, mucosal penetration, cellular absorption, 
and drug release would all be improved. Nanoparticle stability 
in the pharmaceutical formulation should be taken into account 
during the manufacturing and storage stages. Rectal drug delivery 
success depends on mucosal adherence since it decreases the 
risk of nanoformulations being eliminated by leakage, mucus, or 
quick transit time (e.g., diarrhea) [211]. For rectal application,
a variety of nanoparticulate technologies were explored. 
13.6.2 Nanoparticulate Liquid Dosage Forms
Buffered solutions and aqueous liquids such as water are 
commonly used to make nanoparticles. Early investigations 
examine the importance of nanoparticulate systems for rectal 
medication treatment mainly for liquid dosage forms [212].
Proof of concept experiments is typically employed in aqueous Nanoparticulate Rectal Drug Delivery Approaches 541 
solutions to reduce the interference of the formulation base with 
nanoparticles.
Nanoparticles with different sizes (500, 200, 100, and 
40 nm) were examined. When healthy animals were used in the 
investigation and colitis was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene 
sulfonic acid (TNBS), it was possible for nanoparticles coated 
with PEG of all sizes to correctly diffuse across the tissue surface 
of the colon, suggesting enhanced medication administration. 
While keeping their mucus penetrating characteristics, hydrophilic 
surface chemistry produced by surface PEGylation of nanoparticles 
lessens their interaction with the digestive tract. There is only a 
little research on nanoparticle drug administration to the rectal 
mucosa in a liquid dosage form for systemic as well as local action.
The absorption of common nanoparticles and microparticles 
into the rectal mucosa of patients with and without IBD was
studied by Schmidt et al. (2013). Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid 
nanoparticles (mean particle size of 3 m) and microparticles 
(mean particle size of 250 nm) were distributed in a saline 
solution containing 10% human albumin. The protein in the 
dispersal media stabilized the particles and lowered their surface 
charge via surface absorption. The microparticles were shown 
to have been deposited in the ulcerous lesion of patients with 
rectal Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, according to the 
results. Only traces of nanoparticles were found in the mucosal
lining of IBD patients, indicating a clear size-dependent variation 
in particle accumulation. While microparticles accumulated 
and bioadhered to the inflamed mucosal membrane, there was 
no epithelial barrier penetration. Patients with IBD have been
found to have nanoparticles translocate to their serosal 
compartment, which could result in systemic absorption. There
were basically no nanoparticles or microparticles in the rectal 
mucosa of healthy control subjects. According to the researchers, 
local medicine delivery for intestinal disease in humans does not 
require nanoparticles. The difference in element size between 
animal and human studies is still unknown [213].
Osmolality and physiological pH have been widely considered 
for the development of rectal drug administration. Enemas can 
be tailored for systemic and/or local nanoparticle distribution, 
as demonstrated by Maisel et al. (2015). When compared to 542 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
potassium-based enemas, enemas based on hypotonic sodium 
were discovered to be a viable liquid preparation base for 
enhancing the supply of PEGylated polystyrene nanoparticles 
on the colorectal epithelial surface. Enemas based on hypotonic 
sodium increased fluid absorption and homogenous dispersion 
of nanoparticles throughout the epithelial surface. By preventing 
nanoparticles from getting into close touch with the mucosal 
surface, hypertonic enemas caused fluid secretion and intestinal 
distention. Strongly hypertonic enemas can harm the intestinal 
epithelium when administered as a pre-treatment, allowing 
hypnotically delivered nanoparticles to penetrate the tissue. 
Overall, problems with nanoparticulate liquid dosage forms may
be similar to those with conventional liquid dosage forms. 
Despite the fact that liquid dose forms spread more evenly in the 
rectum, they sometimes have low leakage and retention rates, 
which might result in inconsistent drug absorption [214].
The dosing frequency and clinical application will have a 
substantial impact on their effectiveness. Furthermore, preliminary 
study reports from liquid dosage forms demonstrated that 
nanoparticles may increase rectal drug delivery. 
13.6.3 Nanoparticulate Solid Dosage Form
Rectal medication delivery utilizing solid dosage forms of 
nanoparticles has only been tested in a small number of trials. 
For the prospective treatment of severe seizures, Abdelbary (2009) 
et al. synthesized solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) encapsulating
the water-insoluble diazepam. The release patterns of the 
nanoparticles, the particle size, and the degree of entrapment 
efficiency would change if the surfactant, concentration, or kind
of lipid matrix were altered. Sixty percent of the medication 
formulations had particles with diameters less than 500 nm, 
according to laser diffractometry and transmission electron 
microscopy [215].
Hard fat suppositories with nanoparticles were effectively
incorporated (Witepsol W35 and Witepsol S58). SLN-containing 
suppositories had significantly longer drug release than free
drug suppositories were demonstrated by In vitro tests. The SLN­ 
Nanoparticulate Rectal Drug Delivery Approaches 543 
containing suppository formulations delivered the drug faster 
than the free drug suppositories. The effectiveness of rectal 
formulations in vivo needs to be investigated further. Faster drug 
release into the physiological fluid may be possible with the 
diazepam-loaded SLNs’ release profile, which is favorable for 
emergency medical treatments.
Mohamed et al. investigated the concept of drug-loaded 
nanoparticles with suppository substrates with varying solubility 
properties (2013). This work involved the incorporation of the 
hydrophilic medication metoclopramide into SLNs (particle sizes 
varying from 24.99 to 396.8 nm), which were then converted 
into suppositories by utilizing a lipophilic base. Most of the 
metoclopramide was released from SLNs by the suppositories
with a coca butter base, which was probably due to the lower 
melting point and lack of hydrophilicity. As a result of the lipid 
coating on the nanoparticles, the formulation allowed for long￾term drug release. In addition to showing extra sustained￾release features in vivo, metoclopramide-loaded SLN suppositories 
showed the same gastric emptying percentage as the commercially 
available metoclopramide suppository (primperan), negating the 
necessity for multiple dosing [216].
Siczek et al. (2018) examined the use of cocoa butter 
suppositories to release silver from silver-coated glass beads for 
anti-inflammatory effects in IBD patients. Before being covered
with silver, the borosilicate glass beads had a diameter of 
1,000 mm. Silver was released quickly in in vitro drug release 
experiments employing silver-coated glass beads; more than half 
of the deposited metal was released in the first 30 min. About
30% of the silver was still on the glass beads after 24 h. The
efficiency of the in vivo formulation as well as the rate of silver 
release from the suppository’s silver-coated glass beads needs 
further research [217].
An X-ray CT examination of suppositories comprising silver￾coated glass beads indicated a uniform circulation of the beads 
throughout the suppository volume with minimal sinking or 
agglomeration. Only a few research has employed nanoparticles 
in solid dose form for rectal drug administration; more 
research is required. Particularly in vitro and early in vivo studies 544 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
demonstrate the drug formulation strategy’s promise for drug 
release characteristics. To show that these nanoparticulate
formulations are secure, bioavailable, and effective, proof of 
concept is still required. 
13.6.4 Nanoparticulate Semisolid Dosage Forms
The thick viscosity of gels aids in rectum retention and increases 
drug absorption by increasing contact with the rectal mucosa. 
Gels have rectilinear transport capacity. The use of mucoadhesive 
polymers and/or thermosensitive polymers in the formulation 
base has resulted in a number of advancements in rectal medication 
delivery, much like with conventional semisolid dosage forms.
The physicochemical qualities of the nanoparticles dictate the gel 
base and its composition, and they should ideally not interfere
with drug release or nanoparticle contact with the rectal mucosa.
It has not been proven that mucoadhesive bases alone 
can transport nanoparticles into the rectum. For the transport 
of nanoparticles through the rectal mucosa, thermosensitive 
polymers in the drug composition base are becoming increasingly 
popular. These polymers develop a liquid dosage form that was 
easy to administer and disperse throughout the mucosa at room 
temperature before converting to a gel phase. Melo et al. 
investigated the colorectal retention and distribution of PLGA 
nanoparticles (poloxamer 407) embedded on a thermosensitive 
base (mean particle size 170–180 nm) [218]. 
In vitro experiments on drug release showed that 
dipivefrine-loaded nanoparticles in PBS released the drug more 
quickly and effectively than free drugs in a thermosensitive base
did over the course of an 8 h period. Furthermore, testing on live 
mice demonstrated that the thermosensitive base dispersed
nanoparticles in the colorectal region at a slower but larger 
rate. The nanoparticles were also retained in better condition in 
the colorectum. Din et al. (2017) established a novel irinotecan 
preparation for the treatment of rectal cancer. BY dispersing 
thermosensitive SLNs (mean particle size of 190 nm) in a solution 
of thermosensitive poloxamer, a double reverse thermosensitive 
nanocarrier system was created (DRTN) [219].  
 
 
 
 
Nanoparticulate Rectal Drug Delivery Approaches 545 
There has been little investigation into the use of thermo￾sensitive and mucoadhesive polymers as the formulation base for 
rectal nanoparticle injection. In order to increase the bioavailability 
of tizanidine, Moawad et al. (2017) added nanotransferosome 
(mean particle size of 150 nm) to a formulation base that also 
contained mucoadhesive polymer hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 
and thermosensitive polymer. The fact that the rectal route 
avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism certainly contributed to the 
increase in bioavailability. The nanoparticles’ permeation-enhancing 
effect was also credited with boosting the nanotransfersome gel’s 
bioavailability [220].
More study is required to determine how semisolid dosage 
forms interact with nanoparticles, including 
(i) Formulation stability 
(ii) Nanoparticle movement in the semisolid dosage form 
(iii) Formulation retention in the rectum 
(iv) Drug release from nanoparticles 
(v) Nanoparticle uptake and/or adhesion in the rectal mucosa 
13.6.5 Rectal Formulations in Clinical Trials
Rectal medications are already on the market, with more under 
clinical studies. Table 13.1 demonstrates clinically authorized
rectal medication compositions for local and systemic absorption. 
The drugs in these preparations usually have a wide therapeutic 
window between therapeutic and dangerous concentrations. 
This allows for a safety margin that accounts for variability in 
rectal medication absorption. Rectal medications that have been 
approved are mostly utilized for the short-term treatment of 
diseases [217].
In patients with ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, which is 
common in IBD, mesalazine, or corticosteroids, locally active
drugs are given for a longer period of time to induce remission. 
According to clinical trials, budesonide rectal foam and enema 
are effective in these circumstances, while lowering the potential
of systemic steroid-related side effects. Most of the rectal 
preparations used in the clinical trial would mix with currently 
licensed drugs with classic rectal administration such as enemas, 546 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
rectal gel, and suppositories. Most of these compounds are still
in clinical studies and are used to cure local diseases including 
IBD, fecal microbiota transplant, hemorrhoids, constipation,
bowel preparation, and so on [220].

Pain is treated with rare rectal formulations that target on 
systemic drug absorption. Clinical trial formulations, similar 
to approved rectal dosage forms, are typically used for short￾term treatment. The most innovative clinical trials are predicted 
to use thermosensitive rectal gels. Both healthy persons and 
people with ulcerative colitis have been examined for things like 
safety, preference, distribution, and retention. We expected to
see more success in clinical research for rectal drug formulation 
[218]. Conclusion 547 
13.7 Conclusion
Unique manufacturing techniques have evolved recently, allowing 
the new potential to produce highly advanced platforms for drug 
administration through vaginal and rectal routes, followed by 
systemic and local effects. Despite the fact that the vaginal route’s
full potential appears to be underutilized, the benefits of the
vagina as a prospective pharmaceutical management site have 
been identified and are already being used.
One of the most significant research topics in vaginal drug 
delivery allows the local action, which is a natural result of a 
variety of diseases and ailments that can arise in the vagina,
such as fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. Vaginal drug delivery 
techniques, on the other hand, are used to induce systemic 
effects. Hormone administration in menopausal treatment and 
contraception are the most intensively researched directions. 
Furthermore, vaginal drug formulations are being studied as 
potential prophylactic medicines for sexually transmitted illnesses, 
such as HIV. However, numerous vaginal physiological aspects, 
particularly the considerable fluctuation of vaginal circumstances, 
such as the pH, volume, and content of fluids, make drug
distribution difficult. These conditions vary within individuals,
which may contribute to various treatment responses in the 
same person. Even though the oral route is the most accessible 
and desirable method of drug delivery, there have been various 
cases where this is not practicable, either clinically or 
pharmaceutically. In these situations, the rectal route may be 
a viable option for administering medications with both local 
and systemic effects. Despite its benefits, the rectal route for 
medication administration is still underutilized. 
The lengthening of the vaginal residency time is one of the 
most important research directions for polymers used in vaginal 
medicine delivery. Smart and mucoadhesive polymers that increase 
viscosity when exposed to physiological conditions are frequently 
investigated for this purpose. It is crucial to remember that the 
desired product features can be obtained by chemically tailoring 
the polymer properties. In the case of any newly manufactured 
excipient, however, comprehensive research on potential toxicity 
and irritation to the vaginal mucosa is required. The majority of  
 
548 Novel Drug Delivery System for Rectal and Vaginal Targets 
the current literature concentrates on dosage form studies and 
uses in vitro tests and ex vivo animal models to study the features
of the studied systems, which is insufficient for proper safety 
evaluation. As a result, the toxicity of possible vaginal medication 
delivery systems should be considered more carefully in future 
product reviews. Other issues with vaginal products include 
their safety. The risk of primary component leakage to the sexual 
companion during coitus has been identified in the case of 
hormone-loaded systems.
Unintended systemic exposure to the active component as a 
result of medication absorption into the systemic circulation via 
topical intravaginal preparations is another crucial point. Despite 
the fact that this phenomenon has been mentioned previously as 
a possible therapeutic issue, the available literature suggests that
the risk of serious side effects is low because just a small quantity 
of the active component can be absorbed and have an impact on 
the entire body.
A large number of ideas and ongoing projects, as evidenced by 
several scientific papers, are pushing the technology of polymer￾based vaginal formulations to a new level in order to deal with 
issues such as poor bioadhesion, thinning with vaginal fluids, short 
residence time, inadequate dispersal in the vaginal cavity, or fast 
drug release. However, the appropriate safety testing techniques 
for vagina or rectal drug delivery that were included at the start 
of the project might be valuable in the development of future 
pharmaceutical products.
To fully utilize the potential of this route to treat systemic and 
local disorders, continued advances in vaginal and rectal medication 
formulation, as well as detailed investigations on the biological 
interactions of rectal and vaginal drug administration, are required.

Plant-based sources have always been a focal point in the 
origination of newer therapeutic entities. For cancer therapy, 
numerous phytoconstituents are available, such as taxanes 
(paclitaxel, docetaxel), vinca alkaloids (vincristine), podophyllo￾toxins (etoposide), and camptothecin. Moreover, like synthetic 
molecules, these also possess challenges such as poor solubility,

plant resources. 
14.1 Plant Bioactives Used in Cancer Therapy 
Cancer is mainly treated surgically by removing the solid tumors 
and afterward, followed by treatment with radiation and 
chemotherapy, which result in numerous side effects [1]. Another 
major problem of traditional chemotherapeutic agents is drug 
resistance caused by various mechanisms [2]. These issues can 
be reduced by utilizing natural sources. It was found that more 
than 80% of anticancer drugs belong to natural origin. Out of the 
natural sources medicinal plants are considered as the safest 
chemopreventive agents [3]. Plant bioactives are phytochemicals 
capable of modulating metabolic functions, which results in 
improving health [4]. They are extensively studied as a potential 
source for treating various diseases. They show structural diversity 
as it has a greater number of chiral centers and varied rings
as compared to synthetic drugs. This helps in the target selectivity 
and hence reduces the unwanted side effects [5].
Plant bioactives such as curcumin, resveratrol, genistein, 
psoralen, and epigenin contain polyphenols and are vastly
studied for their use in cancer therapy [6]. Curcumin is extracted 
from Curcuma longa and exhibits its anticancer activity due to 
its immunomodulating action by controlling different signaling 
pathways and regulating levels of cyclooxygenase-2, cytokines, 
and reactive oxygen species. It has shown therapeutic benefits
in various forms of cancer such as lung, pancreatic, gastric, 
prostate, and brain tumors [7]. Another phenolic compound used
in cancer therapy is resveratrol extracted from fruits and 
vegetables mainly berries, pines, grapes, and peanuts. It has also 
shown activity in skin, pancreatic, colon, prostate, liver, and breast 
cancers [8]. Quercetin is a flavonoid compound majorly present Plant Bioactives Used in Cancer Therapy 579 
in our daily diet. It acts by varying cell cycle progression,
inhibiting cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, thus promoting 
apoptosis. This compound shows excellent results in treating 
a wide range of cancers [9]. Paclitaxel is obtained from Taxus 
brevifolia and acts by resisting microtubulin depolymerization 
and it blocks mitosis progression [10]. Etoposide is obtained
from podophyllin and is primarily useful in treating lung cancer 
and ovarian cancer. It acts by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II,
which leads to the inhibition of DNA synthesis at the pre-mitotic 
stage [11]. Various in vitro studies related to plant bioactive on 
cancer cell lines are summarized in Table 14.1. 
Plant bioactives show a synergistic effect in combination 
with other plant bioactives. The main intention to give drugs 
in combination is a reduction in dose and toxicity. In a study, 
resveratrol and etoposide were given in combination to treat liver 
carcinoma and colon cancer, which improved the antiproliferative 
effect [12]. Quercetin and curcumin increase the apoptotic effect 
in breast cancer when used in combination. However, these plant 
bioactive compounds have poor bioavailability, which can be 
improved by developing an appropriate formulation [13]. Other 
plant bioactive combinations were indirubin and vinblastine 
in cervical cancer treatment [14], curcumin and resveratrol in
colon cancer treatment [15], and quercetin and resveratrol in 
prostate cancer treatment [16]. 
This similar kind of synergistic behavior has also been 
seen in the combination of plant bioactives and synthetic 
antineoplastic drugs for anticancer activities. Curcumin reverses 
the 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance by downregulation of NFk 
B signaling and increases the activity in gastric cancer [17]. 
Rauwolfia vomitoria extract reduced the tumor burden by up to 
90% in ovarian carcinoma when combined with carboplatin [18]. 
Another combination that shows synergistic effects is quercetin 
with doxorubicin (useful in various forms of cancer, including 
breast cancer) [19], berberine with tamoxifen (also useful in 
breast cancer treatment) [20], and curcumin with cisplatin (useful 
in ovarian cancer) [21]. 580 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications

14.2 Various Challenges to Deliver 
Plant-Derived Molecules 
Despite various studies having been carried out, cancer is the 
leading cause of death all over the world. Cancer treatment is 
available with various synthetic chemotherapeutic agents but 
toxicity issues such as nephrotoxicity and skin toxicity have been 
reported from various synthetic drugs such as doxorubicin and 
5-fluorouracil. Thus, an alternative arrangement is adopted for 
producing safe and less expensive cancer treatment. Plant-based 
molecules in the form of nanocarriers are adopted for cancer as 
they have good potential as antitumor agents. Moreover, they 
are safe and environment-friendly. Generally, they are a variety of 
plant-derived molecules available, such as vincristine, vinblastine, Various Challenges to Deliver Plant-Derived Molecules 581 
taxol, curcumin, and other agents. The basic challenges for these 
agents are poor aqueous solubility and their adverse effects [33].
Irrespective of enormous therapies for cancer by various plant￾derived molecules, there have been various challenges in 
providing favorable outcomes in clinical studies [34, 35]. The 
major issues encountered with various polyphenolic plant￾derived agents are less water solubility, reduced stability, and 
poor bioavailability. The extraction of these plant-derived
molecules requires specific solvents, which may increase the 
cost of extraction processes [36]. There are plant-derived
polyphenolic compounds when taken orally, they show very
inferior bioavailability [37]. Further, the metabolism of these
natural compounds occurs in the small intestine as well as the 
liver, which leads to reduced targeting in the main tissue in 
the bloodstream [38]. Thus, various Phase II enzymes convert 
these polyphenolic compounds into various methylated
derivatives in which their ability for therapeutic action is still 
not known. Apparently, the mobile dose for the production of
pharmacological activity is very less in experimental design
because the amount of aglycone part of polyphenolic compound 
concentration is reduced compared with its mobile dose. Thus, 
to showcase the active role of plant resources in cancer therapy, 
nanotechnology is used for the production of plant resources 
[39]. To overcome the challenges of the clinical application
of polyphenolic resources of plants, targeted delivery is secured
by the formation of nanosized carriers for natural resources. 
In this way, these carriers help to transfer these natural resources
to the site of tissue such as malignant to achieve maximum
anticancer properties along with minimum production of toxicity 
in the bloodstream [40]. In order to produce a targeting effect 
in stipulated cells, plant resources nanoformulation need to be 
prepared on the basis of unique alteration in their size and shape. 
The targeting to the tumor cells is primarily active and passive.
In active targeting, various natural actives-loaded nanocarriers 
selectively target the site of the tumorous cells concerned, 
which leads to the avoidance of several adverse effects that were 
otherwise shown in conventional formulations. Passive targeting 
also plays a similar role in targeting tumor cells by nanoformulation 
of plant resources through the enhanced permeation and retention 582 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications 
(EPR) phenomenon of nanotechnology. In cases of other selective 
routes, there would be chances of unstable maturation of solid 
tumors, and natural resources might come in the state of higher 
permeability as well as retention passage which leads to the 
formation of nanoformulation as the best mode of treatment of 
solid tumors [41].
The other challenges faced by nanoformulation for adopting 
the process of targeting are formulation issues, passage in the 
body, simultaneous relation with the living system, and minimal 
reduction in toxicity so that a complete plant active loaded in 
nanoformulations can be formulated. The prime concern of 
formulation is the ability of nanoparticles to act as an antigenic 
agent on their own. The bioavailability and safety concern is 
related to the size and shape of the nanoformulation. Thus, 
nanoformulations of the size range of 20–30 nm are adopted as
they are easily cleared by the excretory system, and size less 
than 200 nm is engulfed via the process of phagocytosis [42]. 
Furthermore, the stability of a nanosystem is also affected by 
other parameters such as surface charge, and lipophilic character 
along with various interactions with functional groups of 
the various other biomacromolecules. These nanoformulations 
have shown excellent results in cases of safe hemolysis such as 
thrombocytopenia and lysis of erythrocytes [43]. The formulated 
nanoformulation might react with plasma protein; thus it will
tend to act as a particle of foreign nature. This phenomenon leads 
to simultaneous galvanization of contingent passage that can 
cause supersensitive reactions and anaplasia trauma along with 
various immune reactions such as neural chemotaxis [44].
All these toxicological problems associated with the formulation 
of plant-based nanoformulation lead to safety challenges. The 
systems discussed above many are prone to toxicities issues. 
In order to obtain an ideal plant-based nanoformulation, minor 
adjustments must be done in various segments such as size, 
surface charge, lipophilicity, permeability, retention, and allergic 
reaction, and various immune responses must be handled 
and discussed so that the plant-based nanoformulation can be 
designed.  
Applications of Nanotechnology 583 
14.3 Applications of Nanotechnology 
Various nanoformulations have been developed and are in 
different phases to cater to the need of clinical requirements 
[45]. The encapsulation of plant-derived molecules is done easily 
through nanoformulation due to nanosized, big surface and 
volume ratio and biophysical characteristics. This will help to 
improve the pharmacotherapeutics activity of encapsulated plant 
molecules to a large extent [46]. Sustained drug release along
with stability of in vivo and immense systemic circulation can 
be achieved through plant-based molecules charging in the 
nanocarriers. The other significant advantages of plant derived 
molecules loaded nanocarriers are versatility, biocompatibility, 
biodegradability and targetability. 
Further, nanotechnology tends to enhance the bioavailability 
of drugs by modulating the biophysical characteristics like 
inferior solubility in water along with reduced stable nature with 
chemicals [47]. Additionally, the loaded drug can be protected 
through encapsulation, which safeguards the drug from the savage 
biological surroundings in the passage of systemic circulation, 
which tends to enhance the bioavailability. Thus, nanocarriers
are utilized to deliver drugs with poor solubility and/or stability.
In cancer therapy, the biggest challenge is the limitation of
drug permeation in the target tumor cells, which can be overcome 
by the formulation of plant-based molecule nanomedicine, 
which tends to improve drug permeation to designated tumor 
cells [48].
Other applications of nanotechnology are the improvement 
of drug therapeutic characteristics and reduced ill-effects of 
drugs because a precise dose is adopted for the procurement of
sustained release in tumor cells in which the clearance rate can 
be minimized. 
Furthermore, the toxicity issues of drugs can be resolved 
by the formulation of nanocarriers as they can modulate and 
achieve extreme intracellular agglomeration of respective drugs 
inside the tumor cells which results in high effectiveness in
cancer therapy [49]. 584 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications 
Drug pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic activity 
can be enhanced because the formation of nanocarriers tends 
to protect plant-based anticancer agents from the excretory
processes. Finally, the formulation of these plant-based nano￾carriers can reduce the tumor through the formulation of anticancer 
agents.
Currently, nanotechnology has great capability in cancer 
treatment in combination with various engineering biologics 
that enable the development of new techniques, which can be
proved through clinical trials in these fields [50]. 
14.4 Different Types of Formulation 
14.4.1 Lipid-Based Formulations 
Although polymer-based nanoformulations are one of the best 
alternatives for sustained-release systems in a clinical setup, 
toxicity issues and lack of scale-up moderation of polymers 
have led formulation scientists to work on other substitutes. 
Moreover, lipids-based systems offer various advantages over 
polymer systems, such as reduced toxicity, enhanced drug loading 
capability, biocompatible, biodegradable, and extremely high 
bioavailability along with sustained release as a well-defined drug 
delivery system to the main administration site [51]. The various
lipid drug delivery systems are discussed in the following
subsections. 
14.4.1.1 Liposomes 
Generally, liposomes are composed of bilayer phospholipids 
vesicles which are in tapered proportions containing phos￾pholipids and cholesterol for their structural formation in their 
central core region [52]. This structural formation helps in
gathering the main hydrophilic drug inside the core region,
whereas bilayers include all hydrophobic proportions in the drug. 
The most important characteristic of liposomes is to increase 
the pharmacokinetics of the drug and to help in reducing toxicity 
with increased effective therapy [53]. The main method of Different Types of Formulation 585 
synthesis of liposome is extrusion or sonication in lipid and 
polymer is mixed in molar proportion to form nanoformulation 
by the process of extrusion. There is a variety of liposome plant￾based nanoformulations of drugs such as quercetin, diospyrin,
and nuxvomica, which are studied, formulated, and analyzed 
shown in Table 14.2. Liposomal formulation of nuxvomica elicited 
anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and analgesic activity [54]. The 
responsible alkaloids isolated from the seeds of nuxvomica 
were brucine and strychnine. Both alkaloids have the profound 
ability to work in colon cancer by reducing cell multiplication and 
growth. Inhibition in the maturation of DLD1 xenografted tumor 
in nude mice was observed when the liposomal formulation of 
strychnine and brucine was used [55]. Brucine and strychnine 
can produce inhibitory effects against HepG2 cell multiplication.
Various other formulations of liposomal plant-derived molecules 
have been formulated such as pegylated liposome containing 
resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil tends to increase the uptake of 
caspase-3 that leads to apoptosis in the treatment of squamous 
carcinoma [56]. There are other liposome forms, such as co-loaded 
liposomal form of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and paclitaxel, that 
showed good entrapment ability along with induced apoptosis in 
the treatment of lung cancer [57]. Further, liposomal encapsulation 
of curcumin and resveratrol also have shown anticancer and 
antioxidant activity [58]. 
14.4.1.2 Solid lipid nanoparticles 
Basically, these particles are nanosphere-type carriers that contain 
a solid and lipid junction (50–1000 nm) which is composed
of waxes and triglycerides. Their melting point is more than the 
body temperature [59]. Generally, these are carrier systems 
that comprise solid lipids, and various methods employed for 
manufacturing the same are ultrafiltration, ultrasonication, 
and surfactant flocculation [60]. Several plant-based solid lipid 
nanoparticles have been reported for their anticancer outcomes 
in Table 14.2. Drugs like curcumin and paclitaxel in the form of
folate lipid nanoparticle lead to a sustained release of combined
drugs in the therapy of osteocarcinoma [61]. A study of lipid 586 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications 
nanocapsule of quercetin with Epigallocatechin-3-gallate was 
eventually performed to enhance the stability, solubility, and 
further therapeutic activity was enhanced. Further, encapsulation
in the form of suspension which is colloidal in nature tends to 
diminish the oxidation factor of quercetin, and in this way the 
stability of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is achieved leading to the 
formation of a stable suspension [62]. The novel formulations that 
contain a combination of plant-based molecules and synthetic 
drugs produce sustained release and minimization of toxicity 
issues in the treatment of cancer. Solid lipid nanoparticles were 
also made of curcumin with encapsulation with drugs like aspirin
and sulforaphane, which tends to impart enhanced controlled 
release, and this formulation’s low dose helps to decrease cell 
viability as well as reduced apoptosis in the cell lines [60].
Micellar nanocapsules in the form of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate
and Herceptin help good targeting at the tumor and reduce its 
growth in the breast cancer treatment [63]. 
14.4.1.3 Double emulsion 
This type of formulation is biphasic (oil and aqueous phase) 
and thermodynamically stable and composed of a dispersed
phase distributed in the form of minute globules (0.1–100 μm) 
in a continuous medium with the help of an emulsifying agent,
whereas a nanoemulsion includes the nano size of these minute 
globules, which helps in achieving controlled release along
good penetration the selected plant-based molecules [64]. High￾pressure homogenization was utilized to develop these types of 
formulations [65]. Double emulsion was adopted by Merlin et al.
to prepare polylactic glycolic acid nanoparticles of ferulic acid, 
which showed enhanced action of anticancer property through 
ferulic acid nanoparticles in terms of simple ferulic acid. The 
formulation nanoparticles of ferulic acid acts on cell lines of cancer 
and promote apoptosis that shows the high efficiency of plant￾based molecule in the form of a novel drug delivery system [66]. 
There are varieties of double-based emulsions of plant-based 
molecules, such as quercetin and docetaxel, which are reported
and analyzed for the antioxidant and anticancer properties
mentioned in Table 14.2. Table 14.2 Various lipid plant-based nanoformulation for cancer therapy

Different Types of Formulation 587588 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications 
14.4.2 Polymer-Based Formulation 
Despite significant advancements in medical technology, 
cancer treatment remains difficult due to the low cure rate. 
To overcome these challenges, nano-size-based formulations 
have been designed for their controlled delivery. Along with the 
other approaches, polymeric nanoparticles have also become 
a choice of delivery platform to carry the nutraceuticals to the 
target site, especially to elicit their anticancer potential due 
to the EPR phenomenon [77]. Moreover, to cater to toxicity
issues associated with the nano size of formulations [78], 
various polymers viz. natural or synthetic have been 
synthesized and evaluated for different cancers [79, 80]. Natural 
polymeric nanoparticles offer a once-in-a-lifetime potential to 
make significant advancements in cancer treatment while 
limiting the negative effects of conventional chemotherapies 
on patients [81]. Natural substances can interfere with the 
carcinogenetic process at several stages, including initiation, 
development, and promotion. It could be utilized further to avoid 
multidrug resistance developed in conventional combinatorial 
therapy [82]. Natural chemicals administered through nano￾particles have improved absorption and reduced the toxicity 
associated with high treatment dosages [83]. Due to the poor 
solubility of nutraceuticals and thus poor bioavailability,
response, or activity is shown in the sub-therapeutic domain. To 
cater to this, a high dose is needed, which leads to high toxicity 
associated with dose dependency [84]. So, nanotechnology 
was utilized and different types viz. micelle, polymerosomes,
dendrimers, hybrid of polymeric nanoparticles were formulated 
and evaluated for their anticancer potential (Fig. 14.1). These 
nanoparticles can be prepared via emulsification, nano￾precipitation, electrospraying, and microfluidic technologies.
Moreover, nanoparticles can be functionalized/targeted with 
different type of ligands viz. small molecules, aptamers and 
peptides to improve the site specificity, circulation time and
overall therapeutic efficacy [85].
Various natural polymers like biomaterials (e.g., chitosan, 
albumin, dextran, hyaluronic acid) were utilized for the preparation 
of nanoparticles for the treatment of different cancers [86]. Different Types of Formulation 589 
Various advantages like biocompatibility, biodegradability, and
non-immunogenicity make these polymers an ideal carrier for 
loading anticancer nutraceuticals [87]. Various polymers (e.g. 
Polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic 
acid)) containing lactic acid and glycolic acid like monomers are 
widely utilized in encapsulating nutraceuticals. Other polymers 
(hydrophilic type) like hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan are 
also used for anticancer therapy, where HA is widely utilized 
as targeted formulation by targeting HA receptors expressed in 
various cancerous sites. Similarly, nucleic acid-based polymers 
are also utilized to deliver doxorubicin and curcumin as an 
anticancer therapy [88]. Moreover, in some situations, the 
combination of polymers is utilized to formulate a robust delivery 
system to show a tuned release profile. 
Figure 14.1 Various nanoformulations used for delivering Nutraceuticals. 
14.4.2.1 Chitosan 
Deacetylation of chitin produces chitosan, a linear cationic amino 
polysaccharide, which is made up of 1,4 glycosidic linkages that 
connect N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and -D-glucosamine. It elicits 
higher biocompatibility, mucoadhesive, antimicrobial, and nontoxic 590 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications 
properties than other polymers [88]. However, except at low or 
acidic pH, chitosan is weakly soluble, limiting its applicability.
This challenge can be limited by using synthetic analogs of the 
parent molecule to control other biological activities. The 
nanoformulation was prepared with chitosan to target the cancer 
stem-like cells (CSLCs). This could be explained by the increased 
internalization of the nanocarrier due to its size (20), which thus 
leads to more release/diffusion into the cytoplasm, gradually 
moving into the nucleus and showing its cytotoxicity [89]. 
Moreover, chitosan can be modified/functionalized to utilize 
in different novel delivery systems such as microspheres,
nanoparticles, hydrogels, and micelles for the treatment of 
cancer [90]. In one example, chitosan ascorbate nanoparticles 
were formulated by falsification/ionotropic gelation method and 
evaluated for the treatment of cervical cancer (evaluated the 
cell viability in HeLa cell lines) [91]. In another example, siRNA￾loaded chitosan nanoparticles were formulated to treat non￾small lung cancer by targeting of epidermal growth factor 
receptor, and it was found that the targeted formulation inhibited 
tumor growth more effectively than the nontargeted stem-like 
cancer cells formulation (NSCLC) [92].
Moreover, folic acid-decorated chitosan nanoparticles of 
curcumin were formulated and successfully evaluated for folate 
receptor-expressed breast cancer cell lines. Modification of amine 
groups of chitosan with folic acid significantly modifies the property 
of parent characteristics of chitosan and turns nanoparticles
into a target carrier [93]. Vivek et al. also evaluated the toxicity 
of curcumin-loaded chitosan NPs and found them more effective 
in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells), wherein they showed 
more efficacy than free curcumin, while the blank NPs solicited 
no toxicity in noncancerous L929 cells [94]. Furthermore, 
glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)-modified chitosan NPs were prepared
to target glycyrrhetinic acid receptors of hepatic cells (QGY-7703 
cells) for liver cancer treatments [95, 96]. 
14.4.2.2 Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) 
Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) has been widely employed
as a medication carrier approved by the US FDA and European Different Types of Formulation 591 
Medicine Agency in clinical medicine among a variety of 
biodegradable polymers [97]. It has a promising degrading property 
that makes it appropriate for hydrophilic or hydrophobic drug 
sustained release. They can also easily conjugate with specific 
target molecules, allowing them to change their surface features 
and increase interactions in order to reach certain tissues or cells. 
Due to the biodegradability and low toxicity of its monomers, 
PLGA is widely used in the development of nanomedicine. 
Currently, it is the most extensively used synthetic polymer 
in the manufacture of drug-loaded nanoparticles for cancer 
therapy [98]. It was used in the enhancement of solubility, 
bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy of β-sitosterol against
breast cancer cells [99]. It was also proved with the example
of rutin, when PLGA nanoparticle-loaded drug improved the 
antioxidant potential and overall efficacy of the treatment of
hepatic carcinoma [100]. 
14.4.2.3 Albumin 
Albumin is the most often employed protein-based natural 
component for cancer medication delivery. In one example,
albumin nanoparticles of piceatannol were formulated using a 
cross-linking agent (glutaraldehyde) and evaluated the toxicity 
for colon cancer cell lines (CaCo-2 and HT-29 cells). These 
nanoparticles have shown higher uptake through endocytosis
and elucidate improved colon cancer therapeutics. Results of a 
study showed that albumin nanoparticles suppressed tumor 
growth in the murine model much more effectively [101].
Jithan et al. created albumin nanoparticles of curcumin to 
improve the therapeutics of breast cancer. Their experimental
study reported that albumin NPs improved the solubility
and provides sustained release. These NPs have also shown 
greater anticancer activity than free curcumin in treating breast 
carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) [102]. 
14.4.2.4 Gelatin 
Gelatin can be used to treat a variety of malignancies as a 
medication carrier. Karthikeyan et al. formulated gelatin-based 
resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles and evaluated its therapeutics 592 Nanonutraceuticals and Their Applications 
in lung carcinoma cells, wherein in vitro release study elucidated 
sustained release pattern after the immediate release profile of
the drug. Moreover, the drug was quickly absorbed when loaded 
in nanoformulation and showed higher anticancer activity in 
Swiss albino mice [103]. 
14.4.3 Metallic and Other Formulations 
Metal nanoparticles are formulations having a size range 
between 1–100 nm with the advantage of surface charge, 
dynamic structure, and large surface area. Moreover, owing to 
nanostructure and surface charge, it can easily interact with the 
biomolecules thus resulting in better targeting [104]. Positively 
charged nanoparticles elucidate a higher internalization rate than 
negatively charged or neutral particles because the interaction 
with the negative charge exists on the cell membrane [105]. Metal 
nanoparticles also have different biomedical applications and 
are also used for diagnostic purposes for imaging cancer cells 
[106]. 
A number of metal nanoparticles have been synthesized
from different metals such as silver, gold, copper, and platinum 
that exert anticancerous effects [107]. Gold nanoparticles are 
an effective carrier system as they are chemically inert and 
biocompatible. Studies have revealed the use of gold nanoparticles 
in treating different kinds of cancers, namely colorectal, renal, 
cervical, leukemia, and bone marrow cancer [108]. Another metal 
is silver, which was used in ancient times to treat various infectious 
diseases and also in World War I [109]. Later on, its use in cancer 
therapy was explored. Many studies have shown the use of silver 
nanoparticles in breast, prostate, lung, skin, hepatic, cervical, 
nasopharyngeal, and colorectal cancer. Silver nanoparticles 
can be developed into different sizes and shapes by utilizing 
different reducing agents [110]. Similarly, copper nanoparticles 
are also extensively used as a carrier for delivering anticancer 
drugs. Moreover, their experimental procedures are simple and 
economical and can be obtained in high yield [111]. Conclusion 593 
These metallic nanoparticles are also utilized to deliver 
plant bioactives in cancer therapy. Numerous studies have been 
conducted by utilizing different metallic formulations of plant 
bioactive in which gold, silver, and copper metals are used. 
These formulations show effective results in treating cancer 
by actively targeting the cancer cells or reducing side effects.
Silver nanoparticles of Adenium obesum (Desert Rose) were 
biosynthesized and acted by generating reactive oxygen species
that further induced apoptosis and autophagy. TEM images
revealed the size of the particles is between 10 and 30 nm and 
most of them are spherical. Anticancer activity was investigated
on MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines. IC50 value was determined
to be 217 µg/ml [112]. Copper oxide nanoparticles of black bean 
extract were synthesized using the green synthesis technique. 
An in vitro anticancer study was performed on the HeLa cell line. 
The results indicated that copper oxide nanoparticles induce 
reactive oxygen species depending on dose and reduce cervical 
cancer [122]. Table 14.3 presents the list of metallic formulations 
of different plant bioactives. 
14.5 Conclusion 
This chapter focused on gathering information about nanodelivery 
systems utilized for carrying nutraceuticals. It is evident, especially 
in the COVID-19 era, that the whole world is inclined toward 
the more usage of natural constituents to improve the preventive 
measures taken against various pathological conditions such as 
inflammation, cancer, diabetes, and poor immunity-associated 
disorders. However, due to various limitations like solubility, 
permeability and stability associated with nutraceuticals, it is 
difficult to commercialize them in nanoforms. Here, we were 
able to successfully review the various delivery systems based 
on nanotechnology such as polymeric, lipidic, and metallic 
nanoparticles to improve the bioavailability, efficacy, and safety of 
nutraceuticals. Moreover, various formulations of nutraceuticals 
based on these novel technologies are available in the market and 
several others are under study. Table 14.3 List of metal nanoparticles used for delivering plant bioactives in cancer therapy
